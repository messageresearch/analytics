TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the year in preview we know God's will for us this year the three six things we've been looking at let's just look back at some of the three the three things we've been looking at on Wednesday night there's one Sanctified the whole your home gather around the word and live for others and I just want to point one thing I think we've covered these in a general enough way to where we understand what each one of these things refer to but in looking back to live for others that we addressed last Wednesday night we kind of look at it as a product of the Sanctified home in the practice of gathering around the word so the order of this was important to where with a Sanctified home and a discipline of gathering around the word we put ourselves in position to fulfill this third part of God's will for us and that's live for others and so we were wanting to see this order as important so when we look at these other three things that we are kind of identifying with us as a church and things we do as Believers of attend church contribute tithes and offerings and support missions we've looked at assembling together we've looked at giving this past Sunday and tonight we want to spend a little bit of time looking at support missions and I just want to say this before we go deeper into it that the order is again important with respect to this that assembling and contributing to get together kind of puts us in the best position then to Faithfully support missions and Sunday morning hopefully we'll take a little bit of time to share with some of the missions projects that our church is currently laboring in and supporting and then even just a statement or two of brother branham's about giving towards that so we'll save that for Wednesday that relates specifically to our churches giving and what we're doing the mission field but we want to tonight before we get into it just mention how these first two things just as sanctifying your home and gathering on the word puts you in the best position to live for others it's really the same image when it comes to us as a church that as we assemble together as a body of Believers and we contribute and we're giving according to the will of the Lord as we have feel led in our heart then that puts us in the best position to support missions because it wouldn't be right to focus on everything else if our home is in order it wouldn't be right to try to serve others when we're not serving at Jerusalem first or charity beginning at home and the Bible says in First Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 40 let let all things be done decently and in order that decently it's honestly and and with a fixed succession and that's how God's will is God's Will has an order and you'll find that order is very very important and sometimes we say oh it's God's will for this and it's God's will for that and and typically God's Will has a time and a season for it to be fulfilled in he has somebody that he's calling to do it and so it's not just well just kind of grab and whatever happens throw something in the air and whatever sticks and that's what I'm going to do but God has an order as to how things are done and it's understanding that order that really gives us a sense of satisfaction when we've done it in order so we want to do things honestly and in God's order God's succession how he's arranged it and do it that way and that's what we're wanting you to think in terms of these six things as we could refer to them all as six things together if you try to find some way to arrange them where it works out just right I think you might find it a challenge to rank them one to six uh but it's just a matter of knowing that with respect to ourselves individually and personally as it relates to our stewardship at home those are the three things that we must do and when it comes to a church or attending church and our service to a body in our participation with the local body the order is important now in looking at the subject of supporting missions or support missions as the will of God for us and let's not lose sight of that that that is what we're looking at is the year in preview is God has told us what his will is so we're having a little bit of a glimpse of what our year holds for us what path he wants us to go in and so let's look at this subject of support missions in Mark chapter 16 verse 15 this is a very obvious place to go with respect to this and I wanted to share this just to point out what brother Branham said about this and how that we all come under this burden he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature that's all the world and so for the gospel to go all to all the world I believe that this responsibility is the responsibility of the body of Christ that it doesn't fall on any one local church and it doesn't fall on any one region or any one country but if you are part of the body of Christ and all of us professing to be part of the body of Christ we should feel the burden of this commission not only to evangelize our community and witness to our friends and be a light to those we come in contact with but we should have a burden about the gospel needing to go to Every Creature to all the world and that there should be some at a very minimum a consciousness of that burden and a prayer that this should be happening because this burden that the gospel should go to all the world is a burden and responsibility for the body of Christ and in the message indictment brother Branham says and he after quoting this scripture he says and if it ain't half reached yet and there are millions die every year that don't even hear the name have never even heard the name of Jesus and this phrase is why I'm using this statement so it's still the general orders it's still a commandment of God does use enough a statement that kind of kind of zeroes in on some things that you could use to really build what this commandment means and he says it's still the general orders it's a commandment of God so he can say it's God's will it's God's will that we go into all the world and preach the gospel that's still a commission that is upon the Christian church if you're a Believer if you have been impacted by this message I believe as long as we're still here going still breathing that we're under that commission and he says it's still the general orders now he's using a military term and the general orders are a set of rules that guide a Sentry Duty in the U.S military maybe our military folk can just amen just a tad louder uh if if we hit it just right but these are a set of rules that would guide the the guards the Sentry Duty for the U.S military and it kind of describes the proper conduct for someone who has that responsibility and the first duty of century Duty or the general orders in the U.S military is I will guard everything within the limits of my post and quit my post only when properly relieved that sounds pretty good doesn't it is this is there a series in the making here I kind of like this I'll guard everything with the within the limits of my post was it what's post to post a duty when brother bam talks about a post of Duty it is talking about it's a military term when you have your post you have the place that you're going to be and post is used in other context but here when he says it's the general orders if that first order is that I will guard everything with the limits of my post and quit only when properly relieved my what a thought when it comes to our post to duty as Believers these things that we've been sharing with you these six things are part of your post to duty they're all part of your general orders it's the will of God for you at your post as a Christian and that post a duty it speaks of an area where regular duties are performed and so we have a poster Duty in the house of God you have a poster duty at home you have a posted Duty as a Believer and brother Ram says that this commission is part of our general orders and I want you to think about this thought of a general order I will guard everything within the limits of my post and I'll only quit my post when properly relieved this church hasn't been relieved yet of this commandment in this general order she's still on Watch and I say this church talk about the Church of Christ the body of Christ she's still under this commission to go in all the world and preach the gospel and we shouldn't quit until relieved of that order relieved of that post the second one is I will obey and I like this because there's general orders and the general orders contain a a specific order so that you can't ever use the general orders as an excuse not to do something you're asked to do he says I will obey my special orders and perform all my duties in a military manner and the church said yes sir right I will obey my special orders and perform all my duties in a military manner there's a way in which we perform our duty it says military manner in other words there's a certain way that you should dress there's a certain way you should act the way a certain way you should perform in a certain way that's expected of those who are in the century Duty and they have a general orders and they're called to guard something they're called to do something and they must do it in a military manner I believe for those of us who are fulfilling God's will for our lives we're only fulfilling it when we have done it in a christ-like manner kind of when we think about obedience and we teach our children what obedience looks like and we tell them that obedience is done um it's done immediately uh completely and cheerfully and that even if you get the job done but you don't do it immediately and you don't do it completely and you don't do it with a smile on your face then you haven't done it right and you can't go back and say well I did it if you didn't do it immediately completely and cheerfully that's not obedience and I think that's kind of a way that we can enforce this idea or look at this idea of what it means to complete something in a military manner there's a way that it has to be done so you can say that it has been done it says and I will obey my special orders within the context of the lives that are represented here today we can say with thus saith the Lord that these six things are God's will for you but many of you will have to carry out special orders many of you will have things that are more specific and even more precise and call you to do certain things and there's other areas in the word of God that a certain calling in your life or certain circumstance in your life is going to ask you to do something more specifically and part of our general orders are to obey the special orders I like that and so this part of this general orders is go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and that is what begins us to that's what caused us to begin to think about what missionary work would be and we'll get into the definitions of it here in a moment in Matthew chapter 9 verses 35 to 38 and Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues in preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them this is a burden now for Souls this is burdened for the sick it's burdened for those who can't hear and his burden is because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd that there was they weren't being properly fed they're not being nurtured they're not being cared for they're not being guided and there's this burden that he had so then he said unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plentius or his Harvest is great but the laborers are few and in light of his burden and his assessment there is a need that needs to be addressed there's a harvest that is ripe and there need to be laborers laboring in that Harvest and there's a great labor but the Harvest but there's no labors he says pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into his Harvest and so we are to go into all the world and preach the gospel and then Christ sees multitudes hurting and lost and without a shepherd and needing to be taught and needing to be clothed and fed and cared for spiritually and he says because of this great need we ought to pray that there'll be laborers sent into this work to labor for those who have no Shepherd who are scattered abroad and who are fainting and it's the sending forth labors into his Harvest that I want to use as a description of missionary work or as we say support missions and say in support missions it doesn't mean we try to find the missions brother Travis and I saw a mission here recently there's the oldest one in Arizona and so it's not trying to find one of these beautifully ornate missions that we can find out in the desert somewhere and said well what mission are we supporting is it the Our Lady of the dunes or is it Our Lady of the of the Saguaro what what which what mission do we want to support but missions as missionary work that's what we're trying to support and a missionary is one sent on a mission to spread the word to a new region or to a people and so when we think missionary work and just to delineate among Ministries and things we think about an evangelist I know that to us an evangelist is somebody who moves around a lot and sweats a lot right and Travis preaches at different churches we say oh he's an evangelist and so we're looking more at the manner in which someone preaches as opposed to the manner or even the gift they hold but evangelism a domestic evangelist here in the states who travel through and preach at a lot of different churches he has a different burden he has a different uh uh role that he plays within the body of Christ and and he is preaching at churches that are already established and works that are already thriving and doing the work of God and part of that Church's responsibility and having that evangelist come in is so that he can minister to the needs as a minister to the body of Christ the needs that are in that church but then also that church is supporting that work and that evangelist it gives them an offering and supports them and moves them on his way so it's the body of Christ working together and those things but that that labor is different than one who would go overseas or go somewhere where the word isn't established and where it hasn't been spread and then begin to find and work in an area to produce or promote and establish kind of the churches that we have so often and frequently here in the United States that evangelists can visit so missionary work is different in that regard and that's what we're referring to when we say missions I think of my Uncle Dennis when it comes to a missionary I so admire his gift I admire his burden I admire his labor in the gospel and his what he'll do is he'll go right now he's been spending a lot of a lot of attention in Bulgaria and our church here has supported the the printing of church age books and the Bulgarian language through his through his labor and his work that he's doing and he just goes to somewhere and he tries to find somebody who's a Christian or somebody who believes or finds someone's to talk to and then he just starts talking to him tries to build up a relationship and just sees where the Lord's going to take it he's not just pulling out his book and saying all right there's a message Church in Sophia there's a message church here this is a message Church there and just calls the pastors or emails and say hey I'm going to be in the area could I hold you a meeting I've known preachers do that they actually email somebody overseas and say hey I was thinking about coming uh it's going to be in the country and and then the person says well if you're going to be in the country why don't we schedule you for this date and then they plan their trip right they're only just doing a little bit of a fishing Expedition that's not missions that's fishing that's Visions but we're talking about people who go somewhere where there's nothing and just say Lord show me somebody who's faithful show me somebody I can work with and the testimonies that brother Dennis McGeary can share is just phenomenal it'll raise your faith it'll encourage you to see that God is still working in a book of Acts way because that's really what the Acts of the Apostles were it wasn't established it was an established churches in their Capstone it was establishing churches period and that's what real Apostolic work is is brother banham takes that idea of a missionary and he says it's really an apostle an apostle scripture he's a delegate it's a messenger one sent with orders and those apostles were sent out to establish the Christian church to establish the faith and that's what missions refers to is spreading the gospel in an area where it hasn't taken full root or maybe is just being established or if I can take it a step further where there's a need in supporting that work and those who are doing it and the message convinced and then concerned brother Brown says I want to say that the greatest call there is in the earth to my opinion is the mission Fields anyone who is a missionary is an apostle for the word Apostle means one cent and the word missionary is one cent so they're both the same word or used the same and why they ever preferred to call themselves missionaries I don't know but it's a good word or apostles and so I know maybe Apostolic order and apostles can cause some people to get a little bit leery because there's been those self uh professed Apostles who've tried to establish certain structures and orders here I'm familiar with some in North America that were the Apostle and so they had all their churches that kind of they were over and they controlled and all the tithes went to the Apostle and so maybe there's been some mechanics of apostleship and apostles that could kind of give us a little bit of a suspicion or a little uneasy feeling about it and it's maybe I would want to point that out necessarily to bring it into our view but I'll mention it just to say this there are true apostles who are doing the work of the Lord in a missionary sense and brother I'm saying who we call a mission is really someone who's like an apostle someone who sent with orders to establish things and introduce things and he says it's the greatest call there is on Earth in his opinions to the mission fields and the sermon Lord show us the father and it suffices us he says back to the missionary offering we're greatly appreciative of that we know that when you're doing missionary work you're doing exactly what the Lord said is that right for he said go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and that's the general orders of Christ and with and know then that that's right we can't go wrong when we're doing missionary work well that's to me that's really good if somebody's just in a run of doing a lot of bad things and a lot of bad luck and you want to figure out how to get out of the rut I mean you could pretty much you could look at this and say well all I one thing I know I can do is do what's right and start and pull myself out of that rut he says you can't go wrong when doing Mission work one place he said the word admissions is always right that's remarkable to think about this that he's he's putting this in one sense and he's in no way being dismissive of what we do here it's in no way and being dismissive of assembling ourselves together and contributing or sanctifying our home and gathering around the word and living for others you realize that it's all those things that kind of feed into this sense of having a burden for Missions and wanting to serve others and do something for other people and you realize I can't go wrong when I'm doing this because the word admissions are always right and so when it comes to missionary work I may be able to I think here in a moment we might touch on a few areas I realize now I didn't put together a slide for that I think we'll be okay as we run through it but the body of Christ through local churches and that's kind of the way that we have some sense of community and not necessarily organization but affiliation and camaraderie and laboring together the body of Christ through local churches that's the way that this responsibility is fulfilled and I believe that every local church when I say local it speaks of the body of Christ around the world that has some sort of local Gathering or symboling has some part of responsibility in this work to some level we should be conscious of and burdened by the work of getting the word out to those who haven't heard it and this opportunity to spread the gospel or spread the word to a new region to our people is obviously much greater uh in in areas overseas it's much greater in areas where Christianity hasn't been established there's a lot of Works taking place in in uh Muslim nations and places where there isn't Christianity uh going back to the labor that brother Dennis has been doing for a number of decades he was one of the first going into countries after communism fell and now they're being more welcoming to uh they could have Ministries come in he's been doing it for decades since the fall of Communism in some of these Eastern European countries that's where the opportunities present themselves but I'll say that the opportunity to support missions is much greater than just going overseas to preach and for some of the ministering Brethren here I know have done this and continue to do it the the few that are here tonight I know you've all labored in missionary work and gone overseas and and even uh brother Manuel you even know what it's like to start with a young church and be one that's there establishing things and getting a church started there in Mexico and so uh brother Loyola I know it's been overseas and that going over to preach I could say this and I don't mean to offend anybody but just going over to preach isn't being a missionary because I've done that a lot and I ain't a missionary of course because I'm going to places where there's churches that are already established and they have Bibles and they know the message but the opportunities are more than we have to think bigger than supporting missions as just paying for brother Airlines brother Aaron's air brother Airlines okay there's a brother Airlines praying for brother pilate to fly the airlines over there to go preach somewhere it's more than that there's more opportunities in that in the sermon the end time brother bam says I'm so happy to be here brother Moore was just telling me that they had taken up an offering for missionary work to be given over to me for missionary work and brother Branham in the few places I say few but in the several places he refers to this he's always very careful to say I'll use it for that and I'm not going to use this for myself personally even and I don't know if we are going to read this maybe Sunday morning but he kind of makes this comment some places that if somebody needs a sandwich or somebody needs a meal I'm not going to take it out of this I'll use my own money for that every penny going towards missions is going to go to that not even for these meetings we're doing here he's saying it's going to go towards that and he says thank you may God bless you I just don't know how to say it it's just something about missionary that I just love it and I just know that you're doing God's will when you give to missions so now you can't go wrong when doing missionary work now we can't all do missionary work but we can't go wrong when we're giving to missions if I could put it that way and I know maybe I'm using a different language but let's just put this way you're in God's will when you give to missions and you ain't wrong if you're in God's will that is right it's not fair that one person hear the gospel twice when somebody hasn't heard it once everybody should hear the gospel at least once and I want to do my part to try to take the gospel to everybody that I know how every place so it's kind of giving you idea of what he thought missions was it wasn't just going to establish conventions establish meetings and established churches let's go into those places where people can hear the gospel for the first time used to be on the difference difference of the remunerations of the meeting and what I had left over I'd give it to charity organizations and so forth now I have nothing at all against them not at all and I think they're all fine every one of them from Salvation Army and Volunteers of America the Red Cross polio drives and many things like that it's good to give to those things but I thought the people that comes to my meetings were people who are usually poor people and they're interested in the kingdom of God while much of the world of the people to the common run of the people that doesn't go to church businessmen and so forth write checks for them drives and so forth for thousands and thousands of dollars while poor missionary suffers with the lack truly unique the way he's viewing this that there's a lot of causes that get all the tension and businesses are behind it and they support it he says but the poor people that come to my missions are to my meetings have a burden to see that the word get out and they can't give as much and he says to all these thousands of dollars are going to these tax deductible organizations and things he says while the poor missionary suffers in fact we know that we like to see everybody well we like to see people that's hungry be fed but you know the soul is the most important thing of anything in the mortal that's why missionary work isn't isn't uh building hospitals it's not building schools it's not providing medical equipment those things can be ancillary and the other and even providing food isn't missionary work but those are other ways that can be done things that can be done in a thriving missionary work where you can provide food you can provide medical supplies you can provide toothbrushes and toothpaste and things like that or maybe toothpaste might be better term to use just to encourage keeping them right but there's uh there's things that can go along with it that's part of it but the goal isn't just to you know a can drive and food drives and clothing and things like that the goal is the soul but you know the soul is the most important thing of anything in the Mortal because that's the thing that lasts forever I believe that every Christian is obligated to be a missionary so I take it back I am a missionary I am a missionary just not in the way we were thinking about it a moment ago he says I believe that every Christian is obligated to be a missionary I believe every Christian is obligated now not so much as you have to go over in the old countries and preach or something but if you can't go you can help send somebody else what you do to send somebody else I thought I had this statement in here where he says if if all you can do is just pray I think you've probably heard those statements before you can't send someone pray for them so it's not that you have to go over in Old countries or preach or something but if you can't go you can help send somebody else it's what you do to send somebody else and so there's a lot of different ways I could say that we support missions and I'd put it this way by praying primarily praying praying for and then providing for missionary work and those that are working in missionary work which would be missionaries and there's different areas of support that in these different areas that I want to share different things that you can do to support but they all kind of relate to the establishment of the word or getting the word to the people or keeping the word before the people making it available for them and here are just a few things that we could do as a church or things that you can do as a Believer and I say that since our church is new and we've only been here not even two and a half years and that for many of you for many years you've been supporting missionaries supporting Mission Works and there's a lot of wonderful missionary missionaries within the message and uh labors within the masses that are doing things from Bible Believers to present Truth Ministries and there's a lot of different ones you may already be supporting and so as you've had this uh Habit and discipline of already doing it I think that's wonderful so we're not trying to divert your attention away from that but even in those causes and what's being done in those Ministries and and Mission Endeavors for us also as a local church if we're going to be supporting missions or missionary work we're going to be praying and we're going to be providing for the spread of the message and the providing for the missionary work that's being done and the ways that we can do it if your financial resources that are needed takes Financial Resources to send missionaries and the most effective missionaries are the ones that are already there right if you're wanting to evangelize uh some of the tribes in Tanzania I would be the worst missionary to have do that the fact that there may be you know a cannibal hiding in a hole in the ground it might just be enough for me to say yeah I don't know they could stream it if they want I mean is it the word aren't if they're elect to it they're gonna hear it right so why do I need to go and risk life and limb and and this Peril by preaching the gospel but there's financial resources needed for those missionaries that are in these countries already living there among the people even of the of the language of the people that are uh spreading the gospel and going into regions and areas where the message hasn't gone and these Financial Resources many times are just it's the monthly salary that that man needs because it goes away for hours at a time and leaves his family behind he can't work other jobs and so sometimes they need a salary and you think man a salary well listen they can get on get by with a lot uh less than we can here and so for just a few hundred dollars sometimes you could support a missionary and he can have that as a monthly salary and that's kind of his he knows he's got enough to put food on the table and pay his rent or the different things they might have responsibility to do and then he can drive out into the bush and travel different places and evangelize and so a lot of the costs that are associated that Finance given and Financial Resources supports beside Beyond monthly set monthly salary is all the transportation costs to buy a motorcycle have a vehicle gas and different things like that and repairs that's a ways where money or financial resources can actually support and provide for missionary work and then as a missionary we would be going out and as he would be going into areas to spread the message and find converts once this happens missionaries establish churches and when they establish this church they're doing it where none existed before and so they're not they're they're having to find places to meet they're having to build buildings they're having to get all the tools and and the resources the physical resources that they need to have church and they need uh they need chairs and they need pulpit and they need a they need a building they need a roof and I've preached in churches that were made out of mud I've preached in places uh that are just kind of cobbled together and there's things that they do to have a facility and that's a way that you can support missions by helping with the establishment of the actual building or the building of a church and so where there's a need there's a need to build the new churches and then there's a need to teach the Ministries that are being raised up and those that are faithful sometimes they leave organization or they're just getting this call to preach and you have this need to teach new ministers and I would say that this for me personally and I don't often just try to give you actually most often and hopefully nearly always avoid giving you my opinion or my personal burden on things but for me this has been the most remarkable paradigm shift for me when it comes to missions I'd say most importantly the Believers need the message and they need it in their language or a language they can understand and that to me is kind of the end game the Translating the printing and the Distributing of the message in these areas where someone has gone broken new ground found converts and Believers and now they establish a church and what they need is they need the message for themselves when I first had the opportunity to go overseas and minister I was overwhelmed with the burden and the needs that existed and I did it a few times I remember having this sense of well they we need we need people going back on a monthly basis we need someone always there and you see the needs and the burden and I remember I had in my mind how how often can I go back or how often can we be going back and just for a guy like me with the limit of exposure I had maybe it was a little bit overwhelming and I remember I was having lunch with brother Biscoe and we were just sitting down fellowship and he began to share with me his his vision and burden and missions and as he was sharing it it just for me I had this tremendous paradigm shift because he was saying what we like to do is go to an area and get the message in the people's hands and so we established printing stations we as we translate message and we duplicate and we do all these things and then a light bulb went on I thought oh of course that's all they need because that's all we have too that like that's the that's the real heart of why we're here is we had access to the word of God and we heard that voice and it changed things for us and we have the privilege of continuing to feed on it and I knew then that just because the color of my skin or the my use of the English language didn't make me more qualified than the man of God that was being raised up in these other countries the only difference was I had nearly 1200 sermons in a language I could perfectly understand and he may not have any and I realized that if he could get all that I have his ministry will be far greater and far effective than mine could ever be and so for me really I really desire to see these other things done and work together to establish these things whether it be monthly salaries from missionaries whether it be building churches but at the end of the day if we can just at least get the message into people's hands they'll be just as rich as we are here in America because they really need the message brother babe says you're doing God's will when you give to missions we're doing God's will if we can support a work in any one of these areas he says you're doing God's will when you give to missions when you lend support when you do something in any one of these areas whether it be sending missionaries building churches providing the message in their language duplicating translating there's a lot of different things that we could do as Believers to work to support missions and so that's uh I think that's pretty pretty clear on it's God's will for us it may beg some more questions on just exactly what does missions work look like but it for me it's that laboring in a field that is still being cultivated and being established and we may not have opportunities to support Works where people are going into where there hasn't been any message before and maybe there's already some message churches that might have needs and may have need a new roof or they may need a new building and those are different ways that we can support it but one thing I definitely still see the need is to get the message in people's languages the labor that brother Paula Fontaine engaged in for a number of years he caught the burden and the vision of getting the entire message translated into Spanish and he made it a singular goal and over many different years I can't remember just how long it took but a few years ago they finally finished translating the entire message into Spanish and now it's available for anybody that speaks Spanish if they can get it digitally if they want to print it it's available the Believers there in in the Congo as Shekinah and brother Richard dioka and the vision they had with Shekinah Publications to get the entire message translated into French and so you have these major languages that have many many countries that speak those things these are critical moves of God to get the the word of God in the language of the people and these are ways these are ways that we can support somehow some way be involved through prayer or providing some resources in these areas is missions work and I hope that you that gives you a little bit to go by when I say support missions a lot of things you can do as a family whether it be to save money or every night when you do your devotions pray for missionaries pray for Mission work if you want to know the needs we could be in a better habit at the church just saying we should be praying for this one and praying for that one and sharing these things with you because I think we'll grow as a church if we do it grow in the right ways and so let me just use a few things to kind of sum up this thought and I think I think it fits really well with this idea of support missions but we read Psalms 37 23 maybe in the first service on this subject the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way it speaks of how even a powerful man his steps must be according to God's will or even a man of strength can succumb to weakness that the steps of a good man a powerful man is still his steps are ordered by the Lord and that is his protection that is ultimately his his strength or his buttress the very thing that's going to lift him up the steps of a good man were ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way the will of God is our source of happiness it is our source of satisfaction and inspiration that when we're doing the will of God that's when you're going to be the most happy it's not when you're making as much money as you think you ought to make when you're gonna be the most happy it's when you know you're doing the will of God and I could testify to this as a family right sister Elizabeth that we are as happy as we are today because we know we're in the perfect will of God and we constantly tell each other we're just happy we're where God wants us to be we're happy doing what God wants us to do and your greatest source of joy is going to be finding contentment in the place that he puts you in doing what it is he wants you to do and as believers we have different responsibilities we have this order we have this place that we need to walk in and that's going to be the source of your joy and a sermon by faith Moses how many been using their Psalms devotional you don't have to raise your hands you may give me a complex oh wow look look everybody's using it well if you read it yesterday you'll recognize this and by faith Moses but the real inspiration comes by doing the will of God whether it's just a one or just a handful real inspiration comes by doing the will of God if you're kind of in these doldrums you don't feel inspired you don't feel motivation you just don't feel like you have much enthusiasm there's just no there's not really any growing or groaning to do more you don't have that kind of that oomph that you need he says inspiration comes by doing the will of God we're going to find inspiration we're going to find Delight we're going to find pleasure in doing the will of God whether it's a big church or small Church it matters not whether he's a great eloquent speaker just the man that hardly knows his ABCs it doesn't matter it depends on the message that he's bringing whether it's inspired by the word of God or is it inspired by intellectuals conceptions of human inspiration but I believe we could take from this that real inspiration comes by doing the will of God as brother Branham told us that when it comes to going into all the world and preach the gospel it's still the general orders and he comes back to it later in that one statement we read where he says it's the general orders to do this to go into all the world and preach the gospel it's the orders that he gave the church it's the things that we steal are burdened by and must do together with that and these other things we've been mentioning as Believers we have duties and responsibilities and these duties and responsibilities that we have as Believers and if even if it's just these six things I've mentioned it gives us Direction every day of Our Lives it kind of gives us if you want to call it a spiritual bucket list if you want to call it a spiritual to-do list if it's a um an eternal day minder or something you've got something that's reminding you of the things that you must be doing and that you ought to be doing as a Believer these duties and responsibilities and these six things are part of God's will for us therefore it's the source of our inspiration and it is things that are not without purpose they're not without some outcome or consequence God isn't asking us to do any one of these without a promise to benefit and bless us to give us some sort of guidance to lead us and guide us brother Banner the sermon total deliverances says I wonder this morning as Christians if we've yielded our own will and yielded ourselves so complete to God till God can trust us the place that he has put us wow we're yielded enough of to our own will yield ourselves so completely God until he can trust us in the place that he's put us I wonder this morning of myself if I could be so yielded to God till God could trust me could trust brother Neville could trust our trustee board our Deacon board or our members of our church we all have a place and we got a duty we all do from the from the young men on this front row to the young ladies to my left they all have a place that we all have a place we have a part and can we be so yielded to this can we be so given over to his will can we be so uh completely trusting of God that he can trust us where he's put us because we have a place and we have a duty and we want to be about doing that brother Bram says in the sermon Witnesses I'd kind of held this quote didn't know just exactly where it fit in I'm just going to use it to kind of sum this up before we get to our text here he says seek ye first the kingdom of God that's what each one of these things becomes gasoline to or direction to a momentum to is seeking first the kingdom of God because think about it we say oh seek ye first the kingdom of God a lot of us can say well what does that even mean what does it mean to seek first the kingdom of God well there I've shared with you six things that are ways that we seek first the kingdom of God because there's something that we're giving to God and each one of those we're giving it to him first we're letting him have the preeminence and brother bear says seek ye first the kingdom of God and the sermon Witnesses he says have you ever witnessed that to be the truth put God first pay your tithes first pay everything first pay God pray first at morning pray all through the day give God the first place and everything you'll be a witness wow you want to live for others you wanna you wanna be a you want to support missions he's given us the template put God first pay your tithes first pay everything first pay God pray first at the morning pray all through the day give God the first place and everything then you'll be a witness that's how you seek first the kingdom of God and then seeking first the king God your life without even you having to open your mouth is a testimony is a witness of the things of God we have to realize that all of us are ambassadors of this message that in the things we say the things we do the things we allow to have the preeminence the things we pursue the things we talk about all these things or are part of us witnessing the Gospel of Jesus Christ and these things are God's will for us this year and if we'll take a look for a few moments if you have your Bibles handy we'll be looking at a few of these scriptures in the Book of Joshua in chapter six as we read those first five verses Joshua the book in The Book of Joshua Israel conquers Jericho and I want you to identify this element that conquering Jericho was the explicit expressed will of God that he told them to go to Jericho March around these walls so this was something that they were told to do this wasn't Joshua just saying oh well look this is the first one here this must be what we need to do but God said to do this this was part of the plan this is part of the vision part of the mission and as we read already the conquest of Jericho was very complex you could take some of the statements that are in the word of God and think that well why didn't God just kind of Thunder out and Tear Down the Walls and kill everybody before they got there there's certainly Miracles we see in the Old Testament where everyone in the camp is just dead or everyone is just flat or giant hailstones fall down but God told uh the Israelites to do things to make a motion to obey a certain order and I say it actually is kind of very unique it's a detailed it's complex it's repetitive right I mean it seems I know the numerologists kind of get really excited about the story but we're going to walk around once for six days and then on the seventh day we're gonna walk around uh these seven times around the wall and it seems to be it almost seems unnecessary because God is certainly able to do do more and it's even counterintuitive right but it was God's will and one thing I want you to take to heart tonight is we've mentioned these things and we've even tried in terms of the book of haggai we weren't trying to make the emphasis to build the Temple of the Lord but the emphasis was that was an analogy of doing the will of God or leaving the will of God undone that's what I'm trying to emphasize tonight that them conquering Jericho was the will of God and he wanted them to do it a particular way and in doing it that way they were fulfilling God's Will and it brought about a great victory and what I want you to take to heart in this is even in these things we've shared and other things that you hear in the word of God that are very detailed and precise and there are general orders and the things that we ought to do or even in the special orders that God gives us orders he establishes a standard he tells us how that we ought to act he gives commands in order that we might grow in his grace he does it for for momentum he does it for progress and God's will is used to challenge us and he asks us to do something because he just doesn't want to do it for us he wants us to do something so that we can see him do it and so it's his will I want you to recognize just the wisdom of God when it comes to applying the token in Exodus chapter 12 there was very specific things they were asked to do and very detailed things they're asked to do and it would all be touch points with God it all be ways that they're being conscious of the attitude of God and what God likes and it's one of those things that you begin to ask questions and they sometimes maybe do it with their spouses and things they say well do you know what their favorite color is and what do they eat for breakfast and what are the ages of your children and when were they born and who is your their primary care physician and the dads are kind of like ask Mom right and maybe you don't know all the answers but the more you know how people like things the more you know about them and how particular they are and so God's word establishes these requirements and he's wanting us to do it for the growth of our faith to stimulate us to become more christ-like and he gives us detailed requirements and things that we ought to do and it's his will challenging us to do his will in making that a goal it helps us to lay aside distractions and it and it makes us more disciplined to avoid hindrances I mean if you think about it say well Lord says oh well you know just just conquer Jericho and so I mean I wonder how many years they might have sat there trying to figure out a way to conquer Jericho but there's something about God giving you general orders and giving you marching orders and telling you what to do you're like well he told me to do this and I know this is going to work it's a way of focusing us and getting us away from the things that we ought not to do and it says this in verse 17 and 18 of Joshua 6 now as they're going to go forward and do this and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein for to the Lord only Rahab the Harlot shall live and she and all that are with her in the house because she hid The Messengers that we sent there's your missionaries going forth and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest you make yourselves accursed when you take of the accursed thing and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it it really says the accursed thing it says the city shall be accursed so the accursed thing was anything that related to the city they weren't to take anything out of it they were to to anything in it and those therein were accursed all possessions people you name it except for Rahab this person and her family so the accursed things were those things that were ordained to destruction again what I want you to use this as analogy of is the analogy of doing God's will that for the those in the Book of Joshua they were to conquer Jericho leave nothing leave everything behind let it be a curse let it be destroyed and save only Rahab they weren't to take anything out of it so we may not be asked to March around the walls of anything we may not be tasked with walking through rubble and making sure we're saving rahab's family use it now for us as a template of God's attitude towards us doing what he has asked us to do and as we read the story in Joshua we see that Israel conquered Jericho with ease and this was a great miracle this was an imposing city that was impenetrable that had walls that they could not tear down Israel did not have the means to destroy it so the strong walled city that was fortified against all attackers and could not be destroyed by human hands Israel conquered something that they themselves were not able to conquer but in doing the will of God the walls fell just exactly the way that it was supposed to happen and chapter 7 begins with us telling us that Aiken has now taken in a cursed thing and he's disobeyed the Lord but not everybody knows this the Storyteller kind of shares it with us so that we can understand what's about to happen when they go to fight this next battle in chapter 7 verse 2 and 3 and Joshua sent men from Jericho to I.E and I believe that's the right way to say it uh e and not AI is artificial intelligence we should be very afraid of that and Joshua sent Men We Shouldn't Be Afraid of Anything But Joshua sent men from Jericho to a AI as some people say but it's AI which is beside Beth Haven and on the east side of Bethel and spake unto them saying go up and view the country and the men went up and viewed I.E and they returned to Joshua and said to him let not all the people go up let about two or three thousand men go up and smite and make not all the people to labor for their for they are but few now to think of this contrast they just had this huge Victory and destroyed Jericho so now that they've destroyed Jericho they see the city of Ahi which was a weaker City the word all he means literally heap of ruins that's what it means and so they're thinking well we just destroyed Jericho and Jericho's become a heaper heap of ruins because of us now we're approaching a city that's already a heap of ruins and they're thinking we we don't even need as much might as much things as we did to defeat Jericho and what happens they sin but a few thousand men up to attack the city and 36 men die in 3 000 flee from the enemy now we could break out into our breakout groups and have some side discussions on this and begin to ask ourselves the questions why and I'm sure I could get a lot of very um wonderful answers from different people here who the word of God kind of catches them from different perspectives but I'll just State the obvious here one of the reasons why they failed is God never told him to do it it's one of the things that's explicitly missing in the text God told them to do what they did to Jericho and maybe Joshua saw this as a weaker enemy and acted outside of the general orders and he looks at this he's like oh well let's just go do it let's just go take it it seems smaller this seems logical this seems like an easy grab let's just go do this and maybe on the high of that Victory and we've got to be very careful when you get excited because of the victory you can immediately begin to presume and you fall flat on your face and what the devil starts to do is question the victory don't ever question the victory question your attitude post Victory and whether or not you adequately gave God the glory whether or not you checked yourself and made sure you were still in his will and you knew what the general order still were because as a church I believe that God is blessing us supremely but as He blesses us supremely we want to be supremely humble recognizing it as nothing but his grace is and they flee and and they're in a 36 men die after destroying Jericho without a loss but God never told him to go he acted presumptuously he's a he's kind of acting outside of God's orders because God had said in Exodus chapter 23 verses 29 and 31 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year Joshua's trying to accelerate the timeline trying to accelerate what God's doing and he goes forward but notice the wisdom of God lest the land become desolate and the Beast of the field multiply against thee by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land and I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even Under the Sea of the Philistines and from the desert of the river and I will deliver the inhabitants of the land in your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee but you don't need to try to do it all at once one after another on your own timeline and what you think is the will of God and how you think you should do it I'll do it and I'll do it little by little because recognize the wisdom of God that if he was to go and and he vanquishes I.E and he vanquishes this one and These Guys these three thousand men just take over all of Palestine just send these Mighty Men they'll go and they conquer and they drive everyone out and then they all come back around Jericho and it's like well the land is completely rid of all of our enemies and he says then the field is going to multiply against thee the Beast of the field is going to multiply against thee because you haven't grown enough to be able to possess all this land to give you all this land but you're not mature enough to handle it I'm going to give you all these promises but you kind of got to grow into it I'm going to give you a Ministry but you've got to kind of grow up in order to fulfill it and this is what's being expressed in this and this is something that Joshua left behind and wasn't thinking about is God promised to do it but you had to do it by little and little you had to do it according to God's Will and according to God's program each Victory requires maturity each Victory is to promote growth and every Victory there's Lessons Learned there's weaknesses exposed and God wanted to use this Battle of Jericho there for a very specific reason he gave these very hard details and say well you could say that you obeyed and marching around six times and obeying and March around on that seventh day but you have to stop after the victory and assess did we do it God's way did we do it the right way are we sure that nobody has partaken in the accursed thing because even victories sometimes can expose weaknesses and I believe that we can't try to do more until we've done the least there's things we want to do for God there's things we want to accomplish there's things that we want to see happen in our lives and we have I want to I want this to happen in 2023. this is the year I've been praying for this for year after year after year I want God to do this well don't think you're going to be able to do something like that if you're not just doing these little things doing all these things that we've got to do we can't try to do more until we've done at least what he's asked us to do we must follow his plan we can conquer things that are seemingly unconquerable when we're in his will but we fall to the weakest of things when we're out of his will the walls of Jericho can just fall like that when we're in his will and then come up to a heap of ruins and succumb to it run away from it be fearful of things think of it that's that's the that's what's been happening in our lives our great victories were because we were in his will his grace that's put us there and we find ourselves in the battle that we ought to be in I don't know if we used it uh recently but I I recall using the book of Nehemiah and how that they had a job to do at the wall and whether at the wall they have a hammer on one hand and a sword in the other and as they're labored on the wall the promise was is anybody attacks you while you're laboring we're going to sound the trumpet and we'll meet him in the battle and we'll conquer him at the wall but whatever you do don't leave the work to go fight the devil in the plane of oh no right the valley of oh no is what it was because there that's not where you're laboring you can't fight a battle where you're where you're not supposed to be laboring as the battle comes you where you're labor and you're in the will of God as Moses came up against the Red Sea he was in the Commandment he was in the order he was doing what God was wanted him to do so when he came up against the Red Sea he had to know God would come on the scene and so we there's you look at this I want to use the word template circumstances in your life where you've seen great victories it's because you found the will of God you humbled yourself to the will of God you asked for his help but where we've seen probably our greatest weak or their greatest failures is when we stepped out of his will and even the smallest of things get us scared and cause us defeat but it's because his will is the most important thing and so Joshua immediately knew something was wrong in Joshua 7 6 it says Joshua rent his clothes and fell on the earth upon his face before the Ark of the Lord until the evening time even tied he and the Elders of Israel and put dust upon their heads this is that humility to recognize something's not right something's wrong and as Josh was calling upon the Lord in verse 10 it says and the Lord Senator Joshua get thee up wherefore Elias thou thus upon thy face and God now is going to be very very specific Israel hath sinned and they've also transgressed my Covenant which I commanded them for they have taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and disassembled also and they've put it even among their own stuff therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies but they turn but turn their backs before their enemies because that's what Joshua's lamenting how is it when does Israel turn their backs on their enemies because they were accursed neither will I be with you anymore except you destroyed the cursed thing from among you can I just put it this way I'm not making commentary on anything that you might find of the world among your own stuff I'm talking about the will of God we have to be doing God's will up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against tomorrow for thus saith the Lord God of Israel there's an accursed thing in the midst of the O Israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until you take away the accursed thing from among you we can't stand before our enemies until we're standing in the perfect will of God because if you're standing in the perfect will of God and the enemy stands there that's your that's your comfort well I'm wearing I'm where he wants me to be so if the enemy's facing me he's either facing me because this is what God wants me to face or he's facing me as a challenge to God's Will and we're like that ain't my battle right we're just looking at this guy saying bruh you picked the wrong fight because I'm just here because God wants me to be here and if you're going to try to move me you got to deal with somebody else and that's when David said the Lord the battle is not mine it's the Lord's what a place to be as Believers when we know in his will I'm doing as well I'm doing this when we were met without position we know just keep doing his will God will fight your battles and Joshua instead of him God the way he kind of rebukes him instead of asking these other questions why when did Israel ever turn their back and run from the enemies Joshua should have been asking did we obey where did we go wrong we did this we did this are we not Sanctified did we do his will are we doing God's Will and he could have realized man I was presuming to go to Ahi to begin with but God was using Jericho to teach Israel a lesson Joshua gets ahead of God's plan but if I could just use it this way and maybe use it as something for us to remember as we go forward Joshua needed to take personal assessment after the victory now take inventory of things the brother Brown talks about it so much people getting caught up in the inspiration and the enthusiasm and Campground cramps and camp meeting stars and whenever things happen we're feeling really good really good really good but we want to slow down say am I doing God's will I don't want to think just because there's enthusiasm just because there's Miracles just because there's signs just because they're wonders I don't just because we're getting the right results Lord am I am I in your word am I doing the things you want me to do and that's what we ought to be doing Lord am I in your will am I doing your will am I obeying your general orders kind of take assessment where where am I take corrective measures on where I am right now in your will so God says this in verse 14 in the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes this is where I want to bring it down to us tonight and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof so they're all to come as tribes and then it was going to narrow down one by when the Lord would identify that tribe that was now kind of like no it's going to be here it's kind of like like DNA testing right we've got certain markers we know it's here and now it's getting more precise more precise more precise and it says in the tribe which Lord take a shall come according to the families thereof and the family which the Lord shall take shall come by households and the householders the Lord shall take shall come Man by man and that's the way we want to start as Believers as for me and my house we come Man by man verse 16. so Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes the tribe of Judah was taken and he brought the family of Judah and he took the family of the Tsar Heights and he brought the family of his All rights Man by man and zabdi was taken and he brought his household Man by man if it got I could say this that at the end of the day the responsibility didn't rest on Judah it didn't rest on the family didn't rest on the household it rested on the individual and for us I believe our greatest strength are those who are here as individuals that Arizona believer's Church isn't your strength it's not your protection it's not how you know that you're right and say bless God we know our ABCs or however we want to look at it that's not it the strength of this church are the individuals that make it up and the individuals that are leading their families that are part of this church so we all now at this moment I share this with you at the close of this series that what we want to do is we want to take inventory Man by Man head of household individual by individual Lord it is my responsibility to follow in your will it's not anybody else's responsibility and Lord I want to do your will and I want to come Man by man before you and say Lord search my heart see if there be anything that I'm not doing that I ought to be doing anything I'm doing that displeases you and I believe that each one of you individually can hold yourself accountable to the Lord and then what I would pray for you is that God would put you somewhere where you have the kind of Believers around you that not only hold you accountable to God's will but give you the resources that you need and the strength and encouragement that we need in a dark time like this to stay in his will and find the next step in his will and we promise as a church to do that for one another can you say Amen that we promise us as Believers as fellow Believers in a dark time and a terrible time in a trying time that we make this commitment to one another that I'm I'm with you we're here for you this isn't a popularity contest this isn't a accumulate assets contest this is a Rapture that we're wanting to see this is staying in God's Will and we're here for one another to support one another and I want to be faithful as a pastor to preach a word that provides you the resources to stand before God Man by man and be found faithful and keep these things in mind and in your heart as you do the will of God that there's many scriptures and stories in the word that we can use as an analogy of staying in his perfect will and I believe that we know the year in preview and we know God's will for us
