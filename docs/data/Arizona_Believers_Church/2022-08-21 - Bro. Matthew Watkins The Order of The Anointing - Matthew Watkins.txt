TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Matthew chapter 16 I'm going to title this the order of anointing the order of anointing the FES also with the Sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven isn't it amazing that everyone needs a sign everyone needs proof need a physical something I could put my hands upon something I can prove something I can scientifically measure and monitor and I could and and if I could just have proof isn't it amazing that's how people are well if you'd be honest that's exactly how you are that's exactly how I am he answered and said unto them when it is evening so notice here this is now prophecy it's not just him Jesus answering these men these Sadducees and Pharisees but now is going to go to something prophetic notice he answered and said to them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh you Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but can you not discern the signs of the times a wicked now here's the prophecy and I believe this is for Our Generation would TR go scripture has compound meaning and so it would be true in the generation that Jesus speaks it but it would have an ultimate of fulfillment or a climax in the end time or as Jesus says in the evening time can you say Amen am a wicked and adulterous generation seeks seeketh after a sign isn't that amazing so there would come a wicked and adulterous generation and one of the signs of that generation would be they would seek proof right and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas it's amazing Jonah didn't know when he was in the belly of a whale wrapped in seaweed he was fulfilling his tribulation was fulfilling a Messianic prophecy of Jesus going into the Earth for three days and he left them and departed Matthew 26 we'll just turn there and have you read before you're seated Matthew chapter 26 amen verse 31 we'll just begin reading love to hear those Bibles the rustling of the leaves amen this morning Matthew chap 26:31 let's read it together then SE Jesus unto them all you shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad let's just pray Lord we give you thanks for you are good and your mercy endures forever from generation to generation Lord how men can make that their testimony your mercy your grace endureth forever we're thankful Lord for that promise here this morning knowing god Lord that in our own human ability we stand with no kind of enticing words or knowledge Lord I don't have anything here this morning that would be in maybe some way would intellectually impress anybody Lord but I've got your word and I put my confidence in that this morning Lord for these people that are gathered these are your children Lord every single one of them didn't come here they didn't come here Lord for a ill purpose or a negative reason Lord but everyone that's gathered here Lord they came to church this morning because they wanted to commune with you Lord and so I pray that you would come and move remove all obstacles remove any hindrances Lord God and may we just be caught up now in a supernatural realm Lord where you can deliver your thoughts Lord in your word to the hearts of your children how we need it Lord how we need you how we need your word how we need it to be fresh and real to our lives Lord I pray that you would help us may you bless brother Aaron Lord and the family as they are away Lord on vacation Lord I pray that you'd give them rest may you renew their strength Lord I pray God for each and every single person Lord that's here maybe some sick in body maybe not feeling well Lord I pray I pray you'd touch them great physician Lord I pray that you would set the captives free Lord answer the prayers of your children we ask we pray Lord all these things in your name amen amen you can be seated this morning I want you just to continue looking at this with me in Matthew chapter 26 and I'm going to uh just read some of these uh verses here and we'll reference them and come back to them but just keep keep your Bible open in Matthew chapter 26 and just read this uh uh as we read this notice what he says here in Matthew 26 and we just read the first verse but after verse 32 but after I risen again I will go before you into Galilee Peter answered and said unto him though all men should be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended Peter what a faith what a boast what a bold declaration that Peter makes and we could say Manet it's so zealous Peter's here the Lord saying I'm going to be betrayed and Peter says though everybody Lord is offended and though everybody walks away from you and though everybody rejects you Lord I will never be offended in you I would venture to say brother Peter was very sincere when he said this I actually would to go further and say that Peter believed what he was saying this wasn't just some put on or hype or caught up in the moment but Peter really truly out of his the bottom of his heart he was declaring this and he says Lord though everybody be offended uh the Peter said though all men shall be offended verse 33 because of thee yet I will not be offended Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that this night before the Crow Thou shalt deny me three times Peter said unto him though I should die wow now he's really going far though I should give my life though I should die Lord I I I I I I'm I'm so connected I'm so a part of you I'm so not ashamed of you I'm so going to stand for you though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee likewise said all of the disciples and if you were there you would have said the same thing and if I was there I would have said the same thing notice here in in in in Luke chapter 22 just turn flip over to Luke chapter 22 notice what happens here in Luke 22 we're just going to pick this up uh let's just start at verse 53 when I was daily this is Jesus with you and Matthew records the same thing but Luke just gives it a little more detail when I was daily with you in the temple you stretched forth No Hands against me but this is your hour what an amazing statement and the power of Darkness so the word has an hour that it must be betrayed the word I'll say that again has an hour where it must be betrayed there's a generation there's a time when it must be accepted and masses follow it and masses and multitudes come for the fishes and the Loaves and the hillings but Jesus recognizes this is not that hour this is your hour to manif EST who you are he says this is your hour notice here then they took him and brought him to the high priest verse 54 and Peter followed a far off when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were sat down together Peter sat down among them but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said this man was also with him and he denied him saying woman I know him not and after a little while another saw him and said thou are also of them and Peter said man I am not about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he's a Galilean verse 16 and Peter said man I don't know what you're talking about how dare you identify me with this notice what a contrast between just in Matthew just a few verses before I'll never deny I'll Never Walk Away what happens to Peter what happens to his faith can I just get you to look at this rationally with me here what happens to this man who is so sincere and just zealous before the Lord and he's Lord I'll never leave you I'll I'll never I I'll I'll never walk away from you notice what brother brandham says here and I guess I don't have control so that's fine you can just Advance the slide notice what brother brandom says here in the first he says see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing there's my title the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the soul is dark as pitch right the cockabur grows on the same water puts life into the wheat puts life into the Cocker but at the bottom of the Cocker it's a cocko bir life it's rejoicing and blooming and got life and doing everything that the wheat does follow it's doing everything right that the wheat does it's doing everything that the that the that the wheat does it's blossoming and blooming got life but the soul of it it's a Cocker see FSE teachers can rise teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but by the word here that's what does it see what I mean amen so brother Brandon would stand and we're going to we're going to cover this here this morning he would stand and he would identify a ditch on this side and he would identify a ditch on this side and he would say that you can so know the word intellectually in your mind and you could so read the word and scholarly academically can understand it say brother man is that wrong that's not wrong now that's where a lot of people's going wrong is they've called that wrong that's not wrong it's good to know the word it's part of the Gospel to know the word brother Bron when he'd identify this ditch he would say now I'm with Calvinism as long as a calvinist stays with the Bible but when the calvinist leaves the Bible I'm not with the calvinist anymore I'm an Armenian as long as he stays with the Bible but when he leaves the Bible I leave the Armenian ISM right so he says in this did you have knowledge and intellect and you know the word and you he says but to know him to not to know his word is life but here's the middle but to know him is life it'd identify this man over here in this ditch a Pentecostal fanatic and he'd say now he thinks it's all an emotion and because of what he felt in his flesh or in sensation that he jumped or he danced or chills went down his back or he spoke in tongues and he says now that's true all of that comes with it right but if you take it so far it becomes a ditch on this side or a ditch on this side and I want to stay out of ditches can you say Amen notice here he says that's what does it see what I mean trying to do God a service without his will he says see that's what does it see what I mean so notice this here Peter's faith comes to this point to where under pressure under the right circumstance or we could say under this right squeeze and the right conditions suddenly that faith that was so boisterous and loud and jumping and shouting or or puffed up in knowledge whatever it was couldn't hold Peter when pressure came under pressure words only take you so far right can you say amen amen so words are good it's important that the redeemed of the Lord say so but but really emotion's good it's good that we feel him in our flesh I love it when the Holy Spirit comes and I feel the breezes of Calvary and you begin to feel the anointing of the Holy Spirit I love that but it must not stay there it must go deeper and contact a realm where the real you is located and it's not in your intellect of what you learn it's good to learn but it must not stay there it must go go deeper it must go past an intellectual experience or an emotional experience and it must be the word transforming you on the inside now I know brother Aaron's got such a good Ministry and Teaching Ministry and I I and I and I'm he's a just a great person I've went to with to brother Aon many times we've had such good fellowship and he's help me in many situations see something and and so I know you're well taught here so I don't need to and maybe in other places I would need to cover a lot of ground and foundation so I just trust you're with me this morning and so it must go it must go further than that it's important as we said to have an understanding it's important on this ditch it's important to have a feeling it's important to feel God it's important for the redeemed of the Lord to say so it's an it's important to know him to know his word right yes you see it always starts there I can say that this morning it always starts in the flesh you say well you're just in the flesh well it always starts in the flesh I almost titled this message from your head to your heart it always starts in the flesh you always start everything that you do you start up the worship service uh a brother came up here and he led songs and he's singing and musicians start to play and they're using physical hands and physical instruments as far as I seen now was the brother not using his hands to this morning playing the piano he was just so caught up in a spiritual realm he was just watching it was was that what happened when I was in the back office come on be honest the brother was up here leading songs he was raising his hands you were raising your hands what is it it always has to start in the flesh it always starts with a with a subset of something but the prayer is is to say Lord don't let it stay there the reason we're in the flesh is to enter beyond the Flesh and move into a dimension where the Holy Spirit drops in the building and he deals with hearts I started this sermon speaking to you but an anointing is here right now to where the Lord takes over the service and he starts to discern hearts and discern minds and he says things that weren't even on my notes what is it it's the Holy Spirit taken control because I started with something and then the Holy Spirit took over oh what did had he right do it was important for her to verbally say that's nothing but the truth brother brandom what was it it was something she was doing that God was requiring in the flesh but the prophet said when she spoke those words it moved heaven and brother brandham says sister hadie whatever you ask right now God will give it to you what was it she started somewhere brother Brandon picks up a rock and throws it up in the air and he said a little Whirlwind just begin to spin it broke the atmosphere and when it landed that that tornado that hurricane that that Cyclone it nearly sunk Alaska right I hope you're getting what I'm saying here it must start somewhere Jesus says he that calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved so what is that that's something that you're doing in the flesh it's something that you're saying it's a physical something that you do we don't just sit here on and absorb right right brother Brandon says Paul saw it come in a way of worship that excluded the leoty and the Holy Ghost Ministry and the best we can see today as a few ministers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it brother bam says this is a far cry from what Paul said when all come together in a building and a church and a gathering all participate in spiritual worship right so notice the man speaks in tongues and brother rham is confused he he's so in admiration of this gift that he sees and the man's just speaking and the man interprets and brother bam goes outside and Shak his hand and the prophet says when I touched him he breaks into vision and realizes this man who was just speaking in tongues is living with a woman that's not his wife and he says what and brother benam says it so bothered him he goes to his cave he's praying he's saying Lord How could a gift how could this man operate such a true gift and what he said here's an interpretation it comes to pass and he's living in adultery and the the the Holy Spirit takes him to Hebrews 6 and says for the the rain falleth on the just and the unjust the same rain that Waters the tears also water the wheat both of them Rejoice together the wheat and the cocko bird does the same exact thing right that's why the prophet would say this you could cry real tears and it not be the Holy Spirit at all uhoh come on he says you could cry real tears David he brother B uses that reference to David was rejoicing said everything that looked like a Revival but God wasn't in it at all so the believer doesn't come notice what he says here was when Peter when Peter comes to this point and says I don't know him Lord I he comes from one point Lord I'll never deny you I'll never walk away from you and now he's his his faith is Shipwrecked I don't know him I don't know what you're talking about and the Bible says he curses now what happens was he a making believer come on no Peter was a real believer really believed intellectually he believed in his mind he believed in his eyes he believed was he an unbeliever no he was a True Believer with an anointing on his flesh but not in his soul Luke chapter 22 we just read it notice what James chapter 2 says I want you to turn James chapter 2 this all right this morning verse 19 notice this thou believest very familiar I'll wait for you to get there James James chapter 2 just have that ready and brother if you could be ready also when I ask for the slide brother John notice what he says here in James chapter 2 verse 19 thou believest thou believest that there is one God I'm going to just hold for just a moment thou believest that there is one God how many believers do we have here today that would raise their hand and say I believe there is one God James says Thou doest well thank you James the Devils also believe I was feeling really high up here and now I'm like wait a minute hold on I'm I'm right with the devil right thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe that word here in the slide this word is pisto and you could display that for me this is what it means it means to think to be true the Devils also believe to be persuaded of to give credit place confidence in of a thing believed to credit to have confidence in a moral religious reference mere acknowledgment of some fact that's an important word today or event mere acknowledgement of some fact or event intellectual Faith the the the you believe in God thou doest well the Devils also pistu they also have faith to this level they also believe they also UST to a thing to one his Fidelity to be entrusted with a thing let me tell you something the devil believes the message of the hour as much or more as you want to say that you believe the message of the hour there's been many people who's left the message I promise you there's not been one demon or one devil that has created a website denouncing the message of the hour there's not been one you go to the good www.google.com and try to find it there's not been one devil that has ever left the message they believe it that that that I can promise you no devil has ever questioned uh the the the Vindication of God's Prophet no devil ever did I mean it'd be almost like me like me questioning you know Mike Tyson and if we never had videos of Mike Tyson of his of his punches or his Knockouts and all we had was a radio in those days and all we could do is hear and listen and you could hear the crowd and oh Mike he hits him with the left oh he's down all we had was just uh audio sir audio cliets of Mike Tyson's fights it'd be like me getting up here Generations later and saying you know what guys I mean I get it that Mike was good but really was he really all that I mean Luke I think think I could have took Mike come on I mean I I think I I mean really Mike wasn't all that I mean come on I mean I think I I think really you talk about Iron Mike I mean I don't know guys I don't think you know that'd be one thing for me to say it but you have the YouTube top 10 Knockouts of Mike Tyson put up one of his I won't call them opponents I'll call them victims put up one of his victims behind this pull pit and let him testify about Mike's uppercut amen now you laugh but put up a demon Spirit of cancer and let him testify you about the ministry of William brandham let a demon of tuberculosis or heart trouble or nervousness testify about the Vindication of the ministry of God's Prophet you'd get a very different reply or story than what you get today can you say Amen so the Devils also listen to what listen to what some of these men said no notice the next slide forgot I had it here notice this is just what some of the witnesses said you can go past that to the the next one I think oh you don't brother John I sent you I always do this to Brother John I sent you an updated one more recent than that do you have it can you try to get it amen just just try to try to grab it try to grab it see if you got it I got a confirmation there will be no Liars in heaven and there will be no wires in heaven and it won't be Wireless either that won't be anything like that so notice here the devil's also believe to have confidence in to have trust to have faith in to give c credit to notice how far this goes to have credit this is the word here he says the Devils also believe and tremble so there's the two SIDS they intellectually and emotionally believ in God but is a devil saved is he redeemed is he born again notice here uh well it didn't come through all right that's fine I'm just going to read him you can hold that up there I want to read you what some of the witnesses some of the some of the some of the men said around brother bram's Ministry this is the house that the Lord built Gordon Lindy and I they have it there but it's you just have to I'm going to read it to you I I I something came through wrong notice just listen never had we known of any preacher calling deaf mutes and blind people to pray for and then to see those people delivered on the spot a Ministry that was beyond any that we had before witnessed James Morris in the book the preachers you can go to the next slide it was brandom I'm going to read you a quote it was brandom more than any other evangelist who started the postor war II fundamentalist hilling Revival following his Encounter With An Angel on May 7th 1946 word radiated in every direction that all manner of diseases and afflictions were healed instantly by the little Indiana preacher even cases of raising the dead were published this is in the William Brandon memorial service notice what it says here God has chosen diverse and mysterious ways to reveal himself to his servants especially those called for dispensational purposes as was brother branham's call in short the man we know is William brandham was to demonstrate God again in flesh FF Bosworth you know very well Christ the Healer when the gift is operating brother brandham is the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the holy spirit in the spiritual realities of any person I have ever known Morris cell and wind over the 20th century God called this humble man and anointed his ministry to a degree that within a few short years his name was known in the most remote jungle out station wherever you would go in this world you would find that the name of this messenger has preceded you for gospel businessman men's voice Magazine February 1961 in Bible days there were men of God who were prophets and seers but in all the sacred records none of these had a greater Ministry than that of William brandham of a prophet and Seer of God whose photograph appears on the front cover of this issue of Full Gospel uh Full Gospel men's voice brandom has been used by God In The Name of Jesus to raise the dead now what Facebook ad for a local event that's coming to you have you ever read coming in October is a minister we're going to bring in and he's going to raise the Dead wow yeah what Ministry come on what BR what man do you know I see all kinds of healing Revival I see all kinds of charismatic see all kinds of men great men not diminishing any of their Ministry but what other Ministry do you know what other advertisement do you have for a man come into your town to come and raise the dead so as we said here they the the devil had an intellectual head knowledge so it starts there Peter says I'll never deny you pressure comes and pressure says oh I believe in it I believe in it I believe in it I believe in it I stand with it I'm identified with it I I I I I'm going to it's important listen to me friends to say you're identified with it and to submit yourself to it is two different things I he in a man the other day and he was saying you know you get resumés and of these men he said you know you you ask you know questionnaire do you believe the message of the hour I do with all my heart you believe Malachi 4's fulfillment I do with all of my heart you believe that there's not three Gods there just one God I believe that not a trinity I oh I brother I believe that with all that's within me you believe that we have a fulfillment of Luke 1730 the ministry of William brandom brother I believe that with everything that was with that's within me and he said now some of you would make that man your pastor but I just read you the resume of Lucifer feel good [Laughter] right you see brother brandham says to the true evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to accept the message or the word for your day to believe the message for your day now there's very different in saying you believe something and your life submitting itself to that right hope that's clear enough you say brother Matt what does it mean a true evidence that you've never been born again is that you don't accept the word for your day but is the evidence just to say you believe it no that's not that that doesn't mean listen don't confuse and I'm I'm going to say this in the the way that I wrote this because it's it's so important to believe that so you say brother man I've got something so don't confuse the something with with with the person in other words don't confuse the gift with The Giver right so even if you move even if you say something you've got to move from intellect and you've got to move from emotion to True revelation we know that's what brother bandam says true faith is a revelation Deus believed followed Paul's Ministry but there came a point in deus's life where he looks at Paul and says you know what Paul's just washed up now brother Bram says Deus wasn't a hypocrite wow de wasn't a make believer he seen the really Revival watched the healing but you know it's so easy to accept Paul when he's renowned and everybody loves him and everybody accepts him and you say I believe it it's so was so easy to follow Jesus when the multitudes were following him when the fishes and Loaves and miracles and blind eyes and Deads being raised it's so easy to believe and follow him when he's accepted by the masses oh but how much a very different thing when he's rejected I stand I'm identified I believe it yeah so does everyone else right now I I believe it with all of my heart yeah so does everyone else they they believe it also but watch what happens when Jesus doesn't becomes so unpopular because of the word he preaches unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with with me the Bible says many of them said this is a hard saying what was it what is that mean that means intellectually there was a there was a a a a a crisis intellectually that's doesn't it goes in and it doesn't come out it unless I eat his flesh and drink his blood I have no part many of them that walked with him walked with him no more could you imagine had you been there and there was a 100 people in that church and and I'll make it bigger than that let's say there were 500 people in that church you say oh boy 500 you know in the message our churches are 25 probably 25 people would be an average size Message Church man you got 200 you got a big church you got 500 you got a message mega church notice here Jesus says now not what would you do had you were in that crowd and out of a out of a 100 people 88 people get up with their families grab their children grab their belongings and they walk out right and everyone's leaving now he's not popular anymore I can't I no brother H that's just a little too far for me I mean was okay for a while but my goodness you people are weird it's just odd that's doesn't fit rationally intellectually in my mind I just can't go that far honey let's go let's go get the kids let's go and everyone gets up and walks out and everyone's leaving and ushering and everyone's leaving and you're sitting there and you're watching as this person and this person is leaving not one at a time but a mass is leaving and then you hear the door shut and Jesus looks up and says hey what what are you doing here what are you doing here to whom would I go Lord amen do you imagine that's the Revelation that's sunk in their heart you alone have the words of anything that doesn't make sense here but something in here that's the only thing I found that resonates with inside of me it's the only thing I have that I know in the whole world is true though none go with me still I'll follow though the world turn its back on me still I'll Stand you say was it going to be you and your intellect no your emotion no but an anchor of Revelation that Jesus says the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that it's amazing that I'm just going to turn a corner here and and we're just going to just going to turn a corner because I just feel led to it don't had a Direction but we'll turn it's amazing when we use this word truth truth is an absolute standard we could read the definition of it truth is the absolute standard by which reality is measured truth in God's view on any subject situation question or idea so let me just say this to you this morning pilate asks a question and says what is truth Jesus is standing in front of him and he's asking this question what is truth now this is a wrong question the right question pilot is who is truth because truth is not an idea it's not something you learn academically or a scholar teaches you or or you you learn by your intellect or rationale or reasoning but truth is a person who is personally revealed to you individually not as a group but truth is something that's communicated divinely to a person and Jesus says the gates of hell can't Prevail Flesh and Blood didn't teach you that Peter but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed it to you and the gates of hell can't Prevail against that so truth is not what scholar is is pilot asked the question what is truth what is it it's not about what it's about who is truth amen you see truth is not what you learn even pilate did you know that hundreds for hundreds of years there was no physical proof that this this man pilot you read about in the Bible ever existed and for hundreds of years you imagine that person brother help me what what's wrong brother I just found out gole Google Google says there's no such a person as pilot and it's shaken my faith what do you mean brother I I Googled it brother Matt there's nothing there hundreds of years this is what people believed until one day in 1962 archaeologists uncover a site and they uncover incription in a in a in a pillar an inscription of pontis pilot now I wonder what happened to that person as they suddenly have the evidence oh now I'm a Believer I can believe it now but what happens when maybe a hundred years later they say that actually wasn't Pilot's inscription and you see where the facts go when a person says you got to have facts well whose facts are we talking about facts is not something that you intellectually academically learn but see to the real believer you didn't need an inscription of pilot you didn't need archaeologist to tell you that pilot ever existed because you met the author of the book you met the man who wrote about pilot and he's been revealed to you and so you accept his word so it's not let me just go further and say truth is not what I say it is no matter how dogmatically I can sound this morning no matter how loud I raise my voice about a Doctrine and what is the truth that doesn't make it true doesn't make it true just because a person says that and they could they could intellectually get you and and they could they could uh you know rationalize it with you and suddenly ah I get it 2 + 2 equal 4 and it must be it and I can see that it was adultery in the beginning it was in an apple and and oh I understand all these things listen to me friends brother Baron makes a makes a statement and I don't have the quote here but I'm going to quote it paraphrase it for you he says you can have all of the knowledge of the Revelation and miss the Revelation what a profound statement you could have the knowledge of the Revelation and miss the Revelation so you say brother the Matt what is it the message of the hour ago can I bring it a little bit further the message is not what I say it is right the message is what any man preaches no matter how I got all the truth and I've got the you know I've got the truth and and you got to come to me to get it and it's my Revelation and and I I got the interpretation on what brother randam says now you may have some of it you may have all of it I don't know but that doesn't make it true let me go further and say it's not my interpretation of what the prophet taught it's not my interpretation of what it says of what the truth is let me just give you something the lord gave me the truth speaks for itself the truth speaks for itself and when it speaks it's not in English it's not in Spanish it's not in German it's not a human dialect it's not a chalkboard of what I write out it's a Heavenly language to the heart that only that person can say amen I believe it not cuz Mom said or dad said or the bastard said but God has revealed himself to me right as the message as let me just go further and say the message of the hour was not William branham's message you say you're out on a limb brother man the message of the hour was not William branham's message he was just the messenger with the message from the throne this is why brother brandham says I wasn't the one you have it there on the slide brother John he says I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing in there when he appeared am I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happen as perfect as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's just it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it wasn't the manifestation of the son of man you can go go to the next slide he says it wasn't the manifestation it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing I'm so glad it's unfailing body word of the son of man now you can take that to this ditch or you can take that to this ditch but true Revelation puts you right in the middle of the road John it's no more you say brother the mat the message wasn't wasn't we no no more than the Book of Revelation was John's book it wasn't John's book John didn't write that book John was just the Scribe Jesus was the author the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave un unto him and this is John H this is the testimony of what I heard and what I seen so the truth speaks for itself right can you say amen amen so brother brandom says no no I'm just going to go a little bit past this so what is truth it's the word which is the thought of God expressed it's communicating a language that I can't speak though I use languages to express it but beyond my voice speaking to you the Holy Spirit has a voice and if you hear the voice behind the voice then you hear truth so we we could say this that's why brother Ram says above all else you should pray for Revelation for True Revelation in your life the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against you but you will prevail against them how many believe that here so God is a god of Truth the Bible says the spirit of God is the spirit of Truth the spirit of God is the spirit of truth I am the way the truth and the life so God functions in this I'm just going through this quickly if you just stay with me so God functions only in a realm of Truth whereas evil the Bible calls him the father of Lies so evil functions in distortions and perversions brother Brandon would say to take the truth and distort it but God functions in pure truth so the spiritual battle that you're in today is a battle against lies and Truth or a battle against Satan and the Lord as simple as it sounds so you can have the fact facts and not the truth you can have the gospel the facts of the gospel and not have the gospel itself to know him is life not to to not to know his word listen to what brother Bram says here and you could go to the next slide and he says he says as I've a often said I found two classes of people one of them is fundamental positionally he knows where he is in Christ because the word but he doesn't have any faith in what he's doing he hasn't received the Holy Spirit then I find the Pentecostals many of them has received the Holy Ghost but don't know who they are just like a man who's got money in the bank and can't write a check and the other one can write a check and got no money in the bank on he says if you could ever get those two together if you could get the Pentecostal to realize who he is and come back to the real full word of God with the baptism of Holy Ghost that'll set the world a fire again with a new Pentecostal revivor brother sister that's true listen in the next slide here uh he says some people make the gospel a funeral possession ditch one they go to church and just like it was funeral possession others make it a Frolic did you too some of them just make it a Frolic just a big time to go and play a bunch of music jump up and down on a platform Dance all over the platform down the aisle run sit down and talk about their neighbors some of them thinks that there's the other D some of them think that they ought to stand and say the doxology and the Apostles Creed and so-called keep going I want somebody to show me one thing written there in Apostles Creed I believe the Holy Roman Catholic church I don't I believe in communion of saints that's spiritualism I don't but they're so busy making those things up and they make it a funeral possession it's not notice he comes to the middle it's not a funeral possession and neither is it a Frolic it's a feast and a feast with Christ when the Believers come and die sir is it dead cold dry worship no is it just shouting and jumping like Pentecostals that's part that it is it is intellect it is emotion it's both don't don't do away with either one that's what happens today people want to cut things out why cut things out when God is giving you the whole thing some people cut out tapes we need tapes some people cut out preachers we need preachers some people cut out teachers we need them some people cut out this they cut out that they cut out emotion we need it some people cut out intellect and knowledge we need it no matter what you want to name here today they cut it out let me just say this you need the books you need the tapes you need your Bible you need preachers you need teachers you need to fill the Holy Spirit you need to know his word you need to say Lord I want everything that you want to give me I want to be a recipient of every single bit of it Lord let me make me a vessel that can receive all of it Lord and not just some of it so you can have information notice what brother random says here does go through these listen they're too good to skip over when a man is converted his eyes are set towards Calvary if he's just a little bit nervous if you don't watch him he'll go over to the fanatic side if he's just a little bit scholarly he'll go over to the starchy side but right in the middle of the road is the S sensible Born Again spirit-led endowed Church of the Living God going straight down the road to Christ notice how he says this that's the real coming from both sides one went one way one went the other shows fanaticism or either scholarly and too stiff to Bow you can go to the next one brother John he says that shows scholarly are too stiff to Bow they know more about the word than they know about the author to know the words not life but to know him is life to know him you don't have to be a scholar how many hands would say thank the Lord this is this is so profound I could preach a whole sermon on it you have to be a submitted person you have to be a submitted person so very different and how you live at wherever everybody sees you and everybody hears you and they hear your your your boast and they hear you watch your life it's so very different if you're a submitted person you see saying you believe something and submitting to the to that something is very different when you say you believe the message then you submit to him who the Lord hath sent right not to a man but through the voice of God that came through that man you surrender your ideas I take all of my theories and all of my ideas and all of my opinions and I come subservient to the word that's been revealed through a Vindicated Prophet you see that's submitting yourself Satan believes the word but he can't submit himself to it he says you have to be a submitted person and when you submit yourself to Christ Christ is obligated to F that vacancy that you've poured out on the altar to him he's obligated to his word to do it and he will not fail you the next Slide the Methodist said when we shouted we had it but they didn't the nazarin said when they lived holy they had it but they didn't Pentecost said when we speak in tongues we got it no no no they didn't see see notice the next one God unfolding himself not in Sensations now I want you to remember that word sensation you may think of as just shaking an emotion that sensation is anything on the flesh whether it's your mind intellectually your body speaking in tongues not in Sensations yet is with it and I love this you see the place it just gets so humble till anybody can see it if you don't try to put inject your own mind to it and your own thoughts it's God Amen now and then they become a bunch of Fanatics then here's the code formers on this side here's the Fanatics on the other side and here goes the bride right straight through it all calling from both sides God vindicating it as he goes along his word can we go just a little bit further you all right amen am so if you want Victory you've got to have truth not emotion not intellect you've got to have the person if you want Victory so in reality our scope of knowledge is very limited I don't care what subject you're an expert you can be called in a courtroom as an export witness and you could know a subject so well and study it and academically have degrees but really if you were to take all of the knowledge of man and you were to put everybody the greatest Minds we've ever had in all of history it would just be a drop in a bucket of what there is to be known so of what there is if all you see if is what you see then you don't see all there is to see so if all we have is what we see we really don't see because it's spiritual it's an invisible battle and so let me just say this I want the truth I want the whole truth and I want nothing but the truth help me God to have the truth as Jesus Jesus says no sign will be given except the sign Jonah so notice as Peter asked this question who is truth and so it's a question a philosopher if you study philosophy and I do not recommend that you do but if you do you'll notice that there's a there's a there's a constant refrain you hear from Scholars asking the same question what is life what is the purpose what is the meaning who am I what is real what is truth that's the question that they ask about religion one religion claims that there's only one God and then another religion claims there's 30 million Gods go study Hinduism and we're arguing over one or three and they believe in 30 million Gods so one says there's one one says there's three there's denominations all different interpretations and so pilot asks the same skepticism that many people today have what is truth how do you know how how do you find out who who really is the Arbiter of where can you go to to to find truth that the the answer was standing 10 feet in front of him that's right on the reality was the truth was right there but he's looking everywhere and the truth the Bible says even nature itself testifies and screams out to a living God brother bam says even the trees testify of the death the burial and Resurrection all of Nature and so the answer to this Jesus says I am the truth but there's a reason why that claim was so hated and unaccepted by masses talk about some isms today let me look at them if you have the slide the very first one rationalism so if you had asked the apostles or anyone in the book of Acts what they would have is a simple answer for you if you were to ask them what is truth God's word Jesus is truth no one questioned God's word uh and it was during the Reformation that people rose up and said you know TR truth truth isn't what the church says or decrees listen I mean truth truth isn't what the word what your Bible says but truth is what the church says and Men rose up and said no the truth is what the word of God says right then a few hundred years go by and there was a great shift in our world we call it the enlightenment I like to call it the endarkenment CU really that's what it was thank God for the enlightenment I don't I make a I'm joking but thank God we have modern medicine and things but really the enlightenment really was the darkening of man's mind that's why brother Brandon would say the further you move towards civilization and education the further you go from God that's right right true now now we live in an imperfect world and you've got to have education you've got to have science You' got to thank God for medicine but he says the further you go the further you go to to to science and education the further you go so the shift in our generation was truth is no longer it's no longer what what what God tells us but truth truth can't be truth isn't what the word says truth is what I discover it's what I find out I'm a human mind and I can find out for myself I can use critical thinking love that word I can love critical thinking God gave you a mind common sense and so we can find it out and to put it simply human reasoning and rationalizing replaced revelation of Jesus you no longer accepted what the word taught because it taught it but you thought it through for yourself you use your own thinking and and Truth is what I think it's the heart of listen that's the heart of rationalism it's what I rationalize it makes man his own God he could discover Truth for himself what was the prophecy of the generation you and I live in men shall become lovers of their own self they stand in the mirror and they say oh I'm so beautiful I just love me just look at me no it's not what it is it's man shall become lovers of their own self what they can learn what they can reason with what they can rationalize what they think I read a bumper sticker that says don't believe everything you think but they've so exalted the man's mind has been so exalted in education it's what I learned it's no longer accepted it's it's it's what I it's it's it's it's it's what I discover for for myself that's what's truth I don't I don't need you know I could use men I could use God I could use the Bible but I'm going to discover it with my own mind God gave me five senses and you know what that opened the door for science it's wonderful open the door for Science and Discovery and observation of what is true and so it it's scientific discovery let me say this most scientists original scientists believed in God they weren't atheist most original scientists you look at cernus and and and and men men like Isaac Newton these were men who believed in God the first scientists believed in God can you say Amen so science would believe in what he can learn Galileo believed in God uh bacon and cernus these were men who believed but notice Watch What Happens in that shift when they start to go towards education now there comes a question and it leads to them what we have our next ism is deism and deism is the belief the belief in the existence of a Supreme Being specifically of a Creator but one who doesn't intervene in the universe he created the term is used chiefly of an intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th century that accepted the existence of a Creator on the basis of reason but rejected belief in a supernatural deity who interacts with humankind it means God created the world but he doesn't control control the world it's just like a clock that he winds up and then he sits it down and it just sort of goes at its own pace he has no control uh over over it's like a watch that's wound up and can't be altered and and and and and and according to it it acts according to its own laws so while believing in God many of the scientists believe that God himself couldn't change nature can't control the order of nature so they give their minds to discovering the laws of nature and they became so proud of their own Discovery and by reasoning we became people in charge of our own Universe in order in other words the authority of human reasoning took over from the authority of divine revelation and this introduced the age of skepticism it's one that's prophesied in the Bible Skeptics would arise saying where is the promise of the father since our fathers have fallen asleep all things remain as they were right it's this age of skepticism that's prophesied also in Jude and so people never don't people don't just believe a thing because they're told they want to find out for themselves whether it's true whether whether really what they what they want to find out is does it appeal to my logic does it make sense to me you see that's what the problem when you lack a revelation of election and when you lack the revelation of the Plan of Redemption and when you lack the Revelation not of history but of his story and when you lack that view of time in the timeline then intellectually it doesn't work and that's why Jesus said God says through Isaiah for my thoughts are not your thoughts the word in other words what what he's saying here is I don't think like you think we don't even think on the same sphere so don't try to relate what you see naturally uh with How could a God who loves how what you're really saying is is I couldn't do that I wouldn't do that but God says as high as the heaven is from the earth so high are my thoughts above your thoughts we don't even think the same many times the way God viewing us is viewing a situation is entirely different than how I look at it right and so people know they appeals to their logic you know it's tragic it's very tragic when a man can only believe in the things that he sees intellectually it's a tragic thing when we can only believe that which can be intellectually proven or what let me say it even greater it's a tragic thing when a person can believe only in what they understand let me say this you'll never fully understand God or his word he's Everlasting and brother brandom says in the ceaseless ages to come he'll be revealing himself amen amen my brain just goes in fact what happens is the result of rationalism is that we become with the creation and we we become exalting of the created things or the things that we see and we forget the Creator as the Bible says they became vain in their own imaginations they worshiped the creation more than the Creator they became vain what does that mean it means intellectually that that they look at themselves say oh I'm I'm something I found something out I really I've really learned something this is what brother brandom stood against when you hear him talking about intellectual sermons and intellectual people it wasn't that intellect or knowledge is wrong is that they so exalt what they found or what they've discovered and they reject the revelation of God's word I can't understand it so it can't be true or no you got to explain it to me and if it understand and it makes sense and now go okay got it understand I remember in China there for a missionary trip and dealt with a kept uh ministered a sermon to a church women where there were two women pastors Lord opened their eyes showed them the message of the hour that they were in dresses and they came to me afterwards and said pray that God sends us a man to lead this church and in that sermon a little w a woman college student maybe in her 20s very not not didn't speak spoke perfect English she was Chinese by her appearance but she was born in America and very well educated she was going to college in Switzerland and I made a comment she said sir she said I just want to ask you a question because they had witnessed to her and brought her in she he said you said that the beginning in the beginning uh of the Garden of Eden it wasn't an apple it was adultery she said did you say that right I saides ma'am she said you said that right I said yeah she said I've never heard that before she said that's not what my church teaches I are you where are you getting that from is that that's not in the Bible I said we didn't have time I said 'why don't you do this and I told the brother I said' come back here and the Believers were all gathered I said' let's have us sit down with this sister and let's talk to her so we had met later that afternoon and she came she was very sincere she came and she sat down we had a round table maybe 10 or 15 Believers and they were all there and there was she was there and she had her Bible and she had her notes and her paper and she's like okay I'm ready I want to I read this I said now hold on a minute I Saidi want you to do me something I want you to do me a favor I said you see I could go through all of these scriptures and I could show you and I could try to train you and teach you and and you may see it and you may not see it and you may maybe and I said but you know let me just say this if what I'm speaking is true then the Lord has to reveal that to you am and I said I want you to pray before we start I'm not going to pray you're going to pray we're going to pray with you I said I want you to pray and I want you to ask the Lord and I want you to say Lord if what this man is saying is false if it's a cult if you don't if this is something that's a false Doctrine it's a heresy then Lord deliver me from this man amen and I said but I want you to pray but Lord if this is something that you want to reveal to me Lord then open my eyes and she said Okay Lord Jesus and she started to pray pray that same prayer open my bible take her to Genesis we go to First John we go all over showing her H Cain who was of that Wicked Wine and showed her the scientific evidence of twins being born from one man and and all of that and the whole time she's uhhuh um okay oh wow never seen that before hold on let me read that I had to read the scriptures and she's oh my she's writing notes and and she's coming through and we're sort of getting to the tail end of it and I take her from Cain who was of that Wicked one Oh you mean ah wait a minute he was of that Wicked one couldn't be evil no so who was that Wicked one that Cain was of of his prity of his of his offspring uhuh H and then I said now the last scripture I took over to Proverbs I want you to read it and so she opens her Bible she starts to read I'll never forget it such as the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and she looked straight up and she said such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and she said Lord Jesus I see it Lord you've opened my eyes Lord I see and she stood to her feet and you could watch the revelation of God start falling into that woman and her eyes that were blind could now see what was that it was more than me teaching or training it was the Holy Spirit coming and revealing himself to her and her submitting herself to what God had showed her oh my brother we can raise our children and teach them the truth and we should but we should pray God make it more than a knowledge make it more than what I train them let yourself be revealed to their hearts personally lord it's not what you learn it's not what academically you find out it's what the Lord reveals to you am I can't understand it so it can't be true I I've got to have it this reaction of rationalism is what called the movement the next one of Romanticism also called the Romantic Era Romanticism was an artistic literary Musical intellectual movement it originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850 some of the main characteristics of Romanticism can I have just a few more minutes is this okay so some of the main characteristics of Romanticism literature includes a focus on the writer or the narrator's emotions ah now we've identified one ditch now let's identify the other it's what I feel it it was the celebration of Nature and beauty and Imagination and and a rejection of of of of organized religion and rationalism and social convention it says humans uh aren't just thinking creatures we're feeling creatures we can feel reality and Truth needs to be felt in order for it to be true what is true is what I feel is true why don't you believe that I don't know I just don't feel like it and so there came a desire not just for a scientific explanation but a desire for an experience of things people want to fill it they don't know it's real unless they can fill it that's even the the test some people apply to worship it it's only good worship if I failed it well what if the Lord failed it and you didn't then that's real worship amen I can only enter in when it's real when I can really feel it well what if you don't feel it is he still God what if you don't sense him this morning is he still God is he still the same so you had the cold clinical rationalism which led to science as we said and then we had the Romantic Era which led to arts and the field of arts and painting and music and these were helped to helps to help us feel what's real and to feel reality and people look at the world and they and around us and they want to feel it they want to feel mother nature and they want to become one with it and oh it's an experience spiritualism came out of this if you can't understand let me say it this way it's like people today they they uh you know you have artwork and Modern Art and you have these pictures in this of this nothing and it's this splatter of paint and you think I don't understand it now you've understood it yeah but oh I don't get it now you get it you're getting it you feel it you feel that there been thousands and th if you're into artwork I don't criticize you this morning I'm not but that's okay and so you understand Modern Art because you've UND if you can't understand Modern Art then that means you've understood it because what it saying is the world doesn't make sense it's I look at it and it's crazy it's nonsense if you don't understand modern art or music than you don't than you've actually understood it because how why because I could feel it say brother man is that true it's true both were true remember hello rationalism says truth is what I learn or understand Romanticism says it's what I feel then Jesus steps right through the middle and says I am the truth I am the person it's not truth not the left not the right it's right down the middle of the road and it's not in what you feel it's not in what you learn he's not what you learn he's not what you feel he's truth and unless you have him you don't have truth so both of these isms bring us to the last which is the ism of relativism brother John relativism is what's in our day that's what's truth is not what I feel it's not what I learned truth is relative it's not absolute truth is not absolute it's in simple terms you really can't be sure you can have an opinion that's okay you can have as long as you specify it's just in my opinion in my humble opinion long as you specify and it's my opinion then you don't offend anybody but you try to make an absolute truth man you'll get everybody hating you what are you saying you say what are you what are you trying to say I'm just quoting what Jesus said well Jesus was a man for his time but he's not a man for our time you see the word is culturally conditioned it just means it was right for his culture but it's not really you got to sort of make it an update it brother Matt can't really it's a little archaic and you know the Bible's true I mean I accept the Bible I I believe the truth but you know brother Brandon was in a different era and you got to be real careful because we're different and you know it's a modern age and you sort of it's culturally conditioned you see the way of the world the way that demon Spirits want to water down and water down the message of the hour water down the truth of God's word but let me say this the watered down word will never get you in a Rapture the watered down word will never give it'll give you a religion it'll give you a nice form and you fit fit the attire but it'll never give you the person and I want the person oh you've got to you've got to it's a truth is just a consense all things are relative brother it's you know this is my opinion of the truth and that's my understanding that's my feeling and you know and but you may you may feel differently and you may disagree and you may have your opinion and you know what am I right yes are you right yes we're both right we can both be right why can't we all just get along why can't we all just be friends All Things become relative and and in s such an atmosphere you can't be sure of anything you you know what it is you have no absolute and you've got to have an absolute you've got to have a place you could take down and say this is where I stand this is how I raise my children this is why I live the way that I do it's my absolute it isn't the truth is not a consensus of what everyone believes truth truth speaks for itself in relativism atmosphere there's no such division as truth and true and false and right and wrong it's all not black and not white it's all gray you could never say that's wrong and just one example Islam has 99 names for God father is not one of them because Islam's the Quran states God has no Sons there's not a son he's never had a son yet we believe that God is a father because we are his sons in an absolute age one of those is true and one of those is false but in a relative age everything both of those are true they're just different aspects of Truth but the real question like pilate said what is truth relativist says everything and everyone's right the Bible has been questioned now as the absolute sourth of truth it's regarded as a record of relative truth the Bible as we said it's conditionally cultured it it conditioned it it it means that it's it's a reliable record of those in biblical times how they viewed truth but it's not reliable for me today it may not apply to our culture even Jesus was you know we got it we he was a man of his his time but not really of you know what you know the problem with this lack of true or false in belief is the is the lack and the lack of right or wrong is because that determines how you live and when you have an absolute truth that absolutely controls your life and that life whether it's pleasing to the Lord or not is how you live can you say Amen so it's no longer notice it's clear from the words of Jesus everyone that is of the truth in other words that truth is not something but rather it's someone amen truth doesn't come by scholarship or Superior human intelligence or research because it's a person and that person said no man can come to me except the father draws him first so what do we need brother Matt we need everything the Lord has given us we don't need to settle let me just preach to you just for a minute as I close don't let the devil allow you to settle for for anything less than everything God has don't let him get you in the right ditch and miss the left ditch don't let him get you in the left and miss the right let him put you right say Lord Keep Me in the center of your channel how many could pray that and say Lord let my life be in Harmony and in sync with your word Lord let me surrender and submit myself to whom the Lord have S I don't want to be on one side and then not the other I want to have all the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth amen I want to have a proper understanding Lord let it be in the order of anointing anoint my faith to believe your word anoint My Flesh so that I can worship you in spirit anoint my mind Lord so that I can believe your word and believe your promises keep me from any distortions and let me live in the truth the whole truth could you stand to your feet musicians could you come nothing but the truth Lord that's our prayer could you bow your heads with me every head bowed every eye closed United under one God brother brandham says she said it's good to look at it brother brandham says oh if he can make you reason and out if he can make you think with your mind but God doesn't use a man's head God uses his heart God works on his heart while the devil works on his head God chose the heart the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he the devil uses your eye but when God can come to a man he comes to his heart and he lets him believe things by his heart through faith that his eyes does not see the scripture says faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen see God's working here brother Adams Point to the heart Satan's working here greatest battle ever fought it's happening in reasoning rationalizing listen friend you can't know Truth by uh I don't care if it's an emotional how good it was in ual how good it was and how well you understand it he's got to be revealed personally to you how many could just say Lord I submit myself I Surrender myself I want to be that submitted person and would you reveal yourself to me Lord oh I believe hands up on sincere Hearts all over this church right now saying Lord I want you to reveal yourself not by a preacher not by an emotion not by a workup not by elect but make yourself known to me Lord make yourself to known to my children to my family to my home Lord to my faith to my church Lord that's what we need brother Ram says too many times it pulls from up here when God says anything we don't look at it no more intellectually When God says anything we don't look at it no more intellectually we let it soak right down in our heart and call anything contrary to it as though it wasn't do you need to look at a promise this morning and say Lord you've said it I believe it that settles it I'm not going to look at it anymore I'm going to let it soak right in you're the one who gave the promise you're more than able to keep it he says that's where the world's so tangled today it's so much intellectual preaching instead of Spirit-filled churches worshiping in the spirit they're listening to intellectual messages and you can't reason this out there's no way at all to do it we got the best dressed crowds biggest organization smartest Minister we don't have a use for the holy spirit in that way anymore the way it was back there God our seminaries and brain of their being coming together discussing this thing more able more intellectual to set a church in order better than the Holy Spirit could do it so they don't need it any longer it's something that we don't need today it's the days of the days past we don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the sick we got doctors I'm thankful for doctors friends but we need the Holy Spirit still we don't need him to speak with tongues we're intelligent people when you do that you take right from your framework the lifeline we don't need this we don't need Old Testament prophets to set us in order we understand it and he said they've adopted a man-made system to take the place of the Holy Spirit but there's a people that's elected that has their names on the Lamb's Book of Life are you one of those people today friends he says there's a people that's elected and they can't go for that they're spiritually minded they can't stand for it no matter if their father and mother lived in whatever organizational Church they can't stand for that they stand for the word I want to say Lord Jesus I want to stand for you today Lord I ministered this message here because you Lord instructed me I just am your servant Lord now going to close my laptop Lord your word has went forth and it's a liberating word it's one that sets us free I pray Lord there'd be someone here today that could reach out in faith true faith and could grab a hold of it while it's here grab a hold of it Lord as as that little woman who had that blood issue grabbed the Hemm of your garment and said if I could just touch him if I could just grab a hold of him I pray Lord that someone in faith could reach out with that same faith of that little woman and say through their pain she whispered these words touching Jesus is all that really matters then my life will never be the same oh there's only one way to touch him you must believe when you call on his name Lord we're calling on you this morning we raising our hands Lord this morning in this church mothers and fathers ministers and deacons and Lord those that are listening online Lord may hear these musicians with their heart Lord lifting up their hands to say oh how we need you today Lord in this day age Lord of skepticism and relativism how we need a truth Lord we don't just need doctrine that's wonderful Lord we don't just need a dress code though that's good we believe in that Lord but what we need is the person we need the person to come and live in our lives we need the person to come and preach in our pull pits we need the person to come and live in our young people Lord that's the true Revival it's not the emotion it's the Revival making himself known to your children and with that comes emotion with that we lift up hands with that we raise our voices yes Lord with that we believe your word not because of anything within us or any any part of us that's good but because you placed a seed down inside of us before the foundation of the world and that real us believes this message with all of our heart give us that real something give us that something that takes us past an intellectual Faith as Peter had Lord give us that something that he says Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have have I give unto thee what was it Lord you gave him a deposit an inheritance a down payment and we have it this morning Lord dwelling within us anything we need your Prophet said for this Earth Earthly Journey even the Rapture is inside of us right now may we believe it Lord God more than ever before may we submit oursel to it may we check all of our ideas and all of our own theories and all of our own opinions and all of the things we think Lord our Minds even our own minds Lord are just fragile fra Lord in vanity upon vanity Lord may we check all of our ideas and all of the things that we think and may we submit ourselves one individual could there be a father to say Lord I submit myself to the word that you've spoken oh would there be a mother would there be a young person here that would say Lord I want to surrender and submit myself to him who the Lord has sent Grant it Lord grant it Jesus Grant it Lord
