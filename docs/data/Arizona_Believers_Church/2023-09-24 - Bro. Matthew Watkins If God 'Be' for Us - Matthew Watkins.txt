TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to move through some of this quickly and I just I'm just obeying the Lord this morning and what he would the direction he'd have us go uh just trusting and yielding unto him so just stay stick right with me and if you if you have something that you hear that the Lord really you believe spoke to you well then just amen amen the word of God and clap your hands raise your hands do something but just Identify say Lord I know that was directly for me and Moses said unto the Lord notice this here thou sayest thou thou sayest this is what the Lord said bring up this people this is verse 12 now is not let me know whom thou will send with me yet thou has said I Know Thee by name and thou has also found Grace in my sight so Moses comes to this place in his life and it's a very interesting spot that he gets to the prophet of God tells us at this point he's 80 years old I want you to get a picture of him as a man a beard uh you know hanging hanging down all the way to his waist he's an 80-year-old man and his bald head brother brandham said is shining his hair is around his neck and and he could say Lord I I'm 80 years old uh my back is stiff I I I got arthritis in my hands and I got all kinds of hindrances I I'm not an eloquent man the Lord has called him to something he's equipped him for a job you know most of the time when the Lord calls you to something is when you feel the most inadequate to do what the Lord has told you do most of the time the Lord will wait to call you until you realize that there's nothing in yourself to bring to pass what God has called you for and often times that's when you're the most equipped for the job is when you feel the least equipped for the job and so he could say Lord I'm not an eloquent man I I can't speak very well but the Bible says he comes to this place and the scripture uses this word that he's on Holy Ground I want to say some things to you this morning and and just to just to some principles I could just lay out to you that you know this place that he comes to of Holy Ground is not necessarily a 4x4 square of a place of the earth that we could go find today and stand and say it would be holy but rather I want you to look at it this way that this place he comes to is actually a condition or a a spot in his own life and so he takes off his shoes the God God tells him Moses take your shoes off because the place where you're at the spot you've came to and and the the spot where you're at in your life the current condition this every moment in your life little did Moses know that everything he had went through in his life as a little boy from the time he was born all the way through Pharaoh's house he's in the Nile River and a basket picked up and you know what Moses's entire life and all the events that unfold and you know life is all about a journey and your life is at this point where you're at today on this Sunday morning because you're at a certain spot in your journey some of us at different places different ages different groups different pressures all different kind of circumstances and some of us may be dealing with medical issues this morning I know I'm in a group where we live in bodies that are broken down some may be in financial hardship some may be in marital distress some may be in raising teenagers and I pray for you in a special way if you are and you're at a really tough spot in your life and you're wondering you know Lord but let me just say this the same God that was with you when he found you and he saved you and cleaned you isn't he the same God who's in with you in every spot and journey every Crossroad every pressure every circumstance yeah it may feel like it's getting harder but as it gets harder his grace just gets greater and so he comes to a crossroad this is a spot in his life and you know Junctions in life are a very important thing and God brings to certain certain Junctions and and certain spots in our life you could almost look at it like dispensational changes that happen in your life and and and different spots where you just know that the the rhythm of your life is a little different and something's changed and and that maybe you're at a different season of life and I believe that's how God grows us as by season it's not always a Happy Time Life is actually a life full of trouble and trials and tribulations and and sometimes you're up and sometimes you're down and I don't care so you may kid yourself today and say I'm always up well let me drink what you're drinking because I'll be honest I'm not always up sometimes I'm down sometimes I'm encouraged sometimes I'm discouraged sometimes I feel like I'm success sometimes I feel like a absolute failure to the to to God if I'd be honest this morning I felt God more times than I'd tell you this morning I wouldn't admit it to you how many times but I just tell you I felt him more times than I've pleased him if you'd be honest you'd say Amen but notice I want you to know notice that he gets him to this place it's a certain condition that he brings Moses to it's a certain spot little does he know that every moment in his life up to this point has been made and laid and laid out before him everything he's went through every trial every hardship every circumstance has brought him to this place of Holy Ground prophet of God says he takes off his shoes that's a special thing he takes off his shoes and a sign of humility and he and he says it's a the same place that the Apostle Paul comes to and brother bam says he falls down onto the ground and he kisses the ground as it was Moses takes off his shoe Paul falls to the ground the prophet says John the Baptist uh says I'm not even worthy to to loose the shoes on his feet so what is it speaking of what is this Condition it's a condition of an absolute recognition of self and that there's nothing good within me it's a place he gets him to to where he realizes I'm not worthy to be called I'm not worthy to be here I'm not worthy to be anointed for the job that the Lord has for me Paul falls on his face John says I'm not even worthy to to unloose his shoes prophet of God said what was this place of Holy Ground it was a place of humility well friends if I could just I'm feeling so inspired this morning just for myself if this is for nobody it's for brother Matt this morning but I'm just so struck by the words of God's Prophet when he says I want you to listen closely be conscience of your littleness amen be conscience of your littleness this is where God brings Moses to he's questioning I'm ating my back hurts I've got arthritis God waited till this moment God waited till Abraham was 99 years old you ever follow that 99% it's 99% dead it's 99% over it's pretty much the end of all things is that the very God sometimes brings you to the very Brink and then he brings a change and he says I I'm n I'm 80 years old my back hurts I've got arthritis but the prophet says be conscience of your littleness of who who you are stick your finger in a bucket of water then pull it out and watch it just go back to where it was you'll find the hole that you put your and the water is now gone and and brother brandom says that's you you're nothing when you get to this place to where you realize you'll not be missed after a while they have a funeral for you they'll bury you uh but after a little while you're gone and life will move on and and Seasons move on they'll have a funeral possession but that's the only thing about you the prophet says let me just admonish you this morning the only thing that that will remain as your influence and the impact of your character in your life of the things you stood for of the things that you press for of your passions that's what will make an effect amen not your eloquence not your good looks not your not your gifts not your talents those are all wonderful but they'll soon be over be conscient so he comes to this place of Midian it's incredible journey you could type in the life of Moses as he comes to this place where God has called him and he's anointed him and now Moses is having this conversation Lord you've said you've called me and you said you've chosen me and you you said that I found Grace in your sight but you've not even shown me Lord who's going to go and I'm not an eloquent man and and and he's looking all inwardly and introspectively he's looking at his life but you know God brings him all the way through the Journey and all the way from Egypt and and now he brings him to this spot of Midian and in Midian Moses learns how to be a Shepherd he learns how to be a leader and brother bam says in those 40 years it doesn't record that God did anything for Moses doesn't even record that he spoke to him so it's 40 Years of Silence listen sometimes friends I'll just be honest with you we can label Silence from the devil but sometimes silence is from the Lord and let me say it this way sometimes in the silent moments of your life when it seems like God is doing nothing and sometimes the greatest workshop and the greatest Factory and the greatest building that God and you say I don't feel it I don't sense him I don't hear him take courage today that sometimes God is equipping you for the job that's laying ahead of you and let me say this friends everything you go for is just an equipping for what lays next you ought to grab a hold of that this morning you ought to by faith say I believe that Lord Jesus everything is led up to this point it's it's it's at a it's he's at a place and maybe he doesn't realize that that God is actually equipping him you know before God ever calls you to something he equips you for the job and brother Brandon would say it this way that a life before God ever places a life in the world he anoints that life he anoints it for the job he anointed Samson's life before he was even born he's anointed for a purpose and in fact that anointed in Samson's life never left say well he loved god well he went on sinning the anointing in his life never left because an anointing that God brings is the equipping whether you yield to that or not is up to you but it's an equipping for your life for the job oh my brother my sister I take courage to say Lord whether I feel like it or not you've equipped me for the for the things that are laying ahead of me so Moses says Lord I want you to catch this Lord I I believe what you've said about me you know it's never the problem for a Believer for a True Believer questioning the word you it's never the word that you question it's never the word it's never the promise you don't say I don't you know I just not sure not so sure about that I'm just not so sure I believe that sounds good you know it's never Moses wasn't questioning what God Said a Believer doesn't question it's never the problem questioning the word or what the word has spoke the problem comes down to who the word spoke about because we never as a Believer have trouble believing the word that's what believers do that's what brother brandom said Believers believe that's what they'll do that's what believers do it's never you questioning the word it's you questioning the vessel that the Lord wants to use and so that's where the Log Jam comes from Moses he says Lord I believe the word I believe what you've spoken but but are you sure me Lord me do you know me Lord like I know me are you sure Lord I believe the word I'm not doubting it today I'm not questioning it today but Lord who I'm doubting if I'd be honest I'm doubting me Lord are you sure God I I I I'm not questioning the word today Moses could say uh but I've came to a spot in my life that I've got to know that I know that I know that it's not just something I hear it's not just something the pastor preaches it's not just something I try to mentally accept but I've got to know that I know that I know that there's a that I have found Grace in your sight that you have called me by name that you have have chosen me it can't be Mom or Dad's Revelation I'm asking today I'm at a spot of desperation Lord I want to know that I know that I know that I found Grace in your sight Lord you see it's one thing for you to confess what the word says it's another thing it's one thing for you to confess what the word says about you it's another thing to believe what you confess hello brother bam deals with Georgie the sister at Georgie Carter's church and that one little sister who died died of a pend and he says sister and now brother brandom I believe with all my heart and brother he said sister I can tell you right now you don't believe you hope but you don't really believe there's a very big difference say brother Matt well how do I get that there's only one way to get it God has to reveal himself personally to you and so he's saying Lord I I've just came to this spot in my life I'm not questioning your word I'm not doubting you Lord I'm not questioning your promise Lord but if I'd be honest it's me that's that's where I'm having the trouble is I know what person I am I know who I am I know the failures that I have I'm well acquainted with not the picture I put on at church and not the the you know the image that I give to everybody else but I know myself I know lord inside of me I'm full of fears and I'm full of problems and I'm full of issues and I I'm full of mistakes and I'm full of failures can anybody be honest today say Lord It's not the word that I'm doubting it's it's me Lord It's Me today and I understand he says Lord I've got to find notice this here if you just keep your Bible open Exodus 33 he says Lord I I want to know that you've you've that I've found Grace in your sight you see Moses knew that finding Grace in his sight was more than just hearing it it was more than just seeing it it was more than just knowing as he said the acts but he wanted to know his ways he wanted to be a personal presence in my life notice verse four and God says my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest let me just preach here for a moment friends if you know the presence of God if you say Lord I let let me just say today there's only one thing that'll bring true rest from God there's only one thing that'll really bring real rest to a Believer and that's the presence of God you'll never know rest until you know the presence and friends I'm not talking about an emotion I'm not talking about a goosebump I'm not talking about a feeling those are wonderful to feel the presence of God in your flesh but I'm talking about a knowing that you know down inside of your soul you'll never know the true rest of God until you know the presence of God you can have this Bible you can have a good church you have a good wonderful Pastor one of the best preacher in the message you can have some of the best music you can have some of the greatest gifts you can have some of the greatest talents have some of the best parents in the world but let me just say this you'll never know rest until you know him and it's not in a sermon it's not necessarily in a Bible it's not in a church service but it's him it's it's him and I just stop here today and raise my hand and say I want to know him I don't just want to know about him I want to know him this morning I I want to know him personally down inside of my soul Moses was convinced that without God's presence in his life then everything everything all of his ritual all of his dress code all of his cliches all of his speech he realized that if he didn't have the person are you with me here today if he didn't have the person then it was all just a man-made effort to be good or moral or holy it gets to such a place he gets to such a place and he says Lord I know you've called me but I've called you Moses I know you've said that Lord my presence will go my presence will go I know you said my presence will go Moses I I you found Grace and I know Lord Lord I know you said that it was all good it was all great I believe all of it but I want to make sure that today you hear me Lord I want to make sure that you hear what I'm saying to you if you don't go Lord if you don't go then don't even send me amen if you don't go Lord if you don't go Jesus oh can I just preach can I have Liberty this morning let me just say this the presence of Jesus I'm quoting from God's Prophet is the lifeline of the church listen there's a lot of things that'll produce life good programs produce life produces a lot of uh you know stimulation it produces a lot of good people it can give you even of good atmosphere could bring joy and happiness uh good songs and good singing will bring that in your life uh let me just say this but without the presence of the person of the word you can have all your teaching you can have all of your speaking you can have all of your charisma you can have all of the the greatest gifts you can have the greatest preaching you can have the greatest service you can have the greatest things in in life friends but let me just say this today you've got to have him this morning you've got to have the personal person of his presence and I say God let my Christianity be filled with the fullness of the presence of Jesus Christ don't let it be a dress code Lord don't let it just be a lifestyle that I live let it be a reality in my heart oh how many would identify and say Lord I'm in a spot in my life where I could say I'm in desperation I'm done with churchianity I'm done with religion I'm done with cliches I'm done with just a lifestyle I want to know him in the power of his resurrection unless your Christianity has the presence of God this may get Stern but let me just say it the way the lord gave it to me andless your message lifestyle and all of your code and all of your acts and all of your history and all of your home and whoever wherever you came from and how many years you've been here how many years you've professed it unless the presence of a real living God and the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the shout of the king backs up your life then it's nothing more than a manmade effort to be holy can I just be honest friends what do we [Music] have what do we have if we don't have him am see that's so simple brother Matt oh let it let it be simple to you it's profound to me unless we have him in the personal presence unless his anointing and real reality of the Holy Spirit backs up my life and my testimony and my home unless I have the peace that passes all fre you don't have to settle for chaos in your home you don't have to settle for dysfunction in your family you don't have to settle for a home that's disjointed and a home that's fussing and fighting and arguing and stressful and the devil might have sold you that lie but you don't have to settle for it today you can have a peace in your home that passes understanding you can have teenagers you can have a home that's in [Music] order unless you go oh Lord don't even send me say brother Matt then what do you say then I say let the presence of God go with me amen he said if you don't listen to this verse 15 If thy presence go not with me carry us not up h in other words Lord if you don't go I'm not going did you hear me God might have said that real sheepishly the first time and the more he said it he got more Brave I want to make sure you heard me God I want to make sure it's clear if you don't go I'm not going you know in life sometimes we can get to the place to where we're stuck we can get to a spot in our life even in I don't care if you're born of the spirit of God you can get to a place if you'd be honest and throw off your religiosity you'd be honest to say I can get to a place in my in my life with the Lord Jesus to where I'm stuck you know sometimes people can get in a rut and it's the devil's desire to put you in a rut it's that you ever been in a rut ever been I know here if you do any kind of four-wheeling or anything out in the out in the these kind of wilderness you can get in a rut really quick and that tire would just Spin and spin man you could have all the the gasoline you could give it all the gas and you know sometimes the more gas you give it the further down you go and the more energy you put behind it the deeper in the Rut that you sink and the more you try to build it up and the more you try to Pump It Up and the more you try to pep it up and you try to move it listen friends that's not how the holy can I just say today that's not how the holy spirit moves it doesn't move by a work by some working something up he doesn't move he doesn't move because we chant or that we we try to we listen friends God's God only moved based upon one thing there's a repentant heart that's in desperation for the Holy Spirit am and you get stuck in your life now listen I'm just obeying the Lord here this morning you get stuck in your life you get to a place to where you're just you're not going anywhere you're not really going backwards you you're not really going forward you're sort of in that Circle you know just that roundabout of life you ever been in that just that roundabout you know sort of like the roundabouts the traffic circles that they have did you know that the purpose of that roundabout is it's not to go round and round and round and round the purpose of the roundabout is to get off the roundabout and you get people who go in a circle and they go in a you know unless you're not from there and you come to Buford and there's roundabouts and people look at you and they're honk and the horn and that what in the world is this guy doesn't realize that circle is not just to go around and around and around and around and around and around and around but you know that's how life is sometimes and if the devil could get you in the rat race let me just say the devil can get you quickly as a believer in Babylon in a rat race say like my dad says you might win the rat race but you're still a rat and he gets people in a circle and they go around and around and around and around and around the mountain and around the mountain you know that circle of life that everyone's chasing let me just preach to you here just for a moment you know you wake up you you get your you you get married you get a home and and then you get a family and you get in that rut where you just you get a career now you wake up that morning you go to work and you you make your coffee you go to work you say goodbye to your children you work eight hours you come home that day you say hello to your family you greet your children you veg on entertainment uh you get on YouTube you go to bed you wake up the next day you make your coffee you go back to work you work eight hours you come home you greet your family greet your children vegil entertainment watch YouTube go to bed wake up the next day make your coffee go back to work work8 hours come home your family vegal entertainment do we go around do I need to go on this morning and you go around and around and around and around the circle but let me just declare to you you weren't called for that that's not what your life is about that might be what their life is about but you were Anointed with a purpose and your life is called to go somewhere I'm not made for this world to go in a roundabout my life is all headed to a direction it's got a purpose it's got a calling and I say to you today if you're on the roundabout get off the roundabout this morning get on the line of redemption my brother and my sister you weren't made for that Circle Holy Spirit stopped me this morning and said Somebody's on a circle and you're going to tell them get off so I say to you in the name of the Lord if you're in that Circle get off of the roundabout and get on the line of redemption give you a little nugget here the Book of Ruth and and judges were originally one book Wen it separated in the Jewish Hebrew Tanakh you'll read that they're one book Hebrews and and judges and Ruth you know what judges is all about it's all about going in the circle in a circle and while the the while the while the prophet lived the people serve God then when the prophet died they went down Prophet lived they serve God then the prophet died they went down the prophet God rose up another savior another judge and and they would serve God then they then they died then they'd stopped serving God and they went around and around and around you know what though the Book of Ruth was not about a circle it was about a line of redemption it was about a promise and a place she was going oh my brother I hope you see it today you there are some people that's let me just preach there are people that are just called to go around and around and around but that's not your place and that's not my calling I'm called to a line of redemption and I say God if I've been trapped into the circle let me get off the circle this morning let me get on the path and see a vision how many here would say Lord let me catch the vision for my life let me call me to the purpose you've placed me for Lord Jesus Moses gets to this place and he's questioning everything in his life he questions everything I I want you to catch it my brother my sister uh Moses is in a place of desperation you know God will whether you ask him to say it the way the holy spirit's telling me to say it whether you ask him to or not whether you want him to or not the Lord will orchestrate and push buttons and flip levers in your life to get you to desperation and sometimes we don't even realize that the pressures that we F and the moments that we F to where we have pressure and feels like like we're surrounded by the flood of the enemy let me say a lot of times that's god pushing the buttons and pulling the levers and turning the wheel and flipping your vehicle four or five times to where God finally gets your attention and you get to a place and say oh God I'm not even saved do I even have that I ever even know you Lord you don't realize sometimes God moves things and shifts things in your world to produce desperation out of your life that was for somebody he's questioning everything he's saying Lord I today I'm like Jacob today Lord I if I'd be honest here Lord before you and if I if I could just for a moment throw apart Throw Down The Mask put a put put put apart your masks throw aside the facade listen friends sometimes we need to put our masks off put our facade off of how how you know of how good you know the image that we put before people you never get help from a doctor sitting there saying there ain't nothing wrong with me and I'm perfectly healthy I ain't got no issues I know but why are you at my office well I just wanted to let you know I don't have no trouble and I you don't need to look at me I'm perfect I got everything in order listen friends you never get helped that way you end up dying in that condition until you can get honest and say hey I don't have it all together I'm not put together I fail the Lord more times than I'm willing to admit I'm a needy person that's why I could say I Need You Jesus I Need Your Mercy in my life I need your grace in my life I'm humble enough to say Lord I've failed you more times than I could admit but today I'm saying Mercy come and rewrite my life Grace come and envelop my body notice what his testimony is Lord for weing this is verse 16 look at there in your Bible in verse 16 notice what he says for wherein shall it be known notice the conversation change he says for wherein shall it be known I love this Moses says Lord I'm not going unless you go just remember that want you to remember I'm not going anywhere Lord unless you go don't even send me God says I'll go I'll go with you Moses who go my presence will go okay okay that sounds good but let me say it again unless you go I'm not going but Moses I already told you my presence is going with you Moses I I you found Grace in my sight I I know you by name Moses says okay okay okay hold on let me say something how how how will notice verse verse 16 for where where where wherein shall it be known that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight notice is it not that thou goest with us then he's question mark notice after the question mark so shall we be separated I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the Earth so shall we be separated you know what Moses is doing those weren't Moses's words right amen hello somebody in other words Moses had spoke his own thought up to this point but now he starts quoting what God Said now he starts repeating what God had told him when he caught him in the first place oh my brother my sister you could shout on that here for a minute he starts quoting the word of God back to God he starts saying so how listen shall so shall we be separated I and thy people uh from all the people that are upon the face of the Earth no notice what his testimony is Lord how will anyone know that I'm yours and these and your people are your people unless you unless you're with us Lord you know Moses starts repeating the words back to God do you understand Moses wasn't bragging upon himself Moses wasn't saying ah I'm separated Toto the Lord and I'm somebody and God has called know that it was quite the opposite that Moses was doing Moses was actually looking humbly and saying Lord I'm nothing you might have called me and said Lord but I'll be honest you might have got the wrong guy don't you realize I got arthritis I got back pain I can't even speak I'm not eloquent Lord you think you just made a big mistake and he starts quoting the word back to God and he was saying God you're the one who said that about me you're the one who promised it Lord I didn't promise it these aren't my words those are your words in other words I didn't find you you found me oh my brother my sister let me just preach preach to you if you're struggling to accept the word of God for your life I recommend to you today start quoting the word back to God and say I'm not the one who called me Lord I'm not the one who chose me I wouldn't even be here today if it wasn't up for you Lord I didn't come seeking you you came seeking me I didn't put myself in the race and I didn't start this work so I'm not going to be the one to finish this work it's going to take you and I say today come and finish what you started in my life Lord come and finish the work you've placed in me oh God I didn't call me you called me I didn't choose me you choose me that's your words those aren't my words I didn't promise you promised I didn't make a you made it to me Lord Jesus those are your words not my words Moses is repeating I'm not the one who said that you're my peculiar treasure you called me that amen you know it's a powerful thing when you can re recognize something it wasn't you who put you in this race it wasn't you who called and sought God but God sought you you know what that means then the pressure is not on me the pressure is on him who called me the the the listen friends can I just preach here for a moment listen friends the pressure is not on you to perfect you the pressure is on God to say Lord I've yielded I've surrendered now come and finish what you put in my life you put a desire here God I wasn't even seeking you but you put something inside of me it says I hunger for righteousness I thirst uh for Holiness I long for God I look for God I worship God because he called me to this and if he's the one who started he'll have to be the one who finishes if he's the one who started he'll have to be the one who perfects if he's the one who promised healing it'll be him who performs it if my children are unlost and unsaved it won't be me it'll take God and a promise that he made those are your inheritance that is your children that is your body not the devil's body it's your word Lord not my [Music] word God's saying I'm taking it off me and I'm putting on you who spoke [Music] it that's your word Lord that's not my word and you know the awesome thing about it it is his word and it is what he spoke and we don't need to question what he spoke we just need to believe what he spoke you're the one who put me in the race I didn't even want to be in it come on somebody you're the one who put me in this race I didn't even want to be in it I wasn't seeking God I was going a million miles the wrong direction but someone reached down a hand in Mercy and picked me up out of the mud and dusted me off and and cleaned me off but Lord I struggled with you I fought against you but you humbled me you broke me you chased me you pursued me you kept coming out after me I would have given up on you a long time ago but I still find myself here this morning I've still got a desire to serve you I've still got a burden to worship you I still got something in spite of all of my mistakes and all of my failures and all of my Humanity there's still something that hungers for the Lord Jesus in my life and you know what's awesome about God brother John he started the race and so he's got to finish the race let me let me just say can you reach a hold and grab that this morning listen you know what's different about this race of life that you're in for the Lord that the man who pulls the gun pull pulls the trigger to to start the race brother Luke when he the same one in this race the same one who's P who who pulled the trigger to start the race is the same one at the finish line waiting to receive you when you finish your race Hallelujah he's the same one who says you need a drink of water let me give you a drink of water he's the same one who says don't give give up child keep running child keep pressing now's not the time to quit I'm here to encourage you I'm here to feel you I'm here to pour my spirit upon you whatever you need it'll already be provided if you get tired I've got energy from the Holy Ghost to refill you with a baptism so that you can wake up tomorrow and continue to run this race am he's the same one do you realize that he's the same one who saved me is the same one years later when I'm discouraged he's there to sit down beside me put his arm over on me and say you can make it you can make it child I know it does doesn't look like it but you're going to make it Lord but you know what you picked you sure it's me you sure God I'm the right one I feel like the wrong candidate there's a lot of people who can run a lot faster I feel like I failed you Lord that's all right child it's all right I'm the one who called you it's not him that runneth it's it's not him that willth or him that rth it's God that showeth Mercy it's God that porth Grace oh can I just say today the only reason that I'm here today is by the grace of Jesus Christ the only reason I would have quit a long time ago brother if you'd be honest you'd admit it today and say I would have turned my back on it a long time ago but grace Amazing Grace has called me amen hallelujah he can come and finish what he started because he's not just the starter brother the Travis he's also the finisher he's also the perfector he's also the Builder he's also the maturer he's also the ripener he's a father he's a mother he's a brother he's a sister he's a friend whatever you need today it's in Jesus your answers aren't there your answers aren't out there your an is right here in the seat of God he put inside of you all you got to do is yield get it some water get in the right atmosphere and it'll grow amen the same one who started is the same one who will finish the race he's the starter that's why the prophet of God would say for those saints that went down in faith he said you know that brother who died in faith they also Rose in faith how they went to the ground determine how they would come out of the ground Oh Glory to God how they went to the ground how they died is how they come up and brother says if you die in faith believing that he's a Healer you come out of that grave in faith that he was a Healer if you died in faith believing in Jesus you'll come up in faith that's why job said throughout all the times in the darkest places of his life let me just say to you friends it got to a place for job he couldn't see God he couldn't feel God he couldn't sense God job said if I knew where he lived I'd knock on his door and I'd come to his house and I know that if I could find him he'd open the door and he'd sit me down down job says he'd speak kind words to me he wouldn't chastise me oh job got to a place where he couldn't see the Lord but you know what job found a key to his success he found a secret job said I go backwards and I can't find him I go forwards and he's not there I go up anybody ever felt that way I get come to church and I don't really I go to my I don't really feel it I go to work I prayed I I've listened but job finally said but here's what I know I may not be able to see him but he sees me and if you could grab a hold of that promise my brother my sister you may feel like you don't see him today but let me tell you he sees you he sees that trouble he sees your life he sees that struggle that you're going through and job says I know that after he has tried me I'll come forth as pure gold tried in the fire and brother bham said job went to the Grave with a faith to say I know my redeemer liveth and I shall see him stand upon the Earth Amen brother man said did that promise ever get fulfilled he said oh yeah oh yeah one day he said Jo there was job down in paradise and he said and here comes ABS Abraham and Sarah and he says then he says notice suddenly the scene changes and he said there's a there's a knock at the door I like to imagine it wasn't a banging that's how they knocked on Hell's door but when he knocked on Paradise I have a feeling it was just like brother Ken when a friend comes over to see you and he just knocks on the door for fellowship and brother bham says there Abraham Sarah toiling there and he says Abraham says did you someone at the door Sarah said go go let him man Abraham who is it imagine Abraham as he what goes to the door he opens the door and his eyes got about this big remember if they died and went to the grave in an expectation they had that expectation throughout eternity am and brother bham says his eyes get like this and he and he's speechless and there's the Lord Jesus and he says sarah sarah sarah come here fast come here Sarah that's him that's him that's that's the one I told you about that's the one that met me under the oak tree that day oh when it seemed like life had went sideways and it seemed like I was all the way at the end of my road and it seemed like I was always lost and I would forever be lost and it seemed like everything was a mess but then he came on the scene and showed up one day that's him and brother R says then Ezekiel SS up and says no no no no no no no you got it all wrong that's not that's the will in the middle of the will that's the one Daniel says no no no no no that's not you all got it wrong that's the rock that was Hune out of the mountain job says no brothers and sisters that's my redeemer that's the one I said I'll see though the skin worms destroy this body notice my brother and my sister he was something different to each of them but he was the same person he was the same Jesus and when I see him that day and when you see him that day he may be someone different to you than he is for me I may have never battled cancer and you might be battling today I may have never battled Great Depression but that might have been your fight and your struggle but let me just say this you can't go through what I went through and I can't go what you went through but here's the confidence I have we have the same father we have the same friend we have the same Redeemer and when I crown him that day I'll say that's the one who met me when I was discouraged and it seemed like there was no way way he made a way in my life when I was raising my children and I had no answers that's the one who met me in my prayer closet that's the one who healed my body that's the one who encouraged me when I was down in the depths of Despair that's the one when I almost ended my life that's the one I met that's the one who spoke to my mother that's the one who saved my unsaved loved one when I had tried everything in my life to get a hold of their soul that's the one who moved on the scene when I couldn't find him that's the one who saved my friend that's the one who healed my body that's the one who encouraged me he might be something different to you but he will be the same Jesus Oh can we give him a praise offering this morning he's [Music] worthy Hallelujah brother Bon says Jesus says yes yes brother it's me it's me prophet of God picks it up in a tment he says oh he says Jesus will look at job and say no you're right that was me he'll look at Daniel that you're right it was me prophet of God picks it up in a two and he says brother bam says that Jesus will say yes it is me I'm the one you waited for yes I'm the one when you felt like giving up I gave you a cold drink of water I'm the one when you got to your lowest of your low it's me my brother and my sister it's me and you haven't waited in vain you haven't believed cunningly devised fables you haven't waited in your life in vain one day my brother my sister that quickening reality that you have in this presence one day it'll become more real than you ever dreamed possible brother random says one day we'll understand one day it'll all make sense it might not make sense this life may not make sense today but let me just say one day it'll all make sense to you one day you'll have all the answers to all of your questions he was a father he was a brother he was a friend he was an encourager he was a redeemer he was a revivor he was a deliverer he was a provider he was a helper he was a Healer can somebody testify of Jesus today he was all of those things to me if you don't know him let me tell you he's greater than anything you'll ever meet he's greater than any person any friend every brother and sister he's he's greater my brother my sister if you don't know him today he is the one that you've waited for and it's not been in vain lord said to Moses I will do this thing amen the first time God said it to Moses it should have been enough you found Grace in my sight Moses now lead this people but you know what Moses wasn't convinced right Moses wasn't convinced so he says it again Lord if I found Grace in your sight then show me your way God says okay I'll do that my presence will go with you Moses says Lord I don't I if you don't go how will people even know and and and Lord if you don't if you don't they don't even sin and you know what it sounded like to me brother John sounded like Moses needed convincing sounded like he's a lot like brother Matt no not about me I'm saying that about you sounds like don't point at me point at you say sounds like Moses was a lot like me if I'd be honest sounds like Moses said Lord I need convinced of this sounds like Moses was unsure he was unsure notice not about the word about him amen he was unsure about himself it would have been okay for God to save Moses you know God would have said Moses you know what give me a break man never mind forget I even asked my goodness could you imagine here a man speaks to you a God speaks to you face to face and you're still not convinced on imagine brother Lucas here God comes down reveals himself to you face to face and you still need convincing God could have said you know what never mind you know what brother Elliot you've asked so many times now I just you how many times I got how many times you got to keep coming brother how many times you going to ask I've told you over and over you know what never mind forget it sorry I asked sorry I asked you know what Moses I'm just done with you and you've asked too many times but you know what I'm so glad that's not what my heavenly father does my heavenly father says when you're going to give up on me God how how many times am I am I going to go to youth camp and how many times am I going to need to be encouraged and Lord when are you going to give up on me I'm not going to give up on you I'm going to keep preaching to you I'm going to keep promising you I'm going to keep telling you I'm going to keep encouraging you and announcing to you you can make it child you're more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus you say when are you going to stop I'm never going to stop

and pour out and pour out and pour out and pour out you say how many times is God going to do it until your faith matches your confession let it be settled in your mind forever my brother my sister he ain't never going to quit he ain't never going to give up he's never going to stop preaching he's you know what he does to Moses he just keep telling them again and he tells him again and he tells him again and he tells him again Lord I know I heard and he tells him again until he believes it he's not going to stop are you thankful for God's grace this morning can we do go just a few minutes what's wrong Moses why does he have to tell you what is it about us it's got to tell us all over and over and over don't let the devil tell you it's because you're not a Believer don't let the devil tell you it's because you're not born again don't let the devil lie to you and send you on a rut in your life in a circle looking for something you already have don't let the devil put you on that roundabout of Life wondering what's wrong with me and what's the matter with me I tell you what problem you have you have the same problem that Moses had you had the same problem Joshua had you had the same problem Daniel had you had the same problem Paul had Peter had you had the same problem brother brandom even had of himself and standing in the Gap he said Lord I know I was never fit for the job in the first place I knew you picked the wrong person Lord listen friends you have the same problem Mighty Men of God had it's not the word it's the vessel [Music] on and you know what God does what I love about God this is what I love God doesn't kick out anybody going to say that to you as it comes to me God don't kick anybody out hello my goodness we we kick people out sometimes might need to say this behind this pull pit over here hide from anything being thrown we're quick to even if we don't literally do it in our minds worthless they'll never make it waste of time we can we can kick people out if we'd be honest as Christians only army in the world that buries their wounded I said the only army in the world that can sometimes bury their wounded but God doesn't kick anybody out you say anybody brother Matt you don't know me you don't you don't know what I've even thought of in this service you don't you don't know what's going through my mind you don't know what I did last night you don't know what I thought you don't know the battle in darkness that I'm the dark place I'm in brother Matt listen I've criticized everything I I've been you've been preaching this whole morning I've just sat here with the wrong attitude you don't know me you don't know what I'm thinking you don't know listen friends Jes those are the people Jesus died for that's the people Jesus can save come on you know what I love about the Lord he isn't kick anybody out even Thomas who doubts gets to such a place in his life he says I don't care what you say I don't care you guys are just getting fanatical you're getting all emotional getting all excited you guys can just cut that out Thomas he's risen don't even start with me don't even start I I I won't believe it I don't care how many miracle I don't care what you say I don't care what kind of sign I'm not going to believe it and nope nope I'm not unless unless I have physical proof he said come on unless I have physical proof you can get all excited you want and y'all jump up and down and shout and do all your little dances and Spins I don't care what you do I ain't going to believe you know what the Bible doesn't say Bible doesn't say that Jesus suddenly appears well he does do that and then he's over there hugging Peter and hugging and they're embracing oh Jesus oh Jesus and Bible doesn't say Jesus looks over at Thomas sitting in the corner and says what is he doing here doubter skeptic questioning every what is that what is he you know what God never does that I'm so glad God never does that to Thomas in fact you know what Jesus does Jesus says come here Thomas you need proof Thomas go ahead Thomas touch him if that's what you need brother bam says it this way God will meet you at whatever level of Faith you can give him and you may be down in the bottom below the bottom down on the very ground but Jesus will come down and condens send to the lowest level to the lowest doubter to the lowest skeptic to the lowest questioner I'm so glad if i' be honest he never gave up on me he didn't kick me out oh let me just preach to you there are no outcasts in the kingdom of God there are no orphans in his family he doesn't kick anybody out he welcomes everybody in and he'll meet you at whatever Faith you can give him and I say God meet me right here Jesus meet me right here Lord Jesus as brother brandom tells that story preaches that sermon and that little girl comes up to him and he says Lord I don't even know I don't even know where to start and she just looks at him and says start with me preacher just start right here I'd be honest enough to say there might be a lot of prideful people but I'll be honest to say I need you to start right here lord well how many honest hands would just go up and say Lord start right here with me start right here in all of my unbelief start right here in all of my skepticism and fears and doubts start right here Lord Jesus there's nothing wrong with your faith in the word you know what let me tell you what Moses's problem was I'm going to make it very simple Moses had a stark reality that I want you to catch this morning say why did he struggle so hard to believe he's speaking face to face why is he wrestling and contending and over over and over I'm going to tell you why because Moses understood something that maybe no one else understood stood he knew that in his stature there was nothing special had he been a great strong special eloquent gifted he might would have put confidence in himself but he knew when he laid his head on his pillow at night he was a miserable failure this is why struggling cuz he knew God I'm nothing there's nothing in my St sture there's nothing in my speech there the it's not my money it's not my financial status it's not the family that I came from and the the the the the the Legacy that they left it's not the it's not my dad I don't have any special name to claim to to fame I don't have any kind of Lord you could have called someone else that was you know a little bigger little taller little Stout little strong more confident but I'm I'm a very unconfident person God I can't even speech Bible says he stammered with it he couldn't even talk Moses understood something that maybe no one else understood but it's something that he understood that we need to understand today that the only thing the only thing that made him unique and made him different the only thing that separated him from everybody else was one thing that God was for him amen the only reason he had any hope was that Jehovah was for him he knew that if you remove the presence of Jesus if you remove I'm going to preach if you strip out the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and reduce this message down to nothing but dress codes and legalism and a lifestyle and long hair and long dresses and men who don't wear shorts and men who don't smoke and men who don't cuss those are all wonderful but if you remove the personal presence of Jesus you've lost everything [Music] I'm just going to be honest friends can I can I do that today I know brother Aaron really well and I might not say this other places but I I think I can say it here on do you realize when Moses could say Lord all the Tabernacle with all of its bells and all of its whistles and the carbuncle the onx the barrel the Sardis and the topaz and the Jasper and the golden L laid and overlaid and gold and all the curtains and all the perfect every part everything that made up the Tabernacle but it wasn't the beauty it wasn't the gold it wasn't even the it wasn't the any of the special precious stones that made it different the only thing that made that Tabernacle special was a little room on the very inside where the pillar of fire could come down in that little room and if you remove the pillar of fire am good hello if you remove the pillar of fire what do you have what do we have good dress code good good Doctrine yeah it's better it's good good hunting stories that's good wonderful man great good people some of the best in the world good music that's wonderful friends I hope you catch what I'm saying to you today the only thing that makes you different is that God is for you and when you lose the presence of a real Jesus you can have the best Doctrine the best teacher the best preacher the best gifts the best Sensations best [Music] emotions but when you remove the pillar of fire present tense amen I said present tense amen when you remove that you remove everything there was nothing special about him listen friends there's nothing special about you and there's nothing special about me in fact we're the opposite of what the world would call special we're what the world would call deplorable Basket Case rejects they called them Holy Rollers they called them all kinds of disparaging names do you realize it was the lineage of Cain who was special Builders of cities even musicians and great talented Seth Lin AG was brother Brandon would call them dirt dobbers they dwelt in tents they they they went from place to place they weren't the high educated they listen do you realize study history who did God reveal himself to it wasn't the eloquent it wasn't the intelligent you said brother matter is there something wrong no I'm preaching against that don't get me wrong it wasn't the the Great and the mighty it was the humble of heart the simple when he moved on a soua street what kind of people was it it was a dark brother it's a little dingy place on the side and a crossroad no one even knew but God was pouring out a spirit Upon A people when he moved upon listen friends you could take it all the way through the Bible God never declares himself to the mighty it's the weak and the lonely and the simple and but let me tell you something brother they might not have had a lot of riches and I might not have the biggest house and I might not have the best car and I might not have the fanciest clothes but I've got a promise I've got promises in the word of God I've got the peace that passes understanding oh help me preach this morning church I've got a joy unspeakable I might not have much in this life but to me I've got everything that I need I've got everything that I want I can say like David one thing have I desired of the lord it's not money it's not riches it's not fame it's the presence of God all the days of my life how many would say Lord that's what I desire today I might not have much in this life but I've got everything that I need and it's all in Jesus Christ and if we lose and if we trade if we trade if we trade the presence of Jesus for anything eloquent speech or education or emotion or for for some kind of feeling or program or some outwardly Beauty if you trade in for anything then you have no difference between you and anybody else or any church down the street you know what I say I say give me Jesus you can take this whole world you can take all of its all of its Pleasures you can take it all but give me Jesus we don't run things by a board we don't run things by denomination we don't run things by government other nations might have done that but Moses said that that's how they direct their life but we operate by one principle here and the only way to be guided or to be governed to make war or to survive in this Wasteland there's only one thing we need the presence of Jesus Christ the presence of almighty God to renew to refill to restore to rebuild to redeem it's all included in the promise am must be God for you and I say like the Apostle Paul as the musicians can come I say like the Apostle Paul what shall we say to these things I want you to put everything raise your hand I want you to put everything in that category of these things I don't care what it is in your life you got trouble raise up a hand you've got stress raise up a hand if you don't don't raise your hand and I'd love to be you but if you got pressure in your life raise up a hand say God I'm just going to admit it right here these are these things I've got troubles I've got trials I've got problems I've got weaknesses I've got failures come on I'll eventually hit your button I've got Pride I've got jealousy I've got malice I've got bitterness I've got lust I've got all sorts of things going on in my life I've got pressures on every side I've got fears in my heart I've got anxieties of spirit I've got the devil attacking my home I've got him attacking my mind I got him attacking my marriage what shall you say to these things if God be for you then tell me who can really be against you if God be for you nothing can stop you I said nothing can stand in the way the prophet of God said the word of God on the mouths of believing Christians has never failed if God before you then tell me who can be against you
