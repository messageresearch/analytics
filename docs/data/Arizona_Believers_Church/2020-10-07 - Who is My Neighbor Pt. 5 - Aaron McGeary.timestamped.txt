[0:00] preparation Luke chap 10 start with
[0:03] verse 30 and Jesus answering said a
[0:06] certain man went down from Jerusalem to
[0:08] Jericho and fell among Thieves which
[0:10] stripped him of his rment and wounded
[0:13] him and departed leaving him half dead
[0:16] and by chance there came down a certain
[0:18] priest that way and when he saw him he
[0:20] passed by on the other side and likewise
[0:24] a levite when he was at the place came
[0:26] and looked on him and passed by on the
[0:30] other side amen you may be
[0:34] seated we appreciated brother brother
[0:38] Michael jumping in and leading songs I
[0:40] thought he did a tremendous job and just
[0:42] uh loved the the uh the worship of the
[0:45] people and his efforts in and and
[0:47] leading songs and there's a several that
[0:50] are out this evening and that's why um
[0:52] different ones have been thrust into
[0:54] different roles but I think that's uh
[0:56] one of the things that church affords US
[0:58] is an opportunity to serve and gives
[1:00] opportunities for certain gifts and uh
[1:02] and talents and efforts that people
[1:04] would want to put forth that's I really
[1:05] think that's what church is for is not
[1:07] just for one man to stand up before you
[1:09] and tell you everything he knows out of
[1:11] the message but opportunities for all of
[1:13] us points of service and opportunities
[1:15] for our gifts to be cultivated and grown
[1:17] so we appreciate brother Michael
[1:18] stepping up out of his comfort zone he
[1:20] says but he stepped out of stepped out
[1:22] and helped out tonight we're so
[1:24] appreciative of it we're looking at uh
[1:26] the title has been who is my neighbor uh
[1:29] that's the question question that is
[1:30] asked before Jesus goes into this story
[1:32] of the parable that we call the parable
[1:34] of the Good Samaritan and we're actually
[1:36] looking at relationships among the
[1:38] characters in this Parable because it's
[1:41] it's more as we said last time it's more
[1:42] than just the man going down from
[1:44] Jerusalem to Jericho in this Samaritan
[1:47] that helps him out there's other actors
[1:49] that um present themselves and make
[1:51] themselves known so we have a certain
[1:53] man that went down from Jerusalem to
[1:55] Jericho we have thieves which we could
[1:57] look at as a group of people then we
[1:59] have a a certain priest a levite we have
[2:01] the Samaritan and then we even have a
[2:04] host so there's different relationships
[2:06] among these parties and different
[2:08] relationships between specific ones and
[2:10] we're looking at them just so that we
[2:12] can be challenged in many different ways
[2:14] from this Parable by the word of God and
[2:17] I believe that every detail is
[2:19] significant that as Jesus begins to
[2:22] answer this lawyer's question of who is
[2:24] my neighbor he takes great care in
[2:27] referencing even going from Jerusalem to
[2:29] Jericho he takes care in mentioning that
[2:31] it's a certain priest and that it's a
[2:33] levite and that it's a Samaritan and
[2:35] then even a host all these characters
[2:38] and these actors that present themselves
[2:40] in this parable are to uh get this
[2:42] lawyer's attention and cause him to
[2:44] think more deeply about even what he had
[2:46] said when he said well the the law says
[2:48] if I love the Lord with all my mind soul
[2:50] and body and if I love my neighbor as
[2:52] myself then I have eternal life and
[2:55] Jesus says hey you've said pretty good
[2:56] that's good the lawyer then says well
[2:58] who is my neighbor seeking to justify
[3:01] himself and so I mention that again
[3:03] because I'm wanting to go specifically
[3:05] into some of these characteristics of
[3:07] the certain man because Jesus was
[3:09] wanting this lawyer to think more deeply
[3:11] now about what a neighbor is and then I
[3:14] think he's wanting him to think more
[3:15] deeply even about himself not just
[3:18] consider who his his neighbor might be
[3:20] but think more about himself and how he
[3:22] views himself and how his self viw
[3:25] influences his view of others and so we
[3:28] looked at last time how a man going down
[3:30] from Jerusalem to Jericho was one going
[3:33] down from a place that is blessed to a
[3:35] place that is cursed going down from a
[3:37] place which is uh the peace and God a
[3:40] place where God's worship was and and
[3:42] all the things that we could share or
[3:44] Express about Jerusalem it's significant
[3:47] it's a beautiful place it's situated in
[3:48] the mountains and uh how this would be a
[3:52] a place of God's presence a place of
[3:54] Temple worship and now he's going down
[3:56] from this blessed place a place that God
[3:58] has identified himself with and he's
[4:00] traveling down to a cursed place a place
[4:02] called Jericho and we mentioned how that
[4:05] we can all relate to this man as
[4:08] humankind that every man is born in sin
[4:11] uh that are we have no righteousness of
[4:13] our own and by our natural birth we're
[4:15] born between brother Bram says between
[4:17] Satan and Eve so we can't come out of
[4:19] the womb bragging and then even as we're
[4:22] raised by Perfect parents which my
[4:23] children could testify to not being
[4:25] raised by Perfect parents but uh even if
[4:28] we are raised by Perfect parents we
[4:30] can't brag we can't say wow I'm doing
[4:32] good I'm doing wonderful we all are born
[4:33] into this world as Sinners under a
[4:36] cursed it's even a curse that comes with
[4:38] that birth as the Bible says it's
[4:40] appointed unto one man once to die and
[4:43] then after that judgment so we all we
[4:45] all face the Judgment because of our sin
[4:47] and we can relate to this man as being
[4:50] representative of all humankind which
[4:52] fell with Adam but then brother brandham
[4:55] placed this man as one that was
[4:58] backsliding and he uses this several
[5:00] times where he says this is a man that
[5:01] had fallen from Jerusalem and was on his
[5:04] way to Jericho so he' fallen from that
[5:06] high place and has now going down to a
[5:08] low PL low place and these are just a
[5:11] few statements here at the outset um
[5:13] just to kind of reestablish where we are
[5:16] and and to go back over this
[5:20] and I I I do I do take my time and and
[5:23] prayer and before the Lord just to be
[5:25] sure that I'm just not going over things
[5:28] because there's material there
[5:30] uh and and but I tried to be very
[5:32] sensitive to the leadership of the Holy
[5:34] Spirit and I think it's wonderful when
[5:35] you can take your time and just keep
[5:37] looking at the same thing over and over
[5:38] again and realize just how much depth
[5:40] there is to it and how the word of God
[5:42] can take even just one statement one
[5:44] statement in the Bible and we can
[5:46] revisit it over and over and over again
[5:48] and it mean different things to us I'm
[5:50] sure you've all done that with scripture
[5:51] where you had a favorite scripture and
[5:53] you loved that scripture and you loved
[5:55] it because it really meant something to
[5:56] you at a particular time in your life
[5:58] and then many years go by in that same
[6:00] scripture comes from a different angle
[6:03] and means something even more to you in
[6:05] a different time in life and so we're we
[6:07] may be looking at something over and
[6:09] over and over again and if that if that
[6:11] frustrates you just let me know don't
[6:12] let anybody else know just let me know
[6:14] and we'll be sensitive to how the Lord
[6:16] is dealing with your hearts and what the
[6:17] desires of the people are but I'm I'm
[6:20] just using a few things in the beginning
[6:21] to lay a foundation and then I'm just
[6:23] going to stay right back in the same
[6:24] area that we've been but brother Bram
[6:26] says he was on his road backsliding when
[6:29] he fell among Thieves and robbers that
[6:31] stripped him and so that's how the
[6:33] prophet placed this man he placed him as
[6:35] a backslider on his road from Jerusalem
[6:38] on his road backsliding so it's a
[6:40] process it's not that when he stepped
[6:42] foot outside of Jerusalem boom
[6:43] immediately he's fully backslid but he
[6:44] looks at maybe a spectrum of backsliding
[6:47] and he's falling away from Jerusalem to
[6:49] Jericho and then he he uses this to
[6:51] really challenge us he says and that's
[6:53] when you fall among Thieves and
[6:55] robbers when you start backsliding away
[6:57] from God just expect the enemy to be
[7:00] along the road so you depart from some
[7:03] place of safety and it is true that this
[7:06] bride cannot fall I was fellowshipping
[7:09] with brother Chad Lamb last week and he
[7:10] shared something with me that just kind
[7:12] of got me all stirred up I was thinking
[7:14] how in the world am I not going to get
[7:15] away get away from this and not preach
[7:16] this but he was just fellowshipping on
[7:18] how that uh it really struck him how
[7:21] that God said he placed Adam and Eve
[7:23] behind the word in the beginning Adam
[7:26] and the woman were behind the word so
[7:27] they could walk out from behind the word
[7:29] word placed behind it as a protection so
[7:32] they could leave it he said but now in
[7:33] the end time brother Bron makes this
[7:35] statement that it's not that we're and
[7:38] using summary language now it's not that
[7:39] we're placed behind the word but we are
[7:41] the word and because we are the word we
[7:44] can't fail because we are the word we we
[7:47] we can't get out from uh get out from
[7:49] behind it we are the word so I say that
[7:51] to say that you are absolutely secure in
[7:54] Christ as a Christian as a Christian
[7:57] who's born again which means you're
[7:58] filled with the Holy Ghost you're secure
[7:59] in Christ as the as being positionally
[8:02] placed in the body of Christ through the
[8:04] through the spirit baptism then then
[8:06] you're secure you can't lose your
[8:08] salvation uh but there is now a a
[8:11] measure wherein we can grieve the Holy
[8:14] Spirit and walk out from Beyond the
[8:16] blessings of what that position in
[8:18] Christ affords us so brother B says that
[8:21] when you are getting away from God and
[8:23] you're backsliding from God you make
[8:25] yourself vulnerable to thieves and
[8:27] robbers in your position under the
[8:29] headship of the word you you you're
[8:31] fortified you have protection but when
[8:33] you come out from behind that uh get
[8:36] away from that protection and you step
[8:37] outside of that uh uh that safety of the
[8:40] word of God you make yourself vulnerable
[8:42] not your salvation but your spiritual
[8:44] well-being your thought process your
[8:46] thought life the way that you interact
[8:48] and think of others and so I thought
[8:50] about it today how that every place that
[8:52] I read including in the parable and even
[8:55] as brother bradam dealt with it he says
[8:57] that here's a man backsliding and I just
[9:00] I hope you can fellowship with me in
[9:02] this thought and not think I'm trying to
[9:03] be mean but here's a man that's
[9:06] backsliding and then robbers seize upon
[9:09] him they strip him and they take his
[9:11] whatever value valuables he may have had
[9:14] and they he leaves them on the side of
[9:15] the road and I thought what
[9:17] Grace that God would catch us on our
[9:20] road to Jericho and stop us before we
[9:22] get there even if it has to be at the
[9:25] hand of Thieves what Grace it is when
[9:28] God stops the believer on his way down
[9:31] from Jerusalem to Jericho and I thank
[9:33] God all the times in my life if I ever
[9:35] got away from Jerusalem and it sure look
[9:37] like I was headed to Jericho but God has
[9:39] a way of stopping the believer on his
[9:41] way to Jericho why you're not ordained
[9:43] to go to the cursed place you're you're
[9:45] not a person of that that is cursed
[9:47] you're not someone that's going to have
[9:48] your place in the cursed City but rather
[9:50] God has an expected end that he's
[9:52] bringing you to and it's the grace of
[9:54] God many times when we're stepping away
[9:56] from where we ought to be we've stepped
[9:58] outside of the prot ction of God's word
[10:00] and we're met with difficulty Calamity
[10:02] whatever it might be and it's the grace
[10:04] of God that the robber sees upon us why
[10:06] it's his grace that stops us from making
[10:08] it all the way to Jericho and I think
[10:11] it's wonderful just to ponder that and
[10:12] think that nowhere do I find where
[10:14] brother brandham or Jesus placed this
[10:16] man all the way in Jericho but something
[10:18] stopped him on his
[10:20] way and backsliding is no indication of
[10:23] a lack of
[10:25] election it's easy for us to surmise
[10:27] that if someone backslides we
[10:28] immediately begin to question their
[10:30] experience and then we begin to question
[10:32] their election and it's important that
[10:34] we not engage in those assessments or
[10:36] those judgments the question whether or
[10:38] not someone is elect uh but rather we
[10:41] you can we have discernment when someone
[10:42] is backsliding so we know that they need
[10:44] to be ministered particularly they need
[10:46] to be met in a certain way they need to
[10:47] be we need to address whatever
[10:49] difficulty they're going through but we
[10:50] never recognize backsliding as an
[10:52] opportunity to say oh they may not be
[10:55] elect or or they um they've never had an
[10:58] experience with God the very phrase
[11:00] backsliding assumes that someone has had
[11:02] some experience with God some position
[11:05] some place of worship some place with
[11:07] Christ and now they're falling away from
[11:09] it and I'm wanting to back up from where
[11:12] we were last week right at the very
[11:13] beginning when brother Brandon was
[11:15] talking about backsliding and we were
[11:17] looking at even the meaning of to be
[11:19] backslid and there's ways that we can
[11:21] backslide where it's of our own accord
[11:23] we make decisions we Harden our hearts
[11:25] we we Fellowship around the wrong things
[11:27] we we feed our Spirits with the wrong
[11:29] kind of things and it causes us to
[11:31] backslide from from where we ought to be
[11:32] in our spirit and our relationship with
[11:34] God but then the word backslid also in
[11:37] the Bible speaks of one being repulsed
[11:39] or driven away so there's uh there's
[11:41] outside factors sometimes that cause
[11:43] people to backslide and I'm wanting to
[11:45] look at this backsliding uh from
[11:48] different angles tonight because it's
[11:49] easy to misunderstand what it means to
[11:52] backslide whether it be our opinion of
[11:55] somebody else or whether our own
[11:57] misconceptions about oursel
[11:59] and so it's important I wanted just to
[12:01] look at this subject of backsliding a
[12:03] little bit differently brother bam when
[12:05] he preaches demonology in the Physical
[12:07] Realm he says now cancer what is that
[12:10] fellow what does he represent now if you
[12:12] could just really focus intently tonight
[12:15] um on this I actually put my notes in a
[12:18] bigger sized font so that I would fill
[12:20] up more pages and not go too far I say
[12:22] no I can't go past a page that's going
[12:23] to be so I'm going to try to be short
[12:25] tonight and and that's not hard for a
[12:27] guy who's barely 5'8
[12:29] and so he says what does what does this
[12:31] cancer fellow represent he's a scavenger
[12:33] he represents the vulture he eats dead
[12:35] things and a cancer now Focus now a
[12:38] cancer comes from a bruise mostly where
[12:41] cells been hit and it breaks up now
[12:44] instead of trying to think wellow is
[12:46] that really how a cancer is and is that
[12:47] where science is today let's not worry
[12:49] about where Medical Science places at
[12:51] today brother Brandon was seeing a truth
[12:53] he he he saw truth in our spiritual
[12:56] lives he saw truth in in reality
[12:58] according to God's word and he's using
[13:00] science as a type or an example of how
[13:03] that may be or how that works and so I
[13:05] want you to catch more the spiritual
[13:07] application here instead of getting
[13:08] caught uh maybe caught on the science of
[13:10] it he says a bruise is it comes from a
[13:14] bruise mostly where a cell's been hid
[13:15] and it breaks up and a little cell in
[13:18] there becomes
[13:20] backslid he says now notice this little
[13:23] cell backslides when it's bruised amen
[13:27] now the cell didn't bruise itself
[13:30] something bruises the cell so I'm going
[13:32] to take that to show again that many
[13:35] times there's there's though whether it
[13:38] be ourselves or those that we love they
[13:39] backslide because they've been
[13:41] bruised something hits their their
[13:44] Spirit something harms them in their
[13:45] human Spirit something causes a scar a
[13:48] wound or a complex and the wrong kind of
[13:51] image many times of the Bible the wrong
[13:52] kind of image of Christ is used in a way
[13:55] to harm somebody and so they have they
[13:58] have a a
[13:59] a trigger in their heart so they feel
[14:01] they look at something Church they can
[14:02] look at church as being a toxic
[14:04] environment they could look at the
[14:05] things pertaining to Christ being uh
[14:08] utensils of abuse and control and
[14:10] manipulation and so this person
[14:12] backslides not because they in their
[14:14] hearts had rejected God but because they
[14:17] become a little cell that is bruised and
[14:20] then he says it begins and now this is
[14:22] the picture I thought was so beautiful
[14:24] other little germs run forth to give its
[14:26] lives in there and that's where pus
[14:28] comes in the sore now he's just talking
[14:30] about maybe even any kind of wound he
[14:32] said that's teeny little soldiers
[14:34] fighting for your life they run up there
[14:37] and hit that poison them demon powers
[14:39] trying to collect in their and give
[14:41] their lives they are a bunch of little
[14:43] dead soldiers that give their life to
[14:45] save yours isn't that a beautiful
[14:48] picture of how that here brother bam
[14:50] describes in the physical now how that
[14:53] cancer is a scavenger and and he's a
[14:55] nasty little fellow but how he begins is
[14:58] he's bruised
[14:59] and so when the cell is bruised and it
[15:02] begins to break down and this cancer
[15:04] begins to form and brother calls these
[15:06] little demon powers rushing in there
[15:08] trying to collect in there he says
[15:10] there's these other little germs in the
[15:12] body that race to that bruised cell and
[15:16] they begin to provide support to it
[15:18] begin to try to um to fight the
[15:21] infection and fight off and fend off the
[15:23] cancer and brother and says they're
[15:25] running in they giving their lives to
[15:27] save yours and as I pondered uh the the
[15:30] example of a of a person backsliding
[15:33] because they're bruised and and and
[15:35] someone fallen from their position
[15:37] because of external factors and
[15:39] disappointments in life I thought about
[15:41] this analogy and I figured where do we
[15:43] fit into this this uh into this scheme
[15:47] if we're thinking of a cell that is
[15:49] bruised is one that is backslid and then
[15:51] there's demon powers that begin to fight
[15:53] in them there little soldiers that run
[15:55] in to get a fight against it maybe you
[15:57] can identify yourself as the BR
[15:59] bruised I know all of us could probably
[16:01] think in one time in our lives where we
[16:03] were the bruised uh but do you also
[16:05] identify as the
[16:07] Bruiser I don't think any of us want to
[16:09] be the Bruiser as we said last week
[16:12] don't be a thief H none of us want to be
[16:14] the Bruiser but are are but could we be
[16:17] the
[16:17] bomb you have the bruised and you have
[16:20] the Bruiser and if you're neither the
[16:21] bruised or the Bruiser maybe you could
[16:23] be the bomb you could be those little
[16:24] teeny soldiers you may not be much but
[16:26] you're rushing in you're heading in
[16:28] there to impact this cell that has been
[16:29] backslid this cell that has been bruised
[16:31] this cell that has fallen away and you
[16:33] don't oh we don't have any need of you
[16:34] you're good for nothing see you later
[16:36] don't let the door hit you on the way
[16:37] out no you there's something instinctive
[16:39] inside of you that doesn't want to let
[16:41] go reaches out and so we want to
[16:44] challenge ourselves tonight to to if we
[16:46] are the bruised then to welcome the
[16:48] Healer to welcome the healing that
[16:50] Christ can give H and if we've been the
[16:52] Bruiser we looked last week we ought to
[16:53] make it right but then I believe that
[16:56] Christ has called the body of his own
[16:58] body and called the church to be those
[17:00] who have a bomb those who have a
[17:02] Ministry to heal those have a Ministry
[17:04] of reaching out and addressing the needs
[17:06] in families and in people's lives and
[17:08] applying this word of God that we have
[17:10] in this end time to see that lives can
[17:12] be
[17:13] changed and so man as we look at that
[17:17] example in the body backsliding can
[17:19] manifest itself in different ways and be
[17:22] for different reasons that's what we
[17:24] that's what I want you to gather from
[17:25] that statement just using that example
[17:27] of how a little cell backslides when
[17:29] it's bruised backsliding can happen for
[17:32] different reasons so we want to be very
[17:34] very careful about our attitude towards
[17:37] uh the backslider that's that's what
[17:39] Jesus is teaching who's my neighbor the
[17:41] lawyer asked so he talks about a man
[17:42] falling away from Jerusalem in these
[17:44] Pious men walking by and avoiding them
[17:46] and he's no doubt dealing with their
[17:48] attitude towards this one that's
[17:51] fallen and there there's no doubt in my
[17:53] mind that he's really challenging this
[17:55] lawyer on how he thinks about other
[17:57] people and how he's been able able to
[17:59] take the Gentile and just write them off
[18:00] he's been able to take the Samaritan and
[18:02] just write them off he's been able to
[18:03] take these people and place them in
[18:05] separate categories to where they're not
[18:06] worthy of of him being neighborly
[18:08] towards them and because he's written
[18:10] them off Jesus has a parable to tell to
[18:13] shake this person's senses and get them
[18:15] to ponder to think what it means to be
[18:16] neighborly and who we ought to be
[18:18] neighborly
[18:19] to we read uh uh in the beginning when
[18:22] we first started looking at this subject
[18:24] and and and it's kind of nice starting a
[18:26] church because when you say that it's
[18:27] just a few weeks ago it's not like well
[18:29] this was several years ago we preached
[18:31] on this well we could just go back a few
[18:32] weeks it was last month so I know we
[18:34] don't remember but in Galatians chapter
[18:37] 6 verse1 he says Brethren Paul writing
[18:39] Brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[18:42] fault I I see the image of this certain
[18:44] man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho
[18:47] if a man be overtaken in a fault if he
[18:49] seems to be backsliding if he's fallen
[18:51] from his position he's no longer walking
[18:53] in Victory there's something that has
[18:55] overcome him and overwhelmed him he now
[18:58] speaks to to ye which are
[19:00] spiritual so this addresses a very
[19:03] specific category of people a group of
[19:05] people ye which are spiritual restore
[19:07] such a one in the spirit of meekness we
[19:11] looked at last time how there was a
[19:12] saving of one a restoring of one uh
[19:15] reconciling one and it wasn't
[19:16] necessarily salvation initial salvation
[19:19] but one who's walked in the grace of God
[19:20] who's experienced salvation who knows
[19:22] the blessings of God who wanders away
[19:24] from those blessings that if you can
[19:26] restore that one back then there's you
[19:29] can save that person from that
[19:31] difficulty rescue them from the the the
[19:33] pit that they've fallen into there's a
[19:35] blessing reserved for you if you do that
[19:37] now he's speaking in this way if a man
[19:39] be overtaken in a fault the spiritual
[19:41] ones are to restore that one and then
[19:44] qualifies the manner in which you
[19:46] restore he says in the spirit of
[19:48] meekness so it's it's not restoration um
[19:51] at all cost in other words well do
[19:53] whatever you need to do uh if you need
[19:54] to be a brute if you need to lie if you
[19:56] need to cheat you need to steal you know
[19:58] whatever it takes to to save the cner
[20:00] and save the backslider no he said
[20:02] you've got to do it in a spirit of
[20:03] meekness you can't go after him and and
[20:06] claim to be uh uh trying to rescue their
[20:09] soul and and I'm just trying to help
[20:11] them and I'm trying to do them some good
[20:12] but yet you're you're abusing them in
[20:14] the process you're disregarding how
[20:16] sensitive a soul can be and their
[20:18] experience and what they're going
[20:19] through it's not rescue them at all cost
[20:21] it's restore them with the spirit of
[20:24] meekness and he says considering thyself
[20:27] considering your own self think about
[20:29] yourself as you restore this person
[20:32] restore such a one in the spirit of
[20:33] meekness considering thyself lest thou
[20:35] also be
[20:36] tempted so if we are to learn to be
[20:39] neighborly to others our judgment must
[20:40] be right if we're going to we ask the
[20:43] question who is my neighbor if we're
[20:45] going to learn who our neighbor is then
[20:46] we're going to have to have the right
[20:47] kind of discernment because he says
[20:49] considering thyself if you that are
[20:51] spiritual restore such a one with the
[20:53] spirit of meekness consider in thyself
[20:56] the reason why you ought to do it with
[20:57] meekness is your considering yourself
[21:00] contemplate your own
[21:02] Humanity think about your own weaknesses
[21:05] I know we don't like to do that but we
[21:06] ought to think about our own weaknesses
[21:08] contemplate our own uhh uh Humanity even
[21:11] consider our own past
[21:14] failures before we rush arrogantly into
[21:16] someone else's problem and begin to try
[21:19] to deal with it I think if we would just
[21:22] uh consider ourselves we would
[21:24] immediately go from confronting someone
[21:26] to addressing something
[21:28] right when you confront something the
[21:30] very fact that you're confronting
[21:31] something it's aggravated already that
[21:33] that that implies I'm going to meet this
[21:35] with some kind of force I'm already
[21:37] agitated I'm coming into this I'm going
[21:38] to confront it and it's aggressive and
[21:40] and it's hostile but if you address
[21:42] something something it's completely
[21:44] different so a spirit of meekness is the
[21:46] ability to address a difficulty not just
[21:48] confront it because if we if we confront
[21:51] a difficulty every I should get a big
[21:53] hearty amen so you're already primed get
[21:55] ready to clear your throats when we had
[21:57] when we conf front something what we
[22:00] begin to discuss from that moment on is
[22:02] the
[22:03] confrontation am when you confront an
[22:06] issue you're talking about the
[22:07] confrontation you're just talking about
[22:09] how this person raised their voice and
[22:10] how you're overreacting and how you're
[22:12] doing this and hours can go by and
[22:14] you're just talking about the
[22:15] confrontation you've never actually
[22:17] talked about the issue right and that's
[22:20] the difference that's something we can
[22:21] glean from this very scripture that when
[22:23] we want to consider our ownselves when
[22:25] we have a spirit of meekness we're going
[22:26] to go to address something not conf conf
[22:28] fronted and when we address something we
[22:30] can continue to address it and not deal
[22:32] with the Fallout of how we confronted
[22:35] it and so when we consider our own
[22:37] selves we contemplate our own weaknesses
[22:39] the fact that we failed before I've made
[22:41] that mistake I know what it's like to be
[22:42] in that pit I know what it's like to go
[22:44] down from Jerusalem and be accosted on
[22:46] the way to Jericho I know what it's like
[22:47] to be discouraged I know what it's like
[22:49] to think well maybe I could just sit at
[22:50] home and play tapes or I know what it's
[22:52] like to to feel uncomfortable feel like
[22:54] you're alone and be rejected I know what
[22:56] that's like and then you begin to think
[22:58] become empathetic I know how that person
[23:00] feels I know what they must be going
[23:02] through and that's what will you can
[23:04] achieve the right kind of meekness to go
[23:05] to one who's been overtaken in a fault
[23:09] and this is what Paul picks right back
[23:10] up in verse three if for if a man think
[23:13] himself to be something when he is
[23:15] nothing he deceiveth himself right wow
[23:18] that is a
[23:22] mouthful if a man thinks he's something
[23:24] when in reality he's nothing he deceives
[23:26] himself
[23:29] self-conceit what Paul is addressing
[23:31] here when a man thinks himself to be
[23:32] something self-conceit hinders our
[23:36] sympathy and being unable to be
[23:38] sympathetic we can never be empathetic
[23:41] it hinders our sympathy and then it
[23:43] stops us from helping so he's saying ye
[23:46] if you see someone overtaken in a fault
[23:48] you who are spiritual restore them in
[23:50] the spirit of meekness consider
[23:52] yourselves because if you think yourself
[23:54] to be something when you're nothing you
[23:56] have deceived yourselves right and in De
[23:59] being deceived yourselves you can't be
[24:01] helpful to someone
[24:03] else remember the lawyer asked the
[24:05] question who is my neighbor and he asked
[24:07] it to justify
[24:09] himself why he had engaged in this very
[24:11] thing that Paul is saying you can't he
[24:13] thought himself to be
[24:14] something he began to think that he was
[24:17] better than everyone else when a man
[24:19] thinks himself to be something that
[24:20] means he's better than the one who's in
[24:22] Fault Paul said ye who are spiritual
[24:25] restore the one who's been overtaken in
[24:27] a fault but do it in a spirit of
[24:29] meekness consider your own selves think
[24:31] about yourselves because if you think
[24:33] yourself to be something if you think
[24:35] you're better than the one who's made
[24:37] the mistake you deceive yourself right
[24:40] if you think you're more spiritual not
[24:43] saying spiritual but if you think you're
[24:45] more spiritual than the one who made a
[24:47] mistake you deceive yourself if you
[24:49] think you're above making that mistake
[24:51] you deceive yourselves and this really
[24:54] depicts the attitude of that certain
[24:55] priest and the levite who walked by they
[24:58] walked by and as they walked by their
[25:01] judgments of this one were look at this
[25:03] guy look at the mess he got himself into
[25:07] and thought of all the times the
[25:09] hundreds of times they had walked that
[25:10] path because this is something that
[25:12] virtually every commentator will remark
[25:14] Jesus used these actors in This Parable
[25:16] because they would have been the ones
[25:18] that most frequented that road they
[25:19] would have been common Travelers on that
[25:21] road and here goes the priest by says
[25:23] I've traveled this way dozens of times
[25:25] and never ended up in that condition and
[25:28] the levite walks by and takes a look at
[25:30] him and says man how many times have I
[25:32] done this and I've never been befallen
[25:34] he must have acted in a way where he
[25:37] deserved it he probably was asking for
[25:39] it oh he's just reaping what he sowed
[25:41] and they had this attitude this Pious
[25:43] attitude as they walk by and you might
[25:45] say well Aaron you you're sure uh
[25:47] reading a lot into that Parable I just
[25:48] know what Jesus had to say about him
[25:50] before and after what did he always call
[25:53] them often call them Hypocrites yeah
[25:56] Matthew 23:13 but go to use scribes and
[25:59] Pharisees
[26:01] Hypocrites and he often remarked about
[26:03] the pious and the religious in that day
[26:05] how that they would the way that they
[26:07] acted was so hypocritical I was reading
[26:09] some of the burns that Jesus really put
[26:11] on them back then I thought man that is
[26:14] you might as well get out the ointment
[26:16] you don't have enough melaluca oil for
[26:18] that the just CU how he said it my the
[26:21] way that he was tearing into their
[26:23] attitude of how Pious they thought they
[26:25] were and how religious they figured they
[26:27] were and says man you to all ends of the
[26:29] Earth to make one proelite then you just
[26:30] make them twofold more trial of Hell
[26:32] after you're done right and he was he
[26:34] was calling out their hypocrisy says W
[26:36] unto you scribes Pharisees and
[26:38] hypocrites and the word hypocrite when
[26:40] it was used by Jesus it means
[26:42] actor it means a a stage
[26:46] player one who is on the stage acting
[26:49] one who's pretending one who does things
[26:51] for pretense but there's no substance
[26:54] it's all show it's only when they're on
[26:56] stage oh you make these great prayers in
[26:59] front of people and you always do things
[27:00] when everybody's watching and and and
[27:02] you're always putting on a show so the
[27:04] Optics look good and everybody thinks
[27:06] everything's holding everything's right
[27:08] and everything's charismatic and
[27:09] everything's moving on just right but
[27:11] when it's behind closed doors when
[27:12] you're all alone it doesn't matter then
[27:15] say what you want act how you want do
[27:17] what you want and everything's just on
[27:19] for show and he said this is the problem
[27:20] with these Pharisees this is the problem
[27:22] with the pious they they they they'll
[27:25] avoid the wided tombs but inside they're
[27:27] unclean
[27:29] even liken them to wided
[27:32] tombs and a hypocrite is one who is a
[27:36] pretender one who's just
[27:39] acting and so the challenge is if you're
[27:43] spiritual then think more
[27:47] deeply think think spiritually if you're
[27:50] spiritual think spiritually consider now
[27:53] how you would want to be
[27:56] treated consider how what what happened
[27:59] so that this person is in this situation
[28:02] that they're
[28:03] in instead of just berading them for
[28:06] that being in that condition instead of
[28:08] just rushing in and and giving an
[28:10] analysis of the crime scene maybe you
[28:13] could ask yourself what got them there
[28:17] how did they get there to begin with not
[28:20] not immediately begin to talk about why
[28:21] they're in the ditch and they're beat up
[28:22] and they're bloody but think begin to
[28:24] think something must have led them to
[28:26] this place there was a series of events
[28:29] there was things that happened that got
[28:31] them in the place where they are now
[28:32] it's not just that one day overnight
[28:34] someone makes the decision and their
[28:36] life ends up in ruin but if you're more
[28:38] sensitive to how a person got to where
[28:40] they were then you could be more Meek in
[28:42] the way that you would address the
[28:43] situation that they can be
[28:46] restored you're considering them by
[28:49] considering your own s and I in being
[28:52] spiritual then you could have you have
[28:54] the benefit of being able to be uh
[28:56] introspective look at your own self
[28:58] consider your own self when Paul says ye
[29:00] which are spiritual consider yourselves
[29:03] he's actually saying ye which are
[29:04] spiritual are really the only ones that
[29:06] have the ability to do
[29:08] so those who are not spiritual cannot
[29:10] look inside themselves cannot examine
[29:12] themselves cannot see themselves uh um
[29:15] under the magnifying glass of the of the
[29:17] word of God they're they're always uh
[29:19] inflating themselves they're always
[29:20] looking at themselves better than they
[29:22] ought to and so Paul is addressing the
[29:24] spiritual saying you are the ones who
[29:26] can consider yourselves so be spiritual
[29:28] enough to see your
[29:29] bias be spiritual enough to overcome
[29:32] your own Prejudice to uh to get over the
[29:34] stigma and and recognize the real need
[29:36] that's being
[29:38] presented because if you
[29:41] restore and and and this is how the
[29:43] scripture strikes me restore such a one
[29:46] in the spirit of meekness considering
[29:49] thyself lest thou also be tempted in
[29:52] other words if you restore without
[29:54] meekness then you will be
[29:57] tempted if you don't consider yourself
[29:59] and you don't restore the right way then
[30:01] you set yourself up for the Temptation
[30:05] yourself if if any of us have just a
[30:07] moment to reflect in our own lives we
[30:10] could probably think of an example when
[30:11] we were very quick to judge somebody
[30:14] else very quick to offer our help but do
[30:18] so incorrectly and find ourselves right
[30:20] in the same mess
[30:22] ourselves I'll use a I'll use an analogy
[30:25] that's that won't offend anybody you see
[30:28] a sister baking a cake you're like
[30:29] you're not supposed to do that you do
[30:30] that you're going to do this and this is
[30:32] going to happen the things it's it's not
[30:33] going to rise and it's you're going to
[30:35] make a big mess and you and then you
[30:36] walk away going oh it's like that
[30:37] sister's never been in a kitchen before
[30:39] you all sorts of things to say about
[30:40] them and then the very next time you go
[30:42] to make your
[30:43] cake what happens exactly what you said
[30:47] would happen to the other person's cake
[30:49] and you and I'm sure we could maybe
[30:51] maybe it wasn't a cake maybe it was
[30:52] putting up a tent or whatever it might
[30:54] be there's different things that we've
[30:55] done in our lives where we judge
[30:57] somebody and we laugh laugh at them we
[30:58] scoff at them maybe even we we really
[31:00] not very kind in the way that we address
[31:02] the situation and we turn right around
[31:04] and we're doing the same thing ourselves
[31:05] we're kind of like oh man don't I feel
[31:07] sheepish I I'm in the same mess this
[31:10] scripture is setting forth the principle
[31:13] that if you do not address somebody the
[31:15] right way and you do not uh when I in
[31:18] identifying one who's overtaken in a
[31:20] fault and if you think I've ventured far
[31:21] from this Parable the Good Samaritan
[31:23] we're thinking about a certain man who
[31:25] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho
[31:27] brother Bram place this one who as as
[31:29] one who is backsliding we as a church
[31:31] have a responsibility over those that
[31:35] backslide backsliding isn't the process
[31:37] where we sift out who seed and who's not
[31:40] backsliding is the way that we're like
[31:42] glad we got rid of them did you notice
[31:43] service was a little bit better tonight
[31:45] because those people weren't here that
[31:47] that's not that's not how we look at it
[31:49] we should have this Instinct in our
[31:50] hearts that we would want to see the
[31:52] backslider be given an opportunity to be
[31:54] restored not because of weakness but
[31:56] because of strength yes we desire that
[31:59] because we believe there is only one way
[32:01] of Salvation we don't walk the watch the
[32:03] backslider run off and go oh well maybe
[32:05] they'll find Salvation somewhere else we
[32:07] are gripped with a a hunger in our
[32:08] hearts a desire in our heart and a love
[32:10] for that person thinking oh my there is
[32:12] no other salvation there is no other Joy
[32:15] there no is no other bomb there is no
[32:16] other rest there will be no peace until
[32:18] they come back to this and so we don't
[32:21] look at somebody who's Fallen away with
[32:23] this attitude oh well we don't have any
[32:25] responsibility so this what I'm focusing
[32:28] on right now I haven't left my thought
[32:30] on who is your neighbor but I'm wanting
[32:31] you to ponder this if you don't approach
[32:33] something the right way you can't just
[32:36] run up to the the the the man on his way
[32:38] down from Jerusalem to Jericho and
[32:40] manhandle him and beat him and kick him
[32:42] around and mistreat him you've got to
[32:44] have the kind of care that Christ
[32:47] has because if you don't you set
[32:49] yourself up to be
[32:51] tempted in Job chapter 36 and13 it says
[32:54] but the Hypocrites in heart Heap up
[32:56] Wrath
[32:58] now that's
[33:01] powerful the hypocrite is storing up
[33:03] God's Wrath against
[33:05] them if we behave hypocritically if we
[33:08] haven't considered our own selves if we
[33:09] engage in judgment carnally then we're
[33:12] actually putting ourselves in the
[33:14] position to be judged
[33:16] ourselves Jesus says in Matthew 7: 1:5
[33:20] judge not that you be not
[33:25] judged for with what judgment you judge
[33:28] ye shall be
[33:29] judged and with what measure you meet it
[33:32] shall be measured to you again I I I
[33:35] think that's plain
[33:36] language the way you judge somebody else
[33:39] is the way you're going to be judged
[33:41] whatever measuring stick you use to to
[33:44] say that something falls short you ought
[33:46] to be willing to measure yourself with
[33:48] the same stick because you will be and
[33:51] and That's a classic way that people
[33:53] will measure something say oh measure
[33:55] even measure the message and say oh it
[33:56] falls short
[33:58] because they apply the scientific method
[34:00] they apply some kind of thought
[34:01] discipline to it they say it falls short
[34:03] but they will not apply it to their own
[34:05] thought process if you're going to apply
[34:07] it to the message apply it to the
[34:10] Bible and so it's said whatever judgment
[34:12] you meet out it shall be measure to you
[34:14] again and why beholdest thou the moat
[34:17] that is in thy brother's eye but
[34:20] considerest not the beam that is in thy
[34:22] own
[34:24] eye I I I it may even be translated
[34:27] differently it's used in other places
[34:29] word there the moat it's a
[34:32] sliver just this the Splinter you're
[34:35] looking at your brother and you're like
[34:36] oh come here let me now come closer yeah
[34:41] what is that in your eye you've got a
[34:43] splinter in your eye and the Very
[34:45] language that's being projected here is
[34:48] that you are you're beholding the sliver
[34:50] the Splinter in your brother's eye but
[34:52] you haven't considered that you've got a
[34:55] 2x4 sticking out of yours
[35:00] you're getting right down there let me
[35:02] what what is that in your eye and the
[35:03] other guy's going whoa whoa watch out
[35:05] with that Tu by4 there watch out with
[35:07] that beam and that's the picture that
[35:09] Jesus is trying to paint he sometimes
[35:11] used this dramatic uh way of example
[35:15] just to get people to see you you can uh
[35:17] swallow a camel and strain on a
[35:20] net and so there's a way that he's
[35:22] wanting to get their attention you get
[35:24] hung up on a sliver in your brother's
[35:25] eye but you're not even considering J as
[35:28] Paul said consider thyselves but you
[35:30] consider not the beam that is in thy own
[35:32] eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother
[35:35] let me pull out the moat of thine eye
[35:37] and behold a beam is in thine own
[35:41] eye how can you be seen
[35:44] correctly how can you actually be
[35:46] judging and Discerning and figuring out
[35:48] there's a sliver in someone else's eye
[35:50] when you've got a beam in
[35:53] theirs in your own you have a beam in
[35:56] yours he says Thou
[35:58] hypocrite First cast out the beam out of
[36:01] thine own eye and then Thou shalt See
[36:03] Clearly cast out the moat out of thy
[36:06] brother's eye a that
[36:08] beautiful he he's not he's not setting
[36:11] forth a proposition that we ought not to
[36:13] uh remove someone's sliver from their
[36:15] eye he's not saying it's wrong to see
[36:17] when someone's in need it's not wrong to
[36:19] say that a brother has a a moat in their
[36:21] eye what he's saying is that you're are
[36:23] inable and inadequate when you're
[36:25] judging somebody else wrongly when you
[36:28] haven't judged yourself and dealt with
[36:30] your own weakness your own shortcomings
[36:32] and approach the situation with the
[36:34] right kind of
[36:36] spirit whatever judgment you meet out is
[36:39] a judgment you'll be judged with judge
[36:41] not that you be not judged for what
[36:43] judgment ye judge ye shall be judged
[36:45] Paul said if you don't do it in a spirit
[36:47] of meekness you will be
[36:51] tempted how many have heard the phrase
[36:53] that's like the pot calling the kettle
[36:56] black now I learn this till just a few
[36:58] years
[36:59] ago but that that phrase the pot calling
[37:03] the kettle black it stands for the truth
[37:07] that the pot is seeing its own
[37:09] reflection in the
[37:11] kettle it's not that the pot is black
[37:14] and the kettle's black and who's the pot
[37:16] to call the kettle black when they're
[37:18] both black but rather the pot is
[37:20] beholding its own blackness in the
[37:22] kettle oh wow it's seeing its reflection
[37:26] and looking over at the this shiny
[37:29] Kettle and since it sees
[37:32] itself it calls the kettle black not
[37:34] realizing it's its own
[37:36] Blackness
[37:39] wow and that's exactly what Jesus is
[37:42] talking about when someone looks at the
[37:43] moat the sliver in someone's eye and
[37:45] doesn't realize they have the beam in
[37:46] theirs maybe once the beam is removed
[37:48] from yours they might not have a sliver
[37:51] in
[37:52] theirs the pot calling the kettle black
[37:54] is seeing weakness in somebody else
[37:56] identify a problem in somebody else
[37:58] being willing to call it out but not
[38:00] realizing you're seeing your own
[38:02] weakness and your own problem and this
[38:05] is this is just part of humanity this
[38:07] isn't a condition that's unique to
[38:09] Christians it's not a condition that's
[38:10] unique to North America it's not a
[38:12] condition that's unique to any
[38:13] particular language this is
[38:15] Humanity all of us have this bias all of
[38:18] us have this weakness and as Paul is
[38:20] saying considering thy own self as we're
[38:22] looking at this hypocritical nature of
[38:25] even these Pharisees and these Levites
[38:28] as if we're if if we are going to be
[38:30] spiritual enough to be the right kind of
[38:33] neighbor then I want to look at this
[38:35] human nature for a moment just from a
[38:37] the scientific
[38:40] standpoint because it's very
[38:42] fascinating there's a number of studies
[38:44] that have been performed that show that
[38:47] individuals that would be you people
[38:49] like you and I consistently rate
[38:51] themselves above average compared to
[38:54] everyone else across many different
[38:55] spectrums and so you ask somebody a
[38:57] question are you more likely or less
[38:59] likely are you above average average
[39:01] below average and so you can ask a
[39:03] person a question and more often than
[39:05] not a person's going to think they're
[39:07] above average in many different
[39:09] categories when you ask them uh if they
[39:13] they they they they usually will take
[39:14] credit for successes but explain away
[39:17] failures the the common the average
[39:19] person does this they assume they're
[39:21] more likely than their peers to to
[39:24] experience the good things in life and
[39:26] avoid the bad so you could ask somebody
[39:28] brother are you more likely to avoid bad
[39:31] things in your life and experience good
[39:32] things or more likely to experience bad
[39:34] things and avoid the good things so oh I
[39:36] I generally can avoid bad things and
[39:38] experience good things how would you
[39:39] rate your ability to enjoy the good in
[39:41] life versus this brother's ability to
[39:43] enjoy oh I I do a much better
[39:45] job and that's what's being asked you'll
[39:48] take so that that project that was done
[39:51] uh um would you would you say that you
[39:53] were more likely the reason why it was
[39:54] so successful or would it be your
[39:56] brother's um worked oh no it was I
[39:58] really I really did a good job on that
[40:00] that was that was all mine the same
[40:02] group did this and failed so why did
[40:04] this fail oh well that wasn't me that
[40:06] was that guy's
[40:07] problem this is how we just act as
[40:10] humans we'll actually rate ourselves as
[40:12] more moral and less self-interested than
[40:16] others and there's many of many of these
[40:19] categories I could use just to get you
[40:21] thinking how that we typically see
[40:23] ourselves better than others just
[40:26] instinctively
[40:27] that if something succeeds we get the
[40:29] credit if something fails well it was
[40:30] somebody else's
[40:32] fault and these researchers have found
[40:34] that even if you explicitly explain this
[40:37] bias to people before prompting them
[40:39] about it they still claim they're less
[40:42] susceptible to that than others you say
[40:45] listen all right it's a human tendency
[40:47] and a human weakness to think that
[40:49] they're better than somebody else it's
[40:50] just a human mechanism in the mind it's
[40:52] a bias and not everybody's really
[40:54] conscious of it and so they tend to rate
[40:56] themselves better than somebody else so
[40:57] that's like a human problem so I'm going
[40:58] to ask you do you think you're better
[41:00] than somebody else and they like yeah
[41:02] yeah yeah I I do it's like they don't
[41:04] even even after they've been told
[41:06] they've been warned you have this
[41:08] weakness you have this problem it's
[41:10] still so ingrained in the thought
[41:12] process that even when they've been
[41:14] primed for it even when they've been
[41:15] prompted for it they'll still claim and
[41:17] they are you sure you're not just
[41:19] viewing yourself better because of this
[41:20] bi oh no no I I don't succumb to that
[41:23] bias no no that my now my brother on the
[41:26] other hand oh you should meet my sister
[41:29] she's really bad about that but me no no
[41:32] I'm I no I may have been adopted I don't
[41:35] know but everyone else in my family
[41:36] they've got that problem but me no I'm
[41:39] just uh just humble me you
[41:42] know just humble me yeah I don't have
[41:45] that
[41:47] problem again I just want to use some
[41:49] examples to get you thinking about this
[41:51] we're talking about who is my
[41:53] neighbor it's our perception of others
[41:55] how we deal with others how we deal with
[41:57] with difficulty in our own family with
[41:58] our with our loved ones with those that
[42:01] we're in fellowship with we're part of a
[42:03] broader Community you realize that right
[42:06] we're we're we're more than just people
[42:07] who gather from our places of work and
[42:09] our houses to a place of worship and and
[42:12] we have church here no we are we are
[42:14] part of a broader Body of Christ in
[42:16] Arizona there's dozens of churches we
[42:18] have a responsibility in that context we
[42:21] have a responsibility in the context of
[42:23] those who naming the name of Christ do
[42:25] you realize we claim to be Christi our
[42:27] own bad behavior puts a bad mark on
[42:30] everyone else who claims to be a
[42:32] Christian amen and we want to point our
[42:34] fingers at the denominations all day
[42:36] long and say well they do this and they
[42:37] do that how have we how have we in our
[42:39] own behavior and attitude towards others
[42:41] profane the name of
[42:43] Christianity and the public opinion poll
[42:45] of Christians in Maricopa Valley is
[42:47] going down not because the
[42:49] Baptist but because of us wow we
[42:52] represent that we we're we're part of a
[42:55] much broader community that
[42:57] this isn't a secret society this isn't
[42:59] Dungeons and Dragons or whatever else
[43:01] there is these days and we're not just
[43:02] playing uh you know World of Warcraft in
[43:05] our basements and part of this a group a
[43:07] secret clan that nobody knows about we
[43:09] disperse from here and we're part of
[43:11] many different communities on many
[43:13] different levels we have a
[43:14] responsibility to them to think
[43:17] correctly to act correctly to judge
[43:19] correctly and as we're we're just
[43:21] looking at this human weakness just to
[43:23] reinforce this an example of how that we
[43:25] think about ourselves uh in a more
[43:28] positive light and we're susceptible to
[43:30] this bias take a personality
[43:33] test anybody taking a personality test
[43:35] before an assessment test what happens
[43:38] whenever the we get the results from the
[43:39] assessment test we always agree with the
[43:41] Positive
[43:43] attributes they a leader a problem
[43:47] solver willing to help others we're like
[43:49] oh my goodness gracious how did they
[43:52] know me I thought this was
[43:54] Anonymous and you're just like this is
[43:57] amazing how they can pinpoint this
[43:59] you're even looking around going look at
[44:01] this Vindication I can't believe born
[44:03] leader this that and then it and then
[44:05] you go to the negative attributes
[44:07] impatient doesn't work well with others
[44:09] oh yeah yeah no and you immediately
[44:12] begin to deny or reject the the results
[44:14] of the test we only focus on the
[44:16] positive things and agree with it and
[44:18] then we actually deny the negative
[44:20] attributes so we all agree the
[44:22] personality test with the personality
[44:24] test when it says all the positive
[44:25] things about us but we disagree the
[44:27] negative things and maybe you haven't
[44:29] done a personality test but you'll do it
[44:31] with your birth
[44:32] sign oh I'm Aquarius Aquarius or this
[44:35] and they that and they're this and
[44:36] they're that and then they're this and
[44:38] they're that like well you know I'm on
[44:39] this side of the moon and I'm on this
[44:41] side of the Sun and I was I'm a late
[44:43] Aquarius I'm I'm an earlier one you know
[44:46] or my new birth changed all of that but
[44:49] the truth is if we're going to take the
[44:52] good you got to take the bad now I'm not
[44:54] delving in those things I I I'm just
[44:57] mentioning them I'm just referring to
[44:59] them will even do it with the meaning of
[45:01] a
[45:02] name right a name could mean wonderful
[45:06] orator and you're like yeah that's
[45:07] perfect or it could mean big mouth and
[45:08] like well no it doesn't actually mean
[45:10] big
[45:11] mouth it's the human tendency to focus
[45:14] on the positive and willing to embrace
[45:16] it as being descriptive and applicable
[45:18] to us but where we immediately reject or
[45:21] deny anything that's corrective anything
[45:23] that's disagreeable anything that would
[45:25] be considered to be negative that's just
[45:27] human
[45:28] nature and they have a phrase for it
[45:32] within maybe the uh behavioral side of
[45:35] Behavioral economic side it's called a
[45:36] bias blind
[45:38] spot and it's a tendency to spot a
[45:41] problem in others while denying it in
[45:44] ourselves and so we this biased blind
[45:46] spot means that you can see something
[45:48] and you see a problem in someone or you
[45:50] allege a problem but when it comes to
[45:52] you and so now it's turned around you
[45:54] say well this person doesn't do this
[45:56] well and then the questions Point upon
[45:58] you well do you do it well and you're
[45:59] well absolutely I do it
[46:01] well what they're saying is this there's
[46:03] a tendency to in somebody else see a
[46:05] weakness and somebody else see a problem
[46:07] but not see it in ourselves and I was
[46:09] going to provide uh slides this evening
[46:11] but just just felt like I wouldn't want
[46:13] to get um drawn into it but our our
[46:16] natural eye both eyes both natural eyes
[46:20] have physical blind spots that means
[46:23] there's a part in actual optic the hard
[46:26] wiring of your ey
[46:28] uh in to the brain there's a spot that's
[46:32] just not
[46:33] covered and so there's um there's a
[46:36] there's different tests you could do to
[46:38] show what how this how this blind spot
[46:40] works you could put on a piece of paper
[46:42] like a little red dot and you can move
[46:44] this piece of paper towards you to where
[46:46] it gets in the peripheral vision and
[46:48] there's a point at which that red dot
[46:50] will
[46:51] disappear but you don't see a
[46:54] hole your eye uses all the information
[46:57] around that red dot and fills in the
[47:00] blank because your ey actually is not
[47:02] getting any information from that spot
[47:03] anymore it's a it's a literal blind spot
[47:05] in your periphery and you don't have a
[47:07] black spot there your brain actually
[47:09] says well there's this around it and
[47:11] that around it and it actually fills it
[47:13] in for you so that you don't see a hole
[47:17] so our minds are wired to fill in the
[47:20] blanks where we don't see
[47:22] something and so our our brain provides
[47:26] an illusion to us that there's actually
[47:28] not a blind spot and so the mind will
[47:30] hide mental blind spots from us so that
[47:33] it Fs in the picture and it makes the
[47:34] picture complete so in a in a natur in a
[47:37] judgment sense in a in a sense in which
[47:39] we would look at others not in a
[47:41] physical sight sense in a periphery
[47:43] having blind spots but this biased blind
[47:45] spot is born from the tendency to assume
[47:48] that all things are just exactly as we
[47:50] perceive
[47:51] them but a lot of times our brain is
[47:53] just filling in information you don't
[47:55] know that you've just assumed that
[47:58] you've just added that in Proverbs 16:2
[48:02] says all the ways of man are clean in
[48:04] his own
[48:05] eyes it says all the ways of man are
[48:08] clean in his own eyes in other words
[48:10] whatever A man does he can easily
[48:12] justify it whatever he says whatever he
[48:14] does wherever he goes how he uses his
[48:15] money what he thinks about other people
[48:17] what he experiences what he puts his
[48:18] money behind whatever it is all the ways
[48:20] of man are clean in his own eyes he can
[48:22] justify everything he does but it says
[48:24] but the Lord weth the spirits amen
[48:28] and a bias this kind of bias this kind
[48:30] of weakness in our Humanity will allow
[48:32] us to create a distinction between our
[48:34] problems and somebody else's
[48:36] problems and not a positive one because
[48:39] it it blurs the discrepancy between what
[48:41] we know to be right and our
[48:44] actions with this biased blind spot you
[48:47] could be acting absolutely contrary to
[48:50] your own moral convictions but you don't
[48:51] see it and you take this moral Spectrum
[48:55] this moral Paradigm this moral prism and
[48:57] you impose that view on everybody else
[48:59] but you yourself do not act in harmony
[49:01] with it but the bias biased blind spot
[49:04] keeps you from seeing that you yourself
[49:06] are not even behaving according to your
[49:08] own moral
[49:11] code this is how one book that I'd read
[49:13] many years ago it said the brain is des
[49:16] designed with BR blind spots Optical and
[49:19] phys psych psychological it's actually
[49:22] would be um so it's Optical and
[49:25] psychological so it's the actual ual
[49:27] process of seeing sight and they
[49:29] describe it very well in terms that it's
[49:31] the Optics it's actually in the hard
[49:32] wiring that creates the blind spot but
[49:34] then there's a visual component where
[49:35] your brain is interpreting it and
[49:37] feeling in the void so he says our brain
[49:40] is designed with blind spots not just
[49:42] Optical but
[49:44] psychological and one of its cleverest
[49:46] tricks is to confer on us the comforting
[49:49] delusion that we personally do not have
[49:54] any that that's that's what the
[49:57] this this bind blind spot actually gives
[50:00] us is a sense that we don't have a blind
[50:03] spot that's nasty isn't it the blind
[50:07] spot this blind spot in you actually has
[50:09] the ability or the the the the Fallout
[50:12] from it is it gives us this comforting
[50:13] delusion that we do not have any blind
[50:15] spots they use the phrase We deceive
[50:19] ourselves the human brain deceives
[50:22] itself it plays a trick on you now it's
[50:25] doing it for your own good
[50:27] do you realize even if you move around
[50:28] the room like this that the your your
[50:31] brain actually creates order and is
[50:33] adjusting the images and creating making
[50:35] a very static smooth image because if
[50:37] you actually seeing it the way the ey is
[50:39] processing it you'd get
[50:41] dizzy it would just be a blur it
[50:43] wouldn't even make any sense that's just
[50:44] how hard your brain works to make things
[50:46] s make sense of things but then there's
[50:48] actually a way when trying to make sense
[50:50] of things that works against you because
[50:52] this psychological blind spot actually
[50:54] confers upon you this comforting sense
[50:56] this comforting delusion that I don't
[50:58] see things the wrong way I perceive
[51:00] everything perfectly I don't have any
[51:02] blind
[51:03] spots and Paul said to the Corinthians 1
[51:05] Corinthians 3:18 let no man deceive
[51:09] himself we ought to Avail ourselves to a
[51:11] greater spiritual power no wonder Paul
[51:13] said ye who are spiritual consider your
[51:15] own s we take the spirit of Christ which
[51:17] is in us and we examine ourselves we
[51:20] take the word of God through humility
[51:21] and we examine
[51:23] ourselves what we're what we're
[51:24] pondering is our attitude towards
[51:26] backsliding what we're looking at is
[51:28] even our awareness of
[51:30] backsliding in order to be
[51:33] neighborly and also to be considering
[51:36] ourselves in doing so I read this
[51:38] statement one time there's probably no
[51:40] such thing as a conscious
[51:44] hypocrite that makes sense doesn't it
[51:46] probably no such thing as a conscious
[51:48] hypocrite almost everyone can see a
[51:51] hypocrite in action except the
[51:55] hypocrite and it's what's the point
[51:57] brother Aaron what would be the point of
[51:58] even talking about the blind spots any
[52:00] one of you who drive a
[52:02] car you can't avoid having a blind
[52:05] spot what's important is that you're
[52:07] aware of
[52:08] them and a good driver is aware of his
[52:11] blind spots and therefore knowing that
[52:13] he has blind spots always takes the
[52:15] extra measure to be sure that he's acted
[52:18] in a way that's covered the blind
[52:20] spot not just quickly glancing here and
[52:23] there filling in the void filling
[52:25] information but he realizes I've got
[52:26] blind spots what's The Prudent thing to
[52:28] do when I have a blind spot a good
[52:31] driver acts in Awareness that there are
[52:34] blind spots so he'll take the extra turn
[52:36] he'll take the extra care he'll use his
[52:38] signal he won't just rely on certain
[52:40] information that's being fed to him he
[52:42] takes the extra step to be sure that his
[52:44] blind spot is
[52:49] covered you following me so far
[52:52] amen all right I'm going to I want to
[52:54] read three just a few stat to you I said
[52:57] three maybe four here quotes and the
[53:00] Lord just has been piecing these
[53:02] together of the last month or so as we
[53:04] studied this and I just saw the Holy
[53:06] Spirit begin to weave them
[53:08] together because we're talking about our
[53:10] attitude and our awareness of
[53:12] backsliding and I'd want you to be aware
[53:14] of our
[53:15] own or for us myself to be aware when
[53:19] when are we the
[53:20] bruised when are we the
[53:23] Bruiser am I spiritual enough to be the
[53:25] bomb
[53:26] brother Brown in the message a
[53:27] secondhand robe he said on the onto
[53:29] Jordan they went talking about Elijah
[53:32] and Elisha and we we type the Bride As
[53:34] Elisha
[53:35] right he said they crossed over and
[53:37] Elijah said now what will you do what
[53:40] you what will you that I do for you he
[53:42] said a double portion of your spirit to
[53:44] come upon me he knowed he had a work to
[53:46] do he said a double
[53:49] portion now he says not just a good warm
[53:52] experience not just a good handshake or
[53:54] good fellowship with the rest of the
[53:56] church but what I want is a double
[53:58] portion of what the best what's the best
[54:00] now this ought to be our attitude I
[54:03] don't want to just a warm experience a
[54:05] good handshake a good fellowship with
[54:06] the rest of the church I want a double
[54:08] portion of what's the best thing is now
[54:10] he says I tell you when God sets a man
[54:12] for a world task he's got to have
[54:14] something better than the world's got if
[54:17] God's going to commission us if God's
[54:18] going to send us out then he's got to
[54:20] give us something better than the
[54:22] world's God
[54:24] right and if there's ever was a time
[54:26] that a double portion is needed it's
[54:28] today in the Realms of the people now
[54:31] this is his language something better
[54:33] something
[54:34] higher this isn't a shame to say this
[54:37] this isn't this isn't this shouldn't be
[54:39] a reproach to say I want something
[54:41] better I want something higher I want
[54:42] something more this ought to be the
[54:43] heart's Cry of every believer this ought
[54:46] to be the ambition of a fellowship this
[54:47] ought to be the ambition of a minister
[54:49] this ought to be an ambition in the home
[54:51] we haven't leveled off we haven't planed
[54:53] there's higher Heights there's greater
[54:55] depths there's there's things we can
[54:56] experience he says something better
[54:58] something higher he says I think Beans
[55:00] and Cornbread is very good but sometimes
[55:03] I have to reach up a little
[55:05] higher is't that wonderful Beans and
[55:08] Cornbread is very good but sometimes I
[55:10] have to reach up a little higher and we
[55:12] do that we've got to we've got to keep
[55:17] climbing something better something
[55:20] higher reach a little higher than what
[55:22] you've been eating on reach a little
[55:23] higher than how you've been fed he says
[55:25] we've got to we've got to keep climbing
[55:27] and this is the statement Israel was
[55:30] backsliding if they kept staying on the
[55:32] same
[55:33] grounds he's got to be moving on or
[55:36] moving back that's the way the church is
[55:40] if you're not moving on you're moving
[55:42] back so if you're staying in the same
[55:45] place in brother bram's words you're
[55:49] backsliding I I shared that not that we
[55:51] would use uh the Pitchfork right we come
[55:55] to church with the rake a pitchfork so
[55:57] that whenever the Hay's been given out
[55:59] you're like oh that was perfect for
[56:00] sister Elizabeth oh well yeah that
[56:01] sister's here oh yeah brother Scott here
[56:03] you go God bless you brother no you you
[56:05] have a rake bring it in onto you there
[56:08] and I needed that we look at our own
[56:10] selves if we are
[56:13] stagnated if we are going in
[56:16] circles brother B says you're backslid
[56:18] right he says you're either going on
[56:21] you're either moving or moving
[56:23] back we don't want to stay in the same
[56:25] place going around in circles this is a
[56:28] message whose trajectory takes You
[56:30] Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher
[56:32] stay in the rhythm of the word get in
[56:35] sync with the Sy Symphony walk in it
[56:37] it'll keep raising You Higher and Higher
[56:40] and Higher so we challenge ourselves
[56:42] Lord am I growing am I walking am I
[56:45] walking in light as you are in the light
[56:47] sometimes we get out of fellowship with
[56:49] somebody am I walking in the light as he
[56:51] is in the light because if I walk in the
[56:52] light as he is in the light then we have
[56:54] Fellowship one with another it's then
[56:56] that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[56:58] us from all our sins all of our
[56:59] unrighteousness as we stay in the in the
[57:02] pattern in the pace in the gate of the
[57:04] word we have to be going forward we've
[57:07] got to he says we've got to keep
[57:08] climbing if we're not climbing we're
[57:13] backsliding and that's is this is just
[57:15] one way that we can challenge ourselves
[57:18] because brother bram's taken this realm
[57:19] of backslide and he's taking it out of
[57:21] this uh the the the analytics of saying
[57:24] well you used to attend church 3. six
[57:26] times a month now you're attending 3.2
[57:28] times a month therefore according to our
[57:30] parameters and our data is telling us
[57:32] you're
[57:33] backslid and we got this
[57:35] algorithm and we' put NFC chips in all
[57:38] of your Bibles so that we can keep track
[57:40] I'm like sister Elizabeth print out a
[57:42] backslide report this month and like
[57:44] we're just like ah no look at this guy
[57:46] no it's it's more it's it's a spiritual
[57:49] atmosphere here all if we not going
[57:51] forward it's not that you've stopped
[57:53] doing this and you've stopped doing that
[57:55] and you're no longer doing this and you
[57:56] you used to go to church all the time
[57:58] you used to pay your ties you used to
[57:59] listen to this you used to do that no
[58:01] it's not this going back into the world
[58:03] it's not just beginning to doubt it's
[58:05] it's actually in our own spiritual life
[58:06] when we stagnate and we're all familiar
[58:09] with that feeling amen we know what it's
[58:12] like yeah and that's the time when we
[58:14] need to we need to uh experience a
[58:17] Reviving
[58:19] right and if you were in that state
[58:21] you'd want someone to approach you with
[58:23] meekness
[58:26] and then brother brandham addresses
[58:27] backslide in a very unique way and I I I
[58:29] feel like with the church as seasoned as
[58:32] you as Believers because it's the
[58:34] Believers that make up the church this
[58:36] is something that you could really
[58:38] catch we ought not to be more
[58:41] concerned about what other people think
[58:43] than we are about displeasing
[58:46] God because we're we're pondering the
[58:48] mental devices that influence the
[58:51] lawyer to judge himself as being
[58:54] blameless to the law but then asking in
[58:56] a justifying way well then who really
[58:58] who is my
[58:59] neighbor think about the mental uh uh
[59:02] devices that influenced the priest and
[59:04] kept him from rendering Aid the mental
[59:06] devices that actually caused the levite
[59:09] to go up and go and look come close and
[59:12] then walk away what were those processes
[59:15] those mental devices going on in their
[59:16] minds and that they couldn't overcome
[59:19] these things and render
[59:23] Aid this Parable challenges
[59:26] see you can just my alarm clock went off
[59:28] so I know I know now I've been too
[59:32] long this Parable challenges our
[59:34] judgments it really
[59:36] does it's more than just a story about
[59:39] oh isin't that Samaritan good let's call
[59:41] this the parable of the Good Samaritan
[59:43] it's more than that it challenges our
[59:46] own judgments it challenges our
[59:47] perceptions that influence our actions
[59:49] and what am I thinking what's going
[59:51] through my mind how am I arriving at
[59:52] these conclusions how are those thought
[59:54] processes keeping me from behaving like
[1:00:02] Christ
[1:00:04] these these details in this
[1:00:07] parable are
[1:00:09] significant because it challenges the
[1:00:11] believer who's coming into the image of
[1:00:13] Christ if we're going to be more
[1:00:16] Christlike we've got to be able to be
[1:00:18] challenged in such a way that we're
[1:00:20] honest with ourselves and willing to
[1:00:22] change right amen
[1:00:28] brother bam makes this statement in the
[1:00:30] church and this title to me is what it
[1:00:33] sealed it to me in catching what brother
[1:00:35] bam was saying here the church choosing
[1:00:37] law for
[1:00:39] Grace he says we notice after all the
[1:00:41] blessings had come to Israel they wanted
[1:00:43] to have a law choosing law over Grace
[1:00:47] they wanted to have something that they
[1:00:49] could do themselves this is going to be
[1:00:51] your human
[1:00:52] nature to want to have something you can
[1:00:54] put your finger on that makes yourself
[1:00:57] right some Sabbath days they could keep
[1:00:59] or some ordinance they could do or
[1:01:01] something another that was brought into
[1:01:02] them that they could do themselves and
[1:01:05] if you can do one thing to save yourself
[1:01:08] there there's not one Speck of Grace of
[1:01:10] it Grace not one Speck of it Grace if
[1:01:14] you could do something to save yourself
[1:01:15] law is what you do in regards to the
[1:01:17] grace that God has showed you by Saving
[1:01:20] you that's I think that's perfect what
[1:01:23] it works works don't save us but works
[1:01:25] works are is the outflow of a saved Soul
[1:01:28] amen so he's saying law or works is what
[1:01:32] we do in regards to the grace that has
[1:01:33] been shown to us because I am saved
[1:01:35] there's a there's a law that I can keep
[1:01:37] because I am saved there's a path that I
[1:01:39] can walk in because I am saved there's a
[1:01:41] works that I can do he says I've as I've
[1:01:44] often said I don't run
[1:01:45] around with other
[1:01:48] women he says I do not I don't run
[1:01:50] around with other women because I'm
[1:01:52] afraid my wife will divorce me and I
[1:01:53] think he's saying I do not not run
[1:01:54] around he said I Not Afraid my wife will
[1:01:56] divorce me so I don't run around he says
[1:01:59] I don't run around with women other
[1:02:02] women cuz I love my wife that's it so
[1:02:06] it's not that I don't run around with
[1:02:07] other women because I'm afraid that my
[1:02:09] wife will divorce me I don't believe
[1:02:12] that you should run
[1:02:14] around so I don't run around with other
[1:02:16] women only because I'm afraid my wife
[1:02:19] will leave me I don't run around with
[1:02:21] other women because I love my wife he
[1:02:23] said that's it I don't believe that you
[1:02:25] should run around
[1:02:26] but a law isn't what keeps me from it
[1:02:29] right my marriage vow my marriage vow
[1:02:31] it's law isn't what keeps it my marriage
[1:02:33] vow it's my love amen and that's the
[1:02:36] reason I love God not because I'm afraid
[1:02:39] he'll send me to hell I don't believe
[1:02:41] that he would do that but because I love
[1:02:43] him so much I don't want to do it
[1:02:46] there's nothing in me to make me do it I
[1:02:48] love him too much I wouldn't hurt him
[1:02:51] for nothing certainly I love him right
[1:02:55] now this is is where these biases and
[1:02:57] these Tendencies and these ways that our
[1:02:58] mind will work we ought to be more
[1:03:01] concerned about displeasing God than
[1:03:03] what others
[1:03:05] think and this this priest and this
[1:03:07] levite refused to act more likely out of
[1:03:11] what the perception would be and what
[1:03:13] the outward Optics would be other than
[1:03:15] what they knew the heart of the law
[1:03:17] required them to
[1:03:19] do and brother B saying that Israel
[1:03:21] chose the law over Grace and in choosing
[1:03:25] law there could not be
[1:03:26] Grace but us being the recipients of
[1:03:29] Grace we can Avail ourselves to Grace
[1:03:32] therefore we can be gracious and we
[1:03:34] don't just have a law that we impose
[1:03:36] upon
[1:03:37] others because we have experienced Grace
[1:03:40] we can walk in the law if somebody else
[1:03:42] has fallen from Grace we just don't have
[1:03:44] a law at our disposal to render Aid to
[1:03:48] them and he talking about it's not my
[1:03:50] marriage vow that keeps me from cheating
[1:03:52] on my wife it's actually my love amen
[1:03:56] and now watch how he de how he moves
[1:03:57] forward in this certainly I love him
[1:03:59] because he says the reason why I serve
[1:04:00] God is because I love him not because
[1:04:02] I'm afraid of hell and when men and
[1:04:04] women get to a place and this is the
[1:04:07] thought process well I really ought to
[1:04:09] stay at home and see this good play
[1:04:11] tonight but I'll tell you they'll think
[1:04:14] I'm backslid if I don't go on down to
[1:04:19] church that that's a
[1:04:21] mouthful that's real that's real
[1:04:24] Discerning brother brandom
[1:04:26] I don't really want to go to church but
[1:04:28] if I
[1:04:29] don't I'll be preached
[1:04:33] against I don't really want to go to
[1:04:35] church but if I don't if I don't go
[1:04:39] they'll they'll know I'm not at church
[1:04:40] they'll think I'm backslid they'll start
[1:04:42] texting me they'll hit me up on Snapchat
[1:04:44] and next thing you know I'm having to
[1:04:45] deal with all this fall back Fallout
[1:04:47] because I didn't go to church so I'll
[1:04:49] just go to church because I don't want
[1:04:51] to be a
[1:04:54] hypocrite that's a horrible thought
[1:04:56] process before you go to church and it's
[1:04:59] brother brandom who identifies it I
[1:05:01] should stay home and watch TV tonight I
[1:05:03] should stay home and watch Netflix I
[1:05:04] should stay home tonight I don't really
[1:05:05] want to go but they'll think I'm
[1:05:07] backslid if I don't go down to church
[1:05:09] now with that thought process in mind
[1:05:10] the person's afraid of being perceived
[1:05:12] as backslid but ask yourselves aren't
[1:05:15] they all ready right right so brother
[1:05:18] bam says and you sat there and sleep
[1:05:21] anyhow you might as well stayed home and
[1:05:23] looked at something you'd enjoy more
[1:05:27] woohoo
[1:05:29] wow that hits
[1:05:31] hard and the and the way that I wanted
[1:05:34] us to process it is how the back the the
[1:05:38] thought process well if I don't go I'm
[1:05:39] backslid you're already backslid in your
[1:05:43] thinking what a horrible way to approach
[1:05:45] church that I'm just going so that
[1:05:46] nobody you know the attendance
[1:05:49] takers you know don't Mark me as absence
[1:05:52] and then brother Aaron's going to run
[1:05:53] the report at the end of the month and
[1:05:54] I'm going to be on the back slid list
[1:05:56] cuz I fall out of the algorithm that
[1:05:58] says you got to be there you got to be
[1:05:59] car do you carry a 4.0 H what are you
[1:06:01] carrying on
[1:06:02] Sundays I made Magna cumladi in our
[1:06:04] church attendance last
[1:06:06] month this isn't Sunday school we don't
[1:06:09] have a you know a board with a bunch of
[1:06:11] stars somebody was apologizing to me
[1:06:13] because they missed church I said look
[1:06:14] we're here to serve not take
[1:06:18] attendance and I think we need to really
[1:06:20] be challenged in the way that we think
[1:06:22] sometimes and if I could say this to us
[1:06:24] let's never create the kind of culture
[1:06:27] where somebody shows up to church
[1:06:29] because they don't want to be looked
[1:06:30] down upon by
[1:06:32] us let's create the kind of culture that
[1:06:34] when somebody's at home thinking about
[1:06:36] watching something that they would enjoy
[1:06:38] they remember the love that they're
[1:06:40] shown here and they'd rather be here in
[1:06:42] this environment around the people of
[1:06:44] God who love them and don't judge them
[1:06:46] and they come
[1:06:49] am let's not create the kind of culture
[1:06:53] that puts the pressure on people to
[1:06:55] perform and to achieve a certain status
[1:06:57] and to live a certain way to where they
[1:06:59] just fall right in line and they
[1:07:01] everyone's doing the thing that they
[1:07:02] ought to do but what are they we're all
[1:07:03] just Hypocrites we all just gather on
[1:07:06] the stage of Arizona believer church and
[1:07:09] we all just play our part and then we go
[1:07:11] home and we don't live overcoming lives
[1:07:13] and we're discouraged and we're not
[1:07:15] being living fulfilled and all the
[1:07:17] Fallout that comes from that let's not
[1:07:19] make that
[1:07:21] mistake says you and you sit there and
[1:07:23] sleep anyhow you might as well stay home
[1:07:25] and look at something you'd enjoy more
[1:07:27] isn't it wonderful to hear this quote on
[1:07:29] a Wednesday night when you're
[1:07:32] here then he says but when your joy
[1:07:35] becomes the Lord and the Lord is your
[1:07:38] joy you can't stay away from the church
[1:07:40] then you're getting somewhere right he
[1:07:43] said the church was in better shape 40
[1:07:44] years ago for the coming to Lord Jesus
[1:07:47] than it is tonight way better they were
[1:07:49] closer to God they had more God among
[1:07:51] them they had more Spirit among them
[1:07:53] than they got tonight and what's the
[1:07:55] dynamic that brother brandham identified
[1:07:57] the pressure at
[1:07:59] church and the hypocrisy of the
[1:08:03] individual the attitude well if I don't
[1:08:05] show up they'll think I'm backslid now
[1:08:07] they weren't wrong about
[1:08:09] that right brother R said they weren't
[1:08:11] wrong but there was something wrong in
[1:08:13] their own experience where they backslid
[1:08:23] already brother Bram says in the message
[1:08:28] thirst sister Elizabeth if you could
[1:08:30] come and play this creates the
[1:08:33] expectation of a closeth when you ask
[1:08:35] the musician to come now I could have
[1:08:37] already told her honey it's going to be
[1:08:38] about 20 minutes of you
[1:08:41] playing but I've created this
[1:08:42] expectation now he's closing now and
[1:08:45] since brother Michael did a wonderful
[1:08:46] job I got an extra 10 minutes with the
[1:08:48] song
[1:08:49] service brother says let me tell you
[1:08:52] something this is the message thirst
[1:08:54] when you're worshiping God in this
[1:08:55] spirit and in
[1:08:56] truth so we We Begin by worshiping God
[1:08:59] in spirit and Truth he says when it
[1:09:01] becomes a custom for you to do it
[1:09:03] because you think you ought to do it
[1:09:05] because you think if you don't shout or
[1:09:07] jump up and down or dance with the music
[1:09:09] your neighbor's going to think you're
[1:09:11] backslid you are drinking from a
[1:09:13] stagnated
[1:09:15] stream when we're at one time worshiping
[1:09:17] in spirit and truth but then we become
[1:09:19] more conscious about other people around
[1:09:21] us or it becomes accustomed to do it or
[1:09:23] you think you ought to do it or think if
[1:09:25] you don't worship a particular way
[1:09:27] you're going to think that your your
[1:09:28] neighbor's going to think you're back
[1:09:30] well why aren't they dancing why aren't
[1:09:32] they shouting why doesn't that sister
[1:09:33] ever speak with tongues I've never heard
[1:09:35] her scream before and then you get oh
[1:09:38] well if I don't they're going to think
[1:09:40] I'm backslid that's the wrong kind of
[1:09:41] atmosphere that's being
[1:09:43] created the worship actually creating
[1:09:47] pressure and performance anxiety where
[1:09:50] someone feels like they're on a
[1:09:52] stage and now I've got to worship like
[1:09:54] everybody else and then it's it's not
[1:09:55] genuine anymore from the
[1:09:58] heart you're afraid that your neighbor
[1:10:00] is going to think you're backslid he
[1:10:02] says you're drinking from a stagnated
[1:10:04] stream he said until it fills every
[1:10:06] fiber until the Holy Spirit itself is
[1:10:08] bubbling in you I don't care whether the
[1:10:10] music is playing whether they're playing
[1:10:12] near my God to thee or whatever it is
[1:10:14] the holy spirit still ringing the glory
[1:10:16] bells in your heart that might speak
[1:10:19] with he says that brings Glory Bells
[1:10:21] your hearts that's satisfied that's
[1:10:23] God's satisfying portion anything less
[1:10:26] than that you are
[1:10:28] done says you might speak with tongues
[1:10:30] like men and angels you might give all
[1:10:32] your good to feed the poor you might
[1:10:35] prophesy you might have knowledge
[1:10:37] understand all the Mysteries and all
[1:10:38] these things and you still become
[1:10:39] nothing First Corinthians 13 until that
[1:10:42] satisfying something that can only
[1:10:44] quench that
[1:10:46] thirst my soul thirst for the Living God
[1:10:48] like the heart panting for the water
[1:10:50] Brook unless I can find it I'll perish
[1:10:53] when you get to hungry for God like that
[1:10:56] something's going to take place the holy
[1:10:59] spirit is to lead you to those great
[1:11:01] Fountains of
[1:11:04] God I love how brother brandom
[1:11:07] identifies these different ways that we
[1:11:08] can be
[1:11:10] backslid all because we're worried about
[1:11:13] what other people think I'm going to go
[1:11:16] to church cuz if I don't they'll think
[1:11:18] I'm backslid I'm in to worship a
[1:11:20] particular way because if I don't
[1:11:22] they're going to think I'm backslid and
[1:11:24] this whole idea of trying to conform to
[1:11:26] other people's expectations their own
[1:11:29] experiences their own anecdotal
[1:11:31] experiences the the things that they've
[1:11:33] gone through we try to conform to that
[1:11:35] we try to meet that expectation we try
[1:11:37] to walk in the pattern of somebody
[1:11:38] else's story of how they did this and
[1:11:40] they did that we're falling short of the
[1:11:42] real privilege of being a son or
[1:11:44] daughter of God that's led by the spirit
[1:11:45] of
[1:11:47] God don't allow this to become a custom
[1:11:50] don't worship just because you're afraid
[1:11:52] of what the other person would think
[1:11:53] allow everyone else to have have a
[1:11:55] genuine expression of worship allow
[1:11:57] other people to express their love to
[1:11:59] God in their own personal way allow
[1:12:01] yourself to come to church with a hand
[1:12:03] ready to serve instead of a hand out
[1:12:05] don't be judgmental don't have dog
[1:12:08] dogmas come into our own hearts and our
[1:12:09] own lives we're being challenged with
[1:12:13] this
[1:12:14] parable are we the man going down from
[1:12:17] Jerusalem we could
[1:12:19] be if we're thinking more about what
[1:12:21] others think than what God
[1:12:23] thinks we could be if we're not going
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:29] forward CU brother braham's pointing out
[1:12:31] what it means to be backslid you can
[1:12:32] just be stagnant going in circles could
[1:12:35] be because you're offering pretense
[1:12:37] everything's on the stage it's acting
[1:12:39] the Bible say there's a way which seeth
[1:12:41] right unto a
[1:12:42] man but the end thereof are the ways of
[1:12:46] death all the ways of man are clean in
[1:12:49] his own eyes and there's a way that
[1:12:51] seems right but that way is the ways of
[1:12:57] death we could be
[1:13:00] backslid in one of these definitions
[1:13:02] right not going
[1:13:05] forward allowing ourselves to engage in
[1:13:07] a thought process that indicates our our
[1:13:10] judgments aren't where they should be
[1:13:11] our value isn't where it should be but
[1:13:13] then also it could be in how we treat
[1:13:16] others it could be in how we play the
[1:13:19] part of the priest or the levite instead
[1:13:23] of the part of the Samaritan let's stand
[1:13:25] to our
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:46] feet let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:13:48] of Prayer
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:56] our gracious Heavenly
[1:13:58] Father Lord as we close this service
[1:14:02] tonight we've had a wonderful time
[1:14:04] together as family around your
[1:14:06] word we've been challenged we've laughed
[1:14:09] together we've thought of our own
[1:14:11] mistakes Lord we've thought of how we've
[1:14:14] been mistreated Lord how we've
[1:14:15] mistreated
[1:14:17] others and now Lord we ask that this
[1:14:20] holy spirit that you've given us this
[1:14:22] great gift that we've received could
[1:14:25] have more Liberty in our
[1:14:27] lives that it would heal us of hurts
[1:14:29] that cause us to judge others
[1:14:31] incorrectly Lord that it would take any
[1:14:34] Pride any false humility any
[1:14:36] hypocrisy and it would bring it low make
[1:14:39] it subject to the word of God we humble
[1:14:42] ourselves to you as on a Potter will
[1:14:44] tonight Lord asking that you break us
[1:14:46] down any bias any judgment any correct
[1:14:51] incorrect values Lord anything that's
[1:14:54] perverted our per ception of others
[1:14:55] father we lay them
[1:14:57] down and I ask Lord that you take us
[1:14:59] tonight and just Lift us up and our
[1:15:02] hearts cry tonight as a church and for
[1:15:04] the many that are unable to be here
[1:15:06] tonight for the many who are here
[1:15:08] tonight Lord our hearts cry is we want
[1:15:10] to climb
[1:15:11] higher we're reaching for something more
[1:15:14] Lord Beans and Cornbread are good and
[1:15:16] there's no uh no disagreement with what
[1:15:18] we fed on there's no disparagement of
[1:15:20] what we fed on Lord there's no uh uh
[1:15:23] casting down or crit ISM of what we fed
[1:15:25] on but Lord we want to reach
[1:15:27] higher we know there's more we want to
[1:15:30] climb higher we're instructed in the
[1:15:31] word that if we aren't climbing higher
[1:15:33] we're moving
[1:15:35] back so Lord we reach forth now we reach
[1:15:39] higher we want to go higher we want to
[1:15:40] feed on things higher we pray that you
[1:15:42] wouldd help us to do so Lord if there's
[1:15:45] been any mechanism in our minds or in
[1:15:47] our hearts Lord if we've created the
[1:15:49] kind of atmosphere in the way that we
[1:15:52] interact with other people to where
[1:15:55] they're being motivated to come to
[1:15:56] church merely because they're afraid of
[1:15:57] being called a hypocrite Lord may we
[1:15:59] change the atmosphere Lord may we change
[1:16:02] our attitude may we change the way that
[1:16:04] we approach
[1:16:06] Church Lord if we've actually created a
[1:16:08] an atmosphere in worship and a way that
[1:16:11] we approach a song service or the post
[1:16:12] service where we try to get people to
[1:16:14] worship a particular way because we're
[1:16:16] afraid we'll be considered a hypocrite
[1:16:18] or we're afraid the service will be too
[1:16:19] dry we're afraid people think the spirit
[1:16:21] of God didn't move oh Lord break down
[1:16:24] these biases Lord L break down these
[1:16:26] human mechanisms father that you might
[1:16:28] have
[1:16:29] Liberty that you can move in our hearts
[1:16:31] and move in our
[1:16:32] lives Lord we're learning from this
[1:16:35] Parable we're learning as your Holy
[1:16:37] Spirit leads us and we thank you Father
[1:16:40] for the lessons which are being taught
[1:16:42] may they be made applicable father may
[1:16:44] they be added to our faith Lord that we
[1:16:47] could use them and I pray father that
[1:16:50] they'll mean something tomorrow on a
[1:16:52] Thursday
[1:16:53] afternoon they'll mean something on a
[1:16:55] Friday
[1:16:57] evening they'll manifest themselves on a
[1:16:59] Saturday morning Lord not just in church
[1:17:03] but when it really counts commit the
[1:17:05] people to you tonight
[1:17:06] Lord bless them I pray in the name of
[1:17:09] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
