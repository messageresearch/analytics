TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to continue on the subject that we are on Wednesday night on manifesting your measure of Glory this is a continuation on the uh Heaven's mystery Earth's Glory series that brings into view the kingdom and we'll start with Numbers chapter 14: 21 I'm just going to jump right into this as if we're uh continuing on where we were before he says as truly as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord this is God speaking this is God swearing an oath swearing by himself as surely as truly as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord we find in the Book of Psalms where they're praying uh let the whole earth be filled with thy Glory then we read in Isaiah chapter 6 I believe it is where it says and the Earth was filled with his glory so here is God swearing that he will do it uh the Believers the the Jews and the psalmist praying that God would do it and then we see this prophecy and this uh future uh Kingdom wherein the whole Earth is filled filled with his glory and we've been taking it from future home where brother bandam teaches us the way that God redeems the Earth is the same way that God redeems the person since the person is redeemed before the Earth is entirely redeemed we see in ourselves an image of what the Earth is going to go through but then we can also look at what the Earth is going to go through and see that there's something that's in this process of redemption for us kind like what does the Redemption process bring out of us and so now we're kind of looking at these other things that come with this Redemption and it says the whole Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord and just as the Tabernacle and the temple were filled with the glory of the Lord so will the earth the Tabernacle be in a shadow in Colossians 21:17 it speaks of the temple the sacrifices the priesthood which are Shadow the feast days are shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ so we know that the temple was a shadow of what God would do in Christ we can see certain elements in the sacrifices test testifying of Christ we could see the elements of sanctification and the different ceremonies speaking of what Christ would do or what is actually embodied in Christ and so when the glory of the Lord came down and filled the Tabernacle in the wilderness filled the temple there in the day in which it was dedicated this was a an example of how that the Holy Ghost would come uh even evidenced by a cloud and would overshadow uh uh overshadow Christ and then declare I'm dwelling the glory of God is dwelling in this sun so just as the temple was a shadow of what God would do in Christ Christ was the body amen and the body is that which uh cast The Shadow as opposed to the shadow itself so when he says these were Shadow things to come but Christ is the body he's saying the body is the very thing that was cast in The Shadow and so what we enjoyed and experienced here was just in measure of what you receive in Christ it was just testifying that there is a body and this so that Christ is the body of what the Old Testament shadowed now as we read here in verse 22 of Ephesians chapter 1 it says and hath put all things under his feet the body Christ and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all and all so now as Christ embodied the shadow of the Old Testament now Christ comes and he's the fullness of the glory of God he's the fullness of the godhead bodily and he now is to be set as the head of the church and the church is to be his body so the the picture kind of develops a little bit further where Christ is the head and the bride now is the body and it says the body is the fullness of him that filth all in all to fill it it means to to to fill up to full measure to make complete in every way or to render perfect now that that speaks to a head if a head does not have a body then the head itself is incomplete and so we see some completeness in Jesus Christ but now in this image that God is wanting to achieve a bride there's a head or there's a bridegroom and there's this body and the body is what renders everything complete I hope this point comes through today that there's something to that in terms of satisfaction or fulfillment that we're looking at so Christ was the fullness we can see that Christ was the fullness but now his bride is going to be the fullness of the word of God manifesting God Glory because the body is that which renders and makes complete that fills it up Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Bram says there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church and we may we may pick up on that uh statement in Christ is the mystery God revealed in the next service it's really lengthy I don't think I'm going to have time this morning to get to it uh but think of that he says and he's speaking of Malachi chapter 4 speaking the seals being opened he's looking at all these different events and prophecies being fulfilled and he says there going to come a time when he would Express himself fully in fullness of his godhead and he says deity through his church and so that's where we're looking at is how we the body of Christ are to be manifesting the glory of God just as he did in Jesus Christ there's a lot that we're drawing from from the book of Ephesians so if you'll turn to Ephesians chapter 3 verses 8 to 11 Paul we know Ephesians parallels Joshua so the book of Ephesians is Paul teaching the word of God to place them positionally who they were in that age of course that would to me it makes a lot of sense if this is uh Ephesian age is even going to once that church age sets in that's going to be the first church age and he's a messenger to that age this is positionally placing the Bride of that age it's a it's an important uh view that brother bandam gives us when he says Ephesians parallels Joshua cuz here's a prophet trying to positionally place the believer who's already in the promised land trying to place him where they belong in that promised land and in verse eight he says unto me who am less than the rest of All Saints is the grace this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and the the he he is counting this as a privilege to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ and it's among the Gentiles to the Gentiles and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ so there was a mystery that was hid in God this is Heaven's mystery this is a mystery that lingered throughout the Old Testament but now Paul is saying that I'm preaching the unsearchable riches of the Messiah among the Gentiles and this is a mystery and he's wanting all to have a fellowship in this mystery so this is a mystery hidden by God but it and it has something to do with the Gentile bride he says I'm preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ among the Gentiles that all men might uh see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which God from the beginning so from the beginning of the world and creation are by Jesus Christ but for a purpose and for a goal because he says to the intent in verse 10 thinking of this The unsearchable Riches of Christ The Fellowship of the mystery which was hidden in God from the beginning who created All Things by Jes Jesus Christ and it's as if Paul is saying it was hid and God in the beginning it was a mystery when all things are created but it's part of it's part of the mystery of creation says to the intent that now for the purpose that now for the goal that now unto the principalities in powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord so this uh manifestation of the wisdom of God is according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus we're coming down to God's ultimate objective that God who is this unknown God this mysterious God a God who expresses himself in light and a God who expresses himself in a bodily form but yet just there's no one expression that can truly tell all that he is just in one glance so God is working throughout all time in history to place where now now through the work of Jesus Christ now I can declare my glory the manifold wisdom of God one translation renders it this way and it's just so beautiful so that now through the church the fullness of the wisdom of God might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the Heavenly places I catch how that emphasis is that it's not that it would might that the wisdom of God would be known to you but that you would make known the Manifest wisdom of God the fullness of the wisdom of God would be declared by you to all powers and principalities we are raised up seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and that's a realm HHH spiritual wickedness in high places uh uh rulers of the darkness and there's powers and principalities in that realm and so God now has gone through this process so that now now through the bride the fullness of God's wisdom can be declared and manifested to all spirits to all ungodliness to all unbelief to all principalities and Powers manifesting the mystery of Heaven on Earth good and so the wisdom of God the mystery of God is to be manifested in his body and I I I I'm just going to make reference to this because it's a much larger thought so you are going to be declaring the glory of God you're that's what your life is now it's for the purpose of making God known now Christ in this sense I I want to be careful just how I say this Christ was a preview of The Bride because in him there's there's some there's things expressed in this firstborn among many Brethren and he's this example and he set for us an example so when I say that it might be just the way that I phrased it might be a little odd but he was declaring as a wave sheath this is this is what's to come there's more to come so in Christ there is a shadow too or forecasting of of more to come because he even says Greater Works will you do and brother bandam said that's a divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in the day by the son the groom it's the flesh today by the bride he says in another place it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the same self flesh she is him self same persons so there's this is that fullness this summing up this completeness so Paul continues after saying that through the church is to be the the fullness of the wisdom of God is to be cleared by his body we picked this up in verse 14 of the same chapter and excuse me if my voice is a little a little rough as just as I mentioned on Wednesday just fighting through some things and I feel very strained in my voice this morning says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the rich of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man amen and follow these words very closely that Christ I'll read it all and then we'll go back through it that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God Amen that you might be filled with all the fullness of God so the image of being rooted in love in Christ dwelling that having been rooted in love and now Christ dwelling in your hearts there's this process to where we come to comprehend every Dimension to say the breath is just the full extent of the length depth and height not just to know that it has Dimension and not just to know that it's deep or not just to know that it's big but to to comprehend the breadth of all these things we can say there's a three-fold purpose of Christ and and I so there's the length the height and the depth well I want the breadth of the three-fold purpose I don't want just a little Glimpse here and a little Glimpse there and say well I've kind of sced together three I want to know the breath as the scripture says may be able to comprehend with All Saints the breadth and length and depth and height right so it is in this knowing the love of Christ being rooted in love Christ dwelling here's that secret Christ Christ dwelling in your hearts by faith in knowing the love of Christ we will be filled with all the fullness to be filled it means to make full to fill up to render full to complete every particular so it says if if there was a bucket list or a checklist that's that's when it's filled when every box is checked if there was a measure and it had to reach a line that's when it's filled it's a realization of the goal that you might be filled with all the fullness and when it uses the term fullness it means that which fills or with which a thing is filled so that you might be filled fully with God that you might be filled with all the fullness of God filled even unto all the fullness of God as God is full there's something that's to happen to the individual who has Christ dwelling in the hearts by faith being rooted and grounded in love that there's a there's something that's to come forth and this is the old ultimate objective as you read this that you might be filled with all the fullness of God according to our capacity amen according to my measure according to my limit uh whatever whatever extent I can be filled up to whatever measure I can let me be filled this is the ultimate objective let me be filled according to my capacity with the Divine wisdom and knowledge and love of God and consider this in Colossians 2:9 and10 it says for in him dwelleth all all the fullness of the godhead body that's Christ and then it says and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power so if that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith so Christ dwells in Your Heart by faith and in Christ was all the fullness of the godhead bodily so Christ is to dwell in Your Heart by faith and in him is all the fullness of God so there's got to be some sort of mathematics Divine mathematics that we need to come to to realize well I'm just going to accept it that even even though it may be by measure it's a fullness of Christ if the fullness of the godhead bodily was in Christ and Christ is dwelling in me then there's a fullness for me to manifest is not the goal and ambition of of Our Lives to be Christlike amen for the Life of Christ to have preeminence in us and a reign in us to to when we make decisions and we respond to circumstances and in all things we're demonstrating the character and nature of Christ I can say that this is where we're at if you've been filled with the Holy Ghost where we are is this place of coming to a full surrender a place of total dependence upon him to so that we can manifest him now Paul continues in chapter 4 we find that there's just this consistent theme through Ephesians 3 or through the book of Ephesians it continues into chapter 5 and chapter 6 and yet we won't refer to those uh this today but there's there's obviously these themes in there but it says says in Ephesians 4: 111 12 and 13 and he gave some these are gifts he gave gifts to men some Apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers these gifts now are for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ it's not for the perfecting of the gifts of the ministers it's not for the edifying of the ministers but it's for the perfecting of the Saints so there's a perfecting of our lives and there's an edification which is a building up God has sent gifts into his church and they've been in this church since the very beginning of the Christian Church who's been ministering gifts that are for the sole purpose of building up his body through Gifts of prophets and pastors and apostles and teachers and evangelists therefore the the building up of the body and the word is going to be preached until notice verse 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith so that's a a very Hefty statement the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God so through the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God we're being edified and built up unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that he says later that we may grow up into the head we're to grow up to fill up to the head to come to that full measure the same likeness and the same image so the goal is as brother preach it the stature of a perfect man this is the full measure of Christ the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ the word of God is to build us up to that place we can grow to the measure of Jesus Christ brother Bram says and modern events are made clear by prophecy and he says I'll meet you in one place the place I put my name because we're seeing Christ as this the knowledge of the Son of God a perfect man the measure and statute of the fullness of Christ Christ he said that's in Jesus Christ that's where God put his name there's the only place he'll meet you and it's in Christ is the word the same yesterday he says it's growed from the feet thighs now this is the image of growing now into the head and now it's in the head fixing to go so this is Rapture time manifesting in full measure the bride the same as the groom so the bride the body is his the bride is his body she is his voice and and it's not just a little part she's the full measure manifesting in full measure the bride the same as the groom so here's Christ the word made manifest in the days as brother said as the sun and now today the bride is to manifest in full measure Jesus said to them in John 5:39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify me he was was the word made flesh amen he's the mystery of the written word revealed God interprets his word by bringing it to pass my just take the Old Testament pick it apart diagram it chart it do everything you can to try to figure out who the Messiah is and no matter what you come up with there's no better interpretation then Jesus Christ who lived it he was the written word revealed he says search the scriptures you testify to have eternal life in the scriptures it's the scriptures that testify of me because I am the embodiment I'm the body of the shadow of the letter I am the body of what these words were forecasting he was the mystery of the written word revealed and in the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother brand and the kind of in the beginning is talking about how that he always finds his messages by prayer be sitting in prayer and something's revealed to him he thinks on it a little bit he says he can just feel it kind of get closer and closer then sometimes I keep waiting till it breaks into a vision he says but when it begins to come and I'm satisfied it comes from God then I go to the scripture and so as as as he goes through that process no matter how that inspiration may have struck he kind of lays it out there may be reading his Bible kind of runs the concordance he sees maybe some scof filled notes maybe he's reading from some of these other Scholars and and and something's coming to him as he as some inspiration comes and he's reading no matter how it happens he says he finds his messages by prayer it can't just be by inspiration alone it can't just be by uh uh um you know kind of getting a little bit of a fi and he has a process he's describing to us very interesting that he would kind of open this up to us but the thing he begins to hone in on is he says I go to the scripture and and so no matter how how it would come and then how it would be uh supplemented he's got to come back to the Bible and he says when it begins to come I I go to the scripture that is it ought to be the confirmation of every spiritual thing that's done the Bible should be the the confirmation of it because the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ I'm using this statement for a very reason we find a lot of places says this Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ we believe that it's Jesus Christ in written form it's God in letter form he says because the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ you see it is his body it's a little bit different little bit different uh emphasis it's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ he says but it is his body so it speaks of something about who he is Old Testament spoke about who he is now the whole Bible Old Testament New Testament he says it is his body and the message the super sign says oh God if the world could only see that God and man are one the super sign was that first man that God come could come into that's the super sign the first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church super sign God and man and and and we say God and man Christ but now God and man you God and man together that was to be the Super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days well how is it the entire Bible's going to be fulfilled in the last days you going say well the last days are all that culminates in even to the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven but there's something he's looking at that in the last days the entire Bibles to be fulfilled and what is the Bible it's his body and who are you you are his body so there's a filling up in these last days there's a measure that's to be manifested there's a there's an objective and a goal that God has had in his heart from the beginning that's finally going to be satisfied he says in the unity he says do we come into the unity of the faith now if I could say it this way the unity of the faith first and foremost I I the way that it most often strikes me because it says till we all come in the unity of the faith is that our faith would be United and that we would have unity in our faith and I think there's that's just the way that it most often almost always would strike me is that there's this Unity of Faith amongst the Believers and and I think that there is there is that un Unity of Faith but yet this is individualistic to us that we in the unity of the faith is it's it embodies the Oneness of us with the word of God the unity of the faith is a uniting of the Oneness between you in the word like there's this harmony this Oneness this Faith this cohesion this mixing together of you with the word of God whatever your measure is uh because when it comes to the the the every man has been given a measure faith and each one of us have different gifts and callings we have too much carnality uh in our minds to to try to figure out what the unity of the faith looks like say well you know you're this and you're that so I need to be this and I need to be that or you've experienced this and you've experienced this you've manifested this you've manifested that and somehow the unity of the faith is when we all just all of a sudden at 11:56 one morning we just all spontaneously start doing synchronized dancing I just all of us immediately we just start doing the same thing we're like hey you like this isn't this good that's not what it's talking about it's talking about you and the word harmonizing you've got a part to play you've got a part to play and together it'll all it'll all be work in harmony to God's word so I'm wanting to First and foremost for you to think is that the unity of the faith is to bring the fullness it's that Oneness of you and the word as Jesus said in John chap 10:30 I and my father are one this Oneness brother Ram talks about it Harmony this harmony that existed between the Father and Son now exists between Christ and his bride as Christ was and I'm using the word very Loosely a shadow or preview or prefigure Christ was a fullness the bride is to be a fullness Christ said I am my father one and even pray that they may be one even as you and I are one there is going to be then a Oneness or fullness that's manifested in the bride with Christ he which is the fullness of the godhead bodily having preeminence in his bride brother bam there's so many statements to this effect and I know if we've read these a lot I think repetition will be okay this morning and the sermon the seed is not air with a shook he said but when you come to say I am my father one amen now this is Jesus said I am my father one and they picked up stones to Stone him but now when you come to say I am my father one when the bride begins to recognize her equality when the bride begins to recognize her position when the bride begins to stand up and know that it's not H uh that this isn't something this is what Christ paid for people say I am his body I am him I am bone of his bone life of his life flesh of his flesh and to say that with some sort of confence to believe this is what his purpose was in the beginning this is who I am I'm not ashamed of it and to not let any man with the three-pointed club try to beat you down and take you away from that but to stand up and say I am my father one he says when you begin to say and these other things then the Shu pulls away from him well you know what the shuck is they don't they don't like that talk they don't want that that um uh uh that life they don't want that kind of uh pronunciation and so there's something about you coming to your position that just causes the sh to wither away amen because they've got their own take on things he says but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength she will do it that's the time that that we're living in he said there come a time in the last days when God would Express himself in fullness of his godhead brother B says it this way and what was the Holy Ghost given for I know this is a very familiar statement to you he said God is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you it's quite a quite a statement and he says adoption time I know you know I don't know if it's so much of a controversy anymore we there's always kind of a rhythm where you move on to other controversies I don't know if they're arguing over whether it's one cup at Communion or multiple cups I stay out of it but there's this adoption can be kind of a buzzword that triggers a lot of people but adoption time brother Bram says when God can pour to us his fullness so brother B when he preached on adoption hear you him and these different things he he had something very specific in his mind that he repeatedly and consistently emphasized and what would be important is that we catch his emphasis and not try to kind of Rec couch his emphasis so that kind of makes F makes sense in a bigger picture that we have in our minds just wrestle with what he said to understand what he's trying to teach and this statement here to me is so directing to what his thought was when he preached on adoption he says adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close together to Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go in the Rapture there there's a lot of there's a lot there there's a lot to kind of grab on to and wrestle with and he's saying that adoption time has something to do with the filling up adoption time has something to do with the culmination a completion a a finishing like we this is this is what it was all for to begin with and this is what I was angling for to begin with and it connects in with the change of our bodies he said this is what adoption time is is when God's fullness can work so freely through the church he even talks about how it will touch those who are in the graves and it'll raise them up and we'll all go on the Rapture together this is where Christ can become visible amongst us amen through manifestation so adoption time is is fullness time Amen in Ephesians 1:5 this is at the real heart of what Paul is preaching having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will Paul is writing this and brother bam is using this Ephesians parallels Joshua he's showing how that this is this letter is to the elect this letter is to the the saved this letter is to those who have the Holy Ghost and now Paul is positionally placing them in the promised land because we've been predestined unto adoption so there is an adoption time for the body I want to use it this way a Rapture time a climax time and so adoption time as brother says is a fullness time here adoption time when God comporn us his fullness now when we think of the adoption type there's we have our natural type of adoption where in a f a a parent uh goes through a legal process to become Guardians and legal parents of a child that was not the product of of them elves or their own Union and I guess they can have single parent adoption these days but traditionally a mother and a father would take a child who is not their own and go through a legal process to make that child legally their own and that's what most of us understand to be adoption and so we can use a language of adoption of God adopting us when we were Gentiles or Sinners or strangers and had no relationship to God but he's adopted us he's taken us out of sin and made us his own and there's nothing wrong wrong with that language there's nothing wrong with that type it's a beautiful illustration how that something that was an alien something that was a sinner something that was a strange something that had no relationship has now been brought into relationship with God it's beautiful but the adoption that brother Bram zeros in on and the adoption that brother Bram talks about he says calls it a law of the Old Testament he speaks about it being in the Old Testament and so go I challenge anyone to go in there and try to find it but he says it's a law of adoption and I'm not saying it's not there but it's just not as easy as putting in a word search like adoption Old Testament hey being AI where is adoption in the Old Testament and it's just going to spit all out the law of adoption but it's there promise you it's there so brother BS capturing a law and the principles we've been talking about the law of redemption it's connected with this this law of adoption is connected with it in terms of the land shall not be sold forever and kinship and relationship that this child a son stood to gain and inherit all that the father had the land the kingdom and and so this is what brother Brandon refers to as uh the adoption of the Old Testament so a son already a son by birth by Nature by life he would come through the process of training and tutoring because one day he's going to run it it's all going to be his so the father himself having run it for years and labored in it and wrestled with it and brought it to where it was and builder of the family name took what his father gave him and now it's a greater Kingdom and he's going to want to hand it off to his son but he wants that Kingdom to remain he doesn't want that land to be sold right he wants it to be run properly and so he's he wants to train his son to be able to take his place amen so the child is raised and trained to be just like his father right is that not what he teaches us and hear you him and these adoption messages that the child who is already his son who has his nature and his life and his character he grows up to a place where he's training that he has that nature in life he's training him to come that character when the father says you know what I trust him to run this just like me so that there could there's this transition now where he can say you just do it man you don't need you don't even need to say well my father who's your boss said to plow that field uh-uh the father says if you think that field needs to be plowed everyone in the Kingdom needs to listen to you because you've come to this place now well you would run it just like me that's the image that is brought out then brother brandham shows us how the church under the tutorship of the holy spirit is being taught they're learning they're growing this is what has happened through the church ages Holy Spirit the tutor within the church individually within us and the sermon Christ has revealed in his own word he says it's God himself it's becoming to a place I just love how he says becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through right then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam's was at the beginning it's always been God it's God himself in the church and he's been becoming manifest and growing to a place he's governed the body and then as he's governed it then the complete body of Christ is to be revealed in the form of a bride and then the image he wants to see the bride that was taken out of the side just like the woman was from Adam and what was she everything Adam was there was or there was nothing the woman was that Adam wasn't already that Adam hadn't already been so when she steps forth from his side co-equal co-ee equality they were they were there there was Oneness there was Unity there was Harmony they were he said this is bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh there was this likeness there was this compliment to her and this is this is harmony this is Unity this is equality Coe equality is what begins to resonate in my mind that there there's govering all the way down to where God finally brings forth a bride that is co-equal to Christ am it's the process of redemption it's the this the law of adoption and listen to this I want to hit this just real quick God just directed me in this I know it may seem like a little interesting area to open up into but I think every time we can touch on these things that can build a bigger picture uh through all the different times we could just Shine the light on it a little bit but he says in the law of adoption now this is the law of adoption when it came to a son who is born of that father he was the father's DNA the father's genes he had the father's name it said this is in that law of adoption he says the law of adoption made him equal holder with his father now catch this emphasis of equality then another place he says he was adopted he was just equal had the authority over all his father's Goods so this is a equality is a theme of adoption where you're raised up to equality raised up to Oneness and Harmony and unity says in another place and then the father had a ceremony of adoption he adopted his own son into his own business and then the son was co-equal with his father in other words I love this if it had been today the son's name on the check was just as good as the Daddy's you know what that means right you don't need to cash a check that somebody else signed this me it doesn't mean that the son had to go to the father say h yeah so if you could do me a favor if you could just sign here and then I'll go ahead and fill in who the vendor is and date it whenever it comes time he could sign the checkbook himself he can sign you have a need sign it are you listening your name on the check is just as good as your daddy's in other words it's on your own authority the church is raised up to a place where she can speak she can speak the word like Adam did at the beginning you ever thought about what Adam did in the beginning Adam didn't run around the garden saying in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right come on he spoke and it obeyed he spoke and it obeyed what happened when brother Brandon manifested The Creation in the temporary manifestations of the third pole he didn't invoke a name he had a life behind the words he said let there be and there was what was it sh full Authority coming back into the bride it was showing us that there's going to come a time when the bride will stand on her two feet and say I am his life I am his life and I can speak by power not try to be some sort of enchanter I speaking in tongues and yelling the name of Jesus sometimes I think we have to be careful when the the songs that we worship to and and I'm not saying anything against this song at all but sometimes one of says I speak Jesus I'm wondering what in the world does that mean to you and I think they literally mean I speak Jesus right right that that's what they say that they're just thinking there's something to Jesus right and that that's all you got to say is just say Jesus and there's something magical in saying it now if you're getting nervous I don't I guess it's fine may may Jesus calm your nerves but we know there's more to it than just a pronunciation I'm wanting to get deeper that when we say there's healing in the name Why on when we say there's power in the name why it's not a magical arrangement of syntax and vocalization that makes it power and healing it's not did you know Jesus is is is some sort of Fanatics that makes it work why I want to get to the W why that's where the success is going to be in this time that we're living in now is Lord I want to know the why I want to know the depth I want to know the breaths hallelujah hallelujah it's a time when the son's name on the check was just as good as the daddies now I want to just really get you thinking as we bring this to a close brother brand in the sermon a hidden life says God spoke out this is my beloved son I I can't remember if it was Wednesday or Sunday that we touched on the Transfiguration I want to finish in that area a little bit here he says this was my beloved Son hear ye him God adopted his own child into the family did you know that Jesus Christ was adopted not by Joseph and Mary but by God himself hear me no longer but this is my son who takes over from here on am now I know there's a lot of teaching that can go into that to place what brother Benham taught on that but then he says that adoption is near the time in parable of the church that adoption this Mount Transfiguration adoption and notice where brother brandom orients that because we know that on and we'll come to it here in a moment that on the Jordan River the father came to dwell in the son and that Dove John saw the dove descending upon him but he doesn't point to that as the adoption of Christ he points to mount Transfiguration as the adoption of Christ and he says that adoption is near time in parable of the church in other words that time is now it's adoption time it's a parable of the adoption time for the church now it's time for that he says it's time for that amen hallelujah and here's that here's that turn now let's drop back to the hidden life and find out what this is going to required to get into this place of adoption so there's this requirement he said it's time for the bride to manifest the fullness of his glory if I can say to finish that work there's a lot of themes there in finishing the work to take to take over that's what it's going to be in the Millennium it's what's it's going to be forever is Christ and his bride ruling and reigning there's no appeal to God right right you thinking about this yes there's no appeal like right now we pray we appeal there's a sub where there's a subjection to his will but there's going to be a day when it's not like search the scriptures and find out what's going to happen next no all power all authority all Divinity all glory all Dei is being manifested through Christ and his bride this is it there's no higher [Music] appeal so this fullness we're talking about manifesting your measure of Glory he said let's drop back and find the hidden life that's going to take to require this place to get to this place of adoption so let's just catch very quickly this hid life but let's pick up where brother bram's looking at this on this Mount Transfiguration in Matthew 17:5 he says while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them this is after six days and they're taken up to a high mountain apart and his reignment did shine as the sun as this Glory radiating and a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son and whom well pleased hear ye him everybody makes a statement in one place where God witnessed the same thing on Mount Sunset that's a lot to think about Hallelujah Mount Transfiguration was the adoption of Jesus Christ is what he teaches us now if adoption has to do with fullness now I I don't want I I not going to be very much longer I know that's vague but I'm not going to be very much longer but if I could just kind of say some things drawing on what you know about the message of the hour brother M taught that God adopted his own son that day on that mountain and then he talks about how that then he went to Calvary um and the the immediacy of it it's not that it had to happen the next morning but this is the next because all power and authority is given into him this is so now he's come to a place where he can he could take that last step he could do that final act that was required of him and so this adoption of Christ is part of this culmination this Climax and I want to emphasize it this way that the when we think of adoption it h it relates to the Holy Ghost fulfilling its objective in you fulfilling its purpose in you because in Matthew chap 3:17 it says at the Jordan River when he's baptized and lower voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased so we know that the father comes to dwell in him the Holy Spirit as it was comes to dwell the word is made flesh Heaven and Earth Kiss and they Embrace so now the Holy Ghost the or God has been dwelling in Jesus Christ from that moment and Jesus is fully conscious and aware of this indwelling a and there's this unity and there's this harmony and it brings him to a place on Mount Transfiguration not where he gets the Holy Ghost but now there's this declaration of satisfaction CU what does the Holy Ghost do in Matthew chapter 4 soon as the spirit descends upon him and the father dwells in the son in Matthew chapter 4 says immediately he's then he was led of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted there's your holy ghost in Jesus Christ leading him teaching him instructing him doing only what the father says saying only what the father says to do and so he's leading him he's LED of the spirit and when he comes up onto that mountain it's the it's the product of Jesus showing he would do that which pleased the father amen brother Braham says this in the position of a believer in Christ he said th this is my beloved Son hear ye him and it's he's drawn from Matthew 17 and Mark 9 fulfilling every law that the Old Testament required think of that fulfilling every law that the Old Testament required remember how this book is his body and the last days the entire body Bible is going to be fulfilled in the last days now he's saying that Christ there's there there's this image of every law that the Old Testament required this law of redemption this law of adoption these laws that were in the Old Testament Christ is now fulfilling them why because adoption is this point it's a time of fulfillment amen adoption speaks of a time of consummation when I gave you a tutor I gave you the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is for a specific purpose and when it achieves its objective when it achieves its purpose then that's the time of adoption it satisfied it need so when that son came to a place of adoption you kind of have to be uh very careful with your type here but when that son came to a place of adoption the tutor had done his job the tutor had done it the the the son at that point when he's now heir of all things he's been trained to a place where he doesn't have to say oh hold on excuse me tutor could you help me he's like no you got this right yes that's why when the bride leaves the Holy Ghost leaves it's it's it's done it's finished it's done job there's no more use for it in the earth anymore cuz that's what it was for Amen to bring us to a place of adoption and rapturing Grace brother B says now for nearly 2,000 years God has been making in him a masterpiece because he struck Adam to get a piece off him part of a rib part of him a rib to make a wife for him and now that perfect Masterpiece he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all really that's all just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled the new and old is husband and wife and it took the old to for show the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill the Old to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece in the making now now does that mean the bride through the other ages had has fulfilled anything no that's not it at all it's just saying there's going to be an everything that's fulfilled in this last days amen the bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece is in the making he fulfilled the old now we're to fulfill the new amen he had a work to do we've got a work to do now it's in him both to Will and to do of his good pleasure to finish the work and just as that Spirit Led Christ from from that Jordan River Into the Wilderness to be tempted the bride every bride member must have the Holy Ghost amen and it's the T tutor it's the inside teacher bringing us to a place of equality if I can say this a place of manifestation think whenever it was we dealt with adoption most recently Wednesday or Sunday and how that if you because I want to have Grace and different understandings and perspectives of what adoption may be but if you believe that right now you are fully placed fully adopted son of God by the new birth then that's wonderful then you know what God's doing now is bringing you to a full Revelation and understanding of what that means amen good am and so now your adoption is being adopted right or it's being revealed to you it's being made clear you're it's becoming more evident and you're walking into a manifestation of it if you're fully placed fully adopted then there's a maturing into what that means and what that is and in this hour into the filling up the filling up of what this age represents now that's one way of looking at it and and and I think God can work with you and that understanding to realize there's growing there's maturing that brother bam was talking about in that Spectrum or another way as brother bam taught it is that now that we have the Holy Ghost he's bringing us to a place deeper greater more precise more particular in growing our understanding we're growing up into him and he's bringing us to that place of fullness of equality of understand knowledge to know to that place of climate Max and culmination a place of adoption now Romans 8: 10 and 11 let's drop back to the hidden life and find out what this is going to require to get into this place of adoption I got 10 minutes to get through this in Romans 8: 101 and if Christ be in you if Christ be in you what a supposition the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness the body is dead because of sin and and and the body is in a in a sense owned by death because of sin still subject to death because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you come on think of this if Christ be in you I've got this dead body body this dead weight but the spirit is life because of right because of sin mind and body are bowed down but the spirit is life and he says so if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you the same Spirit which is the spirit of God the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in Christ now Christ dwells with me he had it without measure I've got it by measure Without Limits cuz he says if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen that quick means to make alive to cause to live to invigorate and the word picture that's created by this Greek word that's us it's of seeds being quickened into life where there's this germinating and this springing up and this growing and we ought not just to take this image of us who have the spirit in us and then we weak we grow old and we die and we're buried in a grave and our body's laying there and this says oh one day that spirit is going to come and Quicken that body it's not putting it into a resurrection at a later date it's saying right now this body is dead because of sin but if the spirit that dwells in you is the same spirit that was in Christ that Spirit right now is able to Quicken this Mortal body it's able to do something to this mind it's able to do something to this flesh right now I can Quicken your mortal bodies The Same Spirit shall Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you it's a quickening power now in the acts of the Holy Spirit I hope you're catching this I know I've covered a lot of ground I'm going be told later today that was a lot there's I know it covered a lot of ground brought in a lot of different principles maybe a lot of things uh uh that hope you didn't get hung up on just trying to bring bring out of the message of the hour the way brother brandom taught it not change it we're looking at the hidden life to find out what this is going to require to get to this place of adoption this is the Holy Ghost dwelling in you a hidden life brother Bram says in the acts of the holy spirit this is the acts of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit then abides in and grows daily just grows making itself greater and greater pushes out the things the cares the Temptation and as you overcome them the Holy Spirit takes its place this is what it's doing the Holy Spirit abides in you and grows daily becoming greater and greater what's it pushing out things the car is the Temptation and as you overcome them the Holy Spirit takes its place it's growing yes it's becoming from a place where the soul is fully redeemed but now it's growing and it's pushing out Temptations and cares and things and as you overcome it the Holy Spirit takes its place this is this is advancement this is Conquering this is growing the that the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead it raised a dead body back to life how much more can that Spirit dwelling in me now Quicken this Mortal body which was dead because of sin but now life because of righteousness can live and reain in this body I read it on Wednesday night in never presentent water from the rock what we need today is not pray for more power you got enough power to make an Earth what you need is Faith to use that power what you need is to control that life he said control that life well okay this is how he says control it and live such a Godly life that when you ask God for anything you'll know you know we have confidence in God of that we know if we keep his Commandments he'll withhold no good thing from us if we walk with him God walking with us oh sometimes if we feel the good hasn't come our way sometimes we feel that we haven't quite reached that Next Step that we should stop for a moment look around and make sure you're walk with him cuz he may be standing over somewhere else saying this is the way walk in it this is a step you got to take but you've wandered from him a little bit and the only way to get there's walk with him walk with him walk with him that's right keep his Commandments amen and he'll withhold no good thing when we walk with him amen amen I think that's why he lets us go through the things we do that's right so I just cling a little bit closer what we need today is not pray for more power we need Faith to use that power the Bible says faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God Amen we need the word now more than ever amen we need the word pure we need it straight we need the word preached we need the word cuz Faith comes by hearing we don't need to pray for more power by the new birth you got more power you got power enough to create and make a new Earth create a world and go live on it but you have to have faith to use that power and where are you going to get Faith from the word not even from more power good more power is not going to bring you more faith the word's going to bring you more more faith amen H this is just to Spur the moment riffing so this could get interesting but right now if an earthquake opened up and swallowed all the electric vehicles on our parking lot just them and them alone we'd be like oh my goodness that vindicates the truth that oil's the way to go right I mean we there we just there'd be some it'd be shocking but you know what as incredible and Powerful as that would be it wouldn't do one thing to add to your faith unless you could bring it back to the word of God I mean no matter how powerful someone right now I could walk through this wall walk back back again and you'd be like I think I saw some guy on YouTube do that right that unless you could bring it back unless the word is connected with it it's not going to give you any more faith we don't need more power we don't need no more physical demonstration what we need is the word to make our faith come to the place of demonstration we need the word to build our faith then whatever your faith can lead you to believe walk in it live it and manifest it but that faith can only come by the word it's the word he says that Faith cometh by hearing if the word preaches received then it produces Faith see he's writing there if the report is believed then the arm of the Lord is revealed what he's drawn from Isaiah there in Romans chapter 10 to whom the arm of the Lord to him that believes if the report is believed the strength of the Lord is revealed to them where is it going to how is the strength the arm of the Lord going to be used the power is there but you've got to have the believe the report you got to believe the word for the strength to be made manifest amen yes brother brand in the sermon perfect faith brother Micah you drive an electric vehicle you can come to the piano now we're going to pray that that parking lot doesn't open up I know there's a few other EVS in the church we might have to put up charging stations Glory natural types of spiritual but in perfect faith brother Bram says Jesus had perfect faith I wanted to amplify this so much we're just going to end here Jesus had perfect Faith he had it and it come because he was the word think of how what he taught in wisdom versus Faith how the power that he had and how Jesus used the power what he what he Anchored In what how he really used it he says and you become the word as you receive the word am you want more deity in your midst welcome and receive the word am it's a real real difference and just manufacturing things and and and and just kind of conjuring them up and then just bearing it or just just kind of coming up a way where it's it's carnal we're just producing it we're coming up with uh programs and ways of just binding people to legalism there's another way where you just bear it you just it's produced by the life and if you come back to the principles of the word of God and you receive the word of God then you have deity in your midst and where he is there's power there's life there's healing signs and wonders and miracles but you got to come back to that if you're going to come to the place of fulfillment I know it's a steady consistent emphasis in these things brother brandom in a little sermon he preaches I think this is one it was on the radio when he was in Los Angeles and one in a million if I've got that wrong please forgive me want to close with this he says now each one of you have the Potentials in you to deliver you for it is God since you've been planted into Christ by baptism not water baptism spiritual baptism in each one of you you have the potentials to deliver you now and I love how he says before you go well you know what Aaron you're not so bad after all he says for it's God like ah yeah that's right it's him it's him in you you since you've been planted into Christ by spiritual baptism there's power in you for you to be delivered he says now look each one of you here is standing as Believers then the life that was in Christ is in you it can if you could just see it and and I think when he says that it's not it can deliver you as he saying it it can he says if you could just see it it implies that it's hard sometimes or maybe we haven't fully seen it because he says it's the devil's business to keep you blocked off from that keep you blinded he can just let you be blinded see you don't know where you're going then with the power in you to get there but because you're blinded you won't make a step the power in you to create a new Earth but you can't get there because you're blinded right the power in you for deliverance but you can't get there because he's got you blocked off he a man that's blind cannot tell where he's going he's got to seek the understanding from somebody who can see oh this is so good until we can understand this is why Paul said I pray that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened give you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him until we can understand somebody has got to tell us what's the truth and Christ died for you and your transplanted from the world into Christ and everything you have need of is in Right In You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost isn't that right confess an amen today now the only thing you have to do is just start drinking from that you got any drinkers here today I remember my mom one time she went to she just celebrated her birthday this past week she went to a garage sale and my dad would get home from work he like a big tall glass of uh uh water you know filled with ice fill fed up with water and so she was at a garage sale and she came across a giant giant beer mug and she grabbed it she's like this is going to be perfect for my husband she picked it up and she noticed that the person R the garage sale was looking at her and she held her she says my husband's a big drinker and it didn't dawn on her till later just exactly what he thought about her husband but this is this is in that not the type of the alcoholic way but man my goodness I even bought a 64 oun water bottle to make sure I'm getting at least eight ounces 8 O eight o glasses of water a day so I can get my water to be hydrated and if you'll put that much effort Aaron into drinking 64 ounces of water if we'll carry our water bottles everywhere we go if we'll have our watches reminding us to take a sip and stand up oh come on word of God tell me to stand up when I need to stand up tell me to take a sip when I need to take a sip he says start drinking from that he says as the tree drinks it begins to push out its leaves its buds pushes its fruit each year the fruit is not in the ground the fruit is in the plant the fruit is in the plant and every plant has to drink from his Fountain as the rain comes down give that plant life life to drink from and as it drinks it grows and it's growing up until it comes to the full bud just like the church has to bloom out in this age and as we drink we grow you see that that's the H hidden life drinking growing pushing out pushing out becoming more Christlike growing maturing overcoming it can be a difficult process because it over under it uncovers layers in our lives and we have these great huge battles and things we're going through and God gives us the Victory and he shoves that off our plate like woo that was wonderful that felt so good whoa what is this it's the one that was lurking underneath that that's the next one and don't get worried look what you just came through this is the process of Deliverance don't get discouraged as a Believer today if you're fighting don't get discouraged if it seems like it's getting darker don't get worried if it seems like your battles are getting greater you're getting deeper you're getting to the boss and that what you guys do you play your video games all day you want to beat the boss at the end of the level you're beating boss after boss after boss and one day that last boss which is death you're going to put him under your feet cuz as we drink we grow drink in this message come to church drinking come to the song Services ready get here early and pray and come to the service come to the Wednesday night services and say Lord and maybe I shouldn't say this but I had a really really good good good service for this morning I said you know what I'm going to save it for Wednesday night and that's just exactly what I did I've saved it for Wednesday night but come to every service under expectation so I'm coming to drink today I'm coming to drink as I drink it's pushing something out it's pushing something out it's pushing something out drink all that it'll push out all unbelief amen hallelujah am and now I'm confused because my climax but I thought I was H this is in my notes for Wednesday night man I'm getting excited for Wednesday night he says and as we drink we grow but if the plant refuses to drink then the plant cannot grow that means the only thing you need to decide today is will you drink if the plant refuses to drink then it cannot grow I will not refuse this word I will not refuse this bread I will receive it I will welcome it I will drink from it amen if the plant refuses to drink then the plant cannot grow oh God don't let me don't let me refuse Lord to drink don't let me refuse to [Music] drink could that be our prayer today say Lord I'm thirsty I just let's just we we'll end it there let me just say something It just strikes me now I've been suffering since June with something and there's and I'm just sharing this personally I just believeing that my Deliverance is right now a lot of a lot of what they call is just dry mouth but that just exasperates things and it gets worse and worse maybe a lot of things that cause it but my mouth if I can say this is your pastor my mouth has been crying out it's been it's been aching it's been in pain it could it just be something I'm having to wrestle with in myself that speaks to a heart's cry that's in your hearts it's in your hearts that you're longing for and you want and I can say the only the the answer is to put him in you to drink him the honey that will plate the oil that will soothe it's got to be him you got to be drinking from him nothing else is going to satisfy nothing else going to Plate nothing else is going to deliver you can chase chase chase chase chase all you want but come back to him drink from him amen oh I say if we could come if just one person today could be impacted by the service to say that my spiritual drought my spiritual longings oh my prickliness oh my ups and downs oh my doubting everything I've been going through will be satisfied in drinking him if if if it's all come to this it's been worth every sleepless night and every pain be to say I know there's an answer I know there's an answer in him amen drink today amen drink and let it grow and push out push out stand with me
