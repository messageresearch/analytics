TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so matthew chapter 5 start with verse 38 and said teaching on forgiveness you have heard that if that it had been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth but i say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let them have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain give to him that asketh he and from him that would borrow thee turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you reading this again it can almost bring like this feeling of oh great you know anybody reads this then they know exactly just exactly how to take advantage of us and but i think there's a way that we can absolutely misread this he said that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth reign on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public and so but ye be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen you can be seated again we're on the subject of setting limits within the subject of barriers and boundaries and i'm just going to jump right in where we had to stop on sunday and come back to some things we had to skip over so i'm not there maybe there's going to be a lot of some review and principles but it's just necessary to do it in order to kind of close the loop on what we're ministering on on sunday and we're really looking at the setting limits is looking asking the question in light of these scriptures in luke chapter six here matthew chapter five some of the many other scriptures we could read which is speaking about the character of a christian even some of the things we see in the beatitudes and the conduct of the believer it can set a particular standard that we we might think describes a weakness or kind of a pushover mentality so we're exploring whether we are empowered by the word of god uh to set boundaries uh protective boundaries and things that kind of carve out who we are and what we're called to do and the then we're just kind of wanting to pick up where we were and this will kind of maybe add a little bit more uh context to the things that we've been speaking on through the first few parts but then also in particular on sunday that this subject is about liberty as much as it is about limits so we say well setting limits even that thought we're setting limits oh you can only go so far but really we're talking about liberty even more than we are about limits because it's the setting the limits is actually going to limit be liberating you from bondage bondage holds you back for the bond is to be stripped away and removed away it sets you at liberty so when we talk about limits immediately we can start thinking oh well there's an end to this there's a stop to this you can only go so far it's restrictive and we talked about that before how the word of god seems very restrictive and constraining and people feel bound or in bondage because of the word of god but you if you could submit yourself to the word of god there's the greatest liberty submitting yourself to the word of god all things are possible leave it to yourself well with man this is impossible so there's impossibilities uh made possible and the probable the improbable is brought very near as probable when you begin to believe god's word and submit yourself to the supernatural and if you think barriers and boundaries just even that language and those terms may feel very restricting but it's the barriers that are restricting it's the boundaries that are liberating barriers restrict us boundaries actually liberate us and galatians chapter 5 paul says and there's a lot of statements we've drawn from here in galatians that have touched on the good pride the bad pride the living for others and some of those things a few services ago he says stand fast therefore in the liberty where with christ hath made us free so there is a liberty in christ christ hath made us free you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so here is the way the truth the life that has made us free so it says say stand fast therefore in this liberty in this freedom you have in this uh liberation that you're experiencing in christ it says stand fast therefore in it and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage so there's a yoke of bondage bondage has a yoke a way of fasting in itself to you to where you are bound you are hindered you're chained as it were you become a slave this yoke is a negative yoke it is a press it is a burden he's saying you're free so being free don't return back to the yoke of bondage and the word yoke is used of any burden the yoke is this word yoke is used of any or bondage and even that of slavery so we think of a yoke of bondage that would be a negative thing right i don't know anybody sign up and request and pray for this morning lord i really desire yoka bandage and i don't know that we're praying for a yoke of bondage but yet we taught in the scripture in matthew chapter 11 verses 28 to 30 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden and i will give you rest so this idea of someone bearing something they ought not to bear something being brought down it's it's the idea of something being dragged down in a heaviness and a weight he says come on to me ye that are laden with a very heavy uh sins and burdens and anxieties and cares and you that are striving and wrestling come and i'll give you rest and as you show up to rece to get your rest you're wanting to unload of everything and you want him to give this yoke of bondage up and he says take my yoke upon you so there's it's not that you're gonna live a yolk free life is it the yolks that are bad in the eggs is that what we try to get rid of or is it the good part i i don't know anymore i do know at one time brother bram said don't live in a valley and don't eat eggs and here we are eating ecstasy living in phoenix uh and so there's he said there's a yoke you're exchanging that you have a yoke of bondage you have a burden you have a labor you have a strife and he says come and unload yourself but then he doesn't leave us burden free he says take my yoke upon you so this is used of even a burden which you ought to bear a cross that you ought to carry he who will follow me will deny himself and take his cross he says take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart remember this is the good this is connected with the good pride the way up is down and ye shall find rest unto your souls so the secret to rest isn't just getting rid of every yoke but it's taking the right one on he says for my yoke is easy and my burden is light there is a yoke of bondage that we could carry and that we we become exhausted under that it's restraining us that is a slavery to to things of the world and a slavery to the flesh and we exchange that yoke for another yoke one that is not bondage in slavery to sin or self but it's a yoke which is a burden of christ that we take upon ourselves and we actually find rest taking that yoke on and the yoke is i think it's ministered on quite a bit what that would look like on an ox or a beast of burden and even the balancing that would take place and this yoke is going to put it into an office and it's going to be able to use the strength and the inner inner energy of that beast uh to accomplish a work and a job but this is something i want you to think in the beginning that when we talk about establishing limits or setting limits it's about liberating yourself so that you can live a limitless life i know it's the paradox but it's important for us to realize there's ways that we have to do things in ways that we have to cement ourselves therefore unto god then resist the devil and he'll flee put the word of god first first the kingdom of god put the word first in all things put put things of god in your view and you're bringing yourself into the right kind of headship to experience the things of god the right way we could uh go down this line of how we are prisoners of jesus christ we are slaves of christ and we are slaves of christ by choice paul said i'm a prisoner he said he was a servant and the very word bond slave speaking of one who is a slave to christ a love slave is the term brother branham used and so we become prisoners of christ and it's by choice that we become a slave to christ and that's the framework within that god wants us to work there's a there's a there's a there's a field that god wants to work us to work within there's a way he wants us to work under headship he wants to work us to work under the headship of his word and that's where god wants us to experience liberty is under the yoke of christ and this is uh this is kind of at the heart of a lot of these things we're ministering on and sunday i'd like to examine this in greater detail but we cannot forfeit this liberty we have in christ for the sake of a family image this individual liberty we have in christ we cannot we cannot forsake that for the image of a happy couple remember the liberty that we have in christ we cannot forsake the individual liberty we have in christ for the sake of a group a group image a group power a group dynamic god has not and we're not asked to do it this seems like maybe a little bit of a paradox you're trying to struggle that well wait a minute god calls us to have healthy marriages and god calls us to be a part of the church and god wanted to become a family but notice how i said it you cannot accomplish the image that god wants you to accomplish by forfeiting your liberty and christ and and we don't recognize it but in a lot of ways we actually forsake our individual liberty and jesus christ our joy our happiness peace and all the things that the fruits of the spirit wants to bring we actually walk away from that to conform to some model that we think is what's pleasing to the lord and well the lord says we ought to do this and the bible says we ought to do this and we're just forcing ourselves to fit a particular image not really like rising we're playing more to the pretense and the politics and personality of things instead of the personal liberty of christ leading us to be a part of a dynamic where everyone has made an individual choice to submit themselves to christ and submit themselves to one another and everything is operating very very beautifully which is what happened in the book of acts and we're not just saying well we got to have this and we got to have that we need to do this we need to do that we all just do it by force that's what i want to preach on sunday though so we can't forfeit this liberty in christ for some image that we have of what christ wants by following and exercising the liberty that christ gives us and taking his yoke upon us we will step into the expression of that you're gonna you'll write another book of acts by pursuing the individual liberty that you have in christ it will be written in your life and not by trying to impersonate it in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed and in this brother brown mentions it a few times about paul being a love slave and then relates it to us and so there's some go and listen to this portion and read this portion just before this it's very very beautiful and i had to trim this down for time's sake this evening he says it's not a group it's a personal vindication of a pregnant child of god filled with the holy ghost so surrendered to god that he don't care about anything else we should say that's me hey that's me i'm a i'm a pregnated child of god the word of god is living inside of me and it's the personal vindication of you this this is this is you you have to look at this very very personally it's not a group it's a personal vindication of a pregnant child of god filled the holy ghost and then there's this surrendering soul surrendered to god that he don't care about anything else in the holy spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and to the world and that's what he wants to do through you not just through brother branham and not through the preachers or or through the piano players or the song leaders uh through kind of the the upper crest of a church i'll look at them they're the real christians no he wants to do it through you this is a personal vindication it's not a group move it's like uh uh there's a i don't know if i've expressed this publicly but in in having a church called arizona believers church uh there's there's three kinds of believers in any church arizona believer church you're a make believer unbeliever a believer it's arizona believers church this isn't bride of the seventh seal third pull kuben daba three times seven right shah tabernacle it's not just something so it's like well if you go there you better be bride of the third pool speaking squirrels kind of church oh it's kind of hey if you're an unbeliever come and hear the word and come to life to realize you are a believer from the beginning it's it's to the individual person to make this connection with god it's not a group move it is the individual personal vindication of the individual and and churches exist for the sole purpose of encouraging and and energizing individuals to experience the personal vindication of the holy spirit the personal vindication of the word and so setting limits it's not a matter of you can't do this and you can't do that and you can only do this and you're going to do that it's about exercising faith it's about saying no to the devil setting limit is about saying no to the devil saying no to things that are not expedient that are not not that are holding your faith back that are compromising your understanding of the word of god it's about uh saying no to situations and circumstances that disturb your peace by saying no to situations and circumstances and ways of thinking and acting and interacting that uh sterilize your confidence kind of beat you down i and if i haven't mentioned it here before i i'm very happy to mention it now the one of the most misused or one of the statements of brother branham that has become just like this bully club is the statement that uh the sickest body i know is the body of jesus christ and it's as if that that quota is still being used to make everybody feel that they're sick but brethren said there's more to this ministry than divine healing and he's talking about this healing that his ministry was to bring and the the the anointment the salve the bomb that the body needed at that time and he's saying he's diagnosed in a spiritual condition there was an opening of the word that was sent into the body and has energized it and she is no longer the sickest body on the face of the earth he says she is risen and so we want to strip away any a manhandling any abuse any any bully with a three-pointed club that's trying to beat you down and make you feel compromised and then kind of pointing to themselves as being the one that can fix you and the one that can make you feel better christ your husband is here to nurture you and to bring you to health and to bring you to rapturing faith setting limits is about recognizing the pressures that force us to do things that we don't want to do and and i want to come back around to this at the very end hopefully that there's the pressures toxic pressures that erode our self-control and we'll start acting we'll start acting outside of our true nature not your not your earthly nature not for me not the nature of my parents but outside the nature of your heavenly father and it's important for you to recognize when external pressure and situations and conflict is making you act differently than you know that you should or have as a son or daughter of god and instead of having this wake up oh i just must stop you son of god no you're probably just putting yourself under pressure and in conflict and experiencing things that are causing you to be very toxic interactions or things that are taking place that are causing you to act differently than you know that you ought to and then not you can and that should be a warning flag to you very quickly wait a minute something's taking place i'm no longer acting incongruent with what's in my heart i'm acting hypocritically that's not my nature to be cynical it's not my nature to be critical it's not my nature to be fearful it's not in my nature to disbelieve or to be harsh and those different things and you see that something's pushing you to live outside the bounds of your true nature in christ and we need to be very very sensitive to that in romans chapter 16 verse 17 it says now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them i even think the greek is translated to shun to shun them we are closing sunday in the thought that we are not forced to consent to evil uh or we are not forced to participate in sin we are not uh subject we are not forced to subject ourselves to unrighteous conduct like volunteer for it and use the scripture unreasonably say well i guess i have to do this and i guess i have to do that and we were using this to show that what we read in the new testament in the red letter christ speaking of forgiving our enemies and loving our enemies and forgiving one another and turning the other cheek and i want to come to it here in just a moment that the word is expanding what that means and showing that in some context and again i think on sunday i said let's just consider these scriptures to see whether or not there are contexts where we can say enough and so it says mark then which cause divisions and hurts and offenses uh that stumbling contrary to the doctrine which you've learned and avoid them so you to mark them and then there's to be some separation or distance from them and so we need to learn and i was jesus to say we need to learn to set boundaries just in this alone that if we mark somebody who's acting contrary to the word of god then there ought to be some conduct which means which is equal to avoidance in order to even fulfill the scripture and where we make our mistakes sometimes and boundaries and my heart is just overwhelmed with it because i think what we begin to think is external boundaries so we think well i need to learn to lock the door i need to pull the shades i need to let everyone know don't come without asking first or but most of the time we're really we're conscious of external boundaries but we're the boundaries that get violated the most are the internal ones that we now we're not even conscious of until afterwards we just feel like something's wrong we're like that wasn't right that's not right i don't need to do this i don't need to do that i shouldn't be thinking that i shouldn't be subjecting myself to that so we need them to clearly define for ourselves we need to recognize that the word of god speaks about this and i ought to walk in that and it's a virtue it's an inside virtue it's something has to do with your your character and your relationship with jesus christ i ought to protect that that's something that's worthy of defense there's things that we must be it must be clearly defined to ourselves and then also we ought to clearly define to others and then even address the violations of those things because it disturbs our faith romans chapter 12 verses 17 and 18. again we're just looking at that uh um that principle that here he's saying with respect to offenses that you can mark somebody who's bringing the offense and then avoid them and that's contrary to this idea oh well you just gotta lean into it somebody's offending you you're a christian you just gotta you kind of get you gotta get under their thumb and let them mistreat you in romans chapter 12 verses 17 and 18 recompense to no man evil for evil and so if someone treats you evilly don't treat him evil bag you're never justified in treating returning uh unrighteous behavior to somebody who's behaved unrighteously never justified what happens is if you're ever mistreated by uh by somebody let's say i'm not gonna make it a believer make believer anything but if somebody does something evil to you and you respond evil back guess what their justification for treating you evil to begin with is the way you responded see i told you yeah all i did was do this little thing to them look what they did right back to me see they deserved it to begin with and your response becomes the justification for the initial offense and that's all they're going to talk about is your response and you're going to be like well wait a minute wait a minute you punched me first whoa hold on yeah but you know what i was just testing you look what you did i was and all of a sudden it's your response that becomes where the limelight is being shown on it so never recompense evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men and then this beautiful sensitivity to paul if it be possible as much as is in your power as much as life in you if it's within your power to live peaceably if it even be possible live peaceably with all men that ought to be our desire and he continues to say that there's a way that you can conduct yourself even with your enemies where you bring a shame to them by heaping hot coals upon them it's going to make them see then they're going to feel this this shame by the way that you treat them he's saying if it be possible suggesting that in every instance it's not even possible to live peaceably with all men but he says we ought to try to live in a state of peace with our neighbors and our friends and sometimes even family is often hard thank you honesty appreciate that right should we talk about the neighbors next door it's been a while since we mentioned the neighbors in the apartment next door it's really hard to get along with the neighbors there and you know apartment number 212. but it is it can be very difficult to maintain peace uh with all these different relationships that we that we have with other people and the different dynamics that exist within that but regardless of how hard it is we should still try okay if as much as life in you live peacefully with all men so never let your conduct be the reason for unrest never let your attitude be the reason for conflict never let it be your behavior and your stubbornness or your uh um your uh insensitivities and and your bullheadedness whatever however you want to describe your conduct that it never be your barriers that are causing unrest and the lack of peace within a relationship but it says uh uh as much as life and you live peacefully with all men but this peace is not achieved by abolishing boundaries it's not by saying well i guess i got to live at peace i just need to surrender i just need to raise the white flag and just give in and they want me to do this for the for the sake of peace i'm just going to give in does that sound familiar just so that there's no more strife and there's no more complaining just so they don't get mad at me and just so they don't bully me and i know what they're going to say if i don't do this and listen we experience this so often and and and we know it we're going into it knowing we're compromising somewhere and the reason why we're doing this is we don't want the blow up we don't want to get the feedback and we don't want to do this and we don't want to do it and we think that we're bringing peace but you don't live with peace within your spirit when you do it hello that's giving in that that's that's not recognizing certain certain patterns of behavior that are rob you of your peace that are feeding this cycle of resentment and bitterness and making things even exponentially more difficult as things continue and you ought to say whoa stop lord help me what is it i'm engaging in that is creating this dynamic where i'm no longer even happy to go to church because i come with so much resentment and this is happening and that's happening where is it where's where has something gone wrong so you're not going to find this piece by just surrendering and giving him well let's just i just want to give in i'll just agree i'm just going to be i'm compliant or i'm just going to whatever the demands are we'll meet them for the sake of peace that's never going to bring peace because a christian has a duty to set limits to protect their hearts you have this body this the the mind the soul let's say the soul has been bought and it's sealed by the holy ghost but that spirit and that body is also the lord's and you have a duty to protect it it's a duty that you have so does the word set limits if you want to turn to first corinthians chapter 7 i skipped over this on sunday and i think it would have made if i believe it would have fit much better on sunday and so i apologize if it seems to be a little disconcordant to the flow this evening but i want to reference another example and as you read this be very very strict in your thinking don't don't either pursue personal justification or kind of apply it as a template to somebody else's situation but we're just wanting you to consider that god has boundaries and that there's some things in our mind that might seem to be uh very restrictive and very harsh but god has uh he has something that he's trying to accomplish and everything that god does and every principle he elicits ought to fulfill this objective that god has so you so that you can't just take any principle of god's word and just misdirect it say well i'm keeping the principle no if it's not fulfilling his objective you've misapplied the principle you've got to excuse somehow you don't have it lined up right you're you're pointing at the wrong thing you can't just say well it says to do this and as long as we do this it's good no it says to do this in order to achieve this and if you're doing it it's not achieving the results that god said it ought to achieve then you probably got something wrong in the application somewhere so first corinthians chapter 7 verses 12 to 15 he says but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother that hath the wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away and the woman which hath a husband which believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him so here's a woman that is a believer husband is not a believer but he's ha they're happy together they're living peaceably together then she ought not to leave him and then if a brother have a wife that believeth not and she be happy to live with him as the unbeliever she's pleased and there they have peace within their home he says let him not put her away verse 14 for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband elsewhere your children unclean but now are they holy and notice how paul summarizes this in verse 15 but if the unbelieving depart it's interesting that he chooses the language to say it's the unbeliever that departs let him depart let the unbeliever depart a brother or sister is not under bondage in such such cases but god hath called us to peace if if a believer is married to an unbeliever and their strife and there's discontent and there's uh marital abuse and emotional abuse and it's it's not harmonious and the husband the unbeliever wants to leave paul is saying that god's desire for you is peace and that there's there's not and again i want you to be very think be very careful here let me just say saying that the believer in this instance is not under bondage in those cases now he's not saying that they're therefore liberated as if the marriage never happened they can go get married again that's not the release that he's talking about but they're not forced to stay in this relationship where there's contention and there's marital strife and there's this yoke of bondage is bringing down this discouragement that this eroding of faith and this uh deterioration of confidence he says because god's called us to peace and god's word is not going to demand you do something and in the perfect obedience of it the product is unrest there's nothing in the word of god is going to ask you to do and i have submitted perfectly and i have submitted perfectly to this word and all i am in torment and saying no something's wrong somewhere you haven't perfectly submitted it's perfect submission all is at rest once i've perfectly submitted to a promise of god it's going to yield peaceable fruit once i've perfectly submitted to the word of god it's going to yield righteous fruit and so if there's torment and there and there's a loss of faith and there's a weakness in my supposed adherence strictly to the word of god that it's important to take a step back not abandon the word that you believe you're adhering to but take a step back and ask the lord what part is a miss is it my own heart am i actually the the unbeliever in this instance am i the one that's causing the lack of peace am i not am i being selfish am i the one that's not doing my part and it just it creates a re-evaluation but could we not agree that if this word this word being present it indicates that it's not always bondage for the sake of some uh for the sake of some principle it's the peace that god wants us to experience there are boundaries in marriage it's actually saying that in this instance where you have two that are living together a man and a wife are married one's a believer one's the unbeliever but they're not at peace he says then let the unbeliever depart and even in the departing you're not under bondage in that instance we have to feel that something is a loss and something is amiss and that you're walking uh uh somehow handicapped with god it identifies a boundary in marriage and then there's yes there's barriers to a happy marriage brother branham has asked this question and we had referenced these on sunday and this is where i thought there'd just be tremendous continuity brother i'm talking about be salty in those several different instances where he's asked about a marital difference and he says just be salty just be salty and he's mean don't be a smart alec not that kind of salty right uh don't be a smart alec don't be at you know don't agitate and don't stir things up and don't try to you know assert your spirituality over he says just be salty just be sweet be humble and so we'd read the statement from there and then this is another question and answers question 285 brother branham i believe a woman should be subject to her husband and all the brothers said but if a christian woman has a sinner husband who does not even come to one of your services and wants his wife to do things cutting her hair wearing shorts and going to ungodly places is this woman supposed to be subject to this man in this way please explain this more clear clearly as this is a question that is asked often you understand the question he says no sister you're not subject to such a person no sister you are not subject to such a person no indeedy for this cause you'll leave everything enclave to god now the thing says if that man wants to live with you and you stay christian so i know it's a fragment but he's saying look if you if you can live peaceably if you're pleased to dwell if you're pleased to be with one another and he knows you're a christian and he supports you and he's there for you and it's it's not causing strife and he's not trying to force you uh uh to disobey the word of god he says you know he's saying it's like well then you remain but he says but if he's going to make you wear shorts cut your hair and do all these other things in ungodly places you seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness you are not bound to such a person as that again i want you to be very careful in this and be very strict in your thinking i'm just using it i'm pointing out an example in the word of god as we think about setting limits and just to identify that there is a boundary that can be crossed that in the sanctity of marriage and even the headship of the husband in this question and answers the headship of the husband is so important that brother ben goes so far to say that if you believe the truth as a wife and your husband goes to a different church than the one where the truth is being preached he says just be salty and go with them because that headship is so important it's so strong but then he's saying but it can only go so far that headship cannot usurp the headship of jesus christ it cannot bring you into the bondage of sin it cannot force you to do things which are ungodly it cannot force you to begin to act inconsistently with the precepts of holiness and these scriptures in the word of god so there is a boundary that can be crossed and there's a boundary that can be crossed where you can stand gallantly and say no i cannot go that far i cannot permit sin to be exercised against me i do not have to consent against sin i do not have to permit evil there is a point at which i can be in the liberty of jesus christ and stand my ground the word allows for separation for the sake of peace in order to not do to be a slave to bondage because there's a boundary that's being crossed we mentioned on sunday we have the authority by the word of god to establish boundaries to set to set limits that are to protect us to protect our family to protect our children that's what applying the token token's all about that's setting a boundary that that that's saying you know what the world is going to stop here that's that's what they're talking about it's about a boundary and so i want you to constantly keep this in mind because on one hand maybe i'm trying to provoke our our our good pride to stand up for ourselves and be bold in the word of god to say no to the devil to say no to the flesh and advance further in the things of god but at the same time i want us all of us to individually recognize that there's a warning to us to not trespass across boundaries there's a warning about violating boundaries with being insensitive insensitive or engaging in hurtful conduct and if you'll look at matthew chapter five that's really where jesus is identifying it's not so much uh uh paramilitary action to overthrow the government and instead of laying down your arms and let the government abuse you he's not even talking about he's talking about interpersonal relationships family and friends and those things and in setting limits because it's these things we're reading it's telling us right i i need to be sensitive to these things that are defiling my conscience and weakening my spirit and causing me to be uh uh you know faithless as it were weaken my faith yeah that's that's part of it but then also are you the one that's causing other people offenses and hurts and harm so there's a there's a consciousness i need to be respectful i need to be sure that i'm acting appropriately and so setting limits is about demonstrating to others the the right kind of conduct and the way that you live but then also you setting the limit that then demonstrates to somebody who's a boundary violator so that they know what is right for their own good for their own correction matthew chapter 5 verses 38 to 42 i'm gonna i'm asking you individually are you following me to this point at matthew chapter 5 verses 38 to 42. we read a lot more in our text but we're just going to read these verses you have heard that it had been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth i believe it was martin luther king jr that said if we all lived by that everybody we'd be blind i'm going to amen brother martin luther king jr on that you've heard it that has been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth but i say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also now the language is suggesting not so much of a punch or an act of aggression but some sort of demeaning act in order to put you in your place the backhanded compliment you know this is a slap to the face to assert someone's dominance over you it says that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite the on the right cheek turn to him the other also if any man will sue thee at the law take away and take away thy coat let them have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go mild go with them twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow thee turn not thou away my purpose in approaching this is not to make it complicated but maybe for us to realize it's complex because we read these and think oh i just need to say yes to everything or i just need to give in to whatever comes and somebody asked me for this i just need to give it to him someone wants to borrow my car and never return it i guess i just need to let that happen and that's kind of don't worry brother jeff your truck's safe i'm shopping for a car pray for me this market's crazy can't find a house can't find a car we can find an rv big enough for all of us maybe we just do it all in one one place but it's there's a there's a principle that jesus is touching on and we don't want to just be real shallow kind of skimming over the top of it he's saying that you resist not evil this is not just this non-resistance to any kind of force that you're not allowed to defend your home and you're not allowed to defend yourself against an attacker jesus isn't even talking about he's not talking about self-defense in the in an act of violence against you he's not talking about uh uh military might or nations protecting their borders it's if that's not what jesus is talking about he's not the individual living his everyday life coming into conflict with other believers and other people and how that you ought to conduct yourselves for your own protection and also for their correction brother adam and this message serves we would see jesus he references this scripture he says so god humbles himself god is humility the man that can humble himself is on his road up he that exalts himself is on the road down always like he says the way up is down so we must remember that christianity is not pushing ahead and trying to get ahead of this fella but stepping back and taking the backseat that's what christianity is christianity is not about advancing yourself and pushing yourself forward and kind of he look at me here i am he says but you're not trying to compete and get ahead of this person and outdo this person he says just take a step back take in the back seat see letting the other fellow go on that's christianity humble yourself if you see you at the court and takes your coat give him your cloak also if he compels you to go mile go too if he smites one cheek turn the other he was our example in every way what we should be and if that life can reflect in us people will see christ in you you see when they can see that so it's a witness it's a testimonial when you act in a way that's incongruent with what the world's expecting is any any one of you ever accidentally made somebody mad while you were driving and the horn is honking and they speed up next to you and they meet you at a light and they roll down the window and they're just about to rip you to shreds and you say i am so sorry and they're like what what oh okay right and they don't know what to do like no no you meant to make that lane change and you intentionally didn't use your break your your blinker this let's fight you know it's like let's get it on and uh and they're just wanting michael buffer to pull up next year say next round and everyone start fighting it out and you're like hey man i'm sorry i made a mistake that's my bad i made a mistake they don't even know how to act when you apologize okay it's not even worth it you know it's no big deal don't worry about it they don't know how to act and so it's acting incongruent with what the world would do what somebody else is doing he says the witness of jesus christ when the world expects a certain response and you give them the response of christ it gets their attention he says people see christ in you now this what i'm going to read and you must be born again it is so beautiful so beautiful so beautiful god help me to bring this out because it's so beautiful he says be born again christians be born again then you won't have to say it's the hardest thing says you women it's the hardest thing for me to let my hair grow out he said if you if you're born again you won't have to say it's the hardest thing for me to let my hair grow he says now he says to the men he says you men it's the hardest thing for me to let my temper go boy i just have to tell my wife i get her boy and i shake her and i say i know i'm a christian i ought to do this but you shut up and you sit down and he says don't you do that don't do that see he says if you get born again and you talk about the way this is the way you ought to act you like to see a time you could put your arm around her and say sweetheart that isn't becoming to a christian two different responses one who says i know i shouldn't do this i'm a christian i shouldn't do this but you shut up and sit down it's a it's an action that is premised upon this authority of the husband and i know i shouldn't do this but you just you just and he's talking very harshly very very brutish and he says wouldn't you like to see a time when you can still address the same thing so i said wouldn't you like it to come a time where you won't say anything but says you still address the same thing sweetheart that isn't becoming to a christian he says that's the way you want to be isn't it he says you can be that way he says and when a man slaps you on one side of the face now let me let me back up brother's talking about addressing something that's not right he says is the right way to do it the wrong way to do it so there's not two options either say something and mess it up or don't say anything at all it's you could not say anything at all you could say something the wrong way or you can say something the right way it's not as binary as some people want to make it which isn't amazing that people say they're non-binary and in so doing have created a binary system i don't know food for thought got it i like it that's good he said when a man slaps you on one side of the face you don't have to cut him down with a pocketknife a man slaps you one side of the face say brother what reason did you do that for said there you are that's christianity he's shown us what christ was talking about notice he did not say that when he slaps you on the face you say oh you might as well do the other side too he said you there's there's a response brother why did you hit me what reason did you do that for there you are that's christianity when somebody says something evil about you instead of just trying to make a big show of it slip off somewhere and say heavenly father the man is immortal i pray that you'll take that spirit out of him don't let him do that i pray you save his life that's where brother bram talks about how you got to get to a place where you can pray for your enemies and really even bitterly intervene for those who mistreat you but this is this is brother branham looking at these conflicts and these situations and he's he's really bringing out the gold of what christ has to say that here somebody smites you on the cheek he says somebody smacks you slaps you on the side of the face he said you do not have to respond in kind or even escalate the violence like bringing a knife to a gunfight you know you know somebody stabs you and they pull out and then you pull out a gun he's saying that there's ought not to be an escalation to it that if they hit you you don't bring out the pocket knife and then the war is on hey all's fair and loving war we're really going to go at it and we're going to toe-to-toe you started this and you're going to be glad and i'll be the one to stop it he's saying no that's not how we act but he's also not saying just walk away right he's not or he's not saying coward down and give in he's also saying don't blow it up he's also saying he's not saying walk away but now there's been a response that says brother why did you do that and is there an appropriate response to the situation when jesus says to turn to him the other also this is not a prohibition of self-protection but it's about self-control it's all about it's about boundaries it's about if somebody does that to you you don't come right back with something against them uh uh don't don't try to over top don't don't try to cut them down and tear them down and uh don't respond in kind and and or definitely don't escalate it or but he's also saying don't it's not run away there's control that's involved jesus is teaching not to escalate conflict allowing it to grow where there's bitterness there's resentment there's further contention but he's telling it we ought to resist evil the right way this is that you resist not evil it means not to as paul said it re recompense evil for evil we ought to oppose evil by every righteous mean in our it means within our power and not by evil right we're to oppose evil we're to oppose the lie we're to stand against anything that's against the word of god but not by evil not well you know it's the truth so i don't mind telling a lie on somebody who's against the truth but jesus is teaching us if i can put it this way he's teaching us how that we do not become the victim it might read like wow man he's just really telling me that whenever i get beat up i just need to keep a knuckling down and putting up with it but he's he's touching on a principle and i want to just i'm going to close here in just a few minutes he's teaching a response to where you kind of free yourself of being the victim where i i'm not going to be bound by this offense i'm not gonna let this eat at me i'm not gonna let this define me i'm not gonna let this put me in a box i'm not gonna let it uh kind of be a shadow or a scar or a limit to me this isn't gonna be a barrier i'm not gonna let this bind me up but i'm going to i'm going to approach this the right way i'm going to respond the right way try address the conduct for what it is and then i'm able to put it in the light that it ought to be put in so that i'm not necessarily the victim of this person's offense to where they continue to have power over me i want to find a very delicate way to express this because it's something that i recognize personally for myself they have they have what is called trauma responses and there's way that people can begin to act within their life and they find out later on i'm that way not because that's who i am or that's my personality but that's the consequence of some trauma and so they they some people just always agree with everything anything aren't they just agreeable they're really easy going they're laid back no they're scarred to death i mean they're that way because they don't want conflict they're that way because they had some abuse or some circumstance or some loss and there's there's a trauma response that is dictating even their meekness and their sweetness and their agreeability there's sometimes a trauma response that's causing people to lash out and get angry and be upset it's not because they're harsh or they're brutal it's a response it's their trauma response and that kind of trauma response that dictates behavior that's a barrier that when someone's afraid to say well i would really like this or they want to say no and they have but they have to say yes and they're all doing as a trauma response that's a barrier to somebody's peace that's a barrier to somebody walking in the liberty of jesus christ and jesus if i could put it and i'm not trying to just be self-serving or try to shoehorn some idea into this i want you to think i'm using terminology that you might get lost in but make it very personal there's a way that in this moment of getting hit we just now engage in some sort of trauma response i'm going to fight back or there's going to be flight i'm going to run or i'm going to freeze some sort of trauma response but jesus is actually saying no i want you to respond to the trauma where we're not where we can either live we can either have a trauma response or we can respond someone our response to the trauma which is insane wait a minute there's a boundary that you just crossed that that's that's an offense you don't do that and you're looking at more from a point of a healthy pride a healthy confidence that there's virtues that god wants you to protect there's things that you want not to take away from me there's a way that you ought not to treat a son or daughter of god and so there's a way that in the moment that you're responding to the trauma but then there's also a way that you can be proactive about it we cannot allow the offense to govern our responses where the offense causes us to freeze up or to fight or to to run but we need to respond in a manner that preserves preserves our testimony our integrities brother branham said if the people see christ in you there's a way that you respond that preserves your testimony that that elicits uh the character of jesus christ and then it also challenges the offender because he said brother what did you do that for there's a way that you respond that christ christ stands up in your defense the character of christ is what comes you're not going to be the victim but christ is going to stand up in your defense and so there's something you're doing for yourself that preserves your integrity and in doing so it's something that asks the question of the person who did it would you do that for it's setting limits he didn't say if a man strike you on the face run away from as fast as you can because then the one that is a the one that is done is like ha ha see the coward is running he's not saying fight back fight back and let him have it because then he's like that's exactly what they want but he's saying and he's not saying coward there you know shriek back in fear before him but he's telling you to have a thoughtful response i believe brother branham is saying that brother why did you do that that's a thoughtful response it's a thoughtful response that begins to get to the heart of the act why did you do that because that wasn't right that's that's that's conduct that's not becoming of a christian that's not that's not that's no way to talk to somebody that that's no way to treat somebody that that that that is not right to do that and so there's a way that you respond that kind of exposes the error and exposes the offense and you don't have to fight back you don't have to get nasty in return but you don't have to run and you don't have to sign up for another beating you have a way of saying wait a minute hold on that's not appropriate i won't put up with it you have no right to treat me that way and it puts the offender on notice you'll find that the people that jesus is talking to he's talking to people who endure shame he's talking about the experiencing shame it's all being backhanded a slap to the face it's a shaming it's a trespass it's something that's hurtful and he's talking to the people not who are in the position of power but the people who are in the position to be abused right and and he's telling them how they ought to respond and i'm going to read this and it was uh it was written by a gentleman named walter wink leave his name that was his name and i'm just now forgetting the book it was in and i'm just going to read it because i love the way that he said it and i i believe that it's it's truthful and and i hope that you can listen because i'm going to close on this and when i've read this the i invite the musicians to come he asked the question why then does jesus counsel these already humiliated people to turn the other cheek listening we're closing we're going to stop here in just a moment please pay close attention to this because this action robs the oppressor of the power to humiliate the person who turns the other cheek is saying in effect try again your first blow failed to achieve its intended effect i deny you the power to humiliate me i'm a human being just like you your status does not alter that fact you cannot demean me there's a way that you conduct yourself in response to where you're saying look you do not have power over me to rob me of my position in christ you don't have pro power only to subjugate me to your passions to your temper to your legalism to whatever your attitude is you do not have power over me your act failed to demean me it failed to humiliate me it failed to produce the desired response and i have not given you the satisfaction by responding to your disrespect with the blow of the fist to show that you are indeed greater than me and more powerful in me and i have to give a show of force to bring you down you respond in such a way that completely strips them whatever perceived power they thought they had over you because you just say brother why did you do that why would you do that what's your reason for engaging in that to turn the other cheek is to stand up for yourself while being true to yourself not trying to defend yourself outside of yourself but as a real christian he says turn turn the other cheek and in doing so it's as if to say try again what you what you were trying to accomplish you failed in doing it and i'm not going to run and i'm not going to let you do it again i'm going to say what did you do that for because that wasn't right does it make sense to you [Music] may god help us to give a thoughtful response [Music] for the for the sanctification of our spirits the protection of our hearts for the courage of our children be able to say no that's enough and to resist the notions that the world so easily wants to put on us is just play just play the victim you're not a victim thanks you're not victims no matter what it is you've endured and what you've gone through and you may have been the victim of abuse but that is not who you are that is not who you remain to be but through jesus christ you are risen to a place of life and health and so i encourage you to begin to examine hear the voice of god that's trying to call you out into greater things and have them wash you of these things that hold us back let's stand to our feet [Music] thank you for listening tonight thank you for giving me this liberty to finish kind of close that loop on setting limits i know i mentioned on sunday that we want to kind of as a road map go from setting limits to recognizing limits and then on addressing barriers and that's not necessarily going to be the strict the strict road map of the subjects or kind of the future future steps that we want to take there's some principles i still want to express [Music] and on sunday and i mention this so you could be praying on sunday i would like to expound upon the idea of imposing things and doing things and asking things or uh enforcing things through the idea of authority as opposed to love [Music] and how that there's things that god wants us to do but it's again it comes back to the idea god is it he's a gentleman he's knocking he's looking for permission and if that's the example he set for us and we ought to likewise do the same thing and be certain that if we're setting a boundary or overcoming a barrier the love of god is the impetus it's the inspiration and not whether we're right it's the truth how many times did somebody hurt you and they said well it's the truth anyhow wow brother that really hurt me when you mentioned my name over the pulpit and said this that and the other about me well was it a lie was it true well yeah i mean it's true but that hurt well then truth hurts doesn't it right you say well that's just somebody who had the opportunity right they have the authority right it's their pulpit they can say whatever they want or they're the husband it's their house or you know there's this i take i'm taking advantage and we ought to realize no no no no that's not what christians do we can accomplish by the word of god everything that he wants us to do so that we don't have to resort to power privilege opportunity or force to do it so be in prayer please let's pray gracious heavenly father as we are dismissed here shortly we want to take a moment now to turn back to you and to say thank you for the word and i ask as the pastor who's expressing these principles i ask that you would be on the receiving end and i know that you have been lord but to further be on the contemplating end and the rumination end the the part now where the believer begins to ponder these things and examine their own lives and see where these things fit and lord i know there might be some tendency maybe just to kind of get our ear up for some of the terminology say oh i want to explore that i want to research that i want to look into this if you would so lead one to look further into the psychology of this or the kind of the human condition and the human behavior that's being talked about in some of these things if you would lead to do that lord i i don't object but my desire would be that in hearing these things it would enlighten us to the fact that you god are perfectly mindful of how how you what you have called us to be and how acts in circumstances and life has worked against us to put us in the current state that we're in and that your word is being very discerning so that we could it can uncover something and we say yes lord you do understand yes lord this word is enough yes the message of the hour is is guiding me and speaking to my insecurities and washing me of my vanity and healing me of my hurts and to and to lean into the spiritual application and to yield to the word of god and to take the yoke of christ upon us and not get caught up in the psychology of and get caught up in the buzzwords of it but just enough lord to get our attention but then point us very quickly to the word of god that's my desire and what i would want tonight lord is that in this very moment right now as i pray that there would be divine healing that would take place that whether it be husbands or wives or children or elders and regardless of the people that hear this may there be a healing lord and a and a raising up if you have the bad kind of pride you fall but if you don't have the right kind of pride you'll never get back up lord may we now have courage to rise and to stand gallantly upon our feet and say i will not play the victim anymore and i will not play the aggressor anymore i won't play the the one that's running away i won't play the one that's freezing i won't play the one that's fighting but i'll play the one that stands and turns the other cheek and gives notice to the devil i'm not your victim that gives notice to the circumstances i'm not your slave that gives notice to the hurt i am not bound by you any longer but i am a son or daughter of god who can stand on his own two feet in jesus christ and can respond appropriately to the trauma lord help us to recognize in our own lives things that are [Music] our trauma responses as it were we're that way more because of our hurts than it is because of our healings we're more that way because of hardness than it is humility and help us lord to experience your healing commit the people to you today right now in this moment heal them in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen [Music]
