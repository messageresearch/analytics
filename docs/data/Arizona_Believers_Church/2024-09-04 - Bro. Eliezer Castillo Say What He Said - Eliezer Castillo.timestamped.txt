[0:00] but uh my my title is say what he says
[0:05] and actually my
[0:07] uh the scripture that I wanted to read
[0:10] was from 10 or from 9 to 10 but reading
[0:14] in the back it kind of confirmed certain
[0:17] things where from six all the way to 10
[0:21] it's talking about a believer that that
[0:24] is being justified and he's saying
[0:26] righteousness says this he well he he
[0:30] says that and then he says he doesn't
[0:32] say that should we go up to heaven and
[0:36] bring Christ down for our justification
[0:38] or should we go down to the deep and
[0:40] bring him back up but he says no he's
[0:44] like we don't need that anymore we don't
[0:47] need to to ask Lord let let me see your
[0:49] Resurrection again or let me see you
[0:52] rise up or let me see you descend in
[0:56] order for me to be justified because we
[0:59] know that by his resurrection we were
[1:02] Justified and he's telling these people
[1:04] that Faith doesn't say that but what it
[1:07] says is that the word or the
[1:10] promise that Jesus already did that it's
[1:14] already with
[1:15] you that this word this Bible This
[1:19] Promise as simple as it
[1:21] is it's in it written in in Black Ink it
[1:26] says that Jesus has already done that
[1:29] and by that word whenever we receive it
[1:32] into our not only our heart but our lips
[1:36] that something there's a transformation
[1:38] that happens within us just by receiving
[1:41] the
[1:41] promise just by receiving the word and
[1:45] and there's these two things that that
[1:47] is necessary for
[1:50] salvation and those two things are a
[1:53] confession of what Jesus Christ did a
[1:57] confession of the word saying yes I I
[2:00] believe it and the second one is
[2:03] believing it with your heart and it says
[2:06] to believe unto
[2:09] righteousness and confess unto
[2:13] salvation and those are the two things
[2:16] that we need for this salvation and um
[2:18] of course us as me message Believers
[2:20] brother Bram he explained and we see in
[2:22] the Bible that we are Triune
[2:25] beings that that um we have a soul body
[2:29] spirit our body has the five senses the
[2:32] Inside Man the spirit has the inner five
[2:35] senses which is our conscience our
[2:37] memory and all of that and then the
[2:40] inside of the inside just like we heard
[2:42] brother Aaron talk about the soul
[2:45] there's one thing governing it it's
[2:48] either Faith or doubt and in other
[2:51] quotes brother brandham said that it's
[2:53] it's a free will to either accept or
[2:56] deny anything so so that's how how we
[3:00] were
[3:01] created we were created if I would like
[3:05] to say it um
[3:06] just just so that I can um be a little
[3:09] forward but we were created to receive
[3:14] media we were created to receive words
[3:18] brother Bram in one one text he said
[3:21] that the the mind is the womb of the
[3:25] spirit and and another one he said that
[3:28] the the the mind is the gate to the
[3:30] soul so so we were made so that we could
[3:34] receive something all the way down to
[3:37] the soul so that we can become that
[3:40] thing that we
[3:42] received and I I started to think about
[3:44] that and I started to think about just
[3:46] the how media is today and what media is
[3:50] it's a middle
[3:51] ground so that's what media is media is
[3:54] a plural word of
[3:56] medium and medium is the singular word
[3:59] and it means in the
[4:01] middle media means it's it's a mass
[4:05] dissemination of
[4:08] information and media could be um news
[4:12] it could be through articles it could be
[4:14] through books it could be through social
[4:17] media through broadcasting through radio
[4:20] through TV through your phones there is
[4:24] a a great dissemination of
[4:28] information and and and we we known
[4:31] through history we like I was reading or
[4:33] I was um I list I saw a uh documentary
[4:37] of Hitler and how he used
[4:40] propaganda how he used the media so that
[4:43] he
[4:44] can what he does is form or shape the
[4:48] thoughts of the
[4:49] people to the point where where people
[4:52] will begin to think a certain way and
[4:55] I'm not saying like oh well CNN is like
[4:58] this or
[5:00] Fox News all of them they're all like
[5:02] that they all have an agenda and there
[5:05] could be a source that happens there
[5:07] could be a situation that happens and
[5:10] each media is going to depict that
[5:13] information the way they want to depict
[5:15] it and give it to the people that want
[5:17] that kind of media and whenever they
[5:20] receive it they are formed and they're
[5:23] shaped by that media not only that but
[5:26] that's news media but there's social
[5:28] media also where where the media is is
[5:34] uh the medium between the the content
[5:37] creators and the
[5:40] audience and and they're receiving all
[5:43] of those things and it shapes Our Lives
[5:46] shapes the way we think because we were
[5:49] created to receive
[5:51] media we were created to receive
[5:55] words so that whenever we receive a word
[5:58] and we believe in in that word we become
[6:01] that
[6:02] word we become that very thing and
[6:04] that's why you see all the chaos in the
[6:07] world because there's a mass
[6:09] dissemination of
[6:11] media Mass U uh flood of information not
[6:16] only to the old people but to our youth
[6:19] there's just so much information going
[6:21] through it and it shapes the people
[6:24] today to the point where uh the great
[6:27] one of the greatest examples was Hitler
[6:30] changing the minds of the people to hate
[6:32] a certain group of
[6:34] people and we see it today um if if I
[6:38] could say that America is probably the
[6:41] worst or the one that uses media the
[6:43] most because we have it in our
[6:46] constitution of the freedom of
[6:48] press that so um even though it's it's
[6:52] messed up or it's it's right they're
[6:54] going
[6:56] to they're going to give it to the
[6:58] people and most media Outlets they're
[7:01] tied to a shareholder they're tied to
[7:04] these multi-billionaires
[7:06] that want a certain narrative right I'm
[7:10] not here to talk about that but I just
[7:13] want to for us to understand that there
[7:15] is a media going
[7:17] on but the one who started created media
[7:21] was God he was the one because media is
[7:25] the middle
[7:27] ground it media has the
[7:31] power to control
[7:34] information it takes the information
[7:37] from the source and it can control it it
[7:39] could either uh uh clarify it could
[7:42] distort it could pervert or it could
[7:45] safeguard that information and give it
[7:48] to the person that is
[7:50] hearing and and the Bible says in John
[7:53] 1:1 in the beginning was the
[7:57] word that is Media that is a
[8:01] word and in the word in the beginning
[8:03] was the word and the Word was with God
[8:05] and the Word was
[8:07] God and we know that God he says I don't
[8:10] change my word doesn't change I am my
[8:13] own
[8:14] word brother bam says a man is as good
[8:17] as his word so you want to see how good
[8:20] or or who that man is well look at his
[8:23] word look at what what he says look at
[8:27] his promises and that's who that person
[8:29] is and God says I am my word so whatever
[8:33] I say that's what my word says or
[8:35] whoever I am that's what my word
[8:37] is and and brother brandham cuz you you
[8:41] know I really love the gospels and I
[8:43] love how brother brandom revealed that
[8:46] those gospels they were tied to those
[8:50] four living creatures and you had the
[8:53] the the the lion with Matthew he he
[8:56] depicted him as a king all the the way
[8:59] down through his lineage and the way he
[9:01] he showed him that as the son of David
[9:04] the lineage of David he was the king he
[9:07] was the lion of Judah Mark he depicted
[9:10] him as the ultimate sacrifice Luke he
[9:13] depicted him as uh the one that was all
[9:16] the way from Adam he had the chronology
[9:19] all the way from Adam and he depicted
[9:21] him that way not only that but Luke was
[9:23] a very intelligent man he was a
[9:26] teacher but John which the Bible says
[9:30] and and brother Bram says that we have
[9:33] that anointing which was an eagle
[9:35] anointing he didn't go all the
[9:38] way to David or Abraham he didn't go all
[9:43] the way to Adam like Luke did but when
[9:46] he looked he had an anointing and he
[9:48] said in the beginning was the word he
[9:52] didn't Only See Jesus as a man that was
[9:55] that was going to inherit all things but
[9:58] he saw him as the very beginning of all
[10:01] things he was the
[10:04] word he was but but what I love about
[10:07] brother brandham is brother brandham
[10:09] said one simple thing he said a thought
[10:13] is a word expressed or or a word is a
[10:16] thought
[10:18] expressed and and that simple phrase
[10:21] brother brandham goes Plumb into
[10:23] eternity because John says the beginning
[10:26] started with the word but but then the
[10:30] thought was there before the
[10:33] beginning and that is the information
[10:36] God had he had you and I in his mind he
[10:41] had us in his
[10:43] thoughts
[10:45] the God says to to job he says where
[10:48] were
[10:49] you where were you when all the saints
[10:52] of God were already there shouting and
[10:56] worshiping so we were thoughts in God's
[10:59] mind
[11:01] now I don't want to get into this but
[11:02] I'll just say a little bit but God
[11:04] doesn't think in words he thought in
[11:08] images so just like all of us that's
[11:11] what we do I've done this before but if
[11:14] you everybody would like to close their
[11:15] eyes real
[11:17] quick and I want you guys to picture
[11:21] um that you're in a forest and you see a
[11:25] cabin you go into that cabin and and you
[11:27] see an empty cabin but with a table in
[11:31] there and on that table is a red
[11:35] apple okay you can open your eyes so who
[11:39] who pictured
[11:41] words who thought of words a p p
[11:46] Le or who saw
[11:48] images who actually saw themselves going
[11:51] into that
[11:54] place that's what God
[11:56] thinks so when God had all that
[11:59] information he had us in his mind and
[12:02] his mind and his thoughts are more of a
[12:05] reality than our reality that we see
[12:08] today it was
[12:10] eternity and and God thought and he
[12:12] thought and he thought for eternity I we
[12:15] can't even explain
[12:16] it but as he thought what started
[12:20] everything was whenever he put that
[12:24] thought into the media into that middle
[12:27] ground into a messenger called the word
[12:31] and whenever he spoke the word came out
[12:33] and things began to happen somebody
[12:37] received
[12:38] it God says that my words will not
[12:41] return to me
[12:42] void so that those words are like
[12:45] Messengers those words will go and in in
[12:49] Isaiah 55 I believe 89 and 10 he says
[12:53] that his words go like the
[12:56] rain and they'll fall to the ground and
[12:58] it brings forth the fruit of the
[13:02] ground and he and not only that but he
[13:04] said that it will go it will not be void
[13:08] but it'll come back and it will
[13:11] prosper that is God's word and whenever
[13:14] we receive God's word something happens
[13:18] within us we are that ground we are that
[13:22] receiver to receive that
[13:24] word and whenever we receive that word
[13:28] it's within
[13:30] us and and here in the Scripture it says
[13:34] that with your heart you believe unto
[13:37] righteousness that's you receiving the
[13:40] word that's you receiving what God
[13:43] Said but now un with thy confession
[13:48] salvation is made whenever we think of
[13:51] salv or confession we we confess our
[13:54] faults we confess to one another we
[13:57] confess that we're no good we confess
[13:59] that we're we're who knows what we
[14:01] confess right but that's usually where
[14:05] confession is associated with is Lord
[14:09] I'm going to confess to you again that I
[14:11] I messed up but this this is not talking
[14:15] about that kind of
[14:17] confession this word is actually a word
[14:20] it's it's called
[14:23] homio and it's uh comprised of two words
[14:27] homo means the same
[14:30] loio means what loio means to
[14:36] say so what what it's saying is to say
[14:39] the same
[14:40] thing that is
[14:42] confession to say the same thing and
[14:44] loio that's actually a noun the verb of
[14:47] it is the word that we know
[14:50] logos so it's not only just to say the
[14:52] same thing but it's saying what God
[14:55] says it's to speak the word
[14:59] so now we become a form of
[15:02] media we become a form of media to speak
[15:06] the word because what does it say it
[15:09] says with confession salvation is
[15:12] made to speak the word you bring your
[15:15] own
[15:16] salvation by believing that Jesus Christ
[15:19] died on the cross and he rose up and
[15:22] then you confess it you speak the word
[15:25] and it says salvation is made not only
[15:28] salvation but Perfection is
[15:30] made everything we confess and
[15:33] everything we say it it has life to
[15:36] it something comes comes comes in and it
[15:42] goes
[15:43] out there there's a spirit that goes out
[15:48] actually brother
[15:50] brandham he says
[15:53] that in in uh the word became flesh the
[15:57] Indian uh India trip report preached in
[16:00] 1954 he says and they that are sons of
[16:04] God are led by the spirit of God and
[16:07] when the human element goes out the
[16:10] spirit of God fills that vacancy where
[16:13] you were EMP where you empty yourself
[16:15] amen then when the church in its power
[16:17] of resurrection of the Lord Jesus walk
[16:20] in his steps so there's something that
[16:24] happens we we we begin to walk in his
[16:26] steps in his power in his thoughts in
[16:31] his being in his moving you see what I
[16:34] mean congregation says amen then your
[16:36] thoughts become words and your words
[16:40] become
[16:42] material that's when the church is in
[16:45] its
[16:46] power is whenever you receive that
[16:49] word and then you begin to confess that
[16:53] word the thing is the thing is whenever
[16:56] we receive too much of that other media
[16:59] right then what do we do the Bible says
[17:02] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[17:05] whatever we receive into this Soul
[17:08] because that that's where the battle is
[17:10] there's a battle for our soul today
[17:14] there's a battle for control today and
[17:17] the devil what he the B brother Bram
[17:20] says the devil is almost
[17:22] harmless if he doesn't have something to
[17:24] dwell into right so what is he doing
[17:27] he's trying to get into to that
[17:29] Soul trying to get there why because
[17:32] once he can get into the soul then now
[17:35] he can move the conscience where he
[17:36] wants to move it he can move your
[17:38] memories he can move your affections he
[17:41] can move your five outer senses by
[17:44] controlling that Soul that's what he
[17:48] wants but I like how brother brandham
[17:50] says he says he's almost
[17:53] harmless because his greatest power is
[17:57] deception the Bible says he he's the
[17:59] father of
[18:00] Lies he he he's an
[18:03] accuser that's these are all things that
[18:06] doesn't even require a touch from
[18:09] somebody he doesn't even need to make
[18:12] contact all he needs to do is give allow
[18:17] or have somebody to allow him to speak
[18:19] in their
[18:20] ear that's all and that's where his
[18:24] power lies whenever we go and we listen
[18:27] to that information
[18:29] that messenger that
[18:31] Medium when we listen to that and we
[18:34] begin to listen we listen Maybe it goes
[18:38] down to our outer senses to our inner
[18:41] senses all the way down until he's got
[18:44] that
[18:46] person why because he is the master
[18:49] manipulator he is the power or he he is
[18:54] the Bible says he is the prince of the
[18:56] power of the air
[18:59] I've heard a brother I forgot what his
[19:01] name was but he started speaking about
[19:03] dimensions and he spoke about um the
[19:05] fourth
[19:06] dimension and how that he was talking
[19:08] about The Ether I don't know too much
[19:10] about The Ether but he talked about
[19:12] radio waves and
[19:14] Airwaves and and and how the social
[19:17] media wifi radio everything goes through
[19:22] those
[19:24] waves and I truly believe that's what
[19:27] the devil uses he uses that form of
[19:30] communication actually brother brandham
[19:32] he said that that Satan and his
[19:35] army he went to Hollywood and he begin
[19:39] to to uh he be to um what do you call it
[19:45] um to influence the whole nation by that
[19:49] one spot how did he say it he said
[19:53] through
[19:54] television he said through television he
[19:57] begin to use his own propaganda if he
[20:01] wants his own message he' begin to
[20:04] influence the way people dress the way
[20:06] people act the way people talk look at
[20:09] how everybody is and it started there in
[20:13] Hollywood he said there was an influence
[20:16] brother bam he said that God created the
[20:20] airwaves but Satan perverted him and he
[20:24] went and he he influenced every social
[20:27] media every television every phone
[20:31] everything so that he could bring his
[20:36] information his
[20:38] media his propaganda he's been doing
[20:41] that Donald Trump doesn't have nothing
[20:43] on
[20:45] saying Camala Harris she doesn't have
[20:48] nothing all those people all that media
[20:50] doesn't have nothing on what Satan has
[20:52] been trying to do from the
[20:55] beginning Satan how did he control the
[20:58] whole world how did he get everybody to
[21:00] vote for
[21:01] him how did he get
[21:04] Eve to to he went over there and he said
[21:08] well is that what God said well God said
[21:11] this God yeah
[21:14] but and what did she do she opened to
[21:17] the media the womb of her
[21:20] mind and she began to listen and brother
[21:23] bam says before she committed adultery
[21:26] she committed adultery with her mind
[21:28] first
[21:29] spiritual meaning before we even confess
[21:33] we have to believe First with the heart
[21:36] you
[21:37] confess or or or with a heart you
[21:40] believe unto righteousness and with the
[21:41] mouth you confess unto salvation well
[21:44] there's the opposite there where with
[21:47] the heart you begin to believe a lie
[21:50] until one of these days you're walking
[21:52] in that
[21:53] lie the lie that Satan told the lie that
[21:58] that he
[21:59] gives the propaganda the the things that
[22:01] he wants that he's done that all the way
[22:04] to
[22:06] heaven you know I people might disagree
[22:10] but but maybe that war was a political
[22:13] war because because we think about wars
[22:16] and we think about artillery we think
[22:17] about tanks we think about uh swords but
[22:21] we're
[22:22] flesh we're trying to hurt our flesh
[22:25] these were spiritual supernatural beings
[22:31] and and the Bible says that he drew with
[22:34] his tail the stars of God brother bam
[22:37] said it was the tale he
[22:39] told it it was the propaganda he told it
[22:42] was the media it was the
[22:44] word that he said trying to disprove
[22:48] everything that God was and is but
[22:51] Brothers God is his own
[22:53] word as much as as the LIE how good it
[22:57] is the word will always stand
[23:00] true and whenever somebody receives that
[23:03] word within their heart then they
[23:06] confess unto
[23:07] salvation and what's beautiful is I
[23:10] remember when I gave my heart to the
[23:12] Lord I I I believed in him I was 18
[23:16] years old and I gave my heart to the
[23:18] Lord and I I I I cried to my brother's
[23:21] um living
[23:23] room I got up and I said from this day
[23:26] on I'm going to give my heart to the
[23:28] Lord
[23:29] Lord
[23:31] and it was it's hard but I gave my heart
[23:34] to the Lord but when I got
[23:37] up my clothes didn't automatically
[23:41] change the the bald head that I had
[23:44] didn't grow so that I can look a little
[23:45] more uh
[23:47] presentable the Cortez that I was
[23:50] wearing I didn't change to nice uh
[23:53] whatever nice
[23:55] shoes my My Confession
[24:00] was before the the
[24:02] change so I can believe in my heart and
[24:06] I confessed but yet my whole body had to
[24:09] catch up to my
[24:11] confession my whole body had to change
[24:15] and and it was catching up I just didn't
[24:16] have the finances to change yet and a
[24:20] lot of times when you give your heart to
[24:22] the Lord something begins to change
[24:24] within you it's not something that you
[24:27] have to push and have to pull you don't
[24:29] have to try to make yourself a
[24:31] Christian you don't have we don't have
[24:33] to try to drag ourselves to church every
[24:35] single day look like a Christian yet our
[24:38] confession and our belief isn't isn't
[24:41] there brother brandham says um you
[24:43] shouldn't live higher than your
[24:45] confession you shouldn't live higher
[24:47] than your confession because your
[24:49] confession is showing what you
[24:52] believe and your confession will always
[24:55] change see when I gave my heart to the
[24:58] Lord I was able to say Lord I'm
[25:02] unworthy I'm a worm Lord I'm a sinner
[25:06] I'm worthy to go to hell and you know
[25:09] what happened I wasn't saying what I
[25:11] felt I was saying what his word was
[25:14] saying your word says I'm destined for
[25:17] hell because of the way I'm living
[25:20] because because I've been living outside
[25:22] that's your word Lord but then whenever
[25:26] I confess I'm changed changed something
[25:30] happens where I change then whenever
[25:33] that happens your confession has to
[25:35] change with it with your life and
[25:39] sometimes it's easy for us to beat
[25:41] ourselves down every single day it's
[25:44] easy to say Lord I'm unworthy I'm such a
[25:47] dummy I'm this I'm that what is it your
[25:51] confession isn't in sync with your
[25:54] life because as the more you you
[25:58] you change the different confession or
[26:02] the word has to
[26:04] change your word has to
[26:06] change I believe that's that's where
[26:09] that that spoken word
[26:12] is spoken word isn't just an enthusiasm
[26:15] and and saying whatever but it there's a
[26:18] life that goes
[26:20] first there's something that happens
[26:22] within the heart there's a believing
[26:24] within the heart and when that that
[26:27] happens the confession or the words you
[26:29] speak
[26:30] changed I believe that's what happened
[26:32] to brother brandham to the point where
[26:35] he his his life and his confession were
[26:38] so much in sync that he began to speak
[26:40] to squirrels into
[26:42] existence speak to the storm speak
[26:46] salvation and brothers and sisters even
[26:48] young
[26:49] people if you feel like you haven't
[26:51] given your heart to the Lord if you feel
[26:54] like you come to church but yet you
[26:56] haven't made that step yet
[26:59] it says that you believe in your heart
[27:02] that Jesus did something for
[27:04] you yes Jesus died for me yeah I'm I'm a
[27:08] knucklehead sometimes I I I don't listen
[27:11] or I'm perfect but I know I'm not right
[27:14] with the Lord yet I don't have a
[27:15] relationship with him but then you begin
[27:18] to
[27:19] believe and then you confess with your
[27:23] mouth and it says out of your mouth
[27:26] salvation takes place
[27:28] you speak your own salvation by the
[27:31] words you
[27:33] say salvation comes by your own
[27:37] confession salvation comes and every
[27:40] time you ascend it's because you're
[27:42] speaking what he says I remember Jesus
[27:46] people started accusing him because he
[27:48] he said he was God he said all the
[27:51] things you're saying are you making
[27:53] yourself
[27:54] God you you say that you're God
[27:59] Jesus didn't saywell I believe I am he
[28:02] didn't say what he believed confession
[28:05] isn't what you
[28:06] feel confession isn't what you believe
[28:10] or or what you what what you think you
[28:12] are confession is you say what he says
[28:15] he turned to them and he says it is
[28:18] written that I said that ye are Gods
[28:23] then why do you condemn me that I say
[28:24] that I am the Son of God what was it he
[28:28] was speaking the word even though people
[28:31] got mad even though they thought he was
[28:33] elevating himself he wasn't he was just
[28:35] speaking what God has confirmed with
[28:39] him that's what I love about Jesus
[28:42] because Jesus is the ultimate media it
[28:45] says in the beginning was the word and
[28:47] the Word was with God and the Word was
[28:49] God and that word was made flesh so now
[28:52] you have that media you have that word
[28:54] walking
[28:56] around you have him walking around and
[28:58] when you receive it you become that
[29:02] that's what's amazing about
[29:05] that so it's not how you
[29:08] feel but it's what you
[29:13] say that you
[29:15] believe brother Brenham says accept
[29:17] God's Gift he says now when you believe
[29:20] you were saved setting in your seat out
[29:23] wherever you was you accepted it and
[29:25] begin to confess it and tell people tell
[29:29] people you were saved well you kept on
[29:32] saying I'm
[29:33] saved when you believe it when you know
[29:36] God said did something for you believe
[29:39] it you don't need this great thing you
[29:42] don't need to say well does he need to
[29:43] come down the word is already there with
[29:47] you he says you you you say I'm saved
[29:51] the people saying ah there ain't no
[29:53] difference in
[29:54] you but you believe there was is that
[29:58] that right and when you kept your
[30:00] confession and after a while it worked
[30:04] righteousness all your neighbors and
[30:06] everybody knows you're saved now because
[30:08] you believed it you confessed it why
[30:11] what happened what changed you he is the
[30:14] high priest of your confession sitting
[30:17] on the right hand of the father making
[30:19] good what you're confessing now that's
[30:23] the same thing by healing you accept it
[30:25] you accept him as your healer renounce
[30:28] your feelings it's not by your feelings
[30:30] it's by faith say you're healed believe
[30:33] you're healed act like you're healed
[30:35] associate with those who believe in
[30:37] healing and God will bring you right out
[30:41] to a perfect soundness of hell it health
[30:43] it will not fail you have to say I
[30:46] believe and then just walk in it it's
[30:50] it's not telling people how you feel you
[30:52] you actually release something there's a
[30:56] releasing of of a spirit right there's a
[31:00] messenger and and there's a scripture
[31:03] where Jesus says my words are spirit and
[31:06] their
[31:07] life so
[31:10] words even the devil's words even the
[31:13] Serpent's words that was speaking to to
[31:17] Eve there was a spirit behind those
[31:20] words so whenever Jesus spoke a spirit
[31:24] would go and brother Bram actually said
[31:27] that the spirit quickens the word
[31:29] there's the word and the spirit are
[31:31] one and it goes and it enters into the
[31:34] heart and changes
[31:36] somebody that's why Brothers we have to
[31:39] watch what we
[31:40] confess we have to watch out the things
[31:43] that we say about our
[31:45] family about ourselves what do you think
[31:48] about
[31:49] yourself what do you think about certain
[31:53] situations because what you think is
[31:56] what you're going to say and then
[31:58] something goes
[31:59] out I I've said this before I think too
[32:02] many times but brother
[32:04] brandham when he was Discerning a
[32:08] woman
[32:10] he and this is in the video she comes up
[32:14] and and he's praying for her and he said
[32:15] okay go on your way and she begins to
[32:18] walk out he said wait hold on wait he
[32:22] said uh there's a dark shadow over you
[32:27] there's a dark shadow Shadow over you
[32:28] and usually when those Dark Shadows
[32:30] would go over it was because somebody
[32:32] had cancer or had some kind of
[32:36] disease but he said it's a
[32:39] lie it your pastor he oh he's accusing
[32:43] you of being a
[32:45] witch and and because he accused
[32:49] her you you know that saying sticks and
[32:52] stones may hurt my bones but words will
[32:54] never hurt
[32:55] me it said that there was a spirit
[32:57] spirit because of a
[33:00] lie and that that Spirit was tormenting
[33:03] her because he said you're a witch and
[33:06] he probably convinced everybody that she
[33:08] was a witch when she wasn't one but
[33:12] because of the words they spoke Spirit
[33:15] went
[33:16] out the Bible says death and life are at
[33:19] the power of the
[33:21] tongue death and life are at the power
[33:24] of the tongue we can Speak Life or we
[33:28] can speak death but we speak according
[33:30] to what's inside of us amen we speak
[33:34] according to what we
[33:36] believe and as the bride she goes higher
[33:39] and higher and higher her confession has
[33:42] to change the words that she
[33:46] speaks until there's life being spoken
[33:48] out to
[33:50] everybody why because the change there's
[33:53] a change within the heart first and and
[33:56] how does that Heart Change change is by
[33:58] what we intake in our
[34:00] lives the things that we intake I I
[34:03] don't know if you've ever I remember
[34:05] when I was working for insurance I would
[34:08] uh have to drive people around i' had a
[34:10] little team there and this is poor lady
[34:13] that she would just she had just such a
[34:15] hard life or seemed like it she would
[34:18] just tell me tell us all about
[34:21] it and um by the time I was done you
[34:25] know driving everybody around and and
[34:27] show sh everybody I was so
[34:30] tired I felt like I I just did like 20
[34:34] hours of Labor because they were just
[34:38] dumping all their media see a media with
[34:41] God the information is in their
[34:45] thoughts and the only way to get that
[34:48] thought out is to express it and then
[34:51] there has to be a he says my word will
[34:53] not return to me void there has to be a
[34:55] receiver to receive it and when you
[34:58] receive it if it's God's word life comes
[35:00] out if it's
[35:02] negative she's just giving me a piece of
[35:05] her mind she's giving me a piece of her
[35:08] her thoughts and her information and her
[35:10] life and she gives it to me and man I'm
[35:13] they're like oh my goodness I'm why
[35:16] because she she just
[35:19] unloaded all of the spirits that she's
[35:22] gone through in 30 years she unloaded it
[35:25] on a poor person on a poor victim
[35:29] what are we saying yeah what do we say
[35:32] do we speak Words of
[35:34] Life do we speak words o of of
[35:38] healing do we speak positive now this is
[35:41] not positive thinking and and all of
[35:44] those this is the
[35:46] word it doesn't matter about positive
[35:49] thinking if you take the word you become
[35:51] the word and not only that you don't
[35:54] only become that word but you begin to
[35:57] speak out that word you begin to say
[36:00] what he says praise God for that I
[36:03] remember David in closing I'm I know I'm
[36:06] really U short with my messages but I
[36:09] remember David whenever he was going to
[36:11] go up to d uh to
[36:13] Goliath and Goliath of course he sees
[36:15] this little run this little Ruddy kid
[36:19] and he says really you're going to
[36:20] disrespect me like this you're going to
[36:23] give me the a little
[36:26] raisin and what did David begin to do he
[36:30] begin to declare his victory before it
[36:33] even
[36:34] started see I had it the wrong way I
[36:38] usually declare and I worship L the Lord
[36:40] whenever the victory has already taken
[36:42] place I said Lord that was hard but
[36:44] thank you Father thank you for taking me
[36:47] through this and take thank you for
[36:48] taking me through that but David's like
[36:50] I'm going to chop your head
[36:52] off and and and the crows they're going
[36:55] to be eating off of your carcass
[36:58] he said what why he be to
[37:02] declare because he already knew what God
[37:05] already did for him amen he already knew
[37:08] that God did it through the bear and
[37:10] through the lion and so he began to
[37:12] confess and declare his victory before
[37:14] it even
[37:16] happened that's us
[37:18] today before you go out of that trial
[37:23] before you you receive what you need to
[37:25] receive you begin to confess it and you
[37:27] walk in it and people might say ah
[37:31] you're still talking about that ah
[37:33] you're still walking in that I don't
[37:35] care God said it I believe it it's going
[37:38] to happen not because I feel good not
[37:41] because it doesn't matter how I feel it
[37:43] matters what he said and I I am a
[37:47] fertile ground that's what we were made
[37:49] for we were made to receive God's word
[37:52] and eternal life be brought forth out of
[37:55] us we are the kingdom of God the kingdom
[37:59] of God cannot touch the Earth until it
[38:02] touches your
[38:03] soul the kingdom of God cannot be
[38:06] preached out to the people until it
[38:09] touches
[38:10] you and then you are that media you are
[38:14] that one that's going to speak out the
[38:16] word and you're not going to distort it
[38:19] like the devil you're not going to
[38:20] pervert it you are going to speak what
[38:23] he says cuz that is True Confession say
[38:27] what he says let us stand to our feet
