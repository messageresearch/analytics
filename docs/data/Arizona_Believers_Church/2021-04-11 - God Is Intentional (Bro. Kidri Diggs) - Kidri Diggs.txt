TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] amen you know we accounted a privilege to be here with you we certainly thank god for brother aaron and man we've known each other many many years but we've never been on this side of the gospel him pastor and mere evangelist so we we god is you know he's always doing things that surprises us amen but one thing i want you to understand is that he's not surprised he knows exactly what you are who you are and what you're supposed to be doing amen so we thank god for him we thank god for all of you who are here amen and i pray that you're looking for the lord jesus amen if you have your bibles let's let's take our bibles let's go to the book of um um job chapter 2. job chapter 2 and i i want to read verse 9 and then we're going to flip to um isaiah 29 if you haven't say amen okay job chapter 2 verse 9 the bible says then said his wife unto him does thou still retain thy integrity curse god and die but he said unto her thou speaketh as a foolish woman speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips isaiah 29 isaiah 29 and let's start reading that verse um let's go to uh 18 16. isaiah 29 and 16 the bible says surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's dick clay for shall the work say unto him shall the work say of him that made it he made me not or shall the things frame shake say of him that frame it he had no understanding amen going to read a familiar verse of scripture as you as you sit amen the bible says romans 8 chapter 20 romans 8 verse 28 it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose amen may the lord bless you love his word you can have your seats how many happy in the lord today but aaron you're right this is kind of far back you must know i'm a walker amen but today by the grace of god my subject is god is intentional god is intentional now if you just take the word intentional intentional means on purpose you know and when we think about god and his intentions you know concerning us he's a purposeful god that there's nothing that god does that doesn't have any meaning so god is not like us he doesn't waste time he's not wasteful for anything that he does there's a purpose now what i what i really want to strike i want to show by the grace of god that in our lives you and us all of us today that we are exactly where god wants us to be amen i'm not necessarily talking about the church building but i'm talking about your life amen you are exactly where god wants you amen because he's a god that is intentional amen you know if if i could make this picture even more clearer how many understands that god created the devil hallelujah talk to me now god created his own enemy god knows what makes him tick god knows what gets him going god knows his strength and his weaknesses god knows how to defeat his own enemy hallelujah so you think about god god made satan with the purpose intentionally being able to defeat him whoa hallelujah now you think about that god who created satan with the purpose of him knowing that satan can bring out the best of god only to defeat him now when that god that holy ghost gets in you it doesn't change he still intentionally will defeat the devil hallelujah so i want you to be glad with the life god has given you thus far because he's a purposeful god and he doesn't make mistakes he doesn't tell lies hallelujah he doesn't fall up short everything he does is right on time it's intentional hallelujah and you know sometimes we look at our life and you say god why am i going through this all why did i go through that or why did i go through this simply because god knows exactly what you're supposed to be so he allows you to go through certain things to get you back to the place that he originally saw you amen because we have to look that god he doesn't have another thought so whatever he's thinking about you he already sought it before the foundation of the world he just has to get you in line to fulfill his thinking hallelujah so sometimes that causes a little trouble sometimes that causes trial and tribulation but god is saying okay if i do this they'll become that if i do this they'll become that so he's constantly redirecting our lives on this side in flesh to get us where we're supposed to be as spirit beings hallelujah but you know as i look in the in the scriptures and look in the word of god and what we just read he's intentional you know there's a song we're seeing and i'm sure some of you may have heard it it's called intentional and it says all things are working for his good he's intentional never failing see so i want you to realize that if god is doing something in your life how many of us are going through trials don't be ashamed that's a good thing because if you're not going through anything how will you ever become something greater hardly if you're not going through anything that challenges you you could never come into something greater that god has called you to be so the challenge is good the thing is can you surrender to the challenge hollywood surrender to it and say god have your way in my life now church if we look i hope you all don't mind me taking off my jacket if we look church in the bible you know when i read the book of job you know uh job he went through a lot but what i want you to understand it wasn't of job's choosing how many knows why joe went through what he went through who caused job to go through that battle who was the one spearheading job losing all his riches losing all his possessions losing all of his children you know even as even his wife looked at him one day and said i just can't stand the way your breath fell it's for real it did happen in the bible but she got to the place where she couldn't believe that we're going through this life was good and now all of a sudden we're going through all of us and she comes and tells job curse your god and die but you look church the whole battle was simply over a conversation a conversation that god had with the one he always defeated and now satan comes he's walking to and fro we know the story he's walking to and fro and then god comes with something intentional and he says hey devil have you considered my servant joel now god is pointing the devil in the direction he wants him to go hallelujah and what is that direction in the believer's way hell yeah now job was a believer now you got the one he's believing in is going to make his life a little bit more strenuous now he tells the devil hey i want you to go all that you're desiring go and put your hand on joe he said well you can't take his life see satan has boundaries satan has restrictions god only lets him go so far why because he intentionally told us that he cannot put any more on you than you can bear so no matter what the trial is we are to rejoice this morning because we got to come on top we have to overcome it because god can't change his word he intentionally said that nothing will be able to overcome us hallelujah so if we take that mind frame what kind of people should we be hallelujah what kind of church service should this be holy whether your bills are behind whether you're seeking your body satan cannot win why because god intentionally gave him permission to let you go through that holy satan can't do anything but first god allows it holy but what i love about it some of you may have heard me say this that before job even went through the trial god had a testimony service about job he said okay satan have you considered my servant job there's none like him in all the earth think about that god is still the same he's bragging on you to the devil while you're going through your trial earlier because he has to give permission for satan to even take you through certain things but before he goes to it he's basically telling the devil you're going to lose you're going to lose they're still like him and all the earth you go lose hallelujah they're still like job in all the earth but since you insist go ahead and now satan is so happy and so giddy because he gets to mess up things but all these things that he's messing up is making jobs stronger church look at that back in in the book of exodus the bible says that the more egypt afflicted the christian israel the more they multiply and the stronger they got earlier so you might not want me to say this but i'm going to say it affliction is good trials are good tribulation is good why because it's the tender hand of jehovah oh my but you look i love joe's response you know church we got to get to a place where we stop worrying about what people say about us because people may not understand what god is doing in your life they can only look on the outside and say hmm i wonder why this i wonder why that but god is intentional he has a purpose hallelujah and you know joe's friends them message believers they come up and now they're criticizing job with no proof all they got is that he's lost his riches he's lost this he's lost that he lost his children but they got no proof that he ever sinned all they got is accusation and now they're letting how the mind battles they're having hardly changed the testimony of their friend in their mind oh my how often do we see somebody going through something and we make a prejudgment with no evidence we're using our own human intellect to decide what should happen in that person's life but you know hollywood god was intentional by letting rahab go into prostitution it was intentional why because she had to be there for the spies many many years later when they came it had not only did it have to be a prostitute but it had to be somebody that could receive the word so he was intentional think about oh my you say oh my god let her uh prostitute it was intentional oh my and i know you may be looking at this and you'll be saying [Music] brothers i don't know about that well look what came out of it that's how you judge something the prophet god said you don't deserve it with your eyes you deserve you discern it by what comes out of it hallelujah you know and from that point if you take the prophet of god he said that rahab hallelujah she went into prostitution because she had sick parents so in her heart she never really wanted to be a prostitute but this was her way of survival and this was her way of taking care of her family hallelujah you notice when you say brothers i don't know about that well let's look at th let's look at the context you know a lot of times we look at something but we don't have the right context you know when i think about the message of the hour you know i'm not worried about hallelujah how many deers and how many bears and things brother branham shot that's not the context the context is the revelation of the word the context is the the context is not worrying about how much uh cherry pie he ate that's not the context the context is how much god walked in that life that's the context let's stay with that amen so you know you got people now these message believers who once believed what we believed but now they got the context wrong it's not about a bear that he never got it's about the god that was revealed let's not major on a minor hallelujah but you know church uh when we think about the context of things if you look at at the very context of what this man was going through now they're looking at it saying oh he's going through this he's going through that they're not even realizing that the hand of god is behind the whole thing and you look at the context of rahab's life when you're working through the scriptures they look at her and say well she was a prostitute but listen to the language when she met the word huh when the word came she started talking to him she said hey i want you guys to leave me a true token don't that sound like brian she didn't say leave a scarlet she said leave me a token hallelujah and not only that church just to show what was really in her heart and to show that she really didn't want to be that kind of person she said give me something that will save my father's house so in her heart all she really wanted was the best for her family so i could see why the prophet of god said that she was forced into that because of her love for her family because now she has a chance to come out of it who is she thinking about her family but you look at her being in the life of prostitution god is intentional why didn't he lead the spies up to a bishop's house or somebody else's house because they would have probably went against what god had did they probably couldn't believe what god was already doing out there in the wilderness because rahab said she said hey men's hearts melt for fear they can hear what your god has done at the red sea they can hear about how he fed them and he gave water out of a rock all the different we heard about your god and just hearing her faith was being built up enough to surrender when they come god allow these things to happen intentionally so when rahab's chance came she could go free oh yeah and when they came home she said give me a true token they said okay as long as you don't give out none of our business rahab kept a mouth chat secret believer hallelujah you know what and y'all probably heard me say that that's one of the greatest ministries of this end time one of the greatest ministries of the end time is the shut your mouth ministry stop worrying about everybody else stop worrying about what this person doing or that person doing the greatest ministry you could ever practice is to just set it up i learned that firsthand hallelujah you know because you can look at something in your children's life or whatever you may be thinking god why don't you intervene you know what to say lord i'll do it and god says shut up shut your mouth let me take care of us because i am the partner oh my church you know one of my favorite classes in high school was ceramics i mean y'all can't believe it right one of my favorite classes was the pottery class hardly it wasn't real masculine but what it dealt with pottery ceramics it deals with the image of your mind hello and what you got in your mind now coming before you at your own hands oh god think about that church god is the partner let me read you something right quick listen let me read you a quote from um from from micheal angelo we all know who michael angelo is right he's a great sculptor hey man one of michael angelo's quotes he says i saw the angel in the marble and carved until i set him free isn't that powerful as as as a as a artist he looks at a piece of rock and he has an image in his mind and he starts to work with a hammer and chisel to form that image that's it'll rock her and once that image meets the image of his mind he says then i set it free hallelujah think about that church holy we are six and five field dirt but god has an image in his mind so what does he do he hammers and he triples he trials to relation what is he doing he's trying to set us free you won't go free until you meet the image of the sculptor but if that rock had feelings when that hammer healed it was like ooh that children will say ah ooh ah but he has to keep on sculpting see i love the i love the message the masterpiece because you have to think about it the image in michelangelo's mind is never changed he probably had family he probably took breaks to go eat lunch he probably went out of time but every time he came back to that rock he had the same image of moses in his mind hallelujah churchill from generation to generation no matter what has happened ebola uh swine flu covet the image of god's mind of you does not change hallelujah let me read you know he says every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it this man got some real inspiration huh he said every piece of stone hunger has an image it has it's it's there's something in it but it takes the sculptor to discover it and you think about it they may be just looking at us as just regular people but there's a sculptor behind us that he's hammering he's chiseling and he he's sawing and everything else he got to do to get you into what you're supposed to be hallelujah because the prophet of god he said he said god i'm gonna read you a quote uh this is in the message um this is in question and answers he says and now in other words when you become a young man or a young woman and like god takes a picture of you now no matter how old and wrinkled how disfigured whatever it will be that will win right on down through and the body may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up by lions whatever but it will not change who you are in god's mind it can be disfigured you can have your head cut off but if you die hallelujah with the life of christ in you when the resurrection takes place holy that image that god has before the foundation of the world we'll rise we shall rise what's rising us that same power that raised up christ from the dead and you think about him he was crucified he was marred he was messed up more than any other man but when he rose he rose as god trials tribulations what is he doing god is producing the picture of his mind hell yeah because if you take you know now we're in such a technology age i want to let all you millennials know this was not the original way to take pictures hate to bust your bubble was not apple was not samson it was polaroid but you think about it let me take you through the process in the olden days what they would do was snap the picture and then you have to take that undeveloped picture and take it to a dark room hallelujah the only way that picture could be developed hallelujah was in a dark room hallelujah that there was something about the dark room that unveiled the mystery of what was taken out oh yeah it was something about that dark room that could unveil the true mystery of what that picture was when it was snapped hundley and what god does god allows you and i to go through a dark room because it's that dark room that's untelling the mystery of who you are hallelujah because without a child god will never know if you would stand cause we'd just be a bunch of small brats with god given us everything we ever wanted but he takes you through tests he takes takes you through trials just so he could show the whole world that you really are his child but you take that picture and it develops once it's developed it has to be hanged out to dry hallelujah there's no good just laying there it has to be hanged out to dry and sometimes we feel like as christians god has hung us out to dry but church it's intentional he's still in control see sometimes god wants to see what you're going to do well he already knows but what he does he does things to humble us to prove us to get us in a better spirit hallelujah and you know without trials without certain situations some of us we wouldn't even pray but because certain things happen we fall on our knees hallelujah so god he intentionally does things and you think about all that he did to job he allowed the enemy to do to job job lost everything but i love joe's response and i want you to catch this today job's response to his wife is honey do you expect to receive all good at the hand of god and no evil oh what are you saying brother jesus i'm saying god is in control of evil too he allows it to happen why for his purpose he allows certain things to move the way it moves for his purpose he allowed 68 million jews to die why to drive the rest of them back to the homeland oh my what a wonderful god so when we look at these things church we ought to have the mindset that oh god is in control now look he says but now this picture is the main thing then it's resurrect then this resurrection those those gasses and acids and the things come right back into the place and develops this picture again now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 we're talking about in the mind of god now it wasn't taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years at your best when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world it was put in god's great file and for those of you who may be in business hallelujah you know what a file is a file is something that you can always go to because you remember where you put it a file is where you put important things something that you may have to come back and prove hallelujah come on somebody and you know god has a foul of all of his children and what he does god he can see certain things going happening in your life and he go to his file and he says yep they're supposed to go through that and you may get off track and you go through this and he'll say yep they're supposed to go through that see god knows exactly everything about you in his file in his file some of you have blue eyes some of you have brown eyes but that foul does not change honestly it's there for god to keep reminding himself of what he's done hallelujah but think about it think about this what if you could read your own file oh my what if you could go into god's great economy and pull up your own file that god has on you would that do something for you would that do something for you would that would that give you even more courage to to serve the lord well let me tell you he already has he's allowed you to look into the file of his mind when he sent the vindicated prophet he sent the vindicated prophet expressing the foul of the end time believer hallelujah because church i want you to understand the message is not books and tapes the message is the body of believers hallelujah redeemed holy ghost field believe us the message is not a city or state the message is the heart of the believer hallelujah am i taking anything away from the prophet no he tell you the same thing hug because if it was if it was a certain place a hurricane can come and tear that place down and destroy the message or blizzard or or hailstorm or whatever and destroy the message but no the message hallelujah is hidden in the heart of those that receive christ holy the true unveiling of christ hallelujah through a vindicated word that's been released in our day but as we look and we think about god and his great picture and all the things that he does you know some people ask the question they say if god was really real why would he allow this to happen he's intentional and most of you know that at a young age i had cancer cancer not in my arm or my leg but canceling my brain but that was intentional you think i'm gonna give the credit to the devil you think i'm saying oh the devil did this to me no if you allow yourself to say the devil did this to me you're saying the devil has control of your life so in my good days i give god praise in my bad days i give god praise in sickness and in hell i give god praise because he's the he's the only one that's controlling my being but church just to show you where i'm coming from at a very very young age i had cancer in my brain you know what the purpose of that cancer the whole purpose of that cancer was to hardly show me that there is a god because before that time i never knew god was a healer so god allowed me to go through something hungry to experience his attributes oh my so what is he doing for you amen god allows you to go through things that you may experience a portion of who he is he told abraham you're blessed to be a blessing but you look at all he had to go through everything that he went through was purposeful to get him in place so that he could be the father of nations hallelujah he didn't he would have never gotten there hurry up without him going to the kingdom and been like seeing his wife and taking his wife he never got there he had to go through that he would have never got there without lot hallelujah going down into sodom then you have to go down to the sodom and to fight take lot back and then resist those kings he had to go through all that because what was he doing it was forming him into the father of faith and god constantly does those things in the scripture that it looks it sometimes it looks ridiculous it's like lord why would you do that he's forming you into the image of his mind that great picture that he took before the foundation of the world and you look at how he did it church you think about this you know the bible says moses refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter church what reason did he have to refuse to be identified with them those people were nothing but good to him are we talking about the same moses think about it moses was abandoned in a river he was found harelia by someone uh who was the the daughter of the pharaoh riches upon riches and he was raised in a palace he had the best food the best teaching the best of the best so what reason would he ever have to say i don't want to be identified with y'all what was it it was god putting everything in place moses had to experience hollywood the greatness of what life could hardly give him only to get to a place to reject it and to see that what god had for him was greater hallelujah think about it i want you to don't take this lightly pharaoh of um moses was next in line to be pharaoh to run the world they have anything he'd ever want but then he got to a place where he was dissatisfied because he saw something that made him twitch he was at the right place at the right time according to god moses next in line saw an egyptian taken beaten on a hebrew and moses saw it in that moment in that moment his feelings started to change what was happening the picture of god was now coming into place hallelujah he wasn't there to be a pharaoh he was there to be a deliverer hallelujah so god allowed him to go through all that to get to that place now he didn't start as a bunch of peaches and roses holy he had that desire and that desire put him on the run that desire harley made him lose fellowship hollywood with his sisters and his brothers that desire made him leave home leave the palace leave everything that he ever known but that desire was the calling of god and sometimes we wonder why we go through certain things it's it's god being awakening inside of us so we have to be in a place where we seem distraught or confused but it's god in that moment taking full control of our life and in a time when moses didn't know whether he was coming or he was going he was right in the intentional plans of god because hallelujah the burning bush wasn't in egypt it was on the back side of the hill and it wasn't there in 40 years it was there 40 years later so god working out his whole plan he had to have all this happen honestly he even had to meet a wife who was fiery he didn't understand what he was getting into when he saw that pretty woman at the well you probably oh my she's nice and then one day she cut off some skins bloody husband to me but look even the prophet god said moses had a temple but god hallelujah used sappora to deal with that temper now sometimes i ain't telling you to be a certain way with your husband what i'm saying is for moses she was the best that he could ever have heard and in those moments hardly god was working on him becoming who he was in his mind are you with me church in church you think about it from there everything in moses life it played out not his way but god's way because moses didn't understand what he was going through he kept running to god saying lord why me why i don't listen not on that and god begin to remind him of his purpose what i love about god you can't see what he can see hallelujah oh my church sometimes i feel broke as a stick but i have to realize i can't see what god can think oh oh my when you stand sometimes in need and your finances are troubled and different things god is basically saying i got you right where i want you so you can pray and when i love god he's always working on both ends you just have to be doing what you're supposed to do on your end hallelujah church and when you look at it hallelujah you look at the grace of god and you look at the fees that moses went through in all his life and he kept going to god and said lord why me why does even at the first sounding of god putting that picture in motion moses rejected it he said i heard the cry of my people moses am i in the book am i in the bible church he said i've heard the crime of my people and i've come down and i'm sending you moses god said he come down but he said to moses where was god going to be and moses think about that against his will god is saying i'm gonna step inside of you and i'm gonna deliver my people using you but look god has to elevate our thinking even like right now some of you may be sitting here saying hmm this is this is all right this is nice hmm it's it's a little warm in here but you know i'm comfortable those are not the right thoughts the thoughts you should be having is lord speak to me lord i have certain needs certain situations in my life and god see i love to say lord if you are god do what you've always done hallelujah because you can't change if you've always done a thing a certain way you have to remain that way and now you look church and you see moses now he's in a place hallelujah where he comes to god god says moses i'm going to send you moses is now saying god i can't talk because of zappora see sapporo was put in the picture to humble moses to take away some of that anger change this whole statute change his whole being to the way the bible says there'd never be another man as meek as moses why so sisters you have a place in that man's life he might can't see it but god does hallelujah and you think about the church now he's now used to a place hallelujah where he comes before god and now he's making all his excuses and you know what church that takes me to jeremiah 29 don't get nervous i'm about to close you text me to jerry of jeremiah 29 the bible says god says for i know the plans i have concerning thee holy what i love about that god says thoughts of peace and not of evil if you got trouble in your life hallelujah just keep standing keep going keep pressing because it has to turn out to be peace because that's the only thing god sees when he sees you hallelujah but now moses comes before god he's like lord i i i just can't talk and god has a hand for everything who made your mouth am i in the book that's what he's doing most moses trying to get out of it he's making excuses see god has a foul he knows he knows what your mouth is supposed to say so now he's standing there before god making every excuse he said god i can't talk he says hey who made your mouth and mostly i can't do this i can't just and moses and god says moses i'm sick of it and then god elevates his thinking and he tells moses he looks moses straight in his face he says moses moses got every excuse i can't talk i can't do this i can't he says moses you be god and let aaron be your prophet he elevated the whole scene moses is just thinking you know i'm just a random i'm just a regular ordinary man that can't talk and god comes to moses and tell moses you be me and let aaron be you whoa go ahead you be god to the people and let aaron be your prophet and then moses comes back down and you go to pharaoh he says let my people go who's talking out of him god that's all he's trying to do church he's trying to get us in an intentional place where he can live out of us but we have to see the blessing in the things we go through you know before i close i love talking about joseph and we know the life of joseph it was a very hard life but god had a picture of joseph he had a foul and you know from that beginning joseph was being used of god he was loved of his father and hated of his brother hallelujah but that was god's plan some of you might be the only ones in your family that's in this message you know that's god's plan oh i took away your misery just now oh lord i don't think i can hold on anymore my sisters won't fellowship with me god is intentional oh lord i'm the only brother in my house send me some fellowship god uses all these things for a deeper in-depth connection with him hallelujah and now you look at it joseph here his brothers are jealous of him because his father loves him amen but you know what jealousy wasn't good enough he had to turn to hatred and god allowed it you know where to turn the hatred one day hey man i like saying this one day isaac got inspired and said i'm gonna make my son a quota many colors and not only am i gonna give him this coat i'm going to give it to him in front of all his brothers and they already already feeling the certain way daddy like him more than he like me and now holly god has inspired the father to bless his son in front of all his brothers and you know he gave he gave joseph that coat joseph put that coat on like a ric flair robe and he turned around and spit around in that roll dun dun dun dun dun dun his brothers looked at him with hatred with envy simply because his father loved him why why would god allow that because it there's a caravan coming from egypt and joseph had to be in the pit he wasn't going to get the egypt on his own he had to get there as a slave oh my my think about it church the picture of god the intentional works of god god took him out of a loving home that he could experience poverty and slavery to get him in position oh my oh brother aaron i thought we were going to jump and shout we are when you can realize everything is working for your good now he has to fight the spirit of jealousy and his jealousy turned into hatred so much hatred to a couple of his brothers wanting to kill him but he's a reuben or simeon one of them said no we're gonna kill him we're just gonna put him in the pit why because the caravan was coming holly church in in in that moment one of the darkest days of his life he didn't even realize that he was typing out christ whoa what about you hallelujah you may even realize in the in the darkest day of your life in the most strenuous trial ever you're a type of christ god is using that intentionally to show the world that he is still on the earth but he's in a body of believers and he didn't even realize in that moment him being sold into slavery hallelujah he was typing out what judas would do to christ many many years to come holy so that's why we either have to complain when we go through stuff we ought to say lord give me more grace now church he's thrown in the pit hallelujah soul into slavery a type of christ now he gets in the part of his house and his wife hallelujah she says joseph come live with me and y'all know that wasn't just one time she was chasing that man and now he has to have the strength hallelujah to fight against lust hallelujah holy and make it stand why would god take him out of a good stable secure loving home and now put him in a place hungry where everything about him is being tested there is a greater picture and now the bible doesn't say what her name is but now she tells a lie on them just like they did christ and now he's thrown in jail we get in jail he's mistreated but what i love about joseph in the midst of all the things he's going through he did not lose his connection with god even though hallelujah he false he fought hatred and jealousy the gift of god kept working in his life even though he was thrown in the pit the gift of god kept working in his life even though he was in part of his house getting lied on fighting lust demons the gift of god was still working in his life now church he's abandoned he's in the jailhouse he's in the darkest place he could ever be in jail and innocent and the gift of god is still working in his life we don't have any excuses again i said we ought to throw our hands up and say thank you lord thank you lord i'm able to see it thank you lord i'm able to go through it hallelujah remember he put scripture in there specifically for us to to them that overcome her will i grant to sit with me in my throne why would he put it in there if there's not a people that's going to overcome so what we ought to be saying is i'm that one that's going to overcome hallelujah no matter what i'm going through i'm that one that's going to overcome no matter what they say about my message i'm that one that's going to overcome hallelujah now the baker and the butler they come down holly why did they have to go do what they went through because joseph was down there and you may not realize it sometimes people go through things just so they can meet you because you have the answer oh that one made me want to shout right then in my darkest moment in my darkest time you mean to tell me god is using me to be the answer for somebody else's need you may be thinking lord why me why am i going through this why because somebody is watching you somebody is watching you they're watching how you're going through it and it's by your life they're going to get victory amen oh yeah oh my church i feel the holy spirit moving i want you to take it personal today the things that you're going to going through god is shaping and molding us that we can be here in christ instead well we can be his hands but we can be his feet we can be his voice and in that moment hell yeah the bacon and the butler come down hallelujah with dreams that they've had and now joseph is standing there and joseph interprets their dreams why because there was a great there was going to be a greater dream that needed to be interpreted hallelujah he was the answer in that dark dark moment everything that happened up until that point was intentional it was the hand of god oh my oh my and i love joseph's response hallelujah look church as time went on and and whichever one the bigger the butler one died and one got restored then pharaoh has a dream and the servant says i remember my mistake there's a man in your jailhouse wow not one of your one of your scholars or one of your great men no there's a man in your jailhouse a man that's fought jealousy a man that's fought lies a man that's fought depression but he has the gift of god in his life to give you the answer you've been looking for even though he's lost his family her church think about this in order for job in order for joseph to get in place he had to lose his fellowship with his family he didn't get a chance to grow up hallelujah with his brothers loving on him church he was going through this journey for 17 years and we go through something two years ain't even been two years yet but these were talking about this pandemic stuff even been two years yet and people quit in church won't even come back they've become online ministers streamers they love those comments they love those kind of church services because at home you can pause me oh no now i don't like what he's saying honey hit fast forward you can make me dance the way you want me to dance if you just get sick of me you can delete me see we love to have control but god is the only one that's going to have control hallelujah and let me say this brother aaron didn't ask me to say this but let me say this normally when when when new churches develop you have to come hallelujah that there is a vision there's a vision huddle that god has given a man hollywood to start a work now what you have to do you have to surrender to that vision you can't come from your house or whatever you say well i want to do this and i want to do that no see if it's okay with the vision that's already being purchased see we have to come as help us of one another amen that way things work in harmony and we can see it intentionally but if you come with the mindset that i'm gonna i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do that because if the way i wanna do it you might mess up the whole vision because you think about the intentional the intentional uh god hallelujah how did rebecca meet isaac she met isaac because she fulfilled the vision of eliza oh yeah and he was intentional by what he prayed the next god he said a woman that's not even gonna give me something to drink but she's going to give me drink and all my camels honey and by her fulfilling her elijah's vision he knew that she was the one for isaac church and we are a people who are fulfilling the vision of malachi 4. or the vision of jesus christ should i say holy because whatever vision eliezer had he got from abraham hallelujah abraham told him i want you to go down here and get my son uh our wife hallelujah so everything elies had belonged to abraham the gifts he had the gold the jewelry he belonged to abraham his confirmation all of it it belonged to abraham everything about elijah came from abraham everything about brother brother came from god none of it was his own and what i love about the whole situation when you truly realize the picture remember when the seven when the seven angels were seen and everybody was so excited about the angels and this and that god came down he said turn the picture yo looking at the wrong vein this is not about my angels this is about me and you made them turn the picture and once you turned the picture of the angels you saw the head of christ inside holy and that's what we ought to see in this message we have to be able to see christ inside of it let's turn the picture it's not about great preachers and great men and great buildings it's all about christ that's the picture hallelujah church when we think about where we are right now let me let me get the time when we think about where we are there's a lot of things that have taken place over the past couple years but ask yourself what is god trying to show you hallelujah even in this pandemic what is god trying to show see i asked myself that same question i believe god is trying to show us if we really are what we say we are hell yeah because some people have disappeared never to be seen again oh my and what what caused that to happen pandemic the bible says whatever can be shook we'll be shaking so god allows these things to shake the tree now you got to ask yourself do you belong or don't you belong and only you can answer that question you know as a sister in my church if if you you think about jobs and all this stuff system my church at the beginning of the year she had got a new job but the pandemic stuff was still going on she had got sick she didn't get cobra but she got i think she had double pneumonia she had a new job and she couldn't work but she had a new job so when it came time to get paid she was thinking oh lord lord jesus i need another stimulus but you know what god was intentional god wanted to show her no matter what's taking place if i do something for you nobody can't take it church she had worked that job in three months but she's getting a check every week do you serve that god hallelujah another friend of mine hallelujah this is before the pandemic but where are those people that will say lord let my schedule be around you lord give me a job where i won't miss church lord give me a job where i'll always be where i need to be concerning the things of you huh where are those people hungry i remember when i was younger that's the way we used to pray lord give me a job where i could be in church when i have meetings i can go to the meetings but now we're like lord you understand i got to work you telling god will he understand oh my friend of mine don't get nervous i ain't got too much longer you know i have to say i'm about to close because those words got power we know those words got power see when i say that some of your eyes get bright seen those words make people say amen about the clothes they're falling asleep i'm about to go hey man brother amen preach my brother preach so if you look tired a little disinterested let me give you some strength i'm about to close but another friend of mine he was working a first shift job now i'm talking about the picture of god god will allow us to get in situations so he could show his grace church he was he was working a first shift job and the boss man and the team leader the head boss and the team leader came to him and say we need you to work second shift now if you know a second shift in the second shift is 3-11 that means no church so they asked him could he work and he looked them straight in their faces and said no whoa i know some of you think god understand we got to work listen i'm a witness before i took this life of faith that i'm on now you know living off the gospel god created a job for me because i told the lord i said lord i want to be in church where when when whenever we have in church i can be there if we go into a special meeting i can be there god created a job i was working at the city god created a job for me honey and you know about house words i work monday and tuesday was off every wednesday which was a church day third i worked thursday and friday and was off by one o'clock friday which was a church day and then i was off every saturday and sunday and you tell me god can't answer your prayer i tell you you don't know the god i serve hallelujah and not only that i had three weeks vacation so i could take two days off and have five days off wow it gets me excited just thinking about that but now i'm on a whole nother journey oh yeah but church this young man he's working 3-11 the boss and the head man came to me and said hey i need we need you to work second ship he said can't do it he said why he said because i go to church about seven they say church he said yeah i ain't gonna miss church he said well we need you to work he said well i ain't gonna work it they ain't gonna work it they say church mean that much he said yeah church means that much i want to be in church to hear the word so to say either you take now it comes down to ultimates it says either you take this position or you're gonna be looking for another job you say well i guess i'm gonna be looking for another job he walked out the office and the boss man the head man had a talk they went back on the floor and got them told them to come back in he says hey what days you have at church you say wednesday friday sunday he said uh what time does church start he said about seven say what time is over until don't let the devil trap you now because you're going to get exactly what you asked for hallelujah hallelujah don't ask for twenty thousand when you really need fifty thousand hallelujah don't say lord oh lord father please bless me with a piece of indeed you're gonna get a piece of junk because you said a piece of car let me leave that alone y'all know how i feel about that hallelujah i just believe god can do anything church this young man they call him back in and he says hey what time the church starts about 7 30. what time is over until we really don't have no set time for the end he said it means that much to you say yeah they say okay shut the door that's what we're gonna do they say when when on your church days when church start we want you to go ahead and go to church but this is what we want you to do don't clock out we're going to pay you to go to church hallelujah that's the god we serve church when was the last time he was paid to go to church [Applause] oh my jesus is real he said look we want you we're gonna you go in the church don't clock out when church is over you just come on back they saying don't tell nobody we doing this for you but he couldn't help but try to believe us why because somebody else may have been in a position like that that if they stand god will take care of the rest of it hallelujah that's the god we serve because he has a whole picture in that picture hardly god wanted that brother in church because in that moment hallelujah he meant something to that congregation church if we try the lord the lord will show himself to be mighty and strong listen i'm going to read this one more thing i'm trying to get out the way harley listen this isn't a reproach for the cause of the word he's saying god sets the time and has a purpose for everything that he does there is nothing happens just accordingly to those who love the lord and are called according oh let me read that again there is nothing happens just accidentally to those who love the lord and are called according to his calling see so today is not an accident you say oh i just felt led to come to church no you are a part of this picture you're supposed to be here now what you got to do is figure out why because god's not going to tell us everything he wants us to seek his face hallelujah so if you're here maybe god is trying to get you to have a closer walk like i said me getting cancer was all about god bringing up a revelation of jehovah rapha and it took cancer to bring out a revelation of god as a healer that was already there inside of me because remember everything that's in that seed is already in it so the revelation of healing was already there in me it just took a situation of need that it may come out hallelujah and it took that holy that situation of cancer hallelujah to bring out that god is a divine healer and you know what once he does it it's forever i don't believe in that remission and come back and all this no if god does it it's forever and that's been been over 25 years ago and i've never had another reoccurrence why because i believe god now there have been other demons that have come and tried diabetes said he's coming he's tried and failed type 1 and type 2 have failed why because he's the same god hallelujah i went to the daughter and they said he got diabetes i said no i don't she said yes you do you got diabetes i said no i don't the nurse got mad with me just just gone just thrown in the other room you know when they mad with you they start mistreating you she's supposed to say okay mr d's we want to put you in this other room around here this and that your glucose levels and this guy's gone in the other room i ain't my fault i'm a believer so i get in the other room and i'm waiting on the doctor doctor comes in and she's like hey mr diggs how you doing everybody all right i'm about to close hey mr dicks how you doing i said i'm doing pretty good now this may be this may be a challenge for some of you who have who have proclaimed to have diabetes i'm telling you you can be delivered of it today because i'm a witness that has tried to come upon me twice and probably many other times that i didn't accept holly but i'm gonna show you how it's working honey so i'll get into the doctor i'm gonna show you how the doctors are thinking i get in there and she said you got diabetes and glucose and sugar levels and all those look my sugar levels aren't supposed to be high i'm a christian i'm sweet hallelujah ain't nothing sour and salty about me i'm sweet my levels aren't supposed to be high hallelujah but now church i mean that doctor comes he says how you doing mr diggs i said i'm doing quite lovely she said okay that's good and she's looking around see everything going good everything's going fine now keep in mind the nurse didn't told me i had diabetes and now the doctor comes in and she pulls out the chart she looks at the chocolate whoa right here it shows you guys i'm saying no no i don't i ain't got no diabetes so yeah mr diggs right here on your chart i say i do not have diabetes i'm talking to a doctor she says okay she said that's what we're going to do we're going to take a blood test y'all know in my spirit i was doing like this yeah wow wow glory well i'm sitting on the table like this but in my spirit she told me she gonna give me a diagnosis based upon my blood i was having a praise dance inside because the last time i know i was covered by the blood i'm under the blood hollering and when god sees me hallelujah he don't see diabetes all he sees is the sacrifice of jesus christ so if you're going to judge me by that i'm already ill hallelujah so she goes get the little machine walks out the room and i'm trying to keep my composure you know i want to shout real bad you know cause i'm like hey man she's gonna judge me by the blood thank you lord see god will give you signs that you know that you've already won hallelujah and now she comes in and she pricks my finger and the little machine goes she looks at she says this is strange how can you have high glucose levels over here but right here according to your test everything is normal now she started asking me questions like i'm a doctor how can this happen i'm like i don't know i'm here i'm gonna tell you what was happening over here in the nurse's station it was a demon trying to get in and he was seen he was seen over here by the nurse and now he's trying to get into my thoughts and be accepted over here but you know what happened i spoke the word so by the time i got over here he was already dealt with you speak the word hallelujah don't worry about the rest god will take care of the rest holy the prophet of god said before is manifested in your body you have to receive it as a thought first and be honest most of us that have went to the doctor and got diagnosis we felt fine we didn't even know nothing was happening until they told us so why are you going to accept something that you knew nothing about don't get me going down this healing line we'll be here all day but now church she started asking me questions about this about that and i'm like well how can this happen your blood levels are fine and sugar over here no snacks i just don't understand it and i said something she said what did you eat last night i said sweet tea and chocolate chip cookies that's what she saw and you know what she agrees with me she says yeah that's what it is yeah it sometimes it shows up in your system like that now this is a good check listen to me carefully she agrees with me what she saw over here the nurse saw was sweet tea and chocolate chip cookies so why did they change the name of it to diabetes why didn't she call it chocolate chip and t that's all the devil does whatever's affecting you is something you've accepted in your mind to manifest in your body hallelujah and in my case it was chocolate chips and tea so my thing is why didn't you call it that why did you put another name on it to easily get you to accept it because you now you feel real stupid you say i got tea and cookies in my body am i right but that's just how simple it is and we all know that our body it produces a certain level of sugar it produces a certain level of insulin and all these things so what makes it gets to a place to make you sick your mind the way you accept it dictates how powerful it'll be as far as i'm concerned tea and cookies they never had no power over me i tell it when i'm a drink and i tell her what i'm gonna eat hallelujah and that's what i'm telling you when you go to the doctor be careful what you accept because sometimes you're accepting their picture not your picture you're not accepting god's picture hardly because god says i'm close musicians come i'm closing god says i know the thoughts i have concerning you thoughts of peace and not of evil so why are you going to accept thoughts that god is not having of you everything on this side holly in this flesh is the dark room we're in the dark room we have to be developed but once we're developed you will see the original picture that was taken let me read this and i'mma close sorry if i'm going too long he said there's nothing happens just accidentally to those who love the lord and are called according to his calling seek we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie somebody say amen if god said you're healed hallelujah by the stripes of calvary cross take it as that he cannot lie hallelujah he said he said and he said that was so that everything has its time it's season and it has its way and god is behind every move can you say amen to that church you might be in a tight spot but god is behind that tight spot oh yeah sometimes you know one of my greatest battle is finances because i live by faith and you know the devil always like to tell me you know he got this he got that you need to go out and get a job and then some kind of way god sends a blessing just to keep me encouraged and you know sometimes he uses some of you holly what is he doing he's touching your heart to touch my heart hallelujah you know and i'm gonna probably deal with this wednesday but you know what is happening we are god's attributes so in those moments holy where i am in need and god touches your heart to bless my need what are you you are operating that jehovah jarrah whoa oh yeah because we are his attributes when you lay your hands on somebody to pray and they get healed that's the attribute of jehovah raphae god is using you let me stop and god sometimes you think that everything is going wrong it's up to us those things are put upon us trials and wonderings it's testing to see how we will react on an action so god is intentional your life may be in a mess right now but what is that to god you don't think god can clear up a mess remember when he first created his creation it was without form and it was void but in the midst of all that chaos life was laying there on the earth but it took the earth to feel the presence and brewing of god for life to come forward so a lot of times our life is in a mode of chaos but all god is trying to do is get us to a place where we'll let him brood over us and then the realness of who you really are will come forward that's what it took for moses that's what it took for for job that's what it took for joshua hallelujah all joshua went through was just to get him to the king's seat fighting lying fighting jealousy fighting the dungeon fighting being forgot about all that stuff just so he can get to the throne and then what i love about it everybody that ever did him wrong god put him back in his hands can y'all imagine potiphar's wife every time she saw joseph because she knew she lied but she's in his hands now let me say it like this god will never put it back in your hands if you don't have the character holy he put his he put his his his jealous his jealous hating brothers back in his hand every last one of them back in his hand and he could have did anything with him and they would have never known who he was but he recognized it was the picture of god he recognized it was intentional [Music] i want to read one more scripture before i close genesis chapter 50. [Music] listen when it was all said and done you look at joseph's attitude towards his brothers his brothers didn't even know that they were being used by god god was using hatred he was using jealousy he was using lies he was losing the dungeon of the jailhouse god was using all that just to get his servant to a place where he could reign you really tell me god could use the lying spirit he sure can [Music] but it would all boil down to it came down to listen to jobs joseph's attitude right here in um verse 19. now he's talking to his brothers and joseph said unto them fear not for am i not for am i in the place of god see he looked at everything he went through and his brothers they were still scheming before he told them that they came to him and said hey daddy said don't kill us they were lying before he died he said don't kill us he didn't say that but they were so afraid by what they did they're still pleading for their life not even realizing that it was the hand of god all along and now church in that position joseph looks at his brothers and he tells them fear not am i not where god wants me to be [Music] church don't look at what happened before you got here look at that you're here say oh brothers i went through this journey with the message of this journey of that journey don't worry about that it took all that to get you here and now that you hear the question you have to ask yourself am i not in the place of god you know i've gone through hard trials troublesome times but church hallelujah god has begun always be showing his hand that he's with me honestly so when we when they actually ask you questions like how you doing am i not in the place of god [Music] it may look like it's tough it may look like it's rough but am i not in the place of god because if you can't say that you're saying the devil is in control and he's not in control god is in control church i got a lot of things i'm i got a lot of things i'm praying about i'm looking for god to do and sometimes it looks like i'm starting over but what i have to do if i'm starting over i have to reflect at what god has already done and if he's already done it that time he can do it again hallelujah he don't stop god never gets weary hallelujah he just wants you to believe and let me say like this if you're going down roads you've already conquered that means god is making you stronger hallelujah so just keep going through it and keep standing by the grace of god let's pray [Music] hallelujah let's bring this prayer honey lord jesus father we love you today lord we thank you for all your goodness your grace your mercy lord and prayer victor there may be someone here in this audience [Music] they've been looking at the picture of their life and they're not satisfied the lord we ask father you will just grant lord they'll be able to see through your eyes those are they'll be able to see that it's the hand of the almighty god it's the tender hand of jehovah that's taking us through these different places of life these different times and seasons all to get us into that picture in your mind lord we pray you will just continue to bless this church lord the ministry within lord that the governments of the church the different helps lord and let them operate as one mechanism with one goal and that's to see jesus christ manifest lord that hearts will be converted lives will be touched lord god that when they gather they know that it's the presence of the almighty god still remaining and showing themselves true lord we love you and we give you all the glory in jesus name we pray amen god bless you church
