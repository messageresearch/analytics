TRANSCRIPT
========================================
daniel chapter 10 i'm going to be reading in just a few places there and i just want to make reference to a few verses before we get to verse 10. but in daniel chapter 10 it tells us it's in the third year of the cyrus of cyrus the king of persia and then it mentions how he has been fasting and praying for three weeks and has a vision and then it's verse 10 it says and behold a hand touched me with which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said unto me daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am i now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy word so it's been three weeks the bible says fasting praying he says from the moment you begin this i was on my way it says verse 13 but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one in 20 days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remain there with the kings of persia and i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days and when he had spoken such words unto me i set my face toward the ground and i became dumb behold one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips then i opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that stood before me o my lord by by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and i have retained no strength for how can the servant of this lord talk with this my lord for as for me straightway they remaineth no strength in me neither is there breath left in me then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me and said o man greatly beloved fear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong and when he hath spoken unto me i was strengthened and said let my lord speak for thou has strengthened me then he then said he knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i am gone forth lo the prince of gracia shall come but i will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but michael your prince amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we're happy to be gathered together today in your presence to see one another to have a gathering place that is full and the those that have occupied the space have hearts full of expectation people lord who love your word and have not merely out of habit made their way to the sanctuary today but there's something unique that's driving them and there's a hunger that they have deep within their hearts and father as we recognize just how precious this opportunity is we ask that you would come now lord and speak to our hearts we've appreciated the worship and just the beautiful presence that we felt in that now lord come take the bread of life and divide it to us may we in in reading it and hearing it lord receive understanding so we commit the reading of your word to you and all the things that if are upon my heart and my mind lord may you just grab a hold of it take control of it for your glory that your people may be benefited we ask this in the name of lord jesus christ amen you may be seated i'm going to continue on the subject of revelation resolves complication and we wednesday night we were speaking on wisdom from above and in doing that i never actually got to the place in james that i had really been pondering on how that the wisdom that is from above is first pure and there's a way that real godly wisdom exhibits manifest itself and it expresses itself in a particular nature and a particular character and i had not been able to get to that point i still want to be looking at that phrase and this subject of wisdom from above and i want to take last sunday and even this past wednesday here at the beginning and kind of weave them together and go further in something practical about wisdom and our focus has been the fact that life is complicated and how that we need revelation through revelation it resolves these complications and revelation is wisdom from god it's a divine insight something that god grants to us and we need this revelation not to survive laodicea but to to thrive and and live life well in the bright age and so it's something that's necessary uh for our living and to live life to the fullest and to navigate the labyrinth as brother branham tells us this laodicean age is it's a labyrinth it's a maze it's very confusing and there's twists and turns and dead ends we really need the leadership of the holy spirit to guide us and that's the mark of the son of god that's the mark of a daughter of god they that are the children of god are led by the spirit of god so we're wanting to yield more to this divine leadership so that we can kind of navigate the minefield that is laodicea and we've been looking at revelations chapter three and how that the the laodicean age and society at large expresses this ideal that they're rich we're increased with goods we have need of nothing we're well a tired and we've got all the things that we need but then god says you're actually poor blind miserable naked and wretched and you're ignorant you don't you haven't perceived your lacking you haven't perceived your poverty and so the very words that we've been reading about the laodicean age confu describes this confusing deceitful age we just look to the word and know this is the time that we're living in and this uh and i want to um say it in a way to where we're not just kind of resigned to whatever is going to happen the things that happen in the world today and things that take place we shouldn't just look at it as fate and that well that just happened and or just kind of karma or coincidence maybe even better word of what i'm trying to think about that there's things that happen and it's by design there's things that take place it's because there's certain thoughts and ideals behind it and so we want to think about this confusing age that we're living in this deceitful age that we're living in and not just kind of look at it like something's just been kind of thrown out there and however it falls out is how it falls out but that there's a way that we can live in this age being aware of what's what's trying to happen on god's side and what the devil's trying to accomplish on his side and in knowing what god wants to do we can make our way through this difficult age and this evil age is a consuming age and we touched on that quite a bit last sunday how it's trying to swallow us up trying to choke out the word the word the deceitfulness of riches the cares of this life and the lust of other things entering in fight against the power of the word of god that's in that seed that all of you possess and so there's a power that's trying to steal our joy there's a power that's trying to take away from us our peace and in first peter chapter 5 verse 8 it says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a royal lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour i really want you to ponder that it's first peter i kind of dropped the the first part there but i really want you to ponder this this is a reality this is an allegory this isn't a merely an analogy or just try to explain life is hard and we always have things that come up against us peter's actually saying that the devil is a malicious and the devil is very intent to say that he says walketh about he makes due use of every opportunity what seeking whom he may devour seeking to swallow you up seeking to consume you so the age isn't an innocent age and there's forces at work and that's really kind of what forms the foundation that i'm trying to express right now there's forces at work in the age that we're living in that are set against you and and we we should believe this very literally that as the children of god and as the elect of god that there's forces that are set against us and this is our adversary he's the devil who wants to swallow us up who wants to consume us and wants to cause us to be so distracted and so taken by the things of this world that we're not yielding to the power of god which is present and we've been drawing from the end of the beginning and how in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 paul said he feared that just as the serpent beguiled eve so would our minds be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ in others we ought to have a singleness of heart towards christ we shouldn't be double-minded about the word of god we believe it we're all in and we believe the word of god we believe it to be true we believe our bible we believe this message and so we have this simplicity towards christ that we believe him we believe that he is we believe um that's what the scripture tells us about the messiah and he says i i fear that just as the serpent beguiled eve and changed her mind and changed her desire this is what satan would do to you so we're still fighting the same devil today we're in this laodicean age whatever existed then in the the church first church age has just gotten stronger it got stronger and stronger and stronger in the time we're living in now so he still has the intent to beguile us as it says in genesis chapter 3 verse 13 when the woman is asked why did you do this she said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat i was deceived into acting he deceived me he tricked me he pulled one over on me he he made me think this is what you wanted he made me think this was the right thing to do and i was deceived into acting and the bible says in first timothy chapter 2 verse 14 adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression and so when we pondered that we realized deception was at the heart of what caused the woman to sin that if there was a way out of the garden it began with deception as long as they were behind the word of god trusting to the word of god with the singleness of heart believing in the promise then they were protected against death they were protected against any kind of defilement but it says the woman being deceived that means misled by falsehood she was ensnared she was cheated the word actually refers to being cheated she was caused to believe something to be true that was actually a lie so this is satan's method of operation if the devil is at work today to try to create false appearances to try to make you believe something that's a lie or to entice you into something that looks good but is actually bad that's what satan is doing today it's what he did in the beginning it's what we're warned about in the bible it's what's happening right now it's deception that's how satan works he works in deception this is what our warfare in this last age is based upon it's based upon deception and unrighteousness is always accomplished through deception always accomplished through something that is a lie something that is a not the truth and because unrighteousness can't be accomplished through truth right so we realize that all unrighteousness is going to come through some sort of lie or some sort of perversion of the truth brother branham says sin through science and deception has twisted the whole human race sin and how has sin done it through science and deception has twisted the whole human race we take a step back and we look at how ungodly this world is and we look at what uh what drives people what makes them act what gets the preeminence and what dominates people's mind it's that way this is an evil sinful generation because of science and deception that's what's twisted and and molded the whole human race brother madam says in the message satan's eden he says here he is today he's talking about satan and his eden here he is today in deceit that treacherous hour that tremendous time that we are living in it's the most glorious time of all the ages because we're facing the great millennium again we're facing the eden but right at this age all the deceit and every tactic that he's ever used and been able to deceive with he's gathered it all together and reinforced himself everything he's ever used since the beginning he's gathered it all together say well he used this in the dark ages and he uses he used this in the gilded age and he used this back against israel and he used this against abraham and you go back through all that whatever he has used through all the ages and he's had great success in using it he has now accumulated it all together and now he's reinforcing himself in this last age with every treachery with every deceit with every lie everything he's been able to do every tactic he's now perfected and he's using it in the time that we're living in in one hand we can say well that's what explains why this world is as evil as it is because satan has perfected his tactics and satan has come to a place where he can deceive the whole world now that's one reason why it's where it is but brother brianna also tells us in the same message the reason why this evil age is how it is is so that you can god can prove that you're not like eve god's allowing it to get evil he's allowing satan six thousand years to perfect his eden so that god could defeat satan in his eden just as the devil thought he slipped into god's eden and defeated god's eden satan played right into god's hand but god wants satan to be defeated in this last days once he has achieved his perfection and and all his tactics have matured and he says they've all accumulated of everything he's used and been able to deceive with he's gathered it all together and reinforced himself that's the reality of the age we live in now i might uh through this begin to create maybe a little bit of fear or say man this is a really foreboding a sermon and this isn't very very very positive and i believe that we have a very positive message and so i'm being very positive about the deceit that's out there i'm certain of him very positive it's out there but i'm not i'm not going to take my time to express this to create any kind of fear it's good to know what's out there because there's a definitive agenda of satan today in other words satan has a definite agenda he has something that he's wanting to do and so there are spirits that are at work there are powers that are out there that oppose truth there's a here's a very specific agenda we could say that god has a very specific intent and it's pouring down his spirit what's his purpose in pouring out the spirit we realize that god wants to pour out his spirit so that it can work upon the elect to bring them to a birth and to mature them into adoption that that's the very specific purpose of the word and the move of god but there's a lot of people that benefit generally from it and we don't begrudge that we rejoice in it if if your neighbor who's a a libertarian an episcopalian and and they testified that they prayed and god healed their heart or god restored their uh they had a crippled toe or something like that we shouldn't be skeptical who is it that heals our god heals the spirit of god can be poured out and people can manifest signs and wonders and miracles and we can see certain things that take place and we don't have to doubt and be skeptical if somebody was raised from the dead we say well if somebody raised them from the dead there's only one that can do that and that's my god and so there's things that can happen in a general outpouring of the word of god and a move of the spirit but his specific intent is for his bride's positional placing and the same thing we could say about satan there's a lot of things he tries to do and there's a lot of things he's doing and there's think people to get swept up in it but let's understand that his main goal and his main purpose is to short-circuit god's agenda to keep god's bride from ascending to the throne that satan covets that satan desires to have so there's a definitive agenda behind satan's working we identified the scriptures in 2nd corinthians 4 4 that says that satan is the god of this world brother brahm uses that language to call him the god of this evil age it's how he uses the phrase satan's eden in ephesians 2 2 he's called the prince of the power of the air now i'm going to be using the bible we believe the bible to be the word of god but the bible is practical the bible is applicable to where we are living so i'm not just trying to get religious and super spiritual and just learn a little bit about what our forefathers wrote but think very practically and don't think suspiciously don't think fearfully or don't see even try to be super spiritual about it just be very practical because we don't have to be suspicious and we don't have to be super spiritual and we don't have to be fearful we just want to look at this in a very practical way satan is the god of this world he's the god of this evil age he's the prince of the power of the air this is not mythology this is not just something to try to explain why bad things happen to good people this is not just a way of trying to explain why there's evil in the world there's a very definite agenda that satan has there's an evil that's in the world there's forces at work there's spirits that are at work and so the scriptures pull back the curtain on satan's agenda the scripture is telling us that he's the god of this world that he's the prince of the power of the air even the writers are saying the whole the john said that the antichrist that spirit is already at work within this within the church they were telling us that even if you can't see this person walking around causing problems he's there even though you can't see spirits that identify themselves as evil spirits and they have name tags hi i'm an evil spirit and i'm going to cause you to doubt today i better get used to me i'm going to be hanging around you don't see that but you experience a fear you experience a doubt you experience something that begins to attack you where's that coming from there's forces and powers that are at work that are unseen and as we read in daniel chapter 10 as it says this is the third year of cyrus the king of persia it identifies that there is a literal ruler in persia he's the king of persia you find that in verse 1 and daniel is praying and fasting for 21 days and he receives this vision and all his strength is gone from him and where we picked up let's just look at verse 13. i have a couple scriptures here highlighted on the slide it says now that daniel in this third year of the reign of cyrus he's the king of persons he's the literal one in the throne one comes to daniel and touches him and he senses this presence and this is an angel that comes to him and he's explaining why he had not shown up yet he's explaining why he had not arrived yet like why you've been praying for 21 days i've been seeking you i've been fasting i've been praying i've been i've been trying to find an answer from god and it's been three weeks before anything happens and now this angel that comes to daniel is going to give him a little bit of insight as to why it took him so long to come he says in verse daniel chapter 10 verse 13 but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one in 21 days we heard you the very moment you begin to pray and i ca i was coming to your defense but as i was coming the prince of the kingdom of persia was withstood me now it's not the king of persia cyrus didn't meet the angel on the road and say whoa whoa whoa show me your papers all right this doesn't look right go to the side room we're going to have immigration talk to you for a while you have any luggage we need to have customs go through that and the angel got hung up on the border right that wasn't what happened this is in a spiritual realm the king of persia is cyrus he's the literal one that everyone would see he's the ruler on earth he's the natural leader but now an angel is wanting to come to minister to daniel and in a spiritual realm this angel says the prince of persia withstood me he's showing us that there was actually a spiritual power that stood behind the king of persia the prince of persia was one that was inspiring and anointing the king of persia he says he withstood me and michael one of the chief princes came to help me but i remained with the kings of persia he's fighting they're overcoming so there israel at the time is under the physical bondage to the persian kingdom in the natural according to the law according to even some of their geographical location so we can say in the natural they're under bondage to the king of persia and the kingdom of persia but now this verse tells us there's a spirit behind it this verse isn't just saying there's political powers and there's there's reasons why this happens and there's reasons why that happened and really when you begin to understand that there's supernatural evil powers that exist that inspire kingdoms and inspire men and that's the hidden agenda and those are the things that work that's why you can sit back and go my goodness do you notice there's the similar characteristics for thousands of years that motivate kingdoms that cause men to act and you can actually see a pattern and some people trying to make sense of that pattern think there's a cabal somewhere of men who are all related somehow by passing on of wealth and they get together and they meet with cloaks and they sacrifice babies and they're running the whole world they've been doing this for six thousand years right and and and you can see why people believe in those types of things because there is a common spirit that is inspiring and causing people to act and to behave now i'm not disavowing every secret society there may be ones and there's some i'm sure that exist and i could right now be on a list by mentioning it but we want to understand it doesn't matter what actually exists doesn't matter if there's people meeting in back rooms it doesn't matter people have dungeons and caves and secret neighborhoods and they they get together and they decide what's going to happen in the world and they accumulate their wealth and they're conspiring to subjugate people and to produce a new world order it doesn't matter what literally exists what really matters is the spirits that would be behind something like that not just evil men with evil purpose of themselves but there's forces and spirits that would be behind anyone that would want to do evil and so the bible is telling us that there's a spiritual world that's closely connected to the natural world the king of persia actually has a prince of persia behind them these are the hidden springs of nature these are the hidden springs of politics and in verse 20 this to me amplifies it all the more he says noah thou there wherefore i come unto thee and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i'm gone forth lo the prince of gracious shall come what he has just said is i'm going to leave from you and i'm going back to fighting the spiritual power these angels these demonic forces the prince of persia but after i've gone and gone forth the prince of grecia will come and what happened later what happened shortly after that alexander the great he comes and he conquers persia this is the literal power that we see alexander the great but what's inspiring the bible's already told us the angel tells daniel that the prince of grecia is going to anoint alexander the great going to anoint a natural kingdom that's going to come and fight against persia and that's exactly what happened alexander the great comes and conquers persia but with the bible tell us there's an influence and there's a power behind it this reality of influences and powers that existed in the book of daniel the reality is the same today and we may not be worried about a red dawn and a communist nation coming and going through our streets and attacking the people and tearing us down and and causing us to all become communist and or or a natural kingdom coming as alexander the great would come and and overthrow a kingdom we're not worried about those type of dynamics necessarily but we realize these same forces exist in the world today what to overthrow god's program paul says in ephesians chapter 6 verses 11 to 12 put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil the cunning arts his deceit his trickery his craft the wiles of the devil is his devious influence so put on the whole armor of god the whole armor of god is to protect us against these demonic forces and this evil he says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places this is what we wrestle against we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places paul's placed our whole warfare not with natural people not with natural things and not with natural governments and natural armies but he said our warfare even if it would be contention with somebody in the flesh we've got to recognize there's spirits behind that that are motivating the situation we thought on a large scale they're spirits that motivate nations and kingdoms and there's powers and influences that influenced hitler and mussolini and eichmann these are demonic demons that are loosed upon the world and they're causing kingdoms and nations and politics and governments to do demonic evil things and that's on a large scale but it's real it's real for us on us on our individual scale and paul's not trying to create this fear in us like well there's you got to be afraid of of a dictator in vietnam and you better be afraid of the government in a one world order and be afraid of the pope and those things listen the reality is there's people all around us that can be motivated to do wrong there's circumstances and scenarios that are brewing and things that are taking place and happening and they're right around us things that can influence us and he's trying to he's wanting to open our minds up to this deceit that exists and where we ended on wednesday morning was james chapter excuse me wednesday evening i believe it was maybe it was wednesday or maybe it was sunday but we ended at one point in james chapter 1 verse 5. i think it was last sunday if any of you lack wisdom let them ask of god if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him and the point we wanted to make with this before and i want to make it again it's wisdom for your circumstance it's not that you'd be the smartest guy in the room to know how to impress somebody it's not so that you could play the stock market it's not so that you can take advantage of something and you know as i think even brother branham was approached one time oh you know is there gold in them hills or is there oil over here that's not the kind of wisdom and discernment we need so that if somebody has buried some treasure lord show me the geolocation of where all this gold is that's not the wisdom that we really need it's a practical wisdom wisdom for your circumstance wisdom for the decision that you're facing and this is practical for living daily i want you to take this verse he says if any of you lack wisdom this is applicable if you're trying to make a decision about who you're going to marry ask god for wisdom but it's also applicable in a daily living just living daily there's things that are in the word of god we read it how should i be baptized well i don't think you need to read ask for wisdom it's very clear in this scripture how you should be baptized brother braham even writes and says it doesn't even take a revelation to know how to be baptized correctly to be baptized by immersion in the name of the lord jesus christ we accept that by faith it's written in the bible and there's a lot of things that we can read in the bible say hey this seems very clear this seems very clear then there's other things that we could look at in the word of god in the bible and in the message and be like well what what what is the right thing to do in this situation i can kind of see the this side and that side and i can see where the picture's being built but there's a lot of gray areas sometimes anybody agree with that maybe i'm the only one living in the gray sometime maybe maybe i need to find out what you guys are doing i want to eat what you're eating for breakfast because i find in my life i'm asked questions i'm presented with scenarios i'm forced with making decisions and i'm like well i know what the bible says and i know what the message says and i don't know how they deal with this this is in the crack somewhere this is this is kind of like when sometimes when i go to start a song and i end up i'm not on any particular key and brother mike is like he's trying to find me i'm in the crack you'll never be able to find me and sometimes that's where we're living not on crack but we're living in these cracks we're living in the graves we we're not sure what is going on how does this apply or how does this fit what's the right thing to do and there's a lot of situations we find ourselves in and say well the bible doesn't really speak directly to how i should handle this family situation and i'm dealing with this estrangement or i'm going to take this job and how should i handle this and you could pour through the bible you could run all the searches you want in the message you find nothing directly speaks to this but you can have certain things that seem somewhat related somewhat tangent to it and what do you need lord i need wisdom i need to know how to make what seems very great to me right now i need to bring clarity i want to find if there is a bright line if there's some wisdom that can be laid to this situation that's the point we're trying to make is ask god for wisdom the bible says in second corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 and the scenario that paul is referencing is the subject of forgiveness and he says forgive for my sake also because i don't want this person to be condemned and as you've forgiven them you are the ones that were supposed to forgive them but if you could convey to him that i forgive him as well and so think of that scenario let's just say you found out that there's a certain situation happened in a particular church and or in a family and and the family works it all out and everything's resolved and and then you have this wisdom to say you know what i want them to know i don't begrudge them i really wasn't necessarily involved or i wasn't the one i'm not the one that needed to forgive but i want to let them know that i forgive also this is wisdom paul is using wisdom in this scenario to say look i'm the one that rebuked the sin when i wrote the letter the last time and you guys have proven yourself and everything's clear but would you let him know he's good with me too because i don't want him to be overwhelmed with grief and always fear that paul hates me paul thinks i'm a sinner and so he exercised wisdom even though it might not be able to find anywhere where that would need to happen and sometimes i'll just say this especially maybe it's a problem with preachers is they're very very slow to say i'm sorry or admit they made a mistake or or say hey i forgive and there's a way that you can act in such a way to try to create this appearance you better fear me i'm a really really bad dude you better listen to me you better do what i want you to do i can make life miserable for you and paul said hey you know what let him know i forgive him i came on pretty heavy i came on really strong let him know he's clear with me and he's and he makes this statement unless satan should get an advantage of us paul did this in light of satan trying to find an advantage that means lest satan would defraud us or swindle us unless satan would take us by deceit satan would use a deliberate deception to secure an unfair advantage to use a deliberate deception to tear our brother down let him know that i forgive as you forgive lest satan could get an advantage of us and paul pulls back the curtain even more he says for we are not ignorant of his devices i'm not ignorant of his schemes i'm not ignorant of his specific aim and what he's trying to accomplish i'm not ignorant of how he'll use something for his own benefit i'm not ignorant of how he'll take somebody in their guilty conscience and take somebody in their sincerity and work them over and work them over and build a complex so i'm gonna act even though i may not be required to and even though i may not be asked to i have some wisdom about how satan works and he might even had wisdom about how this brother felt he says you know what i'm going to exercise some wisdom and i want you to extend forgiveness to him for me paul acted based upon satan's agenda and his wisdom about it paul acted based upon the very specifics of how the devil would work against this man and how paul could do something to remove a weapon that the devil could have paul did something affirmatively that would make the situation easier for that person and this is where we could make it very applicable as he's dealing with the subject of forgiveness paul is basically saying this is what's best in this situation i believe this is the right thing to do that i would forgive him also and this is how we can also ask ourselves what should i do what what should i do in this situation what's the right thing to do in this scenario and you might say well was that the right thing to do for paul you say well there wasn't a right or wrong it was the wise thing to do it was the best thing to do sometimes the things that's best doesn't mean it's more right it's just the best it's the best thing in that scenario it's the it's the best way to approach it what should i do and he says he acted because we are not ignorant of his devices to be not ignorant means we know we understand his tricks the very word says we're not ignorant we can perceive we are not mistaken so think about that he's saying that my ability to do the best thing in this situation and do what's right for this other person and even for paul's own sake is based upon knowledge and understanding of what was best the way that he should act was based upon his perception of satan's attempt to take advantage of a man and then what paul could do to ensure that that part isn't used in satan's agenda and so this wisdom that we're talking about from above it gives us perception and this perception is our protection let's look at proverbs chapter 2 verses 10 to 16. this wisdom that is from above it's for our perception and perceiving it gives us it protects our health it'll protect our wealth and i'm going to i want to use this phrase this lengthy reading here it's six verses it's not really that long but i want to use it so that you can um see one example in the scripture of how wisdom benefits us proverbs chapter 2 verses 10 to 16 when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul when this is what you rejoice in this is what thrills you wisdom enters into your heart and this knowledge is agreeable to you and you accept it discretion shall preserve thee this prudence this sensitivity this awareness this discernment is going to keep you it's going to protect you and understanding shall keep thee so discernment discretion wisdom understanding and knowledge is for your protection in light of this evil age that we're living in the god of this world the prince of the power of the air these hidden springs that are at work in the world today this evil spirit that is upon leo to see it this definitive agenda that satan has in la and in in his eden here we are in a day of deceit and all his powers of trickery have accumulated up to where they are now and he's reinforcing himself with this how am i going to make it wisdom how am i going to make the right decisions revelation how am i going to be preserved how am i going to be kept by understanding and discretion to deliver thee from the way of the evil man what does it discretion and understanding from the man that speaketh forward things who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness who rejoice to do evil and delight in the forwardness of the wicked whose ways are crooked and they're forward in their paths we could certainly make this a spiritual thing we could make it a a power of religious forces and false doctrine and being in bondage to false ideals and we could use it even in being in bondage to sin and how that we were addicted to things and and we were chasing after ungodly things and living a perverted life and we could see that there was a power that came and rescued for us from that but these same patterns exist as believers filled with the holy ghost there's still a way that we could take that displeases the lord there's still situations that we can find ourselves in that are detrimental to our spiritual health there's things that we can do that are bad for our physical health there's things that we could do that can cause problems in our families into strange particular relationships and so we want to make the right decisions maybe i could say this if your life wasn't complicated enough i'm probably going to make it even more complicated by showing you just how every day is just a maze and a web of little decisions that can make big impacts years later to think that one thing you said on facebook right would set things in motion to where now you don't even talk to your family anymore when you're written out of the will and you say well maybe it would have been nice to had some wisdom in that moment when i'm whether i'm going to let them know something right take that they blocked me what happened can you do that on facebook i don't know i don't have facebook full disclosure and just there's a moment of a decision i'm going to give them a piece of my mind i'm gonna give them a talking to i'm gonna i'm gonna do something and it has an impact and so there's a greater application there's an application i don't want to say greater there's an application of this when it comes to your salvation when it comes to deliverance from very major things but on a daily basis there's a way of a wicked there's a way that's not upright there's a way that displeases there's a way that's not expedient there's a way that's not conducive to what god's trying to accomplish in your life god's wanting to bring you to this place and you could take the long way or you could take his way you take the way that he wants you to go there's a way that we could there's a way that we could pass to get to where god wants us to be but if we don't take his way we won't be the person we should be when we get there because if god's wanting to bring you to a particular place he wants to produce a character in you that can be fruitful in that place that can be productive in that place and if you take a shortcut and you get there like well i'm where he wanted me to be i think he said well it's going to be harder than it should have been because you lack the character you lack the wisdom you lack the experience to be fruitful and to be productive immediately in that place this could relate to even marriage you may get the one that you believe said god wants you to marry and you may be with the one that you think is the right one but if you don't go about it god's way you can be where you're supposed to be but you can make it a lot harder than it's supposed to be you can make things more difficult you could complicate seasons and callings and relationships and you say well why didn't i think of this sooner and why did i do this then and i should have done this years ago listen if you would have done it years ago it might not have ever worked out the way it's working out now because god has a way god has a plan and so we need wisdom we need understanding we need revelation because if you're acting on that then you have no regrets well i know i made the right decision then and even though i'm coming back later now and doing something different this must be god's timing now because i feel the same leadership now as i did then and there's no regrets in that because it's wisdom that preserves you it's understanding that keeps things then it says in verse 16 to deliver thee from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattereth with her words and the book of proverbs is over and over and over again talks about the foolish and the unwise and the center and all these enticements and how this will try to get you and that will try to get you and this person will be calling you this strange woman said hey come over here enjoy this and these strange men even the bible is talking about how you know if sinners entice they consent they not they're gonna say hey come on let's go do this and hey join up with me in this hey put your money into this and hey do this and hey do that and let's all get together and this it talks about all these schemes and all these conspiracies and all these endeavors and all these acts of the world and what's the answer every single time wisdom wisdom is crying wisdom is saying wisdom is teaching wisdom is is caution in you in wisdom will deliver thee wisdom will keep thee wisdom will preserve thee the bible says in hosea chapter 4 verse 6 my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge that's a heavy statement my people perish my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge the word knowledge there means perception discernment wisdom and understanding even translated differently in the old testament to these other words because of the lack of discernment because of the lack of wisdom because the lack of understanding of things my people are destroyed now this is a knowledge not in the sense of knowing facts or information but it's the understanding of them my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge it wasn't a lack of data it wasn't a lack of information they had all the information at their disposal they had the things that god had told them they had their experience that taught them certain things they had the oral tradition they had the written law they had all the data they had all the information but what destroyed them a lack of understanding a lack of perception a lack of discernment there's times you could say well i know this is a snake and i know what snakes do but the story of the man who picked up the snake that was frozen on the side of the road and put it in his pocket and then the snake warmed up and then it bit the man he's like hey why did you bite me the snake was like you knew i was a snake when you put me in your pocket why should this come as any surprise so you can have all the information you can have all the data you can have all the knowledge but you lack the wisdom and the discernment and the moment say hey once this thing wakes up may not work out very well in your pocket and wisdom is what can teach you that there's a way that we all learn by experience and so that man that day that took that frozen snake and put him in his pocket learned i don't want to do this again and that's how you learn by experience you can have understanding by experience but you know what would be better is if we took the cue from this guy's misdeed and said you know what it's probably wise to not do that and so we can learn from somebody else's mistake we could learn because the guy says hey tell this to generations to come if you know it's a snake don't be surprised if it bites you and then you exercise wisdom and go you know what i've been taught that situations like this don't end well i've been taught not to do this do this and so wisdom is even a better teacher because there's an idea sometimes that well if you have an experience that you don't really know and you can only learn by experience and just because you may be a learner in the classroom by something being tactile or something being visually presented or learning something audibly and there may be different ways that we learn the best way for us to learn is have the wisdom from above because we have that dynamic as being born again from above we have this sense that transcends all other senses and i don't have to put my hand on the of the stove it's ow that burns i'm never going to do that again something can tell me that's hot don't touch it and that's wisdom we can both end up the same way hey i know not to touch that how do you know see these scars and you say thank god i know by wisdom not to do this because people are destroyed for lack of knowledge so it wasn't a lack of knowing the facts or information but they didn't have the analysis to make it beneficial they didn't have the ability to derive value to act on it they lacked the analytics if we want to use that example as we referenced before having a lot of data and a lot of information having the entire message available for us to search hasn't resolved every doctrinal problem has it having all the bible in our language in searchable databases isn't it wonderful that i didn't come to the pulpit today with a bunch of red volumes and you count to know how long the sermon was going to be my goodness he's got 9 10 and 11. you know i mean this guy's gonna be quoting all day long but we can search the bible we can know everything that the bible says about this word we can know everything brother bradham said about splits or or scandal skirts we can look up everything he says about the token everything he says about this and it says about that and at the end of the day if we have all the data and all the information but we don't have the wisdom of god to understand it it's even to our greater detriment to have it all so what do we want to ask god for we want to ask god for revelation not the stack of quotes i've literally had ministers tell me that their quote stack is higher than mine so theirs prevails that literally would say well there's just more more statements in this regard they didn't want to they didn't want to ask god to say lord take this stack and dovetail it with this stack and let's see where we get to one stack just big bank take little bank let's just see if there's a way that god could dovetail these two where there's not two sides there's one truth right and that's what you should ask for is the wisdom of god to navigate a situation like that to look at this stack of quotes and this stack of quotes and these things and those things say lord i need wisdom i need revelation i need understanding to get value out of it to get faith out of it the bible says in proverbs 22 3 a prudent man foreseeth evil prudent means sensible he's sharp he has powers of judgment the prudent man it means he has powers of discernment he has powers of judgment he's astute he's shrewd a prudent man foresees the evil and hides himself this is what a man of wisdom does he prepares himself for any evil and he embraces himself to welcome any good he makes preparation wisdom causes a man to do that spiritual judgment sharp powers of discernment causes him to foresee the evil and hides himself but it says but the simple pass on and are punished this is where revelation produces positive action when you have an understanding about something when you see something's coming when you see something's about to take place if you know it's good if the waters are being stirred you would jump into the pool if you had the sense and this knowledge that this was what god was doing then you would want to avail yourself to this blessing this benefit that god wants to provide i want to by having wisdom and this sharp power of discernment make myself available to receive the blessing from god but then when you see the devil coming with the curse no no don't want to sign for that wouldn't it be wonderful to know when we're getting a box of rattlesnakes i mean the story just seems so easy right if somebody hands you a box of rattlesnakes and you know it's rattlesnakes what would we do uh this is the box of rattlesnakes isn't it yeah it isn't well then i'm not signing for it well why would you do that i know a guy one time who put a snake in his pocket and it bit him so i'm not signing for this box of rattlesnakes but the problem is is rarely is it packaged and it says rattlesnakes inside it says this will simplify your life you will never feel better 30 day back guarantee full warranty you know what's the point what's the risk let's just give it a try there's it's not always declared rattlesnakes what would you want to have discretion sharp powers of discernment to know yeah i don't know about this i'm a little uncertain what did brother branham teach us if there's a question about it leave it alone it says the simple pass on and are punished the simple there we get went into great detail on a wednesday night the simple are the impressionable they're they're they're naive so this is the wrong side of simple we don't say well i want to be simple i want to be simple to where you just believe everything but we we we want to he's talking about this simple or easily influenced really a way of put that when you look at all the different scriptures you could use they're not discerning the simple pass on and they're punished what they're so simple-minded that they can't perceive danger oh that's nothing oh i wouldn't worry about that why does that matter and they just continue on and they are punished and the simple in the bible the word that's used in the hebrew speaks of one who is open-minded they're open-minded well i'm open to that they're enticeable by experience do you want to try this yeah sure i'll try it does that make sense to you i want this part to to really hit home because i want to take i want to pivot here and go a different direction i go further in something the simple cannot discern what's right or wrong they just get lucky when it works out because really they're just enticed by the opportunity they're just enticed by experience they're kind of being enticed by oh this looks great i'm open-minded and they preach you this open-mindedness and being willing to experience and what do you have to lose and i pondered this because i see i see this influence it's an influence i'll admit you know personally that there's a lot of things in the world today and there's intimidation and bullying and threatening and you'll sense it even in the message where if you believe something and you have conviction there's this culture of bullying where people want to bully you out of believing what your conviction and standing by what you believe and even preaching what you believe the truth and what brother branham taught and there's a culture of bullying to cause that person to be silent and there's forces at work in the world where everyone's afraid of becoming the next negative viral phenomenon where i got videoed at this store and this happened and that happened or this sermon goes viral these statements are made and there's a this social justice phenomenon and there's a woke culture if i can maybe use that phrase where you need to be woke and you need to be re realizing this is bad and that's wrong and we need to do this when you do that but this whole idea of a walk culture there's they push an idea that of open-mindedness that sometimes is even more toxic than the bias they're trying to identify they're saying well i'm woke and i'm open-minded and they realize they're actually perpetuating the very things that they claim to be standing against because what being woke isn't the solution in this day and age if there's prejudice if there's bias is there injustice injustice if there's inequality you're not going to accomplish it by quote-unquote being woke or becoming a social justice warrior or using the right kind of avatar on social media none of that's really ultimately going to make a difference what's going to make a difference is wisdom from above a genuine holy spirit-led sensitivity and understanding about the situation about the circumstance and so this oh the simple it describes the world we're living in now there's just no real conviction there's no real a solid feeling everything's just so loose and uh free-for-all and without borders and without positions and so we want to be caution ourselves against this pressure to be more open-minded because the real solution to a closed mind is the mind of god it's the wisdom of god that gives us the knowledge the understanding the discernment that we need i'm going to go through a few scriptures very quickly proverbs said simple understand wisdom fools be of an understanding heart be open to truth be open to correctness don't be susceptible to negative influences don't just be open to everything because wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding what wisdom wisdom from above divine wisdom not a wisdom that is just a natural i know how to change my oil in my car i know how to do this or i know how to do that i it's not a wisdom that knows how to resolve uh tricks and puzzles and i'm really good at puzzles and this is the wisdom this is the theory i've developed my own theory on how to solve a puzzle i have a way of doing it if you do a puzzle with me and you have a different way of doing it you'll find that i have a very particular way of solving a puzzle and you got to do this first and then you got to do this next and then you do this you do that and you're sitting around going when are we ever going to start putting this thing together no you got to do the first five steps first if you don't do the first five steps you're just asking for trouble later on it's kind of like is it the idea behind a puzzle just to be together and have fun well yeah but this is the fun way to do it we're not talking about that kind of way where you just have a little wise in certain things you have a little bit of knowledge and certain things but we're actually talking about if there is any human knowledge it's subject to the power of spiritual discernment if any gift any ability any way that you can do something it's human knowledge and human skill that's subject to spiritual discernment just because you're able to go build a house and do it cheaply and do it really well doesn't mean you should always build houses for people right just because you're really good at changing your own oil you may not want to go and open an oil change company listen just because you can smoke really good meats brother chris wherever you are just because you're really good on the grill and the flat top and you've got a nice pellet smoker doesn't mean you run out and start a restaurant you want to know how to make a small fortune start with a large fortune and open a restaurant so wisdom tells you hey just because i can do it doesn't mean i should when does that happen when you have spiritual discernment well i did this and it worked out great and i did that and i did that it may work for the world but you you're under different rules you're under different requirements you have a different goal your goal isn't just to retire sitting fat and having your 401k full and being able to live so many years that's not your goal your goal is to get out of here and the more we're consumed with whether or not we can retire the less chance we have of getting out of here before i retire so we need wisdom that is from above it's the principal thing i want to be very quick in this very quickly refer again to solomon solomon realized i'm a child i don't know how to go out or to come in i'm i'm just a child and so god said ask whatever you want and solomon knew enough to say i'm a kid trying to run a family i'm a kid trying to run a government i'm a kid trying to keep a people together they're the greatest people on earth so he said i want an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad that's what i want an understanding of heart to judge the people that i may discern between good and bad and god said that solomon asked for understanding to discern judgment understanding to know what to do understanding to know what was right in a particular situation understanding to know what was best in a particular situation and the bible says that god gave him a wise and understanding heart to faithfully govern the people he had a wise and understanding heart where he had the powers of discernment he had the power of wisdom he had the ability to look at a situation and know the right thing to do in order to govern a great people when the bible says if you lack wisdom then number one we have to recognize we lack wisdom and in itself that may be enough wisdom to start with to be able to perceive hey i don't have the goods i don't have what it takes i don't have the knowledge the skill or understanding to really live my life well to be able to be a good husband to be a good christian whatever your scenario may be that's the first place to start is to recognize in revelations 3 18 that i need in 3 19 that i need something from god i need something from god to open my eyes i know that i lack i need to have an understanding and to call upon god for revelation more than anything and start from the standpoint that i have enough wisdom knowledge and understanding discernment to know that i lack so in my lacking i'm going to ask god for wisdom and you can do exactly what solomon did just on a smaller scale whatever you're running if you're just running your own little bedroom in your car and your own little business or whatever world you're living in you can ask god for wisdom and receive it in the same measure that it was effective for solomon you could receive it for your own life and when we read in verses 16 to 27 in first kings three immediately after god says he gave him understanding to discern judgment give them the understanding of a man that could judge the people to discern between good and bad the very first story that brings out the wisdom of solomon and begins to make a name for him is two harlots come and stand before him both of them claiming one baby one says her baby died in the night no one says no her baby died in the night the one says this is my baby that says no it's my baby and solomon used the wisdom that was from above and he said bring me a sword and immediately thinking a sword and that was his response his response to bring me a sword it was his wisdom in judgment it was he wasn't a child anymore he had the ability even in that moment to say well i don't know who's telling the truth and who's not because sometimes that's what we think discernment is is reading people's minds how many times are we warned over and over and over again in the message i'm not reading your mind so discernment isn't trying to figure out hmm what is he thinking but wisdom is being able to deal with the situation where you know there is deception and i'm not quite sure if he's telling me the truth or not i mean there's riddles that you're confronted with well if you ask the question you know this one's going to lie and then this one you know is going to tell you the truth but you can only ask the one then how do you get your way out of it you ask the one what would this other guy say right and if he tells the truth then you know whatever this guy's going to say is going to be the lie so you just do the opposite yeah see wisdom i just came up with that no it's a riddle it's a well-known riddle how you get out of a situation like you have to use wisdom because you don't necessarily know so you got to come up with the way to find the rat in the wood pile so to speak you got to come up with a way to figure out what's the right way there's deception there's false pretense and there's all sorts of mirages and things on the horizon i don't know how to read this i don't know how to read the signs i know what to do give me wisdom and solomon had the kind of wisdom to provoke something and he's not just reading minds he was given the ability to use wisdom in a particular situation to find out right or wrong i want to call it practical discernment we're not going to be able to read one another's minds but we can have a discernment that is practical every day a practical discernment i'm gonna i'm gonna wrap it up short this morning so just trying to find where i want to take this from solomon said bring me a sword what did he say i want to take this child and divide it in half and you both will have half and it provoked the love of a mother to say no preserve the child and the one who was lying was indifferent and that's just a scenario when solomon made a decision he asked a question that brought out the real truth and the real intent we can ask god for that kind of practical discernment we can ask god for that kind of wisdom where he's not a child anymore and we could take the faith that we have and nourish it by the revelation of the word and in nourishing a revelation of the word we can increase our wisdom and our discernment this is why we're taught we need to call upon god for revelation more than anything we need to ask god for wisdom to discern what is right in philippians chapter 1 verses 9 and 10 it says in this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment to have a greater depth of knowledge and a more comprehensive discernment this is what he's saying he wants them to do are they saved yes or they feel the holy ghost yes so i pray that your love would abound more and more and as your love abounds you have more knowledge and more comprehensive discernment why that you may approve that word is discern that you may discern things that are excellent and that you be sincere and without offense since it means you're judged right you're judged correctly when you're examined when you're when you're looked at when you're proven you can be found that you made the right decision you've done what was right so our discernment grows as our love for the word grows our discernment grows as our faith grows as our understanding grows this is something as we get into the word of god as we pray and read our bibles as we listen to the word of god as we feed on the things that are taught and the things that are preached then our love for truth is increasing it's being nourished our faith is growing and with the faith that is growing we receive a greater ability to discern that your faith may abound yet more and more jesus said and ye shall know the truth john chapter 8 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free that no doesn't mean head knowledge you shall perceive the truth you shall understand the truth and that's when truth makes you free when you know truth up here there's no liberty but when you perceive it when it's trying to be hid when you recognize it when it was covered up by some lie when you're trying to be steered away from it and you perceive it you understand you catch it whenever you have a revelation of the word it's revelation that makes you free i want to i'm going to want to come to a a a stopping point and so to discern means to perceive to have a discernment it's a keenness of judgment to make the right decision about something to have discernment is to to recognize differences if you discern you can recognize or detect you can distinguish or perceive when two things are different you ever had one of those pictures that say find 10 things wrong in this picture or he said compare this picture to the other picture says what's different about this picture another picture well if you're using your five-year-old us usborne book we can figure that out as adults pretty quickly well you couldn't get that you know how old are you oh five i mean you really couldn't get that because it's easy to us but there's there's riddles that are more appropriate for the adults it says spot five differences between these two pictures what are you gonna use a keen eye to identify things that are very very subtle well that's the same way that spiritual discernment is its ability to distinguish differences once something is presenting itself one way but you can discern that it's not actually the way that it's presented the ability to recognize well this is not that and this is different than that that's what discernment means this is such a wonderful gift to have and if i could put it in these terms the gift of discernment was very pronounced and on display in brother brown's ministry could you say amen to that it was it was a sign that got our attention it was a sign that the son of man was going to be revealed it wasn't the revealing of the son of man but it was god identified himself in flesh showing that the time of the revealing of the son of man was coming and was at hand and he exhibited this sign throughout his ministry we see it in the 50s and early 60s and it was pointing to that time when the son of man would be revealed to the open of those seals and it was such a pronounced gift of discernment that that in itself should be some signification to us that if the sign that preceded the reveal of the son of man was discernment then the impact of the reveal of the son of man should be the bride's discernment if discernment got my attention then discernment is going to be my going to be part of my experience and brother ben could stand before an audience and give someone's name and their address and what was wrong with them he could even give nicknames and he could give this and he could give that and he wasn't reading their mind and what would he say who told me that how would i know that i'm not reading your mind i'm not reading the prayer card that was wisdom from above it was discernment that god was giving him and if god could give brother branham discernment from above to know someone's name to know someone's sinful condition to know someone's past and know their near future then god today can give you discernment for whatever situation you're facing it just doesn't need to be a public show doesn't need to be on a platform you don't need the vindication god needs the glory you need the benefit practical discernment so discernment means to recognize or perceive differences and i was i was wanting to take some time to go through how that discernment to discern between good and evil is what solomon asked for an understanding heart to discern between good and bad that's the mark of a mature believer to have that kind of discernment not talking about reading minds will talk about wisdom from above and it's a way that our experience grows and our understanding grows to give us a more comprehensive discernment brother and says we need discernment we need the discerning by the word the words right take the word god's word's always right we can't discern by what people think what intellectuals tell us what psychiatrists tell us we gotta go by what god says we need it we don't need another man behind a pulpit calling a prayer line calling out people's names and sins and and a minister standing up before the people and discerning things that go on those gifts are still in the church and god still uses them i've witnessed them but they're not used publicly to draw people's attention to that person because we received a message we've received if we want to call it our eighth messenger it was christ we're not looking for another one not looking for another prophet we're not looking for another explanation but there's still a gift of discernment that can work in your life god says that we need it but the brain says we need discernment we need the discerning by the word not what we think not what intellectuals tell us what psychiatrist tells we got to go by what god says so what's the answer to laodicea behold i stand at the door and knock that's what it comes down to that's what the conclusion behold i stand at the door knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me he is our only hope discernment by the revelation of the son of man oh it's sodom it's gamora what's the answer have christ be revealed to you have christ continually be revealed to you the revelation of the son of man is our weapon to overcome the laodicean age christ is our only hope what is christ the word who judgeth all things by which all things are going to be judged i want the mind of christ to know i want the spirit and nature of christ to understand i want sensitivity and understanding of the spirit to know the decisions to say the right things to do and i want to i want to have that i want to ask god for it the bible says above all in ephesians chapter 6 verses 16 to 17 above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked so faith defends faith protects whatever whatever satan's trying to do whatever trick whatever game he's playing faith can protect you from it it says to take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god so you're to take the sword of the spirit the word of god is what sharper than any two-edged sword it's quick and powerful what does it do it discerns so the spirit of god the word of god is a discerner and we're asked to take the word as our sword why would we not think that it can discern why would we not think that faith is just merely believing in something and not empowering you by discernment to make decisions to do things to to say the right thing to think the right thing the sword of the word sword of the spirit which is the word of god it's our only offensive weapon when you read the ephesians 6. everything else you put on is to protect you helmet of salvation the breastplate the feet are shod all these different things he's only given you one weapon there's only one thing then your arsenal that's a weapon it's the word of god the word which is sharper and more powerful than any two-edged sword a word which is a discerner so your faith will protect you and faith then which takes a hold of this sword of the word of god is what you can use as an offensive weapon to make decisions to make your way into progress that's why we could say just like solomon give me a sword give me the sword that's where we're ending ending wednesday night we've amplified it a lot more this morning but we're going to end it with this thought of taking this weapon by the word of god and exercising it brevard says quickening power gives discernment and it is the rising of the sun quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do what you have done and what you ought not to have done what you should have done and what you will be quickening power now we can say that this is applicable to how god would use the ministry of a prophet to stand before someone and quickening power could give them not give him knowledge to know what's wrong with the person and what they should do to tell them what they should have done what they should not have done and what they should be doing and what they will be quickening power could work that way on brother branham for someone else's benefit but quickening power gives you discernment and quickening power won't say a but to it that it would be competing and quickening power can give you discernment to know what's wrong with you it can give you discernment to know what you should have done it can give you discernment to know what you should do what does that quickening power quicken power that you have received it can empower you and give you discernment to do the right thing i know that i'm hammering it over and over again for now for an hour and ten minutes just been saying the same thing over and over again but i want you to get it you can ask god for wisdom for daily tasks you can ask god for wisdom for daily decisions you can ask god to give me wisdom to raise my kids and to make sure i'm raising them in the fear of the lord and the admonition of god and then i'm trying to raise them up in the way that they should go and i'm doing it with a heart full of love and not just a fistful of of spankings and lord give me wisdom give me wisdom but at some point you're going to be in a situation where you need to know what to do at that moment and the wisdom is not just out there in the ether somewhere but god too in that very moment can quicken your heart to say this is what i need to do this is what i need to do this is how i need to handle this situation sometimes you're just too quick to react knee-jerk just hit just yell to correct hitting and yelling did i step on everyone's toe i mean where's the single guy without any kids when you need him right yeah amen to that and that's what we do you know we correct yelling by yelling we correct hitting by spontaneously hitting and it literally is you see your son go you're standing behind your son she go and the site just repeats itself because he's like well i thought i had every right to hit him in the head and your son's thinking and my dad thought he had every right to hit me in the head so there's some logic to what i did he just didn't like it there's wisdom from above that can help us navigate those things i wasn't intending to get so literal and so practical but there is a wisdom that we can have in a moment in an instance and that's what we're asking god for quick and empowered to discern i wanted to share this wednesday night and some of you might maybe you'll ask me later on if you wanted us to rehear wednesday why don't you just play the tape well i'm not about playing my tapes how's that but we're making decisions i made a statement i think at the end of service we're making decisions in a world that was built by deception and driven by lust that's what we're living in right now we're living in a world that deceives us it's a world we're making decisions every day in a deceiving world and a world that says do this you'll like it and a world that says one plus one equals five and we need the kind of wisdom and discernment to know no that's not the case not that we'd be good at math i used this example one time so i don't think it'll ever work again i think i used it twice and the word is out but how many legs does a horse have four but if i told you the tail was actually a leg how many would would it have no no it wouldn't be five a horse has four legs no matter what i tell you about the tail if i say the tail is a fifth leg a horse still only has four legs and that's the kind of wisdom we need that's the kind of discernment we need to realize wait a minute this is a trick this is a trap no it doesn't matter what you you change the rules we're no longer operating by the same rules people will blow us over a bunch of stuff bunch of stuff but it's all these assumptions and they go and that's why it's this and if we're real quick just to assume that everything they said was true it'd be really easy to buy the lie but you have wisdom to step back and say wait a minute you made a few this is all based on upon a lot of assumptions well how do you know this is true how do you know that is true there's a lot of times we've believed a lie because we assumed the backstory and we need wisdom to begin to challenge assumptions be wisdom to begin to challenge certain things to know that this is not what i need for myself for my family so we need an instinct i'm calling that instinct wisdom from above i'm wanting to very particularly refer it to discernment a discernment that can withstand pressure discernment that can overcome obstacles we've heard stories of brother banham talking about how when he was in india and he noticed animals that had all been along alongside a wall move away from the wall and birds begin to fly and it's kind of what's going on what's happening and this phenomena take place i mentioned it because brother brown makes reference to it in the message and it got me pondering this some years ago and brother brown says sure enough there's an earthquake that came and that wall fell and we attribute some kind of knowledge in witnessing that that is there something that the animals know did god tell them hey there's an earthquake coming what is it that they went what were the dynamics at work so this was um a program a public broadcasting station a study that they put out a transcript or something that i'd read but it was published by pbs plenty of studies have shown that some animals can sense major changes in weather worms for instance are known to flea rising groundwater birds are known to be sensitive to air pressure changes and often hunkered down before a big storm so sensing major changes sensitive to pressure changes in florida researchers studying tagged sharks say they flee to deeper waters just before a big hurricane arrives they also may be sensing the air and water pressure changes so there's a they can sense major change sensitive to air changes sensing air and water pressure changes caused by the big storm it says science scientists are skeptical that any special sixth sense helped so the science is skeptical about the fact that they have a sixth sense then the united states geological society published this report we can easily explain the cause of unusual animal behavior seconds before humans feel an earthquake we're trying to figure this out right how do animals do this very few humans notice the smaller p wave that travels the fastest from the earthquake source and arrives before the larger s wave but many animals with more keen senses are able to fill the p wave seconds before the s wave arrives so animals have a different intuition and sense they can sense something before humans senses what they're saying if in fact there are precursors to a significant earthquake that we have yet to learn about such as ground tilting groundwater changes electrical or magnetic field variations indeed it's possible that some animals could sense these signals and connect their perception with an impending earthquake could you just ponder this for a little bit science is skeptical about whether or not there's some sixth sense that animals have but they realize they can obviously see that animals have some perception greater than our own and respond to a catastrophe or a major earthquake or major storm well before humans do a tagged shark will go to deeper waters before a hurricane birds will sense air pressure changes they have a discernment they have a perception of changing circumstance situations and they're able to flee and science is like well you know we think it's because of this we think it's because of that but maybe there's something else we don't know about these animals there's other ways that these major things take place and transpire that they can sense it before we sense it they can measure it before we measure it and maybe that's what gives them the ability to do it and they're saying in other words they're not going to say it's supernatural it's innate within them now that's fair enough for me if they want to disavow that it's supernatural because these are natural birds and natural sharks and natural uh animals but who gave that nature to them god gave animal life an instinct mother nature if you want to call it that is a divine attribute built within the creation to know the sap and the tree what does it do it guns down runs down into the ground into the root system to preserve it and protect life during a certain time of year this is a cycle it's in life it's a nature built within the creation itself to what preserve itself it's a wisdom of creation a wisdom of nature and scientists saying hey animals have this perception this ability to discern certain things before something happens and they can preserve themselves and brother brahm says surely if god gives a fish and a bird discernment how much more should he give his children praise the lord for that if god could give a bird discernment if god could give a fish to servant he's saying how much more can god give his children discernment to get away from this to flee to that to make these kinds of decisions god given anal life discernment to protect them and preserve them can give you the same god can give his children discernment the musicians would come or maybe we're just with brother micah today i'm certainly fine with that brother mike if you could come discernment empowers us to daily overcome to do it on a daily basis all the challenges we face on every level the bible says that wisdom is justified over children our faith our wisdom is going to be expressed through the decisions we make our faith is an even expression of our godly wisdom and knowledge and righteous decision-making and i believe that this is what we ought to believe for ourselves that my faith will produce a knowledge that can pierce a veil my faith can bring a knowledge that can uncover schemes and find what is right i want to encourage you to pray for discernment that if you ask god for revelation then it's a revelation that gives wisdom and understanding wisdom is the principle thing and with all thy getting get understanding pray for spiritual sensitivity discernment is not always this sword that's going to hurt that's going to cut and divide and it's righteous indignation against all things evil but a spiritual sensitivity to understand why things are the way they are a spiritual sensitivity to understand where a person is coming from you may vehemently disagree with their conviction you may despise the decision they make but if you lack empathy if you do lack even lack even sympathy if you lack sensitivity to what the person is going through if you lack understanding of what got them in that place to begin with you'll never be able to help him out of it you'll never be able to present the truth in love discernment is what makes the power of satan's he just his power of sensibility and what what he says is right his ability to deceive discernment is what destroys that discernment is what defeats it and i've been pondering this thought now for many many hours beginning yesterday morning if we are saved by grace through faith and and through the work of salvation we overcome sin by believing the truth that's the greatest deception there is right the power that sin holds over us if god has by grace revealed to us the forgiveness forgiveness of our sins and we've overcome a lie that we believe the truth and believe in the truth we're sanctified and we've come into new life we say the greatest accomplishment in my life is sin is defeated i've been quickened by a new birth i'm a son or daughter of god i've been baptized into christ if that dynamic if that was the greatest if saved being saved and overcoming sin by a revelation of truth by revelation of my salvation if that's the greatest then how much more powerful should the revelation of truth be for over everything else i know i'm not expressing myself the right way i i know just maybe just it's through my own i know it's through my own weakness and the things that i've struggled with uh just maybe physically being in pain i know i'm failing to make this point and so i ask god to help me if god by revelation delivered you from sin and that power has rescued you from the threat of hell and put you in god's grace to never have to worry about judgment that you have been placed already seated in the heavenly places in christ jesus if that kind of revelation delivered you from the worst kind of death there is and from the greatest power there is then how much more power is there when i say more power i'm talking about how much more powerful is it over everything else in life to have the kind of conviction that well if it delivered me from the death of sin then certainly i could be delivered from this if the revelation of truth rescued me from the bondage of false doctrine and broke the powers of demonic spirits and delivered me from addictions and set my life on this path then it's got to be more powerful than what should we do in this situation because i don't know this is the this is how practical your experience with christ can become when you realize that he's given you the revelation of the son of man when he's asked you to call upon him for revelation more than anything it's not oh god help me to see the seven thunders in the book of ezekiel oh lord let me be able to figure out how the jews if they had seals and if they had church ages and lord please let me be able to chart just the bright age perfectly and let me do no no no ask god for the revelation you really need for the moment that you're living in listen if it's a revelation of how to chart the bright age that's going to get us out of here let's all start calling upon god for it but we need revelation more than anything of who christ revelation of him it's practical it's practical if we could just stand to our feet this morning let's bow our heads in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father through any strain or difficulty lord today in my delivery or cadence emphasis lord it could even be a failure for myself to get completely out of the way i still believe that you can communicate to your people through your word i still believe and know that you have because lord i can sense that you're dealing with hearts i could sense that there's real things that are being dealt with within people's lives and lord my prayer today is small give me wisdom give me practical wisdom lord i it's as fun as it might be and even as powerful as it could be to be able to read people's thoughts if i don't have the wisdom to be able to handle what people are thinking it's going to destroy me lord i don't want to know people's thoughts i don't want to know everything that's being said and i don't want to know any more than what you want me to know lord but what i do want is wisdom with what i do know art i want a discernment and a perception about what i'm being confronted with in the situations i'm facing and household management and finances and treating health problems and what things should i allow my children to do and what places should they be allowed to go and all these things lord i need wisdom lord i don't want to make the mistake of just doing a cursory search of something and like well i didn't come up with anything so i guess it doesn't really matter lord i wouldn't want to take my own opinion on it i need wisdom that's what i'm praying for today is wisdom that's what i ask for the people who stand today that you'd give them wisdom thank you for being with us today lord and thank you for your presence we love you we're so needy lord we're so dependent upon you so help us father help us to find our rest in you bless your people we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
