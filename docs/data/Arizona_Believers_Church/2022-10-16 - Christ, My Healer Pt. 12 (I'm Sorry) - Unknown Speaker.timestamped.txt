[0:00] The subject has been Christ my healer.
[0:02] This is part 12 on the subject of Christ
[0:04] my healer. My title today is I'm sorry.
[0:08] And you can write it down. It's a short
[0:10] one. My title is I'm sorry. And we'll
[0:13] get into the meat of this after a little
[0:15] bit. Just kind of lead up come back to
[0:17] some of the things we touched on last
[0:19] time and then take a step further in
[0:21] this subject uh on Christ my healer. And
[0:24] I mentioned last time, if you're waiting
[0:25] for me to get into the subject and how
[0:27] to receive healing and how God heals,
[0:29] we're in it now. We're really focusing
[0:31] on things that uh are hindrances to to
[0:33] healing and things that keep us from
[0:35] being healed. And that was what was
[0:36] expressed in the two services on the few
[0:39] services on the chronic conditions of
[0:40] the heart and vision correction is we
[0:43] were looking at our approach to Christ
[0:46] in approaching Christ for a need
[0:48] specifically for divine healing. And so
[0:50] there's a way that you ought to approach
[0:52] him. And then in looking at maybe even
[0:54] just referencing that there's a way to
[0:56] approach it was easy that to be then
[0:58] begin to identify the things that would
[1:01] hinder our approach to Christ or hinder
[1:04] us in receiving the promise that he has
[1:06] for us. And in these two particular
[1:08] subjects, I could say that uh what my
[1:11] emphasis was is kind of our thought
[1:14] process. How often we focus divine
[1:16] healing, the the very phenomena and the
[1:18] miracle divine healing on physical
[1:20] sickness or physical disease, things
[1:22] that we could see in the flesh, whether
[1:23] it be cancer, a diabetes diagnosis, and
[1:26] certain things that relate to the body.
[1:29] And we focus so much on that aspect of
[1:31] divine healing that we do it to the
[1:33] detriment of our hearts. We do it to the
[1:35] def detriment of our our thinking and
[1:37] our spirits. And we've emphasized this
[1:40] through these couple services that the
[1:43] condition of the heart or even our
[1:45] mental perception, the way we view
[1:46] things, our attitude towards it cannot
[1:49] be overlooked when it comes to our
[1:51] sicknesses and when it comes to our
[1:53] healing of those sicknesses. So if you
[1:55] have a physical problem, you may say,
[1:56] "Lord, I need to be healed of this
[1:58] physical problem." And that's true and
[2:00] that's very, very clear. But we can be
[2:02] so f focused on the physical part that
[2:04] we haven't given consideration to the
[2:06] spiritual components to the sickness and
[2:09] then also to our healing. And I think
[2:11] that part of the the spiritual component
[2:13] of sickness is not foreign to us as
[2:15] believers because we've often seen
[2:17] situations where someone was suffering
[2:19] from something physical, whether it be a
[2:21] stomach trouble or digestive issues or
[2:24] uh uh or some sort of manifestation in
[2:26] some way and it's tied back to some
[2:28] wound in the spirit or something that's
[2:30] caused them to be nervous and afraid.
[2:33] And so when we're talking about vision
[2:36] correction and chronic conditions of the
[2:38] heart, we're we're it's a it's a matter
[2:40] of focus. It's what our priorities are.
[2:43] And I believe I said it last Sunday at
[2:44] the end of service that if your soul is
[2:46] right with God, then rejoice, right?
[2:48] Because that soul being sealed is your
[2:50] guarantee of a resurrection. It's a
[2:52] guarantee of the body change. It puts
[2:53] you into the body of Christ. And then if
[2:56] our soul is sealed, then our next
[2:58] concern is that our hearts are right.
[3:00] And so there is a difference then in the
[3:02] soul and the heart in that context. And
[3:04] so if we have if our soul is right then
[3:06] having the right heart is our main
[3:08] priority. And if our body is sick and we
[3:11] really need a healing and if our life um
[3:13] is even in peril because of a diagnosis
[3:16] uh that's a grave concern and it's a
[3:19] it's something very serious and so I'm
[3:21] not trying to belittle that at all. But
[3:23] even in that situation where
[3:25] debilitating back pain or some sort of
[3:27] chronic condition is impairing your
[3:29] ability to function and to be a mother
[3:31] or to provide for your family, you want
[3:33] God to heal you, but still the main goal
[3:37] would be that your heart would be right
[3:39] or your attitude would be right because
[3:41] that wrong kind of attitude and the
[3:43] wrong kind of expectation and negativity
[3:45] is going to keep you from receiving the
[3:47] healing that you so desperately need. In
[3:51] Psalms 107:20, this has been a very
[3:54] prominent scripture through these 12
[3:55] services. He sent his word and healed
[3:57] them and delivered them from their
[4:00] destructions. I know it may be difficult
[4:02] to recall, but when we first looked at
[4:03] the scripture, uh the psalmist is
[4:06] writing how that because of their
[4:07] iniquities and their sins, it's brought
[4:09] upon them this condition and their
[4:10] diseases and their problems. And so he
[4:13] says he sent his word and healed them
[4:15] and delivered them from their
[4:17] destructions. power. The power the word
[4:21] holds the power to save the soul to to
[4:24] heal our body and to perfect our heart.
[4:27] All that it's all in the word. He sent
[4:29] his word and healed them. You say,
[4:30] "Well, what kind of healing?" Well,
[4:31] there's power to save the soul. There's
[4:33] power to perfect the heart and there's
[4:35] power to heal the body within God's
[4:38] word. And we this is um this hopefully
[4:43] this will be a good summary of last week
[4:46] that when we when the that word which is
[4:48] sent and it's sent through the preaching
[4:50] of the word we could even see that it's
[4:52] sent through the written word and you
[4:55] first come into recognition or awareness
[4:58] of that promise through your physical
[5:00] sense of hearing or reading and then the
[5:02] mind has to take a hold of that and
[5:04] process what you hear. So the word
[5:06] preached is first heard through the
[5:08] sense of hearing or it's read uh through
[5:10] the sense of eyesight but then it's the
[5:13] mind that begins to make sense of those
[5:15] words and piece it together and
[5:17] understand speech and then there's a
[5:19] there's a process in your mind and in
[5:21] your spirits that gives meaning to it
[5:24] makes assumptions rejects it or believes
[5:27] it. There's a lot of things that takes
[5:28] place in your mind. And so what the word
[5:30] the first thing the word is doing is
[5:32] addressing your heart
[5:34] first. The first place it comes is into
[5:36] that mind and in your spirit and it's
[5:37] addressing your mind and your emotions.
[5:39] And brother Bam talks about how that
[5:41] word the world tries to swing your mind
[5:43] to the things of the world. And then
[5:45] what the preacher of the word of God
[5:46] does got to do is got to take you and
[5:48] swing you back.
[5:49] Right?
[5:49] Doesn't want to keep you in that worldly
[5:51] state of mind and and and basically save
[5:54] you, save you despite your mind and
[5:56] despite your will. The preaching of the
[5:57] word is to swing our minds and to deal
[5:59] with our emotions and get us to a place
[6:01] to where we're centered on the things of
[6:03] God. And then if we can say it this way,
[6:05] in your right mind, look to Christ to
[6:07] receive the promise.
[6:09] And so I want to go deeper into that
[6:12] function of the heart and the mind for a
[6:15] little bit of the foundation for I'm
[6:16] sorry. And you say, "Well, brother
[6:18] Aaron, is that you that's apologizing?"
[6:20] Absolutely.
[6:22] I'm sorry if I've done anything to
[6:23] offend you. I'm sorry if I've done
[6:24] anything to hurt you. Uh it would be it
[6:27] would be insensitive to not not
[6:29] apologize if somebody said, "Hey, that
[6:31] hurt my feelings." do. So, I'm sorry. I
[6:33] didn't mean to hurt your feelings. So,
[6:35] not that I'm being very subtle or
[6:37] passive aggressive today, but if you're
[6:39] if you're wondering where the title
[6:40] comes from, I think you'll catch it here
[6:42] in a little bit. So, Proverbs 4:23,
[6:46] this is a very weighty and heavy
[6:48] scripture. Uh we could spend numerous
[6:52] services just on this subject alone of
[6:54] the heart. Says, "Keep thy heart with
[6:56] all diligence." And just using this
[6:57] scripture alone, keep thy heart, guard
[6:59] it. I know we've spent some time on this
[7:01] in the past. Protect it. Uh uh look out
[7:03] after it. Keep thy heart with all
[7:05] diligence. For out of it, out of the
[7:07] heart are the issues of life. From the
[7:10] heart issues life. From the heart issues
[7:13] the things pertaining to life.
[7:15] So keep your heart which is the inner
[7:17] man, the the mind or the spirit. And uh
[7:20] because out of it are the issues of
[7:23] life. If I could put it this way, it
[7:24] influences every part of our life.
[7:26] Right?
[7:28] So you said guard your heart because
[7:30] life is going your life and your the way
[7:34] that you live and the way that you act
[7:36] and your demeanor and your character and
[7:37] these are going to come from that who
[7:39] you are as a person is going to come
[7:41] from that heart. And so it said guard
[7:43] your heart and this is the phrase I
[7:45] think I thought of yesterday that it's a
[7:47] processor with a bias that your heart h
[7:50] is a computer. It's a processor. It it
[7:52] it is an analyzer and it's going to spit
[7:55] out results and spit out conclusions and
[7:57] and and there's going to be input and
[7:59] there's going to be output. And so the
[8:01] Bible says guard it because there's
[8:03] things being input into it and so you
[8:05] want to protect it to keep it. But then
[8:07] because what comes in is going to come
[8:10] out in some sort of expression. And so
[8:12] the mind is going to take the spirit's
[8:14] going to take certain things in. It's
[8:15] going to receive this. It's going to
[8:16] receive that. It's going to receive
[8:17] this. And there's going to be a monster,
[8:19] right? like your your heart is a
[8:21] Frankenstein
[8:23] and it's it's piecing things together
[8:24] and cobbling things together and it's
[8:26] going to put out a monster because
[8:27] wasn't the doctor Frankenstein and the
[8:29] monster is just the monster. See, we
[8:31] learn things in church and so your heart
[8:33] is a Dr. Frankenstein piecing things
[8:35] together if it would if you would let it
[8:38] right and and producing something that
[8:40] is uh uh maybe very very scary and and
[8:44] something that's very harmful and
[8:45] something that's not true. So the Bible
[8:47] saying you got to protect it. You've got
[8:49] to guard it. You've got to take care of
[8:51] your heart because it's a processor that
[8:53] can have a bias. It's a processor that
[8:55] can be very very wrong. As the Bible
[8:57] says, the heart is desperately wicked.
[9:00] And so this scripture speaks of the
[9:02] proposition that we act from our hearts.
[9:05] We're act that's where the that that's
[9:07] part of we can say that way down in the
[9:11] soul. That's who you are. That's the
[9:13] person you are. Then that soul is is
[9:16] then dealing with the spirit to produce
[9:19] the expression of the manifestation. So
[9:21] we act from our heart. Imagination,
[9:23] conscience, memory, reason, affection
[9:25] are maybe uh five simple terms to kind
[9:28] of describe the major functions of the
[9:30] mind or the spirit. And in Proverbs
[9:33] 23:7, it says it this way, for as he
[9:36] thinkketh in his heart, so is he. Now,
[9:39] this is a statement, I believe, that
[9:40] stands on its own for every person. that
[9:42] as a man thinks, as we think, as what we
[9:45] ponder, what we uh reason about, what we
[9:48] talk about, and uh and and what kind of
[9:51] dominates our thought process. I was
[9:52] fellowshipping with a brother this past
[9:53] week, and he mentioned a situation that
[9:56] was just awful. And and in my mind, it
[9:58] just was like, "Wow, how does that
[10:00] happen?" And he said, "Just by letting
[10:03] one thought linger a little bit too
[10:04] long." And that's so that's where it
[10:06] begins. As a man thinks in his heart, so
[10:08] is he. as he reasons, as he calculates,
[10:11] as he even chooses to decide. It's a
[10:14] it's really remarkable in the sense that
[10:16] you get information and you're you're
[10:18] you have a choice to make. You you can
[10:20] say, "Wow, yay or nay or or good or bad
[10:23] or true or false and you have that
[10:25] ability uh to make that decision." And
[10:28] so you're reasoning and you're
[10:29] calculating. Proverbs put it puts it
[10:31] this way in chapter 19 21. There are
[10:34] many devices in a man's heart.
[10:37] calculations, valuations, processes.
[10:39] There's ways that it reasons and
[10:41] calculates and determines values. There
[10:42] are many devices in a man's heart. And
[10:45] so with some of these scriptures uh kind
[10:48] of pieced together, I hope it it's
[10:50] creating a little bit of a picture of
[10:52] the heart of a man and how it works so
[10:54] that we can look at it this way that our
[10:57] heart becomes a filter of what we hear,
[11:01] what we see, what we hear, and what we
[11:02] experience. Our so our mind or our
[11:05] spirit becomes this filter and as a
[11:07] filter it's not just a pass through it's
[11:09] saying up you can go yep you can go but
[11:12] as it passes through it leaves its mark
[11:15] on it
[11:16] right
[11:17] it it it as something comes through
[11:18] let's say something comes through and
[11:20] it's the sweetest most innocent comment
[11:22] this person's ever made and then your
[11:24] mind hears it and goes bad right that
[11:28] was mean that was sarcastic and your
[11:30] mind puts a stamp on it and so Now it's
[11:33] in your mind and what was swayed and
[11:35] innocent, what's in your mind is now
[11:36] nefarious and passive aggressive. And I
[11:39] always thought that brother was a really
[11:40] nice guy and this is the the meanest
[11:42] person I know. And so your spirit then
[11:44] influences it, paints, it colors, it
[11:46] stamps what is received. And since it's
[11:49] coloring what's received, then out of
[11:52] out of your heart issues your life and
[11:54] comes forth the things you think and
[11:56] things you believe. And so now it
[11:58] influences what is lived.
[12:01] Can you view the mind in your spirits,
[12:03] your hearts, whatever terminology you
[12:04] want to use? But that mysterious part of
[12:07] us that we can't see, that we've been
[12:08] wrestling with from the very moment
[12:10] we've been conscious, is who is this
[12:12] guy? What is he doing? What is he
[12:13] thinking? Why do things work out this
[12:15] way? That's what we're talking about is
[12:17] it has a way of just taking things and
[12:19] then it's going to leave its mark on it.
[12:21] And since it's going to leave a mark on
[12:22] it, it that's going to influence
[12:24] behavior. Sure.
[12:26] Brother Benham says it this way and I
[12:27] think this is a very precise way of
[12:30] looking at it and greatest battle ever
[12:31] fought. He said that word means
[12:33] everything. We can say amen to that. He
[12:35] says that word if you can get everything
[12:38] out of the way all conscience all senses
[12:40] and just let the word come in that word
[12:42] will produce just exactly. So if we took
[12:45] this and kind of diagrammed he says that
[12:47] word means everything and it's trying to
[12:48] find a place initially within our souls
[12:51] or it's trying to find a place to feed
[12:53] our soul or feed our faith so our faith
[12:55] can then influence and give vision and
[12:58] give voice to our spirits and direct our
[12:59] spirits. But he's saying if we could get
[13:01] everything out of the way, all
[13:03] conscience, he says, all senses, so
[13:05] imagination, affection, reason, memory,
[13:08] all these different things that get in
[13:09] the way, says if we could guard our
[13:12] hearts to keep those things out of the
[13:13] way or allow them to open up with, and
[13:16] they're all kind of sitting there going,
[13:17] "Can I stamp it?"
[13:19] And you know, the one's over there with
[13:21] the paintbrush like, "All right, come
[13:22] on, buddy. Just send it through here."
[13:25] It wants to paint it up real good. If we
[13:26] could just let it pass through the way
[13:28] that it is, it'll produce just exactly
[13:31] what it is.
[13:33] But your your heart stands ready to want
[13:35] to assess motives and do say this and
[13:38] say that and and and it and it's also
[13:40] working on how it's been programmed. Not
[13:42] not only in the nature that you receive
[13:44] from your parents, but even in the
[13:45] nurture that you receive through life.
[13:47] It has these instincts and these reasons
[13:49] it wants to do things and ways that it
[13:50] sees things. And brother Bamson saying
[13:52] if you could just let it out of the way
[13:54] so that it the word can remain what it
[13:56] is and you can receive that it'll
[13:57] produce.
[13:58] Exactly.
[14:00] Now another way that I want you to see
[14:02] view the heart then is not merely a pass
[14:05] through and I think I've tried to use a
[14:07] language that hasn't misled you in how
[14:11] I'm trying to describe this. It's not
[14:13] just merely a pass through where it's a
[14:15] a gate or a doorway and so our minds are
[14:18] kind of standing there as a guard or our
[14:21] minds are there and then it's going to
[14:22] let something through and then whatever
[14:23] it is it just comes and and moves on but
[14:26] it what what it allows to come in or
[14:29] what passes through it. So it's not just
[14:31] a temporary pass through but what once
[14:33] it comes into the mind the mind is has a
[14:36] is a like a chamber
[14:39] and and and once it's put in there it's
[14:41] a storage unit.
[14:43] It it it's a hard drive. It's a
[14:44] database. It's a place where things are
[14:46] stored. And so whether it be things you
[14:48] see, hear, taste, smell, feel,
[14:51] experience, whatever it might be, it's
[14:53] in there somewhere. And if we could only
[14:55] just figure out how to access more than
[14:57] 10% of our hard drive, we we we say that
[15:01] we'd be incredibly smart, but I think
[15:03] we'd be in incredibly psychotic
[15:06] and and suspicious and nervous all the
[15:08] time. But but this that if that could
[15:11] come in as it comes in, it's in there
[15:13] somewhere. It leaves an imprint. It's
[15:15] stored in there. It's like a it's it and
[15:17] it's stored for future use. That's
[15:19] right.
[15:20] Jesus says in Luke 6:45, "A good man out
[15:23] of the good treasure of his heart." So,
[15:26] a good man out of the good that is
[15:29] stored in his heart.
[15:31] The good treasure, something stored,
[15:33] something stored up, something kept,
[15:35] something learned, something held in his
[15:37] heart, bringeth forth that which is
[15:39] good. So Jesus describes it this way
[15:41] that there has been something stored up
[15:44] in a a man's heart that is good, and
[15:47] that's what comes out. He brings it
[15:49] forth. So there's things received that
[15:51] are then stored up for future use. Then
[15:53] he uses the opposite. And an evil man
[15:54] out of the evil treasure of his heart
[15:56] bringeth forth that which is evil. So
[15:59] what is stored, whether it be good or
[16:01] evil, is going to find its way out in
[16:04] some way because the heart becomes a
[16:06] storage unit. It becomes a database. It
[16:08] becomes a a a closet. That maybe that's
[16:10] a good way of looking at it. If you have
[16:12] a lot of skeletons in your closet,
[16:13] skeletons are going to come out. But
[16:16] there's a lot of things stored, a lot of
[16:17] treasures that in a man's heart and it
[16:20] says good or evil. And then even the
[16:22] phrase for the abundance
[16:25] for for of the abundance of the heart
[16:28] his mouth speaketh.
[16:30] The word that phrase the abundance of
[16:32] the heart is that which is stored up,
[16:34] right?
[16:35] That which is in there, what he has
[16:36] abundance of, what he's collected, what
[16:38] he's learned, what he's thinking about,
[16:39] what he what he what he values, and
[16:41] where your heart is. Jesus said, "There
[16:43] will your treasure be also." It's kind
[16:45] of saying that this is where you store
[16:47] your treasure. You store it in your
[16:48] heart. What you what you think, what you
[16:50] value, what you want, what you desire,
[16:52] what you hear, what you see. And this is
[16:54] why it's so important the things that we
[16:56] watch, the things that we listen to, the
[16:58] things that we talk about because we may
[17:00] think, "Oh, well, this is just a little
[17:01] bit of a moment. This is just a a moment
[17:03] that we can see this or enjoy this or do
[17:06] this." But the mind is keeping a record.
[17:09] The phrase I always want to use is to,
[17:11] but I don't think that's even a thing
[17:12] anymore. But I think it's DVR.
[17:14] It's recording all of it.
[17:16] Amen.
[17:17] As we have the saying uh not in our
[17:20] house necessarily, but humans have a
[17:21] saying, a moment on the lips, a lifetime
[17:23] on the hips to describe the scenario
[17:26] where you may think you're just enjoying
[17:28] that cinnamon roll. Just in that moment,
[17:31] and then it's all over, but it'll stay
[17:32] with you.
[17:34] The same thing with the things that come
[17:35] into our hearts and into our minds.
[17:38] There's a record that is kept. There's
[17:39] something an imprint that is left. In
[17:42] Ezekiel chapter 8:12,
[17:44] I feel that I may be doing a little bit
[17:46] of a disservice to this passage in
[17:47] Ezekiel 8 because it's a very maybe
[17:50] maybe some of you take time to go back
[17:51] and read it. The the language that's
[17:53] used to describe how the prophet is
[17:55] recognizing and seeing as it were by
[17:58] vision what people are doing in their
[18:00] private chambers and doing to worship
[18:02] and the way they hide these things and
[18:05] and the way that it's described would
[18:07] perfectly fit the way things are today.
[18:09] where one could be a Jew in public but
[18:12] then have that place at home when the
[18:14] door is closed where they can indulge in
[18:16] all sorts of evil practices. And the way
[18:19] that this is described here is a perfect
[18:22] I I I would say an extraordinary
[18:24] depiction of the human heart. Then said
[18:27] he unto me, "Son of man, hast thou seen
[18:29] what the ancients of the house of Israel
[18:32] do in the dark? Every man in the
[18:35] chambers of his imagery." Wow.
[18:37] Now, some take this phrase and I and I
[18:39] believe that it absolutely has this
[18:41] application. They say that the the
[18:43] writer is specifically referring to what
[18:46] certain Israelites were doing in a room
[18:48] that held false images. So, they had a
[18:51] secret place in a chamber where they had
[18:53] put up paintings and put up pictures. A
[18:55] and that application is absolutely
[18:58] acceptable and and in the context you
[19:01] can see that would be what the prophet
[19:03] would be pointing to. But in the
[19:05] language that he uses in the chamber of
[19:07] his imagery and the way that the prophet
[19:09] is indicting the hearts of the people,
[19:11] it has also a similar application not
[19:14] just to a literal room that has a screen
[19:16] or has pictures or has images but that
[19:18] part of the mind or that spirit which is
[19:21] a room of the rooms of our mind, the
[19:23] doors to our hearts, the chambers of our
[19:26] thinking.
[19:28] Amen. Just as our heart has chambers in
[19:31] a physical sense, our spirit or our
[19:33] minds have chambers, rooms
[19:37] where we could, if we even said that we
[19:39] have all sorts of bins, maybe our our
[19:42] minds are more organized than we think
[19:43] they are in that a place for everything
[19:46] and everything in its place. Hm, that's
[19:48] a lie. Well, I'll put that here. Right?
[19:50] That's a compliment. I'll put this here.
[19:51] Or maybe it says a lie. Well, I'll take
[19:53] it as a compliment. Or that's the truth.
[19:55] I'll perceive it as a lie. And it may be
[19:57] an absolute miscatategorization, but the
[19:59] mind just has rooms where it's storing
[20:01] stuff.
[20:03] Maybe it's just one real large large
[20:06] room with no doors, right? Or no subdos
[20:09] or closets, right, sisters? It's just
[20:11] one gigantic room, the mind. Everything
[20:13] exists in the same place at the same
[20:14] time. Whatever it is, there's chambers
[20:16] of our imagery.
[20:19] And in Proverbsap 18,
[20:22] this to me just uh uh helps nail this
[20:25] down perfectly for us. The words of a
[20:28] tail bearer are as wounds
[20:30] and they go down into the innermost
[20:32] parts of the belly.
[20:35] In other words, someone who lies and I
[20:37] believe it's both it's applicable to
[20:38] both the speaker and the hearer. When
[20:41] one lies, when you lie, it wounds your
[20:44] spirit.
[20:45] When you especially when you know you're
[20:46] lying, it's a wound to your spirit. But
[20:48] then the word to receive a lie, to hear
[20:50] a lie, to be lied on, it's saying and
[20:53] that maybe say, "Wow, that's quite a an
[20:56] extraordinary unpacking of that
[20:57] scripture because you it may seem that
[20:58] I'm pulling it different ways." But I
[21:00] believe it stands for the proposition
[21:02] that a lie is is does more than just
[21:06] what one would hear.
[21:09] And it's not just, oh, that's a lie, but
[21:11] it says it goes down into the innermost
[21:12] parts of the belly. Yeah,
[21:15] a lie we can say maybe injures the
[21:18] chamber of our heart
[21:21] but it says it goes down into the
[21:23] innermost parts of the belly. There's
[21:24] some other scriptures we were going to
[21:25] use that we took out how the the breach
[21:27] in the spirit and these words how they
[21:28] become a breach. So there's an injury
[21:30] when the lie is told. There's an injury
[21:33] when we hear that lie in the innermost
[21:35] parts of the belly. It's describing
[21:37] something being received and then it
[21:39] says it goes down. In other words, it's
[21:40] deposited into the storehouse.
[21:43] It becomes a treasure in your heart.
[21:45] Something that is stored up. Something
[21:47] that if you hear enough and you hear
[21:48] enough and you hear enough, it's from
[21:49] the abundance of the heart that the the
[21:51] mouth will begin to speak. Because our
[21:53] spirits become reservoirs, holding
[21:56] tanks, storage units
[21:59] for the things that we experience in
[22:01] life and perceive in life.
[22:04] Now for a very practical application of
[22:06] this
[22:08] and and this is now
[22:12] maybe uh I didn't realize what a hard
[22:14] break this would be to come to this
[22:15] statement of perfect faith but now we
[22:19] could start to zero in on the the the
[22:21] title I'm sorry
[22:23] it says in the message perfect faith you
[22:24] must believe what you ask for if you are
[22:27] a believer recognize yourself as a
[22:29] believer so important recognize that
[22:31] these things are for you that's let's
[22:33] you know settle that you're a believer
[22:35] these things are for you. He says if
[22:36] there's condemnation in your life
[22:38] straighten that first. So where would
[22:41] the condemnation be if our hearts
[22:42] condemn us? The condemnation would be in
[22:44] your heart. Your mind is a judge. It's a
[22:46] judger. It's a decider as brother
[22:48] brother George Bush would say. And so
[22:50] it's deciding these things and it's
[22:52] making decisions and it's processing
[22:54] saying yay or nay or yes or no or true
[22:56] or false, good or bad, light or
[22:58] darkness. And and it's all in there.
[22:59] there and he's saying if your heart's
[23:01] condemning you, if your heart is aware
[23:02] of something, if there's something not
[23:04] right in your heart, he says make that
[23:06] right first. Straighten that first. He
[23:08] says if you got condition in your and
[23:10] now he's he's wanting if you got
[23:12] condemnation in your heart. So if it's
[23:15] he he's looking at the conditions of our
[23:17] heart and how it relates to us as a
[23:19] believer receiving the things that for
[23:21] are for us title perfect faith. Now he
[23:25] uses this example. He says, "You might
[23:26] have Or Roberts and a dozen more people
[23:28] who have faith to come here and pray
[23:30] over you and jump up and down and pour
[23:32] oil on you by the gallons." How you like
[23:35] that? Pour oil on you by the gallons. It
[23:38] won't move. That's right.
[23:42] That's that's just extraordinary
[23:44] statement, right? Men that have faith,
[23:48] dozen more that have faith pray, jumping
[23:50] down, pour oil on you. What what isn't
[23:52] an illusion to anointing with oil and
[23:54] laying hands on the sick and praying?
[23:55] He's saying that as a believer, and I
[23:57] think it's important to recognize in the
[23:59] context of being a believer, there's
[24:02] something not right. He's saying it
[24:03] won't move. That's right. What falls off
[24:05] from oral's meetings to that. I catch
[24:07] them in a prayer line. You hear him say,
[24:09] you was prayed for before. And he says,
[24:11] you hear him say, so he's saying in the
[24:13] discernment, you was prayed for before,
[24:15] a man with dark hair, kind of a big
[24:17] fell, a big jaw. That's right. That or
[24:20] he says that's Oral Roberts. And that
[24:21] was at a certain city called a certain
[24:23] certain thing. Yes, that's right. you
[24:25] were prayed by such and such a man. See,
[24:27] like that. But here it is. So, do you
[24:29] recognize he's kind of telling us, we've
[24:31] all heard this if we're listening to the
[24:32] sermons that in the in the prayer line,
[24:35] Brother Brandon could identify
[24:38] diagnosis or prayers or standing before
[24:40] a doctor. You went and you were prayed
[24:41] for and maybe the sickness is obvious or
[24:44] the sickness is not necessarily a secret
[24:46] or they've already been prayed for and
[24:47] that secret. He says, "But here it is.
[24:49] Here's your trouble.
[24:52] go make that thing, right?
[24:56] So there's they're they're sick and you
[24:58] could pray for them. You could anoint
[25:00] them, pour oil on them by the gallons.
[25:03] Says, but yet there's something in their
[25:04] heart that's got to be moved first.
[25:08] Before the sickness can be moved.
[25:10] So he says, "Go make that right." He
[25:12] says, "Go over there and confess that
[25:13] sin to your husband, to your wife. Go do
[25:15] this thing.
[25:16] It'll never do you any good, no matter
[25:18] who you pray for, till you make that
[25:20] right. Wow.
[25:23] This is instructive to us as believers
[25:25] to realize that if there's something
[25:26] that we're regarding in our heart,
[25:28] something we know that is not right,
[25:29] something we know that is wrong, we
[25:31] ought not to fool ourselves into
[25:32] thinking that that can go unadressed and
[25:35] I can get the healing that I need.
[25:37] Condemnation is in your heart and God
[25:39] will not come into that heart condemned.
[25:40] God, don't dwell in that. You got to
[25:42] make it right. Then when you do, you
[25:45] must have faith. When you've made that
[25:47] right, it's liberating to your faith.
[25:49] Because if you have faith in your soul
[25:51] and it's wanting to burst its way out,
[25:53] but there's a door, a barrier of
[25:55] condemnation in your heart is in I I
[25:58] can't get past this. I I I I can't get
[26:00] this out of the way. The word can't get
[26:02] past that. Faith is wanting to come
[26:04] through it. And your faith in the word,
[26:05] those omnipotents aren't able to meet
[26:07] because condemnation's in the way
[26:09] saying, "Maybe I don't deserve it. I
[26:11] know that I'm not right. I I I I I I
[26:13] shouldn't have done that. And it stays
[26:15] there holding those two omnipotents
[26:18] back.
[26:20] I think this is very very simple, very
[26:22] practical,
[26:24] very needful. In James chapter 5, let's
[26:27] read verses 13- 16 since this is one of
[26:31] the the prominent scriptures that we've
[26:33] been using and we look at when it comes
[26:36] to
[26:39] uh divine healing and our and the
[26:41] promise of healing and the mechanics
[26:43] even of laying hands on the sick. Now,
[26:45] we've looked at verse 13 over the last
[26:48] few services. Is any among you
[26:50] afflicted? Let him pray. It's disturbed
[26:52] in your hearts, unsettled in your
[26:54] hearts. Any of you afflicted? It's the
[26:56] the the stirred up passions of the mind,
[26:58] some sort of grievance or some sort of
[27:00] hardness in your suffering in your
[27:02] spirit. So he says, if your heart's not
[27:04] right, pray to soften your heart, to
[27:06] season your spirits. Are is any Mary? Or
[27:08] we could say, are you sad? Yes. If
[27:11] you're sad, sing psalms. All has to do
[27:14] with getting in the right mood, the
[27:15] right mode, the right frame of thinking,
[27:17] the right mental attitude. And that's
[27:19] what James is dealing with. He says, "Is
[27:21] any sick among you? Let him call for the
[27:23] elders of the church and let them pray
[27:25] over him anointing him with oil in the
[27:28] name of the Lord and the prayer of faith
[27:30] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[27:33] raise him up. This is a promise of
[27:35] healing, a promise of laying hands on
[27:37] the sick. A promise that if we anoint
[27:39] with oil and we pray over them, the
[27:40] prayer of faith, it's the prayer of
[27:41] faith, not the the oil, but it's the
[27:43] prayer of faith that shall save the sick
[27:45] and the Lord shall raise him up and if
[27:48] he have committed sins, they shall be
[27:50] forgiven him. Now this is a conjunction.
[27:52] It's joining this thought of sickness in
[27:55] the body being healed and the
[27:56] forgiveness of sins which you would be
[27:58] conscious of or afflicted by in your
[28:01] spirit or that are laid charged to you
[28:03] as a person whole as a whole. Says if
[28:05] you have committed sins they shall be
[28:07] forgiven him. Confess your faults one to
[28:09] another and pray one for another that
[28:12] you may be healed. Amen.
[28:15] Now, when you read this again, we can
[28:18] say, well, if you're sick, call for the
[28:19] elders and have them pray over you,
[28:21] anoint you with oil, and the prayer of
[28:22] faith shall save the sick. And James has
[28:24] kind of built these boundaries around
[28:26] that that have to do with the right
[28:28] mental attitude in verse 13. Then then
[28:31] also another condition of the heart when
[28:33] he says, "Confess your faults to one
[28:34] another. Pray for one another that you
[28:36] may be healed." He's saying, "Confess
[28:38] your wrongs. Make things right so that
[28:40] you may be healed. Pray for others that
[28:43] you may be healed. Pray for those who've
[28:44] done you wrong that they may be healed.
[28:47] He's what you realize what he's
[28:49] identifying as a potential barrier to
[28:51] the effectiveness of a prayer is whether
[28:54] or not something isn't right in
[28:56] someone's life or in their heart.
[28:58] Confess your faults one another. Pray
[29:00] for one another that you may be healed.
[29:01] The effectual fervent prayer of a
[29:04] righteous man avaleth much.
[29:08] the effectual fervent prayer of a man
[29:10] who knows that he is forgiven. A man who
[29:12] has addressed his iniquities, a man who
[29:14] has been found to be right because he
[29:17] made things right. Let's not just think
[29:20] of a a real holy, pious man who lives a
[29:22] sinless life and we're all just trying
[29:24] to find that guy who has never sinned
[29:26] because if he prays things will happen.
[29:28] But no, it's the coni. It's the the
[29:30] righteous man is one who confesses
[29:32] faults and asks for forgiveness and
[29:35] therefore has his sins and even his
[29:37] trespasses and the things he does
[29:38] wrongs. He is putting them under the
[29:40] blood and his conscience is cleansed and
[29:42] he knows he's not perfect but he's under
[29:44] a perfect blood. When that man prays, it
[29:47] avails much.
[29:48] So it's not just a perfect man who never
[29:51] sinned who can pray the perfect prayer
[29:52] to give you your perfect healing. But
[29:54] the power of that kind of prayer is
[29:57] within within your potential if you
[29:59] could just say I'm sorry.
[30:01] Amen.
[30:03] Confess your faults to one another. Pray
[30:05] for one another that you may be healed.
[30:07] The effectual fervent prayer of a
[30:08] righteous man avaleth much. Now I know
[30:12] especially cons uh if you take into
[30:13] consideration what we preached Wednesday
[30:14] night. I realize in the way that my mind
[30:17] works that if I was my own critic and I
[30:19] was giving myself feedback, maybe we'd
[30:21] say, "Brother Heron, you're making
[30:22] healing really complicated."
[30:25] And I would say, "No, it's complex."
[30:29] Right?
[30:30] Because diseases are very complex.
[30:34] Sicknesses can be very complex. You say,
[30:36] "Oh, you got this problem. Well, all you
[30:37] need to do is this and all you need to
[30:38] do is that all you need to do is" And
[30:39] and sometimes we just think the solution
[30:41] is really easy because that's what
[30:42] worked for us. But people every person
[30:45] is different. We made reference to this
[30:47] often how Jesus approached the same
[30:50] disease from different angles. Why?
[30:52] Because the person itself had to have
[30:55] their minds moved. They they had to be
[30:57] addressed a certain way. As the and
[30:59] where in the one leopard Jesus said,
[31:01] "Hey, you know, go get healed, right?
[31:04] Never touched him. Just spoke to him,
[31:05] told him something to do." Whereas with
[31:07] another, Jesus went to him and laid his
[31:09] hands on him. In each instance, maybe
[31:11] the one had enough confidence to go do
[31:13] what Jesus told him to do to be healed,
[31:15] but the other through the complex of
[31:17] leprosy, through the ostracization,
[31:19] through the wounding, through the
[31:20] whatever it might have been that he went
[31:22] through, the fact that Jesus would, this
[31:24] rabbi, this master, this teacher would
[31:26] take his hands and lay them upon him,
[31:27] melted away any kind of resistance, any
[31:30] kind of suspicion
[31:32] or or fears or uh any kind of stigma he
[31:35] might have even placed or stereotype he
[31:37] placed on Christ, it's melted away in
[31:39] that moment.
[31:41] And so I I I by no means am trying to
[31:44] make it complicated, but I do want you
[31:46] to realize that if you are wanting
[31:49] something from God and you're and you
[31:51] see it as a promise in God's word and
[31:53] it's not happening, then something's out
[31:56] of place somewhere.
[31:57] Amen.
[31:58] And thank God we could go look right at
[32:00] the scripture we were looking to to
[32:01] receive our healing and realize, wow,
[32:03] you know, I was in a really bad mood. My
[32:06] heart wasn't right. I didn't have the
[32:07] right mental attitude. Oh, there's
[32:08] unforgiveness in my heart. There's sin
[32:10] in my life, whatever may. And you look
[32:12] straight to the promise of God and see
[32:14] your answer.
[32:16] And so, James, I think you could say it
[32:18] this way. James is identifying both the
[32:20] cause of the sickness when he deals with
[32:22] sin because he says pray the prayer of
[32:24] faith shall save the sick and if he
[32:26] committed sins, they shall be forgiven
[32:27] him. I it's read in this way and I know
[32:30] that a lot of commentators agree that
[32:32] that if the sin the sickness was as a
[32:34] result of sin that it's assumed in the
[32:37] process especially to a Jew it's assumed
[32:39] in the process that that sin would be
[32:40] atoned for or asked forgiveness of and
[32:43] then the person is healed and that would
[32:45] be and if he had committed sins it's
[32:47] forgiven and so I believe he's also he's
[32:50] look not only looking at the cause of
[32:52] the sickness but also the hindrance to
[32:53] the healing and it's talking about this
[32:55] unbelief or this sin doubt there's
[32:57] There's a lot of ways you could describe
[32:58] it. Now, this is how brother Brandham
[33:00] refers to it just in one place. There's
[33:03] other instances where he
[33:06] has this kind of um emphasis.
[33:09] The title is has the Lord spoken only to
[33:11] Moses. He says, "In every one of you
[33:12] right now, if you've got unforgiven
[33:15] sins, you confess it and make it right
[33:18] and God will heal you.
[33:22] But he can't heal you with unforgiven
[33:24] sin.
[33:26] Satan still has the jurisdiction over
[33:28] you.
[33:30] I appreciate how soberly we're amening
[33:32] this statement.
[33:35] If you have unforgiven sins
[33:38] that you have not confessed, that you
[33:40] have not owned, that you have not
[33:41] acknowledged, he says, make them right,
[33:43] confess them and make them right. If
[33:45] this unforgiveness that's in your life
[33:47] because you have not asked for
[33:48] forgiveness, you have not confessed your
[33:50] faults to Christ, to God, he says, make
[33:52] it right and God will heal you. But he
[33:54] says he can't heal you with unforgiven
[33:56] sin. Now I know that's a principle that
[33:59] uh is in itself maybe deserving of
[34:01] scriptures and and consideration. And
[34:04] then he says Satan still has a
[34:06] jurisdiction over you. Now, what I want
[34:08] us to do is to acknowledge that this
[34:12] holds a truth that unforgiven sins
[34:17] will hinder us from being healed and
[34:20] that there's a power that the sickness
[34:21] has over you as long as your spirit is
[34:24] compromised
[34:26] through sin. Look at this example in the
[34:28] scripture. 1 Corinthians chap 11:es
[34:31] 28-31. This is Paul uh outlining
[34:35] the divine ordinance of communion and
[34:37] how that we ought to approach the
[34:39] communion table to partake of the bread.
[34:41] This this bread is my body which is
[34:42] broken for you. This blood is the the
[34:45] the blood of the new covenant which is
[34:47] shed for your sins. So remember those
[34:49] specific details. The body being broken.
[34:52] By his stripes we are healed. By his
[34:54] blood being shed, it atones for our
[34:56] sins. And so that's the image on the
[34:59] communion table is the bread which is
[35:00] his which represents his body just
[35:02] symbolically and the wine which is a
[35:04] symbolic representation of his blood.
[35:07] And now before we take the bread and
[35:09] drink the wine, he says verse 28, but
[35:11] let a man examine himself. And so let
[35:14] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[35:16] cup after he has what? Thought upon his
[35:19] ways, examined himself, searched out his
[35:21] heart, prayed. He says, "For he that
[35:24] eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth
[35:27] and drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[35:29] discerning the Lord's body." Paul is
[35:32] alluding directly to that communion to
[35:35] drinking the wine and eating the bread
[35:38] that in partaking of the Lord's supper
[35:40] of eating a a an unleavened bread and
[35:44] drinking wine that the person having
[35:47] done it without their heart being right
[35:49] and having not examined themselves and
[35:51] partaking of it, eating and drinking
[35:53] unworthily dams himself.
[35:56] Now, we'll come to some scriptures here
[35:58] in a moment. I don't think I took them
[35:59] out. how that the the condemnation isn't
[36:02] in it's not entirely that God has a rule
[36:05] or a law and that when you violate it,
[36:07] he just sends down a lightning bolt and
[36:09] goes and condemns you. But you're a
[36:12] believer and you know when you don't do
[36:15] things right.
[36:17] You know when you're wrong. And so the
[36:19] condemnation doesn't even have to be
[36:21] God. It's your own spirit, your own soul
[36:24] that knows better, that gives you that
[36:26] conviction, that gives you that thought
[36:27] of, "Oh, you even if he could even put
[36:29] it this way, for some of us, the soul
[36:31] says, now you need to make that right."
[36:32] And the spirit, instead of just making
[36:33] it right, goes, "I'm condemned. I'm
[36:35] condemned. I'm condemned."
[36:38] Right?
[36:39] And the soul's like, "No, you just can't
[36:41] make it right. I'm condemned. No, make
[36:44] it right, pal." And but the heart and
[36:46] the mind, the spirit, whatever it is,
[36:48] just keeps wrestling with it. rest
[36:50] within the souls just agonizing. No,
[36:52] that there's a way made. There's a
[36:53] fountain open. There's a way to be
[36:54] healed. There's a way to be forgiven.
[36:56] But he says, "If you don't eat worthily,
[36:58] you damn yourself because you're not
[37:00] discerning the Lord's body." Because
[37:01] there's an approach to it. For this
[37:04] cause, many are weak and sickly among
[37:06] you, and many sleep.
[37:09] For what cause? A man not examining
[37:12] himself. And a man eating and drinking
[37:15] unworthily has caused sicknesses within
[37:17] the body. And he says many in a
[37:19] premature grave perhaps. But because as
[37:21] many sleep, which would be death. For if
[37:22] we would judge ourselves, we should not
[37:24] be judged.
[37:26] The examination first. And if we judge
[37:29] ourselves first, then we don't act in a
[37:31] manner that condemns ourselves. And
[37:33] therefore, we are not we should not be
[37:35] condemned or judged.
[37:37] And if I could say it this way, if this
[37:39] is so for the symbolic partaking of the
[37:43] bread and wine, how much more in this
[37:46] the receiving of the spiritual and
[37:48] literal benefits
[37:49] of the body and and blood?
[37:52] The body and blood are represented in
[37:53] the atonement for salvation and healing.
[37:56] The blood being shed for the forgiveness
[37:58] of our sins. By his stripes, we are
[38:00] healed. In that image of the sacrificial
[38:02] lamb, it atones for sin. And because it
[38:05] atones for sin, it also atones for
[38:07] sickness. You cannot deal with sin
[38:09] without dealing with disease and dealing
[38:11] with sickness. And so if it's in the
[38:13] symbolic partaking of the bread and the
[38:16] body and and the blood and the and the
[38:19] wine, in the symbolic partaking of it,
[38:21] if we can be sick, think about it. If we
[38:24] could be sick, many are sick and weak
[38:26] among you, because they have not
[38:28] parttook of the symbolic elements with
[38:30] the right spirit. Then how much more can
[38:33] we be sick?
[38:35] Or can we not be healed because of our
[38:38] spirits?
[38:40] We cannot approach the atonement with a
[38:43] cloudy heart, a cloudy mind, a condemned
[38:45] heart.
[38:47] Think of how much preparation that the
[38:49] priest had to make before they could
[38:52] come into that altar.
[38:54] All those elements and processes of
[38:56] sanctifying and being anointed with oil
[38:58] and dressing himself a particular way is
[39:00] symbolic of how importance the
[39:02] conditions of our minds and our
[39:03] thinkings and our thoughts and our focus
[39:05] and our energy and our all those things
[39:07] are and our awareness are to receiving
[39:10] the promises of God.
[39:15] Faith, the faith that we need for
[39:17] healing, let's look at 2 Chronicles
[39:19] chapter 7. The faith that we need for
[39:20] healing
[39:22] cannot be a prop cannot properly be
[39:24] appropriated to the promise
[39:28] unless there's been unless we have asked
[39:30] God as brother Bam says it here
[39:32] unforgiven sins. We cannot approach it
[39:35] without forgiveness.
[39:37] In 2 Chronicles chapter 7:14, if my
[39:40] people that was maybe the other title I
[39:42] was going to give the sermon was just
[39:44] forgiveness because that is the large
[39:46] this is the subject we're looking at in
[39:48] how why we are sick but then also how we
[39:52] can be healed. Forgiveness
[39:56] in 2 Chronicles chapter 7 verse 14. If
[39:58] my people which are called by my name
[40:00] shall humble themselves and pray and
[40:04] seek my face and turn from their wicked
[40:07] ways. Now, there's a lot of different
[40:08] elements here. You have to humble
[40:09] yourself.
[40:11] Pray. And your prayer is to seek his
[40:13] face, to seek his countenance, to seek
[40:15] his will. And then there's a turning.
[40:17] There's a repentance. There's an
[40:18] acknowledge to turn from your wicked
[40:20] ways. It implies that you acknowledge
[40:23] that you have been acting wickedly. And
[40:26] I am sorry for that, and I'm repenting,
[40:29] and I'm no longer going to continue to
[40:30] walk that way. And so, there is the I'm
[40:33] sorry. Please forgive me. says then will
[40:35] I hear from heaven
[40:38] when they have when they have gone
[40:39] through this will I I'll hear from
[40:40] heaven and says and will forgive their
[40:42] sin so your prayer that when you have
[40:45] humbled yourself and prayed and repented
[40:48] and said you're sorry then he hears and
[40:51] the first thing he does is forgive you
[40:52] of your sin and will forgive their sin
[40:54] and will should be no surprise here heal
[40:58] their land
[41:00] that there is a process and approach to
[41:02] God that we can't just go and say ohord
[41:04] Lord, heal me. Heal me. Lord, I need
[41:06] healing. And there'll be something in
[41:07] your heart that you need to make right.
[41:09] And you have to make that right. And he
[41:11] will forgive you. And then he will heal
[41:14] you.
[41:15] God will heal you. But he can't heal you
[41:17] with unforgiven sin. Because Satan and
[41:20] just terminology,
[41:22] he has jurisdiction over you because of
[41:24] that unbelief.
[41:27] Turn from their wicked ways. Then he'll
[41:30] hear, forgive, and heal.
[41:35] Matthew chapter 6:es 9-13. I think I was
[41:38] wrong about us being cold the whole
[41:40] service.
[41:41] In Matthew chapter 6:es 9-13,
[41:46] we've read the we read the first
[41:49] uh eight verses to this.
[41:54] Let's look at verse nine. He says,
[41:56] "After this manner, therefore pray ye."
[42:02] James is saying that the effectual
[42:04] fervent prayer of a righteous man avails
[42:06] much. If you're afflicted, pray. If
[42:09] you're sick, call for the elders. Have
[42:11] them pray over you. And the prayer of
[42:13] faith shall save the sick. If you want
[42:15] to seek my face, humble yourself and
[42:16] pray. Turn from your good ways. Then
[42:18] I'll hear, forgive, and heal. So Jesus
[42:21] is now going to say, "This is how you
[42:23] can pray. Our Father, which art in
[42:25] heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[42:27] kingdom come, thy will be done in earth
[42:30] as it is in heaven." Now, we could say
[42:32] that that's kind of the the opening of
[42:35] the prayer. And then here's the ask.
[42:38] Give us this day our daily bread. Th
[42:41] this is the ask. This is the desire.
[42:43] Give us this day our daily bread. And
[42:45] forgive us our debts
[42:47] as we forgive our debtors. And lead us
[42:49] not into temptation, but deliver us from
[42:51] evil. For thine is the kingdom and the
[42:53] power and the glory forever. Amen.
[42:56] There's what is called the Lord's
[42:58] Prayer. The Lord teaching the disciples
[42:59] how to pray.
[43:01] And I want to focus on verses 11 and 12.
[43:05] There's such a deep secret that Christ
[43:07] is teaching us when we ask the father
[43:10] for anything. Verse 11's the ask. Give
[43:13] us this day our daily bread. But the the
[43:16] the way that the prayer unfolds, it's
[43:18] not Lord, give us this day our daily
[43:20] bread and and and forgive us. You know,
[43:23] God is neat. Let's eat. Amen. Right?
[43:26] He there every phrase in this is so
[43:28] heavy,
[43:29] so powerful, so pertinent, so uh dives
[43:33] into such great depth whether it be our
[43:35] father which art in heaven and hallowed
[43:37] be thy name and thy kingdom come thy
[43:39] will be done in earth as it is. There's
[43:41] such richness to it but I want to focus
[43:43] on this one part where he is saying give
[43:45] us this day our daily bread give us the
[43:46] things that we have need of and forgive
[43:48] us our debts. He says, "As we forgive
[43:49] our debtors," he is touching on the
[43:52] secret, the the real kernel, the real
[43:55] heart of receiving when you ask.
[44:00] And we say, we not only do we say, "Give
[44:02] us this day our daily bread," but we
[44:03] say, "Forgive us our debts." And just as
[44:06] it says in 2 Chronicles, if you people
[44:08] are called by my name will humble
[44:09] themselves and pray, seek my face, and
[44:10] turn from their wicked ways to say,
[44:12] "Forgive us our debts." We must seek
[44:14] forgiveness
[44:15] and we must forsake all unbelief.
[44:19] We if I could put it this way, I know
[44:21] it's real self- serving, but he said,
[44:23] "Give us this day our daily bread and
[44:25] we're sorry. I'm sorry for anything I've
[44:27] done wrong." Right? There there's an
[44:30] acknowledgement. There's a there's
[44:31] asking God to forgive us of our sins
[44:33] because we know that scripturally that
[44:36] if we hold sin in our hearts as we
[44:38] approach the sacrifice, our own
[44:41] conscience will condemn us in our hearts
[44:43] and condemn us from being able to
[44:45] appropriate our own faith to the
[44:47] promise.
[44:49] And then on another side, there's an
[44:50] element where God himself will not
[44:53] answer your prayer if there's something
[44:56] you need to make make right. And instead
[44:58] of going, "That's not fair." Say, "Thank
[45:01] God."
[45:03] Right?
[45:04] Thank God. There's things he does not
[45:06] answer for us because you need to make
[45:08] that right first. You're never going to
[45:09] get what you want until you make it
[45:11] right. Thank God he is that way.
[45:14] In Psalm 66:18, "If I regard iniquity in
[45:17] my heart, the Lord will not hear me."
[45:20] That's pretty obvious, right? Pretty
[45:22] plain. If I regard iniquity in my heart,
[45:24] the Lord will not hear me. This is a
[45:26] straight uh uh psalm that I think is
[45:28] very easy to understand that the
[45:29] regarding the accepting, the holding,
[45:32] the the allowing of iniquity, something
[45:34] that's you know has deviated from the
[45:37] proper course of conduct or some
[45:38] omission on your part, the Lord will not
[45:40] hear me. Proverbs 28:9, he that turneth
[45:42] away his ear from hearing the law, even
[45:44] his prayer shall be abomination.
[45:48] If you turn your ear away from hearing
[45:50] the law, if you refuse to obey, if
[45:52] there's a l a refusal to submit to the
[45:54] teachings of Christ, if there's a
[45:56] stubbornness, if there's a rebellion, it
[45:57] says even then your prayer is an
[45:59] abomination. How is it then that one
[46:02] that turns his ear away from hearing the
[46:04] law, how is it that he could even then
[46:05] pray to be saved or for to to be made
[46:08] right? He would have to first say, "I'm
[46:10] sorry." to address the turning away.
[46:13] John chapter 9:31, it says, "Now we know
[46:16] that God heareth not sinners. But if any
[46:18] man be a worshshiper of God and doeth
[46:20] his will, him he heareth." What does it
[46:23] speak to? The condition of the heart
[46:25] when a man prays, when a man ask. In 1
[46:27] John 3:22, "And whatsoever we ask, we
[46:30] receive of him because we keep his
[46:32] commandments and do those things that
[46:34] are pleasing in his sight."
[46:35] Right?
[46:37] Notice just how rich the scriptures are
[46:39] when it comes to again not complicating
[46:41] it, but recognizing that we we approach
[46:44] God with the simple faith of believing,
[46:46] but there's so many things that corrupt
[46:48] and complicate or make complex our quote
[46:51] unquote simple faith because on one
[46:53] hand, we're believing for healing, but
[46:55] on another hand, we're rebelling against
[46:56] God's precepts.
[46:59] we're we're we're we're kind of acting
[47:00] against. There's a situation uh that
[47:03] happened here recently uh with someone I
[47:05] know where they testified to the
[47:07] goodness of God based upon uh their
[47:10] obedience to the things of God and then
[47:12] they they slipped back from that
[47:14] obedience. They said recognized that God
[47:16] had done something tremendous for them
[47:18] and that there's they had set forth to
[47:21] do the things that God had asked him to
[47:22] do and immediately upon doing it
[47:24] everything got right. But then because
[47:26] everything was getting good, they they
[47:27] slipped back and stopped doing it and
[47:29] then immediately afflicted again.
[47:33] It's a principle that we could see then
[47:35] and Jesus is teaching us. Give us this
[47:37] day our daily bread and forgive us our
[47:39] debts. Lord, please forgive us. Forgive
[47:43] us where we've done wrong. Humble
[47:44] ourselves and just say, Lord, I'm sorry
[47:46] for what I've done. And don't try to
[47:47] figure out what the uh uh it it's not
[47:52] for you to try to decide, you know, how
[47:54] much that you've sowed is going to come
[47:55] back to haunt you. Just make it right.
[47:58] Just make it right. It doesn't matter.
[48:00] There's sometimes people kind of say,
[48:02] "Well, you know, I'll say I'm sorry if
[48:04] it means I'm off the hook.
[48:06] I'll own it." You know, they say ask you
[48:09] ask your child and I'm speculating here.
[48:11] I've just heard other people tell me the
[48:12] stories how you want you want your child
[48:14] to admit to something if they've done
[48:16] something. And did you do this? Did you
[48:17] do this? Like, well, am I going to get
[48:18] grounded?
[48:20] Am I going to get a spanking? Elliot,
[48:22] you're 14 years old. I doubt I'm going
[48:23] to spank you. But there's a uh there's
[48:26] this uh I had to call him out. He says,
[48:28] "I do it every service, and I wouldn't
[48:29] want him to be wrong."
[48:34] So, there's we're we're asking them to
[48:37] make it right, to own it, and they're
[48:39] afraid to, right? Because the
[48:41] consequences
[48:42] and we can't think that way. That's how
[48:45] that processor with the bias is going to
[48:47] get you in trouble. And you just need to
[48:49] say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake. I
[48:50] just want to make it right."
[48:53] Here's a statement I know you've heard
[48:54] before. Brother says, "Your misbehavior
[48:56] of unconfessed sins of you believers can
[48:59] cause this church to bitterly fail."
[49:04] Your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of
[49:07] you believers can cause this church to
[49:10] bitterly fail.
[49:12] Think of how powerful it is. Then our
[49:14] own conscience, our own sanctification,
[49:17] the way that we live, the misbehavior of
[49:19] unconfessed sins can cause a church to
[49:21] bitterly fail because we want to see God
[49:23] do something, but God cannot do it as
[49:25] long as we regard iniquity in our
[49:27] hearts.
[49:29] First John 19, if we confess our sins,
[49:31] he's faithful and just to forgive us our
[49:34] sins and to cleanse us from all
[49:36] unrighteousness. Maybe a different take
[49:38] on that, but on this, but sickness is
[49:40] unrighteousness.
[49:42] Sickness is a healthy body perverted. A
[49:44] sickness is a a breach, a wound. And he
[49:46] says, if we are confess our sins, he's
[49:48] faithful just to forgive us our sins and
[49:50] to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[49:52] I do believe it stands for the
[49:53] proposition that if we confess, he is
[49:56] faithful and just to forgive. And in the
[49:58] forgiving, there's going to be a
[50:00] cleansing. And the results of that
[50:01] making that right and saying, "I'm
[50:03] sorry." in God forgiving us of our sins
[50:06] and feeling that washness, that
[50:08] cleanliness that comes from being
[50:09] washed. That there's a positive benefit
[50:12] from that
[50:14] through saying, "I'm sorry for this. I'm
[50:17] sorry for what I've done." The offense,
[50:19] what you've done wrong, is acknowledged.
[50:20] I'm sorry that I've done this. It's
[50:22] acknowledged. And then God addresses it
[50:24] through forgiveness. And then we can
[50:25] live free from it.
[50:27] Amen.
[50:28] Now, if I could take this a step
[50:29] further, Jesus says, teaching us how to
[50:31] pray. Our Father, which art in heaven,
[50:33] hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,
[50:34] thy will be done, as it is in heaven, in
[50:36] earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
[50:38] day our daily bread, and forgive us our
[50:39] debts as we forgive our debtors,
[50:45] and lead us not into temptation, but
[50:46] deliver us from evil. For thine is the
[50:48] kingdom and the power and the glory
[50:50] forever. Amen. There is him teaching us
[50:53] how to pray. And there's this part there
[50:55] right in the middle of it as we forgive
[50:59] our debtors.
[51:01] And it's the one thing that Jesus comes
[51:02] back to.
[51:04] He doesn't say uh our father which art
[51:06] in heaven because your father is in
[51:08] heaven and hallowed be thy name because
[51:09] it's his name that is holy and thy
[51:10] kingdom come. It's speaking to this and
[51:12] thy will be done and the elements of
[51:13] earth and heaven. Nothing else does he
[51:16] go back to except in verse 14.
[51:19] For if you forgive men their trespasses.
[51:21] The one part of the prayer that he comes
[51:23] back to after for thine is the kingdom
[51:26] and the power and the glory forever.
[51:28] Amen. And the church said amen. And
[51:30] Jesus says, "For if you forgive men
[51:32] their trespasses." In other words, going
[51:34] back to verse 12, "And forgive us our
[51:35] debts as we forgive our debtors." He
[51:37] wants to revisit this. It's so
[51:38] important. For if we forgive men their
[51:40] trespasses, your heavenly father will
[51:42] also forgive you. But if you forgive not
[51:45] men their trespasses, neither will your
[51:49] father forgive your trespasses.
[51:53] That Jesus is taking it a step further.
[51:55] And I I love how he goes back to
[51:57] emphasize this because he says, "Give us
[51:58] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[52:00] our debts as we have forgiven our
[52:02] debtors." And and it it's such a
[52:03] beautiful presumption or or condition
[52:06] proced maybe to use a phrase we've used
[52:08] recently to where he's assumed it before
[52:11] you ask.
[52:13] It it doesn't open with our father
[52:16] hallowed be thy name. I I'm forgive you
[52:19] know so and so for what they did to me
[52:21] and forgive them for this and forgive
[52:23] them for that and some sort of litany of
[52:24] all the the people who've offended you
[52:26] but he says it's almost assumed before
[52:28] you're you even would pray
[52:31] before you would even say our father
[52:33] which art in heaven you've already done
[52:35] this and so he revisits it if you
[52:37] forgive men their trespasses your father
[52:39] will also forgive you but if you do not
[52:41] forgive men of their trespasses neither
[52:43] will your trespasses be forgiven he
[52:45] takes it a step further we can only ask
[52:47] for our own forgiveness after we have
[52:51] forgiven others.
[52:54] We can only ask for him to forgive us
[52:57] when we have already before we ask
[53:01] forgiven others. Right?
[53:03] It's not even part of the prayer, but he
[53:05] revisits it so that we would understand
[53:07] this that we must when we ask for
[53:09] forgiveness and want God to have
[53:12] forgiveness towards us, we likewise must
[53:14] have forgiveness towards other people in
[53:17] order to receive what we expect from
[53:19] God. We ought to give to others,
[53:22] not what we expect from them, but what
[53:24] we expect from God in our situation.
[53:27] He says it this way in Luke 11:4, "And
[53:29] forgive us our sins, for we also forgive
[53:32] everyone that is indebted to us."
[53:35] Talk about a different kind of state of
[53:37] mind.
[53:38] Talk about putting the believer in the
[53:40] most awesome position to receive a
[53:43] promise of God. They are not going to
[53:46] remain subject to anyone else. They're
[53:49] not going to be somebody else's victim.
[53:51] They're not going to be weak. They're
[53:52] not going to be uh broken and and and at
[53:55] the whims of what the world would offer,
[53:56] but they put themselves in a position of
[53:59] who they are. As brother Bam says, if
[54:00] you're a believer, you must believe what
[54:01] you ask for. You're a believer,
[54:03] recognize yourself as a believer,
[54:04] recognize that these things are for you.
[54:06] It takes you out of that woe is me
[54:08] victim mentality to where you have the
[54:10] power to forgive somebody who's done
[54:13] something wrong to you. And therefore,
[54:15] from that position of forgiveness, we
[54:17] can say, "God, forgive me." and know
[54:19] that we're not holding something in our
[54:21] hearts against somebody else. Lord,
[54:23] forgive me for lying, but I'll never
[54:25] forgive you for your lie. Lord, forgive
[54:27] me for lying.
[54:32] In Mark chapter 11, I think these these
[54:34] scriptures really uh present it so
[54:38] clearly that we don't have to keep
[54:39] belaboring. I hope you're catching that
[54:42] this now we've t I have to recap it just
[54:45] to help make sure we're seeing this that
[54:47] the lack of your unconfessed sins, your
[54:50] sins, your unadressed iniquity, things
[54:52] that you've done wrong that you have not
[54:53] made right with God can cause you to
[54:56] either be sick or remain sick.
[54:58] recognize that that failure that failure
[55:00] to ask for forgiveness, the failure to
[55:02] say I'm sorry could it could either be
[55:05] sin that caused it
[55:07] and there's I don't maybe I don't know
[55:09] if maybe I have it I don't think I have
[55:11] it in these in these notes where brother
[55:13] re identifies sin that's been put on
[55:16] people because of their disobedience
[55:18] and so that's one part of it either this
[55:21] the sickness is directly tied to
[55:23] something you've done wrong and James is
[55:25] saying hey make it right and you'll be
[55:28] healed. Chronicles is saying make it
[55:30] right and you'll be healed. So there
[55:32] should be no fear in that and then it
[55:34] could be the unconfessed sin may not be
[55:37] related directly to the sickness but it
[55:38] becomes that that's keeping your faith
[55:41] from breaking through to receive your
[55:42] healing. So do you see then on those on
[55:45] those layers it's saying I'm sorry
[55:47] that's going to remove the barrier that
[55:49] crust that is in your heart that keeps
[55:51] you from receiving the healing you need
[55:53] in your body through the faith which
[55:55] resides in your soul. But now Jesus
[55:57] takes it the step further and says, "Not
[56:00] only must you say I'm sorry," but you
[56:03] also have to forgive
[56:05] people who may not even say I'm sorry.
[56:08] I'm sorry.
[56:10] But that's what he's saying.
[56:11] Markap 11 22- 26. I hope Thank you for
[56:15] bearing with me just to re reset that
[56:17] because this is again it's coming so
[56:20] perfectly clear in the scripture. This
[56:21] principle Jesus answering saith unto
[56:24] them, have faith in God. So this is all
[56:26] about our faith. For verily I say unto
[56:29] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[56:31] mountain, be thou removed and be thou
[56:33] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[56:34] in his heart, but shall believe those
[56:36] things which he shall which he saith
[56:38] shall come to pass, he shall have
[56:39] whatsoever he saith.
[56:43] That's powerful
[56:45] that a man who could speak to a mountain
[56:48] and have no doubt in his heart,
[56:50] his right mental attitude, he could
[56:52] speak and have need of it. We've been
[56:54] covering this in the Wednesday nights
[56:55] the motive and objective. So I think
[56:56] this is there's this harmony that we see
[56:58] here says he could have it. Now watch
[57:01] how he continues. Therefore I say unto
[57:03] you. So there's this connection. What
[57:05] thing what things soever ye desire when
[57:07] you pray believe that you receive them
[57:11] and you shall have them. So this is him
[57:13] maybe giving the general principle that
[57:16] he's elicited in verse 23. He led with
[57:18] verse 23 say well this is how powerful
[57:20] it is if you have faith in God that
[57:21] whatever you ask even if it's to ask for
[57:23] a mountain to be moved and not doubt in
[57:25] your heart you can have what you ask so
[57:26] now he's dropping whether you want to go
[57:28] up or back however you want to look at
[57:29] it this is maybe the more general
[57:30] principle that's connected with verse 23
[57:33] therefore what what you desire when you
[57:36] pray believe that you receive them and
[57:38] you shall have them that that's what
[57:40] verse 23 is referring to I mean so then
[57:43] that becomes kind of the examiner I mean
[57:45] how really desire for a mountain to walk
[57:48] into the ocean, right?
[57:50] Like, yeah, we want to see it, but do we
[57:51] really desire it? So, to me, it's very
[57:53] beautiful the way that next scripture
[57:55] acts with verse 23. Verse 25 is, and
[58:01] this is now again,
[58:03] part of verse 23, part of verse 24. And
[58:06] when you stand praying, forgive.
[58:10] This is, this is just the way that he's
[58:13] drawing it out. But I think it gets our
[58:14] attention this way that if I desire
[58:16] something I know now that when I pray I
[58:18] can believe that I receive it and I
[58:21] shall have it. And though if we could
[58:23] even say but if that gets our attention
[58:25] better but when you stand praying when
[58:27] you pray believing you must also in the
[58:30] standing you have before God to ask.
[58:33] It's in the same position with the same
[58:36] standing to ask. And I know this may be
[58:38] more of a legal phrase, but you know, if
[58:40] if if my neighbor backed into my car and
[58:44] and and and damaged my car, you couldn't
[58:46] sue him for it,
[58:48] right?
[58:48] Because you don't have standing,
[58:50] right?
[58:51] And so when we stand before God and we
[58:54] have standing to ask for something we
[58:56] desire, says when you stand praying,
[58:59] then in that position with that
[59:01] standing, do you also have standing to
[59:04] forgive somebody else?
[59:07] Now, you can forgive my neighbor for
[59:09] backing into my car, the neighbor next
[59:11] in the apartment next door. It's a
[59:13] hypothetical. And you could you could
[59:15] forgive them, but were you really do you
[59:17] really have standing to forgive him?
[59:20] I mean, I really like brother Aaron and
[59:22] I really liked his car and this is just
[59:23] not fair to me. Okay. All right. Forgive
[59:26] them for whatever level that there's
[59:27] this offense, but I would be the one
[59:29] that would have the standing to forgive
[59:31] somebody who has done something to me.
[59:33] That's right. So he says in when you
[59:35] stand praying forgive here if you have
[59:39] ought against any. I want to come back
[59:41] to that phrase if you have ought against
[59:43] any that
[59:45] your father also which is in heaven may
[59:47] forgive you your trespasses.
[59:50] But if you do not forgive neither will
[59:52] your father which is in heaven forgive
[59:53] your trespasses.
[59:56] This is all connected with praying. And
[59:57] when we pray we ask. It's in the when he
[59:59] teaches us to pray in Matthew chapter 6.
[1:00:02] It's replete through all these
[1:00:03] scriptures. The message of the hour is
[1:00:04] touching on it, too. That when we pray,
[1:00:06] we must ask for forgiveness. And when
[1:00:08] you ask for forgiveness, don't think
[1:00:10] you're going to get it if you're not
[1:00:11] willing to forgive others.
[1:00:14] I can't remember which translation this
[1:00:15] is in, but it says, "If you have
[1:00:17] anything against anyone," and that's
[1:00:19] exactly what that phrase means. If you
[1:00:21] have anything against anyone, forgive
[1:00:22] him and let it drop.
[1:00:25] Leave it. Let it go. in order that your
[1:00:29] father who is in heaven may also forgive
[1:00:31] you your own failings and shortcomings
[1:00:33] and let them drop.
[1:00:36] You have in your hand all your offenses
[1:00:41] that you have that have been built up
[1:00:43] against you and everything somebody's
[1:00:44] done against you. And then you go to the
[1:00:46] Lord and you say, "Lord, please forgive
[1:00:48] me for my sins." And he's willing in
[1:00:51] that moment to let it drop if you will.
[1:00:55] That's good.
[1:00:56] Just let it go.
[1:00:56] Amen.
[1:00:57] Drop it. Let it go. Move on. But think
[1:01:00] of how hard that is.
[1:01:01] Think how hard it is sometimes just to
[1:01:03] move on, to let it go, just to drop it.
[1:01:04] But the scripture is speaking directly
[1:01:06] to it.
[1:01:08] Amen.
[1:01:08] So, not only must we ask for
[1:01:10] forgiveness, but we have to forgive
[1:01:12] others for our own healing.
[1:01:14] That's exactly the way I'm wanting to uh
[1:01:16] express this to you. We have to ask
[1:01:18] others for forgiveness for our own
[1:01:19] healing. And the sermon church in its
[1:01:21] condition, Brother Bam says, there's
[1:01:23] something wrong when you can't bear with
[1:01:24] one another. When you can't forgive
[1:01:27] every person from the very depths of
[1:01:30] your heart, no matter what they've done
[1:01:32] or what they've said,
[1:01:34] if you can't forgive them from the
[1:01:36] depths, Jesus said, "If you don't
[1:01:38] forgive every man his trespasses from
[1:01:40] your heart, neither does your heavenly
[1:01:43] father forgive you."
[1:01:46] This isn't uh just the yeah, I'm sorry,
[1:01:50] right? Just kind of the the shallow
[1:01:52] surfacy. I'm sorry. There's something
[1:01:54] wrong if you can't bear with one
[1:01:56] another. When you can't forgive every
[1:01:58] person from the very depths of your
[1:02:01] heart, no matter what they've done or
[1:02:04] what they've said, if you can't forgive
[1:02:06] them from the depths,
[1:02:10] if it can't be really heartfelt, if it
[1:02:11] can't be sincere, if you can't truly let
[1:02:14] it go and let it drop, he says, "If you
[1:02:16] don't forgive every man his trespasses
[1:02:18] from your heart, neither does your
[1:02:19] heavenly father forgive you." This is
[1:02:21] exactly what we've been reading in the
[1:02:22] scriptures that he's saying if you want
[1:02:24] to ask me for forgiveness, which we're
[1:02:26] recognizing is a precondition to our
[1:02:28] healing. He's saying you must also be
[1:02:30] willing to forgive others. What I'm
[1:02:31] wanting to recognize, what you recognize
[1:02:33] today is that for some of us, I'm not
[1:02:36] saying this is absolutely true, but
[1:02:37] could it be that the fact that we're
[1:02:40] holding on to things so bitterly is the
[1:02:43] reason why we can't be healed? Sure.
[1:02:47] In Luke 6:37, it says, "Judge not, you
[1:02:49] shall not be judged. Condemn not, and
[1:02:51] you shall not be condemned. Forgive and
[1:02:52] you shall be forgiven."
[1:02:55] Connects our judgment with our
[1:02:56] forgiveness. That we if we judge not. If
[1:02:59] we're withholding judgment, then
[1:03:00] obviously we're not judging ourselves by
[1:03:02] the same measure. Condemn not, you shall
[1:03:04] not be condemned. There's such
[1:03:05] principles elicited in that that are
[1:03:07] beautiful. And he says, "Forgive
[1:03:09] and you shall be forgiven."
[1:03:12] It's it's a
[1:03:15] a reference
[1:03:18] to our attitudes and to our spirits that
[1:03:20] if we want to be forgiven, we must also
[1:03:22] forgive.
[1:03:24] The forgiveness that I'm talking about
[1:03:26] today is not only for our own sins, for
[1:03:28] our healing, but to forgive others for
[1:03:30] our healing.
[1:03:32] Brother man makes this statement. He
[1:03:34] says, "If someone talks about you and
[1:03:35] you talk back about them, God can't
[1:03:38] fight your battle."
[1:03:40] Yeah.
[1:03:41] You're fighting it yourself.
[1:03:45] I remember I was going through a certain
[1:03:46] situation one time and and I received
[1:03:49] some advice from a pastor and he's like,
[1:03:50] "Well, you got to get your story out.
[1:03:53] You got to get you got to get your story
[1:03:54] out." And and he said, "You remember
[1:03:56] what do you remember why Michael Dukakus
[1:03:58] lost the election?" I'm like, "Well, no,
[1:04:00] not really." But he says, "Cuz he didn't
[1:04:02] get his story out. the shortboat
[1:04:04] veterans or whatever did some kind of
[1:04:06] campaign against him and he just
[1:04:08] maintained his integrity and didn't
[1:04:10] weigh into the issue and was like this
[1:04:12] is so crazy to even respond to it would
[1:04:14] give credence to my accusers and the
[1:04:17] advice was you got to get your story out
[1:04:19] you got to respond you got to fight back
[1:04:21] and my heart I was like no I want the
[1:04:23] Lord to fight my battle
[1:04:25] and he can as long as I'm fighting it
[1:04:28] and think of this if someone talks about
[1:04:29] you and you talk back about them God
[1:04:33] cannot fight your battle. You're
[1:04:36] fighting it yourself.
[1:04:39] Just let loose and let him do it and
[1:04:42] just commit it to him.
[1:04:46] God can't fight your battle. You're
[1:04:48] fighting it yourself.
[1:04:50] Just let loose and let him do it and
[1:04:52] just commit it to him.
[1:04:53] You know what it's going to take to do
[1:04:54] that? Forgiveness.
[1:04:59] Markap 11 verse 25.
[1:05:07] I think I'll just I'm going to stop on
[1:05:08] this these verses here and then we'll uh
[1:05:14] uh we'll pick up. Maybe I'll just pick
[1:05:15] up on on Wednesday night. We will we
[1:05:17] will all come back for Wednesday night.
[1:05:20] I heard you.
[1:05:22] Markap 11:25 it says, "And when you
[1:05:24] stand praying, forgive."
[1:05:27] If you have ought against any,
[1:05:30] forgive.
[1:05:31] If you have ought against any, if you
[1:05:34] have anything against anyone,
[1:05:38] in other words, if there's something
[1:05:39] that you believe they should say they're
[1:05:41] sorry for, something that they should
[1:05:42] make right, without them coming to you
[1:05:45] and saying, "Hey, I'm sorry for backing
[1:05:47] into your car." He's saying that you
[1:05:49] ought to forgive them. If you have
[1:05:51] anything against anyone,
[1:05:55] he says if you forgive them,
[1:05:59] that your father which is in heaven may
[1:06:01] forgive you your trespasses.
[1:06:05] Because he says forgiveness of
[1:06:07] trespasses, it then it's putting in some
[1:06:10] level to where I I guess I could say it
[1:06:11] this way. If you're irrational and
[1:06:13] hyperritical and unreasonable and
[1:06:16] misjudge somebody, you should you should
[1:06:18] forgive. You should make you should say
[1:06:20] you're not necessarily go to them and
[1:06:21] say you're sorry. Those are those are
[1:06:23] kind of the weird backhanded apologies,
[1:06:25] right? Where it says, "You don't know
[1:06:27] me, but I always thought you were a jerk
[1:06:28] and I just want to apologize." You're
[1:06:30] like,
[1:06:32] "You definitely got the wrong number."
[1:06:34] Right? Like there there's no point in
[1:06:36] that there. Where was the offense? you
[1:06:38] know, and and maybe that's my way of
[1:06:39] telling you, hey, if you thought
[1:06:40] something about me and I didn't know it,
[1:06:42] let's just keep it that way.
[1:06:45] But there's a way that you would make
[1:06:47] that right. Lord, forgive me. I
[1:06:48] shouldn't have said that about this
[1:06:49] brother. And Lord, this was I shouldn't
[1:06:51] have had this thought or shouldn't have
[1:06:52] felt that way. And so maybe there's a
[1:06:54] way that you could apply this to even
[1:06:56] our own misjudgments and our our own
[1:06:58] private musings, but it's referring to
[1:07:01] you've been hurt.
[1:07:03] Somebody has done something to genuinely
[1:07:06] and not unreasonably necessarily offend
[1:07:08] you or they have transgressed as the
[1:07:11] scripture says trespassed against you.
[1:07:12] If I could put this way, you have been
[1:07:14] victimized.
[1:07:16] You have been agrieved. You have been
[1:07:17] hurt. You have been offended. And what's
[1:07:20] amazing is Jesus is acknowledging that
[1:07:23] you've been trespassed against. You who
[1:07:26] have been abused. You who've been
[1:07:28] victimized. You who've been lied about.
[1:07:29] You who have been cast out. You that
[1:07:31] have been rejected. you that have been
[1:07:32] hurt, you that are victimized and
[1:07:34] agrieved and offended. He's asking you
[1:07:36] to do something that is against your
[1:07:38] natural instinct,
[1:07:40] right?
[1:07:41] Asking you to do something that is not
[1:07:42] the first thing you think of whenever
[1:07:44] somebody punches you in the face. I
[1:07:46] forgive you. It's not something that's
[1:07:48] easy to do. Usually, we want to ball our
[1:07:50] fist up and say, "Oh, yeah. You want to
[1:07:51] go? Let's do this." So, this the the
[1:07:54] instinct is to not it works against the
[1:07:57] person who's hurt it work. This is not
[1:07:59] how a person who's offended is
[1:08:01] instinctively acting. What we usually do
[1:08:04] is we try to preserve ourselves. Self-p
[1:08:06] protection, do something to protect
[1:08:08] ourselves, to preserve ourselves, uh uh
[1:08:10] to maintain our our our our reputation
[1:08:13] or to do something to defend ourselves.
[1:08:15] Maybe we just seek to be vindicated or
[1:08:16] we want justice.
[1:08:18] There's a lot of other typical responses
[1:08:20] that people have in this scenario and
[1:08:22] it's usually not through humility to
[1:08:24] say, you know what, I'm it's okay. I
[1:08:26] forgive you.
[1:08:29] To forgive, it means to give or to
[1:08:31] grant. To allow,
[1:08:34] to forgive, it's to give. To grant, to
[1:08:36] allow, to, we say, remit a debt or
[1:08:38] pardon an offense. And so, it means to
[1:08:41] give up in the sense that you give up
[1:08:44] your desire or power to punish.
[1:08:48] Now, this is it enters into a very
[1:08:50] interesting conversation about uh the
[1:08:52] differences among a pardon and
[1:08:53] justification, excuses. But the
[1:08:56] government can pardon
[1:08:58] a criminal even though the government is
[1:09:01] not the victim of a crime. So someone
[1:09:04] could commit a crime against a person.
[1:09:05] They could be found guilty of assault.
[1:09:07] Then the governor can pardon the
[1:09:09] offender. Uh and that means that the
[1:09:11] government has let go of its power to
[1:09:14] punish.
[1:09:16] So the government can have standing to
[1:09:18] pardon. Now we in a legal sense may not
[1:09:20] have power to pardon. But when we have
[1:09:22] been offended, we have standing to even
[1:09:25] let go
[1:09:27] of the hurt.
[1:09:30] Because forgiveness is the deliberate
[1:09:32] and conscious letting go of resentment,
[1:09:36] revenge,
[1:09:38] bitterness. That's what forgiveness is.
[1:09:40] It's the con. It's the deliberate I am
[1:09:43] going to let it go.
[1:09:45] Have any of you ever done that?
[1:09:47] Can anybody testify in your lives where
[1:09:50] there's been genuine real hurts and you
[1:09:53] no matter how much it ate at you, you
[1:09:55] just said, "I'm going to let it go.
[1:09:57] Just going to let it go."
[1:10:01] Now, I think one of the things that
[1:10:03] makes us anxious about forgiveness is
[1:10:05] what we think it is when it's not.
[1:10:07] Forgiveness is never condoning what a
[1:10:09] person's done. When you forgive
[1:10:10] somebody, there's no approval. There's
[1:10:12] no You're not condoning it. There's no
[1:10:15] excuse. Forgiveness does not require
[1:10:17] reconciliation.
[1:10:19] If you forgive somebody, that doesn't
[1:10:21] mean you have to invite them back into
[1:10:22] the same standing or position they were
[1:10:24] in before the offense. To to forgive is
[1:10:26] doesn't mean you have to forget it.
[1:10:29] Right? You can genuinely forgive without
[1:10:32] reconciliation. You can genuinely
[1:10:33] forgive even though you remember I take
[1:10:35] exception to the statement that uh to I
[1:10:38] I think says to offend or to to sin is
[1:10:40] uh human, to forgive is divine, but I'd
[1:10:42] actually say to forgive is human. to
[1:10:44] forget is divine
[1:10:46] because it's God that forgets our
[1:10:47] trespasses and all our sins are cast
[1:10:49] behind his back. So what we the only
[1:10:51] thing we can to do as a human is make a
[1:10:53] deliberate conscious letting go of the
[1:10:56] offense.
[1:10:58] So what's the opposite of that then?
[1:11:00] What's the opposite of forgiveness?
[1:11:01] Holding on to it.
[1:11:04] And when we hold on to it and we take
[1:11:06] that and we receive it, it becomes
[1:11:08] resentment, becomes bitterness. Maybe we
[1:11:11] have thoughts of revenge. We hold what
[1:11:12] does it says? We hold grudges.
[1:11:22] And this unforgiveness
[1:11:27] can become a terrible disease
[1:11:30] that'll corrupt our emotions and even
[1:11:33] sicken our bodies.
[1:11:36] I'll pick up on this whether we do it
[1:11:39] next Sunday or we'll do it
[1:11:42] um Wednesday night,
[1:11:50] but let's bow our heads.
[1:11:55] I just feel in my heart, even though I
[1:11:57] think I'm not even halfway done on this,
[1:12:00] I feel just to stop here
[1:12:05] because I think it it would be important
[1:12:10] with the word at this at this moment, at
[1:12:13] this juncture of this service where we
[1:12:17] are now, if I could say, uncovering,
[1:12:20] coming to that real heart
[1:12:24] of that. Jesus says, "If we have ought
[1:12:26] against any, we should forgive them."
[1:12:30] And I know this is not easy,
[1:12:34] but I would I would say that we ought to
[1:12:37] be able to as believers today
[1:12:40] say, "I forgive.
[1:12:45] I'm not excusing.
[1:12:48] I'm not justifying.
[1:12:50] I'm not even pardoning because it's not
[1:12:52] your power to pardon.
[1:12:56] But you can forgive
[1:13:01] something you may not have considered.
[1:13:02] But when somebody has done some harm to
[1:13:05] you,
[1:13:07] you could remove yourself far from the
[1:13:10] offender.
[1:13:11] For some of us, even our offender may be
[1:13:13] passed. Maybe maybe they've died.
[1:13:17] But as long as you hold unforgiveness in
[1:13:19] your heart, the offender still has power
[1:13:21] over you on some level.
[1:13:25] And if you've ever done it before and
[1:13:28] you know what it's like, I'm asking you
[1:13:30] today to just let it go.
[1:13:35] Let it drop.
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:43] When we think about what he's done for
[1:13:46] us,
[1:13:50] doesn't that make it a little bit easier
[1:13:52] for you to do to somebody else
[1:13:55] what he's done for you?
[1:13:59] That's my prayer today. I know it's just
[1:14:00] maybe a little bit of a sober ending,
[1:14:03] but I just implore you as your friend
[1:14:05] and as your brother, as your pastor,
[1:14:08] where there's hurt, where there's
[1:14:09] offenses, where there's been wrong,
[1:14:13] find it in your heart, search your heart
[1:14:15] today to say, "Lord, I forgive them
[1:14:19] for what they've done."
[1:14:25] In Luke 23:34, Jesus is on the cross
[1:14:32] and he's he's hanging on the cross. He's
[1:14:33] been crucified as an innocent man.
[1:14:37] His blood is letting out. Life will soon
[1:14:39] depart from him. He cries out, "Father,
[1:14:42] forgive them
[1:14:44] for they know not what to do."
[1:14:50] Their guilt was clear. Their actions
[1:14:52] were clear. His innocence was clear.
[1:14:56] If there ever was one that could argue
[1:14:59] an unjustified penalty and punishment,
[1:15:01] it would be Christ. But still, he
[1:15:03] pleaded, "Forgive them."
[1:15:06] Can you think about it for a moment? I
[1:15:08] know your head's been bowed for some
[1:15:10] time, but could you think about it? At
[1:15:12] the very moment that your salvation is
[1:15:14] being purchased.
[1:15:17] At the very moment that the stripes for
[1:15:19] your healing are bleeding out, he
[1:15:22] forgave.
[1:15:25] We look at the picture of the cross and
[1:15:27] we see our savior dying. We see his body
[1:15:29] broken though no bone was broken. We see
[1:15:32] his body rent. We see that his life is
[1:15:35] leaving him. He's been nailed to a
[1:15:37] cross, a crown of thorns placed upon his
[1:15:39] head. He's been beaten. He's almost
[1:15:41] unrecognizable. He's been his passion
[1:15:44] has brought him to this place of total
[1:15:46] physical abuse and crucifixion. He's
[1:15:49] going to die. And we recognize there's
[1:15:52] the lamb of God whose blood is shed for
[1:15:55] the salvation of my soul. There's the
[1:15:57] lamb of God who's been striped for my
[1:16:00] healing, bruised for my iniquities. He's
[1:16:03] and by his the chastisement of our peace
[1:16:06] is placed upon him. that in the very
[1:16:08] moment that our forgiveness is being
[1:16:11] accomplished, he could look out and he
[1:16:14] could say, "I forgive the one who's
[1:16:17] crucified me."
[1:16:20] Father, forgive them for they know not
[1:16:22] what they do.
[1:16:24] They say our healing is connected with
[1:16:26] forgiveness.
[1:16:29] And maybe we need to say, "Lord, I
[1:16:31] forgive. I forgive those who've offended
[1:16:34] me. I forgive those who've talked bad
[1:16:36] about me. I forgive those who've done
[1:16:37] this. I forgive them. Listen, that's all
[1:16:40] it is. It doesn't mean, well, does that
[1:16:42] mean I have to start doing this? Doesn't
[1:16:43] No, it just means you let go of that
[1:16:46] part that you've been holding in your
[1:16:47] heart
[1:16:49] and say, I let it go.
[1:16:51] And if you could do that, then you can
[1:16:52] say, Lord, I'm sorry for what I've done.
[1:16:57] Say, I'm sorry, Lord. I haven't I've
[1:16:59] been holding these things in my heart. I
[1:17:01] forgive them. Lord, will you forgive me?
[1:17:06] And I believe God can do something for
[1:17:08] you.
