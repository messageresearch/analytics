TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the announcement i'd like to make uh i'd like to preface it first by saying it's been a while since we kind of had a business meeting or discussed things related to our facilities our where we're meeting and what our future might look like and several months ago we had a meeting in this very room in which we discussed kind of our vision in terms of where we meet a church facility a worship facility and we broke it up into three visions or goals we have an interim short term and a long term and interim is this what we've been doing pop-up scenario where your shared space or you're having to set up and tear down something that you don't want to do long term but it's fitting meeting a need in the interim and then our short-term goal was to find something that we could call our own we could park our stuff brother john could get his truck back and um and free them up a few hours of each one of their wednesdays and sundays and a place that we could call our own and even if it was just a year to three years it was kind of a short-term rental scenario that we uh and it's a place that we could actually maybe print out something that says this is our address and make an announcement that we're here because right now it's still just kind of been in this interim phase and then obviously i believe this is obvious our long-term desire is to purchase a facility or even build something and many of you have been very gracious and giving to a building fund and all the monies that are given to the building fund are designated for our long-term vision to have a place that we could call our own that we could grow into in the future and that it would be something that's solely ours and on this past thursday well uh well for 19 months we've been doing that for 19 months we've been in this interim phase and we've been renting uh hotel space and for the hilton here which has been over a year i think it's maybe been close to 14 months it's been a it's been a good home and the hilton guardian has been very good to us and we've appreciated everything they've extended to us and despite some bumps in the road and some difficulties and some surprises it's been it's been nice to be here this past thursday about 11 o'clock in the morning i received an email and informing us that they're increasing our rent four times and so we've been paying around three thousand dollars a month uh in rent and they said if we want to keep this place um with any kind of certainty then there we have to pay 12 000 a month and so i'm just asking if anybody here would be willing to and so everything changed and so if you'll just listen listen instead of maybe letting your minds run wild with this i'm not announcing this is our last service but i am announcing that this may very well be our last service in this building and in this facility and not to get everyone to get weepier or nostalgic it's been it's been wonderful being here and some of the testimonies that we received from not ones that have visited even ministers that have ministered here is like you have you have no awareness at all that you're in a hotel you're in a church um even one brother said when he ministered here when he stepped in he walked in the sanctuary it took his breath away he said because when we stream your services all we see is you in a little box and he says we think that's all it is i think some of my friends think i'm just playing church and uh and he said but you walk in and it's a gigantic banquet hall and every seat is full and he said it took his breath away and the atmosphere and the presence and that's a credit to you uh not the hilton and so it's been wonderful being here but this very well may be our very last service we only have an agreement and a contract through wednesday night but that said thursday i'd say thursday everything changed and immediately um i was probably in the flesh and more panicky than in the spirit believing that everything would be okay but god immediately began to work and to maybe keep the announcement somewhat brief we may have already found a new place to worship it's just less than five miles away from here it's a wonderful location it's even an area that has come up frequently over the last year when we've been looking for a place that we could either buy or rent and it's a place that we could call our own but it still would be short term it would be different than this and there'd be some changes but it's very it's a very real possibility um that wednesday night if possible we may be gathering there to have service um at the very least i'm not really interested in paying 15 1500 for next sunday service here but we will have church god god's people will make a way we're taught in the word of god that life makes a way uh we were doing a hike here in sedona a little trip in sedona we were looking at this wall this just a giant wall of rock and then in the middle you know 100 feet up and and 200 feet from the top just growing out of the side of it as a cactus it's like life makes a way it's gonna make a way and i believe that there's life here and that regardless of what circumstances we're facing and if it seems to be that something happens and we have to get very unique where we gather if we if we happen to miss a service nobody should panic we are a church god will give us a place to worship and so be in prayer because it i feel very encouraged that the deacons and trustees met yesterday um and looked at the facility and it was a resounding yes from those who saw it and so we're just right now it's just a matter of formalizing it and it's a it's another church that would be renting to us a facility that they own but it's it's vacant it's ready for a church to move into it and um they've been kind enough to say you know even if you guys just want to try it out i'm sure we can work something out so it looks like it's a very real possibility so keep it in prayer and stay tuned subscribe to the channel is it mash the subscribe button or whatever turn on notifications because you may need to know where we're going to church wednesday if you want to be in church and so regardless if we're meeting here one last time be reaching out call if you don't know where we're having service if you haven't heard call somebody reach out to me do something to find out because i don't believe we'll be here next sunday and by god's grace by god's grace we'll all just be at that meeting in the air and we've already got that in our gps right amen god bless you let's stand together if you turn in your bibles to second corinthians chapter 3 verses 1 to 18 it is the entire chapter i realize already time is getting away from me but i want to read the entire chapter because i hope to and even though it might get kind of pushed off a little bit and like for this to be in our thoughts because i'd like to come back to a few verses here and bear this in mind paul as he goes through this first part focus very uh intently on you being a written epistle and then the ministry of the glory of the lord and how that paul is talking about a new covenant or a new testament do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us they the people who have received the message from paul are the the the book of christ the epistle of christ that he ministered written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart very important to hold that in mind and in your hearts because it's kind of more of a what i'm looking at in terms of my vision in this these services in such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and relate that back to verse three where is the spirit of the living god it is writing the word in the hearts of of the people verse 7 but if the menstruation of death ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not steadfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious but the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceeding glory remember what these prior verses are saying and so who is he talking about what is he referring to what depth is there in this for even that which hath made was made glorious has had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious sin then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a veil over his face the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end at that which is abolished but their minds are blinded for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord what a beautiful beautiful chapter god bless you you can be seated i feel that that just reads in itself a sermon an outline of of this thought that i'm considering on i am an open book the i am is god himself it is the absolute one who is indivisible uh there's nothing that can compare to him incomparable and he is the one that caused all things to be or to exist and when we are taking the i am and putting him in view what we're wanting to do is to consider the nature of god and how this i am makes himself known or how he manifests himself because he's he's not uh he's not man that we could know him through human discipline he's not man that we could know him just by meeting him he's transcendent uh beyond humanity and he's something that is hidden so there's uh this is the that's what we're looking at is the i am so when we step take a step forward into an open book we're looking at something that in that terminology something easily interpreted readily examined something that can be thoroughly understood or easily understood and we're wanting god to be made known to us we want to understand him we want to know him so i am an open book something that he is to us and a closed book is we were looking at paul saying we look through a glass darkly it means there's a mystery there he says but then face to face and as he mentioned here in our text one day as he's we're beholding him with open face there's this mystery being removed there's something that we're knowing and understanding something being declared to us it made known he's alluding to a closed book versus an open book and that that closed book is something difficult to know something difficult to understand a puzzle an enigma and those are just some keys key things from the prior two services i wanted to bring back in there so now when we step forward from the i am jesus said in john chapter 8 verse 58 verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am so jesus christ was and is the manifestation of the i am so that enigma that puzzle that closed book he's saying when you've seen me you have seen the father there is a the hidden mystery of god is being made known in jesus christ that's why i say christ is the mystery of god revealed god hiding himself god being mysterious god being invisible now when you've seen me you've seen the father this invisible god now made tangible now made flesh now appearing uh before his uh his elect or chosen ones and he said i am the manifestation of god in flesh and what we wanted to identify is it was not just god's appearing with his people or a glimpse of god so it wasn't just elohim appearing it just wasn't god appearing to his people as he had done through the prophets and through supernatural signs and wonders but this was his coming this was his presence with those that he said he would make himself known to and it was all foreshadowed and spoken of before him brother brahman said it this way he was the perfect identical image of the promise and the masterpiece he was the perfect identical image of the promise therefore all promises the old testament was met in jesus christ quite a phrase all promises of the old testament met in jesus christ again you can say oh well does that mean there's no prophecies or promises left in the old testament to be fulfilled no there are other ones that are to be fulfilled but the point is what was the emphasis what was the mystery what was the goal what was what need what did the old testament point to the old testament alone just wasn't pointing to maybe some of these uh other things but there was this process that had to unfold and if the old testament has a promise of a millennium you can never come to the millennium until you came to the promise of the redeemer the messiah so he's saying it just it fulfills all the promise the old testament it's met in jesus christ because the millennium is what this christ will bring it's what comes from him so it's all central to him so jesus when he's on earth and he's uh he's ministering he takes he he challenges them in john chapter 5 verse 39 he says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me very remarkable statement search the scriptures he gives that credence to the written word of god search the scriptures but then he points to also the living word of god and how just to take the letter alone it can leave you in balance so he lifts up the written word but then he says you have to identify where the written word is being made flesh and this is a challenge you could make to people who are very ardent believers in the bible and say if the bible is true show me where it's being lived out does the bible say that he'll give unto you uh pastors and evangelists and teachers if the bible say that there's to be that you're to take the feet wash defeat washing and take communion if these are promises in the word of god where is it being lived out where is it being manifested where is it being expressed and and so there says he's saying look into the scriptures because they testified they were a testament and a testimony of me so here i am they were all saying i'm coming and now here i am and it works to where he's saying i'm here now look and see if i don't fulfill exactly what it said i would be and then it says in psalm 40 verse 7 speaking of christ then said i lo i come in the i come so here i come and in the volume of the book it is written of me to what i delight to do thy will oh my god yay thy law is within my heart this is the the utterance psalm 40 verses 7 and 8 this utterance of i come and my delight is to do thy will o god thy law is written in my heart and we read last time i'm going to declare i'm going to speak i'm going to manifest this is what's in my heart to do and he's saying this is written in the volume of the book the volume of the book the book it was written of me that i will come to do thy will and in the volume of the book it's this image of a scroll something i come in the the role of the book in the uh the pentateuch the those the when they said the book it was moses's writings when he said to this day when moses has read it's referring to those first five books of the bible to them that was their book the remaining remainder of the old testament was still being compiled still being put together but they had this law that god had vindicated by his presence this law that he had vindicated by a pillar of fire this law that he had vindicated by his uh by signs and wonders he's saying i it's written of me in the volume of the book the the everything in genesis and and these preceding books they speak of me and so the coming of christ was prophesied and written in the volume the role the scroll of the law and and we identified how that and we'll come to it here in a moment how that when when he came now in a spiritual sense when he came he opened the book the volume of the book was being opened up and therefore while it's being manifested we use this language light is shining on the word how is light shining on the word not not to read it but it's giving understanding enlightenment oh that's what that meant and and i have it in my heart to maybe take time to do this but when you read especially i think it's in the book of matthew that it says jesus did this that it might be fulfilled as it's written by the prophets and that this has been fulfilled and then you go back and you read the original prophecy and you go well i would have never guessed that's what it would be right because light's now shining on the word and this is what it meant this is what it referred to when it happened and so there's that's what the light is shining it's a living reality it's manifested and so is he saying in psalm 40 the word is into him it's not hid it's being expressed it's been declared it's not being concealed once he comes the volume of the book is now opened up and it's the open of the book it's not concealed i have declared i have not hid this word that is in me it's now being expressed and this statement we had ready for last week but we didn't we didn't read it to you but this is very this summarizes very well last sunday and i i do feel today there's a tremendous amount of overlap to last week but it's done just to uh to be able to take just another half step perhaps he was the word made light or became light the word in that generation he was the word light of that generation because the prophets of old had spoke of him and here he come and vindicated he was the light of god's spoken word all the prophets had said had been fulfilled in him see the prophets back here in the word like god was at the beginning when he said let there be light and light came now the prophet said a virgin shall conceive bring forth the son they shall call his name emmanuel for it'll be god with us now to to israel even to this day and i don't know if it's kind of a counter belief to the prevalence of christianity and the point into this scripture they wouldn't necessarily construct that verse to be a prophecy of a messiah born of a virgin but that's what it was so when it happened it is uh it light is shining on it he said now they spoke it the word had went out but he was the light the word goes out but he's like he's the manifestation what was he and i guess i could just keep reading instead of adding my side notes here what was he the fulfillment hallelujah he was the fulfillment of that word he was the manifestation of that word the word goes out so the word can go i've got the word i've got the word but then there is a manifestation of that word a fulfillment of that word it says now in all ages god has set forth so much of his word for each age important to recognize this dispensations a giving out of promises that relate to this age to this age to this person to this time god always sends somebody that that word can get into and show the light of it say that's me claim it you not me you that's you that every age that does the same thing always does it he was the fulfillment as i said of all the divine holy powers of the prophets old testament prophets he's the fulfillment of it they were looking to this time of the messiah they were looking to that time that he would come they were minor gods when the word of lord came to a man jesus said himself that he was a god you know that he said if your law said and your father's back there called them who the word of god come to call them gods how can you condemn me saying when i said i am the son of god when the very god himself we spoke the word through the prophets he was the very he was the manifestation of that spoken word and if the prophet was called to god because he was the manifestation of another prophet's word notice that language how can you condemn him when he was the same thing he was the son of god as he shall be called the son of god he was the long-promised messiah that the world had waited on he was the messiah's promise made manifest the old testament standing before the embodiment of their scroll the mystery of that scroll made known to them the mystery of the law the mystery of the prophecies of the old testament are standing there and i'm wanting you to look at it in the sense of and maybe i'm using a language i think that should open up other things to see it in this terminology not to try to force it into this terminology but using this to emphasize a truth something had been hid covered up unknown mysterious the veil is being taken away it's it's being removed as christ stands there and he's making himself known and he's manifest himself he said behold the one that god said would come behold the seat of the woman from genesis 3 15 behold the son of god that adam should have brought forth behold the one that was to be the the continuation of the image of god here he is standing there it's a book being opened as we read in luke chapter 4 verses 17 to 21 as he comes to the temple as was his custom it says and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book notice this beautiful symbolism this imagery as he comes to his ministry after his baptism and he comes to his ministry he comes to the temple and luke is describing one of these first acts of of christ and what is it it's to go and take a scroll the old testament the word the book of isaiah and which he's even symbolic of even the entire bible with its 66 chapters he takes it what and unfolds it and he's opening it up and he says and he found the place where it was written what of him he finds the place it was written so he opens the book finds himself in the word of god and we'll skip to verse 20 and after he recites the prophecy pertaining to himself he gets right up to in the middle of a verse that that's there's not light shining on that yet and what does he do he closes the book because the entire bible isn't the entire bible is going to be a mystery there's still another part that needs to be written there's still another part that needs to unfold so he closes it back up and he says in verse 20 and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasted on him the opening of the book got their attention and he began to say to them this day this scripture is this scripture fulfilled in your ears maybe that's a good sermon to go listen to to refresh our rehearse in our ears and refresh ourselves of this day is this scripture fulfilled in our ears what what what scriptures are being fulfilled he says it's fulfilled manifested he's there now he's going to begin his ministry he's going to go forth and and do these works in the fulfillment of the old testament and so in opening the book he's unfolding that scroll became a manifested reality of the promise now i'm just using the scripture maybe in in symbolism that when he closed the book you could there's this what i've emphasized to this point is that there's still more that was coming that need to be manifested but he takes the scroll and as he unfolds and he reads he reads so far and then what does he do he scrolls it back up because even though light is shining on the word and it's made manifest you can't recognize the manifestation without revelation it just won't dawn on you it could be staring you in the face and unless god reveals it to you light shining on the word isn't going to quicken you unless revelation comes and stimulates you so in that way when you close the book it's symbolic of the fact that all eyes are fastened on him they're looking at the very manifestation of the word of god and he closes the book saying that unless god opens your eyes you'll never see me so there's still a rep it needed a revelation to see the manifestation and brother adam says and what shall i do with jesus called christ when jesus come as the anointed messiah and done just exactly what the word of god said he would do and yet the jews were looking for something else a king coming with a rod of iron in his hand which was way in the future but he fulfilled every word there one day in capernaum when he picked up the scriptures and read did you notice he just read part of that scripture and then he laid the book down and said today this is fulfilled the anointed messiah the word of god made manifest he fulfilled every word and yet the jews were looking for something else and you know i know everyone here is faithful to listen to the word of god and to study the word of god you've heard this rehearsed over and over again how they were looking for something else looking for something else looking right over it had different expectations different ideas and god's grace even though they're looking for something totally different he comes and he tries to get their attention with the scriptural signs and wonders to try to catch that that election to have their eyes open to try to catch them he says today this is fulfilled in acts chapter 3 verses 22 to 26 and if i could say this to kind of help you to understand what i'm pondering is how that it's this old testament that christ embodies and that's all that they would have had they had the book of isaiah they didn't have second thessalonians right you couldn't deliver you couldn't deliver to christ um the writings of john you couldn't deliver them the writings of paul you couldn't deliver the writings of mark he had to he's delivered the book that had been written the scroll that had been rolled up he's it's being delivered to him so in acts chapter 3 verse 22 for moses truly said unto the fathers mr speaking of jesus christ a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brother and like unto me him shall you hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and just the pride verse saying the heavens have received this christ this one that was promised to come so that he he substantiates it takes a step further and substantiates it that the ones that the heavens have received this jesus christ this is the one that moses had said a prophet uh like unto me and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people and then he says yea and all the prophets from samuel and those after that as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days and he's using using samuel and all that follow after that because samuel is the first one that god uses after the order of the prophets so much that could be said here but he he comes in as the prophet so you have the book of the law then you have the prophets and and all of their writings so it's a way of taking everything prior to christ all the way to malachi says he says all the prophets from samuel those that follow as many as as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days what days the days of christ the days of the messiah and he says ye are the children of the prophets now catch the language here because we're coming into covenant and testament you're the children of the prophets and i'll say children of the covenant which god made with our fathers you are children of these prophets children of this old testament children of these writings of the scroll they're called the people of the book it's what they're referred to as and the people the children of the covenant which god made with our fathers saying and abraham in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed now here unto you first god unto you the children of the covenant children of the prophets unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you unto you first god sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities so here were the people of the book the children of the covenant children of the promise so he sends the messiah from them to them so that they would turn from their iniquities in the fulfillment of the covenants so christ is then the climax and the culmination of everything they identified themselves with it through it's even it's evolving as this revelation unfold and the mystery began to be written continued to be written through the prophets it just added to prophecy after prophecy as time went on one prophet said this another prophet said that and it began to build an expectation that one day the kingdom will be restored one day a deliverer will come one day there's going to be a king that will rule in righteousness and all the gentiles will come to their life and they begin to imagine this future they begin to imagine a kingdom they begin to imagine peace around the whole earth and then christ comes he's the one he's the one he's the culmination of it and i read this statement recently and it's such a beautiful statement it says the bible is christ for the old testament leads to that culmination paul and the evangelist stand on the other slope of the holy mountain so notice it's it's this the bible is christ and it's described this way the bible is christ for the old testament leads to that culmination and paul and the prophet stand on the other slope this this is this is this image the bible is christ the old testament lead to that culmination you want to guess who said that i was going to do a actually do a slide and have four choices uh and just neil armstrong vincent van gogh michael jordan or barack obama anybody want to guess of those vincent van gogh said that remarkable statement the bible is christ for the old testament leads to that culmination and i know you're all going to want to run out and buy one of his paintings and we couldn't even save twelve thousand dollars a month rent and be able to get one of those paintings the bible is christ he's the culmination of the old testament paul uses this language and i say this jesus fulfills the covenant of the old testament it's kind of repetitive because testament is covenant they're they're interchangeable and the hebrew and even the greek they're both speaking the same thing even in some translations and some commentators argue where it says testament it would be a better rendered covenant and they're trying to convey the same idea this testament of this covenant it's a contract it's agreement between two parties for there to be a covenant and then even in the testament it speaks in the original of a disposition of something it's the arrangement of any sort i want to arrange things and i wish for it to be valid i want to dispose of things and i wish that it be valid we say a will last will and testament this is my desire so this is what i'm testifying how i want things to be this is how things are going to be arranged and so the testament when paul says you are the children of the prophets and children of the covenant you are children of the testament that god made with our fathers god made an agreement and he gave a testament of how he wanted things to be and this was a promise to you of how he would accomplish things and the way things were going to be god made that covenant and made that promise with israel and so a testament we could say when it comes to uh contracts and to a testament even in the realm of the last will and testament there's a lot of law that is um written and procedures related to those things in order to ensure that what one desires to do after their death will be disposed of and handled just exactly that way and so the best way to do it is to have a will drafted and everything explicitly laid out and then it's signed and it's witnessed and there's even things called the self-proving affidavit that if you write it you sign it you have it notarized and then you have these affidavits of two witnesses who are there in your conscious presence and they also sign it that if it needs to be probated it can be submitted with the affidavits and if you think now this guy knows what he's talking about i've done this uh um and it's it self proves you don't need to do anything else to prove that this was their last will and testament but it has to be in writing and it has to be there has to be a meeting of the minds there has to be some sort of understanding and so god made a promise to their fathers and it was codified it was written it was memorialized in the testament and even in the promise he made to abraham where the real image of this agreement and this division that was made in the vision that he made with abraham in genesis 15 how he was appearing and making himself known abraham knew that this agreement had been made this was a testament this was a promise and then god brings it forth in writing and he confirms his presence and it was called a testament it was called a covenant and and we call it the old right because there's going to be anew now with this kind of coming to this place and we're doing fantastic with our time in the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals it just dawned on me that if we were paying uh fifteen hundred dollars a day we might have to have longer services just to justify the hourly on that maybe i'm missing an opportunity here but the in the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals now i want to just do this for the imagery and also what i just connected it to because then we think in revelations chapter five the events that have taken place in this day a seal in the old testament was like a roll roll up a piece of paper like this and here was a mystery and this mystery was hidden all right it was sealed around and put there this claim to so-and-so so now there's a claim there's a disposition there's a uh there is a you know something that's being granted in this estate in these promises then the next mystery was wrapped around of what this inheritance was and stuck out there on this side and then the image of the scroll being rolled up and another one being rolled up so it's turning out toward this this claim to so and so and went on down until it made a scroll because the people didn't have books like this then it was a roll called a scroll well a sealed scroll you could break loose one here what the mystery of this was and tear it loose and you could see what that claim was and then break the other one loose and see what that claim was and so you see there is an unfolding of a breaking of a seal to understand what's rolled up and hidden in that mystery the old testament in type that's what's happening in jesus christ is a seal is being broken and i'm not trying to make this argument that this there's there was the open of the seals and there was any kind of thundering forth and a breaking forth of literal seals in that day but in type and by example when he opened the book in one way in in way of language and symbolism he's on breaking a seal on the book of isaiah he's breaking a seal on the psalms he's breaking a seal on the prophets he's breaking a seal on deuteronomy 18. here he is unfolding the mystery and he's validating the claims this is what's so remarkable is here they were before in their probate here they were in their hearing to determine their inheritance and what they stood to receive and it's being proved up right before them the will the testament the testator is coming and he's going to validate and confirm the testament once and for all and then by his death grant them the inheritance and they miss it my goodness amazing so now let's look at exodus chapter 24. i and i hope this is presenting to you some coherent picture uh and and i and i think that i don't want to try to explain everything and maybe fill in all the uh maybe you just can put bricks out there but kind of let the lord put the mortar and seal in these things and now this is connecting beautifully to me and it and i have to recognize sometimes i may be looking at something and and you'll see it completely differently but but let's just say as long as we're pointing to christ and we're on the mountain we're experiencing him from these different dimensions and we want to do this together and moses came and told the people exodus chapter 24 verses three to eight and i'm wanting you just again to catch the image of all the promises promises all the prophecies all the all the the the word the law that was given to israel it's a covenant it's a testament it's a promise and moses came and told the people all the words of the lord and all the judgments and all the people answered with one voice and said all the words which the lord hath said we will do so all the words of the lord and all the judgments this is this is the book of the law this is what israel rests on all the law and the this is what would be said all the law and the prophets coming from this very point and moses wrote all the words of the lord and rose up early in the morning and builded an altar under the hill and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of israel and he sent young men of the children of israel with which offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the lord and moses took half of the blood and put it in the basins and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar and he took the book of the covenant and read in the audience of the people so now here is he wrote all the words of the lord so this is just think of the image these are all the words of the lord this is his thundering out to the people this is him speaking to the people he writes it all out he takes the book now and it's called the book of the covenant this is the promise this is a testament this is my agreement with israel and read it in the audience of the people and they said all that the lord has spoken we will do and be obedient and moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and notice what he says and said behold the blood of the covenant which the lord hath made with you concerning all these words do you see the picture here is here is all the words of the lord that are written down that are in this book that moses has written and now moses takes the scroll takes the book and to read it he has to open it up and when he reads it and they answer he takes blood and he sprinkles it on the people and now this he says this is behold the blood of this testament the blood of this covenant this book that is now made open to you this is the blood of that which the lord hath made with you concerning all these words and so the blood of the covenant is now on the covenant people and it's a beautiful foreshadowing of what he's going to do the blood of the covenant the sprinkling of the blood upon the people in the presence of an open book hearing the words of the lord what an incredible foreshadowing and in matthew 26 26 to 29 it's no i was going to say it's no mystery but i think i'd be kind of arguing against myself it is uh let's say this you'll see the connection to the mystery to them it might have been obvious the language he's using wait a minute he's being very purposeful and deliberate liberate in the way he's saying this and to an israelite they would have thought right back to maybe there's some presumption on my part but i see the direct connection to exodus chapter 24 the blood of the covenant right this is what he says right here behold the blood of the covenant and the book of the covenant the blood of the testament the blood of the testaments what it could have been said in exodus 24 so here he is at the last supper and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and break it think of this bread being broken and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it so here's bread being broken this is my body here's blood here's a cup being off he says drink you all for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins you see the imagery you see the the symbolisms do you see the fulfillments i says it he takes bread and breaks it the breaking of his body he's opening this up he says take it and eat it this is the type even of the word being divided the word being broken up he's going to break this open and then he says drink this cup because this is the blood of my new testament this is my blood of the new testament as it's written in exodus 24 behold the blood of the covenant jesus saying behold the blood of the new covenant and it's which is shed for the remission of many the blood of that covenant was sprinkled upon the people when the book which had been written had been read aloud to the people now here he stands and his body is soon going to be broken his blood is going to be poured out and the mercy seat's going to become come in plain view and the veil of the old temple is going to be rent and it's going to expose that the promises have been fulfilled in christ and there is going to hang as a sacrifice and his blood being shed and there's going to be a life that's going to be poured out and once again he's foreshadowing he's fulfilling but he's also foreshadowing this body which is broken in my blood that's going to be poured out you're to be a partaker of it you're to be sprinkled with it according to a promise that god has made with his people so the blood of the new covenant exodus chapter 24 points to christ that's ex this is what is being pointed to this is what in the sacrifice and the offering even in the very language that's being used here's christ now coming as a fulfillment of all things that moses wrote and the prophet spoke of beginning with samuel here he is and he is to be the blood which is shed he is to be the paschal lamb he is to be the sacrifice exodus 24 the blood of that covenant pointed to the blood of jesus christ and now this covenant messenger this christ this messiah points to a new testament a new covenant so there was and again in the uh our language we have a bible which is comprised of an old testament and a new testament so we think of those phrases in terms of the divisions of the book of the bible and they they are beneficial and they're remarkable in just how uh perfectly they align with even the promises of god but instead of just thinking old testament is genesis to malachi new testament is matthew to revelation think of covenant contained in those books has been fulfilled in christ and now christ is saying there's a new covenant and it's and i still want you to maintain the connection but it's not just the way that we've divided the bible there is a new covenant and it's contained in what we call our new testament so christ has introduced if i say a new blood for a new testament for a new people so let's just go back to our text and pick up one scripture to recognize this coming in because this would uh this could be ministered on to such great detail but paul says in second corinthians chapter 3 verse 6 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament we are able ministers of this new covenant now again bear in mind that he's talking about how the the people are a written epistle that we are the the the manifestation of the epistle of christ and not uh um and he doesn't try to just relate it back to himself like oh well this is me you're living out me you're my words but he says he's made us able ministers of a new of the new testament and then i love just how paul in this inspiration this anointing says not of the letter remember the letter crucified christ the people of the book the people that had the book the people that had the scrolls the people that transcribed the scrolls the people that studied the scrolls the people that preached the scrolls the people that believed in the scrolls are the ones that crucified the manifestation of the scroll so he's saying but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life there's a spirit of the word there there's a life behind the written prophecy there's a meaning there's an intent there's a desire you look at any work of literature and and they study it they've been doing it for thousands of years trying to get into the mind of the author and when he wrote this uh he's using and he's using imagery and symbolism and foreshadowing and he's trying to do character development and there's something trying to bleed through some some point trying to be made and sometimes they're trying to ascribe meaning to something that has none of those meanings at all and that's what exactly what people have done to the bible but god authored the old testament with the desire with a heart purpose with something he's trying to achieve and so it's not just the letter of it but you've got to have the spirit of it and that was so with the old testament so now paul is cautioning once again as it could be said that there was a old covenant an old testament that god had made with our fathers paul picks it up in hebrews and even in romans that there was a testament there was a covenant that was made here comes christ fulfilling all these promises and yet because they didn't catch the spirit of it they actually used it and referred to it to crucify it they used the written word to crucify the living word our prophet said thou shalt not do this and you've done it therefore we kill you he's saying i am manifesting what that scripture says they'll do the same thing today so then paul is cautioning why because there is a new covenant in christ a new covenant that speaks better things a new covenant that gives hopes that gives expectations as we we read even already today that there's this is a new covenant in his blood there's this new covenant in christ that starts to be emphasized and expressed this is a new testament this is a new covenant this is going to be a new contract these are going to be new promises and there being a new covenant there is a book of the covenant and there's there's a people to be sprinkled with the blood of that covenant oh it's great to have the word written it's great to have it written out it's great to have a prophet speaking rehearsing in all our ears and say oh this will do we'll do all of it we'll obey but you've got to be sprinkled with the blood of it you've got to be covered with the blood of the covenant now second corinthians chapter 3 verses 12 to 15. i know these are just small excerpts from this larger chapter but remember even later on today read it all over again see how these things are so uh beautifully connected together so paul says this and again i think it's a caution to what happened to israel now we have a new testament a new covenant and we see it as even in our bible this holy scripture matthew revelation the new testament being made laid out before us and paul is going to say he's going to bring this comparison and recognize this sin then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech so we have hope we have expectations just like the jews did under their covenant me we have hope we have expectations under this new testament he says and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished now he's obviously alluding to this glory of this administration that we have access to we can look at the glory of the old testament we can have that revealed to us he but so now he backs down he says but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same veil which is a covering that which hides a thing to this day remains the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament so he's saying that the glory of god shone upon moses and they had to veil his face lest they see the glory of god and he's saying the in that literally happened and he's saying that same veil that hid the glory that was to be revealed in the face of moses the glory of god to the people would have expressed it that same veil exists today still to this day when they read the law of moses when they read the book of moses in the reading of he says the old testament the old covenant the old promises he says the veil still remains so they're reading they're reading they're reading it but it's as if that veil that was put upon moses symbolized that one day there still could be a veil between the people and the glory of god the glory's there but all those masks don't we just hate them covered up the glory of god for unto this day remain at the same veil untaken away in the reading of old testament which veil is done away in christ the veil of the old testament that it where that christ did away with the veil of the old testament the mystery of the old testament the purpose of the old testament that which was going to be fulfilled the old testament it's been done away in christ he says but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart even unto this day the old testament it was a new book the old testament was open the scroll had been opened christ is standing there fulfilling it but just as a veil covered the face of moses it's still the same covering untaken away when they read their bible because they have christ has not abolished that veil in their hearts when they read it they still can't see the truth of it that's that's profound the old testament remains sealed to them it's not new to them it's not fresh it's not real the old testament i think we said it this way last week the old testament opened in reality if someone says while that didn't happen it didn't happen i well okay it happened just because you don't see it you don't recognize it you're obstinate so your disbelief doesn't change the truth so it still needed to be opened personally by revelation word of the prophets live in reality of the word then a man a revelation of the manifestation and there's a lot of things that can be preached from the standpoint of manifestation but it still takes a revelation the old covenant he says old testament old covenant had been satisfied in christ whatever veil whatever seal was on the old testament christ did away with it but there still remains a veil hiding him from them in other words the mystery remains despite the revelation right the mystery remains despite the manifestation because i'll say that's why which it just remain there's a mystery remains despite the manifestation because it takes revelation right there's a there's a still a mysterious element that remains despite this manifestation and you can say that that's part of a mystery that a mystery is a something that's divinely revealed but yet a mysterious element remains despite the revelation i think it's maybe a way that brother branham uses it in in a in one logical sense it's because just because it's revealed to you doesn't mean it's revealed to somebody else and just because you see it doesn't mean somebody else can see it now second peter chapter 1 verses 19 to 21 or should i stop here let me see i i got i if i if i get into this i want to go a step further and this is what i couldn't get to last sunday so that would be really odd to not get to it today do we owe it to the hilton garden inn to finish this second peter chapter 1 verses 19 to 21 now take this as from a jew to that would have had a vernacular that would have described the law and the prophets the book of the prophets the writing of the prophets we have the promises of moses we have the the writings as given to the children of israel but he says we have also a more sure word of prophecy that's quite a statement because they have the prophecy in the book but now he says we have a more sure word of prophecy and that would be like whoa you're saying your book is better than mine but he says where until you do well that you take heed as a delight that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star rise in your hearts what's what was the more sure word of prophecy in that god fulfilled his word okay think of that that's it's a more sure word of prophecy because they had the prophecy in peter saying christ is the fulfillment of it you have the prophet's quotes we see the living manifested reality of those quotes we have a more sure word of prophecy you have the prophets and their written prophecy but we have a more sure word of prophecy because it's changed from the prophet to the manifested reality of his prophecy he said this is what we have so it's not that it's even something different but it is what it had always been we have the prophets we have the prophets we have what they spoke of that this is them christ was the prophets in flesh is what their utterances were it's what they looked forward to it's what they spoke of it's what they manifested in different various types and certain glimpses he says so we do have today as this voice thundered out on mount transfiguration this is my beloved son hear ye him that's a more sure word of prophecy that's god in his son declaring the truth that's the more sure word of prophecy says you said better take heed to the more sure word of prophecy as unto a light that shineth in a dark place a light shining on a mystery something hidden something not seen until it the light increases and grows until it's a full dawning of the day and the day star comes to full manifestation and brightness in your heart knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of man the holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost there's your bible written by the breath of god the inspiration of god holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost the holy ghost given these promises promises i want to say promises to save time promises and prophecies they're moved by the holy ghost to prophesy they're moved by the holy ghost to give promises they're moved to declare and to foreshadow and to speak of think about all the scriptures we read in the volume of the book it is written of me search the scriptures all these the children of the prophets and all these things we've read that speak of they are speaking and foretelling of christ as they were moved by the holy ghost but that prophecy of the scripture that jesus said to search cannot be interpreted privately so what's the more sure word of prophecy prophecy confirmed prophecy fulfilled and then peter says this prophecy is not of any private interpretation it cannot be individually by a man loosed interpretation means loosening and untying so here's prophecy bound up sealed tied up and no prophecy can be privately loosed untied made clear decided or settled or explained so he says no scripture is of any private interpretation why because god moved upon these men when they spake and god will give meaning or lose his scripture by bringing it to pass we have a more sure word of prophecy here's prophecy in the scripture man tries to interpret it but he's saying god loosens it itself and he confirms it himself by making it a more sure word of prophecy so the prophecy made sure is the promise of the prophecy in manifestation it's the life of it it's the power of it he says god's the one that's going to give meaning and open it or loosen it interpret it by bringing it to pass so then christ is the more sure word of prophecy christ is the interpretation of the old testament once christ came peter says we have a more sure word of prophecy we are no longer waiting for this coming messiah we are no longer guessing what he will look like it has been interpreted by god it has been unsealed and has been decided the way is over there is no more delay it has been manifestly declared now the interpretation the meaning the understanding is only known by revelation it's only received by faith so there's a an adamant we can be adamant that christ fulfilled these things and likewise be adamant that that he must be revealed to the person brother manna makes this statement and lean not to that own understanding these are these are words that you'll find in other places that speak to this concept the identification that god own interpretation is the manifestation of the promise god's interpretation is the manifestation maybe i'll say it make it a little plainer when god speaks the word he doesn't need any man or any woman or no one else to say what that means well you say god meant this god means just what he says he means now how does he interpret his own word by fulfilling it that's why we have to be very careful that anything that is spoken prophetically we don't interpret unless god has done so himself now he how does he interpret his own word by fulfilling it now here's jesus and this is what they could have said to jesus he's standing there saying this day this scripture is fulfilled i am the interpretation he's telling them god is interpreting his promised word to you today and they could have rejected it why they say oh no man can do that no one can do that nobody can do that well he did it and he was it he's pointing them to it and paul did the same thing did not the word of god say did not the word of god say so it's after the interpretation then you point to it you speak of it you declare it you speak you lift it up the bible said a virgin shall shall conceive she did men of that day could have taken the original uh these brother aaron speaking now uh to those who are getting this on the podcast uh there's a it could have taken that word and said oh a young woman a young maiden shall conceive and it's translated to virgin they could they could have twisted up any other way and could have come up with some other interpretation he says she did she became the interpretation of that scripture that don't need any interpretation why because it's happened god said let there be light and there was that don't need any interpretation why because it happened god said also that in these last days he would pour out his spirit upon all flesh and he's done it that don't need any interpretation that only needs an ex exception accepting right somebody needs somebody to accept what god has done there's the principle that god prophesies it then once he's interpreted it you have to accept it not wrestle with the interpretation he says god interprets his own word god promised the things that we say see day by day that he would do in this last day that's the interpretation of the word of god we just need to accept it praise the lord if you include my announcement i'm over an hour but i began i'm not quite an hour uh in terms of the the content of my sermon so i feel very good to continue with my last couple scriptures here and we're just going to wrap it up with these scriptures in a statement from the message so you can see now this parallel romans chapter nine verses four to five who are israelites this is paul's brethren that he's longing for and desirous of that they would see the truth he says who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and of the service of god and the promises what is this old testament whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed forever amen the israelites to them it pertained the adoption the glory the covenants the law the service of god the promises and so according to concerning the flesh christ came to them who did he come to the ones to whom the promises were given christ came to the jews christ came to the people of the book those who get the law was given to the covenants were given to the service of god was given to the promises were given to even in the language of the old testament christ is the messenger of the covenant god made a promise god appeared to abraham god made a promise confirmed the covenant over and over and over again he confirms the covenant but now the messenger christ comes to the people god in the flesh of his son jesus he comes as the messiah he is the messenger of the covenant but now he has come not just to give the promise but he's come confirming he's come according to the promise in a confirmation or in a more sure word of prophecy as the fulfillment see i said i would do it now i've done it it's if i can say it this way i think there's maybe a a way that we look at and say confirm the promise and it's just like you we just repeat it remember what did you promise me you would do what did you promise me you would do it so i promised i'd give you a thousand dollars okay i just wanted to be sure that's what your promise was and and and we could just affirm over and over again that i made the promise but a confirmation is when it's fulfilled and this sense the more sure word of prophecy so then in romans chapter 15 verse 8 i'm not speaking that presumptuously i'm trying to use a very scriptural language now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promises made unto the fathers what is what does the bible tell us christ came to confirm the old testament christ made sure the prophecy he forever consecrated a new and living way whatever promises god made to the person and to the individual to the releasing of the people from their iniquities to the giving them of a new heart to all these things that are prophesied in the old testament christ confirmed these promises are valid and he opened up a way now for the person to inherit and to receive all the promises pertaining to these things it says the glory the covenants the given the law the service of god the promises even the adoption these things are now available through christ and if i can say this as a closed did not the new testament promise again make promises again are there not promises made by christ in the new covenant in the new testament that he's made to us ones that give us expectation and hope ones that we long to see fulfilled and so he promised he would do it again even the bible promises another messenger of the covenant and it's promised musicians if he come it's promised in the end he's promised he would confirm his promises at the culmination of the new testament christ came at the culmination of the old testament and confirmed the promises he's promised to do the same thing to the new covenant and the message the masterpiece stand on your feet with me as we read this last statement together looking at these and just pondering these words i want to read it to you he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled see the new and the old is husband and wife and it taken the old to for show the new and so you had the old and it took the old now to foreshadow the new christ is even himself foreshadowing the new christ comes fulfilling the old now in christ he foreshadows the new it it's old it's it the the language oldest the prior the previous covenant it's because another one now is in a four in a force now another one's to be fulfilled now another one it's like a clause has been fulfilled and it led into another clause because you could go back in the word of god and see that there's these layers this prophecy to israel but this mystery right another layer in the prophecy that christ opens up and and this promise leads into another promise in the unfolding of the scroll the old testament came to this but now there's still a new testament unfolds if i could use this language just by way of example when world war one transpired they never called it world war one they called it the great war uh it's not until you had another great war that they began to call the prior one world war one and you had world war ii and so in the same way you would say covenant covenant testament testament testament but then once there was another one there had to be a way well the old promise has been fulfilled but there's now a new one and so this is my i want you to recognize christ fulfilled the old but he's living he's alive ever present ever living as a mediator of the new testament of a new covenant and he says the old and the new are husband and wife so the bridegroom is manifested in the old testament the bride and the new took the old to foreshadow the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece is in making behold masterpieces behold a masterpiece behold this is what our church is in service to not that we as a local church and a local government are a masterpiece but we have committed ourselves to serving the masterpiece that is in the making there's another open of the book there's another breaking of the word there's another ushering forth of life because life is in the blood there's another book of the covenant and there's another life that's actually ushering forth from it that's where we're living now if i could say i don't think i've hid it really very well if the i am is an open book can we not come to say today in the same way i am an open book i am the word of this new testament a living reality i am salvation expressed i i am happiness in the fruits of the spirit expressed i am his word of god made flesh today why because there's been another opening another breaking another ushering forth of life god bless you today amen so grateful to god for his word i'm so grateful to be able to look into these things and see these great truths i ask you today do you see these things is there something does your heart burn within you do you know that he's been made known to you in the breaking of the bread is this a living reality to you and i would say to those who who sense well i don't know it's a maybe it's an odd language or that maybe that's running counter to my my typical thought process however we might begin to think about it i would say ask god if there's something bernie if a burning heart remember if you have the heartburn then ask him to make himself known to you because that's good that's what relieved their heartburn that's the connection they said did not our hearts burn within us it's what gave them that satisfaction go oh that's why my heart was burning within me he was made known to me and i believe that god is wanting to make himself known to you if you're lost he's wanting to make himself known to you as a savior and the forgiveness of sins he wants to take you and fill you with the holy ghost this is this is what he is desiring to do this is what he's wanting to do this is what we can say i i could say in my heart today if anything seems somewhat dark if something seems mysterious then ask him to make himself known to you let's pray our gracious heavenly father as we have stood together today it was a unified action and i would that this would be uh symbolic of us rising to the task of fulfilling your promised word it's remarkable statements lord that are made that christ is the culmination of the old testament that christ is the fulfillment of everything in the old testament it's a remarkable statement lord then we are the fulfillment of everything in the new testament oh we might ask ourselves am i up to the task can i do this you might not even understand what it means i pray oh god that you could give us such simple minds to understand what it means so many people want it to be some sort of global juggernaut that the whole world just has to whimper and fear of this powerhouse but in your first coming they were so bold to crucify you the lord may we realize that the manifestation of the word of god in this hour will be in humility it is not a public show that entertains the world but is an absolute definite transformation of the inner man that imposes itself on the outer men's thought process and the outer man's activities and i pray lord that we could begin to walk more plainly in the peace that this word of god gives and walk more plainly and the sensitivity to the spirit that this word of god brings and raises up within us and may we fulfill your word of god for our lives commit the people to you now have your way take control bless us now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
