TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ephesians chapter 4 is a chapter that i another chapter after psalms 25 i got into ephesians 4 and i don't really know how it started but i just began to read some verses here and it really really touched my heart about a month ago and i just touched on it in a service at home and then i went to germany and then i came back and i ministered on it again and and just this past wednesday night actually and the song was appropriate because i want to title the message tonight a breath of heaven a breath of heaven let's read ephesians chapter 4. now ephesians 4 is a great chapter the book of ephesians is a great book and uh you know it's ephesians parallels joshua that god is calling it a foreign ephesian church in these last days a mature church a church that is matured in the word of god and and uh ephesians 4 starts out with one lord one faith one baptism and and then goes down through the the fivefold ministry the gifts to the body and the purpose of the gifts and and then it comes to being renewed in the spirit of your mind and maybe just to get the context let's pick it up at verse 23 and it says and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the nuke man which after god is created in righteous true holiness all right so it's not it's not just talking about the new birth it's talking about a molding process it's talking about a maturing it's talking about the effect of the word in your life read the whole chapter when you go home you'll see all of that and so he says wherefore put away lying putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be angry in sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steel no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no now here's where we're going to start our text here let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying i touched on that this morning building up not tearing down that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers we often quote this next scripture and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of your of redemption so notice now he's talking about corrupt communication and edifying to those that are sealed by the holy ghost he's not talking to unbelievers here he says and grieve not the holy ghost whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption and then this next scripture is powerful let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice he's talking to people that have been scarred up he's talking to people that bear the after effects of some battles he says put these things away from you and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake has forgiven you lord add his blessing to the word you may have your seats i was talking this morning about the power of the holy ghost in the lives of the believers and how that you have enough power within you the power of the resurrection is already within you and i thought i just actually read the quote uh tonight it's from ever-present water from the rock spoken in 1961 and brother branham speaking here he says when we die our souls will go under the altar of god where i was privileged to see a few mornings ago as you know in the vision where the bible speaks of our spirits will go to god who give it and our bodies shall return to the dust of the earth now there's a whole you could take that first sentence our souls will go under the altar of god if you actually trace that back to the old testament tabernacle which altar is that it's not the altar of sacrifice i don't believe it's the altar of incense either i believe it's right under the mercy seat that all turn and so uh nevertheless that's a whole nother subject of the types of the old testament tabernacle so he says here our spirits will go to god who give it our bodies we'll return to the dust of the earth but someday where the scripture is fulfilled our spirits will be released from god will pick up the soul and the soul to the body and the power that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the resurrection now i know there's some watching the service by way of streaming who have even asked me the question where do our spirits go when we die we know where our souls go here's your answer all right right laying right here in this quote and i greet everyone that's also streaming online god bless you this is an international service tonight so you know there's people in africa streaming in different places so god bless you they send their greetings and we greet them in return amen now he says so brother branham says we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the resurrection if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of god would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it i would want to amen i'm out of here you know i'm going to make my own world that's what we do in type we get a home we set up a home we we try and make it nice we create an atmosphere is that right you know we want to have the right atmosphere in the home the wife takes care of the house the husband comes home from work to that place of atmosphere and you know kept all lovely and at peace you know that's the inner yearning but that's speaking of something even greater that's going to be one day he says you have power to do it you've got if you've got the shadow of a shadow of the power of god in you you got power to do it god is omnipotent see what i mean the power that's in you you could speak a world into existence and go live on it that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is not the keeping of a bunch of commandments it's the law of faith jesus said all things are possible to them that believe if you can believe it whatever god will lead your soul to believe that is yours you say amen to that every place the souls of your foot can set upon by faith god gives it to you what is that that's the book of joshua he says amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens controlled by if you're a son or daughter of god listen now if you're a son of god you are a daughter of god that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there you see when you feel low when you feel weak when you feel distance from god it's not that his power has left you it's that your faith has decreased you see and if you get into the right channel of inspiration whatever the holy spirit will lead you to believe when you're born again sealed by the holy ghost until the day of your redemption then that is yours by the revelation that loses the power of god within your life isn't that wonderful amen we know we go through ups and downs we have seasons in our life we we have seasons where it seems like god is so so far away and we have seasons when it seems like god is so near it's just really what our faith is walking with right now and how god is dealing with us individually and even as ministers and but i'm sure all of you understand this but as ministers many times we will we will get under an anointing or an inspiration and you feel like a superman because it seems like you could just do anything you could pray for anybody and they'll be delivered and you know that you could say anything in my would just move the people and inspire them but what is that there's no difference in the power of god there is different anointings don't get me wrong but there's no difference in the power of god in you you're already a superman you're already a superwoman but what maybe isn't super is your faith all right so your faith sometimes doesn't catch the full extent of the power that lays in you and as i said god doesn't always release that he didn't release the revelation of the rapture until the last days because it's only in the last days that the rapture is to come to pass that's why there's rapturing faith laying within the message of the hour because that's part of the message of the hour you see as i said this morning this is a love message to his bride it's the song of solomon god saying come away my loved one come away it's a it's the voice of god crying through the seeing you what does that mean like looking in a glass darkly the voice of god speaking to you and it's becoming clearer and clearer because it's a love letter that's why this message can't go to the jews actually some people think the message of the hour is going to go to the jews it's not because it's a different relationship this is a protestant the jews are not bride the jews are brethren it's the same atonement don't get me wrong it's the same atonement of calvary that during the tribulation time their eyes will become open to what christ did for them two thousand years ago as they as the scripture says they will say where did you get those handprints those prints in your hands i got them in the house of my friends you see and so they'll realize that christ died for them and what that will do is the messiah that they think is in the future they will realize was actually in the past and it will change their attitude towards the atonement and realizing that their messiah has already come and their redemption is already here and that's why brother branham said that the seventh trumpet is to the jews what the seventh seal is to the bride because what the seventh seal does for us is the same thing is that it changes our attitude towards the atonement it reveals the mysteries laying in the atonement that's already paid for because every promise in the book every blessing the inheritance all things are already paid for at calvary there's not something in addition that needs to be paid for but what the opening of the word does it changes our attitude towards what christ has already done for us we realize we're not just church goers we're not just sinners saved by grace but now by the opening of the word we understand we always were in his thoughts before the foundation of the world we realized that there were these certain mysteries that were held back that would loose the faith which would in turn lose the power within the church that will even change these mortal bodies it'll create a resurrection it'll bring the church from the ages up through the uh up from the grave and bring us into the fullness of our inheritance in the message future home he says heavens and earth have met god and man is reconciled a restored eden has begun see all the curse is gone just like all the curse of sin when the holy ghost accepts you all right so he's described in the new heavens and new earth but then he he types it to what happens in your life he says all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you notice how he says that you don't see he says you don't accept it it accepts you because it's god's attribute see if it's the holy ghost means god's spirit and it's the attribute the thought of god has accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose there's a thought this morning see you was born in sin but god had that attribute and here you expressed yourself here on earth and he comes down and gets you see you're back here here's where you belong so he's showing two different places you're back here but here's where you belong he says see sins lost its power that's right the desire of sin has gone from your heart when the holy spirit comes in you are a restored person and then when the earth is restored by the same thing there can be no more cursing no more storms no more winds no more typhoons rather you're reconciled god and man has met see that's what god's doing in our lives right now he's taking the storms out he's taking the typhoons out you see you're already sealed to the day of your redemption but you got to realize the storms of your mind by the revealing of the word that's why a prophet had to go up on the mountain and speak to the storm showing that even in this message lays the power to rebuke every storm amen all right so now i was thinking about not this song but there was a song that was sung uh in our church recently of a special i think was last sunday actually a couple of sisters saying it and the the first sign was something like i long to breathe the breath of heaven and when soon as they sang that i thought there's my title there's my thought that crystallized as i was thinking about this scripture here i was in ethiopia just a month ago six weeks maybe kind of lose track of time sometimes things happen so fast but i was in the capital city of addis ababa and i was in the hotel and i was feeling a little i wasn't really short of breath but i was feeling like the breath just didn't satisfy like i was not getting enough oxygen you ever felt that brothers or sisters you know we feel like you know it's just something not right i thought it was something wrong with my heart it's something wrong with my lungs you know i was kind of questioning myself and of course i would never share this with my wife till after the fact but you know uh so i was just kind of like i wasn't lightheaded i wasn't anything like that i wasn't really even that tired it was just like i just wanted to breathe a deep breath you know i just wanted to inhale it and uh and i thought what is causing this what is what is uh making me hindered from not feeling air the way that i would like to i've i've had coven matter of fact i just had it a couple weeks ago and didn't really affect my lungs or anything like that so it wasn't covered or anything like that but as i was pondering that that was in the city of addis ababa and i began to think about pollution and i was thinking about now in in ethiopia anybody here ever been to ethiopia all right well anybody know any ethiopians no we're striking out this this evening now the ethiopians have quite a ceremony that they have with coffee i think maybe that's why we're kindred spirits and they they take the raw coffee beans they say the ethiopian bean is the best in the world and they take the raw bean and they cook it in their house over live fire it's it's got to be like live coals or or wood or something that they they'll burn inside the house okay and then they'll roast the beans there for about 15-20 minutes and then they'll grind them uh with a mortar and pestle i think that's the right word isn't it and then they'll they'll they'll cook the coffee with that and that it's delicious it's wonderful coffee but it's it's quite a ceremony for them so this goes on everywhere so now you have to picture there's live coals burning inside buildings there's not a barbecue going on outside this is going inside so this smoke this pollution permeates everything and uh and and then you add on the traffic and the car pollution and all these kind of things and i'm just thinking this air in addis ababa is not pure you know it just i just can't get any satisfaction out of it and and the meetings moved to the city of hawassa which is about five six hours south and and uh uh we had some meetings there and hawass is more of a resort city and uh it's beautiful green country on the side of a lake so the air is very clean and there's less population and all that kind of stuff and it's much more open and and when i got to hawasa this is how i knew it was the pollution when i began to breathe the air of hawasa then i thought oh there it is you know just inhale it that that just felt so good in my lungs just a little bit cleaner air but what will it be brothers and sisters that first breath in heaven when we open our lungs and just what will that taste like what will it be i was thinking of a baby that's born that you know comes out of the womb and doesn't know what air is knows what oxygen is because it's getting it from mama but comes out of the womb and sometimes it has to be spanked in order to cry out and to take a deep breath of air and begin human life but what will it be when we start that life over there when we finally get to heaven and take that great breath and that that satisfying portion and when we get to heaven every breath that you take will be the word of god because that's all that's over there it's just the word of god and it'll be a wonderful uh experience i believe and one day when we get there and we realize there's going to be a rapture here first but when we get on the other side at the marriage supper of the lamb one day that all that was caused by this civilization will be no more there'll be no more war in that civilization there'll be no more pollution in that civilization there'll be no more crime over there you won't have to lock your door praise the lord you won't have to turn your alarm on you won't have to lock your cars and make sure that everything's put away out of sight and that sort of thing there'll be no more of that praise the lord there'll be no more cars that'll be wonderful we realize we'll be able to travel in a thought there'll be no more death and sorrow the scripture says in the new heavens and the new earth bible says in revelation 21 god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow amen sister snow i was thinking of you the this afternoon as i was going over these thoughts we know what sorrow is death is sorrow partying death is separation and we realize we don't sorrow as the world's sorrows and that as them that have no hope we realize that we'll see our loved ones again but nevertheless it never makes it easy if you've ever had to go down that road you realize this is not easy and but one day there'll be no more sorrow because there'll be no more separation hallelujah his bible says there'll be no more crying neither will there be any more pain well there's a few of you that know what that is there'll be no more pain there'll be no more aches when we get out of bed in the morning i read a statement this afternoon it was interesting says you know fellow said when i was 12 years old says i could i could ride my bike down the street crash my bike roll through the gravel get up off the road and and walk home for miles says but now that i'm 50 if i lay on my bed on the wrong way on the wrong pillow he says i'm paralyzed for two days but one day there'll be no more pain amen one day there'll be no more sorrow oh it'll be glorious it'll be nothing but the word over there nothing but the pure word of god if i say it this way there'll be no more spiritual pollution now god is calling us to the restoration that he's bringing because what he's bringing is a restoration of eternity oh you ever think about what brother brown said let me read what he said first before i go into it he says he says the great chain of perfection was broken by time space time be time came because of sin he says there's a little grou a little gap comes down breaks over this way goes out that way god had to do that because satan caused it it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and the purging of the lost that god by his sovereign grace might someday lift up that little hickey or gap back into the perfect circle then she rolls on just the same he says now time is this little loop that loops down jesus was from eternity to eternity but he stepped into the time spaces made flesh and came through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with god again for all eternity you see it he says that's all time is amen so as i was speaking this morning about the integrity god is restoring the integrity of eternity god's bringing us back into that perfect integrity he's bringing us back to that perfect perfection but also do you realize that in this realm that we call time this is the realm that grace has expressed because the angels eternal angels don't know what grace is they don't understand grace they don't understand god as a healer because they're never sick they don't understand god as a provider because they're never in need they're just in a realm that's perfect perfection we're going back to that realm but now i want to say it this way do you realize right in the realm that we're living in because of sin and because of god redeeming back to himself that which was lost in time do you realize that there's mysteries in eternity that are not mysteries here grace is a mystery to the angels healing is a mystery to the angels but it's not a mystery to you hallelujah we had to come into this realm so god could express himself in attributes that that could not be expressed in a perfect eternity so he had to allow satan to rebel in heaven take a third of the angels come down into a time realm that he has a space of time and one day the devil and his angels will all be destroyed praise the lord there will be one last fire amen and that fly into that fire goes every sin into that fire goes every fallen angel into that fire goes everything that was never in the mind of god or everybody that's straight from the mind of god and god will dump it all into the lake of fire to be annihilated one day how long will it take brother brahma says i don't know could be millions could be billions of years but it will come to an end because they don't have eternal life amen but we have been called back to eternity god is bringing back all that was lost everything in time that will that is god's will be touched by the redemptive blood of jesus christ and one day brother adam calls it a scarlet thread and god will pull that scarlet thread and everyone that is attached to that scarlet thread will be pulled back into the perfection or into the integrity of eternity hallelujah it's and we're right near the end of that great purpose right now that god is preparing to annihilate all spiritual pollution sin from every dimension will be annihilated in the lake of fire but the scripture here is commanding us now and i'll just say it this way do not let spiritual pollution come out of your mouth i'm just gonna bring it right down to where we live now all right it's nice to talk about the eternities and the wonderful purpose of god but i want you to really ponder this this evening and let the holy spirit speak to you because god he says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth let me say that again let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth all of us here would want to bow our heads now and say lord forgive me there's not one of us that would ever say we've always spoken perfectly we're all guilty of this but the commandment is don't let it happen. you see a word is a thought expressed and if there's a corrupt communication proceeding out of our mouth then there's something in our minds that is not quite right because of pressure and stresses because of feeding on wrong things if you fill your minds with spiritual pollution i'll say it this way then you're going to have spiritual bad breath i try and say something every service that you'll remember the next time someone says something that they should not say you just look at him and say you have bad breath someone's being naked has a negative confession instead of a positive confession you know what you got bad breath spiritual bad breath spiritual pollution let no corrupt communication now it's corrupt communication is not just things that you know we say bad against people but it's a negative confession it's that's why the bible says in in philippians i believe it is whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are holy whatsoever things are of a good report let me let me pick it up first in philippians chapter two it says it says in chapter 2 and verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in jesus christ who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross my you know here was god himself dwelling bodily in flesh but yet he humbled himself as a man made himself no reputation took upon himself the form of a servant was mishandled many times was misspoken to was called names many times was smitten suffered 40 lashes did not revile back let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth there was no pollution in the mind of jesus christ he knew exactly who he was he knew exactly what his purpose was on earth he knew exactly what he was sent for he knew exactly even said the disciples it's necessary that i fall into the hands of unbelievers why because he had to go to the cross there had to be a fulfillment of scripture and so he would not revile them and even hanging on the cross in the depths of sorrow forsaken by everybody a man of sorrow acquainted with grief he hung there on the cross and says father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they don't understand they don't know who i am and they don't know who they are amen that's why the bible says in philippians 4 and i'll go there i've started there but philippians 4 and 6 it says be careful for nothing all right now this is a good one for sisters i know because i have one i happen to be married to one be careful for nothing that means be worried about nothing amen amen sometimes our sisters the weaker vessels are given to worry and you don't need to i'll say it sisters you don't need to worry the bible admonishes us don't worry about anything how can i do that brother tim it doesn't stop there it says but in everything not some things everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god amen don't worry about it pray about it and when you pray about it committed to god and brother brown says there's nothing so great as a committal and when you commit something to god that means you let it go and if you let it go then you don't worry about it amen he says and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus not just your hearts but your minds brothers i'd picked on the sisters but i'll say sometimes brothers can be a little bit too stressed out about things too amen and but it says it says here if you want the peace of god this is the approach you take and he shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus then he says finally brethren now here we go finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise you will not find them on social media i'm sorry it doesn't say that but it says think on these things amen what uh what's what now read this when you go home put it up on your fridge write it out for yourself put it on your phone whatever it might be only things that are pure let those things into your mind whatsoever things are of a good report let those things in your mind now i don't know what this church is like because this is my first time here and this morning was my first service amongst you but you know some churches get to knowing each other so well that we know one another's hinder parts we know one another's bad traits did you know that there is bad traits about everybody i realize except you but everybody else there's bad things about them and and if you allow yourself you can focus on their bad things all right you can allow yourself to look at their bad parts look at their mistakes know about their history know about their past but the bible says don't think on those things because in everybody there is also good things especially the sons and daughters of god there's there there's something that god sees in each and every one of you that's a part of himself think on those things i'm not getting 100 percent here yet we'll just stay on the subject god wants you to just see one another the way he looks at you look at your brother look at your sister through the blood of jesus christ i appreciate what brother biscuit did one time in a service he was he took his bible and i do it sometimes overseas and he he finds the middle of the bible there's usually a page he says here's here's the page between the old testament and the new testament and he says on this side abraham's a liar but on this side abraham is the father of the faith on this side moses made mistakes but on this side moses by faith esteem the reproach of christ greater riches than all the treasures in egypt you see on this side before the blood were one thing but on this side we're completely another see the law on this side can only condemn us that's all the law can do the law cannot save you the law could only put you in jail the law can only cause you to be separated from god but it's the blood of jesus christ that saves you and puts you in the presence of god that's why the the jews in the time of jesus they thought they were still living on this side they thought they were still on this end so they bring a woman to jesus caught in the very act of adultery and they say the law on this side says this woman is to be stoned and jesus full of grace and truth he's on the other side he's the living blood that's about to be shed for our lives and it and he looks at the woman and and he says to them well he says let him that is without sin casts the first stone and then he just stoops down to right in the sand so in other words he's saying you all got hinder parts you've all made mistakes is that right you all got something that i the word could condemn you for he says and so let him that is without a mistake cast the first stone and i'll say it to the church let him that is without mistake cast the first stone at a brother or sister right but there was the sister in caught in the very act of adultery and and standing right in the presence of the word himself the true and just god standing in mortal flesh and there jesus stoops and writes on the sand the dirt i don't know what he's writing but as he's riding no doubt he begins to see two feet leave here and two feet leave that direction another two feet go that direction another two feet finally there's only two feet left and that's the woman's feet and he stands up and goes where are your accusers does none accuse you she says no lord he says neither do i condemn you jesus was looking through the blood neither do i condemn you go your way and sin no more sometimes it's okay if i get a little personal i just speak from my heart sometimes in the message we get a little too condemning of each other because with messages christ and the message is perfect but we fall short all the time as i said this morning brother branham said god knows you're just a man or a woman god knows you're going to make mistakes but you mustn't look at your mistakes you must look at your heart's attitude towards him and when you look at that and what you desire to be then you'll recognize who you are in the presence of god because if you measure yourself even by your own self and quite frankly as i'm preaching here tonight do you realize the hardest person as much as you have things against other people the hardest person for you to forgive is yourself you make mistakes and you condemn yourself and the devil helps you and he'll encourage you to condemn yourself and he'll tell you just how much of a bad person you are but you need to see yourself the way god sees you you're spotless in his sight because of the blood of jesus christ that's all you can say is father forgive me because of the holy spirit that's in you that's grieved that says lord i'm sorry i didn't mean to do that so he says here in ephesians he says put away these things sorry i lost my place he says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you and all malice i think the toughest one of these is bitterness but you know bitterness is a necessary part of your journey it was necessary part of israel's journey in the wilderness they come to the red sea they crossed over the red sea brother brown says they had a rejoicing miriam on the bank dancing in the spirit with the tambourine and the daughters of israel following her and singing praises to god the egyptians that army was buried into the sea and and destroyed by god there and they were they were just having a jubilee and brother mahm says it this way he says after the big song was over the big shout and having a hallelujah big time they started through the wilderness and led them right straight to bitter waters he said isn't that strange that's actually three days from the red sea to mara bitter waters he says right into temptation right into where the waters was bitter and they couldn't drink look the stream of mara bitter waters lays right in god's path he was leading his children isn't that strange looks like god would have bypassed that but he led them right straight up to that water he says yes standing there what can we do hallelujah we followed the lord we come through the blood we separated ourselves let me stop here for a moment many times those of you i don't know how many of you are old-timers in the message and how many you are new to this message that we love but you know many times we come into the mess and we thought our battles are over the truth is here finally and and i can just feed on the truth and that'll make everything perfect but you know what this isn't our millennium we can have an acreage with a pond horses and all that kind of stuff nice green pastures and everything and like a shangri-la on this earth but you know what this isn't our millennium the millennium isn't here this is the molding time this is the overcoming time this is the time of battle and he says he says what shall we do we followed the lord we come through the blood we separated ourselves moses said stand still that's right in every temptation he'll make a way of escape there was a little bush standing there on the side there hallelujah he cut down the bush and throwed it in the water and the water became sweet bubbling up joyful what another shouting time they had amen so the the little bush brother brown says another place that was that tree was a type of calvary he says you put calvary into the bitter waters he says and it takes the bitterness away but the bitterness was necessary god led them to the bitterness they had to go through the experience and many times in our lives we have to go through bitter experiences in order to overcome the way he wants us to overcome there's things in our nature there's things like you know job didn't get the great victory of the revelation of the resurrection simply by sitting in a church service amending the preacher no he was he had to go through some real trials he lost his money he lost his 401k all right he lost his is his family he lost all his children he lost respect amongst the brethren he became a nobody when he was considered the wisest man in that era and then on top of that he lost his health and he sat on the ash sheep he lost everything except the fact that he was alive that's all he could claim in life that he was alive it was bitter but he writes about it in in the book of job and talks about his bitterness but it was necessary because god was trying to get to him a revolution that he could get to him no other way job do you realize that when your redeemer when the redeemer comes you'll meet him he says you look at botany life the seed goes into the ground it comes up this one dies it comes up he says but what about a man but one day the lightning struck as it were and the whirlwind come down and the revelation struck job and he suddenly realized oh my says i i know my redeemer lives i know that though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i shall see god amen there's coming a resurrection time it was it became a reality to job you know brother adam had to go through those things too even in the beginning of his ministry i was talking about with brother aaron the other day how that you know you know brother branham how that he he had these visions they were bitter to him his friends ministers were telling them that's of the devil they all of a sudden came on him and and and he didn't understand it and and it tore him up and finally one day he said he has this this vision this blast underneath this tree and he's he's caught into the heavenlies and he doesn't understand it at all and he tells his wife that's it i'm done he says i'm going to my where i pray which was his cave and he says i'm going to pray and ask god to take these away and if he doesn't take him away he says i'm just going to die there i may never be back he says if god doesn't take these away and he goes to his cave and he begins to pray and he takes his bow and he begins to search the scripture and he's and he's calling on god and calling on god just take him away lord thereof the devil i don't want him i don't want to be of the devil see there's something in his heart his life's purpose as i said this morning is laying there and he doesn't understand it and he's he's just desperate before god and finally finally it's not the angel the revelation comes to him from the word of god and he begins to see it in the word oh jesus said whatsoever i see the father doing that doeth the son likewise and he began to see the scriptures pertaining to visions and how god would deal in visions and how what a prophet was and it began to become quick until until finally and you listen to brother branham's testimony he actually says this he says it just like this i don't have it in front of it he says it just like this and i begin to think maybe they're of god and then all of a sudden a light appears hello the bitterness was about to end and the angel stepped into the room and a man come walking out you know how he describes him he says and tells him that you've been sent with a gift to the world and you'll pray for potentates and kings and all monarchs and great men and all these things and begins to describe describe to him the ministry in other words he begin to describe his soul to him this is what's laying in that predestinated seed in your soul you are purpose to this work but it took a lot of bitterness to get him to the revelation of the word for himself personally see sometimes bitterness you can't avoid it but paul says while you must receive bitterness because it'll mold you you're not to give bitterness bitterness is something comes into your life but bitterness is not something to come out of your life because you get calvary in there and it changes the bitterness to sweetness brother brown says in hebrews chapter 4 he says he led them to bitter water so he could prove their faith see revelation he likes to do it he likes to let tribulations come on you so he can show you his love and his power how can people today who doesn't believe in a miracle working of god when tribulations come they just give up and go on but we believe that god works miracles amen let all bitterness and wrath and anger i'm not going to go through all of these and clamor and evil speaking don't ever say something bad about anybody why is why is he why is paul emphasizing that because right in the midst of all this he says grieve not the holy spirit whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption why is he saying that he's saying because in you is power to speak worlds into existence and go and live on them by the new birth the holy ghost that's laying within you but there are things that will stop the purity of that power that power that made the universe is inside of you i'm dealing with believers tonight that power that made the universe is inside of if if god is omnipotent every part of god is omnipotent and that little part if you've got the smallest part of god in you that littlest part is omnipotent but don't let that spark because we know that under the opening of the word in the last days part of the revelation of this day is that sons and daughters of god will have the right to say whatever you say it will be done if you say to this mountain be thou cast into the sea and be not removed but if it's as i as i described already is that if you're it it's all according to the revelation of your faith and if you if you allow your life if you allow your flesh if you allow your spirit to hinder the holy spirit that lays within you the purity of the power of god is hindered by corrupt communication let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus when you let god take all of the pollution now i'll just describe that pollution take your culture out of your mind we all have a culture you got an american culture i got a canadian culture africans got african culture asians got asian culture doesn't matter as chinese or indians or or or ugandans or ethiopians or americans there's a culture you've been raised in this is the way we do it really is it the word let the mind that was in christ jesus be in you because the power that was in christ jesus is in you and if the power that was in christ jesus was in you and the mind that was in christ jesus is in you then that's going to lose the power of god the way he wants it loose amen whatever we say whatever comes out of our mouth let it be edifying let it build up amen let it paul says here that it may minister grace to the hearer whatever i say o lord let it minister grace to somebody let it not minister legalism this woman was caught in adultery the very act what does what does the law say she should be stoned what does the message say she should be put out of the church oh don't worry i'm coming to this i'll show you write in the message all of these things you know we get very legalistic in our mindset it's okay if i take my coat off i'm getting kind of heated up i don't know why you know what thank you we we we get into this attitude as message believers listen saints i think we've been here long enough don't you i think it's time to go home but that going home comes from an everyday living for christ and a putting on of the word of god as i said to the brothers yesterday i said i said that brother branham had the vision of the bride of jesus christ he said she was wearing a specific garment he said lord grant that the crowning of my ministry would be to clothe the bride of jesus christ in the word and that's what we want to be clothed in is in the word and and this message is used of god to clothe us in the word of god and so we're we're we want the power of god that is within us all right stop now i got to explain this are you still with me the only reason i'm preaching on this is i would that the power that's already in you would be entirely loosed in your life if you say yes you see luther had the same holy ghost that you have same holy ghost we brother brown says we've been in the feast of pentecost from acts 2 all the way to today holy ghost down through the church ages but what what hindered them a lack of revelation see when the word come back to the church the just shall live by faith that loosed them to greater than what they had but that wasn't the fullness the the power of god in their lives by the new birth was still hindered by church ideology brother branham says the holy ghost is bound by church traditions that's what he talks about the river euphrates and all of that and i don't want to go into that tonight but nevertheless the the thing that we got to get out of our lives is church traditions the things that we got to get out of our minds is any thoughts that's contrary to the word and let the mind that was in christ jesus because the mind that was in christ jesus is revealed in the message of the hour it come to restore the word well what is the word the word is the logos it come to restore the one that became flesh and dwelt among us back into the church again so the entire word of god comes on the scene in the bride of jesus christ and her thoughts become entirely the word it's not just the new birth listen the new birth will get you into resurrection but it'll take the mind of jesus christ to get you in the rapture because the mind of christ has been restored in this day one time brother branham you know i'll say it this way could brother branham say anything he wanted to no he couldn't there's there's times that but yet technically i'll say he could say anything he wanted to but the question in the question was where was he standing all right one time brother branham talks about in one place he calls it his final test 1959 he talks about it he says there was a young couple in the church in a meeting and they were doing immoral acts right in the meeting it wasn't in jeffersonville it was out on the field somewhere because that's where things get out of order and the he says they were performing immoral acts and and us the deacons tried to stop them they wouldn't stop and and you know they were climbing all over each other right in the service brother well let me just read it the way he says it he says and the spirit of the lord came upon me and i begin to shake and this is before the service he says the lord said there's a trap set for you be careful what you say notice that statement says i write i went right ahead speaking just the same and oh he got so immoral with her till i had to stop again i said don't do that sir please i said if you want to make love to the young lady then you leave the building but this is a religious meeting so you see what's going on it's terrible and he says you shouldn't do that please don't do that while i'm preaching i started again and he just made it worse talk about disrespectful reprehensible every bad word that you might think about it he says something said to me say what you will and it'll be done and i stood there mr mercer the tape boy and all of them standing brother fred many of them standing present the perspiration was just running from me something said say blindness and it'll be blind say death and they'll pack them out say what you will he says i couldn't speak i couldn't move it just and it just left all right so now he he gets a commandment say whatever you will and it'll happen but then the devil comes behind that and says why don't you say death why don't you say cancer why don't you say this or that or the other and and he's just standing there he doesn't say anything because he doesn't know what to say and he says it just left and i thought god what must i do and i turned and he stood there and his face white looking at me and i thought what must i say and then i turned and looked like before i knowed what i said i said i forgive you of your act it doesn't sound very tough to me sounds christ-like and he says and i look down there and i said i forgive you and then he said that's exactly what he wanted me to say see forgive your enemy these are the spirits that make you evil watch them spirits see the power of god in you and the devil wants you to say the wrong thing and the and the warning of god was watch what you say because the power of god was in god's prophet and the anointing was on him and and he could have said anything and it would have happened but he had to be careful what he said see let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of identifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers now let me just say this brothers and sisters i don't know where you're from i don't know your background i know brother aaron a little bit but there's nobody in this message that has done to you or to this church what that couple did in that meeting can you say amen to that now it was his will that brother brown would say i forgive you it was god's will it was the spirit of christ it was the mind of jesus christ to loose the power of god in the meeting for them to say i forgive for brother brahm to say i forgive now if that's so then that's so now you'd be long enough around the body of christ you know somebody's going to say something or do something that offends you that's the reality somebody's going to do something that that you don't understand there's things that people do and it might not even be to you but somebody will do something and act in a certain way and behave in a certain way that's discreditable to the gospel of jesus christ and you'll look at that and you'll say that's not right they shouldn't do that that's wrong but where you go next will determine a lot do you have an attitude where like those that talked about the woman that that came to jesus that they brought to jesus it says they ought to be stoned but what did jesus say the mind of christ says neither do i condemn you neither do i condemn you she did a reprehensible act she was caught in the very act of adultery hello there's many times that we have friends family members that go sideways and things that happen and i don't even know why i'm harping on this tonight but you know it just seems something that god's dealing with me and i'll say it deals with me personally because you know many of us think we look at different situations that have happened that have arisen and we immediately want to condemn we immediately want to put them out we immediately want to discommunicate or or separate or or shun or whatever more it might be but that was not the attitude of the lord jesus christ when he saw a predestinated seed in somebody he said neither do i condemn you go your way and sin no more yet at the other hand he could look at a rich young ruler a man that was that lived right that obeyed the commandments that did everything right and and the young men said you know what must i do to have eternal life and jesus said well you know the commandments and he said these i've kept from my youth and jesus said okay only one thing you lack the bible said jesus loved him and that's what he was doing and telling him that he was loving him he was loving him by telling him what he lacked in his life he says go and sell all that you have give it to your to the poor come and take up your cross and follow me and you shall have treasure in heaven and the man went away sad because he had many possessions but jesus loved him he said i'll give you what you need you want to know what you need you know you're not satisfied i'll give you the reason you're not satisfied it's because you're holding on to your wealth let it go you see that's a complex actually brother brown says if you find yourself being greedy give everything away that's a complex you see and so so there's many things in life that the devil tries to hold us to just because we have the power to speak doesn't mean we ought to speak just because we have the truth doesn't mean we should say it there were things that brother branham held back and even that he asked the angel can i tell so and so or he asked god can i tell them what's about to befall them sometimes he knew he couldn't even tell the person god would reveal something and he couldn't even share it just because you have it doesn't mean you share it you know paul was caught up into the heavens the third heaven he says we know it was paul he tried to put it at arm's length but we know it was paul and he was caught up there into the third heaven and he says i saw things that are unlawful to be uttered i can't even tell you what i saw i don't know about you brother aaron but i'd want to be sitting at paul's feet come on paul tell us what you saw i want to hear about heaven i want to hear what you saw i believe you were there why don't you just share with us the details he says no there's some things it's unlawful for me to even speak them my my the responsibility but god knew the character of paul and he knew that he could trust him with what he had revealed to him the bible says the word fitly in psalms or proverbs 25 a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver fitly spoken means in its season you see there's words that that are just not truth words have timing you know and and there even ecclesiastes says there's a time to keep silence and there's a time to speak all right so a man uh proverbs 15 says a man has joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good it is amen so it's not just that you have the truth we don't handle the word of god like an axe or like a sword and just chop down everything that we can see by the word of god we have the ability to do that but that's not what the word is for let the mind that was in christ jesus be in you jesus said to the disciples in john 16 says these things have i spoken to you in proverbs but the time cometh the time cometh when i shall no more speak to you in proverbs but i will show you plainly of the father at that day you'll ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because you have loved me and have believed that i came out from god so here jesus is speaking to the disciples and we'll call it dark phrases and he's telling them listen there's come in a time where where you'll it'll no longer be proverbs to you it'll be plain what's that time when the spirit of truth is come he will lead you into all truth all right so when you have the holy ghost you'll understand much more than you understand now as a matter of fact at that time he says you won't ask me to pray for you you will pray for yourself because you'll understand that the father loves you and there's no greater hour than this hour for the understanding that god loves you and that day you'll know what day this day at the end time that i am in the father the father and me i and you and you and me amen there'll be a revelation come into the church that will identify to them their personal standing in god himself i was speaking about your position i'll just drop this in i didn't drop it in this morning but i'll drop it in now david's speaking about the purpose let me not be ashamed unto thee oh lord do i lift up my soul let me not be ashamed let not my purpose be ashamed let it not be defeated by my enemies you see the purpose that god put in you is for a specific reason it's a part of the redemptive plan of god listen to me very closely and the devil wants to defeat that purpose in you and i'll just say it this way the devil knows if he can defeat your purpose he can defeat god let me be more plain if he can defeat you he can defeat god you don't understand what's inside of us we don't understand the strength of the dealing of god in our lives we don't understand the connection to the eternal many times and and we we we just consider ourselves oh well you know i'm not important no god put something in you that has a purpose in this life and he will empower you and does empower you and ensure you have the power to carry out that purpose in the face of all opposition isn't that wonderful it's god doing it it's his purpose it's his great plan it's his redemptive plan breaks god we're just a part of it but when you get a revelation that i'm a part of it there's nothing can defeat me oh i make mistakes oh i fall short and and every day i have to pray lord forgive me every one of us do but yet in the midst of all of that we can say god there's something in me that's carrying me forward there's something in me that's moving me forward i can't help myself i sometimes i try and go this direction and sometimes i'm trying to go that direction but it keeps pulling me back it keeps moving me onward because it's something that god put in you that is a part of himself you see that's why jesus said the disciples uh i i say not i'll pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you see they didn't have that revelation yet they still were living in malachi you say you love us wherein do you love us see israel brother braham said the church age book had a tough time understanding the love of god thought love would be like a parental care for a baby protecting them from all harm he said but that's not god's love god's love is in the eternal god's love is an eternal purpose god's love is a revelation of himself in you and a molding of your life into the image of himself to be an expression of him in the age that we live in hallelujah still with me i'll go a little bit further try not to keep you too long tonight we're living in a time america i love america because of its principles don't love everything it does i'm canadian i happen to think canada is the best country or at least used to be but i don't know if there is a best country anymore they're bringing laws into effect in canada with relation to speech what they call hate speech what they call hate speech many things in this message would be deemed hate speech in america you have still freedom of speech maybe and they want to put laws into effect in america i see in the news and i'm not a political preacher don't worry i'm not going down this road but i see in the news they want to bring some kind of a ministry of information or something or uh ministry of truth thank you uh you know something to govern that you know you know that's that's one thing that they want to do but anytime you draw a line the question is not that you're drawing the line the question is who is drawing the line and where is the line drawn all right i'll say in the message that there is freedom of speech but that speech is governed by a nature it's not governed by a rule and it's not a line that's drawn by somebody it's a manifestation of the word of god in you and god puts his nature and that's why brother branham as god brought him to the test he says now be careful what you say he knew that the nature had been molded in the man to the mind was subject to the word of god and even though he had the authority to say death or say tuberculosis or say something else yet in himself there was a nature that that just doesn't seem right he had been molded by the holy spirit the warfare within his own mind to realize i only want to say what's pleasing to the lord i don't want any corrupt communication to come out of this mouth i remember when brother branham keep coming back to me then when he was in portland and the lunatic there that come up on the platform wanted to uh come and destroy him and and the man was big bigger than me 300 and some pounds and six foot five or something like that and and the man was you know was demon possessed and took pleasure in destroying preachers and and brother brown was just a little guy and and uh and so he was he come up on the platform and brother branham just shoot away the policeman and everything said this isn't a flesh and blood battle but what was the devil trying to do you notice that every trick that that giant pulled was to try and break the atmosphere of divine love around brother branham the things that he said you're just a liar i don't know about you i hate being called a liar because i'm not a liar and when somebody accuses me of lying i i just like i don't know what it is there's just something in he does not like it and uh and and the that that demon called brother brown i'm a liar you're just a snake in the grass you're just you know this and that and the other thing that didn't affect brother brown's thoughts towards him was you know what he's just a man he probably has a wife he's got children maybe that love him and and he doesn't mean to do that it's just the devil on it so the devil took the next step and god allowed him to he spit in brother brown's face i have to understand what is he trying to do this is not a flesh and blood battle it's the devil trying to break that atmosphere of divine love that was around brother brown because he the devil knew if he could break the atmosphere brother branham was powerless if he could get brother branham in his flesh brother madam was a boxer if he could get him in his flesh he could defeat him if he could get him wound up in his mind he could defeat him but as long as he stayed behind the word there's nothing the devil could do and branham just you know the man says i'm going to knock you into this out into this audience i'm going to break your neck or whatever he said and brother branham was about to say i wouldn't do that sir when out of his mouth came because you have i forget the words now but because you have glorified yourself over the servant of god you will fall at my feet today and the man thought it was brother branham speaking but it wasn't it was god speaking through brother brown and and the man says i'll show you whose feet i'll fall over and he goes he comes back to to strike brother branham but he gets a little bit too close and he comes under that atmosphere and he begins to crumble and brother brahm says he fought with everything that was within him to try and stay on his own feet but he just began to crumble why so great was the power of the atmosphere that brother branham had created by yielding himself to god by saying the right thing that's all the devil wanted was just say the wrong thing and he could magnify that and use it to disrupt that meeting if that's so then that's so today all he wants us to do all the devil wants us to do is say the wrong thing let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth they came to jesus in mark chapter 7 and they were accusing him of unclean eating and eating with unwashed hands etc and he says hearken unto me every one of you and understand there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but that which comes out of him those are the things that defile the man and the disciples came to him and he explains it to them he says are you without understanding do you not perceive that whatsoever thing from without enters into the man cannot defile him you know how the jews were washed with with you know eat with washed hands don't eat the wrong foods has to be kosher all of these kind of things jesus says ignore that that's not what defiles a man he says because he says it cannot defile him because it enters not into his heart but into the belly and goes goes out at the drought purging all meats he says but that which cometh out of a man that defileth the man for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders theft covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness evil eye blasphemy pride and foolishness all these things come from within and defile the man in other words there's nothing the devil does to you that can defile you praise the lord but it's what you allow to be within you that defiles you bitterness must come offenses must come but that does not define you let me say it again that does not define you the woman at the well with five husbands and all of the living that she had lived and the one she was living with then was not her husband that did not define her to the world to the church that defined her it's like oh she's she's without hope we've tried to help her we've tried everything we could and just try and teach her the right way to live and try to support her and try but she ends up going running off with another man all the time five men and now the one she's living with now is not her husband and there's no hope for this woman and she comes in the middle of the day because so that there's nobody else around when she's drawing water but jesus the word himself said the word himself said i have needs to go by samaria hallelujah i have needs to go by the way of a predestinated seed that is laying in the muck and the mire of the world and is all trodden down and cast out and and thought lowly of by everybody in the world there's nobody that gives her any hope but she's a seed hallelujah she's a seed and when the light struck the seed that's all it took when the light struck the sea then something changed then her life became different she dropped the water pot she runs into the city come see a man that told me all things is this not the very messiah the very purpose of her life now become manifested because the word of god ministered grace to her if that's so then that ought to be so today there's bitterness that comes from without but let not bitterness come from within our words are meant to be spirit and life you see our words are meant to be a breath from heaven amen god's calling you to minister grace to somebody else that's the truth not minister judgment that's not our place our place is to minister grace i don't care how far they've gone your call is to minister grace let me just close with this quote here i know it's already six o'clock i think we started at four and it's already time i'm sorry i've kept you so long we'll close with this thought brother branham is asked a question it says i lived many years in sin until i found the lord please brother branham i've sinned again i'm not worthy to come before you in the holy place please tell me if i can be restored holy again please help me brother branham i have a devil in me help me will you lay your hands upon me and restore me again this is questions and answers in 1962 he says you have not sinned my friends so far in god but what you could be restored if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you'd never want to be restored so i say it tonight if there's anybody in here thinking that the fact even that you're in this room means you can be restored he says as long as there is something dealing with your heart you're still in the line of restoration it says guilty of the least is guilty of the whole i have sinned many times every day every one of us do things we don't want to do that always gets a quieter amen when you say that he says every one of us every day do things that we don't want to do why because we're in these yet unredeemed bodies he says you don't want to be that way or you wouldn't ask the question he tells the person he says that itself is a proof that god's still dealing with you the very see the very fact that they asked the question he says you've probably gotten nervous probably satan telling you that you can't be restored he's lying because look if there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep call a deep to respond to the call if there's a hunger for something that something's got to be somewhere or you would have no hunger for it now as long as you're wandering and hungering to get back to god there's a god somewhere calling you see or you wouldn't be hungry there's a creator see now he goes beyond just the fact that you're hungering there's a possibility he now says the fact that you desire to be restored is actually only god himself dealing with you personally he says that proves god's calling you he says it goes to show that you only fell from grace backsliding is not lost i want somebody to tell me there where's backsliding lost prove it to the bible in the bible backslider's not lost he's just out of fellowship israel backslid but they never lost their covenant they lost their praises and joy david lost the joy of his salvation when he took bathsheba uriah's wife but he never lost his salvation he never said restore unto me my salvation he said restore to me the joy of my salvation he says oh there's so much legalism today touch not taste not you don't do things legally i don't come to church tonight legally i feel tired i've been nervous i'm upset i'm wondering about something that's out before me my heart's burning even as much until my hearts are fluttering i got a cramp of pain right at this moment just shooting back and forth up and down through here weak nervous trembling catch a hole here and squeeze and got my toes squeezed up in my shoe i i feel anything but come down here and you got symptoms praise the lord he says why did i come then because i love god live or die i must stand here for him it's not because i have to someone asked me today this afternoon might be streaming right now because i thought you were just in germany and before that you were just in ethiopia what are you doing in phoenix don't you ever rest i'm like i feel fine everything's good as long as i might feel weak but in my weakness his strength is made perfect he says i love god live or die i must stand for him it's not because i have to he wouldn't care about whether i did or not let's stop on that one sometimes we feel like well we have to or god's going to be angry with us brother brown says i didn't have to come and preach i do it because i love him he wouldn't care whether i did or not he says if i die i'd go to heaven anyhow but i'm coming because i love him you serve god because you love him not because you got to because you love him enough and you love the lord with all your heart you don't have to worry about these things if you made a mistake you don't sin willfully you just done something wrong you've slipped back true you was up here in fellowship and you've dropped back down in this must down here i'm just skipping over parts of it just to catch the highlights he says and he goes into into a story that i love and he talks about a bur an eagle in a cage in a zoo and he says he says this eagle wanted to get out but it couldn't get out of the cage and it would fly thinking if i just tried harder your brothers remember that were at the breakfast what i was talking about if i just try harder i'll break through the bars and it'll be over and and he tried to fly against the bars and he was all bloodied from flying against the side of the cage in the zoo it was an eagle that had been trapped and brother branham had you know his heart was the heart of a redeemer the redeemer and he he looked at that ego says if i had the money see if i had the purchase price i would pay for the bird unlock the cage and let the bird go free you see there's a mystery to the bird but it wasn't a mystery to brother branham there's a mystery of redemption to us but it's not a mystery to jesus christ he paid the price that you and i can go free you can be free from every complex you can be free from every bitterness you can be free from every malice you can be free from everything the devil's trying to put on you you can be free because christ has paid the price and he who the son sets free is free indeed and you can be free right this evening if you can reach out and accept the cr the price that christ paid for you you don't have to leave here under the same cloud that you came in you can leave here totally free in the revelation i'm a son of god it doesn't matter what the devil does to me my life why it might fall apart tomorrow but that doesn't mean anything different i'm still a son of god i'm still a daughter of god no matter what happens he's putting it all together i might have loved ones that are out there in the world i might have people that i want to see save that doesn't make no difference he's in control i got children that are not where they ought to be but let me tell you something tonight i just want to share this with you many people ask me and say you know brother tim what about my children what about you know them i'm praying for them is there anything else i could do do i says if they're a child of god they're coming i said it's got nothing to do with even your prayers because nobody was praying for me when i came into the message i got no family in this message god came down through a little town in the middle part of bc the interior of bc and sent some man that had been in the message only six months and knew nothing about the message he was a police officer he knew basically nothing about the message you know he was so bad he called amy temple macpherson one of the messengers he knew nothing but one thing he did know was original sin and i said to him i said what is this serpent seed you keep talking about or no i said what is the message that you keep talking about he said well you ever heard a serpent i said never heard of serpentine and he told me what the original sin was that it wasn't an apple and i've been to church all my life was raised to pentecostal et cetera et cetera and when he just told me what it was he didn't even explain it he just told me what it was fireworks went off there's no other way to say it scriptures begin to become real to me revelation just began to pour and just because somebody told me the original sin was adultery in the garden of eden between eve and the serpent and i was like there it is that answers so many questions and from that time to this time i've never looked back it was a man that knew nothing that just told me what the original sin was what's it going to take for your lost loved ones to be saved something very simple a word spoken in due season is going to change their lives hallelujah i just believe that's real so brother branham close goes on he says sister brother whoever wrote this if you have fallen down here that doesn't mean you're lost you're just an eagle got into a pen that's all you're caged up down here in sin again you don't want to be there that's the reason you're looking upward o brother branham i once lived up there is there a way here yes you may think you're tied to brother sister who wrote this question you may think the devil's got you tied down but he's lying there was one time a man come to earth jesus christ the son of god he untied you don't you believe it you don't have to stay down there no sir you're free that's right he died in your place to take away your sins you just believe on him flop your wings and fly away with the rest of them don't stay in that pit of the devil then he goes back to the question he says the question says now will you lay your hands on me and free me from that and he says sister dear or brother dear i'd lay my hands on you but that wouldn't free you what would free you is to understand you're already free you're already untied you don't have to worry about being free you're already free jesus made you free be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage you're free as you can be you don't have to be tangled up laying my hands on you is just a tradition i could do that but that still wouldn't set you free until you accept what he's done for you that's just me saying lord i believe it that anything goes back to the question well you just lay hands by faith upon him no sorry he says to the person will you just lay hands by faith upon him say you just and i want to say this right so so that it's very clear he says well you just lay your hands by faith upon him many times in the service brother brown said who did they touch i'm 50 feet from them i'm 20 feet from them who did they touch they touched the high priest it wasn't by their hands it was by faith their faith touched the high priest he said you lay your hands by faith upon him and say lord i believe it yes he said and then he says up you come confess your sins he says he that hides his sin will not prosper covers his sin but he that will confess his sins who do you confess them to the lord confess them to him that's where you get freedom and justification when you're willing to say i've sinned i'm wrong that's what you said here i've fallen i've sinned i'm dead wrong is there a chance for me to be whole again it's the last sentence or two sentences the minute absolutely he says the minute you desire it that shows that god dropped the lifeline down to pick you up just rise up on his lifeline of faith and prayer move right on up into the rest of the eagles like that and go flopping away let's all stand together let's bow our heads together maybe there's somebody here tonight that just wants to reach out to him by faith with our heads bowed and our eyes closed and say lord i heard your word tonight i believe it lord and i'm reaching out tonight to claim my freedom why don't you just by faith raise your hand to him and say lord i claim my freedom tonight i claim deliverance from this thing that's bothering me i recognize it's just the devil it's a lie of the devil and i'm walking away from the night by faith in jesus christ i'm laying a hold of the atonement 2 000 years ago that has been revealed in its fullness in these last days i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god and i accept what jesus has done for me do you know that song amazing grace shall always be my song of praise maybe you could say that and we'll pray heavenly father lord we come to the end of the meetings today we're not so full of ourselves lord that we think that this service will change the world [Music] but lord we just believe it can change one person we believe lord that you speaking a word in due season can come to somebody and let them know you're already free let them know there's no need to worry let them know there's nothing of this world to be caught up in the thing that troubles them is just a lie of the devil and the deliverance that they desire is already here father i pray for every hand that was raised i pray father for every burdened heart i pray o god even as brother branham said it doesn't take laying on of hands to do it it just takes an acceptance of what jesus already did at calvary lord you paid the price that we could go free we accept it tonight in the name of jesus christ we accept it for ourselves we accept it for every son and daughter of god if there's somebody here tonight lord that is that is languishing a little bit lord and wallowing around in in pity of the enemy thinking that they can't be free lord may you break that chain tonight lord may your word go forth you are the breaker o god and with the sword of your word may you break every chain and set the woman free that the devil has tried to keep in captivity for she's your wife lord and lord you are the one that has brought liberty to the captives you have brought the jubilee to those that were in bondage o lord you have changed oh god our our spirit of heaviness and changed it into the oil of gladness you have taken us from ashes to given us o god uh joy and given us peace o god lord that we might rejoice in you for this is the hour of rejoicing the marriage time is not the hour lord where we should just just be sorrowful it's a time that the bible says let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come we rejoice in your word we rejoice in your deliverance we rejoice in the mysteries being unveiled we rejoice in all that you've done o god this final chapter of your redemptive purpose we love you lord we thank you for your grace in our lives thank you for this church lord thank you for every son and daughter of god that's gathered here may it minister to them lord they've got this building and lord it's the building is not the church the people are the church but while they have this building lord i know they're renting it they'll probably soon outgrow it but yet lord in the midst of all of that may your presence abide here lord lord when people come into the doors of this building may they have grace minister to them lord may there be no corrupt words spoken here lord i pray father according to the admonition of your servant paul may bitterness [Music] may evil speaking may malice may every wrong thing depart from the minds of these people oh god if they've had struggles if they've had scars lord may you just drive away every bitterness may you just drive away oh god every evil thing and raised this church up as a place of grace ministered in these last days for when you send the capstone come down it comes with cryings of grace grace lord a double portion of grace in these last hours you're calling your predestinated seed use these people lord use them mightily not as to raise them up as worldwide ministers that's not what we look for lord but we're looking for it on their job may there be an atmosphere around about them uh looking for it in the supermarket we're looking for it in the neighborhood lord we're looking for wherever these people would go lord may your atmosphere of your word be around about them so that the people will know there's a living god ministering grace in this hour to the hearer that wants to hear it if there's a backslider here tonight lord that has a desire may they know lord they've got a hold of the lifeline and accept your grace to them oh god that sets them free in this hour oh lord may they leave here oh god renewed in the holy spirit brought unto you o god we give you the glory lord lord may every trick of the devil that holds the people may it be broken oh god may it just be broken tonight lord may a word have been fitly spoken o god that sets your people at liberty tonight that they'll know grace has been ministered to them by the holy spirit by your great spirit oh god amazing grace
