TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title today is unshakable and I'm taking it from verse 28 there it says that we receive in a kingdom which cannot be moved and we'll come back to Isaiah chapter four I actually mentioned it a little bit this morning and then come back to it Wednesday night and then maybe in the future just to see the climax of those two kingdoms as we've been building through that but I felt directed to this subject for a couple Services before we went out of town as a way of just just felt to really encourage you and direct you to some things that would be stabilizing and it's also foundational because as we read here in Hebrews chapter 12 there's a lot of things that Paul is looking at and pointing to that are at the time that he's saying it showing the Believers where they then existed at the time but he's also prophesying and seeing something at the outset that's just going to grow and and grow into the body of Christ and so there's a lot there to see and a lot of my inspiration has been coming from the sermon Christ is revealed in his own word so this would be maybe a sermon German that someone some of you may want some direction in terms of something to study or to listen to but this sermon Christ is revealed in his own word has just been full of things that have been inspired and he covers uh quite a bit I'm trying to kind of cover it in just a little bit different way today he makes this statement at the beginning he says now my text this morning is Christ is revealed in his own word now where I come to the conclusion to talk on this was because that knowing that we say we mustn't just say because we gather together to just haphazardly speak on anything I think that's great just because you know you're going to have a captive audience and everyone's going to be there you don't just come and speak on anything but he says that you want to um you know you want to give some thought to it not just be haphazard and then he says but it's something that will help stabilize the people and that's hearkens to the title we have today unshakable something that will help stabilize the people for we're going to pass through dangerous treacherous Waters we're already sailing through them and sometimes I guess it's with you like it is with me that seems like that so much of it is he says it's it's such a scary and I can say that we could say that and fill in the blank it's such a scary there's a lot of things that we go through uh that cause anxiety and that seemed very fearful and brother Brown was saying that has he had this opportunity to come and preach Christ is revealed in his own word uh this is on August 22nd 1965 and he's wanting to minister something that'll stabilize in given a tumultuous time and an unsettling time he wanted to speak something that would bring stability and for the next few uh chapters or those paragraphs there he starts talking about how what a nervous age that we're living in I think he even uses the phrase neurotic and how that there's a wearing down of our minds and our bodies because of the tensions it talks about the hybrid Foods or doing it to our body he says if it doesn't to our body what's it doing to our minds and he talks about just even the tensions how it's wearing down our bodies and our minds so there's a wearing down of emotionally and physically he's called it a nervous age and he's bringing the thought that Christ is revealed in his own word and so given all the chaos that exists in the world today the one thing that's going to bring us safety is cry Christ one thing that's going to bring us stability is Christ and we might in in the face of being wore down physically and being wore down emotionally we might seek things that could prop us up physically prop us up emotionally and find things that can placate us or calm our fears and he's wanting us and he's wanting to stabilize by saying you're going to find the stabilizer in the word I think it's in the absolute he says he's the one that stabilizes and brings the stability and he takes John chapter 1 verse 1 as part of his text he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and he's talking about building a foundation he uses the phrase for Christian Living and the Very foundation for Christian Living is is Christ the word and he's mentioned how if you're going to have a Christian Life you have to have an ultimate and for some people the ultimate is their church or the ultimate is their denomination or particular Doctrine but he's building the foundation for Christian Living as the ultimate of God's word given the instability and given uncertainty we need an absolute we need we need something that's sure something that's not changing and he says we Christ is that and you'll find him revealed in his own word and he makes this statement I just uh I'm wanting to read these so you could see that in in an age of nervous tension in an age where the foods are killing us and the pressures are killing us it's not just a change of diet it's going to give you life it's not just a vacation that's going to give you life but he's saying there's one thing one thing where you're going to find your stability he says today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of gift that God has got now that's quite a statement Satan can impersonate any gift that God has but he cannot bring that word word by word it's uh it's an impossibility for Satan to stay on track long enough to get it right and so if it starts out just give him enough time he's going to vary because he can't do it word by word he said that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always failed a lot of this is fresh in our minds the things we've examined he said that's where the tape on false anointed ones or anointed ones and this is quite a statement they can be Anointed with the spirit that's a capital s speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel instill a devil now that's quite a statement and I don't believe that brother Branham just always emphasized that but it's kind of used as one of those wake up if we were doing it today it would be in all caps and said you won't believe what the prophet had to say about this right and we would click it and we'd want to know well what did he have to say about it that you could manifest these gifts or these outward emotions of tongues dancing shouting he even preach he says he says it's still a devil in other words it's not an a true genuine anointed one still of the devil or not right and that's quite a statement and what is he I believe his emphasis isn't so that every time we see someone speaking with tongues like Devil right anytime someone dances we say devil because then you'd be wrong but that we wouldn't be taking our comfort from the fact that we preach wouldn't be taking our security from the fact that we can dance or shout or speak in tongues but that we we find our rest solely in Faith's only resting place and that's the word of God again he says this and these things are just right here at the outset of him preaching Christ is revealed in his own word he says you can be anointed out here in this spirit and desire and do all these other things but when it comes to this type post to that word you'll never move from there and that could be said of you could be anointed in your spirit to shout or to dance and you can even be anointed to shout and dance in your spirit by some wrong Spirit where you're shouting the wrong things and dancing to the wrong thing so look those are things that exist within that spiritual and Physical Realm and the spirit can be anointed to do these things but when it comes to the typos to that word you'll never move from there and that that's got to be in that Soul Realm it'll hold right steady and true to that word as it can be outside of that regardless of what you do you're still lost so unless the soul has anchored in the word of God unless there's been life brought forth by the new birth you're still in a state of uh subject to punishment subject to missing the Rapture and then he says the laodicean church Age naked blind miserable don't even know it it's that anointed and he says Anointed with the real spirit that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his Spirit but his soul is his germ that germ is the word that's where that's where you want it to come from I don't care how much you can preach how well you do this and how much you love that's one of the inlets to the spirit you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets and you can love and even love God and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach and do these things and still not be right as I read this a lot of times you hear preachers preach against this dancing the shouting speaking in tongues and all that but they always miss the part about you can preach too buddy and still not be with it but but I'm brave enough to read this he says you can cast out devils and preach and do these things still not be right Jesus said so said many would come in that day says that word settles it so we're not deriving our anchor isn't well I can preach and well I can shout I can dance I can I can do all these different things and he's pointing to the scripture where Jesus says many will come to me in that day and profess to have done many wonderful things in his name so it's not that they were practicing a witchcraft or sorcery but they spoke with tongues they laid hands on the sick they cast out devils in his name and and there's this uh emphasis to say well that's great but Jesus in that moment says I never knew you so there's a there's a knowledge that must come by the new birth in our soul where the germ of God which is in your soul is quickened to life and and God help us that we wouldn't be a seed of God who is so attracted to the physical and the spiritual that we never have a face-to-face meeting with God to be birthed from the inside and because there is brother Branham says that if if the devil can't get you out on the smoking and the drinking and the partying he can get you out on the religious limb but what we what we're encouraging uh often reminding you of is that there is a new birth to be quickened again by the holy spirit of God in your soul realm and there is where your soul find finds rest and if your soul can be anchored if your soul can find rest in the word of God oh what a wonder it does for the body and the spirit it's even according to that life which is in the soul you can cause your emotions and cause your body to come subject to the word that is in your spirit now the other scripture that brother Bradham takes as his text in the sermon of Christ is revealed in his own word is Hebrews chapter 1. verses one to four and if you don't mind even in the presence of the Hebrew scholar I'm going to take a few pages from the book of Hebrews uh and ex expound upon it a little bit foundationally but to come to this point of how that you are to be unshakable we want to be unshakable especially given so many things passing through treacherous Waters and uh and I even I guess it's good for me to kind of exercise this one of the things that caught my attention is the very things that we might feel that we would have the right to lean into a little bit and be comforted by dancing shouting praise and rejoicing speaking with tongues like these are gifts of the Spirit a genuine anointing the very things that we might feel like wow at least that's going to purge me that's going to make me feel good that's going to lift me up brother branham's even in a way saying hold on that doesn't settle it and maybe that's a little unsettling maybe that's a little well that seems kind of counter counterproductive that seems to be kind of counter scripture but he's wanting to be sure that at the end of the day you're rooted in the word of God and you're and your foundation so he takes this from Hebrews chapter one and you read verses one to four he says God and Paul now beginning this book is coming right out front and telling us what his whole purpose of this letter is God who at sundry times in diverse manners spake in time pass unto the fathers by the prophet so this would be uh the Jews their faith their conviction that when God wanted to speak to them the law was given to them by Moses a prophet that the prophets came and spoke words and spoke words of judgment and gave prophecy of even Restorations and these different movements and things he says that God in the past when he wanted to talk to us he talked to our fathers by the prophets and right off the bat he's saying but now the prophets have ceased because all the prophets foreshadowed the coming of the Messiah he says hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son so now he's saying this belief that we thought a messiah would come is fulfilled he has spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory in the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he hath purged he had by himself purged our sins that's a remarkable statement to Jews who solve the the sacrifices of bulls and goats in Rams as a shedding of blood to one uh to cover sins once a year and even in that uh that one offering says he has by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high I believe we used this in the first part on the kingdom how that this is the the Messiah as the King this is this is elements of the Kingdom now if you could just for a moment just draw on your prior experience and things that you've heard and things that you've been taught and how that we know that brother Branham says he preached the same gospel Paul preached and that's a significant statement and it's given in the context of uh we're resting on that you know that will Paul be judged and he says well I preached the same gospel Paul preached and we know that uh brother teaches in the in the um Church age book that the word was perfectly given and perfectly understood by Paul and that just as Paul uh was given the word in that day that again in the last days it'll be the word again as Paul had it and with that in mind it's good just to think well this is what Paul taught these are the teachings of Paul brother Branham did say that Paul's Revelation then was prophecy for today so you can preach the same gospel but you can also be fulfilling the gospel and bringing it out in the manifestation that Paul saw it coming in and I mentioned this before and I just wanted to take a few moments this morning to based upon these very scriptures how that God at one time spoke by prophets but now he speaks by his son and and and to consider Paul's faith that we have Paul's gospel I preached the same gospel Paul preached the word as perfectly understood and perfectly given to Paul Paul's Faith as we think about it and even his conversion was not a conversion to a new religion and I know when we think conversion and Jesus says when thou art converted strengthened thy Brethren that now when we think of someone being converted we think of them coming out of sin and a world of maybe drug use and devil worship or maybe someone who's agnostic or an atheist and then the gospels preach to them in this prior belief system that they had about the world or this Paradigm that they saw in the world has completely changed and we say someone is converted maybe when if they're Muslim and they convert to Christianity that's that's how we see from a false Faith to a true faith if you were to witness and maybe there's someone who's formerly was Catholic and they come to the message and say well they were converted from Catholicism to the message maybe someone who's a Mormon and they're convert uh to uh Christianity there's this idea of what a conversion is is maybe an abandonment from a prior belief system and the leaving of a faith into a new faith but Paul's religion Paul's conversion is not that and one thing to take note here as we're leading this has been kind of I don't know why it takes me so long sometimes to get there but Paul's religion wasn't an institution that they visited it wasn't embodied in the temple or the Tabernacle or the history of the Tabernacle or the existence of the temple those were elements of it but Paul's religion was in everyday life there was no separation of it in a in a church building there was no separation of it uh separation in his everyday life for worship or faith and that's quite a statement for us uh at least in North America where church and religion has always seemed to kind of find a place and as time has moved on Christianity is less about our everyday lives and more of a hobby or a recreation something that's in addition to it but to a Jew their life was their religion their everyday life everything they thought everything they ate everything they wore the way that they lived and even as the scripture is telling them to bind certain things and keep the word always before them and they had a language that they used that to speak of promises and a coming Messiah and they all looked forward to one day when there would be this Kingdom set up on Earth and all the Gentiles would come to their light and so they didn't have a separate place for their faith they didn't have a separate place for their worship their lives were that it was their everyday life and as Christianity has declined in North America it's very interesting that it's not just scandals in the church that's causing the decline of Christianity though that is a part of it but the majority of people are no longer attending church and no longer participating in worship and church functions not because of the scandals but because it just doesn't fit into their lifestyles that light it's not conducive to their lifestyle that it doesn't fit in with their with their travel schedules with their Recreation schedules with their hobbies and where it's just not convenient anymore and two and to a Jew they're Christian their faith or their belief wasn't contingent and tied only to going returning to Jerusalem a few times a year it was embedded in their everyday life and let us not be those who are maintaining the vestiges of church going uh because we can still traditionally attend service a couple times a week but let's be sure that our lifestyles have have kept a place where Christ is present in our everyday lives and so that we're not still Christians and we're still church goers because we've been able to carve out a little bit of time twice a week but rather our lives are defined it's called brother I said Christian Living must have an ultimate we found that Bedrock we found that ultimate and therefore there's you cannot separate me from this religion because my life is this quote unquote religion when Paul was converted they're on the Damascus Road and I know it's often referred to as that Damascus Road conversion and as he tells about it in different places in the book of Acts when he meets this Pillar of Fire and and he asks and brother Branham does a tremendous job of identifying how that Paul says who art thou Lord and it wasn't Rabbi or Master but it's translated to capital L that he's recognizing well this is the one this is the one we worship this is the one that the Jews reverence and he said I am Jesus and I believe it's in chapter 21 he says Jesus of Nazareth I am Jesus whom now persecutes and this becomes this this converting point for Paul as he tells the story when he tells his conversion this is where he begins and that word conversion just it means a returning or coming back too now when we say conversion we think turning away from sin turning away from false religion turning away from the things of the world and and and to God but now to Paul and as it's used in different places in the conversion it's a returning or turning back again and now for Paul it's almost as if wherever they began in the Promises by virtue of their traditions and their ideas and their Concepts they had gotten so far away from who the Messiah was going to be that when he came They Crucified him but now he turns and he comes back to the real heart of it it's a it's to he's turning now in that moment he's had this belief and conviction all along that there'd be a messiah but now he comes to the truth of it as the Bible even says nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord that's the same word used for conversion or when thou art converted he says the veil shall be taken away and when Paul then is converted he's turning to the word presently he's fighting this and for him if I could put it this way Paul then Paul's faith when he's converted he's not converted to a New Faith you follow me that far and I think this is very critical to understanding the message of the hour that Paul is not converted to a New Faith but it was a fulfillment of his faith it's what God had been leading to from the moment that he said Abram get thee out like this is this is it and this is what Paul recognized is wow this isn't new religion this isn't a a a new belief system he was not denying the one true God he wasn't forsaken all the prophets as false and condemning everything that had been before Paul's message then in essence was that guys God fulfilled that what he said he would do you believe the prophets that's great you've got to believe the prophets because otherwise you won't believe who Christ is so it wasn't rejecting the Jewish faith it wasn't a turning over of Judaism into something new and denying the one true God and changing who created the heavens and the Earth and redefining uh the the the fabric of their religion he's saying this is what it all pointed to his conversion uh was was to the truth and the reality of what the faith was pointing to so Paul did not leave the Jewish religion but he advocated that Christ was the Fulfillment of it now if you could use that in type of how the message of the hour is not a rejection of Christianity it's not a complete tearing down to the principles of the Bible and picking apart uh uh things that people had believed before and all the prior expectations and ways of worship it's saying everything that the Christian church has been looking for we're living in the time in the hour where God is fulfilling what he's promised to do to the Gentiles so it's not it's not something new and different in the sense that oh we're completely repudiating what's been but we can say this message is what you're looking for this Christ whom you claim to believe this Messiah you claim to be looking for and desire to see this word is who reveals him so when he was writing in the book of Hebrews and he's writing this letter he's saying and he's taking chapter by chapter elements of the Old Testament elements of their worship and their faith and their belief and he's saying the law is not the ultimate the temple is not the ultimate the priesthood's not the ultimate and he takes each element of the law and maybe not each but he takes elements of the law elements of Temple worship elements of the priesthood and he takes all these things and he starts identifying how that Christ fulfills all that they typed Christ is the Fulfillment of it Christ is uh is what all these things pointed to as they were a shadow of it so then in Revelation excuse me Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2. I hope that you're comfortable this morning and uh if for some reason you're not we'll just blame it on the song leader in Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2 he says wherefore seeing this now this is we're coming to the very end there's one more chapter chapter 13. uh and it's uh kind of his final warnings and and uh encouragements to the church and as he has gone through establishing Christ as the Messiah and then all these elements in these other chapters he says we're foreseen we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses what I was looking at in this sense everything Paul was sharing was a witness all the foreshadowing all these types Sins that were compassed about with all these shadows and types and Christ is the perfect fulfillment of it seeing that we have this now it becomes incumbent upon us let us lay aside every weight and these sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us Paul recognizing that there is some Journey there's some Continuum even as much as they believed even in the immediacy of the returning of the Messiah that these are the last days and the latter times he saw that there was prophecy to be fulfilled things to take place it says the race which is set before us looking unto Jesus not quite quite a statement now if you take someone who's just been newly acquainted with the Messiah and Jesus of Nazareth is that Messiah and now their their whole Paradigm is being changed their language is being is being changed and now I'm not looking and waiting for the Messiah to come I'm now looking to the Messiah who has come looking unto Jesus who is now the author the beginner and the Perfecter or finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God that's when he opens the chapter with as how that he is set down at the right hand of the Majesty on high who by himself has purged our sins so he returns right back now he's gone full circle from Hebrews chapter 1 to Hebrews chapter 12 he's he's kind of closed the loop in some ways to say now that's I've set this forth Jesus Christ is the Messiah he is the Fulfillment of your faith he is the the long-awaited Messiah and King that the Jews have longed for and that have looked for as he continues it through the next verses 12 to 17 he admonishes them to continue to endure correction so these are the elements of going forward that now that you've looking unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith that there's a correction that takes place and there's a there's a shaping and there's a teaching he's telling to look diligently stay on guard lest ye fail and uh and he's inspiring them to be perseverant and he arrives at this Hebrews in Hebrews chapter 12 we'll start with Verse 18 because this is our text that we took and I'm very happy with the the pacing today and just your expectation and uh and I know that you're listening very very intently and it's very good for me I commend you on your on your attentiveness and because I'm just it's to me it's just very uh very structured today and very simple so now he comes to this and I feel at this point is he's tried to encourage them says now Christ we're looking at Jesus the author and finisher of our faith now he's saying this is how we go forward this is this is his final uh words to in this Hebrew letter in his closing words as he exhorts them I says for ye are not come and and what a way to hearken back to everything he's just rehearsed to them for a year not coming to the mount that might be touched and that burned with fires using an incredible language here the mount that might be touched in other words that could be touched a physical Mountain Mount Sinai was a physical Mountain that could be touched but yet when we come to Exodus chapter 19 he says God says don't touch it so when he says it might be touched it's the to bring into view the physical Mountain so you are not come to that the mountain that might be touched and that burned with fire and nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest it's important to catch this year and not come unto a mountain that can be touched and that burned with fire those are characteristics but then he says you are not come unto blackness you have not come under Darkness you have not come unto tempt us verse 19 and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words these are all ways of describing Mount Sinai and he narrows it down even further lest there be any ambiguity as to what he was referring to which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore remember how in Exodus 19 that when God spoke the children was like whoa let's don't do that again just Moses you just tell us what God has to say and we'll believe you right yet this is what they didn't want to hear the voice of God anymore they were frightened by it and and Paul says this drawing from uh the scripture for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as Beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with the dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake there's a lot of scriptures I'd like to bring into this view as Paul is using it in Exodus 19 and 20. a lot of the descriptions that take place on the mount over those days that Paul is taking and distinguishing between the spiritual Mount Zion and the physical Mount Sinai that we can read about in Exodus 19 and 20. there's these this physical Mountain that existed in The Exodus Paul was saying you didn't come to Mount Sinai and as we'll go as we continue in the next verses he's saying this is not the mountain you came to you came to Mount Zion now Mount Sinai is no little mountain for him to say you haven't come uh uh to Mount Sinai it's not like him saying hey you haven't come to Camelback Mountain and someone's like yeah I don't prefer it anyways I like South Mountain right it's not just throwing something out there uh uh uh some of us might prefer Mount Lemon so shout out to Tucson that it's it's not it's not just some kind of recreation spot well when I go on vacations I prefer you know the real the real pastors they they climb Mount Rainier and we have some sort of competition about mountains but to say Mount Sinai this is the beginning of all of it as God had called them out of bondage and prophesied that they would be in this Exodus and they would return uh to the promised land before they entered the promised land actually The Exodus begins with God revealing himself to Moses on this mountain in Exodus chapter 3 God reveals himself to Moses in the burning bush on this mountain and it Mount Sinai then becomes associated with God revealing himself where some form or Visage of God some expression that God was hiding himself behind makes himself known to the prophet and The Exodus is kicked off by the Lord himself coming down and identified himself in a in a burning bush on a Mountaintop and says I come down and I'm going to send you so the very Deliverance begins on this mountain and he says when you bring them out return back here so it was a place that they came back to it's called the Mount of God it's a place where the Ten Commandments are given Mount Sinai is where the law began it's where they're even the law beginning and where they're coming to the understanding that I the Lord uh will raise up prophets and I'll raise up a prophet like and unto me and it's all it's all happening around this time and associated with this uh this this mountain Mount Sinai it's even here that God for the first time ever begins to speak of a kingdom that he wants to establish in Exodus 19 5-6 now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people it says where it begins if you will obey my voice and keep my Covenant I like thinking about that in terms of his voice it establishes the Covenant and he says if you'll keep my Covenant says you'll be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people and then there is a covenant that he keeps that his voice establishes he says you will be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and it tells us something I made the Earth there's a treasure hid in it and if you'll keep my obey my voice and keep my Covenant then you'll be that treasure that is in the earth that I that is mine and you will raise up out of the earth as notice this you shall be unto me a kingdom you'll be the kingdom that splits up out of the earth you'll be the kingdom that rises up from the from the dust and the ashes you'll be the one that emerges ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priest and a holy nation first time that God uses the phrasing you will be unto me you will be my kingdom you will be priest in the holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel so Moses is going to bring this message from Mount Sina this is the beginning of the Kingdom this is where they begin to hold in their minds that there's not just going to be a a land that is being returned to them we're not going back to the way that it was uh with our father uh Abraham but we're going we're going to go back and know that God's going to raise us up that God is going to establish us that God is going to send a messiah we're going to be a holy nation we're going to be blessed above all people over the face of the Earth and we're going to be a kingdom of priest a holy nation and then he tells them that's not the mountain you came to you we have not as he says now we have not come to Mount Sinai but verse 22 but you're coming to Mount Zion now there's so much that I hope stirring up within your hearts and I want you to think about this there is going to be a Mount Zion Showdown for the bride there was a Mount Carmel Showdown about Transfiguration Showdown and there will be a Mount Zion Showdown and what did Brother Ram say Jesus Will Be The Showdown in the Mount Zion Showdown he'll be the showdown between the bride and the denominations between the kingdom of God and all the worldly kingdoms between organized religion and the truth so we have come unto Mount Zion and under the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels oh what a language we could begin to use so many scriptures that can begin to take out of the Bible that Paul is saying you've come unto Mount Zion the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem you've come to it now what Paul said is here and I know that I could say it quickly without having to go into the scriptures Paul is saying that you've come to the Heavenly Jerusalem Paul sees it as it's beginning John in Revelation 21 has seen it in its end because we see the Heavenly Jerusalem we see these things the city of God coming out of heaven and the City of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem he's Mount Zion then is the dwelling place of God it is God's habitation if I could say this I know it's self-serving to the the series but it's the spiritual kingdom of God you have not come to Mount Sinai you've come to the kingdom you've come to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem Mount Sinai was in the wilderness Mount Sinai was not in Israel was not in the promised land it's actually connected with Egypt it's uh it's tied uh to Egypt it was a temporary stop in The Exodus it was not their final destiny as a matter of fact when God begins to speak in Exodus 19 about in The Exodus he says he talks about how I have brought you out of Egypt On Eagle's Wings and he's showing that we're coming out and now the stopping point before on Mount Sinai where the law was given in the wilderness before we enter in that's where cyanide is it's not even in the Promised Land it was just a it was pointing to the promised land it's not in the adoption it's not in in all the things that pertain to the Eternal Kingdom it was a stopping point on the way so it wasn't the final destiny so when he says Mount Zion he's he's bringing up before the Jews and again it's not like he said Mount Zion and and it's uh you know something foreign to them you have not come to Mount Sinai but you've come to mount Denali this where's that right I mean what is that where is it but he refers to something that was sacred to them take something very sacred Mount Sinai he's not destroying it it's not demolishing it he's he's placing it look at the place that it had look what it represented in the law look at all these things that I've I I've showed you that pointed to Christ that that were brought forth there in the law brought forth there at Mount Sinai the very law of the prophets begins there the very the very things that brought forth Elijah in Micah in Malachi they all originated there but he says now Christ has come he says instead of us thinking so much about the Wilderness in Mount Sinai think about what Zion represents because Zion Mount Zion was the first city of David it's an area in Jerusalem where David first established his kingdom this is this is an orientation I said now we've come and again I'll reiterate this Israel is built upon the prophecy of Mount Sinai this is what made them who they are we're on our way back to the promised land if I could just use it to Encompass everything they brought with them into that into the promised land is based upon everything that they'd heard in the wilderness going to be a messiah raise up it's going to be a kingdom established on Earth and Paul is saying now instead of you living in the glare of what was given on Mount Sinai do you not realize that everything that Mount Zion signifies and there's going to be a restoration of the kingdom and it's going to be great and all it's good everyone's going to come to Jerusalem this is it you're there you've arrived you've come to it continues in verse 24. to the uh well verse 23 sorry to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn now this is mysterious language the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn is that you're all already taken the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn.com I always do spell check when you're registering urls general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in hand of spirit perfect now all these are just just large thoughts you've come to Mount Zion well you could spend a lot of time on that in a Bible class so then you come to the city of the Living God you've come to the Heavenly Jerusalem even uh him referring to the angels and orienting just what habitation this is and now this is a further description of the mountain they've come to what they've come to to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn Paul now is describing it more particularly that Mount Zion is the body of Christ that it is made up of the elect of God whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life for him to say that their names are written in heaven he's saying you are these are the citizens of the New Jerusalem recall how that uh what a name means and then also for a name to be written it was a roll call that for a Jew to have a place and for Jew to have a position in the in in the nation of Israel and for a levite to be a levite and for certain Levites they're entering the priesthood it was a matter of where's and where's the name at buddy yeah he had to go back to the role you had to go back to the books and flip through and say okay yeah all right you're good so when he says these names written in heaven I think that sometimes to only have the that we we sell ourselves short a little bit in our excitement about that when we only just think about some book up there one day that's going to be opened up and where the pencil smudges are there's somebody who's going to hell and where the ones that remain those are the ones that are going to go to heaven and there's so much more to it than that these names written in heaven that relate to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn these are the elect of God who sit in zenri whose origin whose place of origin who's rightful place and their inheritance is in heaven whose rights and privileges are in heaven who are not just merely earthbounding and come up from the earth and only have some sort of Genesis in the earth they can we can trace our lineage back to in the beginning was the word and he says we've come to God the judge of all these are elements that are represented as Paul is describing something I I when I when I look at it this is just me personally and the way that Paul describes it there's a lot of things that strike the eye as being foundational and that this is this is what makes it up but it's as if he's building to now the god the judge of all and the spirits of just men made perfect that it's it's it's thing it's something that's layered something that is building he says God the judge of all of it and God the judge of all to the spirits of just men made perfect God the righteous judge has Vindicated them as just and what a phrase the spirits of just men righteous men Justified men made perfect Justified and perfected an acknowledgment and a recognition of this maturing of the Christian Life and what's represented in the Beyond and even in this great Kingdom now I I will maybe come back to this very point in after vacation maybe with a much better uh toned tan uh come back to Zion here but Zion is the birthplace of God's children this is when we think Zion there's something spiritually significant about it and the reference to the daughters of Zion I think maybe we'll come to it a little bit uh this morning so you can see how this overlapped and how this tied together and maybe I could say this at this moment if there some of you may be trying to reach real hard into what we have preached to kind of under connect it to seven women in one bride and if the connection's not being made that's fine but it's this is an incredible overlap for me it says the daughter so even the daughter of Zion is a reference to the rightful citizens and Heirs of Zion it's the citizens of design the inhabitants of Zion even the the phrase that's used the sons or the daughters the Zion is it's a reference to the rightful citizens The Heirs of Zion and I want to say this as we go to verse 24. Paul arrives as he says fear not come to the mount that might be touched in The Exodus the children of Israel came to the base of Mount Sinai and they were never allowed to go to the top it was only in a beautiful type Moses is called up and and there's and there's a there's a barrier a boundary that's built around the mouth don't touch don't come near because it's death to come near to it and as Paul comes to Mount Zion he is in figure doing the same thing we've arrived at the base we've arrived at the beginning you're at the foot of Mount Zion the beginning of Mount Zion we are we are now the Church of the firstborn we are uh we are we are now the the initial ones who follow Christ who's the firstborn among the dead we are now the first uh the first church that's been raised up we're the first general assembly we are here we are we're at the beginning the very beginning of this Kingdom I hold that in mind as Paul arrives at the base at the beginning the foundation and in verse 24 he says unto Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant this is what we've come to we've come to Jesus looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith the one who is sit down at the right hand of the Majesty on high the one that sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God and to Jesus we've come to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant now we know that Christ is in the midst of his church Christ is mediating Christ is Christ is interceding through these ages and to the blood of sprinkling and then I love how he brings it all the way back to Abel that speak of better things than that of Abel so we've come to Jesus the media to the Covenant we've arrived at the foundation there is no church without the mediator there is no body of Christ without Christ the head Paul says for other Foundation can no man lay then that that is laid which is Jesus Christ it is from this Foundation that God builds his church this Foundation of Christ this is from this Foundation that he develops his body so Christ is the Cornerstone Christ is that Foundation Jesus says I say unto thee Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it it's the only time that Jesus ever mentions having a church and Paul can never get away from it why because this Revelation that I'm going to have a church and upon the revelation of Jesus Christ I'm going to build and develop my church Paul says you've come to the Church of Christ you've come to this Foundation that no one else can lay we've come to and arrived at the very Cornerstone revelation of Jesus Christ upon which he declared he would build his church so Christ is telling us that he did God intends to build up and establish a church an assembly called by his name this is in the image as we've come to Mount Zion and the sermon Christ is revealed in his own word if you listen to the sermon or read it you'll find that brother Branham is telling this story of this of Mount Zion in a particular way so this is it'll overlap with it if you take time to study it the entire Bible Brothers the entire Bible is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ Christ is revealed in his own word got to have an ultimate got to have an absolute the entire Bible is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ making himself known to every age so he will make himself known to you through his word it must come from the word we don't we don't want someone to take the word and manipulate it and to make something outside of the word that has some semblance of it remember the devil's lie that's not the realm we want to exist in we want to always be able to bring it back to the word he says he made himself known in the days of Luther as a foundation the church the foot the legs now now this image is remarkable like he did King Nebuchadnezzar you remember he dreamed those dreams and come from the head down so now if you think of that in Daniel and that image of these kingdoms from the head down uh to the feet and and we see that in the Earthly kingdoms says now look at it here he comes from the feet up in the Babylonian Kingdom he showed all those Old Testaments he come from the head down and you're I trust that most of you are familiar with that as he describes these kingdoms and their different compositions down to the feet until he come down till God himself became flesh at the foot of the ladder so is that those kingdoms wind down and then Christ is coming from the head down to the feet Christ comes he says now here in the New Testament he brings himself right back up again to the head again the head of God to be crowned and this is himself so it's got to come back to he calls it the intelligence it's got to come back to the crown it's got to come to the Head not just the feet the legs the hand the tongues the eyes it's got to come even into the intelligence the head the crown the top he says it's he brings himself back to the Head they had the gold to be crowned so now he's showing it it's coming up from the feet he says God was in the beginning he kept coming down through the prophets on down until God himself became human like us plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a baby born in a manger hated rejected despise a bad name in everything he was so that's it comes down to the feet God happens under times spoke to us by the prophets but now in the last days has spoken to us by his son and he said then he started Rising from the feet he began to build the church the bride coming back on back you see many women one bride many Church ages many churches many denominations many splits many things but one bride's being built through all of it the bride coming back and now coming out now coming out into the headstone where it all joins together and makes the one great transfigured body of Jesus Christ a transfigured body of Jesus Christ that that's something to chew on yeah are you pondering what I'm pondering that's something to think about that that's transfigured body of Jesus Christ it builds up to that moment we should be thinking then that it's all built into a climax of a resurrection of those that have been before and a glorifying of those that are alive and remain this is where we've arrived we've come to the Pinnacle we've come to the top in this hour I'm getting ahead of myself but Paul says we've come to Mount Zion but now as he started at the base he builds to the Head now let's I'll try to go more quickly here in verse 25 Paul says that we've come and arrived and he's wanting to give this image as they came to Mount Sinai and they refused they did not want him to speak anymore on that mountain and they had Moses speak and the Judgment was if you do not obey my voice and you don't heed my voice then you you won't be this Kingdom Paul says see that you refuse not him that speaketh for they escaped not who refused him to speak on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven it's that principle that God sends his word for our deliverance for our healing and if we reject it it's judgment this therefore the same message that saves is the same message that judges the same message that heals is the same message that condemns the same one that's going to bring you out it's the same one that slams the door on you if you won't come you're saying we must hear his voice I'm gonna go ahead and Skip um uh where I was going to go with this and just try to bring it stay within Hebrews 12 and close but if you can remember in Isaiah chapter 4 because it says if they escape he's talking about escaping in Hebrews chapter 4 it starts talking about they that escape they that are left those that have been separated out by a spirit of judgment by a spirit of burning see that you refuse not him that speak it for they escape not who refuse him that spake on Earth much more shall we not Escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven the gospel Christ the media or speaking if you reject him how can you how can you escape how can you be spared this brings us back to the image of Mount Sinai in verse 26 whose voice then shook the Earth but now he have promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven this is a prophecy from haggai this is this is Paul where he's standing we've come to Mount Zion and he's saying God's going to speak again oh I hope that you could just uh think about what this message represents and the symbolisms and the the events and the things that transpired to bring us to where we are today he says this voice shook the Earth yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word this prophecy yet once more so it's he's not pointing back historically to Mount Sinai he's not even pointing back historically to the days of Jesus on Earth and he's not just speaking to the voice and the mediator of the New Covenant which is speaking from heaven but he says this word yet more what's more signified the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain what Paul saw we are facing the completion of what Paul was looking at and challenging to persevere you had not come to Mount Sinai this is not a temporary stop on our way to a Promised Land we've come to Mount Zion we've come to the kingdom and this is the very things that make it up and whereas you couldn't touch that mountain and you couldn't walk that mountain you couldn't Traverse that mountain we've arrived at one that we have we must Ascend and we must come to the top we must go all the way through this so what Paul saw there at the beginning we're facing the completion of because we're not at the base of Mount Zion we've come to the Capstone we've come to The Headstone we've come to the completion and it's there at the top God doesn't speak at the base he speaks at the top look at what takes place in these types of Mount Sinai look at what takes place and even where it would be represented in Mount Carmel Mount Transfiguration Mount Zion it was the voice of God that shook the Earth on Mount Sinai and it will come again and Shake Heaven and Earth in Exodus 19 when they heard the voice they are afraid in Exodus 19 they they felt like they couldn't endure in light of what was being spoken even said you know what I don't want to hear from God anymore amazing that they didn't want to hear direct from God they just get it they just wanted to hear it from Moses and just leave it at that we'll just take the letter of what Moses says they were afraid but now Hebrews 12 18 for ye are not come unto the mountain that might be touched or that burned with fire you're not come to blackness in Darkness Darkness and Tempest that's not what you've come to they came and they trembled and they were afraid and it shook and even Moses was exceedingly fearful and the Earth shook in the mountain Shook and he's saying God's going to speak again and there's going to be a word go Goes Forth and it's going to shake heaven and earth and there's going to be signs given and there's going to be things shaking and things happening and this word this voice yet again signifies the removing of things I was going to bring it out of uh Isaiah 4 and Malachi 3 but let me just say it this way there's a word that comes and separates it's a word that comes and takes away those things that can be shaken as things that are made so that things that are original can remain the things that have been added to can be shaken the very things that are in incomplete can be taken away so that the unshakable can remain and he says in verse 28 29 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace think of this this beautiful beautiful word wherefore we receive in a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace this is what we need let us have Grace so that we can whereby we may by this grace in this Kingdom serve God acceptably there's an acceptable way and then to do it with reverence and godly fear this should be a like a guiding thought to our lives that we've received a kingdom which cannot be moved therefore let me have Grace and I want to serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear they've got to have that reverence and godly fear one thing that I I trust that maybe you could say Amen to there's a lot of things Christians don't do because they fear God there's people you wouldn't speak against there's things you wouldn't do ways you wouldn't act not because you're afraid of getting exposed or afraid it's not going to work or afraid of man you just fear God too much you know that God's the judge of all and that if you presume and you venture out God at any moment can say oh yeah buddy you're on your own and so the fear of God is so important do we fear God enough to moderate our Behavior do we have enough Godly fear to change the way we live and the way that we Act is we ought to have Grace so that we can serve God acceptably I I believe that we're gonna we're gonna be challenged if we're not already being challenged let's not make the mistake of thinking that there's some sort of that it's some sort of either emotion or intellectual Revival that we kind of get caught up in in church becomes our touch base and our in our all hands on deck rally cry a couple times a week just to make sure we're all still in the same game listen this has gotta this is real this has got to come down to life this has gotta I I say it just from the bottom of my heart I need a God that's with me every day oh my I guess if we could just start some sort of Revival or whatever we're feeling depressed there's enough people here running around the auditorium and whooping it up say well I'm feeling down today I guess I'll just go by the church and whoop it up for a while you know that's what gems are for that's what that's what uh uh that's what CrossFit is what if you want a cult it's going to motivate you just join CrossFit but if I want something that's with me I want something real I want something that changes that changes the way that I raise my children and I'm able to overcome complexes and weaknesses and fears and and things that have been poured into me and things that I'm holding on to I want to be able to show Christ to my children I want to love my wife as Christ loves the church there's things that mean that should mean something to us I want to serve God acceptably he says for our God is a consuming fire and the very thing that the very thing that'll consume everything else is the very thing that delivers you the very thing that refines and purifies you very thing that causes people to shriek and run away and others to melt and others to cry out and and to be burned up it's the very thing that delivers you as those Hebrew children were thrown into a furnace heated seven times hotter than ever been burnt before it only slayed the men that threw him in and loose the bounds that held them our God is a consuming fire you I would encourage you to listen to one or all or read some of the sermons that brother Brown preached the world has again Fallen apart of the world has fallen apart he preaches it a few times multiple times more than three this statement the world is again falling apart he said we receive this Kingdom he's some other word both Heaven and Earth will pass away but this word shall never pass away and this word is the kingdom we may have been reading this already this is the king and the kingdom the system the life it's every bit right here and one of the things he's constantly referring to in the world has fallen upon is all the systems all the systems that people make to placate themselves or allay their fears or give them some sense well I've been accepted and you know I've been prayed out of purgatory I've lit the candles and I've been baptized in the Latter-Day Saints I've got all my bases covered and I choose Thursdays to kind of doubt things just in case the agnostics are right and on Saturdays I just completely deny it all so that at any given moment I've covered all my bases and all those systems won't work he says the word this is the king this word is the king the kingdom the system of life every bit of it right here and if I could say this as Paul said we receive in the Kingdom brother Branham in Christ The Mystery of God revealed his one is to recognize that the kingdom that the Christian church was looking for and the King that the Christian church was looking for was revealing himself to his word he says because our headship is a kingdom he's saying the headship is here the kingdom has come to us and we have received that immovable unshakable Kingdom we receive in a kingdom that cannot be moved he says this in response to the fact that there will be a voice that'll Shake Heaven and Earth pass away but my word will never pass away there'll be a shaking and things that both in heaven and things in Earth if they were made if they're impure if they're not part of the original they will vanish they will perish that those which cannot be shaken those things which cannot be shaken May remain to be shaken it's a it's a motion that's produced by an outside force some wind or storm or wave that something is buffeted and so it to be shaken means to be agitated right isn't this what we all say or maybe our grandparents say it when something happened and a car runs a red light and they almost get hit they go I'm shook right isn't that what the Boomers say something happens in it and it shakes them up oh I'm unsettled I'm agitated I'm stirred up it means the cost to Teeter taught her to move now think of that but there's a just whatever could be shaken it means to shake down or to overthrow the very word to be shaken it's to cause one to no longer be happy to cast down from a secure state of security to agitate the mind to disturb them whatever can be shaken will be shaken whatever can be agitated whatever can be stirred up will be stirred up oh I want to find that immovable he said we receive in a kingdom it's ought to be closed on this I'll invite our musicians to come brother Batman Christ is revealed in his own word there's some more statements maybe we'll read them on Wednesday he says now the stabilizers have been put on the ship We're not gonna we're not going down we're not going to be tossed about I I the the concept and the idea of wind of Doctrine has begun to become more pronounced to me in how that things blow through and things move and listen there's a wind of Doctrine and it blows through and there's people that Teeter on it right and and I realize there's people that lean into it and what are they doing they're just fighting the wind they're all being moved by it but I want to be unmovable let every wind of dark let it move it's not going to sway me I'm not going to change my orientation based upon the wind the way the winds are blowing oh you want to blow at me with that well and try to fight it again no I don't need to do that he says the stabilizers have been put on the ship great fearful waves are out here before us but we know just beyond that way of Yonder we're nearing the shore we're nearing the shore in other words it's that finish line that Paul talked about let us run with patience the race that is set before us he says just stay stabled just stay in the word he opened it by saying what he wanted to what he wanted to preach was something to stabilize just stay in the word stay with God no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the word we've been talking about this with with our children and just as a family discussing things the reason why we don't go by emotions is there's a lot of things even that are wonderful emotionally shouting dancing praising speaking in tongues all these things that you feel it these things are awesome but if that's your stability you don't always have it you may not you you may be one that loves to dance and shout and work it up and you can you can work in that way because you're natured that way and the holy spirit moves on you but if that's your time post where what are you when that's gone what are you when you're you don't have the emotions you don't have the one two you don't have the know-how so he says it's not what you feel stay right with the word let it stay stable when you see all those great big old clouds around us and storms coming and atomic bombs and everything else they're talking about yeah Hunter Biden or whatever else but our stabilizers right straight in the word [Music] God said it would be here and it is that's what he's saying God said it would be here could you see him just as Paul we're saying there God promised us the Messiah on Mount Sinai the law and the prophets pointed to a messiah he's like he's here God has spoken to us by his son whom the heavens must receive until the time appointed and the fullness of times this is this is what you ought to be looking to he says but our stabilizer is right straight in the word God said it would be here we'll Crest every one of them in the shore we won't be deterred we're not going to be rocking from side to side we're just gonna go right through it we're gonna Crest every one of them he says yeah we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us they can't drown us let me say that we have a voice behind us saying don't turn to the left don't turn to the right stay in line and we'll Crest every one of them he says the world has fallen apart but the kingdom of God Has Come now if I could say this this is controversial yeah for for a prophet amongst the denominations and amongst the theologians and everyone for him to say the kingdom of God has come that's controversial because even the Christians were wanting to put it off for some other day but he says the kingdom of God has come and we're sitting with the Messiah God's Messiah let's feed on that for a little bit that's where we are and let me say this be unshakable I'll just pick up on a Wednesday night Lord willing be unshakable be unmovable in this day and age that we're living I think more than anything that's what we crave so not be shaken little things come up little things happen you know what it feels like in your in your spirit you know when you've been agitated you know when it starts to affect you physically I'm talking about that that you who have had that Bedrock can find that you're so solidly anchored in the word of God he said I'm not going to be shaken because I found that which is unshakable please stand with me today God bless you [Music]
