[0:00] I'm going to try to jump right into this
[0:02] and and get going and see how far that
[0:04] we could get today if you could look
[0:07] just at this scripture that we just read
[0:09] I'll start just by pointing out a few
[0:11] things here as Paul is charging them
[0:14] that we could say are rich in this world
[0:16] I think it speaks to those who have some
[0:18] means or resources uh rich in in wealth
[0:21] and worldly things and not in
[0:24] worldliness or things that were are
[0:26] wicked uh but because they have these
[0:28] certain things and resources and wealth
[0:30] and money uh that they should not be
[0:32] high-minded or trust in those riches so
[0:35] you can see what it's referring to in
[0:37] these riches but they should trust in
[0:39] God this is a living God who gives us
[0:41] abundantly all things to enjoy so the
[0:45] things that we have we rejoice in them
[0:47] as from the Lord but we don't trust in
[0:48] them we trust in the Lord and then he
[0:51] says this is the charge to them that are
[0:53] rich uh not only that they trust in the
[0:56] Living God but they do good and they are
[0:58] rich in good works and ready to
[1:00] distribute of their wealth and their
[1:02] riches H and then it makes this
[1:04] statement in doing these things they are
[1:07] laying up in store for themselves a good
[1:10] foundation against the time to come that
[1:14] they may lay hold on eternal life and
[1:17] it's this phrase a good foundation I
[1:19] want to take that's my title today
[1:21] laying a good
[1:24] foundation and if you could just focus
[1:26] with me as we give that title laying a
[1:28] good foundation uh Focus because it
[1:30] builds on a lot of these other parts if
[1:32] you haven't heard any of the other parts
[1:33] you still can get a lot out of this but
[1:36] there's a lot of touch points that you
[1:37] could see um where these things are
[1:40] coming from in the subject of the house
[1:41] of the Lord so he says laying up in
[1:43] store for themselves a good foundation
[1:45] we're looking to ourselves really on our
[1:48] us laying a good foundation and when it
[1:51] says a good foundation that good there
[1:53] means beautiful it's choice or precious
[1:56] it's excellent excellent in its nature
[1:59] and care character it's useful it's
[2:01] suitable it's well adapted therefore
[2:03] it's approved so it's this is a sure
[2:06] foundation not just laying a foundation
[2:09] but laying a good foundation uh maybe
[2:11] there's something he could have said to
[2:13] say well you know do these things
[2:15] because it's it's it's it's a foundation
[2:17] but he wants to convey the idea that
[2:19] this is a not just a foundation but a
[2:23] good foundation which is excellent which
[2:25] is beautiful which is well suited for
[2:28] its purpose and a foundation is in Even
[2:33] in our word if we say Foundation it
[2:35] comes basically its roots is in a
[2:36] founding something that is beginning it
[2:39] comes from to lay the basis of or to
[2:41] establish something and we use
[2:44] Foundation to refer to the solid base of
[2:47] a structure so if there's a structure
[2:50] the foundation is that solid part that
[2:51] it rests upon and it doesn't really take
[2:54] much logic to realize that that would
[2:56] probably need to go first if there's a
[2:59] structure to be built built on it so
[3:00] it's the founding it's the beginning of
[3:02] something in 1 Corinthians 3:1 it says
[3:05] for other Foundation can no man lay than
[3:08] that is laid which is Jesus
[3:10] Christ now this is uh I know I'm using a
[3:14] familiar scripture we've already used a
[3:16] few times in the last few Services if
[3:18] Jesus Christ is the only foundation that
[3:21] can be laid how important is the
[3:23] foundation not just anything can be a
[3:25] foundation so this speaks to the
[3:27] importance of the foundation the
[3:30] founding or the beginning of something
[3:32] and this would go to anything that
[3:33] requires a foundation if Jesus Christ is
[3:36] the only foundation that could be laid
[3:38] then that tells us wow laying the
[3:40] foundation is very very critical as it
[3:43] says in Isaiah 28:16 therefore thus
[3:45] sayith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion
[3:48] for a foundation a stone for a beginning
[3:52] for a start a stone not just any stone a
[3:54] tried Stone and not just any Cornerstone
[3:57] a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation
[4:01] he that believeth shall not make haste
[4:02] shall not be confounded shall not be
[4:04] ashamed and so I will lay for an a a
[4:08] beginning a stone a tried Stone a
[4:11] precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation
[4:14] you could find where Jesus Christ fits
[4:16] this example he fits this prophecy not
[4:19] just the example but he fulfills this
[4:21] prophecy and so it's for foundation
[4:23] stone that's your foundation stone as
[4:26] they might say a setting Stone it's the
[4:28] very first stone that would be laid uh
[4:30] in a
[4:31] construction and in the construction of
[4:33] a foundation and then once you laid that
[4:36] Cornerstone or that setting Stone all
[4:37] other stones in the foundation
[4:39] everything else you do on the foundation
[4:41] is set in reference to it so as we said
[4:44] before it determines the position of the
[4:45] building it determines the strength of
[4:47] the entire structure it's a this
[4:49] foundation stone in this Foundation is
[4:51] very very
[4:53] critical now if you could turn your
[4:54] Bibles or turn your eyes to however it
[4:57] is you get the scriptures these days but
[4:58] in psalm
[5:00] 1045 it's speaking of the Lord in verse
[5:02] one it says bless the Lord oh my soul oh
[5:04] Lord my God Thou Art very great so this
[5:06] is a this declaration to the Lord and in
[5:09] these preceding verses there's it's
[5:11] about the creation and it says of God
[5:14] and this blessed Lord he says who laid
[5:16] the foundations of the earth that it
[5:18] should not be removed
[5:21] forever so the creation of the earth is
[5:24] in this verse is compared to the
[5:26] erecting a building on a solid
[5:28] foundation now we know
[5:30] that it's a much greater task but yet to
[5:34] draw on Human Experience he says I laid
[5:37] I laid the foundations of the earth and
[5:39] it gives this image of a building not
[5:41] that the Earth itself is sitting on some
[5:42] literal Foundation but it gives us an
[5:45] idea he founded the Earth on her basis
[5:48] on a basis or Foundation this is
[5:50] something that God has done in the
[5:52] beginning he created the heavens and the
[5:54] Earth he was laying foundations for it
[5:57] in the beginning that it should not be
[6:00] removed forever in job 38:
[6:04] 1-7 you'll recognize this scripture then
[6:06] the Lord answered job out of the
[6:08] Whirlwind and said who is this that
[6:10] darkeneth counsel by words without
[6:12] knowledge if you ever hear that you
[6:14] better you're you're you're being told
[6:17] something so he says G now G up now thy
[6:20] loins like a man for I will demand of
[6:23] thee and answer thou me so he's telling
[6:25] him to Lo up his GS as it might be said
[6:28] a and I'm going to demand of you you're
[6:30] going to have to answer me and then he
[6:31] says where was thou when I laid the
[6:34] foundations of the earth so God's the
[6:37] one that laid him he's even ascribing it
[6:39] to himself I laid the foundations of the
[6:41] Earth where were you when I did that you
[6:43] want to come to me talking you have all
[6:45] these questions to ask where were you
[6:47] when I laid the foundations of the earth
[6:48] declare if thou Hast understanding who
[6:51] hath laid the measures thereof if thou
[6:53] knowest the measures of what the
[6:55] foundation or who ha stretched the line
[6:57] upon it now he's using uh maybe an
[7:00] architectural engineering language and
[7:02] and a foundation that you're going to
[7:04] measure you're gon to you're going to
[7:05] check these things you're going to lay
[7:07] it out you're going to stretch the line
[7:08] upon it whereupon are the foundations
[7:11] thereof fastened or who laid the
[7:13] Cornerstone thereof when the morning
[7:16] Stars sang together and all the sons of
[7:18] God shouted for Joy now remember this as
[7:21] we continue as this is a setting before
[7:25] job this is a setting before creation he
[7:27] says where were you when I laid the
[7:29] foundation of the earth I laid the
[7:30] measures thereof I stretched out a l
[7:32] upon it whereupon are the foundations
[7:34] fashioned a and who laid the Cornerstone
[7:37] of that Foundation God saying I did
[7:39] that in the creation of the earth God
[7:42] established the Earth on a foundation as
[7:44] it says in Psalms that it should not be
[7:46] removed forever it's fast it's
[7:48] unmovable it it's secure it's fixed
[7:51] cannot be shaken out of its place now it
[7:53] may be shaken but it cannot be shaken
[7:56] out of its place it's fixed permanent
[7:58] solid and God laid it so it says the
[8:02] Earth is fixed firmly by his power and
[8:06] when it talks when it's wanting us to
[8:08] think about God's Providence and God's
[8:10] planning and how solid and firm the
[8:13] Earth is it's saying it's been fixed by
[8:16] his power and his power is manifested in
[8:20] his
[8:21] foundation I've laid the Earth on a
[8:23] foundation that it should not be removed
[8:26] forever it says in Isaiah 48:13 mind
[8:29] also hath laid the foundation of the
[8:31] Earth in my right hand hath spanned the
[8:34] heavens when I call unto them they stand
[8:36] up together he's not only the founder
[8:39] but he's the ruler he's the governor
[8:40] I've laid it upon the foundations I know
[8:42] how they work I have laid the
[8:44] foundations of the Earth where were you
[8:45] when I laid the foundations of the earth
[8:47] and laid the measures thereof and ran a
[8:49] lion upon it who laid the foundations of
[8:51] the earth that's God who did
[8:54] that Proverbs 8:29 when he gave the sea
[8:57] his decree that the waters should not
[8:59] pass his commandment when he appointed
[9:01] the foundations of the
[9:03] earth now at this point I want to make
[9:06] this
[9:08] point this is not this is not physical
[9:11] foundations though we could find
[9:13] firmament and things in reference to the
[9:14] Earth itself and uh the mountains
[9:17] underneath and the mountains above and
[9:18] certain things that uh relate to the
[9:20] creation of the earth I had some uh
[9:24] passages going to read about the pillars
[9:26] of Heaven and the pillars of the earth
[9:28] and what those things are
[9:29] that he's not just referring to physical
[9:32] pillars or physical foundations but when
[9:35] he appointed the foundations of the
[9:37] earth though there are is a physical
[9:39] manifestation of certain things and I've
[9:41] laid the foundations of the Earth where
[9:43] were you when I laid the foundations of
[9:45] the earth it's not we're not only
[9:46] thinking physical and I think this is
[9:48] important for us uh to catch this but
[9:50] it's the principles upon which it was
[9:53] constructed and and the laws by which
[9:56] it's governed I laid the foundation of
[9:58] the earth my right hath spanned the
[10:00] heavens when I call unto them they shall
[10:01] stand together I appointed the
[10:03] foundations of the earth it's not that
[10:05] he laid some concrete and he has the
[10:07] world sitting on some pillars literally
[10:10] but saying the Earth itself is uph it's
[10:13] upheld by a law that there are certain
[10:15] principles that I was using in creating
[10:17] and there's certain uh wisdom and there
[10:19] is are are laws that govern these things
[10:22] so a foundation isn't necessarily
[10:25] physical but it's
[10:27] wisdom says in Jeremiah 10:12 he hath
[10:31] made the Earth by his power he hath
[10:33] established the World by his wisdom and
[10:35] has stretched out the heavens by his
[10:37] discretion the foundations of creation
[10:40] represent God's wisdom the foundations
[10:43] of the earth represent God's power so
[10:45] who laid the foundations of the earth
[10:47] and who uh where were you when I laid
[10:49] them and what was the wisdom and what
[10:50] was the power I made the Earth by my
[10:52] power I've fixed it and established it
[10:54] by my wisdom so the foundation is made
[10:57] by his power that The Establishment the
[11:00] permanence of it is made by his wisdom
[11:02] and he just as his hand hath spanned the
[11:04] heavens and he says that my hand is
[11:06] stretched out uh by my discretion it's
[11:09] wisdom discretion discernment power that
[11:12] builds the
[11:13] foundation I mean let's just think of it
[11:15] if it's not wisdom that's doing it what
[11:17] good is it if it's not done in power
[11:20] what good is it it says in Proverbs 9:1
[11:22] wisdom hath builded her house sheath
[11:25] heun out her Seven Pillars that heun as
[11:28] we looked at in the beginning of the
[11:29] series it's cut out as a Mason cutting a
[11:32] stone and she's hewing out her pillars
[11:36] that guiding supporting strength that
[11:39] raises something
[11:41] up these pillars hold them up as it says
[11:44] in first Samuel 2 for the pillars of the
[11:46] Earth are the Lords and he hath set the
[11:49] world upon them as a house set upon
[11:52] pillars as a house set upon a foundation
[11:54] The Pillars of the Earth are the Lords
[11:56] and he set them as he built them he set
[11:58] the world the Earth and all Humanity
[12:00] upon it the foundations which God
[12:03] created the very foundations uh that he
[12:06] upholds and by these foundations he
[12:08] sustains the Earth and all creation and
[12:11] Mankind that that's what governs all
[12:13] creation that's why things are time
[12:15] that's why science calls it uh mother
[12:17] nature and different things that we can
[12:19] calculate because God has set these
[12:22] things in motion he's put it on some
[12:24] basis and I could continue Without End
[12:27] showing how the word demonst Ates over
[12:29] and over again the importance of
[12:32] Foundations and I can't think of any
[12:34] more greater things to point to other
[12:37] than the fact that there's no other F
[12:38] Foundation that can be laid than the
[12:40] Lord Jesus Christ that means it has to
[12:42] be the best it has to be the perfect it
[12:44] has to be Supreme it's the it's the most
[12:46] important thing and then God in creating
[12:49] the heavens and the Earth the language
[12:50] of the scripture continually repeatedly
[12:52] is the foundations of the earth not just
[12:54] the Earth but the foundations upon which
[12:56] it rest God did not have a creation with
[12:59] without basis he did not bring forth
[13:00] without basis he did it by power he did
[13:02] it by wisdom he did it by discretion and
[13:04] so therefore there are
[13:06] foundations that are the success to this
[13:12] creation do I have permission to
[13:14] continue we got that part okay we're
[13:16] doing good on time I think now this
[13:18] might seem a little bit of a a shift but
[13:21] as our Series has been on the house of
[13:22] the Lord I I kind of we'll dip into this
[13:25] so you can see how these things connect
[13:27] together in 2 Chronicles
[13:30] 3:1 if you could begin reading here with
[13:32] me and then we'll stay in Chronicles for
[13:34] a little bit and and and this could may
[13:38] slow down perhaps and start
[13:42] focusing on a very particular part and
[13:45] so I was just laying a
[13:47] foundation for this part and I hope it
[13:50] was a good one in 2 Chronicles 3:1 then
[13:54] Solomon began to build the house of the
[13:56] Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah
[13:59] where the Lord appeared unto David his
[14:01] father in the place that David had
[14:03] prepared in the threshing for of Orin
[14:06] the
[14:08] jebusite if I can say this we're now
[14:10] very specifically looking at the
[14:13] beginning of building the house of the
[14:16] Lord and in the is as I've studied the
[14:20] scriptures and just reading different
[14:22] things that are relating to foundations
[14:24] and beginnings and the it being
[14:26] established and being firmed and being
[14:27] fixed the foundation of the temple the
[14:29] house of the Lord and the foundations of
[14:31] the earth share similar descriptions
[14:34] things that are said about the
[14:35] foundations of the Earth are similar to
[14:36] the foundations of the temple and the
[14:39] building of the house of the Lord I'm
[14:41] using the house of the Lord as examples
[14:43] to us and we've already us several
[14:45] services in showing how the house of the
[14:47] Lord is used in different types and
[14:49] shadows and how that it relates to us
[14:52] the house of the Lord which we saw in
[14:54] the Tabernacle but then ultimately in
[14:56] that fixed place the temple uh they are
[14:58] a type of Christ so the house of the
[15:01] Lord is a type of Jesus Christ it was
[15:03] made in the pattern of Heaven it is even
[15:06] an image of Heaven and Earth as the Jews
[15:08] say the structure of the Tabernacle and
[15:09] the temple correspond to the structure
[15:12] of Heaven and Earth in the outer Court
[15:14] inner Court holy of holies there it's PL
[15:16] it shows the Plan of Redemption it shows
[15:18] the arrangements of Earth and Heaven and
[15:20] even the uh the Unseen heaven and so in
[15:24] the temple the house of the Lord it
[15:25] represents the individual you are
[15:27] pictured in that three room house and it
[15:29] represents the Church of God the body of
[15:31] Christ or we could say the bride so the
[15:34] house of the Lord is a real easy subject
[15:36] to get a lot of sermon material out of
[15:39] and that's not why we're doing it but we
[15:40] realize that you can get a lot of
[15:42] distance in using that but we want it to
[15:43] be applicable we want it to be relevant
[15:46] so as it says that solom begin to build
[15:49] the house of the Lord when it says he
[15:50] began to
[15:51] build the house of the Lord there's
[15:54] something that God will show us in the
[15:57] way the house of the Lord was built
[15:59] that's relevant to us who are a house of
[16:01] the Lord but then also those of us who
[16:03] are building a house making our houses
[16:05] homes part of the house of the Lord that
[16:07] we're that we're to look out after and
[16:08] looking out after one another the body
[16:10] of Christ which is the house of the Lord
[16:11] his Dwelling Place his
[16:13] body and so solom began to build the
[16:16] house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount
[16:18] Mariah I want to keep coming back to
[16:19] these phrases where the Lord appeared
[16:20] unto David his father in the place that
[16:22] David had prepared in the threshing
[16:25] floor of oron the jebusite so David
[16:28] hadn't prepared
[16:30] a a in this place and now salon's going
[16:33] to build on it now if you can look at 2
[16:35] Chronicles chapter 8 verse
[16:38] 16 I I want to refer to this very
[16:40] quickly hopefully come back to it at a
[16:42] later date now all the work of Solomon
[16:45] was prepared unto the day of the
[16:49] foundation of the house of the Lord and
[16:51] until it was finished so the house of
[16:55] the Lord was
[16:57] perfected incred statement it's
[16:59] Amplified elsewhere to understand just
[17:01] exactly what this means maybe we'll get
[17:03] into more of it later but let me say
[17:04] this all the work of SSM was prepared
[17:08] from the day of the foundation until it
[17:10] was finished in other words all the
[17:12] materials were acquired manufactured
[17:14] furnished
[17:16] beforehand he he didn't just start
[17:18] building with what he had on hand and
[17:20] hope that he could run into it later we
[17:22] built uh we built a fixer upper in Texas
[17:25] and and when we had the tile laid in the
[17:27] master bathroom
[17:29] uh the the tile guy had to go out and
[17:31] buy more tile and it wasn't until it was
[17:33] all done I was just looking I'm like
[17:35] this this tile's two different
[17:36] colors because when you when the tile
[17:39] goes into the Kil and when it's
[17:40] manufactured could be the same white or
[17:43] label white but different sets and
[17:46] different groupings and whatever they
[17:47] call them uh will have different
[17:50] different manufacturing dates and
[17:51] different chemical uh process that takes
[17:53] place it's a totally different color
[17:55] even though that's the only color they
[17:56] sell and so that would be a situation
[17:59] where you want to know how much tile you
[18:00] need in your master bath anybody taking
[18:02] notes how much tile you need in your
[18:04] master bathroom and buy it all at the
[18:06] same time so you have everything you
[18:07] need and it's all the same color and all
[18:09] the Builder
[18:11] said and so this is something that he
[18:13] had done he beforehand says I've got
[18:17] everything I need a lot of planning and
[18:19] preparation that went into this so I
[18:21] want to draw from this example for
[18:23] ourselves and for our homes and for us
[18:25] as Homemakers and home builders as
[18:27] brother bam said about ourselves were
[18:29] building the living Tabernacle of the
[18:30] living God's Dwelling Place the perfect
[18:32] man the living Tabernacle of the Living
[18:35] God where he dwells and he wasn't just
[18:37] talking about Jesus Christ he was
[18:39] talking about us so we are to be a a a
[18:42] spiritual house we're to be Lively
[18:44] stones in a spiritual building we are
[18:47] you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost so
[18:50] as Solomon began to build the house of
[18:52] Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah he it
[18:56] says that he was prepared s the work was
[18:58] prepared prepared furnished um acquired
[19:02] manufactured we know this from the
[19:03] teaching of the Bible things took place
[19:05] off
[19:06] site and then were brought to the site
[19:09] and then put
[19:10] together there was no waiting uh 13
[19:14] weeks for Windows or doors it was they
[19:17] had
[19:18] it I want to examine the background of
[19:21] this place that s begin to build on and
[19:25] what it represents for us I trust that
[19:28] you're kind of foll me step by step here
[19:31] Solomon began to build the house of the
[19:33] Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah now
[19:37] could have just moved on right we could
[19:38] have maybe skipped seven chapters and
[19:40] said and it was all prepared the house
[19:42] of the Lord was perfect and then move on
[19:43] right let's get to where good the good
[19:46] stuff starts happening like Ehud and
[19:47] things you know let's get let's get to
[19:49] exciting things Kings fighting in Wars
[19:51] but it gives us all these details and it
[19:53] says this about this site this place
[19:55] where the Lord apped to David his father
[19:57] and the place that David had prepared in
[19:58] the threshing floor so it says in 1st
[20:01] Chronicles 21:18 that's before 2
[20:04] Chronicles so if you found that it's not
[20:06] hard to find the
[20:07] first 1 Chronicles 21:18 then the angel
[20:11] of the Lord commanded Gad this is the
[20:13] prophet now to say to David that David
[20:16] the Lord is saying this that David
[20:17] should go up and set up an altar unto
[20:20] the Lord in the threshing floor of ornon
[20:22] the
[20:23] jebusite this is the sight of the house
[20:26] of the
[20:27] Lord and this is where Solomon is going
[20:31] to build the
[20:32] temple and God is telling a prophet to
[20:36] have David the king go build an altar on
[20:40] that very site the Tabernacle I believe
[20:43] it's in gibian at this
[20:45] time it is it's the Tabernacle in the
[20:47] wilderness and now David is being told
[20:50] by the prophet God wants him to go to
[20:52] this very specific Place go to the
[20:55] threshing floor of or and the jebusite
[20:57] go to that very spot and I want you to
[20:59] build an altar there now God didn't just
[21:02] check um altar BNB a a and just find out
[21:05] which one's available right where could
[21:08] we where oh well you know oron's got got
[21:10] a good listing here uh and he gets back
[21:13] to you in about an hour so let's just
[21:14] see if we can't book a sacrifice uh uh
[21:17] in the threshing floor of Orin good
[21:18] pictures good ratings good reviews God
[21:21] chose it for a reason not just because
[21:23] it was available now this is where I
[21:26] hope to emphasize this and we're going
[21:27] to get somewhere some where in this as
[21:29] far as us both the act of building the
[21:31] Altar and the worship that proceedes
[21:34] there and the location of it God intends
[21:38] to express great truths not just
[21:40] historical facts but principles for us
[21:43] living today it's going to reflect
[21:45] things about Jesus Christ it's going to
[21:47] reflect things about what he does for us
[21:49] it's going to reflect things what we
[21:50] ought to be doing as his servants the
[21:54] threshing floor let let's just start
[21:56] with
[21:57] that he said to go set up an altar in
[22:00] the threshing floor so he could just
[22:02] said go to the land of orn and with the
[22:04] plot that he owns but he wants him to go
[22:05] to the threshing threshing floor to do
[22:08] so and this was a very hard flat surface
[22:12] that was used to break the chaff and the
[22:15] sheaves from the seed so you would
[22:17] Harvest Grain and you would and you'd
[22:19] have things that we would Harvest and
[22:21] then you would use this
[22:22] ground as the as the foundation to
[22:25] separate the sheaves and the chaff the
[22:28] husk the Shu from the seed you want to
[22:32] get to the seed you want to get to the
[22:33] grain there had to be a place to prepare
[22:35] that now I just want to reference this
[22:37] I'm not going to try to teach this if
[22:39] you if you want to reject this it's fine
[22:42] but this threshing floor symbolizes the
[22:44] separation of righteousness from
[22:46] unrighteousness it's the separation of
[22:49] righteousness from wickedness so it's
[22:51] what he says go to the threshing floor
[22:53] this the threshing floor carries it with
[22:55] its symbol uh symbolism it speaks of
[22:58] something of purification in judgment a
[23:01] shuck is being separated a chaff the the
[23:04] the husk all these things the sheaves
[23:05] are being separated so this is this is
[23:08] Judgment this is
[23:10] separation and this this threshing floor
[23:12] is located on the Harvest field it it's
[23:16] there and it's meticulously leveled
[23:18] they' use a cylindrical block and they
[23:20] would level it and they would use chalk
[23:22] and they would compact it in order to
[23:24] keep the weeds out and and keep it in
[23:26] such a way to where if there was an
[23:27] extensive drought it still would be even
[23:29] and firm it wouldn't be cracking and
[23:31] unleveled so they were very meticulous
[23:33] about keeping the weeds out keeping it
[23:35] flat and level no cracks uh watered just
[23:38] right because this is the this is where
[23:40] they would come to that final stage of
[23:41] the Harvest now those of you who like
[23:44] the types and shadows you can go ahead
[23:46] and start getting
[23:48] Giddy and maybe I'll tickle that itch a
[23:50] little bit here and Ruth 3: 1 to3 this
[23:54] is where we see a very striking uh
[23:58] represent presentation of this threshing
[24:01] floor that remember this that David is
[24:04] going to come back
[24:06] to that a threshing floor that David not
[24:09] that not so David's going to come to a
[24:11] threshing floor and now look at this
[24:12] threshing floor who is in the lineage of
[24:15] these characters here what it represents
[24:17] and symbolizes in his lineage then Naomi
[24:19] her mother-in-law said unto Ruth my
[24:22] daughter shall I not seek rest for thee
[24:24] that it may be well with thee and now is
[24:27] not Boaz of our k
[24:29] with whose maidens thou was and so we
[24:31] realize that this is after in Chapter 2
[24:33] where he had shown her great favor and
[24:34] kindness and where did you get all this
[24:36] grain if you stolen he like no this guy
[24:38] Boaz he's taking a Lykan to me and she's
[24:40] saying this isn't your near
[24:42] kizman and so this is what she says
[24:45] behold he went with barley tonight in
[24:48] the threshing
[24:49] floor here's the lord of the Harvest
[24:51] here's the owner here's the richest man
[24:55] and he is on the threshing floor
[24:59] winnowing The Barley that
[25:01] night and N he says wash thyself catch
[25:05] these things before you when you come to
[25:07] this threshing floor wash yourself
[25:09] anoint thee and put thy rment upon thee
[25:11] and get thee down to the floor but n
[25:13] make nelf not known unto the man until
[25:15] he shall have done eating and
[25:17] drinking the winnowing was the final
[25:20] stage of this
[25:21] Harvest uh there would be a crushing and
[25:25] there would be a breaking up and then
[25:26] there would be winnowed and it would be
[25:27] done at night and the owner even the
[25:31] owner would remain all night during the
[25:33] Harvest Time not only because the Grain
[25:35] and they speculate because the grain was
[25:37] valuable but the winds were also
[25:38] suitable and the work needed to be done
[25:42] and so here is Boaz the near Kinsman the
[25:45] kinsman redeemer on the threshing floor
[25:48] and Ruth the Gentile has got to come to
[25:50] the threshing floor to meet the master
[25:53] of the Harvest in that final stage of
[25:55] the Harvest in the final stage of the
[25:57] separation
[25:58] for her to be redeemed so the flesh the
[26:02] threshing floor it represents
[26:04] purification it represents judgment but
[26:07] it also represents Redemption because
[26:10] here's Boaz the Redeemer and Ruth types
[26:12] of Christ in the Gentile bride and and a
[26:16] beautiful picture of the Rapture at at
[26:18] the nighttime at the ending of the
[26:20] Harvest in the last stage of the
[26:23] separation of the seed from the Shu and
[26:25] that Harvest Time Our Redeemer comes to
[26:28] the threshing floor Our Redeemer comes
[26:31] to the testing ground Our Redeemer
[26:33] Christ Our Boaz appears and we come to
[26:36] him in the final stages of the
[26:39] winnowing in the final separation there
[26:42] on the threshing floor was
[26:45] Redemption you know how the penan
[26:48] fathers and The Poets wrote of how for
[26:51] Christ's sake Ruth was drawn to the
[26:53] threshing
[26:54] floor and laid at the feet of
[26:57] Boaz that night on the threshing floor
[27:00] to show Christ to show
[27:02] Redemption and this is the ground that
[27:05] the prophet tells David he wants this is
[27:08] the type of ground that the prophet
[27:09] tells David he wants him to go to the
[27:11] threshing floor of Orin the
[27:14] jebusite there was a threshing floor
[27:17] there in the days of
[27:19] Boaz the threshing floor in
[27:23] Bethlehem but now this threshing
[27:26] floor just as Christ was born
[27:29] in a stable in Bethlehem he's going to
[27:30] be the king of
[27:33] Jerusalem now he's told to come to a
[27:35] threshing floor of ornon the jebusite at
[27:39] Jerusalem in Mount
[27:41] Mariah and the reason that God calls him
[27:44] this is 1st Chronicles 21:18 if we go
[27:47] back to the first verse of 1 Chronicles
[27:49] chapter 21 verse one's not hard to find
[27:52] it's before Verse 18 so if you found
[27:54] that one you'll be able to back up a
[27:55] little bit to this one it says and Satan
[27:57] stood up against Israel and provoke
[28:00] David to number Israel so a little bit
[28:03] of testing to David a little bit of
[28:04] pushing a little bit of
[28:05] trying and David is tempted and he's
[28:09] provoked David is provoked and he
[28:11] numbers Israel at Satan's testing and it
[28:15] says in verses 78 and God was displeased
[28:18] with this thing therefore he smok Israel
[28:22] and now David recognizes this in verse
[28:24] eight and David said to God I've sinned
[28:26] greatly because I've done this thing but
[28:28] now I beseech thee do away the iniquity
[28:30] of thy servant for I have done very
[28:33] foolishly then God gives them choices
[28:36] well okay I'll give you choices you
[28:39] choose which way what I do and how I
[28:41] deal with this and whatever you choose
[28:44] I'll do so in verse 15 doing this for
[28:47] time sake skipping down he says and God
[28:49] sent an angel un Jerusalem to destroy it
[28:52] this is upon David's
[28:54] decision and now God sends the angel
[28:57] upon on Jerusalem to destroy and as he
[28:59] was destroying the Lord beheld and He
[29:02] repented him of the evil and said to the
[29:04] angel that destroy it is enough stay now
[29:07] thy
[29:08] hand and the angel of the Lord stood by
[29:11] the threshing floor of Orin the
[29:13] jebusite now the when God tells and I
[29:17] know I I know maybe one person's going
[29:19] to think well why didn't you just start
[29:20] at the beginning and we all wouldn't be
[29:21] like why why the threshing floor but the
[29:25] the very place that David is asked to go
[29:27] and build and set up the altars the very
[29:29] place this Angel Of Destruction with his
[29:32] sword drawn is
[29:34] standing the very one that is
[29:37] smiting
[29:38] Jerusalem and the angel stood by the
[29:40] threshing floor of or the jebusite and
[29:42] David lifted up his eyes and saw the
[29:44] angel Lord stand between the Earth and
[29:47] Heaven what a what an incredible image
[29:50] there on the threshing floor of Orin
[29:52] stands the Judgment angel of God with
[29:54] his Thorn drawn standing between Heaven
[29:57] and Earth
[29:58] on this very spot having a sword drawn
[30:01] in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem
[30:04] then David and the Elders of Israel who
[30:05] were clothed and sackcloth fell upon
[30:07] their faces and now watch what this does
[30:10] this image of this one standing on the
[30:13] threshing floor and a and a sword held
[30:15] out over Jerusalem standing between
[30:17] Heaven and Earth what a scene and David
[30:19] said unto God is it not I that commanded
[30:22] the people to be numbered even I it is
[30:25] that hath sinned and done evil indeed
[30:28] but as for these sheep what have they
[30:30] done oh this is a real king this is a
[30:33] real Shepherd this is a real leader
[30:35] maybe initially he said oh do whatever
[30:37] you want God but don't let me fall into
[30:39] the hands of the enemy he was more
[30:40] concerned about how it would look if he
[30:42] got captured by the enemy how it would
[30:43] look if his armies failed but now it
[30:45] Dawns on him why why would I want the
[30:48] Sheep to
[30:50] suffer it was me who sinned I was I'm
[30:53] the king I'm the one that did it these
[30:55] sheep what have they done let thine hand
[30:58] and I pray thee oh Lord my God be on
[31:01] me and on my father's house but not on
[31:05] thy people that they should be
[31:07] plagued I I want I want to say that's
[31:09] the image of a
[31:11] king that's the image of a a priest king
[31:14] that's the image of one who's going to
[31:16] take responsibility as this judgment
[31:17] angel stands on the threshing floor of
[31:19] ornin the jebusite his sword stretched
[31:21] out over Jerusalem he's seen the curse
[31:23] he's seen the plague a and David in the
[31:25] way is responsible for it he's guilty
[31:28] and people are going to suffer and he
[31:29] finally says you know what don't let the
[31:30] family suffer don't let everybody else
[31:32] suffer don't let the Israel suffer
[31:34] Jerusalem I'm the one that's guilty let
[31:36] me
[31:37] suffer so David
[31:40] repents David takes personal ownership
[31:42] of this situation he's taking
[31:44] responsibility and then as soon as David
[31:46] repents it's as we just read to verse 17
[31:49] it's at that very moment that the angel
[31:51] Lord commands the prophet to say to
[31:52] David that he should go and set up an
[31:54] altar unto the Lord in the threshing
[31:56] floor of or and the sight and me we
[31:59] might think oh good but there's an angel
[32:01] of death standing there with the
[32:04] sword and David is told to go to that
[32:07] place to build an altar on the threshing
[32:10] floor the place where
[32:13] God by his Angel appeared in judgment
[32:16] and
[32:17] wrath come to this
[32:20] place therefore when God tells David to
[32:23] come to the threshing floor which we've
[32:25] touched on it could be looked at as as
[32:27] sanctification and purification and
[32:29] judgment
[32:30] separation all these different images
[32:32] that come before
[32:34] us there on the threshing floor where
[32:37] this Angel stood it was the proper
[32:39] meeting place for
[32:41] repentance it was the place that he had
[32:43] to come and start to satisfy God's
[32:48] Wrath I was going to use this statement
[32:50] a little bit later on in the sermon but
[32:52] it says in the Statue of a perfect man
[32:54] which is just ties all together with
[32:55] these themes building this Monument
[32:58] building the stature it starts off with
[33:00] the foundation stone
[33:02] Faith there's got to be a place that you
[33:05] begin there's got to be a starting point
[33:08] and here David in this time of judgment
[33:10] in this plague this Angel is standing
[33:13] there in this very specific location and
[33:16] he says David go there and build an
[33:18] altar and that that was inviting him to
[33:21] come to a place of judgment a place to a
[33:24] place of giving and it might seem to be
[33:26] a dreadful place but God is inviting him
[33:28] to come to that place and in the sermon
[33:30] the unfailing realities of God brother
[33:32] man says before you can ever get started
[33:34] right you got to get on the right
[33:36] foundation remember Solomon began to
[33:38] build the house of the Lord where on
[33:40] this very place that David's coming to
[33:42] on this very place where this Death
[33:44] Angel if we could say it that way stood
[33:46] Between Heaven and Earth with his sword
[33:48] held out over Jerusalem and stops David
[33:51] sees it he repents God says go to that
[33:54] spot and offer build an altar and offer
[33:58] sacrifice or it says set up an altar
[34:01] maybe the rest is implied in this moment
[34:04] and brother BR says before you could
[34:05] ever get started you got to get on the
[34:06] right
[34:07] foundation so when Solomon began to
[34:09] build the house of the Lord he had to
[34:10] start on the right foundation brother is
[34:12] pointing to In this passage what's the
[34:14] right foundation he says Pentecost and
[34:15] this is what he means by Pentecost what
[34:18] kind of foundation you going to lay
[34:19] Peter you got the keys to Heaven he said
[34:22] repent every one of you and be baptized
[34:24] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[34:25] remission of sins and you shall receive
[34:27] the the same Holy Ghost the promises to
[34:30] every generation that will follow
[34:31] afterwards to your children and to them
[34:32] that's a far off as many as the Lord Our
[34:35] God shall call that means not one stone
[34:39] in the temple of the Lord will not will
[34:41] be outside of this Foundation the
[34:43] foundation of repentance and the Seal of
[34:45] God the foundation of repentance and the
[34:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost but says
[34:49] there's the foundation if God is going
[34:52] to build his church Upon This Rock will
[34:54] I build my church it's on the foundation
[34:56] of Pentecost what's P PC is it shouting
[34:58] is it dancing oo this sounds really
[35:00] exciting what is it it is to repent and
[35:02] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[35:03] Jesus Christ Pentecost is the holy ghost
[35:06] coming and sealing the soul of the
[35:08] believer in a new birth that's the
[35:11] foundation outside of that you're you're
[35:13] not a
[35:15] temple before you ever can get started
[35:18] you got to get on the right foundation
[35:20] David coming to the threshing floor to
[35:23] build an altar signifies this starting
[35:26] point to Faith this Foundation of being
[35:28] born again this Foundation of
[35:31] repentance and this Foundation that you
[35:34] know David being invited had Faith to
[35:37] believe he was going he was
[35:39] forgiven this invitation to
[35:42] offer verse 21 1st Chronicles chapter 1
[35:45] verse
[35:46] 21 we're just in
[35:51] this still my image
[35:54] is where Solomon began to build the
[35:57] house of the Lord why on the threshing
[36:01] floor now David is told to come to this
[36:05] plot this spot now we already know this
[36:08] spot's going to be where the house of
[36:09] the Lord's built so we we kind of have
[36:10] this advantage point of going wow we
[36:13] know what's going to happen so when you
[36:14] look at this history like this is pretty
[36:18] significant what what is what does a
[36:20] site represent how how did it come to be
[36:23] the very place that God was going to
[36:24] build the house of the
[36:25] Lord and it says in David came to oron
[36:29] oron looked and saw David and went out
[36:32] of the threshing
[36:34] floor and bowed himself to David with
[36:36] his face to the ground and so there it
[36:38] would be an open area but yet there' be
[36:40] a covering over it and it'd be open on
[36:43] the sides he sees David coming there's
[36:45] Orin this is his land and where is he on
[36:47] the threshing
[36:49] floor and he bows himself to David with
[36:52] his face to the ground and then David
[36:53] said to ornin grant me the place of this
[36:56] threshing floor
[36:58] that I may build an altar therein unto
[37:00] the
[37:01] Lord now David's the king and he's
[37:03] saying Grant it now we could just stop
[37:05] there and be like that's right you give
[37:07] it to me but he says Thou shalt Grant it
[37:09] to me for the full
[37:11] price this is where you I really want
[37:14] you to focus and stay with me I've been
[37:16] putting in Pillars and laying a
[37:18] foundation and this this sermon is kind
[37:20] of like a Min sermon this this is a
[37:21] sermon within a sermon within a sermon
[37:23] this is very meta now look at what this
[37:26] rest upon says Thou shalt Grant it to me
[37:29] for the full price that the plague may
[37:32] be stayed from the people I want this
[37:35] land to build an altar but I don't want
[37:37] you giving me a deal I don't want to
[37:39] lease it I don't want to borrow it I
[37:42] want to buy it I don't want to buy it
[37:44] cheaply I want to pay the full price I
[37:47] don't want anyone to question my right
[37:49] to have it I don't want anyone to say
[37:50] this is not good ground whatever it's
[37:53] worth I want to pay for it Hallelujah an
[37:56] or S to David take it to thee other
[37:58] words I'll give it to you and let my
[38:00] Lord the king do that which is good in
[38:01] his eyes lo I give thee The Oxen also
[38:04] for burnt offerings and the threshing
[38:06] instruments for wood and the wheat for
[38:08] the meat offering I give it all woo
[38:10] let's preach a sermon on
[38:12] Orin hey say oh you can have it all
[38:16] whatever you need I'll just give it to
[38:18] you and the King David said to Orin
[38:21] nolu Hallelujah but I will verily buy it
[38:25] for the full price
[38:28] for I will not take that which is thine
[38:31] for the Lord nor offer burnt offerings
[38:34] without
[38:36] cost wo Hallelujah am what is this
[38:41] showing David could have been given it
[38:44] without paying for it Jesus is tempted
[38:47] this trid stone is tempted I'll give you
[38:50] all the kingdoms of the earth if you'll
[38:52] just Bow Down and Worship and he says
[38:54] I'm not going to take him without a
[38:55] price I'm not going to take them without
[38:58] paying a full price for
[39:00] it and when it came to building this
[39:03] altar on that ground David recognize are
[39:06] you listening this is an example to us
[39:09] as the house of the Lord this is an
[39:10] example for us who are building houses
[39:12] into HS there could be no
[39:16] shortcuts he could not cut Corners he
[39:18] could not accept
[39:20] deals he could not ask other people to
[39:23] do the
[39:24] work he could not borrow he could not go
[39:27] off of the the oron had labored and
[39:30] acquired Orin had used and bought or
[39:32] could not say well he could not say well
[39:34] I'll just use your aux and I'll just use
[39:35] your W wood and rely upon someone else's
[39:38] work David as the one that was having to
[39:40] build the altar said I've got to buy it
[39:42] I got to procure it I got an own it that
[39:44] even comes to the wood that's going to
[39:45] be burned to the oxin that'll be
[39:47] sacrificed to The Barley that'll be used
[39:49] in what kind of grain offering let me
[39:51] buy all that I as the worshipper I as
[39:54] the Builder I've got to pay the price
[39:59] this is what he has to do for the
[40:01] threshing floor now I want to join this
[40:03] with 1st Chronicles 8:16 and we'll maybe
[40:05] get into this more at a later date not
[40:07] today don't get nervous but in First
[40:09] Kings 5: 17 and 18 and the King
[40:13] commanded and they brought great Stones
[40:15] costly stones and huge stones to lay the
[40:18] foundation of the house they didn't just
[40:21] bring
[40:22] Stones great Stones they didn't get a
[40:25] good deal on it costly Stones they
[40:28] weren't raw they were hee to lay the
[40:31] foundation of the house and Solomon's
[40:33] Builders and herm's Builders did Hue
[40:35] them and the stone
[40:36] cores so they prepared Timber and stones
[40:39] to build the
[40:41] house later in chapter 7 it says the
[40:43] foundation was of costly Stones even
[40:46] great
[40:48] Stones when it speaks in Revelations
[40:50] about the New Jerusalem the foundation
[40:52] is not adorned with these precious
[40:55] stones it is
[40:57] those precious
[40:59] stones costly price a price to be paid
[41:04] work to be done so just as Solomon is
[41:07] laying the foundation on this very site
[41:11] this place of the threshing floor David
[41:13] is
[41:14] already he's already going and paying a
[41:17] price he's buying it full price and all
[41:20] the instruments thereof it says in verse
[41:22] 25 of 1 Chronicles 21 so David gave to
[41:26] Orin for the place 600 shekels of gold
[41:30] by
[41:31] weight and David built there an altar un
[41:33] the Lord and offered burnt offerings and
[41:36] peace offerings and called upon the
[41:39] Lord and He the Lord answered him from
[41:42] Heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt
[41:46] offering this is this is a very special
[41:49] happening if you want to take time to go
[41:51] read about it and consider these prior
[41:54] instances that could be referenced and
[41:55] here the king is offering a this
[41:57] sacrifice upon the Lord's command in
[41:59] obedience to the prophet not in
[42:01] Disobedience but in
[42:02] obedience and now after he's offered
[42:05] burnt offerings and peace offerings this
[42:07] is his
[42:08] repentance this is that the wrath of God
[42:11] would be satisfied the Lord commanded
[42:12] the angel and he put up his sword again
[42:15] under the sheath
[42:17] thereof it's now David had come to that
[42:20] place where this Angel
[42:21] is he risk it all he builds the altar he
[42:26] offers the burnt offerings in the peace
[42:27] offerings and when he does God sends his
[42:30] fire upon it and he tells the angel put
[42:33] your sword up my judgment's passed you
[42:36] see the picture you see what this means
[42:38] for us our threshing floor our Christ
[42:40] Our
[42:41] Redeemer and that time when David saw
[42:43] that the Lord had answered him in the
[42:45] threshing floor of or and the jebusite
[42:47] then he sacrificed there now watch this
[42:51] he's offered burnt offerings and peace
[42:53] offerings but now that he has been
[42:56] received he offers up sacrifice it's
[42:59] what we do right as Believers now that
[43:01] we've been received offer up yourselves
[43:03] as your bodies as a a sacrifice which is
[43:05] your reasonable service we offer up our
[43:07] lives to him it says he offers up the
[43:10] sacrifice in the threshing floor it
[43:12] keeps telling us where he's at let's
[43:14] just remember where is he at where is he
[43:15] at it's in this place well what happened
[43:18] what's what's going on in this place
[43:20] well this is the place that David had to
[43:21] buy this is the place that this Angel is
[43:23] standing and later on this is the very
[43:26] place it's not just going to to be an
[43:27] altar that's built but it's going to be
[43:29] the very Temple the very house of the
[43:31] Lord and then it says at this very
[43:33] moment as David is there sacrificing and
[43:36] David offers up sacrifice why why didn't
[43:38] he go to the Tabernacle for the
[43:40] Tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made
[43:42] in the wilderness and the altar of the
[43:44] burnt offering were at that season in
[43:47] the high place at
[43:48] gibian but David could not go before it
[43:51] to inquire of God for he was afraid
[43:53] because of the sword of the Angel of the
[43:56] Lord
[43:58] God
[43:59] allowed it explains to us why David
[44:01] wouldn't go there because that's what
[44:02] you where you would expect this
[44:04] sacrifice to be offered it's kind of
[44:06] showing us now in such a contrast to
[44:09] what would have been expected or even
[44:11] what would have been required that David
[44:13] is asked to build an altar he offers
[44:14] burnt offerings and peace offerings now
[44:16] he's sacrificing God is signifying a
[44:18] change from the Tabernacle in the
[44:20] wilderness to the
[44:21] temple cuz now he's saying the
[44:23] Tabernacle Lord is of the Wilderness is
[44:25] at in gibian David was afraid go there
[44:27] so this is why he offers sacrifice David
[44:30] is now offering sacrifice on the very
[44:32] spot where he would build his house
[44:35] because he says in Exodus about this
[44:37] Tabernacle of witness make them have
[44:39] them make me a sanctuary that I may
[44:40] dwell among them build me a house so
[44:43] that I can live with you and Solomon and
[44:44] David are saying why would God live in a
[44:46] tent and I dwell in a house let us build
[44:49] him a house that has a foundation let us
[44:51] build him a a a very specific place
[44:53] where God could live that's what the
[44:55] house of the Lord was no longer a tent
[44:58] and a tabernacle of witness now it's the
[45:00] temple and it was going to be built on
[45:02] this very Place God was moving from it
[45:06] God was moving into that mountain God
[45:08] was going to go from the heights of
[45:10] gibian to this place this molten pillar
[45:13] called Mount Mariah God was going to
[45:15] come to this pillar of Heaven God was
[45:17] going to come to this pillar of the
[45:20] earth Solomon begin to build the house
[45:22] of the Lord at
[45:24] Jerusalem in Mount Mar
[45:28] this place Mount
[45:30] Mariah it represents the
[45:35] beginning the side of the foundation of
[45:37] the house Solomon began to build the
[45:39] house at Jerusalem but not just
[45:42] Jerusalem in Mount
[45:45] Mariah there's some zip codes that are
[45:48] preferable sometimes people looking they
[45:50] looking for certain zip codes but then
[45:52] when you really get down you realize
[45:53] it's not just the ZIP code it's got to
[45:54] be the area and then it's got to be the
[45:56] subdivision and then it's got to be this
[45:58] one it can't just be you just don't want
[46:01] to live in Phoenix you want to live in
[46:02] Arcadia you just don't want to live in
[46:03] you don't really want to live in
[46:04] Scottdale you want to live in uh
[46:06] Paradise Valley or Fountain Hills or
[46:08] something you want to get you want to
[46:08] start narrowing it down right there
[46:11] there's there's this is where he says
[46:13] not not just Jerusalem but in Mount
[46:15] Mariah I know we've covered this even
[46:18] for several places and several different
[46:20] times even just recently in this but
[46:22] Mount
[46:22] Mariah now that's a place that's
[46:26] significant
[46:28] the Jews believed the temple was built
[46:31] on the very spot that Abraham offered up
[46:33] Isaac unto God Genesis chapter 22 he
[46:37] says take thy son thy only son Isaac
[46:39] whom you love get thee into the land of
[46:41] Mariah and offer him there for a burnt
[46:44] offering upon one of the mountains which
[46:46] I will tell thee of and what was this
[46:48] mount it was Mariah Mount Mariah is
[46:51] where it took place to the Jews it was
[46:53] the very center of
[46:55] creation because in the center of Mount
[46:57] Mariah they believed was the foundation
[46:59] stone of
[47:01] creation now remember for us the
[47:03] foundation stone is Faith remember the
[47:05] foundation stone is Christ we see all
[47:07] these images and so God in planning for
[47:10] the natural
[47:12] Temple I want to just transition very
[47:14] quickly try to finish this here very
[47:16] soon here God tells so is Solomon is
[47:19] going to build the temple on the
[47:21] threshing floor in Mount
[47:25] Mariah and before that David Builds an
[47:28] altar in that very spot that God told
[47:30] him to do it and then before that God
[47:33] told Abraham to come to this very place
[47:36] to offer up Isaac on this very spot and
[47:40] to the Jews they believe that when God
[47:42] created it was the very spot where he
[47:45] started right the foundation stone of
[47:49] creation and therefore if I could put it
[47:51] this way the foreign knowledge of God is
[47:53] demonstrated in his founding
[47:55] acts that if God was going to build a
[47:58] temple he tells Abraham to go there
[48:00] beforehand and offer up Isaac what a
[48:03] type he tells David to go there in a
[48:05] time of a plague and offer up to build
[48:08] an altar and now he tells Solomon to
[48:10] build it in Mount Mariah and all these
[48:12] different images start coming before us
[48:15] the four knowledge of God is
[48:16] demonstrated in his founding acts if we
[48:18] come back to this thought that in the
[48:20] very beginning when he laid the
[48:22] foundations of the earth there was a
[48:24] place that to the Jews they believed was
[48:26] the first
[48:28] stone and it's at that spot that
[48:31] beginning point that Abraham comes back
[48:33] and
[48:34] sacrifices that David comes back and
[48:37] sacrifices that Solomon builds the
[48:40] temple and as I'm wanting you to catch
[48:42] an example of yourself brother bam says
[48:43] in God's only provided place of worship
[48:46] he's talking about then a new creation
[48:47] This Is Us you got to see yourself in
[48:49] this provided place not a denomination
[48:51] but to the
[48:53] word you are a creation of the word
[48:56] because the foundation stone was laid in
[48:59] you before the foundation of the world
[49:02] predestinated to be Sons and Daughters
[49:04] of God and upon this Cornerstone come
[49:08] this upon this come Stone upon Stone in
[49:11] each age to vindicate that word that's
[49:14] coming up just exactly as Jesus did in
[49:16] his age which is the Capstone of it all
[49:18] I know that paints a pretty big picture
[49:20] but just think how he said that in you
[49:22] he laid the foundation stone the
[49:24] Cornerstone before the world was created
[49:27] as he did that for us by his far
[49:29] knowledge laid in you the foundation
[49:31] stone could we not believe that God so
[49:34] youw even in the earth that God by his
[49:36] for knowledge was laying things in the
[49:38] earth and we see whether it be by type
[49:40] or just a faith of the tradition of the
[49:43] Jews that there was a stone laid in
[49:45] Mount Mariah there was a stone first
[49:48] before the mountain came to be around it
[49:50] this Stone was the beginning
[49:52] stone that God allowed to be pushed up
[49:55] there before the foundation of the world
[49:56] he said Upon This Rock will I build my
[49:58] house Upon This Rock will I build my
[50:01] church Upon This Rock will there be a
[50:03] dwelling place where I can dwell that's
[50:05] where the Temple of the Lord will be and
[50:06] then he laid before the foundation what
[50:09] he laid in
[50:10] me a foundation
[50:14] stone the foundation where the house of
[50:18] the Lord would be
[50:20] built and this Foundation is
[50:25] significant
[50:31] in Psalms
[50:33] 871 speaking of God it says his
[50:36] foundation is in the Holy
[50:39] mountains his
[50:41] foundation the one that he
[50:43] lays the what he established the one
[50:45] that he set
[50:47] forth as the Jews write about this Mount
[50:51] Mariah here Adam came into
[50:54] being about this side of this threshing
[50:57] floor about this Stone here Abraham
[50:59] Isaac and Jacob served God here the
[51:03] first and second temples were built upon
[51:05] this mountain the Ark of the Covenant
[51:07] was set upon the foundation stone
[51:13] itself that when they this is to the
[51:15] Jews that's what they believe in that
[51:16] Temple the very Ark of the Covenant sets
[51:19] on that
[51:20] stone in the holy of holies it was to be
[51:23] set on that
[51:24] stone then Solomon began to build
[51:27] the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in
[51:30] Mount
[51:31] Mariah the tarum the oral Bible of the
[51:34] Jews says Solomon began to build This Is
[51:36] How They recite this Solomon began to
[51:38] build the house of the sanctuary of the
[51:39] Lord at Jerusalem in the place where
[51:42] Abraham had prayed and worshiped in the
[51:44] name of the Lord this is the place of
[51:47] the Earth where all generations shall
[51:49] Worship the Lord here Abraham was about
[51:51] to offer his son for a burnt offering
[51:53] but he was snatched away by the word of
[51:55] the Lord and placed in his stead here
[51:58] Jacob prayed when he fled from the face
[52:00] of Esau his brother and here the angel
[52:03] Lord appeared to David at which time
[52:05] David built an altar to the Lord in the
[52:07] threshing floor which he bought from or
[52:09] the jebus site what a sight what a place
[52:14] God cons God laid it in creation God
[52:18] consecrated it God Revisited it God
[52:20] bringing them back over and over again
[52:22] to this place where the house of the
[52:24] Lord would be built meaning God God
[52:26] gives great weight and significance to
[52:30] foundations if this place would be so
[52:33] well thought of if God would secure this
[52:35] place if he would Solomon would build
[52:38] the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in
[52:41] Mount Mariah where Adam came forth where
[52:44] Abraham worshiped where Isaac worshiped
[52:46] where Jacob worshiped where David
[52:48] worshiped if God would allow have it to
[52:51] be in this place then God gives great
[52:54] weight to foundations
[52:58] and I close with these thoughts in 1
[53:00] Timothy chapter 6 veres 17 18 and
[53:04] 19 as I read this in the very beginning
[53:06] as our text charge them that are rich in
[53:08] this
[53:10] world now I know most of us just tuned
[53:14] out charge them to rich in this world
[53:16] let me just say this this is a charge to
[53:17] the Bride of leod DEA because thou
[53:20] sayest even the even as this is written
[53:23] it's connected to Leo to see it charge
[53:25] them that are rich in this world that
[53:26] they be not high- minded nor trust in
[53:28] uncertain riches so it talks about your
[53:31] attitude with which you carry those
[53:33] things you're wealthy in a a and your
[53:35] trust so it's not saying that you know
[53:38] as it says it's impossible for a rich
[53:40] man or it's as hard as a rich man to
[53:42] enter to Heaven as it is a camel in the
[53:43] eye of a needle there's some that
[53:44] speculate that's just how hard it is and
[53:47] they say it's not saying the rich man
[53:48] can't and therefore that's what we chase
[53:50] after we chase after riches but this is
[53:53] a challenge charge them that are rich in
[53:55] this world that they be not high High
[53:56] minded nor trust in uncertain riches but
[53:58] trust in the Living God who gives us
[54:01] richly all things to enjoy so he wants
[54:05] us to enjoy the things that we can
[54:06] acquire he wants us to enjoy our single
[54:09] greatest asset to Building Wealth as our
[54:11] income he wants us to enjoy our income
[54:12] he wants us to save it he wants us to
[54:14] use it for all the right things there's
[54:16] a lot that can be said in that but this
[54:18] is the charge that they do
[54:20] good that they be rich in Good Works
[54:23] ready to distribute willing to
[54:25] communicate so he's actually saying you
[54:27] want to do good with what you have if
[54:29] you have wealth if you're rich in this
[54:30] world if you have a lot of income you
[54:32] have a lot of possessions do good with
[54:33] it he's tell he's telling Timothy to
[54:36] teach those that have some have some
[54:38] resource have some wealth that they not
[54:40] be stingy that they not be greedy that
[54:42] they not be selfish that they share this
[54:45] and that they give now I think it's just
[54:47] kind of nice that we're doing a
[54:48] financial report right after this this
[54:49] is beautiful I love how the Lord Works
[54:51] we've been planning this for
[54:53] months but he's this is what he's
[54:55] communic but now catch this laying up in
[54:59] store for themselves a good foundation
[55:01] against the time to come that they may
[55:03] lay hold on eternal
[55:05] life and now if I could back up he's
[55:08] it's actually if we could say it this
[55:09] way and I'll use the scripture here in a
[55:10] moment Earthly he's saying distribute
[55:13] give do good works Earthly riches
[55:15] scattered in faith lay up in store a
[55:18] sure increase of heavenly
[55:20] riches things that you have that God
[55:23] gives us
[55:25] richly to enjoy as we scatter them it's
[55:29] a certain increase of heavenly
[55:33] riches if I give if I give even from my
[55:36] poverty or or even my abundance is
[55:37] saying this is a sure increase of
[55:39] heavenly
[55:40] riches in Proverbs 11:24 there is that
[55:43] scattereth there's a man there's a
[55:45] person that scattereth and yet
[55:47] increaseth and there is that withholdeth
[55:49] more than as meat but it tendeth to
[55:53] Poverty this is what this is what Paul's
[55:55] building on of there's those that just
[55:58] give and as they give they get more they
[56:01] scatter they
[56:02] sew and then there's those that
[56:05] withhold more than it's necessary and
[56:09] they they never get they never get ahead
[56:11] it actually they become more poor they
[56:13] become more
[56:14] broke and he's telling do this I felt it
[56:18] was necessary to capture that in order
[56:20] to understand what he means in verse 19
[56:22] do this Lay It Up in store for them or
[56:26] we would do this he's encouraged us to
[56:28] do this those of us even here in Leo
[56:30] deia who's rich and increased with goods
[56:32] and think we have need of nothing don't
[56:33] trust in uncertain riches don't trust in
[56:35] leoda but live a trusted in God who
[56:39] gives us all things laying up in
[56:44] store for themselves for yourself laying
[56:47] up in store for yourself a good
[56:48] foundation against the time to come lay
[56:53] a good foundation for your future
[56:57] not so much dictated by the things that
[56:59] are happening right now but just as God
[57:02] had this this Divine
[57:05] foresight and God as a Watchman whose
[57:08] for knowledge was demonstrated in his
[57:10] founding acts and we who are father of
[57:13] the home who knows more who's
[57:15] experienced things who've learned things
[57:17] those of us who are set as The Fifth
[57:18] Gospel the the king and priest in the
[57:20] home and those who are leading our
[57:22] families and those who've had an
[57:23] experience with the Lord he's saying you
[57:25] ought to lay a good foundation for the
[57:30] future in other words there is a price
[57:33] to pay in the
[57:36] beginning that as God demonstrated over
[57:39] and over again there were sacrifice on
[57:41] the foundation there were sacrifice on
[57:43] the threshing floor and then David comes
[57:45] and he's got to buy that site and he
[57:46] purchases it say oh great he bought it
[57:48] he was able to build an altar but one
[57:50] day because of the price because of the
[57:52] consecration it's a place that he can
[57:54] now build the house of the Lord
[57:57] but it wasn't just done
[57:58] overnight there's a price to pay to
[58:00] build a good foundation an excellent in
[58:04] its nature and characteristics something
[58:06] that's surpassing precious imminent
[58:10] Choice excellent in its nature and
[58:13] character and therefore it's well suited
[58:15] for its
[58:18] purpose it's adapted for its
[58:21] use therefore this is this is the simple
[58:24] thought I arrive at in all this
[58:27] if we have to have a foundation it takes
[58:30] work there's great sacrifice there's
[58:33] great work there's great
[58:35] investment there's a price to pay in
[58:38] laying a good foundation and we all must
[58:42] do
[58:43] it God help us to be better
[58:45] Builders God help us to be on the right
[58:48] foundation so we can build the right
[58:50] foundations could I pray for you if your
[58:52] head's
[58:53] bowed but the mic if you could come
[58:56] Brothers you can come to your
[58:57] instruments and just for this moment
[59:00] we'll
[59:07] pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[59:09] as we bow our heads at our hearts this
[59:12] morning at the close of this hourong
[59:17] sermon recognizing many exciting things
[59:19] in your scripture
[59:21] but at the end of the day its real
[59:23] purpose and use is as the Bible says
[59:26] it's profitable for us amen this is
[59:30] instructive to us in all scripture given
[59:34] by your breath as we breathe it in Lord
[59:36] we want to
[59:36] learn from The Acts of Abraham the acts
[59:39] of Isaac and Jacob and now we see David
[59:42] in a time of judgment and great loss
[59:45] because of sin and provoking you to
[59:48] anger there's a price being paid upon
[59:51] all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and
[59:52] David in that moment repents and he says
[59:55] let me
[59:57] suffer why should the Sheep suffer let
[1:00:00] it be upon me in my
[1:00:02] house and David in this moment of
[1:00:04] repentance it must have pleased you
[1:00:06] because now you have a prophet go to him
[1:00:07] with the word and say go to this place
[1:00:09] of ornon this very sight with this Death
[1:00:11] Angel standing with the sword drawn and
[1:00:14] there in the shadow of this Angel build
[1:00:16] an
[1:00:19] altar and as David comes to the
[1:00:21] threshing floor the owner the jebusite
[1:00:23] comes out and Bows himself to the king
[1:00:25] and
[1:00:27] David says I I want to buy
[1:00:30] this so I can offer to stop the plague
[1:00:34] and all the heart of or and he's says oh
[1:00:38] I'll just give it to you and if there's
[1:00:40] sacrifice I'll give you the wood and if
[1:00:42] there's Stones you need I'll give them
[1:00:43] from my field and if you need oxen you
[1:00:45] can sacrifice those whatever you need
[1:00:47] David I'll just give it to
[1:00:49] you and I'm so glad you chose David to
[1:00:52] show forth this
[1:00:54] example he didn't say oh well this is
[1:00:57] easier than I
[1:00:59] thought oh I can just piggy back off of
[1:01:03] what ornon did I could just go I could
[1:01:05] just use his work I could just borrow I
[1:01:08] could just let the prophet do it all I
[1:01:10] can just let the pastor do it all I
[1:01:12] could just let somebody else do it all
[1:01:14] but no David said uh no I want to buy it
[1:01:18] all and I want to pay a fair price far
[1:01:21] be it from me to offer up things
[1:01:24] borrowed far beit from me the one who's
[1:01:29] repenting to not offer myself and to
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:34] give and he buys
[1:01:36] it pays a fair price and does all the
[1:01:39] work and the labor and he offers burn
[1:01:42] offerings and peace offerings and fire
[1:01:44] comes and consumes it you receive it
[1:01:49] David sees that the
[1:01:50] angel puts back the sword and David now
[1:01:54] knowing that judgment has been satisfied
[1:01:56] and that your wrath is passed David
[1:01:58] offers up
[1:02:01] sacrifice well what beautiful images
[1:02:03] that have already been expressed in the
[1:02:05] Tabernacle in the temple through
[1:02:07] sacrifices and offerings but now David
[1:02:08] the king offering David this type of
[1:02:11] Christ
[1:02:12] offering this moment of forgiveness he
[1:02:15] signifies this great repentance this
[1:02:17] foundation stone that we all have to
[1:02:19] come to this beginning
[1:02:23] place and then when Solomon comes to
[1:02:26] build the temple he builds it on this
[1:02:28] very floor the threshing
[1:02:32] floor with all its symbolisms Lord and
[1:02:34] with all the things that I with great
[1:02:37] joy was imparting and
[1:02:41] sharing I speak personally Lord just I
[1:02:43] wanted the people to see how special and
[1:02:46] significant this site
[1:02:48] was this Foundation
[1:02:51] was so that we could be
[1:02:54] more serious about about our
[1:02:57] works what we're laboring in and what
[1:02:59] we're working
[1:03:00] for some of us may be trying to rebuild
[1:03:03] our house on a foundation that's
[1:03:06] condemned and we got to come back down
[1:03:08] to
[1:03:09] bedrock maybe we're trying to build
[1:03:11] outside of the foundation we got to come
[1:03:13] back to
[1:03:14] Center and Lord I I express it this way
[1:03:17] in some ways I I know where I want to be
[1:03:19] maybe on Wednesday and I know what I
[1:03:20] want to preach and a couple more
[1:03:22] services coming up on on the work that
[1:03:24] needs to be done in the beginning
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:27] and that there's great work that has to
[1:03:29] go into this so father I'm praying for
[1:03:31] people that I know are going to be
[1:03:33] challenged to work be more Del
[1:03:36] deliberate right now to give themselves
[1:03:37] now to sweat to sacrifice to pay to
[1:03:41] give not so much for now but for the
[1:03:45] time to
[1:03:46] come because David saw great benefit in
[1:03:49] what he was doing in the moment but my
[1:03:51] what did it mean for the time to
[1:03:54] come and to think that David and then
[1:03:58] his son
[1:03:59] Solomon are benefiting from generational
[1:04:04] sacrifice that I can do things
[1:04:07] today that perhaps will make it even
[1:04:10] easier if you T on my
[1:04:14] great-grandson what a legacy Lord that
[1:04:16] we're
[1:04:17] building and I pray for everyone
[1:04:20] here Lord as we sang the power of your
[1:04:22] love as we ministered Wednesday night on
[1:04:24] this is your house I'm hoping that
[1:04:26] everybody recognizes here today that
[1:04:28] even in the image of this Temple that
[1:04:30] was built there came a time when that
[1:04:32] very Foundation which had been corrupted
[1:04:34] was restored we read it in Ezra and
[1:04:37] Nehemiah and the rejoicing of the
[1:04:38] Levites and how you allowed it to be
[1:04:41] restored so father I say today over
[1:04:44] these people that regardless of what the
[1:04:46] foundation looks like you are a redeemer
[1:04:49] that's what the threshing floor
[1:04:51] represents
[1:04:53] Redemption so Lord we come back to you
[1:04:56] today the foundation stone but not just
[1:05:00] a stone ourselves being a living
[1:05:02] Stone and we come to you and say Lord my
[1:05:06] foundation's not right will you help me
[1:05:07] get it
[1:05:09] right and Lord may we start doing the
[1:05:12] work that is necessary as parents as
[1:05:15] young people as individuals now the hard
[1:05:17] work now for the future for that time to
[1:05:21] come CU that time will come when we'll
[1:05:25] have benefited from all the work and all
[1:05:27] the labor we put into the
[1:05:30] foundation bless your people today as we
[1:05:32] worshiped for a moment as we close this
[1:05:35] service in Jesus name
[1:05:37] amen amen
