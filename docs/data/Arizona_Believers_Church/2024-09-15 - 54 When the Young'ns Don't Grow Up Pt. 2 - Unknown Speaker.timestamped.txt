[0:00] I'm continuing on the subject of the
[0:02] house of the Lord and I'm going to uh
[0:04] maybe over the next couple Services back
[0:06] up a little bit to go over some things
[0:08] on the house of the Lord and but our
[0:11] this new sub series that we've started
[0:13] within the context of the house of the
[0:14] Lord to address the same themes and
[0:17] principles that we've been looking at
[0:19] from the beginning is when the young on
[0:21] don't grow up so this is We ministered
[0:23] on it Wednesday night uh as a warning to
[0:25] those who are here Wednesday night I
[0:27] feel led to revisit some of those very
[0:29] same principles to share a lot of the
[0:30] same scriptures hopefully just add a
[0:32] little bit more body to it so there will
[0:34] be maybe in the second half of this
[0:36] sermon uh some addressing what we
[0:39] ministered on Wednesday night uh but in
[0:42] this theme of uh when the youngans don't
[0:44] grow up there's a thought that's in that
[0:47] that I really hope to just reinforce
[0:48] again today and then at the beginning I
[0:52] want to touch on the theme of the
[0:54] purpose of the house of the Lord as
[0:56] we've looked at that already and that
[0:58] the house of the Lord in the beginning
[1:00] whether it was the Tabernacle in the
[1:01] wilderness the temple that was built by
[1:02] Solomon and the subsequent uh rebuilding
[1:06] that there was a vision that God had for
[1:09] it it was made even in the Book of
[1:10] Revelation the the Tabernacle of the
[1:12] temple is opened up and they see into
[1:14] heaven so it represented something
[1:16] Eternal and what was placed upon Earth
[1:19] was patterned after what was in heaven
[1:21] and so there was meaning behind it uh
[1:23] there was a goal it was to speak of
[1:25] something and as we've been using the
[1:28] thought of the house of Lord to relate
[1:30] to us as individuals how that our hearts
[1:32] are to become a home for Christ and what
[1:34] those implications are and how that our
[1:36] homes our families are to be a type of
[1:39] the house of the Lord and it's to uh
[1:41] it's to Harbor God's presence and hold
[1:44] uh virtues and then that also speaks to
[1:47] the church how the church itself is the
[1:49] house of the Lord and we say I was glad
[1:51] when they s to me let us go to the house
[1:53] of the Lord and we weren't talking about
[1:55] going over to um somebody else's house
[1:57] or going to um visit an individual but
[2:00] we're talking about church and so this
[2:02] theme of the house of the Lord has
[2:04] application on every level as far as
[2:07] individually group family and then as a
[2:10] church and that vision and goal this is
[2:13] maybe my thesis statement for this whole
[2:15] uh thought on when youngans don't grow
[2:17] up is the goal for the individual should
[2:20] be maturity the goal for a family is
[2:23] maturity to cultivate character that as
[2:26] we begin to as we fall in love as a
[2:29] couple and we get married and when I say
[2:31] us I'm referring to a sister Elizabeth
[2:32] and I but as you fall in love what you
[2:35] want is that that love that you have for
[2:37] each other to mature to become all that
[2:39] it can be and if God blesses that Union
[2:41] with children and as you begin to raise
[2:43] up children your goal for your children
[2:44] should be maturity I want to raise them
[2:47] up uh I hope it's okay to say this but
[2:49] here brother martin and sister pear are
[2:51] putting prayer requests in for their
[2:52] adult sons for them to find good jobs
[2:54] why it's in the heart of a parent to see
[2:57] their child succeed and to even uh
[3:00] integrate appropriately into society and
[3:02] have character and integrity and and
[3:04] know how to do things honestly and work
[3:06] hard and then start the process all over
[3:09] again with their own family and their
[3:10] own uh wives and and spouses and then
[3:13] for the the goal for a
[3:15] church is not to have fun church
[3:18] services true and if any of you are
[3:20] thinking oh well that explains it uh I
[3:23] apologize but the goal the goal of
[3:26] church is maturity for the Believers to
[3:29] to uh God has equipped you by the
[3:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost and if he
[3:33] hasn't if you haven't come to that the
[3:34] goal of church is to bring you to a
[3:36] birth to cultivate that to Pro provide
[3:39] opportunities with the word of God to to
[3:41] be changed and then to continue to
[3:43] support and resource and equip those
[3:46] who've been born again and those who are
[3:48] individuals and those who are raising
[3:49] families to fulfill their purpose and
[3:52] goal individually and in their home life
[3:54] and so that's the goal of a church is
[3:56] maturity and I think a lot of this could
[3:58] just be summed up with the term
[3:59] character and I know that comes up quite
[4:01] a bit uh in our vision with this church
[4:04] is character but I believe that's at the
[4:05] heart of it is to have character and so
[4:08] that's the thesis behind when youngans
[4:11] don't grow up is there's a goal for this
[4:13] and it's maturity now Luke chapter 10:
[4:16] 21 I hope just to take off from here in
[4:18] that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and
[4:20] said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[4:22] Heaven and Earth and here's this
[4:24] designation of father says that thou
[4:27] Hast hid these things from the wise in
[4:29] prudent and H has revealed them unto
[4:32] babes even so father for so it seemed
[4:35] good in thy sight so it seeming good in
[4:38] his sight it means this is the way God
[4:40] planned it this is the way God intends
[4:41] it and God intending to do it he has a
[4:43] purpose and a reason for not taking the
[4:45] wise and prudent and enlightening them
[4:48] but beginning with these babes and
[4:50] revealing truths to babes and these
[4:53] babes are those that can learn you find
[4:56] in that phrasing of the scripture that
[4:59] to be a babe it's speaking of one that
[5:01] can grow that can be taught that can be
[5:03] trained that can be disciplined and it's
[5:06] certainly contrasted with the idea of
[5:08] the wise and prudent uh because they uh
[5:11] they already know they have an answer to
[5:13] everything when you tell them that this
[5:15] is the right way they go yeah you know
[5:17] but I've got my own way and so Jesus is
[5:19] saying he's hid certain things from the
[5:21] wise and prudent have it all figured out
[5:23] uh they've already learned they've
[5:24] already been trained and let me just say
[5:26] in the natural that when one is wise and
[5:28] prudent in the natural then they are
[5:30] those and I and and I I'm not saying
[5:33] this disparagingly but the wise and
[5:35] prudent are ones that would teach that
[5:38] if there was a need and something need
[5:40] to be expounded upon the wise and
[5:42] prudent in a particular area would be
[5:44] the ones to teach those who aren't
[5:45] experienced who are unskilled and
[5:47] untaught so it tells us that he reveals
[5:50] things to those who can be taught those
[5:53] who are are green or those that are new
[5:55] and they can be trained but as the
[5:58] father has Des designed it that the wise
[6:01] and prudent the the elders the the grown
[6:04] a and the teachers are not being trained
[6:08] and taught in new things but that babes
[6:11] that we're to become babes or he Likens
[6:13] it God's plan to revealing truth to
[6:16] babes let me say this the goal is not to
[6:19] have a
[6:20] nursery the goal is not to run a
[6:24] daycare so it's babes that will learn in
[6:28] 1 Peter chapter 1 vers 23 Peter says
[6:30] being born again not of corruptible seed
[6:32] so it's not the natural birth but born
[6:35] again of
[6:36] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[6:38] liveth and abideth forever Peter says
[6:40] that we have been born again by
[6:42] Incorruptible seed which is the word of
[6:44] God and this word of God liveth and it
[6:47] abideth forever so it's active it's
[6:50] working it's it's alive and it's
[6:51] something that we have been born again
[6:53] by so Peter's wanting to use a language
[6:55] to say that you that have been born by
[6:57] corruptible seed in the flesh have
[6:59] experienced the process of birth
[7:02] development physically and mentally and
[7:04] emotionally to a place to where you have
[7:07] grown up as an adult and you come into
[7:09] adulthood and yet you ultimately die so
[7:12] there's this life to the seed that it
[7:13] runs its cycle and he's wanting to bring
[7:16] that into view and then say but then
[7:17] there's this Incorruptible seed that
[7:19] liveth and abideth forever that's going
[7:21] to follow a similar trajectory but it
[7:23] never ends in death it has a coming to
[7:27] Perfection and forever remaining so
[7:30] scripturally then we could say that we
[7:33] being born again we begin in type as
[7:35] babes infants in the body of
[7:39] Christ and Jesus say is saying that God
[7:42] hides spiritual truths Revelation from
[7:45] the learned the grown the adults the
[7:48] mature in in a natural sense and
[7:51] educational sense and reveals them to
[7:53] babes that can learn that can be taught
[7:56] though unskilled you can cultivate skill
[8:00] so Peter visits this in Chapter 2 veres
[8:02] 1 to3 of his first letter wherefore
[8:05] laying aside all malice and all guile
[8:07] and hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[8:09] speakings so there is this laying aside
[8:12] of natural things and I think there's a
[8:14] way that we could point out that malice
[8:16] and guile and hypocrisies and envies and
[8:18] evil speakings would be characteristic
[8:21] of
[8:23] adolescence immaturity juvenile behavior
[8:26] and says as newborn babes do desire the
[8:30] sincere milk of the word of God when we
[8:32] observe two children or the toddlers
[8:35] playing uh and one has a toy and there's
[8:38] only one of them and the other one
[8:39] doesn't have it we observe that it's
[8:41] natural for them to be envious and to
[8:44] want and to not share and we're always
[8:46] working with them share and do this and
[8:47] do that and it's a constant cultivation
[8:50] of that child's attitude and perception
[8:52] and the way that they work with other
[8:54] people and Peter is saying the same
[8:56] thing now lay aside malice G hypocrisy
[8:59] envies and evil speakings as a babe in
[9:02] Christ desire the sincere milk sincere
[9:05] milk of the word so now it's very
[9:07] explicit being newborn babes by The
[9:10] Incorruptible seed of the word of God
[9:12] which liveth and abideth forever you
[9:14] should be Desiring the sincere milk of
[9:16] the word yes now why are we Desiring
[9:19] milk he's using the example of how that
[9:21] babes would be would draw from the
[9:23] breast and they would drink the mother's
[9:24] milk and this is what they're eating uh
[9:27] I haven't ever heard it before but no
[9:30] matter how much we might like meat and
[9:31] potatoes when our babies are born the
[9:33] dad's not over there saying son I got
[9:35] this filet perfectly rare and and
[9:38] seasoned just perfectly and reverse
[9:40] seared and he doesn't give it to his boy
[9:42] he's a he's the first son of the mcari
[9:44] family we love steak and you don't feed
[9:46] them steak probably going to kill them
[9:49] right there's a have to wait until they
[9:50] grow but then there's even a point where
[9:53] if if you continue to only give them
[9:54] milk they will not properly develop can
[9:58] even rot their teeth out and they won't
[10:00] develop they won't learn certain things
[10:01] with their tongue and their mouths and
[10:02] their digestive system so there's a
[10:04] transition in a way Peter's looking at
[10:06] that exact scenario it says as newborn
[10:08] babes desire the milk so that you can
[10:10] grow
[10:14] thereby if so be that you've tasted that
[10:16] the Lord is
[10:17] gracious if you have indeed been born
[10:20] again by The Incorruptible seed The
[10:23] Incorruptible seed then you can as a
[10:27] babe reach out for the appropriate
[10:30] nutrients and nurture in order to grow
[10:34] to increase so there is a process here
[10:37] of laying down the wrong things as Paul
[10:40] would say putting off the old man and
[10:42] putting on the new man which is made
[10:45] after a different order and a different
[10:46] Spirit a process of laying down and then
[10:48] reaching out after you've been born
[10:50] again once we've been born again we're
[10:52] not put on a shelf and you're good
[10:55] you're perfect you're a trophy and then
[10:57] it's just a on a mission to go out and
[10:59] finally save the last one for all of us
[11:01] who are perfect on the Shelf can finally
[11:03] get out of here but it is a process then
[11:05] of beginning in Christ and growing and
[11:08] reaching forth and Desiring the word of
[11:10] God to grow and then mature and
[11:12] hopefully in growing you can go from
[11:13] milk to
[11:14] meat so Jesus is saying in Luke chapter
[11:17] 10 that he trains as he reveals it to
[11:19] babes such as would learn he trains
[11:21] these newly born believers who are
[11:25] seeking God's Will and purpose who are
[11:28] reaching forth for the right things
[11:30] Desiring the sincere milk of the word
[11:32] who are reaching for God's purpose and
[11:35] intended outcome and I say this and hope
[11:38] to be able to prove it by scripture and
[11:41] actually and knowing that I don't need
[11:43] to prove it because you're all well
[11:45] learned and understand the word of God
[11:46] but I'd like to say it this way that
[11:48] God's purpose for the babes God's
[11:50] purpose for his children as a father is
[11:52] emotional and spiritual
[11:54] maturity if you are in fact a son God's
[11:57] not obsessing about the state of your
[12:00] soul you're his nothing can change that
[12:04] and he's never going to banish a child
[12:06] of his to hell so it is then the
[12:09] continual concern of a parent to say to
[12:14] see and to cultivate the right kind of
[12:16] character and that one way of putting it
[12:18] is emotional and spiritual maturity is
[12:21] God's will for his
[12:23] children brother banam says God's will
[12:25] for us is perfection
[12:30] right God's will for us is perfection
[12:32] and that Perfection is
[12:34] patience all right it's a patience is
[12:36] emotional regulation patience is a
[12:39] subjection of the flesh to the truth yes
[12:43] patience is is is subjecting the mind
[12:45] and the body to the promise of God that
[12:48] says it will be in not getting impatient
[12:51] and trying to make it happen ourselves
[12:53] so patience is has to do with emotional
[12:55] regulation waiting on God and waiting
[12:57] for God this is the proc process of
[13:00] character
[13:02] development we are all developmental
[13:05] stage companies companies are a person
[13:08] legally and I had a lawyer friend one
[13:11] time said he just carried Company
[13:12] charters in his seat to say well
[13:14] according to the law a company is a
[13:16] person and so I can drive in the HOV
[13:18] lane as long as I have company files in
[13:21] the car we'll try that
[13:23] out but God's will is perfection that's
[13:26] going to be a theme today is this this
[13:28] phrasing of perfection now if you turn
[13:31] to numbers chap 18 I'd like to read
[13:33] verses 1 to 7 I'd like just to read it
[13:36] to enter it into our record this morning
[13:38] as we're talking about the house of the
[13:40] Lord because the house of the Lord
[13:42] testifies of this plan of perfection or
[13:45] maybe we could put it another way
[13:47] Redemption through Jesus Christ the
[13:49] temple and the Tabernacle itself
[13:51] speaking of Christ and then this purpose
[13:54] of Christ the three-fold purpose of
[13:56] Christ and what God intends to do uh
[13:58] through Jesus Christ in his body and I
[14:02] want you to catch this theme in the
[14:03] original house of the Lord whether it be
[14:05] the Tabernacle in the wilderness or the
[14:07] temple in verse one and the Lord said
[14:09] unto Aaron thou and thy sons and thy
[14:12] father's house with thee shall bear the
[14:14] iniquity of the sanctuary and thou of
[14:17] thy Sons with thee shall bear the
[14:18] iniquity of your priesthood so there was
[14:20] a burden for them to address sin in in
[14:25] the family in the tribe within the
[14:28] priesthood and within
[14:29] Levites and the there was a process they
[14:33] had to go through to sanctify themselves
[14:34] for service and thy Brethren also the
[14:37] tribe of Levi the tribe of thy father
[14:39] bring thou with thee that they may be
[14:41] joined unto thee and Minister unto thee
[14:44] but thou and thy Sons with thee shall
[14:46] Minister before the Tabernacle of
[14:48] witness it's this phrasing that I was
[14:51] really keying in on that the Tabernacle
[14:53] of witness means it is this tent of
[14:56] testimony that declared God's presence
[14:58] with the the people and it was
[15:00] foreshadowing God's Perfection that and
[15:03] all the elements even of an outer Court
[15:05] an inner court and a holy of holies and
[15:07] then the different stages as we looked
[15:09] at and even the erecting of that outward
[15:11] tent that God began to immediately
[15:13] identify himself in there in that most
[15:15] holy place that it's all speaking and
[15:17] types and shadows of greater things to
[15:20] come and so it's a tabernacle of witness
[15:23] of the presence of God and the purpose
[15:25] of the presence of God among his people
[15:28] and they shall keep thy charge and the
[15:29] charge of all the Tabernacle only they
[15:31] shall not come nigh the vessels of the
[15:34] sanctuary and the altar that neither
[15:36] they nor ye also die so now there's this
[15:38] division of services where just because
[15:40] you were a levite didn't mean you were a
[15:42] priest but you still had a place within
[15:44] the house of God to do service there's a
[15:46] lot of types you could use to that but
[15:49] now he's saying that these Levites of
[15:50] the tribe of your father will serve in
[15:53] various capacities but they have these
[15:55] areas within the house that they serve
[15:58] and they can't intrude on the office of
[16:00] the actual priesthood and they shall be
[16:02] joined unto thee and keep the charge of
[16:05] the Tabernacle of the congregation for
[16:07] all the service of the Tabernacle each
[16:10] one has a purpose each one has a duty to
[16:12] serve the greater good of the people or
[16:14] all the people all the body of Israel
[16:16] but then also to serve those that are
[16:18] doing things that they cannot do and the
[16:20] stranger shall not come nigh unto you
[16:23] and you shall keep the charge of the
[16:24] sanctuary and the charge of the altar
[16:26] that there be no wrath anymore upon the
[16:28] children of Israel
[16:29] in other words there was things that
[16:31] children of Israel must observe to keep
[16:33] God's Wrath and they would do service in
[16:36] the Tabernacle in order to preserve that
[16:38] themselves and behold I have taken your
[16:40] brethren the Levites from among the
[16:41] children of Israel to you they are given
[16:43] as a gift for the Lord to do the service
[16:45] of the Tabernacle of the congregation
[16:48] therefore thou and thy Sons with thee
[16:49] shalt keep your priest office for
[16:51] everything of the Altar and within the
[16:53] veil and you shall serve I've given your
[16:55] priest office unto you as a service of
[16:57] gift and the Strang that come n shall be
[16:59] put to death these are very strong words
[17:04] uh in terms of the consequences of not
[17:06] abiding by this and just anyone
[17:07] intruding on it but the overall picture
[17:10] I want you to see is this Tabernacle of
[17:12] witness this tent of testimony set
[17:15] amongst the people where they would all
[17:17] Orient themselves as tribes on each side
[17:20] to that Tabernacle and as this focal
[17:22] point of their journey and their Exodus
[17:25] it would then be forever uh it would be
[17:27] memorialized in the temple that is built
[17:29] in Jerusalem but it was to it had a
[17:32] purpose it had it served an intent then
[17:35] present but also foreshadowing God's
[17:38] Perfection Paul takes it and breaks it
[17:40] down in the book of
[17:42] Hebrews and I know that even Timothy
[17:45] it's attributed to him as having written
[17:46] the book of
[17:48] Hebrews and and so whether Timothy wrote
[17:51] it uh on behalf of Paul uh I I'm
[17:54] ascribing the authorship to Paul in
[17:57] Hebrews chapter 9: 6 6 to 10 says now
[18:00] when these things were thus ordained and
[18:03] numbers 18 is just a snippet of this
[18:06] ordination we could see that here so the
[18:08] purpose of reading that was to have this
[18:11] reference point of this Old Testament
[18:14] ordination when they were thus ordained
[18:16] the priest went always into the first
[18:18] Tabernacle now the language here can be
[18:20] a little bit uh not not confusing but
[18:23] just a little bit misleading in the
[18:25] sense that the first Tabernacle does not
[18:27] refer to the first time erected the tent
[18:29] but it's the inner court or the holy
[18:32] place and accomplishing the service of
[18:34] God so priest could go in there all the
[18:37] time to this court in the Holy place and
[18:40] there was things that had to be done and
[18:41] things that had to be administered on a
[18:43] daily basis but into the second the
[18:46] second Tabernacle or the most holy place
[18:48] the holiest of holies there where the
[18:51] Ark of the Covenant was where The Mercy
[18:52] Seat was the place that God said he
[18:54] would commune you familiar with all
[18:56] those different concepts only the high
[18:59] priest the second went the high priest
[19:00] alone once a year not without blood
[19:03] which he offered for himself and for The
[19:05] Heirs of the people so there was this
[19:07] process that the high priest once a year
[19:09] on the day of atonement would sanctify
[19:11] himself and for the people and then go
[19:14] into enter in behind the veil and offer
[19:17] up and sprinkle this Blood once a year
[19:19] on the day of atonement uh come in
[19:21] behind that Veil into the most holy
[19:24] place the holiest of holies and offer
[19:27] this sacrifice or to present the blood
[19:30] upon the Altar and he did this once a
[19:32] year but then daily in the inner Court
[19:35] things are always happening and then you
[19:37] also had the outer Court where there
[19:38] were other services done now verse eight
[19:41] tells us the Holy Ghost this
[19:45] signifying that the way into the holiest
[19:47] of all was not yet made manifest while
[19:49] as the first Tabernacle was yet
[19:51] standing so it was showing that once a
[19:55] year only one could enter and testified
[19:59] every year it testified nobody has been
[20:02] made whole to be able to go in there
[20:06] even the high priest himself ran the
[20:08] risk of death if he hadn't atoned
[20:11] properly hadn't washed properly and
[20:13] dressed properly and followed the word
[20:14] of God so the Holy Ghost was testifying
[20:17] then that a way into the holiest of
[20:20] holies had not been consecrated for all
[20:22] and as long as that first Tabernacle was
[20:25] yet standing and in service and active
[20:28] this was this the continual testimony
[20:30] verse 9 says that I think even more
[20:32] plainly which was a figure for the time
[20:35] then present and other words at the time
[20:38] it meant this it was a parable of this
[20:41] it was an analogy it was a type which
[20:43] was a type at that time in which were
[20:46] offered both gifts and sacrifices that
[20:49] could not make him that did the service
[20:52] perfect as pertaining to the
[20:55] conscience the very way in which the
[20:58] temple was ad ad ministered and the
[20:59] sacrifices repeated was signifying at
[21:02] that time that in those gifts and
[21:05] sacrifices they could not make the one
[21:08] who performed them perfect as pertaining
[21:12] to the conscience now catch this in this
[21:15] house of the Lord there was a lot of
[21:17] gifts a lot of service a lot of function
[21:19] a lot of things being done in the house
[21:20] of the Lord that were all right and all
[21:22] correct and according to ordination but
[21:24] there was no
[21:25] perfection in those things
[21:29] as pertaining to the conscience this
[21:31] conscience covers the heart and mind of
[21:33] a man and so not only could I think this
[21:37] will become clear as we go forward not
[21:40] only could that blood and those gifts
[21:42] and those offerings perfect the soul but
[21:46] it could
[21:47] not uh it could not unburden couldn't
[21:49] unburden the soul from sin nor could it
[21:52] purify the mind and heart
[21:54] completely that the conscience was still
[21:57] condemned and the man still had
[21:58] consciousness of sin because it's only a
[22:01] type and it had to be continually done
[22:03] says which stood only in meats and
[22:05] drinks and diverse Washings and carnal
[22:07] ordinances opposed on them until the
[22:10] time of reformation so if we look at
[22:13] this kind of as a whole that the the
[22:16] function of the house of the Lord and
[22:19] those who did the service were standing
[22:21] as a parable or
[22:23] signifying first that the worshipper and
[22:26] those that did the service and the conre
[22:28] conation could not be made perfect in
[22:31] other words th those things could not
[22:34] add what was lacking to render it whole
[22:38] that to be perfect it's complete and so
[22:40] this worship was in part it lacked
[22:43] something in wasn't the Perfection that
[22:45] God wanted to signify if all God wanted
[22:48] was worship it was in that house if all
[22:50] God wanted was praise it was in that
[22:52] house if all God wanted was to make his
[22:54] presence known and you feel it it was in
[22:55] that house but there was something in in
[22:59] it and it pointed to that time of
[23:01] reformation or the restoration of it all
[23:04] the proper order and the way things
[23:06] ought to be so Hebrews
[23:10] 9 again verse
[23:13] 11 says but Christ being come a high
[23:16] priest of good things to
[23:18] come by a greater and more perfect
[23:21] Tabernacle now you see how he's just
[23:22] transitioned Christ who himself
[23:25] represents a greater and more perfect
[23:29] Tabernacle and a high priest of good
[23:31] things to come a tabernacle more perfect
[23:36] that means a That Word Perfect there is
[23:38] full grown the word there is even
[23:40] speaking of one of his full age an adult
[23:43] or
[23:45] mature not made with hands that is to
[23:47] say not of this building neither by the
[23:50] blood of goats and calves but by his own
[23:51] blood he entered in the in once into the
[23:55] holy Place having obtained Eternal
[23:57] Redemption for us what beautiful poetry
[23:59] what a beautiful image how Christ
[24:01] ascended up into heaven as a high priest
[24:03] to present the blood to present the
[24:06] sacrifice as the high priest did once a
[24:07] year Christ does it one time once and
[24:09] for all there no there's no more need of
[24:12] for a sacrifice for the remission of sin
[24:14] there's no more need for anyone to shed
[24:15] blood to atone for sin and and some
[24:18] cultures they actually require uh
[24:20] stoning and the shedding of blood to
[24:22] atone for sin still why because you
[24:25] reject it's a rejection of the atonement
[24:26] in Christ for if the
[24:30] blood so he by his own blood entered in
[24:32] once in the Holy Place having obtained
[24:33] Eternal Redemption for us for if the
[24:35] blood of bulls and goats and the ashes
[24:36] of a hepher sprinkling unclean sanctify
[24:39] to the purifying of the flesh this is in
[24:42] those that did service these temporary
[24:44] sanctification for service a and what it
[24:47] did uh to keep the service of the house
[24:50] of the Lord going how much more shall
[24:52] the blood of
[24:53] Christ what a greater thing a greater
[24:56] and more perfect Tabernacle how if if
[24:58] the blood of bulls and goats
[24:59] accomplished that how much more how much
[25:01] more the blood of Christ who through the
[25:04] eternal spirit offered himself without
[25:06] spot to God how much more can it Purge
[25:09] your conscience from dead Works to serve
[25:12] the Living
[25:13] God this very language to serve the
[25:16] Living God was typed by the Levites
[25:17] typed by the priesthood to do service in
[25:20] the house of the Lord to do service unto
[25:22] God how much more would it be able to
[25:24] purge your conf conscience if the
[25:27] original service in the Tabernacle could
[25:29] not make him that did the service
[25:31] perfect pertaining to his conscience his
[25:33] mind and his heart how much more now
[25:36] since the soul has been atoned for can
[25:38] Christ the blood of Christ through his
[25:41] eternal spirit Purge your mind and your
[25:43] heart from dead Works to serve the
[25:46] Living God how much more ought we be to
[25:49] be able to lay aside all malice all
[25:52] guile all hypocrisies and envies and
[25:54] evil speakings and grow in the word of
[25:58] God God to become Perfect by this
[26:02] greater and more perfect offering in
[26:06] Tabernacle so backing up to Hebrews chap
[26:09] 7:
[26:11] 11-19 Paul had said it this way if
[26:13] therefore
[26:14] Perfection Perfection here is a
[26:17] different conjugation of that underlined
[26:18] word perfect which is uh complete mature
[26:22] fully grown this Perfection here means
[26:25] the Fulfillment of purpose or the
[26:27] accomplishment of purpose Pur coming
[26:29] from that word perfect meaning to be
[26:31] mature or complete if therefore
[26:33] Perfection were by the levitical
[26:35] priesthood for under it the people
[26:37] received the law what further need was
[26:39] there that another priest should rise
[26:41] after the order of MDC and not be called
[26:44] after the order of Aaron what a great
[26:46] question if the Perfection required by
[26:49] God could be achieved under those
[26:53] natural disciplines and uh uh works of
[26:56] the Flesh and and bodily exercise and in
[26:59] that service if you could obtain to it
[27:00] why would the Messiah need to come and I
[27:02] know it's a question it's like well
[27:04] nobody's asking that question but it's
[27:07] good to think about the fact that Paul
[27:08] supposes it for us to think more deeply
[27:11] about Christ and what his purpose was
[27:13] for the priesthood being changed there
[27:14] is made a necessity of change also of
[27:17] the law for he of whom these things were
[27:19] spoken pertaineth to another tribe of
[27:21] which no man gave attendance at the
[27:23] altar for it is evident that our Lord
[27:26] sprang out of Judah of which Tri Moses
[27:28] spake nothing concerning priesthood now
[27:31] this is good stuff this is a stuff for
[27:33] ministers meetings if we were all uh
[27:36] Jewish rabbis right like and you're
[27:38] going to be receiving the message and
[27:40] you're going to be changing out of this
[27:41] old denominational order and coming to
[27:44] Christ then you start working on these
[27:46] difficult questions of how could he be a
[27:48] priest if he's of the tribe of Judah and
[27:50] not after the order of
[27:52] Aaron and it is yet far more evident for
[27:55] after that after the similitude of MZ
[27:58] there ariseth another
[28:00] priest speaking of Christ who is made
[28:02] not after the law of a carnal
[28:04] commandment it's numbers 18 and the law
[28:06] of a carnal Commandment that perpetuated
[28:08] the priesthood because the high priest
[28:10] died and the law made way so that a new
[28:12] one would rise up a law preserved the
[28:14] sanctification of the priesthood it made
[28:16] sure that those that did offerings and
[28:18] service were cleansed and it made sure
[28:20] there was always one to replace if one
[28:22] fell and one died and and one went
[28:25] another way that was a law of a carnal
[28:27] Commandment that preserved it carnally
[28:29] through another seed another son another
[28:31] son but this mzc this Messiah this
[28:35] priest was made after the power of an
[28:38] endless life Hallelujah you then are
[28:41] made after the power of an endless life
[28:45] if you're just going to be a cultured
[28:46] Christian or a cultured message believer
[28:49] then you are made after the law of a
[28:50] carnal commandment but you must be born
[28:53] again after the power of an endless
[28:56] life the never stop stop s never
[29:00] quits this power of an endless life is
[29:03] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[29:06] forever for he testified thou art a
[29:08] priest Forever After the order of
[29:11] MDC for there is verily a disannulling
[29:14] of the Commandment going before the weak
[29:17] going before for the weakness and
[29:19] unprofitableness
[29:20] thereof for the law made nothing
[29:24] perfect but the bringing in of a better
[29:27] hope did
[29:29] what's this better hope he said it's
[29:30] Christ who's become a high priest of
[29:32] good things to come a greater and more
[29:34] perfect Tabernacle the things that these
[29:37] elements and these services and this
[29:39] priesthood suggested and pointed to
[29:42] and uh in were parable of the bringing
[29:45] of a better hope did by the which by
[29:47] which we draw nigh unto
[29:50] God it's through this better hope it's
[29:52] through this more perfect Tabernacle
[29:54] that we draw nigh unto God doesn't say
[29:57] that we are become God we draw
[30:00] nigh that we could say The God Who is
[30:03] the becoming God is now living in us for
[30:05] us to become more like
[30:07] him Hebrews chapter 10 visits a very
[30:10] similar theme for the law having a
[30:12] shadow of good things to come I think
[30:14] that just marries perfectly with verse
[30:15] 19 of chapter 7 the law made nothing
[30:20] perfect made nothing
[30:22] mature made nothing complete it was in
[30:25] part it it brought nothing to Perfection
[30:28] it never completely fulfilled the
[30:29] purpose that God had for his people
[30:31] because if it did we wouldn't have
[30:32] needed Christ if it could have been done
[30:35] through Worship in the original Temple
[30:37] we would all as the elect of God be
[30:40] Jews and we would be going to Jerusalem
[30:43] three times a year and we would be doing
[30:45] everything we could in whether it be
[30:47] through the traditional Orthodoxy
[30:49] through learning through achieving that
[30:51] Perfection under the law if it were so
[30:54] but God had ordained another priesthood
[30:57] he'll uh if it I can say there hid the
[30:59] mystery of mzc go into the book of
[31:02] Hebrews and how much more he wanted to
[31:04] expound and then does expound upon melz
[31:07] because it spoke of this great mystery
[31:09] to those who would be feeding on the
[31:11] word of God and it testified of greater
[31:13] things he's saying it was hid in this
[31:15] priest Forever After the order of mzc
[31:18] that there would become there would come
[31:19] a nation of Kings and
[31:21] Priests who would offer spiritual
[31:24] sacrifices therefore we understand that
[31:26] it could not be achieved under that
[31:28] Division and that order but under a new
[31:29] order to be new creatures in Christ
[31:31] Jesus the law having a shadow of good
[31:33] things to come and not the very image of
[31:36] the things the law can never with those
[31:40] sacrifices which they offered year by
[31:42] year continually make the comers there
[31:43] unto
[31:45] perfect cannot make them complete could
[31:48] not make them mature religious service
[31:51] does not perfect a Believer right
[31:54] religious function and bodily activity
[31:57] and
[31:58] uh whatever anything of the flesh a law
[32:00] of the carnal commandment I'd even like
[32:02] for you to in your mind revisit how on
[32:05] the subject of Liberty when something
[32:06] becomes a must it is the human nature to
[32:09] be able to create a
[32:11] checklist and we have a to-do list so if
[32:13] we could do all the things on our to-do
[32:14] list at the end of the day we could go
[32:16] to bed saying I had a good day right
[32:19] today was a good day I did everything on
[32:22] the list and on the list was wake up get
[32:24] dressed take a shower right because you
[32:26] want to check things off right you want
[32:28] to be able to say you did something and
[32:30] and that's that's the human nature is to
[32:31] be able to have a law of a carnal
[32:33] commandment to be able to say I made
[32:35] it and so there's a things that become
[32:37] an ought to and a must in order to
[32:39] appease that uh fig Leaf religion that
[32:44] I'm covering
[32:45] myself but Paul is emphasizing over and
[32:48] over again no these cannot make the
[32:50] worshipper perfect for then would they
[32:52] not have ceased to be offered because
[32:55] that the worshippers once purged should
[32:56] have had had no more conscience of sins
[32:59] but in those sacrifices there is a
[33:01] remembrance again made of sin every year
[33:03] what's the conscience pertain to again
[33:05] the mind the heart the intellect and the
[33:07] emotion yes it's all in that regulated
[33:10] that area of the Mind conscience memory
[33:11] reason affection uh the for it is not
[33:14] possible that the blood of bulls and
[33:16] goats should take away sins wherefore
[33:19] when he cometh into the world he saith
[33:20] sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest
[33:22] not but a body hast thou prepared me
[33:24] Prophecy of the
[33:25] Messiah in burnt offerings in sacrifices
[33:28] for sin thou Hast had no pleasure then
[33:31] said I lo I come to do thy will oh God
[33:36] so this parenthetical phrase lo I come
[33:38] and the parenthesis says in the volume
[33:40] of the book it is written of me so he's
[33:41] not saying lo I come in the volume of
[33:43] the book he's saying lo I come and it's
[33:45] been prophesied of me in the in the Old
[33:47] Testament in the Psalms I come to do thy
[33:50] will oh
[33:51] God I'm not coming just to offer
[33:53] sacrifices because obedience is better
[33:56] than sacrifice I'm not is coming to
[33:58] perform religious service because doing
[34:00] the will of God many will come to me
[34:02] that that day and say we've done a lot
[34:04] of neat things have you seen our Bucket
[34:06] List have you seen our to-do list have
[34:08] you seen all the good things we've done
[34:09] all the Miracles all the signs and
[34:11] wonders he like there's something you
[34:12] left out my
[34:14] will he that doeth the will of God lo I
[34:17] come for a singular purpose to do thy
[34:18] will oh God above when he said sacrifice
[34:21] and offering and burnt offerings and
[34:22] offering for sin thou wouldest not
[34:24] neither hath pleasure therein which are
[34:26] offered by the law then said he is just
[34:28] kind of repeating it again I come to do
[34:30] thy will oh God he taketh away the first
[34:33] that he may establish the second by the
[34:36] which will we are Sanctified through the
[34:39] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[34:41] once for all and every priest standeth
[34:45] daily ministering and offering often
[34:46] times the same sacrifices which can
[34:49] never take away sins but this man I hope
[34:51] you can just see the image as he as the
[34:53] writer Paints the picture but this man
[34:56] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[34:57] sins forever sat down on the right hand
[34:59] of God not doing what these got daily
[35:01] ministering and offering often times the
[35:03] same sacrifices over and over and over
[35:05] again because it never made anything
[35:06] perfect the soul the mind the body none
[35:08] of it though there was a temporary
[35:10] sanctification and purifying of the
[35:13] flesh for those that did
[35:15] service says but this man after he had
[35:18] offered one sacrif for sins forever sat
[35:21] down on the right hand of God from
[35:22] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[35:24] made his foot stol for by one offering
[35:27] he hath perfected forever them that are
[35:30] Sanctified there's the purpose the
[35:33] perfecting forever whereof the Holy
[35:35] Ghost also is a witness to us so our the
[35:39] soul if you have been Sanctified he has
[35:42] perfected you forever it's the condition
[35:45] the abiding condition of the Soul
[35:47] wherefore the Holy Ghost is a witness to
[35:51] us this is a I think this is a critical
[35:54] part to recognize that though the soul
[35:57] is made perfect through this
[35:58] regeneration of the baptism of the Holy
[36:00] Ghost we need a witness to remind us of
[36:04] this this is the
[36:06] Covenant that I will make with them
[36:09] after those days sayith the Lord I will
[36:11] put my laws into their hearts and in
[36:13] their minds will I write them and we say
[36:16] thank you Lord and their sins and
[36:18] iniquities will I remember no
[36:21] more he who the son has set free is free
[36:25] indeed where the spirit of the Lord
[36:26] there is Liberty Liberty unburdened
[36:29] should I say from what has been I won't
[36:32] do it but there is there's this
[36:34] unburdening of the soul from sin and now
[36:37] I'm free to
[36:38] become I'm free to be what God wants me
[36:41] to be I don't have to go back to the law
[36:43] I'm not made perfect by the flesh but he
[36:45] has written his law in my heart it's the
[36:47] word of God which liveth and abideth
[36:49] forever in my Minds this word can have
[36:51] preeminence and my sins and iniquities
[36:53] will no longer restrain me and the Holy
[36:56] Ghost testifies this continually to us
[36:59] aren't you grateful as Sons and
[37:00] Daughters of God that when you make
[37:02] mistakes that what the word of God wants
[37:04] to bring us back to is not the law but
[37:06] his promise that your sins and your
[37:08] iniquities will I remember no more and
[37:11] this L to see an age of darkness and
[37:13] filth and perversion and how much he
[37:15] attacks us let us not use justification
[37:18] as a an excuse to stay in sin but let us
[37:21] use it as an opportunity to be renewed
[37:24] and to leave it behind to lay it aside
[37:27] to be burdened from it to no longer be
[37:29] stained by it and grow in Grace and
[37:32] increase in the knowledge of the son of
[37:35] Goden for by one offering he ha
[37:37] perfected Forever This Perfection of the
[37:39] soul is the initial work of the Holy
[37:42] Ghost the law could never do
[37:45] this it was impossible for the law to do
[37:50] that and to those that are born again
[37:52] and those who have become babes in
[37:53] Christ as you would read in Hebrews 5 he
[37:56] says in verse one of chapter 6 therefore
[37:57] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[37:59] of Christ now if it's the principles of
[38:02] the doctrine of Christ when he says
[38:03] leaving them he doesn't mean forsaking
[38:06] them disregarding them counting them as
[38:08] nothing these are foundational
[38:10] principles upon which everything else
[38:12] would be built but it means we're
[38:15] building God does not pour a foundation
[38:17] and say this is beautiful this is my
[38:20] home this is where I want to live the
[38:23] foundation of Faith speaks that there's
[38:24] going to be a structure that he has all
[38:26] the materials for Amen to make you a
[38:29] Dwelling Place the
[38:30] stature God does not have a nursery
[38:34] could you just imagine if heaven was
[38:36] like a
[38:37] nursery it was just screaming babies all
[38:40] the time and and that's what the Angels
[38:42] had to do or that's what the Old
[38:43] Testament Believers had to do is change
[38:45] our diapers
[38:46] and bottle feed us whatever they do in
[38:49] heaven right streets of gold or it's
[38:51] Cribs of gold strollers of gold on
[38:54] streets of gold God does not birth you
[38:57] as a babe a and gooo gag G you know
[39:00] crying and blabbering and all the little
[39:02] things that a baby does and he's like
[39:03] you're just perfect yes you are you're
[39:06] just perfect you look just like your
[39:08] daddy right it's not that's not what he
[39:10] does he says let us go on unto
[39:14] Perfection not laying again the
[39:16] foundation of repentance from dead works
[39:18] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[39:20] of baptisms water and even the pouring
[39:22] out of the spirit and of laying on of
[39:25] hands and of resurrection of the dead
[39:26] and of Eternal judgment he's covered all
[39:28] the foundational things for in the
[39:30] Covenant there is salvation in the
[39:31] Covenant there is Divine Healing in the
[39:32] Covenant are are these baptisms and
[39:35] laying on of hands and the and the gifts
[39:37] of the Spirit and he says and this will
[39:40] we do if God permit Perfection is God's
[39:44] will Perfection is what God allows what
[39:46] God must permit he's speaking of not
[39:49] just a faith but a perfect Faith let us
[39:51] go on unto Perfection that word there
[39:53] tootes is the finisher it is a perfector
[39:58] and so will God permit us to go on unto
[40:00] the perfect one will he permit us to no
[40:04] longer be babes will he allow us in
[40:06] nurture Us by the nature that he's put
[40:07] inside of us in the nurture of the word
[40:09] of God will he allow our faith to be
[40:11] raised to Perfection that it might come
[40:13] to the highest example of faith and
[40:16] achieve the ultimate Perfection that
[40:18] Faith stands for and sees and believes
[40:20] in that faith is the very evidence of
[40:22] that faith is the very substance of the
[40:25] things hoped for that Christ himself
[40:27] spoke
[40:28] of because the it brings what Christ
[40:31] does is it brings in that of a better
[40:33] hope which faith is the evidence of this
[40:35] Perfection that's right
[40:39] Hallelujah so it's not a question of sin
[40:42] but a question of
[40:44] growth for God would not want us to
[40:46] always be under the burden and the
[40:49] shadow of sin that if our hearts condemn
[40:52] us we would know that God is greater
[40:54] than our hearts and knows all things and
[40:55] he knows nothing of your sin yes
[40:57] and that our Soul's being unburdened
[40:59] from the penalty of sin and our soul not
[41:01] able to be condemned to death nor is our
[41:04] soul ever able to be judged
[41:06] again we can now be free in him to
[41:10] become what he wants us to be so he
[41:13] wants to settle the sin question but in
[41:16] settling the sin question he has not
[41:17] fulfilled his ultimate purpose and goal
[41:20] for the Plan of Redemption Paul even
[41:23] visits the same thing when he's writing
[41:24] in Hebrews he goes they without us could
[41:26] not be made
[41:28] perfect in other words Perfection was
[41:30] not achieved under the law nor was
[41:32] Perfection achieved you got to hold on
[41:35] this we're talking about accomplishment
[41:36] fulfillment of ultimate purpose nor was
[41:39] full Perfection achieved on the day of
[41:42] Pentecost it was the start of what God
[41:45] was looking to achieve all along to have
[41:48] a body that would be his church that
[41:51] would be his bride that would be his
[41:54] own so this Tabernacle spoke
[41:58] of the purifying and cleansing of the
[42:00] soul forever from sin but then the Holy
[42:03] Ghost
[42:05] testifies about growth the maturity and
[42:07] fulfilling purpose to the highest
[42:10] example of Faith to the perfector the
[42:13] perfect
[42:14] one in Hebrews 13:
[42:17] 17 to 21 we'll just read to verse 21
[42:20] obey them that have the rule over you
[42:22] and submit yourselves for they watch for
[42:24] your souls as they must give account
[42:27] that they may do it with joy and not
[42:28] with grief for that is unprofitable for
[42:31] you there will be a day in which the
[42:33] Believers the children of God will stand
[42:34] before him to before the be of the
[42:36] Judgment seat of Christ not to be judged
[42:38] for sin but our works to be judged for
[42:41] rewards cannot be banished to
[42:44] hell and so in that image that we will
[42:47] all have to give an account every man
[42:49] will give an account and those who have
[42:50] stewardship will give account for those
[42:51] they were stewards over and they will
[42:53] give a report and let them do it with
[42:54] joy and not grief because that would be
[42:56] unprofitable for
[42:58] you telling even the Born Again
[43:00] Believers to obey them that have rule
[43:01] over you those that watch over you pray
[43:03] for us for We Trust we have a good
[43:04] conscience in all things willing to live
[43:06] honestly but iech you to rather do
[43:11] this that I may be restored to you
[43:13] sooner now the God of Peace that brought
[43:15] again from the dead our lord Jesus that
[43:17] great Shepherd of the sheep through the
[43:19] blood of the Everlasting Covenant make
[43:21] you perfect in every good work to do his
[43:24] will amen is this not the image lo I
[43:26] come to do thy will oh God he repeats it
[43:29] twice it's written of me in the volume
[43:31] of the book lo I come not just to do
[43:32] religious service not sacrifice and
[43:34] offering but I come to do thy will oh
[43:36] God so he says pray that God would make
[43:38] you perfect in every good work to do his
[43:41] will working in you that which is well
[43:43] pleasing in his sight through Jesus
[43:45] Christ to whom be glory forever and ever
[43:47] amen this is your thesis statement for
[43:49] your life if every day you were writing
[43:52] a five paragraph essay this is your
[43:53] thesis
[43:55] statement if your working on your thesis
[43:58] if you're working whatever your
[43:59] dissertation whatever it is you're doing
[44:01] this is it that God would make you
[44:03] perfect in every good work to do his
[44:04] will working in you that which is well
[44:06] pleasing in his sight through Jesus
[44:07] Christ not on your own to him be glory
[44:10] and for forever and
[44:12] ever the word here make you perfect this
[44:15] phrase make perfect means to strengthen
[44:17] to complete to make one what he ought to
[44:20] be amen when we have children and babes
[44:24] are born and the young ones begin to
[44:26] fill up the house we look at them with
[44:28] the potential that they have and we
[44:30] realize that every moment it's a phase
[44:32] of growth and some we enjoy more than
[44:34] others and others we just try to get
[44:35] through as much as we can but we look at
[44:37] them and we say that at this stage
[44:39] whether it be physical development or
[44:41] maturity this isn't as he ought to be
[44:44] and we're constantly trying to present
[44:46] whether by our own uh example in how
[44:49] that we treat our wives how we treat our
[44:51] children how we treat other people and
[44:52] how our discipline that we have we're
[44:54] wanting to demonstrate to them that
[44:56] there is a way that you ought to be and
[44:58] the way that you are now is is it has a
[45:01] vision it's looking
[45:03] forward the way that we ought to be then
[45:05] does not speak of certain demonstrations
[45:07] and manifestations as we said before but
[45:10] it's that righteousness to be as you
[45:12] ought and if we try to take our own
[45:14] peculiar identities and say this is the
[45:16] way that you ought to be then one could
[45:18] be testifying in your family you ought
[45:21] to be a foot
[45:23] surgeon cuz that's what I am no not me I
[45:26] mean but with the father was
[45:27] hypothetically
[45:29] speaking you're you need to be this you
[45:31] need to be that but it is a growth to be
[45:34] as one ought to be the word that it
[45:37] draws from in the compound meaning to
[45:39] make perfect it's Aros fitted perfected
[45:43] refers to this special aptitude for a
[45:46] given
[45:48] use you're realizing that each one of us
[45:50] have a calling each one of us have a
[45:53] place that God wants to use us and
[45:54] someone else can't take your place is
[45:56] that positional placing of a Believer
[45:59] where he comes to his call and he comes
[46:00] to what he's gifted in he's he's
[46:02] faithful in that and so God wants to
[46:05] make you perfect to make you as you
[46:07] ought to be because he has made you he's
[46:10] birthed you for a purpose and he's given
[46:12] you an aptitude for G certain uses and
[46:15] what do we do when we test people early
[46:17] on we have aptitude tests and that's
[46:20] what the world is looking out after
[46:22] trying to find what one has an aptitude
[46:24] for and therefore if you can find your
[46:26] aptitude
[46:27] then you could be oriented and shaped
[46:30] and promote growth in what you're you
[46:32] have an aptitude for a certain handiness
[46:35] too and a skill too God knows you're
[46:38] apt he knows what you've got he knows
[46:40] what's in you he knows that he's got
[46:42] gold he knows what to how to make you
[46:44] and so he he needs to do likewise that
[46:46] the world wants to do through schooling
[46:48] and resources God wants to through his
[46:50] word cultivate that and bring you to
[46:53] that place that he has raised you up for
[46:56] not just to be a baby in a in a crib not
[46:58] just to be a nursery not just to be a
[47:00] rock on a shelf but he wants you to be
[47:02] used to be placed in the body of Christ
[47:05] this Perfection is also spoke of in the
[47:07] parable of the sewer the parable of the
[47:10] sewing of seed in Luke chapter 8 you'll
[47:11] find it in other places but that seed
[47:13] which fell among
[47:15] Thorns it was choked out by the cares
[47:17] and riches and pleasures of this life
[47:19] and it brought no fruit to Perfection no
[47:22] it did not ever bring fruit to maturity
[47:26] and the word that's used here in this
[47:27] analogy it's used in The Sewing of seed
[47:29] is it says those that bring forth young
[47:33] whether it be animals humans uh plants
[47:37] it's the bringing of the young to
[47:40] maturity it's the bringing of that which
[47:42] has been fruited that which has been
[47:43] born to maturity it's about the word
[47:46] having expression in you not just being
[47:49] in you right but being lived through you
[47:53] a life lived by the will of God becoming
[47:56] the word expressed let us all take
[47:59] comfort in knowing our soul is sealed
[48:00] but have knowing that the soul is sealed
[48:02] let us all have this attitude and if we
[48:04] can have an aptitude for anything let it
[48:07] be that Lord I want to do your will I
[48:10] want to be Christlike in each phase and
[48:12] each turn I don't want to keep making
[48:14] the same mistakes with my wife I don't
[48:15] want to keep making the same mistakes
[48:17] with my children I want to stop living
[48:19] selfishly I want to stop living
[48:21] arrogantly and presumptuously I want to
[48:23] grow
[48:24] up if my sins indeed have been forgiven
[48:28] if I have in my soul realmed detained to
[48:30] an eternal State then God I want to live
[48:33] in my mind and my heart more at peace
[48:35] amen more forgiving more loving more
[48:38] faithful more true I don't want to allow
[48:41] the cares of this life and riches and
[48:44] Pleasures choke out the expression of
[48:46] the word of God I want it to live in me
[49:00] I believe I can go just a little bit
[49:01] we'll be real real conscious of the time
[49:04] but I want
[49:05] to just transition now from this to when
[49:10] the young ons don't grow up and just
[49:13] Ponder this phrase and
[49:15] even of this um this title if you would
[49:21] if you're wanting to know where I'm not
[49:24] hiding the ball on this at all if you're
[49:25] want to know where I'm drawing this from
[49:26] but it's the series that brother Brandon
[49:28] preached in streetport 1965 go study it
[49:30] from the first one to the last if you
[49:31] want to go further on to the end of the
[49:34] that year in December it's perfect kind
[49:36] of microcosm of what's inspiring me what
[49:39] the purpose of the word of God
[49:41] is and I've chose even this font as you
[49:44] would I think it's the font that Calvin
[49:46] wrote in this was his handwriting for
[49:48] all you homeschool moms take comfort and
[49:51] knowing that this is the way uh what
[49:53] Calvin's handwriting looked like and
[49:55] that comic Calvin and Hobbs
[49:57] and I was thinking about how that he
[50:00] lived in this imaginary world
[50:02] fascinating world and he's always doing
[50:05] you know these uh Rascal things right
[50:08] Dennis the Menace type things and always
[50:10] so innocent and quite an imagination and
[50:12] I was considering well what if Calvin
[50:15] never grew up from that
[50:17] imagination from that childlike behavior
[50:20] and that way that he saw everything and
[50:22] he could never see it from his parents
[50:23] perspective he never saw it from his
[50:25] dad's perspective it was was always just
[50:27] he he lived in his own world one of my
[50:30] favorite ones is when Calvin is at an
[50:32] end table in the living room and he's
[50:33] got a hammer in his hand and there's
[50:35] Nails in the coffee table and he's just
[50:37] going Bam Bam Bam and you hear his
[50:40] in the frame
[50:42] Calvin and she's running and you see her
[50:44] sprinting through the house and she
[50:46] stops and she says what are you
[50:50] doing and he
[50:52] goes is that a trick
[50:55] question in other words
[50:58] seems pretty obvious to me I'm nailing
[51:00] Nails in your coffee table and it shows
[51:03] that to the child he knows exactly what
[51:05] he's doing but to the parent she
[51:07] recognizes the boundaries she recognizes
[51:09] the the lack of respect of the different
[51:11] things she realizes this is maybe to be
[51:13] expected with Calvin but he needs to
[51:15] realize you don't do this kind of
[51:19] stuff and so that's you maybe I didn't
[51:22] mean to go down that route but I do it
[51:25] maybe sometimes just to just to be able
[51:27] to bring us all in to be able to relate
[51:28] to the particular thought but the title
[51:31] and even my title slide this title I
[51:32] want to paint a
[51:34] picture and I phras I felt led to phrase
[51:36] it this way when the youngans don't grow
[51:38] up that they would convey in this
[51:39] picture convey a warning of the
[51:41] consequences for not maturing or at
[51:43] least the urgency in the sense of
[51:44] necessity to mature in Ecclesiastes
[51:47] 10:16 it says wo to them o land when thy
[51:50] King is a child and thy princes eat in
[51:52] the
[51:53] morning it is a shame it is a woe it is
[51:56] a dread it is a for boing when the child
[51:59] is a boy when he is a youth when he
[52:02] differs nothing from a
[52:03] servant because he needs to be told what
[52:06] to do he doesn't have the power and the
[52:09] character to carry things out well to
[52:11] you when you're King as a child and when
[52:12] the princes eat in the morning in know
[52:14] words they always inclined to satisfy
[52:16] the urges of the flesh first and not
[52:18] observe what is right first it's
[52:21] speaking of emotional being emotionally
[52:24] immature whoa it's this passionate C of
[52:26] grief and this despair because if your
[52:29] King as a child and your princes that
[52:30] are supposed to do what is right eat in
[52:32] the morning for selfish reasons you're
[52:34] doomed to failure because your
[52:36] leadership is immature self- serving
[52:39] selfish in 2 Timothy 2:22 I'd like to
[52:42] add it to this wo to you when your king
[52:44] is a youth flee also youthful lust but
[52:46] follow righteousness Faith charity peace
[52:49] with them that call on the Lord out of a
[52:50] pure
[52:54] heart remaining emot Ally immature
[52:57] that's why I says well when you're King
[52:58] as a child remaining emotionally
[53:00] immature keeps One Forever under the
[53:02] grips of these youthful desires youthful
[53:06] inclinations to pound nails into coffee
[53:08] tables to to imagine things to reach
[53:12] after fleshly things if one remains a
[53:15] youth they'll always be subject to the
[53:17] passions of
[53:20] Youth and say well what about when we
[53:22] all become young again your character
[53:25] ain't going to be young
[53:29] [Music]
[53:30] right I say I say this i' I've been
[53:32] holding it off maybe but when brother
[53:35] Brandon was asked what age would you
[53:36] want to live and he said that that
[53:38] senior age where the wisdom is he's been
[53:42] settled out he's learned he's grown that
[53:44] that's where he wanted to come back not
[53:45] as a 21y old why because it's character
[53:48] it's knowledge it's wisdom it's
[53:49] experience now if we could have Best of
[53:51] Both Worlds we'd come back 18 years old
[53:53] with the mind of the W wise the learned
[53:56] with the experience we
[53:58] have I have yet to come to the place in
[54:01] my life where I would trust myself to go
[54:03] back to 18 with what I am now but I want
[54:06] to be that I want to grow I want to grow
[54:09] to one day God can say I trust you in a
[54:11] young
[54:12] body I trust you with the power to speak
[54:14] worlds into existence I trust you to
[54:16] manage and run with everybody else the
[54:17] Millennium I hereby give you lelena
[54:20] Peninsula to do whatever you want for
[54:21] the next thousand years right like
[54:23] that's that's I want to I want to be
[54:24] that kind of son where he could trust me
[54:27] amen God grant that for
[54:30] us so these youthful lusts he says
[54:33] desires the Cravings that influence
[54:35] action of
[54:39] Youth so I want this title to convey
[54:42] this
[54:43] warning of being a child and what
[54:46] happens when you remain a
[54:49] child and I'd also like it to point to
[54:52] this true sign and evidence of the new
[54:54] birth which is the Seal of the Holy
[54:56] Ghost
[54:57] in John 14:26 but the comforter which is
[54:59] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[55:01] in my name he shall teach you all things
[55:03] and bring all things to your remembrance
[55:05] whatsoever I have said unto you so the
[55:07] function of the Holy Ghost is to teach
[55:09] you and then you remind you what he
[55:10] taught you the inside teacher which is
[55:13] the Holy Ghost he will be with you even
[55:15] in you this inside teacher will instill
[55:18] in US wisdom and knowledge and
[55:20] understanding of the truth and then this
[55:22] inside teacher will also then give us
[55:24] recall of the things he has in stilled
[55:27] so that what our life becomes is a life
[55:29] of learning and
[55:31] application there's many things that we
[55:33] learn academically and there's things
[55:35] that we learn in life and there's things
[55:36] that we'll be learning just to uh
[55:38] influence our thought process and give
[55:40] us tools to be able to analyze and
[55:41] problem solve and it's exercising the
[55:43] brain to think critically like well when
[55:45] am I ever going to use this you will use
[55:46] it if I just speak defensively maybe as
[55:49] a homeschool family who might have to
[55:51] explain the purpose or if you there
[55:53] speak defensively of of certain
[55:55] disciplines where it just seems to be
[55:56] just academic it all has some use to
[55:58] cultivate the mind and to give you uh to
[56:01] increase your aptitude in certain things
[56:02] even it's say Well when am I ever going
[56:04] to use that formula it's knowing how to
[56:06] figure things out it's knowing how to
[56:08] think and to reason things out that's in
[56:10] the natural and then the life of a
[56:11] Believer is learning the things of God
[56:13] and then making
[56:15] application and once you get into the
[56:17] higher disciplines you're not just
[56:18] learning things but you're applying them
[56:20] you're getting out of the theory and
[56:22] you're getting to more the mechanical
[56:24] and that's what the Holy Ghost wants to
[56:25] do is teach you
[56:27] and then see you remind you to apply
[56:31] it brother random in the sermon the
[56:33] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[56:34] and the Earthly bride he said the
[56:35] evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you
[56:36] can receive the word not some system but
[56:38] have a clear understand how do you know
[56:40] the word is clear and understand it
[56:42] watch it vindicate itself well you say I
[56:44] see this do it and that now that's the
[56:47] thing he's leaning in on oh yes weeds
[56:49] live the same way what do weeds live by
[56:52] the rain that
[56:54] falls and they do this and they do that
[56:56] they can do all sorts of stuff in the
[56:57] flesh he says but it's got to be the
[56:59] entire word to be the bride you have to
[57:02] be part of him he is the word and what
[57:04] part of him is it the word that's
[57:05] promised for this day when he calls his
[57:07] bride be a part of
[57:10] that we're not just a gathering of
[57:12] weeds it's not just the Clapping of
[57:14] shuck it's not all those other things
[57:16] it's the bride part it's got to be the
[57:18] entire word the Holy Ghost comes to
[57:20] teach you to give you a clear understand
[57:23] the word to know the will of God for the
[57:24] hour that we're living in to be a part
[57:25] of the word that's promised for the time
[57:27] and the moment we're living in and John
[57:30] 16: 12 and 13 I have yet many things to
[57:32] say unto you but you cannot bear them
[57:34] now how be it when the spirit of Truth
[57:36] has come he will guide you into all
[57:39] truth it's not that at the moment you
[57:41] get the Holy Ghost go I have been
[57:42] enlightened and I know all truth it's
[57:44] not some fairy tale where you just all
[57:46] you do is all of a sudden you just see
[57:47] everything in eternity it's not it's not
[57:50] the matrix it's not taking a pill never
[57:52] seen it just hear about it all the time
[57:54] but there's this idea in those things
[57:55] where it's like oh I've just tapped into
[57:57] something and I Know It All no the Holy
[57:59] Ghost in you from the soul realm is
[58:01] wanting to push out everything you've
[58:02] learned in your mind and in your body
[58:05] and re-regulate your emotions
[58:06] re-regulate your perceptions and your
[58:08] disciplines and the things you're doing
[58:10] and to guide you into all truth not just
[58:12] give you a knowledge of the truth but
[58:14] literally guide you that you may grow up
[58:16] into
[58:18] him and question and answers brother B's
[58:21] talking about the evidence of the Holy
[58:22] Ghost and and he said what is the
[58:23] evidence what's this def he says he will
[58:25] perfect it right this is what the Holy
[58:27] Ghost does he perfects what's the
[58:29] evidence you have the Holy Ghost only
[58:30] you will know it now our spirit can bear
[58:33] witness with other people's spirits but
[58:34] I think we need to be really careful in
[58:36] how we try to judge and discern there's
[58:38] times that you even have to be careful
[58:40] somebody could be worshiping praising
[58:41] God speaking in tongues dancing and
[58:43] shouting and having a wonderful time and
[58:45] you see they're bobbed here and you make
[58:47] judgment you say that's not the Holy
[58:49] Ghost that's not a child of God what are
[58:51] you doing you're Jud you could be
[58:52] judging incorrectly and we're cautioned
[58:54] not to have that kind of attitude to not
[58:56] be so quick to write people off and
[58:57] judge
[58:58] them what would it what what would that
[59:01] speak of maybe somebody's immature knew
[59:03] a couple that when they first started to
[59:04] serve the Lord they had a phrase I might
[59:05] get it wrong but every time they see
[59:07] somebody say Revelation 3:17 or 2117 or
[59:09] something like that and they would have
[59:10] a phrase they used for certain people
[59:12] that looked you know Le Dean Revelations
[59:16] 3 and they would say this about them in
[59:19] this quick knee-jerk judgment
[59:26] and it didn't end well for
[59:31] them he'll perfect it manads won't do it
[59:34] and he is the word when the Holy Ghost
[59:36] has come he will identify himself in you
[59:39] with scripture and this is a true sign
[59:41] that the Holy Ghost is in you because it
[59:43] is the word how are you going to know
[59:44] you're Overcoming By the word it's not
[59:47] how do we know everybody else is
[59:49] overcoming how do you
[59:51] know do you want to do a
[59:54] man-made wouldn't it be great if we
[59:55] could just self- fulfill
[59:57] prophecy and just say I believe that I
[1:00:01] have the Holy Ghost when I can do this
[1:00:05] or this right and be like that's great
[1:00:07] that's awesome because you can do it
[1:00:09] that's the
[1:00:11] manads he'll identify you in the word he
[1:00:13] is the word when he the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:15] come he'll identify himself in you with
[1:00:17] the scripture and that is the true sign
[1:00:19] that the Holy Ghost is in you because it
[1:00:20] is the word now look what if you spoke
[1:00:23] with tongues I just want to ask you that
[1:00:28] is is speaking in tongues scripturally
[1:00:31] okay
[1:00:33] absolutely hey I believe if you wanted
[1:00:35] it ask God to do it he'll guarant it to
[1:00:37] you give you that experience there's
[1:00:38] nothing not scriptural about
[1:00:41] it he says I just want to ask you Jesus
[1:00:43] said when the Holy Ghost come what he
[1:00:45] would do and what if you spoke with
[1:00:48] tongues jumped up and down shouted and
[1:00:49] everything else and then come to the
[1:00:52] word what is he what is he kind of
[1:00:55] identifying and pointing out to us is
[1:00:57] that we can do all these things and
[1:01:00] enjoy it it's scriptural it's how the
[1:01:03] spirit can move upon an individual but
[1:01:05] how do you where's the emphasis at the
[1:01:07] end of the day what's your attitude
[1:01:09] towards the entire word do you do all
[1:01:12] those things and look at the what the
[1:01:13] Bible says to do this N I don't know I
[1:01:15] don't know because look I I'm getting
[1:01:17] results aren't I we're having a good
[1:01:19] time over here th this is kind of work
[1:01:22] church is fun now finally after all
[1:01:25] these years
[1:01:26] you can't argue with the results and he
[1:01:29] said well tap the brakes there nothing's
[1:01:33] wrong with this but there's a real
[1:01:34] problem in your attitude towards the
[1:01:36] rest of the word and that's where the
[1:01:37] problem is what about the people that
[1:01:39] claim to be holding to the word and then
[1:01:41] they see in the word that you ought to
[1:01:42] do this or that you can do this or the
[1:01:44] spirit of God moves this way and they
[1:01:45] judge it and they speak critically of it
[1:01:47] and they're immature and they have
[1:01:48] malice and evil speaking but they're
[1:01:50] twins of the same birth wow good that
[1:01:53] are looking at the full word and picking
[1:01:55] and choosing where they want to end up
[1:01:56] on
[1:01:57] it because Jesus never said the Holy
[1:01:59] Ghost would make you cry he never said
[1:02:02] the Holy Ghost would make you scream he
[1:02:03] never said the Holy Ghost would make you
[1:02:04] dance or shout or or make you
[1:02:07] starchy Jesus said when the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] has come he told you what it would do
[1:02:11] guide you into all truth am teach you
[1:02:14] all things bring all things to
[1:02:16] remembrance I'm just reading from John
[1:02:18] 14 and John 16 there's a lot more that
[1:02:19] you could read so I'll say this although
[1:02:22] the baptism of the spirit can move you
[1:02:24] emotionally
[1:02:27] physically it can it it stimulates you
[1:02:29] there's a stimulation when the holy
[1:02:30] spirit moves do you believe that sir one
[1:02:33] of the very first times I could ever
[1:02:34] remember feeling the presence of God uh
[1:02:37] it was in the in it was in the 80s and I
[1:02:40] was just a young I I think I was less
[1:02:41] than 10 years old and the presence of
[1:02:44] God is moving in a camp meeting and I'm
[1:02:46] sitting I'm sitting down on this folding
[1:02:48] chair and I'm just weeping and weeping
[1:02:51] and
[1:02:52] crying cuz I know this is this is beyond
[1:02:58] human and I remember crying and weeping
[1:03:01] and I looked over to my buddy who lived
[1:03:02] in the air we were visiting and uh and
[1:03:05] he was just just across the aisle and
[1:03:07] I'm just sobbing as a 8 to 10y old or
[1:03:09] whatever maybe a little younger and I
[1:03:10] look over at him this crazy like what is
[1:03:13] going on and he's
[1:03:14] going I don't know if you thought I was
[1:03:16] in trouble or he's just laughing away at
[1:03:19] me laughing at me but I was like this is
[1:03:23] real because that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:03:25] does
[1:03:26] there's uh there's I've been in meetings
[1:03:31] where the word of God just even while
[1:03:32] it's preached hits somebody so hard that
[1:03:36] he has to be carried out of the carried
[1:03:38] out of the
[1:03:40] sanctuary can't move Still
[1:03:44] Standing after the piano's done playing
[1:03:46] finally deacons come up to him it's been
[1:03:48] forever and and they're like are you
[1:03:50] okay and he's I don't know I don't know
[1:03:53] I don't know I don't know what happened
[1:03:54] and there's a worldly kid who liked a
[1:03:56] girl in the church who visited that day
[1:03:58] cuz he wanted to get her number or
[1:04:00] whatever he's sitting down next to him
[1:04:02] he can't move
[1:04:03] either just a really kid knows nothing
[1:04:05] about church and the movement of God
[1:04:07] he's like sitting there and he's kind of
[1:04:08] like yeah you know good thing I was
[1:04:11] sitting down and they have to help him
[1:04:14] out what did the Holy Ghost can do that
[1:04:17] now did that vindicate the guy who
[1:04:19] preached that
[1:04:20] day oh well
[1:04:28] all right I accept
[1:04:30] it it didn't didn't vindicate the kid in
[1:04:34] the neighborhood nor did it vindicate
[1:04:36] the young man who was so slain in the
[1:04:37] spirit he couldn't move went home they
[1:04:39] had a Revival in their house but the
[1:04:40] marriage didn't last both of them split
[1:04:43] up gone their separate ways not serving
[1:04:45] the lord what that's that's a that's a
[1:04:47] sad tale right I still believe there's
[1:04:50] restoration I still think there can be
[1:04:51] salvation I desire when I think of that
[1:04:53] couple I still have a letter they wrote
[1:04:55] after the began to work in their lives
[1:04:56] and they knew God was
[1:04:58] real and I wish that they could have
[1:05:00] been uh nurtured in the word of God I
[1:05:02] believe they would have come to that
[1:05:07] experience but it just goes to show God
[1:05:09] moves that
[1:05:11] way although the spirit of God can
[1:05:15] stimulate and do that I want you to
[1:05:16] understand that's not the specific
[1:05:18] purpose of the Holy
[1:05:20] Ghost the specific purpose of the Holy
[1:05:23] Ghost isn't to stimulate Sensations or
[1:05:24] emotions in Acts chap 2:1 17 quoting
[1:05:28] Joel it says and it shall come to pass
[1:05:29] in the last days say God I will pour out
[1:05:31] my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons
[1:05:33] and your daughters shall prophesy and
[1:05:34] your young men shall see visions and
[1:05:36] your old men shall dream
[1:05:38] dreams because the spirit's poured up
[1:05:40] out poured out upon All Flesh and what
[1:05:42] is it going to do it's going to cause
[1:05:43] some to there's going to be gifts
[1:05:45] there's going to be things that manifest
[1:05:46] the rain is going to fall and what are
[1:05:48] the just going to do those that live by
[1:05:50] faith those who have been born again
[1:05:51] when the rain falls they're going to
[1:05:52] enjoy
[1:05:53] it let's not become so formal and start
[1:05:56] you that when the rain falls we're
[1:05:57] worried well I don't really will I want
[1:06:00] I don't want to give a false evidence
[1:06:01] well come on just be
[1:06:03] yourself listen if it's in you to dance
[1:06:05] if it's in you to shout if it's in you
[1:06:06] to cry just be yourself just don't tell
[1:06:09] yourself when you leave that that's good
[1:06:10] enough come back to the EV the evidence
[1:06:13] come back to the emphasis to remember
[1:06:15] the emphasis isn't on the stimulation
[1:06:18] the emphasis is on the revelation of the
[1:06:20] word of God in your heart am the
[1:06:22] emphasis on the personal knowledge of
[1:06:24] Jesus Christ the influence he's having
[1:06:26] on your daily life and whether or not
[1:06:28] you can look back and say I know that my
[1:06:30] sins have been forgiven and I know that
[1:06:32] the word is working mightily in me not
[1:06:34] because I can come to church and shut my
[1:06:35] mouth and stay quiet and be still
[1:06:37] because the bride needs to sit still and
[1:06:39] she needs to do this and she needs to or
[1:06:41] because I dance and run the aisles but
[1:06:42] because I see the trajectory of Christ
[1:06:44] in my
[1:06:47] life I'll pour out a spirit on All Flesh
[1:06:50] and the just they rejoice in
[1:06:52] it I believe that's why brother brandom
[1:06:54] kind of makes the statement sometimes
[1:06:55] that it has no emotion bury it cuz it's
[1:06:57] dead it can't be
[1:07:00] stimulated but the unjust will do the
[1:07:02] same
[1:07:03] thing the same rain that makes the wheat
[1:07:07] dance makes the weeds
[1:07:10] dance and this spirit being poured out
[1:07:13] upon All Flesh is not just some worked
[1:07:14] up emotional panic-stricken
[1:07:17] people it's not something that you look
[1:07:19] you you you give names to and and run
[1:07:21] down and criticize this is the general
[1:07:23] effect of the spirit on all people
[1:07:26] and the reason why you have to be
[1:07:27] careful not to speak against it is
[1:07:29] because if it is the spirit you would
[1:07:32] never want to speak one thing against it
[1:07:34] right so if someone testifies they could
[1:07:36] be a ranked sinner they could be someone
[1:07:38] who lives an ungodly life but if they
[1:07:39] testify to you that God healed them then
[1:07:41] what you should say is I believe God's A
[1:07:43] Healer if somebody testifies they felt
[1:07:46] the spirit of God you say I believe you
[1:07:48] because God lets his Spirit be made
[1:07:50] known in certain ways and there's a way
[1:07:51] that we can rejoice and fellowship a l
[1:07:54] class of people but we must realize that
[1:07:56] although the the general the Holy Spirit
[1:07:59] can be poured out generally and many
[1:08:02] people can be made to enjoy it and have
[1:08:04] this effect upon the mind and the body
[1:08:06] the specific work of the holy spirit is
[1:08:08] to perfect and to mature his
[1:08:13] body even the rain that falls on the
[1:08:15] weeds and brings them to their maturity
[1:08:17] wasn't meant for their maturity it was
[1:08:20] meant for your maturity the rain is
[1:08:23] meant the former the latter however you
[1:08:25] want to say it the teaching the Harvest
[1:08:27] whatever reain you want to talk about
[1:08:28] it's meant to bring seed to
[1:08:31] perfection in the church age book
[1:08:33] brother BR said the word always comes to
[1:08:34] the truly spirit filled that is the
[1:08:37] evidence of being filled the holy ghost
[1:08:38] that is what Jesus said would be the
[1:08:40] evidence think very deeply about this
[1:08:44] because I'm wanting to emphasize now
[1:08:45] when youngans don't grow up the title is
[1:08:47] meant to convey the true evidence of the
[1:08:49] holy spirit it's meant to convey the
[1:08:51] specific work that the Holy Ghost is
[1:08:53] intended in the individual it may
[1:08:55] manifest in a lot of things and never
[1:08:58] take that away from a Believer
[1:08:59] especially someone tends to cry if
[1:09:01] someone tends to shout someone tends to
[1:09:03] giggle I I kind of have this aptitude
[1:09:05] when the word is really really good and
[1:09:06] I'm sitting in my seat and the word's
[1:09:08] really good I laugh a lot and that may
[1:09:10] just be my nature and that doesn't mean
[1:09:12] that somebody I look over there and
[1:09:13] somebody else is just
[1:09:14] going I'm
[1:09:17] like that's not what you
[1:09:19] do there's a there's a there's a certain
[1:09:22] personality some of us are going to have
[1:09:23] and we're going to manifest it
[1:09:26] but the evidence of being truly spirit
[1:09:27] filled is the word comes to you so what
[1:09:29] ought we to emphasize what ought we to
[1:09:31] rejoice in when the word opens up to us
[1:09:33] when the word comes to
[1:09:34] us he says I want you to note very
[1:09:37] carefully that Jesus did not say the
[1:09:39] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[1:09:41] Ghost was speaking in tongues
[1:09:42] interpreting prophesying or shouting and
[1:09:43] dancing I like the way he combines those
[1:09:45] last two he said the evidence would be
[1:09:47] that you would be in the truth you would
[1:09:49] be in the word for your age evidence has
[1:09:52] to do with receiving that word yes sir
[1:09:55] good
[1:09:56] and this is exactly what Paul is
[1:09:58] referring to when he says but when that
[1:10:00] which is perfect has come then that
[1:10:01] which is in part shall be done
[1:10:05] away when that which is perfect is come
[1:10:08] in other words when that which is
[1:10:09] perfect is made known when the word is
[1:10:11] opened up not a man-made not a public
[1:10:15] show but Supernatural things are
[1:10:18] imparted for the in time right for the
[1:10:20] time that you're living in
[1:10:26] it's when all these little things that
[1:10:29] are indicative of
[1:10:34] childhood and things that relate to
[1:10:36] adolescence and toddlerhood and growing
[1:10:38] up and
[1:10:39] teenagehood it's when we come to the
[1:10:41] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:10:43] Divine Vindication amen that we begin to
[1:10:45] grow up it is perfecting in other words
[1:10:48] it's fulfilling purpose so Paul says in
[1:10:51] 1 Corinthians 13:11 when I was a child I
[1:10:53] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:10:54] I thought was a child but when I became
[1:10:56] a man I put away childish things was
[1:10:59] that child it's a babe it's childish an
[1:11:02] infant actually remember we said on
[1:11:03] Wednesday night covers a spectrum an
[1:11:05] infant a toddler a little kid a
[1:11:09] minor and so if there's a an age at
[1:11:12] which you achieve status in the natural
[1:11:14] then as long as you're not 18 you're
[1:11:16] considered a minor not an adult or
[1:11:18] you're under 21 you're a minor right and
[1:11:20] we see that legal as far as the legality
[1:11:22] of the law and certain benchmarks for
[1:11:26] allowing certain behaviors or consent to
[1:11:28] vote to go to war to buy alcohol
[1:11:30] cigarettes all these different things
[1:11:31] because there's this spectrum of consent
[1:11:33] and age and immaturity to be unskilled
[1:11:36] and to be untaught when I was a
[1:11:39] child I acted like a child I had certain
[1:11:43] characteristics in me that manifested
[1:11:45] that were emphasized that came out as a
[1:11:47] child but when I became a man he's using
[1:11:49] this to distinguish an adult from a
[1:11:51] child when I attained that state that
[1:11:52] was fit for my aptitude and for my
[1:11:55] purpose I put away childish things he
[1:11:59] said I became more emotionally
[1:12:01] mature we can't leave who we are and who
[1:12:04] we were in our infancy even as a person
[1:12:06] today we are a product of what we were
[1:12:07] when we were six years old we're a
[1:12:09] product of the decisions we made when we
[1:12:11] were 15 we can never separate ourselves
[1:12:13] from what we have
[1:12:15] been it's a part of us
[1:12:17] now but we reach forth
[1:12:21] yes the same goes for our spiritual
[1:12:24] birth Paul in Corinthians 13 1
[1:12:26] Corinthians 13 is using this analogy of
[1:12:28] the believer of spiritually maturing or
[1:12:31] perfecting and you find this in the
[1:12:33] message of the hour where brother
[1:12:34] brandham is saying when he preaches uh
[1:12:37] the signs of the time he says I want to
[1:12:38] preach a subject called the countdown
[1:12:40] and see how far we've
[1:12:41] progressed and he teaches in that sermon
[1:12:43] how we've left a Pentecostal age and
[1:12:45] we're coming up like the pyramid to what
[1:12:47] he says this last step has to come into
[1:12:50] Perfection preaches perfect Faith he
[1:12:52] says we're coming now to the Perfection
[1:12:54] because people have to come to that in
[1:12:55] order for the Rapture this last great
[1:12:58] step is in to Perfection it's not
[1:13:01] sinless
[1:13:02] Perfection because in the flesh we've
[1:13:04] sinned we've all sinned and fallen short
[1:13:06] of the glory of God so what does God do
[1:13:08] he gives us the sinless perfection in
[1:13:09] our soul and Jesus Christ who knew no
[1:13:12] sin the Bible says and being made
[1:13:15] perfect and he was per he was made
[1:13:17] perfect he learned obedience by the
[1:13:18] things which he suffered and being made
[1:13:20] perfect became so there was a Perfection
[1:13:23] to Christ and Christ was sinless so our
[1:13:26] Perfection is not sinless Perfection we
[1:13:28] never have a wrong thought we never do
[1:13:30] anything wrong but it's coming to
[1:13:32] maturity it's coming to our place and
[1:13:34] our position because we've got to come
[1:13:35] to that in order for the Rapture why
[1:13:37] because this is not the Pentecostal age
[1:13:40] this is the bright age because this is
[1:13:42] not the L to see in age of the
[1:13:43] restoration of the gifts this is the
[1:13:45] rapture
[1:13:48] time as Jesus said in Mark 4: 29 but
[1:13:51] when the fruit is brought forth you know
[1:13:53] what that means when it presents itself
[1:13:56] fully am CU you can see fruit on the
[1:13:58] vine you say oh well it's brought forth
[1:14:00] the word is no not yet you haven't seen
[1:14:04] it yet I'm looking right at it I can
[1:14:07] tell it's a raspberry that's not as good
[1:14:09] as it gets the life in that will bring
[1:14:12] that to a point where it can't get any
[1:14:14] good her no more time in the vine will
[1:14:16] make it any more mature it'll be what we
[1:14:19] call is ripe it was green but now it's
[1:14:23] what it needs to be what it was meant to
[1:14:25] to be and Jesus says As soon as it
[1:14:27] presents itself fully immediately he
[1:14:30] putteth in the sickle because the
[1:14:31] Harvest has
[1:14:33] come what is that
[1:14:36] maturity brother Bram said Jesus said by
[1:14:38] their fruits not tongues or emotions but
[1:14:40] by their fruits you shall know them so
[1:14:43] that is the fruit of the spirit it's God
[1:14:45] unfolding himself want you think about
[1:14:46] maturity about growing up God unfolding
[1:14:49] himself in humility sweetness and every
[1:14:51] day the same amen there's some days I've
[1:14:55] feel like I got it it's something about
[1:14:57] a man that stays right with the word
[1:14:59] every time that he sees the word he
[1:15:01] punctuates it with an amen no matter
[1:15:03] what the other people say he believes
[1:15:07] it that's what Jesus said the evidence
[1:15:10] would be by your fruits and he says not
[1:15:13] tongues or emotions but the fruit of the
[1:15:16] spirit the
[1:15:18] fruit presenting
[1:15:20] itself as Paul said then I now it's part
[1:15:24] now it's dark now it's cloudy but then
[1:15:26] face to face then I shall know even also
[1:15:28] as I am known eye to eye what's it speak
[1:15:30] of stature growing up to the stature of
[1:15:32] the father amen you can see eye to eye
[1:15:35] to know as I am known that's a
[1:15:37] maturity that's to actually see
[1:15:39] ourselves amen the story is told that
[1:15:42] the young man when he was 18 years old
[1:15:43] was leaving to go to college and he was
[1:15:45] so sickened by how little his parents
[1:15:47] knew 4 to 5 years later he graduates
[1:15:49] from college gets a real job out there
[1:15:51] in the world comes back and spends some
[1:15:52] time with his family he's shocked at how
[1:15:54] much they learned in such a short period
[1:15:55] of
[1:15:57] time the idea conveyed with that is that
[1:16:00] he had wisened and realized that they
[1:16:02] knew better all along to know as I am
[1:16:05] known is maturity as I said Wednesday
[1:16:08] night this is the process of character
[1:16:10] development growing into mature
[1:16:13] Believers am in Ephesians 5:1 he says be
[1:16:16] ye therefore followers of God as dear
[1:16:18] children that means imitators I'll just
[1:16:20] come back to this at a later time to
[1:16:22] expound upon it more but I just feel to
[1:16:23] kind of throw this out there as these
[1:16:24] little seeds musicians feel free to come
[1:16:26] to your
[1:16:30] instruments be imitators of
[1:16:33] God to be a son to be a child of God to
[1:16:36] be a son or daughter of God implies the
[1:16:39] absolute necessity for of
[1:16:41] imitation the absolute necessity of
[1:16:44] Desiring to become in the father's
[1:16:48] image be ye therefore followers of God
[1:16:51] runs parallel with Matthew 548 that says
[1:16:54] be therefore for
[1:16:56] perfect as a matter of fact I would
[1:16:58] argue that they are the same saying be
[1:17:01] therefore followers of God as dear
[1:17:03] children who can learn from the father
[1:17:06] emulate the father do what the father
[1:17:07] says obey the will of the father in
[1:17:09] desire to achieve that image and
[1:17:12] likeness of your heavenly Father which
[1:17:13] is perfect be therefore perfect even as
[1:17:15] your father which is in heaven is
[1:17:17] perfect that word there perfect means
[1:17:19] complete perfect Integrity perfect
[1:17:22] virtue it means to be fully grown and
[1:17:24] mature to grow into the stature of him
[1:17:27] that is
[1:17:29] perfect this was spoken in the law in
[1:17:31] Deuteronomy 18:13 Thou shalt be perfect
[1:17:34] with the Lord thy God that was God's
[1:17:37] purpose and plan from the very beginning
[1:17:39] from Deuteronomy 18 to numbers 18 and
[1:17:41] Beyond God's will for you was Perfection
[1:17:43] and the law could not do that but Christ
[1:17:48] can and we can develop in the natural
[1:17:51] and just eat right not kill yourself
[1:17:53] through your nutrition
[1:17:55] habits and you can and let me just say
[1:17:57] this everybody has a body type you know
[1:17:59] some are shaped like a pear some are
[1:18:00] shaped like an asparagus you know
[1:18:02] everybody has their different shapes and
[1:18:04] uh I would like just to find mine I
[1:18:07] think it's covered up but there's a
[1:18:10] there's a way that you will just if you
[1:18:11] eat correctly even sometimes according
[1:18:13] to what your DNA tells you it should be
[1:18:15] and what you might have allergies to if
[1:18:17] you just Eat Right your body will
[1:18:19] develop within the bounds of its
[1:18:22] DNA but there's certain deficiencies
[1:18:24] that one could have as they're being
[1:18:26] nurtured in certain critical stages of
[1:18:27] life if something's lacking you may not
[1:18:29] be able to physically develop within
[1:18:32] your full potential can have great
[1:18:34] ramifications just in the natural and
[1:18:36] then as one begins to grow the same
[1:18:37] could be so with certain skills and
[1:18:39] aptitudes you could have been the
[1:18:40] greatest basketball player of all time
[1:18:42] but you never picked up a basketball you
[1:18:45] weren't willing to put in the time you
[1:18:46] weren't willing to put in the effort so
[1:18:48] there is in the natural this growing and
[1:18:50] this increasing a and this uh coming
[1:18:53] into your full poal IAL as an
[1:18:56] individual
[1:18:58] emotionally and physically you could
[1:19:01] just do that as a person with certain
[1:19:04] disciplines but that would only go so
[1:19:07] far as the law would allow you to go you
[1:19:09] could keep the law
[1:19:11] perfect but there is a life in Christ
[1:19:14] wherein once the soul has been born
[1:19:15] again God wants you not to fit the image
[1:19:17] of the world but to fit the image of the
[1:19:19] Divine and he wants you to grow it was
[1:19:22] always his will it's always what he was
[1:19:24] was testifying in the house of the Lord
[1:19:26] is
[1:19:33] perfection Jesus
[1:19:35] said except you be converted and become
[1:19:38] as little
[1:19:40] children what does it mean that in our
[1:19:43] conversion we become as children we
[1:19:45] become babes that then must learn and
[1:19:49] grow and brother brm said I believe that
[1:19:51] we've been children long enough God is
[1:19:54] going to turn his church into manhood
[1:19:57] now and we played and frolicked as
[1:20:00] children listen the play and Frolic
[1:20:02] nothing wrong with
[1:20:04] it sometime the the Frolic is a lot
[1:20:06] better than be that starchy old moaning
[1:20:08] and groaning dead
[1:20:10] tree but he says we're going to have to
[1:20:13] put away childish things and take on
[1:20:14] manhood
[1:20:16] maturity that's the time we're living in
[1:20:19] right now is growing up
[1:20:22] maturing now we have to use wisdom
[1:20:24] because if we are actually growing up
[1:20:25] and maturing we have patience for those
[1:20:27] who are young on we have patience for
[1:20:30] the young people get to experience
[1:20:31] wonderful things at their camps that may
[1:20:33] look really different than what goes on
[1:20:34] here but thank God the youth have their
[1:20:36] chance thank God they have their Outlet
[1:20:39] thank God they enjoy the certain things
[1:20:41] that relate to enthusiasm and have a
[1:20:42] great experience genuine outpouring of
[1:20:44] the Holy Ghost and and thank God that
[1:20:46] there's Real Men of God that'll continue
[1:20:48] to emphasize the right things to where
[1:20:50] they're not making a decision of leaving
[1:20:51] the divine presence of God at camp and
[1:20:53] going right back to the Catholic Church
[1:20:54] church called informal dead Church
[1:20:56] they've got at home but they realize
[1:20:58] they all have their place and they all
[1:21:00] have their purpose Let The Children Play
[1:21:02] Let Them Frolic as we do now even with
[1:21:04] our own children but be purposeful and
[1:21:06] have a vision that what we want them to
[1:21:08] do is grow yes sir we want them to grow
[1:21:11] up because en tight the bride has
[1:21:12] reached that age and therefore that's
[1:21:14] God's purpose in every age now as we
[1:21:17] come to the
[1:21:19] Lord God bless you let's stand let's
[1:21:21] just pray together now
