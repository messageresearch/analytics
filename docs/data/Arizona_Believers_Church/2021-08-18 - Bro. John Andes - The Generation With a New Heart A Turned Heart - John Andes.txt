TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so tonight i want to speak on the generation with a new heart the generation with a new heart and then we want to speak on a turned heart so ezekiel chapter 11 verse 19. the bible says and i will give them one heart let's all say one heart god is speaking and i will put a new spirit within you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh so it sounds like a heart surgery doesn't it it sounds like a heart surgery god is doing this work i'm going to give you one heart i'll put a new spirit within you now take the stony heart out of your flesh and give them a heart of flesh can you go to chapter 18 verse 31. brother john has made this beautiful slide for us tonight i i don't think the internet group can see this but brother john made this up brother john phalem amen ezekiel 18 31 cast away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will you die o house of israel it almost makes this verse almost makes it sound like it's something that you're doing doesn't it so god's not going to force you god's not an abusive husband and he's not somebody even though he knows what's best that he dominates and forces you but he's actually encouraging you to move away from your past or your transgression and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why would you die i think that's good counsel tonight why would we live in spiritual death when god is inviting us with arms wide open to have a new heart be a ground that god can just speak to and let it happen you don't have to work it up you don't have to get all nervous and make it happen you just need to let the word have its effect as you hear the word just receive it i know i'm a new minister and it's you know you've only had maybe brother cadre diggs and maybe a few others this last year but open up your heart to the word and it can happen to you like it did in the beginning let there be light let there be healing let there be joy let there be peace ezekiel 36 if you'd like to turn there with us while you're standing ezekiel 36 verse 26 and 27 ezekiel must have tapped into the inspiration ezekiel 36 26 a new heart let's say new heart a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh isn't this wonderful and the person that said this has never lied he's never lied so you can take this word tonight as an absolute as a guarantee i'll be with you i'll be in you i'm going to do this verse 27. so it's not just a new heart and a new spirit but he says and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them praise god now let's turn to malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6. this is a very familiar scripture to probably most of you in this room and i pray as the year as the months go by that the lord add more to this congregation that maybe don't know it as well as you do but um i believe there's new ones to come hallelujah there's going to be new people off the streets or out that don't even know the lord it's going to come to the message be a good lighthouse let the good light shine we're not here to watch a movie tonight or we're not at a baseball game this is to hear the word of god just let your light shine malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 this is the same one that was speaking ezekiel says i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart this is our subject tonight a turned heart he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse now that's you you are the ones whose hearts are being turned back amen for many years malachi 4 you thought was william branham the prophet that's only part of it he did his work where's the generation whose hearts are going to be turned back where are the children where are the ones that must say here i am lord god bless you you can have your seats there's a lot of qualities about your pastor that i appreciate but one of them i've noticed he preaches about an hour almost every service so uh i'm gonna try to do that tonight amen and if i go a few minutes over it's because i'm not as good as brother aaron when i grow up i'll be like brother aaron amen but i've noticed he does really good he'll just cut it right off and speak an hour and i think that's good for us say man you got to drive home tonight and i want you to be safe and i don't want anyone's car going down the river amen amen don't drive across the road that's all flooded i did learn that in arizona all right amen tonight i'd like to speak on the generation with a new heart the generation with a new heart and we'd like to look at a subject a turned heart out of malachi because little did you realize before you were born when malachi was written that it would be prophesying that a prophet would come at the end time and that that ministry would have the power to turn the heart of the last day children it would turn your heart not your head so as i was just reading the scripture today and i was thinking of isaiah where it says they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles and they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint i say lord teach us how to wait but then in psalms it says because of his strength i will wait upon thee because of his strength i will wait upon thee for the lord is my defense it's almost like a paradox brother michael where it says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength how many love that scripture just wait upon the lord just keep waiting until god brings it to pass but then psalms 59 verse 9 says because of his strength will i wait upon thee so we need his strength tonight to wait until he gives us a new heart and have patience on one another because god is beautiful for situations are you bringing up some of these scriptures brother john i'm testing you brother oh just the ones you gave me can you find psalms 48 verse 2 how many have ever been in a situation you say i'm in a situation the lord is beautiful for your situation psalms 48 verse 2 says beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king god is known in her palaces for a refuge our god is beautiful for situation hallelujah proverbs 4 verse 23 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life watch your heart guard your heart proverbs 4 verse 23 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life we need to establish tonight that the heart is really the heart of the matter it's the center that's our title tonight the generation with a new heart it's the main thing it's the middle of your life it's it's more than just the organ that's in the center of your body that's in charge of the circulation of your blood or we would say it's the seat of your physical life but it's also the center of your spiritual life your heart tonight we could talk a lot about your body and about your spirit but really the heart of the matter from out of the heart of the matter come all the issues of life really tonight i i might not know very you very much in the outward person but your heart is demonstrating uh whether you're alive or not and i'm not just speaking naturally but spiritually the heart is the fountain and the seed of your passion it's the seed of your desires and it makes up you as a person all of your appetites all of your affections your purposes in life your endeavors in life your understanding and the faculty of your intelligence is more than what's in your mind it's your will it's your character tonight can i ask you where is the generation whose hearts are going to be turned back not just to another church not to just another gener a denomination not just another church in the message some of you have come out of other churches some of you have had other ministries some of you have come off the streets and you know that in the world the things of life and the matters and the situation was not always beautiful satan is a rough taskmaster isn't he brothers and satan did not treat you well but our god is beautiful for situation he's he is uh beautiful for the matters of life that really matter out of your heart keep your heart for out of it are the issues of life that's where um it's the seed of your emotions and all of your desires and it's the central part of everything and that's why god needed to send a prophet to this generation it wasn't just changing the music he wasn't just changing you know how people preach but he was changing the hearts of the predestinated hallelujah where is the generation that would say lord give me a new heart i need a new spirit lord i realize that i have nothing to bring but filthiness i was born in sin shaped in iniquity all of us were brother john was born in jeffersonville raised in the branham tabernacle and been in the message for 49 years our whole life but it's got to go beyond our head knowledge it's got to go beyond knowing brother branham or knowing his family or saying brother branham said or being able to quote the bible there's got to be a generation that says my heart has been turned back hallelujah my heart has been turned so tonight when we speak about that generation i'm just going to get into what brother branham said about this in just a moment the generation has to do with the group of believers whether you're young or whether you're old so when we say the children our hearts have been turned back it's more than just the young people it's young and old that are alive and that are remaining until the coming of the lord there's going to be a generation of believers no matter our backgrounds no matter what we've gone through in our lives that is going to grab ahold of this word and it's going to go in the rapture i believe the arizona believer's church is founded on that i believe that your foundation it's not our backgrounds it's that matter it's what we believe it's it's who we are in christ it's what the word has said you are hallelujah we might come broken but god is a healer of the brokenhearted the wounded ones so the generation with a new heart we read that in ezekiel when it talks about that god would give you a new heart can you put back that first slide of our opening one that shows uh brother john that you did so well on that showed the title and the scripture ezekiel says i will give you a new heart i just want you to listen real closely a new heart and a new spirit and ezekiel 36 said i will give you my spirit so it's not going to be you trying the best you can or you trying to serve the lord or you say brother john i'm trying to live right we got it all backwards the holy spirit is god coming inside of you and living his own life we got to get it out of me trying and me doing and me going it's him coming inside of you and living his own life and he does that pretty easily god's pr he does that pretty well would you all agree when god takes over it's done right but we get our hands on it it just messes up everything i mean we're not taking a vote tonight and all doing the best we can we're we are actually receiving the heart of god receiving the word of god and just let him do it let him manifest his perfect will so where is that generation that will say not my will but thine be done where is that individual or family or church that will say i am part of the generation who has a new heart or a new spirit or his spirit my spirit which is his holy spirit his heart his word what he wants to do in the matter now in malachi chapter 4 5 and 6 that we read and most of you know it by heart that we would we would receive a prophet that would turn our hearts back brother branham spoke about that in the church age book page 324 malachi 4 5 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children now that's very good brother john thank you for bringing that up because we see in verse six two parts of this elijah's ministry is to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that's number one number two is the heart of the children to their fathers but brother branham in the church age book talked about that first part the heart of the fathers to the children and he was quoting luke 1 17. don't bring that up brother john just keep malachi up because it talks about how brother branham says that first part was already accomplished in the ministry of john the baptist hallelujah john the baptist turned the hearts of the fathers to the children comma and the heart of the children to their fathers brother branham goes on to say he's quoting luke 1 17 about the spirit of elias and how it would come and prepare a people for the lord he said in the ministry of john the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children we know that because jesus said so but it does not say that the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers that is yet to take place here's a prophet speaking in the church age book that that is yet to take place that was the anointing of elijah in our day is to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers can i ask you tonight that believe the message of the hour william branham fulfilled that part of elijah coming do we believe that but where are the children whose hearts are to be turned back because we could talk about his brother branham a prophet was it a you know thor missile that went up and what was it you know the head of christ we could talk about the bridge you know friends you could talk all evening about all the discrepancies you know but there is a truth to it all and they've tried to humanize it and discount it and you know why don't they just go into the world and just go out why do they fight it so much it's because it's the truth people that leave the message and they want to deface the message well why don't they deface the catholic church or the pentecostal church or something you know they want to attack the message it's because it's an evil spirit and they many times are worse than even people in the world i don't know if you've experienced that here in phoenix but globally i've seen that people that leave the message become more weird than people that are in the world i'm just saying that nicely that their hair gets pink and red and blue and their fingernails toenails and their attitude and they become so nasty pasty now and they just get so much in a certain way god never let that happen to me give us a new heart lord give us a new spirit don't ever let me get contrary and bitter brother branham said that is yet to take place where the hearts of the children would be turned back the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the pentecostal fathers john got the fathers ready for jesus to welcome the children into the fold this prophet upon whom the spirit of elijah falls will prepare the children to welcome back jesus how many believe brother branham was a prophet i just want to read that one more time this prophet upon whom the spirit of elijah falls will prepare the children to welcome back jesus so there's an anointing tonight on a generation of last day children and people whose hearts are to be turned back to perfect faith there was a perfect word that was spoken for us that is to bring perfect faith where is that tonight hallelujah i believe i'm looking at some of the people that's going to make it with perfect faith whose hearts and this was the word here verse 6 he shall turn the heart he shall turn the heart what's going to happen to the people that's alive that's going to turn a turn heart it's two-fold you're going to be turned from something whatever it was in your past you're going to turn from that but we've got to turn to something that's greater we there's a coming out of there's a coming out of the world there's a coming out of our own thoughts there's a coming out of the church world but friends we got to go into we got to go into that new heart we got to go into the message of the hour we got to eat the word we got to feed off of that prophecy we believe a mighty angel has come we believe that that earthly messenger was sent to us but now we've got to eat the book we've got to eat the word we've got to feast on these promises and then prophesy again where are those people that are hungry for the word of god hungry they people used to be so passionate about sports or passionate about movies today they that you know they become so passionate about their media obsession they become so addicted to digital things and electronics amen there's a lot of people that's not addicted to drugs or to alcohol or to pills or to gaming but they are addicted to their digital device do we all say amen even you see it creeping in amongst message people and i know a lot of message people even ministers and even good families you know the greatest global pandemic tonight is not coved 19. it's the virus and a very serious disease of devices electronic devices that that actually is like a drug it's called dopamine that release chemicals into your brain you that are that know more about these things than even i do social media and technology with uh cell phones and computers and all the dings and the buzzes people can be on their cell phone and obsessed with it and addicted to it and and you you wouldn't dare say oh i think you've been on your device too long they all shake their head and no i'm not they're addicted to it more than coffee more than drugs more than uh pornography they're addicted to their device and if we're not careful friends it can become a disease that clouds our mind and clouds our spirit and and actually if we're not careful it will open up a person's a soul by entering through those gates of the mind and spirit you can open up yourself to a wrong spirit i'm speaking to the heart of the matter god open up our hearts to your word let us be discerning of the time we're living in and not get lazy but be spiritually in tune god brought you out of drugs or out of alcohol or out of a church that was maybe twisted but friends don't get caught in another trap hallelujah god turn our hearts turn means to return or to turn back means to come back like the prodigal son let's come back home or like a prodigal daughter or a young lady that might be in depression or might be suffering from bitterness or trouble it's time to come back to your right mind i'm inviting you back to right thinking receive the heart of god he's not double minded he's not confused i think the bible says he's not the author of confusion he's not double-minded he's not he's focused he knows his will for your life it might be a mystery to you but it's not a mystery to god we say all the mysteries have been revealed well that's more than the seventh seven seals it has to do with the mystery of god about your life and that's what most of you are struggling with as finding god's will or finding his purpose you can pick up a seven church age book or pick up seven seals but it's now lord what is your will for my life what is your direction for our family what would you have for us just give me the right spirit lord so i can begin to pray i can get into your mind about this situation are we all together tonight and maybe there's a stony heart that you have that the plow keeps hitting against and god wants to take that out of you stony heart stony will a stubbornness something that's laying there and to return or a turn heart means that it's time to repent that just simply means you're going in a certain direction and you're turning romans chapter romans i i spoke on that on sunday morning about the goodness of god leads you to repentance so you have to be willing to take the hand of goodness and let him lead you away from that thing it's the goodness of god that leads you to repentance so you you don't want to kick against the pricks and keep hitting against the the thing or the someone or the conviction that's the holy spirit let me just step back and say something that's a good sign that you're a seed of god when god stays on your case stop getting frustrated and stop trying to shovel in a bunch of nonsense and fill it up with a bunch of things of the world when really you're hungry for more of god you're you're thirsting for reality you're thirsting for a new heart that's not a bad spirit that's the holy spirit trying to give you his heart hallelujah so it's speaking of human relationships and of spiritual relations that god wants to turn you back to god and turn you from evil he wants to turn our hearts to restore you and refresh you and repair you are you a work in progress well that's a good testimony that means you're a progress are you going through a trial i'm working with you a little bit i'm not brother aaron i'm brother john amen is that okay if you're going through a trial that's a good thing because you're going through brother mitch you're going through a trial so instead of saying i'm going to worry i'm going through a trial that god is carrying me through he's teaching us he's given me a new heart about that see we're born with a human nature it's like brother elijah's given me directions up to his house well brother john just go down to this red light and turn right and then go to the next red light and make a left why don't we say the green light why don't we brother elijah say just go to the green light and then go to the next green light we're so made negative go to the red light go well just you're not going to go unless it's green so go to the green light we're so negative you know well you gave me a glass of water brother brother michael gave me a glass of water and it was half empty why are you so negative why don't you say thank you brother michael for being half full is that right we're we're not careful we're just automatically and by the way it's it's more than half full i just made an illustration amen why do we lean toward the negative why are we so quick to because that's that other nature that's battling us even you that have received the new heart you just need to surrender to the holy spirit and let him lead you away from the things of the world and to be restored means to allow him to do this work in your life to turn means that you're not going to draw back always with his dealings i mean it's time to give back it's time to relinquish the hold of the enemy it's time to give a payment in full he's already done that sometimes we talk about satan or the devil and the tormentor but tonight to turn a heart that is turned means that there comes a power in you that is repulsing against the tormentor he's hindering the work of satan god is here in your life to stop the work of satan and to reject the devil do you like that it goes back to ezekiel though the opening scripture that says cast away from you all your transgressions and make you a new heart and a new spirit let's make way for god to move let's make way are you interested he comes to those that are interested if you're not interested then you're probably not going to get the benefit of it if your attitude's wrong then he's probably going to have to work on the attitude a little bit that's why he says i'm going to give you a new heart and a new spirit he's going to give you a spirit that would finally say lord i surrender brother michael let us in a song that brokenness brokenness is what i long for that's totally contrary to most humans in laodicea they say brokenness we're supposed to be strong we're supposed to have it all together they glorify you know the gold and the silver and the bronze well there's a lot of other people that that did a lot of good things it doesn't make them bad we can train our children that you got to be first you got to be number one that's not right we want you to be what god's called you to be the world is telling us well you can be anything that you want to be and the word is telling us i want you to be what i've called you to be and if that's with a weakness or if that's with a limitation or and there's certain things even in our natural realms we have limitations stop using that as a crutch just rise up with that new heart and say lord i want to be all that you have called me to be let me ask you tonight where is that generation that's going to be like that it's going to have that kind of a turn hard and where you are being restored and brought back to your right mind and back to your right senses i just say lord i'm available to you for you to give me a new heart about this if i've been thinking wrong then put your thoughts in me and i'll start thinking your thoughts i mean friends the world is trying to cram it down your throat every single day with their media and their news and their progression and all the flashy boards to they want you to draw you in buy this go here even on your highway signs vaccinations and this and that i thought we were going on a highway what's vaccinations have to do with going down this highway it shows how politics has even taken over the highway signs and i don't want to get into that you know we've all experienced that in the last you know 16 17 months of this virus and things and i don't want to get on that but you know satan has achieved in the last few months a great plan of his and that was to distract the believers away from the word of god and to get our minds on numbers and deaths and disease and you know what's it like in arizona what's it like in california what's it like in florida and we can start getting our minds on natural things i'm looking for my notes because i'd written something about that and it was like satan has devised a great plan for this hour and many have fallen to it they got caught up in it and you can see how easily they have become distracted you know sometimes i could ask you what state was you born in what state was you born in we could talk about a certain state that a person you might go to for vacation you know arizona in the summertime isn't a place where a lot of people come to for vacation that's how you know i really love you i came in august where i think next week it's going to be 90s 90s i looked on my and i did sunny sunny 98. i really loved you hey man i left washington state where it's in the 60s right now this week now last week or the week before it was actually hotter last thursday and friday it was 98 degrees when it was 96 here it's amazing the earth is groaning wildfires and viruses and earthquakes earthquakes in haiti earthquakes in alaska the earth is groaning countries are against countries africa afghanistan literally fell within hours what is it it shows how the people of this world are their hearts have been programmed for a tribulation they're literally being programmed for a tribulation they've become numb they've become talking the language you know wear a mask get vaccinated get not you know social distance they become so trained and sometimes they're so good on those things what about the things of god god's trying to get our minds in this generation on the things of god where is that generation though we acknowledge all these natural things and i'm not denying brother michael that we need to manage those natural things but it's the spiritual things god give us a new heart tonight and turn me to the things that are god of god but we could talk about different states and i could ask you what state did you move here from or what state do you live in washington state or alaska or arizona or where are you from but i'd like to talk about the state of healing what about the state of healing what about the state of happiness the state see that person's in an awful state they just seem to be clouded over they just seem to be tormented the devil has tormented them then i want to invite you to move to the state of happiness would you what about the state of peace people are nervous people are troubled they if i had a pill here tonight for free and you just come forward and take this and it's a it's a pill of peace you'll have perfect peace the world would just give everything for that that they'll line up for a vaccine they'll line up for a test i i'm having symptoms i need a test brother john for hours to line up for a test what about a state of peace here's a pill would you just take it what's wrong with the word of god what it says my peace i give unto you not as the world gives i to you but i i'm the prince of peace that's the lovely lord jesus how many can recognize that jesus is in this room right now the presence of god is in this room right now it's for believers it's for arizona believers church that if you would believe that you're part of a generation whose hearts would be turned then that makes you a candidate to have your heart turned take the pill tonight and move to a state of happiness state of peace and what about the state of rest the state where you can just rest come to the state of healing i'm inviting you to come join me in a state of healing state where everything's okay because god's in control why don't you leave your state of torment in your state of trouble come over and give god the broken pieces and let him bring you into a state we you know we visit places for holiday and vacation certain places certain countries even or provinces or islands we go to a beach somewhere or to some amusement place but we go there and then we come back we go there and then we come back but i'm asking you tonight where do you live where is the state that you live because that's really you that's where your heart is i'd like to visit you tonight and then invite you to come to the state where god can heal your heart and hallelujah where do you live tonight i believe this message has got to become practical and outworking in our lives you know are we doing okay after the seals in 1963 there was a big thing and you can even google it today they would say the number one killer of human beings is heart disease heart disease we're speaking on that tonight a new heart but not just naturally but the world will tell you that the number one killer is heart disease it was in the 60s and it is today if you want to google it brother branham said you've heard people say the number one killer is heart disease i differ with him not to be different i just differ because i know it's wrong the number one killer is sin disease right not all heart disease it's sin disease our number one heart disease he said the main thing that kills the people today it's number one sin disease it's unbelief it's the number one sin disease that kills the people today spiritually and that'll make them kill them physically now if i can get some of you to believe this tonight it'll really help you our many times our natural conditions are reflecting a spiritual condition and that's where people shake their head and say no it doesn't and all they give all kinds of excuses and want to blame their dad and blame their mom and blame a preacher no you are tonight what you want to be we might as well just be what god wants us to be and say i'm not going to blame it on my past lord let me rise up out of this give me a new heart about that and give me wings to fly out of my situation i believe there's enough power in this service somebody walk in a brother michael out from this uh highway or walk into this motel in here that is totally demon-possessed that jesus is here to deliver them do you all believe that then why sit we here with spiritual conditions week after week or week after week and let satan torment and trouble your minds you might as well just be set free you might not be a visitor but you might be so common with your situation that you're denying the power of god it's time to get plugged in to the power and say god flow through me holy spirit let there be a revival in me shake off my lethargy shake off my sin disease some of you might be dying of the number one killer of america is sin disease and you might come to a message church and you might even believe malachi 4 was william branham but if you don't believe that that scripture speaks of you and god turning your heart you'll sit right there in your sin in your dilemma in your situation we've already heard the answer tonight he's beautiful for situation i need to stay more behind the pulpit don't know i mean brother aaron's so good you just see just scrub right through and he just stands right here and and then brother john's going all over and brother ryan's getting his exercise over there he needs some exercise amen brother ryan hallelujah he's getting exercise today move that shoulder a little bit brother hallelujah the doctor just told him he needed surgery he's going to be out for weeks and weeks just today brother ryan i don't know if you know that he's going through a thing that could change the course of his career changed the course of his life but he's committed his life to the lord our life is not in our hands it's whatever the lord would want of your life so it's not all bad it's your heart it's how you're looking at it it's lord change me then it has not changed my spouse or changed this changed my chil it's changed me lord then in the book of acts the bible talked about they were so full of the holy ghost just their shadow was healing people y'all believe in the book of acts and i don't even know our brother very well but just my shadow walking by could heal him it also talks about they laid their hands on the sick and they recovered i don't need to scream and yell and right is that right brother god bless you i'm social distancing but i don't need to scream and yell i can just walk by him lay my hands on him he could be healed spirits that haunt god's people spirits that are troubling you say why not well let's let's be a church that believes in those things i mean you say well that's the first pool well let's have the first pool the second pool and the third pool brother brother would drop right back and know a person's name you sister there and you sister this afternoon at 2 32 you were thinking this certain thing you closed the door to the bathroom and your heart just sunk and you you were weeping god saw those tears and she would say that's exactly right this brother you in the back this situation your wife and the job the situation god knows all about that he sent me here as a messenger to tell you it's it's all going to be that would just be such a strength well why don't we just take the word and say i'm holding to the word god's going to turn my heart god's going to turn the situation and you say well it's stony or it's a bad heart then he's going to give you a new heart and you say but it's bad it's going in a negative way well why don't you believe the lord to do the impossible the creators in the room tonight let there be life let there be joy let there be peace that's what our teenagers need to hear i'll give you a little testimony and more on sunday if that's okay but tonight i'll just give a little testimony of a 16 year old young lady that was raised in the message and her father was actually a minister of the gospel but she coming up as a teenager coming up through her adolescent years she began to go through a time of depression this is her own personal words to to myself and my wife a few weeks ago we were preaching in their church some youth meetings and and now she's an older sister with children not older but middle-aged with children but she was speaking about being raised in the message as a 16-year-old young lady fighting for her life she said i wanted to die she started cutting herself she got so low and started cutting herself that spirit of suicide was on her demon spirit trying to take her heart take her future take her life but god miraculously done a work within her life and gave her that desperation and god delivered her and just a wonderful deliverance and she gave her heart to christ and was filled with the holy ghost she attended louisiana camp and some of you've heard this testimony but as she was attending louisiana camp there it's it's it's kind of warm in march and april when they have the camp and so here she was with you know hundreds of other young people and believers she wanted to worship god she wanted to express her appreciation of god's goodness but she had all of these scars she had all of these visible signs of that time of her life that she wasn't proud of even though she was raised in the message she had gone through that time of trouble she was just embarrassed to raise her hands because of the scars everyone's rejoicing everyone's entering in but she said lord i want to thank you i want to praise you i'm just going to worship the lord anyway and she just stood up and raised her hands to the lord and began to worship him and her testimony is that when she sat back down and looked at her arm all the scars were gone worship scars she was willing to give up in worship and give her life and the scars god took care of those scars now she's given a testimony this is years later and she has children of her own she was starving for life she was looking for answers and that demon spirit was trying to break her in her time of awkwardness but the lord broke him in her time of awkwardness and gave her a divine connection i just want to say praise god for that hope for that spirit for that life that can be breathed into our children into our families into our teenagers into your wives and to your husbands we need that tonight i encourage you to leave the state of brokenness and move to the state of his heart move away from a taskmaster that's given you scars and move to the state of god's heart so it's not just a new heart or a new spirit but it's his spirit that's where we've got to go to tonight i most of you've heard of justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost and brother branham talked about the scriptures in ezekiel about a new heart and a new spirit but he said that third part is my heart my spirit that's what he and my spirit that's what we need don't stop there just with part of returning you can say i come out of the world or i come out of that situation brother john and then live like we've got to go into god's inviting some of you tonight to go into the heart of god so the number one killer is not natural heart disease it's spiritual condition of unbelief of sin just watch this where he said the spiritual is manifested even in the natural he said because they already can prove i'm quoting after the seals the men that hold grudges people that hold grudges and women who fuss and stew and fight and argue they die it'll cause cancer fungus and everything else will set in and ulcers you say brother john i've got this ulcer i've got this fungus or i've got this situation in my life and and we can talk about cancer and all these things but really it's a spirit behind that brother branham is trying to give us some heart medicine tonight that if you hold grudges and you fuss and stew and fight that sounds like maybe the way some of your families used to be or maybe how you were raised or you see it out people argue fuss hold grudges and and they're just always fighting it that's not the holy spirit well that's just the way i am well you need to die to yourself that's not going to go on the rapture sister brother i don't care if you've been in the message 84 years i was in pentecost and i received the message and now i'm 20 21. well you're probably a little elderly have patience for the rest of us that's coming up you know but if if you get old and cranky and you bitter and against everything that's not the holy spirit you've lost your heart brother you you need a new heart and a heart of flesh to have patience and rest until the rest of us can show up somebody that has a real revelation isn't mean and nasty and condescending they're welcoming you they're saying come on in to the state i want you to be free too is that okay i'm inviting you tonight to leave your state of brokenness and come to the state of his heart where god can bless you god can fill you and maybe there are symptoms of a heart issue or symptoms of a heart condition and god's just trying to encourage you tonight that he's here to take that away from you and give you a new heart you know in victory day right here in sarah vista i was just with pastor robert figueroa on sunday night he came to the service in tucson and it's in sarah vista where he's pastoring and brother branham preached in victory day after the seals and he said there was a young lady last night in an interview she was a minister's daughter had signed some kind of a little love affair and she had lost her mind about it and she's gone a breakdown a very beautiful young woman about 23 years old brother branham wasn't always talking about rainbows and mysteries and thunders he was trying to bring the message down to a place where the people could rise up to this plate this coming up to the state and here's a young lady that was 23 years old she was a minister's daughter she had been caught in a love affair lost her mind about it she had a breakdown she was beautiful but if you go back into her life when she was 12 years old is anybody 12 years old here brother elijah any of your girls 12 or anybody over here 12 everybody's old everybody's getting older young or younger when she was 12 years old in chicago or another place elgin in chicago he said sitting in a meeting the holy spirit went out through the audience and called her who she was and said you've got a murmuring heart this is a little girl in the audience and said told her her name and said you've got a murmuring heart who's ever heard of that before a heart condition a murmuring heart the doctor says you can't live till you're 15 years old but thus saith the lord you're healed and she never never even felt heart trouble since can we say praise the lord now i think brother jonathan sanders brother saunders your daughter used to be 12 years old right used to be how old are you now wow pray that's a long time ago i was with your dad before you were born amen we were friends right brother saunders are we still friends i'm just making sure i mean what are you supposed to say no brother john i've got an odd against you [Laughter] my heart's not right well you're not right brother john you know i i heard that last wednesday y'all y'all believe in laughing amen and something was said and i heard that everyone just bust out and i'm glad that's a good quality arizona believer's church just keep that amen i i've been to someone and they can preach a whole message or go through a whole service and be so serious it's like i believe in being serious be still and know that i am god i believe that verse too you know but i don't believe he's always still and i don't believe i believe when there's some energy and the word comes it ought to bring some happiness and joy and take the medicine and if you take medicine take some medicine and you really got to receive what i'm telling you tonight it's so wonderful it's so great and the most activity is their eyes it's the most wonderful thing it's the most wonderful thing to serve the lord and it's like really really it's no wonder people don't want to serve the lord it's so boring they've made it so dry sometimes we need a good shout out sometimes we need a big rain we need a thunder cloud you know i think last year was pretty dry here right and this year you're breaking all the records well may you break the record hallelujah may you just break the record say last year was tough brother john but this year break the record i'm talking spiritually let this church just break out of yourselves and be free and be happy say we used to live in a certain state we were wounded but now we don't let that control us no more we've moved to another state or did you use u-haul or rider no brother the holy spirit did something for us i was sitting in my seat i was hearing a message i i was had my hands in the dishwater some somebody gave a testimony about a 16 year old young lady and i thought wow if she can feel that way maybe i that's the way i'm it's identifying a spirit that's even right in the message of suicide and depression you can be free of that you say well what about the scars well god will take care of those two and you might have them till the rapture but on the other side they'll be worship scars you can just say god allowed that to happen so that i can help someone else so here's a young lady brother elijah it'd be like you and one of your beautiful ladies there that's all been born since i was with you back in the 90s a 12 year old young lady would be like one of our beautiful sisters here you're hearing from the doctor she's only got three years to live i mean we'd be more serious i mean it'd be a prayer request it would be it's serious i mean that young lady we would want to love her more we'd give her attention she's probably not going to be with us but three years that's what the doctor said the doctor said she's got a murmuring heart she's only 12 years old and probably won't be 15 but in a holy ghost-filled meeting god called her out and said you are healed and for the rest of her life she never had a heart murmuring heart trouble but now she's 23 years old so you do the math a few years later through the teenage years and 20s she gets involved with a young man in a love affair and loses her mind and is having a breakdown and brother branham said last night she had a different type of heart trouble it was spiritual heart trouble so brother john's just going a little bit deeper tonight because we can ask how you're doing and how's your job and how's the horses and what kind of car you drive and that's all nice but really the heart of the matter is the main thing how are you doing in your heart and if you have a murmuring heart god's here to heal that tonight then as the time goes on you might have another spiritual heart trouble god's here to heal that too spiritual or natural god's our healer can the church say amen whatever disorder whatever illness condition ailment or state you are or form or the result of a situation i want to announce to you tonight there is help for you there is a bomb and a healing agent that can deal with your situation and help you in your time of need is there a bomb in phoenix b-a-l-m bomb is there a bomb in gilead is there a physician here let me ask this church i know i'm being personal my first service with you who's your physician well let me dig in my purse or dig in my wall let me see no it's the great physician jesus is my physician i believe in doctors i believe in nurses i believe in hospitals god is my healer and i'm looking to him how many knows jesus died of a broken heart i have it right in front of me in jeffersonville brother branham said he died of a broken heart he died of grief he died he says it two times paragraph 30 and paragraph 31 he died of a broken heart with such grief for the world to a chemical reaction taking place in his body a broken heart they rejected me they the people i came to love they turned me down my family the jews they turned me over to the romans they killed me he died of a broken heart is that possible brother brother just told us it was then is it possible if he's the bridegroom that the bride could suffer from a broken heart i'm asking you tonight it's actually a medical condition it's called broken heart syndrome it's a heart condition where a person goes through stressful situations emotional extreme emotional things that trigger serious illness and it needs surgery it's a literal medical condition called broken heart syndrome where it's a condition and it can cause sudden sharp chest pains and shortness of breath these symptoms they can be severe and stress of life where a person can literally be walking they can they call it walking dead where you are walking and your arteries are almost totally clogged up you're about to die whether jason watkins a pastor in south carolina was having this just a few weeks ago and the shortness of breath and he goes for walks and he went across the neighborhood he said i don't even know if i can get back home just shortness of breath and he went and got some check they couldn't find it they couldn't find what it was and he was in finally one time and he had one of those during that that visit and they were able to diagnose it and his main artery was 99 blocked he was literally walking he could have died in a moment you need immediate surgery you need like immediate and they went in through his arm it's amazing went up and put splints into his heart and he's strong and vibrant and able to pastor a church that's the grace of god if they can do that in the natural what about the spiritual where years ago and i got a picture on my ipad i don't think you want to look at it too long but it's called open heart surgery years ago they would have opened up your whole heart they would have cut your bones pulled back everything it would have taken weeks of recovery if science is that developed where they can go in do a heart check god put in a splint and oh you can breathe now you can walk now you can live what about the spiritual is god able to do that friend god is doing that tonight for you he's breathing he's breathing life into you breathing strength into you breathing open to you i'm checking my time it's time to go isn't it i know but brother aaron's probably watching me on the internet he's probably saying yep just cut it off and go to sunday i was sitting in the service the other week and i thought how long then does it take for open heart surgery because it's not a 20-minute thing you know we've been raised with chick-fil-a and starbucks and mcdonald's drive through get what you want chicken mcnugget what do you what would you like oh dad listen oh we got a vintay this that oh no oh they didn't make it right they didn't we want everything fast we want it right now we want it is that right we can get that way spiritually god's not a fast food drive through god many times years ago heart surgery would take i was wondering how long it would take for hope and heart surgery it's caused by cardiac complications and coronary arteries and bypasses and the diseases of the heart rheumatic do you know that the average time for a coronary artery bypass is three to six hours you're sitting in the waiting room you're got your cell phone out how's mom doing how's dad doing you know that's our piano player that's a deacon in our church well that's a minister that's a sister that i just texted a brother today that's gone through a lot of um trouble here in phoenix and difficulties i just i i understand that you've been through some hardships in your in the last time it's important that we express compassion hello we get into this how you doing all good when really it's not good we it's just being honest sometimes it's being open and it might not take 20 minutes it might not take 30 minutes it's a heart surgery it's more serious than just a few little stitches fell off the monkey bars or whatever a heart surgery has to do with a heart and it takes time to recover from a heart surgery back to work brother john i got to make a living well if you don't get this surgery you're not going to have a living and you've got children or you've got grandchildren or you got we need you in the church stop trying to clock out early we need you i mean friends we we should have a better attitude i don't want to live any longer than the lord wants me here but i don't want to live any less covet can't take me an accident can't a bomb dropping on phoenix can't take me unless god's done with you if god's done with you then we ought to be happy to leave do you understand it's a change of heart it's an attitude it's like lord my life is in your hands friends tonight we need before we leave this building we need to make everything right with the lord we not we might not make it home i might not make it up down the road to my motel room something could happen in our heart something could happen and we just need to make it right with the lord and know that one breath here i was just with sister karen pruitt a week before she passed away and then we went the next week with my wife to her service it can happen like that where you can literally be breathing in her case she was breathing on wednesday morning and by saturday they're laying her into the ground just a few days normally it might be one week you're breathing you're walking and within a week you're buried in the ground that's really life that's your heart how's your heart tonight we want it fast we want it quick we want a quick fix we want to take a pill and get out of here well sometimes god has to work with some layers and pull back the things and we need specialists and we need god to say things in a certain way brokenheartedness we've witnessed it a lot in the message from what people have seen and what they've gone through their heart gets broken they get crushed they don't have that get up and go well come on brother come on sister let's get it and they just don't have it they just they're broken they're crushed but the great physician is very near you're the generation whose hearts are going to be turned back he's going to do a change for you so before we close tonight someone might have been having the question is there any hope for me brother john i want to say there is hope for you is it all over for me my life no it's not over yet god has a plan for you this service has been pre-planned brother aaron going on a holiday vacation was pre-planned and he knew we'd be together for a few days let's make the most of it let's give testimonies let's encourage one another maybe monday i'll be gone back to my issues and matters and decisions you don't want my decisions but i don't want many of your lives and what you've had to go through i really admire you for your stand for christ but god can give us a new heart a new attitude a new way of looking at it brother branham walked up into sabine canyon with questions and he was and he had an experience of the sword coming down how many know that i was just there a few days ago in in that area but then he had to walk down off the mountain get in his car and drive back to his family we can't live on the mountain you've got to go back to your life and your life is every day rugged living for christ so lord give us a new heart give me a new spirit and even when i'm young god can take a murmuring heart when i'm middle aged and there's another more heart issues and things it's just like baggage it collects it collects it collects huh i'm sure you that are older know that it is you've seen a lot of things just but we need to just offload that in the presence of the lord all right maybe our musicians can come brother michael you can come and the micah hallelujah thank you jesus you might have thought all was lost but it's not all lost he's beautiful for your situation brother micah you can just play something tonight why don't we help one another pack up things wait were you talking about boxes and another address and who's gonna make the arrangements and change the utility i'm not talking about that i'm talking about why don't we help one another pack up and move to another state state of joy state of peace state of rest state of contentment you might not have a lot of money tonight brother john's not passing out twenty thousand dollar checks when you leave here but i'm giving you an opportunity to receive the heart of god you can be the poorest person in this room and have a lot of debt but you can be free in christ you might not have a lot of edge in education but if you know jesus that's the main thing some of you aren't married some of you want to be married some of you maybe had trouble in your marriage let's make sure we're married to christ [Music] let's get a heart of god again i know this is wednesday night and this is our first time to meet one another the doctor came in with his glasses and his coat and everything but it's not the doctor it's not his glasses and i didn't tell you about my wife or my three children or my three grandchildren it's jesus we really want to see it's the heart of god [Music] it's his spirit as we bow our heads tonight god heals by medicine god heals by love god heals by understanding god heals by care god heals by prayer god heals by miracles god heals he's the healer when the venom goes back to jeffersonville and speaks he cares do you care and he says we believe that doctors help people god heals by medicine god heals by surgery god heals by understanding god heals by love just a little love goes a long ways let somebody be all upset and just show them you care for them god heals by love god heals by prayer god heals by miracles god heals by his word god heals [Music] heavenly father this is part of this message of this hour through birth pains that you would bring a body that would heal the brokenhearted that you would anoint us as your children us that were poor us that were broken hearted us that were captive us that were blinded us that were bruised that you would set at liberty them that were bruised the recovering of sight to the blind the deliverance to the captives that would heal the brokenhearted that you'd preach the gospel to the poor not just poor and financially but poor in spirit blessed are you that are poor thank you jesus for healing us in our state that we were in give us strength lord to help box up the belongings of one another and take it out let's move to another state let's move to another condition let us be willing to say not my will but thine be done like brother michael let us earlier and brokenness is what i need faithfulness is what i need holiness is what i need maybe somebody would like to slip up your hand and say i have a need i have a certain condition i have a certain and i want to commit that to the lord again tonight i raised my hands earlier with the prayer request but i believe the lord is doing something of recovering of this trouble maybe it's spiritual maybe it's natural maybe it's financial maybe it's mentally but you'd like to say lord i'm through with being tormented by this spirit i'm turning to christ i'm turning to the word i'm checking into the secretary i'm coming into the private room and i'm saying be it unto me according to your word lord thank you for healing our land thank you for making us whole thank you for giving us a sound mind thank you for giving us sleep and rest tonight we can sleep well we can sleep with the grace of god and i'm moving to the state of rest i'm laying aside my cell phone i'm laying aside my tablet i'm laying aside my computer that i don't need to look at so much my cell phone all this dopamine maybe some need to take a fast you need to take a time away from the things you've been involved in and you're still a believer you're a christian but you've just maybe been unwise in your time and you're wasting time and you wonder why your spirit you wonder why your heart is troubled you wonder why your your emotions are all twisted up you wonder why your things are just it's just not right brother john friends there's nothing in this world that is just right for us it's the holy spirit it's his presence oh father let your presence bring a healing to each person each family that is part of arizona believers church any visitor or any person that will come later maybe sunday maybe they're streaming on the youtube or off the website in the future i pray the holy ghost would come into their room the angel of the lord would visit them and go through the wires come through the connection oh god and bring a healing to their heart because that's what matters lord we give you our lives if there's a need of a healing i pray that you would breathe into this congregation a healing if it's in their spirit realm if we have opened up the gates of our spirit and our mind and there's been a spirit that has come in forgive us lord forgive us jesus something's stolen our heart something stolen our interest something's taken our feeling away and we need than a heart of flesh we need a spirit that will just receive we're so troubled we're so nervous [Music] heal us lord god i pray for this congregation that that nervous spirit would be bound and cast out that every sister and every brother every young and every old person would sense a calmness like a peace float over their souls brother micah and my brother oh please lord i just pray the spirit of god god heals by music [Music] as david played the harp the spirits were cast out evil spirits but we don't even know what's happened in the last hour or two of our lives we just felt our burdens and felt our things troubles we just want to leave at your feet tonight i don't want to go out of those doors we don't want any of our families or our fellow brothers and sisters to be bound and by this any longer i pray that they would leave it right here at this altar they would make their own heart an altar [Music] you are our strength that's why i'm just feeling to wade upon you right now with this congregation they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they will run and not be weary they will walk and not faint give us strength lord give us strength in your presence to praise you worship scars worship scars where we're willing to say lord jesus worship you in spite of all of the things to thank you thank you for what you're doing thank you for what you're going to do thank you for what the word has said is possible thank you for the rain that's coming we thought it was just the size of a man's hand but oh it's an abundance of rain it's flooding the rivers it's flooding the roads it's oh god send a spiritual reign to this assembly let us learn to run in the rain again instead of just running to our cars and little children they love to run in the puddles and as parents we can't you walk around you're getting your clothes wet you're getting your shoes muddy and they just want to run and run in the puddles and run and sometimes as adults we just need to learn to run in the rain again and leap for joy and learn to cry and say oh god let our hearts lord jesus be squeezed in your presence i believe the lord's done a work tonight thank you jesus let's all stand to our feet and begin to thank the lord and just begin to worship him right there where you're at
