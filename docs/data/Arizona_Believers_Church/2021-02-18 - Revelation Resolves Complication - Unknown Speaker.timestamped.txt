[0:00] luke chapter 17 read verses 26 to 30
[0:04] and as it was in the days of noah so
[0:06] shall it be also in the days
[0:08] of the son of man they did eat they
[0:11] drank
[0:12] they married wives they were given in
[0:14] marriage until the day that noah entered
[0:16] into the ark
[0:17] and the flood came and destroyed them
[0:19] all likewise also as it was in the days
[0:21] of lot
[0:22] they did eat they drank they bought they
[0:25] sold they planted they builded
[0:26] but the same day that lot went out of
[0:28] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[0:31] heaven and
[0:32] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[0:34] in the day
[0:35] when the son of man is revealed
[0:39] and in reading this we're trying to pick
[0:41] up on some things that we're speaking on
[0:42] sunday morning but it's
[0:44] it's identifying very clearly that
[0:46] you're going to have days that are like
[0:48] the days of noah
[0:49] and days that are like the days of lot
[0:52] but this is the
[0:53] these are circumstances of the age when
[0:56] it says
[0:56] in the days of the son of man so there's
[0:59] something the son of man is going to be
[1:01] present or something where he's making
[1:02] himself known as it says even thus shall
[1:04] it be
[1:05] when the son of man is revealed but all
[1:07] these other circumstances are going to
[1:09] exist
[1:10] in that time when the son of man is
[1:12] making himself known in his day
[1:14] and it's a very remarkable uh
[1:17] way that christ pieces these things
[1:19] together and so my title this evening is
[1:21] revelation resolves
[1:23] complication and uh and and wanting to
[1:26] focus now on this revealing of the son
[1:28] of man
[1:29] so you can be seated and in doing that
[1:32] just maybe
[1:33] making reference to uh what we believe
[1:36] christ is doing and how he's making
[1:38] himself very real to us and i appreciate
[1:40] the song that
[1:41] sister rebecca sang and
[1:44] and i i wish i maybe could just have the
[1:46] words i think i could just preach
[1:48] from verse course verse chorus on just
[1:51] how
[1:51] directed those words were to how the
[1:53] holy spirit's been speaking to our
[1:55] hearts
[1:56] as a church and dealing with our hearts
[1:58] i thought it was just very beautiful
[1:59] so maybe even those words that were
[2:01] expressed from a daughter of god's heart
[2:02] can
[2:03] form a little bit of a foundation for
[2:04] the things that we want to speak on
[2:06] i don't want to spend a lot of time
[2:08] going back into some of the
[2:10] background of the other five services
[2:12] that we spoke on this subject
[2:14] but we can all agree that we're living
[2:15] in a very complicated world
[2:18] and we are trying to make sense of this
[2:19] complicated world with complicated minds
[2:22] and sometimes that's why it makes sense
[2:24] it's because it's a complicated world
[2:26] and our complicated minds kind of trick
[2:28] us into thinking oh
[2:29] it all makes sense this is i see it
[2:31] perfectly clear and then we come to find
[2:32] out
[2:33] we don't actually see it the right way
[2:36] but in revelations chapter 3 verse 17
[2:39] i want to begin there because this is
[2:41] describing the world that we live in
[2:43] we could call it the age that we live in
[2:45] the laodicean age
[2:46] it describes society as a whole it's
[2:49] describing the climate the political
[2:51] atmosphere
[2:52] the social atmosphere it's the climate
[2:54] that we live in
[2:56] and i it would i would be remiss not to
[2:58] point out that this
[2:59] very directly and specifically describes
[3:02] the spiritual climate and the attitude
[3:04] of nominal churches and those who just
[3:06] generally claim to believe in jesus
[3:08] christ so
[3:08] we know that it has its most perfect
[3:10] application to the spiritual world
[3:13] but it being descriptive of the
[3:15] spiritual world
[3:16] it's indicative of the world at large
[3:18] and what the world at large is going
[3:20] through in the environment that it's in
[3:22] and even through these last several
[3:24] months that we've been fellowshipping
[3:25] together and the lord has began this
[3:27] church
[3:28] there's been a lot of focus on the first
[3:30] few chapters of genesis
[3:31] and we're often coming back to these
[3:33] very verses in revelations chapter 3
[3:35] because it perfectly describes the
[3:37] worldly climate that we're living in
[3:40] and i believe that god wants us to fully
[3:41] understand the day and time that we're
[3:43] living in
[3:44] and so this is god's diagnosis and his
[3:47] description of the age that we live in
[3:49] because thou sayest
[3:50] or this is his um his disclosing
[3:54] what the age thinks about itself because
[3:55] thou sayest i am rich and increased with
[3:57] goods and have need of nothing
[4:00] and know us not that thou are wretched
[4:02] and miserable and poor and blind and
[4:04] naked
[4:05] now this is the preface to verse 18 but
[4:07] we so we can put it this way
[4:09] you say that you're rich and increase
[4:10] with goods and have need of nothing
[4:12] and you don't know that you're actually
[4:14] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[4:16] and what a pitiful situation to be in to
[4:19] think that you're well clothed and
[4:20] you're well
[4:21] uh um amended and you have all these
[4:23] things and you're rich and increased
[4:25] with goods but in reality you're
[4:26] actually destitute you're poor
[4:28] you're naked and you're blind and that's
[4:30] a very horrible situation to be in
[4:32] because even if there was something that
[4:35] could remedy
[4:35] your lacking you're not aware of it so
[4:37] you don't seek it
[4:39] so it's a very terrible situation to be
[4:40] in
[4:44] and brother branham described the burden
[4:46] of this age as a pressure of riches
[4:48] soft living and nervous tensions he said
[4:52] in a complex age that we seem unfitted
[4:54] to live in
[4:55] so there's a pressure of riches there's
[4:57] soft living and nervous tensions these
[4:59] things relate even to how they say i'm
[5:01] rich
[5:01] increase with goods and have need of
[5:03] nothing it's related to those
[5:05] pressure of riches the deceitfulness of
[5:07] riches soft living
[5:08] and nervous tensions we looked at luke
[5:11] chapter eight last wednesday night
[5:13] how that the the word of god is sewn
[5:15] into good ground
[5:17] but yet cares of this life riches and
[5:20] the pleasures of this life
[5:21] choke out the word so that it's not
[5:23] coming to its perfection
[5:25] and that should be a comfort to us that
[5:27] jesus uses this parable to show
[5:29] that there's nothing wrong with the word
[5:31] and there's actually nothing wrong with
[5:33] your elected ground
[5:34] in this perfect ground which your heart
[5:36] is there's just other things that are
[5:38] sewn
[5:38] in by by nature and even by nurture and
[5:41] the things we experience and the things
[5:43] that we say and that we do
[5:44] that become thorns and thistles and
[5:46] briars within our garden and within our
[5:49] hearts
[5:49] that compete with the word and there's
[5:51] nothing wrong with the word but there's
[5:53] cares
[5:53] there's riches and the pleasures of this
[5:55] life that compete against the
[5:58] the word of god and the things that
[6:00] nurture the word of god
[6:01] and so it's a comfort to us to realize
[6:04] that god has ordained us to be a
[6:05] fruitful bowel to bring forth perfect
[6:07] fruit
[6:07] and that the word of god are zeroing in
[6:09] on those things that choke out the
[6:11] expression of the word
[6:12] and and if that's true then we just say
[6:14] lord you're the husband and you're the
[6:16] you're the one that keeps this vineyard
[6:18] so we just yield ourselves to you to
[6:19] take these thorns these thistles
[6:21] anything that's competing
[6:22] with the true word of god and that grain
[6:24] that's inside of me by election
[6:26] lord i give you full permission every
[6:28] door come in
[6:29] and do your part i yield to that part
[6:32] that it might bring forth your word in
[6:34] perfection
[6:35] and so this is this is a description of
[6:38] society it's blindly groping
[6:41] it thinks it has a lot it thinks it's
[6:43] great it thinks it's doing wonderful and
[6:44] we amplified it quite a bit last time
[6:46] but they actually lack the knowledge of
[6:48] what is best
[6:49] they think they got it all figured out
[6:51] but they actually lack the knowledge of
[6:52] what is necessary
[6:54] for true happiness and there's a channel
[6:56] that we could go down where we could use
[6:58] a lot of
[7:00] societal studies and things that refer
[7:02] to academia
[7:03] how in general human nature is often
[7:06] dissatisfied with the things that it
[7:08] thinks will bring them the most
[7:09] happiness
[7:10] and you could take even statements and
[7:12] say i'm the happiest i've ever been i
[7:15] have no
[7:15] regrets in life and then say i'm the
[7:18] most miserable person
[7:19] and i find that life isn't worth living
[7:21] and try to guess you know match
[7:23] match who said it and you could have the
[7:25] person who is a paraplegic by virtue of
[7:28] an accident at the age of 26 versus a
[7:30] person who won a 50 million dollar
[7:32] lottery
[7:32] and you'd say well the lottery winner is
[7:33] the one that's happy and has no regrets
[7:35] and you find no he's the one that hates
[7:37] life and wish he wasn't living
[7:39] and it's the paraplegic that actually
[7:40] says you know what i'm happy i have no
[7:42] regrets
[7:43] and it kind of fools us as humans
[7:45] because we think that doesn't make any
[7:46] sense that's irrational
[7:48] and that is the status of of the minds
[7:50] of people
[7:51] in the climate that people are living in
[7:53] they they don't really know what brings
[7:55] true happiness
[7:56] humans are in unpredictable and
[7:58] irrational
[7:59] and we mentioned the statement by
[8:02] democrities and this sets a record for
[8:04] the number of times that he's been
[8:05] mentioned in a message church
[8:06] but he says the cause of sinning is
[8:08] ignorance of what is better
[8:10] and so the the reason why man sins and
[8:13] the reason why
[8:13] we even make mistakes is in the moment
[8:15] that we're doing what we're doing
[8:17] uh and we're doing something that's not
[8:18] displeasing to the lord we've let go
[8:20] and we're no longer conscious of what
[8:22] the better thing to do is
[8:24] we're not ruled by that we're not
[8:25] governed by that so there's a letting go
[8:27] of
[8:27] what is better and as we even were uh
[8:31] using the phrase on sunday morning
[8:33] simplicity by faith that's
[8:34] that's what it means to when we say go
[8:36] going back to the beginning it's finding
[8:38] simplicity
[8:39] by faith coming back to that source so
[8:41] that real thing that's going to be give
[8:43] true meaning and give
[8:44] a context to all of our actions and give
[8:47] us something to live
[8:48] live for so we're even focusing again on
[8:50] the simplicity by faith
[8:52] because the reason why mankind makes
[8:54] mistakes is they lack revelation
[8:56] they they lack real guidance from the
[8:59] lord they're not tethered to
[9:00] his leadership and submitted to it and
[9:03] brother branham wrote about the
[9:04] laodicean age he says it cries it has a
[9:06] great amplitude
[9:08] of all things but it keeps burning with
[9:10] desire like an unsatisfied fire
[9:12] and i'm wanting to come to a place that
[9:14] i was last wednesday and i had to skip
[9:16] it
[9:17] in uh and finish and kind of go into a
[9:19] different direction and i wanted to come
[9:21] back to some principles
[9:22] that we wanted to share that time so
[9:24] some of this is review but brother i'm
[9:26] saying that they
[9:27] brag that they have everything a great
[9:29] amplitude of all things things that
[9:31] ought to be bringing them happiness
[9:32] but yet possessing all things they're
[9:35] still desiring to uncover more
[9:38] even though they say we have everything
[9:39] we need they're and we don't need
[9:41] anything else their actions betrayed
[9:43] their
[9:43] how they really feel in the heart
[9:45] because they're constantly searching
[9:46] constantly trying to find more is that
[9:47] one man said
[9:48] man is a perpetually wanting animal he's
[9:51] always hungry it's always insatiable
[9:53] he's never satisfied
[9:55] as even solomon said the eye is never
[9:57] satisfied with seeing and the ears never
[9:59] satisfied with hearing we always want
[10:00] want want want want
[10:02] it's never enough and so this
[10:05] is all connected back to the fall of
[10:08] mankind in the fall as we made
[10:10] the remark on sunday it's still uh
[10:13] deeply rooted in in all of our
[10:15] wanderings
[10:16] the the what when mankind fell it's
[10:19] resonated within humanity it's been bred
[10:21] into humanity
[10:22] even by the disobedience of cain and and
[10:24] how the generations unfold all of our
[10:26] conclu uh
[10:27] confusions and our perplexities can all
[10:30] go back to the fall and even the
[10:31] disobedience of cain
[10:33] who knowing that god had a better way
[10:36] still resisted it
[10:37] because god just said if thou do as well
[10:39] will that not be accepted and he could
[10:40] have said well lord what is that right
[10:42] way
[10:43] what is the what is the better way what
[10:45] was it about my brother's sacrifice
[10:47] that was pleasing to you and god said he
[10:49] offered a sacrifice by faith he offered
[10:51] a sacrifice by revelation
[10:53] and it would not have been an offense to
[10:54] god to say god give me revelation
[10:57] lord give me faith and and even as the
[10:59] bible says if a man lacks wisdom let him
[11:01] ask
[11:02] and god is happy to give wisdom so
[11:04] there's certain things that god has
[11:06] uh available for us that we can use we
[11:09] just need to ask
[11:10] and the sin of cain was in knowing that
[11:12] there was a better way maybe not
[11:14] knowing what that way was but being
[11:16] apprised by the voice of god that there
[11:18] was a better way
[11:19] he didn't humble himself to seek it and
[11:21] say lord i want it what is that way
[11:23] that i can walk in it so we're looking
[11:25] at the end of the beginning and those
[11:27] things
[11:28] that's put this feeling in this
[11:30] backslidden condition into mankind that
[11:32] we're seeing come to perfection now
[11:35] and as we were reading before mankind
[11:38] has put himself in the position that
[11:40] he's in genesis chapter 6 says the man
[11:42] has done this
[11:43] to himself he's become the architect or
[11:46] the mastermind
[11:47] of his own confusion and his own chaos
[11:49] by not holding to
[11:51] and letting go of what is necessary
[11:54] because mankind is no longer retaining
[11:56] god in his knowledge because he's not
[11:57] conscious of the divine
[11:59] in letting go of that he's no longer
[12:01] connected to what is necessary
[12:03] and when man left the one thing that is
[12:05] necessary then man is only left
[12:08] he's left to everything else to
[12:09] influence him to guide him to push him
[12:11] to drive him
[12:12] and that'll never satisfy him and the
[12:15] one thing necessary we said it's faith
[12:17] in god believing in his word
[12:19] looking to the promise and knowing the
[12:21] promise of the time that you're living
[12:23] in in the days of noah it would have
[12:25] been believing god
[12:26] it would have been walking faithfully
[12:28] according to his word and believing that
[12:30] it was going to rain but there was an
[12:31] ark of safety
[12:32] in the days of moses it would have been
[12:34] uh having faith in god believing his
[12:36] word and then also
[12:37] knowing that despite your situation as a
[12:39] slave in egypt that god had promised to
[12:41] deliver and then recognizing
[12:43] god bringing his promised word to pass
[12:45] when the deliverers on the scene
[12:47] those would be the things that would
[12:48] have been necessary in those times of
[12:50] those believers
[12:52] we've referenced this statement a couple
[12:54] times and i want to read it to you
[12:55] tonight recognizing your day and its
[12:57] message
[12:59] and brother branham just prior to this
[13:00] he says mankind has the same senses he
[13:03] had 6
[13:04] 000 years ago and he says it this way
[13:06] six thousand years ago with the senses
[13:08] he had
[13:09] he contacted his earthly home and served
[13:11] god
[13:12] so man six thousand years ago is made up
[13:14] just the same way that mankind is today
[13:16] the average height may have changed in
[13:18] certain
[13:18] physical characteristics have changed
[13:20] certain things about our uh specific
[13:22] ways in our mind and and the things that
[13:24] were
[13:24] uh the nurture that's being sewn into us
[13:27] or the nature that's being sewn into us
[13:28] the nurture that develops
[13:30] uh that nature has definitely evolved
[13:33] over several thousand
[13:34] years but think of it just mankind its
[13:37] basic elements
[13:38] has always had five senses of the body
[13:40] five senses of the flesh and he says
[13:42] he had these senses and these abilities
[13:45] six thousand years ago
[13:47] and when he had it he contacted the
[13:49] earth and he made his way through the
[13:50] earth but he served god
[13:52] that's where you see the seed of seth
[13:53] the sons of adam the sons of god called
[13:55] upon god they sought god
[13:57] but then he says now in the past 75
[13:59] years
[14:00] that man has come from a horse and buggy
[14:03] to an
[14:03] astronaut and it is a very remarkable
[14:07] uh acceleration of inventions
[14:11] and economies and in industry says he's
[14:13] gone all the way from a horse and buggy
[14:14] to an astronaut he was at once
[14:16] at one time propelled by natural force
[14:19] uh with a will
[14:20] and horsepower but now they've been able
[14:22] to harness
[14:23] energy and propel a man in a rocket ship
[14:26] to the moon
[14:27] it may be hard for us to fathom just how
[14:29] separate and disparate those two powers
[14:32] are but brother brahms identified that
[14:34] in just a short
[14:35] period of time in less than a hundred
[14:37] years mankind
[14:39] has accelerated his advancement
[14:41] accelerated his inventions and
[14:43] accelerated his development
[14:44] and and even breaking the law of how
[14:47] technology will increase and
[14:48] and amplify and grow he says why
[14:52] he turned away from his faith in god and
[14:54] turned it over to his senses
[14:56] and his ability as a human being now
[14:59] this might seem like a compliment
[15:02] right that when as soon as man let go of
[15:04] his faith in god he's now able to
[15:05] accomplish
[15:06] great advancements in science and
[15:08] technology and inventions and
[15:09] travel from the earth to the to the moon
[15:12] and even make in a way that perhaps one
[15:14] day if we destroyed this planet maybe we
[15:16] could set up another colony on another
[15:17] and say
[15:18] this is man and his inventions and his
[15:20] devices is always
[15:21] seeking a way to rescue himself and and
[15:24] this is to the good of mankind but it's
[15:26] actually not
[15:27] a compliment he's saying the further you
[15:29] get away from god
[15:30] the more entrenched you get into your
[15:32] own thinking and it unlocks a lot of
[15:35] potential that mankind has
[15:37] even in genesis chapter 11 god even said
[15:39] man is one
[15:41] they're united in their thought and
[15:43] being united in their thought and in
[15:45] their language being united in purpose
[15:47] there's nothing they can't accomplish so
[15:50] god had to confound their language to
[15:51] break up their unity
[15:52] this speaks to really the innate power
[15:54] within man who can be united who can
[15:57] draw from his senses draw from his
[15:59] ingenuity draw from his intellect and
[16:01] his intelligence and do a lot of awesome
[16:03] powerful wonderful things in the name of
[16:05] science and knowledge but this is not a
[16:07] compliment to
[16:08] man they were only able to do this when
[16:10] they were no longer relying upon god
[16:13] and no longer relying upon god they had
[16:14] to rely upon themselves
[16:16] he says did you notice it he quit
[16:17] trusting god he trusts
[16:19] himself so man has been able to
[16:22] accomplish the things that he has
[16:24] because he's not trusting in god anymore
[16:26] and and if you ponder that and begin to
[16:28] try to think about it in a very deep way
[16:30] that when you're trusting god for
[16:31] something he can make provision
[16:34] and there's ways that he can accomplish
[16:36] things that brings you contentment
[16:38] and meets the needs that you have in
[16:39] your life but once you begin to leave
[16:41] that you have to devise your own ways to
[16:44] meet the necessities
[16:45] but then also quiet the emptiness you
[16:47] have so you have to seek luxuries
[16:50] and you'll find that even at the turn of
[16:53] the century
[16:54] there was languages being introduced at
[16:56] the turn of the 20th century at the end
[16:58] of the 1800s
[16:59] of conspicuous spending and things that
[17:02] mankind was buying things that really
[17:04] didn't relate to necessities
[17:06] but they wanted to have things that
[17:07] related to status
[17:09] that you could identify this person was
[17:11] a person of means and of wealth
[17:13] and this began to overcome all of
[17:15] society and it became an insatiable
[17:16] desire
[17:17] why because man left his contentment in
[17:19] christ
[17:21] he let go of his faith in god and
[17:23] trusting him and being satisfied in him
[17:25] he quit trusting god he trust in himself
[17:28] and so the way back
[17:29] to simplicity is by faith
[17:32] and brother man said faith is a
[17:33] revelation of the will of god
[17:37] faith is a revelation of the will of god
[17:39] if you have
[17:40] faith in other words you have a
[17:41] revelation that you're in the will of
[17:43] god
[17:43] that's going to bring a stability even
[17:46] when everything's going crazy and
[17:47] everything's upset
[17:48] nothing seems to be working out that's
[17:50] going to bring a stability that's going
[17:52] to bring
[17:52] a resolve and a connection and
[17:55] a and a connection to the divine such
[17:57] that you're not just
[17:59] uh worried about all the other things
[18:00] that are chaotic around you say god made
[18:02] me a promise he gave me
[18:03] he showed me his will i know him i'm in
[18:06] god's will and you can rest in that
[18:08] and you could be very focused to that
[18:11] now in luke chapter 17 verses 26 to 29
[18:17] let us since we already read it as our
[18:19] text and as you take a look at it
[18:21] there on the overhead we could see
[18:24] that there's going to be a day when the
[18:26] son of man is revealed
[18:29] and he's likening the characteristics of
[18:31] that time when he is revealed
[18:34] to the circumstances as it was in the
[18:36] days of noah
[18:37] and when christ identifies the attitude
[18:40] of the people and the actions of the
[18:42] people in the days of noah
[18:43] he does not say the imagination of man
[18:45] was only evil continually
[18:47] he does not say that man has corrupted
[18:49] himself he does not say that all
[18:50] man has all flesh they become flesh but
[18:52] he says they're eating drinking
[18:54] married wives and given into marriage
[18:56] and so it's describing
[18:58] mankind in terms that we can all relate
[19:00] to
[19:01] then when it refers to the days of lot
[19:03] wherein they did eat they drank they
[19:05] bought they sold they planted they
[19:06] builded
[19:07] but jesus is identifying routine
[19:10] ordinary
[19:11] normal activities that all of us do and
[19:13] these are the things that he uses in his
[19:16] language
[19:16] to raise up the days of sodom and
[19:19] gomorrah
[19:20] now prophet comes and he's very direct
[19:22] and he points out
[19:23] that the circumstances of the days of
[19:24] lot and the circumstances of the days of
[19:27] of noah carried with it other other
[19:30] characteristics and other manifestations
[19:32] that perfectly fit the time that we're
[19:34] living in now
[19:36] absolutely prophetically fit the time
[19:38] that we're living in now
[19:40] and there's something that jesus is
[19:42] identifying
[19:43] that brought about that evil that brings
[19:46] about that perversion
[19:47] and this way of life of this eating
[19:49] drinking marrying eating drinking buying
[19:51] selling planting buildings speaks of a
[19:53] consumption-based lifestyle
[19:56] to their only living to satisfy the
[19:58] flesh and that was the only way of life
[20:00] there wasn't even a
[20:01] pursuit of god in the things of god and
[20:04] as we mentioned on sunday the evil jesus
[20:07] doesn't mention the evil because it's
[20:09] it's in what would they lack their faith
[20:11] in god
[20:12] they clearly do not have faith in god
[20:14] this is what's not undergirding they're
[20:16] eating and they're drinking
[20:17] they're not turning things whenever and
[20:19] giving thanks whenever they eat
[20:21] they're not believing that the provision
[20:22] that they have is from the hand of the
[20:24] lord
[20:24] when they're married they're not seeking
[20:26] the will of god and what would be
[20:27] pleasing to him
[20:28] these the will of god faith all these
[20:30] things that should be at the very heart
[20:32] of a believer's attitude and action
[20:34] is missing in the people in the days of
[20:36] noah and in the days of life
[20:39] and he's speaking to faith because in
[20:41] luke chapter 18
[20:43] which is a continuation of this
[20:45] conversation that he's having with his
[20:46] disciples
[20:48] about and even as he's the pharisees are
[20:51] demanding of him certain things
[20:53] and then he speaks unto them a parable
[20:55] he gives the parable of the unjust judge
[20:58] and at the conclusion of that parable
[21:00] his his point is i tell you that as the
[21:02] unjust judge delivered this widow that
[21:05] was
[21:06] psycho dialing him or constantly texting
[21:09] him or whatever it is we want to
[21:10] use to describe this woman who is
[21:12] constantly wearing this unjust judge
[21:14] he says if the unjust judge would
[21:16] deliver this widow woman
[21:18] how much more will your heavenly father
[21:20] deliver the elect to cry unto him and
[21:22] want deliverance in the end time
[21:24] and he says i tell you that he will
[21:26] avenge them speedily
[21:27] he says nevertheless when the son of man
[21:29] cometh
[21:30] because the revealing of the son of man
[21:32] is the coming of the son of man
[21:34] he says shall he find faith on earth
[21:37] now i absolutely believe in all my heart
[21:40] it's a rhetorical question because he
[21:41] has found the faith he's the
[21:43] the he is the author of the faith he's
[21:45] the one that stirs up the faith he's the
[21:46] one that brings the faith it's his
[21:48] coming
[21:48] that actually instigates the faith but
[21:51] it's faith
[21:51] that was missing in the days of noah and
[21:54] the days of lord
[21:55] and it's the faith that we must have to
[21:57] begin to look to god's promises
[21:59] and in looking to those promises have
[22:01] the faith that the son of man is joined
[22:03] to
[22:04] to bring about the vengeance and the
[22:05] deliverance in this end time
[22:07] and even that even in that very vein and
[22:10] that very thought
[22:11] uh when you when you come to the word of
[22:13] god and you begin to feed on the message
[22:16] of the hour
[22:16] and i know it seems very strange in
[22:18] certain circles and certain ways that it
[22:20] can be described
[22:21] and it can be foreign in a lot of ways
[22:24] but you
[22:25] you believers know how just personal it
[22:26] is and how real it's been made known to
[22:28] you
[22:29] you had a faith in the word of god you
[22:31] begin to uh
[22:32] listen to the word of god you're feeding
[22:34] on the the preaching of the word and
[22:35] you're
[22:36] you're you're reading the books and
[22:37] you're listening to the messages
[22:39] and you're hearing about a faith and
[22:41] you're in you're believing in certain
[22:42] promises
[22:43] and you begin to even look forward to
[22:45] certain prophecies
[22:46] that are being expressed in scripture
[22:48] and through the word of god and what is
[22:50] it doing it's bringing about a faith
[22:52] and then things that you actually hoped
[22:54] and believed for you find as you stay in
[22:56] the word of god
[22:57] get quick and do and you realize it's
[22:59] not coming it's here
[23:01] some things that i was looking forward
[23:03] to things that i was longing for things
[23:04] that i was praying lord wouldn't it be
[23:06] wonderful these things be fulfilled and
[23:08] so the word of god
[23:09] it creates a faith and then as the word
[23:11] creates this faith it's that very faith
[23:13] that the son of man can come to and make
[23:15] himself known to
[23:17] it's very beautiful how this this word
[23:19] of god unfolds and
[23:20] and how important faith is so as these
[23:24] things this
[23:24] this uh way of life of just satisfying
[23:27] the flesh and
[23:28] and this consumption lifestyle just to
[23:30] have and to eat and to drink and to
[23:32] build and to plant and to sell and
[23:34] and all these different transactions it
[23:36] says even thus shall it be in the day
[23:38] when the son of man is revealed even
[23:41] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[23:43] of man
[23:43] is revealed this to me the way the way i
[23:46] want it to strike you
[23:47] is the way that i i believe that jesus
[23:50] means this to this is a way that jesus
[23:54] means for this to be taken into your
[23:55] hearts
[23:56] the revelation of the son of man is the
[23:58] answer to the condition of the age
[24:01] what was the answer to the unjust widow
[24:03] the ju excuse me the just widow crying
[24:05] to the unjust judge
[24:06] the unjust finally doing something to
[24:09] avenge her
[24:10] what's going to be the answer to the
[24:11] cries of the of the desperate believers
[24:14] hearts
[24:14] it's going to be the son of man coming
[24:16] to their defense and to their aid
[24:18] so jesus is saying that in the midst of
[24:21] days that are like the days of noah in
[24:23] the midst of days that are like the days
[24:24] of law
[24:25] our answer to those conditions and those
[24:28] circumstances
[24:29] will be the revelation of the son of man
[24:32] don't try to figure it out without it
[24:35] don't try to navigate it without it he's
[24:37] saying the revelation of the son of man
[24:39] is actually god's answer it's his
[24:41] response to the condition
[24:42] of the age and so christ revealing
[24:45] himself is
[24:46] man's rescue it's your rescue it's the
[24:48] believer's rescue
[24:49] from the chaos the confusion the rescue
[24:52] and deliverance from the complications
[24:55] because who is this one jesus says in
[24:57] john 14
[24:58] 6 i am the way the truth and the life
[25:02] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[25:05] i am the way
[25:06] the truth and the life this is who
[25:08] christ is he is the word
[25:10] he is the way and if you don't have a
[25:12] way you can't go
[25:14] so there's no going without christ he is
[25:17] the truth without truth there is no
[25:18] knowledge there is no knowing
[25:20] so through christ there is a going
[25:21] through christ there is a knowing
[25:23] and without life there is no living
[25:25] jesus christ is the way
[25:27] the truth the life he is your going he
[25:30] is your knowing
[25:31] he is your living he is your all in all
[25:34] even notice how that theme keeps coming
[25:36] up in the songs that are sung
[25:38] with different song leaders and
[25:39] different ones singing specials there's
[25:41] something about him being your all in
[25:42] all and giving yourself over completely
[25:44] to him
[25:46] i am the way the truth and the life
[25:49] brother branham says in the message
[25:50] broken cisterns he says for he is the
[25:52] only way
[25:53] to the truth to the life and to eternal
[25:56] joy and eternal peace
[25:57] he is the only one and the only way to
[26:00] that
[26:01] the inexhaustible fountain of life is
[26:03] jesus christ
[26:04] why and who is he the word the same
[26:07] the word the life the fountain the same
[26:10] yesterday today and forever
[26:12] and this is the part that really struck
[26:14] my heart the true believer
[26:16] it's his supreme joy his supreme life
[26:19] his supreme satisfaction is in christ
[26:23] anybody ever heard of the brand supreme
[26:27] if if you find a supreme sweatshirt at
[26:29] goodwill you buy it even if it's a fake
[26:31] i mean
[26:32] it could be worth a lot more than what
[26:33] you paid for it at goodwill it's amazing
[26:36] just how much value people have attached
[26:38] to this brand supreme and just how many
[26:40] knockoffs there are
[26:41] i don't own any supreme if i came across
[26:43] a really good deal i might one day
[26:45] if i could get a supreme tie who knows
[26:47] but
[26:48] this is the believer's supreme right
[26:49] here this has more value
[26:52] than any any hat any sweatshirt any
[26:54] shoes any belt anything that
[26:56] the supreme brand can come up with this
[26:58] is the trouble
[26:59] it's his supreme joy his supreme life
[27:01] and his supreme satisfaction
[27:03] is in christ
[27:07] and there's well let me say this
[27:11] if we're not careful we can get to a
[27:13] certain place as believers
[27:15] that if you're not talking about threes
[27:17] and sevens and and the bright age and
[27:20] seven seals and seven thunders in typing
[27:22] all those things out through numbers
[27:24] and if it's it's not always in that
[27:26] channel we we get in our minds well
[27:28] that's not really this is what i'm
[27:29] focused on this is what i want this is
[27:31] what i think is great
[27:32] but if all those things don't produce
[27:34] supreme joy supreme life and supreme
[27:36] satisfaction
[27:37] you don't know those things and let's
[27:40] not
[27:41] take these thoughts of peace and joy and
[27:43] comfort in the fruits of the spirit
[27:45] and say well that's the pentecost
[27:47] message and that's the baptist message
[27:48] and if i want that i can go down the
[27:50] street
[27:50] to the bible church the community church
[27:52] and get that kind of teaching
[27:53] listen everything that's in the word of
[27:56] god is yours
[27:57] and christ who is making himself known
[27:59] to you today does not just want to fill
[28:01] your head up with knowledge of types and
[28:03] fulfillments and histories
[28:05] he wants you to have supreme joy supreme
[28:07] life and supreme satisfaction
[28:10] and as coming through the word of god so
[28:12] let's not forsake
[28:13] these other parts because if we if we
[28:15] just kind of forsake well that's simple
[28:17] that's just baptist and that
[28:18] and you know that's just this or that or
[28:20] whatever however you would disparage it
[28:22] you're actually not realizing that all
[28:24] the deep things and all the great things
[28:25] and the wonderful things god has done
[28:27] in this hour is to produce all these
[28:30] other things
[28:32] and if it's not to produce it it rests
[28:34] upon that very foundation
[28:36] so that it can come to you and he says
[28:40] notice how this just continues to pull
[28:42] out come forth supreme joy supreme life
[28:44] supreme satisfaction is in christ
[28:46] no pumping no pulling no joining no
[28:49] bailing
[28:49] just believing in resting we should just
[28:53] make that a bumper sticker
[28:56] be really hard to understand what do
[28:57] they mean by this but no pumping no
[28:59] pulling no joining no bailing
[29:01] just believing and resting it just
[29:03] describes the struggle of life trying to
[29:05] pump things up trying to pull for this
[29:06] joining that bailing that there's all
[29:08] different ways that we try to find
[29:10] settledness and find peace and try to
[29:11] find our place in this world
[29:13] and get ahead or or get out while we can
[29:16] or get in before it
[29:17] it goes up too high all these different
[29:18] things we try to worry ourselves about
[29:20] but he says in christ you're just
[29:21] believing and resting
[29:23] you don't have to worry about the
[29:24] pumping pulling joining and bailing
[29:28] he says you're just believing and
[29:29] resting that is what he is
[29:32] to the believing to the believing he's
[29:36] rest
[29:37] it's not trying to work it up it's not
[29:39] trying to pull or join or bail
[29:41] to the believer he's rest what are we
[29:44] taught that the
[29:45] stimulation of revelation is what
[29:46] satisfaction
[29:48] to the believer revelation is the
[29:50] stimulation of joy it's the stimulation
[29:53] of satisfaction
[29:54] now if you can begin to recognize that
[29:56] there's a way that the flesh wants to be
[29:58] appeased and to be satisfied
[29:59] and sensitized but then there's a way
[30:01] that faith is satisfied
[30:03] and if you can begin to look in your
[30:05] life and realize the times in my life
[30:06] when faith was really
[30:08] resting and satisfied those were my
[30:10] greatest moments of joy
[30:12] in the times when my flesh was
[30:13] sensitized and thought it was being
[30:15] satisfied
[30:16] those are my greatest moments of
[30:17] disappointment you can begin to measure
[30:20] yourself to say lord i want to be sure
[30:22] that i have satisfied faith not just a
[30:24] satisfied flesh
[30:27] we could structure this church in such a
[30:29] way to where all of you get a really
[30:31] satisfied in your flesh when you attend
[30:33] church
[30:34] there's a way that you can do it you can
[30:36] make sure that it's a particular time
[30:38] don't say a man too loudly
[30:39] you can make sure that this the song
[30:41] service is done a certain way and
[30:42] there's ways that we could arrange the
[30:44] song service
[30:45] just by the study of human nature and
[30:46] all the things that they do to recommend
[30:48] how you can have dynamic church services
[30:50] and engage your audience and keep them
[30:52] coming back for more
[30:53] and you'll find that those things that
[30:55] just satisfy the flesh are not
[30:57] long-lasting
[30:58] those things always have to change
[30:59] there's always got to be a new a new
[31:01] look there's got to always be something
[31:02] that's refreshed and keep the people
[31:04] interested and keep them coming and
[31:05] always do certain cuts and different
[31:07] changes to keep the mind engaged
[31:09] but we do not come with the sitcom
[31:11] attitude
[31:13] we do not come with the the the
[31:15] attention span as we would as we sit
[31:16] before
[31:17] a full feature film or some kind of tv
[31:20] show we come knowing that it's faith
[31:22] that's being fed
[31:23] and if that takes place over an hour if
[31:25] that takes place over a longer duration
[31:27] we have this mindset where our body is
[31:29] being brought subject to this faith that
[31:31] says i need this this is beneficial
[31:34] and that church is not geared to the
[31:36] flesh church is geared to the faith
[31:38] that can overcome the flesh that if we
[31:40] just pump you up in the flesh then we
[31:42] always got to pump you up in the flesh
[31:43] and we'll always be bailing you out in
[31:44] the flesh always trying to figure out
[31:45] ways that we can pump and pull
[31:47] and join and bail but if faith can be
[31:49] fed then that's the very thing that
[31:51] spills out into your flesh and into your
[31:53] work
[31:53] your life as as believers and in
[31:55] whatever walk of life you have
[31:57] and that's what makes a difference
[32:00] jesus christ is a stimulation of
[32:02] satisfaction to the believer
[32:04] now i'm going to read some very familiar
[32:06] statements to you about revelation
[32:09] and i'm wanting you to think about them
[32:10] just a little bit differently
[32:12] than maybe you would before because when
[32:15] we say
[32:15] revelation we think revelation the
[32:18] seventh thunders
[32:19] we say revelation we think about the
[32:21] revelation of the seven seals
[32:23] and when we say revelation we are we can
[32:26] appropriately think about that
[32:28] and we can think about this revelation
[32:29] that is brought
[32:31] as it relates to very significant
[32:33] outstanding scriptures
[32:35] in the word of god but this
[32:38] this the mechanics of revelation and
[32:41] the very practical impact of the
[32:44] revelation of the seals
[32:45] the revelation of those seven thunders
[32:47] it speaks to something that is pervasive
[32:50] that when we catch a revelation of the
[32:53] word of god
[32:54] what changes is not just our knowledge
[32:57] but our life
[33:00] that's the very thing about revelation
[33:02] is it's something that just it shakes
[33:04] through it reverberates through your
[33:05] entire person
[33:06] you educate something that someone that
[33:08] they're not supposed to do something
[33:10] and that can be held to as a discipline
[33:13] for a certain period of time but you
[33:15] catch the revelation that's something
[33:16] that becomes permanent
[33:18] that's something that if you fail in
[33:19] that regard you have something to rescue
[33:21] you from it get you back on track look
[33:23] to the promise
[33:24] and get you out of it you i believe that
[33:26] by revelation you could take the mantra
[33:28] that once an addict always an addict
[33:30] by revelation you can break that i was
[33:33] an addict i'm not an addict anymore but
[33:35] now i live
[33:36] i live by a different life i live by a
[33:38] different instinct
[33:39] and that's why so i want you to think
[33:41] about revelation uh
[33:43] i don't want to i want you to i don't
[33:44] want you to change the way you think
[33:45] about it but i want you to just kind of
[33:47] capture in a greater a greater view and
[33:50] a more broad view of how revelation is
[33:51] applicable
[33:53] and in revelation of jesus christ which
[33:56] is the chap of chapter one of the church
[33:57] age book not when he preaches the church
[33:59] ages but when he writes
[34:00] the book the church age book the seven
[34:02] church ages he says the importance of
[34:04] revelation by the spirit to a true
[34:05] believer can never be overemphasized
[34:09] and and i just take it that way that
[34:10] means if you were to preach every second
[34:13] of every service for the next 40 years
[34:15] emphasizing the importance of true
[34:17] revelation by the spirit to a true
[34:19] believer
[34:20] you will not have overemphasized it and
[34:23] that that should give great
[34:25] await to the importance of revelation
[34:28] by the spirit to a true believer and it
[34:32] says
[34:32] revelation means more to you than
[34:34] perhaps you realize
[34:36] and this is where i kind of want it to
[34:37] broaden a little bit revelation means
[34:39] more to you than perhaps you realize
[34:41] now we understand maybe a lot of us
[34:43] understand just how important it is to
[34:45] have a revelation of the promise for
[34:47] your day and a revelation of certain
[34:48] scriptures that are being fulfilled and
[34:50] a revelation of the fulfillment of
[34:52] revelations 10 1-7 a revelation of first
[34:54] thessalonians 4 16
[34:56] a revelation of malachi 4 5 a revelation
[34:58] of luke 17 30
[35:00] but even that revelation may be more
[35:02] important than you realize
[35:04] and and that may it may mean more to you
[35:09] than you realize he says in the very
[35:12] next page of that of the church age book
[35:14] that we're reading from but when the
[35:15] church disbelieves satan and believes
[35:17] the spirit's
[35:18] revelation of the word the gates of hell
[35:21] cannot
[35:21] prevail against her now that definitely
[35:25] takes um the magnitude of revelation
[35:28] and exponentially increases its
[35:31] largeness
[35:32] that if i can get a revelation uh
[35:35] believe the spirit's revelation of the
[35:37] word
[35:38] and disbelieve satan's teaching or to
[35:40] satan's lie
[35:41] then the gates of hell are ineffective
[35:43] against me so we want to put ourselves
[35:46] in this position realizing that in the
[35:48] end
[35:48] as we live in the end at the end of
[35:50] satan's eden his tactics have never
[35:52] changed
[35:53] and so in the beginning as he tempted
[35:55] eve he that were those were the gates of
[35:57] hell coming against the woman
[35:59] to cause her faith to fall to open
[36:01] herself up to be
[36:02] uh for her uh her her knowledge to be
[36:05] defiled and therefore
[36:07] gaining access to her knowledge she then
[36:09] acted upon that knowledge
[36:11] we're going to be facing the same
[36:12] temptation in the end
[36:15] we're going to come and contact it again
[36:16] by every word we're going to be facing
[36:18] this temptation
[36:19] so the temptation in the beginning is
[36:21] the same temptation in the end
[36:22] and the anecdote the answer what's going
[36:25] to resolve that temptation
[36:27] is revelation as complicated as your
[36:31] challenges may be and as complicated as
[36:33] the situations you are
[36:34] in it may seem to you revelation is what
[36:37] can make sense of all of it
[36:39] and jesus says that revelation means
[36:41] brother brown says revelation means more
[36:43] to you than perhaps you realize
[36:44] and as jesus said that the gates of hell
[36:47] cannot prevail against the revelation of
[36:49] jesus christ
[36:50] i want you to understand even his sister
[36:52] rebecca i'm assuming you wrote that song
[36:54] did you write that song
[36:55] wonderful that that very thought of that
[36:57] of that song
[36:58] is in christ in the revelation of jesus
[37:01] christ perhaps it means more to you than
[37:03] you realize
[37:04] because the gates of hell in whatever
[37:06] weapon they try to form against you and
[37:07] whatever path it takes and whatever
[37:09] angle
[37:10] in whatever circumstance you're in you
[37:11] can believe that the revelation of jesus
[37:14] christ
[37:14] is greater than anything that's coming
[37:16] against you
[37:19] and and because it's a revelation of the
[37:20] word it's a revelation you say
[37:22] a physical need yes it's the revelation
[37:24] of the god who created the human body
[37:28] if it's if it's a financial decision
[37:30] it's a revelation of the god who's given
[37:31] the best teachings on finances
[37:34] in this book there's so many things that
[37:37] you could find that whatever the need
[37:38] is revelation means more to you than
[37:41] perhaps you realize
[37:42] because a revelation of this by the
[37:44] spirit of the word of god
[37:46] can make the gates of hell and all the
[37:48] tactics of the enemy ineffective against
[37:50] you brother branham wright said this is
[37:52] a couple pages later in chapter 1 of the
[37:54] church edge book it is the revelation of
[37:56] god that will give you authority over
[37:57] the devil
[37:59] in any circumstance revelation
[38:02] revelation is the only thing revelation
[38:05] is everything brother said everything is
[38:06] revelation
[38:07] you say everything is revelation yes
[38:09] everything is a revelation
[38:11] the new birth is a revelation the
[38:14] rapture is a revelation
[38:16] your way from the new birth to the
[38:17] rapture it's revelation it's all
[38:19] revelation it's all contained in this
[38:21] revealing of the word of god
[38:22] and you can see why they who would add
[38:24] or take from it would be cursed
[38:26] it would have to be so for who can add
[38:28] or take away from the perfect revelation
[38:29] of god and overcome the enemy it is that
[38:32] simple it is that
[38:35] simple the revelation of god will give
[38:38] you
[38:39] authority over the devil in every
[38:41] circumstance in every situation
[38:43] it will give you authority over your
[38:44] flesh
[38:46] gives you authority over the world you
[38:48] by revelation can have authority over
[38:50] sin the world the flesh and the devil
[38:53] don't sell yourself short revelation of
[38:55] the word of god gives you authority over
[38:57] those things he says
[38:58] it is that simple there is nothing of
[39:01] such prevailing power
[39:02] as the revelation of the word
[39:05] so the importance of it to you can never
[39:07] be overemphasized it means more to you
[39:09] than perhaps you realize
[39:10] because the revelation of god gives you
[39:12] authority over the devil if you believe
[39:14] the spirit's revelation of the word and
[39:15] deny satan's lie about the word
[39:17] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[39:19] you so he says there's nothing of such
[39:20] prevailing power as the revelation of
[39:23] the word
[39:24] so nothing has more prevailing power
[39:26] than a revelation
[39:28] of the word of god so this is
[39:31] this is i don't even know which way that
[39:34] i could express it
[39:35] uh to make the point but i was watching
[39:37] some kids open some pokemon cards the
[39:39] other day
[39:40] and they're saying this one's the best
[39:41] nothing can defeat this this is
[39:43] undefeatable
[39:44] well to use a pokemon card analogy this
[39:46] is there's nothing
[39:47] more powerful than the revelation of the
[39:50] word of god
[39:52] there's nothing that can defeat that
[39:54] there's nothing that can overcome that
[39:57] you you can't combine anything together
[39:58] there's nothing that can match you you
[40:00] say well that's powerful that's power oh
[40:01] that's really good that's great no this
[40:03] is good
[40:03] but this is something that cannot be
[40:05] defeated it can't even be matched
[40:09] there's no draw you can't play
[40:12] you can't play that hand this is i'm
[40:15] standing on
[40:16] the revelation of the word of god and
[40:18] satan said well it's a draw
[40:20] this isn't like tic-tac-toe where if you
[40:22] really know what you're doing no one
[40:23] ever wins
[40:25] right this is something that it's a move
[40:27] that satan can't match
[40:30] nothing of such prevailing power as the
[40:32] revelation of the word
[40:34] now i want to i'm going to take a step
[40:36] further in this
[40:38] and and i want to use just some summary
[40:41] language when we speak of revelation
[40:44] and in the in the if you just look at
[40:46] these few statements we've read from
[40:48] and the way that we're trying to
[40:49] emphasize it and how the revelation of
[40:52] the son of man is the answer to the
[40:53] chaotic world and this complicated age
[40:55] that we live in
[40:56] revelation then we achieve this
[40:58] simplicity by revelation
[41:00] and revelation is simplicity through
[41:02] divine discernment
[41:04] through knowledge wisdom and
[41:06] understanding
[41:07] so i want to use revelation this
[41:09] revelation of him that brings wisdom
[41:11] that brings knowledge that brings
[41:13] understanding that brings discernment
[41:15] because we need these things in our
[41:16] lives
[41:17] we need that we need discernment and
[41:19] knowledge wisdom and understanding we
[41:20] need these
[41:21] uh in our lives we need these to be a
[41:23] part of our nature and we need them
[41:25] growing
[41:26] we need them developing we want to have
[41:27] more wisdom
[41:29] we if if we come to the lord and we have
[41:31] discernment out of two
[41:33] on a scale of one one to ten then 20
[41:36] years later
[41:36] you don't want to still be at a two
[41:38] right
[41:39] if wisdom and knowledge are it could be
[41:41] scalable in that sense we want it to be
[41:43] increasing we want it to be growing we
[41:44] want to become sharper
[41:46] and more more wise and more understand
[41:48] and have more knowledge as it pertains
[41:50] to revelation
[41:50] and the things of god now the
[41:54] to to look at the age that we're living
[41:56] in very very quickly
[41:58] satan when he attacked eve he used a
[42:01] question and a lie
[42:02] and gave her knowledge contrary to truth
[42:06] and even if you could somehow frame what
[42:09] the devil
[42:09] said and say that it was factual if
[42:12] facts
[42:13] lead you to a conclusion that's contrary
[42:14] to the word then those facts aren't
[42:16] truth
[42:18] and we live in a post true society and
[42:20] this post-modernism
[42:22] takes facts and elevates them above
[42:24] truth and says that truth is subjective
[42:27] and that whatever your truth is is
[42:28] different than my truth whatever your
[42:29] truth is is different than your truth
[42:31] and we can all have our own subjective
[42:33] individual truths but yet facts are
[42:36] objective
[42:37] and that everyone has to agree to the
[42:38] facts because facts uh what is it the
[42:40] famous saying facts don't care about
[42:42] your feelings
[42:44] well okay but i know one thing's for
[42:46] sure
[42:47] truth truth is truth no matter what
[42:51] and fact can be used to draw a
[42:54] conclusion that's contrary to truth
[42:56] and we should never let facts be
[42:58] elevated above truth
[43:00] there can be it doesn't mean we have to
[43:02] deny facts if they could scientifically
[43:04] prove without any shadow of doubt
[43:05] without any
[43:06] change in their theory without even
[43:08] evolving and manipulating and
[43:10] reversing course could say no we've
[43:12] definitively concluded that the world
[43:14] is 6.3 billion years old and that was an
[43:16] established fact and everyone in the
[43:18] world could prove it and say it
[43:20] and it was immutable and it was
[43:22] agreeable that fact
[43:24] that the world is so many billions of
[43:26] years old cannot lead you to a
[43:28] conclusion that's contrary to truth
[43:31] or contrary to the word we would use the
[43:32] truth to place those facts in a way that
[43:35] makes sense
[43:36] well if that is true then how do we
[43:38] arrive at this conclusion
[43:40] that in the beginning god created the
[43:41] heavens and the earth how do we arrive
[43:43] at that then we have the word that tells
[43:44] us
[43:45] period
[43:48] could god create a rock right now that
[43:51] was 6 billion years old i'm not trying
[43:54] to sound like an apologist but i'm just
[43:55] saying my god is able to create out of
[43:57] nothing a rock
[43:58] that when scientifically tested aged 6
[44:01] billion years old
[44:03] why god that's why
[44:06] he just can with man this is impossible
[44:09] to take no substance and bring substance
[44:11] but the whole point is i'm not going to
[44:13] let scientific fact and the result of
[44:15] scientific inquiry
[44:17] in the scientific process and this
[44:18] rigorous rigor rigorous method of
[44:20] testing and hypothesizing and coming up
[44:22] with a theory
[44:23] and they very rarely ever get to fact
[44:25] but i'm not going to let hypotheses and
[44:27] theories and facts that seem to assail
[44:30] truth
[44:30] i'm not going to let them intimidate me
[44:32] and say i know what truth is
[44:34] and i will let god if possible resolve
[44:37] facts with the truth
[44:38] but i cannot let facts tear down the
[44:41] validity
[44:42] and the strength and the power of the
[44:43] revealed word of god
[44:47] and i know that that has very specific
[44:50] uh emphasis
[44:51] there uh because none of us we don't
[44:54] have the authority
[44:55] to just create revelation and say this
[44:57] is what i'm standing on
[44:58] to oppose truth as it pertains to the
[45:00] word of god and things that we know to
[45:02] be true
[45:03] because it's revelation by the spirit to
[45:05] the true believer
[45:07] not just inspirations by some spirit to
[45:10] a professed believer
[45:12] we're talking about true revelation
[45:13] where you're standing on solid ground
[45:15] and so the age that we're living in this
[45:17] post-truth society where
[45:18] truth is has lost its real meaning and
[45:21] its purpose
[45:22] we're living in what is called the
[45:23] information information age
[45:26] and i made quick reference to this last
[45:27] wednesday
[45:29] now it's also called the computer age or
[45:30] the digital age
[45:32] and this expresses this shift from
[45:34] industrialization to
[45:35] computerization and technology that's uh
[45:38] computing
[45:39] power and to data so we've shifted from
[45:41] a society that's dominated
[45:43] by industry and factories and plants to
[45:45] a an age which is characterized by
[45:47] computers
[45:49] and technology and the
[45:50] interconnectedness of networks
[45:52] and if you just looked at it
[45:53] historically there was a revolution that
[45:55] brought about the industrial age
[45:57] do you know what a revolution brought
[45:59] about the industrial age the industrial
[46:00] revolution
[46:01] and what was that when people left more
[46:03] of an agrarian farming type community
[46:05] and way of life and way of making a
[46:07] living in production
[46:08] and entered into more of an industrial
[46:10] production model
[46:11] and more of an industry-based uh uh
[46:14] economy
[46:15] and that brought about and then
[46:16] characterized the entire age
[46:18] and so it's a digital revolution that
[46:20] leads to the information age
[46:22] there's been a revolution there's been
[46:24] something turning something changing
[46:26] and these prior revolutions as we've
[46:28] already looked into the word of god and
[46:30] seen what the brother brethren had to
[46:31] say about
[46:32] they've resulted in these revolutions
[46:34] were revolt against god's word
[46:37] in order for a man to leave one age in
[46:39] one society one way of living
[46:41] and to go into the age of industry and
[46:43] have an industrial revolution
[46:45] and then bring about an industrial age
[46:46] it was a it was the side effect of him
[46:48] leaving his faith in god and giving
[46:50] himself over to his senses
[46:52] so these revolutions have actually in
[46:54] some way been connected to a revolt
[46:56] against god's word and a letting go of
[46:59] faith
[47:00] and so this data revolution that has
[47:03] overcome
[47:04] society and characterizes this laodicean
[47:06] age
[47:07] it's led us now as that we've had more
[47:09] information and more information and
[47:10] more connectedness
[47:11] we weren't merely satisfied anymore
[47:13] being connected and exchanging
[47:15] information
[47:16] this digital revolution which brought us
[47:17] to the information age has now led us to
[47:20] the age of experience
[47:22] it's an age where it's not just enough
[47:24] to have things that we're connected to
[47:25] and to share information
[47:27] and to read information now we want this
[47:29] connectedness to cause us to experience
[47:32] what we're what we're what we're reading
[47:34] what we're seeing
[47:36] and i feel like all of a sudden i've
[47:38] just i've stumbled into uh
[47:40] you know vintage book club where we're
[47:42] still stuck in the 50s you have no idea
[47:44] what i'm talking about
[47:47] and that could just be my poor way of
[47:50] expressing myself
[47:52] but let me let me slow down a little bit
[47:53] at the sake of going too
[47:55] too long tonight you take
[47:58] the information we've been getting we
[48:00] weren't satisfied with information
[48:02] now we want to experience that
[48:04] information
[48:06] so now it's just not enough to watch
[48:08] something
[48:09] it evolved to where now you want to have
[48:10] you want to have surround sound and it
[48:12] wasn't enough just to have surround
[48:13] sound now you want to be able to immerse
[48:15] yourself in it
[48:15] and now technology is becoming immersive
[48:18] now the data and the information that
[48:20] you have it needs to have a certain way
[48:21] of
[48:22] feedback and way of sensitizing the body
[48:24] because we've left
[48:25] just an age of gathering information and
[48:27] accumulating knowledge
[48:29] and we've entered into an age of
[48:30] experience so it's very important for us
[48:33] to realize that we're not
[48:34] passively sharing information anymore
[48:37] and that the sharing of information and
[48:38] the digestion of information
[48:40] is not going to end with just sharing it
[48:43] and not going to end with just reading
[48:44] it
[48:45] but we're now no longer sharing
[48:47] passively information
[48:48] but now we're actively showing our
[48:50] experiences
[48:52] it's not enough just to send a text
[48:53] message it's not enough just to
[48:54] communicate through
[48:55] direct messages now the apps that have
[48:58] the most uh the most effect
[49:00] upon the people and whether it be
[49:02] snapchat or tick tock and i haven't
[49:04] downloaded any of those apps but just
[49:05] what the way they're
[49:06] they're focused and the way they're
[49:08] centric is they open with the camera
[49:12] not with the text field why because
[49:15] we've moved from sharing information
[49:16] we've moved from wanting to exchange
[49:18] ideas and have information
[49:19] and we've allowed that information in
[49:21] this habit of sharing information and
[49:22] sharing things about ourselves
[49:24] it's gotten to the place where now it
[49:25] must be visual and it must be
[49:26] experienced
[49:27] i just don't want to text you and tell
[49:29] you that i'm that i'm doing something i
[49:31] want to show you by way of a video show
[49:33] you by way of pictures show you
[49:34] by some way of immersing yourself into
[49:36] what i'm doing and that's the way that
[49:38] information has now led to more of a
[49:40] desire to experience and to feel what
[49:43] other people
[49:44] are feeling and experiencing
[49:47] and so as i think i've read it somewhere
[49:49] where it says the age of telling is over
[49:51] it's now the age of showing if
[49:55] it was show and tell now it's showing
[49:57] and this was exactly satan's method in
[49:59] the beginning
[50:00] the way that he operated in the
[50:01] beginning is he gave eve knowledge and
[50:03] as soon as he gave her knowledge
[50:05] it wasn't enough to merely have that
[50:07] knowledge she had to act upon that
[50:09] knowledge and experience it
[50:11] and it's even the the flow of the way
[50:13] things have happened in the society
[50:14] going from an industrial
[50:15] society to a computerized society an
[50:18] information age a data age
[50:19] we've been flooded with information but
[50:21] we are not satisfied with knowing we
[50:23] want to experience
[50:25] that's why that's that's how marketing
[50:27] is set up that's how certain things get
[50:29] in our minds and get in our
[50:31] in our hearts if you never knew about
[50:33] something you wouldn't get the hankering
[50:35] for it
[50:37] right but what does society want to do
[50:39] it wants to expose you to it and give
[50:41] you enough information about it so
[50:43] something can begin to work in your
[50:44] conscious
[50:45] and it's not good enough to know about
[50:47] the movie and what the plot is and even
[50:48] how it resolves itself you want to
[50:50] immerse yourself in it you want to
[50:52] experience it you want to watch it you
[50:53] want to feel you want to become a part
[50:54] of it and it's not enough just to watch
[50:56] it anymore people want to dress up and
[50:57] act like it
[50:59] why because it becomes a way of life it
[51:01] becomes very very immersive
[51:03] and so in in in eden in god's eden satan
[51:06] created a lust for knowledge in the
[51:08] woman
[51:09] and then once that lust for knowledge
[51:11] came in her therefore there was a lust
[51:12] for experience
[51:15] and if you could if you could ponder
[51:17] that very very deeply and realize that
[51:19] satan's method of operation
[51:21] is to first make you knowledgeable about
[51:23] it or make you aware of it and then use
[51:25] knowledge to then entice you to
[51:26] experience it
[51:28] and use that as a template over any any
[51:31] temptation
[51:32] any experience that something's trying
[51:33] to draw me into
[51:36] into something
[51:42] i'm gonna i'm gonna
[51:46] i'm gonna skip again
[51:49] and so let me just try to find me find
[51:52] find me
[51:53] find a place here to to stop
[51:57] we're living in this but abandon called
[52:01] the eden god's economy of innocence
[52:05] now we're no longer living in an economy
[52:08] of innocence
[52:09] to use the very phrase economy it means
[52:10] there's some sort of commerce some sort
[52:12] of transacting
[52:14] and we're living in a layout to see an
[52:15] economy where there's the commerce of
[52:17] knowledge leading to experience leading
[52:19] to having leading to possessing
[52:21] leading to owning and enjoying and and
[52:25] and i am emphasizing this just with a
[52:28] force and a weight behind me
[52:30] it's the knowledge that there's
[52:32] something else
[52:33] that makes us unhappy with what we have
[52:36] right
[52:37] that if if we all owned uh motorola flip
[52:40] phones
[52:41] and that's all that we had then we would
[52:43] all be happy with
[52:44] our motorola flip phones and and the
[52:47] only way that we could distinguish
[52:49] ourselves and have some sort of
[52:50] competition
[52:51] is because i have a leather looking
[52:52] cover over my uh motorola flip phone
[52:55] and you go that's really nice brother
[52:56] aaron but that's genuine leather mine is
[52:58] actually full lambskin leather feel this
[53:01] feel how soft it is
[53:03] and like oh i got to get me one of those
[53:06] but as long as there's nothing else we
[53:07] just kind of are happy to stay within
[53:10] that paradigm but knowledge is what
[53:12] begins to roll that paradigm and cause
[53:14] you to lust for other things and become
[53:16] unhappy or discontent with what you have
[53:19] satan constantly bombards you and tries
[53:21] to use this method as he used with eve
[53:24] to get us to a place where we're no
[53:25] longer satisfied with christ satisfied
[53:27] with the word
[53:28] satisfied with waiting on him to unfold
[53:31] himself and bring us the things that are
[53:32] necessary
[53:33] or holding to the one thing is necessary
[53:35] and we get sucked into this com
[53:37] economy where there's these transactions
[53:39] of knowledge and now experience
[53:43] and worldly knowledge without wisdom
[53:46] wisdom of the word is destructive
[53:49] it's deceiving
[53:53] it was plato who said all kinds of
[53:55] knowledge
[53:56] if knowledge of the best is lacking
[53:59] hinder
[54:00] rather than help him who has them think
[54:03] about that for a second
[54:05] all kinds of knowledge hinder rather
[54:08] than help
[54:09] him who has them if he lacks the best
[54:12] knowledge everything we know in the
[54:16] world everything we're learning
[54:17] everything we're experiencing everything
[54:18] we keep
[54:19] up with even in your hobbies and your
[54:21] pursuits and your recreation
[54:22] there's a lot of things that are not
[54:25] unlawful in themselves
[54:26] but if you're somebody who loves
[54:28] technology and you love the latest and
[54:29] you love certain things
[54:30] you can get so wrapped up in that and
[54:32] have a lot of knowledge of it but if
[54:34] you've forgotten and letting go of the
[54:35] knowledge of that is best
[54:37] that knowledge hinders you rather than
[54:39] helps you
[54:40] if the knowledge of the best is lacking
[54:43] the good part that mary chose
[54:45] the the the one thing that is necessary
[54:47] if that lacks the knowledge of the best
[54:49] discernment of the word of god wisdom by
[54:51] the word of god
[54:52] understanding by the word of god if that
[54:54] lacks then all the knowledge that we
[54:55] accumulate in this world is to our
[54:57] detriment
[54:59] just as data without proper analytics is
[55:01] useless
[55:03] deceiving misleading without the ability
[55:06] to gain
[55:07] insight and find value and information
[55:09] all that information is worthless and
[55:11] human knowledge is merely just the
[55:13] accumulation of facts
[55:15] as humans we can gather fact in fact in
[55:17] fact in fact and learn to learn a lot
[55:19] about fact
[55:20] but only by god's wisdom can we make
[55:21] sense of it
[55:23] only by god's wisdom can you take a fact
[55:25] and be able to say well this fact is one
[55:27] thing and this fact is very interesting
[55:29] and that's very factual but only wisdom
[55:31] can take that fact and make it
[55:33] fit somewhere that's beneficial
[55:36] there's got to be a higher wisdom
[55:40] there's a lot of facts that we're
[55:41] bombarded with every day
[55:43] but we need god's wisdom to make sense
[55:46] of it
[55:49] real risk wisdom is the simplification
[55:53] of
[55:53] data and information and facts that's
[55:56] what wisdom can do
[55:59] and that's what we find sometimes within
[56:00] particular industries or people with
[56:02] particular skills
[56:03] you can be overwhelmed with a bunch of
[56:04] information and somebody who has wisdom
[56:06] and that can say
[56:07] wait a minute i know it looks a little
[56:09] overwhelming right now but watch this
[56:10] and be able to piece things together
[56:12] to make sense of the information that
[56:15] skill set that you could see in industry
[56:17] and you can see it with particular
[56:18] people in worldly pursuits or worldly
[56:20] disciplines
[56:20] that's the kind of wisdom that you can
[56:22] have as a believer to navigate you
[56:24] throughout this entire world
[56:30] i say amen to that that there's a wisdom
[56:33] that god can give you that will allow
[56:35] you to make sense of all the information
[56:37] that's bombarding you
[56:38] on a daily basis because all learning
[56:42] and knowing and accumulation of
[56:43] information is worthless
[56:45] without revelation all kinds of
[56:48] information will hinder us rather than
[56:49] help us
[56:50] if knowledge of the best is lacking
[56:55] i so if you i want to skip
[56:58] towards the end there in our slideshow
[57:00] and bring this to an end
[57:03] i'd mentioned it in my prayer recently
[57:06] and it was something i had been thinking
[57:07] about about a rubik's cube
[57:10] and they say that a rubik's cube if you
[57:13] could just find that slide brother john
[57:14] and
[57:15] um and just so that everyone knows what
[57:17] i'm talking about
[57:19] and you could just cycle right there we
[57:20] go does that look familiar to anybody
[57:22] but lucas did you bring yours tonight no
[57:25] the night that i had shared that in the
[57:27] in the prayer
[57:28] he was actually holding one later on uh
[57:31] and
[57:31] we shared some just he was testifying to
[57:34] some things and
[57:35] it was very inspirational but this
[57:38] rubik's cube how many knows what this is
[57:39] raise your hands if you know what this
[57:40] is it's a very old school
[57:42] toy the traditional three by three
[57:46] rubik's cube that you're looking at
[57:47] right here
[57:49] has over 43 quintillion possible
[57:52] arrangements
[57:54] that that's the number in that little
[57:56] thing that you can hold in the palm of
[57:57] your hand
[57:58] just a regular three by three rubik's
[58:00] cube or smart cube and
[58:02] there's other words that they have for
[58:04] it or magic cube
[58:07] it has over 43 quintillion that's the
[58:10] number of all the different possible
[58:13] arrangements that you could have
[58:14] from that device that you're holding in
[58:16] your hand this rubik's is the thing that
[58:18] you could turn around
[58:19] and and you could flip around there's
[58:21] that many different permutations or
[58:22] arrangements of the colors and the
[58:24] levels
[58:25] and all the different dimensions that
[58:26] are represented in that 40
[58:28] over 43 quintillion different
[58:31] arrangements
[58:32] but only one correct solution now think
[58:36] about that
[58:37] you can twist that thing around over 43
[58:40] i'm not talking billions
[58:41] trillions i'm talking about quintillions
[58:46] right i i didn't know how to
[58:48] conceptualize that we're not quite to a
[58:49] brazilian yet
[58:50] but we're getting close right
[58:54] a quintillion of different possible
[58:58] you're sitting there with the rubik's
[58:59] cube in your hand and you're flipping it
[59:00] around and you can get it to
[59:02] if you had enough time 43 quintillion
[59:04] different possible arrangements of all
[59:06] the colors
[59:07] on all the different surfaces the six
[59:08] sides of that cube
[59:10] but only one right answer
[59:14] and not to make this life seem like
[59:16] needle in the haystack
[59:19] but there's a lot of ways to death
[59:21] there's a lot of ways to chaos there's a
[59:23] lot of ways to confusion but there's
[59:24] only one way to life
[59:26] there's a lot of different ways to die
[59:28] but there's only one way to live
[59:30] and really in this life that i want to
[59:32] describe to you and somehow get it in
[59:34] your
[59:34] mind that you have in your life with
[59:36] life you have this rubik's cube
[59:38] in your hand and you look at it maybe
[59:41] some of the young people that are here
[59:42] or maybe some who can
[59:43] are getting a little bit of a wave of
[59:44] nostalgia the first time you ever had
[59:46] one and it was all perfect
[59:48] but then you get it all mixed up and
[59:51] something inside you said oh
[59:52] i know how to do this you got to get the
[59:53] blue here the green there the yellow i
[59:55] know how to do this
[59:56] and you get it all together and you get
[59:57] your blue and then like wait a minute
[59:59] well how do i get and then so you try to
[1:00:02] get the other one and everything's
[1:00:03] messed up again
[1:00:04] and you start looking and you you find
[1:00:06] in your mind thinking how do you ever
[1:00:07] get this thing right again
[1:00:09] i know it was at one time so logically
[1:00:12] there's got to be a way to get it back
[1:00:15] anybody ever do those puzzles those
[1:00:16] unlocking puzzles and sometimes they're
[1:00:18] just metal locks so they're different
[1:00:19] things and you try to figure them out
[1:00:20] and you're playing with it and you get
[1:00:22] it and finally you get it by accident
[1:00:24] you unlock it and then to really solve
[1:00:27] it you've got to get it back together
[1:00:29] and you spend much more time trying to
[1:00:31] figure out a way to get it back together
[1:00:32] and google's your friend right you got
[1:00:35] to look up a youtube video
[1:00:36] to figure out how to get it back
[1:00:38] together why because you're lacking the
[1:00:39] understanding of even how it worked
[1:00:42] and it seems impossible it seems
[1:00:43] complicated
[1:00:45] and they say that anyone who solves the
[1:00:47] puzzle quickly
[1:00:48] cannot do it by sheer intuition
[1:00:52] there's no way that you can solve this
[1:00:55] puzzle just by intuition
[1:00:57] but they do it with memorized sequences
[1:00:59] of moves called algorithms
[1:01:01] which they deploy to solve the cube
[1:01:03] section by section
[1:01:05] so if you're going to solve this you've
[1:01:07] got to know the algorithm
[1:01:09] and in order to solve it quickly you can
[1:01:10] sit there and play with it for hours
[1:01:12] upon hours and finally get it right
[1:01:14] and they say all right how did you do it
[1:01:15] how many moves did it take well i don't
[1:01:17] know
[1:01:17] thousands getting close to a quintillion
[1:01:20] moves
[1:01:21] you can't repeat it again but those who
[1:01:23] are able to do it very fast
[1:01:25] they don't just take a cube and just
[1:01:26] like my intuition can can fix it people
[1:01:28] do that do magic
[1:01:30] right it's a magic cube and there's you
[1:01:31] know if you want to buy the book on that
[1:01:33] you can find one
[1:01:34] we're talking about people can actually
[1:01:35] take a cube and then solve it very
[1:01:38] very quickly they know the algorithm to
[1:01:40] get to a solution with so many moves
[1:01:43] now just using this example and if i've
[1:01:45] completely lost you i'm sorry i'll bring
[1:01:47] it back to the word
[1:01:48] here as we close there was there's an
[1:01:51] approach to it
[1:01:53] it seems complicated and on one hand say
[1:01:56] well this should be easy all you got to
[1:01:58] do is get the colors to match but then
[1:01:59] as you begin to move things you're like
[1:02:00] well wait a minute this doesn't make
[1:02:01] sense why does this keep happening but
[1:02:03] once you understand how it works
[1:02:06] once you begin to recognize the
[1:02:07] algorithm to it the basis or the
[1:02:09] foundation
[1:02:10] then once you once that is established
[1:02:12] once you know it
[1:02:13] and as we're literally just talking
[1:02:15] about the hobby of
[1:02:17] solving a rubik's cube then you can know
[1:02:20] and use those algorithms
[1:02:22] in the situation that you're in now to
[1:02:24] make the step to the word of god
[1:02:26] we cannot think that we're going to make
[1:02:28] it through this world by
[1:02:29] simply having human intuition and be
[1:02:32] able to figure out how to get out of
[1:02:34] these different situations that we find
[1:02:35] ourselves in
[1:02:36] but we need something added to us some
[1:02:39] sort of basis some sort of foundation
[1:02:41] by divine revelation have a spiritual
[1:02:44] algorithm
[1:02:44] that can make sense of every single
[1:02:47] nonsensical thing
[1:02:48] that laodicea tries to throw at you how
[1:02:51] did you solve that it's by an
[1:02:52] algorithm it's by a spiritual knowledge
[1:02:55] by spiritual wisdom by spiritual
[1:02:56] understanding
[1:02:57] that's been added to me by revelation
[1:02:59] something that almost begins to become
[1:03:01] first
[1:03:02] nature in first instinct to where when
[1:03:04] you find yourself in that situation you
[1:03:05] say hold still
[1:03:06] steady hold steady family whole steady
[1:03:09] family and honey we've been here before
[1:03:11] this is what you need to do in this
[1:03:12] situation
[1:03:14] and not just give up and walk away from
[1:03:17] it frustrated
[1:03:18] but say god wouldn't bring me into this
[1:03:20] situation we wouldn't be faced with this
[1:03:22] task we wouldn't be having these
[1:03:23] challenges
[1:03:24] if god didn't have some way to make
[1:03:25] sense of all of it
[1:03:32] the brother bram says the church is
[1:03:34] built on revelation
[1:03:36] on the thus saith the lord
[1:03:41] that's what we're built on we're built
[1:03:43] on the thus
[1:03:45] saith the lord
[1:03:49] the very next page he says how did abel
[1:03:51] know what to do in order to offer a
[1:03:52] proper sacrifice to god
[1:03:54] by faith he received the revelation of
[1:03:56] the blood
[1:03:57] cain didn't get such a revelation even
[1:03:59] though he had a commandment
[1:04:00] so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice
[1:04:03] it was a revelation
[1:04:04] from god that made the difference and
[1:04:06] gave abel
[1:04:07] eternal life if we could think in terms
[1:04:11] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:13] and which is being born again by the
[1:04:15] power of god and by the spirit of god
[1:04:17] yes that's a revelation the new birth is
[1:04:19] a revelation
[1:04:20] of jesus christ personally to you that
[1:04:22] means revelation
[1:04:24] means more than we could express
[1:04:27] but in the same way to someone who has
[1:04:29] the holy spirit
[1:04:31] it's the revelation of god that
[1:04:32] continually makes the difference
[1:04:37] brother branham says in invisible union
[1:04:38] he said cain failed to keep that word
[1:04:42] he failed to have the revelation and the
[1:04:44] revelation
[1:04:45] is the only thing the revelation of the
[1:04:48] word
[1:04:50] i don't think you can qualify it except
[1:04:53] to say it's the only thing
[1:04:55] and since it's the only thing it is
[1:04:57] everything
[1:04:59] it's the one thing that in being the
[1:05:00] only thing is everything
[1:05:02] because it's it's for everything
[1:05:06] we and i i realized too that maybe it's
[1:05:08] just my
[1:05:09] my analytical mind or the way that it
[1:05:11] can work or immediately you start
[1:05:12] thinking well does that mean you have to
[1:05:13] have a revelation when you go to get a
[1:05:14] glass of milk tonight
[1:05:15] before you go to bed we're not getting
[1:05:17] on we're not being nonsensical with it
[1:05:21] i i i'm speaking to things that matter
[1:05:24] to all of us
[1:05:26] and something may matter to more to you
[1:05:27] than it matters to me and more to
[1:05:29] somebody else and it matters
[1:05:30] and we have all of us have these
[1:05:31] different levels of experience and
[1:05:33] challenges and things we're going to and
[1:05:35] we're trying to figure things out and we
[1:05:36] might even be looking at situations in
[1:05:38] our lives
[1:05:38] and despairing is it too late is this
[1:05:41] too far gone
[1:05:42] how are we going to figure this out how
[1:05:43] are we going to navigate it the
[1:05:44] pressures we feel the sense of loss
[1:05:46] that's pressing in upon us and it's
[1:05:48] making us afraid to act or maybe
[1:05:50] the fact we feel like we've let an
[1:05:51] opportunity pass us by and there's
[1:05:53] really no way to recover from it the
[1:05:54] loss of everything a bad decision
[1:05:56] whatever these things might be
[1:05:57] do you realize tonight that revelation
[1:06:00] is an answer to whatever it is you're
[1:06:02] going through
[1:06:04] and i'm not just kind of throwing it out
[1:06:05] there in the ether somewhere it's just
[1:06:06] something you got to kind of grasp at
[1:06:08] you can ask god to give you a revelation
[1:06:12] for the situation you're specifically in
[1:06:14] say lord i need something right now
[1:06:17] i really really need to know that i'm
[1:06:18] where you want me to be i really really
[1:06:20] need to know where you want me to go i
[1:06:22] really really don't need to know what to
[1:06:23] do with my children i need to know
[1:06:25] what to do with my finances i need to
[1:06:26] know what to do about where i'm going to
[1:06:28] church
[1:06:28] and get serious with god about these
[1:06:30] decisions and ask god to give you a
[1:06:32] revelation
[1:06:35] with the revelation the truth is the
[1:06:36] circumstance never even
[1:06:38] needs to change right
[1:06:41] i'm not telling you to stop believing
[1:06:43] for a change in circumstance
[1:06:45] but a revelation can change the way you
[1:06:46] conduct yourself towards it
[1:06:49] absolutely it can give you an absolute
[1:06:52] revelation of something
[1:06:53] you can stand solid on it and you can
[1:06:54] endure you can persevere you can undergo
[1:06:57] and you could find yourself in a
[1:06:58] situation where you have the right kind
[1:07:00] of attitude
[1:07:01] in whatever it is you're going through
[1:07:02] and how are you able to do that
[1:07:03] revelation
[1:07:05] you say there's no way i could go
[1:07:06] through this if god hadn't given me a
[1:07:08] revelation
[1:07:09] that he's going to get me through it you
[1:07:11] may
[1:07:12] be calling on god get me over it get me
[1:07:14] around it get me get
[1:07:15] take it away from me it says no i'm
[1:07:16] going to bring you through it and if you
[1:07:18] can have a revelation he's going to get
[1:07:19] you through it
[1:07:20] that's going to be the best thing that
[1:07:21] could happen to you
[1:07:23] you realize god why did i ever ask for
[1:07:25] him to take me around it
[1:07:27] do you realize that even in the way the
[1:07:29] methods that we come up with for
[1:07:31] deliverance and change and the way we
[1:07:32] want things to unfold
[1:07:34] is actually it lacks the wisdom and
[1:07:36] understanding of god
[1:07:37] because it can bring us to the threshold
[1:07:39] of something and we're asking god to
[1:07:40] take us around it but
[1:07:42] yet we've got to there's something we've
[1:07:43] got to experience in it
[1:07:46] and it's for our benefit but it can also
[1:07:48] be for to the detriment of satan
[1:07:52] just even we as we've been reading
[1:07:53] through the bible as a family
[1:07:55] and you come to the children of israel
[1:07:57] come to the red sea now it seems like
[1:07:59] there could have been a better way to
[1:08:00] cross it
[1:08:02] but god brought them to it and then
[1:08:05] opens it up you think oh he opened it up
[1:08:07] so that it would
[1:08:08] it would show his mighty hand but you
[1:08:10] know the real reason why god
[1:08:12] opened up those seas because he wanted
[1:08:15] to destroy
[1:08:16] pharaoh's army once and for all had he
[1:08:19] brought the children of israel some
[1:08:20] other way they would have been thinking
[1:08:21] what if the egyptians have the same way
[1:08:24] what if they figured it out just as
[1:08:26] their gods were able to
[1:08:28] uh turn the their rod into serpents just
[1:08:30] like aaron what if their magicians are
[1:08:32] able to come up with some other trick
[1:08:33] and at any moment we're going to hear
[1:08:35] the hooves
[1:08:36] of these horses and the chariots roaring
[1:08:37] in the in the wilderness coming after so
[1:08:39] god wanted to visibly before all of
[1:08:41] israel say
[1:08:42] i'm gonna let you cross on dry land and
[1:08:44] that's maybe one part
[1:08:46] a small part of my deliverance but what
[1:08:47] i really want you to see is the very
[1:08:49] thing i brought you through is the very
[1:08:50] thing that i'm using to destroy the
[1:08:52] power of the enemy
[1:08:54] over you and how else could you stand in
[1:08:57] a situation like that and believe
[1:08:58] that what i have gone through what god
[1:09:00] has done for me is not only for my
[1:09:02] benefit and for his glory but god will
[1:09:04] use it to bring about permanent change
[1:09:06] and to vanquish the power that the enemy
[1:09:08] had over me for so long
[1:09:13] brother mike if you could come this
[1:09:15] evening
[1:09:17] brother branham says this page 30 of the
[1:09:20] church age book if revelation is beyond
[1:09:22] you
[1:09:23] look up and seek god for it
[1:09:26] that is the only way you're ever going
[1:09:28] to get it revelation has to come from
[1:09:31] god
[1:09:32] it never comes by human natural
[1:09:33] endowments but by spiritual
[1:09:36] endowment revelation resolves
[1:09:39] complication
[1:09:41] but you're going to have to ask for it
[1:09:44] wisdom
[1:09:45] can resolve complication you're going to
[1:09:47] have to ask for it
[1:09:49] knowledge understanding discernment
[1:09:50] these are things that you have to ask
[1:09:51] for
[1:09:52] and if it's beyond you you realize how
[1:09:55] simple he made it
[1:09:56] this is how simple god makes it well i
[1:09:58] don't know what revelation is i don't
[1:09:59] know if i've ever had it where do i even
[1:10:00] start
[1:10:01] look up and ask god for it
[1:10:04] so he comes to this conclusion we've
[1:10:05] heard it before here at the bottom of
[1:10:07] the slide we need to call on god for
[1:10:08] revelation
[1:10:09] more than anything else in the world
[1:10:14] but do i i need to call upon god for
[1:10:16] healing i need to call upon god to be
[1:10:17] able to speak in tongues i need to call
[1:10:19] upon god that we can have a move of the
[1:10:20] holy spirit and people are slain in the
[1:10:22] spirit and people are dancing and people
[1:10:23] are jumping and people are shouting
[1:10:25] that's what we need to call upon god for
[1:10:26] those things are wonderful they're in
[1:10:28] the word of god and they feel really
[1:10:29] really nice
[1:10:30] but more than anything we need to call
[1:10:31] upon god for revelation
[1:10:34] more than anything we need to call upon
[1:10:36] god for revelation
[1:10:38] because it's revelation that's going to
[1:10:40] resolve it
[1:10:41] no matter what you're going through
[1:10:42] whatever you're experiencing well those
[1:10:44] are pretty
[1:10:46] uh pretty bold statements
[1:10:51] but they're the truth
[1:10:56] revelation
[1:10:59] revelation from the smallest
[1:11:03] most minute thing to the grandest into
[1:11:07] the biggest
[1:11:08] that's what we need whatever it is
[1:11:11] you're facing
[1:11:12] in this life that you're going through
[1:11:13] whatever age you're at i could even say
[1:11:15] for my own daughter where she's at in
[1:11:17] her life right now
[1:11:18] she can call upon god and ask him for
[1:11:20] revelation
[1:11:21] whatever the frustrations may be
[1:11:23] whatever the anxieties whatever the
[1:11:24] difficulties may be
[1:11:25] even in difficulties with siblings i
[1:11:27] could look at my my sons and i could say
[1:11:29] that they can call upon god and ask god
[1:11:31] for revelation say lord give me wisdom
[1:11:34] how to navigate these things i was
[1:11:37] wanting to go to revelation
[1:11:39] chapter 3 and how that god answers to
[1:11:42] the condition of the laodicea by giving
[1:11:44] counsel
[1:11:46] and brother branham when he comes to the
[1:11:48] point of having isab to see
[1:11:50] he refers to it as being a spiritual
[1:11:52] revelation of the word
[1:11:55] in doing so you're turning away from
[1:11:57] instincts of the flesh you're turning
[1:11:59] away from the wisdom of man you're
[1:12:00] turning away from all these other things
[1:12:01] you're turning away from thinking that
[1:12:03] just by sheer intuition you can do
[1:12:05] something with this rubik's cube
[1:12:06] but turn away from your own intuition
[1:12:08] lean not to your own
[1:12:09] understanding and then completely turn
[1:12:12] to the word of god
[1:12:13] as as being totally dependent and
[1:12:15] reliant
[1:12:17] constantly reveals a greater depth to
[1:12:19] which it can reach
[1:12:22] and our own personal lives when we feel
[1:12:24] as if we found
[1:12:27] that limit other
[1:12:30] that you begrudge any little one here
[1:12:32] tonight
[1:12:34] that you resent any open heart that is
[1:12:36] before you today
[1:12:38] and that if anyone here needs some
[1:12:40] something from you
[1:12:42] they can ask right now in faith
[1:12:45] believing
[1:12:47] and they can receive it even if it's a
[1:12:50] heart that was to say lord i believe
[1:12:51] help thou my unbelief
[1:12:54] you are a god that despite our unbelief
[1:12:58] is willing to help us in it because we
[1:13:01] believe you can
[1:13:03] i'm asking father on behalf of those
[1:13:04] that are gathered here tonight the many
[1:13:06] that stream
[1:13:08] those who may take time in the future to
[1:13:12] listen to this service
[1:13:16] on some archive lord may they take heart
[1:13:19] right now
[1:13:21] knowing that you're calling to them that
[1:13:23] something's speaking to them something's
[1:13:24] opening up an opportunity
[1:13:27] and may we right now all of us make this
[1:13:29] conscious decision to turn away from
[1:13:32] our human intuition our human
[1:13:34] understanding and our complicated mind
[1:13:36] and look to christ the word and say you
[1:13:39] are the dissolver of doubts you're the
[1:13:40] one that
[1:13:41] can make sense of all this and ask you
[1:13:43] for revelation
[1:13:46] to ask that by that revelation it could
[1:13:48] give us a gift of discernment for the
[1:13:49] situation that we're in
[1:13:50] that it can endure us with spiritual
[1:13:52] wisdom that we could possess an
[1:13:53] understanding that we could gain a
[1:13:55] scriptural knowledge that is fruitful
[1:13:57] that is beneficial
[1:13:58] for the circumstances that we find
[1:14:00] ourselves in
[1:14:01] lord i pray for your people tonight that
[1:14:03] you would bless them that you would
[1:14:04] anoint them that you would strengthen
[1:14:05] them that you would encourage them
[1:14:07] and that we would leave here feeling a
[1:14:10] greater appreciation for revelation
[1:14:14] that we can use it for everything
[1:14:18] we can take it with us wherever we go
[1:14:21] never let it go from our hands we commit
[1:14:24] all things to you tonight now
[1:14:26] bless us as we are dismissed in the name
[1:14:28] of the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:14:30] amen
