TRANSCRIPT
========================================
compliment everyone and make in the effort to be out to the house so Lord this evening I know midweek services are difficult to make especially with the schedules we have with work especially with how far away a lot of the families live and then just even the demands on our time at that midweek service is a difficult one so I just really compliment all of you who are here tonight and the ones that I look out upon you're consistently here and I just pray that you're finding a real benefit and blessing in your lives and in your families by making the effort to be here and may God bless you tremendously especially given the heat I have friends from all over the world sending me memes about the heat here in Arizona and so I'm frantically searching for memes to send back to them saving them for all the right moments and times but God bless you today for being here if it gets a little warm I trust the Lord the Lord above all can just give you a little bit of even physical comfort as we Minister the word this is part two on two Eden so we're coming to the second part on looking at two Edens and Sunday we spent a lot of time on this we're just going gonna pick up on it and the two Edens are God's Eden we looked at that as the original that God in the beginning created by the spoken word and then Satan's Eden that emerges even within God's Eden Satan is sowing the seeds and speaking the lies that will form his kingdom and brother Branham calls these two Edens perfect types and when he says that it's very remarkable because we might look at the beginning of the creation or when God begins to create and brings forth an Eden and a garden and all creation we think that is perfection of perfection but yet God was just given a type of it though it was perfect and it was very good it was a type and then Satan's Eden emerges and itself also is a type and brother Branham in that those statements that we read says that the Bible tells us that God's word produced in Eden but then it also warns us that a false Eden would come and he's using brother man points to Matthew chapter 24 verse 24 for there shall arise false Christ in false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and brother Branham and the way that he represent or speaks of these two Edens and talks about God's Eden and Satan's Eden and and refers to these two Edens that type so much he uses the scripture to point out that this is the false Eden that the Bible warns us of this is that these are the tares the representation of those Kingdom of tares that come into the world that were sown by the wicked one and it's remarkable that he says that and he says in different places how Satan has achieved it and what it produces is something so close to the original and that's what Satan does he's a deformer he's a mimicker he's an impersonator and that's why so often as you read the Bible and you hear different stories and different allegories that emerge in different historical circumstances and things that one man would do and what one man would believe in different ways that God would move you're always going to be be able to find something in ancient history that is a mimic of it that is an impersonation of it even things that they might say go before the historical record in the Bible That's because Satan from the beginning was trying to track God and trying to impersonate God even himself trying to stay one step ahead of God and so it emerges in the end as a twin to God's Revival and we know that in Genesis chapter 1 verses 3 to 31 that God brings forth his Eden over six days and and those days in the Bible those division of time that 24-hour period but then the Bible teaches us that uh be not ignorant of this one thing as Peter says that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day so it wasn't just six 24-hour periods that we might say but to God as he unfolded and created it took him six thousand years to bring forth his Eden his type his foreshadowing his first uh creation took six thousand years and just as it took God six thousand years to build his Eden Satan has taken six thousand years to build his brother Branham says in power of transformation six thousand years God took to make this and we see in Genesis 1 yet now we see that in this God had an objective that he wanted to bring to pass and we use that just to kind of lay back down again that when God created the heavens and the Earth he was had an ultimate an objective and ultimate purpose that Adam and the woman in type represented the threefold purpose of Christ or God manifested in Adam and the woman so it wasn't fully uh it wasn't the fullness of perfection but he was laying those seeds out there and so the original Eden we could say held all the all the types of God's Eternal Eden that would come it's like a preview or seed form of it and then Satan's kingdom as we're calling it Satan's Eden as brother Branham identifies it as Satan's Eden it's the kingdom that Lucifer intended from the beginning when iniquity was found in them this is what he intended to build and through the services on worldly Kingdoms in a lot of ways in these Services on Two Edens we're looking at how that Satan wanted to establish a kingdom and it's important because I believe it's those kingdoms that are going to be destroyed going to be annihilated going to be eradicated and there's one Kingdom that's going to remain that's the kingdom of God brother Branham says in Satan's Eden he says it's been and now is Satan establishing his kingdom in the earth that's exactly why he's doing it for he wants to establish his own kingdom and as we were reading from Revelations chapter 3 on Sunday I can't remember from the afternoon or not but in the morning service as we maybe came in just a past noon we're reading from Revelations chapter 3 verses 16 to 18 in the description of laodicea and how that God doesn't have one positive thing to say about it and the devil's bride is blind and naked and miserable and shameful and this is this is Satan's kingdom coming to its climax this is Satan perfecting his Eden it's him accomplishing really his own image what he wanted to achieve or if I could say this the only thing he could achieve is a perversion of God's original so laodicea in the description of laodicea is perfect opposite to God's image and Satan even trying to draw from certain things he he could only produce something that's a deformity uh that is the opposite of what God was going to achieve and so that's what Satan's Eden is it's a the antithesis it's the Antichrist it's the opposite of God's Eden because it is the seated discrepancy which is not just different but a contradiction and so if as we go further in this I wanted to stick with the title of two Edens but what I want to kind of focus on tonight is the two religions that come out of Eden and and I'll read from the church age book at the very end how brother Branham says that there are only two religions in the world True Religion and false religion and and that might seem remarkable in light of all the many different religions there are and even some religions that deny there is a God but it's important to note that even those religions are all part of the false religious system and that though some may worship Christ and some may worship the god that wrote the Bible and others may deny the god that wrote the Bible and believe in other gods and gods of the universe or even deny God uh their deny even eating deity those are all part of Satan's kingdom and they all worship the same thing they worship knowledge and Science and things that are false and so we as we look at the scripture and I think we'll just skip a little bit tonight some things but we know that both Abel and Cain offered Worship in Genesis chapter four they're both bringing offerings at one is accepted by God one is rejected by God God corrects the false worship and says your brother did well if you'll also do the same and and worship even in the manner which he did even supposing that he doesn't need the Revelation but if you'll just do what Abel did you'll also be accepted and so Abel with by Revelation by true Revelation he offers or sacrifices the firstborn from among the flock doing the same thing that God did in the garden by taking a life and and giving instructions to Adam and the woman to dress themselves and that those bleeding lambskins Abel offers the right way Cain doesn't we find that Cain in offering the wrong sacrifice that's the beginning of false worship brother random calls him twins he says they're they're Brothers in the same church they say they sat on the same Pew the different languages that he uses to describe it but one is worshiping falsely one is worth worshiping in truth in Genesis Chapter 4 verses 25 and 26 I want to take some time just to look at Adam's seed as the True Religion and the true worship of God as we'll contrast it with the seed of Cain it says and Adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name Seth for God said she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew and to saith to him also there was born a son and he called his name Enos then began men to call upon the name of the Lord if we could look at verse 25 and see that she Bears a son and she said for God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel it was her seed through Adam that she's identifying and her seed through Adam Abel was killed so she's saying that God has appointed me another seed another seed instead of Abel because Cain was different from Abel and she's she's using a language and she's saying something distinguish Abel from Cain God hath appointed me another seed because Cain is not the same seed as Adam was or as Abel was and so she does not say he has given me more seed given me another seed because she didn't have the seed anymore from Adam she had Cain who's of that Wicked one and she had a son by Adam who was killed by Cain so now she says I have that replacement I have another seed Seth who is different from Cain Seth being in this line and having a son Enoch so after Adam has had a son Seth and then he has a son Enos the Bible says that they then begin men to call upon the name of the Lord some render it to be and they called themselves by the name of the Lord oh it was they were identifying themselves with God they're identifying themselves with this one that might have seemed very mysterious to them but yet even by oral tradition Adam could have said that God created the heavens and the Earth and we walked with him and though my channels may be getting cloudy and fog I know that he made a promise to us and I could tell you what it was like Beyond those flaming cherubims I could tell you that there's a place right here on Earth where the presence of God would come down and we sinned in the beginning and God thrust us out but he gave us a promise that a son would come and he would share these things with his progeny his children after them and the Bible says that they called themselves the sons of God and they began the the sons of Adam as we contrast this with cane seed they're not running from the presence of God they're seeking it they're worshiping God they're calling upon the name of the lord they're connected to the promise they know that there's something Divine Beyond themselves they know there's something Supernatural so after the fall we could begin to see between cane seed and the seed of Seth that while on Earth despite the fall that you could either seek God's presence or disregard it you could either seek it or run away from it and disregard it and this is what they were doing the sons of Adam or the sons of God sought God together now men begin to call upon the name of the Lord and seek him together and in Genesis chapter 5 we'll see in verse 1 it says this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him raises up it reminds us that Adam's nature in the beginning came from God and that as he was made in the image of God there's an image of God in Adam even though this holy image would have left him and some Glory was lost to him he's still in his natural makeup had been made direct from God a spoken word Son of God created then the body formed from the earth and brought forth and so the Bible is telling us that he's made in the likeness of God so that we recognize that Adam's nature that he had from God is passing down to his sons passing down to the seed after them in verse 3 it says and Adam lived 130 years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name Seth as Adam was made in the image and likeness of God now the image of the Holy image of God remains in him it remains in Adam and now he has a son that comes forth in his own likeness and his own image Seth would then be in the nature I have the nature of Adam and the woman distinct from I know this is even review of the last few weeks distinct from the nature of the woman and the serpent it would have been maybe to use a phrase that might seem maybe a little bit misunderstood but a pure blood of Adam the woman in Adam's son together uh carried through and he would have had this he would have had the genes of Adam and the woman Seth in that image even as the children would come down he would bring forth children from his full sister to our theirs these are the seeds the sons of God the children of Adam and reading in Genesis chapter 5 we'll find we could find Seth's lineage as we keep reading and they're all humble people as you look at the meaning of their names their names are ones that glorify God there's no instances of murder or polygamy that are recorded of them there's no lying there's no deception as we get to the seventh generation of verse 24 it says Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him I want to just draw from that very carefully even though we could drill down in each one of those verses there's something about the nature of Adam that's passed down to his children where they worshiped God they called themselves the Son of God they identified themselves as being uh passing down from this Holy One this even this mysterious one and the Mystery of God was precious to the sons of Seth it was precious to the those that descended from Adam and they they loved God and worshiped God and they were humble men and they were simple in their in their dwellings and simple and how they pursued life and yet as they are coming forth and being worshipers of God the mystery of God that was so revered by the sons of Adam is opposed by the sons of Cain you could compare the the generations of Adam the Seventh Generation from Adam being Enoch who walked with God how remarkable is that he walks with God and so pleases God that before God translates him because of how pleasing his desire for the things of God was and then you look at the Seventh Generation from The Serpent and you have a lameck who's a polygamist the first one recorded and he's a murderer confesses to his two wives I've murdered a man look at those distinct differences from in Genesis 5 the lineage of Adam and in the lineage of Cain very very different lineages and in Cain in Genesis Chapter 4 verses 16 and 17 it says and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch this is the beginning of Satan building maybe I'd want to say it this way the beginning of Satan building his natural Kingdom something you could look at and see you could touch it it's tangible and so he's building his kingdom on Earth the beginning of the natural Babylon these are the very seeds that's we're going to focus on tonight just very very briefly because I know you can only fan for so long before your wrists are going to be tired but there's this is a natural Babylon that's emerging and when we see a natural Babylon remember there's a spiritual one behind it just as Cain in the beginning offers up this worship that same Spirit of false religion Works in a spiritual way and he's building a spiritual Babylon even though historically we can look back and see natural Babylon that emerges on Earth As Natural kingdoms with natural rulers and in Genesis chapter 6 verses 1 and 2 now we're skipping quite a bit Genesis 5 was the lineage uh we see the lineage of Adam Genesis 4 is the worship of Abel and Cain and the uh Cain building a city and the appointed seat of Seth and then the lineage in chapter five and then the Bible comes to this description of humanity and it came to pass when men begin to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose in this taken of these women there's there's an unrighteousness that is projected in that and the Bible is telling us that the sons of God through Adam's lineage these are the ones that begin to call upon the name of the Lord and call themselves the sons of God these sons of God through Adam begin to mix with the daughters of men and these Daughters of men they were they were not uh they were not from Seth lineage but there are some mixture some hydrating some cross relationships that were taking place as we could say the daughters of men are those Daughters of Cain and as there's Marrying an intermarian these men who called themselves the sons of God through the process of time they begin to mix with the daughters of men and in Genesis chapter 6 it tells us hey the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they began to marry and Genesis 6 shows us just how quickly all of Humanity's degraded once they start intermarrying the effects of this the effects of that uh hybrid blood the effects of having that serpent nature sewn into them and the access that Satan could have to their imaginations in the influence that demonic Powers could begin to have upon the person and so the the sons of Adam begin to marry the daughters of Cain and it begins to corrupt wholesale corrupt human nature and the human race I know these are very uh um I think very profound teachings that are controversial to teach the original sin in the way that we believe it to teach the resulting effects of that in the way that we believe in a very controversial and so they're stigmatized and they're often attacked but as we read our Bibles it's right in our Bible it's right there in the Bible telling us this is what happened and eventually there comes a point and I know I'm just using some real summary language and I just haven't felt to get into this in great detail scripturally but there comes a point when only hybrid blood is left that there's there's not um the sons of God are calling upon the name of the Lord and sons of God worshiping God and living simply and Walking with God and in his presence there comes a point where all blood is marred all Humanity finds himself in this debased weakened condition and in Genesis chapter 6 verse 3 it says and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years there's my spirit is not always going to be connected with man that his time is being limited it's being weakened his his days upon Earth are are getting smaller and smaller and my not my spirit they're not even be sensitive to my spirit anymore they're not going to regard me in their Consciousness anymore and and they're becoming completely Earthbound and debased it continues in verse four and there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became Mighty Men which are of old men of renown this is where you have the heroes upon the earth and the men of renown and reputation and trying to make a reputation for themselves this doesn't happen until the sons of God begin to marry the daughters of men and God saw this is how quickly when I'm mentioned a minute ago this is what I'm drawing from the Bible tells the sons of God begin to marry Daughters of men and just as soon as it tells you in verse 6 it tells us verse 5 it tells us the condition and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually how different is this from Enoch the seventh from Adam how different this is from Seth and Enos and these ones that came came from this lineage of Adam to where they regarded God they thought of God they worshiped God they were sensitive to the things of God they called themselves sons of God that's what the Bible tells us they called themselves now the sons of God to the process of time and whether it be that what they felt was a natural need and the need to marry her enticed by these beautiful women they find themselves intermarrying and marrying these Daughters of men as they do the wickedness of man becomes great upon the Earth where he says every imagination of the thoughts of his heart were only evil continually and God says and it repented the Lord that he'd made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart a condition of humanity what a condition of what we would call the human race is they've been mixed and mingled down and distilled down to where they're more Earthbound than they are heaven-bound and looking down to Natural things than they are looking up to God and seeking his presence yet in the midst of all this degrading of humanity the mongrelizing of the blood and the mixture of the seed Lion of Cain with the seed line from Seth the Bible says in Genesis 6 9 these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God does God not say about Noah that in you only have I found righteousness and you and you alone and if you look at the the story of Noah he marries much later in life than his uh people before him as you look at the number of years it would take before a man would marry Noah Waits longer and longer and longer in life to marry and some speculate that he did because he couldn't find a suitable wife he couldn't find a daughter of Adam he couldn't find a woman to marry that could pass on the the the lineage of the sons of God but Noah remains upon Earth as a just meant perfect in all his ways and perfect before God and it's Genesis 71 he says Noah you alone for thee have I seen righteousness before me in this generation in Noah alone could you imagine what that looks like then Noah is the last son of Adam upon Earth and all humanity is intermarian and regarding not God and the imagination of his conscience is only evil continue and there's one man who's righteous in the middle of all that so God tells Noah in verse 13 The End of All Flesh has come unto me I was looking at that the end of All Flesh and he says my spirit shall not always strive with men for that he also is flesh and I was thinking about the flesh is we could use it to discuss or just to describe maybe the physical part and no doubt that without that manifestation we really wouldn't have much to articulate about or even look at and God uses the phrase flash first when he's going to separate out from Adam the woman and he says that I'm going to bring forth and they shall be one flesh this is what they're going to be it's used of Adam and the woman as one flesh and now he's saying this is the way that I was thinking about it today of how he says the end of All Flesh has come before me and it certainly projects that he's saying I'm going to destroy them all except for you Noah but in another sense that which he created in the beginning has come to its end there's no way for Noah to bring forth another son of Adam there's no way to bring forth another one that would be righteous he said this flash that existed in the beginning this and I don't like necessarily using the phrase pure blood but these genes from Adam are now ultimately going to be mixed and mingled with the daughters of men or the seed of Cain and so now the end of All Flesh has come before me he says I'm going to destroy them with the Earth we know that Noah and his sons are the ones that survived and if there's any kind of you're trying to figure this out of well who's related to who and figure out all these genealogies if there was a if we considered that there was a class of people that were between Cain and his half-sister and that that was a class of people that would have begun to form upon the face of the Earth and then this line begins to mix with Seth's line that's the line that begins to mix and that you see survive the ark is the mixed line and any any uh seed of Cain that would have been between you know him and his half-sister they're eradicated in the flood because only one man his wife and his three sons and their wives passed through the ark brother Batman the sermon serpent seat said how did the seed ever get over the seed come over in the ark just like it did in the beginning through the woman their wives They Carried the seed of Satan through the ark just as Eve packed the seed of Satan to give birth to Cain through the woman so this it is passed down through the wives it's through who they married and so Noah who's righteous it's through his sons that the whole earth is then repopulated and that is the hybrid blood from one blood are we all over spread over this whole earth and these these sons of Noah now are are of the of the mixed Humanity that proceeds out of Genesis chapter four and in Genesis chapter 10 we're making just wonderful time tonight in Genesis chapter 10 says now these are the generations of the sons of Noah Shem ham and japheth these are the sons of Noah these are the generations of Noah sham ham and japheth Genesis Genesis chapter 10 is going to give us the generations as you would read from each one of these of sham ham and japheth and unto them were Sons born After the flood so now after the flood and I guess just since I've been studying on these things for quite some time now in a lot of Mythology and a lot of other so-called religions they have their flood myth or their flood narrative and a flood that happened upon all the Earth and so if you're if you have a tendency to reject something just because there's something else from Antiquity that would oppose it well if you'd have to reject the Bible's truth about the flood based upon ancient text because there's other religions that have a flood story in their belief system and in their faith and so Noah has three sons sham ham and japheth the Bible says they are all born to they have children generations of them that are born After the flood look at verse 8 with me in Genesis chapter 10. looking specifically at cush says and Kush begat nimrod I'm going to back up physically and metaphorically for a second there if you could there's just a very small brief thought that I'm sharing with you tonight and I want us to be able to look at all in one picture so we could kind of carry it Forward it'd just be easy to go back to and I'm sure I'll get accused of saying a lot tonight and that that was a bunch and there was that was a lot and that was a lot there's a lot of scripture and I get it I'm getting better at learning how to say simple things in simple ways the the image that I'm wanting to put before you is this out of Eden there is a true religion that there that forms enable worshipings Abel is murdered by Cain this false worshiper God appoints another seed instead of Abel because it's not more seed because Cain is not the seed of the woman through Adam and then Seth's children begin to call upon the name of the Lord they begin to worship and the progeny after that are walking with God but in the process of time this false worship begins to take over the daughters of men marry with the sons of God and these Bloodlines begin to mix to where it culminates in God destroying the earth except for Noah his sons and their wives and these are the ones that live that survived the flood and God has essentially starting all over in Genesis chapter 9 he's given a covenant to Noah to to multiply and replenish the Earth and there's a covenant made with those that would inhabit the Earth and now they're starting over under a different Covenant and from then from Noah's family alone is the whole earth going to be overspread there's not going to be Cain and through his half-sister race and there's going to be Adam and his sons in their race they're not now really going to all be One race the human race and Genesis chapter 10 is going to uh I'm wanting just to look at this in the way to see that how this false religion just takes hold so quickly and in the generations of Noah it says and Kush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the Earth he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said even as Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom notice how quickly it comes to this the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Eric and akkad and kalna in the land of shinar you may read that and say he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord the Septuagint and other translations render it he was a mighty Hunter against the Lord the phrase there is not that he walked before the Lord and was perfect and that he was before the Lord in a worshipful way or that he was before the Lord in an honorable way but this is a man who is against the Lord the language suggests that he was arrogant against God he was haughty against God I'm a man of renown I'm a powerful man this this nature that was to rise up against us and how it would have been taking over the Earth with weakened humanity and as man begins to multiply in the Earth the Beast of the field are multiplying against him and uh the animal kingdom is rising up in this Mighty way Nimrod is like wow look I can tame the Beast I can hunt down these animals and these ones that are so voracious against us and horrible I I I'm able to conquer them and it says that he was a mighty Hunter against the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom it's the first mention of kingdom in the Bible this is a man whose kingdom was from the beginning against the Lord his kingdom is Babel and the ambition of nimrod as you remember the scriptures we used through the last several scriptures the ambition of nimrod is right in harmony with Satan's ambition it's against God his plan and his objective opposes God it's an anti-god he wanted to be a Lucifer wanted to be like God he wanted to overthrow the kingdoms of God now Nimrod comes against the Lord and it should be no surprise to us that the first Kingdom that emerges After the flood and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel that's the beginning of his kingdom and these cities are all built along the river Euphrates and Babel is the ancient word for Babylon and it means mixed means to mix oneself it means to mingle and then the other the other word it says the beginning of his kingdom is Babel and a wreck which means to grow uh to prolong or to continue and so now Satan he is the architect he is the designer and the inspiration of this Kingdom his and this one Nimrod who's against the Lord he now begins to embody the nature of Satan the nature that was uh used of the serpent now he's coming to this building a kingdom and it's the beginning of Satan's kingdom now post flood is Babble to mix to mix oneself to mingle and it says that it is in the land of shinar which is the ancient name for Babylon or chaldea the the place of between two rivers trying to identify that spot there was four rivers there in the beginning now those rivers that may have been eradicated in the flood they only identified two rivers that remain he's one to find that Source of Life he's wanting to be right there in the place where God built his garden so he's going to begin to build a kingdom on earth that is mimicking in pattern the kingdom that was in the Garden of Eden and the kingdom that was reflected in heaven he is the architect of it he's the inspiration of this Kingdom and in verse 4 Genesis chapter 11 verse 4 I think I'll just pick up on more of this on Sunday or maybe next Wednesday now the people that are populating the Earth say go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven let us make us a name when Cain had a son he named it after he built a city and named it after his son that's when that's when the sun now begins uh this perversion of to be renowned to be remembered to have this kind of legacy to build a kingdom to yourself men not calling upon the name of the Lord and calling themselves the Son of God so that their legacy is essentially in heaven they're wanting to establish something here on Earth let us build us a city in a tower I'd like to get into it maybe a little bit more at another time whose Tower May reach unto Heaven their very reason why they're wanting to do this to let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth is in defiance to God's commission to know in Genesis 9. they're saying oh God told us to multiply and spread out upon the Earth sorry buddy you know what we're going to do we're just gonna go up we're not going to populate the whole earth we're going to rise up to heaven and if you ever try to flood the Earth again we're going to have a city and a kingdom that can rise above all your floods maybe they saw a high water mark maybe they knew just exactly how high they would need to build it and they had some sensor idea of what they would need to do to overcome the judgments of God do you realize just how anti-word they were how arrogant they were let us build us a city let us make us a name we're not going to scatter upon the Earth we're not going to multiply and replenish and fill up the Earth as God commanded Our Father know what to do but no we're going to make names for ourselves this is the beginning of nimrod's kingdom this is Babel which is the first word in the Bible for Babylon I was going to preach a different sermon tonight on Babylon and I felt well maybe I should just back up with the safe crowd and give some background to on where Babylon begin and Babylon begins as Babel the beginning of nimrod's kingdom was babble in the church age book chapter 5 and the pergamian church age someone already quoted this when I said Babel means they were already quoting from this church age book Babel is the original name for Babylon it means confusion where does the confusion come from mixing that's where it began in the very beginning just the mixture how did we get all the evil in the world just take two good things and put them out mix them out of place and it causes confusion Babble is the original name for Babylon it means confusion it was literally started by cush the son of him but was brought to a kingdom of power and Grandeur under his son Nimrod the mighty Hunter remember how the Bible says before the Lord meaning against the Lord so this Kingdom of Babel Babylon confusion to mix or to mingle to me is remarkable that now that we have a mixed race the very beginning of the kingdom is defined as a mixture a hybrid and it's confusion utter confusion it is against God it's a seated discrepancy manifested itself it's anti-god it's against the word it opposes God it exalts itself against God here's a mighty Hunter Nimrod according to the Genesis 11 account and also according to profane history set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished his accomplishments were so Monumental that the kingdom of Babylon was called the head of gold amongst all the world governments so now it's not just a a localized Kingdom it's not one that would look back in history and say wow this guy was the ruler of Mesopotamia and and some acknowledgment of a mighty Hunter within some region but it becomes like the The Benchmark the symbol a kingdom of Babylons the head of gold amongst all World governments that his religion gave prominence is proven by the fact that scripture identifies it and this is where we escalate very quickly all the way to the end identifies it with saying Satan completely in Isaiah chapter 14 and in Revelations chapter 17 and 18. this is the the outline I've been working on in some of these service you see in chapter 14 of Isaiah and we're wanting to come to the fruits of it in Revelation 17 and 18. how it began in this as a seed in the beginning as a lie you shall not surely die that's where it began in Satan's Eden or in God's Eden and Satan's Eden and its climax is described in Revelation 17 and Revelations 18. and by history we can prove that it invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatry and the theme of Mythology through the names of the Gods though the names of the Gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people so it's all tracks back to the same it all comes from the same thing isn't any wonder that you'll find different narratives that are very very similar is any wonder that the allegories and the all traditions and the stories that have been passed down that they're just recycling all these different narratives that have always existed because it all comes from a singular Source the ambition of Satan to be worshiped as God and it doesn't matter to him if they all use different names they have all different ideas and different ways it's going to end in different ways that it began as long as he's the one being worshiped and not the true God because he's behind it all he's the father of it all God has not fathered multiple religions and multiple ways of being worshiped and being multiple deities oh well you worship the son I'm in the Sun Well you worship the water I'm in the water no God is worshiped through one way alone and that's through spirit and Truth says that he made a name for himself and his followers goes without saying for as long as this present age goes on he says until Jesus reveals himself to his brethren because that's when there's this shift this giant shift that takes place the pre-millennial purging and the millennial Reign upon the Earth until then he will be worshiped and honored though under a different name from nimrod and as a temple and in a temple slightly different from the one in which he was originally adored this is Brother Branham identifying how that in the beginning after the fall when Babel rise up Rises up it's the first of Babylon that you see in the end in the same Satan that was worshiped then is the same one that's worshiped in the end who sits in the temple being worshiped as God as we read in Thessalonians this is what he wanted this was his ambition he wants to be the one that has looked to and they think they're worshiping God but they're actually worshiping Satan and as brother Branham took it from nimrod being under this inspiration of Lucifer in Isaiah chapter 14. I will exalt myself the king of Tyree the I'll exalt myself above the stars of God I will be like the most high I want to sit on the sides of the North and the Mount of the congregation I want to be lifted up I want to be exalted I want to have the throne I want even in the language I want to exalt myself above the sons of God how could he exalt himself above the sons of God by making the sons of God diminish themselves in the way Nations being weakened and being brought down to earth and now that the sons of God have intermarried and mingled themselves he's rising up being worshiped through his through the through the mixture and the mingling of Babylon and brother Branham identified it in Revelations chapter 17 and 18. and let's just look at Revelations chapter 18 verses 1 to 3. I'll close I'll close with these with these things here now we're I know we're kind of fast forwarding forwarding this and I'm doing it because there's just no way I'm going to spend I can't spend four services on it and then get to Revelation 17 and you all be like what that's Babylon we already know it I'm not I'm not going to surprise anybody you know this is like I I did not know it was a mother Harlot and it was Babylon and it's this religious system and I just thought we were all brothers and we were all serving God and no we know these things so I could come to here because some of you are saying well you just get there will you just get there please Revelations 18 I want to get to 19 and 20. I want to get to the end and so in Revelations 18 verses 1 to 3 and after these things I saw another angel came down come down from heaven and having great power and the Earth was enlightened with his glory verse two and he cried mightily with the strong voice saying now we're not going to look so much at what he is saying about Babylon the great falling but look at what it's become Babylon the great is Fallen is Fallen and that even that description describes what Babylon the whole Ark of Babylon is from the very beginning and has become the habitation of devils remember Satan's um ambition in the beginning is he wanted to indwell man as God indwelled in man now this is where to me what brother Branham is teaching us and zeroing in is tying up a lot of loose ends and taking a lot of things for us to recognize that Satan has always been projecting himself certain ways and men men have always been wrestling with certain truths and presented certain truths and brother Branham is able to take these things and zero in on it to where we see that's what Satan was wanting to do God Alone had reserved flesh for him to dwell in Satan creates a like flesh human and Mankind in such a way that he can dwell in it and now God looks at it at the end in Revelations 18 and says that Babylon has become the habitation of devils how did Brother Branham say it I believe we were on Sunday through the people and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird Revelation 17 describes it in different ways and identifies us to us that spiritual Babylon this mother harlot in all of her daughters which is represented in a spiritual Babylon and a religious system now as the scripture looks at it and Revelation Revelations 18 habitation of devils the hold of every foul spirit so if there's a foul spirit it's in her cage of every unclean and hateful bird it's in her for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her for fornication what a description brings us all the way back to the beginning and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies what a description what an incredible uh way to describe what John saw in chapter 17 is wow what a Wonder incredibly powerful uh system a kingdom an economy now the Bible is saying this is what it is no matter how beautiful it looks no matter how rich it is and no matter how uh wonderful it may and it may offer its amenities and how religious and spiritual and profound and great remember that it says that it'll be so close it could deceive the very elective possible if everyone could just look and it signs that habitation of devils we'd like right we see look in there there's a cage full of unclean and hateful birds like ah no thank you I'm not interested but it presents itself in glory it presents itself as signs and wonders it presents itself as Rich to increase with Goods it presents itself in a very awesome inspiring way is when John thought wow he wandered at it but now what's behind it the ambition of Lucifer the culmination of everything he was sowing in the beginning even the very climax of Babel in Genesis 10 this is Satan's kingdom Satan's Eden and something to really Ponder is it comes to this after Satan's even comes to this image after Christ is kicked out of the church once he's kicked out of the church in laodicea now Satan can bring it to where it's the hold of every habitation of devils the hold of every foul Spirit the cage of every unclean and hateful bird Christ has been pushed out so now all there is is a cavity again a vacuum just like he did in the Garden of Eden now he fills it up with confusion he fills it up with Babylon brother Branham continues I'm cut out a rather somewhat lengthy portion maybe two paragraphs or so from the church age book where brother Brown was saying that he's now being worshiped in a temple differently than what he was originally adored and he continues to talk about Satan's ambition and how this is what he wanted to do all along he wanted to be worshiped as God this is what the thoughts he had in the beginning so it's brother Branham who's kind of tracking this for us he said there's no time to engage in a discussion of this it is merely introduced that you may see that there were two religions and two only and the evil one became worldwide two religions and two religions only you had the worship of the one true God and everything else and he says monotheism turned to polytheism in Babylon where there was the worship of one true God this is something that's actually been studied quite extensively I believe brother Branham quotes from a couple historians historians In this passage you can go back and read their their surmisings from ancient texts and ancient religions out of Egypt and all over and all the different gods that existed they say that there was and even whether it be Islam and these other religions they they look back and say that in ancient times and everything that we can gather we see that at one time they all believed in one true God and Satan wasn't satisfied in just having one true God he wanted to cause confusion so now the one true God is split up into polytheism and this statement to me was inspiration in the beginning when we started this series on the kingdom the devil's lie and the devil's Mysteries rose up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in that City the city of Babel in the beginning of Babylon this is where Satan begins to spread his lie and his Mysteries and to look at it that way the devil used a lie in the Garden of Eden and and it and he even begins it I guess it's a very interesting language he has his own Mysteries and that's why you can't just get you know can't just love to have your ears itched right and like oh man I just love the Mysteries I love the Deep things man there's some people that preach things that are mysterious because that's exactly all they are is mysterious you know just ways I remember I think I've shared this before one time a man taught on the godhead and afterwards a sister left the church and said I don't know whether there's one God three or five Gods but that was deep and and the only thing that was deep is the hole that's being dug right you're just digging yourself a hole it may seem deep but the devil has Mysteries like whoa isn't that mysterious isn't that neat and this is what he wanted to do in the beginning the devil's lie in the devil's mystery so the lie that he spoke in the very beginning that's what he is the father of lies and now the devil's mystery make things mysterious make them make things confusing even he's able to create records and sew things in and do all sorts of stuff why to cause confusion it rises up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in Babylon Satan wants to destroy the mysteries of God he rises up against the truth of God this is what is a sale this is what is attack this is what is being divided is the mystery of God and the truth of God God created the Earth for a purpose to get a bride out of it now Satan wants to raise up his own bride and present her as being the very thing that God wanted to achieve in the beginning so that he through her can receive all the worship and so it's the devil's lies and the devil's Mysteries that are rising up against the truth of God the word of God in the mystery of God that wants to be revealed through the truth in that City in Babel the beginning of Babylon brother Brown says Satan truly became the God of this world and exacted worship from those that he had duped causing them to believe that he truly he was truly the Lord I know I'm looking at the end and so we're not necessarily tracking it the trail of the serpent through the Old Testament you know what verse 4 says right Revelations 18 4. God identifies the condition of this church the condition of the world and all of Satan's kingdoms and it says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues another voice says in Revelation 20. I If any man will open up if he'll hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me this is feasting with the Lord as we said Sunday in the presence of all our enemies in the very middle of Satan's Eden there's a voice that says come out of her my people why because I'm going to judge her come out of her that you not partake of her sins that you receive not of her plagues and brother Branham identifies himself with this voice of Revelations 18 4 saying come out of her my people come out of the religious systems come out of Catholicism come out of denominationalism come out of babylonianism come out of all come out of Bible come out of the confusion what does he use to bring us to it the revelation of the mystery of God the restoration of the truth of God the restoration of the word as it rose up in Babble against the truth as the devil's lies rose up against the God's truth as a devil's Mysteries rose up to confuse the mysteries of God is it any wonder that in the end the mysteries of God are being revealed and all the loose sins are being tied together and it's those divinely revealed mystery truths that begin to pull us out of a Babylon condition well because it rose up that way in the beginning in Bible so it's going to take the very answer to that the restoration of that to shake us from those things the Bible says in Genesis 11 31 that Abram went forth from Earth which means Flame of chaldea what does God tell us in the very Book of Genesis where this Mighty Man raises up with the Tower of BaByliss being erected and the Very seeds of Babylon are being planted at a one-day grow into this beautifully powerful woman in Revelation 17. he says come out of her my people in Revelations 18 4 and you go right back to Genesis 11 Genesis 12 and you see that God did the same thing in Abraham said come out of her come out of here and I'll I'm going to show you a land that I'm gonna I'm gonna give you and it's in the very place where Babylon was raising up but it's right in the very place where the New Jerusalem is going to come and settle back down on because he gives us the image he gives us the type he shows us that I'm going to call the people out of Babylon because what does I think I say this quite often when God calls Abram it's a it's a complete interrupt to the narrative we have Genesis 1 to Genesis 11 tells us the history of 2000 years we get this we get four thousand years roughly of history of mankind and the flood and we see so much just sandwiched in a very short period of time and God has just want us to understand the context for how you'd say Abram I want you to get out of the flames get out of er come away from Babylon come away from the seed of all this demonic worship come away from polytheism come away and I'm going to reveal myself to you because I'm the one true God the one who spoke and caused the worlds to come into existence I'm going to make myself known to you and from then on we only know about the world and the rest of what we only know about Babylon as it relates to Israel because God keeps using Babylon for judgment and they only enter into the narrative because God's focusing on Israel and they only enter the picture until after God the gospel turns to the Jews and then now once God is in the kingdoms of this world the time and the hour for all these Kings to be overthrown and the gospel is going to go to the Gentiles and begin to break the bow the bounds of polytheism and break the chains of this false worship and break the chains of all these demon powers in the Gentiles and the Heathen it's then that we begin to look outward and think about the whole world so this beautiful image of Abram being called out of Babylon it's there to tell us that in the end it shows us in the end this is what God is doing he's calling you out of Babylonian thinking calling you away from this Babylon system into his kingdom I believe an interns has been ministered to us in this hour they're saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of our sins amen but Micah could you come to the piano God bless you let's stand tonight
