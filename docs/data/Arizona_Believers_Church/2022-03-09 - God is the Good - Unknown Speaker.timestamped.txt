[0:00] genesis chapter 9
[0:02] verses 1 to 7 i'm going to come back to
[0:04] verses 5 and 6 rather quickly
[0:06] but i wanted to read
[0:08] these verses surrounding it as god has
[0:10] given a blessing to noah as they have
[0:12] departed from the ark and god has judged
[0:15] mankind
[0:17] for their thoughts being only evil
[0:19] continually
[0:20] god even himself saying the end of all
[0:22] flesh is before me and he judges the
[0:24] earth
[0:25] then god makes these statements to know
[0:27] it as a blessing upon noah and god
[0:29] blessed noah and his sons and said unto
[0:31] them be fruitful and multiply and
[0:33] replenish the earth what a striking
[0:35] commandment sins that he'd given this to
[0:38] the man and the woman in genesis 1 26
[0:40] and the fear of you and the dread of you
[0:41] shall be upon every beast of the earth
[0:43] and upon every fowl of the air upon all
[0:45] that moveth upon the earth and upon all
[0:47] the fishes of the sea into your hand are
[0:49] they delivered every moving thing that
[0:52] liveth shall be meat for you even as the
[0:53] green herb have i given you all things
[0:55] but flesh with the life thereof which is
[0:57] the blood thereof shall you not eat
[1:00] and surely your blood or your lives will
[1:02] i require at the hand of every beast
[1:04] will i require and at the hand of man at
[1:06] the hand of every man's brother will i
[1:08] require the life of man
[1:10] who so sheddeth man's blood by man shall
[1:13] his blood be shed for in the image of
[1:15] god made he man and jew be fruitful and
[1:19] multiply bring forth abundantly in the
[1:21] earth and multiply therein
[1:24] bless you could take your seeds
[1:26] i have a very very simple thought this
[1:29] evening
[1:30] and it is
[1:32] one that is very fundamental
[1:35] and i trust will be a blessing to you my
[1:37] title is god
[1:38] is the good
[1:40] god is the good and
[1:43] i am pondering the next subject that
[1:45] we've been studying and we believe the
[1:47] lord will just open up to us for maybe a
[1:49] few services
[1:50] on i am the open book i am an open book
[1:54] i just it seemed to fit to me
[1:56] this is a subject that i had been
[1:57] studying god had dealt with me on
[1:59] to minister some time ago and was just
[2:02] waiting for the right moment to do so
[2:03] and it just seems to be a really good
[2:05] fundamental service because there's a
[2:08] way that we think and i'm just going to
[2:10] take my time
[2:11] and express this as we consider the
[2:13] title god is the good
[2:15] we can think in a way to where there's
[2:17] there's elect and non-elect there's
[2:19] those that are of god and those that
[2:21] aren't of god and we kind of have that
[2:23] that way of viewing things and thinking
[2:25] about things and there is there is a
[2:27] truth to that there is an application to
[2:29] that those who are elect those who are
[2:32] not elect but we can tend to think so uh
[2:36] with such distinct uh such a distinction
[2:39] that we feel well there's those that are
[2:41] of god that believe the message and
[2:43] they're the ones who are not evil and
[2:45] then everyone else is serpentied right
[2:47] and that's kind of just the way that we
[2:49] we view things i remember one time
[2:51] someone shared with me a testimony
[2:53] and uh they were sitting down to eat
[2:55] with somebody and they said see this
[2:57] room it's full of serpents
[2:59] and uh and and that's kind of the at we
[3:01] walk around every day looking at
[3:03] everyone as serpent seed but just in
[3:04] that concept we kind of miss really what
[3:08] the truth is of the original sin and the
[3:10] resulting mongrelizing or hybrid into
[3:13] the blood and realize that really all of
[3:15] us were born of a
[3:16] woman born between even satan all of us
[3:19] have carry within us that stain of sin
[3:22] but i i want to address i want to just
[3:25] use this as a very simple thought
[3:27] to give us a principle that
[3:29] you have to you
[3:31] you need the holy spirit to kind of take
[3:33] a hold of it and i believe we could
[3:34] we're speaking to those who let the lord
[3:36] do that
[3:37] now just to start off on a positive note
[3:39] i want to define the word cynicism
[3:43] did you get the irony of that start on a
[3:45] positive note but there's uh just to
[3:47] define this cynicism i found this
[3:49] definition in researching just the word
[3:51] and where it came from and instead of
[3:52] getting to maybe the philosophical
[3:55] scholarship definition of it it's a
[3:57] perverse disposition to put an
[3:59] unfavorable interpretation upon conduct
[4:02] so if you are a cynic or cynicism is
[4:04] kind of a a perverse they used as a
[4:06] perverse disposition
[4:08] the in any time something is done you
[4:10] view it negatively you put an
[4:12] unfavorable interpretation to it so if
[4:14] you see somebody giving somebody money
[4:16] you just naturally assume oh that's a
[4:18] drug deal or oh they're they're trying
[4:19] to buy them off and so that's kind of
[4:21] what a cynic would do is there's any
[4:24] situation you view it in an unfavorable
[4:26] light so to be cynical
[4:28] and what providing these definitions for
[4:30] you so you could see them and ponder
[4:32] them to be cynical is believing that
[4:33] people are motivated by self-interest if
[4:36] you see somebody acting they're doing it
[4:38] for themselves you see somebody doing
[4:40] something oh they must have something to
[4:42] gain from him and then it's also to mean
[4:44] to be distrustful of human sincerity or
[4:47] integrity
[4:49] you're familiar with the word cynic or
[4:50] cynical or cynicism right
[4:52] and so i just wanted to define these
[4:54] because this is what i'm wanting to
[4:55] address in this subject we say god is
[4:58] the good
[4:59] is to address
[5:00] the the cynical part of our nature if
[5:02] there's any kind of cynicism in our life
[5:04] to where we see something we hear
[5:06] something somebody says something we
[5:07] hear something is taken place we just
[5:10] naturally instinctively uh just assume
[5:13] or believe that it's uh it's for their
[5:16] they're being selfish or it's for their
[5:17] own interest or they're not sincere
[5:20] they're not doing it
[5:21] in an upright way or we think oh well
[5:23] that just must be evil that just must be
[5:25] the devil we need to be very quickly or
[5:27] very uh
[5:28] very cautious that we don't quickly
[5:30] assume the worst or the negative when we
[5:32] hear something
[5:33] maybe another way that this could be
[5:35] defined is pessimism
[5:37] it's a tendency to see the worst aspect
[5:39] of things or to believe that the worst
[5:41] will happen
[5:42] and i'm using this maybe to drill down
[5:45] more of what i'm talking about because
[5:46] there's a there's kind of a way of
[5:48] thinking where we realize that human
[5:49] beings act to fulfill certain needs and
[5:52] they just always do that there's a
[5:53] hierarchy of needs or when we look at
[5:55] economics and you if you use economics
[5:58] as the means by describing or defining
[6:00] or interpreting behavior you say well
[6:01] there has to be something coming from
[6:03] this that makes somebody feel good there
[6:05] has to be something coming from this
[6:07] activity that is a benefit that the
[6:09] person is deriving but it's not always
[6:11] money
[6:12] and it's not always something that might
[6:14] advance somebody economically but people
[6:16] will act in an altruistic way and act in
[6:18] a very sincere way and act with
[6:20] integrity and honestly in not just to
[6:22] rip somebody off not to get ahead of
[6:24] somebody else but they do it sincerely
[6:26] they're doing it honestly they're doing
[6:27] it for good
[6:29] and and it it's the truth
[6:32] but that they're acting that way but if
[6:34] we're the cynic we have a hard time
[6:36] believing that right
[6:38] and it and so another way of looking at
[6:39] it is maybe to divorce itself from maybe
[6:42] these base instincts and maybe an
[6:44] economic justification for something but
[6:46] it would be our tendency just to see the
[6:48] worst aspect of things to believe that
[6:50] the worst thing will happen it's a lack
[6:52] of hope or confidence in the future or
[6:54] this habitually expecting the worst
[6:57] uh and or
[6:59] uh
[7:00] if i i don't know if i even provided
[7:02] that on there
[7:03] it's a lack of expectation
[7:05] or hope or confidence in the future
[7:08] or just expecting
[7:11] or just exaggerating the evils of life
[7:14] that's what you fixate on that's what
[7:16] you look at that's what you concentrate
[7:17] on the evils of life the bad things are
[7:19] happening uh to be pessimistic it's just
[7:21] kind of a depressing view of things
[7:23] oh great this is gonna happen oh
[7:25] wonderful this is gonna happen it's the
[7:27] old boy that's that's the pessimism uh
[7:30] that we're talking about habitually uh
[7:32] instinctively expecting the worst of
[7:34] things
[7:35] and now that that's the positive note i
[7:38] wanted to begin on
[7:40] because that's what i want to address if
[7:42] we never come back to cynicism pessimism
[7:44] or being cynical or this negativity and
[7:46] expecting the worst and exaggerating the
[7:48] evils of life if we don't come back to
[7:50] that i want you to remember this subject
[7:51] matter is to address the critic and the
[7:54] skeptic in your heart
[7:56] address that part in our spirits that
[7:58] hopefully we can become less critical
[8:00] less cynical
[8:01] less pessimistic
[8:02] now genesis chapter nine as we've
[8:04] already read it
[8:05] and um and it's very fresh in our minds
[8:08] how god is blessing noah and he's given
[8:10] them he's given him quite an
[8:11] extraordinary blessing it's changed just
[8:13] a little bit from how he blessed adam
[8:16] where now it's the fear of every beast
[8:18] is going to the fear of man is going to
[8:19] be upon every beast so we know something
[8:21] has shifted something has changed but
[8:23] yet he's telling him to be fruitful and
[8:24] multiply and replenish
[8:27] and then in verse five and surely your
[8:29] blood of your lives will i require
[8:32] at the end every beast will i require it
[8:34] and at the hand of man and at the hand
[8:36] of every man's brother will i require
[8:37] the life of man
[8:40] and then this verse
[8:42] is where i want to begin
[8:44] whoso sheddeth man's blood by man
[8:47] shall his blood be shed it says for in
[8:49] the image of god
[8:51] made he
[8:53] man
[8:54] this is quite the statement
[8:57] this is after the fall
[8:58] right
[8:59] where this our bible is working
[9:01] chronologically here in genesis chapter
[9:02] 9 after the fall after the flood
[9:07] and god points out that man was made in
[9:11] the image of god
[9:12] truly if we read it in genesis chapter 1
[9:14] and we looked at it we would understand
[9:16] that yes
[9:17] adam was made in the image of god adam
[9:19] being a spirit being
[9:21] was first made first a spirit being and
[9:23] that was in the image of god and then
[9:25] he's placed in flesh
[9:27] and we recognize that and we wouldn't
[9:29] wrestle at all in genesis chapter 1 and
[9:30] genesis chapter 2. we wouldn't even
[9:32] wrestle at all with respect to adam that
[9:34] he is in the image of god and he was a
[9:36] reflection of god but god picks up after
[9:39] the fall even after the flood and he
[9:41] re-emphasizes this truth and he says man
[9:45] is made in the image of god for in the
[9:47] image of god god made man
[9:51] and so there's an important truth
[9:53] embodied in this fact because god says
[9:54] it and if god says that it's fact we can
[9:56] accept it that now as he speaks about
[9:59] humanity and mankind that's going to
[10:01] usher forth from noah and his three sons
[10:03] do we look at it and say this is a this
[10:05] is a fact that these men this humanity
[10:08] mankind is still in the image of god and
[10:10] there's an important truth that we must
[10:12] respect in this
[10:14] adam was made in the image of god
[10:17] but here if i could rephrase it for in
[10:19] the image of god made he-man it says in
[10:22] one translation for to kill a man is to
[10:23] kill one made like god
[10:26] think about that for to kill a man is to
[10:28] kill one who is made like god
[10:31] so even though adam fell and then
[10:33] there's a subsequent generations uh that
[10:36] come forth through
[10:37] has fallen mankind and there's a mixing
[10:39] there's a mongolizing there's a hybrid
[10:42] and all of mankind god says is
[10:45] plagued with evil and their thoughts and
[10:46] imaginations are only evil continually
[10:49] there's still an image of god that
[10:51] remained in humanity
[10:54] even though the holy image was lost
[10:56] as soon as man sinned even though there
[10:58] was a a divine nature that left them in
[11:01] the garden
[11:02] what i want you to consider and i'm
[11:04] going to substantiate this using the
[11:06] message of the hour because again i said
[11:07] my my thought is very very simple
[11:10] that even though the holy image left
[11:12] them even though there's this divine
[11:13] nature that was lost in the garden of
[11:15] eden the channels clogged up there's
[11:17] still an imprint of the divine that
[11:19] exists within humanity
[11:22] there's still a if i can say a shadow of
[11:24] deity there's still something that's in
[11:26] that spirit of man
[11:28] that god made
[11:30] and the message law have in his shadow
[11:32] brother branham is talking about eve and
[11:34] he said he's describing her as being a
[11:36] very beautiful woman and that this
[11:38] artist had rendered her as being very
[11:40] ugly and haggard and he's saying that
[11:41] that's nonsense she was a very beautiful
[11:44] woman and he begins to describe her and
[11:45] he says i see her sitting there and her
[11:47] hair hanging down her back and her eyes
[11:50] was as bright as the stars of heaven he
[11:53] says when adam looked at her it put such
[11:55] a shock that still lives in mankind
[11:58] and we amplified this statement to a
[12:01] much greater degree about a year ago but
[12:04] in revisiting it i just want to make
[12:06] this point that brother branham is
[12:08] describing the moment that adam saw the
[12:10] woman
[12:11] he says when he saw her she had such a
[12:13] beauty and having come from man in this
[12:16] affinity between the man and the woman
[12:18] that when he sees her he says it put a
[12:21] shock that still lives in mankind
[12:24] that moment of the woman becoming a
[12:26] revelation to the man
[12:28] it it triggered something in adam and
[12:31] brother i'm saying it's still this shock
[12:33] is still reverberating
[12:35] still within men today
[12:38] you follow me
[12:40] that there's a there's a maybe a thought
[12:42] or feeling or an instinct that brother
[12:44] man says you could trace all the way
[12:45] back to the moment that man saw the
[12:47] woman and it says a shock that still
[12:49] lives in mankind today
[12:52] now if it could be that way of the man
[12:54] seeing the woman i'm wanting just to use
[12:56] that as an example of how that something
[12:59] that was with an atom this shock that
[13:01] was put in him has survived till this
[13:03] time though it could be manipulated it
[13:04] can be perverted though it's not maybe
[13:06] in its purest form as it was there with
[13:08] adam despite time without despite the
[13:11] delusion of adam's nature there's still
[13:13] something that's in man that god had
[13:16] created
[13:17] brother ben mentioned it in his
[13:19] testimony
[13:20] of how that brother branham when he
[13:22] uh was
[13:24] testifying to that infidel he was using
[13:27] nature
[13:28] and in describing nature what was he
[13:30] what was he trying to bring up
[13:32] an intelligence that was greater
[13:35] than what man could figure out and he
[13:37] was pointing to a divine nature we may
[13:39] call it mother nature and how but that
[13:41] mother nature was put there by god god
[13:43] designed that so nature speaks of god
[13:47] and you recall how brother branham tells
[13:49] the testimony of the salvation of bert
[13:51] call
[13:52] and there i think was in miami or new
[13:54] england hunting at the pond of safety
[13:56] and he told the story of how that a call
[13:58] was used uh to
[14:00] mimic the sound
[14:02] of a fawn in danger
[14:04] and there was this mother deer who poked
[14:07] its head up and knew the hunter was
[14:08] there
[14:09] but yet that call was was working on
[14:12] something within this mother's nature
[14:14] and he says this mother dare put herself
[14:16] in danger knowing that she could be shot
[14:18] but there was something in her heart
[14:19] that was being pulled upon out of with
[14:22] this fear that maybe one of her own was
[14:24] in trouble
[14:25] and brother branham
[14:26] tells the story that mother dear a
[14:28] number of times and he says that she a
[14:31] mother deer displayed genuine love
[14:34] think about this this is an animal now i
[14:37] know it's not going to be hard for eliza
[14:38] to believe this but because she loves
[14:40] all animals and she's a great defender
[14:42] of animals but a lot of us might think
[14:44] an animal displaying true love
[14:47] a mother dear is going to display true
[14:49] love and you read the instance i went
[14:50] through and started reading all the
[14:51] instances where brother bram talked
[14:53] about it and he uses he describes it
[14:56] that this deer expressed a divine love
[15:00] that that's what was seen that what what
[15:01] bert had seen in this mother it
[15:04] reflected something of a divine nature
[15:07] it reflected something about god and
[15:09] something about his character and and
[15:11] that's what really got to the heart of
[15:13] bird as a sinner and he gave his heart
[15:15] to the lord and became a very
[15:17] extraordinary conservationist and has a
[15:20] testimony even to this day among certain
[15:22] circles as to um his his attitude
[15:25] towards conservation and nature
[15:27] and so the this this
[15:29] what brother madam used as an example he
[15:32] says don't you want to have a love like
[15:33] that mother deer had
[15:35] and this is this is speaking to us don't
[15:37] you want to do that
[15:38] so even in nature
[15:41] even in nature falling nature the fear
[15:43] of man is upon these beasts and we don't
[15:45] look them at them as being redeemed and
[15:46] we see this cycle of
[15:49] procreation that's taking place over
[15:50] thousands of years but yet there's still
[15:52] a nature inside of them
[15:54] that speaks of the character of god
[15:57] and brother branham in the message
[15:58] question and answer says and he put the
[15:59] spirit of man in this animal man here he
[16:02] created him first in the image of god as
[16:03] a spirit then he says the spirit is
[16:05] placed in flesh and he calls that flesh
[16:07] the animal man
[16:09] because we realize that a man without
[16:10] the holy ghost is likened into an animal
[16:13] there's there's this animal nature
[16:15] that's still he's still subject to you
[16:17] put that spirit of a man in this animal
[16:18] man here and he become a living soul now
[16:21] that's the difference between a man and
[16:23] an animal
[16:24] the animal don't build automobiles and
[16:26] he doesn't do things like that to help
[16:27] his living and so forth like that he's
[16:29] an animal dumb brute he's got no he
[16:31] hasn't got a soul he can't read and
[16:33] write he can't talk speak he's a dumb
[16:36] brute but a man is in the in flesh like
[16:39] a brute
[16:41] but he's got a soul of god in him
[16:44] what makes him immortal he's got a soul
[16:46] of god in him that what makes him
[16:48] immortal
[16:49] and that's not the catholic doctrine of
[16:51] the immortality of the soul but it's
[16:53] that soul that is judged by the second
[16:56] death it's going to be the soul that
[16:57] soul that ultimately dies he's got a
[16:58] soul of god in him what makes him
[17:00] immortal and he can invent look what he
[17:03] can do he's almost an e on equal with
[17:05] god because he's the son of god even in
[17:09] his fallen estate he's wonderful
[17:12] now this is not
[17:14] uh the humanity and mankind even in his
[17:18] fallen estate there's something about
[17:21] humanity
[17:22] and there's a lot of scriptures we can
[17:23] use maybe a lot of other quotes we can
[17:25] use but what i want you to realize is as
[17:27] brother man begins to describe this
[17:29] person he's not just describing them in
[17:30] genesis chapter 2 but he's saying even
[17:32] now today there's a soul inside of him
[17:34] that can come that came from god he can
[17:36] invent he can almost eat with god he's a
[17:38] son of god even in his fallen estate
[17:40] there's something wonderful about
[17:41] mankind
[17:44] humans still have instincts and desires
[17:47] and abilities
[17:49] that speak of the divine despite their
[17:51] fallen nature
[17:53] in the message thirst i think this one
[17:54] will certainly resonate with you if
[17:56] you're uh wanting just to be invited
[17:58] into this and compelled into this more
[18:00] this will do so it says i've had people
[18:02] tell me oh i never did thirst for the
[18:04] things of god want the things of god i
[18:06] believe it's just for some people to
[18:08] want to be christians he said oh no
[18:10] that's wrong
[18:12] it's actually something that's
[18:13] associated with every human being
[18:15] now think of that because we got it we
[18:17] kind of got it down to where you're
[18:18] either elected or you're not
[18:20] right you're either elected or not and
[18:22] i'm not taking that don't get nervous
[18:23] i'm not taking that away but he's saying
[18:25] that in the heart he said that everyone
[18:28] this desire to be a christian or want to
[18:30] be a christian there's something about
[18:32] that he says it's actually something
[18:33] that's associated with every human being
[18:36] it certainly is true when we come to
[18:38] this country in the early days we found
[18:39] the indians here and the indians though
[18:41] they were heathen at that time they
[18:43] worshiped the son or something listen as
[18:46] long as they are human there's something
[18:48] in them a natural thirst calling out for
[18:51] god somewhere
[18:53] as long as they are human there's
[18:55] something in them
[18:56] you say oh well that's just for
[18:57] christians that's just for people who
[18:59] want to be christians he says no it's
[19:01] actually something that's associated
[19:02] with every human being
[19:04] so in every human being there's some
[19:06] divine thirst within every human being
[19:08] there's some divine attraction there's
[19:10] something toward god there's something
[19:12] related to god in all men
[19:15] and that's why a heathen will worship
[19:18] something they'll have something to be a
[19:19] god they make god out of the moon they
[19:21] make a god out of the sun they make a
[19:23] god out of the elements of nature why
[19:25] it's because some instinct or desire
[19:27] inside of them that wants to worship
[19:29] something
[19:31] it's a thirst put there by god
[19:34] a divine a divine something he says as
[19:37] long as they're human there's something
[19:39] in them calling out for god
[19:42] now
[19:43] this statement
[19:45] it kind of opens up into a much larger
[19:46] room to explore but i want to just kind
[19:48] of peek in real quick
[19:50] but in the greatest battle ever fought
[19:51] he says there's only two forces satan
[19:53] and god
[19:55] all right
[19:56] i know this dichotomy sometimes we
[19:58] really wrestle with
[19:59] there's only two forces so we say well i
[20:02] want to go to i want to go eat tonight i
[20:04] want to go to ihop and i want to have as
[20:06] many pancakes as i want to eat well is
[20:07] that god or the devil right there's only
[20:09] two forces
[20:10] what's driving me to do this but he says
[20:12] there's only two forces satan and god
[20:14] and what is satan's weapon against you
[20:16] and i wanted to
[20:17] keep this in there so you can recognize
[20:19] well there's two forces there's a way
[20:20] that satan works is the way that god
[20:21] works this is how satan works he's
[20:23] trying to get you to disbelieve your
[20:24] weapon
[20:25] he disarms you if he can get you to
[20:27] disbelieve your weapon as equivalent if
[20:29] he can get you to believe that your
[20:30] weapon is not strong enough he has
[20:32] disarmed you so different ways he
[20:34] describes this but satan's weapon is to
[20:36] get you to disbelieve your weapon
[20:39] this is what he uses against you he
[20:40] disarms you by getting you to disbelieve
[20:42] that your weapon is as great as his or
[20:45] not as strong if he can get you to
[20:47] believe it's not as strong as his that's
[20:49] how he works so how does satan work he
[20:51] works through disbelief
[20:53] that's how satan works there's only two
[20:54] forces there's the force of god and
[20:56] there's a force of satan satan can only
[20:59] only works for through disbelief and
[21:02] satan cannot create so he can only
[21:04] pervert
[21:05] so it's not that satan has all the
[21:07] material in the world or doesn't have
[21:08] any material to work with so he just
[21:10] creates it he has to work with what god
[21:12] gave him
[21:13] and so satan if there's two forces in
[21:15] the world
[21:16] and one is of god and one is of satan
[21:18] satan works through force and he works
[21:20] through unbelief and cause you to doubt
[21:22] and cause you to worry cause you to fear
[21:24] and he can only take good things and
[21:26] pervert them
[21:28] bill abraham said there's two elements
[21:30] that control all people
[21:32] fear faith
[21:34] only two elements only two forces god
[21:36] and satan only two elements fear of
[21:38] faith now when you begin to think about
[21:40] it that way we can't take this two
[21:42] forces god and satan and then two
[21:44] elements faith and fear and then try to
[21:47] put people in those buckets but we're
[21:49] looking at influences we're looking at
[21:51] motivation we're looking at design god
[21:53] designed the woman a particular way
[21:55] satan redesigned her
[21:57] god created the earth for a purpose
[21:58] satan is trying to use it for another
[22:00] and so we look i want you just to kind
[22:02] of think in this
[22:04] uh uh uh just to
[22:06] ponder this very deeply
[22:08] how that there's these forces that exist
[22:10] in the world there's these elements that
[22:12] exist in the world
[22:14] and that evil resides in man because of
[22:17] sin
[22:18] had there not been sin there wouldn't be
[22:19] evil resonant in mankind had the woman
[22:21] never fallen there wouldn't be this evil
[22:24] instinct within humanity
[22:26] and we recognize satan is a force in
[22:28] this world fear is an element in this
[22:30] world
[22:31] and we and we see the evil all around us
[22:33] but i want to ask you a question what
[22:35] about the good in life
[22:37] what about good things in life what
[22:39] about things that you enjoy or things
[22:41] that other people enjoy what about good
[22:43] people
[22:46] and if i could say this way as i read
[22:48] this quote and pondered it his weapon is
[22:50] disbelief
[22:52] if satan by disbelief can get us into
[22:54] cynical cycles
[22:56] we're just we're always the critic
[22:59] we're always the skeptic we're always
[23:01] doubting
[23:02] uh we're just very quick
[23:04] uh very quick to dispute or to argue
[23:08] the contrarian
[23:10] where it's just almost instinctively and
[23:13] i speak this very honestly i think it's
[23:14] a mcgeary trait
[23:16] i i just just to take the opposite side
[23:19] like one day you can say the sky is blue
[23:21] the sky is blue and the next day you
[23:22] meet somebody who's saying it's blue and
[23:24] you're like hell hold on and wait a
[23:25] minute
[23:27] i don't know i mean because somebody
[23:28] else has the idea you got to change now
[23:31] and you got to be the contrarian we
[23:32] can't be that way
[23:34] we don't want to be that way if we do we
[23:36] can actually lose the proper view of god
[23:39] and we can actually begin to skew god's
[23:41] will because we kind of put our we're
[23:43] putting our own imprint on it our our
[23:45] skepticism our cynicism brother manna
[23:47] makes the comment he says that pastors
[23:49] are suspicious people but he never said
[23:51] that so that we could sow suspicion into
[23:53] the people
[23:55] right
[23:56] it's okay for us to be suspicious we got
[23:58] a job to do
[23:59] and that that may be part of our nature
[24:01] but when we sold that into the people
[24:02] we're not doing our job
[24:05] and so i'm not i don't want to sow
[24:06] suspicion into you i want to i want to
[24:08] give you confidence in the spirit of god
[24:10] that's leading you i want you have
[24:11] confidence and the discernment that the
[24:12] word of god can give the elect in this
[24:14] hour but if we're always kind of moved
[24:16] by cynicism and pessimism i am coming
[24:18] back to it so this is good
[24:19] if we're moved by those forces then we
[24:21] can we start to view everything
[24:24] with such a negative outlook that we'll
[24:26] miss the will of god and most
[24:28] importantly the will of god for our
[24:29] lives
[24:30] we could even miss opportunities in the
[24:32] things of god because they're always
[24:34] just instinctively critical
[24:36] brother brahm says in the message
[24:37] victory day he said he's the god of the
[24:39] human race
[24:40] and if he's god at all he's interested
[24:43] in every human being because it's his
[24:45] creation
[24:46] interested in every human being because
[24:48] it's his creation
[24:50] sorry brother aaron i'm only interested
[24:52] in those that believe the seventh seal
[24:54] is opened according to the message of
[24:55] the hour
[24:57] okay well that's not like god that's
[24:58] revealed under that seal
[25:00] he says he's interested in every human
[25:02] being because it's his creation and he's
[25:04] interested in the children he's
[25:05] interested in the old age and the middle
[25:06] age he's interested in the colors of us
[25:08] and all the white the brown the black
[25:10] the yellow the different shades of skin
[25:12] from the country that we come from in
[25:13] our forefathers he's interested in all
[25:15] of us
[25:16] he's just not interested in the jews
[25:18] alone or in the yellow race black race
[25:20] white race whatever it is he's
[25:21] interested in the whole human race in
[25:24] trying to get the human race to focus
[25:26] his word down to one thing and say there
[25:29] is one god and that god give an innocent
[25:31] substitute by come becoming himself man
[25:34] in order to take away sin to save the
[25:36] whole human race
[25:37] this is the nature of god god yes he he
[25:40] loves the elect and his love is to the
[25:43] bride and he has a very specific work
[25:45] that he's going to do uh uh with the
[25:47] with the holy spirit
[25:49] in the word of god in the elect but he
[25:51] says god is interested in all mankind
[25:54] you realize that god is so interested in
[25:56] mankind that though he created the earth
[25:57] to get a bride out of it people who work
[26:00] together with god's program to see that
[26:03] that's achieved even though they're not
[26:05] bride they receive a grace
[26:07] if they fulfill god's purpose
[26:09] that god would that no man should be
[26:11] devoured that no man would be lost this
[26:13] is god's will this is god's attitude
[26:15] this is his heartbeat and so god is
[26:17] interested in the whole human race
[26:19] trying to get this human race to focus
[26:21] on his word he desires to see that they
[26:23] would they would
[26:25] that they would recognize christ
[26:28] god is great enough that he could pour
[26:29] out his spirit right now into this room
[26:32] and it only fall on the elect
[26:34] couldn't he
[26:36] couldn't he do that where where uh he
[26:38] has heal in his wings he he has joy he
[26:40] has peace he has deliverance
[26:42] and he can raise from the dead and he
[26:44] could restore limbs god could just
[26:46] discern and god knows who's elect and he
[26:49] could say oh you you want to be healed
[26:51] of cancer sorry you're not elect
[26:53] but does he
[26:56] isn't there so much in the word of god
[26:58] that people are partakers of and they
[27:00] benefit by and they enjoy the bible says
[27:02] the rain falls on the just and the
[27:04] unjust the the wheat rejoices in the sun
[27:07] and the rain just as much as the cockle
[27:08] bar god if he wanted to could cause a
[27:10] drought upon this plant but a rain upon
[27:13] another he's god he could do it if he
[27:15] wanted to
[27:16] but he's got an interest in every human
[27:18] being he's interested in the whole human
[27:19] race
[27:21] there's a statement brother says that
[27:22] man was made to be a god and god was
[27:24] made to be man
[27:27] that means there's something really
[27:28] important about this humanity
[27:30] something unique about the flesh
[27:33] in matthew chapter 19 verses 16 and 17
[27:37] it says and behold one came and said to
[27:39] him good master what good thing shall i
[27:41] do that i may have eternal life
[27:44] and he said unto him why call us thou me
[27:48] good
[27:49] there is none good but one
[27:52] that is god
[27:54] but if thou wilt enter into life keep
[27:56] the commandments
[27:58] he said there's none that is supremely
[28:00] good or essentially good but god
[28:03] we could read it this way and say
[28:05] that
[28:06] god is the only true good he is the only
[28:08] pure good
[28:10] there is none good
[28:12] but god god is the only good good master
[28:17] what can i do what good thing can i do
[28:18] to have eternal life he says why are you
[28:20] calling me good there's only one good
[28:21] but god
[28:22] i think that could open up a brilliant
[28:25] theological debate at that moment say
[28:26] what is he trying to say if he's calling
[28:28] him good and if he is in fact good then
[28:29] he must be god but he's saying there's
[28:31] only one good and that is god
[28:34] when he uses the word good it means of a
[28:36] good nature one that is useful pleasant
[28:38] happy excellent upright honorable
[28:40] there's only one
[28:42] this good and it's god
[28:45] and psalm 16 verse 2 this is
[28:48] this is a scripture that
[28:50] uh has been interpreted different ways
[28:52] it says oh my soul thou has said unto
[28:54] the lord thou art my god my goodness
[28:56] extendeth not to thee
[28:58] some translate it to mean that there's
[29:00] nothing good i can do for you there's
[29:01] nothing i can add to your glory but a
[29:03] lot of translations render it this way i
[29:05] have no good beside or beyond you
[29:08] oh my soul thou says unto the lord thou
[29:10] art my lord my goodness is not without
[29:13] you if there's any good it has come from
[29:15] you if there's any good in me it is
[29:17] because of you if there's good in my
[29:19] life oh lord it is you because i have
[29:22] nothing good beyond you i have nothing
[29:24] good beside you to say my goodness
[29:26] extenteth not to thee that there's
[29:28] nothing good except it came by your hand
[29:32] james chapter 1 verses 16 and 17
[29:35] it says do not air my beloved brethren
[29:38] every good gift and every perfect gift
[29:40] is from above
[29:42] and cometh down from the father of
[29:44] lights
[29:45] with whom is no variableness neither
[29:47] shadow of turning
[29:49] are you following these scriptures
[29:51] maybe i'm positing i say god is the good
[29:54] and that's my
[29:55] that's my title
[29:57] and then where i stepped into this is to
[30:00] look at god's declaration about man in
[30:02] genesis chapter 9 and what he says about
[30:05] man is man in his fallen state after the
[30:07] flood still
[30:09] is in the image of god
[30:11] that doesn't mean deity dwells in him uh
[30:14] in life and that his that zoe is in him
[30:16] and he has eternal life and he's a fully
[30:19] adopted son of god that's not the point
[30:21] i'm making saying that there's something
[30:22] in the creation
[30:24] something in the man
[30:25] that god still acknowledges that his
[30:28] image is in him
[30:30] and then brother branham goes so far as
[30:31] to say that there's something wonderful
[30:34] about the man he can create he can do
[30:36] these different things he can invent
[30:37] rather
[30:38] and there's something wonderful even in
[30:40] his fallen estate he he has some
[30:42] affinity with god
[30:45] and i want you to consider this that if
[30:47] they're a message believer or not a
[30:49] message believer if they're from india
[30:51] from new zealand from china or or from
[30:53] south america north america it doesn't
[30:54] matter they can even be canadian
[30:58] and there's and there can still be even
[31:01] an agnostic even an atheist there's
[31:03] still something about the person that
[31:05] god is interested in
[31:07] that god says he's interested in every
[31:09] human being because it's his creation
[31:11] he's interested in the whole human race
[31:13] and trying to get the human race to
[31:14] focus on the word of god so though evil
[31:17] resides and is resident in man because
[31:19] of the fall that man was originally made
[31:22] to be a god and god was made to become a
[31:24] man
[31:27] and so still in all of this as long as
[31:29] we're human there's something in us
[31:31] calling out for god
[31:34] something that
[31:35] if i if i could just i thought maybe
[31:38] cover it up and though it may not it may
[31:41] be misguided it gets perverted but
[31:42] there's some
[31:44] there's some inclination
[31:47] there there's some there's something in
[31:49] them that could acknowledge god
[31:51] but what does the scripture tell us they
[31:53] refuse that
[31:55] they refuse to believe that they refuse
[31:56] to consider that and that's the part
[31:58] that becomes deadened or becomes
[31:59] hardened
[32:02] and jesus says there's none good but god
[32:05] david said there's no good besides you
[32:08] james says every good gift and every
[32:10] perfect gift is from above and cometh
[32:12] down from the father of lights
[32:15] every good thing cometh from god
[32:18] every good thing now all right let's go
[32:20] ahead and just define good as those
[32:22] things that we can identify in the
[32:24] scripture and we can start narrowing it
[32:25] down but you say every good thing
[32:28] every good thing cometh from god
[32:31] and the message when their eyes were
[32:33] opened
[32:35] it says and so we know the great things
[32:37] are done
[32:39] in the hospitals and amongst doctors
[32:41] and so therefore we've got to recognize
[32:43] that to be of god
[32:46] because all good things come from god
[32:48] all good things
[32:51] are you able to read that
[32:53] i challenge you to go look it up and we
[32:56] could say well he just didn't know how
[32:57] far western medicine would go in 2022.
[33:00] all right i mean
[33:02] we can always debate that that brother
[33:03] branham just didn't know but he says
[33:04] we've got to recognize that to be of god
[33:07] because all good things from come from
[33:09] god all good things
[33:11] he said if there's these things that are
[33:12] done the great things that are done the
[33:14] positive things the things that benefit
[33:15] the things that bring life or bring
[33:18] um
[33:19] preserve life or deal with sicknesses
[33:21] and and treat certain ailments and mend
[33:23] things together he says these things
[33:25] that are done in hospitals by doctors
[33:26] we've got to recognize that to be of god
[33:29] he says because all good things from
[33:31] come from god all good things
[33:34] we believe that god is the source of all
[33:36] life
[33:38] we understand that god is the source of
[33:39] all intelligence he's the source of all
[33:41] honor he's the source of all wisdom
[33:45] and and and i'm wanting you to ponder
[33:46] the greatness of god and just how great
[33:48] he is and just how wonderful he is and
[33:51] how that we ought to never just narrow
[33:53] him down so and limit him so much to we
[33:56] miss out on seeing god everywhere that
[33:58] he is
[33:59] brother man says god is a creator
[34:02] god created everything all good things
[34:05] come from god
[34:06] and wrong things evil things are the
[34:08] right thing perverted
[34:12] do you see how brother brahms trying to
[34:13] place it
[34:16] there's evil in this world
[34:19] and evil is just the right thing
[34:20] perverted
[34:22] there had to be something good before
[34:23] there could be something evil
[34:26] that they're that the evil is the
[34:28] righteousness perverted the the the
[34:31] wickedness
[34:32] and the unrighteousness is the will of
[34:34] god detoured or violated or worked
[34:36] against and what what's the wrong thing
[34:38] well you don't know the wrong thing
[34:39] there's not a wrong thing unless there's
[34:40] a right thing
[34:42] have you ever heard that before when
[34:43] someone says well there's really not a
[34:44] wrong way to do it
[34:46] you ever heard that before
[34:48] it's nice to hear that sometimes you
[34:50] know there's not a wrong way to do it
[34:51] just means just get the job done as long
[34:52] as the job's completed but if there was
[34:54] a right way to do something then there's
[34:56] a wrong way
[34:59] and and this is this is just pondering
[35:00] this think about this maybe it's just
[35:02] provoking more thought for you brother
[35:04] bram says all good things come from god
[35:08] this scripture even says that as we read
[35:09] every good gift and every perfect gift
[35:11] is from above there's a lot of different
[35:13] translations that render it every good
[35:14] thing comes from god
[35:16] if there's some good if there's a good
[35:18] gift if there's a perfect gift where
[35:20] does it come from if there's a wisdom
[35:21] that presents itself peaceably and in
[35:23] righteousness where does that come from
[35:25] these things have to come from god
[35:28] i'll just i'll just say it
[35:30] ah
[35:31] and express it this way
[35:33] i i imagine every single person in here
[35:36] who's serving the lord who has the holy
[35:37] ghost can testify that god has spoken to
[35:40] you
[35:41] in many different ways and it's not
[35:43] always this traditional channel of a
[35:46] a middle-of-the-road message preacher
[35:48] speaking behind a pulpit
[35:50] right
[35:51] it doesn't always come that way
[35:53] sometimes it could be the person at work
[35:55] who's the farthest thing from a
[35:56] christian makes a statement and
[35:58] immediately in your heart you go that
[35:59] was the lord talking to me
[36:01] that was the lord the lord that was the
[36:02] lord and you have no doubt in your mind
[36:05] and you don't doubt it why because
[36:06] something resonates in your spirit says
[36:08] that's what i needed that was good
[36:10] that's appropriate and we don't have to
[36:12] wrestle we don't go to the bathroom i
[36:13] need to take a 15-minute break you don't
[36:15] smoke well i'm going to steam a little
[36:16] bit how in the world can that ignorant
[36:18] reprobate have a good thing to say
[36:20] no we just accept it
[36:23] and and we've listened to we've listened
[36:25] to christian programs on the radio and
[36:27] we hear something like
[36:28] that speaks to my heart
[36:30] that resonates with me have we not lived
[36:32] that haven't i heard that listen this is
[36:34] what i want you to catch when that
[36:36] happens that's god
[36:38] that doesn't mean the person is god that
[36:40] means god is mindful of you and is
[36:43] willing to speak to you through whatever
[36:44] channel he needs to to get your
[36:46] attention and god will use whatever he
[36:49] needs to to get his good out
[36:52] that if god's gonna use the radio he's
[36:54] gonna use the neighbor next door in the
[36:55] apartment next to us or whatever then i
[36:57] say god use me too
[37:00] oh god is it is have we come to the
[37:02] place now where good has to come from
[37:04] the rocks because we're not crying out
[37:06] enough
[37:10] we're losing our voice
[37:12] because we got negative we get cynical
[37:15] and and and we just kind of are huddling
[37:17] ourselves up
[37:18] and we're not open to be used of god
[37:22] there's an attitude anymore that if
[37:24] something happens
[37:26] uh where
[37:28] even somebody testifies and says oh did
[37:30] you hear about this person
[37:32] given a testimony
[37:34] and they said they went to the
[37:35] such-and-such church and they got prayed
[37:36] for and they were healed and the doctors
[37:38] they have x-rays to prove it
[37:41] and i've heard that testified before
[37:43] maybe an athlete getting healed and
[37:44] somebody else getting healed and i've
[37:45] heard message believers say oh that's
[37:47] not true
[37:48] i go wait why not
[37:51] why isn't it true well that that
[37:53] person's a sinner and they haven't done
[37:54] this and i said no no no what we're
[37:56] talking about is they were sick they had
[37:59] cancer they got prayed for the cancer is
[38:01] gone who does that
[38:03] it's not benny hinn
[38:05] no it's not deion sanders
[38:07] who does that god does that
[38:10] so i'm not trying to put my faith in the
[38:12] man that's healed i'm not trying to put
[38:13] my faith in the man that did the praying
[38:15] i say that's my god and i can rejoice
[38:18] with anybody who lifts up the nature and
[38:20] the character of my god and i don't have
[38:22] to fight against it
[38:25] because truth only vindicates god
[38:28] signing what signs and wonders aren't
[38:29] meant to just to vindicate ministries
[38:32] alone and vindicate a person it
[38:34] vindicates god it vindicates his truth
[38:37] brother brandon even asked the question
[38:39] do you believe god is in all inspiration
[38:44] the congregation answered yes they must
[38:46] have they must have felt like
[38:48] i think he's saying yes but he just
[38:50] asked the question do you believe god is
[38:52] in all inspiration
[38:53] he said god has to write a song do you
[38:55] believe god is in songs
[38:58] it's a question he's asking
[39:00] do you know god heals by music
[39:04] god heals by love
[39:06] god heals by medicine
[39:08] god heals by surgery
[39:09] god heals my understanding
[39:12] god heals my care these are all ways
[39:14] that god heals
[39:16] so
[39:18] someone can care
[39:20] and god could heal by that
[39:22] someone can understand and god can heal
[39:24] by that someone can perform a surgery
[39:26] and god can heal by that
[39:28] uh
[39:29] god someone can
[39:31] music can heal
[39:33] but these are all just statements from
[39:34] brother bam god heals by music by love
[39:36] by medicine by surgery by understanding
[39:37] by care this is this is things that god
[39:39] does
[39:43] because god is the good
[39:45] there's any good it comes from god
[39:48] that's what i'm wanting to emphasize if
[39:49] you see something good
[39:51] god is the good
[39:54] wherever you see it wherever you
[39:55] experience it wherever you feel it if it
[39:57] comes your way and you recognize it
[39:58] thank god for it
[40:00] be happy to see it
[40:03] and this sermon jehovah jireh
[40:08] and it's a little bit of a lengthy
[40:10] lengthy statement but i'm going to
[40:12] i want to read through it
[40:14] and just bringing this to a close he
[40:16] says anyone knows that no man can heal
[40:18] another
[40:19] and just prior to this he's
[40:21] he's making a statement how that you
[40:22] know some people the critic
[40:24] critic will call a man a healer oh he's
[40:26] a divine healer he says the critics will
[40:27] say that why because no man is a divine
[40:29] healer
[40:32] he says anyone knows that no man can
[40:33] heal another god heals the sickness
[40:37] now he he uses some very
[40:39] uh profound
[40:42] i would say reasoning with arguments
[40:44] here
[40:46] to support what he's saying very
[40:47] profound and i want you to focus very
[40:49] deliberately
[40:50] at this pace i'm going to be closing
[40:54] uh
[40:55] under an hour so i think that's a pretty
[40:56] good pretty good pace for me
[40:59] and so you could focus now and
[41:00] concentrate pull hard i sometimes say
[41:02] the harder you pull the faster i preach
[41:05] but if you pull too hard the more i
[41:06] preach maybe
[41:08] i don't know i don't i haven't figured
[41:09] it out yet i'm sure you could tell by
[41:11] now
[41:12] he says god heals the sickness he says
[41:15] let god call for your death and pray all
[41:18] you want to and the hospital will give
[41:19] you an injection of fluid every day and
[41:20] you'll die just the same
[41:24] you let god call for your death and see
[41:26] if man can stop it
[41:28] if i cut my hand tonight and stand here
[41:30] with the cut hand and there isn't a
[41:32] medicine the world can heal my hand we
[41:34] ain't got a medicine that heals sorry
[41:36] for all your melaleuca salesmen it says
[41:38] no medicine heals
[41:40] any doctor will tell you that it just
[41:42] keeps clean why god heals
[41:44] it can't build tissue if i cut my hand
[41:47] and oh you say yes brother branham
[41:49] there's a medicine to heal that all
[41:50] right
[41:51] i want to know what it is
[41:53] he says let me show you
[41:55] if i cut my hand and fell down dead here
[41:58] a doctor could come and embalm my body
[42:00] make me look natural for 50 years sew up
[42:02] my hand and take me out there and give
[42:03] me a shot of penicillin every day and in
[42:06] 50 years from now that cut would be just
[42:08] like it was when it was made
[42:10] now that's very sharp isn't it
[42:12] i this is this is kind of taking a step
[42:15] back and instead of debating the merits
[42:17] of the actual medicine and what it does
[42:18] and say what you see here is what this
[42:20] medicine will do is this and what this
[42:22] procedure do is do that he's saying all
[42:24] right let's do it on a dead body and see
[42:25] what happens
[42:27] so what what is what these things are
[42:29] doing is they're working together with
[42:31] the body's natural process it's working
[42:33] together with something that's already
[42:34] there has something to work with he said
[42:36] if i cut my hand open and then died a
[42:39] doctor can do all sorts of stuff to it
[42:41] the cut's still going to be there
[42:45] if medicine was made to heal a cut why
[42:46] don't it heal it
[42:48] if it's a cut right
[42:50] that's a dead body but put the medicine
[42:51] out watch it he says any medicine will
[42:53] heal a cut in my hand i thought this was
[42:55] very interesting well he'll cut in this
[42:56] desk
[42:58] would heal a cut in my coat
[43:01] and this is this is this is really good
[43:03] to get someone thinking i'm pondering
[43:05] this well yes if it's the medicine that
[43:07] heals the cut then why can't i just put
[43:09] that medicine
[43:10] on a rip in my pants
[43:14] and it just it mend right back up he
[43:16] says if it would heal a cut it'll heal a
[43:18] cut no matter where it's at
[43:20] well you say why medicine is made for
[43:21] human beings then why don't it heal
[43:25] well you say the life has got out of you
[43:29] so that's coming back to the argument
[43:30] well why didn't the cut heal my body if
[43:32] i had a cut and i died and they did all
[43:34] this they said well you didn't have any
[43:35] life in you was brother man identifying
[43:36] he says then there's something else
[43:38] beside the medicine that heals
[43:41] something else beside the medicine heals
[43:44] it's life sure and life is god
[43:48] certainly it is yet some are sinners
[43:52] are perverted with it but yet you're in
[43:54] the image of god
[43:56] it says and the life that you have that
[43:58] god that god gave it to you you know
[44:01] that
[44:02] because god is the healer life is he
[44:05] says no and i think he's referring back
[44:06] to what heals he says god is the healer
[44:09] life
[44:10] is the healer
[44:13] do you see the picture that brother
[44:14] abraham has just
[44:15] caused us to consider
[44:17] that he says
[44:18] if if man is the healer
[44:20] then if god calls for your life there's
[44:22] nothing man can do to stop it
[44:25] so he recognizes god as being the one
[44:27] that's overall thing he he has the
[44:28] providence over mankind he's directing
[44:30] our affairs but now even when it comes
[44:32] to the human body god is the creator the
[44:34] maker of the human body and he's made it
[44:36] a certain way that as long as it has
[44:38] life in it there's things that can aid
[44:41] in the healing process but once that
[44:44] life is gone the body cannot heal itself
[44:48] and he's identifying i said look then if
[44:51] it's medicine if it's science if it's
[44:53] humanity if it's this doctor this
[44:55] procedure or this chemical or this
[44:57] approach he says then it would work on
[44:59] anything
[45:01] but he's saying it's got to be what god
[45:03] placed in there it's working together
[45:04] with something he says there's something
[45:06] else beside the medicine that heals it's
[45:08] life and life is god even for a sinner
[45:11] perverted in this life yet they're still
[45:13] in the image of god he says god is the
[45:15] healer life is the healer
[45:19] that ought to encourage every single
[45:20] person in here who's got a pain or an
[45:21] ache or sickness
[45:23] as long as you've got breath you're in
[45:25] the line of healing
[45:27] as long as you've got breath life is the
[45:29] healer as long as you've got breath you
[45:30] can say god i got breath lord lord use
[45:33] one is that your disposal father
[45:37] he says life is the healer
[45:42] i mean clothes are just summing up my my
[45:45] thoughts
[45:48] there are still brother i'm saying it
[45:49] there's there's
[45:50] even sinners perverted yet they're in
[45:52] the image of god
[45:55] there's still a
[45:57] a part of god an image of god that's
[45:59] present in mankind
[46:02] they're still
[46:04] they're still i wan i'm careful with the
[46:06] words i choose
[46:08] but something that's been
[46:10] imprinted by god's divine nature
[46:14] it's not the divine nature
[46:16] it's not god himself necessarily
[46:19] but it's something that shook mankind
[46:23] it's some impulse and some imprint
[46:26] something the fingerprints of god some
[46:27] way that he made man that even though
[46:29] he's become holy evil and he's lost his
[46:32] thoughts
[46:33] and he pursues the wrong things and he's
[46:35] motivated by the wrong things it's
[46:36] almost as if there's still some shadow
[46:39] in his spirit
[46:41] that there's still some good that lurks
[46:43] there in the dna there's still something
[46:44] in the base nature of man despite its
[46:47] evilness and despite its depravity and
[46:49] despite how dark his soul has become
[46:51] there's still something in there
[46:54] that brother branham says thirst for god
[46:57] there's still something in there that
[46:59] was made by god
[47:01] there's still something in there that
[47:02] god can use
[47:04] and so the thought god is the good if
[47:07] you see something good know that it had
[47:09] to come from god
[47:10] no matter where you see it no matter how
[47:12] it presents itself if you know something
[47:14] is good then you know that god is the
[47:17] good that's in humanity if if some
[47:19] sinner or some person
[47:22] you know nothing of their testimony no
[47:23] nothing of their situation if they do
[47:25] something good if they do something
[47:27] right god is the good
[47:30] but that can only be because god made
[47:32] man in his image in the beginning and
[47:34] that satan wasn't his designer and that
[47:36] satan didn't create humanity if if
[47:38] there's some glimpse of good if there's
[47:40] some glimpse of rightness if there's
[47:41] some cleanse of passion if there's some
[47:43] glimpse of integrity if there's some
[47:45] glimpse of honesty that had to come from
[47:47] god
[47:49] and i say don't resent good in whatever
[47:51] fashion it's expressed in
[47:54] regardless of something's belief or or
[47:56] their theology
[47:58] can we appreciate good
[48:01] when you see good when you see goodness
[48:03] when you see humility when you see
[48:04] service when you see a sacrifice
[48:06] you're seeing the attributes of god
[48:09] when you see selfishness and hatred and
[48:11] jealousy
[48:12] and wickedness and fornication and
[48:14] murder
[48:15] and lying and backbiting and stealing
[48:17] and all those things what is that's evil
[48:18] that's the devil that's the world
[48:23] but if there's good that's god
[48:27] because god is the good
[48:30] i encourage you don't be cynical
[48:34] don't only see the bad
[48:37] have you noticed
[48:39] and maybe only you could i can only
[48:40] relate to this and how i've seen it
[48:42] maybe there's a way that this is
[48:43] applicable but not the same way it is to
[48:44] me but i feel as if we are suffering
[48:47] from constant waves of sensationalism
[48:51] and and there's
[48:53] these waves of sensationalism that
[48:55] that ride on the the momentum of the day
[48:59] and
[49:00] and all of a sudden something happens
[49:03] and we get flooded with certain
[49:04] sentiments
[49:06] and everything everybody's picking up on
[49:08] this look at this look at this look at
[49:09] this and everything gets really really
[49:10] sensationalized and then all of a sudden
[49:12] it kind of goes away
[49:14] and what do we do we ride the next wave
[49:15] of sensationalism
[49:16] right at one time covet 19 was going to
[49:19] be what spurred the rapture right
[49:21] it was going to be a pandemic but now
[49:23] it's russia
[49:25] i'm sorry it's not the pandemic it's
[49:27] world war iii and we just we ride it's
[49:30] sensationalism
[49:31] and we just keep riding these waves and
[49:33] maybe we can keep going back and back
[49:35] and back and god's saying look as long
[49:37] as you're surfing you're never going to
[49:38] get out of here
[49:40] and he's just waiting for us to get off
[49:41] our boards start right stop riding the
[49:43] waves of sensationalism and just get in
[49:45] his channel and the upward momentum of
[49:47] the world and say wow look what's
[49:49] happening wow look what's happening but
[49:51] i'm staying in the channel i'm going to
[49:53] i'm going to ride through i'm not
[49:54] surfing them i'm questioning them i'm
[49:56] going against that
[49:58] if the world is crashing this way if
[50:00] sensationalism is going this way i want
[50:02] to ride across those waves i'm not going
[50:05] with the current of this world
[50:08] there's so many waves of sensationalism
[50:09] and there's so much pessimism
[50:13] fellowshipping with the brother and it's
[50:15] remarkable
[50:17] how that
[50:18] we don't trust the news
[50:20] so there's a maybe a healthy skepticism
[50:23] of the news
[50:24] and and we're and we're willing to
[50:25] believe
[50:27] anything that
[50:29] uh erodes the
[50:31] integrity or the truthfulness of the
[50:33] news but what happens now
[50:36] is we fall for
[50:37] lies about the news because it fits our
[50:40] paradigm
[50:43] and and what happens we're getting
[50:44] caught up
[50:45] and the pessimism
[50:47] oh can you believe this can you believe
[50:49] that can you believe this can you
[50:50] believe that can you believe they just
[50:52] believe that
[50:53] and and it's like well
[50:55] i don't know every everything you're
[50:57] quoting are things that's not an
[50:58] absolute to me everything you're talking
[50:59] about i don't know i i have no certainty
[51:02] in that let's talk about things we know
[51:09] so many things these waves of
[51:10] sensationalism these
[51:12] waves of pessimism it's trying to force
[51:14] on us a negative view
[51:17] a doubtful view
[51:19] where we go we go from the pandemic's
[51:22] going to be the end of the world world
[51:23] war three is going to be in the world
[51:24] all right what's next right
[51:27] any anybody else think that maybe this
[51:29] is just going to go away and there'll be
[51:30] something else
[51:31] covered 2022
[51:33] i don't know
[51:34] gonna be something right that it'll be
[51:36] the the economy
[51:38] we'll figure all about the war in
[51:40] eastern europe and it'll be about the
[51:41] economy
[51:42] and then we'll be getting dozens of
[51:44] economy quotes
[51:45] right
[51:47] trying to explain where we are what's
[51:49] going on and how to view the world and
[51:51] what's happening i'm like man i thought
[51:53] for sure it was the vice president in a
[51:54] purple dress
[51:56] i thought for sure
[51:58] that was it and we'd all be gone but it
[52:00] wasn't was it
[52:02] because that's not what brings you
[52:03] perfect faith
[52:06] it's not what brings you rapturing faith
[52:09] and that message the junction of time
[52:14] i would i'm going to keep our musicians
[52:16] seated but just to create the
[52:18] expectation of a close typically at this
[52:19] moment i'd be calling them up
[52:22] but i just want everyone to be still in
[52:23] here this last statement and the message
[52:24] the junction of time
[52:26] how the great turmoil is in the world
[52:28] today
[52:30] and we realized one thing that caused
[52:31] that the bible said that the spirits
[52:33] great spirits come down evil spirits and
[52:35] got into these people and done these
[52:36] things
[52:37] and we see the same evil spirits working
[52:40] in our day
[52:41] amen
[52:42] both democrats and republicans can agree
[52:44] right evil spirits working in our day
[52:46] they might point fingers at each other
[52:48] but let's just agree as believers evil
[52:50] spirits working in our day
[52:53] we got a lot of suspicions and
[52:54] skepticism and and we could probably
[52:56] start to identify where all these evil
[52:58] spirits are working especially in sleepy
[53:00] joe and all these other places i know i
[53:03] know this is where it's at right i know
[53:05] this is where the evil spirits are
[53:06] working all right now notice again that
[53:09] not only that
[53:11] when all hell turns loose all heaven
[53:14] turns loose also
[53:16] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[53:18] spirit of god raises up a standard
[53:20] against it and these two forces have
[53:22] always showed at the junction
[53:24] well if all hell is broke loose and the
[53:26] biden administration then i want to
[53:28] start talking about the heaven that was
[53:30] let loose at the same time
[53:33] if there's a hell getting loose there's
[53:34] got to be a heaven getting loose and i
[53:36] want to stop talking about the hell and
[53:39] start talking about the heavens
[53:43] because it has to be
[53:46] if there's a if there's a
[53:48] physical pandemic
[53:50] and a plague upon the flesh then there
[53:52] must be a spiritual infusion of
[53:55] rapturing faith that's transfined in the
[53:57] word of god if there's something
[53:58] bringing people to a grave then there's
[54:00] got to be something bringing a bride to
[54:02] a rapture if there's a war taking place
[54:05] in eastern europe that's bringing down
[54:07] lies there's got to be a greatest battle
[54:09] ever fought that the word is going to
[54:11] wage right now in my spirit
[54:14] that's what i want to start looking for
[54:15] is the good
[54:17] god bless you let's stand tonight
[54:20] god is the good
[54:22] and i'm going to start looking for them
[54:26] i want to start seeing the good talking
[54:28] about the good fellowshipping on the
[54:29] good
[54:31] i realize
[54:33] it's easy
[54:35] would you agree brother loyal it's easy
[54:36] to talk about the things of the day
[54:39] easy to talk about vaccines and
[54:42] wars and
[54:43] uh political decisions and the prices of
[54:46] gas
[54:47] brother donnie reagan said a text
[54:49] message and he said
[54:51] good news
[54:53] we're closing this friday we got we got
[54:55] approved for the loan we're closing this
[54:57] friday on a tank of gas
[55:01] it's like wow that's just about that's
[55:02] just about right
[55:04] and it's easy to talk about those things
[55:06] but just remember
[55:08] when all hell turns loose
[55:10] heaven turns loose also
[55:12] then make that very personal have you
[55:14] ever felt like all hell turned loose in
[55:15] your life
[55:17] everything's chaotic everything's out of
[55:18] control then god must be near
[55:21] right brother jared it seems like
[55:23] everything's going absolutely crazy in
[55:24] bonkers even in that moment you can say
[55:26] wait a minute god must be near
[55:29] because hell won't turn loose and left
[55:30] heaven's going to turn loose also
[55:32] that's where we want to put our eyes
[55:34] amen heavenly father tonight as we close
[55:36] this service
[55:38] we want to keep our eyes on you we want
[55:40] to trust in you
[55:42] and we realize that the devil brother
[55:44] loyal mentioned it recently the devil's
[55:45] a great salesman
[55:47] and he has sold us on so many facts and
[55:49] figures and beliefs and ideas and
[55:52] paradigms
[55:54] even allowed certain ones to compete
[55:56] against each other
[55:58] this is the devil slick lord i think
[56:01] about it right now
[56:03] but
[56:04] he has his people pretending to fight so
[56:07] that we'll take a side
[56:11] and we need to just take a step back and
[56:12] say all hell's turned loose
[56:14] heaven where are you
[56:17] and pray for heaven to come down pray
[56:19] for heaven and press itself
[56:21] pray to see the good to see the positive
[56:23] to understand what it means
[56:26] lord even with current events and global
[56:27] events that are taking place we know
[56:29] that it's only going to work to further
[56:31] your purpose
[56:33] and that whatever happens we have a
[56:35] promise that all things work together
[56:37] for our good
[56:42] and lord i realize there's believers
[56:43] suffering right now in eastern europe
[56:47] and i i reached out to a brother there
[56:49] lord and just was so
[56:51] i
[56:52] just wanted to encourage them because
[56:54] father
[56:55] in my heart i believe they're fulfilling
[56:58] a part of this bride's perfect faith
[57:00] for their crisis their moment what
[57:02] they're going through
[57:05] we do have a responsibility to pray for
[57:07] them we have
[57:08] a desire and a responsibility to see if
[57:10] there is some way that we can meet their
[57:11] needs
[57:13] but lord i
[57:15] believe that we should
[57:16] view it not through the lens of
[57:17] sensationalism
[57:20] not through a political lens
[57:22] but through the lens of oh lord let
[57:24] heaven loose
[57:26] oh god let your spirit move
[57:29] lord may this bring a desperation in
[57:31] believers hearts lord may you preserve
[57:33] life may you begin to work things out in
[57:35] such a way to where it promotes
[57:38] an absolute confidence and dependence
[57:40] upon your word
[57:43] and lord i pray tonight that as a church
[57:45] if there be any cynical nature may the
[57:48] word of god address it
[57:50] if there be any pessimistic instinct
[57:54] if there be any cycles of cynicism lord
[57:56] what if there's things exist in our
[57:58] heart we're just quickly resort to the
[57:59] negative for contrarians by
[58:02] by reflex lord change that in us
[58:05] change that
[58:08] may
[58:09] that change be rooted in an absolute
[58:12] confidence in our calling that
[58:14] regardless of how good somebody else is
[58:16] it's never a threat to who we are
[58:18] [Music]
[58:20] somebody else is good somebody else's
[58:21] sincerity somebody else's testimony
[58:23] somebody else's work somebody else's
[58:25] move of god or power of god and somewhat
[58:27] something else that is that that is a
[58:30] true genuine outpouring of the holy
[58:32] spirit lord may we be so confident in
[58:34] who we are and what we called this do
[58:35] that we don't instinctively try to find
[58:37] something wrong with it just to make
[58:39] ourselves fear feel better
[58:42] but lord may we rejoice in all your
[58:44] goodness may we rejoice in your healings
[58:46] may we rejoice in your manifestations of
[58:49] gifts may we rejoice in however you
[58:51] would choose to move among the sons of
[58:53] men
[58:55] knowing that there's
[58:57] healing in this word for many there's
[59:00] deliverance in this word for all who
[59:02] could receive it
[59:04] and i would lord that many would benefit
[59:06] from this message
[59:09] i believe it's the best way to live
[59:12] and though man has made it into
[59:14] something that it's not there's still a
[59:16] life that's in it
[59:18] and it's virtuous and it's clean and
[59:21] it's pure
[59:23] and i would that anyone who could
[59:26] hear it
[59:28] and receive it could benefit from it
[59:30] lord
[59:32] bless us tonight as we're soon dismissed
[59:34] bless your people we pray in the name of
[59:36] the lord jesus christ amen
