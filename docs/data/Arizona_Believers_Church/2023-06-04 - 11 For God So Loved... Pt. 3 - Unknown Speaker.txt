TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'd like to say it the outset I really feel impressed in my heart this morning about the subject matter these Services have kind of been building together they all kind of Link together we maybe don't spend a lot of time trying to weave it together so that you see Parts one through eleven all tying together perfectly but I believe that there's just principles that have been building and I've sensed in my heart just a real pressure for this morning service I feel it's an important service several things have happened to indicate to me um just to that from even myself I need to be very focused and intentional today of yielding and getting myself out of the way so that God could speak to our hearts trust that you could do the same and pull on the gift as we look at this subject we're looking at for God so loved and then we know the preceding phrase we've really been looking at the world and we're at this particular part and looking at for God so loved just to examine some of these principles to give us a better understanding of the perfect love that's being revealed to the bride in the time that we're living in now and I'd like this service to serve as a foundation for next Sunday if the Lord does not tarry that meeting in the air no problem no problem at all I don't mind but if we're still here for next Sunday I want this to serve as foundation for God's covenant of perfect love he's made this Covenant in perfect love now in verse 16 here's we just read it for God so loved the world that he gave and so we realized that God is the lover and the world is the love Agape or charity love or perfect love is what he has for the loved and in this we realize that when someone is the lover there the giver and the loved are the receivers so we should look at that in our own lives that when we love someone we must be giving if we are loved then we must be receiving and maybe that's where sometimes the difficulty lies is in giving or receiving maybe we don't want to take it in just the way that it's being given or sometimes we don't recognize what's being given but we know that God is a lover and we are of beloved and therefore God is giving to us and we are receiving and there's this is an important principle that I'm just going to read the statement verbatim as brother Branham said it and then maybe you going in you could recognize these things in your own listening to the message of the hour it says when Divine love is projected to its object Sovereign Grace steps in and produces what is projected and so with with with love God's elective love has an elected object which is you and then a predestinated objective and brother Brandon says when Divine love is projected to you Sovereign Grace and I say to you but he's talking about just even an object Sovereign Grace steps in and produces what is projected so it produces Divine love it produces these attributes of God and so it's important that when Divine love this perfect love is being manifested when it's being projected it's to have an impact on the love it's have an impact on the very thing it's being projected to to engrave steps in and produces what is projected and so in this phrase for God so loved the world I've been saying that it holds this beautiful mystery of God's Eternal desire it's it speaks of for God's so loved it's related with what he's purposed within himself before the world began and after his good pleasure this is this comes to the very heart of God and not just go God happening on something oh I think I like that I'll have that but this is something very Central to God and the term the world we've already recognized that there are different worlds as the world of the ungodly there's a world that's condemned there's a world that's saved and the term World there can be used of a collection of any sort it can be used of mankind it could be used as the earth and its systems but the word word world is used of anything that has its own harmonious Arrangement and so this is and I'm sure you've used that term before that in the World of Sports or in the world of programming in the world of this in other words it has its own processes and its own hierarchies or rules and systems and so a world is an arrangement an order or a government the word world is translated to adorning so this is the adorning the ornament the arrangement that God loves that is beautiful in his sight and in the sermon God's power to transform this world we identified the world in the beginning that's the world that God loved his order his arrangement his Harmony in the Garden of Eden was God's economy of innocence and that was one of the dispensations the first dispensation was innocence so this is God's economy and when God has an economy it's innocent when God has his dispensation or he has a purpose that he's arranging things this is his distinctive Arrangement this is his system this is his order and this is the world that he loved this is an image these are the seeds of the world that he loved and as we could look into Genesis chapter 3 if you want to turn there now verses 14 to 16. we should have a a light that goes on in the back you know how like Krispy Kreme has hot and fresh or Little Caesar says hot and ready there should be a sign back there at the back that blinks and it says slow down take a deep breath breathe I was so excited I didn't sleep all night and if I'm not careful I'll just won't even take a breath as I go so I'm trying to pause here a little bit but if you look at Genesis chapter 3 verses 14 uh we're going to be reading all the way to verse 21 as we walk through this but when we read of the curse and and the details of this narrative from God or the conversation that God has or the direct comments he has to the actors here this was the closing of God's economy of Innocence this was a change of dispensation we saw the dispensation is God's ordering of Affairs and systems and God's Arrangement things to accomplish his objective and so as much as this is the Paradox God arrange thing and things in a particular way in the beginning and put man and the woman on the basis that they would fall to accomplish his purpose so when Satan did that which was necessary to fulfill God's purpose dispensation changed but there was an image left there was an image expressed in that original in the beginning that God is forecasting and trying to show us and we've looked at that in great detail over the last few years of what that looked like but now as the the curse has come in and he begins to speak to Adam and the woman this is the closing of in the beginning or that Eternal world that God loved there was eternity in the beginning at the at the end onset of sin time and death begins to settle in and move in and then there's this transition into the Fallen world that we know and that ends the beginning in the sermon marriage and divorce brother Graham says two covenants he reads Genesis 3 16 he says two covenants now that closes the beginning and it's so easy to skip over this I'm not sure if it's this morning that I have a number of statements for marriage and divorce and you say how do you forget it's because there's so much that we've breaking this up into but I'll say this now and I'll probably repeat it later maybe even this morning the sermon marriage and divorce may be one of the most misunderstood and misused sermons in the message and use for people's own selfless reasons I used to support their own agendas and maybe we'll get into that more detail on Wednesday night when we preach on Love and Hate but there's uh I want you to recognize this tremendous principle that brother bam identifies in this now that closes the beginning so there is a beginning way that God arranged things and then when that closes the beginning then that's not God's original way he says that closes the beginning of what Jesus says it wasn't so in at the beginning it says we got another Covenant now notice it's another Covenant so with the introduction of the second Covenant there's a different order arrangement government contract or different world that now begins to rise up or begins to come into come into seed form and grow so there's a something else instituted a covenant refers to an arrangement or a law or an agreement so when there's another Covenant now humanity is operating under a different order in a different dispensation and this is what I want you to recognize now and I this is going to expand maybe through the next few Services God institutes this second Covenant be in anticipation of the darkness of the Fallen nature of man that it's in anticipation he knows what the original sin is he knows that there's going to be a holy image that leaves Adam and the woman he knows that there's going to be a corrupting nature that comes in and begins to defile Mankind and so there's a degrading of humanity that's going to take place and so God knows he has to Institute another order in order to govern govern that nature do you follow that so now if you as you look at verse 14 I want to start reading through this and I want to call this the curse and the consequences and in the curse and the consequences God identifies or or reveals in doing this it's kind of like invert always invert or recognize now God's attitude towards what's coming up and how the second Covenant is anticipating change anticipating a different nature that it kind of shows us that God's response declares the value he had for his original economy let's recognize it's the very things that he says but it reveals what was in his heart in the beginning when he begins to speak so in Genesis chapter 3 verse 14 it says in the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life I want you to recognize all right I know that you recognize this I want you to look at this what you recognize and let's when we imagine the consequence and we recognize an upright Beast that could speak that could talk that could be articulate who actually had the ability an affinity with mankind enough to where he would have been able to communicate and then we know also to have Offspring uh through that Affinity with human nature so very very close to the man and it says when he's cursed he is going to change form and now he's going to be on his belly shall he go all the days of his life and he's going to eat dust so recognize that in the very literal changing of his form there's a change of form and a change of nature which brings the serpent from upright and articulate and intelligent to now he's going downward in nature and his whole form changes his physical form his nature changes downward and so now recognize the form in nature is changing and how God is signaling dust now and now you're going down and then in verse 15. this nature is going to have and I'm just going to skip over but in verse reading it but in this enmity that's going to be placed this nature will have hostility and hatred towards the woman and and when it speaks to the woman there's going to be this hatred and hostility towards that nature which the woman coming from man it's that pure Nature's God intended in the beginning and it says and her seed or the seed of the woman so is this nature changes form and it goes down whatever whatever was left before it changed that nature that's now been sown into Humanity it's going to have enmity and hatred towards uh the seat of the woman so now the woman when it says I'll have enmity you'll have enmity hatred and hostility towards the woman that is there's a number of ways we could look at this but we could say this nature the woman is the as God originally intended her to be so whatever corrupting influence the serpent has upon Humanity it's going to be against how God intended the woman to originally be and then the woman seed we know that's Jesus Christ that's the Redeemer he's the seed of Genesis 3 15. Genesis 3 16 is the manifestation of that so now when he speaks to the woman now verse 16. are we going slow enough for you we might just be able to have communion at the end of this service at four o'clock under the woman he said now he has said unto the serpent cursed are you above volcano he says unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception those are uh this conception and birth are very important elements to recognize here is it identifies the woman I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now remember we're reading this so that we can understand how that when the God's first economy of Innocence closed and God institutes a New Covenant it's telling us how precious and wonderful that original world was and this is the world that God loves and he wants to redeem which Genesis 3 15 speaks of John 3 16 which is God so loved the world now as he speaks to the woman I want you to recognize the consequence it changes the woman's nurture and relationship the nurture is the process of caring for and encouraging the growth or development of something and it says that I'm going to multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and then it says and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so he it's it's it's looking at the woman's nurture and how she's how she's expressing herself and what she's having to deal with because it says in pain and hurt and toil and hardship and offense it's this it comes from that sarcos from the pain and grieving actually is maybe translated to torture in some translations it's a vaccine that God's going to have to deal with or that the woman is going to have to deal with and so as God is identifying uh this different kind of nurture that she's going to have to experience and a change in relationship he identifies these specific areas of consequence for the woman it's important to recognize this if when I say it's important at least for me to be able to get my point across and it is in this relationship to her husband conception birth and I would say even rearing children that now there is this particular responsibility and burdened that the woman is going to be taking on to where her relationship to her husband the change in that is identified and then her conception is in sorrow the delivery is sorrowful but then and maybe don't amen too loud because some your children are here for some of you but then also the the toil and the trouble in rearing that this responsibility is going to come upon the woman and so God is specifically identifying areas of consequence then in verse 17 so now the serpent has been cursed God speaks to the woman God speaks to the man and unto Adam he said because that was hearken under the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded these saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and that would be translated in some translations curses the ground because of you in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and thistle shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for Dost thou art and unto dust shout thou return I think that kind of speaks in a way where we could just refer refer back to that so it says cursed is the ground for thy sake and I want to say this not only because of you but instead of you the Earth that was which which man was made for over which he had possession and Dominion God made him Dominic King over the Earth God over the Earth this Earth that you came from that I gave you an affinity too by bringing your body out from the earth and dust you came from he says now that body is going to have to return back before the fall it never would have had to you'd have remained a greater than it and and maintained a kinsmanship to it as it's uh as having come from it your body and you would have been ruler in Dominion the very thing that man came from and the very thing that he had possession and dominion over it is now uh you're going to return to it and it's cursed and so if you read it you realize Earth's Nature has changed it's going to the the life that it brings forth is changed man is going to struggle with that nature and God is showing by these consequence that nature and nerd is perverted now it's going to manifest in the earth it's going to manifest in the woman it's going to manifest in in man's struggle and what he's relating to everything is changing now in these consequences God is showing that there's going to be perverted nature what is it doing it's it's going down it's trending down as it says as it speaks into the Bible when it speaks of Satan and Lucifer that did US weaken the nations in other words you're weak in humanity you degraded humanely by mongrelizing the blood and so now the Earthly mind or the carnal mind will not be pure but now it's going to mix be mixed with evil it's going to be prone to perversion it's going to be against God As Romans chapter 8 verses 6 to 8 say the carnal mind is enmity against God says it's death to be Carly minded but spiritually minded is life and peace that that was what Adam and the woman had before the fall but now the carnal mind is mixed it has fear and it has other emotions it's enmity against God cannot be subject to the law of God and we're not just saying the laws God gave it to Moses but God's law because it's a now it's under a different economy it says they that are in the flesh cannot please God now recognize this as we read it already I think it's obvious on its face in Genesis 3 17 as we read on Adam is not cursed brother Branham reads these verses and a marriage and divorce he says he points out look Adam's not cursed the ground is and so it's important to note what God directly curses in other words no what is a curse and what is a consequence because there's direct curses but then there's consequences from that curse and so in the sermon of the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride and that's that's the sermon itself because you've got Heavenly bridegroom Earthly bride there's something God's trying to show us he says God didn't curse Adam he might have done the same thing but he cursed the Earth thorns and thistles so brother Brown is deliberate God didn't curse Adam he could have but he didn't he cursed the earth now it's going to Bear thorns and thistles now in that we do see an image of how that the flesh is going to be bearing thorns and thistles and the flesh is going to have things mixed in it that don't produce the right fruits but this what God is portraying here in that he cursed The Serpent and the Earth and between between these curses here stands the man and the woman and this image is a beautiful picture of God's love because recognize that God doesn't curse Adam but he curses the Earth but in Genesis 3 15 he foreshadows that the curse that could have come upon Adam because brother bam says he might have done the same thing the curse could have that could have come upon Adam because it says the serpent who's going to be eating dust and there's a dust eater and that even represents how our flesh is being eaten by this and our flesh dies and man will go to the ground and Satan has a right to this body because of sin and it's going to mean man's going to die and it speaks how it's going to bruise the heel of the seed of the woman it shows that that curse bites Genesis 3 15. and where God could have cursed Adam and cursed him directly Genesis 3 15 foreshadows that curse that could have come upon Adam and Paul picks it up in Galatians 3 13 and says Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree drawn from Deuteronomy 21 23 how those that were executed were shamed before the people and hung up as as emblems of God's judgment and a shame as judgment under the law so notice that the seed of the woman in Genesis 3 15 he becomes a curse Adam is not cursed God takes that curse and he binds it into a promise that I will satisfy the curse that could have come upon you Adam and I'm going to satisfy it in the seat of the woman and in doing so the very bite of the serpent the very Stinger of death is going to be conquered if God would allow that to come upon Adam Adam could not have redeemed us from the curse but coming upon Christ the sinless one he acts differently than Adam he's acting on another level than Adam and in that comes Redemption isn't that a beautiful picture how God's portraying that in the in the the curse and the consequences so the curses and the consequences for man and woman The Curse Of The Serpent and the Earth and then the consequences for men and women require and necessitate another Covenant as we're reading here in Genesis we see that the relationship between man and the woman and the experience of birth and conception and birth and rearing change entirely if I could say it this way and it's turned upside down to what God originally intended and I mean that it's it's okay to think about that that God God had it facing one way and then once there's a fall it flips around the other and so now there there's some symmetry to what God desired to what's unfolding but we recognize this is not this is only there's only types and shadows in this because the real substance has been lost and so it's been turned upside down to what God envisioned or foreshadowed in the beginning and we know and we recognize from Christ as the mystery God revealed that brother Branham speaks of God's threefold purpose and he says manifested in Adam and Eve so God's threefold purpose in the beginning is sown into the image of Adam and the woman God has a purpose in this he's painted this beautiful picture it's in them it holds the mystery of God's three full purpose so there's this there's something that's in that in the beginning so God made Adam he formed Adam first made him melon spirit that kinship to Supernatural Heaven as we put it before and now he takes his body from the Earth and unites them into one being and then not only does he have that expression but he brought forth the woman then arrange them together and God was intentional with each thing he was doing and so as God originally arranged it notice in Genesis 3 16. that now after the fall and the second Covenant comes into being he says and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now you're going to have to kind of dig from and recall the things that brother Adam said that we've been rehearsing through several services when when Jesus says this when God says this at the close of the beginning and the institution of the second Covenant anticipating the the Fallen nature of man and to rule that nature that's trending downward and and to address the consequences of the curses and the fall notice he says and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now I'm not going to take time to amplify or Define the words that are here but let me just say this isn't perfect love of Harmony this isn't the Oneness that existed in the beginning this is a different arrangement these are different words to describe a different interaction if I could say that when ah and I'm just looking to see if we're coming to it uh in in this sermon we do we are coming to it but let me just draw the comparison now then in the beginning when the woman stepped forth God didn't say now you're to love your husband and he's going to rule over you but now after the fall something changes and God I believe is intentional in what he allows to be shared I'm sure that we could we could assume and and since it's just an assumption and maybe it's just something we do thinking about it and imagine it that maybe there was more done and more said than is actually portrayed but God is very intentional in what is expressed and what is left in his word he wants that part to speak to us because there's something that is said that holds a thought and a meaning that God has every scripture is given by the Breath of God and is profitable to teach us something about what God's purpose and desire is for ourselves and to see Jesus Christ in every verse and so God is going to into great detail to show us that after the beginning is not what he loves you're cursed you're gonna do this you're gonna have this this is what's going to happen and God is going to great detail to say none of this hat was so at the start but because this has happened he is being deliberate and intentional not necessarily verbose and with a lot of detail but he's giving us precise things so that we could know this is different the world that God loved the heaven Earth Adam and the woman all arranged United perfectly one and in harmony under the God's Banner of love and in Genesis 3 17 where it says to Adam and cursed is the ground for thy sake I believe that the significance of this cannot be overstated cursed is the ground for thy sake now I had to I intentionally chopped in half the sermon this morning uh because it's just so much I I it's so much I want to get to and I don't want to uh I want to be long but I don't want to be too long I wish I could just be a little taller but it says cursed is the ground for thy sake when it says ground the word there is translated to Earth I think in another place but this may not surprise you cursed is the ground Adama which comes from Adam which is the very name for man and we might say because Adam Earth or ground means red and it speaks of a hue and that Adam was named because of this this Hue or this color of the ground that the destiny came from I just want to turn that around a little bit and say the Earth was named after man because of God's purpose for Earth we might say well man is named after the dust from which he came but I want you to look at it that once man came forth that was greater right if um my son Elliot his middle name is Aaron and no one would say that I'm named after Elliot right uh because you'd recognize uh the the father that which came that which was first and so when God created man and spirit being and when I say I want you to recognize that God has a higher purpose for that so when the dust now are you are you are you all with me right now I haven't sufficiently distracted You by mentioning brother Elliot's middle name or maybe you started thinking did he backslide the last four Services he was never here he was in Michigan doing work on the farm living the life of an only child spoiled by his grandparents pray for us we've got work to do that when the dust now is being raised up into another expression and form for the spirit Heavenly being to be deposited into it the dust now is not Adam Adam is now elevating that dust giving it form and purpose meaning Beyond maybe what people you would have originally thought to the dust and now I'm just positing this and I don't think we need to have this huge Paradigm Shift of our doctrinal stances and now when people go to our website and says you know the church's purpose is to declare that the Earth was named for Adam and Adam not from the Earth but there's something now to be said that the Earth is Adam because named after man because God's purpose for the Earth in Genesis 2 7 it says in the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground that ground there the Adam the Earth and God forms man Adam from that so there's some Affinity there's some kinship to it and there's some relationship to it and brother Branham says this in the sermon uh the question and answers in that beautiful summer of 64. he says the very creator that created the Earth for purpose so if we could pause there God created the Earth for a purpose he created the ground the dust of the ground for purpose that's what his purpose is now brother Graham says Satan defiled it he defiled the ground he defiled the purpose Satan defiled the Earth's purpose he defiled the dust of the ground's purpose he attacked the woman defiled the union of those which came from the ground so it says Satan defiled it it's not just the ground that was defiled but it's the Adam and the woman that came from the dust that that they had their purpose that their Unity they had their Harmony because notice what Adam declares in Genesis 2 23. and Adam said this is now speaking of the woman this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man man is Adam and in this man becomes ish because now once the woman is brought forth from him she becomes the Isha so you have Adam and then when you come to the now that the woman comes forth he's not just Adam from the ground he's now husband he's now ish and the woman that comes from him is Isha now that's showing that God had in the beginning he had this beautiful picture in this Arrangement it just wouldn't be Adam and then another Adam but it would be ish an Isha man and wife but now as God begins to separate as it well I'll just say this is he says this is born in my bones and Flesh of My Flesh in this separation or this manifestation of Isha brother bam said he is portraying his showing portraying here the bride right we this is things that are preached often in the message and I think these I want this to become more practical to us so we we recognize Adam came direct from God and then God placed then placed Adam into the Earth so man's spirit being is placed into the Earth and then the woman from the man and at the very moment the woman steps forth Adam becomes ish and she becomes Isha because she was taken from the husband and this is portraying the bride so this is the purpose of God if I could say this God's secret or hidden love is expressed in the unfolding of the image in the beginning God's portraying a beautiful love story that you're you're kind of reading the cliff note so the short story of what God is now going to unfold in a different clay a different Humanity a different setting what God's going to bring out of it and so brother Bradman the sermon Paradox says God made the Earth and there's no uh no trouble there we can all amen that he made it for a purpose brother Brian said the very Creator created the Earth for purpose to take a church out of it a bride so this was God's purpose was to get a bride out of it so what he what he is doing in bringing forth the man Adam from the earth and now he is life in the Earth and then he brings forth from that a wife because God wanted to have a bride but before before you can have a bride you have to have a bridegroom and so God needed to become these things so as the as the man comes forth and the woman from the man it's portraying by the ram says the bride because God made the Earth for a purpose the purpose was to take a bride out of the Earth so keep this in mind hopefully this can hold and lodge for a while as you chew on it cursed is the Earth for thy sake there is a curse that is made upon the Earth so when the curse settles upon the Earth God help me to express how that now there's other seeds other seeds now sown into the Earth that are going to come forth and it becomes the Earth chains it becomes the Earth's blight it becomes its curse and the fall turned God's world upside down and the fall of the woman the fall of mankind interrupted the trajectory of God's word what was foreshadowed God creates the Earth he sows all his seeds in the earth parable of the sower sow's good seed all the word goes into there there's God's Perfect Harmony the banner of perfect love over the Earth there it is in its Perfection then Along Comes The Wicked one and he sells something else into the earth now this curses the Earth and in that moment as God is recognizing that his creation is cursed there's something that seals up that life into the Earth he says from now on you're bringing up a different nature gonna be a different nature until Genesis 3 15. going to be a different nature coming something else coming forth from this and so every seed bringing forth of its kind now after the fall God says first Covenant pause the second Covenant comes in now there's different Natures coming forth and brother Brandon this so this curse upon the Earth this is very this is very deep into God's heart purpose cursed is the ground for thy sake he's wanting to Signal something don't think for a moment that that which is flesh and comes from the flesh alone is that which I love because remember the audience of John chapter 3. the the rabbinical teacher Nicodemus who thought as long as I have the Blood of Abraham I'm in the kingdom and Jesus says no no no no this Earth has been cursed so if all you have is born of the will of man and born of the desire after the fall then you can never understand the kingdom of God because that is cursed that the world that God loved is lost now it's embodied in me the Redeemer and unless you come in a sinless birth by the new birth as I have to be born again from above from heaven so this comes very very deep to the heart of God and brother Branham writes this the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing from out of the Earth that purpose was in himself I mean I'm annotating this and sown into the Earth and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world but at the fall God curses the Earth it's no longer in the state that it was originally in is that not why it said in Romans that all of creation is groaning being made subject unwillingly that it did not choose its bondage it did not have a part to play the Earth was pregnant with glory of the sons of God and then all of a sudden with the curse it's it's sealed up his true womb is sealed other seeds are being sown into it and it's been bound and changed Desiring every sense to be loosed into the Glorious Liberty of the sons of God because the heart purpose and the Eternal purpose of God was to have a bride of his own choosing this was in himself and then becomes modeled as he creates and so for God so loved the world there's the lover and the love the original World of perfect love now this original world I hope that we've said enough to where you could kind of kind of just if you just can hold take a picture in your mind of the original and under Covenant the fall in this transition to now the cursed Earth the cursed serpent this man and the woman I I think the original World this original world had a covenant of perfect love they were one with God they were one with each other brother Brian said no fear no shame and notice those dynamics that if that the shame the fear and shame is it was never it never existed internally in either one of them but upon the actions of another and external it manifests and externalizes these things so now whereas before between the two could you imagine I mean let's just for a moment think of never having a misunderstanding with your spouse never like when they say does this make me look fat and you're like yeah kinda that you're both on the same page she's like that's exactly what I was asking you gave me the right answer that's what I wanted to know instead of like wait a minute was this a trick question and then could you just imagine never having a misunderstanding always understanding perfectly that when you say something and they give you a look you're like I love you too and this is what they had there was no there was no suspicion why did you look at me that way what do you mean by that right it was perfect perfect understanding Adam you're getting fat it's good fruit in here in there right like there's no it's always positive it's all no fear no shame no negativity no vulnerability in a negative downward way but now in the transition from the original world that God loves The Serpent and the Earth are cursed not man not the woman you're recognizing this in the same sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother man says he didn't curse Eve but said Adam would be her ruler so recognize the consequence from the change of the original Covenant to the SEC the double Covenant catch the change in relationship and the arrangement as a consequence of sin the consequence of unbelief and I believe it's important this is where I'll revisit the statement this is where I believe marriage and divorce is so misunderstood and misapplied that God is controlling for the change of nature he didn't need to do that before but now in anticipation of the change of man's nature and the consequence of sin he has to doesn't curse Eve but he says Adam is going to be your ruler there's consequence now in Genesis chapter 2 verse 23 as we already read it this is now bone in my bones Flesh of My Flesh she is taken from woman I'm if she's Isha that was a declaration of co-equality when Adam says she is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh he is saying that she is equal to me she is me as the word help mean beads second person like a second self this is this is my perfect equal but opposite my perfect command companion in other words Adam could not look at the woman as something different than himself this was him this is a declaration of co-equality when God chose the rib and brought her forth I believe he is just not wanting to give men uh Minister's sermon material when they preach a wedding but it's true that he took it from the side of manner that in this in this uh this harmony this the side he's going to be a helpmate so he's he comes from the side to show equality she's a help me to show the opposite compliment isn't that a paradox equal but opposite but they're equal they're they're equal in the beginning that when the woman comes forth for man and you have ish and Isha what you have is bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she is me co-equality brother Banner the sermon marriage and divorce says God at the beginning made one of a kind the Covenant was co-equal but now after the fall there's another covenant made now she was no longer ruler with him each must have a second Covenant do you do you mind if I just throw a little piece out there to make you come back for next Sunday in the image after the fall brother Matt says before the fall co-equal she's ruler with him after the fall a different Covenant he's her ruler when redemption's complete we share the very Throne of God ruling with him where is this going how horribly has false Christianity and a fake semblance of this message tried to change God's word to suit the agenda of a bunch of perverted men even for those who fight against it now brother Branham says it again in marriage and divorce first was just a covenant so when he says justice Covenant he's saying it was only one Covenant Adam and Eve was co-equal I have no qualms with the use of a singular verb Adam and the woman was co-equal one man and one woman equal in other words when you look at them you'd have to say it now there's one and someone for someone who doesn't believe God I clearly see too but I see one I clearly see I see one one unit one person I guess you know right like it looks like one to me thank you Levi so this declaration of co-equality one man and one woman now the woman sin and what does she do that through them all to death and God had to make a covenant by that another Covenant so it's consequence that forces this here it is right here in Genesis 3 16. he made another Covenant what's the other the New Covenant and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so when God's original Covenant was that that represented perfect Oneness perfect love perfect Unity perfect equality co-equal but now that equality is lost and now that there's going to be disparate natures and variegated Natures it's going to be across the board it's going to be different he says we need a new covenant to control for this now I hope this isn't too much of a rip in here but look at Ephesians chapter 5 verse 29. this I'm I'm examining the single Covenant versus the double Covenant that's instituted after the fall God so loved the world the world of the single Covenant the Bible says for no man ever yet hated his own flesh here's where my lisp gets wet but nourisheth and shareseth it even as the Lord the church no man ever yet hated despised his own flesh now if I could say this if you look at Job 42 6. Paul must be expressing something very specific something very particular given the consequence the context as he's instructed we know he's instructing husbands love your wives wives obey your husbands in the Lord and he's kind of addressing family unit and but now he's wanting he's wanting to use examples as he expresses this uh and he's I hope I'm not saying too much to get you you're wondering here but now as he says for no man ever yet hated his own flesh and and it begs the question so no man has ever hated himself Paul must be be very very precise in job 42 6 wherefore I abhor myself in repent and dust and Ashes some translations render it as I I abhor what I said others say I hate myself and the context in the commentary of job's uh lamenting and is pouring himself out he said I hate myself I hate what I said I hate what I despise myself I repent and doesn't dust and Ashes so when Paul says no man ever yet hated his own flesh and here's job at least giving us something to wrestle with because he said no Paul said no man has ever hated himself and you say you know nobody likes me everybody hates me I'm gonna go eat some worms I hate myself and I was like no no you haven't no you haven't Ephesians 5 29 you don't hit yourself he's like no this is pretty real I feel this job felt it First Kings 19 4 about Elijah running fleeing but he himself with a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and it came and sat under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and I said and said it's enough I'm done I can't go anymore now oh Lord take away my life for I am not better than my fathers he hated himself he hated his life he didn't want to live anymore Paul must be talking about something very very precise here remember what I'm tracking is co-equality one flesh Adam and the woman one flesh and now Paul is saying no man ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it and then in John 12 25 just to kind of make this even more clumsy for us he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal you better hate your life in this world so when Paul says that he no man has ever yet hated his own flesh he's not generalizing a person's love of self I do not believe that alone is he just hearkening to the fact that we all think of ourselves and our flesh and we take care of it and we don't take risk that would otherwise harm it or cause it to be put into Peril Paul is not just drawing on the general nature of man to want to preserve his own life he says no man has ever despised or hated it he's being very very specific because when he says no man has ever hated his own flesh it signifies himself who he is what he is what he stands for his nature his ability his power his life and so given the context as he says no man has aided hated his own self but but has nourished and cherished himself even as the Lord the church notice how he's turned it given the context as the Lord the church there are two examples that Paul is pointing to we're not we're not going to this is this I don't think this is dry for you I don't I'm just making positive confessions this morning I think you're all with me I know this is a lot of material but given the context Paul is pointing to two examples Adam because the woman was his own flesh and the last Adam the bride because the bride is his own body in Genesis 2 24 therefore shall man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife think of this as prophecy now that the woman's come forth in anticipation of what's going to happen God prophesies therefore shall a man leave his father and mother well we have yet to see any children per se and the way that we would expect it but this is prophecy amen Adam shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his Isha and they shall be one flesh now Adam and I hope I hope I can come to it today Adam no Adam no man no Adam has ever hated his own flesh the first Adam and the last Adam loved their own wives because they were him so when Adam looked at his looked at his wife he didn't look at her something else he looked at her as himself Ephesians 1 22-23 and he have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so what is the bride himself it's his body who was the woman it was Adam himself it was his body no Adam has ever hated himself not the first Adam not the last Adam there's a reason why he's called an atom and what does God saying brother Brandon said after the church age book it was God's purpose to bring forth remember heart purpose Earth purpose to bring forth the people like unto himself that would be a word bride so she is him and his himself no man ever hated his own flesh is perfectly true when it comes to Adam and Christ that's what he's referring to I believe that's the perfect type he's pointing to and so the Earth as the Bible says the ground was made for the purpose of bringing forth a word Bride for Christ who would be like himself remember God's mystery concerning creation that there's if I could say this this is uh if I put it this way Heaven's Glory was Earth's mystery and in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth very first utterance of scripture God wants to tell a story of redemption he begins with these words in the beginning Elohim created the Heaven and the Earth Elohim the L strong one plus Allah Bound by an oath or a covenant making it come to swear it means the Covenant God created a union Between Heaven and Earth the Covenant of God placed them together showing the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride something he was wanting to achieve something he was wanting to express was a hidden reflection in his creation from the very first words honored of Elohim the Covenant God wants a bride groom and a bride that's what he wants to become in the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says now God's secret mystery he had before the world began uh forecast in Genesis 1 1 if I could say now back in the back part of God's mind there was something he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed to let himself be expressed you say well was Adam not expressed in the single unit yes he's expressed but then he's expressed in the woman a mystery comes out of him further manifestation and it's not too it's the same now in Ephesians 5 29-32. for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherished with it even as the Lord the church notice how if it's the Lord the church then he's do you recognize how he's created that that dual image and that that second expression where you have the man in his own flesh Christ and the church so it's not just self-loathing it's that expression of the wife for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones there's your himself of the Bride for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh Paul revisits this prophecy to show us the love of God if you're worried about how long I'm going to be there's no virtue and worry for this cause shall a man leave his father mother almost verbatim the prophetic utterance of Genesis 2 I shall cleave unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh he's revisiting this part this this Prophecy in the context of of the love that a husband has for his wife to see the love of God so in Romans chapter 5 verse 14 because remember the two atoms I'm talking about Adam and the last Adam no Adam ever aided his own flesh these husbands did not hate their wives nevertheless Romans 5 14 nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression so the likeness or image of atoms going over or breaking God's covenant or breaking God's law not Covenant breaking God's law so after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is in the figure of him that was to come because you have to recognize that Adam under a different Covenant was given a separate commandment a specific commandment to fulfill that only he could fulfill then once the second Covenant is instituted and even to Noah there there there's a covenant given man cannot break the law Adam was under so we have not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression that it says likeness or image of atoms going over or breaking and that though trust that you're with me I give you permission to wake up your neighbor if they're sleeping I don't see anybody's eyes closed but just somebody's praying out of transgression now Adam who is the example or pattern of Christ so the symmetude all this is getting so good the similitude of Adam's transgression the likeness and image of what Adam did in the beginning is a pattern an example of Christ who was to come Hallelujah and the Book of Job or in the sermon job or those looking for a job the sermon job he preached it here in Phoenix God so loved the world that he gave notice what brother Brown says so loved Adam so loved Eve that he went out with her Christ so loved the church that he went with her God so loved the world Adam went with Eve and her wrong she was wrong he knew the wrong he was innocent but she was guilty but Adam said ow with her and Christ looked at the church and knowing it was wrong yet Christ went with us and took our place Yonder as a sinner to die for us to take the sting out of death for us sinner how can you reject such massless love only if you're not the match atoms transgression the image and the manifestation that which Adam did in his transgression was a pattern of the one who was to come Christ says for God so loved Adam went out with his wife when he knew he knew she was wrong Christ did the same thing for us the Bible says in first Timothy 2 13-14 for Adam was first formed then the eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression why because love is not deceived love is not duped love is not given over to infatuation love is not given over to lust love ah I got to get the young people involved love is not a simp hey love is acting deliberately right love knows love isn't he's not sprung he's not infatuated he's not he he's not just blind oh love is blind and oh oh he knew exactly what he was doing Adam no Adam didn't hear the sermon Adam didn't have the serpent talking to him to get him to receive something first in his mind and for the first settle in his heart and then act upon it Adam in the moment it's not deceived but he so loved his wife love was not misled love did not behave inappropriately brother Brenham says Now Eve should have been burned along with the serpent for their awful deed listen she should have been burned she should have been cursed she should have been cursed just like the serpent but Adam intervened taking her quickly to himself so that she was saved this was Love's Act this was perfect Love's instinct brother bam says another place he knew it was wrong but because of the love for his wife he represented himself with sin and was condemned by the same and cast out of the Garden of Eden there your prophecies fulfilled he left father God and mother Eden therefore shall a man leave father and mother to do what be joined to his wife place his seed in her bring forth the child that is the one flesh back again her DNA his DNA United back again it's prophecy Adam did this out of love that for this cause man is one because they're born Abode flesh or flesh because this reason when Adam sees that his wife is wrong he's gonna say honey I've got to save you in this moment and he leads father God he leaves Mother Earth Mother Eden he knows he's going to lose it in the next verses he's banished from his mother from which his body came from the womb of the Earth he's driven out cleaving to his wife he brother Branham says but Adam so loved his wife and he wasn't deceived but he loved her so well that he walked out with her a perfect type of Jesus Christ who knew no sin but came to the world and took the sin of his wife and walked to death with her this is perfect love is God not powerful enough to just keep creating and creating and creating until finally he wins the lottery and finds one that'll never make a mistake what love would that be but this is charity this is the headstone that comes crying Grace Grace when Divine love is projected to its object Sovereign Grace steps in and produces what is projected I've got to finish this at another time but I hope that you can recognize the place that this has in our hearts at the end time when the Bible says in Zechariah 4 7 he shall bring forth The Headstone with shouting's crying Grace Grace undo it this is not theology this is not history this is the bride's lover brother said but now we come to the Head the Capstone Grace Grace that it must be divine love being projected [Music] it's all in the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed for no man ever yet hated his own flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church is it plain to you do you see it do you recognize what layers the message is opening up to us as we read Ephesians 5 this is so much greater than any wedding vow has ever been tried to pretend to be this is something Eternal this is something beautiful that God is trying to get us to see this is a great mystery of the one flesh that man no man has ever hated God so loved the world that in her darkest moment in her weakest time in the darkest the church has ever been for God so loved that in the last days the great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church Ephesians 5 23 and is the savior of the body I haven't even been going long I've had Wednesday nights longer than this Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body I want to come back to this very scene of Adam and the figure of Christ at a later time but Christ is the Capstone he is Charity his perfect love and then he is a savior so now this is important when Christ when under the second Covenant thy desire shall be to your husband such a peculiar statement but it makes sense given the Fallen nature that arises and he shall have rule over thee Brothers said that's different than the original one original is co-equal now this is different but when Paul says Christ is the head when he establishes Christ's headship he then defines what headship means the head is the savior the deliverer the preserver the one who keeps safe and sound and makes well the head gives life it nurtures it brings up it feeds it tenderly cares for it Fosters with Tinder care the head gives life to the body to raise it up it restores it it revives it it raptures it the head we think the head brings under subjection right the head is to to cause subjection the headers to to create order in hierarchy no no the hand is to give life the head is to raise up the head is to to to heal that that's what the the that's what the purpose of the head is it's not to dominate and Rule it's to restore it's to revive and brother Branham says in Christ is a mystery God revealed and now to the Christ in the church is just being made known the head the whole thing is the revelation of God to take Eve back to a right position again with her husband you read right over that it went right over your head didn't it remember what we just read about Adam in Christ that when she knew she was wrong she had played the part of the adulterer she had broke the marriage vowed the union vow and now he says it's a revelation of God to take it back what is that it's a language of restoration it's a language of forgiveness do you recognize that I know I've done wrong would you have me back I know I've made a mistake would you take me back maybe I'm trying to get you to think of in terms of maybe in a worldly relationship or relationships where somebody does something wrong and the person ascends against him and breaks the vow and now this is it this is over how can we can continue the question is would you take me back and what is it this is what he says because he says take her back again to take her back to a right position again with her husband he said the whole thing of the revelation of God so what does God do he reveals perfect love to take you back and focusing so much maybe chronologically or this paradise this Eden that existed historically we miss the significance of what Eden what was represented in Eden that in the Eden before eternity had completely slipped away Adam's taking you back woman taking you back and now in the end time God says I'm going to take her back again to spider sin to spider condition and brother Branham says now to the life and the body is a Vindication of the raptures at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about to be received to the headship or he's referring to the kingdom when he's talking about that I hope that you can understand the reason why I've transitioned into these things we all we so often maybe hear it in this theological sense but this is so real in the sense of the love that Christ had for you that when he starts talking about Christ and the bride and then taking her back because Christ found that his bride had fallen so now when he says take your back it has an example of a millennial Reign it has a type of the future Kingdom but before anyone that could ever happen he has to take you back again to a Garden of Eden condition he's got to take you back again to stand his husband and wife so he says he has begun to give life unto his body why because he is the head and the savior of the body he's acting out the part of Adam he begins to give life to his body why the one that he's redeemed the mediatorial work is done I know that's a hard saying he's bringing life to a body in the Vindication for a rapture and then what is he says oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is it's a love story it's perfect love if I could say it this way he is your head and you are his heart mutually dependent equally alive and vital this is the Revelation that he's wanting to bring to us to us if our brothers could come to their instruments I close with the statement from this sermon and and I hope I can summarize this morning to you I want you to understand we're at a pause now in this service I'll take a step back Wednesday night and deal with hatred he says no man had ever yet hated his own flesh and deal with hate and how that when it comes to filio there's this perversion of Love and Hate but in agape hatred has a very precise and specific context and and it's uh it's a clause under perfect love that's not easily exercised and and maybe you could begin to think about that but I'm coming to a pause before we look at the original Covenant of perfect love and what we've seen in the world in the beginning is how that Adam acts in the moment and what he did for Eve to preserve her she should have been condemned with the serpent she should have been cursed with the Earth she should have been cursed with the serpent but Adam before God before there's ever a chance Adam does something very specific he says and that's in the figure of Christ and then brother Branham Satan in this last days and if I could say this we know that brother Branham was under a vow to not say too much and so as he's preaching Christ as the mystery of God revealed he's preaching that seventh seal in such beautiful detail and and he's trying to express a picture that I believe he sees so vividly and he's wanting to convey it in a language that hopefully the bride can catch that's why it goes to length to start calling us bride so that you'll understand why change of relationship there was a language that was used as consequence of a double Covenant being introduced but then as the seals are being opened language changes brother Branham in this great sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed this great mystery that was once in God's heart he says secondly the manifested Christ in you the hope of glory that great manifested God in Christ now Christ manifested in you he goes we'll hurry look what was once God's Secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer the body of Christ so what was once in his heart is now in your heart beating together now one flesh what was once God's Great Secret in his mind [Music] before the foundation of the world is now made manifest think of it are you thinking about it what are my inspiration message preaches it's coming from invisible units coming from future home it's coming from marriage and divorce this is the inspiration he says and he said do you get it do you get it can you understand why I preach what I preached you see you see what these things mean and he says oh my I'm sure we don't we don't get it well I can't see it the way I I ought to and I'm sure you don't and everybody's like yep but God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ and they give it right down to his church what was once and God's mind is now in the body of Christ and this is perfect love this is an act of redemption Jesus making love to the church's bride Whispering secrets to her you know how much you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much just tell her the secrets and get up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what God Christ is doing to the church he's letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters I mean his wife all right now look no by having the revelation of a secret made known to them by his grace Divine love being projected how the grace of God he goes people I know it and then this this this pause I hope you don't think this sounds personal to a bunch of people or this or that was he taught the way that he's describing this he's but the secret that God is sharing with the whole church if they just would receive it it doesn't mean just me or just you it means the church that he's trying to get into it if you've ever wondered if he'd take you back he does he will that's perfect love would he do it yes he has to you're him he can't deny you he can't turn you away why it's perfect love if it was my filio no doubt any one of us would say after a while there'd be a a callous a hardness we would have to say just to save ourselves no enough's enough I can't do it but here we stand not in a filial relationship not looking at our not as our accusers of the flesh not least we're not looking at a pastor who claims to be a husband to the church we're looking at Christ would you take me back he says a million times I would every time I would I'd take you back what about the flatters now this isn't to them the flatters come and go and come and go and come and go my heart's not with them their hearts far from me as a matter of fact they flirted with me but I've never known them they've never been with me to be taken back but you were in my heart from the beginning yo my message to you brother Brown is preaching the revelation of The Headstone he calls it the Capstone revelation of Jesus Christ he's saying I will take you back again because it's perfect love it's a it's a love stubborn and I thank God for it it pursues it and the Bible says many Waters cannot quench love no flirters and all the billions of flares have never showered God on the please of forgive me and I say today if you've ever wondered if he'd take you back he's Whispering a secret to you today and he's saying I do I will now would you just receive it maybe what you need to do is get over the self-hate to do it but if you condemn yourself if your heart hates yourself if you condemn yourself God is greater than our hearts and knows all things and he says I don't hate you I can't you can hate yourself but I can't hate myself you can loathe your spirit you can hate yourself but I can't hate you neither do I condemn you come I implore you with all that is in me I'm looking at a picture that and myself that may be incomplete to you today but in this moment in this time as we settle under the glow of Adam not hating the woman and Christ not hating the bride can I receive today to say yes he loves me oh can we say it I I had been pondering an example a title of this I know in other words Jesus loves me as I know I I I'm confident of that is there not somebody here of late who has certainly said I'm sure that it's too late I'm sure that he wouldn't take me back and it's based upon the Dynamics of the filial love where we're very conscious of the callous we're very conscious of the cynicism and the criticism and the contempt that can be bred with the natural relationships and we begin to project that upon Christ and we surely he has contempt for me but no no that it's not so with perfect love and you've lamented of your Redemption and you've been unsure of your salvation and I give to you thus saith the Lord it's not too late to receive it [Music] oh let's pray I thou our heads [Music] if you must must if you must receive it I say stand and open your heart to receive I deplore you to save what I receive your unconditional love I received this offer of redemption [Music] oh [Music] oh God I don't know Lord but the Bible says that the woman took it to Adam Lord I forgive me if this is wrong but did she come to him trembling [Music] did she come to him already fearful unsure Adam I've done something horrible Adam I've ruined our dreamed Adam I'm sorry Adam forgive me and he says honey don't worry come to me oh God could it be could it be Lord that Latin isn't seduced by his wife [Music] but there's love for her oh God may I as your son received this love for myself may I have even the character of the woman to come to him broken and ruined and say oh I'm dumb I'm dumb I'm sorry would you have me back and I believe Lord that I am no flirter but I come to you as a Son of God today and I say Jesus loves me this I know and Lord I'm more sure of your love than I've ever been before and I pray now as a pastor of this church I pray as the Son of God to your children who hear you as a man of God under the burden of this Covenant Lord I pray made the chains and the bondage of the complexes I feel your love be broken this morning Lord may we recognize that Adam's transgression forecast an image that Christ acts in the image of and the Revelation at the open of the seals is that yes yes you take us back and therefore I stand before you today willing to be received willing [Music] oh God I pray now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you would break the cycles that exist and loose us father from these self-defeating Cycles the loathing the hate the complexes the fear loose us into your love Lord Jesus I pray that life would come May births take place deep within the soul beyond the callous Lord that you could bring forth Daughters of God in sons of God As We ought to be Lord I pray that you grant it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music]
