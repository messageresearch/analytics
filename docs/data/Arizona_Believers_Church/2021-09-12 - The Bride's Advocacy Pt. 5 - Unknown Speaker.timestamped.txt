[0:00] second corinthians chapter five
[0:04] second corinthians chapter five is where
[0:05] i'd like to read i apologize if i've
[0:07] forgotten any announcements
[0:12] i want to begin with verse
[0:14] 17. and read to verse 21.
[0:19] the first scripture that we're going to
[0:21] read is very familiar to us in terms of
[0:24] if
[0:24] being a new creature
[0:26] and that by virtue of the new birth a
[0:28] man is sealed by the holy ghost and
[0:31] an individual becomes a new creation new
[0:34] creatures in christ jesus
[0:36] but then the preceding verses to me
[0:38] really amplify
[0:40] what this
[0:42] purpose is and i hope that
[0:45] this can become
[0:47] a very uh just a cornerstone scripture
[0:50] for you
[0:52] verse 17. therefore if any man be in
[0:54] christ he is a new creature
[0:56] old things are passed away
[0:59] behold all things are become new now
[1:01] notice how he continues because he's
[1:03] going to take all things from verse 17
[1:06] and this kind of leads him into this
[1:08] thought process on reconciliation and
[1:10] all things are of god who hath
[1:12] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[1:16] and have given to us the ministry of
[1:19] reconciliation now notice what he's
[1:21] saying here
[1:22] all things are god all things are of god
[1:25] now he wants to amplify what this all
[1:27] things are become new what it really
[1:29] means for us
[1:31] and he said is given to us the ministry
[1:33] of reconciliation to it
[1:35] that god was in christ recklessly in the
[1:38] world unto himself not imputing their
[1:40] trespasses unto them and hath committed
[1:43] unto us the word of reconciliation
[1:46] now then we are this is what all things
[1:49] will become new notice this now then we
[1:52] are ambassadors for christ as though god
[1:54] did beseech you by us we pray you in
[1:57] christ's stead be reconciled to god
[2:00] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[2:03] who knew no sin that we might be made
[2:06] the righteousness of god in him
[2:08] and notice those bookends in 17 and 21
[2:12] new creature old things are passed away
[2:14] all things are become new and we have
[2:17] been made the very righteousness of god
[2:19] in him god bless you you can take your
[2:21] seats
[2:25] i want to just jump right into this
[2:27] in terms of continuing on part five of
[2:30] the bride's advocacy
[2:32] very excited in terms of the
[2:35] subject matter i feel like i'm coming
[2:37] right to the real emphasis that i had in
[2:38] the beginning
[2:40] of uh
[2:42] when we began to look at an advocate and
[2:44] we'd mentioned that we wanted to begin
[2:45] to deal with advocacy
[2:47] and
[2:48] we're taking from revelations chapter 22
[2:50] verse 17 how that the spirit and the
[2:52] bride say come
[2:54] and that uh is emphasized to us in the
[2:57] message of the hour that the bride under
[2:59] her messenger is
[3:00] the final voice to the final age so we
[3:04] have to recognize this unnecessary
[3:07] calling and gifting in our lives as
[3:09] members of the bride that we are to be
[3:11] the final voice and as the final voice
[3:14] we're not voicing our opinions we're not
[3:16] voicing our conspiracy theories or
[3:18] suspicions we are actually a voice of
[3:20] christ the voice of god therefore we
[3:22] must advocate for the cause of christ
[3:25] wednesday night i don't really want to
[3:27] get into much of what we spoke on
[3:29] wednesday night i want to just kind of
[3:30] leave it as it was but and i appreciated
[3:33] all the positive feedback that we heard
[3:35] and even some insightful comments and
[3:36] questions related to it
[3:39] but the um there's a lot of anti there's
[3:42] a lot of causes a lot of things that we
[3:44] could be uh wrapped up in but what we
[3:46] want to find is at the end of the day we
[3:48] are pro-christ
[3:49] we are for christ as in revelations
[3:52] chapter 10 verse 11 it says that john
[3:55] thou must prophesy again unto all the
[3:57] world and people nations tongues and
[3:59] kings to prophesy again it means to
[4:01] plead the cause of god it's used of
[4:03] those who would in a calling in an
[4:05] office plead
[4:07] plead the cause of god so it's not their
[4:09] own cause not pleading their own case
[4:11] but they plead the cause of god as an
[4:13] advocate for the cause of christ and in
[4:15] doing so they urge others to receive the
[4:18] word they're urging them to be saved and
[4:20] to be rescued from the tribulation
[4:22] that's to come
[4:23] and this advocacy for christ is not
[4:26] self-promotion
[4:28] it is not the promotion of any
[4:29] particular personality we have to be
[4:31] careful with that many times uh there's
[4:33] certain dynamics that work within human
[4:35] nature sometimes there's dynamics that
[4:37] work within uh things that we
[4:38] fellowshipped around where things become
[4:40] very uh personality centric
[4:43] unfortunately within uh christianity
[4:45] these days especially within uh nominal
[4:47] christianity or the evangelical world
[4:49] church has become very pastor centric
[4:51] and it's really the name it's you know
[4:53] everyone knows about the name i could
[4:55] maybe mention a name to you and you
[4:56] wouldn't even know the name of the
[4:57] church you just know that hey that guy's
[4:59] all over the place and you wouldn't
[5:00] necessarily know the name of the church
[5:02] and so that's uh that's not there's a
[5:04] tendency to do that and so we want to be
[5:06] very careful that we don't just kind of
[5:08] shift into another mode where we start
[5:09] promoting personality but that we're
[5:11] promoting christ
[5:13] and to that end it's not a church
[5:14] promotion either
[5:16] but that we have this conviction that we
[5:18] as i said wednesday night we invite
[5:19] people to church and we say come and see
[5:21] and that's our that's our invitation
[5:23] that's a an effective witness that if
[5:25] anybody finds that being around us they
[5:27] get a little bit thirsty through our
[5:29] saltiness and they want to know and
[5:30] maybe you begin to witness or testify
[5:32] and you find i don't know how to explain
[5:34] this and i don't know how to do that
[5:35] well you had an experience with the word
[5:36] and that's why you are the way you are
[5:38] and so you invite them to come to church
[5:40] so that they can have an experience with
[5:43] the word and in coming and having an
[5:44] experience with the word they in turn
[5:46] will be the ones that are saying hey you
[5:48] know what god did this for me and you
[5:50] know this is in the bible and this has
[5:51] happened and the person i don't
[5:52] understand he goes well you know what
[5:53] just come and see
[5:55] that's what happened to me you just come
[5:56] and see
[5:58] and i guess i do want to touch on it a
[6:00] little bit as i made myself a note that
[6:03] picking up from wednesday night we need
[6:04] to be very careful not to conflate
[6:07] uh conservative political causes with
[6:09] the cause of christ
[6:11] then we have to be very careful about
[6:12] that and then let's just say that all of
[6:14] a sudden we have this epiphany we're
[6:16] like oh no i don't want to conflate
[6:19] conservative political policies uh with
[6:22] christianity we don't swing the other
[6:24] side and then think so therefore i must
[6:25] become a liberal no or a libertarian
[6:28] wherever you want to find yourself on a
[6:30] political spectrum that's something
[6:31] totally different
[6:33] as even the question was asked well you
[6:35] know should we vote well that's your
[6:36] civic duty
[6:37] that's a duty you would have as a
[6:39] citizen that's a right that you would
[6:40] exercise if your government gives you
[6:42] that opportunity and you would exercise
[6:44] that as a citizen of whatever
[6:45] jurisdiction you're in there's some
[6:47] people believers and christians in some
[6:49] places where the vote they may not even
[6:51] have a vote and even if they had a vote
[6:53] it would be a sham so the ability to
[6:55] vote voting or not voting isn't
[6:57] necessarily indicative of whether or not
[6:58] you're a christian that's your civic
[7:00] duty and what we have to be careful is
[7:02] that we don't get ourselves entangled in
[7:05] some sort of political quagmire or a war
[7:07] or cause and then in order to justify we
[7:10] say oh well brother branham said this
[7:12] and brother branham said that and the
[7:13] bible says this and the bible says that
[7:15] but we want to kind of disentangle
[7:17] ourselves from all the rhetoric that's
[7:19] in the world today and all the
[7:20] polarization and all the things that's
[7:22] taking place
[7:23] because political activism we could say
[7:26] even political advocacy advocacy for
[7:28] certain policies has taken over the
[7:30] evangelical world
[7:32] we have to be very careful that by
[7:34] virtue of common commerce and common
[7:36] ideals and things that we might share
[7:38] that we don't get swept up in that
[7:40] and there even i would say not just
[7:42] putting the a point in the finger at
[7:44] evangelicals just even christianity as a
[7:47] whole is being co-opted by politics
[7:50] and if you're like oh i don't know about
[7:51] that brother brother where is it going
[7:52] to end up
[7:54] combination of church and state there's
[7:56] going to be a union of it so it's taking
[7:58] place where man-made traditions and
[8:00] carnal agendas are kind of taking over
[8:02] and sweeping over identities and voices
[8:04] and in messages and and what you stand
[8:07] for and what you present so we're we're
[8:10] cautioning you do not become entangled
[8:12] in this culture of americana uh
[8:15] christianity
[8:16] there's a certain bravado a certain
[8:18] pride a certain uh you know we're
[8:20] christians and we have god-given rights
[8:22] and anymore those rights are guns right
[8:25] that's their god-given i have a
[8:27] god-given right to own ar-15 and we we
[8:30] have to take a step back and realize
[8:31] well no that's probably the right that's
[8:32] been granted to me by my natural you
[8:35] know like a citizenship and by a
[8:37] government and by a bill of rights and
[8:38] that we are governed by a different
[8:40] constitution
[8:42] we are governed by different bill of
[8:43] rights and it's those rights that we
[8:44] want to effectively exercise it's those
[8:47] rights that we want to stand up for
[8:50] now in second corinthians chapter 5
[8:52] verse 20
[8:55] this is in
[8:56] this being in our text i think it um
[9:00] i want to start here and end up in the
[9:02] same reading in the same in our text
[9:05] we touched on this wednesday night says
[9:06] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[9:11] as though god did beseech you by us now
[9:13] that's a very profound phrase
[9:16] that he says we are ambassadors for
[9:18] christ and in that we are representing
[9:20] christ because an ambassador is a person
[9:22] who's sent from one sovereign power uh
[9:25] to another sovereign power so i'm sent
[9:27] by god and
[9:29] and so you're using that maybe in a
[9:30] political sense or nations since
[9:32] government sense he's saying i'm an
[9:34] ambassador for christ so christ has sent
[9:36] me
[9:37] and this ambassador this relationship is
[9:40] so strong
[9:42] as i beseech you it's as if god is
[9:44] beseeching you like you should take this
[9:46] message and what i'm declaring to you as
[9:48] being from god so he says we pray you
[9:50] this is a very heavy statement that i
[9:52] want you to i want this just to sink in
[9:54] deeper today we pray you in christ stead
[9:58] in christ said be you reconciled to god
[10:02] in christ said on
[10:03] christ's behalf
[10:05] representing him as if he was present
[10:07] before you
[10:08] that i'm declaring i'm representing the
[10:11] presence of christ i'm representing and
[10:13] declaring to you his power his
[10:15] attributes his authority his word so in
[10:17] christ's stead i am here as if one as if
[10:21] christ is present with you saying be
[10:23] reconciled take god at his word find
[10:26] this harmony in this union unity with
[10:28] god
[10:29] and
[10:30] this this relationship that paul has
[10:33] expounded upon here as an ambassador for
[10:35] christ and in christ's death now i want
[10:37] to come back to that but i want to kind
[10:39] of pick up
[10:40] um everything that we've been preaching
[10:42] since september last year i've been
[10:44] thinking a lot about who is my neighbor
[10:46] because a lot of these principles are
[10:47] building back into it but pick up some
[10:50] of these things we've been preaching
[10:51] through the first four parts of the
[10:52] bride's advocacy
[10:54] and how we begin to identify how paul
[10:56] approached uh relationships with people
[11:00] especially uh unbelievers
[11:02] and this is paul's justification as to
[11:05] why he would say hey i act in such a way
[11:07] to where i please i am all things to all
[11:10] men and uh and and i wanna i wanna
[11:12] please men i don't want to alienate
[11:14] people this was paul's reason for doing
[11:17] that he says i'm an ambassador for
[11:19] christ
[11:20] i am here in christ's dead so i have a i
[11:23] have another cause that i've got to be
[11:25] faithful to
[11:26] and even my sensitivities and things
[11:28] that i
[11:29] get my gander up and things that bother
[11:31] me i have to forget about all that and
[11:33] act in such a way that promotes the
[11:35] cause of christ because i have to ask
[11:37] myself what would jesus do
[11:39] how would he handle this situation and
[11:41] and i know that sounds somewhat of a
[11:43] cliche but even in that
[11:45] anymore the definition of jesus and the
[11:47] picture that's been painted of jesus
[11:49] isn't even a scriptural one anymore
[11:51] and so what paul was doing says i know
[11:53] what christ taught my sheep hear my
[11:54] voice and they follow me and they won't
[11:57] follow another and they see how christ
[11:58] said i sanctify myself for your sakes
[12:00] and he caught this revelation of jesus
[12:02] christ and so now he's saying i'm in
[12:04] christ's dead and so i'm going to act a
[12:07] particular way so that me
[12:09] as as an ambassador to christ are for
[12:12] god i am effective in this office
[12:16] as he said in first corinthians chapter
[12:18] 10 verse 33 even as i please all men in
[12:20] all things
[12:22] that's a statement that some could take
[12:23] say oh man yeah let's please men in all
[12:26] things whenever i'm with somebody uh uh
[12:28] who who smokes marijuana i want to smoke
[12:30] marijuana i don't want to offend them
[12:31] i'm not going to i'm not going to call
[12:33] them out if i'm in this group over here
[12:34] that likes to go do this well i'm going
[12:36] to go along with it because i don't want
[12:37] to offend that's not what paul is saying
[12:38] he says not seeking my own prophet but
[12:41] the prophet of many that they may be
[12:44] saved
[12:45] just that phrase alone could become a
[12:47] real barrier to a lot of things that we
[12:49] say and do in a lot of ways that we
[12:50] present ourselves you say well i could i
[12:53] could kind of give in to that and i
[12:54] could go along with that because i don't
[12:56] want to offend him but in doing so would
[12:58] it promote salvation
[13:00] could it just confuse the picture all
[13:02] the more
[13:03] if if you continue down that path so he
[13:06] was not if when you read this
[13:08] even as i please all men in all things
[13:10] not seeking my own prophet but the
[13:12] prophet of many that they may be saved
[13:14] remember he says i do this and i conduct
[13:17] myself restrain myself in all things in
[13:19] every way so i could save some
[13:22] so it wasn't that all would be saved it
[13:23] would be worth it just to save some
[13:26] and again remember he's not doing this
[13:28] carnally
[13:29] he's doing this in christ's stead
[13:32] so when you read this in chapter 9 as we
[13:34] went through chapter 9 he says similar
[13:35] things in chapter 10 he's saying similar
[13:37] things he's not doing this as paul's
[13:39] opinion or paul's this is ah that's just
[13:41] paul being paul no he's saying i must do
[13:43] this in christ stead
[13:46] so he did not want to hinder
[13:49] the effectiveness of the word
[13:52] i'm an ambassador for christ i have a
[13:53] message my behavior can convolute that
[13:57] the things i say the things i do can
[13:59] make a clout cloud that up and could
[14:00] cause confusion lead others astray so he
[14:03] wanted to act in such a way that it
[14:04] would make it easier for others to
[14:06] receive what he had to say
[14:09] i'm sure that we we all know people
[14:11] uh
[14:12] in
[14:14] in our lives or maybe we've been that
[14:15] person we could just be honest we've
[14:17] been that person where we we're saying
[14:19] the right thing but that
[14:20] or we're hearing the right thing but
[14:22] it's really hard to receive it from that
[14:24] person
[14:25] why because they're always doing saying
[14:27] this and they're always saying that and
[14:28] they could come and tell you the
[14:30] absolute truth and it would have been
[14:32] the worst thing that could have happened
[14:33] because it's coming from them
[14:36] and they finally are
[14:37] rational they're finally sharing a
[14:39] stable thought they're actually speaking
[14:41] the truth but because they're the source
[14:42] of it you think ah they got a bone to
[14:44] pick oh they're just being critical well
[14:46] they said this they said that and so
[14:48] paul realizes man i can pick a lot of
[14:50] causes and i can say a lot of things and
[14:52] i could die on a lot of mountains to
[14:53] when it comes time to sharing the truth
[14:55] of the gospel they just kind of take
[14:57] that and they throw it in with
[14:58] everything else
[15:00] and so he's very careful about that
[15:02] the moderation of opinion
[15:04] the modesty of expression uh the
[15:07] intensity with which we align with
[15:09] certain causes or the certain things
[15:11] that we give voice to even the restraint
[15:13] of words and conduct this was done so
[15:15] that he wouldn't stir up unnecessary
[15:18] opposition to himself
[15:20] he was already different
[15:22] he's gonna he already had gentiles
[15:24] wouldn't like him and the jews were
[15:25] wanting to kill him after he was
[15:26] converted so he realized look i'm
[15:28] preaching a controversial gospel i'm
[15:30] preaching things that go against the
[15:32] status quo of my organization the
[15:33] denominations and the prevailing word
[15:36] for that are the traditions of that day
[15:38] and there's been a revelation come and
[15:40] i've received this revelation and i'm
[15:42] already on the wrong side with these
[15:44] guys
[15:45] and if i act in a way to where they can
[15:46] put me in this camp or put me in that
[15:48] camp if i can if i act the wrong way
[15:50] where i offend their sensibilities it's
[15:52] only going to make it even harder for
[15:54] them to receive what i'm saying so i'm
[15:56] going to i'm going to be very careful
[15:58] i'm going to be very careful the way
[15:59] that i live and the way that i act so
[16:01] that i don't stir up opposition against
[16:03] myself because ultimately that would be
[16:06] against the word
[16:08] they could hate he's like hey they could
[16:09] hate me as an ambassador i got thick
[16:11] skin i can handle it and bless god i
[16:13] don't care what other people think
[16:15] and and here he has this attitude but
[16:17] then christ is saying well what about me
[16:20] because if they reject you you're my
[16:22] ambassador how else if they reject you
[16:24] how else are they going to hear hear
[16:26] what i'm trying to say to them so if you
[16:28] rejected for the cause of christ or for
[16:30] the word's sake hey
[16:32] we've been taught that that's going to
[16:33] happen but if we if we're venturing into
[16:36] areas of india where it should be
[16:38] indifferent if we're venturing into
[16:40] areas where god doesn't have a say on it
[16:42] but we're very dogmatic about it we're
[16:44] hindering the cause of christ
[16:47] so he did not want to
[16:49] rile up opposition or even offend or
[16:52] stir up other people's sensitivities if
[16:54] by chance it would kill his influence
[16:57] and i think that's just a review for us
[16:59] as we've been
[17:00] looking at first corinthians chapters 9
[17:03] and 10 and places in romans
[17:06] in philippians chapter 1 verses 12 to 17
[17:11] i had
[17:13] had this in my notes for all the
[17:14] services
[17:17] but it just seemed like it wasn't
[17:18] fitting
[17:20] and and i was weighing it last night and
[17:22] i thought well where is it gonna you
[17:24] know should i just cut it out again
[17:26] i felt like the lord just placed it here
[17:29] he says i but i would i would you should
[17:31] understand brethren that the things
[17:33] which happened unto me have fallen out
[17:35] rather unto the furtherance of the
[17:38] gospel there's a lot of things that we
[17:39] could identify that were happening to
[17:42] him but yet paul recognizes
[17:44] that these things were happening for the
[17:46] benefit and the best of the gospel paul
[17:48] wasn't being imprisoned for selling
[17:50] drugs he wasn't being imprisoned for
[17:52] human trafficking uh paul was in prison
[17:55] these things that were happening to him
[17:56] were because he was advocating for
[17:58] christ so he felt like hey if it's
[17:59] happening while i'm advocating for
[18:00] christ if i go to jail i'm not serving a
[18:02] sentence i'm serving a purpose
[18:04] and so that was the attitude that he had
[18:07] then he identifies something very
[18:08] peculiar so that my bonds in christ are
[18:10] manifested in all the palace and in all
[18:12] other places
[18:14] and and this is
[18:16] it's verse 14 where the peculiarities to
[18:18] me begin but that's
[18:20] amplifying how that i'm a prisoner for
[18:22] christ and guess what's happening i'm
[18:24] declaring this everywhere i go
[18:26] he's given him a a particular audience
[18:28] now he says and many of the brethren and
[18:30] the lord waxing confident by my bonds
[18:33] are much more bold to speak the word
[18:34] without fear
[18:36] and so this was actually a causing son
[18:38] to be like you know what let's preach it
[18:40] and let's just lay the word out there
[18:42] and and paul took this took this on and
[18:46] and he suffered this then then we can do
[18:48] it also and there's actually a reading
[18:50] of this that implies that there were
[18:51] some people saying oh good now that
[18:52] paul's locked up we can preach
[18:56] you're like oh good now that we don't
[18:57] have to worry about him coming around
[18:58] and messing things up we can preach
[19:00] because then he says some indeed preach
[19:02] christ even of envy and strife and some
[19:05] also of good will the one preached
[19:07] christ of contention not sincerely
[19:09] supposing to add affliction to my bonds
[19:13] so he's actually identifying the fact
[19:14] that here i am i am in prison because i
[19:18] preach the gospel and i believe that
[19:20] this has happened for the furtherance of
[19:21] the gospel but now there are people who
[19:24] are more bold to preach because now i've
[19:26] been thrown in prison and they're not
[19:27] being sincere about it they preach
[19:29] because they're jealous
[19:30] and they're doing it to add affliction
[19:32] to my bonds
[19:35] so they don't have the right motive in
[19:37] preaching the gospel in that in that
[19:38] sense he said the other of love
[19:42] knowing he says that i am set for the
[19:44] defense of the gospel
[19:47] that there is then some preaching in the
[19:49] right way with the right motive
[19:51] but he says that there's those that
[19:52] recognize the asset for the defense of
[19:54] the gospel what was his concern the
[19:56] furtherance of the gospel
[19:58] and paul in doing this is refuting any
[20:00] assertion that he was preaching the
[20:02] gospel for his own glory
[20:04] he's refuted this contention oh paul you
[20:06] were just doing to make a name for
[20:07] yourself you just wanted to carve out
[20:08] your own niche you just wanted to have a
[20:09] following this was a meal ticket this
[20:11] was a money grab he's refuting any
[20:13] assertion that he sought his own glory
[20:15] and preaching the gospel but he says i
[20:16] am set for the defense of the gospel
[20:19] apologia that's where we get the term
[20:22] apologetics
[20:23] apology is a reason statement or
[20:25] argument to to give an apologia uh to be
[20:29] set for the defenses to give a full
[20:30] account of
[20:32] now there's those that take this
[20:33] scripture and say that paul was set for
[20:35] the defense of the gospel they take
[20:37] apologia and there's this whole kind of
[20:40] discipline within christianity of
[20:42] apologetics that means i am set to
[20:44] explain everything in the bible
[20:47] i am set to explain any paradox any
[20:50] inconsistency i want to be able to
[20:52] rightly divide the word of truth and be
[20:54] able to lay out everything in such a way
[20:55] to where every truth can be explained
[20:57] perfectly in a language that could cause
[20:59] someone to say i see it i understand it
[21:01] there's there's an inherent danger in
[21:04] becoming apologetics because then you
[21:06] leave out the element of faith that many
[21:08] times god says things in a puzzling way
[21:10] so that faith completes the puzzle
[21:12] but apologetics seek to find every peace
[21:15] turn it around the right way and make a
[21:16] perfect picture of their own discipline
[21:18] and effort in the word of god and
[21:20] studying context and language and and
[21:23] all those different things
[21:24] but paul is is not making the argument
[21:26] that i'm set for the defense of the
[21:28] gospel in that i'm i'm apologizing for
[21:31] it or i'm trying to explain it or i'm
[21:33] just trying to reason with you to
[21:34] convince you but rather i am set for the
[21:37] defense of the gospel but not primarily
[21:40] not a defense of himself
[21:43] oh he's refuting his contention oh well
[21:45] you know paul just is in it for his own
[21:48] good he said no i'm set for the defense
[21:49] of the gospel i'm not in this for my own
[21:51] gain as a matter of fact everything i'm
[21:53] doing i'm doing in christ's stead not
[21:55] that i can have a name and be
[21:56] memorialized but that others might be
[21:58] saved
[21:59] so he's identifying his motive that's
[22:01] important number one to recognize that
[22:03] others preach out of envy and some
[22:05] strife and some condition contention
[22:07] others for filthy lucr and we rejoice
[22:09] that the gospel is being preached but
[22:11] he's saying they're preaching from the
[22:12] wrong reasons i'm preaching because my
[22:14] burden is actually for people to hear
[22:16] the word and receive it
[22:19] but then it's also carries with it this
[22:21] also that may not necessarily double
[22:23] meaning but this is assumed in the
[22:25] meaning my i am set for the defense of
[22:27] the gospel not myself so in fact he's
[22:29] saying my life in my manner of life in
[22:32] my living and my preaching is an
[22:34] argument for the gospel
[22:37] i'm not just trying to reason with your
[22:38] carnal mind and sit down and explain it
[22:40] to you and get you to accept it and
[22:41] prove it
[22:43] and and i'm not trying to prove it or
[22:45] explain it but i am set as an argument i
[22:48] am set as an advocate for the benefits
[22:50] of the gospel the blessings of the
[22:52] gospel i am set as an advocate who
[22:54] desires to see the gospel successful so
[22:56] my life and my thoughts and my actions
[22:58] are an argument for it to compel you to
[23:01] receive it not explain it to you so you
[23:03] can say oh yeah that makes sense
[23:06] does that make sense i can try to
[23:08] explain it to you
[23:10] but i trust you can ex catch kind of
[23:12] what paul is saying by pondering that
[23:14] word if it's a reasoned statement or
[23:16] argument i am set as an argument for the
[23:18] gospel how paul not by not by giving
[23:21] everybody what david said and typing
[23:23] this out showing the hebrews and
[23:24] everything but my life i'm in bonds
[23:27] because i preach the gospel let my
[23:28] character my conduct the way that i
[23:30] handle these adversities speak
[23:33] of the gospel of christ
[23:36] so now i want to take a few moments or i
[23:40] am going to take a few moments to touch
[23:42] on a couple things
[23:44] and in doing so i want to i want to
[23:46] identify the balance related to this i
[23:49] am as he says i am i please all men and
[23:51] all things i become all things to all
[23:53] men
[23:54] and the balance in that and the
[23:55] discernment because we're really
[23:57] challenging you
[23:59] to
[24:00] not get caught up in
[24:02] carnal things and get caught up in
[24:04] things that sound like that sounds like
[24:06] the shepherd but it's not the shepherd
[24:08] but to to
[24:09] but to moderate ourselves so that we can
[24:11] be effective witnesses of the gospel
[24:13] to be careful that we're keeping
[24:15] ourselves pure and unsolely to the
[24:16] things of the world and ideas and
[24:18] opinions that can really agitate us so
[24:20] that we can express christ in the right
[24:23] way that can be effective witness to
[24:24] others and we would decide that then
[24:26] others would hear the word and be saved
[24:29] and and as that kind of maybe that's a
[24:31] those are the things we've been
[24:32] preaching becomes kind of like a blow
[24:34] and uh tearing certain things down or
[24:36] trying to soften us up
[24:38] i recognize that it could be easy to be
[24:42] kind of pushed over into this other area
[24:44] where just kind of wishy-washy pushovers
[24:46] oh it doesn't really matter and we think
[24:48] just by being sappy right
[24:51] and just being sweet and kind you know
[24:53] that others like others will want what
[24:55] we have but there needs to be a balance
[24:58] there's a balance to this it wasn't paul
[24:59] i'm going to be sweet to everybody i'm
[25:01] just going to love everybody i'm doesn't
[25:02] really matter attitude no he had a he
[25:04] had a real
[25:06] solid foundation in the word that guided
[25:08] him so i want to talk about a balance
[25:09] and a discernment
[25:11] because paul's approach is not
[25:13] compromising
[25:14] there was no compromise in paul's
[25:16] approach and it certainly was not
[25:17] weakness
[25:19] there was not fear on paul's part paul
[25:21] did not go you know i'm going to walk
[25:23] real lightly around these guys because
[25:24] they might stone me or they might throw
[25:26] me in prison no paul was very discerning
[25:28] in situations and knew in this situation
[25:31] this is what i'm in christ's stead this
[25:33] is what i need to do i'm in this
[25:35] situation this is what i need to do and
[25:37] he's very careful to know
[25:39] when to speak and how to
[25:40] speak he used this discernment he was
[25:43] very balanced this sweet this meekness
[25:45] of christ it's this balance of christ
[25:47] that he achieved and that's what we need
[25:49] in our lives is the true meekness of
[25:51] christ
[25:52] i was pondering this and and maybe this
[25:55] might flow into a and actually a sermon
[25:58] or maybe uh um some preaching on and it
[26:00] could happen right now if you pulled
[26:02] hard enough
[26:03] but a lot of us like the fact that
[26:06] christ is a lion
[26:08] right
[26:09] and we have the spirit of christ and so
[26:11] the nature of a lion the nature of
[26:13] christ and and that that overcomer and
[26:16] that one with the flaming sword and
[26:18] riding on this horse and this mighty
[26:20] conqueror and we see these attributes of
[26:22] jesus christ and we really really love
[26:24] that and we think oh my yes that's what
[26:26] i am i'm the warrior he's the warrior
[26:28] christ i'm a warrior i'm a warrior for
[26:30] christ and we like to envision ourselves
[26:31] as a lion but let me just say this you
[26:33] have no right to be aligned until you
[26:34] first wear a lamb
[26:37] and so your your your training and your
[26:40] discipline you cannot properly be the
[26:42] line until you know fully how to be the
[26:44] lamb
[26:46] and and i mean that in the truest sense
[26:47] that we must have that nature of the
[26:49] lamb and work in that office of the lamb
[26:52] not that we would shed our physical
[26:54] blood but it's a life of sacrifice and
[26:56] the yielding to christ in this sweet
[26:58] reasonable reasonableness of christ and
[27:00] this meekness of christ and once we've
[27:02] learned to be the lamb it becomes almost
[27:04] second nature paradoxically to be the
[27:07] lion
[27:09] and it'll be
[27:10] channeled the right way
[27:11] there must be a balance now notice
[27:13] notice these things we might be kind of
[27:14] dropping back a little bit and it might
[27:16] even find a different gear because this
[27:18] is really just more teaching identifying
[27:20] some things here in galatians chapter 2.
[27:22] i want to read through it maybe as we go
[27:24] through it i can expound upon it or
[27:25] maybe when we're done i might just make
[27:26] a few points in this reading galatians
[27:28] chapter 2 verses 11 to 14.
[27:31] but when peter was come to antioch i
[27:34] withstood him to the face
[27:36] because he was to be blamed so now you
[27:39] know this uh becoming all things to all
[27:41] men didn't apply anymore when it came to
[27:43] peter
[27:44] i mean we're reading about paul saying
[27:46] well i don't want to offend anybody and
[27:47] if somebody's a certain way i don't want
[27:48] to offend their sensibilities and you
[27:50] know kind of do this and do that and so
[27:52] this is i'm looking at another side of
[27:55] this ministry to where we see that it
[27:57] wasn't like paul just in every instance
[28:01] you know just i'm going to keep my mouth
[28:02] shut and keep my head down here is a
[28:04] situation where peter wasn't allowed
[28:06] really to be peter but he was stood up
[28:08] to his face
[28:10] he says for before that certain came
[28:12] from james
[28:13] he did eat with the gentiles that
[28:15] certain being peter
[28:16] he did eat with the gentiles but when
[28:19] they were come the the the jews
[28:22] he withdrew and separated himself
[28:24] fearing them which are of the
[28:25] circumcision peter
[28:28] this is so on brand for peter
[28:33] he he did eat with the gentiles but when
[28:35] they were come he withdrew and separated
[28:37] himself fearing them which of the
[28:38] circumcision and the other jews
[28:40] disassembled likewise with them so peter
[28:42] influences these other jews in so much
[28:44] that barnabas also was carried away with
[28:47] their dissimulation dissembled the
[28:49] simulation is hypocrisy
[28:52] they were they become hypocritical and
[28:54] even barnabas was carried away with his
[28:55] hypocrisy he says but when i saw that
[28:57] they walked not uprightly according to
[29:00] notice what he's defending the truth of
[29:02] the gospel
[29:03] to those who ought to have known better
[29:05] i said unto peter before them alls when
[29:08] he says i withstood them to the face
[29:11] right
[29:12] got right up in his face
[29:14] and in front of everybody
[29:16] if thou being a jew live us after the
[29:19] manner of gentiles and not as do the
[29:21] jews
[29:22] why compel us thou the gentiles to live
[29:24] as do the jews
[29:26] calling out a little bit of hypocrisy
[29:28] right
[29:29] i mean he's saying well wait a minute
[29:30] you're trying to force gentiles
[29:34] into circumcision or you're trying to
[29:35] force them to adopt these peculiarities
[29:37] of the of the jewish church there in
[29:39] jerusalem
[29:40] but yet
[29:41] i mean i i know you've behaved otherwise
[29:44] around gentiles
[29:46] and so paul rebukes peter because of
[29:48] hypocrisy
[29:50] and most importantly as you can see as
[29:52] he's calling it out and this is to me
[29:53] what connects so beautifully with what
[29:55] he's talking about in first corinthians
[29:56] 9 10 is he's actually calling peter out
[29:59] for acting against his own conscience
[30:02] like peter come on
[30:04] you know better you've confessed
[30:06] differently you're acting against your
[30:08] own conscience like it's not that your
[30:10] your conscience offends you or your
[30:12] conscience is telling you you shouldn't
[30:14] be doing this you actually are doing
[30:16] something your conscience is saying wait
[30:17] a minute
[30:19] like he's not acting with his conscience
[30:21] he's acting against it and against the
[30:23] gospel
[30:24] so when paul invokes the gospel he says
[30:26] hey they're hypocritical and not walking
[30:29] uprightly he's looking at a word
[30:31] principle according to the gospel
[30:33] and so i just to try to convey this as
[30:37] you read it i find that there's a lot in
[30:39] this that you read over it and i don't
[30:41] really have the time to read the other
[30:43] places to fully amplify it but peter ate
[30:46] with the gentiles
[30:48] when he was with the gentiles
[30:50] and when he was with the gentiles he ate
[30:52] with them not according to jewish
[30:53] customs so he ate whatever was served
[30:56] so here's peter eating things
[30:58] that and eating with gentiles so he's
[31:00] acting in a way that a true jew wouldn't
[31:02] have he wouldn't even sat down to be
[31:05] with him or in their house or he
[31:06] wouldn't have eaten their food there's a
[31:08] lot of different ways that maybe peter
[31:09] was taking liberty and what he was
[31:12] expressing is that i
[31:14] am free in christ
[31:16] no longer bound under the law therefore
[31:18] it does not condemn my conscience nor am
[31:20] i guilty of the law to eat with the
[31:23] gentiles to sit in their home and to eat
[31:25] these things offered by the gentiles i'm
[31:27] free in christ
[31:28] so here's peter away from all his jewish
[31:31] buddies
[31:32] away from jerusalem hanging out with the
[31:34] gentiles and it's like almost as what
[31:37] happens in vegas stays in vegas
[31:40] when in rome do as the romans because
[31:42] then when he comes back around or when
[31:44] the jews come around he starts actingly
[31:46] different acting differently
[31:48] but not acting differently for the right
[31:50] reasons it wasn't peter saying ooh i've
[31:52] got to be razor sharp here because i
[31:53] need to convince these jews i need to i
[31:55] want to win these jews no these jews
[31:57] were believers
[31:59] but yeah they wanted to mix in judaic
[32:01] tradition with christianity and bring
[32:03] bondage as it related to the the liberty
[32:05] and christ and the bible is telling us
[32:07] that he was afraid he was fearful
[32:11] of them that were of the circumcision he
[32:12] was fear he feared and felt the peer
[32:14] pressure from the brothers from
[32:16] jerusalem
[32:18] and because he feels this peer pressure
[32:20] from these other guys in the message or
[32:22] these other people neither sensitivities
[32:24] or not their sensitivities but their i
[32:27] know i wanted to say proclivity but that
[32:28] could be your word for the day uh uh uh
[32:30] what the
[32:31] you know their agenda
[32:34] and their slant
[32:35] or their spin he's real sensitive to it
[32:38] and he gets caught up in their cause
[32:41] and then when he does that he draws
[32:43] others into his hypocrisy
[32:45] sweeps up some of these other jews
[32:47] christians now and barnabas
[32:50] oh this is my sidekick this is my
[32:52] co-pastor this is this is my right hand
[32:54] man and he even got swept of it when he
[32:56] ought to know better and paul's rebuke
[32:58] is why compel the jews to to gentiles to
[33:01] live as jews in order to enjoy the full
[33:03] christian rights and it was compelling
[33:05] them why compel the gentiles to live as
[33:07] a jew in order to take communion
[33:10] when you peter being a jew
[33:13] felt you were free to live as a gentile
[33:17] this was a burn i mean immediately after
[33:19] this the melody was applied
[33:22] because he really he really gets them
[33:24] now you're going to compel
[33:26] gentiles to live as jews in order to
[33:28] take the communion but you've testified
[33:31] and represented that in christ you were
[33:32] free to live as a gentile
[33:35] now i'm not going to get caught up in
[33:37] the argument and be pro-peter or
[33:38] pro-paul
[33:40] but this shows there's a time for
[33:41] boldness
[33:43] it shows there's a time when there's
[33:45] it's necessary to have plainness of
[33:46] speech
[33:48] this was a rebuke by paul the same one
[33:49] who said i became all things to all men
[33:51] that the gospel might succeed and i
[33:53] might win others to christ here was a
[33:54] scenario where peter knew better and
[33:56] confessed differently these other jewish
[33:57] better brothers were in a different
[33:59] category confessing maybe taking the
[34:01] message and twisting it just a little
[34:02] bit it was a different approach in that
[34:05] context of brethren in fellowship
[34:07] together to where he wasn't just to push
[34:09] over and had to keep his mouth shut
[34:10] because i'm an ambassador for christ and
[34:12] brother aaron said we can't say anything
[34:14] no i'm talking about being balanced in
[34:16] the true liberty of christ and using
[34:18] discernment
[34:20] so that you can be effective
[34:22] because paul in his principle of being
[34:25] an ambassador for christ and being in
[34:27] christ's dead he says that writing to
[34:29] the corinthians who knew full well paul
[34:32] knew how to write a diss track
[34:35] right
[34:35] i mean his first corinthians let him
[34:38] have it
[34:39] and he told him hey this is this is what
[34:41] you've been doing wrong and this is how
[34:43] you failed and this is what you got to
[34:44] do to clean it up even to where
[34:46] afterwards paul felt like whoa i came on
[34:47] real strong hey i hope everything's okay
[34:49] i don't really need to apologize for
[34:51] what i said but i want to condescend
[34:52] myself a little bit to you to let you
[34:53] know that i love you and i'm your
[34:55] brother and we did this for the sake of
[34:56] the gospel for your own benefit for the
[34:58] one that was sinning and i feel that
[34:59] everything's been done so i don't feel
[35:00] like any anything's wrong between us but
[35:02] paul wrote this letter this letter of
[35:04] rebuke to the corinthians why because in
[35:07] christ's stead
[35:09] in in the context of relationship
[35:11] there's going to be times that you need
[35:12] to speak
[35:15] and it is because of these times that we
[35:17] don't want to diminish our voice
[35:19] it is because of those times we do not
[35:21] want our voice to be ineffective because
[35:24] i am going to have to speak as the final
[35:26] voice i am going to have to rebuke i am
[35:28] going to need to correct there's going
[35:29] to be times where i need to use
[35:30] discernment and as it were i'm going to
[35:32] have to be in christ's dead not uh not
[35:35] be insensitive to not promote provoke
[35:38] someone's agitation but to be sensitive
[35:40] to the cause of christ to say this is
[35:42] what the word of god says
[35:45] now's the time to speak and when it
[35:47] comes time to speak we do not want to
[35:49] have diminished the capacity of our
[35:51] voice to be effective because we're
[35:53] always yapping
[35:55] we always got something to say we always
[35:57] got our two cents we always got
[35:59] something we can weigh in on an opinion
[36:01] we can give
[36:03] and if you want to say wow brother aaron
[36:04] how can you be so suspiciously specific
[36:08] i've lived my life
[36:10] i don't know what kind of person i am
[36:13] i i know i know how i i i have a cringe
[36:16] moment every every day of every week
[36:18] when i just think about my past oh in my
[36:20] recent past like man well you really
[36:21] just felt like everyone needed to know
[36:23] that
[36:24] and i did was it really necessary that
[36:26] you weigh in on well really what this is
[36:28] and
[36:29] can i can i just have a moment of
[36:31] confession you guys are going to laugh
[36:32] at this all right
[36:36] pause the stream
[36:39] after wednesday night service get this
[36:42] we're just family here right should i
[36:43] come should i walk out in front of the
[36:44] pulpit so i'm just
[36:46] this isn't this is an act of
[36:48] confession
[36:50] after wednesday night service i went
[36:51] home
[36:53] and i debated economic policy with my
[36:55] family for an hour
[36:59] i'm quoting fisher ames and the
[37:01] federalist papers and we're arguing
[37:02] about what the strength of the the 13
[37:04] colonies was and what
[37:06] we're debating economic policy as a
[37:09] family just after i preached for an hour
[37:11] and a half
[37:13] right
[37:14] on not doing that
[37:16] so
[37:17] it has been forever since my first
[37:19] confession these are my sins
[37:23] and uh forgive me and pray for me
[37:26] i never had a priest applaud a
[37:28] confession before
[37:31] but so if i if i seem to have kind of a
[37:34] real beat on the nature of this i don't
[37:36] have to go any further than my own
[37:38] example to realize that there's a lot of
[37:40] ways we can give voice to certain things
[37:43] that when it comes time to speak they
[37:45] think
[37:46] this is just another instance where this
[37:49] person's wanting to weigh in on
[37:51] something
[37:56] now if you look at galatians chapter 2 i
[37:59] think we're already there so this
[38:00] wouldn't be too hard to do this but now
[38:02] look at the other side of this or the
[38:04] kind of the thing that started this
[38:05] conversation with peter
[38:07] different circumstances can require a
[38:09] different approach
[38:11] but what i want you to recognize is that
[38:12] the goal is always the same
[38:15] and these are scriptural examples of how
[38:16] actions were inspired by what was best
[38:19] to promote the gospel in other words
[38:20] what was done in this circumstance was
[38:22] done with the idea that we're doing this
[38:24] for christ we're doing this for the
[38:26] benefit of the lost we're doing this
[38:28] that we might in some way intervene in
[38:30] this situation and act as an
[38:33] intermediary of the gospel so a person
[38:35] can be saved
[38:37] and in galatians chapter 2 verses 1 to 5
[38:39] we were just reading in
[38:41] 11 to 14 and this is kind of the preface
[38:43] to that but notice the subject matter
[38:45] then 14 years after i went up again to
[38:47] jerusalem with barnabas and this is
[38:49] where barnabas got you know hanging out
[38:51] with peter and got uh gave into peer
[38:54] pressure he took titus i took titus with
[38:56] me also
[38:57] and i went up by revelation and
[38:59] communicated unto them that gospel which
[39:02] i preached among the gentiles but
[39:04] privately to them which were reputation
[39:07] lest by any means i should run or had
[39:09] run in vain and this was a very humble
[39:10] move on his part that i went and i met
[39:13] with elders i met with those of
[39:14] reputation and i shared with them
[39:16] privately what i'd been doing with the
[39:18] gentiles so as to share it with them so
[39:21] that they could share in their hearts
[39:22] whether it bore witness with their
[39:24] spirit
[39:25] and he says notice this now in verse
[39:27] three but neither titus who was with me
[39:30] being a greek was compelled to be
[39:32] circumcised
[39:34] so he shows up with the jews
[39:36] and uh
[39:38] when i say it he shows i'm gonna move on
[39:40] actually brother joel sent me a picture
[39:42] of the day and it was a picture of a
[39:43] leather jacket and on the back of the
[39:44] leather jacket it said uh
[39:47] a fellow of the bait a lewd fellow of
[39:48] the baser sword was the this was on the
[39:51] back of the jacket i was like well we'll
[39:53] probably find him at jason's house later
[39:55] and uh and so i was thinking of just the
[39:58] crew right so the paul comes back with
[40:01] with the uh a greek titus and he's
[40:03] hanging out with his jewish brethren who
[40:05] would be of the circumcision and we're
[40:08] wrestling with these ideas that if these
[40:09] gentiles are going to partake in
[40:11] christian communion should they adopt
[40:13] our circumcision should they adopt our
[40:15] policies as jews but he says titus
[40:18] wasn't compelled to be circumcised
[40:21] because after paul expressed how the
[40:23] gospel was being affected with the
[40:24] gentiles the jews then do not compel him
[40:26] to be circumcised he says and that
[40:27] because the false brethren unawares
[40:29] brought in who came in privileged to spy
[40:31] out our liberty which we have in christ
[40:34] that they might bring us in into bondage
[40:37] so he's saying look listen
[40:38] paul
[40:39] titus was not circumcised because any
[40:42] effort to circumcise him would would be
[40:45] for the cause of bringing us back into
[40:47] bondage it'd be to make a point oh you
[40:49] brought this
[40:50] uncircumcised greek into here we need to
[40:52] circumcise them but it's false brethren
[40:56] who are promoting this message within
[40:58] the church or within the believers
[41:00] saying oh well you need to circumcise
[41:01] them can you do this you need to do that
[41:02] he can't really be a true believer
[41:03] unless he's done this and paul said
[41:05] they're kind of trying to take the
[41:06] liberty which we have in christ and
[41:08] bring him into bondage he says to whom
[41:10] we gave place by subjection no not for
[41:13] an hour in other words i didn't give
[41:14] them any time
[41:16] i told him no i don't want to hear from
[41:18] you that the truth of the gospel might
[41:20] continue with you
[41:21] why did paul in this instance not force
[41:24] titus to be circumcised because the
[41:27] emphasis or the attempt was for the
[41:29] wrong motives and objectives but then
[41:31] also paul in withstanding it did so so
[41:34] that the truth of the gospel might
[41:36] continue
[41:37] so here's an instance where paul says no
[41:39] you're not going to circumcise titus and
[41:41] he makes his stand and withstands them
[41:44] and titus is not compelled to be
[41:45] circumcised and paul cites the liberty
[41:48] of christ he cites the cause of christ
[41:50] and that the gospel might continue
[41:53] but in acts chapter 16 verses 1 to 5.
[41:56] this will be a very quick reading
[41:59] then came he to derby and lystra and
[42:01] behold a certain disciple was there
[42:02] named timotheus the son of a certain
[42:04] woman which was a jewish and believed
[42:06] but his father was a greek so
[42:09] a jewish mother married a greek man so
[42:12] they have a son who is in a mixed
[42:15] a faith home and we understand the
[42:17] testimony of his grandmother lois who
[42:20] converts the daughter then timothy gets
[42:21] converted
[42:22] but it says which was well reported of
[42:24] by the brethren that where we're at
[42:25] lystra and iconium
[42:27] these are all cities in galatia he says
[42:29] him would paul have to go forth with him
[42:33] so here's another greek
[42:35] timothy
[42:37] he's going to go with paul but notice
[42:39] what paul says and took and circumcised
[42:42] him because of the jews which were in
[42:44] those quarters
[42:47] what
[42:48] titus doesn't have to be circumcised
[42:51] and then
[42:52] but
[42:53] james or timothy does
[42:56] could you imagine what timothy said
[42:57] later wait what
[42:59] huh
[43:00] you're a what
[43:02] and it seems like it's the same audience
[43:05] titus didn't have to because jews wanted
[43:06] him to but now timothy has been
[43:08] circumcised because of jews that are in
[43:10] those quarters for they knew all that
[43:12] his father was a greek and as though and
[43:14] as they but then this is the point here
[43:15] i'm getting getting ahead of myself
[43:17] so timothy is circumcised because of
[43:20] jews titus is not circumcised because of
[43:22] jews i think you already recognized the
[43:24] difference the jews were wanting him to
[43:25] in order that he would align with this
[43:27] kind of hybrid faith within the message
[43:29] but now timothy is circumcised because
[43:32] of jews but now these aren't necessarily
[43:35] converted jews these are jews that they
[43:37] want the gospel to have effective
[43:38] witness with and they don't want the
[43:40] fact that here's timothy
[43:42] uncircumcised preaching to jews the
[43:44] gospel and what are they going to say
[43:48] i'm going to listen to you
[43:50] why would we listen to you you haven't
[43:52] even accepted you're not even a jew why
[43:54] would i accept the gospel from you
[43:56] fulfilling our prophecies the messiah to
[44:00] israel the redeemer that was to come as
[44:02] prophesied by isaiah and is spoken of by
[44:04] david and you're a greek uncircumcised
[44:07] yeah you really believe this gospel yeah
[44:09] you really are an ardent follower and
[44:11] maybe just kind of vamping a little bit
[44:13] on how they would have acted and
[44:14] ad-libbing a little bit on the
[44:15] conversation but paul recognizing the
[44:18] uniqueness of the dynamics has timothy
[44:20] to be circumcised and then it says as
[44:22] they went through the cities they
[44:24] delivered them the decrees for to keep
[44:26] that were ordained of the apostles and
[44:28] elders which were at jerusalem and so
[44:30] were the churches established in the
[44:32] faith and increased in number daily
[44:36] to all those new christians that were
[44:39] jews and to anyone that would be
[44:41] converted and in particular as paul is
[44:43] even relating to here i hope that wasn't
[44:45] lost in the in the ad-libbing
[44:47] new converts to christ who were jews
[44:50] could be sensitive to a gentile telling
[44:52] them what to do
[44:54] so then timothy becomes one who is fully
[44:56] converted
[44:57] in their eyes right apostle like to the
[45:00] jewish faith who's now preaching the
[45:02] gospel so in this instance an opposite
[45:06] approach is required
[45:08] then when titus came to jerusalem
[45:12] so what may be wrong under one set of
[45:14] circumstances
[45:15] may be right under another
[45:21] but what was the primary concern
[45:24] what was the deciding factor in each one
[45:26] of these instances that the truth of the
[45:28] gospel might continue on that churches
[45:30] be established in the faith
[45:34] it was the effectiveness of the gospel
[45:35] that determined in a matter which was
[45:37] indifferent you weren't going to be a
[45:38] sinner if you were circumcised you
[45:40] certainly weren't going to be a sinner
[45:41] if you remained uncircumcised but yet a
[45:42] sacrifice was required
[45:45] in each one of these instances something
[45:47] needed to be specifically done and it
[45:49] and and kind of the the the
[45:52] the modus operandi or the thing that was
[45:54] offered in the back of the minds that
[45:55] motivated them to do what they were
[45:56] doing was how can we be the most
[45:58] effective witness to our audience how
[46:00] can we achieve salvation how can we
[46:02] stand for truth how is it i need to act
[46:04] in this situation and become something
[46:07] to my audience so that they will hear
[46:09] what i have to say how can and it's not
[46:11] to say ingratiating yourself or or or
[46:14] being sly or slick or being a good
[46:16] salesman but it's avoiding unnecessary
[46:18] distractions or contentions so that the
[46:21] truth the real truth can be advocated
[46:23] for
[46:26] it would have been wrong to die on the
[46:27] mountain of circumcision with timothy
[46:29] and you show up with timothy and
[46:30] somebody objects and the argument is all
[46:32] about well you're trying to make this
[46:33] man you're trying to bring this defiled
[46:36] greek and dartmouth who's uncircumcised
[46:38] and then paul wants to blast them oh
[46:40] you're really not free in christ you're
[46:41] really not believers because if you were
[46:42] you wouldn't judge him and you would
[46:44] just let it go and this big blow up
[46:46] happen he says you know what i got i got
[46:48] a way that we can just get right past
[46:50] this
[46:51] i'll just agree
[46:52] we'll just go along with it but then he
[46:54] recognizes in jerusalem no this is this
[46:56] is this is turning now this isn't
[46:58] something be established this isn't a
[46:59] way to promote the health of the gospel
[47:01] and see that churches are established
[47:02] now i'm in jerusalem with people who
[47:04] should know better
[47:05] and there's these brothers that are
[47:06] trying to spy out our liberty trying to
[47:08] bring us back into bondage and there's a
[47:09] movement that's coming up and paul's
[47:11] saying no wait a minute
[47:13] wait a minute we're not going there
[47:16] because you could say well brother aaron
[47:17] in your last few services maybe you
[47:19] should have taken a page from your own
[47:20] sermon and not said the things you said
[47:22] no i think there's a time to speak
[47:27] so the guiding principle
[47:29] was the promotion of the gospel and that
[47:30] should be the guiding principle of our
[47:32] actions
[47:33] this this is a guiding principle of our
[47:35] interactions and yes i'm primarily
[47:36] speaking about uh maybe interactions
[47:39] with people that we don't have a daily
[47:41] intimate relationship with but this
[47:43] thing would not only relate to
[47:45] interactions with unbelievers but it
[47:46] guides the relationships we have among
[47:48] ourselves
[47:50] how am i promoting the effectiveness of
[47:51] the gospel in your life brother how am i
[47:53] promoting the effectiveness of the
[47:54] gospel in your life son or daughter this
[47:56] is something that we ought to think
[47:57] about is we keep in mind our
[48:00] this is this is guiding us in terms of
[48:03] our voice what we say our word our
[48:05] actions what we do our example
[48:08] this is our advocacy for christ
[48:14] in romans chapter 14 you find that
[48:17] i when i was looking at it yesterday i
[48:19] was like i want to read the whole thing
[48:21] and it's about christian liberty
[48:24] and as you read it's kind of like won't
[48:25] won't it just seems to be this thing
[48:27] going over here you know him that is
[48:28] weak in the face receiving without
[48:30] doubting one that believes may eat all
[48:31] things and one who's weak and it just
[48:33] keeps it's almost like he's just saying
[48:34] you know why judge this and one who
[48:36] esteems another day over another you
[48:37] know every man be fully persuaded in his
[48:39] own mind he's just treading down this
[48:41] path but then he comes to verse 13 let
[48:43] us not therefore judge one another
[48:45] anymore
[48:47] let's just not judge anyone each other
[48:49] anymore in these different things let's
[48:51] just not judge one another anymore
[48:53] and he says
[48:56] but judge this rather
[48:58] that no man put a stumbling block or an
[49:01] occasion to fall in his brother's way
[49:04] what uh what profound words
[49:07] this is very very good that i'm going to
[49:09] ask myself in my christian liberty
[49:11] because paul was saying we have this
[49:13] christian liberty and then he begins to
[49:14] talk about her accountability but he's
[49:16] saying i have this christian liberty but
[49:18] as a christian as i exercise my liberty
[49:20] there is accountability for the way that
[49:22] i behave with this liberty as paul
[49:24] pointed out in first corinthians yeah
[49:25] all things are lawful all things uh um i
[49:28] can do there's no law against these
[49:30] things but is it all expedient to
[49:32] benefit somebody else
[49:34] because remember the context for even
[49:35] that statement it didn't relate
[49:36] necessarily alone to his own perfection
[49:39] but the effectiveness of his witness and
[49:40] the gospel upon others there's a lot of
[49:42] things i can do but i won't do them so
[49:45] that the gospel of christ can be
[49:46] promoted in its purity
[49:48] that'll cause confusion i don't pursue
[49:50] my own ideas and do the things that i
[49:52] want to and he said now let's not judge
[49:54] anybody anymore but judge ourselves and
[49:56] judge this rather that in my eating and
[49:58] in my drinking am i living in my acting
[50:00] in my going in all my recreation and
[50:02] everything i say and do i don't want to
[50:05] put a stumbling block in front of
[50:06] another person or an occasion to fall in
[50:10] a brother's way these are very big words
[50:13] to be a stumbling block to be an
[50:15] occasion to fall it's a language that is
[50:17] akin of those that would commit the
[50:19] worst travesties and if anything
[50:22] fall in line with what satan's agenda is
[50:26] therefore we can challenge ourselves we
[50:28] can say well i can dress this way this
[50:30] is there's just a bunch of legalists out
[50:32] there and i can dress this way and i can
[50:34] listen to this and i can listen to that
[50:36] and i can ingest this and i can recreate
[50:38] with that and i can do all these
[50:40] different things and yeah maybe there
[50:41] could be a well-reasoned argument as to
[50:44] why you have liberty and christ to dilly
[50:46] dally venture in enjoy cherry pick or do
[50:49] all these different things but you have
[50:51] to ask yourself as an individual
[50:53] question a christian within the context
[50:55] of your home and your relationship with
[50:57] other believers and then as a testimony
[50:59] of the community as a whole what would
[51:01] happen one day if these very co-workers
[51:04] that you've been doing these things with
[51:06] one of them said i don't know what i'm
[51:07] going to do i feel lost and i want to
[51:09] know that there's a god
[51:12] and all of a sudden you got to go um
[51:14] [Music]
[51:16] you want to talk about jesus
[51:19] i'm like oh i didn't know you
[51:21] i didn't know you were a christian
[51:24] oh no no i'm crazy i'm crazy christian
[51:27] man i'm radical
[51:29] i'm a kind of believer a lot of people
[51:30] think i'm in a cult you should hear what
[51:32] i have to say
[51:34] you're like uh is that the drugs talking
[51:39] i'm being i'm being very serious about
[51:41] this
[51:42] we should ask ourselves could this cause
[51:45] my son to stumble
[51:48] could this cause my wife's faith to
[51:49] weaken
[51:51] could this be the wrong example to
[51:53] another young person
[51:55] could someone see my liberty in christ
[51:58] and actually come under bondage
[52:01] that's what he's saying
[52:03] you're just exercising your liberty
[52:06] and you're literally walking in a path
[52:08] and you're not you're not stumbling
[52:11] you're not following but someone's
[52:12] trying to walk the same way you are
[52:15] and they just keep tripping and they
[52:17] keep stumbling like what's wrong with
[52:18] you man
[52:20] that's well i'm just trying to i'm just
[52:21] trying to follow where you're walking
[52:24] and it can cause another another to
[52:25] stumble but yet your feet aren't
[52:27] hindered
[52:28] and paul is saying watch your steps
[52:32] and ask yourself whether your conduct or
[52:34] your behavior your words your actions
[52:35] the things you advocate for the things
[52:37] that you do cause another to stumble
[52:40] it says in colossians chapter four
[52:41] verses five to six i think this
[52:43] scripture perfectly encapsulates it walk
[52:45] in wisdom towards them that are without
[52:48] he's actually speaking about christians
[52:50] excuse me he's not speaking about those
[52:53] who do not have wisdom but rather
[52:54] speaking of our relationships with
[52:56] non-christians
[52:58] walk in wisdom towards those that are
[52:59] without the body have not been baptized
[53:01] into christ redeeming the time
[53:04] making the very most of the time seizing
[53:06] buying up season up buying up every
[53:08] opportunity so he says let your speech
[53:11] be alway with grace seasoned with salt
[53:13] that you may know how you ought to give
[53:15] ought to answer every man
[53:19] to me that is that is the apologetics
[53:21] that when there's a need there's a
[53:23] question you'll know how to answer it
[53:25] not theologically not precisely in terms
[53:28] of what the original intent was and what
[53:30] the context is and and what the doctor
[53:33] might be but you have a sensitivity to
[53:35] be able to speak at the right time and
[53:37] have speech that has been seasoned with
[53:39] grace to where they hear is benefited by
[53:41] it and like oh yes this is i i
[53:43] understand and this is it's ministering
[53:45] grace as the scripture says you're going
[53:47] to speak in such a way toward ministers
[53:49] grace to the here
[53:51] he said let your conversation let your
[53:53] life be gracious and and let it be
[53:56] sensible
[54:00] walk in wisdom towards those with
[54:02] towards them that are without let your
[54:04] speech
[54:05] be alway with grace seasoned with salt
[54:08] let your voice be with grace always
[54:11] let your voice be seasoned be tempered
[54:13] by grace
[54:15] because you're going to use it
[54:16] to give an answer
[54:19] someone's going to ask you a question
[54:20] and that same mouth you've been using to
[54:22] run down something else maybe the same
[54:23] mouth you're going to use to try to
[54:25] stand for christ
[54:29] the same mouth you've been using to
[54:31] advocate for a certain brand of
[54:33] economics by the founding fathers
[54:35] the same math you're going to use to try
[54:37] to instruct your children
[54:39] and well i don't even agree with your
[54:40] economic policy why would i agree with
[54:42] your standards in the home
[54:45] elliot didn't say that
[54:47] was it jack
[54:49] no it was none
[54:55] let's not waste our words on rhetoric
[54:58] let's not waste our speech on things
[55:00] that are extreme or vain causes
[55:03] save them for the opportunity that
[55:05] matters
[55:07] save them so that you may know how you
[55:08] ought to answer every man
[55:11] there's a lot of different things that
[55:12] can get us agitated and aggravated and
[55:14] caustic attitudes and divisive opinions
[55:17] on in different matters where we get
[55:18] really corrosive and agitated and we
[55:21] have this caustic attitude and we have
[55:23] divisive opinions on certain things on
[55:25] things that don't really matter what it
[55:26] does is it makes it sterilizes your
[55:28] testimony in that if there's no seed
[55:31] that's being sown
[55:33] christ is saying nope i can't go in that
[55:35] i i can't be a part of that it's you're
[55:37] not going to be effective so we actually
[55:39] hinder the ability of our words really
[55:42] finding fertile ground and affecting
[55:44] change in someone's life when we it's
[55:46] sewn with all this agitation and this
[55:47] religious fervor in the wrong sense and
[55:50] in political uh
[55:52] demagoguery toward oh we're just
[55:53] ratcheted up about certain things we
[55:55] want the message of christ to be pure
[55:58] we don't want to handle it in
[56:00] unrighteousness remember we are
[56:02] advocates for the cause of christ and
[56:04] our lives we want our lives to be
[56:06] forcible arguments
[56:10] brother brahm says this and the message
[56:11] humble thyself
[56:14] i think it just ties into let's walk
[56:16] into wisdom towards those that are lost
[56:17] he said now it's time for my
[56:19] consecration to god god's time to speak
[56:22] to me
[56:23] i must i must just have a little change
[56:25] in my own life
[56:27] not as i think that i'm wicked but i
[56:28] want to feel a little more closer to the
[56:30] people
[56:31] the people that i've tried to tell this
[56:33] gospel truth to
[56:35] and they turn their backs on it
[56:37] all right i want everybody's attention
[56:39] notice who he's talking about
[56:41] not necessarily new ground but people
[56:43] he's spoken to
[56:45] who have heard him who ought to have
[56:47] known who ought to have walked in it
[56:49] he says and they walk away and laugh at
[56:51] it
[56:52] here's his honesty now to me that seems
[56:54] like an it's an insult i don't care to
[56:56] me
[56:57] but to the things i've been saying it's
[56:59] the truth
[57:00] trying to help them
[57:03] like shoving out a boat and say here hey
[57:06] here it is here it is cross over here
[57:09] get out of that swelling stream you're
[57:11] going to die you're going to perish
[57:13] there and they just laugh at you and
[57:14] walk away
[57:16] it's like presenting an opportunity for
[57:17] someone to be saved from a flood and
[57:19] they laugh at you and walk away so
[57:20] that's how it makes you feel he goes
[57:22] well to me it feels like if they walk
[57:25] away there's nothing more i can do about
[57:27] it that i can do
[57:29] fine you want to reject it you want to
[57:30] laugh at it you want to scoff at it fine
[57:32] but notice he says
[57:34] but i want to run down the bank now and
[57:36] persuade them come on back
[57:39] see i've got to have that feeling
[57:42] because i know that there's somebody out
[57:43] there that hasn't come in yet and i'm
[57:45] going to fish chill he said until the
[57:47] last fish is caught i want to do that
[57:52] recognize that brother branham realized
[57:54] that it merely wasn't an opportunity
[57:56] we're saying hey there's a flood coming
[57:58] and he has a boat that's gonna save
[57:59] people and they reject the boat he's
[58:01] like fine you're gonna have to deal with
[58:02] it yourself you're gonna have to deal
[58:03] with the floodwaters you're gonna have
[58:04] to figure out another way across and
[58:06] this was just a matter of people
[58:08] uh foregoing an opportunity to to get
[58:10] across the other side of the stream
[58:12] brother branham realized he had a very
[58:14] important message
[58:15] i mean you recognize there wasn't going
[58:17] to be another one there's not another
[58:18] christ there's not another gospel and if
[58:20] they walk away from this that's their
[58:22] only hope so as they walked away he
[58:24] wasn't like oh well if they can't use
[58:25] this crossing maybe they can use another
[58:27] hit something compelled him to say i
[58:30] want to run after them and persuade them
[58:32] to come back i've got to have a feeling
[58:34] he was impressed with the urgency and
[58:37] the magnitude and the importance of the
[58:39] message that he had he's like there's no
[58:41] other way across so i want to yell to
[58:44] them come back this is the way
[58:48] let me join that with this
[58:50] disposition and character of paul that
[58:52] we've been lifting up because brother
[58:54] bam said he preached the same gospel
[58:55] paul preached paul had a revelation of
[58:57] jesus christ to bring to the people this
[59:00] revelation of jesus christ was new
[59:02] this revelation of jesus christ was
[59:04] different this revelation of jesus
[59:06] christ was very controversial even
[59:08] amongst the disciples themselves paul
[59:11] was preaching a revelation that peter
[59:13] said hey these things are difficult
[59:14] people rest with them unstable men rest
[59:16] with them to their own destruction but
[59:18] paul was preaching the amplification of
[59:21] christ saying upon this rock i will
[59:23] build my church and paul has the
[59:25] revelation of jesus christ the body of
[59:28] christ and he's bringing this out very
[59:30] forcefully and he knows he has a very
[59:31] very important message not only to the
[59:33] jews to whom the messiah was sent to
[59:35] call them into christianity to call them
[59:37] into the new covenant but also to go to
[59:39] the heathen who seemly were not part of
[59:41] that he had a very important gospel and
[59:43] revelation to preach and therefore it
[59:46] was that revelation that constrained him
[59:48] from acting in a manner that would cause
[59:50] that revelation to be ineffective
[59:54] wasn't even just trying to be a good
[59:56] christian it was the magnitude of the
[59:58] gospel that he held as brother branham
[1:00:00] says and humble thyself in july of 1963
[1:00:03] after the opening of these seals
[1:00:05] soon preaching christ is the mystery god
[1:00:07] revealed it wasn't like you want to say
[1:00:08] hey what's been done has been done all
[1:00:10] these people that rejected me since 47
[1:00:12] or since 33 the half forget them let's
[1:00:14] just move on it doesn't really matter he
[1:00:16] realized now this is totally different
[1:00:18] this has changed this is important i've
[1:00:20] got a message that's been different than
[1:00:22] what i preached before this is the
[1:00:24] fulfillment of visions and dreams this
[1:00:26] is the fulfillment of prophecy and i
[1:00:28] want to run back down the bank again i
[1:00:30] want to call out to those people you may
[1:00:32] have rejected me in the 50s you may have
[1:00:34] rejected the first poll you may have
[1:00:36] rejected the second poll but all maybe
[1:00:39] some way by god's grace the third paul
[1:00:42] will get your attention
[1:00:45] and i say that we have a message
[1:00:47] a fulfillment of end time prophecy we
[1:00:50] have something great like as paul did we
[1:00:52] have this very message that brother man
[1:00:54] said i've got to have that feeling for
[1:00:55] the people that i want them to get this
[1:00:57] message
[1:00:59] we ought to always bear this in mind
[1:01:02] so that we don't bring any hindrance
[1:01:05] to this truth
[1:01:10] first timothy chapter 2.
[1:01:13] we read this on wednesday i want to read
[1:01:15] it again and not spend a lot of time
[1:01:18] amplifying it first timothy chapter 2
[1:01:20] verses 1 to 8. let's read it together
[1:01:22] not that you need to read out loud but
[1:01:23] let's just read it as we have it on
[1:01:24] slides or you read in your bible follow
[1:01:27] with with i feel that i can just read
[1:01:29] this
[1:01:31] with the foundation that we have to this
[1:01:32] point and just read it notice paul's
[1:01:34] attitude as he instructs timothy
[1:01:36] i exhort therefore that first of all
[1:01:38] supplications prayers intercessions and
[1:01:41] giving of thanks be made for all men
[1:01:44] you'll find in the book of ezra in the
[1:01:46] book i believe jeremiah where when the
[1:01:48] children were in bondage carried away
[1:01:51] captives in foreign lands they prayed
[1:01:53] for their leaders and they offered
[1:01:56] sacrifices
[1:01:58] even though they're in captivity they
[1:01:59] met together and prayed for their leaves
[1:02:01] they didn't conspire
[1:02:03] a
[1:02:04] coup
[1:02:06] they just met and prayed for their
[1:02:08] leaders
[1:02:09] this is the demonstration in the old
[1:02:10] testament that they were in bondage and
[1:02:12] they accepted the fact that they were in
[1:02:13] bondage and so they prayed supplications
[1:02:16] prayers and intercessions and given to
[1:02:17] thanks were made for these leaders and
[1:02:18] paul is now saying it should be made for
[1:02:20] all men you want to qualify that
[1:02:23] all men
[1:02:25] for kings and for all that are in
[1:02:26] authority and that comports with the
[1:02:29] examples in ezra and jeremiah now this
[1:02:31] is why one reason why you pray that we
[1:02:33] may lead a quiet and peaceful life in
[1:02:36] all godliness and honesty
[1:02:38] if you if you want america
[1:02:41] to to have an environment or an
[1:02:43] atmosphere that allows you to live godly
[1:02:45] and in all honesty which should be the
[1:02:47] standard by which you want to live
[1:02:49] i want an atmosphere i want i want to be
[1:02:51] able to serve god i want to be able to
[1:02:52] serve christ
[1:02:55] i i'm not actually necessarily concerned
[1:02:57] about whether or not my college
[1:02:58] education is be paid for by the
[1:03:00] government
[1:03:01] it's not my primary concern as a
[1:03:03] christian
[1:03:04] but my concern is that will i be able to
[1:03:06] lead a quiet and peaceful life in all
[1:03:09] godliness and honesty and that's my
[1:03:10] primary prayer request
[1:03:13] my prayer request says oh god give us a
[1:03:15] president
[1:03:17] lord convert kamala harris
[1:03:20] uh so that she can become a republican
[1:03:22] and then have sleepy joe die so that we
[1:03:24] can have a christian president again and
[1:03:27] she can advocate for my first amendment
[1:03:29] my second amendment and that we won't
[1:03:31] have universal health care and we can
[1:03:33] close our borders and we'll just pray oh
[1:03:35] god please give me
[1:03:37] give me a republican president again
[1:03:41] god just let me live a quiet and
[1:03:44] peaceable life and all godliness and
[1:03:45] honesty and when i read this scripture i
[1:03:48] found out everything in the world today
[1:03:50] is to rob us of that
[1:03:52] not to take away our guns and give us
[1:03:54] free health care but it's to keep us
[1:03:56] from leading a quiet and peaceful life
[1:03:58] in all godliness and honesty
[1:04:01] for this is good and acceptable in the
[1:04:02] sight of god our savior
[1:04:04] then notice this why are we doing all
[1:04:06] this prayer and intercessions and
[1:04:07] supplications and giving thanks who will
[1:04:10] have all men to be saved
[1:04:12] and to come into the knowledge of the
[1:04:14] truth
[1:04:20] right there
[1:04:22] to me that kind of summer that's
[1:04:24] advocacy
[1:04:26] this is a call to advocacy
[1:04:28] this is standing up for the cause of
[1:04:30] christ
[1:04:31] that we as christians
[1:04:33] pray for all men we pray for those in
[1:04:36] power
[1:04:37] not so that one we could live a godly
[1:04:40] life and live what we believe to be the
[1:04:42] truth
[1:04:43] but that also others could come to the
[1:04:45] knowledge of it
[1:04:48] and then notice the fount notice what
[1:04:50] this leads to to me this is so important
[1:04:51] because we use this a lot on
[1:04:53] the bride's advocate for there is one
[1:04:55] god in one mediator between god and men
[1:04:58] the man christ jesus who is that
[1:05:00] if we sin we have an advocate with the
[1:05:03] father jesus christ the righteous who is
[1:05:06] a be made to be a perpetuation for our
[1:05:09] sins perpetuation mercy seat
[1:05:12] the the offering
[1:05:13] so now verses one two three and four
[1:05:16] lead to
[1:05:17] this one mediator between god and man
[1:05:19] the man christ jesus who gave himself a
[1:05:21] ransom so he's the ransom he's the price
[1:05:23] he's the sacrifice there's only a ransom
[1:05:25] only needs to be paid once for all
[1:05:28] to be testified
[1:05:30] in due time so the ransom is paid but
[1:05:32] there's got to be a testimony of it
[1:05:35] he says whereunto i am ordained a
[1:05:38] preacher and an apostle i speak the
[1:05:39] truth in christ and lie not i am
[1:05:41] ordained a preacher and an apostle a
[1:05:43] teacher of the gentiles in faith and
[1:05:45] verity truth and faith and verity i will
[1:05:48] therefore
[1:05:50] that men pray everywhere
[1:05:52] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[1:05:55] doubting
[1:05:56] again this is the summation of paul's
[1:05:58] call to advocacy this is paul not only
[1:06:00] espousing this to timothy who would be a
[1:06:02] pastor in the church and was a student
[1:06:04] of paul's to continue on the message of
[1:06:06] the hour and that day but now he is
[1:06:08] saying that this is what we ought to do
[1:06:09] i exhort first that all offer prayers
[1:06:12] and supplications intercessions and
[1:06:14] giving of thanks be made notice
[1:06:15] intercessions be made for all men even
[1:06:18] for leaders and those who are in the
[1:06:19] government because we have one mediator
[1:06:21] jesus christ the righteous one mediator
[1:06:24] between god and man but i am ordained
[1:06:27] to testify of this therefore under this
[1:06:30] ordination i will therefore that men
[1:06:33] pray everywhere lifting up holy hands
[1:06:35] without wrath and doubting now he wants
[1:06:37] those to join him in this ordination and
[1:06:40] then this cause
[1:06:42] oh i i would it may be there's a part of
[1:06:44] me i don't think it's my better part uh
[1:06:47] wanted me to stop here but i want to
[1:06:49] just take another step further to be
[1:06:51] able to come back to our text but i want
[1:06:53] to be able to draw some things very very
[1:06:54] quickly we've just been past an hour in
[1:06:57] preaching
[1:06:58] uh this morning and i want to draw to
[1:07:00] this very very quickly and and draw from
[1:07:02] i think it's been nine services on this
[1:07:04] advocacy the bride's advocate where we
[1:07:06] talked about the old testament and paul
[1:07:08] in the book of hebrews showing just how
[1:07:10] beautifully we've entered into the
[1:07:12] holiest of holies we've entered in
[1:07:14] behind that curtain we're there between
[1:07:16] the cherubim
[1:07:18] right paul made that very very clear
[1:07:19] that completely changes the fact that in
[1:07:22] their in the ark of the covenant there
[1:07:24] were tablets of stone that were a
[1:07:26] witness and a testimony against israel
[1:07:28] but now under the new covenant we are
[1:07:30] back in the same place with the word in
[1:07:33] us written in our hearts now not
[1:07:35] testifying against us but testifying for
[1:07:37] us that we have been covered with the
[1:07:39] blood the ransom has been paid now there
[1:07:42] we are in the midst of this ark of the
[1:07:45] covenant there raised up seated in
[1:07:47] heavenly places we've become a part of
[1:07:49] the picture of the mercy seat
[1:07:54] and he says this now after he is given
[1:07:56] this is advocacy pray pray pray
[1:07:59] intercede intercessions would be made
[1:08:01] for kings and all that are in authority
[1:08:03] that one we could live as christians
[1:08:05] number two that others would come to the
[1:08:07] knowledge of the truth he says there's
[1:08:08] one mediator or one mediation
[1:08:12] and paul says that he's ordained as a
[1:08:14] minister of that mediation
[1:08:17] and these verses verses one two three
[1:08:19] and four even verse eight exemplify that
[1:08:22] mediation
[1:08:24] what is it primarily an advocate
[1:08:27] of christ
[1:08:28] for those who need him
[1:08:31] that could be the lost it could be the
[1:08:33] hurting it could be the wound it could
[1:08:34] be the word it could be the disappointed
[1:08:35] it could be the downtrodden those that
[1:08:36] are going to be backslid a little bit
[1:08:38] cold he is there as an advocate for
[1:08:40] christ for those who need them
[1:08:43] he's saying there's only one mediator
[1:08:46] paul saying now i have this office and i
[1:08:48] have this necessary calling i i love how
[1:08:51] he says i am a preacher apostle teacher
[1:08:54] and he says i speak the truth and i'm
[1:08:55] not lying i'm a preacher apostle and
[1:08:57] teacher to the gentiles and he's and he
[1:08:59] says this after he says there's only one
[1:09:01] media between god and man why you say
[1:09:03] now i don't want you to confuse my
[1:09:04] office because it's going to be so close
[1:09:07] you can make the wrong conclusions i'm
[1:09:08] not here to pay the price i'm not here
[1:09:10] as the one that's going to shed his
[1:09:12] blood the price has been paid there's
[1:09:14] only one mediator but i'm ordained a
[1:09:16] preacher apostle and teacher of this
[1:09:19] mediator
[1:09:20] why because he says in the stead of
[1:09:22] christ or in the place of christ he is
[1:09:25] declaring here be ye reconciled to god
[1:09:29] there's only one meter between god and
[1:09:31] man the man christ jesus an advocate
[1:09:34] with the father but he says now i stand
[1:09:37] here in the place of christ saying come
[1:09:41] and be filled come and be reconciled
[1:09:46] so let me read this very quickly first
[1:09:48] corinthians chapter 5 verse 18 then i
[1:09:49] want to come to the whole and all things
[1:09:51] are of god who hath reconciled us to
[1:09:53] himself by jesus christ and have given
[1:09:56] to us
[1:09:57] the ministry of reconciliation
[1:10:02] that could have been translated to the
[1:10:04] ministry of atonement
[1:10:09] now we are not the atonement
[1:10:12] thank god
[1:10:14] right that we are not the atonement
[1:10:17] we are not the atonement being the sin
[1:10:19] offering
[1:10:20] we are not the offering for sin
[1:10:23] but we've been made a part of it
[1:10:26] right
[1:10:27] i mean i i don't really think it's
[1:10:28] semantics and it's not that we always
[1:10:30] you know try to go to logic but there's
[1:10:32] something there's something that god is
[1:10:34] trying to get us to understand
[1:10:36] that christ we can we cannot take the
[1:10:38] individual place of jesus christ who
[1:10:40] became the sin offering
[1:10:43] we cannot do that so we cannot be the
[1:10:45] one mediator between god and man the man
[1:10:48] christ jesus we cannot be the actual sin
[1:10:51] offering or atonement but now in the
[1:10:53] place of it or instead of it it was to
[1:10:56] be testified in due time i say it's due
[1:10:59] time to testify of it and he is not here
[1:11:02] speaking unless we speak we are the
[1:11:05] voice of the atonement we are the voice
[1:11:07] of the mercy seat we are the voice of
[1:11:09] the minister of reconciliation we name
[1:11:12] may not be the sin offering but we are
[1:11:14] the voice of it
[1:11:17] because the blood speaks
[1:11:19] we drew on these images and types before
[1:11:22] in the first several parts or first few
[1:11:24] parts in the old testament the mercy
[1:11:26] seat was literally could be have
[1:11:28] described it was described in the hebrew
[1:11:30] language the place of atonement
[1:11:34] that that that lid that that covered
[1:11:37] that the the ark of the covenant that
[1:11:38] became an altar all these elements
[1:11:40] becoming part of the same thing that was
[1:11:42] sprinkled with blood on the day of
[1:11:44] atonement and it atoned and reconciled
[1:11:47] atonement even there it's not just a uh
[1:11:50] i i want you to catch this what paul is
[1:11:52] bringing in i may be just i'm getting
[1:11:53] all excited and all enthused i just need
[1:11:55] to take a deep breath slow down
[1:11:58] i'm getting worked up
[1:12:05] in the old testament
[1:12:07] the mercy seats the place of atonement
[1:12:08] or the place of reconciling
[1:12:11] paul is not just using
[1:12:13] oh yeah what you know what's the word
[1:12:14] he's not doing a crossword puzzle
[1:12:16] you know what's a 11 letter word for
[1:12:18] something he's he's actually very
[1:12:20] deliberate in what he says
[1:12:24] so that on the day of atonement what
[1:12:26] would happen on the day of atonement
[1:12:28] the high priest would enter in behind
[1:12:29] that
[1:12:31] and take the sin offering
[1:12:33] and he'd put those stripes the blood
[1:12:34] upon the mercy seat
[1:12:37] in the hebrew
[1:12:38] atonement is reconciling
[1:12:41] it's the same thing in the new testament
[1:12:43] the minister of reconciliation could
[1:12:44] have been the ministry of atonement but
[1:12:46] now he said on the day of atonement we
[1:12:47] look in the old testament on the day of
[1:12:49] reconciling the mercy seat was sprinkled
[1:12:51] with blood
[1:12:52] so when paul says we have it's been
[1:12:54] committed to us a ministry of
[1:12:56] reconciliation the bride has a ministry
[1:12:58] of reconciliation she has a ministry of
[1:13:00] atonement
[1:13:03] away to the mercy seat
[1:13:07] as i try to bring this to a close this
[1:13:09] is
[1:13:10] the bride's advocacy
[1:13:13] now in my heart i feel that i could stop
[1:13:15] on the bride's advocacy the lord may
[1:13:17] just have me stop in this series right
[1:13:19] here on this because i believe it convey
[1:13:20] it comes to the point the original
[1:13:22] inspiration in this this is our
[1:13:24] responsibility and the final voice to
[1:13:26] the final age
[1:13:28] it's seen in this image it's seen in
[1:13:30] first timothy chapter two it's seen in
[1:13:32] first john chapter two it's seen in
[1:13:33] these in these places in the bible that
[1:13:35] we've been reading from over the last
[1:13:36] several weeks
[1:13:38] so let's look at our text one last time
[1:13:40] as we read this
[1:13:45] just reading it together we'll invite
[1:13:47] the musicians to come
[1:13:49] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:13:51] a new creature
[1:13:53] all things are passed away behold all
[1:13:55] things are become new
[1:13:58] and all things are of god
[1:14:01] now we are the new creatures
[1:14:04] we are those that have all things have
[1:14:05] become new so now our lives are changing
[1:14:08] things are different
[1:14:10] and he says god has reconciled us to
[1:14:12] himself by jesus christ so we have been
[1:14:15] reconciled to god by jesus christ but
[1:14:17] all things have become new he says and
[1:14:19] have given to us the ministry of
[1:14:21] reconciliation so it's only through
[1:14:23] christ that we can be reconciled to god
[1:14:25] but now in order for there to be further
[1:14:27] reconciliation we've been given the
[1:14:29] ministry of reconciliation to it notice
[1:14:31] this how beautiful this that god was in
[1:14:33] christ reconcile the world unto himself
[1:14:38] are we not taught that
[1:14:39] that
[1:14:40] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:14:44] and then the scriptures tell us about
[1:14:45] how christ is emptied out all that god
[1:14:47] was he poured into christ all that
[1:14:48] christ was he is poured into the church
[1:14:51] and god was in christ reconciling the
[1:14:53] world to himself not imputing their
[1:14:55] trespasses on them and have committed
[1:14:57] unto us now the word of reconciliation
[1:15:01] this is what jesus christ has done god
[1:15:03] was in christ
[1:15:05] recklen signed the world to himself and
[1:15:07] now it has been committed to us the word
[1:15:10] of reconciliation
[1:15:12] now then
[1:15:14] we are ambassadors for christ
[1:15:16] as though god did beseech you by us we
[1:15:19] pray you as if christ is present with
[1:15:22] you in the place of christ the one whom
[1:15:24] god was in reconciling the world to
[1:15:26] himself in christ said be ye reconciled
[1:15:29] to god it's speaking the same thing
[1:15:34] we have made him to be sin for us who
[1:15:36] knew no sin the sin offering who was
[1:15:39] perfect right those the images when paul
[1:15:41] says this he made him to be sin for us
[1:15:43] he knew no sin it's the very image on
[1:15:44] the day of atonement where one animal
[1:15:46] this beast would be taken and these sins
[1:15:48] would be he would be hacked it would be
[1:15:50] cut open and he would bleed out as a sin
[1:15:53] offering
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:15:55] and he would take on an image it was a
[1:15:58] symbol of god reconciling israel to
[1:16:00] himself and he said he became sin for us
[1:16:03] he knew no sin he was innocent so that
[1:16:05] we not merely would we have a symbolic
[1:16:08] representation of god placating our sins
[1:16:10] for a year but that we through one
[1:16:12] offering and descending back of that
[1:16:14] spirit would be made the very
[1:16:16] righteousness of god in him
[1:16:19] [Music]
[1:16:21] therefore being righteous being
[1:16:23] sprinkled being washed being made clean
[1:16:25] we can boldly enter into this office in
[1:16:27] this position in the holy of holies
[1:16:31] and we have a voice
[1:16:36] we're not walking around
[1:16:38] the outside of the tabernacle
[1:16:43] i wonder what's happening in there
[1:16:46] i wonder if the cloud's going to come
[1:16:48] down this year
[1:16:50] i wonder if the high priest is going to
[1:16:51] be accepted
[1:16:53] we're not the ones walking around
[1:16:55] wondering we're not even in the outer
[1:16:56] court
[1:16:59] we're not even in the inner
[1:17:00] court we're in the holy of holies
[1:17:04] and there
[1:17:05] we know
[1:17:07] the presence of christ is real
[1:17:10] there we know the gravity of the hour
[1:17:13] it's there that we stand we are they're
[1:17:15] raised seated in heavenly places in
[1:17:17] christ jesus do we not have a voice from
[1:17:21] behind that veil a voice from behind the
[1:17:24] veil of badger skins today the unveiling
[1:17:27] of god how is he unveiled in this house
[1:17:29] it's going to be by a living voice
[1:17:31] by a testimony i want to be a true
[1:17:34] advocate for the presence of jesus
[1:17:36] christ in this hour we have a precious
[1:17:38] revelation that's been given to us oh
[1:17:40] let me not sow it let me not bring smut
[1:17:43] upon it let me not confuse it but let it
[1:17:45] be declared clearly
[1:17:48] we have a message
[1:17:52] and in the message investments
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:04] the message investments
[1:18:09] brother brown says in our spirits this
[1:18:10] morning weep out for a lost world
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:15] we may need we may need to get back to
[1:18:16] this
[1:18:19] our spirits are weeping
[1:18:21] for a lost world give us wisdom to know
[1:18:24] how to approach them lord
[1:18:27] we don't want them lost
[1:18:29] the bear the very excuse me the very
[1:18:32] spirit within us
[1:18:34] would condemn us desiring their being
[1:18:37] lost
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:39] if you wanted people to be lost if you
[1:18:41] wanted to be destroyed if you wanted
[1:18:42] them to be cast into tribulation then
[1:18:44] the
[1:18:45] brother branham saying that the very
[1:18:46] spirit within us would condemn us if we
[1:18:49] had that desire he says but may the holy
[1:18:51] spirit constantly cry they say
[1:18:54] constantly sweep out
[1:18:56] until we put forth every effort with our
[1:18:59] talent with our time with our money with
[1:19:03] everything that we have got no matter

[1:22:12] branham's urgency of running up and down
[1:22:13] the bank recognizing and the message
[1:22:15] humbled myself just the magnitude of the
[1:22:17] word that had been opened up to him
[1:22:19] [Music]

[1:22:24] statement resonating within our hearts

[1:23:31] freedom and liberty
[1:23:33] lord for sister arnie today i pray that

[1:23:53] exalt your name
[1:23:54] there's not enough words that we could
[1:23:56] pour out from these lips that would
[1:23:57] adequately do your justice do you
[1:23:59] justice
[1:24:00] but lord we stand in all today to see
[1:24:03] the word unfold
[1:24:05] and to see this advocacy that paul is
[1:24:08] pointing to
[1:24:09] and then for just to turn to realize
[1:24:11] this is paul not
[1:24:12] as soft sewer and or paul trying to
[1:24:14] placate and paul trying to be acceptable
[1:24:17] or popular but he knew that he was
[1:24:19] standing in the very place of christ
[1:24:23] and we today as the bride of jesus
[1:24:24] christ had the ministry of atonement
[1:24:27] lord how could we ever disregard the
[1:24:30] blood of jesus christ
[1:24:31] as an unholy thing how could we ever
[1:24:33] discard it and do away with it to not be
[1:24:37] moved and impacted by it when we are the
[1:24:39] very voice of the blood in this hour we
[1:24:41] are the very voice of the atonement i
[1:24:43] pray for that you would help us to be
[1:24:45] more sensitive and to walk in the proper
[1:24:47] reflection of it
[1:24:49] here's our soul
[1:24:51] here's our voice
[1:24:52] we ask this in the name of the lord
[1:24:54] jesus christ
[1:24:56] amen
