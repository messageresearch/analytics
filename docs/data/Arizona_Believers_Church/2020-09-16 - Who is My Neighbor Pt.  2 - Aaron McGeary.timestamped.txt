[1:33] want to read from luke chapter 10
[1:36] verses 25 to 37 luke chapter 10
[1:41] and we'll start with verse 25 and read
[1:43] to verse 37.
[1:46] i wanted to mention i was speaking with
[1:48] brother ted passadly today
[1:51] and he wanted to send his greetings to
[1:52] each of you and let you know
[1:54] he and his wife are praying for you and
[1:56] that you're in their hearts and he
[1:57] wanted to
[1:58] pass those greetings on and then also
[2:01] i'd reached out to him because i'd heard
[2:02] they were having special
[2:04] services this weekend for young people
[2:06] and so they're having
[2:08] special meetings for those of the age of
[2:10] accountability
[2:11] and it's directed to those ages 8 to 14.
[2:14] so on saturday at 10 30 and then
[2:17] saturday evening at 6 00 p.m they're
[2:19] having special meetings the evening time
[2:20] lighthouse
[2:22] there in dewey arizona so if you need
[2:23] more information you can see myself
[2:26] you may already have some of that
[2:27] information but just wanted to mention
[2:29] that to you all
[2:30] that if you're able to go and support it
[2:32] as i was talking to him he said he
[2:33] doesn't know how many to expect and they
[2:35] haven't had very
[2:36] many due to all the covet 19
[2:38] restrictions so i said well if you don't
[2:39] want me to announce it i won't i said
[2:41] but at the very least i'd like to share
[2:42] it with our church so we could be in
[2:44] prayer for it so
[2:45] if your age is 8 to 14 and you're not
[2:47] old enough to drive up yet but if
[2:49] someone can take you up there and take
[2:50] part in those services this weekend
[2:52] that'd be wonderful but at the very
[2:53] least as a church let's just be praying
[2:55] for
[2:55] for that time around the word of the
[2:57] lord this weekend for those young people
[2:59] luke chapter 10 verse 25 if you could
[3:02] just
[3:03] pay close attention to the reading of
[3:05] this now while you're standing
[3:07] because i won't be able to go back over
[3:08] some of these verses for times sake
[3:10] but i want to just each element as we
[3:12] walk through this
[3:14] just be held in your mind and behold a
[3:15] certain lawyer stood up
[3:17] and tempted him and the use of the word
[3:19] tempt here isn't that he was
[3:21] evil in his motive but rather he was
[3:22] testing him
[3:24] and seeing what answer he would give
[3:26] saying master what shall i
[3:28] do to inherit eternal life and he said
[3:31] unto him what is written in the law
[3:33] how read us thou and he answering said
[3:35] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[3:37] all thy heart and with all thy soul and
[3:39] with all thy strength
[3:40] with all thy mind and thy neighbor as
[3:42] thyself
[3:43] and he said unto him thou hast answered
[3:45] right this do
[3:47] and thou shalt live but he willing to
[3:49] justify himself said unto jesus
[3:52] and who is my neighbor and jesus
[3:54] answering said
[3:55] a certain man went down from jerusalem
[3:57] to jericho
[3:58] and fell among thieves which stripped
[4:00] him of his raiment and wounded him and
[4:02] departed leaving him half dead and by
[4:05] chance there came down
[4:06] a certain priest that way and when he
[4:08] saw him he passed by on the other side
[4:10] and likewise a levite when he was at at
[4:13] the place came
[4:14] and looked on him and passed by on the
[4:16] other side
[4:17] but a certain samaritan as he journeyed
[4:20] came where he was and when he saw him he
[4:22] had compassion on him
[4:23] and went to him and bound up his wounds
[4:25] pouring in oil and wine and set him on
[4:27] his own beast and
[4:29] brought him to an end and took care of
[4:30] him and on the morrow when he departed
[4:32] he took out two pence and gave them to
[4:34] the host and said unto him
[4:36] take care of him whatsoever thou spend
[4:38] us more when i come again i will repay
[4:40] thee
[4:41] which now of these three thinkest thou
[4:44] was neighbor unto him that fell
[4:46] among the thieves so the question is who
[4:48] was a neighbor
[4:49] to the one that was wounded the one that
[4:50] was hurt and he said to him he that
[4:52] showed mercy on him
[4:54] then said jesus unto him go and do thou
[4:56] likewise
[4:57] amen you may be seated
[5:01] we're just picking right up with the
[5:03] subject of who is my neighbor
[5:05] and they got me a large bottle of water
[5:08] today so i preach as long as i have
[5:09] water
[5:10] so i hope you don't have plans on
[5:12] thursday
[5:13] but the subject we're looking at is who
[5:15] is my neighbor we're drawing it
[5:16] specifically from
[5:18] the question that this lawyer asked of
[5:20] him
[5:21] and in verse 30 29
[5:24] and we are asking the question of
[5:26] ourselves trusting that each one of us
[5:28] could do it as believers then maybe
[5:29] we're asking this question
[5:31] as a church who is our neighbor but
[5:33] we're not asking to justify ourselves
[5:35] but we're doing so to understand
[5:37] our calling to understand our position
[5:39] in christ and even i think maybe we use
[5:41] the words last wednesday
[5:42] what our duty is what our responsibility
[5:44] is to christ
[5:45] and to others and we were mentioning at
[5:48] the very end that we have
[5:49] humanistic instincts that uh want to
[5:52] create cliques or create cultures that
[5:54] are contrary
[5:55] to the the nature of christ and we don't
[5:58] do so out of evil intent and we don't do
[6:00] it setting out to deviate from the
[6:01] standards of christ
[6:02] but there's just human instincts that we
[6:04] have whether it be tribal or whether it
[6:06] be
[6:06] familial or whether just be our longing
[6:09] to
[6:09] belong and to have a sense of acceptance
[6:11] we have certain
[6:12] uh instincts that we have in our flesh
[6:14] that can create groups and create
[6:16] identity
[6:17] identities around them or create a
[6:18] culture that we must
[6:20] be able to overcome as christians we
[6:23] can't default in
[6:24] any any spectrum we cannot default to
[6:26] our carnal base
[6:27] instincts because those base instincts
[6:29] are contrary to christ
[6:31] and that may be very hard for some
[6:32] people to comprehend especially
[6:34] you're good natured at heart and you
[6:36] just just by way you're raised you have
[6:38] certain integrities and you try to be
[6:40] decent
[6:40] we have to realize that our very base
[6:42] instincts are carnal they're fleshly
[6:44] and they're animalistic in many
[6:46] different ways and we're reading a
[6:48] statement where brother branham was in
[6:50] new york
[6:50] and he witnessed somebody fall down and
[6:52] how all the new yorkers just kept
[6:54] passing by him and
[6:55] bill abraham said that he went over
[6:56] there and helped pick him up and he
[6:58] and he helped the woman collect all her
[6:59] oranges or whatever it is she spilt and
[7:01] the woman kind of looked at him funny
[7:03] and i believe he kind of relayed this
[7:05] conversation uh maybe into a cab driver
[7:07] i might be mixing up statements but he
[7:09] related to somebody
[7:10] and the guy said man they would have
[7:12] you'd be really an oddball you'd
[7:14] definitely be an out-of-towner
[7:15] if you reach out to assist somebody who
[7:17] is in need because that's just not the
[7:19] way
[7:19] people act in new york and this isn't
[7:21] social commentary on new yorkers
[7:23] unless there be a new yorker here but he
[7:26] he
[7:27] the the cab driver says well you know
[7:29] they're good people but they just get
[7:30] into the swing of things
[7:32] and brother branham then relates that to
[7:34] the church he says they don't mean to be
[7:35] that way it's just a swing it's just a
[7:37] groove or a rut
[7:38] that they get into that's just the way
[7:40] that they act and he says that's how the
[7:42] church does he says it's just getting in
[7:44] the swing
[7:45] that's the way we do brethren in our
[7:47] church life
[7:48] we get into a swing of one certain creed
[7:51] or one certain thing
[7:52] or there we and and there we stay see we
[7:55] swing with the rest of them and so he's
[7:58] talking about how we just kind of get
[7:59] into a mode of thinking a mode of acting
[8:01] a way of doing things
[8:03] and he says we just swing into a certain
[8:04] creases or into a
[8:06] certain thing so it's not just an
[8:07] ideology it's not a theology or even a
[8:09] particular doctrine
[8:10] can even just a way of thinking a way of
[8:12] acting a way of perceiving a way of
[8:14] processing
[8:14] it's our values and our value judgments
[8:16] that we make says you just get into us
[8:18] the swing
[8:19] saying it's the swing that kept that
[8:21] person other people
[8:22] from instinctively helping out a fellow
[8:25] human who fell down
[8:26] and lost all their oranges and so that's
[8:28] just kind of
[8:29] the recap of some of the things we were
[8:31] mentioning last time
[8:32] just to go in further because what's
[8:34] what my burden is is church must be more
[8:36] than just a meeting place
[8:38] we're just looking for a meeting place
[8:40] we could find a lot of those and it has
[8:42] to be more than just a meeting place of
[8:43] people who are like-minded
[8:45] and to that end it's more than just a
[8:47] meeting place of people who believe the
[8:48] message or
[8:49] or believe in christ or even are filled
[8:50] with the holy ghost because we've met
[8:52] number of times outside of church or
[8:54] outside the context of a sermon being
[8:56] ministered
[8:57] but church is just not a gathering of
[8:59] people who identify with a certain thing
[9:00] because there's no
[9:01] identity politics there's no group
[9:03] politics politics has no place in a
[9:05] church
[9:06] so we don't come just as a meeting place
[9:07] because we have things in common
[9:09] but church must serve to inspire it must
[9:12] serve to inspire to service
[9:14] and how this how this has just came upon
[9:17] my heart very weighty as the parable of
[9:18] the good samaritan
[9:20] holds truths that must be at the core of
[9:22] our very being
[9:23] and not just our human beings but our
[9:25] spiritual being
[9:26] that what jesus is identifying in what
[9:28] we call the parable of the good
[9:30] samaritan
[9:30] are so many different layers to this we
[9:33] can identify ourselves in several
[9:34] different aspects
[9:35] some of us may instinctively identify
[9:37] ourselves as the one that is wounded
[9:38] others of us may want to identify
[9:40] ourselves with the good samaritan
[9:41] you may identify yourself with christ
[9:43] who's telling the story or the the
[9:45] levite or the priest but there's
[9:46] different ways that we can identify with
[9:48] this story
[9:49] and it speaks to things that ought to be
[9:51] at the core of how we think and how we
[9:53] act
[9:53] and how we process things as christians
[9:56] and i want to begin by looking at the
[9:58] two questions that are posed by this
[10:00] lawyer
[10:01] and i feel somewhat qualified to get
[10:03] into his mind and to speak about
[10:06] these questions that are being posed but
[10:08] there's two questions that are posed by
[10:09] the lawyer and it's important
[10:11] to see the connection between them
[10:13] because as you read it and it starts out
[10:15] one way
[10:15] and then you come down to the next
[10:18] questions that ask
[10:19] and just by the flow of it it's i find
[10:21] that it's easy to kind of
[10:22] leave what was the initial a serve and
[10:25] what was the initial question and you
[10:27] feel like you're in a different place by
[10:28] the time you read
[10:29] uh jesus's answer and the final
[10:31] conclusion well the one that was
[10:33] uh that one that showed mercy you kind
[10:34] of end up in a different place
[10:36] but they're connected together and in
[10:38] verse 29 it says but he willing to
[10:40] justify himself senator
[10:42] unto jesus and who is my neighbor now
[10:45] that's the second question that's the
[10:47] question that we're examining
[10:48] in these series of services as the lord
[10:50] would lead but the first question is
[10:52] found in verse 25
[10:54] and behold a certain lawyer stood up and
[10:56] tempted him saying master
[10:57] what shall i do to inherit eternal life
[11:01] so the second question who is my
[11:03] neighbor is not divorced from or
[11:05] separate from
[11:06] his initial line of questioning his
[11:08] initial line of question is what he
[11:10] could do
[11:11] to inherit eternal life so for the
[11:13] remainder of this discussion between
[11:15] christ and this lawyer
[11:17] we have to remember that eternal life is
[11:19] at the core of it it's at the center of
[11:21] it
[11:22] and eternal life is essentially an issue
[11:23] whether it be how you obtain it
[11:25] how it's expressed or what it what it
[11:27] involves the question is
[11:28] how can i inherit eternal life and then
[11:31] jesus is going to start from that point
[11:33] and and i'm saying this and i'm laboring
[11:35] on it right now
[11:36] do not divorce or separate the next
[11:39] stage of the conversation and the next
[11:41] question
[11:41] from the central question of what is
[11:43] eternal life
[11:45] and this phrase of inherit eternal life
[11:47] it would be a phrase that would have
[11:48] been used by a jewish
[11:50] jewish rabbis it was a phrase that would
[11:51] have been familiar in the oral tradition
[11:54] in the torah which is later memorialized
[11:56] in the talmud
[11:57] so the the question of eternal life and
[11:59] how you can inherit eternal life
[12:01] and even the issue of eternal life isn't
[12:03] foreign
[12:04] to a jew to a rabbi to a levite so when
[12:07] we read it we say
[12:08] well how can i inherit eternal life we
[12:10] think in terms of christian things wow
[12:12] how can i be a christian how can i enter
[12:14] eternal life we think of salvation
[12:15] that's given on the cross
[12:17] and how we receive eternal life this
[12:18] would have been a different mode of
[12:20] thinking
[12:20] prior to the sacrifice and prior to even
[12:23] the knowledge that the messiah would be
[12:24] a lamb
[12:25] to be slain that we might receive
[12:27] eternal life so this was a question that
[12:29] was not
[12:30] unfamiliar to a levite to a priest to a
[12:32] rabbi
[12:33] in daniel chapter 12 verse 2 it says and
[12:35] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[12:37] the earth shall awake
[12:38] some to everlasting life and some to
[12:40] shame
[12:41] in everlasting contempt so it's an old
[12:43] testament concept
[12:45] and they used the phrase even of abraham
[12:47] and isaac and jacob and the phrases
[12:48] often used the world to come
[12:50] they believed in an afterlife they
[12:52] believed in eternal life
[12:54] and so the question is how can i inherit
[12:57] eternal life
[12:58] and the conclusion of this parable as we
[13:01] refer to it or this
[13:02] change has not varied from the original
[13:05] question
[13:06] when we get down to the end and jesus
[13:07] says go and do thou likewise he has not
[13:09] varied from the original subject
[13:11] of what is eternal life and how can i
[13:13] inherit it
[13:15] and it actually there's i i felt just to
[13:19] maybe lay this out there as i pondered
[13:21] it myself personally
[13:23] just to address maybe a difficult issue
[13:24] that's presented by the this
[13:26] conversation with this lawyer
[13:28] because if we look at verse 25 he says
[13:30] master what shall i do to inherit
[13:32] eternal life
[13:32] and he said on him what is written in
[13:34] the law how read is thou the law what is
[13:36] written therein and how do you read what
[13:38] are your conclusions based upon the law
[13:40] and jesus would have known uh that there
[13:42] was this this thought process of what it
[13:44] would take to inherit eternal life and
[13:46] and how valuable the law is so this is a
[13:48] very clever question by jesus
[13:50] he says and he answering him said this
[13:53] is the lawyer now thou shalt love the
[13:55] lord thy god with all thy heart
[13:56] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[13:58] strength with all thy mind
[13:59] and thy neighbor as thyself and jesus
[14:03] says unto him in verse 28 thou has
[14:04] answered right
[14:07] this do and thou shalt live
[14:10] now when i read that it begs the
[14:11] question for me can a man
[14:13] obtain eternal life by merely obeying
[14:15] the law
[14:16] and that's kind of the question that you
[14:18] you read how can i obtain eternal life
[14:20] well what do you read in the law he says
[14:21] love thy the lord with all thy heart
[14:23] love with all thy soul and i strength
[14:25] love thy neighbor as myself he says
[14:26] this dude you've answered correctly
[14:27] you've answered write this do and thou
[14:29] shalt live
[14:30] but jesus isn't necessarily trying to
[14:33] answer the question in a way to where we
[14:35] would conclude all i got to do is keep
[14:37] the law i have eternal and have eternal
[14:39] life
[14:39] jesus has actually turned the question
[14:41] against the questioner he's actually
[14:44] completely
[14:45] he's he's led the lawyer into a box and
[14:47] as a lawyer when you cross-examine
[14:49] somebody you ask certain questions
[14:50] and what you're doing is building the
[14:52] box so that you finally ask the last
[14:54] question and you've impeached them
[14:55] and you never ask a question you don't
[14:57] know the answer to this is just some
[14:58] lessons in cross-examination
[15:00] for anybody who's taking the bar exam
[15:02] soon and going to be a lawyer you never
[15:04] ask a question you don't know the answer
[15:05] to when you're cross-examining somebody
[15:07] and you only ask yes or no questions
[15:09] regard so you already suggest something
[15:12] in the question and regardless what they
[15:13] say the jury's like he beats his wife
[15:15] like have you when did you stop beating
[15:18] your wife well there's really no way you
[15:19] can answer that
[15:20] without uh without suggesting that you
[15:22] did at least at one time there's a way
[15:24] that people can be
[15:25] incriminated just by the way you ask
[15:26] your question and i'm by no means
[15:28] wanting to intimidate you if i ever ask
[15:30] you a question
[15:31] but this is what jesus does in a way he
[15:34] builds a box
[15:35] and now he said well what do you read in
[15:36] the law and this lawyer very eager to
[15:38] stand up for the law which they believe
[15:40] jesus is just trotting all over and very
[15:42] eager to stand up for what they identify
[15:44] themselves the law that was given by
[15:45] moses
[15:46] answers but he's really led him into a
[15:48] corner and he says
[15:49] well you're right do that and you'll
[15:51] live and now the lawyer's got to get out
[15:53] of the box
[15:54] he's got to find a way out of the corner
[15:56] and that's what basically the second
[15:58] justifying question comes up
[16:00] because now he gets a little bit
[16:01] defensive because jesus says
[16:03] do this do this thou
[16:07] answered right do this and this is where
[16:08] the real hardship lays
[16:10] because his response surprises the
[16:12] lawyer
[16:14] and jesus according to the law is saying
[16:16] that eternal life
[16:18] was not to be had without this in other
[16:20] words according to the law
[16:21] you could not have eternal life and not
[16:24] do these things
[16:25] and so he convicts the lawyer of the
[16:28] impossibility of obtaining eternal life
[16:30] because he cannot perfectly keep the law
[16:32] so it's really beautiful the way that
[16:34] jesus just very quickly
[16:35] gets the lawyer to espouse his belief in
[16:38] the law and then jesus
[16:39] oh you've said very good do this and
[16:40] you'll live and now he has to
[16:42] somehow justify himself because now he's
[16:44] convicted have i perfectly kept the law
[16:47] am i able to love the lord thy god with
[16:49] all my heart soul and mind am i able to
[16:50] do these things
[16:51] am i able to love my neighbor as myself
[16:55] and so
[16:55] feeling this conviction the lawyer
[16:57] retorts well who is my neighbor
[16:59] and as i pondered i thought perhaps he
[17:01] was most conscious of his attitude and
[17:03] treatment of others
[17:05] and even non-jews and that's why he
[17:08] he answers so instinctively well if i
[17:11] must keep this part of the law to obtain
[17:13] eternal life
[17:15] i i feel blameless perhaps in my my
[17:18] belief that i love god with all that i
[17:19] am
[17:20] but the question of how do i treat my
[17:22] neighbor then it becomes well who is my
[17:24] neighbor
[17:25] he might feel very good about how he
[17:27] treats another jew but jesus says just
[17:29] in just
[17:30] two statements completely broke this
[17:32] person down
[17:33] and has them trying to justify
[17:35] themselves trying to figure a way out of
[17:37] this box
[17:38] and so the parable of the good samaritan
[17:40] and i this we're coming just right to
[17:42] the thrust of what's in my heart for
[17:43] this evening
[17:44] the parable of the good samaritan and
[17:46] the way that jesus answers this question
[17:48] he says well who is my neighbor and
[17:50] jesus immediately says a certain man
[17:52] went down from jerusalem to jericho
[17:54] and and i'm just going to scratch the
[17:56] surface of some of these things and i
[17:58] want to go very
[17:59] much deeper into the elements of this
[18:00] parable even how brother branham
[18:02] identified
[18:03] jerusalem to jericho as a downward
[18:05] backsliding
[18:07] and all these different elements there's
[18:08] so much depth to this question
[18:10] uh to this story into this this parable
[18:13] but when jesus begins to tell this story
[18:15] of the certain man who went from
[18:17] jerusalem down to jericho
[18:18] he's going right back to the question of
[18:20] eternal life
[18:22] he's not just merely answering who is
[18:24] your neighbor and now let's change the
[18:26] subject
[18:26] and let's begin to talk about who is
[18:28] your neighbor he's still looking at this
[18:30] concept of eternal life
[18:32] because he says in verse 37 as fda says
[18:35] and who is it that you think is the
[18:36] neighbor to him that was
[18:38] fallen upon by thieves in verse 37 and
[18:40] he said the answer the lawyer says he
[18:41] that
[18:42] showed mercy on him then said jesus
[18:45] unto him go and do that likewise
[18:48] this is still pointing us to eternal
[18:51] life
[18:51] because he says he that showed mercy the
[18:53] lawyer's answer
[18:55] he that showed mercy upon the wounded
[18:57] and mercy means kindness or goodness
[18:59] towards those who are afflicted or those
[19:01] who are harmed
[19:02] and a willingness or a desire to help
[19:04] them
[19:05] it's not just merely saying oh bless his
[19:07] heart or old poor soul or that poor guy
[19:08] or
[19:09] boy that person's a mess or mercy lord
[19:12] have mercy on them but it's actually
[19:13] mercy to have mercy on somebody
[19:15] not only requires you to recognize a
[19:18] weakness a deficiency a harm or
[19:20] them to be a victim of something but
[19:22] there also has to be a willingness
[19:24] or desire to help them in their need or
[19:26] in their weakness
[19:27] so he says he that showed mercy on him
[19:29] he that recognized the need
[19:31] and and towards the wounded and had a
[19:33] desire to help them
[19:35] and so it's the lawyer's answer that the
[19:38] samaritan
[19:39] was the neighbor to the victim jesus
[19:41] doesn't say so and certainly it's
[19:43] implied i wouldn't argue that it's not
[19:44] implied
[19:45] but it's the lawyer's answer that the
[19:46] samaritan the one that you perhaps
[19:48] wouldn't have expected to show mercy
[19:50] he's the one that was a neighbor to the
[19:52] victim and then jesus says go
[19:55] and if i could put it in these words go
[19:57] and show kindness to the hurting
[19:59] go and show care and kindness towards
[20:02] the afflicted
[20:03] go and you yourself show a desire to
[20:05] help
[20:06] and and as i said a moment ago he hasn't
[20:08] left the question of eternal life
[20:10] so you might be asking yourself how does
[20:11] this answer the question
[20:13] or speak to eternal life but there's a
[20:15] tremendous connection that's being made
[20:17] master what can i do to inherit eternal
[20:20] life well what does the law say well the
[20:21] law says to
[20:22] love the lord and to love your neighbor
[20:23] with all your heart and he says
[20:25] very good do this and you shall live and
[20:28] then the lawyer
[20:29] by this by these statements by christ
[20:31] and even his own answer
[20:33] he feels compelled to ask the question
[20:35] of to expand upon
[20:37] love thy neighbor as thyself well then
[20:38] who is my neighbor and jesus
[20:40] in giving his answer has now connected
[20:42] the the activity
[20:44] or the behavior of the samaritan to what
[20:47] eternal life
[20:48] is and and i want to start by reading a
[20:51] statement i say start i want to
[20:53] advance further in this by reading a
[20:54] statement on that day on calvary
[20:56] and i know some of you are probably
[20:57] already just plugging right into where
[20:59] i'm going with this
[21:00] and he's talking about our salvation and
[21:02] what was wrought for us on calvary in
[21:03] the shedding of blood and accepting of
[21:05] the
[21:05] of the sacrifice and how that after
[21:08] we've been uh
[21:09] sealed by the holy ghost and we
[21:10] experienced this great salvation he says
[21:12] but don't look to what you've done
[21:14] look what that day on calvary did to you
[21:17] it paid your price it settled the
[21:20] question let's just
[21:21] all fellowship in this today just begin
[21:23] to have a heart for the person that's
[21:25] sitting next to you behind you in front
[21:26] of you
[21:27] because the devil always tries to bring
[21:29] up the sin question always tries to
[21:31] bring up imagination
[21:32] conscience memory reason and affection
[21:34] and he tries to tie that with sin to
[21:35] beat us down to keep us from going
[21:37] forward
[21:37] but brother man says your skin your sins
[21:40] be as scarlet
[21:41] they're white as snow red like crimson
[21:44] white like wool it says then you have no
[21:46] sin you are
[21:48] perfectly sinless no matter what you've
[21:50] done or what you do
[21:52] you are still sinless oh this scares
[21:55] this scares some people because they're
[21:57] afraid that if you preach to a believer
[21:58] that they're sinless then all they're
[22:00] going to do is sin well if they just
[22:02] take you at your word for it and they
[22:04] just
[22:04] they want to take it carnally i could
[22:06] see that being a danger but a sincere
[22:08] hearted believer is going to hear that
[22:09] and say if i'm sinless
[22:11] then i can be sinless if yesterday's sin
[22:13] don't matter afternoon sins don't matter
[22:15] then it drives them to a greater
[22:17] consecration and a place of surrender to
[22:19] where they can live this life before
[22:21] christ
[22:21] that is that is uh that is befitting of
[22:24] the grace that they've received
[22:26] says then you have no sin you're
[22:27] perfectly sinless no matter what you've
[22:29] done or what you do you're still sinless
[22:31] as long as you've accepted jesus christ
[22:33] as your savior your sins are forgiven
[22:36] anything that's forgiven is remitted and
[22:37] forgot about that's wonderful
[22:40] amen he says then what does it do
[22:44] it gives you after that condition his
[22:46] spirit to follow him
[22:48] and do his he did for others who is
[22:50] following on so it's
[22:52] it has this rippled down effect that
[22:55] he what he's done for you it puts you in
[22:57] a condition to live for him
[22:59] for others who are following on because
[23:01] now there's others
[23:02] that need to be impacted so he says he's
[23:05] just one man the perfect man
[23:07] he gave his life and made an example for
[23:09] you
[23:10] now what must we do if i could connect
[23:13] it to how he's saying this it gives you
[23:16] after that condition it gives you his
[23:17] spirit to follow him now that i have his
[23:19] spirit what must we do he says now the
[23:21] first thing i want to say
[23:23] is jesus never lived for himself
[23:27] his life was spent for others that's
[23:30] perfectly eternal life so perfectly
[23:34] eternal life
[23:35] is living for others jesus never lived
[23:38] for himself his life was spent for
[23:39] others
[23:40] and living for others my paraphrasing
[23:42] there is perfectly eternal life
[23:44] so when you say you go to church and you
[23:46] do good things
[23:47] that's fine nothing against doing good
[23:50] things certainly nothing against going
[23:52] to church or we would be
[23:54] maybe on some measure a hypocrite
[23:56] tonight but he says when you say you go
[23:58] to church you do good things that's fine
[23:59] but when you live your life to yourself
[24:02] you have an eternal life eternal life
[24:05] is living for others it proved it when
[24:08] it come in the lamb of god
[24:10] he lived and had eternal life because he
[24:12] did not live for himself he lived for
[24:14] others
[24:14] and you receive eternal life by
[24:17] receiving
[24:18] that day receiving calvary receiving the
[24:20] cross and you don't live for yourself
[24:22] no more you live for others
[24:26] so can you say how what jesus's answer
[24:28] in the parable of the good samaritan is
[24:30] connected with eternal life
[24:31] because here's the samaritan he does not
[24:34] pass by the wounded he does not pass by
[24:36] the aggrieved and the victim but he
[24:38] renders aid to him
[24:39] and the others the levi the priest may
[24:41] have been very busy may have had a lot
[24:43] of things to do but they weren't willing
[24:44] to stop and help
[24:46] but the samaritan stopped for the other
[24:48] person who was hurting
[24:49] and jesus said that's perfectly eternal
[24:51] life when you live your life to yourself
[24:52] you don't have eternal life
[24:54] because eternal life is living for
[24:56] others he says
[24:57] you when you receive your salvation you
[24:59] don't live for yourself no more
[25:01] you live for others so perfectly eternal
[25:04] life
[25:04] is a life that's spent for others
[25:07] brother branham makes this statement in
[25:09] revelations chapter 5
[25:11] part 1 he says a few days ago i was
[25:14] sitting talking to my loyal little
[25:15] friend here in the city of medical
[25:17] doctor sam
[25:18] and dare and he said how you doing bill
[25:20] and i said oh pretty fair i suppose doc
[25:22] i said yourself and he said oh a lot of
[25:24] patience said i had 15 examinations this
[25:27] afternoon i said well that's good as
[25:28] long as it's just examinations
[25:30] and finding nothing wrong he says and
[25:33] you know we got to talking back when we
[25:34] were boys
[25:35] i said well doc i don't know just how
[25:37] long i'm going to be around we're both
[25:39] in our 50s
[25:40] that's true bill but all these years
[25:42] about 31 years of ministry now
[25:44] i've kept my heart prepared for that
[25:46] hour when he comes
[25:47] so it doesn't matter when he comes so he
[25:50] said that's true
[25:51] and i said brother brahm said this the
[25:53] greatest thrill i have
[25:54] is living for others so this is great
[25:58] the greatest thrill he has
[25:59] and he said that's what life is makes
[26:01] life real is not what you can do or
[26:03] accomplish for yourself
[26:04] but what you can do for others now think
[26:07] of this
[26:08] this conversation now we've already
[26:10] witnessed one conversation between
[26:12] a lawyer and jesus christ now we see a
[26:14] conversation between a doctor and a
[26:16] minister
[26:17] and the conversation seems to be in a
[26:18] little bit better channel than the one
[26:19] that the lawyer was in
[26:21] and they're talking about how you can
[26:22] live for others and brother branson the
[26:23] greatest thrill i've had in 31 years of
[26:25] ministry
[26:26] is living for others and the doctors
[26:27] like that's what makes life real
[26:30] what makes life real is what you can
[26:31] accomplish for others what you can do
[26:33] for others not for yourself
[26:34] and then brother man says see that's
[26:35] your that's when you're really living
[26:38] and if there happens to be someone
[26:39] amongst us who's never did that tried to
[26:41] live for somebody else
[26:42] give that a try and just see how much
[26:45] more life holds for you
[26:47] when you will not live for what you can
[26:49] get yourself out of life but what you
[26:50] can give someone else
[26:52] in life why isn't that wonderful to
[26:54] think that if you've never tried this
[26:56] way of thinking before if you've never
[26:57] tried this as a lifestyle
[26:59] as a governing principle in your life
[27:01] don't live your life for what you can
[27:03] get out of life
[27:04] but live your life to see what you can
[27:06] give someone else
[27:08] in life he says try to live that way for
[27:11] once
[27:12] and i think that it isn't instinctive
[27:14] for most people in the la
[27:15] day and age that we live in now it's
[27:17] really get yours while you can even if
[27:19] it's at the expense
[27:20] of somebody else getting theirs get what
[27:21] you can when you can look out for
[27:23] yourself
[27:23] if the people's rights has become
[27:25] individual rights to where there's a
[27:26] point where they don't even know where
[27:27] to stop
[27:29] when my right of fringe is on your right
[27:31] now how are we going to mediate this is
[27:32] going to be rock paper scissors
[27:34] we're going to flip a coin if
[27:35] everybody's rights matter then it's just
[27:36] a point to where
[27:37] there's no way of ever having this
[27:39] integrity or
[27:40] or this line that we can say this is
[27:42] this is moral this is principled it's
[27:44] just a
[27:44] democracy it's like a ship without an
[27:46] anchor
[27:48] and so we have we realized then that
[27:49] brother branham is saying hey if you can
[27:51] live for somebody else that changes
[27:52] things when you're no longer living for
[27:54] yourself or you're living for other
[27:56] people he says
[27:57] this is the way to live he says you'll
[27:58] find that it's more blessed than riches
[28:01] or anything that can be thought of
[28:02] is what you can do for someone else to
[28:04] make life's burdens
[28:06] and and i i'm just going to inject this
[28:09] the way that the the conversation the
[28:10] state was being made you would maybe
[28:12] think you say make someone's burdens
[28:13] lighters or make somebody's
[28:15] burdens taken away from them but he says
[28:17] which life in itself is a burden
[28:19] and it will make it light a little
[28:21] lighter for someone else
[28:23] you don't know the joy unless you've
[28:25] tried it once
[28:26] to do something for someone else can we
[28:28] all just take that into our
[28:30] hearts as individuals tonight that what
[28:32] brother adam is pointing us to is the
[28:33] greatest thrill is living for others
[28:36] that's when you're really living is not
[28:38] what you can accomplish for yourself but
[28:39] what you can do for others
[28:40] and life holds so much more when you
[28:43] live to see what you can
[28:44] give somebody else in life and then
[28:47] let's just nail it down really tight
[28:49] perfectly eternal life is living for
[28:51] others so it would beg the question
[28:53] if you're selfish and not living for
[28:55] others the question would be well then
[28:56] do you have eternal life
[28:59] and then it would then our the way that
[29:01] we should internalize that is not to
[29:03] abandon our belief that we have eternal
[29:04] life
[29:05] but challenge ourselves what filters are
[29:07] in place that's keeping
[29:08] this unselfish life that we have done
[29:10] inside of us this nature of the
[29:12] lamb this nature to be self-sacrificial
[29:14] this nature to give
[29:15] this nature to serve what is it that's
[29:17] hindering it could be scars it could be
[29:18] complexes could be
[29:20] uh the stumbling blocks that we've seen
[29:22] along the way and bad examples
[29:23] but lord i want to free up this nature
[29:25] of christ to be a servant
[29:27] that it could exude through me and that
[29:29] i can no longer be looking out after my
[29:31] own
[29:32] but looking upon the needs of others
[29:35] because that's what eternal life is
[29:36] eternal life is
[29:37] living for others it says you don't know
[29:39] joy until you've lived for someone else
[29:41] if you are experiencing even a
[29:45] melancholy or depression or even anxiety
[29:48] you'll find that if you could come if
[29:50] you can identify
[29:52] a way that you are helpful a need that
[29:56] you're
[29:56] meeting focus on the fact that you can
[29:58] give something that you have
[30:00] a benefit that you can do to somebody
[30:02] else a way that you can aid or you can
[30:04] help
[30:04] you'll find that it lightens that
[30:06] anxiety it'll help lighten this burden
[30:08] of depression and melancholy and
[30:10] sometimes you just feel very overwhelmed
[30:11] but when you
[30:12] think about how that you can be helpful
[30:14] how that you're meeting the need and
[30:15] there's a service to give
[30:16] it has a way of lightening your own
[30:18] burdens not just those who you're going
[30:19] to serve but it'll actually lighten your
[30:21] own when you recognize
[30:23] that i have a need that there's a
[30:24] there's a need that i can meet there's a
[30:26] ministry that i can
[30:27] walk in there's a way that i can serve
[30:30] and then would you not realize then why
[30:32] the devil would want to take away those
[30:33] kind of confessions from you
[30:35] make you feel worthless make you feel
[30:36] useless make you feel like you don't
[30:37] have a place and
[30:38] and i don't there's nothing i can do and
[30:40] i have this problem and i've had that
[30:42] problem and i'm
[30:43] damaged goods or i wear a scarlet letter
[30:45] whatever it may be but listen
[30:46] you have a place within the body of
[30:48] christ there's a
[30:50] measure that you have to give out
[30:51] there's a hundred fold in your life that
[30:53] can be expressed
[30:54] and it does not deprive you of service
[30:56] you have
[30:57] something you can give
[31:00] in galatians chapter 6 verses 1 to 10
[31:04] there's a there's a lot of principles
[31:06] here that i look forward to maybe
[31:08] unpacking
[31:09] more later but i want to hit just a few
[31:11] highlights galatians chapter 6 verses 1
[31:13] to 10
[31:14] brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[31:16] fault ye which are spiritual
[31:19] restore such a one in the spirit of
[31:20] meekness considering thyself
[31:22] lest thou also be tempted i could just
[31:25] see the image of this
[31:26] man who went down from jerusalem to
[31:29] jericho
[31:30] went from the heavenly place jerusalem
[31:32] now he's falling down
[31:34] he's backsliding his brother man said
[31:36] going to jericho so i could see the
[31:38] image of even this man of luke chapter
[31:40] 10
[31:40] in this verse if any man be overtaken in
[31:42] a fault
[31:44] he says ye which are spiritual are to
[31:46] restore the one who's overtaken in the
[31:48] fault
[31:49] but you must do it in a spirit of
[31:50] meekness
[31:52] and you have a spirit of meekness
[31:54] because you consider yourself
[31:56] lest thou but also be tempted so there's
[31:58] so much that goes into this
[32:00] and if you've ever been in a situation
[32:01] where you made a mistake you offended
[32:03] somebody or you did some great harm or
[32:04] were accused of being do it
[32:06] of doing a great harm but nobody reached
[32:08] out to restore you or nobody else wanted
[32:09] to get you
[32:10] take you out of that fault you who are
[32:11] overtaken and nobody else did it
[32:14] and reached out to you to help you
[32:15] overcome it then then the conclusion i
[32:17] come to anymore is they're just not
[32:19] spiritual
[32:20] or they realize being spiritual they
[32:22] can't do it in the spirit of meekness
[32:23] considering the known cells but
[32:25] these those who are spiritual are
[32:26] commissioned according to the scripture
[32:28] in a spirit of meekness considering
[32:29] their own selves to see somebody who's
[32:31] stumbling see somebody who's overtaken
[32:33] in a fall
[32:33] and help them not beat them up not tell
[32:36] them and inform them they've been
[32:38] overtaken in a fault because a lot of
[32:40] times we just tell people the obvious
[32:41] you really messed up pal
[32:43] and like yeah thanks i think i figured
[32:45] that part out well you know what you did
[32:47] wrong i think i
[32:48] know that better than you all right just
[32:50] wanted to know see you later
[32:53] and uh maybe that's what the priest said
[32:55] when he walked by the guy said you
[32:56] should have had some mace
[32:58] you wouldn't be in that problem maybe
[33:00] the levite walks by why aren't you
[33:01] packing this is an open carry country
[33:04] you wouldn't have those problems if
[33:05] you'd have taken a different way
[33:07] and there's maybe a lot of opinions but
[33:09] nobody wants to offer a solution
[33:11] but someone who's spiritual and i trust
[33:13] that you're spiritual tonight
[33:14] you you are tasked and you're
[33:16] scripturally commissioned in a spirit of
[33:17] meekness to restore somebody who's
[33:19] overtaken in a fault
[33:20] and then it makes this statement bear ye
[33:23] one another's burdens
[33:25] and so fulfill the law of christ
[33:28] now this is uh this is very weighty no
[33:31] pun intended
[33:32] saying bear ye one another's burdens and
[33:35] in doing so you're going to fulfill the
[33:37] law of christ
[33:38] this can go right back to even how jesus
[33:40] was saying himself
[33:41] love thy neighbor as thyself he said you
[33:44] fulfill the law of christ by bearing one
[33:46] another's burden so he's telling you to
[33:47] feel for
[33:48] and not just feel for them but assist
[33:50] each other when someone has a burden
[33:52] assist them not just be like oh that
[33:54] must be heavy
[33:55] but reach out to him show mercy do
[33:57] something to help them overcome
[33:59] and he says bear ye another's burdens
[34:02] and that word bird means a heaviness or
[34:04] weight or trouble
[34:06] and the very greek word that's used
[34:07] there is the idea of bringing down so it
[34:10] says
[34:10] bear one another's burdens a weight
[34:12] that's causing someone to
[34:14] bow under the pressure so we are
[34:16] commissioned to bear another's burdens
[34:18] if it's weighing them down and it's
[34:21] causing them
[34:22] to be weakened or to be troubled so he
[34:24] says for if a man thinks himself to be
[34:26] something when he is nothing he
[34:28] deceiveth himself
[34:29] but let every man prove his own work and
[34:31] then shall he have rejoicing in himself
[34:33] alone
[34:33] in not in another for every man shall
[34:36] bear
[34:37] his own burden now if you read this and
[34:40] you haven't left the principle that was
[34:42] elicited in verse 2
[34:44] immediately you feel like there's a
[34:45] contradiction or at least a paradox
[34:48] because he says you have to bear one
[34:50] another's burdens
[34:51] but now he says every man shall bear his
[34:53] own burden
[34:55] we say well paul then what is it do i
[34:57] need to bear one another's burdens or do
[34:58] i need to bear my own burdens
[35:00] but he's showing that in this as he said
[35:03] already for if he
[35:04] any man think of himself to be something
[35:05] and every man must prove his own work
[35:07] he's talking about us as individuals we
[35:09] all must answer for ourselves
[35:12] and we don't have to answer for our
[35:14] neighbors we have to answer for
[35:15] ourselves
[35:17] and so if your neighbor does something
[35:19] he's going to answer for it
[35:21] you don't have to answer for what he's
[35:23] done but you'll answer for your attitude
[35:25] towards them
[35:27] the answer for how you respond to that
[35:29] or how you treat them so your answer
[35:31] not necessarily for his conduct but your
[35:33] attitude towards it
[35:35] or your response to it and so he says
[35:38] that every man must prove his own work
[35:40] and then he'll have rejoicing in himself
[35:41] and not another for every man shall bear
[35:43] his own burden
[35:44] and this burden here means load or
[35:46] obligation
[35:47] and the greek word that used it brings
[35:49] up the image of loading a ship that you
[35:51] have a responsibility you got to take
[35:52] these goods from point a to point b
[35:54] then you load it up and you load it
[35:56] wherein it's capable to bear it and to
[35:58] transport it to somewhere else
[35:59] so there's burdens that you receive that
[36:01] are your individual
[36:03] responsibility every man must account
[36:05] for himself he must answer for himself
[36:08] not his neighbor and every man must bear
[36:10] his own burden
[36:11] that he's been tasked with but when you
[36:13] see that your neighbor is being made
[36:15] heavy and brought down
[36:16] then bear that burden because it may be
[36:18] greater than what they're tasked with
[36:21] could be a burden that you're putting on
[36:23] them
[36:25] and so these are actually two different
[36:26] burdens two different burdens that are
[36:28] being
[36:28] referenced here so then he continues he
[36:31] says let him that is taught in the word
[36:33] communicate unto him that teacheth in
[36:34] all good things be not deceived god is
[36:37] not mocked for whatsoever man soweth
[36:39] that shall he also
[36:40] reap this fits right in with what you do
[36:42] in verse one what you do in verse two
[36:44] what you do in verse five there's a
[36:46] sowing that's taking place and therefore
[36:48] there's a reaping
[36:49] for he that sow up to his flesh shall of
[36:50] the flesh reap corruption
[36:52] but he that soweth to the spirit shall
[36:54] of the spirit
[36:55] reap life everlasting he that sows to
[36:59] the spirit
[37:00] labor sowing to the spirit will reap
[37:02] eternal life
[37:03] so it supports the truth that eternal
[37:05] life is living for others
[37:08] it's not saying that if you'll just sow
[37:09] to the spirit you will obtain
[37:11] eternal life and that you can somehow
[37:13] win it by your own good works
[37:14] but this is abundant living this is how
[37:17] that you can live
[37:18] fruitfully this is how you can live
[37:19] abundantly this is how you can live
[37:21] joyously
[37:22] this is how you can unburden the fruits
[37:23] of spirit in your own life
[37:25] is sowed to the spirit and you'll reap
[37:27] of the spirit life everlasting and a
[37:29] fruitful life
[37:30] so he says let us not be wearing while
[37:32] doing because that's how you sow to the
[37:34] spirit you're doing good you're doing
[37:36] the things that you ought to do
[37:37] for in due season we shall reap if we
[37:39] faint not and as we therefore have
[37:41] opportunity
[37:42] let us do good i don't know if you're
[37:44] reading the amplified or the new
[37:46] translation but my bible says let us do
[37:48] good
[37:48] unto all men
[37:53] i don't know of any notes in the column
[37:56] or any
[37:57] commentary anything that says no that's
[37:59] not what he meant
[38:00] he meant only some men he
[38:04] meant only these men or men only and not
[38:07] women no it's let us do good unto all
[38:09] men
[38:09] all mankind there's no listen there's no
[38:12] qualification for doing good unto all
[38:15] men
[38:16] and i mean i mean this very seriously
[38:19] that that
[38:20] one's preferences their orientations or
[38:22] lifestyle does not mean you have a right
[38:24] to hate them
[38:25] and do evil towards them you're not
[38:27] given any license to do something that
[38:29] is not christ-like
[38:31] say oh well that's just contrary to the
[38:32] word of god and you're going to spite
[38:34] them you're going to do evil to them
[38:35] you're going to try to make them
[38:36] miserable
[38:36] you've abandoned the principles of
[38:38] scripture and we should we should
[38:40] live in this fear that if we do good
[38:42] unto all men we're somehow advocating
[38:44] something that's unrighteous or
[38:45] advocating something that's perverted no
[38:47] you do no more harm to the name of
[38:49] christ in the name of christianity by
[38:50] doing harm to those who don't agree with
[38:53] you
[38:53] than you ever would by doing kindness
[38:57] exhibit the nature of christ show that
[38:58] you're you can live above it that you're
[39:00] not intimidated by it
[39:03] when you see people have so much vitriol
[39:04] and hatred for certain things sometimes
[39:06] begs
[39:06] the question of whether or not they have
[39:08] a problem themselves where
[39:10] where's the hatred coming from where's
[39:11] the spike coming from that doesn't come
[39:13] from the word that doesn't come from the
[39:14] cross
[39:17] but he says do good unto all men
[39:21] then especially unto them who are of the
[39:23] household of faith
[39:24] so there's an especially that would
[39:27] require some discernment as to who is of
[39:28] the household of faith
[39:30] but it puts us on guard i must do good
[39:32] unto all men and if i'm doing good unto
[39:34] all men
[39:34] i wouldn't have to worry about doing
[39:36] wrong to someone of the household of
[39:37] faith
[39:38] so i at least want to start from the
[39:40] principle that the scripture is telling
[39:41] me
[39:42] that we should do good unto all men this
[39:44] isn't paul's suggestion
[39:46] this has been a given the the stamp and
[39:48] the seal of god's breath the theoph
[39:50] nustos
[39:50] has breathed these words all scriptures
[39:52] given by inspiration
[39:54] let us do good unto all men and if i'm
[39:57] doing that then i'm in a better position
[39:58] to especially do good
[40:00] under the household of faith
[40:03] brother branham says in the world has
[40:04] fallen apart
[40:06] i appreciate you you're just pulling so
[40:09] fervently tonight
[40:11] and i would like to say that it the
[40:13] harder you pull the longer i preach but
[40:14] sometimes the harder you pull the faster
[40:16] i preach
[40:18] but the message world has fallen apart
[40:20] the other man says i was talking to the
[40:21] cab driver coming down
[40:23] we was talking about some delinquent
[40:25] children up there and he said i think
[40:27] it's the parents
[40:28] and i said amen fellow i don't know who
[40:31] you are but you're on the right road
[40:33] well i must have just thrilled brother
[40:34] brannan wow yes i preach it's parental
[40:37] delinquency not juvenile delinquency
[40:39] he says man you're on the right road and
[40:41] i said that's right it's too bad that
[40:43] they took the bible out of the home and
[40:45] give them a deck of cards
[40:48] now this is a this is a tremendous
[40:49] principle because
[40:51] none of you might have a deck of card in
[40:52] your house right i mean
[40:55] now we just can do it online we can do
[40:56] it on a computer solitaire was just put
[40:58] on there by bill gates thank you bill
[40:59] gates i can play cards on my computer
[41:01] so we may not have a deck of cards it
[41:03] might seem old-fashioned sometimes
[41:04] we can preach against going to bowling
[41:05] alleys we're like bowling alleys that's
[41:07] the most
[41:08] sanctified family fun there is anymore
[41:10] because
[41:11] it meant something different at the time
[41:13] right it was it was totally something
[41:15] different so we have to think about
[41:16] what is the principle that brother
[41:18] branham's eliciting right now what does
[41:20] he want us to think about
[41:21] you've taken the word and swapped it for
[41:23] something else
[41:25] so i could i could use a lot of names
[41:27] but just starting out you don't want to
[41:28] offend everybody
[41:30] but you there's a lot of things that
[41:32] could be elicited here there's a lot of
[41:33] things that you could pinpoint but let
[41:35] the holy spirit lead you in your own
[41:36] life taking the word swapping it for
[41:38] something else
[41:38] then he makes this statement and that
[41:40] started in the church
[41:45] so the process of taking the word and
[41:47] replacing it with something else
[41:49] happened in the home then it happens in
[41:51] the church and that's the order you'll
[41:52] find that's the order it always happens
[41:54] that way
[41:54] the church doesn't let the bars down
[41:56] first the families start doing it
[41:58] and that's how it gets in the church if
[42:01] you don't have a word standard in the
[42:02] church just let the family start doing
[42:04] it and the bars will stop dropping
[42:06] that's why i think our mission even as a
[42:08] church is to inspire families
[42:10] encourage family equip families with the
[42:12] tools necessary
[42:13] to keep the standard in the home because
[42:15] the husbands they're the pastors to
[42:16] their wives the husbands are the
[42:18] shepherd in the home the wife's the
[42:19] associate pastor
[42:20] you have your own little flock that
[42:21] you're that you're leading that you're
[42:23] guiding
[42:23] and that that's the principle that we
[42:25] want to really encourage not that we
[42:26] just come to church to be told what to
[42:28] do and figure
[42:29] you know this is what you should be
[42:29] doing this is what you should be doing
[42:30] but trying to encourage you because
[42:32] you're the defense
[42:34] you're the health of the church you're
[42:35] they're the ones that keep the church
[42:36] clean that keep the church pure
[42:38] not the deacons at the door with the
[42:39] measuring stick but the families the
[42:41] fathers in the homes the mothers who are
[42:42] looking out after their children
[42:44] she says what happened in the family
[42:46] taking the word and swapping it out for
[42:48] entertainment
[42:50] those are my words now he said that
[42:52] started in the church
[42:55] so a process of usurping the word and
[42:57] flop taking out the word and the purity
[42:59] of the word
[42:59] in mixing in something else that holds
[43:02] people's attention
[43:04] and and and keeps them from being bored
[43:06] entertains them
[43:08] so he says and that's starting the
[43:09] church i was standing on the elevator a
[43:10] few moments ago
[43:11] and a certain woman on there talking to
[43:13] another said well you know this is a
[43:14] wonderful
[43:15] thing our church is given a card party
[43:18] and how they were going to have some
[43:20] kind of thanksgiving turkey affair
[43:22] and they wasn't going out of a
[43:23] protestant church he says
[43:25] and they was going out there was going
[43:28] gambling he goes lottery bunko dances
[43:32] all when it gets to that time that
[43:34] people have to do stuff like that
[43:37] let me just kind of read through this
[43:39] again he
[43:41] exchanges he tells us of an exchange
[43:42] with a cab driver he says man the
[43:44] problem with the world today is the
[43:45] parents he's like you're right
[43:47] the families let down the bar and then
[43:49] he says it's too bad they took the bible
[43:51] out of the home and given them a deck of
[43:52] cards and then brother brandon says you
[43:53] know what we've done the same thing in
[43:54] the church
[43:55] because i heard these ladies talk in the
[43:56] elevator how they were their church was
[43:58] given a card party
[43:59] and they're having some kind of
[44:00] thanksgiving turkey affair and they was
[44:02] going he says out of a protestant church
[44:04] and he says gambling lottery bunko
[44:08] dances i don't know if bunko is
[44:10] necessarily but i think it's some kind
[44:11] of card game
[44:12] he says when it gets to a time that
[44:14] people have to do stuff like that
[44:16] to entertain the church
[44:19] now again we don't even know what bunko
[44:22] is
[44:22] so we're we're not tempted to bunk oh we
[44:25] don't know how bunko got into church
[44:26] but he starts talking about gambling
[44:28] lottery dances it's the principle
[44:30] not of specifically taking the bible out
[44:33] and
[44:33] buying a deck of cards and putting it on
[44:35] your end table but what is it that has
[44:37] taken place
[44:38] of the word have we allowed the worship
[44:41] services to have more preeminence than
[44:43] the preaching
[44:44] have we allowed position to mean more
[44:46] than the preaching
[44:47] have we allowed the politics to mean
[44:49] more than the preaching
[44:51] whatever it might be it may not be
[44:52] bunker it may not be gambling or lottery
[44:54] but he says anything
[44:55] that binds the people to church
[44:57] attendance and not
[44:58] the word is the swapping that he's
[45:01] preaching against
[45:03] he says to entertain the church what to
[45:05] get their attention
[45:06] to be the drawing card it's amazing how
[45:09] quickly children to run will run to a
[45:11] screen
[45:12] if they hear something playing on it
[45:14] they're just like a a
[45:16] a a bug to a nightlight
[45:19] why because they're drawn to it and in
[45:21] the same way he's saying
[45:22] are we having to put up artificial light
[45:24] to get people to come to church
[45:27] is there a way that we want to get them
[45:28] to stick and make them come back and
[45:30] make them be there he says if we've
[45:31] taken
[45:32] anything in the word and we've taken the
[45:34] word out and replaced it with someone
[45:36] else he said something else
[45:37] to entertain the church so this is what
[45:40] started in the church
[45:42] we use other things to get people to
[45:44] come we use other things to get their
[45:46] attention
[45:46] and we use other things to keep them
[45:48] their attention he says to entertain the
[45:50] church
[45:52] he's identifying that process he says
[45:54] the church
[45:55] born again the holy ghost entertains the
[45:58] church
[45:59] with eternal life isn't that wonderful
[46:03] when i when i read it it struck me the
[46:04] holy ghost entertains the church
[46:07] with eternal life in other words the
[46:09] church's entertainment
[46:10] is eternal life now we could i i think
[46:14] that it could stand for the the the if
[46:16] you were to diagram it that the holy
[46:18] ghost entertains the church
[46:19] who has eternal life absolutely if you
[46:22] have eternal life the holy ghost
[46:24] entertains you
[46:25] but now let's think about what your
[46:27] entertainment is what is that
[46:29] once you've been put into that condition
[46:30] as brother brown said then what must we
[46:32] do
[46:32] those who are now have the holy spirit
[46:35] and you have this
[46:36] holy spirit inside of you and now you're
[46:38] following him to do as he did
[46:40] then what do we do next we are
[46:42] entertained by
[46:43] eternal life we have eternal life and
[46:46] then what do we do we live for others
[46:48] which
[46:48] is eternal life and what gives you joy
[46:50] what a brother says you don't know joy
[46:52] unless you've tried it what
[46:53] living for others so the holy spirit
[46:56] entertains the church
[46:58] with eternal life the holy holy spirit
[47:01] entertains the church by living for
[47:04] others
[47:06] that's our entertainment i mean that
[47:08] might be an interesting way
[47:09] if anybody asks you so what does your
[47:11] family do for fun we live for others
[47:13] and we're like okay all right what are
[47:16] you uh
[47:17] amish i i don't know what question they
[47:19] might ask you but they're certainly
[47:20] gonna try to figure out
[47:21] what makes you tick does the holy ghost
[47:24] desire to entertain the church
[47:27] he wants to entertain you with eternal
[47:28] life living for others becomes your
[47:30] entertainment
[47:32] living for others becomes your joy
[47:34] living for others becomes your
[47:35] becomes your motto it's kind of what
[47:37] makes you your family tick it's kind of
[47:39] this is the rule that we live by living
[47:41] for others
[47:41] if it doesn't fit within that paradigm
[47:43] we we question if what we're doing is
[47:45] right and we we examine whether or not
[47:47] we're doing something that would be
[47:48] displeasing to the lord and i'm not
[47:49] trying to suggest
[47:51] any absolutes in that but it's a
[47:53] principle that we can say we live by
[47:55] i have the holy spirit the church that
[47:57] has the holy spirit is entertained
[47:59] with eternal life
[48:02] so i would even ask of this church how
[48:04] does the holy ghost desire to entertain
[48:06] this church
[48:08] what and i'm saying this to a very very
[48:10] small group a very small audience but i
[48:12] say so it becomes the fabric of how we
[48:14] begin
[48:15] does the church does the church want to
[48:17] grow through programs
[48:19] do we want to get people's attention
[48:20] merely through activities but through
[48:22] all of it do we have a heart for people
[48:24] and we want to see
[48:25] the word touch their lives and make a
[48:26] difference for them
[48:28] even if it means they they never attend
[48:29] church again even if it means that they
[48:31] don't necessarily come and become
[48:33] what we would might call members of a
[48:34] church but do you desire to see the word
[48:36] touch people's hearts
[48:39] how does the holy ghost desire to
[48:41] entertain this church
[48:43] because the holy ghost entertains the
[48:44] church with eternal life
[48:47] eternal life is living for others so i
[48:49] believe we can do the math
[48:51] the holy ghost entertains the church
[48:53] with living for others
[48:57] that's what would keep us busy as a
[48:58] church that's what becomes our our
[49:00] guidelines and our parameters
[49:02] in romans chapter 15 verses 1 to 3
[49:05] he says we them that are strong
[49:08] ought to bear the infirmities of the
[49:10] weak and
[49:11] not to please ourselves so there's
[49:17] if you see a self-pleaser maybe they're
[49:19] weak
[49:23] brother tom was sharing with me a quote
[49:25] uh last week really really struck me i
[49:27] wrote it down i guess it certainly would
[49:28] have been applicable here but somebody
[49:30] who's always wanting attention
[49:31] he said their brother bam said they're
[49:32] spiritually sick
[49:35] and here he says when we that we that
[49:37] are strong ought to bear
[49:39] the infirmities of the weak and not to
[49:41] please ourselves
[49:44] and i would say weak or strong don't be
[49:46] a self-pleaser
[49:47] but if you are strong then you are
[49:49] equipped to bear the infirmities of the
[49:51] weak
[49:51] and don't use your strength as liberty
[49:54] to promote yourself
[49:55] or to do good unto yourself but but
[49:57] please others
[49:58] because he says let every one of us
[50:00] please his neighbor
[50:02] for his good to edificate for his good
[50:05] to edification i will expound upon this
[50:08] more perhaps at a later time but this is
[50:10] very clear
[50:11] let us every one of us please our
[50:13] neighbor
[50:14] for his good for his edifying
[50:17] for his good that he might be built up
[50:20] we who are strong
[50:21] will bear the infirmities of our
[50:23] neighbor that we might please
[50:24] our neighbor for his good for his
[50:26] building up for even christ pleased not
[50:28] himself
[50:29] and this is exactly what brother branham
[50:30] identifies when he says eternal life is
[50:32] living for others
[50:33] he points to how jesus christ lived so
[50:35] paul now speaking to the romans if
[50:36] you're strong
[50:37] bear the infirmities of the weak don't
[50:39] try to please yourself please your
[50:41] neighbor for his good for his building
[50:43] up that he that is weak might be made
[50:45] strong
[50:46] for even christ please not himself but
[50:48] as it is written the reproaches of them
[50:50] that reproach thee
[50:51] fell on me
[50:54] so he was he took on the burdens of the
[50:56] weak he took on the burdens of the
[50:57] reproach
[50:58] he's saying we should do likewise
[51:02] brother braham said in the message at
[51:03] thy word a person who lives their life
[51:05] to their self
[51:06] lives a selfish life we must live
[51:09] for others this is why the the
[51:12] prescription is not just to go find a
[51:14] a piece of land somewhere that's far far
[51:16] far far away from everybody else and
[51:17] just live his hermits
[51:19] because you can't have eternal life that
[51:21] way you say well is that all it takes to
[51:23] get eternal life no we're talking about
[51:24] living eternal life
[51:25] talking about manifesting it you cannot
[51:27] just be out on your own
[51:29] and be walking in this he says we must
[51:30] live for others bear ye one another's
[51:32] burdens and so fulfill the law of christ
[51:34] lord in galatians 6 2.
[51:39] and we've got to have a feeling for one
[51:41] another
[51:43] this is his words and we got to have a
[51:44] feeling for one another and therefore
[51:46] when you do all you know how to do
[51:48] then when you do lay down at night well
[51:51] you have the consolation knowing
[51:53] that you tried your best
[51:56] so it's not that there has to there's
[51:58] some perfection we're striving to attain
[51:59] we're everybody who has a need
[52:01] we have to meet it we're always stopping
[52:02] we're always doing this we're always
[52:03] just trying to go
[52:04] over the top to get it done he says no
[52:05] when you know you've done your best
[52:07] you lay your head down at night he says
[52:09] you have consolation
[52:10] i can't make and then he says this and i
[52:12] think this is very instructive to
[52:13] ministry
[52:14] but to all of us as we witness as we
[52:15] believe and pray for others he says i
[52:17] can't make
[52:18] everyone believe that's impossible
[52:21] jesus couldn't do that when he was on
[52:23] earth our goal isn't to try to make
[52:25] people believers
[52:26] listen if you make someone a believer
[52:29] then you
[52:30] make a make-believer all you'll be able
[52:33] to make
[52:34] is a make-believer and so we don't try
[52:37] to
[52:37] make people believe he says jesus
[52:39] couldn't do it brother branham couldn't
[52:41] do it and i know there'll be just a few
[52:42] that believes
[52:43] but if anything i can add to help the
[52:45] gospel that's my duty being here
[52:47] is to try to help somebody along the way
[52:50] so the goal isn't to try to make
[52:52] everybody
[52:52] message believers the goal isn't to try
[52:54] to make everybody perfect the goal is to
[52:56] do
[52:57] the best you can to add to help the
[52:59] gospel he says that's my duty i believe
[53:01] he's speaking to himself
[53:02] as a minister to try to help somebody
[53:04] along the way
[53:05] that's our commission and our calling go
[53:08] into all the world and preach the gospel
[53:10] all of us all of our families all of us
[53:12] as individuals are under that commission
[53:14] it doesn't say go preach the gospel and
[53:16] make them believers it just says
[53:17] these fine signs shall follow them that
[53:19] believe
[53:21] and so i don't have a i don't have a
[53:23] value system
[53:24] or way of judging others if they don't
[53:26] believe i maintain my integrity
[53:28] and i maintain a respectful attitude and
[53:31] i and i love them through their weakness
[53:32] and i stay patient with them as
[53:34] i can that i don't try to belittle and
[53:36] beat them up or threaten or intimidate
[53:38] them
[53:38] i do good unto all men and i do what i
[53:40] can as a benefit to the gospel
[53:42] to help somebody along the way my
[53:45] brother david told a testimony
[53:47] shortly after his conversion i believe
[53:48] he was living i was
[53:50] living i don't think he was living in a
[53:51] pet store but he was working at a pet
[53:53] store
[53:53] his bedroom smelled like a pet store i
[53:55] could say that so he was living
[53:57] in what smelled like a pet store but he
[54:00] told a story how that
[54:01] a buddy of his he used to do uh do stuff
[54:04] with came into the pet store and saul
[54:05] was like david what are you doing here
[54:06] and he's like oh man let's go do some
[54:08] stuff let's do some drugs and david said
[54:09] hey man
[54:10] i'm free of that completely delivered
[54:13] just like that god completely cleaned my
[54:16] life up the guy got all
[54:18] you know just emotionally said david i
[54:20] wish i could be like that david said you
[54:22] can be
[54:23] right now i can pray for you right here
[54:24] in this pet store let's get down on our
[54:26] knees let's pray let's ask god to
[54:27] deliver you
[54:29] and david prayed a sincere prayer for
[54:31] this young man and prayed for that god
[54:33] would deliver him and set him free
[54:34] now i just want to say now not
[54:36] remembering the outcome that i believe
[54:37] that god could set that young man free
[54:39] from a drug addiction
[54:40] because a son of god laid his hands on
[54:42] him and he believed that he could be
[54:44] delivered
[54:45] and i wouldn't have to say now before i
[54:46] do do you have you ever read malachi 4 5
[54:50] oh you haven't well hold on i know this
[54:52] drug addiction's really getting to you
[54:53] right now you're a little twitchy
[54:54] but let's turn to malachi 4 5. i'd say
[54:57] the bible says you can lay hands on the
[54:58] sick and they'll and they'll be
[55:00] healed i my own self was delivered of
[55:02] drugs god did that for me do you believe
[55:04] god can do that for you
[55:05] and meet them on that basis without any
[55:07] strings attached
[55:09] if i don't see at church sunday it's
[55:10] going to come back on you
[55:12] no god if you can deliver somebody from
[55:15] drugs what an
[55:16] asset to that man's family what a
[55:18] greater benefit to our community
[55:20] at large if you had one less drug addict
[55:24] sometimes why marvel why people wonder
[55:26] how can can a lawyer be a christian
[55:28] i say so you tell me do you want all the
[55:30] crooked lawyers representing the guilty
[55:31] criminals and they're like oh well on
[55:33] second thought
[55:34] maybe we should have a few christians
[55:35] representing the criminals
[55:39] brother branham says this faith in the
[55:41] son of god so each day i want to live
[55:43] not for myself
[55:44] if i live for myself i live a selfish
[55:46] life i want to live for others
[55:49] give what strength i have not to myself
[55:51] and to my own pleasure but for the
[55:53] benefit of others
[55:54] that will build the kingdom of god
[55:58] that beautiful as paul said let every
[56:00] one of us please our neighbor not please
[56:02] ourselves brother says i want to live
[56:03] for others
[56:04] give what strength i have not for myself
[56:06] and to my own pleasure not to please
[56:08] myself
[56:08] but for the benefit of others that will
[56:12] build the kingdom of god
[56:15] brother branham writes this in the
[56:16] church age book chapter six
[56:18] dietary church age he says jesus said he
[56:20] that is greatest of all is servant to
[56:22] all
[56:24] a wise man comment on that saying here
[56:27] is what he said
[56:28] and brother man's quoting this wise man
[56:30] only history will prove the truth of
[56:32] that dictum
[56:34] the brother man says that man was right
[56:36] all the truly great men of history have
[56:38] been servants
[56:40] they who demanded to be served they who
[56:42] oppressed
[56:43] they who sought to always be at the head
[56:45] have gone down in shame
[56:47] even the very rich are condemned by god
[56:49] when they have not used their wealth
[56:51] right
[56:52] so it's okay to be wealthy just use it
[56:53] right
[56:56] they who have demanded to be served
[56:58] oppressed others saw always to be at the
[57:00] head have gone down in shame even the
[57:01] rich if they have not used the riches
[57:03] correctly
[57:04] have been condemned by god but look into
[57:06] history and you'll find that the truly
[57:08] great were those
[57:09] who served others history can never
[57:11] acclaim those for whom much was done
[57:13] but it will forever praise those who did
[57:15] much for others
[57:18] now let us apply that to ourselves as
[57:19] brother branham writing it
[57:21] says even as the son of man came to be
[57:23] ministered unto
[57:24] came not to be ministered unto but to
[57:26] minister so
[57:28] we are to follow that example the son of
[57:31] man has not come in this hour
[57:33] the word is not united with flesh in
[57:35] this hour that we can sit back and be
[57:37] served but rather the son of man
[57:39] is expressed again in the bride's body
[57:41] so that we
[57:42] likewise can follow his example and
[57:45] serve
[57:46] the ministry of the son of man is that
[57:48] well son of man you're here to do
[57:49] something for me come on buddy bless me
[57:50] pour out a blessing i need to raise
[57:53] the minister of the son of man isn't
[57:55] here to try to meet all of our needs
[57:57] and to make us feel good and to take us
[57:59] all of our troubles and everything
[58:00] but the ministry of the son of man
[58:02] through you through the bride's body is
[58:03] to serve others
[58:07] follow that example see him as he bows
[58:08] himself over the feet of the apostles
[58:10] and washes their tired and dirty feet
[58:12] he says you don't know what i'm doing
[58:14] now but you will know hereafter
[58:16] what you see me doing you ought to also
[58:18] do he became a servant in order that god
[58:20] could elevate him to the highest heights
[58:22] and one day in the judgment of the
[58:24] saints we're going to hear him say well
[58:25] done good and faithful servant
[58:27] enter thou into the joy of the lord it
[58:29] is hard to always
[58:31] to be always a servant acknowledges
[58:34] it's hard to always be a servant but
[58:37] those who spend and are spent for others
[58:40] will one day be seated with him in his
[58:41] throne it will
[58:43] be worth it all then
[58:47] it'll be worth it all every effort given
[58:49] every prayer
[58:50] prayed every tear shed whatever
[58:52] everything you've given there should
[58:53] never be this point where i was in vain
[58:55] all it was wasted oh it didn't mean
[58:57] nothing
[58:58] listen there'll be no pain wasted
[59:01] your own personal heartaches your own
[59:02] physical pains there'll be no pain
[59:04] wasted god
[59:05] uses every twinge every ache every
[59:08] heartache every brokenness
[59:09] every tear god uses all of it in this
[59:13] life he uses all of it and in the life
[59:14] to come
[59:15] it'll all be worth it then
[59:19] paul had written this in galatians
[59:21] chapter 5 before he even said bear one
[59:23] another's burdens
[59:26] and he's encouraging to go to those who
[59:28] are overtaken in a fault and restore
[59:30] them
[59:30] he writes in galatians chapter 5 verses
[59:32] 13 to 15
[59:34] for brethren you have been called into
[59:35] liberty
[59:37] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[59:40] the flesh
[59:41] but by love serve one another you've
[59:44] been called to liver
[59:45] liberty don't use your liberty to
[59:48] satisfy yourself
[59:50] why wouldn't that doesn't i just put
[59:52] some restraint on even some of the
[59:53] things that we we have
[59:54] liberty to do well i'm free to do this i
[59:56] can do whatever i want but it's not just
[59:58] liberty to make yourself happy but he
[1:00:00] says use this liberty to by love
[1:00:02] serve one another you have time to do
[1:00:05] this you have liberty to do this you
[1:00:06] have freedom to do this all these things
[1:00:07] are lawful
[1:00:08] and you can do them well don't always
[1:00:10] just think about how you can satisfy
[1:00:11] your flesh
[1:00:12] and make yourself feel good but by love
[1:00:14] serve one another
[1:00:16] he says for if this is paul writing for
[1:00:17] all the laws fulfilled in one word even
[1:00:19] this
[1:00:20] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:00:24] this is the very crux of the parable the
[1:00:25] good samaritan it's at the very heart of
[1:00:27] even what
[1:00:28] uh what's being said to uh to the rich
[1:00:31] young ruler love thy neighbor
[1:00:33] as thyself it's the very heart of these
[1:00:36] things it's at the very core
[1:00:38] of how the uh of of how christ is
[1:00:40] wanting us to act and behave as
[1:00:42] christians
[1:00:43] love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:00:47] then notice what verse 15 says but if
[1:00:49] you bite
[1:00:50] and devour one another take heed
[1:00:53] that you be not consumed one of another
[1:00:57] this stands in stark contrast and direct
[1:01:00] uh polar opposite to don't use your
[1:01:04] liberty as an occasion to satisfy your
[1:01:05] flesh but serve one another
[1:01:08] because all of the laws fulfilled in
[1:01:09] this commandment thou shalt love thy
[1:01:11] neighbor as thyself
[1:01:12] see says but if you bite and devour one
[1:01:14] another
[1:01:16] if you're not serving one another you're
[1:01:17] not helping one another take heed that
[1:01:19] you not be consumed
[1:01:20] one of another when you bite and devour
[1:01:24] somebody else you're you're being
[1:01:25] consumed
[1:01:28] but serve love one another i said i want
[1:01:32] to close with this statement
[1:01:33] we read a portion of it in the beginning
[1:01:36] on that day on calvary
[1:01:38] remember i'm talking about the sin
[1:01:39] question is settled you're perfectly
[1:01:41] sinless
[1:01:41] then once we're in that condition he
[1:01:43] gives you his spirit to follow him
[1:01:45] and to do as he did he was a perfect man
[1:01:47] and he was made an example for you
[1:01:49] he says now what must be we do he said
[1:01:52] he lived and had eternal life
[1:01:54] because he did not live for others
[1:01:58] excuse me he did not live for himself he
[1:02:00] lived for others
[1:02:02] he lived and had eternal life because he
[1:02:04] did not live for himself he lived for
[1:02:06] others
[1:02:07] and you receive eternal life by
[1:02:08] receiving that day
[1:02:10] and you don't live for yourself no more
[1:02:12] you live for others
[1:02:14] now i'm picking up where i stopped
[1:02:16] earlier someone said how can you
[1:02:18] stand and let anyone call you such bad
[1:02:20] names
[1:02:21] you don't live for yourself listen to
[1:02:24] what this
[1:02:24] answers to there's answers to so many
[1:02:27] questions sometimes we have in our lives
[1:02:29] and so many difficult things that we go
[1:02:30] through it really speaks to it
[1:02:32] that living for others is the answer
[1:02:36] go and do thou likewise and this is how
[1:02:38] you do and you shall live this is really
[1:02:40] the way to live to have this kind of
[1:02:41] attitude where even the samaritan did
[1:02:43] not look at this one from jerusalem like
[1:02:45] oh
[1:02:45] that's my sworn enemy
[1:02:49] but he he reached out to help him he
[1:02:51] says you don't live for yourself someone
[1:02:52] calls you bad names what's my
[1:02:54] resolution brother brandon what do i do
[1:02:55] if someone's calling me bad names how do
[1:02:57] i overcome it you don't live for
[1:02:58] yourself
[1:03:00] you live for others that you might
[1:03:02] redeem that man
[1:03:05] the very one calling you names not the
[1:03:07] one who's not calling you names
[1:03:09] i've got a list here of everyone who's
[1:03:10] called me names and if you're on it i'm
[1:03:12] not praying for you no
[1:03:14] it that's the one he says you want to
[1:03:16] redeem then he comes to the very
[1:03:19] heart you become sons
[1:03:23] and daughters you're a child of god if
[1:03:25] we could put that before you and the
[1:03:26] trouble of it is that the church has
[1:03:28] forgot their sons
[1:03:30] you are sons you are taking christ's
[1:03:33] place
[1:03:35] you are sons so as we mentioned last
[1:03:37] week
[1:03:38] to to have this attitude where you can
[1:03:40] love others and do good to others and do
[1:03:42] good
[1:03:42] all men is not a position of weakness
[1:03:44] but it's a position of strength
[1:03:46] it's when you feel that your behavior to
[1:03:48] others will give the wrong signal or
[1:03:51] compromise your testimony in that oh he
[1:03:53] must not really be strong because he's
[1:03:55] serving them or he's doing this then he
[1:03:56] must have this
[1:03:57] when you can get it out of your head
[1:03:59] that those that being good to others is
[1:04:01] a sign of weakness when you're afraid
[1:04:03] that reaching out is going to send the
[1:04:04] wrong signal
[1:04:05] and you have confidence i'm a son of god
[1:04:07] and being kind to somebody is not going
[1:04:09] to change that
[1:04:10] then you can overcome the human
[1:04:11] mechanisms that cause us to stiff-arm
[1:04:13] people sometimes
[1:04:15] to separate to distance to cut off to
[1:04:17] not have fellowship
[1:04:18] and he's bringing it to a position of
[1:04:20] strength we're able to fellowship we're
[1:04:22] able to help we're able to aid we're
[1:04:24] able to pray
[1:04:24] we're able to be kind and not say a
[1:04:26] negative thing not because we're weak
[1:04:28] and unsure in our experience but because
[1:04:30] we're strong
[1:04:30] and we're certain of our experience the
[1:04:33] criticisms of others is often born from
[1:04:35] insecurity and complex
[1:04:36] you don't criticize because you got it
[1:04:38] all figured out you criticized because
[1:04:39] you're afraid you don't have it all
[1:04:40] figured out
[1:04:42] and i'm afraid he might know more to me
[1:04:44] so i better i better get get
[1:04:45] i got better get the word out first that
[1:04:48] that guy's an idiot and everything he
[1:04:49] says doesn't make sense
[1:04:51] so as soon as he starts talking
[1:04:54] crazy instead of saying you know what
[1:04:56] what what would you have to say brother
[1:04:59] go ahead share we can we can learn from
[1:05:01] each other right
[1:05:03] none of us has al the complete picture
[1:05:06] brother lonnie jenkins used to teach
[1:05:08] something it was it's very profound
[1:05:10] it's repeated often amongst my circle of
[1:05:12] fellowship with ministers
[1:05:13] is not no he said not one message
[1:05:16] minister has the entire picture
[1:05:18] there's not one message preacher that's
[1:05:20] got it all figured out and can turn over
[1:05:21] every
[1:05:22] angle and show all of them to you we
[1:05:23] need each other as ministers
[1:05:25] as as servants whatever we may be we all
[1:05:28] need each other for the picture to come
[1:05:29] out right
[1:05:30] because not one person has a perfect
[1:05:31] interpretation of it
[1:05:36] he says you're taking christ's place you
[1:05:39] are sons
[1:05:40] so don't live for yourself live for
[1:05:42] others it's a position of strength well
[1:05:44] brother branham i can live for this
[1:05:45] brother because he sure is a nice man
[1:05:47] that's not it are you listening
[1:05:50] everybody awake
[1:05:52] live for that man who hates you
[1:05:56] live for that person who would kill you
[1:05:58] if they could
[1:06:00] that's what they'd done to him they
[1:06:03] killed him and
[1:06:04] he died that he might save them
[1:06:08] is that not the very message on the day
[1:06:09] of pentecost you with wicked hands have
[1:06:11] crucified the lord of glory
[1:06:13] he didn't say everyone here who called
[1:06:15] for the crucifixion of christ
[1:06:16] step out because you're not included he
[1:06:18] included the very ones who crucified the
[1:06:21] lord of glory and he was saying
[1:06:22] you are the ones he died for
[1:06:25] christ who gave of himself was
[1:06:27] self-sacrificial
[1:06:28] in shedding his own blood for those who
[1:06:30] yelled for his blood
[1:06:32] he said should we not do likewise live
[1:06:34] for the man that hates you
[1:06:35] live for that person who would kill you
[1:06:37] that's what they did to him
[1:06:38] they killed him he died that he might
[1:06:40] save them that's
[1:06:42] eternal life when that's in your bosom
[1:06:45] you're facing heaven then
[1:06:48] i i will acknowledge i will admit that
[1:06:51] there's a human side to us that finds it
[1:06:53] very very very difficult
[1:06:55] that our instinct when we have been
[1:06:56] harmed is justice
[1:06:59] that what we crave many times when
[1:07:00] there's hurts or offenses or somebody
[1:07:02] hates you
[1:07:02] or would kill you if they want to you'd
[1:07:04] want to be on the phone hey 9-1-1
[1:07:06] there's a guy who wants to kill me here
[1:07:09] and that's how you would want to address
[1:07:10] this situation but brother i said no you
[1:07:12] live for the man that wants to kill you
[1:07:13] if he could
[1:07:15] you live for the man that would want to
[1:07:16] hate you it's contrary to your human
[1:07:18] nature but let me encourage you
[1:07:19] it's right in harmony with the nature of
[1:07:21] christ which you have received
[1:07:23] none of you are beneath this or none of
[1:07:25] you are above this this is all within
[1:07:27] your capacity
[1:07:28] this is in your wheelhouse you can do
[1:07:30] this you are sons
[1:07:31] you are daughters you are able to love
[1:07:33] those who hate you
[1:07:35] you are able to pray for that man who
[1:07:37] would want to kill you if you could
[1:07:39] you're able to love the man that hates
[1:07:41] you not just the ones that are good and
[1:07:42] nice to you
[1:07:44] can we all admit that's difficult but
[1:07:47] can we also accept
[1:07:48] upon the same basis that through christ
[1:07:50] i can do this
[1:07:53] when that's in your bosom you're facing
[1:07:54] heaven then
[1:07:56] he says you sacrifice your own things
[1:07:59] give them up
[1:08:00] like the sheep gives its wool you look
[1:08:03] on
[1:08:04] towards calvary that's what we're
[1:08:06] looking at church
[1:08:08] we're looking at a sacrifice we're
[1:08:10] looking at our position in christ
[1:08:12] and it gives us a perspective of others
[1:08:14] who are hurt who are downtrodden
[1:08:16] who weak who differ who disagree and we
[1:08:18] can call him brother
[1:08:21] we can call him sister not because they
[1:08:23] agree with everything we say
[1:08:24] but we believe in a god who has the
[1:08:26] capacity to redeem the lowest
[1:08:29] and we believe in election we believe in
[1:08:30] predestination so i don't need to know
[1:08:32] that a brother
[1:08:33] lines up with everything i doctrinally
[1:08:34] believe to be able to call him brother i
[1:08:36] believe
[1:08:37] that he can see truth and i would want
[1:08:39] him to believe that i could see truth
[1:08:41] that if i didn't see it like he did he
[1:08:42] could still call me brother not because
[1:08:44] he's weak but he believes that i can
[1:08:46] also come to truth
[1:08:49] and we're not excluding anybody we're
[1:08:50] not keeping anybody out
[1:08:52] but from a position of strength we are
[1:08:54] his sons we are
[1:08:56] his daughters we are the greatest
[1:08:57] designation that can be placed upon a
[1:08:59] church
[1:08:59] the bride of jesus christ therefore we
[1:09:01] have the capacity
[1:09:03] we have the depth to live for others
[1:09:05] let's stand tonight
[1:09:12] i know the word is challenging
[1:09:17] brother tom had mentioned a song that he
[1:09:19] might have wanted to sing the love of
[1:09:21] god in the key of sea would work maybe
[1:09:23] just to sing it together
[1:09:25] tonight the love of god that's what i
[1:09:27] want should have brought in my heart
[1:09:29] that's what i want to live by i want to
[1:09:32] live by the love that he had for me
[1:09:34] have you been challenged by the word
[1:09:35] tonight let's just bow our heads and
[1:09:37] each one of you just pray individually
[1:09:39] to him
[1:09:40] asking god for his help we're asking the
[1:09:42] question who is my neighbor
[1:09:45] tonight we looked at how the question to
[1:09:48] start the whole conversation was
[1:09:50] what shall i do to inherit eternal life
[1:09:54] and what transpired was a conversation
[1:09:57] that brought us right down to the heart
[1:09:59] of eternal life what is it living
[1:10:02] for others that's my prayer tonight
[1:10:05] maybe you could make it yours lord i
[1:10:06] want to live for others
[1:10:09] i want the love of god to be shed abroad
[1:10:10] in my heart for others
[1:10:12] let us pray our gracious heavenly father
[1:10:14] lord as we've edged on in the evening
[1:10:16] it's getting late
[1:10:18] lord even some tonight we're not able to
[1:10:19] make it because they work late
[1:10:21] so father those those who have an early
[1:10:23] morning and we have demands upon our
[1:10:25] time and
[1:10:26] even things being beginning to creep
[1:10:28] into our thought process related to the
[1:10:30] demands of life
[1:10:31] lord we pause even right now we say lord
[1:10:33] we love you
[1:10:35] we thank you for your goodness towards
[1:10:36] us father
[1:10:38] we're so appreciative of the clarity of
[1:10:40] the bible and
[1:10:41] the strength of this message joined
[1:10:42] together with it that speaks to us
[1:10:45] in areas that might seem to be
[1:10:46] ecumenical in ways that might seem to be
[1:10:48] denominational in ways that might not
[1:10:50] even seem to be
[1:10:51] in line with what we think the message
[1:10:53] of the hour really promotes but lord we
[1:10:55] can
[1:10:55] from a position of strength do good to
[1:10:58] all men
[1:11:00] we can lord from position of strength
[1:11:02] love our neighbor
[1:11:03] as ourselves lord this isn't weakness
[1:11:07] it's not a sign that we haven't
[1:11:08] met you it's not a sign that we don't
[1:11:10] have truth but lord because we have
[1:11:11] truth we can do this
[1:11:14] and father i desire that you could break
[1:11:15] any chains that bind us tear down any
[1:11:17] walls that separate us
[1:11:20] lord i ask right now that you can loose
[1:11:22] this nature of christ that's within us
[1:11:24] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:26] to be able to reach beyond fear reach
[1:11:28] beyond complex reeks beyond anxiety
[1:11:30] reach beyond
[1:11:31] history and to love one another
[1:11:35] lord we know how difficult it is when we
[1:11:38] have been hurt when we've been aggrieved
[1:11:39] when we've been wounded when we
[1:11:41] scarred we've been mistreated we know
[1:11:43] how hard it is to reach out to others
[1:11:45] even if they're not the one
[1:11:49] lord we know even how much more
[1:11:51] difficult it is when there's something
[1:11:52] that
[1:11:53] resembles that looks like that very hard
[1:11:56] to reach out
[1:11:59] but lord if we could for a moment think
[1:12:04] maybe that samaritan was called some
[1:12:06] choice words by a jew
[1:12:10] maybe that samaritan was called a dog
[1:12:14] maybe that samaritan was reminded on a
[1:12:16] daily basis that he has no heir
[1:12:19] no inheritance in god
[1:12:22] but when he saw a man broken and wounded
[1:12:25] and hurt him
[1:12:26] who may have represented all the scars
[1:12:29] and wounds that he endured he was
[1:12:30] bullied with
[1:12:32] something in him reached out
[1:12:35] and though it's a parable lord we learn
[1:12:38] a great lesson
[1:12:39] that we ourselves have no excuse
[1:12:43] help us to be bearers of your nature
[1:12:45] lord help us to live the life that's
[1:12:48] befitting of the name christian
[1:12:51] and i pray lord tonight that if there be
[1:12:53] any who do not have eternal life may
[1:12:54] they seek it with all their heart
[1:12:57] through repentance and water baptism
[1:13:00] through the seal of god
[1:13:02] we lord who have received such a
[1:13:03] precious promise in this hour
[1:13:06] may this love be loosed lord may it no
[1:13:08] longer be restrained
[1:13:10] but father may you moderate it may you
[1:13:11] govern it we don't want to take our
[1:13:13] human understanding and grab a hold of
[1:13:15] love lord we'll make a mess of it again
[1:13:17] the lord may your love live out freely
[1:13:19] not with our own
[1:13:20] ambition not with our own ideals not
[1:13:22] with our own understanding but lord let
[1:13:23] it live out freely
[1:13:25] we can express you in your nature commit
[1:13:28] the people to you tonight
[1:13:29] desiring that you would touch them lord
[1:13:31] in the name of lord jesus christ we pray
[1:13:34] amen amen let's just worship the lord
[1:13:37] for a few moments before you're
[1:13:38] dismissed
