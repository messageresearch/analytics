[0:00] so this is John 4 uh: 4- 26 and he must
[0:05] needs go through Samaria then cometh he
[0:08] to a city of Samaria which is called
[0:11] sikar near the parcel of ground that
[0:13] Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's
[0:16] Well was there so it's giv you kind of
[0:17] the context of the land and and the and
[0:20] the location some which are significant
[0:22] to the Jews but you'll find that these
[0:24] things are brought up later so the one
[0:26] writing this uh is giving us tremendous
[0:28] context for what happens
[0:30] and it says and Jesus therefore being
[0:33] wearied with his journey sat thus at on
[0:37] the well and it was about the sixth hour
[0:40] there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
[0:42] water Jesus saith unto her give me to
[0:44] drink for his disciples were gone away
[0:47] into the city to buy meat then saith the
[0:49] woman of Samaria unto him how is it that
[0:52] thou being a Jew asketh drink of me
[0:55] which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews
[0:58] have no dealings with the Samaritan
[1:00] Jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[1:02] knewest the gift of God and who it was
[1:03] that saith to thee give me to drink thou
[1:06] wouldest have asked of him and he would
[1:08] have given thee Living Water the woman
[1:11] saith unto him sir thou Hast nothing to
[1:14] draw with and the well is deep from
[1:16] whence then hast thou that Living Water
[1:18] art thou greater than our father Jacob
[1:21] which gave us the well and drank thereof
[1:23] himself and his children and his cattle
[1:26] Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:28] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:30] thirst again but whosoever drinketh of
[1:32] the water that I shall give him shall
[1:34] never thirst but the water that I shall
[1:36] give him shall be in him a well of water
[1:39] springing up into everlasting life the
[1:42] woman saith unto him sir give me this
[1:44] water that I thirst not neither come
[1:46] hither to draw Jesus saith unto her go
[1:49] call thy husband and come hither the
[1:52] woman answered and said I have no
[1:54] husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast
[1:57] said well thou Hast well said I have no
[1:59] husband for thou Hast five husbands and
[2:02] he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband
[2:04] in that sest thou truly the woman saith
[2:07] un him sir I perceive that thou art a
[2:09] prophet our fathers worshiped in this
[2:12] mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is
[2:14] the place where men ought to worship
[2:17] Jesus saith unto Heroman believe me the
[2:19] hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[2:21] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[2:23] worship the father you worship you know
[2:26] not what we know what we worship for
[2:28] salvation is of the Jew
[2:30] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[2:33] true worshipper shall worship the father
[2:35] in spirit and in truth for the father
[2:38] seeketh such to worship him God is a
[2:41] spirit and they that worship Him must
[2:42] worship Him in spirit and in truth the
[2:46] woman saith unto him I know that the
[2:48] that Messiah cometh which is called
[2:50] Christ when he has come he will tell us
[2:53] all things Jesus saith unto her I that
[2:56] speak unto thee am he amen you may may
[2:59] be
[3:01] seated we're continuing on the subject
[3:03] that we've been ministering on uh on
[3:05] Wednesday nights on who is my neighbor
[3:09] and we're taking this subject from Luke
[3:12] chapter 10 where Jesus is asked of the
[3:14] lawyer what can I do to have eternal
[3:16] life and then in answering the question
[3:19] Jesus asked him a question what does the
[3:21] law say and then he says to love the
[3:23] Lord thy God and then to love thy
[3:25] neighbor as thyself and then Jesus said
[3:28] thou has said well
[3:30] do this and you shall live and then the
[3:32] lawyer trying to wanting to justify
[3:34] himself says well then who is my
[3:36] neighbor and then Jesus gives the
[3:38] parable that we're familiar with called
[3:40] the parable of the Good
[3:42] Samaritan and he uses a man who's been
[3:45] Fallen upon by thieves he's left half
[3:47] dead uh he's they have been robbed of
[3:49] his possessions then a priest comes by
[3:52] goes to the other side then a levite
[3:54] comes by kind of looks at him goes to
[3:55] the other side and then a Samaritan
[3:57] happens by and it's the Samaritan that
[3:59] reach es out and uh ministers to him and
[4:03] then in Luke 10:36 Jesus says which now
[4:06] of these three and I may seem like I'm
[4:09] just jumping right into this and I am he
[4:11] says which of these three thinkest thou
[4:14] was neighbor unto him that fell among
[4:16] the thieves and so he's asking the
[4:19] question a little bit differently and I
[4:21] want to emphasize that here in a moment
[4:23] and then the lawyer answers and he says
[4:25] he that showed Mercy on him and it's
[4:28] remarkable that Jesus refers to a priest
[4:30] he refers to a levite and then he uses
[4:33] the designation Samaritan now if Jesus
[4:36] had phrased this in such a way to it was
[4:38] the priest or the levite that had done
[4:40] well then it's no doubt that this lawyer
[4:43] would have said well the priest or he
[4:44] would have said the levite but Jesus
[4:47] using the Samaritan as an example it
[4:49] just exposes further the the Prejudice
[4:52] that was in the lawyer's heart of the
[4:54] bigotry that was there you want to call
[4:55] it racism bias whatever you want to call
[4:57] it but it exposed it still yet in his
[5:00] heart because instead of saying the
[5:01] Samaritan he says he that showed Mercy
[5:04] on him almost not even willing himself
[5:06] to phrase form the word Samaritan then
[5:10] said Jesus unto him go and do thou
[5:13] likewise so he's Jesus had made his
[5:15] point the lawyer is brought to that
[5:17] place where he acknowledges that the
[5:18] Samaritan is the one who showed uh who
[5:21] was uh neighbor to him that fell among
[5:23] Thieves and Jesus affirms it go and do
[5:25] thou likewise I what I want to begin to
[5:28] this evening with is pointing out that
[5:30] Jesus rephrases the question that the
[5:33] lawyer asked in verse 29 the lawyer
[5:35] asked and who is my neighbor so that's
[5:38] it's an asking uh who who Who's My
[5:40] Neighbor so you might expect perhaps an
[5:43] answer of a a person or a nomination of
[5:46] some sort and so the lawyer wants to
[5:48] know who do I owe the duty of loving as
[5:52] myself not necessarily what the duty
[5:55] entailed he he might have known enough
[5:57] to know that that's going to get me in
[5:58] trouble but maybe if I I could just
[6:00] split hairs at who's my neighbor then I
[6:02] can be a Justified because he's seeking
[6:04] to justify himself and that's why he
[6:06] makes the statement uh well who is my
[6:09] neighbor and so he wants to know who do
[6:11] I have to love as myself not what does
[6:15] it mean to love and so Jesus instead of
[6:17] just simply saying well everyone's your
[6:19] neighbor regardless of religion
[6:21] regardless of race regardless of
[6:22] background regardless of past uh uh
[6:25] everyone's your neighbor Jesus uses this
[6:27] Parable to amplify the truth and we've
[6:31] already seen how the law is what told
[6:33] made it incumbent upon the the Jews uh
[6:37] to behave a certain way towards the
[6:38] stranger and towards the Heathen towards
[6:40] the Gentile that the law didn't make a
[6:42] distinction and when if your neighbor's
[6:44] livestock got loose you should go and
[6:46] take it whether they be a stranger
[6:48] whether they be the Jew and you should
[6:49] return it unto them so they were already
[6:51] Bound by the law and we know Jesus comes
[6:54] and he gives the parable not just to
[6:56] quickly answer the question but to
[6:58] amplify the real meaning meaning and
[7:00] truth behind the law in Isaiah 42:
[7:05] 21 it says the Lord is well pleased for
[7:07] his righteousness sake he will magnify
[7:10] the law and make it honorable this is a
[7:13] prophecy of Christ that he will he will
[7:16] magnify the law and make it honorable he
[7:18] will he will bring out the real life of
[7:21] it he'll bring out the truth of it he
[7:22] will he will really make it effective
[7:24] and then also make it honorable because
[7:27] it says in Psalms 11912 6 it is time for
[7:31] thee Lord to work for they have made
[7:33] void thy law so if you see in the Old
[7:36] Testament a prophecy of Christ that
[7:38] he'll magnify the law he'll make it
[7:40] honorable and now in Psalms 119 which is
[7:42] a Psalm which just continues to lift up
[7:44] the word and the law of the Lord he says
[7:46] it's time for you to work Lord because
[7:49] they have made the law void in other
[7:51] words they've made it without real
[7:53] effect they've taken the the true intent
[7:56] of it or the it doesn't it doesn't serve
[7:58] the purpose or meet the purpose that it
[8:00] originally was intended though it may
[8:01] seem like they're fulfilling the law
[8:03] they've stripped it of the life of it
[8:05] and the purpose of it so the law was
[8:07] made void they had made it dishonorable
[8:09] they had had diminished it and so Jesus
[8:12] comes and when he gives this Parable
[8:14] he's in the office of one that magnifies
[8:16] the law in Mark 7:
[8:20] 13 Jesus says this about the the Jews
[8:23] about the the elders and the Pharisees
[8:25] and he says you're making he says making
[8:27] the word of God of none effect you're
[8:29] nullifying the authority of the word
[8:32] through your tradition so by even by
[8:35] making the word a tradition you nullify
[8:37] the effect of it there there's nothing
[8:39] that we do as Christians that we ought
[8:41] to do traditionally and that goes for
[8:43] all of our
[8:45] Traditions feet washing and communion
[8:47] should not be done traditionally though
[8:49] we could say it's a tradition uh water
[8:51] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is
[8:52] not a tradition a coming to church is
[8:55] not a tradition though it may seem we do
[8:57] these things traditionally if you just
[8:59] do do it as tradition and as he says
[9:01] here you've made the word of God
[9:02] nullified without authority of no effect
[9:04] through your tradition which you have
[9:06] delivered or handed down if we're merely
[9:08] just handing down traditions and that's
[9:10] what keeps the church going then really
[9:12] the words not have an effect amen it's
[9:14] more a cultural code it's more
[9:16] discipline it's more getting everybody
[9:18] to agree and Ascent to a particular way
[9:20] that we ought to conduct ourselves and
[9:21] live and so he's saying you've made the
[9:23] word of God taking the authority out of
[9:25] it just by making things tradition or by
[9:28] their Traditions which deated from the
[9:30] word and then they're passed down he
[9:31] says and many such like things do ye so
[9:35] this is Jesus identifying that the the
[9:37] law had lost its full force and effect
[9:40] in Matthew 5:1 17 he says think not that
[9:43] I'm come to destroy the law or the
[9:45] prophets I am come not I am not come to
[9:49] destroy but to
[9:52] fulfill so he wasn't doing away with the
[9:55] law he's fulfilling the law he's not
[9:58] watering down the law even even more and
[9:59] saying this isn't important or that
[10:01] isn't important but he's come he came to
[10:03] accomplish the real purpose of the law
[10:06] he wanted to show you what it was
[10:07] actually he's going to bring the law to
[10:09] the place where it accomplishes even
[10:10] what it was intended or better yet what
[10:12] it was foreshadowing because the law
[10:15] without Christ could not make you
[10:16] perfect the blood of bulls the blood of
[10:18] goats and all those ceremonial
[10:19] sacrifices pointed to one that would
[10:22] come and all the law pointed to an
[10:24] inward Holiness that Christ would
[10:25] accomplish for us so it stood for
[10:27] something he said I'm not come to do do
[10:29] away with it I'm coming to magnify it to
[10:31] complete it and to fulfill it and so by
[10:35] way of example Jesus in Matthew Chapter
[10:37] 5 later on in that very same chapter he
[10:40] says I don't come to uh do away with it
[10:42] I come to fulfill it he uses the example
[10:44] he says that if you if you're angry with
[10:46] your brother without cause uh that's
[10:48] that's that's murder and so he begins to
[10:50] amplify that it's more there's more to
[10:53] what the law meant when these things
[10:54] were given and he uses this in verses 27
[10:58] and 28 he says you have heard that it
[11:00] was said by them of old time Thou shalt
[11:03] not commit adultery but I say unto you
[11:06] now he not doing away with the law but
[11:09] magnifying it he's amplifying the law he
[11:12] says but I say to you that whosoever
[11:14] lookth on a woman to lust after her hath
[11:16] committed adultery with her already in
[11:19] his heart now when you ponder it from
[11:21] this perspective this using this
[11:23] particular scripture that Jesus is not
[11:25] doing away with the law but he's there's
[11:27] something that's being magnified in it
[11:28] or being Amplified in it was the
[11:31] Prohibition against adultery merely
[11:33] there to to bind to keep one from
[11:36] committing the act or did it actually
[11:39] speak to the fact that you ought to be
[11:41] pure in your thoughts amen that your
[11:43] thought life should be pure and that
[11:44] this is not something you should desire
[11:46] something uh not that you would
[11:48] something you wouldn't even flirt with
[11:51] it's something you wouldn't even
[11:52] entertain it's like you wouldn't say
[11:53] well it's just once I get to this place
[11:56] then I'm guilty no it stood for
[11:58] something greater
[12:00] like this is something that you may say
[12:01] well the act itself is prohibited but
[12:03] anything that would lead to it anything
[12:06] that would be akin to it anything that
[12:07] would uh would be a sister to it you
[12:10] want to avoid that you want to leave it
[12:11] alone and you'll find that throughout
[12:13] history especially within the Christian
[12:15] church where people have flirted with
[12:17] that and thought that they could dilly
[12:19] dally in all different areas and and
[12:21] venture out into certain things and and
[12:23] make light of the Gospel in certain
[12:24] areas they eventually succumb to these
[12:26] very things because they miss the real
[12:28] thrust and purpose of the rule of the
[12:30] law to begin with amen and so when he
[12:33] says that if a man looks upon a woman
[12:35] he's really getting down to the real
[12:37] what the law signified this is where it
[12:40] begins is in the heart and so he says
[12:42] I'm telling you that if a man looks upon
[12:44] a woman and lust after her he's already
[12:46] committed the act in his heart so when
[12:49] Jesus begins to give the parable instead
[12:52] of just saying well everyone's your
[12:53] neighbor he wanted he used the parable
[12:56] and in using the parable he really
[12:58] Amplified I or magnifies the law and and
[13:01] identifies how the Jews had watered down
[13:05] the word of God to where it had no
[13:06] effect this had become maybe a point of
[13:09] a point of national pride and religious
[13:11] zealousness where we're Jews and we're
[13:13] pure and we go all the way back to
[13:15] Abraham and they were using that as a
[13:17] means to exclude ones from fellowship
[13:19] exclude ones um from charity and exclude
[13:22] ones from being treated just decently
[13:25] and so the spirit or the purpose of the
[13:26] law was missed uh through their own
[13:28] human ISM as Jesus said the
[13:30] traditionalism and even through legalism
[13:32] binding people to do it without an
[13:35] understanding and without without Grace
[13:38] and we could we could challenge
[13:39] ourselves with those very things uh
[13:41] without going further we could just stay
[13:44] right within that view and challenge
[13:46] ourselves do we impose things on others
[13:48] out of legalism not recognizing that
[13:51] it's the grace of God that leads one to
[13:53] repentance that's the grace of God in
[13:54] our lives that leads us Beyond
[13:56] repentance to the baptism of the Holy
[13:57] Ghost it's the grace of God in us to
[13:59] both will and to do that it's God that's
[14:02] doing these things and then we have
[14:04] conviction the holy spirit's bringing
[14:06] things to pass in our lives and the the
[14:07] word is being brought to pass and then
[14:09] we can be very quick to forget the grace
[14:11] that's in our lives and then oppose by
[14:13] law some the same thing on somebody else
[14:16] so it really challenges us to not make
[14:18] the word of n effect if God has done a
[14:21] work of Grace in your life and it's the
[14:23] evidence of the Holy Ghost working
[14:24] through you and you've uh you've
[14:26] obtained victories and seen yourself
[14:28] delivered and the family is coming in
[14:29] order and God's doing something
[14:31] tremendous in your life whatever you do
[14:33] don't turn around and take that work of
[14:35] God that he's done by grace and you and
[14:37] then begin to judge others
[14:39] legalistically by it if there's a
[14:41] standard being raised in your home if
[14:42] there's a if there's a standard being
[14:44] lifted up in your life if there's
[14:45] victories then don't begin to look at
[14:47] others who haven't experienced that and
[14:48] look down on them judge them say oh well
[14:51] they just haven't walked as high as I've
[14:53] walked be very very careful cuz you
[14:54] could even lose the victory amen because
[14:57] you because you've taken the word of God
[14:59] into an area where now you're expecting
[15:01] them to live it either by your example
[15:04] or by law what you weren't able to live
[15:07] without God's grace and there's other
[15:09] ways that whether it be humanism or just
[15:11] making things traditional it can it can
[15:13] lose the real meaning of it and I'm so
[15:15] we could be challenged just in that part
[15:17] alone but I want to go further in this
[15:20] because the question that Jesus asked is
[15:23] who do you think was neighbor unto him
[15:25] that fell among Thieves in other words
[15:27] who fulfilled the duty one owes to a
[15:30] neighbor and it it's it continues to
[15:33] strike me how the question's different
[15:35] the lawyer says who is my neighbor Jesus
[15:38] asked which of the three was neighbor
[15:41] to the one who fell among
[15:43] Thieves and it's almost as if saying who
[15:46] was the the victim's neighbor but you
[15:48] realize it goes both ways I know that we
[15:51] we have uh times in our lives where
[15:53] someone says well you're my best friend
[15:55] you go well you're but you're not my
[15:56] best friend right we all laugh because
[15:59] that was a long time ago I hope I hope
[16:02] but we've had those scenarios well I'm
[16:04] their friend but they're not really my
[16:06] friend but if it's neighbor it works
[16:09] both ways I can't be your neighbor but
[16:12] you're not my neighbor right in other
[16:14] words you owe a duty to me but I don't
[16:15] owe a duty to you so really Jesus is
[16:17] asking which one was neighbor to him
[16:19] that fell among Thieves in other words
[16:21] who showed the kindness that would be
[16:23] appropriate for a neighbor who expressed
[16:25] the proper actions of a neighbor who
[16:28] fulfilled the duty if a neighbor had a
[16:30] duty which one if there was something
[16:32] that a neighbor would do to somebody of
[16:34] these three men which did the neighborly
[16:37] thing and so the parable not only
[16:39] identifies because he gives so much
[16:41] detail to it to it it not only
[16:43] identifies who the neighbor
[16:45] was but how he loved his neighbor as
[16:49] himself so Jesus did just didn't say uh
[16:52] uh everyone and he didn't just give a
[16:54] parable that would cause him to quickly
[16:56] choose among three different people but
[16:57] he actually identified ifed who the
[16:59] neighbor was and how his actions
[17:02] fulfilled loving his neighbor as himself
[17:06] and in doing this we've identified this
[17:07] or we've said this actually a number of
[17:09] times through the first several parts in
[17:11] this he's stripping away all the
[17:13] pretense of this lawyer he's taken all
[17:15] his hypocrisy and he's challenging this
[17:18] lawyer with the example of the Samaritan
[17:20] the lawyer would identify with the
[17:21] priest identify with the levite here's a
[17:23] Jew and he's a lawyer he's one that
[17:25] identifies with the law would know the
[17:27] law very very well and Jesus uses the
[17:29] parable and using the priest as an
[17:31] example it strips a little of that
[17:33] pretense away from this lawyer using the
[17:35] levite as an example it strips it down
[17:37] even further and really attacks his
[17:40] hypocrisy and challenges him now not
[17:42] with a priest who's doing better a Jew
[17:44] who's doing better or someone of his own
[17:46] Kindred in nation who's who is U
[17:49] bringing the law to life and doing what
[17:51] he ought to do but rather a Samaritan to
[17:53] do it and so he's really challenged this
[17:57] lawyer and so if you want to look look
[17:58] at verse 33 Luke
[18:01] 10:33 I'm just going to go through these
[18:05] different parts the Samaritan as he
[18:06] journeyed came where he was and when he
[18:09] saw him and it may touch a little bit on
[18:11] the compass compassion but I just want
[18:13] to walk through this Peace by
[18:15] peace and it says in Luke chap 10:33
[18:19] I'll just read it and then come back but
[18:20] a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came
[18:23] where he was and when he saw him he had
[18:26] compassion on him this is the one that
[18:29] the lawyer said had mercy on him and so
[18:32] Jesus says but a certain Samaritan
[18:34] remember Jesus is very purposeful in the
[18:36] language that he uses very deliberate in
[18:39] the in the phrasing and the situation
[18:42] and a
[18:43] Samaritan I as I Ponder this and look at
[18:46] it historically look at it within the
[18:47] text Jesus is using the Samaritan as a
[18:50] way to overcome any
[18:53] objection in other words this the Jew
[18:56] could not sense obligation to a neighbor
[18:58] because of his
[18:59] nationality he couldn't be feel feel he
[19:02] has a duty to his neighbor because of
[19:04] his
[19:05] religion and he couldn't exempt himself
[19:07] from a duty because of hatred or
[19:09] bitterness or animosity or any kind of
[19:11] prejudice and or or any kind of
[19:13] experience wherein maybe I've had a bad
[19:15] experience with those people and I've
[19:17] had a bad experience with church and
[19:18] I've had a bad experience with this and
[19:20] that and uh and and I had that happened
[19:22] to me one time I was sitting down it's
[19:24] actually a pretty funny story but I'd
[19:26] preached some meeting somewhere and it
[19:28] was June but it felt like the dead of
[19:30] February to me and so after the meetings
[19:32] were over they had a picnic and I had a
[19:34] touque on and I was all bundled up
[19:35] sitting by a little campfire they were
[19:37] doing this was in Canada if he had
[19:39] figured that out already and the coldest
[19:42] uh coldest winter I ever had was a a
[19:44] summer in Grand Prairie amen and so it
[19:48] uh and I was just kind of sitting there
[19:49] slouched in a lawn chair and had a
[19:51] touque on and somebody had invited a
[19:53] coworker uh to church or to church to
[19:56] the meetings well they never showed up
[19:57] for the meetings but they showed up for
[19:58] the picnic and they show up at the
[20:01] picnic and they're kind of they're just
[20:02] there and they're they're you know this
[20:03] worldly guy looking around like man look
[20:05] at all these Christians like who man
[20:08] who's safe here and he sees this Thug
[20:10] sitting there by the campfire you know
[20:12] with the touque on all slouched in the
[20:14] chair he's like oh this guy he's safe so
[20:17] he sits next to me and he sits next to
[20:18] me he's kind of like man these guys man
[20:21] he's like like so you know he's kind of
[20:23] I said so do you go to church oh Church
[20:25] man come on he's like there's too much
[20:27] hypocrisy in church
[20:29] and I thought oh man this is going to be
[20:32] fun and uh I I let him have it I really
[20:37] really did but what I identified was how
[20:40] could I said what what does that have to
[20:41] do with you what does that make you if
[20:43] the Hypocrites keep you out of
[20:47] church wait a minute can I can I choose
[20:49] my seat again you know what what's going
[20:51] on here well I I'm happy to report I
[20:53] don't think the person's missed a
[20:55] service since then went to the next
[20:57] church service got bapt AP ized married
[20:59] the piano player and now he's the pastor
[21:00] of the
[21:02] church this happened over several years
[21:04] maybe like 15 years or something like
[21:05] that or more but that that was just the
[21:07] grace of God but sometimes you've got to
[21:09] overcome
[21:11] hypocrisy and realize look just because
[21:13] somebody has done something just because
[21:15] there's been an offense just because
[21:16] people have acted a certain way doesn't
[21:17] nullify truth amen if you've been abused
[21:21] abused by Ministry doesn't mean
[21:22] Ministries all wrong if you've had bad
[21:25] Church experiences doesn't mean you you
[21:27] can stay at home and still be a
[21:29] Christian and so Jesus is using this
[21:32] example and uses it in such a way to any
[21:35] objection that this lawyer would have
[21:37] Jesus one by one has just nailed him
[21:40] just like he did with the the Rich Young
[21:41] Ruler he found the one thing in his
[21:44] heart Lord I've I've I've committed all
[21:47] I've kept all these things from my youth
[21:49] I've done everything you've asked me to
[21:50] do from my youth and he says and here I
[21:53] am uh having committed done all these
[21:55] things since my youth and Jesus says all
[21:57] right okay now I know where you're at
[22:00] and he found the one thing he couldn't
[22:02] let go of he found the one thing that
[22:03] would become problematic to him so here
[22:05] Jesus is doing the same thing when he
[22:07] brings up the example of the
[22:10] Samaritan this is what we've mentioned
[22:12] this several times that there's enity
[22:13] that existed between the Jews and the
[22:15] Samaritans right it's we shouldn't just
[22:18] think of like well the Pharisees or
[22:19] excuse me the Philistines or the
[22:21] Egyptians this is a very unique rivalry
[22:24] between the Samaritans and the Jews and
[22:27] their National Pride on the Jews part
[22:29] and even national pride on the
[22:30] Samaritan's part and religious Prejudice
[22:33] on both parts created this hostility
[22:35] between the two of them and they weren't
[22:38] and we'll just maybe amplify this more
[22:40] they weren't hostile to each other
[22:42] because of they were so different they
[22:45] were hostile to each other because they
[22:46] had many
[22:48] similarities and that's what really
[22:49] created the conflict is they had so many
[22:51] things in common but yet the differences
[22:53] is what made them hate each other and
[22:55] very hostile to each other but it was
[22:57] aggravated by the fact that seem to be
[22:58] so many different similarities to him as
[23:01] we read in John
[23:03] 4:9 as Jesus asked for a drink and
[23:07] notice he says give me to drink and then
[23:09] the woman says notice just how
[23:10] immediately she says then sayith the
[23:12] woman of Samar Samaria so here's a
[23:14] Samaritan woman how is it that thou
[23:17] being a Jew asketh drink of me which a
[23:20] is a woman which am a woman of Samaria
[23:23] this was not common there would have not
[23:25] been this kind of interaction for a Jew
[23:27] to ask Samaritan get me a drink now you
[23:31] could say that it's Prejudice you could
[23:33] say it's racism you could say it's
[23:35] because uh there's a lot of different
[23:36] ways or misogyny but really at the end
[23:38] of the day you look at it and say a Jew
[23:40] would have known better probably than to
[23:41] ask a Samaritan woman for a drink get it
[23:44] yourself it just would have been this
[23:46] there would have been no respect there
[23:47] would have been no Accord and she's
[23:49] immediately shocked by the boldness of
[23:51] this man to say give me a drink because
[23:53] she says the Jews have no dealings with
[23:55] the Samaritans in other words we're off
[23:57] limits
[23:59] you don't talk to us and in the history
[24:01] of it though the Samaritans as we'll see
[24:03] in a moment were antagonistic towards
[24:04] the Jews the Jews were much more
[24:06] antagonistic against the Samaritans they
[24:09] hated them they belittled them and she's
[24:11] like hey the Jews don't have dealings
[24:13] with Samaritans they wouldn't ask a
[24:14] Samaritan for help they wouldn't ask a
[24:16] Samaritan to do something for him this
[24:17] is not something that's normal and
[24:20] actually the term Samaritan would have
[24:21] been a byword for a Jew in other words
[24:24] it would have been an
[24:25] insult and they Ed the phrase Samaritan
[24:27] for someone who was a her IC or someone
[24:29] who is evil you say well you're just a
[24:31] Samaritan in the same way that we might
[24:33] use an insult or a bad word or slang
[24:35] today to like criticize somebody or cut
[24:38] somebody down Samaritan was a a cut down
[24:40] in those days you called somebody a cut
[24:43] down those were fighting Samaritan those
[24:45] were fighting words and maybe that was
[24:47] the real dig at a Jew say well you're
[24:49] just acting like a Samaritan wait a
[24:50] minute what do you mean I'm acting like
[24:52] a Samaritan them's fighting words and so
[24:55] she this this word Samaritan she
[24:57] identified her S as a Samaritan but to a
[24:59] Jew a Samaritan was were were low people
[25:02] and the in 2 Kings 17: 24 kind of gives
[25:08] you the history of where these
[25:09] Samaritans began and the king of Assyria
[25:11] brought men from Babylon and from CA and
[25:14] from Ava and from hameth and some
[25:17] saffrin and placed them in the cities of
[25:19] Samaria instead of the children of
[25:22] Israel so he took all these people from
[25:24] these different places Babylon and aan
[25:26] these different places and put them in
[25:28] Samaria instead of placing Jews there
[25:30] and placing Israel there in Samaria he
[25:32] brought all these other people into this
[25:34] place and they possessed Samaria and
[25:36] dwelt in the cities thereof so these
[25:38] people come je Gentiles and these other
[25:41] races of people not Jews not of Israel
[25:44] they come to this place called Samaria
[25:46] and they become a very unique group of
[25:48] people because here they are in this
[25:50] this land called Samaria and they're
[25:52] inhabiting it and then Through Time one
[25:55] of samalot sons I believe he was a
[25:56] priest he gets exiled from Israel uh
[25:59] because of the marriage and and Josephus
[26:01] goes through this in great detail and he
[26:03] goes to Samaria and there's several
[26:05] hundred Jews because of their wickedness
[26:06] that are kind of exiled from Judea and
[26:09] they come to this place of Samaria and
[26:11] so they begin to mix with the
[26:12] inhabitants of Samaria so Samaritans
[26:15] through hundreds of years became became
[26:17] a mixed race they weren't entirely uh
[26:20] Gentile they weren't entirely Jew and as
[26:22] being a mixed race and even if you
[26:24] continue to read here in 2 Kings 17
[26:26] you'll find that they tried to bring
[26:28] them to Godly worship and they accepted
[26:30] the Lord in 2 Kings 17 they believed in
[26:34] the Lord but they retained their Idols
[26:36] so you'll find there's always this
[26:37] interesting hybrid with the Samaritans
[26:40] that they there's a part of them that is
[26:42] not Jew but there's a part of them that
[26:43] is there's a part of them that honors
[26:45] the Lord but a part of them that
[26:46] wouldn't and so through the passage of
[26:48] time eventually the Samaritans come to a
[26:50] place where they adopt the law of
[26:53] Moses so now they're kind of a hybrid
[26:55] they're Gentile and Jew they're kind of
[26:57] a mixed race
[26:58] uh though they're still called strangers
[27:00] even in the New Testament you'll find
[27:02] where Jesus referring to a Samaritan
[27:04] says only one came back except this or
[27:07] none of them came back except the
[27:08] stranger referring to the Samaritan
[27:10] they'll find that they said well have
[27:11] not we said that you're a stranger to to
[27:13] uh a Samaritan to Jesus and doest evil
[27:17] so there there is there is they still
[27:19] viewed them as strangers and evildoers
[27:21] but the Samaritans now had come to a
[27:23] place where they adopted the law of
[27:25] Moses so they kept the law
[27:28] and they in in keeping the law they
[27:30] still retained this animosity towards
[27:32] the Jews and they're said to have done
[27:34] everything in their power to annoy the
[27:36] Jews so we could say that the the
[27:39] Samaritans weren't entirely innocent
[27:41] they both antagonized each other but it
[27:43] said that the Samaritans would often do
[27:45] everything they could to annoy the Jews
[27:49] so then John 4:12 as we've been read as
[27:52] we read through this and Jesus is
[27:55] continuing to talk to the Samaritan
[27:59] she her her comment now if you read it
[28:01] if there's kind of this rivalry between
[28:03] the
[28:04] two you wonder if the woman at the well
[28:07] is not being a little bit
[28:09] snarky uh you've got nothing to draw
[28:11] with and the well is deep you know where
[28:13] are you going to get this living water
[28:15] from but and it maybe it's easy to
[28:18] attach that to it but there is some kind
[28:19] of back and forth here but then she says
[28:22] this art thou
[28:24] greater than our father Jacob
[28:29] she's a
[28:30] Samaritan but now when she claims Jacob
[28:33] as her father she's she may on one hand
[28:36] be including Jesus a Jew in
[28:39] that but she's at least saying it's her
[28:42] father we as Samaritans because there's
[28:44] already been a division between Jews and
[28:46] Samaritans and even the writer says he's
[28:48] he's coming to the city of samarra which
[28:50] is close to The Well of Jacob that he
[28:52] gave his son Joseph and so he's already
[28:54] identified this is part of the Jewish
[28:56] history this goes all the way back to
[28:57] Jacob this is this is part of our lore
[28:59] and our heritage but rather the woman
[29:01] says are you greater than our father my
[29:04] father Jacob which gave us the well and
[29:06] drank thereof himself and his children
[29:08] his cattle so this woman of Samaria is
[29:11] now claiming Kindred to
[29:14] Abraham now imagine what this would mean
[29:16] to a
[29:17] Jew and how this would create just this
[29:21] would provoke a Jew this would really
[29:23] get their their ranker up this would
[29:24] really lead to a a fight and a war of
[29:27] words so she is claiming Kindred ship
[29:29] kinship to Abraham Our Father
[29:32] Jacob and then in verse 20 after Jesus
[29:36] is expounded upon you know kind of
[29:39] discerning uh uh her heart she says I
[29:42] perceive that thou art a prophet in
[29:43] verse 20 it says our fathers now when
[29:46] she says our fathers she's not talking
[29:48] about her Samaritan fathers she's not
[29:50] talking about those who were brought out
[29:51] from babyon and Ava hamoo and saf and
[29:54] all these different places to Samaria
[29:56] she's talking about Abraham Isaac and
[29:57] Jacob Jacob she's talking about the
[30:00] mount that was given to them where there
[30:01] was a temple built in Mount gism and
[30:03] there they worshiped and this was their
[30:05] Mount there in the Holy Mountain and she
[30:06] says our fathers worshiped in this
[30:08] mountain gism to them this was the Holy
[30:11] Mount and ye say that in Jerusalem is
[30:13] the place where men ought to
[30:15] worship again we worship the one true
[30:18] God in this Mount this is where our
[30:20] Temple is established but you guys say
[30:21] we have to go to church in Jerusalem and
[30:23] that's the only proper way to worship
[30:24] and if you if you look at this you'll
[30:26] find these are two people who believed
[30:27] have this same fathers follow the same
[30:30] law but have different places where they
[30:33] worshiped different churches they went
[30:35] to different interpretations different
[30:37] different uh um ideologies as you begin
[30:39] to look into it deeper you know they did
[30:41] it they've done some DNA tests they find
[30:43] that in the DNA the Y chromosome that is
[30:45] shared between the Jews and the
[30:46] Samaritans show a a common ancestry as
[30:49] far back as or at least as early as500
[30:52] years ago so they do share some common
[30:55] ancestry through in that wide chromosome
[30:58] they they were more closely related than
[30:59] they maybe wanted to believe at least to
[31:00] the Jew and now we see where they
[31:03] claimed the same father Jacob they claim
[31:06] to worship they claimed the well is
[31:07] there they our fathers worshiped in this
[31:09] mountain and they considered their own
[31:11] Temple now this is where the Divide
[31:13] begins to come their own temple in Mount
[31:14] gum they believed it to be uh greater
[31:17] than the temple in Jerusalem and even
[31:20] after that Temple was destroyed the
[31:22] Samaritans still looked to that mountain
[31:24] to worship and still believed that that
[31:26] mountain was greater and that Temple
[31:27] though it didn't exist anymore it was
[31:28] greater than the The Temple at Jerusalem
[31:31] they adhered to and believed that they
[31:33] had their own copy of the law of
[31:35] Moses the Antiquity of it we have one
[31:37] that's older we have one that's more
[31:38] original we have the original law that
[31:40] Moses gave here's some Samaritans
[31:42] claiming to have the original Law
[31:44] telling the Jews who thought they were
[31:46] the their direct descendants we are the
[31:48] Jews Our Father Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[31:51] we are the Israelites we are the
[31:53] children of Israel and then to find some
[31:55] other group claims to have a an earlier
[31:58] version of the Bible an earlier version
[32:00] of the law has a better translation of
[32:03] the message than than uh than you do oh
[32:05] my goodness no wonder there was a
[32:08] rivalry no wonder when they showed up at
[32:10] the same restaurant like we don't have
[32:12] any dealings with
[32:13] you we don't we don't have anything to
[32:15] do with
[32:17] you and they considered that law that
[32:20] they had to have greater Authority than
[32:22] the law that the Jews had ah you're
[32:23] following something that that's just not
[32:25] as recent or it is changed you don't
[32:27] have everything we have the Samaritans
[32:30] sacrificed at Passover they observed
[32:32] laws they observed ordinances but then
[32:34] they rejected the Jewish Canon and
[32:36] things and Jewish Traditions that were
[32:37] added to the
[32:39] law so you could almost look at as the
[32:41] Samaritans more perfectly kept the law
[32:44] than the Jews because the Jews added
[32:46] things to the law that the Samaritans
[32:47] said n we don't follow that part we
[32:49] follow the first five books of the Bible
[32:51] that's what we follow these books
[32:53] written by Moses that's what we observe
[32:55] so when you come to the Samaritan it's
[32:56] not just this dog Heathen who's some
[32:59] kind of reprobate but notice her
[33:00] language even though she wasn't Living
[33:02] Clean notice her language she has a
[33:04] language of our father Jacob our fathers
[33:07] worshiped in this mountain a a and you
[33:09] but you claim that we have to Worship in
[33:11] Jerusalem and now notice after Jesus
[33:14] says woman believe me and she begins to
[33:16] speak to him God is a spirit they that
[33:18] worship me we worship in spirit and in
[33:21] truth notice what her conclusion is and
[33:24] this is in her heart the woman saith
[33:26] unto him verse 25
[33:28] I know that Messiah
[33:30] cometh which is called Christ when he
[33:33] has come he will tell us all things she
[33:37] had a
[33:39] better understanding of what the Messiah
[33:41] would do than the Jews did because here
[33:45] he is standing before her and she thinks
[33:46] about the Christ she's thinking my
[33:49] goodness we know now this is her as a
[33:52] Samaritan I know that the Messiah is
[33:54] coming and when he and he's going to be
[33:56] called the Christ he's going to be the
[33:57] anointed one and when he's come he will
[33:59] tell us all things he's going to speak
[34:02] like this so here's the Samaritan is
[34:05] identifying there's something awakened
[34:06] inside of her something very clean
[34:08] something very pure where she realizes
[34:09] whoa I came to this water this well to
[34:12] drink naturally but this man standing
[34:14] before me has gotten to a soul
[34:16] thirst got away from everything that the
[34:19] body may be thirsty and the spirit may
[34:20] be clouded with all these relationships
[34:22] but Mah he has identified something and
[34:24] her thirst for a messiah has
[34:26] awakened so she's just not this rank
[34:28] sinner who rejects everything there's
[34:30] something very sincere about her in her
[34:32] need and in her sin and in her her
[34:34] waywardness and as she stands there
[34:36] she's recognizing now a
[34:40] messiah and so with just that in view
[34:43] that part in
[34:44] view the Samaritan when Jesus uses the
[34:47] Samaritan as an example now we can draw
[34:50] from John chapter 4 to realize just how
[34:52] combative and adversarial this must have
[34:54] been to the Jew to the lawyer and so the
[34:57] Samaritan stands as an antagonist to the
[35:00] religious identity of the lawyer the
[35:03] Samaritan stands because the samarit say
[35:06] well we keep the law and we keep it
[35:07] better we believe the law we believe it
[35:10] more perfectly we believe the Messiah is
[35:12] coming and so there there' been this
[35:14] this uh rivalry and this competition and
[35:16] who had it more figured out and who was
[35:18] better and whose theology was more
[35:19] correct and who could trace their
[35:20] lineage back further and who was who
[35:22] wasn't unclean who had a worst past and
[35:24] and all these different things so he was
[35:26] an antagonist to the n the the religious
[35:29] identity of the lawyer and then he's
[35:30] also an antagonist to the national
[35:32] identity because they would claim hey
[35:34] we're of Jacob we're of the same
[35:36] National line it's not just doctrinal
[35:38] religion they weren't just viewed as as
[35:40] prelit one who has converted to the
[35:42] Jewish religion but now they're claiming
[35:44] to actually be the blood they're
[35:45] actually claiming to be the natural
[35:47] Nation so this would have been a um
[35:49] something that would have antagonized
[35:51] the lawyer in his national identity and
[35:53] his religious
[35:55] identity would have really really hit
[35:57] him pretty
[35:58] hard so I want to ask a question and I
[36:01] just let you ponder it and we can play
[36:03] some Jeopardy music behind it as you
[36:04] think about it but who are our
[36:11] Samaritans right think about it who are
[36:13] our Samaritans in other words in the
[36:16] context of the parable who are the ones
[36:19] that we've made enemies because of
[36:22] differences and the
[36:24] similarities like who is it we feel it's
[36:27] NE necessary to distinguish ourselves
[36:29] from in light of the similarities but
[36:31] really because of the
[36:32] differences who are the ones we've made
[36:34] enemies who is it that we can say we
[36:36] have no dealings with
[36:38] them the Samaritans who who are the
[36:42] Samaritans in our lives in other who are
[36:43] the ones that the lawyer would say I
[36:45] don't owe him Duty a duty I don't owe
[36:47] them a duty I don't owe them a
[36:49] duty I think it's challenging to ask
[36:51] ourselves who are the Samaritans and I
[36:52] would suggest
[36:54] that this is me we ought not have any
[36:58] amen you said brother Aaron what about
[37:00] what about this what about
[37:02] that I who do you want to hate right who
[37:06] is it who is it you want to just go
[37:07] ahead rule your life
[37:10] right I mean that they that they you've
[37:12] got that they're they they they're
[37:15] occupying so much space in your
[37:18] spirit and they live inside your head
[37:21] right and if you could charge them
[37:24] rent and who do you want that who do you
[37:27] want that to be
[37:29] if you if you want to even sit down and
[37:30] I can help you figure find out who who's
[37:33] going to be your enemy who you going to
[37:34] hate who you going to be bitter towards
[37:36] who you going to separate from uh out of
[37:38] anger and cast down as vile and evil who
[37:41] is it you're going to do that
[37:43] with oh we could do that with sin right
[37:47] but do you also do that with the sinner
[37:49] how far would you take it to where
[37:51] there's you're going to go ahead and
[37:52] just have your list of Usual Suspects
[37:54] these are the people we hate on and if
[37:56] you fit this Paradigm if you fit this
[37:58] list of people if you look like this
[37:59] we're going to hate on you we shouldn't
[38:01] have Samaritans in in in the light of
[38:03] how this lawyer had
[38:05] them let me just change it because I
[38:08] want to take this in a different
[38:10] direction are we not the
[38:13] Samaritan see this Jew hated the
[38:16] Samaritan and the use of a Samaritan in
[38:18] this Parable really antagonizes him
[38:20] really causes him to consider and it's
[38:22] probably really agitated him and who
[38:23] knows what he really wanted to say in
[38:25] response but this lawyer the priest and
[38:29] the levite represent the Jews who reject
[38:32] Christ they reject the truth holding to
[38:34] their traditions and their ideology in
[38:37] the letter of it and and because we
[38:39] descend from this and because we're the
[38:41] oldest and we're the first and and we're
[38:43] better and we're greater because of that
[38:44] they actually Hil to this but what do
[38:46] they represent in the people who
[38:47] couldn't see the Messiah the very ones
[38:50] who reject the
[38:51] Messiah but the
[38:55] Samaritan represents an I want to use it
[38:58] as a figure and I'm not saying that this
[38:59] is what Jesus intended by it but we can
[39:01] see this as an at least an analogy
[39:04] represents the Gentile Who coming after
[39:06] the Jew seemingly not heirs to it the
[39:09] promise not being to them they come
[39:10] after and yet still believe
[39:13] right at the very least I would say this
[39:16] is what Jesus who Jesus wants us to
[39:18] model our Behavior after words this is
[39:21] the attitude of the Samaritan the one
[39:23] who does know the law the one who claims
[39:26] Affinity with Joseph
[39:28] this is how they act in other words you
[39:30] should be a Samaritan more than you
[39:32] should a
[39:34] levite and so this in this uh with this
[39:40] perspective I say that the Samaritan
[39:43] represents the true
[39:44] bride who's able to overcome all Pride
[39:48] all bitterness by P of past experience
[39:50] all hurt overcome any kind of Pride or
[39:53] Prejudice overcome any any offense and
[39:56] be the ones who can
[39:58] serve and not hold a grudge and not hold
[40:01] animosity and bitterness but be in a
[40:03] position doesn't mean we go out and say
[40:05] well you know I guess in light of the
[40:06] fact that I'm be neighbor to everybody
[40:07] just go out and start handing out your
[40:08] credit cards and your bills and paying
[40:10] everybody's bill at the restaurant and
[40:12] breakfast is on me tomorrow and and just
[40:14] try to do it as in a way that you're
[40:16] just goingon to I I'm just going trying
[40:18] to be neighborly no it's not just kind
[40:19] of all in this loose just love everybody
[40:21] and hug on everybody and kiss everybody
[40:23] certainly not in the day of a covid-19
[40:25] but it's the point is that we ought to
[40:28] we are the ones that put in a
[40:30] situation where our own past experience
[40:33] begins to cause us to become bitter or
[40:35] to withdraw ourselves and not minister
[40:37] to where our pride would get in the way
[40:39] or or whatever it might be we are the
[40:40] ones who could say wait a minute what
[40:42] does God want me to do what does the
[40:43] word say and get past all these
[40:46] instincts and these biases we've talked
[40:47] about and really truly
[40:51] serve so in this then Christ challenges
[40:56] us not just the lawyer not only as the
[40:59] lawyer us being message Believers Bible
[41:01] Believers Christians the most religious
[41:02] people or the Christian who's the the
[41:04] one standing there say well who is my
[41:06] neighbor and then using some Heathen as
[41:08] an example that challenges Oh by if he
[41:10] could be a good guy then I can be a good
[41:12] guy but he also challenges us as the
[41:15] Samaritan to be that certain Samaritan
[41:18] and really this is what you've been
[41:20] called to do as a contrast to the Jews
[41:22] who took the law and made a tradition
[41:24] took the law and left the life of it
[41:26] took the law and because of it crucified
[41:28] the Lord Of Glory and didn't recognize
[41:30] him we ought to have a
[41:32] different example and a different
[41:34] response to the
[41:37] gospel so it says but a certain
[41:40] Samaritan as he
[41:42] journeyed and this word journeyed is
[41:45] used in the sense to
[41:47] travel it comes from the word which
[41:49] means a traveler's way so as he
[41:51] journeyed it's a way it's his journey
[41:53] it's his path but it's also the word
[41:55] that's used this Greek word is also used
[41:59] of a course of
[42:01] conduct so it speaks of a way of
[42:04] thinking a way of feeling a way of
[42:06] deciding so as a but a certain Samaritan
[42:09] as he journeyed now instead of just
[42:12] taking the sense of as he traveled down
[42:14] this path and it was really a unique
[42:16] path for a Samaritan this would have
[42:17] represented kind of a change like wait a
[42:19] minute what a priest was going a levite
[42:21] was going a Samaritan doesn't need to do
[42:23] this past this route this isn't a
[42:25] typical route that a Samaritan would go
[42:26] down
[42:28] so Jesus isn't just wanting to use it in
[42:30] the natural sense but he's using this
[42:32] word as he journeyed to speak of course
[42:34] of conduct and even the Samaritan as his
[42:37] way of thinking was as he was feeling
[42:38] and as he was deciding and so the
[42:41] actions of the Samaritan take on a
[42:43] different character by the words that
[42:45] Jesus uses the Samaritan as he journeyed
[42:49] what the Samaritan does and I want this
[42:51] to have some real impact uh when I point
[42:53] this out what the Samaritan does is not
[42:55] just impulse in the moment well I guess
[42:58] I should it was not just something that
[43:00] was it would have not been something
[43:02] that was out of character that's where
[43:04] he's deviating from the norm he's doing
[43:06] something he wouldn't normally do but it
[43:08] reflected something in his heart the
[43:11] Samaritan as he journeyed it says he
[43:13] went to him verse 34 he went to him and
[43:16] bound up his wounds pouring in oil and
[43:19] wine and set him on his own beast and
[43:22] brought him to an end and took care of
[43:25] him his in instinct to care his
[43:28] possession of these elements that he
[43:29] could minister with his strength to
[43:31] serve his unselfishness to give him of
[43:33] his own Beast his discipline to
[43:34] persevere not just in treating him on
[43:36] the Wayside but persevere in a manner in
[43:39] a way to bring him to a place where he
[43:41] could be cared for and a place where he
[43:42] could continue to be careful it
[43:44] expressed a manner of life in a way of
[43:46] living it was not just walking by H the
[43:50] Salvation Army bucket uh during
[43:52] Christmas season and throwing a $5 bill
[43:55] in it wasn't just giving to charity it
[43:57] wasn't just being charitable in that
[43:59] moment or that instance but it was as he
[44:01] journeyed this was a course of conduct
[44:03] it was a way he thought a way he felt
[44:05] there's a way he decided and these
[44:06] things represented his Instinct his
[44:09] desire his strength his unselfishness
[44:11] all these things represented a way of
[44:13] living and a way of thinking amen it was
[44:16] something that was in the Samaritan's
[44:17] heart right where as opposed to the
[44:20] priest or levite who would say well I'm
[44:21] obligated by the law to do this I got to
[44:22] do this because the law says to do it I
[44:24] got to do it because the law says to do
[44:25] it this was something that the Samaritan
[44:26] not being bound by the law did it
[44:28] something as a manner of life and a way
[44:30] of
[44:31] living this stands in great contrast to
[44:33] the lawyer who's too busy splitting
[44:34] hairs and arguing about the law to worry
[44:37] about a Samaritan who was hurt after all
[44:40] those reprobates claim that our father
[44:42] Jacob and we worship in this Mount they
[44:44] think they got a better copy of the
[44:45] message I might just had a lot of
[44:48] different reasons why he wouldn't want
[44:49] to do
[44:50] it I had a book recommended to me by a
[44:54] brother this week and I began to read a
[44:56] little bit of it and it's WR it's
[44:57] written by a Christian lawyer imagine
[45:00] that Paradox he's the punchline to every
[45:03] joke
[45:05] obviously I say that about a preacher
[45:07] and a lawyer preacher preacher and a
[45:09] lawyer he's the punchline to every
[45:11] joke but the he makes this statement how
[45:15] when he was in high school he met this
[45:17] this young man who was a Christian
[45:18] professed to be a Christian he tells a
[45:21] very moving story of how that he was
[45:24] going to drop out of school and just
[45:25] basically run away
[45:27] and so he stopped by his neighbor's
[45:29] house who was older than him he'd become
[45:30] a friend to him and he stopped and he
[45:33] said you know what I want to I I'm
[45:35] leaving and I just was coming by to say
[45:37] to say goodbye to you and thank you for
[45:38] being a good friend it was kind of early
[45:40] on a Sunday morning and and and he
[45:43] noticed the guy was just kind of a
[45:44] little bit disheveled and he said hold
[45:46] on I'll be right back and he told him
[45:48] his plans his plan was to go into the
[45:50] national park youim or something like
[45:51] that and he was going to camp out and
[45:53] live off the land or get a job up there
[45:54] he's just going to go off the radar and
[45:56] the guy said hold on I'll be right back
[45:58] and he came back and he had a backpack
[46:00] over his shoulder and he said I'm with
[46:03] you I just want you to know I'm with you
[46:06] and he went with him he said what do you
[46:07] mean you're with me I'm I'll go with you
[46:09] where you're
[46:10] going and as The Story Goes he stuck it
[46:13] with them for these two or three days as
[46:15] a as a and all Whenever there was
[46:17] trouble that came up he said you know
[46:19] what I'm I'm just I'm with you whatever
[46:20] you want to do and eventually the guy
[46:22] realized you know what I'm not going
[46:24] this isn't going to work he couldn't get
[46:25] a job anywhere he's like I'm just going
[46:26] to go back home and he said you know
[46:27] what whatever his friend said whatever
[46:29] you decide I just want you to know I'm
[46:30] with
[46:31] you and he and he said man no one had
[46:33] ever taken an interest in me like that
[46:35] so we get back to the guy's house when
[46:37] they get back they see a another car in
[46:38] the driveway and he said it was his he
[46:40] recognized it as his girlfriend's car
[46:41] his neighbor's girlfriend's car and they
[46:43] go up to the house and they go in and he
[46:45] walks in just kind of instinctively
[46:47] walks in and all of a sudden the
[46:48] girlfriend says oh honey you're home and
[46:50] jumps in his arms and says you're back
[46:52] and he looks around he notices there's
[46:53] gifts that are being open there's dishes
[46:55] and a microwave he's like is it his
[46:57] birthday a microwave would be a really
[46:58] weird gift to give somebody to celebrate
[47:00] when they came into this world he's just
[47:01] kind of confused by everything and then
[47:03] he realizes they had just gotten
[47:05] married and his friend recognized in
[47:09] that moment that Sunday morning he
[47:10] realized this guy needs me he's in a
[47:14] critical juncture he's in a place in his
[47:15] life where I need to be there with him I
[47:17] need to help him and he just had one
[47:19] message I'm with you I'm here with you
[47:22] and and he realized this guy made a
[47:24] sacrifice they just got back maybe from
[47:26] their they're obviously opening up all
[47:28] these new gifts they had just gotten
[47:29] married and he chose to minister to his
[47:32] friend than even to stay there with his
[47:33] wife and he comes back and he realizes
[47:35] in that moment this guy really showed me
[47:39] love and the the the writer makes this
[47:42] observation he says to that point all
[47:43] the Christians I had met seemed to have
[47:45] more opinions about what or who they
[47:47] were against than who they were for
[47:51] amen
[47:55] man we we we claim to be Christians
[47:57] right we're not going to be one of those
[47:58] that say well good thing I call myself a
[48:01] Believer right could he says they seem
[48:05] to be more have more opinions about what
[48:08] and who they're against than who they
[48:09] were
[48:10] for and all this all this person said is
[48:12] I'm for you I'm I'm I'm here for you I'm
[48:14] there for you I'm for you what do you
[48:16] need not not in a way to approve of
[48:18] something that was nefarious or to
[48:20] approve a bad choice of conduct but was
[48:22] there in such a way to where he could
[48:24] actually be of help and a benefit to him
[48:26] and I see that this this this neighbor
[48:29] to this this author of this book he he
[48:32] loved his neighbor as
[48:34] himself and it's a challenge to us when
[48:36] we begin to see this Samaritan who had a
[48:39] particular course of conduct that made
[48:41] him useful to one who is in need it
[48:43] ought to challenge us that this word
[48:46] must have preeminence in our hearts this
[48:49] word having preeminence in our hearts it
[48:51] must become first instinct where we
[48:53] don't resort to scars and wounds and
[48:55] affections and animosity and bitterness
[48:57] and tradition and religion and that's
[48:59] what we act out from like the lawyer
[49:01] busy splitting hair is worried more
[49:02] about who we're against in our opinions
[49:04] of things that are right and wrong but
[49:06] rather let the word become our first
[49:09] instinct let it have preeminence in our
[49:11] hearts not just have some adherence to
[49:12] certain
[49:14] tenants if if we're not careful we just
[49:16] get a list of things we do and this is
[49:18] what we do we baptize in the name of the
[49:19] Lord Jesus Christ we we take communion
[49:22] we wash one another's feet we go to
[49:24] church we don't cut our hair
[49:27] we we wear and we're talking about
[49:28] sisters have a Holiness Standard
[49:30] Brothers have a Holiness standard and we
[49:31] don't cuss and we're supposed to apply
[49:33] the token and we've just distilled it
[49:34] down to a bunch of tenants and in
[49:36] reality we come up with message laws
[49:38] that as long as we kind of fit this
[49:40] pattern and we're doing we're look the
[49:42] part and we act the part and as long as
[49:45] we're doing that we feel that we can
[49:47] have whatever opinions about who we're
[49:49] for and who we're against and we can act
[49:51] how we want live how we want as long as
[49:53] we line with those things and listen
[49:55] that is not what makes a Christian
[49:57] that's not what makes a genuine believer
[50:00] it has to become a life inside your
[50:01] heart it has to be something quickened
[50:03] inside of you and not just you who are
[50:05] good at at
[50:07] discipline there's people who go their
[50:09] entire lives and they never eat meat at
[50:12] least from the point they decide not to
[50:14] they don't smoke they don't eat meat
[50:16] they run 10 miles a day they do all
[50:18] sorts of things out of pure discipline
[50:20] right therefore if you told them you
[50:22] know it's healthier to not have a TV in
[50:24] your home boom TV's gone somebody sent a
[50:27] a meme the other day and it said the the
[50:29] person who doesn't have a TV starter
[50:31] pack I was like what is this and it was
[50:34] a hipster apparently because of the
[50:36] handlebar mustache and the you know the
[50:38] Retro record player and something else I
[50:41] know if was comer or something but it
[50:43] was you know some way that you
[50:45] knew that this was you know this these
[50:48] are the people that don't have TV so
[50:49] anymore if you don't have a TV they just
[50:51] think you're a hipster right how much
[50:54] granola you're making these days right
[50:56] you know you know is this a zero waste
[50:58] household right that's what they're
[50:59] going to think about you so let's not
[51:01] get
[51:02] sidetracked by just the tenants and we
[51:05] adhere to tenants but the life's got to
[51:07] be
[51:07] there and it's interactions like this
[51:10] it's interactions with the with a Jew or
[51:12] it's the your interactions with the
[51:13] Samaritans in your life that really
[51:15] bring out the real truth in your heart
[51:18] let a little opposition come and you'll
[51:19] find what somebody's made of let them go
[51:22] on their own for a while let them get
[51:23] get by let them do what they want let
[51:25] them just be able to think go with the
[51:27] flow but then all of a sudden be met
[51:28] with a challenge and the true colors
[51:30] come right
[51:33] out so this is as he journeyed it spoke
[51:35] to a way of life a particular way of
[51:36] conducting
[51:38] himself again looking back at this verse
[51:40] as he journeyed and
[51:42] likewise as he journeyed came where he
[51:47] was we've talked we've looked at this
[51:50] particular aspect in
[51:53] contrast uh to some of these other
[51:55] actors and how that as a church as a
[51:58] Believer who goes to
[52:00] church our default isn't to gather in
[52:03] the church and just tell everybody they
[52:05] need to come to
[52:07] us there there's a reason why we're not
[52:09] all living in these hotel
[52:11] rooms and working from home where we
[52:15] just come to the lobby to go to church
[52:16] there's a reason why you guys live all
[52:18] over the
[52:20] valley there's a reason why you're
[52:21] dispersed into different professions the
[52:24] the reason why you have different family
[52:25] backgrounds in Dynamics there's a reason
[52:27] why you speak different languages a
[52:29] reason why that your lives are so vastly
[52:31] different it's so that we don't get so
[52:33] caught up in homogenizing everyone
[52:35] according to a way that you should live
[52:36] and act to where we're no longer
[52:38] effective in our families in our
[52:40] community our neighborhoods and and and
[52:42] of people we work with and live
[52:44] around you disperse from here and we
[52:47] don't just gather back into our little
[52:50] our little meeting here and say you
[52:51] better come to us come to our church
[52:53] that's where you're going to get healed
[52:54] I believe that you have healing with you
[52:56] I believe that you have the capacity to
[52:58] minister where you are and that there's
[52:59] things that can change in people's lives
[53:01] even if they never make it to one of our
[53:03] church services you can make a
[53:05] difference in someone's lives and a good
[53:07] one too amen not just making them feel
[53:10] guilty and teaching them water baptism
[53:12] is correct but literally improve their
[53:14] marriages improve their lives bring
[53:16] healing to somebody somebody's bowed
[53:18] down with diabetes and they don't like
[53:20] the fact they have to shoot themselves
[53:21] with insulin and and watch this and
[53:23] watch that and you feel you know what
[53:25] God's A Healer amen
[53:27] you believe that I could pray for you
[53:28] and that God can heal you of your
[53:29] diabetes and not get in our mind well if
[53:31] I could just get him there to church on
[53:33] Sunday and if brother Aaron could just
[53:35] teach a really good message on Malachi 4
[53:37] and if they could just accept the
[53:38] message then they could pray and get
[53:40] healed listen I believe that the word of
[53:43] God works in the mouth of a Believer
[53:45] that's right and that you could pray for
[53:47] that one who has diabetes who confesses
[53:48] that they believe in healing and you can
[53:50] lay your hands on them and pray and you
[53:52] can have a person who's been bound by
[53:54] diabetes healed and delivered and that
[53:56] would be an improvement that's
[53:59] right but we sell ourselves short so
[54:03] often because we make such a put so much
[54:05] effort into
[54:08] church that we're never able to minister
[54:10] Beyond
[54:11] it because it's just everything all the
[54:14] emphasis is on church I said it in the
[54:16] beginning and I'll continue to say it we
[54:18] don't live to go to church we go to
[54:20] church to live amen and we don't our our
[54:23] days aren't consumed with oh if I could
[54:25] just get ABC if I could just get ABC if
[54:26] I could just get ABC no it's not all
[54:28] about
[54:29] ABC it's about being a Christian about
[54:32] living the life being the Bride of Jesus
[54:37] Christ I I'll say it at this point too
[54:41] if if I me brother Aaron ever say my
[54:46] church I'm using it in the same way that
[54:49] you have the right to use
[54:52] it I if I say my church it's not because
[54:55] I think this church is mine any more
[54:56] than it's yours this is our church and
[55:00] if you could do me a favor don't ever
[55:02] call it brother Aaron's Church any more
[55:05] than you would call it brother Manuel's
[55:06] church or brother Albert's Church
[55:10] brother Jeff's church it's our church
[55:13] the church isn't known by the name of
[55:14] the pastor or the name of the guy who
[55:15] started it or however you want to
[55:16] whatever you want to call me this is
[55:19] Arizona Believers
[55:20] Church it's it's bigger than the man
[55:23] bigger than the person
[55:28] well where do we go
[55:32] now
[55:35] amen he says he came where he
[55:38] was that the the the the phrase came
[55:41] where he was it Paints the picture he
[55:43] came down to
[55:45] him he came down to
[55:48] him expresses a
[55:51] humility to become a
[55:54] servant he didn't just look over the
[55:56] side and see him and go you're all
[55:59] right going to be
[56:01] okay well you look like you're going to
[56:03] be okay enjoy your nap whatever whatever
[56:07] it is you're
[56:08] doing he came
[56:10] down to where he was he was willing to
[56:14] become a
[56:15] servant in order to meet him in his
[56:18] need if we only if we just wait till
[56:20] people are ready to come to church
[56:21] there's a lot of people that are never
[56:24] going to feel like they're ready to come
[56:25] to church but your fellowship with them
[56:28] and your right attitude towards them can
[56:30] begin a work in them that disarms them
[56:34] begins a healing process in them and you
[56:36] know what they end up wanting they want
[56:38] to know where you go to
[56:40] church and they're willing to come to
[56:42] church because you've created the kind
[56:44] of dynamic where that's
[56:47] inviting in Luke chap 10:32 it says and
[56:50] likewise a levite when he was at the
[56:52] place came and looked on
[56:55] him and so the actions of the Samaritan
[56:57] contrast those of the
[56:59] levite the Samar the levite kind of came
[57:02] where he was at but he just looked on
[57:04] him but now the Samaritan as he Journey
[57:06] came where he was so it means more than
[57:10] proximity it means more than just being
[57:12] being near but also means being present
[57:14] in their
[57:15] need he did the the levite could say
[57:18] well I I came to the place where I could
[57:19] look on them so he was close to him he
[57:22] was near him but when you're going to be
[57:23] a neighbor to somebody you've got to do
[57:25] more than just be near you've got to
[57:27] have a be present with them in other
[57:29] words you're able to affirm that you
[57:31] understand where they
[57:32] are it's not just calling into the void
[57:35] and hearing a voice come back but it's
[57:37] it's actually going to a place where you
[57:39] can re I see what I see what predicament
[57:41] they're in you could sit back and say
[57:43] well this person struggles with this
[57:44] this person struggles with that they're
[57:45] apparently having a huge Holiness issue
[57:47] and they have this problem that problem
[57:49] but you're just close enough to tell all
[57:51] the problems they have but you're not
[57:53] present enough to really know what the
[57:54] real problem is that's right
[57:58] and when this
[58:00] Samaritan came to where he was it
[58:03] expressed a willingness to Humble
[58:05] himself and we must be willing to Humble
[58:08] ourselves and humble ourselves to the
[58:10] other person in order to help
[58:13] them you've heard the phrase get beneath
[58:17] somebody if you're ever going to help
[58:19] somebody you've got to get beneath
[58:21] them you're not going to be an effective
[58:23] you're not going to Be an Effective
[58:25] Teacher if you stand over them as a
[58:27] know-it-all yeah who's just simply
[58:30] showing them how little they know amen
[58:33] and constantly showing how how silly
[58:35] they are and how you didn't know this
[58:37] and you didn't know that and you didn't
[58:38] you don't know this you're never going
[58:40] to do it that way by being the knowt all
[58:42] that stands over and that's got all the
[58:43] answers to the
[58:45] question you can't help if you're the
[58:47] one if you're perceived as arrogant if
[58:49] you come that's why the scriptures teach
[58:51] us how to go to somebody who's in Fault
[58:53] how to go to somebody who's in error you
[58:55] don't go to them with this arrogance you
[58:57] really blew it this time buddy it should
[58:58] never come out of your mouth I told you
[59:02] so just let that be a victory to
[59:05] yourself just hav't I Told You So Ledger
[59:08] secretly privately and you could just go
[59:10] in your closet and go ah look at all
[59:13] these I told you so because it really
[59:14] doesn't do anybody any good when you go
[59:17] I told you so I told you that was going
[59:18] to happen and then after you say that
[59:20] then you want to say let me show you
[59:22] like no sorry uh-uh no you lost me
[59:27] I I don't feel like we're on the right
[59:28] kind of footing where I'm going to open
[59:30] myself up to you now the antagonizer and
[59:33] let you be my
[59:37] instructor they have to know that you
[59:39] care not just that you know they they're
[59:42] wrong they have to know that you
[59:44] care if you just assert superiority
[59:47] religious superiority uh you know a
[59:49] better Revelation a greater way of
[59:52] living and that kind of approach to
[59:54] somebody it's not going to put them in a
[59:55] place where they're willing to relax
[59:58] willing to open themselves up and
[1:00:00] willing willing to listen to you there's
[1:00:04] people who never consider Christ never
[1:00:06] consider church because of
[1:00:09] Christians yeah and because of church
[1:00:12] and if you come to them
[1:00:15] churchy man they don't want any of that
[1:00:18] I'm not trying to be a hipster but I
[1:00:19] think it'd be great if we unchurched
[1:00:23] church and said it was not what it's
[1:00:26] become but back to what it's supposed to
[1:00:29] be in 1 Corinthians 4:12 he's asking the
[1:00:32] Corinthians who are in a pretty big mess
[1:00:34] he goes what would you prefer what will
[1:00:36] ye shall I come unto you with the rod or
[1:00:39] in love and in the spirit of meekness
[1:00:43] how would you prefer I address this
[1:00:46] situation or how would you prefer I deal
[1:00:48] with it do you want me to confront it
[1:00:51] with a rod you're going to get it buddy
[1:00:55] or would you like me to address it with
[1:00:56] love and in the spirit of
[1:00:58] meekness it's a rhetorical question in
[1:01:01] other words yes love Spirit of meekness
[1:01:04] do it with a tender heart do it
[1:01:06] tenderly we should condescend not be
[1:01:10] condescending because it says the
[1:01:11] Samaritan came where he was we ought to
[1:01:13] be willing to condescend down to where
[1:01:15] they're at but not be condescending from
[1:01:18] above we should be willing to bow down
[1:01:21] to where someone's at not stoop to their
[1:01:24] level don't think that you could become
[1:01:26] a sinner to save a sinner or become a
[1:01:28] drug addict to to recover a drug addict
[1:01:29] we're not talking about engaging in
[1:01:31] their behavior or identifying with them
[1:01:33] or becoming one with them in their sin
[1:01:34] in order to help them well I'm just
[1:01:36] doing it to save them no don't fool
[1:01:37] yourself but there's got to be a
[1:01:39] willingness through some means to humble
[1:01:41] yourself humble your spirit get meet
[1:01:43] them on their level is this not how
[1:01:46] we're instructed in the message to
[1:01:47] witness if you talk to somebody who's a
[1:01:49] fisherman talk to him about fishing
[1:01:52] brother Del he wouldn't lack for
[1:01:54] material right we could even whip up our
[1:01:56] phones like we do sometimes and we we do
[1:01:58] fish War you know and and eventually
[1:02:01] it's like well I don't like bass and I'm
[1:02:03] like well I don't fish for salmon so we
[1:02:05] we we remain champions in our own right
[1:02:08] but the the the whole point is you talk
[1:02:09] to them about something they're
[1:02:10] interested in oh quantum mechanics I
[1:02:13] love that
[1:02:14] stuff yeah you know or really what is
[1:02:17] that that's interesting and you talk to
[1:02:18] get to know him and he says once you've
[1:02:20] done that you're building a rapport it
[1:02:22] wasn't brother Brandon wasn't eliciting
[1:02:24] us to some kind of secret code where if
[1:02:27] you talk to them about what they like uh
[1:02:29] uh you've checked the box and now move
[1:02:31] on to the
[1:02:32] next well he looks like he's into racing
[1:02:34] and I'll talk about you like racing
[1:02:35] Racing's good well so how are you
[1:02:38] baptized it's a means of getting
[1:02:40] somebody to they identify with you they
[1:02:43] realize you
[1:02:44] care have you ever had maybe a family
[1:02:46] member or somebody you know they never
[1:02:47] ask you how you're doing you go on
[1:02:50] vacation you go visit family you come
[1:02:51] back they never say oh so how is your
[1:02:53] trip how's your mom doing how is this
[1:02:56] person how was that how was it was it
[1:02:57] good I know you love going how did they
[1:02:58] never ask about
[1:03:00] it and that's and what it creates this
[1:03:03] awkwardness where the person walks away
[1:03:05] go you know what this is really shallow
[1:03:08] but if you talk to somebody and you
[1:03:09] really begin to relate oh you do this
[1:03:11] you do that then they realize this
[1:03:12] person's more in this person's
[1:03:14] interested he's there for me this is I
[1:03:18] it's more than just the the the the the
[1:03:20] religion that's got to talked to so many
[1:03:22] people in a
[1:03:23] day and and if they do they get
[1:03:26] themselves out of uh they get themselves
[1:03:28] into the kingdom no this is not just
[1:03:30] checking the Box this is really having a
[1:03:32] heart so we can be a we can evangelize
[1:03:34] the word do we believe this message is
[1:03:37] great do we believe it's the truth do we
[1:03:40] believe it has power do we believe
[1:03:42] there's benefits that that that come
[1:03:44] with it that we can partake in and that
[1:03:46] others can partake in then then let's
[1:03:49] view it that
[1:03:51] way be willing to Bow ourselves
[1:04:03] Jesus said but he that is greatest among
[1:04:05] you shall be your
[1:04:07] servant if it's great if this is the
[1:04:10] greatest then you're the
[1:04:12] servants everyone else is serving
[1:04:15] themselves their agendas their political
[1:04:17] agendas their selfish agendas their
[1:04:19] religious agendas all their Church
[1:04:21] agendas you're the only one that can
[1:04:22] truly serve somebody else
[1:04:27] Jesus said in Mark chapter
[1:04:30] 10 how Gentiles exercise lordship over
[1:04:33] each other the one who has Authority the
[1:04:35] one who's the ruler he he's the one
[1:04:37] that's the greatest and you serve me and
[1:04:39] I'm the greatest so you serve me he says
[1:04:41] but it shall not be so among you but
[1:04:43] whosoever will be great among you shall
[1:04:44] be your
[1:04:46] minister and whosoever you will be the
[1:04:49] chiefest shall be servant of all amen
[1:04:53] for even the son of man came not to be
[1:04:55] minister unto but to minister and to
[1:04:57] give his life a ransom for many we are
[1:04:59] the continuation of the ministry of the
[1:05:02] son of man not to be ministered to by
[1:05:05] the son of man but feeding on the
[1:05:07] unfailing body word of the son of man we
[1:05:10] go forth to
[1:05:13] serve we want to serve
[1:05:15] him we want to be his hands we want to
[1:05:18] be his feet we want to be his eyes we
[1:05:19] want to be his
[1:05:22] heart we are we are to minister we're to
[1:05:24] be servants not exercise
[1:05:27] lordship I'm going to close with this
[1:05:29] we'll leave
[1:05:31] off we'll leave off the uh some of these
[1:05:34] points
[1:05:36] here but it's from this standpoint of
[1:05:40] humility this standpoint of
[1:05:44] service that the Samaritan was able to
[1:05:46] see the need and then meet
[1:05:48] it and it's when you have a heart like
[1:05:50] this you're going to be able to
[1:05:51] recognize
[1:05:52] needs not just make quick knee-jerk
[1:05:54] reactions and judgments
[1:05:56] but actually see the need and then meet
[1:05:59] it and not with the idea that you're the
[1:06:01] you're the solution to everyone's
[1:06:03] problems but one who's willing to serve
[1:06:05] one who's willing to minister one who's
[1:06:07] willing to provide the solution and you
[1:06:10] don't even get
[1:06:12] credit your name doesn't go on the
[1:06:14] patent the invention is not named after
[1:06:16] you you're just happy that the need was
[1:06:19] met
[1:06:21] amen and it's from that standpoint says
[1:06:24] when he came where he
[1:06:26] was and when he saw
[1:06:29] him it's once you come to where he is
[1:06:32] that you can actually see him and I'll
[1:06:34] close I'll just close it there brother
[1:06:36] Michael if you can come I can hold
[1:06:38] sister Opel if you need me to hold her
[1:06:41] but if you could come I want you to
[1:06:43] ponder this I I I'm leaving off some
[1:06:45] things here that we'll just get to in
[1:06:47] the next
[1:06:49] service Jesus developed the Samaritan's
[1:06:52] character in just a short story he
[1:06:55] developed the Samaritan character to
[1:06:57] teach us how to love our
[1:07:00] neighbors this he identifies him as
[1:07:03] being one who's sensitive one who had a
[1:07:04] particular way of life his manner of
[1:07:06] life was one of humility and service one
[1:07:09] who is not bound by Prejudice towards
[1:07:10] the Jews because the Jews and the
[1:07:12] Samaritans had a rivalry not one who is
[1:07:14] bound by hate because he may have been
[1:07:16] treated poorly by a Jew in the past just
[1:07:19] as the woman at the well was like wait a
[1:07:21] minute hold
[1:07:23] on the Samaritan could have been the
[1:07:25] same same
[1:07:26] way and I believe that we will never
[1:07:30] fulfill the word we will never be
[1:07:31] brought to a place of this great
[1:07:33] climactic body change until we recognize
[1:07:35] that we are the
[1:07:38] Samaritan we identify so much with John
[1:07:41] chapter
[1:07:43] 4 how that brother bam used this so
[1:07:46] often as a symbol of his own
[1:07:49] Ministry and he would use it as an
[1:07:51] example in prayer lines time and time
[1:07:52] again here stands a woman here stands a
[1:07:55] man
[1:07:56] and I say like it was in John chapter 4
[1:07:59] and begin to give the same sign to a
[1:08:01] woman as Jesus gave to this
[1:08:04] woman so it this story should mean so
[1:08:07] much to us to realize this role of a
[1:08:09] Samaritan the role of the Samaritans in
[1:08:11] scripture and even begin to identify
[1:08:13] there's this uniqueness to these
[1:08:14] Samaritans they're kind of this hybrid
[1:08:16] they're Jews but not Jews they believe
[1:08:18] but don't have and they have these
[1:08:20] that's what really we are when it comes
[1:08:23] to we're really not Gentiles we're the
[1:08:24] bride we're really not Jews were the
[1:08:26] bride we occupy this strange space
[1:08:28] between Jews and
[1:08:31] Gentiles and until we recognize our
[1:08:34] responsibility and I'm using this phrase
[1:08:36] just as a means to try to summarize
[1:08:38] what's embodied in this actor in this
[1:08:40] Parable we've got to recognize ourselves
[1:08:42] as Samaritans whose manner of life is
[1:08:44] one of service who's willing to Humble
[1:08:46] themselves who's willing to go meet
[1:08:47] people in their needs willing to let
[1:08:50] Pride go out of the way and pretense and
[1:08:52] politics and personality and really be
[1:08:54] sincere to think Lord how can I love my
[1:08:57] neighbor as
[1:08:59] myself and you'll find that Jesus that's
[1:09:02] exactly what he was able to do as a Jew
[1:09:04] to the Samaritan because when she said
[1:09:06] well we're not supposed to have Dillons
[1:09:08] he's like fine be that way he didn't do
[1:09:10] that he had needs to go by
[1:09:13] Samaria he had purposed in his heart he
[1:09:17] he was going to follow the Lord's will
[1:09:18] he's going to do what he should say and
[1:09:20] she says I know when the Messiah
[1:09:23] comes he's going to tell us these things
[1:09:27] and Jesus said unto her I that speak
[1:09:29] unto you thee am
[1:09:34] he and then it
[1:09:38] says in verse 28 the woman well let me
[1:09:42] read verse 27 all right I am closing
[1:09:45] just get those stretch out and upon this
[1:09:50] upon this scene came his disciples it
[1:09:54] marveled that he talked with the woman
[1:09:57] why
[1:09:58] Samaritan yet no man said what seekest
[1:10:01] thou or why talkest thou with her nobody
[1:10:03] say anything why it's like this is
[1:10:06] taboo what is he doing doesn't he know
[1:10:09] better nobody inquired nobody asked no
[1:10:11] nobody said what's happening here but
[1:10:13] notice what happens in the meantime
[1:10:14] while they're
[1:10:16] busy pretending not to be
[1:10:19] racist says the woman then left her
[1:10:21] water pot and went her way into the City
[1:10:25] and and said to the men come and see a
[1:10:27] man which told me all things that ever I
[1:10:30] did is this not the Christ then they
[1:10:33] went out of the city and came unto him
[1:10:38] meanwhile the disciples are just all
[1:10:39] worried about eating and everything else
[1:10:41] and they're all worried about other
[1:10:42] things but then the Bible says in verse
[1:10:44] 39 and many of the Samaritans of that
[1:10:47] City believed on him for the saying of
[1:10:50] the woman which testified he told me all
[1:10:53] that I ever did so when the Samaritans
[1:10:56] were come unto him they besought him
[1:10:58] that he would t with him and he Abode
[1:11:00] there two days and many more believed
[1:11:04] because of his own word and said unto
[1:11:08] the woman now we believe not because of
[1:11:11] thy saying for we have heard him
[1:11:13] ourselves and know that this is indeed
[1:11:16] the Christ the savior of the
[1:11:19] world can we not who have benefited by
[1:11:22] the grace of God benefited by the love
[1:11:25] of Christ benefited then by the the the
[1:11:28] the the the the word which looks beyond
[1:11:30] our own Prejudice our own differences
[1:11:32] our own hypocrisy the own existence of
[1:11:34] adultery and our previous relationships
[1:11:36] and all those things as Christ did the
[1:11:38] woman of Samaria and then she was turned
[1:11:41] into not a bitter disciple but an
[1:11:44] evangelist for Christ
[1:11:46] amen not a
[1:11:49] legalist who turned around and said yeah
[1:11:51] can you believe those Samaritans to the
[1:11:53] rest of the the disciples as a div
[1:11:55] invited the bread and the spoils and
[1:11:56] began to eat and talk about that weird
[1:11:58] woman that was just talking to Jesus
[1:12:00] while they were busy murmuring about the
[1:12:03] Samaritan she was busy getting the job
[1:12:06] done
[1:12:07] amen she was busy going into the city
[1:12:09] say come see a
[1:12:11] man come see a life come see a truth
[1:12:14] come see a
[1:12:16] way a way of happiness and
[1:12:19] joy and and they got and her example got
[1:12:22] their attention
[1:12:25] and they followed and then it got to
[1:12:27] where they didn't just believe because
[1:12:29] of her
[1:12:30] testimony they believed because they
[1:12:32] heard him
[1:12:33] himself who did that a
[1:12:37] Samaritan who did Jesus want us to
[1:12:40] be when he questions ask who's my
