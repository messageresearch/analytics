[0:01] jeremiah chapter 10 verses 10 to 15
[0:03] it says but the lord
[0:07] is the true god he is the living god
[0:11] and an everlasting king at his wrath the
[0:15] earth shall tremble
[0:17] and nations shall not be able to abide
[0:19] his indignation
[0:21] now i'm reading this for some context um
[0:24] just to see how he's addressing the
[0:27] disobedient but then also identifying
[0:29] himself as the true and living god
[0:31] thus shall you say unto them the gods
[0:34] that have not made the heavens and the
[0:35] earth
[0:36] even they shall perish from the earth
[0:38] and from under
[0:40] these heavens so now as we've been
[0:41] looking at genesis 1 1
[0:43] we see that god is distinguishing
[0:44] himself from all other deities
[0:46] there's only one that's created the
[0:48] heavens and the earth there's only one
[0:49] creator
[0:50] he says he has made the earth by his
[0:52] power
[0:53] he hath established the world by his
[0:55] wisdom and hath stretched out the
[0:58] heavens by his discretion
[1:00] when he uttereth his voice there's a
[1:01] multitude of waters in the heavens
[1:03] and he causeth the vapors to ascend from
[1:06] the ends of the earth
[1:07] he maketh lightnings with rain and
[1:09] bringeth forth the wind
[1:11] out of his treasures every man is
[1:14] brutish
[1:15] in his knowledge every founder is
[1:17] confounded by graven image
[1:19] for his molten image is falsehood and
[1:21] there is no breath in them so man
[1:23] can only create something false
[1:25] something without without life
[1:27] they are vanity and the work of heirs
[1:31] in the time of their visitation they
[1:33] shall perish
[1:34] i what a powerful powerful reading if we
[1:36] could just bow our heads in a word of
[1:38] prayer
[1:39] gracious heavenly father lord we're so
[1:41] happy to be gathered together today
[1:43] in your presence lord we realize that
[1:45] it's not the four walls that define the
[1:47] gathering
[1:48] nor is it the amenities within those
[1:50] walls and how nice the setup or
[1:52] arrangement may be
[1:54] but lord it's the character of the
[1:55] people that make the church beautiful
[1:57] lord is coming and gathering in your
[1:59] name that makes that makes the meeting
[2:01] worth it
[2:02] and lord we're grateful for that lord as
[2:04] we are very happy for the facility that
[2:06] we do have
[2:08] and we're very happy for the kindness
[2:09] that's been shown to us
[2:11] uh by this uh property lord we realize
[2:14] that it is your grace that has brought
[2:16] us here
[2:16] is your grace that keeps us lord that
[2:19] there's no other
[2:21] there's no other thing we're looking to
[2:23] other than the promise that you said
[2:24] you'd meet us here
[2:25] so now fathers we stand in your presence
[2:27] we pray that you'd come
[2:28] speak to our hearts through your word as
[2:29] we commit it to you in the name of the
[2:31] lord jesus christ we pray
[2:33] amen amen you can be seated
[2:40] i'm wanting to continue on this subject
[2:44] of in the beginning and uh
[2:47] and just take a little bit further step
[2:50] into this
[2:51] and look at and we can start here by
[2:52] looking at genesis chapter
[2:55] chapter 1 verse 1 again and i'm just
[2:58] going to jump right into it
[3:00] kind of the the trajectory of where i
[3:02] had been
[3:03] in the prior and last service i just i'm
[3:07] wanting to back up a little bit
[3:08] realizing that
[3:09] maybe the direction we were going we've
[3:12] kind of established some things i think
[3:14] that
[3:14] are important here at the outset but i
[3:16] want you to back up and
[3:18] just revisit a few things here um at the
[3:21] beginning just a couple things at the
[3:22] beginning and just go down this path
[3:24] uh to share something with you in the
[3:26] beginning god
[3:27] created the heaven and the earth and i
[3:29] want to begin to look at this word
[3:31] create and created
[3:33] and start thinking more deeply about
[3:35] what is what is he even assumed in the
[3:37] use of this word
[3:38] to say creation as we read in the
[3:40] beginning it says man is brutus in his
[3:42] knowledge it says every founder because
[3:45] man cannot create he found he con
[3:46] he shapes things he fashions things he's
[3:49] confounded by the graven image so even
[3:51] the image or the molten image
[3:52] that he graves is a falsehood to him it
[3:55] cannot speak back to him it's vanity
[3:57] it's a work of heirs
[3:59] and so when it speaks of creation this
[4:01] is something that's specific to god
[4:03] and virtually everywhere in the old
[4:05] testament where this is used it's only
[4:07] used for god this verb create is only
[4:09] used
[4:09] in conjunction with god there's three
[4:11] places i believe uh
[4:13] one in the book of joshua and then
[4:15] another two
[4:16] places in the book of samuel first
[4:17] samuel where the word is translated to
[4:19] cut
[4:20] but everywhere else where it's
[4:21] translated to create it's only used of
[4:24] god so this is something
[4:25] that speaks of a characteristic or an
[4:27] essential attribute of god
[4:29] and to create it's uh often the way this
[4:33] is used as it pertains to god as he just
[4:35] wasn't just
[4:35] making uh he was saying making something
[4:38] out of nothing that would be how some
[4:40] people would describe it to create
[4:41] is to begin with nothing and to make
[4:43] something out of nothing
[4:45] but it's more than just making something
[4:47] material
[4:48] and this is how i want us to begin to
[4:50] think more deeply about creation
[4:52] it's more than just making something
[4:53] tangible something visible or something
[4:55] material
[4:56] but it's god designing something with
[4:58] function
[5:00] that it's not just bringing something
[5:02] there's a blah there's just a mesh there
[5:03] but it has function
[5:04] and it has operation so when god created
[5:07] he just doesn't bring forth a mass or a
[5:09] material
[5:10] but god assigns a function to it he
[5:13] gives it a particular ability or
[5:15] function
[5:15] and so he's placing it in a role so when
[5:18] god creates there's
[5:19] there's an operation to the creation
[5:21] there's a function to the creation
[5:22] there's a position that he gives the
[5:24] creation and so this is an
[5:26] act and this is where i hope that you
[5:28] can just uh just
[5:29] purpose in your heart to pay close
[5:32] attention
[5:34] and just focus on on these things
[5:36] because they're all just really tightly
[5:37] compacted and connected together
[5:39] and i may not be creating the
[5:41] appropriate tension to hold your
[5:43] attention but it's just going to be very
[5:45] very focused and
[5:46] along these lines this is an act of god
[5:49] determining
[5:50] destiny when god begins to create this
[5:53] is an act of god assigning things and
[5:55] placing things
[5:56] and it's a divine decree that is
[5:58] designing
[5:59] and establishing things with a purpose
[6:02] so god's just not saying oh let's see
[6:04] what happens in throwing things out
[6:05] there but it's an act of god and as he
[6:07] acts he begins to give
[6:09] issue this divine decree and this decree
[6:11] is actually designing something
[6:13] and establishing that something for a
[6:15] purpose
[6:17] in proverbs chapter 3 verse 19.
[6:20] and i want you to focus on this wisdom
[6:22] and understanding the lord
[6:24] by his wisdom have founded the earth
[6:27] by understanding hath he established the
[6:30] heavens
[6:31] so this has given us an insight into
[6:34] what
[6:34] what attributes of god or what
[6:36] characteristics of god or and
[6:38] in play are operating when he begins to
[6:41] create the heavens and the earth
[6:42] his infinite knowledge it speaks of
[6:44] wisdom that founder of the earth it's
[6:45] his infinite knowledge
[6:47] it's his skill so his infinite knowledge
[6:49] and skill by wisdom by understanding he
[6:52] finds founds the earth
[6:53] he establishes the heavens his skill is
[6:56] manifested in the composition of the
[6:57] earth
[6:58] his skill is manifested in how that he
[7:00] the structure of the entire
[7:02] the economy of the stars things are
[7:04] placed in the heavens
[7:05] and it's declaring his wisdom it's
[7:07] declaring his knowledge
[7:09] and so it's by his wisdom he esta he's
[7:12] uh
[7:13] founded the earth by his understanding
[7:15] he established the heavens
[7:17] so he's establishing the order and the
[7:19] essence of all things
[7:21] so we're think we're wanting just to
[7:23] think more than just god created the
[7:24] heavens and the earth and then we move
[7:25] on
[7:26] we've already looked at this how that
[7:27] god tipped his showed his hand at the
[7:29] very beginning
[7:30] in the beginning god created the heavens
[7:32] bridegroom and the earth bride
[7:34] i mean he already he's already laying it
[7:36] out there so now we're thinking more
[7:37] deeply about creation
[7:39] that it's not just god saying throwing
[7:41] something out there and letting things
[7:42] bounce off of one another
[7:44] and misfire and some lining up and i
[7:46] mean they literally teach you at least
[7:48] in the college i went to and it was in
[7:49] texas so you would expect it to maybe
[7:51] be a little bit bible leaning but they
[7:53] just taught you it's hey we're here
[7:54] because of the lottery
[7:56] that things over billions of years
[7:58] mutated and it just misfired and had
[8:00] been mutating for
[8:01] billions and billions of years but then
[8:03] finally just the right combination
[8:05] matched up and
[8:06] you got another cell and then it took
[8:08] another billion years for
[8:09] that to mutate and it's always misfiring
[8:12] always mutating
[8:13] but then all of a sudden it just
[8:14] happened to line up again
[8:16] and there's some that believe that god
[8:17] may have just scattered matter out there
[8:19] and just watched it bounce off of one
[8:20] another and
[8:21] and scatter around and this is how we
[8:23] got to where we are today
[8:24] but this is something that god by his
[8:26] wisdom did this
[8:28] so he's establishing order and essence
[8:30] in his creation
[8:32] in the heavens he's directing their
[8:34] station we he read about and we hear
[8:36] brother brahm talk about how a clinker
[8:37] broke off that son he said stop there
[8:39] and god is writing his first bible and
[8:41] he's particular
[8:42] not yet not yet not yet there
[8:46] it wasn't just let it spin out into
[8:47] orbit and let it never stop but no he
[8:49] he had these uh he set the station of it
[8:52] then he set the motion of it
[8:54] he set the structure of it this is god
[8:56] writing a bible in the heavens
[8:58] and he's establishing order and he's
[8:59] establishing essence and he's
[9:01] establishing all these different things
[9:03] to his creation so creation implies
[9:06] divine wisdom
[9:08] we read in the beginning god created we
[9:10] cannot begin to affix
[9:11] our notions of baking we can't begin to
[9:14] fix our notions of building a house
[9:16] there's no way that we can actually
[9:18] begin to fully understand what it means
[9:20] we say god creates
[9:21] because it implies divine wisdom through
[9:23] which his divine will acts
[9:26] he acts according to his wisdom now
[9:27] there's a lot of times we don't act
[9:29] according to our wisdom
[9:30] why are you doing that why are you
[9:31] setting that up oh i want to do it well
[9:33] what's causing well i have skill i have
[9:36] designed
[9:37] uh uh chops you know i'm putting
[9:38] something together well why are you
[9:39] doing it it's fun i want to do it and
[9:41] there's no divine wisdom in it and when
[9:43] when it's finished what is it it's a
[9:44] ramp what are you gonna use that ramp
[9:45] for i'm gonna ride my bicycle as hard as
[9:48] i can
[9:48] and jump off this ramp have you thought
[9:50] about what might happen if you do that
[9:51] no
[9:52] no i just want to do it and thankfully
[9:56] there's a lot of people who've done it
[9:57] and they videoed it so
[9:58] we can just binge fail videos because
[10:01] man
[10:01] not in his wisdom built the ramp but
[10:04] just in his ability
[10:06] and so creation implies divine wisdom
[10:09] through which the divine will is
[10:11] accomplished or he acts
[10:13] so that this is what connects god's
[10:15] wisdom
[10:16] with his will and to his word because it
[10:19] says in hebrews chapter 11 verse 3
[10:21] through faith we understand that the
[10:22] worlds
[10:23] were framed by the word of god so god's
[10:26] will
[10:26] is his word and god's will operates
[10:29] according to his
[10:30] divine wisdom so the wisdom is the word
[10:33] the will is the word these all three are
[10:34] connected together so when we begin to
[10:36] speak about
[10:37] wisdom and understanding we haven't
[10:39] somehow divorced that from the word
[10:41] but it's it's it's the one and the same
[10:44] god has a wisdom he has an understanding
[10:46] his knowledge his skill
[10:48] and he begins to create and that's his
[10:51] divine will now is being acted out it's
[10:53] his
[10:54] word and we've looked at how creation is
[10:57] an expression of the creator
[11:00] and so when some when god creates
[11:01] something expressing who he is and so
[11:03] creation is
[11:05] then an expression of god's wisdom
[11:07] creation is an expression
[11:09] of god's understanding and this is how i
[11:12] want to begin to
[11:14] place these words into your thinking
[11:15] today when god creates
[11:17] it's thought-driven it's not just reflex
[11:20] or instinct or impulse
[11:23] uh and it's not it it's although it
[11:25] would be passionate and though it would
[11:27] be
[11:28] um there would be things to it uh that
[11:31] would be driving him it's purposeful
[11:33] it's thought-driven
[11:34] and then it's also purpose-focused so he
[11:38] has a thought
[11:39] that he's been pondering there's
[11:40] something that's in his mind
[11:42] that that he's meditating on as the
[11:44] bible says in psalms
[11:45] my my my mind my heart is indicting a
[11:48] good matter
[11:49] that means i'm pondering i'm thinking
[11:51] about it i'm processing he says my
[11:52] tongue is as the pen
[11:53] of a ready writer this is this describes
[11:56] god
[11:57] that his heart is indicting a good
[11:58] matter it's he's pondering he's mulling
[12:00] over he's thinking about it
[12:02] it's expanding it's growing in his in
[12:04] his thoughts as he begins to think about
[12:05] it
[12:05] and so this is creation is an expression
[12:08] of god's wisdom
[12:09] and his understanding it's thought
[12:10] driven and then it's purpose focused
[12:14] god has a purpose in doing it it's not i
[12:16] have a thought i want to bring that
[12:17] thought into existence and then it's
[12:18] kind of like now what can i do with this
[12:21] and i can remember uh when i was a kid
[12:24] and i'm not i'm not an artist and i
[12:26] would draw some i mean i would just make
[12:27] a shape and
[12:28] what is that and i'd try to make it into
[12:30] something because i wasn't an artist
[12:32] that could conceptualize something
[12:34] and then begin to put it on piece of
[12:35] paper i would just kind of let my hand
[12:37] jerk around until i was like oh that's
[12:39] kind of a neat shape i'll add this and
[12:40] add that and like yeah i meant to draw
[12:42] that
[12:42] that's what i had in my mind no that's
[12:43] just my my hand
[12:45] moving across a piece of paper but you
[12:47] take someone who's an artist they begin
[12:49] to put something forth
[12:50] they're purpose-focused this has a
[12:52] particular design to it this is going to
[12:54] have a particular
[12:55] place in this overall drawing or
[12:56] whatever that's being done god here
[12:58] is not only thought-driven but he's
[13:00] purpose-focused as he brings creation
[13:02] into existence
[13:04] and it's important to understand that as
[13:06] it says he fi he has founded the earth i
[13:09] want to keep saying he found
[13:10] or he finds it but that's not exactly
[13:13] what uh what is being expressed
[13:15] he founded the earth by wisdom he
[13:18] established the heavens by understanding
[13:20] so as god begins to act it's knowledge
[13:22] based
[13:24] god knows when god put something forth
[13:27] he's not over there going
[13:29] okay i wonder what this is going to do
[13:31] he knows exactly
[13:33] and so as he is it is thought driven
[13:35] purpose focused and knowledge based
[13:37] he can he he designs it in a way to fit
[13:40] his will
[13:42] he decided in a way to accomplish his
[13:43] purpose his overall objective
[13:45] and so i began to ponder this last week
[13:49] as i was getting ready for this sunday
[13:51] and it's elohim the architect
[13:54] and and not only is the idea guy or the
[13:57] visionary or the one that
[13:58] the artist or the one that could have
[14:00] the concept in his mind but he's also
[14:02] the architect
[14:03] who can put it out there and make sense
[14:04] of it and there's many there's there's
[14:07] times i say many
[14:08] boy i may be way overstating that for
[14:09] some of us there's times in people's
[14:11] lives where maybe they have a concept or
[14:13] an idea and they kind of jot it down or
[14:15] they express it to somebody and they say
[14:17] well what do you want your website to
[14:18] look like well i was thinking this i was
[14:19] thinking that well just kind of do a
[14:21] mock-up for me
[14:22] and you just put stuff out there then
[14:23] you take a an architect
[14:25] you take an artist you take a designer
[14:27] graphic designer and they take all your
[14:29] mumbo jumbo and your words and your
[14:31] vision and all your thoughts
[14:32] and then they they actually take what
[14:34] you're thinking about and they
[14:35] put it into something a concept you're
[14:37] like that's that's exactly what i was
[14:39] thinking
[14:40] that's exactly what i had in mind and so
[14:42] god is not just the
[14:44] idea guy but he's actually the architect
[14:46] he is
[14:47] he's not only the visionary the
[14:49] entrepreneur the one that has a great
[14:50] idea
[14:51] but now as the architect and the
[14:53] engineer he can begin to lay this
[14:55] out and put the pieces into place and
[14:57] he's the one
[14:58] that'll see it all the way through he
[15:00] doesn't need to bring in another builder
[15:03] he's the engine he's the thought guy
[15:04] he's the engineer he's the architect
[15:06] he's the builder
[15:07] he's the finisher the author and the
[15:09] finisher of the creation
[15:11] and so in his mind he had a plan and
[15:14] this is a language that's familiar to us
[15:16] our term familiar to us
[15:17] a masterpiece in his mind he had a
[15:19] masterpiece
[15:20] and so as god begins to create it is his
[15:23] voice
[15:24] that is declaring his will and that is
[15:26] declaring his pleasure
[15:28] as he begins to think and he begins to
[15:30] speak his voice is declaring
[15:32] what's in his heart what's in his mind
[15:33] and is declaring his desire
[15:35] and his pleasure the bible says
[15:39] by wisdom he's made the heavens to him
[15:43] to him that by wisdom made the heavens
[15:46] for his mercy
[15:47] endureth forever you'll find this
[15:49] scripture frequently
[15:51] i expressed well we'll get there
[15:53] eventually
[15:54] there we go you'll find this expressed
[15:57] often
[15:58] in a number of places that by his wisdom
[16:01] he fashioned the world by his wisdom he
[16:04] fashioned creation
[16:05] and wisdom it speaks of understanding
[16:08] skill it actually speaks of skill so you
[16:10] say god has skills
[16:13] the greatest of all and we just use a
[16:15] language to try to help us to understand
[16:18] because we've got skills well then god's
[16:20] got the better skills
[16:22] and but this is he's a god that is
[16:23] skilled wisdom speaks of
[16:25] discernment our wisdom speaks of
[16:28] discretion
[16:29] it speaks of knowledge so by his
[16:31] discretion
[16:32] so god was discretionary how he created
[16:36] he was very purposeful with each step
[16:38] that's why you you can look at god's
[16:40] creation and
[16:41] and i kind of varied away from this in
[16:42] my notes uh just so that i wouldn't get
[16:45] um too lost in this path but i'm going
[16:47] to read a statement here in a moment
[16:48] from power of transformation
[16:50] and god uses the language to say god was
[16:52] above it all and he let it evolute on up
[16:54] to himself
[16:55] so you look in creation and you could
[16:56] say oh we see
[16:58] evolution and science has seen the
[17:01] fingerprints of god
[17:03] but had doesn't have doesn't have the
[17:05] the file to identify who he is
[17:07] but they see the evolution single cell
[17:09] organism and how things are connected
[17:11] and they evolve and it's
[17:12] evolving all up because god is above it
[17:14] all letting it evolute up so with each
[17:16] station god is purposeful
[17:18] as he creates because he has discretion
[17:21] there's knowledge to his design
[17:23] but wisdom also speaks of intelligence
[17:27] and this may be a phrase i'm wanting to
[17:29] just anchor in our minds today as we go
[17:31] forward in this
[17:32] to him that by intelligence made the
[17:35] heavens
[17:35] divine intelligence by his knowledge his
[17:38] understanding his discernment his
[17:40] discretion his skill
[17:41] he made the heavens it was an
[17:43] intelligence a divine intelligence that
[17:46] created
[17:46] the heavens and the earth now in the
[17:49] message power of transformation
[17:53] he says it was god the great master
[17:56] of all intelligence and he had in his
[17:59] mind
[18:00] what he wanted to do just like when the
[18:03] man that built this trailer
[18:05] and so he's making
[18:08] he's making reference to the trailer
[18:10] park i believe it was in prescott
[18:12] and he and he's saying the man that
[18:14] built this trailer when you brethren
[18:15] here that designed this park
[18:18] how you would make it it was in your
[18:20] mind and you kept working
[18:22] that vision out now that's how a man
[18:24] ought to operate if he's going to build
[18:25] something
[18:26] he's going to as the bible even says
[18:28] what if you're gonna build something you
[18:29] count the materials you count the cost
[18:31] you whether
[18:31] you find out whether you have the
[18:32] resources and the land and and the labor
[18:35] to put something together so
[18:36] you don't just start something without
[18:38] having first in your mind conceptualized
[18:40] resources labor
[18:42] opportunity all those things he says
[18:44] well you brother when you designed the
[18:45] park you had it in your mind
[18:47] and you kept working that vision out
[18:49] that's the way god did about the world
[18:51] he worked it was in his mind
[18:55] so creation is god's eternal thoughts
[18:57] that are now unfolding
[18:59] and god is designing something he says
[19:01] just like you brothers who designed this
[19:03] park
[19:04] it's first in your mind and so god is a
[19:06] designer
[19:08] god is the master of all intelligence
[19:10] and so he's using his
[19:11] his intelligence now to create god has
[19:14] this in his mind
[19:15] i'm wanting to create the world and he's
[19:17] using his intelligence the master of all
[19:19] intelligence now begins to design
[19:22] creation
[19:22] he has a vision in doing so
[19:26] and in the in the sumerian church age
[19:30] this is a chapter four now just follow
[19:32] me as we read through this
[19:35] he says the eternal thoughts of god so
[19:37] now he gets us thinking about god's
[19:40] thought god's thoughts let me ask you
[19:41] are the thoughts of god eternal
[19:44] and then he says if you can see this
[19:47] you will see many things
[19:50] now that's powerful now he's saying if
[19:53] you can see
[19:54] this you can see many things this has so
[19:57] much depth
[19:58] maybe in some ways i'm just going to
[19:59] amplify this statement for the rest of
[20:01] the day
[20:02] and make it very rest of the day you've
[20:03] been put on notice
[20:05] rest of the service ah he says if you
[20:08] can see this you will see many things so
[20:11] make this personal
[20:13] are the thoughts of god eternal if you
[20:15] can see the answer
[20:16] you can see many things she says god is
[20:19] unchangeable
[20:20] in both essence and behavior oh i love
[20:23] that
[20:24] god is unchangeable in his essence and
[20:26] in his actions
[20:28] god is unchangeable in his his very
[20:29] character and he's therefore
[20:31] unchangeable in how he acts his behavior
[20:34] because your behavior is aligned with
[20:36] character god is not a hypocrite
[20:38] we have studied that and proven that
[20:40] already god is
[20:41] infinite in his abilities so therefore
[20:43] he as god must be
[20:45] omniscient so it that's a very um
[20:48] interesting connection brother branham
[20:50] connects his infinite abilities with his
[20:52] infinite knowledge
[20:54] so he with his infinite knowledge comes
[20:56] infinite skill
[20:58] and so he says we've already proved that
[21:00] already in this church age but god is
[21:02] infinite in his abilities
[21:03] and therefore he is omniscient he says
[21:06] if he is
[21:07] omniscient then he is not now learning
[21:10] nor is he taking counsel even with
[21:12] himself
[21:14] nor is he at any time adding to his
[21:16] knowledge if he can
[21:17] to his knowledge if he can add to his
[21:19] knowledge then he's not omniscient
[21:21] the best way we could say is that
[21:23] sometime the best we can say is that
[21:25] sometimes he will be
[21:27] but that is not scriptural he is
[21:29] omniscient
[21:31] so god is omniscient he's all-knowing
[21:35] and that he's and even though it may
[21:37] look like god learns he does not learn
[21:40] although it may look like god takes
[21:42] counsel and he responds
[21:44] to to to mankind in a way to where it
[21:46] looks as if he's been apprised of new
[21:48] information
[21:48] therefore he's changing his behavior oh
[21:50] i'm going to destroy him all moses is
[21:52] like no no don't do it he stands in the
[21:53] gap god says okay
[21:54] never mind i'm going to change my mind
[21:57] no god
[21:58] did not know that moses was going to do
[22:00] that
[22:01] and was surprised god god knows all
[22:04] things and god acts even to bring things
[22:06] out of us not for his benefit
[22:08] do you realize the test isn't so that
[22:10] god knows where you are the test is so
[22:12] that you find out where you are
[22:14] so god administers the test sometimes
[22:17] listen not as retribution not as
[22:19] payment not as reprimand not as
[22:21] correction
[22:22] but he he gives a test so that you can
[22:25] understand where you are and many times
[22:28] we're ungrateful for the test but we
[22:30] pass it and god's like i just wanted you
[22:32] to know you had it in you
[22:34] and we're lamenting the test we're all
[22:36] upset i gotta take this test oh my
[22:37] goodness i gotta take this test do i
[22:39] sound like you guys yet
[22:41] why do i have to take this quiz why do i
[22:43] have to take this test
[22:44] well our sc our teachers in the natural
[22:46] need to know where we're at
[22:48] but our teacher in the supernatural
[22:50] knows exactly where we're at and he's
[22:51] trying to bring something out of us and
[22:53] the test
[22:54] is assurance to us that we're in his
[22:57] hand
[22:58] not to him he won't lose you he knows
[22:59] exactly where you are
[23:01] so he says this now he has never had a
[23:04] new thought
[23:05] about anything because all his thoughts
[23:08] he has all
[23:09] has all because all his thoughts
[23:12] he has always i'm going to have a
[23:13] conversation with brother level when i
[23:14] get a chance
[23:16] it can be pretty worthy because all his
[23:18] thoughts he has always had
[23:20] and always will have and knows the end
[23:22] from the beginning because he is god
[23:25] thus the thoughts of god are eternal
[23:29] they are real
[23:33] if you can see this you will see many
[23:35] things
[23:37] if you can see this you will see many
[23:40] things am i the only one getting
[23:41] goosebumps
[23:42] this is powerful i've been studying on
[23:45] this for for months now and it just
[23:46] keeps getting
[23:47] deeper and deeper than i begin to preach
[23:49] i'm like i was in the kiddie pool when i
[23:50] was studying
[23:52] because you bring me out into deeper
[23:54] waters and he's saying look if you can
[23:55] see this you will see many things
[23:57] the thoughts of god are eternal they are
[24:01] real oh god let me see that
[24:04] let me really understand that and
[24:06] comprehend that he says they are
[24:08] not simply like a man with the blueprint
[24:10] he has drawn up
[24:11] which one day will be translated into
[24:13] substance and form
[24:15] but they are already real and eternal
[24:18] and
[24:18] a part of god
[24:21] our thoughts can be fleeting we can have
[24:24] a thought and won't be able to get it
[24:25] back
[24:26] i can't tell you how many times i'm
[24:28] right in the middle of a sentence and my
[24:29] mind
[24:30] leaves and i walk away and elizabeth's
[24:32] like are you going to finish that
[24:34] you're going to finish that statement
[24:35] i'm like where was it what was i saying
[24:37] our thoughts can just immediately be
[24:39] interrupted and it's on pause you can't
[24:41] remember what was i saying what was i
[24:42] talking about
[24:43] and we can't even find our way back to
[24:44] that god's thoughts aren't like that
[24:47] you could even put ours you could even
[24:49] describe man in such a way
[24:51] to where he's not a thought generator
[24:53] he's a thought receptor
[24:54] and brother tim dodd taught on that one
[24:56] time at the men's meeting how that we're
[24:58] not
[24:58] uh in essence thought generators were
[25:01] thought receptors so we receive thoughts
[25:03] but god is a thought generator god is
[25:06] the originator of thinking god's the
[25:07] originator of intelligence god's the
[25:09] originator wisdom and knowledge and
[25:10] understanding
[25:11] and his thoughts are eternal and they
[25:14] are real
[25:15] they're not like those guys who built
[25:17] the park and prescott where they said we
[25:18] got an idea we can level the land here
[25:20] and got blueprints laid out and you look
[25:22] at the blueprints and you can begin to
[25:24] understand that's what it might be
[25:25] that's what it might be but it's not
[25:26] real
[25:27] until you put up the structures until
[25:29] they're finished out god's not like that
[25:31] his thoughts already have in
[25:34] some dimension in some quality substance
[25:37] and form
[25:39] because he says they're not like a man
[25:40] with this blueprint they'll one day
[25:42] become substance and form
[25:43] but they are already real have some
[25:46] divine quality divine substance
[25:48] and are already eternal therefore has
[25:51] divine it's
[25:52] in essence it is they are divine and he
[25:54] says a part of god you cannot
[25:56] separate the thoughts of god from god
[26:00] my this is wonderful jeremiah chapter 10
[26:03] verses 12 to 13.
[26:07] now we read
[26:11] verses 10 and 11
[26:14] and he's talking about the gods who have
[26:17] not made the heavens and the earth were
[26:18] will perish now what distinguishes those
[26:22] gods
[26:22] who cannot create from the god who can
[26:25] create
[26:26] he says he hath made the earth by his
[26:29] power
[26:30] and he has established the world by his
[26:32] wisdom
[26:33] and have stretched out the heavens by
[26:35] his discretion
[26:37] those are very uh beautiful words god's
[26:41] power and wisdom are manifested in his
[26:44] creating
[26:45] and establishing the order of all things
[26:48] he's made the earth by his power then
[26:50] he's established the world by
[26:52] his wisdom stretched out the heavens by
[26:54] his discretion
[26:55] so where they are where the stars are
[26:57] where the galaxies are wherever
[26:58] it's his discretion why is pluto where
[27:02] it is
[27:02] god's discretion why does haley's
[27:05] comment come around
[27:06] every so often however many years it is
[27:09] sorry i don't have
[27:10] i don't have that memorized 800
[27:12] something years i don't know
[27:13] 78 years thank you john that's why i
[27:16] have him on the front row he's supposed
[27:17] to be my data guy
[27:18] i say oh okay brother john how many
[27:20] years does haley's comment come around
[27:23] it's time perfectly isn't it amazing
[27:26] whenever we have an eclipse they'll say
[27:27] you're not going to have one like this
[27:28] for another 378 days 12 hours and 30
[27:31] seconds
[27:32] because they know that's exactly what
[27:34] it's going to be and they can tell you
[27:35] the best place to be on earth to see it
[27:38] you need to be in topeka kansas at 1 32
[27:40] p.m on october 12th
[27:42] because that's going to be the peak
[27:44] because it god with at his discretion
[27:46] lined all these things up there's a
[27:49] power that holds them there there's a
[27:50] discretion that's put them there
[27:52] and mankind is science is in all by the
[27:54] magnitude of it
[27:56] and they become more in all of their the
[27:58] fact that they discovered it
[28:01] then the reality of the power that did
[28:03] it
[28:04] how could chance do this how could
[28:07] something of this magnitude not be
[28:08] coming from something that used
[28:10] discretion
[28:12] to even look at the moon and science
[28:13] could tell you man if that moon was this
[28:15] far out of this way or this far that way
[28:16] we wouldn't even have a habitable earth
[28:18] what does it believe brother jason
[28:20] watkins one time preached a sermon like
[28:21] this
[28:22] zone that the earth is in if it varied
[28:24] every so slightly
[28:25] you would not have life but yet here we
[28:29] are
[28:30] because god used his discretion to place
[28:32] the earth in just
[28:33] the right zone with all the other
[28:36] planets
[28:37] in their rotations and in their place
[28:39] every star
[28:40] every planet everything in this galaxy
[28:42] has was part of god's discretion because
[28:44] he says
[28:45] this is what it'll take for life to come
[28:47] and to be sustained
[28:50] he made the earth by his power he
[28:51] established the world by his wisdom
[28:52] stretched out the heavens by his
[28:53] discretion
[28:54] when he uttereth his voice there's a
[28:56] multitude of waters in the heavens and
[28:58] he causes the vapors to ascend from the
[29:00] ends of the earth you can even see this
[29:01] as being descriptive of a creation
[29:02] itself he maketh lightnings with rain
[29:04] and bringeth forth the wind
[29:06] out of his treasures he utters his voice
[29:10] his voice declares his will it declares
[29:12] his intent it's now an expression
[29:15] of this power it's an expression of this
[29:18] wisdom
[29:18] it's an expression of his discretion
[29:22] and as he used his power in wisdom and
[29:24] he stretched out stretches out the
[29:26] heavens by his discretion
[29:27] this this is another key thing we talked
[29:29] we've mentioned intelligence creation
[29:32] has it's thought driven it's purpose
[29:36] focused
[29:37] it's knowledge based you have elohim the
[29:39] architect
[29:41] and it's it's there's an intelligence to
[29:43] it these are things i'm wanting you just
[29:44] to grab a hold of there's an
[29:45] intelligence to it
[29:46] and this intelligence these thoughts
[29:48] that he generates are real and they are
[29:50] eternal
[29:51] they have eternal substance eternal
[29:53] qualities they're a part of god
[29:54] now he makes earth by his power he
[29:56] establishes the world by his wisdom he's
[29:58] stretching out the heavens by his
[29:59] discretion
[30:00] and he brings these things out of his
[30:02] treasures out of his storehouse god
[30:03] brings them forth when as before you
[30:05] wouldn't have seen them or known them
[30:08] what i want you to see now is that god
[30:10] is establishing a track
[30:13] that is god begins to create there
[30:15] there's it's not an
[30:16] in many unknown variables there's not
[30:18] alternative realities
[30:20] there's not these parallel dimensions
[30:22] that if this would have happened
[30:24] this is what would take place and if
[30:25] that would have happened this would have
[30:26] taken place
[30:27] and so god actually has billions of
[30:29] monitors saying
[30:30] well this is oh this is the life if
[30:32] brother aaron hadn't gone to law school
[30:34] oh and this is the life if he never got
[30:36] married no god
[30:37] god sets things on a track i want you to
[30:40] think about that there's a track
[30:42] he establishes the path and he does this
[30:45] even the language of the proverb says
[30:47] he puts the the stars and the suns and
[30:49] the moon in their circuits
[30:51] so when we look in the heavens they have
[30:53] a rotational path they have a
[30:55] uh they they have a um they have these
[30:58] uh very clear patterns and paths that
[31:00] they follow
[31:07] i had to take a drink just remember the
[31:09] word orbit
[31:11] there's an orbit to it it's almost as if
[31:14] it's a predetermined path
[31:17] and you know where it's going to be and
[31:20] so god then he's telling us something in
[31:22] his creation
[31:23] he sets tracks he sets trajectory he
[31:26] sets a path
[31:27] so god is establishing by power by
[31:29] wisdom by discretion the trail
[31:32] that this creation would follow
[31:36] he determines it he can take something
[31:39] to go
[31:41] and just let it spin out and he's
[31:43] determined that he'll let it spin
[31:46] until it reaches the destination that he
[31:48] wants it to be
[31:49] and he says stop
[31:52] and he determines its path that he takes
[31:54] something and
[31:56] if boy if you could just put yourself in
[31:57] this god establishes
[31:59] establishes everything with weight with
[32:01] gravity with force with power
[32:04] with characteristics with essence and
[32:06] then he places you
[32:08] in this universe he places you inside of
[32:10] this creation
[32:11] and he sets it all in motion he says
[32:13] it's going to have a track
[32:16] and it's going to follow this path and
[32:18] what it was in the beginning i have a
[32:20] path that it's going to follow and i
[32:22] know exactly where it's going to be in
[32:23] the end
[32:25] because he's established the path he's
[32:27] put the power in it he's put the wisdom
[32:29] in it he stretched it out by his
[32:30] discretion
[32:31] god has established a trail he's
[32:34] established a path that creation will
[32:36] follow according to his
[32:37] own determinant counsel and will
[32:42] it's his power and wisdom
[32:47] that create the heavens and the earth
[32:51] and his power and wisdom are manifested
[32:53] in his divine order
[32:55] and use how he uses all things how he
[32:57] arranges them and uses them
[33:02] first corinthians chapter 1 verse 24.
[33:06] he made the earth by his power he
[33:08] established the world by his wisdom
[33:12] but unto them which are called paul
[33:13] talked about the gospel that is preached
[33:15] he preaches jesus christ and
[33:17] there's some that think it's this some
[33:18] that think it's that but
[33:20] in the context of this he's declaring
[33:22] who he's preaching but notice the
[33:23] characteristics that he assigns christ
[33:26] who he preaches unto them which are
[33:28] called both jews in greek
[33:30] christ the power of god and the wisdom
[33:33] of god
[33:35] so christ is the power of god and he is
[33:39] the wisdom of god so what he's setting
[33:42] forth now
[33:43] if we take this principle that out of
[33:45] context remains true
[33:46] if you just if we disregarded the
[33:48] context within which paul is preaching
[33:50] it
[33:51] this principle stands true christ is the
[33:54] power of god
[33:55] christ is the wisdom of god and we
[33:57] referenced
[33:58] last week or the week before brother man
[34:00] says when you read in the beginning god
[34:02] created
[34:03] he says there is christ so he made the
[34:06] earth by his power
[34:08] he established the world by his wisdom
[34:10] to him by that by wisdom
[34:12] made the heavens the lord by wisdom
[34:14] founded the earth by understanding he
[34:16] established the heavens
[34:17] and now paul says christ is the wisdom
[34:19] of god
[34:20] christ is the power of god so he hath
[34:22] made the earth by christ he has
[34:24] established the world
[34:25] by christ he stretched out the heavens
[34:27] by christ because
[34:28] in the beginning when you read god
[34:30] created there is christ
[34:33] that's the revelation that john has john
[34:35] 1 1 in the beginning was
[34:36] the word right it's christ the logos
[34:40] that came out of god
[34:41] it is an expression of god and this is
[34:44] then go in the beginning is the word
[34:45] logos it's the thought
[34:48] it's the intelligence of god so god's
[34:52] intelligence god's person
[34:54] made expressed in the logos god god
[34:57] is manifested in christ he hath made the
[34:59] earth by his power he has established
[35:01] the world by his wisdom
[35:02] it's represented in christ who is the
[35:04] power and wisdom of god
[35:07] so in the beginning was the word there's
[35:09] christ
[35:10] in the beginning god created the heavens
[35:12] and the earth there's christ
[35:14] can we see that now
[35:21] see do you like that little icon there
[35:23] it tells you it's in the bible
[35:26] you never know who's visiting
[35:30] and so genesis chapter 1 verse 27 this
[35:34] is where i hope to make a turn
[35:36] and begin to hopefully i pick up a
[35:38] little bit more pace you need to pull
[35:39] harder the harder you pull the faster i
[35:40] preach
[35:41] genesis chapter 1 verse 27 so god
[35:44] created now if he creates what is an
[35:46] expression of
[35:47] intelligence wisdom power
[35:50] knowledge skill understanding discretion
[35:53] so god's not just going to create man
[35:56] without using wisdom and skill
[35:58] he's not going to do it without being
[36:00] thought driven
[36:02] and purpose focused and knowledge based
[36:06] and so this is something god the master
[36:08] of all intelligence is now bringing
[36:09] forth
[36:10] man so god created man and he uses his
[36:13] own
[36:13] image so god when he created man his
[36:17] template
[36:18] is his own image in the image of god
[36:20] created he him
[36:22] so we can say definitively according to
[36:23] scripture without any ambiguity
[36:25] that man was created with discretion
[36:28] skill and understanding god
[36:29] as he created was using his wisdom his
[36:32] skill his understanding his knowledge
[36:34] his intelligence to make man in
[36:37] his own image this was a god had a
[36:40] purpose in doing so
[36:42] so he makes man in his own image he
[36:44] creates him male and female
[36:45] excuse me he creates him in his image
[36:47] creating him and he says in male
[36:49] and female created he them
[36:52] now do we cannot read this scripture to
[36:55] imply
[36:56] that on one hand he made him in god's
[36:58] image but in the other
[36:59] he made him male and female that the
[37:02] scripture is not making this dichotomy
[37:04] within man
[37:04] then in one hand he has this godly
[37:07] divine attributes and he's
[37:08] representative of deity but then he has
[37:10] this other part where he makes a male
[37:11] and female
[37:12] and it's somehow some kind of separate
[37:14] creation in this instance
[37:17] something less something humanity-based
[37:20] but he's actually saying he made man in
[37:22] the image of god
[37:23] and being in the image of god there was
[37:26] a representation or
[37:27] designation of both male and female in
[37:29] the man
[37:32] listen because god as a he's not this
[37:35] egomaniac he's not a narcissist we god
[37:38] in the beginning when he had thoughts
[37:39] it wasn't just all about himself
[37:42] me me me me me me
[37:46] when you have a language for someone
[37:47] else it would only be i i
[37:50] but the i am had something else in there
[37:54] the i am had thoughts of someone else
[37:56] something else
[37:57] so if this is god now when he says he
[37:59] created him in his own image and the
[38:01] image of god created him male and female
[38:03] created them
[38:04] then there's a representation of god
[38:06] that is male and female
[38:08] and then brother branham says in
[38:09] marriage and divorce god has
[38:12] male and female now go back to and
[38:15] read this in the context of marriage and
[38:17] divorce brother branham and this is
[38:19] where
[38:20] i i'm i'm i'm not going to be able to
[38:22] finish the sermon this morning and i'm
[38:24] hopeful that we can
[38:25] i'll pick it back up next sunday morning
[38:28] and and maybe some of these details we
[38:29] can bring out and greater clarity
[38:32] brother when he preaches marriage and
[38:33] divorce he's bringing a very
[38:35] a very rich a very even difficult
[38:38] revelation
[38:39] where he's shown you what the woman was
[38:41] in the beginning
[38:43] and how the god made her by his own
[38:45] design
[38:46] in a particular way to fulfill his
[38:48] purpose
[38:49] and so as he's talking about male and
[38:50] female and the woman how she came out of
[38:52] man she's not part of the original
[38:53] creation
[38:54] he makes this statement and and if it
[38:57] feels like i'm taking it out of context
[38:58] you can find it in the table or the
[39:00] message hub
[39:02] and look this up he says god has male
[39:04] and female
[39:05] and when he says it he's wanting you to
[39:06] understand that he does have that
[39:10] even if you see the woman as a
[39:12] perversion or even if you see the woman
[39:13] playing the part of a harlot
[39:15] even if you see this the role that she
[39:17] played in the fall of mankind
[39:19] we can't associate that part with his
[39:21] part he says god
[39:22] has male and female he's assigning this
[39:25] these designations to the eternal god
[39:28] amen elohim the architect was not just
[39:31] male but he also has representation male
[39:33] and female
[39:34] and i believe this is important for us
[39:36] to understand this
[39:38] because we see christ as
[39:41] as being one with the father and we see
[39:43] the expression of the son
[39:46] and we we he is so one with the father
[39:48] that when you've seen me you've seen the
[39:49] father
[39:50] and that god has oneness with his son
[39:53] and we see the the son
[39:54] father son and the language and the
[39:56] attributes of the oneness
[39:58] and we can get in our mind this that god
[40:00] in his oneness now
[40:01] is the invisible god now made manifest
[40:03] in his son there's the godhead there's
[40:05] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[40:07] and this is what we look at and it's
[40:08] male and distinction male and
[40:10] designation
[40:11] and it's all christ who is in the image
[40:13] of the invisible god
[40:15] and now we as peons we as humans we
[40:18] as wretched sinners now somehow have to
[40:20] plead to the mercy of this one that he
[40:23] would not cast us into hell
[40:24] and when he has not cast us into hell oh
[40:26] we have this privilege and this benefit
[40:28] of judgment being stayed for all
[40:30] eternity because he had mercy on us
[40:32] once we cried unto him for salvation
[40:37] i know there might be some that there's
[40:39] there's a language we're using there
[40:40] that expresses some truth
[40:42] if you if you don't see this you won't
[40:45] see everything
[40:47] but if you can see this you will see
[40:49] many things
[40:51] right if you can see that his thoughts
[40:53] are eternal and they are real
[40:55] if you can see that you will see many
[40:57] things so there is a
[40:59] hidden designation of god as it begins
[41:01] to create
[41:03] there is another part of his power and
[41:05] wisdom it says christ is the power of
[41:06] god
[41:07] christ is the wisdom of god so he hath
[41:09] made the earth by christ
[41:10] he's established the world by christ he
[41:12] stretched out the heavens
[41:14] by christ because christ is the power
[41:16] and the wisdom of god
[41:18] but there's a hidden designation of
[41:21] christ
[41:22] there's a there's another part or
[41:24] unfolding another fold
[41:25] of this power and wisdom brother brandon
[41:28] makes this statement and knoweth it not
[41:30] in the beginning of creation of god in
[41:32] the beginning of the creation of god
[41:33] when god began to create
[41:36] and bring you into existence
[41:39] so when god began to create he was
[41:42] bringing you into existence
[41:43] he said well brother aaron i believe
[41:45] according to science that the world is
[41:46] 6.9 billion years old
[41:48] and i didn't come to be in the except in
[41:50] the last 26 years
[41:52] so how was it i was being brought into
[41:53] existence when that began
[41:55] is because god had intelligence god had
[41:58] purpose
[41:59] god had a design and so he began to
[42:01] bring you into existence from the very
[42:03] moment he came into a being
[42:05] the very moment that god became an
[42:07] object of worship from the very time
[42:08] that the i am formed himself into the
[42:10] logos and became christ when he began to
[42:12] bring
[42:12] you into existence he says you started
[42:14] back there as a seed
[42:16] and worked down to where you are now and
[42:18] then you were
[42:19] all in christ then when christ died he
[42:22] died to redeem
[42:23] all of you and you are a part of this
[42:26] word so now when we look at christ
[42:30] we can't look at him as separate from
[42:32] you who are in christ you cannot look at
[42:34] him as a separate
[42:35] entity a separate person that you do not
[42:37] have fellowship with continuity with
[42:39] uh uh uh inheritance with
[42:43] oneness with the bible uses a language
[42:47] for us to be so
[42:48] tied to him and connected with him that
[42:50] we would never put ourselves in one
[42:51] category in him in another
[42:53] he's saying that when creation began you
[42:56] had your genesis
[42:57] then you begin to come into identity you
[43:00] begin to come into expression
[43:02] because you were in christ who is the
[43:04] wisdom and power of god you were in
[43:06] christ at that time he says you are part
[43:08] of
[43:09] this word
[43:12] now
[43:16] brother branham says in the beginning
[43:18] was the word according john 1
[43:20] and the word was with god and the word
[43:21] was god and the word was made flesh and
[43:23] dwelt
[43:24] dwelt among us he goes may i break it
[43:26] down
[43:27] yes you may i'm never going to say no to
[43:31] that brother brandon please
[43:32] as a matter of fact please i wish he
[43:34] said this more often may i break it down
[43:36] for you
[43:37] and and the music stops and he's going
[43:40] to break it down for you
[43:41] in the beginning was the eternal he
[43:43] wasn't even
[43:44] god god our english word god is an
[43:47] object of worship
[43:49] but he he there was nothing to worship
[43:52] him he's breaking it down now because
[43:54] all you have is elohim
[43:56] the eternal one he's not even god as an
[43:59] object of worship
[44:00] so now he says he was just eternal
[44:04] in him was attributes and so
[44:07] now i'm going to skip some and i put the
[44:09] uh that there just so you understand
[44:10] that i'm going to
[44:11] i'm going to skip a portion of this in
[44:13] other words in him was his
[44:15] thoughts just thoughts that's his
[44:17] attributes
[44:18] so he's eternal and he has attributes
[44:20] and these attributes are his thoughts
[44:23] then his word and a thought expressed is
[44:26] a word
[44:27] in the beginning was the word before it
[44:29] was even expressed it was a thought
[44:31] attributes
[44:32] in his thinking he was to be god so you
[44:34] go all the way back
[44:35] you have god dwelling along with his
[44:37] thoughts those thoughts are attributes
[44:39] once they're spoken it becomes word he
[44:42] said i'm breaking this down in the
[44:44] beginning was the word
[44:46] and they originally were thoughts in him
[44:48] he was to be god so he says probably
[44:54] probably created the angels first then
[44:57] he was worshiped
[44:58] he was god and then in him was
[45:00] attributes to be father to be son
[45:02] be savior nothing lost something had to
[45:04] be lost so there had to be a way made
[45:07] for that
[45:09] now do you understand how purposeful he
[45:11] was with creation
[45:12] because there's a paradox to it let's
[45:14] just all admit it god creates a perfect
[45:16] eden
[45:16] and then he takes the woman and just
[45:18] puts her in a little bit different
[45:20] position
[45:21] so that she can be tempted and fall and
[45:24] we've said it a number of times already
[45:26] god was not frustrated as if he was
[45:29] caught by surprise when it happened
[45:31] he wanted to manifest all his attributes
[45:33] so he he had to be there had to be
[45:35] someone lost for that to happen to be
[45:36] healer there was nothing sick so he had
[45:38] to have something
[45:38] had to get sick so he could heal it it's
[45:41] only displaying
[45:42] his attributes so then god had a path
[45:46] god had a plan so that all of his
[45:48] attributes could be
[45:49] expressed he says and now remember
[45:52] so now god has attributes of healer
[45:55] father savior redeemer
[45:57] but now this is just not attributes of
[45:59] god that are disconnected from you
[46:01] he says and now remember if you ever did
[46:03] or ever will have eternal life
[46:05] you had it with him then
[46:09] you had it with him then see you had it
[46:11] with him because
[46:12] jesus came and jesus was the redeemer
[46:16] to redeem anything is bring it back from
[46:19] where it fallen from or went from redeem
[46:21] it bring it back
[46:23] so the the very m the very use of the
[46:26] word redemption implies some prior state
[46:30] some prior position some prior quality
[46:33] redeemings to bring it back and you the
[46:35] way you look who you are who you
[46:37] who your name what your name is that was
[46:39] god's thinking
[46:41] before the foundation of the world
[46:45] and jesus came not to save the whole
[46:48] thing
[46:50] he wanted to but he
[46:53] come to redeem bring back them that was
[46:56] in his thoughts
[46:57] before the beginning if you can see this
[47:02] you will see many things he doesn't even
[47:04] say you can
[47:06] if you can see this you will see
[47:09] many things just like jesus told him he
[47:12] says
[47:12] if thou believe is this then you'll see
[47:15] greater things
[47:17] you really believe this is of god you
[47:19] shall see greater things if you can see
[47:21] this
[47:21] you will see many things so redemption
[47:25] is to bring back that which was lost so
[47:26] he says jesus came not to save the whole
[47:28] thing
[47:28] whole cosmos the whole record of the
[47:30] wheat plant he wanted to
[47:32] but he came to redeem to redeem back
[47:34] those that were in
[47:35] god's thoughts before the beginning
[47:39] and so this is
[47:42] this is what has just been reverberating
[47:44] over in my mind if you think by the end
[47:46] you just keep you keep
[47:47] uh you just keep treading the same
[47:48] ground we have to stop
[47:51] thinking the wrong way
[47:54] and we have to stop thinking in the
[47:56] realm of chance
[47:58] in the realm of coincidence brother luke
[48:01] told me lucas told me this morning he
[48:02] says you know
[48:03] like two years ago he went on a like
[48:05] just a buying binge
[48:07] my words where he bought all sorts of
[48:09] technology and things and it's just been
[48:11] collecting dust until we needed it
[48:15] so you go back two years ago why did he
[48:17] have an inkling to buy tripod that nice
[48:20] you're gonna have need for it one day
[48:22] and so it's important for us to realize
[48:24] god's the master of all intelligence
[48:27] god's the architect and engineer of your
[48:29] life
[48:30] even if you seem to get a little bit out
[48:31] of step god knows he can use that
[48:35] oh i thank god he can use my
[48:37] stubbornness
[48:38] he can use my waywardness he could use
[48:40] all of my doubt
[48:41] because god as a great designer as the
[48:44] great architect
[48:45] no if i was going too far he'd say stop
[48:50] why he kept me within a certain pound he
[48:53] kept me in his grace
[48:54] as we've been preaching on wednesday
[48:55] night the man fell from jerusalem
[48:57] on his way to jericho but god knows how
[49:00] to use a gang of thieves
[49:01] to stop you before you get to jericho
[49:04] that's not your destiny
[49:06] so we have to stop thinking outside of
[49:08] the realm of chance and coincidence
[49:10] that's why he says i use all things
[49:12] that's right but but i did this
[49:14] all things but i did that all things he
[49:17] works all things together
[49:19] for the good to the called
[49:22] according to what his purpose
[49:27] so let's get out of the realm of
[49:28] coincidence happenstance
[49:30] chance and let's just surrender to his
[49:34] purpose
[49:36] yield just yield to his design
[49:40] whatever your design is lord i'm at your
[49:43] mercy
[49:45] put me on your will lord turn me around
[49:49] lord if you see anything just water it
[49:51] get those strains out if you have to
[49:53] break me
[49:53] break me down because you're going to
[49:54] making something he's making as the song
[49:56] says
[49:57] he'll make something good out of dust
[49:59] how because he's the great master of all
[50:01] intelligence
[50:03] romans 9 11
[50:07] he says this notice i'm just wanting to
[50:10] use these scriptures to get us thinking
[50:11] to surrender to his purpose he chose
[50:14] jacob
[50:15] rejected esau that the purpose of god
[50:18] according to election
[50:19] might stand so the purpose of god is
[50:22] according to election god be an
[50:24] omniscient god being
[50:25] a knowledge based this is something that
[50:29] god
[50:29] in his mind the purpose of god is
[50:31] according to election
[50:32] or election works to serve his purpose
[50:35] to fulfill
[50:36] his purpose ii timothy 1 9 who hath
[50:40] saved us and called us with a holy
[50:41] calling
[50:42] not according to our works but according
[50:44] to his own purpose and grace
[50:47] so we are saved and called our calling
[50:49] is a holy calling
[50:50] but it's not according to what you did
[50:53] since you were born anything you've done
[50:56] in the last 36 years nothing you've done
[50:58] in the last 12 years
[50:59] it's not anything you've done but it's
[51:01] according to his own purpose and grace
[51:03] which was given us
[51:07] in christ jesus before the world begin
[51:12] the phrase there is in eternity so you
[51:14] received it
[51:15] in christ in eternity
[51:19] before there was time you had received a
[51:21] holy calling
[51:22] according to his purpose
[51:25] before there was creation you were in
[51:27] christ and received the holy calling
[51:30] christ is the power of god christ is the
[51:32] wisdom of god
[51:33] you are a part of that christ you
[51:35] receive something in christ
[51:37] before the foundation of the world
[51:40] in ephesians 1 4 according he have
[51:43] chosen us
[51:44] in him when were we chosen before the
[51:46] foundational world where
[51:48] in christ so when you see christ you
[51:50] have to see yourself
[51:53] i started searching through the message
[51:55] surely brother branham said somewhere
[51:57] that if you have to see christ in every
[51:59] verse you have to see yourself in every
[52:00] verse
[52:03] right it tells a story about put put my
[52:05] name in there
[52:07] and you read it and you put your name in
[52:08] there this is this is something that
[52:11] we are that we we can accept now to see
[52:14] we were in christ therefore if a
[52:16] scripture speaks of christ it speaks of
[52:18] me
[52:20] brother adam before he preaches christ
[52:22] is a mystery god revealed he's referring
[52:24] to what he's going to preach in a sermon
[52:26] prior to it and he says the threefold
[52:29] purpose of god's great plan
[52:31] since before the foundation of the world
[52:33] jesus said what he wants to preach on
[52:34] the threefold purpose of god's great
[52:36] plan
[52:37] since before the foundation of the world
[52:38] so god had a great plan
[52:41] and it had three folds when did he have
[52:43] this plan
[52:44] before the foundational world not after
[52:47] the woman fell in sin
[52:50] he didn't say i'm glad i had a plan b no
[52:53] he had a threefold plan before the
[52:56] foundation of the world
[52:57] and brother branson says i want to bring
[52:59] it down to today
[53:01] the threefold plan of god the plan
[53:05] so really if if god needed a trademark
[53:09] he would have trademarked the process
[53:12] before the 76ers did or
[53:15] embed or whoever it was that trademarked
[53:18] it he had a process before
[53:19] we even had a language for it he had a
[53:21] plan the threefold purpose of god's
[53:23] great plan
[53:24] his great plan was initiated by his
[53:26] thoughts and his thinking this master of
[53:28] all intelligence
[53:29] had a three-fold plan so now in
[53:32] in christ is the mystery god revealed
[53:36] he says notice god has had a threefold
[53:38] purpose
[53:39] in this great mystery secret so
[53:42] great mystery secret has three a
[53:44] threefold purpose
[53:46] or there's a three three folds that
[53:48] fulfill god's purpose
[53:50] god in his great mystery secret that he
[53:52] had before the world began
[53:54] he got a threefold purpose in it
[53:57] so there's there's a purpose that has
[53:59] three folds
[54:00] or there's a three purposes that are
[54:02] ultimately going to reveal
[54:03] his great secret or bring it to pass or
[54:05] manifest it
[54:07] so god has a threefold purpose we're
[54:09] very familiar with those scriptures
[54:12] and the scriptures he uses of that
[54:13] sermon romans chapter 16 verses 25 to
[54:16] 27.
[54:18] and if i can i just go real fast and you
[54:20] can go back later and you can just do it
[54:21] on slower speed so i can finish
[54:23] now to him that is of power to establish
[54:25] you according to my gospel
[54:27] and the preaching of jesus christ
[54:29] according to the revelation of the
[54:31] mystery which was kept secret since the
[54:33] world begin
[54:34] so now there's a power to establish he's
[54:37] preaching jesus christ
[54:38] and by preaching jesus christ he's
[54:40] bringing a revelation of the mystery
[54:42] that had been
[54:43] secret since the world began so though
[54:45] you had thousands of years of creation
[54:49] and old testament prophets and sages and
[54:51] characters of the old testament
[54:53] they were all giving glimpse or
[54:54] foreshadowing who
[54:56] christ because when christ came now the
[54:58] mystery of god
[55:00] is being revealed the mystery god was
[55:02] used in type and symbol and
[55:04] and different foreshadowings but now
[55:06] christ is the manifestation of the
[55:08] secret which had been kept
[55:09] since he formed himself into logos since
[55:11] he said let there be
[55:12] it had all been come into this place
[55:14] that when christ was made manifest
[55:17] you could see that the first fold of
[55:19] god's threefold purpose is coming into
[55:21] being
[55:22] so he says but now is made manifest why
[55:24] because jesus christ the first fold of
[55:26] that purpose had come
[55:27] and by scripture the prophets according
[55:29] to the commandment of the everlasting
[55:30] god
[55:31] made known to all nations for the
[55:33] obedience of faith to god
[55:34] only wise or to the only wise god be
[55:36] glory through jesus christ
[55:38] forever amen paul is established
[55:41] so beautifully through scripture that
[55:43] jesus christ is the firstfold
[55:45] manifestation
[55:46] of the threefold purpose of god
[55:50] and it's when does it come it comes it
[55:52] to us in the middle of the book
[55:55] why because god hides these things
[55:58] uh and and next sunday lord willing
[56:02] and maybe i'll just bring it into view
[56:03] now satan was watching
[56:07] and and was watching trying to guess and
[56:10] you can see that satan had some idea
[56:13] of god's plan because where he
[56:15] intersects and where he attacks
[56:20] and the message future home he says now
[56:23] in the beginning was the word and the
[56:24] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[56:26] the three stages it was attribute
[56:30] first was in god and he thought of
[56:32] himself
[56:33] as a being human and that transmitted
[56:37] him down to be jesus so in these stages
[56:40] god had a thought of him being human
[56:43] and then that transmitted not in adam
[56:46] but in jesus
[56:48] adam was a living soul christ is a
[56:51] quickening spirit now there's a
[56:52] difference then
[56:53] and so in christ do we see the the
[56:55] godhead bodily in christ is the fullness
[56:57] of god
[56:58] dwelling so he says and so so now he's
[57:01] unfolding himself
[57:02] to jesus he says that now if you'll ever
[57:05] be there
[57:07] wherever there is eternity
[57:10] in him in the body of christ in the
[57:13] rapture
[57:16] sitting with christ judging at white
[57:18] throne in the new jerusalem
[57:20] if you'll ever be there you was with him
[57:22] then
[57:24] for there's only one form of eternal
[57:25] life that's god and you had to be a part
[57:28] of god
[57:28] at the beginning not what you chose down
[57:32] here
[57:32] he chose you
[57:38] oh god help us if we ever let that
[57:41] become a bad taste in our mouth
[57:45] if we ever want to pick that up and have
[57:46] a choice
[57:49] and ever take the grace out and make it
[57:52] law
[57:53] you better do this you better do that no
[57:54] you're you're ordained to it you're
[57:56] elected to it
[57:57] i don't believe that we should ever be
[57:58] afraid of preaching president
[58:00] predestination properly
[58:01] and the results be that the bride is
[58:04] going to live lasciviously
[58:07] i'm predestined it can't be lost sorry
[58:10] honey
[58:10] but i'm partying tonight that the bride
[58:13] doesn't act that way
[58:15] you don't have to be afraid of of of
[58:18] ultimately that bride that her
[58:19] disdaining the grace of god
[58:21] her using predestination as an excuse to
[58:23] live below her privileges
[58:25] yes people carnally without a birth use
[58:27] it all day long to justify their
[58:29] trajectory but listen
[58:30] that can't change one's election
[58:33] you didn't choose them here he says he
[58:36] chose
[58:37] you now and who is this melchizedek and
[58:40] he says we could see here
[58:42] and who is this melchizedek he says the
[58:43] whole plan of your whole life
[58:45] he talks about your track and your plan
[58:47] he says now we find him at the beginning
[58:49] his attributes and now you were with him
[58:52] then
[58:54] and i didn't i didn't use any highlights
[58:56] or underlining or red letter or anything
[58:58] on this to make any other emphasis
[59:00] because
[59:00] i'm providing this here to you so you
[59:03] could read along
[59:04] just as an aide to see this and
[59:07] i put a little picture brother branham
[59:08] down there just so you knew these
[59:10] weren't my thoughts
[59:12] but these are quotes because you never
[59:15] know who's visiting
[59:18] and he says now this is a powerful
[59:19] statement then is when the book of life
[59:22] comes into view
[59:24] we find him at the beginning and he says
[59:27] at the beginning you were in him
[59:30] and so in the beginning he says then is
[59:32] when the book of life comes into view so
[59:34] hold that in your mind the book of life
[59:35] coming into view
[59:36] now we read over here in revelation the
[59:37] 13th chapter in the eighth verse that
[59:39] that beast
[59:40] hold that thought thought to the beast
[59:42] that comes upon the earth in the last
[59:43] days
[59:44] will deceive all these people on the
[59:46] earth whose names were
[59:47] not written in the lamb's book of life
[59:49] before the foundation what he says
[59:51] think of it so the beast in the
[59:54] beginning
[59:54] deceived the woman then you come from
[59:57] genesis chapter 3
[59:59] all the way to revelations chapter 13
[1:00:01] and the beast
[1:00:02] in the end is deceiving again but he
[1:00:05] only has an effect on those who don't
[1:00:08] have their name in the lamb's book of
[1:00:10] life
[1:00:11] the record of the lamb's life he says
[1:00:13] think of it now catch the language here
[1:00:15] before jesus was ever born 4 000 years
[1:00:19] before he came on the earth
[1:00:20] and several thousand years before you
[1:00:23] come on the earth
[1:00:24] jesus in god's mind died for the sins of
[1:00:27] the world and the book of life was made
[1:00:29] and your name was put on that book of
[1:00:32] life
[1:00:32] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:34] that's the bible truth
[1:00:36] see your name was ordained of god placed
[1:00:38] on the book of life before the
[1:00:39] foundation of the world
[1:00:40] you were there in his attributes
[1:00:44] his attributes are thoughts his thoughts
[1:00:47] are real
[1:00:48] his thoughts are eternal right if you
[1:00:51] can see this
[1:00:52] you will see many things
[1:00:57] the book of life is coming into view at
[1:00:58] the beginning
[1:01:00] so read this scripture with a little bit
[1:01:01] more understanding of revelation
[1:01:03] psalms 139 14-17 i will praise thee
[1:01:08] for i am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:01:11] marvelous are thy works that my soul
[1:01:14] knoweth right well
[1:01:15] my substance was not hid from thee when
[1:01:17] i was made in secret
[1:01:19] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[1:01:21] parts of the earth
[1:01:22] our language to describe the earth as
[1:01:25] the place where there would be
[1:01:26] conception
[1:01:27] where there would be a place that
[1:01:28] something would begin to grow he says
[1:01:30] that when i was curiously wrought
[1:01:31] my substance was not hid even though i
[1:01:33] was made in secret you knew me you
[1:01:35] understood me verse 16 thine eyes did
[1:01:37] see my substance yet being unperfect not
[1:01:39] fully made manifest
[1:01:41] and in thy book all my members were
[1:01:44] written
[1:01:47] which in continuance were fashioned when
[1:01:49] as yet there was none of them
[1:01:51] how precious are thy thoughts unto me
[1:01:54] oh god how great is the sum of them
[1:01:58] the completion of them the fulfillment
[1:02:00] of them now you read this as a writer a
[1:02:02] psalmist is writing
[1:02:04] about his relationship with god and
[1:02:05] being known of him and how he's rod and
[1:02:07] secret and
[1:02:08] and he was conceived this way and his
[1:02:10] substance was not hid my bones my skin
[1:02:12] my shape my eyes all those things but
[1:02:14] brother branham says
[1:02:16] god knew you who you are you what your
[1:02:18] name was the way you looked it was in
[1:02:19] his thinking before
[1:02:21] before the foundation of the world but
[1:02:24] now i want to read it just a little bit
[1:02:26] differently and read it as the bride
[1:02:30] i will praise thee we will praise you
[1:02:33] for we are fearfully and wonderfully
[1:02:34] made marvelous for thy works
[1:02:35] and that our soul knoweth right well now
[1:02:37] the bride's speaking my
[1:02:39] substance was not hid from you when i
[1:02:41] was made in secret
[1:02:42] curiously wrought in the lost parts of
[1:02:43] the earth thine eyes did see my
[1:02:45] substance
[1:02:46] yet being imperfect and in thy book the
[1:02:49] bride saying
[1:02:50] oh my members were written
[1:02:53] oh no wonder you can say i all that my
[1:02:56] father have given me
[1:02:57] will come and i will not lose one
[1:03:01] why because all my members all the
[1:03:04] members of this bride are written in the
[1:03:05] book
[1:03:05] which in continuance were fashioned
[1:03:09] through age after age member after
[1:03:10] member coming forth when as yet there
[1:03:12] was none of them
[1:03:15] but here they are how precious are thy
[1:03:18] thoughts unto me your bride oh god how
[1:03:21] great is the sum
[1:03:23] of your thoughts brother braham took the
[1:03:26] scripture in the church book he says the
[1:03:28] idea
[1:03:28] and knowledge that the thought this is
[1:03:30] what it expresses it expresses the idea
[1:03:32] and knowledge that the thought was there
[1:03:33] in his mind
[1:03:34] and that thought was eternal and had to
[1:03:36] be expressed
[1:03:38] that's what the scripture sets forth he
[1:03:40] had you
[1:03:41] in his thinking as an eternal attribute
[1:03:44] and it had to be
[1:03:45] expressed and he said
[1:03:49] in all thy book in thy book all my
[1:03:52] members are written
[1:03:53] and brother branham says the book of
[1:03:56] life begins to come into view when god
[1:03:58] begins to create
[1:04:00] why because he's bringing you into
[1:04:01] existence
[1:04:04] the lamb's book of life now brother
[1:04:06] braham says in the first seal and the
[1:04:08] members of his bride
[1:04:10] their names were put in the lamb's book
[1:04:12] of life before the foundation of the
[1:04:14] world
[1:04:14] in thy book all my members were written
[1:04:18] even before they came on earth every
[1:04:20] member of this bride
[1:04:21] god knew who would be here the very
[1:04:23] language multiply and replenish the
[1:04:25] earth
[1:04:26] doesn't imply just stack them up like
[1:04:28] core would see how many you can fit it
[1:04:29] means
[1:04:30] fill it up to my designated point
[1:04:33] complete it
[1:04:35] why because god knew how many right
[1:04:38] so he says all the members of the bride
[1:04:40] their names are put in the land's book
[1:04:41] of life before the foundation of the
[1:04:42] world
[1:04:43] but it's been sealed up
[1:04:46] and now it's being revealed whose names
[1:04:50] were in there
[1:04:51] all about it it's been sealed up but now
[1:04:55] it's being revealed that means the book
[1:04:58] is open
[1:04:59] and it's revealing the members it's
[1:05:02] revealing what god knew when you were
[1:05:04] curiously wrong in the depths of the
[1:05:05] earth it's revealing that god knew you
[1:05:07] before there was one speck of star dust
[1:05:09] now it's being revealed whose names are
[1:05:11] in the book all about it he comes back
[1:05:13] later on that week they're asking him
[1:05:15] questions
[1:05:15] and he says the book holds the mystery
[1:05:18] and the book is
[1:05:19] only unfolding it now
[1:05:22] the book held the mystery of whose names
[1:05:24] are in there but it's
[1:05:26] only been folding until now or is now it
[1:05:29] only began to unfold until now it had
[1:05:32] not been unfolded before
[1:05:34] the book holds the mystery the book is
[1:05:35] not only unfolding it now not
[1:05:37] each one's name in the next paragraph he
[1:05:39] says it's not arm and neville it's not
[1:05:41] calling the name he says but what the
[1:05:43] mystery of the book is
[1:05:45] while it's calling those names why
[1:05:47] because it's a revelation
[1:05:50] you've heard you heard your name
[1:05:54] and it didn't it didn't have to say
[1:05:56] brother jeff
[1:05:57] but you heard your name it didn't have
[1:06:00] to declare it because anybody would say
[1:06:01] well
[1:06:02] my goodness he called his name but he
[1:06:03] didn't call mine it's a revelation and
[1:06:05] because it's revelation there's still a
[1:06:06] mysterious element that remains despite
[1:06:08] the revelation
[1:06:10] because it's still a mystery i don't
[1:06:13] have to hear your name called
[1:06:15] but you've got to hear your name called
[1:06:18] he says that's what's happening now
[1:06:20] now is being revealed whose names are in
[1:06:22] the book the book is only unfolding now
[1:06:24] the mystery of the book is being
[1:06:26] unfolded while the names are being
[1:06:28] called so it's not until the mystery
[1:06:32] is unfolding not until the revelation of
[1:06:35] the mystery is given that names can be
[1:06:37] called
[1:06:38] there's a lot there a whole lot there
[1:06:42] what it means for a name to be called i
[1:06:46] don't know what happened but i
[1:06:47] accidentally skipped a quote and things
[1:06:48] that are to be
[1:06:50] he says your birth here now because
[1:06:52] we're trying to
[1:06:54] and these this is something i'll just be
[1:06:55] honest these statements here ones i've
[1:06:57] always wrestled with
[1:06:59] and so they just clicked to me it
[1:07:00] clicked together this past week like now
[1:07:02] i have a
[1:07:02] i've come to a piece as to what brother
[1:07:05] brown means when he says your birth here
[1:07:06] was pre-planned
[1:07:08] and how the even your natural conception
[1:07:10] is more of a miracle
[1:07:12] than the immaculate conception amen
[1:07:16] because god in the beginning had you in
[1:07:19] mind
[1:07:20] and used his discretion and that's how
[1:07:23] he stretched out the stars
[1:07:26] which you are the stars of god and he
[1:07:28] determined where you would be in this
[1:07:30] expanse
[1:07:31] your name your shape your eyes
[1:07:35] so god had to be sure right
[1:07:39] if he knew it then then it had to be a
[1:07:42] particular way
[1:07:43] he says your birth here was pre-planned
[1:07:46] i guess you believe that everyone
[1:07:47] knows everyone knows that our birth was
[1:07:49] pre-planned i feel like he had me in
[1:07:50] mind
[1:07:51] when he said that because i was going is
[1:07:53] it really
[1:07:54] how can that be he said did you know
[1:07:57] that your being here
[1:07:58] never originated just at a myth or a
[1:08:01] thought
[1:08:04] now remember i'm speaking to the bride
[1:08:08] in thy book all thy members were written
[1:08:10] speaking specifically to the lamb's book
[1:08:12] of life god by foreknowledge knows
[1:08:13] everyone that's going to be
[1:08:14] in the book of life the record of the
[1:08:16] wheat plant but i think there's brother
[1:08:17] man's identifying something very
[1:08:19] particular to the elect
[1:08:21] did you know that your being here never
[1:08:22] originated just as a myth or a thought
[1:08:24] everything was all pre-planned by god
[1:08:28] before the foundation of the world that
[1:08:29] you would be here the infinite god knew
[1:08:31] and to be infinite he had to know every
[1:08:33] flea that would ever be in the earth and
[1:08:35] how many times it bats its eye that's
[1:08:36] infinite
[1:08:37] our little minds cannot fathom what
[1:08:39] infinite means and that's my problem
[1:08:41] with it perhaps
[1:08:42] he says that infinite god he know knew
[1:08:45] all things
[1:08:45] therefore there's nothing out of
[1:08:49] cater he knew
[1:08:52] what you would do he knew how hard your
[1:08:54] life would be
[1:08:55] he knew how what the seed that would be
[1:08:57] bruised he knew meanders he knew ups and
[1:09:00] downs
[1:09:00] he knew just what kind of family strain
[1:09:02] you would be a part of but he's like
[1:09:04] i'll use all of it
[1:09:07] for my great symphony i'll use all of it
[1:09:13] now he says i have heard but now i see
[1:09:14] there's nothing out of cater
[1:09:16] tell yourself that write it down there's
[1:09:18] nothing out of cater
[1:09:20] i want to get in cater if i feel like
[1:09:23] it's that lord i want to get into your
[1:09:24] cadence i want to get into your rhythm
[1:09:26] he says only can rain raise the seed is
[1:09:29] this
[1:09:30] if the seeds already there and as you
[1:09:33] were a germ
[1:09:34] first in your father he didn't know you
[1:09:36] yet you were in your father
[1:09:37] but through a betting ground of your
[1:09:39] mother you were made manifest in his
[1:09:41] likeness
[1:09:42] then he could talk to you now we have to
[1:09:45] think now in the spiritual because
[1:09:46] brother brown's going to relate it to
[1:09:47] the spiritual
[1:09:49] god the great god if you've got eternal
[1:09:51] life the germ of eternal life was in god
[1:09:53] at the beginning and you were there
[1:09:57] you were in his thinking your name and
[1:09:58] all and he by far knowledge ordained you
[1:10:02] to see this
[1:10:06] oh praise the lord there's there's the
[1:10:08] pre-planning
[1:10:10] he says and you were in his thinking and
[1:10:13] he
[1:10:13] by four knowledge ordained you to see
[1:10:15] this if you can see this
[1:10:18] you can see many things and by his
[1:10:20] foreknowledge he ordered you to see
[1:10:23] this that's why you can see many things
[1:10:28] and then he says in you that was not
[1:10:29] ordained will never see
[1:10:31] it
[1:10:34] who is it that he thought of then who
[1:10:36] was it that was in his pre-planning
[1:10:38] that's so connected to this word
[1:10:39] where brother branham can say you
[1:10:41] ordained to see this
[1:10:43] and you that are not ordained you will
[1:10:44] never see it but remember in the name of
[1:10:46] the lord jesus christ
[1:10:48] the hour is here won't you believe him
[1:10:51] give your lives to him
[1:10:54] what a wonderful invitation and a call
[1:10:57] the hour
[1:10:58] is here for what for the ordained to see
[1:11:00] it
[1:11:02] the hour is here for you to see this
[1:11:06] your beginning in the beginning god
[1:11:11] now in the end god the god in the
[1:11:14] beginning the god in the end
[1:11:17] and this path that he had set this track
[1:11:20] that he began to establish in creation
[1:11:24] the hour is here now
[1:11:27] god's secret mystery he had before the
[1:11:30] world began
[1:11:32] back in the back part of god's mind
[1:11:36] there was something that he was trying
[1:11:41] and he was going to achieve and he had a
[1:11:44] motive in doing it
[1:11:46] now think of that something in the back
[1:11:48] part of god's mind
[1:11:50] this is very deep this is in the back
[1:11:52] part there was something he was trying
[1:11:55] to achieve
[1:11:56] and was going to achieve so it's not
[1:11:58] just making effort but he's going to
[1:11:59] achieve it
[1:12:00] and he had a motive in doing it in order
[1:12:03] to let himself be
[1:12:05] expressed so god ultimately has the word
[1:12:08] the motive and the objective
[1:12:10] all of them lining up so there's a
[1:12:11] secret in his back part of his mind that
[1:12:13] he's going to achieve but abraham says
[1:12:15] and maybe improve his word he's going to
[1:12:17] achieve to himself
[1:12:18] a bride so now
[1:12:23] i can say now watch carefully so it's
[1:12:26] god's great
[1:12:27] mystery secret that he had it's in the
[1:12:28] back part of his mind watch carefully
[1:12:30] now
[1:12:31] and see this because if you can see this
[1:12:35] you will see many things and you're
[1:12:37] ordained to see this
[1:12:40] will you break it down for us brother
[1:12:41] branham before there was ever a speck of
[1:12:43] stardust
[1:12:44] before god was god god is an object of
[1:12:47] adoration and no one was there to
[1:12:48] worship him so he was at the time only
[1:12:50] potentially god there's a mouthful
[1:12:52] and he was only he was known only as
[1:12:55] eternal spirit
[1:12:57] the bride was already in his mind
[1:13:00] yes she was she was existing in his
[1:13:04] thoughts
[1:13:04] and what about those thoughts they are
[1:13:07] eternal
[1:13:07] are they not we've already read if you
[1:13:10] can see this you can see many things
[1:13:12] his thoughts are eternal they are
[1:13:16] real so he says that god in the
[1:13:19] beginning even before he was god brother
[1:13:21] branham focuses on
[1:13:22] the bride is in his mind she was existed
[1:13:25] in his thoughts
[1:13:26] and those thoughts are eternal they are
[1:13:30] real
[1:13:33] and brother branham says in seed not air
[1:13:35] with the shock that's what the church is
[1:13:37] doing today
[1:13:38] for jesus is the word and he is the
[1:13:40] bridegroom and the bride is the part of
[1:13:42] the groom
[1:13:43] therefore the word that is to be
[1:13:45] fulfilled this day
[1:13:47] is the same part of the word that was
[1:13:49] fulfilled in his day
[1:13:53] and it's the same word same experience
[1:13:56] same life
[1:13:58] in his day the bride is a part of the
[1:14:01] groom
[1:14:02] why first fold second fold
[1:14:05] for when god separated adam he was both
[1:14:09] we find out adam's spirit to begin with
[1:14:11] he made man in his own image
[1:14:12] created he male and female we're not
[1:14:15] preaching female holy ghosts we're not
[1:14:17] preaching
[1:14:18] some kind of doctrine out there that's
[1:14:19] trying to uh deify the bride above
[1:14:22] jesus christ it's the word the message
[1:14:24] of the hour positionally placing the
[1:14:26] bride
[1:14:27] out of the church and in christ it is an
[1:14:30] adoption message that takes those who've
[1:14:32] been born again by the baptism of the
[1:14:34] holy ghost
[1:14:34] and says get out of your mind this idea
[1:14:37] that you were some illegitimate child
[1:14:39] that god had mercy upon
[1:14:41] and brought into the family but you are
[1:14:43] born of his bone life is his life
[1:14:45] you are son you are daughter you are of
[1:14:47] the same dna
[1:14:48] you have the same seed same experience
[1:14:51] same life
[1:14:53] and he's positionally placing us in
[1:14:55] christ to see that it's
[1:14:57] male and female
[1:15:00] bride and groom
[1:15:03] so he says in plain language in very
[1:15:07] plain language
[1:15:08] the true bride of christ was in the mind
[1:15:09] of god eternally though not expressed
[1:15:11] until each came forth in the designated
[1:15:13] decreed season
[1:15:15] as each member come forth it became
[1:15:17] expressed can you see psalms 139
[1:15:19] unfolding
[1:15:21] all my members were written and then in
[1:15:24] continuance
[1:15:25] were fashioned they were already written
[1:15:28] but then
[1:15:29] when there was none of them they began
[1:15:31] to come forth
[1:15:32] oh how precious are your thoughts
[1:15:34] towards me though not express until each
[1:15:36] came forth in the designated decreed
[1:15:38] season
[1:15:38] as each member came forth it became
[1:15:40] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:15:42] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:15:46] word
[1:15:46] seed bride
[1:15:50] now you got that part now notice
[1:15:53] immediately what he says next and though
[1:15:57] she is feminine in designation
[1:16:01] she is also called the body of christ
[1:16:05] though she may be female though she may
[1:16:07] be used in feminine designation
[1:16:09] though it may be characterized as this
[1:16:10] gender can you realize what this
[1:16:12] dysmorphia
[1:16:13] and the the transgender and all these
[1:16:15] the the spectrum
[1:16:17] and even the the vitro towards cysts or
[1:16:20] oh you're you just claim to be male you
[1:16:21] don't think there's any other parts in
[1:16:22] you in there that might be something
[1:16:23] else
[1:16:24] that the reason why this exists is it's
[1:16:27] to cause confusion
[1:16:28] about even who god is
[1:16:32] that's why it comes up in this end time
[1:16:35] not so that we get all
[1:16:36] angry and mean-spirited and and full of
[1:16:39] bitterness and hatred towards somebody
[1:16:41] who doesn't know where they are on that
[1:16:42] spectrum
[1:16:47] she is called the body of christ it is
[1:16:49] very apparent that she ought to be
[1:16:50] called that
[1:16:51] for she was predestined in him came from
[1:16:54] the
[1:16:55] same source was eternal with him and is
[1:16:58] now
[1:16:58] manifesting god who is
[1:17:01] she is now manifesting god in a many
[1:17:04] member body whereas once
[1:17:05] god was manifested in one member even
[1:17:08] our lord jesus christ
[1:17:10] oh you talk about the power of one look
[1:17:12] what happened in that one once he was
[1:17:13] manifested in the one
[1:17:15] now he could be made manifest in many
[1:17:18] that's why we never lose focus we never
[1:17:20] get this out of order and get one over
[1:17:22] the other if there hadn't been one
[1:17:25] there could not be many had it not
[1:17:28] been for him had it not been for mount
[1:17:30] calvary had it not been god sending his
[1:17:33] son to die
[1:17:33] had there not been a firstborn there
[1:17:36] could have never been many brethren
[1:17:39] but now i want to take my place
[1:17:42] and be a a member of this body that is
[1:17:45] manifesting
[1:17:47] god
[1:17:52] first fold second fault
[1:17:58] my last page is blank so
[1:18:02] i don't know if that helps but we're
[1:18:05] almost done notice how brother bram says
[1:18:09] this
[1:18:10] i i want this to become part of our
[1:18:13] foundation
[1:18:16] so that as a church
[1:18:19] we're not a cult of personality as a
[1:18:22] church
[1:18:23] we're not politic centric that it's not
[1:18:27] that we what we are is we believe in a
[1:18:29] living ministry
[1:18:30] not just a live ministry
[1:18:34] let's lift up the threefold purpose over
[1:18:36] the fivefold
[1:18:38] because it's the five-fold purpose to
[1:18:40] lift up lift up you
[1:18:43] i i and to minister t to be a servant of
[1:18:45] all
[1:18:46] and this is this the fabric and the dna
[1:18:50] of this church
[1:18:51] is going to be that god had had
[1:18:54] something in his mind that he was trying
[1:18:55] to achieve
[1:18:57] and it wasn't to build a fancy church
[1:19:01] if you visited our website here comes
[1:19:03] the unabashed plug azbelievers.com
[1:19:06] hit like hit the notifications button
[1:19:09] subscribe
[1:19:11] all that pound it noggin whatever it is
[1:19:13] whatever it is you're supposed to say
[1:19:14] when you plug your website
[1:19:16] on there i put what the the purpose of
[1:19:18] the church not a vision not a
[1:19:20] mission statement but purpose and
[1:19:23] and and this is how the lord inspired in
[1:19:25] the beginning god's first masterpiece
[1:19:28] was a man was man and woman as a family
[1:19:30] not a church
[1:19:33] god's first expression of himself god's
[1:19:36] first masterpiece was not a church it
[1:19:37] doesn't say in the beginning
[1:19:39] god raised up a pastor and god had
[1:19:42] deacons and god had trustees and they
[1:19:44] found a nice building they began to have
[1:19:45] church
[1:19:46] and god saw that it was very very very
[1:19:49] good
[1:19:50] no god had a man and a woman that's
[1:19:54] that's his focus that's his ambition and
[1:19:56] the ambition of the church is not to be
[1:19:58] a church
[1:19:58] the ambition of a church is to minister
[1:20:01] to individuals and families
[1:20:02] that they can be the masterpiece
[1:20:05] doesn't matter if the church isn't
[1:20:07] pretty it doesn't matter if it's
[1:20:08] gathered in a hotel room
[1:20:09] just fulfill god's purpose and you're
[1:20:11] beautiful in his eyes
[1:20:13] even if there's some people that never
[1:20:14] come with this kind of setup
[1:20:16] should we get a 360 degree camera so
[1:20:18] everybody can see just how chaotic this
[1:20:19] is the c in abc is arizona believers
[1:20:23] cables
[1:20:24] i've never seen more cables in my life
[1:20:27] but that's not our focus that's not our
[1:20:29] drive
[1:20:30] that the burden is to lift up the people
[1:20:32] to lift up the bride
[1:20:33] and brother best is the very creator
[1:20:35] that created the earth for a purpose
[1:20:37] so god had a purpose and creative he
[1:20:39] said satan
[1:20:40] defiled it i i'm marching
[1:20:44] very swiftly towards the close here and
[1:20:46] i want to pick up on this image that
[1:20:47] brother bran is bringing into our minds
[1:20:49] maybe next sunday the very creator
[1:20:51] created the earth for a purpose
[1:20:52] then satan defiled it right and what do
[1:20:55] we call this earth mother earth
[1:20:58] because something was to come from it
[1:21:00] and why did satan so quickly
[1:21:03] why was he there so quickly to do what
[1:21:05] he did
[1:21:06] because he thought he was interrupting
[1:21:08] god's plan
[1:21:10] listen satan saw the trajectory
[1:21:16] satan being so close to god
[1:21:19] could see what god was trying to achieve
[1:21:22] but god hid it as a mystery
[1:21:24] so that satan's only looking at a part
[1:21:27] trying to figure out where it's at
[1:21:30] and and on the spectrum god used satan's
[1:21:33] own ambition to what display
[1:21:35] every single one of his attributes
[1:21:39] so it church age book chapter 4
[1:21:43] the heart purpose the eternal purpose of
[1:21:45] god was
[1:21:47] to take a bride of his own choosing
[1:21:51] the heart purpose the central purpose
[1:21:53] the very thing that defined god
[1:21:56] you realize sometimes for us as humans
[1:21:58] we're identified by our ambition
[1:22:01] if someone oh he's into sports he really
[1:22:03] likes to hike
[1:22:04] oh you should talk to this brother he's
[1:22:06] a carpenter and what have we done we've
[1:22:08] taken their ambition
[1:22:10] their trade their work or what they're
[1:22:12] good at and we identified them by it
[1:22:14] therefore god at his heart
[1:22:16] at his core what was he a man that
[1:22:18] wanted a bride
[1:22:20] so if we hung out with him in junior
[1:22:21] high we would always be picking them you
[1:22:23] just want to get married
[1:22:24] don't you that's all you talk about is
[1:22:26] getting married
[1:22:27] and god's like yup that's right that's
[1:22:30] it i'm not ashamed
[1:22:31] you couldn't make him blush i mean if
[1:22:34] anybody tried to call him out
[1:22:35] oh you're just so thirsty to get married
[1:22:37] you're right
[1:22:38] exactly that's my heart purpose that's
[1:22:41] my eternal purpose
[1:22:42] the hard purpose the eternal purpose of
[1:22:44] god was take a bride of his own choosing
[1:22:45] and that purpose was in himself and
[1:22:48] being eternal was decreed
[1:22:50] before the foundation of the world what
[1:22:52] was decreed
[1:22:53] i will have a bride
[1:22:57] that was decreed before the foundation
[1:22:58] of the world it was his heart purpose
[1:23:00] his eternal purpose
[1:23:01] and the very creator that created the
[1:23:03] earth he created it for a purpose
[1:23:05] therefore his purpose and creating the
[1:23:07] earth could not be incongruent or
[1:23:09] contrary to
[1:23:10] this purpose so brother braham says it
[1:23:13] for us
[1:23:14] god made the earth he made the earth for
[1:23:17] a purpose
[1:23:18] to take a church out of it he clarifies
[1:23:21] a bride
[1:23:23] and he said that's the most important
[1:23:25] job in the world
[1:23:27] i believe that's what he says here i cut
[1:23:28] it out just first space
[1:23:30] he says god made the earth he made it
[1:23:31] for a purpose to take
[1:23:33] a church out of it a bride that's the
[1:23:35] most important job
[1:23:38] that's a job that we're focused on
[1:23:40] that's part of our ambition as a church
[1:23:42] is as a local church oh god take a bride
[1:23:45] out of this valley
[1:23:47] call them reach them use me lay some
[1:23:50] soul upon my heart lord let me live a
[1:23:52] life that's so salty
[1:23:54] lord let me let me walk in the rhythm of
[1:23:56] your word be in the it's expression of
[1:23:58] god
[1:23:58] you said that as the bride we are
[1:24:00] manifesting
[1:24:02] god let me manifest god
[1:24:05] as one of the members of this
[1:24:07] mini-membered body
[1:24:10] he made the earth for a purpose
[1:24:13] according to his heart purpose to get a
[1:24:14] bride out of him
[1:24:16] he says it was god's purpose to bring
[1:24:18] forth a people
[1:24:20] like unto himself that would be a word
[1:24:23] bride so genesis 1 27
[1:24:27] god made man in his own image and he
[1:24:29] made him male and female
[1:24:31] it was foreshadowing god's divine intent
[1:24:37] right amen when he said that he made man
[1:24:40] in his own image and he made him male
[1:24:41] and female
[1:24:42] it's heaven and earth once again
[1:24:46] god over and over again i was like i
[1:24:48] don't know are they ever going to pick
[1:24:49] up on this
[1:24:50] are they going to see it they ever going
[1:24:52] to realize that i
[1:24:54] this whole time have been leaving them
[1:24:56] bright easter eggs as it were
[1:24:59] we've been playing this game for years
[1:25:02] and now we go back to genesis chapter
[1:25:03] one like oh my goodness i didn't know
[1:25:04] there was this portal there i didn't
[1:25:06] know this was there
[1:25:07] this is amazing why he had you in his
[1:25:10] thinking alone when he put the stars in
[1:25:12] the sky when he wrote his bible when he
[1:25:13] allowed it to be translated he was
[1:25:15] thinking of you over and over again i
[1:25:16] want a bride of my choosing
[1:25:18] oh before she was even brought into the
[1:25:20] depths of this earth he's thinking of
[1:25:21] you
[1:25:22] why because it was his purpose it was
[1:25:25] god's purpose
[1:25:26] even a singular purpose to bring forth a
[1:25:28] people like himself
[1:25:30] that would be a word bride
[1:25:34] praise the lord it's all the last days
[1:25:38] when this great mystery that god had hid
[1:25:41] in his heart
[1:25:42] is being revealed
[1:25:45] it wasn't revealed until now now is when
[1:25:48] this mystery is unfolding
[1:25:50] now as well as the mystery is unfolding
[1:25:51] it's calling names now
[1:25:53] is it being made known what was in the
[1:25:54] back part of god's mind and he phrases
[1:25:56] it this way
[1:25:57] the mystery that god had in his heart
[1:25:59] what was the mystery in his heart
[1:26:02] you got a mirror just look into it you
[1:26:05] were
[1:26:06] you could say i was i was that mystery
[1:26:08] how is it even a greater mystery it was
[1:26:10] the mystery of the prophets
[1:26:11] the mystery is declared by his servants
[1:26:13] the prophets was that god's wife would
[1:26:16] be a gentile
[1:26:18] even the jews as much as they believed
[1:26:20] that they would be in beulah
[1:26:21] as much as they thought that they would
[1:26:22] be ishi as much as they thought they
[1:26:24] would be
[1:26:25] betrothed god all along hid the mystery
[1:26:27] that his wife would be a gentile
[1:26:30] right yeah that's why the last mystery
[1:26:32] of the old testament malachi 4 5
[1:26:34] is a gentile prophet and the first mr
[1:26:37] the new testament
[1:26:38] is all the gen all the women mentioned
[1:26:40] in the lineage jesus of jesus
[1:26:42] were all gentile women it connects the
[1:26:45] mystery of the prophets to the mystery
[1:26:47] of the new testament
[1:26:48] the bride is the mystery of god finished
[1:26:51] revelations 10 7 the mystery of god is a
[1:26:53] gentile bride
[1:26:56] and all those things that work together
[1:26:58] to bring her forth
[1:27:00] brother brad i'm talking and christ is a
[1:27:02] mystery god revealed
[1:27:04] he says the threefold purpose made
[1:27:07] manifested
[1:27:08] the threefold purpose of god manifested
[1:27:11] in adam
[1:27:12] and eve
[1:27:16] it's kind of neat the powerpoint
[1:27:17] presentation tells me how long i've been
[1:27:19] preaching
[1:27:24] oops in the beginning
[1:27:30] in the beginning god was fixing the
[1:27:34] circuit
[1:27:36] laying the tracks as it were
[1:27:38] establishing the path
[1:27:40] for his bride to come into existence
[1:27:43] right i mean if we believe you're the
[1:27:46] heart purpose
[1:27:47] all those quotes should i go back to
[1:27:48] that other slide
[1:27:50] but think about what he's saying the
[1:27:51] heart purpose of god the purpose of the
[1:27:53] earth
[1:27:54] purpose of ministry today the purpose of
[1:27:56] church all these things the real heart
[1:27:57] purpose the core the
[1:27:59] the thing that god had in his heart that
[1:28:01] means every
[1:28:02] track he's laid everything he's doing is
[1:28:05] to bring forth this bride
[1:28:07] so he had fixed your destiny he'd fixed
[1:28:10] your path it was set already and also he
[1:28:14] says he knoweth
[1:28:15] job 23 10 he knoweth the way that i take
[1:28:20] and when he had tried me i shall come
[1:28:22] forth
[1:28:23] as gold he knew the track he knew the
[1:28:26] path
[1:28:27] he knew the way that you would take and
[1:28:30] so
[1:28:30] sister cassandra if you could come i i
[1:28:33] want to close here maybe just say a few
[1:28:34] things as we try to wrap this up
[1:28:37] do how many here by show of hands now
[1:28:40] we're getting participation like man you
[1:28:41] should have done this an hour ago
[1:28:42] to wake us up how many were called
[1:28:45] brother branham saying he wanted to
[1:28:46] preach the trail of the serpent
[1:28:49] raise your hand if you've heard that
[1:28:50] brother brown never preached the trail
[1:28:52] of the serpent
[1:28:53] but he said enough things about it a few
[1:28:56] key things
[1:28:56] about it to where
[1:29:00] i i as i was pondering
[1:29:03] this and god's identifying this path and
[1:29:05] this trajectory
[1:29:07] this is how brother brown described the
[1:29:09] sermon he wanted to preach they had all
[1:29:11] these scriptures and everything
[1:29:13] he called it the beast at the beginning
[1:29:16] and the beast at the end
[1:29:18] through the trail of the serpent
[1:29:21] and even though he had never preached
[1:29:24] the sermon called the trail of the
[1:29:25] serpent
[1:29:26] he expresses the beast at the beginning
[1:29:29] and the beast at the end
[1:29:30] through the trail of a serpent and
[1:29:32] although he didn't preach
[1:29:34] that he preached this the bride at the
[1:29:37] beginning
[1:29:38] and the bride at the end through the
[1:29:40] trail of christ
[1:29:42] he preached that perfectly he preached
[1:29:45] it clearly
[1:29:46] he hid it over and over and over again
[1:29:49] through all those last sermons he's
[1:29:50] preaching
[1:29:51] as he comes to the end of his life why
[1:29:52] we could not miss
[1:29:54] that don't miss
[1:29:57] that the bride at the beginning the
[1:30:00] bride
[1:30:00] at the end through the trail of christ
[1:30:05] oh hallelujah hallelujah surely as i
[1:30:08] have fought
[1:30:10] so shall it come to pass and as i have
[1:30:13] purposed
[1:30:14] so shall it stand
[1:30:19] as i have fought it so shall it come to
[1:30:22] pass
[1:30:23] and as i have purposed so shall it stand
[1:30:27] let's stand
[1:30:34] i'm going to leave a little bit out
[1:30:42] it just gives us more to look at next
[1:30:43] time i want to start there in the garden
[1:30:46] of eden
[1:30:49] recapture some of these things that
[1:30:50] brother man is talking about the things
[1:30:51] that
[1:30:52] the scriptures talk about he hath made
[1:30:55] the earth by his power he's established
[1:30:56] the world by his wisdom
[1:30:59] stretch out the heavens by his
[1:31:00] discretion
[1:31:02] we see according to scripture that
[1:31:03] christ is the power and the wisdom of
[1:31:05] god
[1:31:06] but now the bride in her time in her
[1:31:09] turn
[1:31:10] is the power and wisdom of god brother
[1:31:13] brown writes in the church book
[1:31:15] in fact in her is summed up and
[1:31:18] manifested
[1:31:19] the eternal wisdom and purpose of god
[1:31:22] those are brother branham's words he
[1:31:24] wrote them in his book he said
[1:31:26] in fact in her and who the bride is
[1:31:29] summed up
[1:31:30] the conclusion the summation the
[1:31:33] totality the whole
[1:31:34] and manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:31:36] purpose of god
[1:31:38] who is then the power and wisdom of god
[1:31:40] you are
[1:31:41] the bride is then when god began to
[1:31:44] create
[1:31:44] in the beginning god created the heavens
[1:31:47] and the earth
[1:31:48] creation the intelligence the divine
[1:31:51] the wisdom the power you were there then
[1:31:56] you're part of that oh let that bring us
[1:31:59] outside of this realm of
[1:32:00] i hope so i'm on this this guess this
[1:32:04] uh chance coincidence mentality
[1:32:08] and yield to his design yes can we do it
[1:32:11] individually today
[1:32:14] with our heads bowed lord i want to
[1:32:16] yield to your design
[1:32:19] as a church lord let our purpose be your
[1:32:23] purpose
[1:32:25] let us exist to fulfill your purpose
[1:32:30] the local church is not greater than the
[1:32:31] body of christ
[1:32:34] local ministries not greater than the
[1:32:37] individual members
[1:32:39] of the body of christ the most important
[1:32:43] thing is this leadership of the holy
[1:32:45] spirit in an individual member's life
[1:32:49] let's facilitate that as a church let's
[1:32:52] promote it as individuals
[1:32:54] let's stand for it and let us have this
[1:32:58] sure conviction according to isaiah as
[1:33:01] god has thought it shall come to pass
[1:33:03] as he has purposed it shall
[1:33:06] stand
[1:33:10] with our heads bowed if you have a need
[1:33:13] in your life today
[1:33:14] i encourage you to bring that need
[1:33:17] before the lord
[1:33:19] we'll offer prayers you lift your hands
[1:33:23] or
[1:33:23] raise your need to him our gracious
[1:33:26] heavenly father
[1:33:28] lord as we stand here today to close of
[1:33:32] this service
[1:33:34] our thoughts sir overwhelmed with all
[1:33:37] the
[1:33:37] scriptures and the quotations that
[1:33:40] follow this path in this line
[1:33:44] lord once again lengthy maybe be
[1:33:48] laboring
[1:33:50] maybe repetitive
[1:33:53] but lord we must see this so that we can
[1:33:56] see many things
[1:33:59] i pray that this would become a sure
[1:34:01] conviction in the hearts of all those
[1:34:02] who are gathered here today
[1:34:04] their position in you before the
[1:34:05] foundation of the world their connection
[1:34:07] with your attributes and your thoughts
[1:34:09] is eternal and real
[1:34:12] lord that the word would begin to shape
[1:34:14] and form what that exactly means
[1:34:16] not eternal sonship or pre-existence of
[1:34:18] souls as some would
[1:34:20] conjecture and speculate and add to
[1:34:22] their canon and their theology but lord
[1:34:24] the truth of it as it relates to who i
[1:34:27] am
[1:34:28] and who you want me to be father i pray
