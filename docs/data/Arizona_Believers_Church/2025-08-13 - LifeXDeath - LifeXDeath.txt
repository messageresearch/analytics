TRANSCRIPT
========================================
These are very familiar scriptures. I would almost say that tonight what I'm ministering on might seem to be somewhat cliche. Uh just because it is an often ministered on subject, but just because it's preached often doesn't mean there's nothing better to preach. It just means we need it. &gt;&gt; And I really believe that God often times emphasizes these things because it's at a time that we need it. And we know that all things work together for I'll just start with verse 28. know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them he also called. And whom he called them, he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. So now he says, "What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all. How shall he not with him also freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? For it is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died, yay, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long, for we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Thank you so much, Lord, for inspiring Paul to write these things with such great specificity. You can be seated. My I'm going to have a title tonight of life by death. And we'll come back to maybe that just here in a moment. But I wanted to go back over life is good. We ministered on that on Sunday. What we're ministering tonight does build from that. I do think it stands on its own. But I wanted just to approach this subject tonight by going back over this quickly that this life is good was used just to kind of emphasize the thought that the good life is eternal life. We know that we're taught in the message of the hour that there is a life that is God's own life. Brother Brandham takes from the scripture thy loving kindness is better than life. And he says, well, it couldn't be better than eternal life. So what he's referring to has to be some other kind of life. And so when we say life is good, that's this eternal life, Zoey life. We could say that it's Christ that is good and Christ who is God's wisdom and God's power. And that's the in there is the good life or life is good or eternal life is that which is good. Uh brother Eli Argast sent me a scripture yesterday and just sent some of his thoughts on it. I thought it was really really good and it just kind of encouraged me in this direction tonight. In Psalm 38:20, David says, "They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries." And so, we know we're taught not to render evil for evil, nor return evil for good, but that we should do good and we should do right. But here he says, "Those that would render good for e or render evil for good are his enemies because I follow the thing that good is." What brother Eli remarked on is you you read it, it almost seems a little bit backwards because you would say, "I follow the thing that is good." But this is the thing that good is. And maybe a lot of different translations might wrestle with this, but when we look in the scripture know that there's a one good, but God, it says the thing that good is good is Christ. Christ the way, the truth, the life. This is the good. He is good. Not in the sense of well, he has these kind of characteristics, but it's inherent in him. this goodness. &gt;&gt; And so in our lives where we have in the human existence as we've been using this kind of music theory and this interplay between consonants which is good and the dissonance which is evil and how those elements work together to form this symphony, this composition and how the evil and those tones and the way that God uses them in our lives. It's necessary for this great symphony that we're living in right now that for the for it to be a masterpiece. There's something that he does to make it a masterpiece. And it's not just monotone. It's not just the consonants, but there's something he does to give it context and make it something great. And so when we say life is good, it's contrasted by death. Like death is bad. Maybe it could have been another title. But I I don't want life just to be defined uh by as an or death to be defined as an opposite to life because life really has no comparison. And it's not that we define life by looking at what the opposite is, but it's this contrasted this life, this eternal life is contrasted by death. And there's a way that we could phrase this to say this life is death. From the moment you're born, you're marching to a grave. And so this life, this human life, this life we now live, we've seen it in a lot of different ways in the scripture. It's full of darkness. It's full of evil. It's full of hurt and pain. And so in third John uh verse uh verse 11 it says beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good. So there's an evil in life and there's things that I we can almost say this that the things that are evil are those things will have an end. Those things that are evil are things that are temporary and carnal. Oh that's kind of some strong language. Well let's just look at it that way. And there's things that we could pursue and hunger for and lust for. But don't do that. Pursue that which is good. And again, the language suggests something more than just happiness and good times in life. It says, "He that doeth good is of God, but he that doeth evil hath not seen God." &gt;&gt; Good is God. &gt;&gt; And so, when we're to follow that which is good, we're to follow Christ. We're to follow after charity. We're to pursue these good things and to the Bible says assue evil or abandon evil or forsake evil. In order to do that, you have to recognize it. &gt;&gt; Right? This is how our love is without hypocrisy is we cling to the good and we abhore or hate that which is evil. So if we're to follow that which is good, then we're to follow Christ because he is that good and he that doeth good is of God. So there's this this great distinction of the goodly, the godly, the goodness is is of God and then the evil, the carnal and the debase is human. Now my title is life by death. I thought brother Bart Martin may appreciate my use of an X here. I know he's been to South by Southwest a number of times. So, we're just trying to stay up to date. Little trendy here. Uh maybe that's more of a 2000s thing, but life by death. And I hope this isn't too much of a big deal. I got to get this off my chest, but it struck me today. And I may be late to the party, but it's Bob the tomato and Larry the cucumber. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Aren't those the main guys in Veggie Tales? And aren't those fruits? They are. I I don't know where that came from, but it was I was in the office. I can't get past it. And I just had to lay that out there. Thinking about silly songs in music. But the fact that a tomato and a cucumber are the lead characters on a cartoon about vegetables just I don't know. Speaking about of death, but life by death. What we're want to look at tonight is the necessity of need. A lot of different ways that you could phrase this, a lot of ways that you could explore this. But uh maybe if I could say it this way, and I know I know there's just this tight rope sometimes that you walk in these things, but evil is necessary. &gt;&gt; And and it must be overcome in order to see good. &gt;&gt; If we want to see good in this life, you're not just going to lay around and see it. &gt;&gt; Uh this life, this human life is is sorrow and it's leading to a grave. And so when we use this title life by death, we're looking at how there's this uh we need uh we need necessity uh evil is necessary because it has to be overcome. It has to be suffered or endured or even accepted in order to see good. In Hebrews chapter 2 10 and again I I mentioned cliche in the beginning. It comes from these very familiar scriptures. So there's nothing I'm not I'm not revealing anything this evening. Uh just as at any other service we preach. We don't reveal anything new. For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things. Christ the wisdom and power of God. That one in the beginning by whom all things were created. Without him was nothing made but in bringing many sons unto glory. So now we're part of this to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. And perfect there means ended. It means it means to rest or this culmination. Uh there's a scripture Christ said the things pertaining to me shall have an end. And I heard a minister one time preach that Christ would cease to exist. That he would no longer exist. Absolutely. Whatsoever in heaven, he would no longer exist. Taking the scripture that the things pertaining to me shall have an end. But it doesn't mean they'll have an end. It'll just reach its completion. &gt;&gt; Not end as in being finished. It's gone. It's done away with like the second death. Uh doing away with the hell and devil and his angels. But it means uh in bringing many sons into glory, he was brought to this culmination. He was finished. He was fulfilled. He found his rest through suffering. Therefore, if we are called to glory, then our glory will come by affliction. It comes by enduring. He's bringing many sons unto glory. And the very one, the leader in this is brought to his rest through sufferings. And we're called to share in that glory. That's &gt;&gt; why Paul says in Romans 8 verse 18, for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. So there is this measure of suffering now in this life. This life is the hurting. This life is the pain. This life is the striving and and the the attempting to overcome. I remember as a young Christian I heard a brother sing the song uh uh just a few more happy days and then I'll fly away. And I was like I like that positive confession. And I remember I sang it one time leading songs at at I wanted to say Homer Tabernacle but that's not it. It's evening light in uh used to be Homer, Louisiana. And I sang just a few more happy days and then you know I'll fly away and was trying to be all positive and happy and brother Tim got up and said no it's a few more weary days and then our church will never sing it that way again. And maybe as a young man I'm thinking a come on positive confession and you know my old age now I'm thinking probably older than brother Tim was at the time when he corrected that. I like you know what they are weary days. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they are they are weary days. Yes, we have times of happiness and we have times of great joy and victory, but this is a time of warfare. This is a time of fighting. &gt;&gt; We haven't we haven't uh beat our swords into plowshares yet. &gt;&gt; And so, it's a it's a time of suffering, but the sufferings of this present time point to a glory to be revealed in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians 12:es 5-7, he's talking about being caught up into a third heaven and these great revelations that he had and he's going to I could speak of this and he's talking about boasting. He says, "Of such a one will I glory yet of myself I will not glory but in my infirmities." Odd statement. "I'm going to glory in my affirmities, my afflictions, my sorrows, my trials, my sicknesses, my weaknesses. For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool. For I will say the truth, but now I forbear. I love Paul. He just I wish he could podcast today. I would binge it. For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool. For I will say the truth, but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which seemth seemth me to be which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very important scripture I think for all of us, not just for a prophet or to an apostle or messenger here. But he's saying that I receive these revelations and these revelations coming from God and uh and the these things being very special to me. He says, "I I'm not going to glory in that. I'll glory in the one that was revealed to me." But he's saying that the thorn was a necessary evil because the revelation of Christ. &gt;&gt; Because he had received this revelation of Christ, there needed to be some sort of balance in his life. There had to be something that opposed him. I appreciated brother Tim Dodd sharing with me one time that in order for something to have be faith, it has to have something against it. And so what made that revelation so beautiful to him is that it gave him soloulless in the midst of everything that would try to attack that and tear it down. So this thorn was, if I could say, a necessary evil because of the revelation of Christ, but not just because the revelation of Christ, but also because of his own evil. &gt;&gt; He said, lest he should be exalted above measure. So you have this revelation of Christ, which is beautiful. It's what you're receiving today. It's what you're feeding on now is this revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you in this hour where he's making himself known. And as he makes himself known, lest we would be exalted above measure because there's still this human element that's being perfected and a and worked with, we could be exalted, become arrogant, become prideful, become political with it. Then he says there's this messenger of Satan that buffeted him. It's that same measure of suffering that we're left to ourselves. There was something there that acted as a balancer to him. It kept him in check. When we say life by death, I know it's a a peculiar phrase, but I think you kind of understand already. The evil we experience and this the press that we have to endure, the things that press in upon us, they cannot hinder God's purpose for us. &gt;&gt; Christ was going to be the captain of our salvation. And it was all the sufferings did not prevent that. Paul was a prophet to the Gentiles. He was a prophet to that first age and all the thorns in his flesh and the things that buffeted him did not prevent that. We'll see in the scripture that and I think we're all familiar with this that in order for something to live something has to die or there's this process. So it's this principle of life through death in Romans chapter 8 35-37. We've already read uh just a moment ago how we suffer in this present time and through these sufferings there's going to be a glory that is wrought in us and he's already said that all things work together for good. So the evil that we experience cannot prevent the good. And and as predestinated children of God, we've been predestinated to a glory, to a perfection, this glorified state. And he says if he didn't spare his own son, he says, and he delivered him up for us all. How will he not by that deliverance give us all things? But if he did not spare his own son's suffering, how is it that we ourselves could be spared punishment or spared the suffering? And so he doesn't say, "Oh, through his death, we're going to be given all things and we're somehow exempt from suffering." No, he continues to say that we cannot be condemned because Christ is risen. &gt;&gt; So then he asks the question, who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Before you read anything else, you should know the answer. Nothing. &gt;&gt; I remember uh brother Junior one time in in Texas. He preached a sermon and he was main language was Spanish. And brother Scott, I don't even know, you might have been there. And he was preaching and and he spoke Spanish, but he was preaching in English. And he said, "What shall separate us from the love of Christ?" And he said, "Only one thing." And I'm kind of like, "Well, brother, I don't know what it says in your Spanish, but" and he said, "Nothing." I was like, "I appreciate that. I like that. That's good." Nothing. That's the only thing, nothing. What shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? Notice he doesn't say what is it that we will not suffer as his sons? What is it we don't have to go through? It assumes the tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, or nakedness or perilous sword. But he's wanting us to understand that though we may suffer that, it cannot separate us from his love. So then he kind of drills down on or doubles down as it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep for the slaughter. So we must suffer this daily death. We have to suffer the persecution. We have to suffer the evil in this life. Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors to him that loved us. &gt;&gt; We're not exempt from them, but somehow we emerge from it more than conquerors. not survivors, not even overcomers, but more than conquerors &gt;&gt; through the distress, through this tribulation, through the famine, the nakedness, the peril on the sword. What I'd been studying on uh this week and last week, thinking I'd minister on it tonight, is this thought of nakedness. And there's a lot in the scripture to get your hands around and understand our condition, especially in this leodyian age where we're described in our spiritual condition as naked. But here, this nakedness is included with tribulation and distress and persecution, famine, peril, and sword. So it's all these things that we're to be more than conquerors. In Hebrews chapter 5 6-9 we see Christ here the love of Christ and Christ himself having endured these things says as he he saith also in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc who in the days of his flesh when he Christ now had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears tears unto him that was able to save him from death. Where did we see this? We saw this in the garden where he was in agony. He despared and he even his te his sweat dropped like blood and there's this great agony. What was he wrestling? He was struggling against death &gt;&gt; and in his flesh he offered up prayers and supplications with strong tears and crying unto God who could save him from death and he was heard and that he feared. what you'll see that it I want to point this out that our humanity cries for death, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That that's what it it's it's almost hungry for that. It it pursues that it it it's marching to the grave. Our our humanity cries for evil. But here the word was crying for life, &gt;&gt; crying for that good. And though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suff suffered. So as he suffered verse 9 and being made perfect he became an author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. Brother Brandham in the sermon perfect strength by perfect weaknesses he chose to make Christ the example for us excuse me of us for us and brought him in humility. &gt;&gt; He's using the example of being born in a manger no royal palace and not with all these great fine amenities and great medical attention and a way that you might expect a king to come. But he says he was brought through humility and then he's he achieves this captain of our salvation through suffering through humility and he's an example of us for us. &gt;&gt; This abundance this glory in in in in any part of our lives abundance power blessing all those things that we might desire will come only through need. can only come through weakness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Can only come through pain, &gt;&gt; as much as we would desire that when we become Christians, we unlock some secret uh portal where now everything is just awesome and everything that happens to us, evil's coming at us, we're like wing, we just wave a magic wand and it just changes into something awesome. You're like, "Thanks for the lemonade lemons, right?" And everything's just perfect. No, it doesn't always work. It never works that way. Actually, &gt;&gt; we have no magic wand to turn all the evil that comes our way into a warm fuzzy weighted blanket &gt;&gt; where we just feel, oh, doesn't this feel great? No, we run for the weighted blanket because all the pressures and all the things we experience and all the things we endure. So, this I want to be fruitful. I want to have blessings. I want to have power. It's going to come first by being barren. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to come through weakness. It's going to come through pain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 15:es 1 and two. I am the true vine. My father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away. So we say, well, there's that burning of a branch. But then he says, in every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit. &gt;&gt; So we think of the one that's fruitless and that just gets destroyed. But the one that's going to produce fruit, he actually harms. He prunes. &gt;&gt; He purges. He refineses. &gt;&gt; He does something to it. And in doing that, in pruning, in purging, in inflicting some sort of loss or pain on the branch, he's doing it in order to stimulate more growth and more fruit. &gt;&gt; He does it that it may bring forth more fruit. &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 5:6, that which is rejected, it says, "I will lay it waste, and it shall not be pruned nor digged." So these actions of pruning and digging, they may seem to be invasive. It may disturb the soil. it may disturb the branch or the tree. He says, "But there shall come up briars and thorns. I also command the clouds that they rain no more uh that rain no rain upon it." This is God's attitude towards the rejected branch, the rejected vine, the rejected vendor. There's no there's no caring for it anymore. But to that which can bring forth fruit, that which is ordained to bring forth much fruit, he says, "I'm going to purge. I'm going to prune. In Luke 13 6-9, he speaks this parable. A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. And he came and sought fruit thereon and found none. What was the purpose of the tree? To bring forth fruit. Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard. Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down. Why cumberereth the ground? I am the vine, and my father is the husbandman. There's the image of a vine which furnishes energy to the branches and the branches are to bear the fruit. But the father is the husband. He's the caretaker of the vine. And here we see this image of one who plants a fig tree and he has one who cares for the tree and he's asking why is there no fruit. So he says just cut it down. But now notice the intercession. And he answered and said unto him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dung it. &gt;&gt; Right? This is an analogy of our lives, &gt;&gt; right? Sometime, don't you feel dug up and dunged, right? &gt;&gt; That's how Mondays are, right? That's how some days feel. This is what life feels like sometimes. Being dug up, uprooted, dug about, pruned, purged, dunged, and it bear fruit well. And if not, then after that, thou shalt cut it down. So when things are getting stinky and things aren't going well, it's a process of God doing something in your life in order to stimulate your ability to be fruitful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says in Hebrews 12:1, "Now no chastening for the present seemth to be joyous, but grievious. Nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Raise your hand if you don't like exercise, but yet it's necessary. Right? &gt;&gt; Probably shouldn't have laughed that loud, but no correction, chastening, purging, or pruning is happy, but it hurts. It's painful, but it yields fruit. But who does it yield fruit to? Those who are exercised by the pain. This word exercise, it it comes from in the in the Greek being stripped down, laid bare, speaks of nakedness, which is associated with weakness and death. And that what happens when we're corrected, what happens when we suffer, we feel weak, we feel vulnerable, uh we're laid bare, we're stripped down. &gt;&gt; But that's ne it's saying it's that's necessary in order to yield fruit, &gt;&gt; right? Just as a tree which is ordained to bring forth good fruit. It's not just planted and then left alone and it's going to grow and be fruitful. No thorns and briars and all sorts of things will attack it. It'll become malnourished. It'll be crowded out. And so there's a Holy Spirit that goes through your life. It digs about it. It dung it. God uses the word. He uses ministries. He uses all sorts of things and allows things to happen. And instead of looking at as the process of cutting us off and casting us into the furnace, we have to recognize that this is the way that the husbandman ordains us to become fruitful. &gt;&gt; And it cannot happen by leaving us alone. &gt;&gt; We have to be exercised, stripped down, laid bare in the process. I think this is a good analogy. In the process of muscle development, what happens when you're when you do resistance training or lift weights? You're inflicting trauma on your muscles, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Some say it's it's micro tears. You're ripping or tearing your muscles, but it is some sort of trauma to a muscle which activates this process of repair and replacement. And that's how obviously you get muscles. That's how you build strength. &gt;&gt; It first has to suffer injury. &gt;&gt; We're just using it in terms because you can you can do it to the point to where it's no longer productive, &gt;&gt; right? And so when God prunes a tree, he doesn't go up there and just hatch it down and cut it down. No, there's there's a there's a science to it, if we could say that. When it comes to uh resistance training and building muscles, you're you're you're causing this uh uh this stimulus, it's a process of these muscles and adapting uh to take on more stimulus leading to growth. And one of the keys to that, I think, is where the analogy works very well, is you you lift maybe to failure. And there's got to be strain. There's got to be stress, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's why I haven't gained weight. No matter how big the sandwich is, I eat, right? I'm lifting. I mean, I'm what? I hunch. I I have the form. Everything's there. I take my plate to the sink, right? I eat to failure, &gt;&gt; but that doesn't that's not going to do it for building muscle. It builds bulk, trust me, but it won't build muscle. And so, there has to be strain. There some ways has to be failure. There has to be an exertion. There has to actually be, and I'm not trying to encourage everybody to go out and rip their muscles up, but there has to be some sort of trauma or it's some people called a threat. The muscles have to feel threatened &gt;&gt; and say, "Woo, we better be ready next time." &gt;&gt; Oh, right. &gt;&gt; We better repair and replace because the next time we feel that stress, we want to break past that. &gt;&gt; You following me? &gt;&gt; This is it. Now, I say this all for the gym rats that are here. uh that that this is that process of building our muscles. But if you really want to build your muscles, you there has to be rest &gt;&gt; because if you don't rest, you can injure yourself. &gt;&gt; The muscles won't have a chance to repair and replace. And so God, that's just an analogy of what God does in our lives where there's times of stress, there's times of trial, there's times of fighting, but God's going to allow the rest so that you can build up faith muscle. So the next time you face that test, &gt;&gt; that stimulus, the provoking, the threat, the trauma, faith says, "Woo, here we go." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's a new PR, &gt;&gt; but the rest is needed. In Ecclesiastes chapter 3:10, I've seen the travail which God have given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. There's a lot to be read in the scriptures about exercise. The Bible says, "Bodily exercise profitth little." I know that uh a lot of us could use that as an excuse not to exercise at all, but a little profit is still some profit. &gt;&gt; But it does even speak to how sometimes our theatrics, bodily theatrics, when it comes to church worship, &gt;&gt; doesn't move the needle with God. &gt;&gt; But he's seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. That means afflicted or bowed down, weakened. I've seen the travail that exercises mankind. I've seen how it presses on them and they endure it and they're weakened by it. They're bowed down. They suffer trauma. They're threatened by it. They suffer all these micro tears. This exercising by travail in Hebrews 5:14, "But strong meek belongth to them that are full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil." There has to be exercise. There has to be a a laying bare. There has to be an affliction. There has to be a bowing down. There has to be a weakening, a press, a pressure, a trauma, a threat. You don't get strong. You don't grow. You don't develop properly. As brother man might say, in a hot house plant &gt;&gt; in a sterile environment. One of the reasons why we have more sicknesses and diseases now more than ever is we try to create everything so sterile. &gt;&gt; And some of the advice at one time was just go eat some dirt, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Get your gut back in balance. We don't eat enough dirt. We don't eat enough bugs anymore as kid little kids. We used to be outside playing and doing certain things. And there used to be a lot of things that we would uh face and we'd be tested with and we build up an endurance to. This is the pattern we see in the scripture that strong meat belongs to the mature who have had to suffer, who have had to exercise, who've had to have been threatened, who have have been in situations where maybe they fell or they got hurt, but they learned from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They repaired and replaced and the next time they found themselves in that situation that they were the ones who could handle the strong meat, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You've heard the phrase no no pain no gain goes all the way back to ancient Greek poetry. One poet wrote, "But before the road of excellence, the immortal gods have placed sweat." If there's going to be excellence, there's going to be glory. There's travail. There's p uh there's there's testing. &gt;&gt; There's a Hebrew expression, according to the pain is the reward. It's only through exercise that we're rewarded. One poet wrote in the 1600s, "If little labor, little are gains, man's fortune, fortunes is according to his pains." These are just observances. If you want a little, just labor little and you'll get little gains, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But your fortunes, your fate, your reward is according to your pains. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 11:34, on these heroes of faith, it says they quenched the violence of fire. They escaped the edge of the sword. Out of weakness were made strong. Wax valiant and fight. Turned to flight the armies of the aliens. You could read this. They quenched. They escaped. They were valiant and fight. They turned to flight the armies of the aliens. But right in the middle, this seeming to be this hub between these four different great momentous victories is they were made strong through weakness. Before their victory, they had to have affliction. They had to undergo necessity before overcoming, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They could not just walk into a battle clean, refreshed, innocent, and pure and go out there and go, "Oh, look at these nice, well-dressed warriors coming to me. Hi, how are you doing?" No, they had to suffer. Did recognize the moment, the call, what was at risk, what was at hand. Brother Brandham says this, even referring to this very scripture here in perfect strength by perfect weakness. Anybody here listen to this or read this within the last month or two? Maybe a couple of you, maybe none of you. Perfect strength by perfect weakness. They had to get weak before they could get strong. &gt;&gt; This is this is his commentary on Hebrews 11:34. They had to get weak before they could get strong. Out of their weakness, they were made strong. How did they quench the violence of fire? They knew what fire was. How did they escape the edge of the sword? They'd felt the edge of it before. They could appreciate it. They knew what it was. How' they wax valiant in the fight? They weren't afraid of fighting because they'd been in it. But they turned to flight the armies of the aliens. These are all the things they had to first though become strong through weakness. And he says, "Here's something to console us. Here's something that encourages. Out of weakness and humility, God chooses the people to build his kingdom out of. If we ever get to heaven, if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church, he'll stand in a we'll stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and know it nothings. &gt;&gt; Not know it alls, know it nothings. &gt;&gt; If we make it to heaven, we stand in the presence of God with his bride. We will stand with a bunch of people that are weak, rejected, cast out, and knoweth nothings. &gt;&gt; No doubt that's the vantage point of the world. They look at you as weak, &gt;&gt; brainwashed, &gt;&gt; rejected, cast out by the world to know it nothings. But he says he begins to build a character, begins to take this weakness and make his own self. &gt;&gt; What does it take? It takes that weakness. &gt;&gt; The world looks at it, scoffs at it, laughs at it. They call it weakness. They would say that's not living. In 1 Corinthians chapter 1 18-31 says for for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness. So actually to those who die who succumb to death and it's uh it's rotten process it's foolishness. The preach of the cross is foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God &gt;&gt; life and death. For it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. What is it that's destroyed and comes to nothing? Those that think they're wise. Those that think they're something. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where's the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? Paul has stood in those argument circles. &gt;&gt; He stood before the philosophers? He stood before the poets? He stood in the halls of those that discussed these great matters pertaining to life. Said, "Who's the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God. It pleased God by foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. Then he gets into the dynamics of all belief systems and what people their worldviews and what they value. The Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified. Unto the Jews a stumbling block because they want signs and the Greeks uh and the Greeks foolishness. But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. And then notice verse 25. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. Not that God is weak, but that which men perceive as weakness. Why? Why use why use dynamics like this on a Wednesday night to strengthen his people? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Why use this? We might say, well, this is what the world calls foolishness. These are antiquated precepts. This is a this is an old way of trying to convey thoughts that we probably shouldn't use it. It's more efficient, costefficient, and you can monetize it a lot better if you just do podcast. If you just do shorts, if you just get on to some of the social media and make sure people mash that like button and click the sub subscribe. There's a lot of other ways people may think this gospel can be packaged. But yet God has ordained what the world calls foolishness &gt;&gt; to bring the power of deliverance. &gt;&gt; That's weakness. They say, but this is stronger than men. For you see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called. God usually chooses the weak, the debase, the rejected. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. And God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, mighty in this world, great in wisdom. God has this inverse to where it's the weak things and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen. Yay, the things which are not to bring bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence. That's his reason for doing it. If he chose somebody smart, then they may say it's the smarts, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If that's all he ever chose was the smart ones, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If all if if there was a certain metric that we could distill it down to, so it was everybody that was born in this local at this age and does this and does that and acts this way and does that way, then we would put it all into those physical attributes, those intellectual prowess or whatever it might be. And God says, "I I'm going to use the fullness of the preaching through so many different ways and means and personalities that you can't ascribe it to any particular human or fleshly attribute because no flesh will glory in his presence. But of him are ye in Christ whom God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written, he that glorifi glorif glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." What God calls strong, the world calls weak. &gt;&gt; And what the world says strong, God looks at it and says that's weak. &gt;&gt; In the sermon, perfect strength by perfect weakness, brother said it's the simplicity of the gospel that staggers the people. They want something great. Let's be careful. Even as message believers, we see just how extraordinary prophecy is fulfilled. We see the great signs and wonders performed. uh uh we read of and we've seen great signs and wonders and there's ways that the ministry was so vindicated in brother Bon's ministry. There's a lot that we get focused on. We think, "Oh, this is so great. This ought to be this should go to the Vatican. This should be published this way. Everyone should be able to believe that this this should be presented in such a way where the all the critics and all the skeptics have to accept it. But that's not how God works." &gt;&gt; It's the simplicity of it that staggers the people. They try to make it a great intellectual something another when it's the simpleness. But God, this is so amazing. But God takes the very tool of humility and weakness and simplicity to work his works with you. That's only a tool in God's hand. Humiliation is a tool being exercise suffering and affliction. Tools of humility and weakness and simplicity. These are tools that God can work with. In 2 Corinthians chapter 6:es 1-10, if we just look at it from the standpoint of what staggers people, what stumbles people, he says, 'We then as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. For he saith, I have heard thee, in a time accepted, and the day of salvation have I helped thee, secured thee. Behold, now is the accepted time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. Verse three, giving no offense in anything. Does this mean that ministers of God live perfect lives and are so blessed to where everyone know you know that's a minister because you could tell their car doesn't have a ding in it. No scratch, right? They they they wear the nicest clothes. They have the softest of leathers, right? Everything's just perfect. And you just kind of walk by and you just feel like, "Oh my goodness, the presence of God is so great." And that's how we know because they get there's no offense in anything. Everyone just loves them, right? Eat for free everywhere. giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed. But now notice what he begins to say because this this blame on the ministry isn't that they're without suffering, without persecution. He says, "But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, acting above, conducting ourselves in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, and imprisonments, and tumults, and labors, and watchings, and fastings." Okay. Uh all right. I had only first read up to verse three and maybe a little bit there and approving all things and being good and we're all good, right? And give honor or double honor to the preachers, right? Never live any higher than your pastor teaches, right? Yes. I'm going to at least establish the ceiling here. This says in all things such as afflictions, necessities, distresses, stripes, imprisonments, tomos, labors, watchings, fastings. But then there's this other sides. By puress, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report, as deceivers and yet true, as unknown and yet well-known, as dying and behold, we live. As chastened and not killed. Quite the life. Quite the life of those who are called to truth. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This is not just a calling for ministers. This is not just those who are called to be fellow laborers as he's saying we working together are to give no offense in anything as the ministry uh uh is to not be blamed but this blame has nothing to do with what you suffer. &gt;&gt; This blame does not have to do with the fact that oh well look there's afflictions, there's necessities, there's death. There's people that keep a running roll of the the people who've lost spouses and children a a and suffered sicknesses and cancer and they use it as a mark against their ministry. &gt;&gt; Wow. Well, that's exactly the reason why people rejected Jesus. &gt;&gt; Fact that he died. &gt;&gt; It's one of the biggest marks they put on brother Brandham is the manner in which he died &gt;&gt; by puress though by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love and fame. In the midst of afflictions, necessities, distresses, stripes, imprisonments, tumults, labors, watchings, fastings, dying, and behold, we live as chastened and not killed. As sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things. What a paradox. Could it be that these afflictions, necessities, distresses, stripes, imprisonments, tols, labors, watchings is what brings the puress, the knowledge, the kindness, the longsuffering, the love unfeigned, the power of God. The armor of righteousness is what brings honor through dishonor, good report through evil report. Though accused of being a deceiver, yet true, unknown, yet well-known, dying, and behold, we live as chastened and not killed. sorrowful yet rejoice and is poor yet making many rich though not maybe themselves and has nothing I have nothing but it's in that nothing that I actually possess all things &gt;&gt; that's life by death in 1 Corinthians 12 18 to 24 says but now God hath set the members every one of them in the body by one spirit we're all baptized into one body this analogy of the human body is used to describe the body of Christ but then You are also that body individually &gt;&gt; as a human body as a human. These same things apply to your existence. So there's a lot of levels that you can apply this on. But God has tempered the body together. He's made you a certain way with certain parts and functions within your body. There's this high level view of the body of Christ in the same way. And if they were all one member, where were the body? But now are they many members yet one body? And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee. Nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Okay. Much more those members of the body which seem to be more weak, more feeble, more inferior. &gt;&gt; Less useful are necessary. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things in our lives. I'm great. I'm strong. I can do this. I can do that. And why can't I enjoy this? Why can't I have that? Why am I not used for this? Why why can't I always be on the mountain top? Says, well, there's times in our lives, there's parts of your character. There's parts in your personality, your experience that we think, oh, well, what about the great things? What about the grandeur? What about these these these lofty parts of the head and the eye? But he says there's these things that are weaker. &gt;&gt; They seem to be uh unnecessary, but they are necessary. They're needed. &gt;&gt; And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor. And our uncumbly parts have more abundant comeliness. Notice how he's saying this. The parts that are ugly is what brings forth the greatest beauty. I have a place in this local church for our coming parts have no need. But God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which lacked. This weakness is necessary for power. This feebleness is necessary. We need weaknesses. It's this way in the body. It's this way in the body of Christ. And he's saying that this more abundant beauty comes from that necessity. We say every part beautiful, every part strong. Well, what what kind of monster would that create? You realize God, this master, this creator knows beauty and symmetry. And he said here that these parts that seem to be weak were necessary. The parts that seem to be ugly are the ones that bring forth the great beauty. Brother Brandman's sermon, Perfect Strength by Perfect Weakness, says get weak. What's that phrase? Get wrecked or something that people tell you, you know, stay humble, stay low. But he says, "Get weak. Find out you're human." &gt;&gt; Hello. Okay. Need to remember that one, &gt;&gt; right? For myself. Get weak. Find out you're human. This is what we've got to do. We've got to get weak. Find out we're human. Find out these human weaknesses. &gt;&gt; And there's none of your intellectuals can do. Human weakness will never be used of God. Human weaknesses will never be used of God. I know that may seem if you know the sermon that's quite an eye-catching statement. God by the human weaknesses pours himself into you. So it's not that we can say well I am so glad that I am so flawed that God has a full arsenal to use but rather he God by the weakness wants to pour himself into you. So you have to make use of you have to make use of the weakness to yield &gt;&gt; not defend. &gt;&gt; I I read an analogy one time that it it helped me to understand this point that was trying to be made because really when we think about God making himself known and even I mentioned it on Sunday how that the evil in this world is the absence of God but it's that which is declaring his presence. It's how that we know him is because of that great contrast. And and I read one time this analogy of two people being locked in prison and there being a prison wall that separated them and they communicated by knocking on that wall. And the very thing that separate them separated them was the very means through which they communicated. &gt;&gt; And so when we look at our lives, we think of the separation. We think of the pain. We think of all these things we go through and this suffering and these weaknesses. though the weakness has to be there. And it's not the it's not that the weakness is what God wants to use, but it's necessary in order for God to use us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because then he pours himself into you. Then he uses himself. He says, you just become an instrument. I know we've all been called a tool once or twice, but here he says you're an instrument. Certainly, you've got to get yourself out of the way. &gt;&gt; We've always said that about the preacher, but it's about you. &gt;&gt; You've got to get yourself out of the way. 2 Corinthians chapter 13:es 1 to10. Since you seek proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you word is not weak, but is mighty in you. Ju um if you could just stay stay focused with me. We're not going to be too much longer here. This scripture here has got a lot a lot to wrestle with, but I hope I can just use it through this theme that brother Brandon preaches in perfect strength to see this. You want proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you is not weak, but it's powerful in you. The gospel, the preaching of the cross, but yet he suffers. He talks about all his sufferings and what he's endured. Chapter six, he talks about his distresses and necessities and afflictions. I don't know that he had a complex, but he was certainly conscious of all the things he's going through. He says, "For though he," speaking of Christ, he was crucified through weakness. Now really wrap like like focus on that. Ponder that for a little bit. He was crucified through weakness. Yet he liveth by the power of God. Brought low, laid in a grave, crucified on the cross through weakness, but yet then lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, &gt;&gt; but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you. &gt;&gt; So there's this. He was made an example of us for us. crucified through weakness that the power of God can live through him. But now we are weak in him. We have to become weak in him that we can live with him by the power of God towards us. So he says, "Examine yourselves whether you be in the faith. Prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves how that Christ is in you except you be reprobates. &gt;&gt; But I trust ye shall know that we are not reprobates." Now I pray to God that you do no evil. I want you to see this alternating theme of good and evil through these. Not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. This is the just man who wants to be good, not just appear good. &gt;&gt; This is the one that wants to be right, wants to know truth, not just appear so. &gt;&gt; You should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates, though we may seem to suffer, though we not have these best places and opportunities. He says, "For we could do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. For we are glad when we are weak and you're strong." This is how Paul is making the gospel beneficial to them. This also we wish even your perfection. Therefore, I write these things being absent lest present I should be I should use sharpness according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction. God makes strength out of weakness. &gt;&gt; Christ was crucified through weakness. The Corinthian church is receiving strength through weakness. Jacob received power of God. Received power to be called a prince with God after he had wrestled and was afflicted. &gt;&gt; He had to wrestle it out all night. He had to suffer. Paul's education, theology were stripped away from him in order for him to become a prophet to the Gentiles. He didn't emerge from the schools of the Pharisees. He didn't emerge blameless in the law. He didn't emerge from that and just one day uh step forward as this one who was killing and crucifying a and putting us under the children of God and all of a sudden said, "Well, you know what? I just kind of changed my mind. &gt;&gt; This is right." And how many people have tried to take that p just do a full 180 and say, "You know what? I know I did it for decades, said this was true, but now it's not true. And let's just kind of keep this good thing going if we could." Sure. &gt;&gt; But he had to suffer in order to become that apostle. &gt;&gt; If you look into the scripture, whether it be in Hebrews 11, and I can especially say this here where he says, "Christ was crucified through weakness. In every instance, if I could put it this way, the thing that ought have sunk the ship kept it afloat." In every instance, the means by which it was to be destroyed brought it life. Kill them, bury them, put them in the ground. What did he do? He just multiplied. &gt;&gt; Christ was crucified through weakness, but it was necessary to bring God's power. &gt;&gt; In Acts 4:es 23-31, I use this scripture just to point out this remarkable uh interruption in the flow of this narrative. The church is gathered together and they hear about the the the persecutions and the and the threatenings that are coming to the early church there at Jerusalem. And being let go, they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said under the threat the punishment could come to them. And they when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, Lord, thou art God which hath made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David has said, why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things? &gt;&gt; Why are they breathing out these threatenings? Why are they threatening to put it kill us? Why are they telling us to no longer preach in the name of Christ? The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ. For of a truth against the holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel were gathered together. It's quite a um a league, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Herod, Pilate, Gentiles, Israel, they're all gathered against Christ. So, here they are. They're all gathering. And what do they have? They have one purpose to destroy Christ. Verse 28 says, "For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done." That interrupts it. &gt;&gt; They all gathered against Christ and they stood up against him to kill Christ, to put him in a grave. And you stopped it. He says, "No. Uh-uh. To do whatever you had determined beforehand." God did not deprive Christ of this suffering or this affliction. God does not deprive us from adversity or affliction, but he uses it to fulfill his purpose. &gt;&gt; When they had gathered together, we would expect it to say that he stopped their hands. But they did whatever God had ordained. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings. They succeeded in crucifying Christ. And now, this is the example that they now use is now we're being threatened. And he says, "Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak the word. Do they're not praying. Let them no longer threaten us, but in the face of the threats, in the face of the affliction, in the face of the threat of crucifixion, just like Christ, let me stand firm even as he did." &gt;&gt; You don't have to give me a vision that I will not face temptation. You don't have to give me a vision that I will not be persecuted. You don't have to give me a vision that I will not suffer trial or trauma or afflict injury. But Lord, give me boldness to declare thy word &gt;&gt; by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of the holy child Jesus. When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness. &gt;&gt; Because they were willing to brave it. &gt;&gt; They were willing to face it. Christ was an example of us for us. &gt;&gt; So in the face of it, they said we have to be faithful unto death. In the face of this, God's not going to deprive us. He's not going to take adversity and cast it down. It's going to hit us. &gt;&gt; It's going to come. So they prayed, "Lord, give us boldness." And when they were willing to accept the weakness, &gt;&gt; the power of God fell. Brother Abram said, "Get empty, friends. &gt;&gt; Get weak." He says, "Get weak. Find out you're human." Now he says, "Get empty, friends. Get weak. Deny your own ability. Empty yourselves out. Pour out upon God's altar. Pour yourselves out upon God's altar as a sacrifice. Let the angel come with the cold of fire. Fill that vessel with the power of the almighty God. And then he'll make you strong. And listen, he will give you grace to stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I hope I could say I want to be able to say this. I think there's sometimes it's just so difficult to articulate. If God asked us stand to asked us to stand in line to receive a blessing and we knew we just had to wait in line, we would do it, right? &gt;&gt; I mean, come on. All of you who've waited in line for what? The iPhone two, the popup taco stand, right? Joe's Farm Grill in Gilbert. We've waited in line a long time for things, but we do it because we're going to have the honor and the privilege of checking in on Yelp and saying that we visited this place. We're going to be able to get Instagrammable pictures. And there's a lot that we'll endure for the clout. &gt;&gt; There's a lot we'll endure for the blessing, for the strength, and for the power. And if it was merely this glorious offering of ourselves to be commended in the eyes of the brethren to be welcomed into heaven and received as this great triumphant acceptor of Christ, you'd flood to it. But he doesn't ask you to just stand in line. He says take up the cross, &gt;&gt; deny yourself. &gt;&gt; And it's in the denying of self that becomes the rub. As a matter of fact, I believe that if he just asked you to simply be a martyr and that's all you had to do is be a martyr, you'd do it. But there's some denying yourself in the process. &gt;&gt; There's this process of of being stripped, laid bare, he says, get weak, get empty, find out you're human. And when you can empty yourself out all your vanity, all your pride, when you can be willing to feel that own debasement and recognize human weakness and that there's nothing in you that is good that you can offer to him by way of saying, you know what, I think you've done figured this out by now. He says, then he'll give you grace to stand. &gt;&gt; It's not standing in line. We could do that of our own accord, but when we're willing to just lay ourselves down completely useless and spent that his grace steps in and lifts us up. So Paul, he's using this used the scripture in the beginning in 2 Corinthians chapter 12. He said because of these great revelations I've had, he said he received a thorn in the flesh. Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything here. He has a thorn in the flesh because of the revelations is a necessary evil. And this is how we know it was necessary. He says, "For this thing," 2 Corinthians 12:8, "For this thing I besought the Lord three times that it might depart from me." You know, this is human, this is human nature. It doesn't come to us and we're like, "Oh, welcome, buddy, brother Thorne." You know, just kind of side up to me here, right? It there there's this offense. It hurts. He asks God to get it get it away from I did this three times. I sought the Lord, this thorn, this pain, this messenger of Satan, this evil that visited me. And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee. For my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. This is why Paul could say that that heaven is worth the hurting. What's waiting for us, the glory that's coming, it's worth the pain you're suffering. If we try to exempt, listen, if you try and you want and you beg and you plead to be exempt completely from it, you're only robbing yourselves of levels of glory. &gt;&gt; You're asking for a temporary reprieve from something now in the hopes that it'll feel better now. But listen, all that God will allow to happen to you. I know it's as if it's empty when you're really going through it. And I say this with everything that's in me. As much as you hear about the glory and the power and the wisdom of Christ and the bride is overcoming and every devil's under our feet and there the bride is rising up and she's a marching army and she's undefeated and yet you feel the pains of loss and defeat on a daily basis. Don't ask for God to take away the trial. Don't ask him to take away the trauma and the injury, but God build my faith through it &gt;&gt; because it's worth it. My grace is sufficient for thee. My strength is made perfect in weakness. It'll come to finishing. Most gladly, this is now. Paul says,"Most gladly, therefore, I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me." How could he say that? The one necessitated the other. It was power by weakness, life by death, abundance through suffering, possessing through lacking. Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities. in the reproaches, in necessities, and persecutions, and distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. &gt;&gt; Listen for ourselves. How can we escape this force of evil? It's a weight. It's a pressure. It's in the atmosphere. How can I bear these wounds? How can I suffer this nakedness? How can I feel this emptiness? &gt;&gt; How can I handle the hurting? How how am I how am I going to navigate loss? How do I navigate death? How how do I navigate divorce? How do I navigate baroness? How do I navigate rejection? How how do I navigate all these things that make me feel vexed, anxious, hurting, rejected, all these reproaches and necessities and distresses. I saw it put one time that every sin is an attempt to avoid emptiness. Every sin is an attempt to avoid feeling vulnerable. Every sin is an attempt to try to satisfy some ego, some pride of eye. But in love, this I'm just coming to my final emphasis here. In love, we must consent to this suffering. As brother Brandham is teaching, in perfect strength by perfect weakness, we must consent to cease to be anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that God may become everything to us. &gt;&gt; There must be this unconditional surrender to be nothing in our flesh. It's a mastering the thought of human ability. It's getting ourselves out of the way. I'll come to that statement here in a moment, brother John. Without brother Bam says that Christ began in this humility without this utter humility all our works all our acts all our strengths these are things that brother Bram's teaching us are subject to the law of sin and death he says we have to master the thought of human ability well why would I need to do that we can offer nothing short of ourselves But it has to be we have to come empty and to die I'll say it this way to die to ourselves to master the thought of human ability to be exposed uh uh naked and defenseless we must be willing to endure life's wounds. We have to be willing to face the fangs of life's bites. &gt;&gt; We have to be willing to endure the pains of life, exposed, defenseless, ready to endure all the wounds of life. You have to be willing to accept, as Paul says, necessities, reproaches, persecutions, distresses. We must accept all those things in Romans 8, the emptiness, the ine inequalities, the the unequal balances. We must not be bent on revenge or recompense. We shouldn't be living for compensation. We must be willing to suffer it. And brother says, "Above all, we must master the thought of human ability." &gt;&gt; Listen, in your brokenness, in your weakness, in your vulnerability, in your emptiness, he says, "By by strength is made perfect in weakness." I hope I can convey this in my in in summarizing this. How life by death, &gt;&gt; right? We look around and we see the evil. Let's if you could just I just say, "God, help me now to be able to deliver this because it's it'll be liberating for someone. It &gt;&gt; it'll get the foot of the devil off your back, off your neck. &gt;&gt; Give me the courage to stand up in the face of great oppression, in the face of great loss. It'll give you courage to know that the very reason why this age is as nasty and as dark and as evil as it is, is because there's got to be the greatest light that's ever shined before. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the law of the negative and the positive. It's the very light the contrast. &gt;&gt; And it's the very evil that's going to bring out the greatest good in you. &gt;&gt; And when we're empty, when we're vulnerable, when we're weak, we got to master the thought of humility. And as we empty out, it's your human nature that wants to fill that back in. &gt;&gt; You don't want to feel empty. &gt;&gt; You don't want to feel lost. You want to feel rejected. And when you have to master the thought of human ability, if God if God values brokenness, if it's through weakness he's made strong, then there has to be that nakedness. &gt;&gt; But we try to clothe ourselves with fig leaves, &gt;&gt; he can't cover us. When we're emptied out, when our weakness, when we yield to that weakness, when we accept when we're the the buffets of life, and we we accept all these things that we have to endure, and we've mastered the thought of human ability to cover, to fill, then his strength is made perfect. But it's your human ability that perpetually fills the cracks in your life, the voids, the emptiness, and all those fissures in your life through which God's grace wants to flow. Because he says, "My grace is sufficient." But the only way that grace can get to you is if you let that part be vulnerable. The only the only way grace can fill up is when you acknowledge you're empty. The only way it can heal is when you know you're broken. &gt;&gt; And we master the thought of human ability. Why? Because human ability is so good at uh spiritual ninjutsu, right? You'll never let it get in. You never make yourself vulnerable. It's one of those things where even when we're faced in certain situations, we want to appear to be in control. We want to have everything uh just right and and impress and do all sorts of posturing. But when you're just willing to be laid bare, it's then that grace can make you stand. He says that's it's then that grace makes you stand. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Get weak, get empty." This is that statement, Brother John, Brother Micah, you, Brother Elliot, you guys can come to the instruments. Get weak, get empty. Notice how many times he says that. Especially the one where he says, "Uh, you recognize that you're human. Get weak, find out you're human." Why would he say that to us? Why Why would he ask us to find out we're human? Isn't that obvious that we're human? But there's something about being human that we could even turn around, well, I I'm this and I'm that and I've got these qualities. I got this redemptive ability. Find out you're human. Get weak. Get empty. Empty all up. And from then on, it'll keep dropping and God will do the rest of the dropping. You just do that. I I say this to you tonight. I I read these words to you as from the prophet to our moment right now. You just drop to your knees and receive that with all your heart. Drop in your heart right now and say, "God, I believe it with all my heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God will take care of the rest of the drops. He said, "It'll be filled up. You shall be refilled." refilled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Why has grace only flowed so far in our lives? Because we we damned up the cracks through which grace wants to flow. &gt;&gt; We we we've we've built up the bull works of our brokenness through which grace wanted to seep through. &gt;&gt; We postured and we pretensed. We've prided and we populared ourselves all to this this way of I want to appear good. But Paul says, "Does it matter if you appear as a reprobate? Does it matter if you appear broken? Does it matter if you appear wasted and distressed? If God's grace can flow to you in that moment and through whatever it is that you're enduring, whatever it is you're going through, the very means by which God impressed upon me as I was there in Michigan to speak on these very things was the reality that if it may may not be all of us, but maybe one of us and one person is worth every effort in the ministry of the word of God that in the the the darkness and the evil and the hurt and the loss that we experience that in that brokenness and vulnerability and emptiness, if you'll just yield to him, and just empty yourself out. Own up. I'm nothing, Lord. I can't get myself out of this. I'm broken. Recognize where you get things wrong. It's the grace of God when he punishes us for our disobedience. God will take care of the rest. It'll be filled up. But when we fill it up through our own ability, that's the that's the worship of I. All right. &gt;&gt; If we're if we don't offer out of that brokenness, that unconditional surrender, that mastering, that conquering self, that dying daily, then whatever we offer is just a it it it's a label that we attached to me. &gt;&gt; It's a label I've attached to I. But the only way that you can have life is by death. And that's what it means to die daily. So therefore, we can as children of God embrace our brokenness because God loves it. Contrite spirit he'll not despise. With all the preaching of perfection and all the ambitions that we have to be without sin, all the ambitions we have to defeat death and triumph over death, your way to that is going to be through perpetual death. And not through a perpetual filling up of the void by your own means, but to be completely emptied out. to experience so much debaseness and depravity and emptying out to where it's in that void that you come to know God as he truly is. Not through religion, but as he truly is. It's life by death. If we could stand together, what are you playing for my Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, tonight as we close this service in prayer and we bring to an end this service through its breadth, Lord, and maybe it was a lot, but I pray that you would encourage us as brother Bram emphasized in that sermon. Let this be an encouragement to us. And I know these are things that are maybe uh it's not uncommon to hear preach. We've heard it through the years many times, but I I believe it just bore repeating tonight, Lord. [Music] That the way up is down. And then when it feels as if we're being beaten, torn, purged, dug up, and dunged, may we not forget that that this is your way of bringing life. Lord, I want to face these trials of life bravely. When things aren't going well, I I want to be able to say, "It's well with my soul." When when relationships go sideways, when pressure gets turned up, I I want to I don't want to panic, I want to say, Lord, I I know you'll see me through to the end. I know I'll be cast I may be cast down, but not forsaken. I know I may endure a lot, but I know I have this excellency in earth and vessels that this glory, this treasure is heavenly and nothing can take it away. Lord, may we realize that it's our trying to use human weakness in ourselves or ignore the brokenness and the vulnerabilities, rationalize the pain through our numbness that we're unable to experience the grace that you so desire to be sufficient in our lives. So today, Lord, I acknowledge my weakness and I confess that your grace is enough. That where I could just yield in my brokenness and my Lord, I I accept to endure all of life's difficulties to be exposed naked to the trials of this life that your power may rest upon me that your grace may be sufficient. not as a martyr, not as one that would use it as an excuse to be vanquished and to be defeated, but as one who trusts you and believes that your power can rest upon me. Bless everyone that was here tonight who had need of these things. If we find ourselves in a place of great comfort, we're in a season of rest. Lord, may we store up these things for the moment when we need it. But Lord, maybe we be that voice there even in Acts four where the pe children, your children just cried out and said, "Lord, give us boldness to speak." Lord, in our time of rest, may we be instruments that you can use now, now that we've had our trauma, we've had the injury, we've rested it, our muscles are being repaired and restored, and we have these bigger faith muscles. May we use that as Paul did to strengthen others, to be a light and a witness, and a testament to those who are hurting, who need it. And we ask all this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
