TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you could just do your best to uh stay focused this evening and and concentrate on the word of the Lord I think it'll be a blessing to you and and something that to encourage us my title is out of dust and I'm including in this title out of dust kind of this dot dot dot this ellipses to uh suggest that there's more to this subject and maybe we'll pick up on it in another service here soon but it is connected with God rebuilding uh the temple God restoring uh uh Egypt and God Redeeming the excuse me restoring Israel and God Redeeming the bride there's these elements of the body of Christ being rebuilt and the temple being restored and God redeeming Israel so those different uh elements we've been looking at in the word of God and so they fit in the house of God being built again and I want to take this tonight just as introductory on the subject uh out of dust now I want to use this definition of dust it would just be our book definition something you could find in Webster or the uh free dictionary online it's a fine uh dry particle or the Fine Dry particles of the earth and it's dust in that it's so light that it can be carried away by the wind uh tossed about Blown Away very easily and that's what we're referring to we talk about dust it's these fine particles very light can be uh uh just blown away in just a second and dust is used to symbolize mortal life it's the very Elementary substance of the human body in Genesis 2: s it says the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so tells us that our physical bodies are made of dust we come from dust that word there dust in the Hebrew is dry loose Earth it speaks it's used of Ashes or debris it actually to say about dust it's just rubbish and in the emology of even our English word dust it comes from the old German and some of the European languages of mist or Vapor or smoke that's what dust even represents sometimes you'll see a a dust on the horizon and think it's smoke or you may see something it looks Misty or cloudy that's what dust is and the Bible says that man is made of the Dust of the ground just ashes just debris rubbish uh find particles that in themselves have no weight or no real substance and then when God is speaking uh to man it after the fall says in Genesis 3: 19 in the sweat of thy face sh thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground and it says for out of it was thou taken f for dust Thou Art and un dust shalt thou return God revisits this man should recognize that in his human body in his person uh he came from the ground he came from the the ashes of the earth he came from the debris he came from just rubbish we call it just dirt from the mud and it says that you're going to eat bread until you go right back into the ground again for Out of the Dust you came and and under the dust you will return it even revisit in Ecclesiastes 3:20 all go into one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again that's thought we could say as the the church in Kansas sings All We Are is Dust in the Wind and and this dust represents the cycle of Life uh uh that we we come from dust and we live out these lives extraordinary lives just being dust just coming from the dirt coming from the ground and this as we return back to this all are dust and all turn to dust again this dust represents the cycle of life where we come from into life into being right back to death again and it and and it just quickly uh goes away just as if it were dust uh being blown away by the wind and James chapter 4:14 he even refers to this whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanisheth away to say that life is like Vapor to hearken back to the fact that we're just dust particles that were made up of dust it's a it's that mist it's that Vapor it's just a smoke and that it it's here one day and it appears for a little while but then it just blows away it just vanishes away as if With the Wind then job says it in Job chapter 14 verses 1 to2 man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not just vaporizes someone can be here one day and then they're gone the next they're here and gone they they have substance they have form they have life they have uh they have an image you can relate to them you could talk to them you can interact with them but he's saying that uh soon enough they're here and then gone so he characterizes it in this ways James says it's just a vapor you appear a little time and then vanish he says a man born of a woman which we all are is of a a few days and full of trouble as I was looking at that word full of trouble it speaks of agitation or turmoil or trembling uh it's a raging and it gave me this picture of something just life just boils their life just boils it's full of trouble agitation turmoil raging uh it begins with birth it just heats up and heats up to the point to where it just begins to boil and boil and it boils long enough to where it just turns to mist and it vaporizes and think of it this way life is a pressure cooker and it just pressurizes till eventually it just goes away and as job said that man born of a woman his days are full of trouble and he's just a few days and it's like a flower that grows and it's cut down it's like a shadow that flees away that we no longer see it says in Job chapter 2: 7 and 8 and we've already read some things we'll just refer back to it here in a moment it says so went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord and smokee job with sore Bo oils from the sole of his foot unto his crown now if you call in chapter one he said stretch forth your hand on his life but don't touch his body and since Job maintained his Integrity Satan says well you know I think I could get get him to do his worst if you'll just let me touch his body and God says all right go ahead but don't take his life so here he is full of these olers these boils from the sols of his feet to the crown of his head over his entire body and he took him apost her to scrape himself with all and he sat down among the ashes just takes this broken bits of clay and he begins to scrape himself and itch himself says he sits down among the ashes he's as we say an ash Heap there's job and in chapter one job loses his sons his daughters are implied in there his servants his sheep his cattle the camels and all these things are gone in a moment and he maintains his Integrity but now his health is gone and as he sits there on these ashes scraping these boils it symbolizes the cycle of man's life of birth and then this living which is characterized by trouble and for job it maybe it's just all condensed into one uh one thing but if you live long enough you're going to lose loved ones you live long enough you're going to lose possessions you live long enough you're going to experience these kind of troubles but job sitting on these ashes scraping these boils it symbolized almost the whole cycle of man's life from birth to trouble to now death Jo just dust of the earth sitting on an ash sheap that even the dust of the earth is connected with as in Genesis 18:27 Abraham answered and said behold now I've taken upon me to speak unto the Lord which in but dust in ashes this is what he says about himself he realizes I'm just dust and Ash that's all that man is in his body and in his person he's just dust and Ashes I I I've come from the dust I'm made of dust and Ashes and as job sat upon those ashes scraping his boils it was just him uh sitting there in what would appear to be the end of life dust upon the ashes waiting to die as he says in job chter 30: 19 Heath cast me into the m and I am become like dust in ashes as you read the depictions of it even as some authors have embellished it and and not in an untrue sense but just labor to try to paint this picture of what it really would have looked like upon these Ash and these broken pieces and this postured scraping on his boils he would have looked like a corpse he would have been Ashen and Grave uh bowing into the dust of the Earth this would be one that all would be waiting this great man who had everything is now dying and as we would consider job in that particular instance I I want to in some way say that we can all on some level begin to empath empathize with job that in this pressure cooker of Life uh we may often feel that we're being vaporized we feel beset we feel pressed in uh we feel our Humanity we may feel just like dust just how easy it is for us to be pushed around just how easy it is uh just to be on the verge of Ruin and things that we loved taking away from us or things that we enjoyed being missing and just how uh how fragile life can be and job experienced a lifetime of Sorrows and well beyond what anyone we would know personally could say that they experienced in such a short period of time but yet his life represents something about man man is born of a woman is just a few days and full of trouble and and and job's troubles would we can begin to relate to as a man and as a woman that the things that he experienced and the relationships and loss and failure of Health that this is this represents the pressure cooker of life and in the sermon letting off the pressure I was listening to the one that brother Brandon preached in I think it's January of 1963 in Phoenix and at the beginning he's talking about uh even really before he gets into his preaching he's talking about job he's talking about the funeral that he did for uh Mrs Ford and he's saying how that job began to recognize it's in Job chapter 14 that well what happens you see something grow and it dies and he does does it live again what about man when he dies will he live again but then look at nature look at the Sun and look at all these things and he's drawing from this example but in the sermon letting off the pressure in those several places he preaches it he's referring to these things he says we're living in a neurotic age nervous tension and everyone said that ain't nothing but the truth brother brandom we're living in a neurotic age nervous tension everyone is racing here and going there and going nowhere and it seems like in Phoenix there's some of the worst it's just that kind of age and I know this church would be plagued with it as everywhere is plagued with it Tabernacles plagued with it everywhere the whole world so let's not act all you know big right like Arizona Believers Church a no pressure here but no we feel it nervous tension he said it's a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait right you it's a we we you speed through lights and you make these turns and you always use wav to make sure you got a shortcut and you end up in the same spot the guy that you blew past several lights ago right we're just hurrying up hurrying in hurry hurry hurry hurry and wait Drive 90 mes an hour and then get home for supper and wait two hours till it gets ready he said that's right he said it's the time we're living it's he says it's a time this is what we're living in now I want you to kind of catch as we can relate to the road rage and and those things but now it gets more real because he says and in that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension so let's just look at life on the outside of the home that the the things that exist that's not our house we're not trying to turn this world into our home this world is not our home but as we make our way in the world out there there's tension there's pressure there's demands there's deadlines there's benchmarks there's quotas there's all sorts of things that begin to bombard us and and even that you look at certain things that's required to get into college you look at certain things you're going to need to buy a house you look at all these different things and we're constantly feeling pressure from so many different sides just even with things that we might enjoy and make life easier there's just a cycle an upcycle where you got to upgrade and you got to trade things in and you're always in this fix do I get the new iPhone do I get the latest and greatest and which one do we you know I'm always Under Pressure always under tension and now it he shows how terrible this is he says it's rushing and speeding gets you to a nervous tension the wife says something a little contrary you want to fly off temper so it's just a little little something that the wife says and you blow up but it's not what she said that built the tension it's just tension's been building husband say something you'll Pat your foot and tell him to get in the room we don't have no idea what he's talking about right well now husband I don't want no words with you get out of there wife oh I'm so nervous so this is quite a scene there's this tension is blowing up he says why what's the matter all this together this tension building up then the result of it is doing something wrong and I love this and acting out of place some of us might have a particular disposition and we might seem to be a little rough and short tempered but you know what it's just tension that's making you act out of place it's not who you are as a Son of God that's not what you're called to be that's not who you are as a daughter of God but the tension gets to us he says the results of the pressure is doing something wrong and acting out of order that's the result of the pressure I think you could probably see how a lot of this ties into some of the things we've been ministering on he said that's right now to make the poor that way act that way it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich act that way come on rich people right it makes us it makes them all the poor the middle class the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way it'll make the good act that way ain't none of you got a right to be over there going right all of us and if you want to identify as the very good rich person fine you still get under pressure and act out of place he said because it's tension steam built up life just boils and it boils and steam begins to build up he says got to blow it out somewhere you don't if you don't you'll blow the boiler up now we find that it builds up and the day goes you talk to your boss if you're working oh so and so and if you speak to the kitty come in here Mama I'm right because you had some kind of back and forth with the boss there's certain things that if you interact with people all day long I'm sure that school teachers have this problem especially if they're in elementary school they're sitting there teaching kids all day long they come home they're going to teach the husband something right you're just in a mode you're just in that zone this is just the way you're deal with kids all day long you'll talk to an adult like a kid and so there's he's talking about this pressure building you have a disagreement with the boss so you come home and you're all upset with your kids he says there you are it builds up ooh my he says you feel like your head's going to come off he says I know this isn't a prophet just Discerning he said I'm with it every day so I know what it means it builds up he's felt pressure before remember the pressure of that lawyer those nasty lawyers putting pressure on them the phone calls to where he finally he kind of blew up and told his son to tell a lie and stepped out that's pressure it builds and it builds and it builds it's the life that we're living in I know it may seem like we're trivializing what job was going through but Satan said I want to put pressure on job and I bet I can get them to blow up if you'll just let me keep putting pressure on them and it says in 1 Peter chapter 5 as we're wanting this to relate to us we're going to read verses 6 to 11 and so as you as you look at this if you could put that up there 1 Peter chap 5: 6-1 all we start with verse six it says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time so this is what we've got to do first we got to Humble ourselves we have to Humble ourselves in the in the face of God who's great we don't get ourselves lifted up and as we humble ourselves he says if you humble yourself he will lift you up casting all your care upon him for he carth for you he does care but his care isn't going to matter to until you care it's not going to make a difference until you care he cares do you care casting all your care upon him for he carth for you be sober be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour job kind of pulls back the curtain on this now I know that as he discusses it with Jesus or God rather God's the one that mentions job uh but God Satan is walking about he he's roolling he's roaming about the Earth and he's doing it as an adversary your enemy and he isn't a roaring lion but he's as a roaring lion who's W making due use of every opportunity to destroy you to vaporize you to cause you to cease to be but it says cast all your cares on him for he cares for you these cares are those anxious thoughts about life take all these anxious thoughts about life cast him under the Lord and depend upon his Providence in all things that whatever it might be I know he's working all things for my good and as I cast all my cares on him it says be sober and this ties into the cares because these cares that are spoken of are the anxiety that is intoxicating to our spirits that because we are so consumed with it it drives us to do things it causes us to act it causes us to preserve it causes us to reach out it causes us to uh sometimes be paralyzed sometimes it causes us to run and it's exactly what brother bram's describing when he says we live in a neurotic age with nervous tension there's all this pressure building on us and it's the anxiety the pressure the building the building and as it builds it intoxicates us life is but a few days and full of agitation and rumbling and roiling and this extreme intoxication because of all the pressure pressures of our life and it says we've got to be sober in other words we need to be uh restrained recognizing that the the pressures from our adversary are to get us to act out of place to cause us to blow up to cause us to get into a spot where we're we're hurrying we're hurrying we're worrying we're acting up we're doing something wrong or acting out of place I hope you catch this picture that's being painted by these things so it's asking us to be restrained and sober yet Vigilant there's some Paradox in that if you say well I don't want to get worked up I don't want to be too nervous I don't don't want to be so worried about everything but yet we're to be vigilant sure sober restrained yet Vigilant looking watching brother bamman again in that same sermon said it's just becoming a neurotic age everybody's all built up haven't got no time people are always telling me I know you're so busy I know you're so busy and I'm like are they troll in me I'm not busy and but yet there's always something to do you haven't got no time and that builds up to a place that it breaks up things tension anxiety cares pressure building building it causes people to have hard feelings when they snap them off and say things you don't mean to say now everybody's guilty of it I'm guilty brother let's all clutch our message pearls he says I'm guilty what happening pressure building up we snap off and we say things we shouldn't say you're all guilty we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise so there's an excess pressure built up today pressure is what causes us to do things sometimes young people I say this for your grace uh uh parents all of us the reason why we do some of the things we do is because this pressure builds and we snap we're guilty of saying things we don't mean to say we do things under pressure we wouldn't normally do so we've got to be sober Vigilant he says before I go any further I might say this and I'm so glad he says this I believe it's the enemy coming down and press him I believe it's the devil just as it was with job where he says I I I'm I'm going to Target job and you've given me this permission I'm going to press job and I'm going to press him with the loss of uh his resources the loss of his children the loss of his health and I guarantee that if I press him enough I'm going to get him to snap and he's going to be guilty and brother brandham gives us this grace that some of us if we've been ill-tempered if we've been a little upset we've been a little bit uh Lusty or whatever it might be we got to recognize the world is working on us over time it's the devil with all this excess pressure building up brother man says I believe it's the devil and we know the coming of the Lord is at hand and the Bible says in the last days that the devil would would go about like a roaring lion so brother Bram brings us right to First Peter chapter 5 where the devil is pressing he's lurking he's trolling he's triggering he's doing all sorts of things to get us worked up he says if he could get you under pressure hurrying running over something you will make decisions that you wouldn't make if you sat down and think it over people sometimes are just always making decisions because the Press things happen they're feeling pressed they just kneejerk make a decision things press again they're in the habit of making a kneejerk decision and what we need to do sometimes when we feel impressed saying hold on I need to sober up first I don't want to make a decision in the time of this press in the time of this worry and this fear and I got to act quick to preserve myself I got to act quick to make these sure these things work out just slow down and start thinking it over so he said I think it's the devil the enemy coming down and pressing so as we're told to cast our cares upon the Lord to be sober and Vigilant he says we have this uh adversary walking about so verse 9 1 Peter chapter 5 continuing that 6 to 11:9 whom resist steadfast in the faith who's he talking about resist the devil knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world I know we like to think we're the only ones going through it we're the only ones that are facing it this econom is worse than others or this is hotter than others and this that he says but you we ought to recognize that we have no excuse to yield to it well no one knows what we're going through no one knows what we were having to experience and our our church has it different my family has it different if you knew my life if you knew what I went through if you knew my background he said you have no excuse to get drunk off of your Sorrows you have no excuse to get drunk and misled off of the pressure you have no excuse to be intoxicated with the cares of this life because every believer around the world is suffering the same afflictions so he's saying whom resists steadfast in the faith in other words don't give into the pressure don't indulge in what he's pushing you to do it's important to recognize that if you're having this Fellowship ship with some uh people as of late and uh one brother in particular just sharing some things in his life and it looked like maybe an opportunity is opening up and I said well it it sure looks that way just be sure it's not a trap right because sometimes we feel pressed to do something and we're kind of being nudge in a particular direction and it might just be pressure forcing us recognize what's happening in Job chapter 2 job is sitting there on the ashy keep scraping his boils clay upon clay ashes upon ashes there he is sitting in this dump and as his life just seems to be withering away and he has nothing left except his wife we could maybe speculate in that in verse n it says then said his wife unto him Dost thou still retain thy Integrity you're not going to blow up yet you're not going to say what we've all been thinking thinking you're you're not going to give up you're not going to walk away she says do you still want to be upright do you still want to be sober do you still want to have your integrity why don't you lose it she says curse God curse God and die and this is something to really take into consideration from the very first moment that that that joob recognized his children were partying and it began out of this parental concern I feel this pressure for them and this anxiety for them and he was offering these sacrifices each one for his children he was feeling the weight and the burden as a father he was being proactive sacrificing just by chance that maybe they displease the Lord and it pressure is building pressures building and then he hears he loses his cattle he loses his sheep he loses his camels he's losing servants now he loses his children and pressure had been building and now the climactic exclam exclamation of all that he's been enduring is his wife saying why don't you curse God and die yes now you want to know what's so amazing about this in job 2: 4 and 5 Satan answered the Lord and said skin for skin yeah all that the man hath will he give for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face this is a conversation that the devil's having behind closed doors and he says skin for skin if you'll just let me touch his flesh I can make him curse you and as job is sitting there scraping these boils his wife verbalizes the very plan that Satan had in the begin in other words offered to him and told him why don't you curse God it's built to the place where now he's being challenged why don't you curse God and job responds in verse 10 but he said her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh what shall we receive good at the the hand of God and shall we not receive evil in all of this did not job sin with his lips he maintained his Integrity even when the his wife shouts out tells him what to do just Curse God she verbalizes the very plan of Satan from the beginning with all the pressure but he says wait why why would I do that now I bless him when things are going well and then when things are going to B going bad I'm going to turn my back on them wow what a challenge brother Bram has asked a question in 1964 this part two the first that first Sunday there where he does those backtack uh Sundays of question and answers this is the question brother Brandon what shall we do something has settled over me that I cannot break through last fall I dreamed I was lost in white sand it was getting dark I couldn't find my way this dream has stayed with me since last fall now I am as one groping in darkness my son Irvin and his wife were included in my dream now they are also in darkness we are in desperation I believe God will show you what is in our hearts now if we are wrong or sinning places tell us we want to be right that's quite a quite a quite a question I do it there in the italics and just a different color so you know that this is a question that brother br's asked if you could just just listen listen to this and let's Let It Be instructed to us let it encourage let this word encourage us tonight I don't know if we job is often used as an encouraging uh figure but leave it to me to think I'm preaching something encouraging tonight and just making you guys more depressed thanks brother Aaron that was a real shot in the arm he says I don't know the lady but I just feel if you're here lady that here is your trouble you've let something happen to you that's made you nervous because being in White Sands represents Purity and righteous and you're just letting Satan put one over on you your dream proved that there's nothing wrong you're only nervous and by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of your family nervous stop doing it claim your god-given rights amen I hope you can really catch a hold of this now as Believers you and your homes whether it be the fathers or the mothers and whoever you might be sometimes there's this nervous tension this anxiety this pressure things are falling apart we need to we need to make a decision we got to do something I feel like I'm lost we're desperate it's not not what we wanted it to be or whatever it might be you're going through you're only nervous he says you're by doing this and doing that thinking this and you're making the rest of them nervous stop doing it claim your god-given rights your dream proves by the interpretation that you're in white sand everything's all right it's you yourself nervous now listen to what he says and you let one member of the family get nervous it goes to the next member and the next member and the first thing you're all fussing and going on this is how tension builds it starts maybe with the dad out in the workforce and he comes home and the mother's been feeling pressure all day homeschooling cleaning the house and it's pressure upon pressure then the pressure is on the kids and all this pressure gets passing around one member's nervous and fussing then the next one's nervous and fussing then everyone's fussing he says one member of the family gets kind of upset about something it upsets the other and the other and the other and the first thing you know the whole family's upset come on somebody it's true it happens everybody's upset he says it's Satan hey that's who it is it's Satan that's done it and we got say well it was it was you Elliott you did it no it was you jack no you Eliz it's you PR no it's not who dead trust me it's dead it's Satan Satan's the one that's done this he's there working with the young ones he's there working with the mom he's there working with the dad he's putting pressure on all of us and as we begin to feel that pressure we get nervous and we begin to look at things a certain way we begin to respond a certain way next thing the whole family's upset he says it's Satan he says then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them Rejoice with it so every one of the family try to do that that was an answer to this lady in your situation you feel desperate you feel lost you feel like maybe something's wrong you feel like you're in sin you're groping in darkness now your son and his wife are groping in darkness and it just starts to feed and it feeds and it feeds he says if you have a reason to Rejoice rejoice and he says let the rest of the family do it and I said that's what we ought to do as a as Believers and in your own family things may be tough things may be dark things may be difficult but if one of you finds a reason to Rejoice start rejoicing and let the rest of us join in they're rejoicing whatever it might be if it's good health a good grade if it's an opportunity say oh that's great boy that's great honey that's awesome and it may not be yours it may not be your opportunity but if one of us rejoices let us all Rejoice together good medicine brother it brings you out of that groping Darkness he says let everyone in the family try to do that and now in Job chapter 29: 18 joob makes this Proclamation then I said as shall die in my nest and I shall multiply my days as the sand it's kind of a peculiar phrase but what job is talking about is something that's working deep within his heart his attitude is beginning to shift he still has some more conversations to go and and it's that final Reckoning with God that really sums it all up but job has something turning in his heart he's now Beginning to Look Beyond a situation Beginning to Look be beyond what he's currently going through looking beyond the dust looking beyond the ashes CU in Job chapter 19 as brother B called this he had a preview of the Resurrection he saw the the coming to the Lord he says for I know job 1925-26 I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth what a revelation says that lightning bolt that zigzag that Revelation that comes to him and he sees this and so he's standing there in the midst of his difficulties and even his accusers and there's something this Revelation that he has and in the moment it's not that everything is fixed and everything's fine but yet it becomes something that he revisits and here he says I I'll die in my nest and my days shall be multiplied as the sand and this is coming after he knows his redeemer lives and in the end his redeemer is going to be standing on the earth and he sees himself with him because he says and though after my skin worms destroyed this body if this dust returns to dust if this ash goes back to ashes if this body vaporize yet in my flesh I shall see God let this dust return to dust from the ground I come and the ground I return let these ashes that sit on this ash Heap let them dematerialize and break up and be deconstructed back into what they came from but one day I will rematerialize one day I'll rise again one day my redeemer will bring me back Hallelujah Lord he says I'll die in my Nest but my days will be multiplied as the sand in 1 Peter 5 chapter 10 but God the god of GRA of all Grace who have called us into his eternal glory by Jesus Christ that means there's going to be Redemption there's going to be glory after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establ strengthen settle you so to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen though we may be in a great fixed though we may be troubled on every side we're to cast our cares upon Him because these anxious cares have a way of intoxicating us making us make decisions we otherwise wouldn't make say things we otherwise wouldn't do and so we need to be sober and Vigilant knowing that we have an enemy that's pressing us and because he's pressing us we need to resist him knowing that others are going through the same trouble and as I resist him I know that the god of Grace who's has called me to eternal glory and after I have suffered after I have resisted after I've endured this punishment after I've endured this trial after I've maintained my Integrity he'll make me perfect he'll establish me he'll strengthen me he'll settle me to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever Hallelujah he says I shall die in my Nest brother John if we could get that verse 18 again just look at that job 29:18 then I said I shall die in my nest and I shall multiply my days as the the sand there's in now notice it says I shall die in my nest and it says I shall multiply my days as the sand it's translated in several different translations I shall multiply my days as the phoenix bird it's in Jewish tradition in the Jewish Bible the complete Jewish Bible I said I will die with my nest and I will live as long as a phoenix and our Jewish publication Society old Testament then I said I shall die with my nest and I shall multiply my days as the Phoenix even the wickcliff Bible and The Lex lexum English Bible and I thought I will pass away in my nest and like the Phoenix I shall multiply my days what is job alluding to says I'll die in my nest and this is where we can see that this I die in my nest and I shall multiply my days as the Phoenix that answers to the nest see how it makes sense I'll die in my nest and then we we talk about the Sands of the earth and even the word that's used there uh the language is being used he says I shall multiply multiply my days as the phoenix bird it's that parallel claw to my nest and we know the myth of the Phoenix I trust some of you do the Phoenix sprang in one particular one sprang from a nest of myrrh a nest of myrr before his death that he made a nest that he makes before he dies so it's this Nest says it makes a nest of CA and frankincense and other spices then sets it on fire burns itself in it then out of its es comes forth an egg which produces another Phoenix the phrase says the Phoenix Burns in the fire and is Born Again from its ashes and that's what job's pointing to after he's seen his redeemer live he says I I I I I'll die in my nest and this cocoon if you want to call it that in this shelter that I make before I die I'm going to die but I will come back again amen I will rise again job is referring to an emblem of Resurrection he's referring to an emblem of of redemption and we say oh well that's Greek mythology it's this mythology and it comes from the Egyptians it comes from this and how every 500 years this bird would come and it would be in the temple of the Sun and there's a lot of Mythology that surrounds it but this is job talking about it and he's alluding to something that has this emblem Al though it may die it's going to rise up again from its own ashes out of these ashes he's going to rise again and this is what I'm wanting to express to you tonight when I say out of dust no matter what it looks like for you no matter what you're going through how ruined things may be no matter how far gone it may seem God is the one that's able to redeem From Ashes to redeem out of dust to take Rubble to take broken down stones to take destroyed walls take take destroyed relationships destroyed families destroyed Health it doesn't matter how far gone it is you could be in a grave for three days and God is able to raise you up again it doesn't matter how long your body's been in the ground thousands of years God is able to raise it again From the Ashes amen that's right out of the these ashes I'll rise I will be restored though I cast me into the Meer though I'm like dust in ashes he knows how to bring me forth I will overcome and so Job chapter 42: 1-6 job answered the Lord and said this was after some pretty good talking to I know that thou can't do everything I know you can do it and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge there have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not here I beseech thee and I will speak I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me I have heard of thee by hearing of the ear but now mine ey seeth thee amen and then he says in this moment where for I abhor myself and repent in dust and Ashes Abraham said that he came for it I am but like dust but dust and Ashes he says it in Chapter 30 job does I have become like dust and Ashes so now this incredible symbolism as ashes and renting of clothes and this solemness they would try to express even in their clothing this idea of repenting associated with the ashes he says I I repent in dust and Ashes I Repent right here I Repent in this I Repent in my my my fleshling my carnality and it's from the dust that God raised Jo job up in his humility he repented in his suffering he repented I think there's a lesson for us that job he maintain his Integrity we don't do as good right we don't necessarily Curse God but we got a lot of questions we have we have issues God we've got grievances right and and we we don't like the way things have gone and it's not what we signed up for and there's a lot of things sometimes that we begin to doubt and we begin to worry we begin to fear but but here's the answer just repent God I know you can do anything I know you can do anything why do I fear why do I fret why do I worry you've got my best in mine you're a Lover of My Soul you take good care of me all my days you've been good to me I I have nothing to fear I have nothing to worry about I I I've heard of the by hearing of the ear but Lord I have seen your goodness now I see you so Lord I I I I abore myself for doubting I hope abore myself for acting out under pressure I abore myself for losing my Integrity I abore for panicking in the moment and not trusting there's a song I've heard recently where someone's just lamenting I don't want to be here I don't want to be I'm look at the stars and and that's where I want to be and and I feel Restless I just want to move I just want to go I just want take me anywhere but where I am right now but then finally the prayer is you know Lord I want to be at a place where I'm not always just chasing an escape I'm not always just looking for a way out I want to be in a place where I can finally say don't take me anywhere I want to be here don't take me anywhere but here this is where I want to be this is where I want to stand this is where I want to grow this is where I want to serve this is where I want to be oh I I want to come to that place where I can say I I know I know God can do everything I know I want to look back and say I know my redeemer lives listen this is what the message did for us it made God real it made him alive it showed it wasn't tradition it wasn't a cult it wasn't theology it wasn't denomination just wasn't a better way to live it was a living God who's alive who's with his people who perform signs and wonders who can do everything he's a God who can can still do everything we got to come back to I know my redeemer lives and out of dust out of dust I can rise amen and it says in verse 10 of that chapter the Lord turned the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends and also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before then he came there up unto him all his Brethren and all his sisters and all they had that had acquaintance been acquaintance of before of his before and did eat bread and with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him over all the evil the Lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and everyone an earring of gold so the Lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had 14,000 sheep 6,000 camels a th000 yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses he also had seven sons and three daughters joob in the end is made whole he had twice as much as he had before the Lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning why because he brought him he he was with them his Redeemer even in that moment if you see job there in Job chapter 2 scraping boils he's near death his wife says just go ahead do it it's been leading to this moment all along anyways go ahead just do it turn away curse him give him yield die spiritually die give up why why why you keep why you keep pressing why are you gonna stick through it why you gonna try to stand go ahead do it do it and in that moment he said no I won't I won't do it and so he's a lesson to us no matter what dust you're on no matter what as ashes you're surrounded by you can look around and say though it may be me that feels like I'm vaporizing out of these ashes I can rise right out from the very thing that's that's burning me and breaking me down and vaporizing me I know my redeemer lives and if I if I if I die if I go to dust God's obligated to reassemble me again he's he's obligated to Raise Me Up God has a plan he'll take you out of dust he'll take you out of the trouble he'll take you out of the anxiety he's made you a promise I could read you scripture after scripture after scripture he will restore amen yes sir he will do it am it's the promise of the Old Testament it's the very picture that's painted the entire Bible though it may be in Ruins God is a Rebuilder God is a restorer God is a redeemer look at every picture every example we have in the Bible it it begins in chaos and then there's order then it's a perfect Eden and then it's Fallen God is is always showing no matter what happens no matter how dark it gets I will restore I'll bring it back again look at the end of The Bible and how he brings it to this great greater glory in the end it's a message to me and my problems right now it's a message to me and my difficulties right now though I may feel dusty though I may feel dirty though my life may feel like it's in rubble and ruin God is a builder God is a restorer God will make this live again good brother Bram says and letting off the pressure Brothers you could come to your instruments he says now if you want to do right I'm so glad tonight to tell you that there is a City of Refuge he said that's Jesus Christ hurry hurry hurry run run run run run run hurry hurry hurry wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hey life is just one continual doctor's visit get here at 10: we're going to charge you 200 50 bucks you better be here on time you get there at 10:00 you're going to wait a couple hours right and then doctor finally comes in no offense you know it's not how they do it at Valley Health but we know what it's like in these other meals and stuff and you're like hey what was the what was the point of the appointment right hurry up get here this is happen this happen feel this out do that just pressure pressure pressure pressure pressure there's a place you can go that's Jesus Christ and if I if I could add this he's here right now you don't have to run you don't have to go 90 miles an hour we say I feel lost I feel forsaken go back to where you left them he's his word where did you leave him at the word it's not a it's not a a treasure hunt or whatever something we're just going to go on and try to find some some uh you know some needle in a hay stack somewhere he says if you don't want to do wrong the enemy is after you then there is a way of escape and that escape is Jesus Christ as that songwriter said I'm tired of chasing an escape how about you find the true escape come to him today that escape is Jesus Christ there's a place where you can come and let off the steam he understands he get you that's that's where we can say vent that's where we can pour ourselves out to him unburden ourselves he says cast your cares on me give me all those anxious cares come on give me your fears give me your worries you know sometimes we bottle it up right because like well I don't want to tell my wife because I don't want her to worry because that's exactly what will happen or you tell somebody you like oh the worst thing ever this is just imagine it this way job called his best friend right he said you won't believe what happened today this happened that happened he goes through tells of cattle camels children everything and his friends like says yeah they're raising my rent man you won't believe it everyone's always into their own right everybody's problems is always worse but he's someone you can go to let off the Steam and he won't shame you he won't belittle you he looks at your dust and he says I can do something with this I can use this for good brother brandham continues he says no matter what takes place Christ is our refuge I'm skipping just a little bit in the sermon and when we come to him we can let off the pressure you can quit worrying about well if I die what's going to happen to me what's going to happen to the wife what's going to happen to the husband what's going to happen to the children just come to Christ and let off the pressure all he gives us all things that's what job said I know that I can do everything he gives us all things all things are ours by Christ so just let the pressure off the only one way you can do it somebody might give you a million dollars it would build up pressure I want you to think about that sometimes we think oh just if they could give out another Corona virus bonus or whatever that was if if I could just win the lot if I could just get this if I could just cash out the stocks if Bitcoin would just go to $90,000 whatever it might be we think oh if it this would just work you know what let's be honest it only builds more pressure when we look for the world to relieve our pressure and we reach for it itre increases our pressure when we look to others to relieve our pressure and we get it it only increases our pressure there's no relief from pressure outside of Christ it's in him and him alone someone could give you a million dollars you oh that'll settle all my problems no it's going to make it [Music] worse you might join a church and it would still build up pressure hey if we thought that all we had to do is start a church in Phoenix right and then we we just all be pressure free what this has been an experiment to prove that's not true changing churches doesn't change pressure he says Comm because the Methodist will tell you they're right and the Baptist is wrong and the Baptist say they're wrong and you're right so it just builds up more pressure because you don't know where you're standing he says but if you ever come to Christ you can let off the pressure because it's all over then just settle it down just settle it down let's SLE something tonight he says it's God's provided place of safety where God said the name of the Lord is like a mighty tower is what his text was coming from in some of these sermons The Righteous run into it and they're safe you know what you know what it means to be safe you just you just let you you breathe again you ever been when you're under pressure what happens some sometimes you tense up you tighten up your jaw gets a little bit tighter your neck gets tighter your shoulder you don't even feel it but everything just tenses up you'll start holding your breath you won't breathe normally you just you hold your breath but when you're safe there's this relaxing you let go of the tension you let go of everything that's building I'm safe so it says in the time of sickness when sickness strikes and the doctor says there's nothing else I can do about it don't build up pressure let off the pressure call your pastor call him do it let him anoint you in oil and pray over you prayer of faith shall save the sick he comes right back to the word let off the pressure he is our refuge while you're in this Refuge you got a right to anything that's in the Refuge Hallelujah don't run after anything else come to your Escape your refuge and Christ is our refuge and everything you have need of is in him Amen in sickness don't build up pressure let off pressure in anxiety don't build up pressure let off pressure in depression in in economic woes and whatever it might be don't build pressure let off pressure cuz he can out of dust raise you up I I I felt so impressed to speak this tonight even if it would be an interrupt from what we've been ministering on to encourage you tonight on this night with those we're here to encourage you tonight that he's able to do anything and and the pressures we're experiencing the directions we're being pushed the way we're being pulled the way that we're fearing the way that we're being overwhelmed we need to stand still brother bam says stand still take a deep breath sit down and think it over not analyze not interpret but cast your cares on him and recognize that that enemy is pushing he's pushing he's pushing to try to get you not to curse God but to deny his will fight against his plan or his purpose despair for life but let's have the kind of confidence tonight that no matter what happens Satan you may push me and push me until I vaporize but God's obligated to raise me up and you've got a promise because you know what you're a special kind of dust the more pressure he turns on you the closer you get to being that diamond that's right that can only be form form Med through pressure and if we'll just trust him just trust him he can do all things amen we have our heads bowed I'd like to pray for you but I would want to encourage some response to the word [Music] tonight not to satisfi sat satisfy myself not to take a poll or show hands so I can feel that what I've preached is has been effective I don't need that I don't need it I I I know that I've obeyed the Lord in speaking this but I want you to respond to God it was CS Lewis that said in his deepest darkest struggles and trials he said it wasn't God performing some experiment on my life to test me to see what I was made of and I know I've read it number of times to you already so maybe some of you remember it he says I God wasn't testing me so he could know what I was made of he said he knew all along he said it was I who occupied the jury box and the witness stand it was I who was being exempt it was I who had to make the decision and so tonight if you could find some honesty before the Lord and in your dust and Ashes speak to him as Abraham said he was I will now speak unto the Lord me who am but dust and Ashes me who's been cast into the mire and become like dust and Ashes it'll be me who now repents in dust and Ashes and says Lord I know that you can do everything I know Lord that you can do everything and if God has spoken in particular to you tonight could you just open your heart to him and say Lord here I am I'm not trying to escape to anywhere else but you The Refuge is there anyone here who feels God calling you to him tonight a life of surrender a giving in a yielding and say Lord I don't want to run anymore I don't want to chase anymore I want to come to Christ where I can let off the steam just want to yield to him surrender say Lord I've coming to you be honest the pressure has been building it's been building it's been building I thought I was going to lose my mind there's going to be a a big blow up no uh-uh God's intervened tonight he's opened up a way into the City of Refuge stop trying to escape and settle down right now in his presence and say Lord here I am I'm casting my cares upon you those who need the prayer today please open your hearts up say Lord here I am casting my cares on you I'm trusting you Lord just praying your hearts now Lord here I am trusting you Lord I'm repenting Lord Lord of my foolishness of my questions of my wondering Lord of all the plans and the schemes I've been making to figure a way out Lord I just want to come and let off the pressure oh Lord help us tonight if you need the prayer if you need prayer you can if you want to raise your hand if you want to stay right where you are are if you want to stand whatever you need right now I just want us to pray together as a church whatever you need to do by faith to open up your heart to him now I chose the phrase out of dust dot dot dot because he's going to take you out of the dust and he's going to do something with you but it begins in moments like this where we say Lord I know I know you're able to redeem me out of this situation no matter how dark it is no matter how difficult it is no matter what no what it is am Our God's a redeemer so I want to pray with you now if you want to stand if you want to lift your hand if you want to pray in your heart just as you feel led let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord now as we are in your presence we feel that we have come to the very Gates of the City of Refuge and we look back behind us and we hear the enemy as a roaring line coming after us the hound dogs of hell as it were the enemy the pressure the accusations the misery the trouble the Affliction the rumors the lies you name it Lord chasing after us and Lord we were actually conspiring in our hearts we had a great escape plan we had figured it out we were going to leave we were going to go we were going to do something we were going to make this decision we're going to make that decision felt like I had it all figured out but Lord you stopped me and you called me to the City of Refuge first and I've slowed down now Lord and I'm standing at the doors of the City of Refuge and I'm asking I'm asking to enter and you're welcoming me in and you're saying cast your cares on me unburden yourself I can relieve the pressure and Lord may we realize that you won't shame us you won't belittle us you're not going to make us feel stupid Lord you want to relieve us of these anxiety and these these cares he'll say I know I know it's tough It's hard it's difficult I know and Lord I pray that you will take us in our ruin tonight you'll take us in our rubble and our rubbish take us in our dust and forgive us of all that we've said or done to displease you Lord forgive us of all the ways in which we deny your perfect will forgive us Lord of how easy it is for us to be upset and to blow up and to snap Lord I pray now that you would be gracious to us favor this dust Lord show your favor upon it and take us out of dust and raise us up Lord as we humble ourselves before you tonight repenting as we humble ourselves in this dust and Ashes Lord exalt us father exalt us raise us up build us up encourage us [Music] we love you father we commit ourselves to you tonight in this just very sober and solemn presence Lord I pray you touch your people encourage them Lord may they may they not be filled with images of loss and images of Destruction and images of dust but Lord may they be filled with this courage and strength father I'll just even say it in my prayer it's out of dust into heaven lord it's out of dust into to Heaven Lord You're Going to redeem and make something beautiful and I just want to yield to that process and I want to see glory and I want to see righteousness and I want to believe that all things are possible so I pray for your people tonight whether they be here present on the archive streaming Lord whatever it might be may you be merciful to us in our dust and Ashes forgive us of our sins touch us Lord and make us whole I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
