[0:00] and my title is my subtitle is the
[0:02] natural types the spiritual so we're
[0:04] continuing on the kind of this segment
[0:06] that we visit every once in a while on
[0:07] character disorders this is the third
[0:09] one so it's not like there's been a lot
[0:10] of of ground covered and i want to use
[0:13] the thought of the natural types of
[0:14] spiritual and i am kind of coming back
[0:17] just feeling very led to go back over
[0:20] some foundational things so we could
[0:22] kind of lay a little bit
[0:23] stronger bedrock on this
[0:25] for the things that we want to explore
[0:27] in the future as god would lead and i
[0:29] really um
[0:31] invite you to
[0:32] focus because there's a there's kind of
[0:34] a theme that is going to come through
[0:36] this that i believe you have to be real
[0:38] perseverant to kind of catch
[0:40] now just look again at our text romans
[0:42] chapter 1 verse 20 it says for the
[0:45] invisible things of him the invisible
[0:47] things of god
[0:48] from the creation of the world are
[0:49] clearly seen
[0:51] and that's quite a statement that the
[0:52] invisible things of god from the
[0:54] creation of the world are clearly seen
[0:56] being understood by the things that are
[0:58] made and that's the statement to me that
[1:01] kind of
[1:02] gives me the foundation for this the the
[1:05] subtitle natural types the spiritual
[1:08] says even his eternal power and godhead
[1:10] so that they are without excuse from the
[1:12] creation of the world paul has wanted us
[1:14] to kind of ponder that since god created
[1:16] things that are visible since creation
[1:18] humanity is gazed upon god's creation
[1:21] and it's god's creation that declares
[1:22] his character and so it's as humankind
[1:25] whether they believe in a god or not as
[1:26] they look at things created they're
[1:28] looking at the nature of god and the
[1:29] character of god and it tells us that
[1:31] even his eternal power and divine nature
[1:34] are expressed in natural things
[1:37] and we we may not believe in a god we
[1:40] may not believe in the authority of
[1:42] scripture but anytime we look out and we
[1:44] see creation we see the stars we see the
[1:46] earth we see the uh we see animal life
[1:48] we even see human life you're seeing the
[1:51] handiwork of god therefore
[1:53] paul is even put in this sense that
[1:55] because there's things that are living
[1:56] there's things that are created that the
[1:58] atheist is without excuse even if he
[2:01] never hears the gospel preach it says
[2:02] they are without excuse because the
[2:05] creation
[2:07] holds something in it that can cause us
[2:09] to understand invisible things of god
[2:12] maybe not all of god but yet the
[2:14] invisible things of god are clearly seen
[2:17] and understood by the creation the
[2:19] things that were made
[2:21] and we recognize this statement being
[2:23] it's very familiar to us knowing how
[2:25] much brother branham used this
[2:28] uh emphasis that the natural types the
[2:30] spiritual he says in one place god uh
[2:32] always types the spiritual by the
[2:34] natural
[2:35] and so there's a there's some symmetry
[2:38] there's some relationship and connection
[2:40] between the natural world and the
[2:42] spiritual world even to where even
[2:44] without the bible brother graham says
[2:46] god's character is expressed he would
[2:47] still believe in god and i believe this
[2:50] scripture is speaking to that the
[2:52] invisible things of god are understood
[2:54] by the things that are made because in
[2:56] the things that are made nature there is
[2:58] an image of god or there's a type of the
[3:00] spiritual things of god
[3:02] it says in hebrews 11 verse 3 through
[3:04] faith we understand that the worlds were
[3:06] framed by the word of god
[3:09] so the things which are seen were not
[3:10] made of things which do appears we by
[3:12] faith believe that god created the
[3:14] heavens and the earth that's the one
[3:16] thing that we can maybe identify when it
[3:18] comes to science and study and academics
[3:21] you probably can't get very many
[3:22] scientists to agree on how the world was
[3:24] created but christians all christians
[3:26] agree that by faith we believe
[3:28] god created the heavens and the earth
[3:30] the worlds were framed by the word of
[3:32] god therefore the things that we see are
[3:35] made by things which do not appear
[3:37] so again there's the invisible god that
[3:39] cannot be seen
[3:41] expressing himself through his creation
[3:44] and it's from these scriptures we begin
[3:46] to get this uh this image of there's a
[3:49] spiritual side which is not seen but
[3:51] then there's a natural side that is seen
[3:55] and in in one sense and i want to kind
[3:57] of bring out maybe a couple senses to
[3:59] this in one sense there is a spiritual
[4:02] unseen reality
[4:04] that this natural life that we're living
[4:06] in now and the things that we experience
[4:08] now are a type of or a shadow of
[4:11] in other words this life is a shadow of
[4:13] another life this life is a type or is
[4:16] in the image of a greater life so we
[4:18] create this difference between a higher
[4:20] life a spiritual life spiritual things
[4:23] and then what is earthly what is seen
[4:24] now
[4:25] and what we call the natural life and so
[4:28] the things we taste and see and smell
[4:30] the things you experience the places we
[4:31] go and everything that's related to
[4:33] creation and nature and even our human
[4:35] lives are saying there's some there's
[4:37] something expressed in life that is a
[4:40] type of eternal life there's something
[4:42] expressed in our natural lives that is a
[4:44] type of god's own life for his nature
[4:46] and character so it's in that sense when
[4:48] we say the natural is one thing the
[4:50] spiritual is another
[4:52] paul in talking about the new bodies
[4:54] that we're going to receive writes it
[4:56] this way in first corinthians chapter 15
[4:58] verses 44 to 47.
[5:00] talking about the natural a life it is
[5:02] sown a natural body it is raised a
[5:05] spiritual body and you'll notice back
[5:06] and forth natural spiritual natural
[5:09] spiritual there is a natural body and
[5:11] there is a spiritual body and so it is
[5:13] written the first man adam was made a
[5:15] living soul the last adam was made a
[5:18] quickening spirit i like how the bible
[5:20] says it's the last adam i think there's
[5:22] some i heard one time there's a doctrine
[5:23] out there called the third atom and uh
[5:26] well you can't really run that through
[5:27] the message of the hour but yet they try
[5:29] and so the last adam was made a
[5:32] quickening spirit so you have natural
[5:34] body spiritual body natural body
[5:36] spiritual body first man living soul
[5:39] last adam a quickening spirit how be it
[5:42] that was not first which is spiritual
[5:44] but that which is natural the natural
[5:46] came first he's saying
[5:47] and afterward that which is spiritual
[5:49] the first man is of the earth earthy the
[5:52] second man is the lord from heaven
[5:55] now paul is establishing it between the
[5:58] first adam and the last adam which is
[6:00] jesus christ and he's using even those
[6:02] two individuals first adam last adam
[6:05] adam in jesus christ as an example of
[6:08] the natural coming first but the
[6:10] spiritual coming second the first adam
[6:13] is the natural man he's comprised of
[6:15] soul spirit and body that triune being
[6:17] and and paul would say this is the
[6:19] natural man
[6:21] that is there's a natural body but when
[6:23] it dies it's going to be raised up in a
[6:24] spiritual body it's the natural that has
[6:26] come first it is our first nature we
[6:29] receive by our first birth our natural
[6:32] birth of our parents and he says but
[6:33] then there's a second adam a last adam
[6:36] which was made a quickening spirit he
[6:38] says the second man is the lord of
[6:40] heaven
[6:41] so christ represents a higher order
[6:44] it represents a heavenly order you could
[6:46] see this even through the the priesthood
[6:48] the aaronic priesthood uh which has an
[6:50] end the melchizedek priesthood which has
[6:52] no beginning and no end and there's a
[6:54] he's emphasizing and showing this
[6:56] there's a spiritual side to things
[6:58] there's a natural side to things there's
[7:00] an eternal side to things there's this
[7:01] carnal side of things
[7:03] and there's different ways of viewing
[7:05] this relationship between the natural
[7:07] and spiritual or maybe this dichotomy
[7:09] between spiritual things and natural
[7:10] things
[7:11] and and i'm and wanting to use both of
[7:14] them
[7:15] and so tonight is maybe me
[7:17] uh kind of going back and reframing some
[7:19] of these things we spoke already on this
[7:21] these character disorders so that we
[7:23] recognize where the emphasis is
[7:26] there is the
[7:27] distinction as we're just talking about
[7:29] between the spiritual with the capital s
[7:31] the heavenly things the spiritual things
[7:32] and natural things so the god who
[7:34] created all things who's invisible who's
[7:36] in a realm that we cannot see that we
[7:38] cannot feel that we cannot touch
[7:40] and all the things that he created that
[7:42] we relate to through those senses that's
[7:44] spiritual and natural heavenly earthly
[7:46] that's how paul captures it in these
[7:48] verses here and then how he's framing it
[7:51] in hebrews and romans that there's a
[7:52] spiritual side of things a divine and
[7:56] then there's an earthly but then there's
[7:57] another way of looking at the natural
[7:59] and spiritual and that would be
[8:01] in the relationship between the body and
[8:03] the spirit
[8:04] or you could even begin to look at it in
[8:07] other senses i guess if you just say
[8:08] things that are spiritual and things
[8:10] that are natural but there's a there's a
[8:12] way that there's things that are higher
[8:13] that are heavenly things that are
[8:15] natural but then there's a way that the
[8:17] natural types the spiritual between our
[8:18] body and our spirit
[8:20] and and i'm just kind of launching into
[8:23] my emphasis tonight on these character
[8:25] disorders
[8:26] there are
[8:28] spiritual there there are physical
[8:30] sicknesses
[8:31] okay i was wondering if i was gonna get
[8:32] an amen or we just deny them all right
[8:34] let's deny there is definitely a nasty
[8:37] little cold bug that's going around all
[8:38] over the place i hear from friends all
[8:40] over north america i've heard there's
[8:42] several families even in our church here
[8:44] that are suffering from just a real uh
[8:47] real nasty cold at least that's all
[8:48] we're calling it
[8:50] and uh so he says that there are there
[8:53] are there are physical sicknesses in our
[8:55] bodies that we have maladies and
[8:57] weaknesses and and diseases and things
[8:59] that relate to the physical body but
[9:01] there's also spiritual sicknesses
[9:04] there are mental maladies there's
[9:06] there's uh if we call what they call
[9:08] mental illnesses or breaches in the
[9:10] spirit the bible talks about when a man
[9:12] is healthy uh when he's sick his spirit
[9:14] will bear him up when in his infirmity
[9:16] he says but when the spirit is broken
[9:19] who can bear it so there's a brokenness
[9:20] to spirits there's a discouragement
[9:22] there's a depression there there's a
[9:24] even mental disorders that are different
[9:26] than a physical disorder
[9:29] and there are uh natural
[9:32] uh personality disorders that's what
[9:34] we've kind of introduced to a couple
[9:36] services or what we might call mental
[9:38] illnesses
[9:40] and that
[9:41] god can heal
[9:44] there are breaches in the spirit there's
[9:46] a brokenness that someone can have in
[9:47] their heart they're diagnosable or
[9:49] labels that the world would want to put
[9:51] on somebody that relates to a mental
[9:53] illness that god can heal that he can
[9:55] mend that he can deliver someone from
[9:57] and so in the same way that god can heal
[10:00] the body
[10:01] in the same way that god could take
[10:02] cancer and cause it to disappear the
[10:04] same way that god can actually
[10:06] supernaturally mend to bone how god
[10:08] could perform a miracle a physical sense
[10:11] on somebody causing a limb to straighten
[10:13] out or
[10:14] or some blood disease be taken away from
[10:17] someone the same god that can do that
[10:18] he's also able to heal the mind
[10:21] same god that can heal the body is the
[10:22] same god that can heal the heart says in
[10:25] first thessalonians 5 23 and the very
[10:27] god of peace sanctify you holy and i
[10:30] pray what a beautiful prayer and i pray
[10:32] god your whole spirit and i could say
[10:34] whole body
[10:36] whole soul and whole body your whole
[10:37] spirit and whole soul and whole body be
[10:39] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[10:41] our lord jesus christ
[10:43] when he asks that god would sanctify you
[10:45] holy it means complete perfect sound
[10:48] and then that your soul spirit and body
[10:50] be preserved blameless blameless means
[10:53] no defect
[10:54] and this is paul's prayer we could say
[10:56] oh i pray that your soul be preserved
[10:58] blameless well when you're born again
[11:00] it's sealed
[11:02] preserved blameless but paul does not
[11:04] just stop with the soul being preserved
[11:06] with no defect but he says your whole
[11:07] spirit and your whole body through some
[11:10] process be preserved so that there is no
[11:13] defect
[11:15] and he's saying this not
[11:16] he's not just saying it's about the soul
[11:18] which i believe we should all readily
[11:19] accept that once we're born again the
[11:21] soul is sealed it's in a perfect
[11:22] condition brother brown when he preaches
[11:24] future at home he's already putting it
[11:25] in the eighth day
[11:27] the soul is already there in the eighth
[11:28] day our spirits and our bodies just need
[11:31] to catch up to it and so paul is saying
[11:33] there is a perfecting a mending and a
[11:35] healing for the body and we usually can
[11:37] say amen to that but i'm also wanting to
[11:39] emphasize that your your inheritance
[11:43] also relates to the perfecting of your
[11:45] spirit
[11:48] there are character disorders
[11:51] that the word of god is correcting
[11:53] not just disorder in the body but
[11:55] character disorders that the word of god
[11:56] is perfecting
[11:57] there's a healing of the mind at the
[11:59] mending of our spirits but also
[12:02] this is where again i want to relate to
[12:03] the difference between
[12:05] uh
[12:06] the natural and the spiritual i and
[12:08] maybe i just need to slow down a bit
[12:11] and collect my thoughts
[12:12] that there's a healing to the body
[12:15] and there's a healing to the spirit in
[12:17] that even within the natural man
[12:19] now in our in a spiritual sense let's
[12:21] just take that as a type
[12:22] then as far as our character is
[12:24] concerned the word of god wants to
[12:26] perfect our characters
[12:28] he wants to he wants to take our
[12:30] thoughts and our thinking and our
[12:31] judgments and our discernments and he
[12:33] wants to also likewise perfect that part
[12:36] of us so there's a healing of a mind and
[12:39] a minion of our spirits but then there's
[12:40] also a perfecting of our character
[12:43] and and i'm looking at those as just two
[12:44] different things
[12:46] and when we use the phrase character
[12:47] disorders last time or you know over the
[12:50] last couple months
[12:51] these are things that natural
[12:53] personality disorders are a type of
[12:56] and that's the way we framed it in the
[12:58] very beginning that uh in the dsm manual
[13:00] that there's a there's certain 157
[13:03] different disorders uh that people that
[13:05] the scientists use to try to categorize
[13:07] and put people in different categories
[13:08] based upon symptomatic behavior and
[13:11] things that they're exhibiting and and
[13:12] it relates solely to a medical diagnosis
[13:15] of someone's mental condition
[13:17] but then we we say well that's we leave
[13:19] that to the scientists maybe to put the
[13:21] labels on it and to diagnose and but
[13:23] then uh there is a another side to that
[13:26] we're looking in the sense that well a
[13:28] personality according to their own
[13:30] definitions is your character
[13:32] and that god is concerned about our
[13:33] character
[13:35] and that when we die the only thing that
[13:36] we take with us is our character
[13:39] and so there's something about our
[13:40] character that's important in the word
[13:42] of god and character disorders are
[13:46] the natural personality disorders can be
[13:48] type or a type of character disorders
[13:52] and so let me just uh let me just drop
[13:54] back a little bit and define a
[13:56] personality disorder this isn't a broad
[13:57] sense
[13:59] personality disorder is a type of mental
[14:01] disorder characterized by rigid an
[14:03] unhealthy pattern of thinking
[14:05] functioning and behaving
[14:08] now before you try to diagnose the
[14:10] neighbors in the apartment next door
[14:11] let's just look at this uh clinically
[14:14] let's just look at this academically
[14:16] it's a mental disorder characterized by
[14:17] a rigid unhealthy pattern of thinking
[14:19] functioning and behaving i think that
[14:21] rigid
[14:22] is an important aspect to it and then
[14:24] it's uh it's something that's stubborn
[14:26] it's there it's not easily overcome and
[14:28] it's an unhealthy way of thinking
[14:30] unhealthy way of behaving and
[14:32] functioning and relating to other people
[14:34] you find i think just by thinking about
[14:36] that you realize yeah this could have
[14:37] application spiritually
[14:38] this could have application in a
[14:40] different plane in a different order and
[14:42] they say that a person with
[14:44] a personality disorder struggles to
[14:46] perceive and relate to situations in
[14:48] others
[14:50] so if someone has a personality disorder
[14:52] and and there's a number of them we
[14:53] talked about the different clusters that
[14:55] they have for these they struggle to
[14:57] relate to other people they struggle in
[14:59] social situations they struggle uh in in
[15:02] perceiving situations and they can be
[15:04] very paranoid or they perceive it very
[15:06] very differently it's remarkable when
[15:08] you read stories or hear of different
[15:10] ones who've been afflicted with some of
[15:11] these personality disorders and for no
[15:13] reason
[15:15] all of a sudden they'll develop a
[15:16] suspicion uh that they're hearing voices
[15:19] or that someone is tracking them and
[15:21] this has happened you say oh that's for
[15:23] some crazy drug addict no this happens
[15:24] to well-educated otherwise very very
[15:26] healthy people uh and i know of lawyers
[15:30] very uh
[15:32] i'm not not to put make anybody worried
[15:34] i'm not a highly successful lawyer
[15:35] because i was gonna say lawyers that are
[15:36] highly successful
[15:38] uh well-paying jobs very standing uh
[15:41] outstanding in their field uh succumbed
[15:43] to a mental disorder where they
[15:45] perceived that they were being tracked
[15:47] by the government and and immediately
[15:48] begin to think oh because i represented
[15:50] such and such person and i did such and
[15:52] such work and they start to deteriorate
[15:54] in their relationships and they're
[15:56] paranoid with other people this is
[15:58] something that's characteristics of
[15:59] somebody who enters into this kind of
[16:00] mania
[16:02] and there's a
[16:04] it's widely believed that it's caused by
[16:06] genetic influences but also
[16:08] environmental influences
[16:10] in other words this is i think this is
[16:11] just broadly accepted that your dna may
[16:14] make one vulnerable to developing a
[16:16] personality disorder and then a life
[16:18] situation triggers it
[16:21] and to stress or trauma something
[16:22] happens even a physical injury can do
[16:25] things to where by your dna it can run
[16:26] in the family history but then it
[16:29] doesn't necessarily mean you're going to
[16:30] have it but then something happens and
[16:32] it kind of triggers the development of
[16:33] that personality disorder one of them we
[16:36] mentioned in the beginning i still i'm
[16:37] not going to be able to fully develop
[16:39] this as i wanted to in the beginning i
[16:41] realized i kind of jumped the gun even
[16:42] titling the first part the
[16:44] anti-spiritual personality disorder
[16:46] we drew it from the
[16:48] anti-social personality disorder so
[16:50] that's an actual personality disorder
[16:53] that's in in the manual
[16:54] and it is something that they say is
[16:57] it's the presence of a chronic
[16:59] or pervasive disposition to disregard
[17:02] and violate the rights of others
[17:05] huh
[17:06] okay
[17:08] just got real
[17:10] oh so they're crazy well maybe they are
[17:12] it says that manifestations include
[17:14] repeated violations of the law
[17:16] exploitation of others deceitfulness
[17:18] impulsivity aggressiveness reckless
[17:20] disregard for the safety of self and
[17:22] others irresponsibility accompanied by a
[17:24] lack of guilt a lack of remorse a lack
[17:27] of empathy
[17:28] this is what they would say is an
[17:30] anti-social personality disorder someone
[17:33] that disregards laws and norms and rules
[17:35] of society
[17:36] so we looked at that and i don't think
[17:38] we actually got to the point where we
[17:39] could do the type in part one is instead
[17:42] of maybe an anti-social personality
[17:44] disorder but an anti-spiritual
[17:46] personality disorder
[17:48] because
[17:49] to be anti-social doesn't mean you a
[17:51] shoe social being social and you're an
[17:53] introvert you don't talk to other people
[17:54] and you just kind of hide out in your
[17:56] home and never fellowshipping or never
[17:58] around people no some of the most
[18:00] anti-social people are very very
[18:02] sociable
[18:03] you know they because they uh they come
[18:05] across as gregarious and outgoing and
[18:09] can gain your confidence so to be
[18:10] anti-social is not to be an introvert
[18:13] it's true it's to be very very social
[18:15] but to work contrary to what would
[18:17] socially be normal and acceptable
[18:19] so an anti-spiritual personality
[18:21] disorder is not someone that disregards
[18:23] laws norms and rules of society but it's
[18:25] a disregard for the word in the order of
[18:26] the spirit while proposing to be
[18:30] spiritual
[18:32] where you see the impulsivity and the
[18:33] lack of accountability lack of remorse
[18:35] and repentance and the and the the
[18:37] traits that are characteristic of
[18:38] someone who has an anti-social
[18:40] personality disorder there's a way that
[18:41] we can examine our conduct our attitude
[18:44] towards others our behavior within the
[18:46] body of christ and ask ourselves am i
[18:48] acting in an anti-spiritual way
[18:51] we're indifferent it talks about
[18:53] indifferent routine manipulation
[18:55] exploitation violation of other people's
[18:57] rights and rule breaking there's a way
[18:59] that we can look at that spiritually
[19:01] say well i believe the message and i go
[19:03] to church and i believe all these things
[19:04] but yet you act in a manner which is
[19:06] inconsistent with what the word of god
[19:08] says a christian should act
[19:11] and and i'm saying you got an
[19:12] anti-spiritual personality disorder i
[19:14] pointed down the aisle
[19:16] sir one pointed anybody in particular i
[19:18] i missed you brother mike it went
[19:20] straight for straight underneath that
[19:21] table where that imp is hiding out
[19:25] that's a you can have this and it's
[19:27] important to examine ourselves
[19:29] i do i i profess the right things but
[19:31] it's my behavior my interaction with
[19:33] others am i not
[19:35] do i can can i not form the words i'm
[19:36] sorry can i not own up to my own
[19:38] mistakes and realize wow there's
[19:40] probably a way that we can begin to look
[19:41] at our
[19:42] uh characteristics as a christian and
[19:45] ask ourselves whether or not we're in
[19:47] the image of what a christian should be
[19:49] i think we use the terminology spiritual
[19:51] psychopath
[19:52] in the first one
[19:54] and how it's someone who's not walking
[19:56] not walking according to the word but
[19:58] they're walking according to their own
[19:59] values
[20:01] a psychopath if someone has their own
[20:02] value system it's not that they don't
[20:04] have rules and that that
[20:06] it's just they don't believe the rules
[20:07] apply to them and they have their own
[20:09] set of rules their own set of norms and
[20:11] we can be spiritual psychopaths when we
[20:14] are confessing to walk in truth but we
[20:16] refuse to humble ourselves to the word
[20:18] of god and continue to behave according
[20:21] to the word of god
[20:23] i want you just to even consider maybe
[20:25] the first and primary example of
[20:26] somebody that exhibited
[20:28] one of these
[20:29] mental illnesses in the bible just think
[20:31] about cain
[20:34] and how cain behaved and acted in the
[20:36] very beginning that he he made an
[20:38] offering of worship to god
[20:40] and is even instructed and corrected as
[20:42] to how he could
[20:44] make it right but refuses to do it
[20:47] and then
[20:48] murders his brother
[20:52] now as we use the phrase character
[20:54] disorders and we're looking at it in
[20:56] this natural types of spiritual that
[20:58] there can be maybe a medical clinical
[21:00] diagnosis of a person who has some sort
[21:02] of mental illness we're not saying that
[21:05] there's anything uh
[21:06] not we would have a mental illness but
[21:08] in a spiritual sense our character has
[21:10] to be properly developed
[21:13] and our character comes from the word of
[21:16] god
[21:17] that's where our character comes from as
[21:19] christians if we're born again
[21:20] christians our character comes from the
[21:21] word of god so we have spiritual genes
[21:24] we have a spiritual dna it's something
[21:25] that's not related to our natural dna
[21:28] but it's related to our spiritual
[21:29] relationship to christ the elect have a
[21:31] seed that contains certain
[21:33] characteristics and certain potentials
[21:35] do you believe that if you're a son or
[21:36] daughter of god you are elect of god
[21:38] then there was a seed inside of you that
[21:40] could be born again and in that
[21:43] new birth is a new life or new
[21:45] attributes new characteristics and a
[21:47] whole other set of potentials
[21:49] and so with the gene of god
[21:51] let me say this way if you have that
[21:53] seed with the gene of god you are
[21:55] vulnerable to developing perfect
[21:57] character
[22:00] all right so if you can in the world
[22:02] be born with a certain set of markers
[22:04] that make you vulnerable to developing a
[22:06] personality disorder then i believe that
[22:08] the natural types of spiritual that you
[22:10] by virtue of having the seed of god
[22:12] inside of you you are vulnerable to
[22:14] developing perfect character
[22:17] that it's related to the seed it's in
[22:19] the seed already and what we just need
[22:21] is a spirit an experience with the
[22:22] baptism of the holy ghost to trigger its
[22:24] development
[22:26] you may have the gene inside of you with
[22:28] all the potential and vulnerability to
[22:30] develop perfect character but if you're
[22:32] never born again by the baptism the holy
[22:34] ghost you can't it doesn't trigger
[22:36] the the opportunity for that life to
[22:38] come forward and be expressed
[22:40] in second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17
[22:43] it says therefore if any man be in
[22:44] christ he is a new creature
[22:48] that means he is a new creation
[22:54] the same god
[22:57] who made
[22:58] the invisible god who made the visible
[22:59] things around us and in doing so
[23:01] expressed his nature
[23:03] is still in the business of creating
[23:05] and it says if any man be in christ and
[23:07] how are you in christ by one spirit
[23:09] you're baptized into the body of christ
[23:11] you become a new creation
[23:13] you have to think of this as something
[23:15] new and different than the old man
[23:17] old things are passed away behold all
[23:19] things are become new
[23:22] if you are a new creation a new creature
[23:24] you are a new creation there's a new
[23:26] constitution there's a new institution
[23:28] there's a new ordinance
[23:30] when you're born again there's a new
[23:31] disposition now realize there's still a
[23:34] struggle but i'm wanting you to be more
[23:36] mindful of is upon the new birth there's
[23:39] new life inside of you
[23:41] and this new life operates by a
[23:43] different kind of constitution it has a
[23:44] different disposition has different
[23:46] vulnerabilities different potentials
[23:48] if you have a history of bipolar
[23:50] disorder in your family if you have
[23:52] manic depresses in your family if you
[23:54] look back and there's all sorts of uh
[23:56] psychotic episodes to your family
[23:58] history when you're born again none of
[24:00] that carries over into the new birth
[24:01] experience
[24:03] i hope you i hope you recognize what i
[24:04] just said it doesn't carry over into the
[24:07] new life now that could still be in your
[24:09] flesh
[24:11] those things can still be there in your
[24:12] flesh but it's wholly different from the
[24:14] life that's been birthed inside of you
[24:16] because that germ came from god and the
[24:17] trigger to cause that to come to life
[24:19] came from god so it's holy a new nature
[24:22] brother brahm says you are a different
[24:24] person a different personality because
[24:26] you are a new creation
[24:29] think about that a new person a
[24:31] different a new creation is a different
[24:33] person and a different personality
[24:37] so there has to be there's something
[24:39] else expected of this person
[24:41] there's a new if i can put it this way
[24:43] there's a new personality to be
[24:44] developed
[24:46] there's a new life that has to be
[24:47] nurtured
[24:48] i think in the argument of nature and
[24:50] nurture when it comes to the individual
[24:51] or the person uh there's a whole lot
[24:53] that a whole lot related to your nature
[24:56] or your dna your parents that's going to
[24:58] determine what you're going to be
[25:00] but then there's a whole lot to your
[25:01] nurture that determines just how much
[25:03] you can develop within those parameters
[25:06] or how uh what things are triggered the
[25:08] negative sides to that dna it's all
[25:11] nature and nurture and listen it's the
[25:13] same thing by our natural
[25:15] our spiritual birth there's a new nature
[25:17] in the inside of you but then god just
[25:18] doesn't birth you and then throw you on
[25:20] a shelf and just leave you there until
[25:22] you can go birth the next one until
[25:23] we're all birthed and then he comes by
[25:25] and takes everybody on the shelf into
[25:26] the rapture no there's a nurture then of
[25:29] that nature to bring it into the
[25:30] expressed image of christ
[25:33] and so i would say then a character
[25:35] disorder
[25:36] and again i'm just laying this as a
[25:37] foundation so you can understand where
[25:38] my heart's coming from
[25:40] a character disorder is an imperfect
[25:42] expression of that personality
[25:45] bluebeam says you're a different person
[25:47] a different personality because you're a
[25:48] new creation a character disorder is an
[25:51] imperfect expression of that new
[25:54] different personality because the
[25:56] potentials are there
[25:58] there's no there's no son or daughter of
[26:00] god that is born
[26:02] uh with with some dna or some marker
[26:05] that relates to some disorder
[26:08] or some impairment it's a perfect seed
[26:12] now if you could it's we've we've laid
[26:14] the foundation now for a half hour
[26:17] and i want to now read a number of
[26:18] statements
[26:20] in uh for this in this next half of the
[26:22] service
[26:23] but please if you could
[26:25] think very very spiritually
[26:27] and and even press a little bit say lord
[26:29] i want to catch this i want to i want to
[26:32] recognize how this can be applicable to
[26:34] me
[26:35] in my heart and in my life
[26:37] and the message the greatest battle ever
[26:39] fought brother brahma says it got it
[26:41] it's got to come down the line of free
[26:42] moral agency
[26:44] you yourself let the word of god it's i
[26:48] think this is a
[26:49] very important concept that i i'll just
[26:53] say it even publicly to you
[26:56] that it's understandable that we would
[26:58] wrestle with the idea of election and
[26:59] free moral agency
[27:02] and how do these things how do these
[27:04] work together in the paradox of your
[27:05] chosen or by god you had no say in the
[27:07] matter well but then i've got to let god
[27:09] do something and it's it's a paradox
[27:11] isn't it
[27:13] i'm just going to leave it at that
[27:17] he says you don't come because your
[27:19] mother was a good woman you don't come
[27:20] because you're a good neighbor you come
[27:22] because that god calls you to come
[27:24] and you accept him on the basis of his
[27:27] word that's all you can do
[27:29] it's not it's not your mom is good or
[27:31] you're a good neighbor it's not anything
[27:33] you can do you don't even come on the
[27:34] basis of anything outward or emotional
[27:37] you come you accept him on the basis of
[27:39] his word
[27:41] that's that word what is what means
[27:43] everything
[27:45] that word if you can get everything out
[27:47] of the way all conscience all senses and
[27:50] just let the word come in that word will
[27:53] produce just exactly
[27:56] you catch that
[27:57] if you'll just let the word come in and
[28:00] then he refers to all conscience all
[28:01] senses
[28:02] then the word if it comes in and
[28:04] everything can be out of the way it'll
[28:06] produce just exactly he says here see
[28:09] what's it covered over with
[28:12] now
[28:12] you have to kind of maybe try to in your
[28:15] mind and i know that just by taking an
[28:17] excerpt from this passage because it's a
[28:19] very lengthy part where he's
[28:20] establishing a particular thought
[28:23] you have to kind of let your mind enter
[28:25] into the picture he's creating that the
[28:27] word has got to come into the person
[28:31] and he says but if you if you
[28:33] if you let get you have to get
[28:35] everything out of the way conscience and
[28:36] senses just let the word come in and
[28:38] then that word will produce exactly but
[28:41] he says see what's it covered over with
[28:43] i want you to look at it in this sense
[28:45] that the word can get covered over
[28:48] now it could be covered over externally
[28:51] to us where there's things in our
[28:53] spirits that are that are creating the
[28:55] distance and creating the gap clogging
[28:58] the channels to where we can't see the
[28:59] word of god we can't receive the word of
[29:01] god it's keeping it distant from us and
[29:03] those channels have to be kind of
[29:05] blown out and our heart has to open up
[29:07] he says you have to open up by line of
[29:09] free moral agency open up your heart and
[29:11] that can drop down into your heart and
[29:12] you can be born again but now i also
[29:14] want to take it a step further that once
[29:16] the word has been born again in your
[29:18] soul those channels still exist
[29:21] all those same senses that brother
[29:23] branham is talking about they still
[29:24] exist he says what it's what is it
[29:26] covered over with he says well these you
[29:28] say well his conscience and senses and
[29:30] so forth don't have anything to do with
[29:32] it brother branham certainly it does
[29:36] now this to me is very important because
[29:38] we say well it's the word in free moral
[29:40] agency it's the word and free moral
[29:41] agency
[29:42] and and i
[29:44] i remember one time i was preaching some
[29:45] meetings
[29:47] and i kind of i kind of set it up a
[29:49] little bit to where
[29:51] the i had a slide with a i think it was
[29:54] 70 something different emotional states
[29:55] on the slide
[29:57] and i said i want you to ponder these
[29:58] things and really uh find out whether or
[30:00] not you're characterized by any of these
[30:02] you struggle with any of these you know
[30:03] uh these things are real issues and so
[30:05] the next slide
[30:06] was you just need the holy ghost
[30:09] and i was kind of doing it to make a
[30:11] point and someone was like amen
[30:19] because there's more to it
[30:21] but i'm saying here that this the
[30:22] conscience and and memory and reason and
[30:25] affection and imagination these things
[30:27] are and even our are hearing and are
[30:30] seeing they're all related to it he says
[30:31] it doesn't have anything to do with it
[30:33] certainly it does he says but if you let
[30:35] the word come in and cover it over with
[30:38] conscience then it can't grow
[30:40] you catch that you let the word come in
[30:42] but now conscience is getting in the way
[30:44] imagination memory reason affection is
[30:46] getting away the word is there we we've
[30:48] received the baptism the holy ghost why
[30:49] don't why am i not always overcoming
[30:51] brother why why do i have bad days and
[30:53] why do i get upset and why do i doubt
[30:55] and why do i seem sometimes to get
[30:57] really cold it's there's no problem with
[30:59] the word there's no problem with the
[31:00] seed but it says the conscience covers
[31:03] it up and then it can't grow he says it
[31:05] will be a deformed word
[31:10] it's a deformed expression because he
[31:12] says the word will produce just exactly
[31:13] but if something comes in and gets in
[31:15] the way of the seed being expressed it
[31:17] produces a different expression he says
[31:19] it's a deformed word and then he uses
[31:21] this example did you ever see a good
[31:22] grain of corn planted in the ground and
[31:24] let a stick fall over it
[31:27] it'll grow crooked
[31:29] nothing wrong with wrong with the ground
[31:31] nothing even wrong with the seed
[31:33] something else comes over croc lays
[31:35] across it and it begins to grow crooked
[31:39] anybody anything that grows up will
[31:41] because something has hindered it
[31:44] somebody a hindrance conscience laying
[31:45] over it well that any and then he goes a
[31:47] step further i
[31:49] left this in here so he could see his
[31:51] emphasis well that's what's the matter
[31:52] of our pentecostal faith today we let
[31:54] too many things hinder it the faith that
[31:56] we've been taught the holy spirit that's
[31:58] been living in us we've let too many
[31:59] things looking at somebody else and the
[32:01] devil's always trying to put point you
[32:03] to somebody's failure but he tries to
[32:05] keep you away from the real testimony
[32:07] that's genuine
[32:09] what does it do when that happens it
[32:11] hinders the expression of the word
[32:13] that's inside of you you get some
[32:15] complex you begin to think about
[32:16] something the wrong way oh i don't want
[32:18] to do that this is what this person did
[32:19] well i don't want to believe that this
[32:20] is where they went and there's something
[32:22] that can hinder you from just letting
[32:23] your faith loose to accept all of the
[32:25] word of god in this day and walk in his
[32:27] promises of the hour and he says this is
[32:29] the same thing that's happened in the
[32:30] pentecostal faith he says even this holy
[32:33] spirit that's been living in us
[32:36] there's been a stick or something lay
[32:38] over it
[32:40] and now it's growing crooked because
[32:42] something is uh intercepted in its
[32:44] growth
[32:46] covered over it with conscience and it
[32:48] can't grow it's a deformed word can you
[32:50] see the visual picture that he's
[32:51] painting in this and the way he's saying
[32:53] the word is in you
[32:55] and that word is perfect and it's living
[32:57] inside of you but as you grow something
[32:59] just lays over in your life
[33:02] a branch falls down an event happens
[33:04] something takes place satan starts
[33:05] pointing you to somebody who's failed or
[33:07] somebody's abused you or somebody is a
[33:08] hypocrite something happens and in doing
[33:10] so it gets you crooked
[33:12] and it gets you you're not growing
[33:14] straight anymore
[33:16] it says because something's hindered it
[33:19] that's no
[33:20] that's no judgment oh look at that
[33:22] that's not an ear corn corn doesn't grow
[33:24] that way no that's corn
[33:27] something's just deformed it's growth
[33:30] i
[33:30] i think there's a lot of liberation in
[33:32] seeing
[33:33] these things correctly
[33:35] now in the in the sermon we would see
[33:38] jesus and i was
[33:40] caught
[33:41] by how many of these statements
[33:45] all were within a year period
[33:47] all the ones the things i'd find not
[33:49] just related to this deformative growth
[33:50] but even in some of these other
[33:51] statements i've been reading where
[33:53] brother brown says you're a different
[33:54] personality
[33:56] and and some of these other places that
[33:57] we've been reading from they all were
[33:59] just right up before the seals were
[34:01] opened
[34:02] and it stood out to me just personally
[34:05] to see how that that spirit of man
[34:08] in it
[34:09] in that dispensation just wrapping up
[34:11] these things related to the natural part
[34:13] because that capstone was coming that
[34:14] eagle anointing was going to begin to
[34:15] fly under the open of the seals
[34:18] so he says when we would see jesus
[34:20] there's only one creator that's god
[34:21] satan perverts what god has created
[34:28] there's only one other place that i
[34:29] drink water from something bigger
[34:32] and that's at brother paul's church
[34:35] a mug
[34:41] he says but as as but as long as you
[34:43] have faith in the creator
[34:45] in him
[34:47] god brings it back to its right place so
[34:50] satan is in the business of perverting
[34:52] and that genuine life that's on the
[34:53] inside of you he knows he can't take
[34:55] that life even if you've been born again
[34:57] he can't take that life
[34:59] but he'll try to do everything he can to
[35:01] pervert it or cast aspersions on it
[35:04] he says what if there was a stalk of
[35:05] corn growing and a chunk was laying on
[35:08] it it'd grow crooked
[35:11] that's the point we're trying to want
[35:12] you to see a stalk of corn this grain of
[35:14] wheat something that has life in it but
[35:16] something lays over the top of it it
[35:18] doesn't dispute or negate the life but
[35:20] it's going to change the way it grows it
[35:22] would grow crooked
[35:24] pick up move every obstacle that's
[35:25] hindering that
[35:27] and the sun that's sticking it upwards
[35:29] up and the sun that it's sticking up
[35:30] towards it'll finally grow
[35:33] that stalk of corn right out straight
[35:35] again
[35:36] i think there's different plants that
[35:38] you can you can tell where it gets its
[35:40] sunlight based upon the way that it's
[35:42] growing because it's going to grow to
[35:44] the light
[35:46] and ways that plants can even be uh
[35:49] their growth can be addressed by
[35:51] bolstering it and supporting it to get
[35:53] into to grow in its natural pattern and
[35:56] there's ways i guess they can they can
[35:57] uh they can grow square watermelon
[36:01] right
[36:02] and they can do all sorts of things to
[36:03] deform the life of those fruits and the
[36:05] lives of those vegetables
[36:07] by restricting its growth and putting
[36:09] parameters around it so it's going to
[36:11] grow where it can
[36:13] and if there's forces working against it
[36:14] say well i may not be able to grow in
[36:16] what i naturally would be but i'm going
[36:18] to grow and it boxes me in and it casts
[36:20] me in and i grow in the shape of the
[36:22] pressures that are all around me and
[36:24] saying if you could just get move every
[36:26] obstacle that's hindering it the sun
[36:29] that's shining on it the stalk of corn
[36:31] will grow straight again right to the
[36:33] sun
[36:35] so it's a matter of one orienting
[36:37] ourselves in the light of god's word and
[36:40] removing all these things that kind of
[36:42] cast us in in boxes in and want to make
[36:44] us cookie cutter message believers
[36:47] where we all try to conform to a
[36:48] particular
[36:50] view in a church or a way people dress
[36:52] the way people act and people do things
[36:54] and everyone just kind of tries to
[36:55] create this persona built around a
[36:57] personality that there's one personality
[37:00] we're striving to become and that's
[37:02] christ
[37:04] it's the word and we want god to take
[37:06] who we are in our individual
[37:08] peculiarities and our different callings
[37:10] and gifts
[37:11] and and we want to be free to be what he
[37:13] has called us to be
[37:15] as individuals we're not all called to
[37:17] do the same thing we don't all enjoy the
[37:20] same types of foods and recreations we
[37:21] don't all come from the same kind of
[37:23] background so there's a way that this
[37:25] word has got to be expressed in our
[37:28] callings in our lives in our cultures in
[37:30] our regions and whatever it is we are we
[37:32] want the word to take that and express
[37:34] itself through it without any hindrances
[37:38] he says cast out an evil spirit then
[37:40] people say well wasn't nothing nothing
[37:42] happened to me
[37:43] he says you go right back straight
[37:47] if you believe that and know that
[37:49] something happened to you there's
[37:50] nothing to keep you from straightening
[37:51] right back again you just hold on to it
[37:54] so if a spirit is cast out then you've
[37:56] got to stay in the light you got to
[37:58] remain under the influence you got you
[37:59] got then you'll go back straight may not
[38:01] feel like anything's happened but it's
[38:03] just the nature of this life that if
[38:05] encumbrances could be removed hindrances
[38:07] could be removed if anything that's
[38:08] boxing you in or any
[38:11] is cast aside then you can you can grow
[38:13] up straight
[38:21] another statement
[38:25] and the message influence
[38:28] as i said to little joseph i said
[38:31] little boy is born in this world
[38:34] he stands right in the middle of the
[38:35] road
[38:37] and he's pointed to calvary to christ
[38:40] there's a tree on either side of the
[38:42] road on the left side which i'd call
[38:44] wrong
[38:45] i'd catch
[38:46] just catch this visually in your mind
[38:48] a boy's a any child is born
[38:51] and he stands in the middle of the road
[38:53] and he's pointed to christ he's pointed
[38:54] to calvary there's a tree on either side
[38:56] of the road on the left side which i'll
[38:58] call the wrong
[39:00] if he just starts smacking little boys
[39:02] in the face because they smacked him
[39:05] i wonder why he was having this
[39:06] conversation with little joseph
[39:09] if he just starts smacking little boys
[39:10] in the face because they smacked him and
[39:12] if they start doing these things it
[39:14] pulls that boy with the influence and
[39:17] makes him crooked
[39:19] this is what happens in life this is
[39:21] what happens to kids they get around
[39:23] their own kind of influence they have
[39:24] their own kind of experiences in their
[39:26] life and they get beat up or they get
[39:28] bullied something happens and so they
[39:29] start fighting back and it begins to
[39:31] develop a certain character inside them
[39:33] a certain kind of nature and it's molded
[39:35] by these experiences and maybe they were
[39:37] vulnerable to something and now these
[39:39] life experiences are triggering
[39:40] something and brother bram says these
[39:42] influence
[39:43] influences make him crooked
[39:45] could have been born from this any child
[39:48] could be born in a family that's
[39:50] uh got certain tendencies to lie or to
[39:52] cheat or distill or some really bad
[39:55] characters in it but it often times
[39:57] takes something to push him in that
[39:59] direction
[40:00] and he says these other influences in
[40:02] life he's born right in the middle of
[40:04] the road he's pointed to calvary but
[40:06] something comes along and starts pushing
[40:07] him to the wrong side it makes him
[40:09] crooked he says but if he takes this
[40:11] other side of the road which is the holy
[40:13] spirit
[40:14] on the one side is the wrong on the
[40:16] other side is the holy spirit which
[40:18] points him straight to calvary and keeps
[40:20] him in that way it makes you grow
[40:22] straight
[40:24] your thoughts and this is a powerful
[40:25] thought this could be kids eat free
[40:27] right here it's just as easy to think
[40:29] good thoughts as it is to think bad
[40:32] i'll just accept that
[40:34] i'll just accept that it's just as easy
[40:35] to think good as it is to think bad just
[40:37] as easy to think good of those who speak
[40:39] evil of you
[40:41] as it is vice versa
[40:43] what a challenge is we heard it on uh
[40:45] sunday night on let no corrupt
[40:46] communication proceed out of your mouth
[40:49] and how are we even challenged with the
[40:50] example that brother brought him in a
[40:51] church setting where people were doing
[40:52] vulgar things and it seems that he would
[40:55] have had the right he would even say say
[40:56] what you want and would have the right
[40:58] to speak something but he restrained
[41:00] himself and spoke something
[41:02] that built up and something that
[41:04] preserved or something that did not uh
[41:07] something that honored god and god was
[41:09] pleased with he said it's just as easy
[41:11] to think good thoughts as it is bad
[41:12] thoughts it's just as easy to speak good
[41:15] or to think good of those who speak up
[41:17] evil of you as it is to think evil of
[41:19] people who think evil of you or speak
[41:21] evil of you
[41:22] if it's easy for you to think negative
[41:24] it's easy for you to take the negative
[41:25] side there could be influences in your
[41:27] life that have pushed you into that way
[41:29] and so you're beginning to think crooked
[41:31] but on the other side is the holy spirit
[41:32] that's pointing you straight to calvary
[41:34] and trying to tell you look change the
[41:36] way that you're thinking change the way
[41:37] that you're responding he says and a lot
[41:39] better it makes you grow straight stay
[41:40] straight with god
[41:44] can you see now
[41:46] i hope that it's becoming clear when i'm
[41:48] what i'm pondering in this thought of
[41:50] what a character disorder would be
[41:53] and how that there's a there's there's a
[41:55] life inside of us
[41:57] i will say you must be born again
[42:00] and those of you who have been born
[42:01] again there's a life inside of you
[42:03] that's longing to be expressed
[42:08] holy without
[42:09] blame is he says
[42:11] blameless
[42:13] preserved blameless
[42:15] now
[42:16] and i'm just going to share this in
[42:17] closing
[42:19] i had initially
[42:21] my my initial focus when i began to
[42:23] study this
[42:24] i've been it's been some months now when
[42:26] i started
[42:27] looking into these things and just
[42:28] waiting on the lord how he might desire
[42:30] to
[42:31] share it just because the lord will just
[42:33] impress it according to your needs it's
[42:34] according to your prayers
[42:36] if any of you think that you're going to
[42:37] come to church and hear what brother
[42:38] aaron wants to preach you're missing it
[42:40] you're missing it
[42:42] i don't even want to preach what i want
[42:43] to preach
[42:45] i i want
[42:46] i labor to know what would touch the
[42:48] heart of god and move his people i i
[42:50] just want i want to be in the channel to
[42:52] where i'm saying the things that you
[42:54] need to hear not the things that i enjoy
[42:55] studying
[42:56] and so as we were waiting on that as i
[42:58] began to study i it was initially very
[43:01] uh
[43:03] plain to me
[43:04] the the the natural types the spiritual
[43:08] and that there's a there's natural
[43:10] things that science looks at and the dsm
[43:12] looks at and these 157 different
[43:14] personality disorders and these
[43:16] different clusters and how you could
[43:18] kind of pick apart some of these and
[43:20] begin to find things in a spiritual
[43:22] sense and the fruits of the spirit and
[43:24] the way that paul would admonish us to
[43:26] act towards one another and to live
[43:27] decently and honestly you begin to look
[43:30] and say well these things may come to a
[43:33] point in the natural
[43:35] that cause someone to no longer behave
[43:37] normally in society in relation to
[43:39] certain events and relationship to other
[43:41] people to where there's actual diagnosis
[43:43] and treatment for these conditions but
[43:45] then on the other hand there's also
[43:47] things that we can do in a spiritual
[43:48] sense or that's related to our spiritual
[43:51] character and the way that we treat one
[43:53] another the way that we believe the word
[43:54] of god the way that we apply the word of
[43:56] god and it's all in a spiritual sense
[43:58] and initially that was kind of how i was
[44:00] seen you got this one side over here but
[44:02] let's look at the spiritual side in the
[44:04] real development of our character
[44:06] but over the last few months as i've
[44:08] studied this what i have recognized is
[44:11] has become so real to me
[44:13] as there has been a a blending of the
[44:16] natural and spiritual to where it is
[44:18] more it's a blending it's more
[44:20] pronounced i think than it could have
[44:21] ever been before
[44:24] that there would have been well if i
[44:25] could say it this way it kind of just
[44:27] pops in my head this way
[44:29] there was a time when the crazies stood
[44:31] out more
[44:33] right let's just be honest i'm not
[44:34] talking about in church i remember one
[44:36] time there was somebody who visited a
[44:38] church i was going to as a young kid
[44:40] and uh
[44:41] he was just some transient who believed
[44:43] the message and the church put him up in
[44:45] a hotel and the hotel called and said
[44:47] you got a problem he keeps clogging the
[44:48] toilet and he was taking the bible and
[44:50] ripping the pages out of the bible and
[44:52] sowing it back into the earth by
[44:53] flushing flushing the toilet and so yeah
[44:56] those
[44:57] those guys there's just some crazies out
[44:59] there but i just mean in the world there
[45:02] was a time when there was maybe just a
[45:03] real strict difference between people
[45:05] who kind of had their heads screwed on
[45:06] straight and those who didn't
[45:09] but
[45:10] i think even now more than ever things
[45:13] natural and things spiritual are
[45:15] blending
[45:17] and
[45:20] if i could say it uh
[45:23] i'll say this first
[45:27] that you cannot address a character
[45:29] disorder without addressing personality
[45:31] disorders
[45:33] in other words
[45:34] there's such a blending now
[45:36] that if you want if you're wanting
[45:38] someone to display the right character
[45:40] of christ you're more likely addressing
[45:43] something in the person's natural spirit
[45:47] you're most likely addressing maybe some
[45:49] trauma in their past maybe some thought
[45:50] process maybe something that actually
[45:52] needs healing you cannot then address
[45:54] perfect character without addressing the
[45:56] healing of the heart
[45:59] talking about perfect character but then
[46:00] there has to be a healing of the mind
[46:01] the healing of the heart and there's a
[46:03] direct connection between our spiritual
[46:05] growth and our natural state
[46:08] and and we are living in a time when
[46:11] there is a blending of time and eternity
[46:15] at no other age
[46:17] at this juncture where we could say
[46:19] there was a time in the beginning of
[46:21] mankind begin to walk out of eternity
[46:24] into time
[46:26] but we are living in a time now where
[46:28] mankind the bride is walking out of time
[46:31] into eternity
[46:32] and so there's a tremendous blending
[46:35] and god by his word is achieving a
[46:37] harmony between a heavenly groom and an
[46:40] earthly bride god is by his word
[46:43] achieving this harmony here we are we're
[46:44] earthbound right now we're born by first
[46:47] nature of natural parents we're living
[46:49] on earth we're breathing oxygen we have
[46:51] this natural experience this natural
[46:53] life but god by his word is bringing a
[46:56] harmony between an earthly bride in a
[46:58] heavenly bright groom and they're
[47:00] walking lockstep they're coming into
[47:02] this union
[47:04] brother abraham says in an invisible
[47:05] union oh that spiritual union of christ
[47:07] and his church now when the flesh is
[47:09] becoming word and the word is becoming
[47:12] flesh manifested vindicated
[47:15] that's the time we're living in
[47:17] we're living in a time
[47:19] when the flesh is becoming word
[47:22] not necessarily the word becoming flesh
[47:24] but now that which was flesh becoming
[47:26] word
[47:27] as the second adam the last adam
[47:30] is a spiritual heavenly being who is
[47:33] made flesh and walked amongst us and it
[47:35] was the word made flesh now the flesh is
[47:38] being made word he says it that way and
[47:40] i believe there's something to it when
[47:41] the flesh is becoming word and the word
[47:43] is becoming flesh manifested and
[47:45] vindicated that's the time that we're
[47:46] living in so there is a spiritual
[47:48] capitalist spiritual that is uniting
[47:50] with the natural
[47:53] there's a union taking place
[47:55] and i would certainly say that's in a
[47:56] positive sense
[47:58] but if it's happening in a positive
[47:59] sense since it's also happening in a
[48:01] negative sense
[48:04] and the sense that there's some
[48:05] deterioration
[48:08] whatever harmony exists between god
[48:11] christ and his bride
[48:13] there's this further
[48:15] uh deterioration of mankind
[48:18] and the message what house will you
[48:19] build me he's praying he says dear god
[48:21] as we stand here on this platform which
[48:23] represents right over the altar here we
[48:24] realize that we are a dying race of
[48:26] people
[48:28] as far as this earth is concerned
[48:30] we looked out we look out upon the
[48:32] streets and see sin wrote everywhere and
[48:35] the glory of the lord is swiftly
[48:37] departing
[48:40] and we know when the glory of the lord
[48:41] goes up so will the church go with it
[48:44] so the glory of the lord is swiftly
[48:46] departing there's a diminishing if i say
[48:49] there's a diminishing to that glory
[48:52] if it seems maybe a bit odd
[48:55] think of how less
[48:56] christian virtue
[48:58] is lifted up even within quote unquote
[49:01] christianity
[49:02] think of what how america would have
[49:04] been characterized a hundred years ago
[49:05] and what would have been her backbone
[49:07] and what would have been her plea and
[49:08] what would have been the uh uh even the
[49:11] the character of politicians and what
[49:13] you would expect from a person sometimes
[49:15] they go back and they wrestle with the
[49:16] writings of our founding fathers because
[49:18] they don't quote the bible this way or
[49:20] they're not always saying god this and
[49:22] god that well it was because it was
[49:23] assumed
[49:25] it was assumed in their language and in
[49:27] their discourse and their confidence in
[49:28] one another that they were god-fearing
[49:31] bible-believing and if they weren't they
[49:32] let you know and you could find it
[49:34] readily in some people's writings what
[49:35] kind of differences they had or
[49:37] viewpoints they had but where it may be
[49:39] remained un unmentioned it was assumed
[49:42] in their speech that the that the bible
[49:44] was god's word
[49:46] the son of god there was a there's a
[49:48] certain way of looking at these things
[49:49] and examining these things uh that was
[49:52] from the heart of people that were
[49:53] sincere with the word of god we're not
[49:55] there anymore
[49:57] we're not aware of their churches that
[49:59] maybe brother branham would say oh
[50:00] there's believers in every church and
[50:02] there's the holy spirit in this
[50:04] denomination and that denomination we
[50:05] have all these people that are trying to
[50:07] come together that god's trying to bring
[50:09] together we're not living in that same
[50:10] time we live in a time when god had said
[50:13] those churches are bankrupt of life
[50:15] they're sterile they're dead and so the
[50:17] glory of god is consolidating it's
[50:19] limited it's not as pervasive as it was
[50:21] the glory of the lord is swiftly
[50:23] departing why it's being consolidated in
[50:25] the very small elect group called the
[50:27] bride and when she goes the glory of god
[50:30] goes with her amen
[50:33] brother braham says the very next month
[50:34] in communion he says and we can also
[50:35] look around and see that that that the
[50:37] way that the human mind is leaving the
[50:40] people
[50:43] he says we can't stay too much longer
[50:45] we'd be in a complete insane institution
[50:48] the whole world will be
[50:49] so we're at the end time
[50:52] the human mind is leaving the people
[50:55] this is not this is not just isolated
[50:57] individuals this is this is society at
[50:59] large
[51:00] we could look at it again in revelations
[51:02] chapter three and you could just go
[51:04] there and read it again read it as a
[51:05] diagnosis of people thinking one thing
[51:08] but the reality being another
[51:10] it's an insanity
[51:13] there there is a madness that is
[51:14] settling upon the people and he says
[51:16] we're if we stay too much longer it
[51:18] would be a complete insane institution
[51:20] institution the world would be but what
[51:22] happens when everyone goes crazy they
[51:24] all think they're in the right mind
[51:27] well we're all thinking this and we're
[51:29] all thinking that and we're all thinking
[51:30] this and everyone just kind of accepts
[51:32] and goes along with it and it doesn't
[51:34] mean they're any closer to truth they
[51:35] just have a consensus of crazy
[51:41] but the bible says let this mind be in
[51:42] you which was also in christ jesus
[51:45] what i was studying today was on
[51:47] different places in scripture
[51:51] that talked about a man not being in his
[51:53] right mind
[51:56] and
[51:58] how that we
[52:00] are given a sound mind
[52:03] let this mind be in you which was also
[52:05] in christ jesus this is a sound mind
[52:08] this is a sane mind
[52:11] there is a there's a mind that is
[52:14] birthed inside of us and think it says
[52:15] let this mind be in you isn't it
[52:17] interesting
[52:18] uh a phrase to where it's something
[52:20] you're permitting
[52:22] something you're allowing
[52:24] let this mind be in you let it have
[52:26] preeminence
[52:28] think on these things and order your
[52:30] life according to give it place let this
[52:33] mind be in you it doesn't make us double
[52:35] minded it's setting this mind the one
[52:37] that we receive by natural birth that
[52:39] has memories and imagination conscience
[52:41] reason and affection to let it become
[52:44] subject to the mind of christ that if
[52:46] there's anything contrary to the word of
[52:47] god we acknowledge it that's contrary to
[52:49] the word of god any memory any
[52:51] imagination whatever it might be that's
[52:52] conscious of the word of god we
[52:54] acknowledge that's contrary to the word
[52:55] of god and we let the mind of christ
[52:57] have preeminence
[52:59] brother brahman says in the message
[53:00] identification we are invited by god to
[53:02] make him as an example and let our
[53:04] character be molded like his.
[53:07] he says what a thing my i say amen what
[53:09] a thing
[53:11] we are invited to let our character be
[53:13] molded like his to let our character be
[53:16] molded into his glorious character then
[53:19] when we let his character be in us then
[53:21] we become sons by having the mind of
[53:23] christ mind which is his character your
[53:26] mind makes your character let the mind
[53:29] paul said of christ let this mind that
[53:31] was in christ being you let that mind of
[53:34] christ be in you it molds the character
[53:37] of the son of god
[53:39] if you could have the right kind of
[53:40] mindset if you could have a clear mind
[53:42] you got a free unencumbered mind if you
[53:44] could get if it's not covered up with
[53:46] all these other senses and conscience
[53:48] and things then that mind molds the
[53:51] character of a son of god
[53:53] it's got to be free it's got to be
[53:55] unencumbered it can't have some chunk
[53:57] laying over the top of it some stick or
[53:59] branch laying over the top of it let
[54:00] this mind be free let it be
[54:03] let this mind be in you
[54:05] don't don't uh don't prod it don't poke
[54:08] it don't hinder it don't restrict it
[54:10] don't reason with it let this mind let
[54:12] it alone let it be it's what it is
[54:15] let this mind be let it be in you let it
[54:17] be free let it be unencumbered let it be
[54:19] unrestrained don't box it in we talk
[54:21] about putting god in a box putting god
[54:23] in a box well we're putting the mind of
[54:25] christ in a box sometimes
[54:28] but it's that mind of christ if we can
[54:30] just let it be
[54:32] it'll mold the character
[54:35] not moldy character
[54:37] it'll mold the character of the son of
[54:39] god
[54:40] brother brahm said our character is
[54:41] molded in there by the life that is in
[54:43] us
[54:45] so there's a life in you that wants to
[54:46] mold your character
[54:48] so there's a there's a
[54:50] just in the natural this is where
[54:51] natural types of spiritual you're born a
[54:53] natural man and then the life you live
[54:55] mould your character
[54:59] therefore there's also in the spiritual
[55:01] by the new birth there's a life in there
[55:03] that wants a molder character
[55:06] my closing statement's a lengthy one but
[55:08] i want to read this in closing in the
[55:09] messiah brother and says man in his
[55:11] natural condition
[55:13] the way we are now you can see that he's
[55:14] much more than an animal
[55:16] as we try to say we are because man in
[55:18] his fallen estate yet being a fallen son
[55:20] of god he can still better himself
[55:22] he has an intelligence he builds himself
[55:24] a better house living conditions
[55:26] he makes himself better travel
[55:28] conditions
[55:29] he can speed himself through the air now
[55:31] at 1900 miles an hour what is it
[55:33] actually we can fly
[55:34] captain
[55:36] how many miles an hour are you flying
[55:40] not that fast so they still haven't
[55:41] quite gotten there yet
[55:44] he can speed himself through the air at
[55:46] 1900 miles an hour in a jet plane a
[55:47] rocket he's made himself so he can
[55:50] almost travel around the world just in
[55:52] 24 hours i think that's pretty close
[55:53] right
[55:55] he's smart intelligent
[55:57] he's made up in the image in the
[55:59] likeness of god and in him is light
[56:02] now for instance when a man gets saved
[56:06] the light that comes into him is about
[56:08] like this little white button on my
[56:10] shirt
[56:13] my man gets saved
[56:15] that when he when a man's born again a
[56:17] little white button like a button on my
[56:19] shirt that's when god comes into the
[56:21] inner part of a man
[56:23] and a man is made up in a system of
[56:25] tabernacles in the outer courts then the
[56:26] holy place the holiest of holies the
[56:28] shekinah glory on the inside the veil
[56:30] walking us through the
[56:32] the elements of the temple is now in the
[56:34] elements of the man the body spirit and
[56:36] soul it's in that soul in that holy of
[56:38] holies
[56:40] he says the holiest of holies with a
[56:41] shekinah glory about the size of a
[56:43] button he says it's just like it comes
[56:44] in and that for the next couple
[56:46] sentences he talks about self-will
[56:48] and the senses of the body and spirit he
[56:50] starts breaking those down but for
[56:52] time's sake i want to skip he says now
[56:53] when a man is converted
[56:55] say just like that little white button
[56:57] starts in his heart now that part is god
[57:01] and when he's born again with the spirit
[57:03] of god god's spirit dwells in him
[57:06] now he can let that spirit grow
[57:09] and take out all the roots of bitterness
[57:12] and press god's way through him again
[57:14] he can become back in the same condition
[57:17] that he was when he was in the garden of
[57:18] eden
[57:20] just start as a button and end up a man
[57:23] just starting as a little button he says
[57:25] but if he can let it grow and take out
[57:27] all the roots of bitterness and whatever
[57:29] else there might be
[57:31] and press god's way through him and
[57:32] again
[57:34] he can become a man in the same
[57:35] condition in an interesting it's going
[57:36] to work in now it's going to work out
[57:38] jesus said in mark 11 24 verily very i
[57:40] say unto you if you say to this mountain
[57:41] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[57:43] but believe that what you have said will
[57:44] come to pass you can have what you said
[57:46] that puts him right back supreme again
[57:49] it puts him right back in the condition
[57:52] now we're made up of light meters inside
[57:54] of us is cosmic light
[57:56] that cosmic like is a light that they
[57:58] can take an x-ray with the x-ray doesn't
[58:00] come from the x-ray light it comes from
[58:02] your own light
[58:04] now this is the part i really want you
[58:05] to focus on and if that cosmic like say
[58:07] could be pushed to a place
[58:09] to where it's not cosmic light but
[58:10] eternal light
[58:13] i want i want the eternal light to get
[58:15] pushy
[58:17] get pushed to a place where it's eternal
[58:19] light god could dwell supremely to do
[58:22] our thinking do our walking do our
[58:25] talking then it's no longer the man it's
[58:27] god in the man
[58:30] if he's got light life eternal life is
[58:33] the light of god that dwells in the man
[58:34] notice how beautiful the statement is if
[58:36] he yields to the spirit the more he
[58:38] becomes unmanned sinner-like and becomes
[58:41] more godlike
[58:43] that's what we want in our lives to
[58:45] become unmanned sinner-like
[58:47] to become less
[58:49] of a natural man less of an earthly man
[58:51] less of a carnal man less of a
[58:53] sinner-like person and become more
[58:56] god-like
[58:57] that's what the word of god can do in
[58:59] our lives that's what we want to give
[59:00] him full availability to do
[59:05] i believe i i'll say this with all my
[59:07] heart
[59:08] if it takes god moving supernaturally
[59:11] whatever it's going to take to get you
[59:13] to a place to believe that god can begin
[59:15] to do this that's my desire as your
[59:16] pastor whatever it takes for god to
[59:19] supernaturally get your attention that
[59:21] what he's doing in this hour is a
[59:22] perfecting of the whole person for the
[59:25] purpose of a translation and whatever
[59:27] it's going to take to get your attention
[59:29] to say god i'm ready to let you get this
[59:32] eternal light to come into my heart or
[59:34] this eternal life that's in my heart to
[59:36] begin to get pushy with all the cosmic
[59:38] light and all the man-made things and
[59:40] all the memories imagination reasons and
[59:43] affections to let it get pushy to push
[59:46] all of that out so i can become more
[59:47] godlike
[59:50] i whatever it takes for for us to come
[59:52] to that place i said god let it be
[59:56] i and i i mean that if it's got to be
[59:59] there has to be a change of dynamics in
[1:00:01] our church services there has to be a
[1:00:03] change in our way of worship if there
[1:00:04] has to be something that god needs to do
[1:00:06] and a very outward a supernatural way to
[1:00:10] get your attention i said god you do
[1:00:12] what you have to do to get the people's
[1:00:13] attention but in the final analysis what
[1:00:16] i want is on a monday morning some
[1:00:18] unmanned unsinner like people and more
[1:00:21] godlike people
[1:00:23] not just living until the next revival
[1:00:25] not just living until the next
[1:00:26] outpouring but people that are so
[1:00:28] impacted by the divine so caught by the
[1:00:31] vindication of god's promises that they
[1:00:33] purpose in their heart that they can
[1:00:35] live above the things of the world and
[1:00:36] be jesus christ
[1:00:40] i really desire to see souls saved a
[1:00:42] desire to see people's lives changed
[1:00:45] and you're the only you're the only
[1:00:47] channel you're the only outlet for it
[1:00:50] it's a life that you live
[1:00:52] and if there's just this
[1:00:54] just this much inside of you
[1:00:57] it can push out
[1:00:59] all the bitterness
[1:01:01] just just the size of this little button
[1:01:02] that's all it is
[1:01:04] just this little button is all it starts
[1:01:06] with
[1:01:06] but you let it push out
[1:01:10] god bless you let's stand
