TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title this morning is going to be a humble home and we'll hopefully touch on a few things that could give that some perspective but in using this phrase a humble home I wanting to maybe conjure up some thoughts within your mind and a particular attitude maybe that you could begin to consider and we are magnifying very specific characteristics of what we would call a home not just a house or a dwelling but an actual home could have just as easily named this part three of a home of Honor and uh really um kind of went back and forth on a few different titles I don't know why I was resisting just using a part three but just seemed that it wasn't clicking for me but we are just picking up where we had to leave off last Sunday morning with a little bit of review but in that home of Honor we were looking at the characteristics of honesty um no hypocrisy where there's no pretense and drawing from this uh Parable and how that Jesus is using the Pharisee as an example or he's addressing their covetous attitude so there's a lot that's being expressed there's things that we've looked at in terms of financial decisions or even transactions that we're making so there's a lot that may have to do with uh just uh greed and lust for money and possessions but then it it's maybe in a bigger context it's just an overall attitude and feeling towards one another and people uh one of the themes that I've been studying and probably get into in the next few Services has just been kind of summarized in my mind is just just be nice we need just be nice if people were nice and so that's maybe part of what's in this uh thought on a home of honor and a humble home I'm sure you've heard the phrase uh a humble abode and it might be something that we use welcome to my humble abode or we might refer to something in that way but uh when we think of a humble home or a humble house or a humble AB boat I think we're uh maybe naturally just thinking in terms of Optics that oh that that's a simple home and it's a it's unpretentious and there you know it's not off-putting or you know a lot of gingerbread or just things that make make it look really really nice but just something that's modest and so modesty uh Simplicity and that word Simplicity the Simplicity of Christ is actually a really deep subject uh it's also that just humility it's my humble abode it's something that's just a welcoming it's inviting uh it's simple it's modest and and so that's my uh those are the things I'm hoping to kind of track a little bit this morning in the thought on a humble home now if you could just uh recall the script scriptures that we've read I won't go back over these but I'd like to bring back to your remembrance this parable of Devas and Lazarus and how that in this Parable that we just wrote Jesus is addressing that self-serving self-preserving mindset of the Pharisees and even this behavior that was in this certain rich man to where he had a lot of wealth he had a lot of opportunity but he didn't use that for anyone else's benefit he only did it for himself and so we're dealing with selfishness and to be selfish is you care only about about yourself you're devoted to only yourself and you're only concerned with your own interest uh it's a self-devotion it's actually a quite a remarkable thought to think of one who's devoted to themselves and so when you're selfish you care only about your own interest you're only concerned about your own needs and we're kind of we're wanting to contrast that with being selfless which is you're concerned with the needs of others you're concerned about the desires of others and really in some ways more than your own now you're concerned about this person's needs more than your own needs you're concerned about this person's situation more than your own situation and and there's a thought where you say well then what about me who's worried about me well that's I think that's what feeds the selfishness is when nobody is giving the other person the benefit of the doubt of maybe they're looking after me so if I look out after them we're all covered and so it is something that we should strive for in not being selfish but being selfless and I was studying for some time last year and the Lord was just dealing with me on some things I think it might fit uh coming up just on altruism and this new philosophy that kind of came out the last couple decades of effective altruism where there's uh you know we want to put our resources and money and efforts behind the things that do the greatest good for the greatest number of people and there's you'll even find that even in a lot of these uh movements and ideas where they they recognize needs and they want to address them uh that it falls short that there's something that they're not taking into consideration and I only surface this that to say this that Christianity is the best way to live this the the word of God it covers all the efforts of effective altruism or those who who are looking after you know who are worried about climate change and those who are worried about economies and all those things if you really just fully if we could all fully embrace the principle of scripture and we could all Embrace Jesus Christ the economics would be fine the climate would be fine uh the poor would be looked after there's just the the word of God is the solution and the word of God addresses all sorts of biases and instincts and jealousies and and and lust and it really is the best way to live and so there is uh in this Parable in Luke chapter 16 of Devas and Lazarus we're using Devas as the the the Latin for a certain rich man they it is a Pharisee attitude that's being addressed and Jesus identified the Pharisees with hypocrisy where there were certain things that they would do outwardly for their own benefit their own reputation and they're not so much concerned about the positive impact it has on other people or even worse the negative impact that that might have on people where there's this pretense there show and and this is why I'm doing it to make myself look good not to make you feel better about yourself or to do anything that might encourage you but it's just a selfish interest and we see that this certain rich man even when he is in Hell he's concerned only with himself even in hell he looks up and he sees Lazarus and he knows him by name and he he's able to call out to him and he sees that he's in heaven and I believe Jesus structured it that way to make this point that in Hell he's still only concerned about his thirst his torment so he says have mercy on me have Lazarus just dip his finger in some water and then come visit me in the flames and relieve me of my torment and he's clearly only concerned about himself because he doesn't even think about what those ramifications might be for Lazarus whether or not he could cross over into hell and relieve him of this torment and make his way back or what that might mean to torment Lazarus he didn't care about Lazarus he only concerned he was only concerned with himself now Jesus gives this parable of the rich man and the beggar after after he has given a parable about an unjust Steward and when he gives the parable of the unjust Steward it's to that that the Pharisees who were Covetous uh derided him and then Jesus kind of zeros in on that read knowing their thoughts and he is challenging that Pharisee religion and that idea through this parable of the beggar and the rich man but he's still building off of the thought of the unjust Steward and if we did take time to go back and read it we find that there was a rich man who had a a steward that he threatened to fire unless he could show in his accounts that he was doing what he should and the steward went and made deals with the debtors so that he could be looked after once he was fired so he knew he was toast he knew he was going to get cooked so he made some deals with these vendors so that they would have mercy on him whenever he was fired and maybe he would have a place to stay he'd have a means of income and he says himself in the parable I don't want to work hard and I'm Too Proud to Beg so I need to take advantage of my master in order to gain favor with his debtors so that I can be taken care of once I lose my job and we see that he acted selfishly he acted in his own interest he was self-serving in his uh methods he was protecting himself in what he did he wasn't trying to increase his master's bottom line nor was he trying to do the debtor any favors he was only looking out after himself not concerned about what those ramifications might be for his employer not concerned about what those ramifications may have meant to the clients he was only looking after himself so both in the rich man and the unjust Steward they never looked beyond themselves only concerned with themselves their own interest their own needs at the expense of others needs and we were looking at this last Sunday on how these Parables teach us and Christ is teaching us that we should not live for our solely for our own benefit that the decisions we make the life we live the way that we uh uh conduct ourselves should we should take into consideration other people when we're acting and Jesus is very being very specific to those who have don't use what you have solely for yourself but use it and share it for the benefit of others be generous with what God has given you the scripture has been used quite a bit lately and we used it last Sunday 1 Timothy chapter 6: 17 and 18 charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded nor trust in uncertainty riches this ought to be a comfort to all of us rich people who are here today that if we're rich we're not going straight to hell but we have specific charges that we ought to not be arrogant presumptuous that we not be lifted up or trust in the riches that we have but trust in the Living God and recognize that it's the Living God who has given us these riches to enjoy because God gives us richly all things to enjoy and have him having given to us all things to enjoy all things that we have are his and we're looking out after them as stewards and therefore we we look at our time we look at our money we look at our relationships we look at our possessions and we ought to have some pride of ownership I think is is good in some respects but also maybe in a better way of thinking God's given me this car God's given me this house God's given me this church or he's given me this health given me this body giving me these opportunities giving me this job and we should look out after them as stewards whatever you do do it with your whole heart do it as unto the Lord uh don't do halfway jobs if you if God has given you a job and sometimes we T oh God gave me this great job and we don't do it well and so who are we disrespecting at the end of day well I'm still getting paid and I this is a union job I don't have to worry about this well who gets the glory in that and so there are God giving us these things we are stewards over these things and those that are rich are charged that they do good now it's not that we all of us poor people are thinking I'm not po I'm not rich so I don't have to do good he's actually telling them with do good with your wealth go do good with your privilege or your opportunity and be rich in Good Works be ready to distribute willing to communicate if we could have just summarized it maybe in modern day language don't be selfish don't be selfish but be selfless if God has given you certain resources given you time certain advantages and certain opportunities don't use them solely to advance yourself and don't use them to make yourself look good there's a reason why I think a lot of this is kind of prefaced with the image of the the the Pharisee who would do good but only to make himself look good and so a lot of it was for pretense and self advancement but there should be this attitude to where with what God has given me with what I have in my hand with what opportunities and resources I have and and I'm being very uh deliberate in using that phrase and say you guys who have money and you who make six figures and you who have this and you who have your house paid off and you who don't have a car payment I I'm not so much I'm not interested in in the cash aspect or or the money aspect but in the totality of time and energy and effort and all sorts of opportunities that would be an umbrella for all things Leo DEA everything that we're rich in everything that we're increased in we ought to be selfless and not selfish with it now that that concludes review portion and I apologize I I I don't think it does it justice as I believe the Lord was really with us last Sunday and had a uh some very specific things to address and I trust that you were able to catch that now in Luke chapter 16 as we've been looking at these two Parables and and looking at these uh almost the entire chapter chist Christ introduces us to a certain rich man Devas a man of privilege a man of opportunity but he was selfish later Jesus is approached by a certain ruler this is right where I stopped on Sunday and brother Branham takes him in the message leadership and some other places and he uses the story of the Rich Young Ruler and he connects it to this rich man in the parable of Lazarus and the rich man and he he uh goes to Great Lengths to say that the Rich Young Ruler is the the rich man that we later on see in hell and so we see this younger Devas faced with a decision something's obviously turning over in his heart something is uh he's confronted with the question of eternal life as how brother Brandon phrases it and he has to satisfy this conviction or this burden so he's going to address it and I want you to as we kind of go forward in the Bible we're going backwards in the life of Devas if does that make sense going to go back to the future here and we're going to be going forward in scripture but when we go forward in scripture we're actually seeing this rich man who whose gate Lazarus laid at and was disregarded who disregarded Lazarus we're going to see him in real life and in Luke chapter 18: 18 but if you want to turn to Mark chapter 10 it says in Luke chapter 18 so as we read in Luke 16 if you get to 18 that's where you'll see uh this ruler's Love of Money come to into into being it says that he comes to Christ he says good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life one thing I was wrestling with uh last week was this notion of what can I do to inherit an inheritance is not necessarily earned and inheritances sometimes are typically based upon relationship or something that's given and not necessarily something that is earned and so I don't know if it was just the translation and I think maybe it was deliberate but it's what shall I do to inherit eternal life so he wanted to do something but maybe he didn't think he deserved it or he was wanting to do something but he didn't want to have to work too hard I'm not sure why he says what can I do to inherit but it reeks of the pharisaic religion or attitude of what can I do a and being concerned with external rules and the outward Merit of something what can I do to inherit eternal life so we realize that there's something centr but he maybe there's something he thinks he can Merit or do and the way that you inherit typically is by relationship and you become a son you don't do something you become you're you're born again into the kingdom of God and therefore you become an heir there's nothing that you do per se now in Mark 10: 17-31 I hope to just read through this and make a much better progress than we did last time and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life this is we call him the Rich Young Ruler this is Devas in preview Jesus has already given these Parables of the unjust Steward and the rich man and the beggar so these things are already in his teaching but now we see a real life example of what he was talking about why callest thou me good there's none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and I believe it's in the Book of Matthew where he says and love thy neighbor as thyself is added to it and the this ruler answers and said and he's a certain ruler is what he's referred to in Luke chapter 18 answers and says master all these have I observed from my youth that's quite a statement then Jesus beholding him loved him and said one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor now if you could really I know we're reading through this but wrestle with the text here Jesus tells him uh you know the Commandments uh elicits them the Rich Young Ruler says I have observed all of these and I remember what many many years ago a couple decades ago I remember preaching and said I made the comment well I think this it seems to me like he's lying and uh it opened up quite a a discussion and debate for some time with the host Pastor on how being a liar was probably the worst thing that you could be and for me to accuse him of being a liar was was treacherous and so I'm not saying he's a liar but it's hard to believe right that he loved his neighbor as himself that he was doing everything that he ought to do and he was H uh that he fully had complied but let's just give him the benefit of the doubt because Jesus doesn't call him out on it but he just says one thing you lack okay you've done great you've observed all the Commandments you're not lying you're telling the truth but you still lack one thing sell everything that you have and give to the poor now that phrase sell what you have and give to the poor now he's not telling us to do that necessarily and we could say thank goodness uh but he's but this is a challenge to this man and says sell all you have and give to the poor it must have struck at the core of something in this rich man's heart because because of his later response but notice how Jesus then defines or amplifies what this means to sell all you have and give to the poor what the effect is because he says what shall I do to inherit eternal life I believe that Christ is hitting on this he says and if you sell what you have and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven the treasure in heaven was directly reflected upon how he would use what he was given in this life his riches if he was to sell them and give it to the for the benefit of the poor sell all his possessions and give to the poor that that would be a transaction that would Merit him blessing or Treasures in Heaven and as a ruler this ought to be if he's seeking after eternal life and he's saying I what can I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus not necessarily a head fake but says well you know the Commandments and did have you done all the Commandments he says yes so he says well then one thing you lack to have eternal life is stop living selfishly live for for others which is perfectly eternal life and you'll be investing in Eternal Treasures you will be investing in eternal life sell whatever you have and give to the poor that is how we uh make investments in heaven that is how we have Treasures in Heaven and then he says and come take up the cross and follow me we'll revisit that phrase because it wasn't the one thing he lacked is resolved by selling everything he has giving to the poor following Christ taking up the cross and following Christ and he was sad this Devas as we would see him as a young man was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions Jesus looked round about and say saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God the disciples were astonished at his words but Jesus answered again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God so there's the trust the Reliance upon the comfort and the Leisure that wealth can give the complacency that one can develop perceiving them to be the blessings of God or trusted in them that they'll always be able to get them out of trouble say is it easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved saved and Jesus looking upon them sayith with men it is impossible but not with God for With God all things are possible it's amazing that statement we often quote at least in this particular phrase in an instance is in response to the possibility of a rich man entering into heaven a Rich Man Without God is not going to enter into heaven With God all things are possible then Peter began to say unto him Lo we have left all and have followed thee there's this uh connection maybe to what he asked the Rich Young Ruler to do to sell everything you have and come follow me Peter's saying well we've left everything we've abandoned everything to follow you and Jesus answered and and verily I say unto you there's no man that hath left house or brother or sister or father or mother or wife or children or LS for my sake and the gospels so we cannot give away everything that we own for our own sakes we can't do it according to human metrics or just to be effective altruist uh we cannot do it in a carnal way but it's for the gospel's sake for the sake of Christ anyone that has done so shall receive a h hundredfold now in this time houses and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands and with with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life there's the the notion that sacrificing ourselves for the cause of Christ is storing up Treasures in Heaven and he ends this with but many that are first shall be last and the last first quite a phrase especially if you continue to the preceding chapters I think believe it's maybe Matthew chapter uh 19 and 20 where he he amplifies the last and first to the parable of the the the um that 12h hour worker who got a penny just like everyone else a and and he says I need labors I'll pay you a penny to labor in the Harvest that have honor that have opportunities in this life will be impoverished in the life to come the poor the Beggars they will be received into Paradise it's the very image of what took place when he gave the parable in Luke chapter 16 in Luke chapter 18 we see the rich man asking the question being told what he can do to receive eternal life essentially is sell all you have live for Christ abandon yourself to the gospel and he goes away grieved because the Bible says he was very sorrowful for he was very rich and so there's this image now of Devas this rich man in Luke chapter 16 and Lazarus this beggar because Jesus says many that are first the rich man is going to be in Hell tormented and the Begger is going to be in the bosom of Abraham he was very sorrowful for he was very rich excessively Rich it is uh it is beyond what was necessary and having riches he trusted in him and having these this trust in riches it cultivated within himself a Reliance on it and a sense of entitlement to it to where he wasn't willing to give it up the Bible doesn't tell us but if Jesus would have said sell all you have uh and and then he could just put that money in the bank it might have been an easy proposition you want me to liquidate my stocks fine I I I'll put it all in cash and I'll just I I'll put it in the bank and I'll earn a little interest on it and I'll follow you and it'll be there when I get back so it I mean this is just me thinking out loud was it the fact that he asked him to give to the poor is that where is that where the rub ultimately was I don't mind getting rid of my stuff but why should I give it to the poor why why should I sell everything that I've earned or that I've received and then let somebody else benefit from my hard work so it it had cultivated this sense of entitlement where he had earned those deserved those they were his and if he was to get rid of them somebody else ought not to benefit from it I myself should benefit and enjoy these riches so he did have an attitude of privilege and I use the word privilege just to trigger some people but Jesus says take up the cross and follow me when he tells him to take up the cross and follow him he has something very specific in mind this this isn't the first time that he used this phrase but he's he he is calling back to something he had said before Mark chapter 8 vers 34- 38 when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it notice just how much that fits with what he was saying in Mark chapter 10 after this Rich Young Ruler personified the very things that he was addressing he says no man has given up these things for my sake in the gospels who will not benefit in this life and the life to come so he says whosoever will lose his life for the sake of the Gospel whoever will lose his life for my sake I how shall have his life preserved for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul there's nothing in the the Bible to suggest that this Rich Young Ruler would have heard this but just two chapters later and I didn't do the math to find out how much time had pass but in Mark chapter 10 after Jesus has already said what is there what profit is it to a man who gains the world and loses his soul and then the Rich Young Ruler shows up asking the question what can I do to inherit eternal life that that my soul would not be lost and damned to a a permanent death in all eternity Lord what can I do and he's saying you've got to lose your life for my sake and for the gospels let him deny himself and take up his cross this self-denial is what taking up the cross means in order for a man to take up his cross that means he's denying himself certain things he he is humbling himself and submitting himself to something self-denial it's the denial of of of meure is the denial of opportunity for the sake of Christ it could be sad that it's to do God's will regardless of the cost and to deny your own will regardless of what could be gained it would be two do God's will regardless of what it would cost and deny yourself pleasure regardless of the benefit regardless of the gain oh if I do this I stand to gain this but I'm going to deny myself that but I'm als going to submit myself to the will of God there's there is not there's no glory if I could say it this way and maybe my my my mouth is maybe getting ahead of me a little bit but there's no glory in self-denial denying yourself pleasure unless you're doing God's will so again there's this pretense of the Pharisee that if there's some sort of restriction and there's some sort of saying no and there there's some H uh I'm gonna punish myself I'm make a I'm going to do Penance that there's some glory in that but it's we must do God's will regardless of the cost and deny ourselves regardless of what we stood to gain turn away from the self-serving self-preserving behavior and live outwardly live for others so you could not adopt a lifestyle to join a monastery and be a monk and I'm never going to speak again I'm just going to rake a garden a a and I'm going to live this life of solitude to myself and that's for no one's benefit but your own well maybe it depends on how much you talk at home but the idea is you cannot you cannot be unselfish by merely denying yourself Pleasures you must also live for others you must live outwardly in Mark chap excuse me Matthew chapter 11: 28 29 and 30 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest I'm sharing this in light of his prescription to take up the cross his cross of self-denial denying self this is what he told Devas to do take up the cross and follow me and as a ruler what as one with responsibilities and one who was doing things and had great possessions we could maybe surmise that he was a man of opportunity because his he received it or inherited it but yet being young and and the scripture implies that he would have been maybe between uh 20 and 40 years old and uh I'd like to say maybe 20 and 50 so I could still be young but there's this idea that he's worked hard for this he has some sort of sense of entitlement or a right to these things and the taking up of the Cross and self-denial notice Jesus says come unto me that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest that labor is those that are uh growing weary they're tired they're exhausted there's this heaviness heavy laden it's overburdened and overloaded and I would I would posit that this would perhaps be things that we take upon ourselves or take ownership of that bring us down instead of giving us a sense of meaning or purpose because it's not a question of just being unburdened but it's a question of being appropriately burdened because he says take my yoke upon you those of you who are yolked and overtaxed with your yoke get rid of that yoke and take on a new one he's not saying become yokeless he's saying that yeah you're you're going to always have Labor you're going to have travail but take my yoke and learn of me there's the phrasing learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart that that meekness that loneliness it's this re Rel this is where you're going to find relief from The Strife of the Yoke this is where you're going to find relief from this overwhelming burden is not to become burden less but to have the right kind of Burden take my yoke upon you and lur to me for I'm meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light the yoke is a symbol of service he says take my yoke upon you it's he saying You must be in service you must labor but the Yoke of this world the Yoke of leod DEA the Yoke of greed the Yoke of money the Yoke of possessions the Yoke of of these things that's just going to cause you to be labored and exhausted and tired and overloaded and you're yolked to the wrong things you're driven but driven to do the wrong things you're you're doing and you're working but because you have the wrong yoke you're not receiving the benefit the riches of or the blessings of God are riches and he adds no sorrow to it th in this life we will labor in this life we will work in this life we will have to fight for every inch of ground but if we have the right yoke it isn't the negative impact that the Yoke of this world is is so this yoke take my yoke upon you and you shall find rest unto your souls when he offers us this yoke it's still service it's still work but it's an alternative labor to selfish ambition maybe we could even say that those that labor and are heavy laden haven't yet been yolked they're doing it all on their own they're working they're working for themselves so he offers a yoke that you might be joined to another's task that you might be a servant to him him he's meek and lowly in heart so we submit ourselves to his yoke we're going to learn of him and this is an alternative service and labor to selfish ambition as self-promotion and the commercialism that has our nose to the grindstone and our souls are troubled when we're merely laboring to be rich I if you're working for the paycheck if you're if you're laboring uh for the Optics if there's a lot of things you're doing because you want to do it for yourself and for self-promo and for your own good and even your progy benefit alone and not laboring for the Lord that's when your soul is troubled because he says take my yoke learn of me and you'll find rest remember the scribes and Pharisees prescribed burdens upon the people for pretense and for vanity these burdens therefore were empty but they were the heaviest that when he asks us to take his yoke upon us it's not that it's weightless it is a burden but it's easy and light whereas the Yoke of this world it may be weightless but it's the heaviest of all things without the accountability with the the with the pie in the sky otions that I want to get rich or di Trion with all the different things that we might find ourselves enamored with the scribes and Pharisees prescrib burdens and that Pharisee religion and that way of living that Pharisee hypocritical way of living it's vain but it's the heaviest burden of them all and in Matthew chap 23 verses 10 to1 13 He says neither be you called Masters for one is your master even Christ I've gotten so far away from the first part in this where we dealt a lot with the Pharisees and I hope that some of these scriptures don't get lost we're wanting to use uh Luke 12 and again revisit Matthew chapter 6 and some of these things where he's de ing specifically with the Pharisee attitude and this is what the character of Divas is Divas is that Pharisee religion that Pharisee idea don't be called Master for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant that phrase to me uh stands on its own and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased do not read that statement independent of the prior statement he that is greatest among you shall be your servant so there is the the servant but the one who exalts himself is the one who chooses not to serve the one exalts himself is the one who wants to be served so that's what he means by exalting he says learn of me I'm meek and lowly in heart come follow me and do as I would do and take my yoke upon you we have to become servants willing to to serve and whosoever will exalt himself it doesn't mean that you have to go around lording yourself over other people but choose not to serve those are the ones that are based but he that shall humble himself shall be exalted and this humility should not be viewed independent of the prior statement the one who humbles himself is the one who desires to be and becomes the servant so then he says but wo unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in they put burdens upon people and and and they require things of people that they're not even able to do to enter the kingdom of God but they themselves aren't even willing to do the very things that they're requiring of the people he calls them Hypocrites the laboring for self- pretense the laboring to to serve self the the the the heavy laden overtax to preserve yourselves to serve yourselves he says he that is greatest among you let him serve others there is zero satisfaction for Christian who live selfishly all everything you gain everything you do will always leave you uh less than satisfied we could get a lot of amens on that and and we've experienced that where it seems like man no matter what I do to get ahead no matter what I seem to accomplish no matter all the blessings I find myself counting in my life that have has to do is connected with some effort on my part or resources or possessions or Vacations or cars or money or opportunities whatever it might be there's always there's always going to be some dissatisfaction in the heart of a Christian when he has done it selfishly so Christ says follow me learn of me in other words take my example I I'm I have afforded you example learn of me is we must take Christ as our example as to how to live G 6:2 he says bear ye one another's burdens be sympathetic consider what somebody else may be going through look at it from their standpoint or their objective their perspective bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christian love fulfill the law of Christ that's quite a statement bear ye one another's burdens and in so doing you will fulfill the law of Christ if there's one law if there's a law of Christ it's fulfilled in bearing one another's burdens what what is being pointed to In This Bear ye one another's burdens it does not necessarily mean that you would every time you see someone with a burden you just try to take it away from them because each one of us are to Bear our own burden so there's a certain thought of our attitude towards others when they're bearing what they ought to Bear where sometimes we shame them we ridicule them we reproach them when they're bearing the burden that they ought to bear and he says bear ye one another's burdens don't be so judg Jud y don't be so critical don't be so quick to condemn but to but put yourself in their shoes be sympathetic be considerate this consideration kindness generosity these are a lot of things I've been thinking about just be nice bear ye one another's burdens and in so doing you will fulfill the law of Christ the law of Christ the Yoke of Christ the burden of Christ come follow me learn of me it says in Philippians chapter 2: 3 to8 let nothing be done through Strife or V Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves when he said take my yoke and learn of me I am meek and lowly in heart now we're being instructed that we likewise are to do the same let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory that's self- serving self-protecting but in loneliness of mind what is this to be meek and lowly esteem the other better than yourself look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others this is looking outwardly looking Beyond yourself if you could recall that I am specifically addressing home life in this ourselves as a home for Christ our our houses as homes for a family this church so it's an attitude that finds application in your individual living and your interactions with others it finds application within our home life in our relationships to spouses and children and it finds application in the way that we live amongst one another all for the purpose of the impact that we would have on the community at large look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant I am meek and lowly in heart come learn of me take my yoke and and my burden and he that is greatest among you will be a servant here how he demonstrated this he says he took upon the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross by God's grace none of us are being called to literal death of crucifixion upon a cross but we are all to take up the cross take up your cross follow him and we are to have the same mind that was in Christ that we will humble ourselves and become obedient to the death of the cross the death of self self-denial a cross that we likewise must bear Christ humbled himself he uses the example of Christ to encourage Us in the liness of mind the looking on the things of others he's asking us to have some humility and in order to have humility it's not it's not necessarily to be able solely to appreciate what somebody else is going through but to have a a low opinion of yourself at the same time a modest view of your own importance a modest view of your own worth it's the opposite of being a narcissist which I could remember the series I was preaching where I wanted my title to be don't be a narcissist CU that attitude is so vasive anymore to where really it seems like to be a narcissist just means you breathe just becomes so natural we're all humans we're all uh teenagers are are all narcissists babies are narcissist and we just if we don't ever grow up we're just narcissist but to be able to have this mindset there we have this need to have a modest opinion of ourselves because we could be oh I pity that fool oh I feel sorry for that guy and we see everybody's needs and just how pitiful they are I'm I'm I'm sympathetic to them and oh they're ignorant oh they don't know this but really you're you're probably being proud if you are overestimating your own worth and ability that guy's a clown he doesn't know how to do this and that guy doesn't know how to do that and and you're like oh I feel sorry for him I feel feel sorry for him but do you have an inflated view of yourself when we're humble I think this is one thing I I want to find the right way to express this the the the idea that just kept coming to me is you're willing to take take the medicine yourself words you don't have this the answer for everybody else or you just want to tell everybody else what to do or you're not looking at the needs of others and be like oh this is that problem that problem that problem and you want to be the problem solver but you yourself are willing to take the medicine and afford the right example that you're willing when you have a modest opinion of yourself you recognize your own needs will address those needs within yourself the way that I the way that it kept coming back to me is this idea of whenever there's a disagreement between two parties and especially in relationships whether it be a parent to child or among spouses or even just family members a lot of times we don't feel that we're understood and we think if they could just see it from my perspective and if they could just put themselves in my shoes then everything would just resolve itself and as soon as you say that remind yourself that the power is in your hands to do that for them and that would be the humility they they're just judging me they don't understand where I'm coming from this that and the other and you think if they could just understand where I'm coming from and put themselves in my shoes it would diffuse and if you have that thought the chances are you're right the power to diffuse and deescalate is in your hands if you just put yourself in their shoes and take the medicine that you're trying to get them to take that's what it means to be humble that's really what makes a humble home is when we're not just shoving the me medicine in front of someone else his face but we're taking it ourselves I was going to go on a a rabbit Trail about pandemics but I won't do that or maybe I will a lot of times we're asked to do things it's not solely for your own benefit but solely for the benefit of others and as Christians we should be willing to do it even be willing to forsake some of our liberties take up a cross and do it for others sakes to be humble it says that he being in the form of God made himself of no reputation took on the form of a servant he humbled himself though there was a right he had no sense of entitlement Christ whether we look at Paul whether we look at Christ regardless of how we look at this whether it be through the other scriptures there is this encouragement to have the attitude of Christ the Cross of Christ the the the Yoke of Christ the burden of Christ to learn of him to take up the cross is the sense of sacrifice not that you're just killing yourself but you're doing it for someone else's benefit it's an attitude of deferring it's an attitude of respect or fairness one of the things I I keep thinking about a lot is just this idea of being kind and generous it's just just given due consideration there it it's the some of the scriptures I had to share is do unto others as you would have them doing to you Paul even saying that Jesus said it's better to give than to receive and and it's a sense of deferring that what the behavior that you would expect and to where um you would you if you would want to be treated a certain way treat others that way Romans 12:10 says be kindly affectioned one to another with Brotherly Love be genuinely devoted to others it's a genuine be genuinely devoted to each other be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love this is this it's authentic in honor preferring one another give preference first to others give others more honor than you would yourself I think I've told this story before but I'm reminded of how two children were told that the cake was ready and the the slices of cake were made available by the mom so that they go running into the house and uh the older one got there first and there was two slices of cake and one was bigger than the other so he grabbed the bigger one and the younger one showed up and said well if I would have got here first I would have given you the bigger one and so the older brother said well then you got what you wanted anyways what are you complaining about it it worked out you know I just cut out some steps and and there was this in that would be the idea the little ones thinking well I would have given you the big piece if I got here first because I want you to give me the big piece the idea if a brother had you know two of something and I didn't have any would you give me and it's like oh brother you know I've got two of those right as long as you don't have it you're willing to say yeah I you know whatever you want if I had if I had two Teslas I'd give you one right well brother Aaron if you had two Mont blancs I think brother Jim pingston did that on me one time brother brother Aaron if you had two Mont blancs would you would give me one well brother you know I've got two mbls what are you asking for but it touches on the idea of are you genuinely concerned about other people will you prefer them and say well this is they well they they should have given it to me so I just took it but an honor preferring one another you actually prefer someone above yourself in 2 Corinthians 5:15 I need to hurry here says and he that died died for all that they which live should not live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again come follow me do as I do live as I lived to live for me as he says that we would live unto him to live like him or to live for him is to live selflessly is to deny self because he that which which lives should not live for themselves we should not live for ourselves brother brandham said a person who lives their life for themselves lives a selfish life we must live for others I'll I'll say this because if we need to stop this would make a good stopping point but a humble home is a home that lives for others lives for others within the home a home a home is a family that lives for each other not this Collective notion that if we could just get our act together and and go do some charitable causes externally and optically it'll make us look good because a lot of people do that for pretense uh they they'll make visitations and they'll do things for the show but in the home they're selfish in the home they're abusive in the home they do things that do not promote honesty and and self-service it's all for the wrong reasons a humble home is a family that lives for each other within it do you I I say this and I hope all my children are listening do you know the problems that would be solved within a family with teenagers if they just preferred one another could you imagine it think about it what would it be like if in a family it was always looking out after the other person no you go ahead no you go ahead no you go ahead and they just could all join hands and Michael row your boat a short like it would just be beautiful the idea that in the beginning of the Christian church that they sold what they had what what's at the core is there was this losing this sense of entitlement and this connection to Earthly possessions and Thinking Beyond themselves of how it could benefit the whole and how one could live for the other and so it wasn't that they automatically just shed everything they owned and became destitute and worthless but they began to get lean in the things they didn't need and use that excess for the benefit of others whether it ultimately if you would agree that It ultimately meant they had sold everything and had all things in common or you realize that those that had this much and those that didn't have this much there was an exchange where they all had in common no one was greater and more preferred than the other no one had more opportunities or advantage over the other because of uh ethnicity or because of background or social economic status there was this idea that what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine and we can all work together for the benefit of the whole and for the Improvement en Rich enrichment of individuals and a humble home is a home where it's a giving household a home that gives to one another and because we give instinctively to one another within the home and I'm willing to look after my sibling and I'm wor willing to look after my spouse and I can live unselfishly in my home then I am not going to be the narcissist outside the home you wonder sometimes why is it that the the the family members can't get along but they can get along with everybody else it's because in the home they know they can treat their brother however they want and you know what he still has to sleep in the same house they're going to wake up the next morning and Mom's going to make him talk to me he's going to make me get along with them we're going to have to do puzzles together whatever it is you realize I don't have to be nice to him we're forced to be together but then when I go to school and I go to church if I'm not nice to these people they won't want to be around me so I got to be nice to them it's how it works it's the psychology of it but a person who lives for themselves lives a selfish life in a similar vein Paul says in Romans 14 for none of us liveth to himself in other words none of us ought to live selfishly none of us ought to live solely for ourselves because we are the Lords that's how he concludes this we are the Lords and therefore being the Lords we should live unto him live like him him live for him we cannot live for him we cannot claim to have eternal life and live selfishly one who lives a selfish life lives a life to themselves he says we must must live for each other none of us should live solely for ourselves brother Bram says I know that he holds all the future and whatever mine shall be it's in his hands so each day I want to live not for myself if I live for myself I live a selfish life I want to live for others give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that will build the kingdom of God I remind you of that statement because it touches on such an important principle each day I want to live not for myself I don't want to live selfishly I don't want to use the strength I have for myself or for my own pleasure but I want to use my opportunities I want to use resources I want to use time I want to use love I want to use attention I want to use whatever I have for the benefit of others that will build the kingdom of God I believe I said it in my prayer last Sunday and I'll say it here based upon the statement that we cannot if if we have if we have excess in our lives we cannot erase the debt we have to the world if we've been exchanging things for our soul if we've been engaging in those transactions that mortgage our home or selling off the peace and Tranquility that we ought to have on our homes we cannot erase that debt to the world we cannot uh balance out that's maybe the word I'm looking for we cannot balance The Ledger and make our house a home just simply by subtracting worldly things Jesus did not ask Devas to sell all he had to get lean Pack Light he said give it to the poor we cannot think that we can uh uh in this instance have addition by subtraction alone that if I could just get rid of the wrong things everything will be in balance it's more of a matter of filling your life up with the right things there I'm just I'm just I meant to ask you to do this in the beginning uh just to continue to pray for God's Direction and leadership as we continue in this vein I'm studying some other things and finding inspiration in some other areas but I just feel a burden to stay in this subject on the house of the Lord and there's a certain there's a phrase that I has been coming back to me the last while on there are no empty houses is if you empty it out of the bad things it it creates a vacuum that is soon filled and and so the goal is not just to shed and subtract the goal is not just to try to balance out The Ledger by getting rid of things we must invest in the kingdom of God by living selflessly we must make the right kind of Investments we must we must find that we are doing more not doing less because there is this idea of through legalism and through restri rtion and through abstaining that we're somehow filling our lives up no you're emptying yourself out and it's better to fill up to push out than it is just to try to empty out and fill it up again right just begin to fill yourself up with investments in the kingdom of God serving is greater than subtracting serving is adding as you serve you're not going to find time for selfish Endeavors as you find the right things to do that would benefit others you're not going to find time for self-pleasure I want to live for others so it's not this Catholic idea or a legalistic idea of I'm going to just bind myself and limit myself and restrain myself that's not going that's not going to fulfill the desire you have in your heart that's not going to bring the satisfaction that you want you're going to have to find ways to channel the strength and energy to the right things not just bind ourselves away from the wrong things amen and Jesus says in Luke chapter 12 seek not what you shall eat and what you'll drink and don't be of a doubtful mind trust the Lord trust God for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that you have need of these things this is in Matthew chapter 6 as well but rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you how is it that we build the kingdom of God living for the benefit of others it's it's not even selfishly wanting to promote and build the kingdom of God it really is amazing just how Christianity has been turned so cultish with Cults of personalities and a and things that are all the ideas of self-preserving and and these Notions of protecting ourselves and protecting truths and protecting ideals and when really it's an idea of living for others I can't get away from it there's so much that could be preached on the idea of living for others and it certainly would be repetitive for some of the themes we've already visited as a church but this is the whole idea behind the scripture I I am seeking first the kingdom of God that's not even self-promotion it's not necessar promoting Christianity but it's being Christ to others who are in need fear not little flock for it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom you don't have to be selfish you don't have to be self-preserving sell that you have and give arms provide yourselves bags which whack not old in other words be giving be generous don't just hoard your wealth don't be scraping and pinching and doing everything you can to preserve yourself he's saying do what you can for the benefit of others live for others serve others serve the kingdom of God sell all you have so we say oh that's what he tells the rich man to do but it's like he tells the disciples to do sell all you have give alms in doing so provide yourselves bags which wax not old in other words put your money in a bag and that you intend to use a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief thief approacheth neither moth corruptive for where your treasure is there will your heart be also what are you generous to yourself who are you kind to what are you worried about what are you what are you protecting what are you serving are you is it self-devotion self-promotion self- protection or can you trust God and not be of a doubtful mind be happy with whatever things you have or if you have if you're rich in certain things just be ready to distribute communicate be rich in good works for where your treasure is there will your heart be also sell all that you have and give alms provide yourself bags which wax not old and you will shall have treasure in heaven it's exactly what he says to the Rich Young Ruler that's what he asked us to do Jesus said the greatest among you shall be your servant brother BR said all truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by God when they have not used their wealth right but look into history and you'll find that the truly great were those those who served others Jesus in Matthew 6: 16- 21 again calls out the Hypocrites who when they're fasting they make sure everybody knows they disfigure their faces they appear sad they they want them to know that oh I'm fasting but he says when you fast don't do it for show don't do it for pretense that you would not appear and Dem men that you were fasting and your father which is in secret will reward you openly it says in verse 19 lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your Treasures there will your heart be also how do we do that by serving others how do we do that by not being Hypocrites by not doing it for pretense or self-promotion by seeking first the kingdom of God we sell all we have and give alms provide bags which wax not old and you shall lay up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth this Matthew 6 21 19 to 21 matches with Luke 12 31-34 and right in the heart of it Luke is live beyond yourself live for others that's what a humble home would do I I think of the the concept and notion of an only child and I feel that no matter how big families are anymore every child is an only child it's just the nature of the age there there's this idea that whether you be the firstborn the middle born or the last born that you're the only child and everyone else is just interloping on your domain and that everything should exist to please you and we're laughing because we're thinking about our kids and I'm talking about us adults we're talking about Humanity we're talking about the way that we act I'm trying to close this out just have a few more things here appreciate your attentiveness brother brand when he's preaching the bru serpent that the revelation of Jesus Christ series that he preached in 61 this is Revelation chapter 5 part one he says he's speaking of a conversation he had with Dr Sam madir and brother Bram says the greatest thr I have is living for others and he said that's what makes life real is when you're not what you can do for or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others believe brother bamman saying this and quoting Dr Sam madir that he's saying that this this is true the greatest thrill I have is living for others that's what brother bradam said and then Dr Adair says that's what makes life real that's what makes it real he said that's and brother Bram joins to it says that's when you're really living if there happens to be someone Among Us who's never done that tried to live for somebody else give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life now let's all take the medicine and in order for there to be a humble home it doesn't start with one it doesn't start with one person demanding that everyone else humble themselves but all we have to do is the domino effect of saying well I'll humble myself I'll humble myself I'll take the medicine I will do my best to live for others and he says watch just how much more you're going to get out of life I this is applicable from the youngest to the oldest in our households as individuals whether it's interactions at school or on the job for us as a family for us as a church and if you'll find that it's more blessed than riches or anything that can be thought of is when you can do for someone else to make life's burdens he says which life in itself is a burden and it'll make it a little lighter for someone else when you act in a way just to make someone else's burden a little bit lighter there's this notion and idea sometimes where it's like oh it's their burden it's going to take so much to relieve them of the burden it's going to take so much to fix their problem well maybe you don't need to fix their problem maybe you just need to make it a little bit lighter we're not asked to solve all the problems you don't have to take the whole thing there's a lot of things I was uh reading something one time on just how broke the Health Care system is and everyone said and there was and and so there's this we look at the problems of the Health Care system and and how commercialized it's become and all the difficulties and problems and we think well how are we ever going to turn a a billions of dollar industry how are we going to change the way this thing has gone over the last many decades but you know there's some really really small changes that could be made that incrementally they'll make a difference in small little pieces and and over time if you just Implement certain things and make small changes over time you gain momentum and it may you may not fix the whole problem but it's enough to make a difference for a lot of people and sometimes we look at a problem whether it be in relationships or in a home or some sort of situation and like man the whole thing we're never going to be able to fix the whole thing the whole thing can never be changed it can never be overrun or overturned what about just small changes that can be made starting with yourself what's in your power what's in your hand they could have never fed the thousands of people that gathered on the hillside that day if they just said well we can't afford this but start with what you have Five Loaves and two fish start with that let's see how far it gets us there's some that suggest that in the telling in uh The Book of Mark I believe it is that Jesus prays and blesses the fish and bread and I believe that the scripture I believe it was a supernatural miracle that takes place but for whatever reason that it's silent in Mark maybe leaves to us this thought that if one person is willing to give Five Loaves and two fish to the 5,000 that it could have caused others to say well I'll share mine too and I'll share mine too and before you know it everyone shares and there was enough there for leftovers because one was willing to live for the other and someone else took the queue and live for another I remember when I was in High School I think I was a sophomore at the time all my friends were seniors so I was orphaned after that after they all graduated uh they called themselves the Duds I wore a San Diego Padre hat and it um and it had SD on it and so they called me super dud or sophomore dud it just depended on whether or not they were liking me at the time I guess but I didn't have a job I was you know just they're all graduating or last there last day of school I don't know why I'm telling this story last day of school and all went to Taco Bell I didn't have any money I mean I'm just they I show up they're all eating they're all they're all they're all from wealthy they really weren't Duds I was the dud and and I remember I didn't have any money so they're like hey just wait at the end of the line we'll all give you our change and then you could buy something so they all went through and in order for me to have change you know they only got a couple tacos they all got Waters and small drinks so then when by the time I got all the change I ordered I had like a large drink I had several tacos I eat better than all of them they're like what you got a drink we all got water so you could eat there was act there was leftovers it was a miracle was my point but that's what we can have if we all give if we all shared if we all had a mindset where I'm I'm not just going to look out after myself I'm not just going to preserve for myself but if I can live for somebody else it's much more rewarding much more uplifting and we can start with ourselves I want to make my the burden lighter he says you don't know the joy unless you've tried it once to do something for someone else not necessarily eradicate the whole burden but be burdened for them in their burden make it just a little bit lighter amen God bless you let's just stand together
