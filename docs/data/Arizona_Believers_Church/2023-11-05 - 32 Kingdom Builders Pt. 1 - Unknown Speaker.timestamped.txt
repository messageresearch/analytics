[0:00] I love reading those scriptures on the
[0:02] Millennium it's a subject that uh in
[0:05] times past when I'd get to
[0:06] fellowshipping on it I remember one time
[0:07] I was with uh brother Jim Pinkston in
[0:09] his home and we got to fellowshipping on
[0:11] the
[0:12] Millennium uh brother Lucas you probably
[0:15] weren't too far away maybe within some
[0:17] vicinity of there but we were
[0:18] fellowshipping on the Millennium and it
[0:21] just got so exciting that I felt like I
[0:23] just wanted to run out of the house and
[0:25] start just doing laps uh in his yard
[0:27] because it's a really exciting thing to
[0:29] think about because whatever it's going
[0:30] to be you don't have to worry about
[0:31] missing it if you're God's elect and I
[0:34] know there's a lot of things that are a
[0:35] little bit mysterious and uh hard to
[0:37] figure out even if you take all the
[0:39] quotes that brother brandham said about
[0:40] and all the scriptures sometimes it's
[0:42] really hard just to nail down real
[0:44] precisely what it's going to be but we
[0:46] knew that we do know it's going to be
[0:48] and that rest is going to be glorious
[0:50] and there's so much that's represented
[0:51] in that Kingdom we were drawn a lot from
[0:54] that on Wednesday night today though I
[0:56] want to take the subject of Kingdom
[0:57] Builders and that would be my title
[0:59] today today as Kingdom Builders I I feel
[1:01] I have one more part in this so we'll
[1:03] just call this part one and maybe next
[1:05] Sunday if the Lord would lead we might
[1:06] be able to just wrap up this series
[1:08] we've been doing on the kingdom but I
[1:09] want to take this uh title of Kingdom
[1:12] Builders and when I say that I know that
[1:13] we might initially think about a lot of
[1:16] different things I know for me I've had
[1:18] kind of the the phrase the vernacular of
[1:21] different individuals who like to lift
[1:23] themselves up they're building their own
[1:25] kingdoms and so I don't mind if you
[1:27] think about that in the sense of uh the
[1:29] negative side of Kingdom building but
[1:30] we're not going to take it that
[1:32] direction in Isaiah 11:9 we've been
[1:35] drawing from this extensively they shall
[1:37] not hurt nor destroy and all my Holy
[1:39] Mountain for the Earth shall be full of
[1:41] the knowledge of the Lord as the waters
[1:43] cover the sea I believe this scripture
[1:46] is important to understand just exactly
[1:48] how uh these verses 6 seven and 8 unfold
[1:51] and how that we see the wicked even
[1:53] being slain and a righteousness reigning
[1:56] on the earth it's because the Earth is
[1:58] full of God's judgment it's full of his
[2:00] opinion and his discernment there's the
[2:02] correct understanding of things that
[2:04] holds sway that is is dominating if I
[2:08] could say it's the character of God
[2:09] that's going to have preeminence in the
[2:11] world during that time and there'll be
[2:13] an intimate understanding of God's will
[2:15] there's going to be a a submission to
[2:17] his word and that's why everything's at
[2:19] rest just as brother brandham brought
[2:21] forth the Garden of Eden everything was
[2:23] bringing forth of its kind and it had to
[2:25] because it was God's word and each seed
[2:26] bringing forth and that was what we call
[2:29] a millennial condition and we know we
[2:31] use that phrase to refer to A Thousand
[2:32] Years but this is what began in the
[2:35] garden this condition this rest this
[2:37] glory and so under the reign of the king
[2:40] of righteousness as we read it in those
[2:42] first few verses uh all Natures
[2:45] changed where there's enity and where
[2:47] there's animosity and where there were
[2:49] certain animalistic instincts those
[2:50] things are gone and peace is ruling and
[2:53] reigning and I will TR I want to pick up
[2:56] very quickly where we were I believe
[2:58] last Sunday to say this is the power of
[3:01] the spirit that the Bible says in verse
[3:04] two there Isaiah 11: 2 and3 and the
[3:07] spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him
[3:10] so this is the power of the spirit this
[3:11] is the spirit that brings this
[3:13] Perfection that brings this condition
[3:16] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest
[3:17] upon him the spirit of wisdom and
[3:20] understanding the spirit of counsel and
[3:22] might the spirit of knowledge and of the
[3:25] fear of the Lord this is where we want
[3:27] to zero in on the true nature of the
[3:30] spirit of God and the the the character
[3:34] and the influence of the spirit that if
[3:36] the spirit is influencing something and
[3:38] the spirit is on something it's going to
[3:40] have certain characteristics that it
[3:42] manifest and so we're looking at the
[3:44] true character of the influence of the
[3:47] spirit of the Lord and as we said before
[3:49] not just a
[3:50] baptism not just a a a a spirit that can
[3:53] move in a meeting and the spirit can
[3:55] move in the meeting and it can manifest
[3:57] itself in a lot of ways that we know can
[3:59] be
[4:00] impersonated genuine move of God can
[4:02] cause a lot of a lot of manifestations
[4:05] it's genuine Spirit uh genuine Spirit
[4:08] even on false seed can produce genuine
[4:10] manifestations of the spirit but even
[4:12] those manifestations can be impersonated
[4:15] so what we're talking about here when it
[4:17] says the spirit of the Lord shall rest
[4:19] upon him it's showing kind of that
[4:21] immutable evidence of the spirit of the
[4:23] Lord and it saying the spirit of wisdom
[4:26] and understanding the spirit of counsel
[4:28] and might the spirit of knowledge and
[4:29] the fear of the Lord those are things
[4:31] that indicate not just a move of the
[4:34] spirit or a manifestation of the spirit
[4:36] but a real indwelling of the Holy
[4:39] Ghost and as the Bible says in Zechariah
[4:42] not by might not by power so it's not
[4:44] it's not the carnal listic things and
[4:46] efforts and discipline it says but by my
[4:48] spirit sayith the Lord of hosts and
[4:50] there's a way that his Spirit Works
[4:52] verse three and shall make him of quick
[4:54] understanding in the fear of the Lord
[4:58] this is notice those words the spirit of
[5:00] the Lord manifest in the spirit of
[5:01] wisdom and understanding counsel and
[5:03] might knowledge and fear of the Lord and
[5:04] shall make him of quick understanding in
[5:06] the fear of the Lord he shall not judge
[5:08] after the side of his eyes neither
[5:10] reprove after the hearing of his
[5:14] ears that clearly speaks to
[5:17] discernment looking past the surface
[5:20] being able to see beyond certain markers
[5:23] and characteristics that we're kind of
[5:24] trying to read the tea leaves we're
[5:26] trying to read the red flags we're
[5:27] trying to figure things out on an
[5:28] external level he can look past the
[5:31] outward and he can see the inward
[5:32] because that's what the spirit does it
[5:34] searches all things yay the Deep things
[5:36] of
[5:37] God now that's review I think for all of
[5:40] us there and just a little bit more
[5:42] review I'm trying to parallel what I've
[5:44] been doing at least over the last
[5:46] several services but there's been a lot
[5:47] of just building through this parallel
[5:50] our future
[5:51] home with our current condition or
[5:54] position in Christ certain things we can
[5:56] look at that eth day and see that these
[5:57] things are going to be the Perfection
[5:59] perfect realization but yet there's
[6:01] characteristics and aspects of that that
[6:03] help us to understand our current
[6:05] position in Christ and it's inspired by
[6:07] brother brandham saying if I could just
[6:08] get one thing across to you in future
[6:10] home it's the Plan of Redemption to see
[6:12] the image of redemption in the earth and
[6:14] the image of redemption in the
[6:16] individual and that just builds when you
[6:18] conceive that you realize there's things
[6:20] right now as a Christian who has the
[6:23] holy spirit of God inside of me that are
[6:25] true now that are one day going to be
[6:27] perfectly true for everything right and
[6:29] for the world and so we see that the
[6:31] reign of Christ
[6:33] establishes a his Reign on earth
[6:35] establishes a
[6:36] Thousand-Year reign of peace reign of
[6:39] righteousness where it'll be
[6:41] supremely under his guidance it'll be
[6:45] under his instruction as it says that
[6:47] the by the breath of his mouth he's
[6:49] going to slay the wicked and as he
[6:51] speaks uh he's going to uh going to
[6:54] Smite the Earth with the rod of his
[6:56] mouth with his breath of his lips shall
[6:57] he slay the wicked there's going to be
[6:59] the word which is going to hold sway he
[7:02] under his guidance and his instructions
[7:03] could to be ruled by his discernment
[7:05] thousand years of Peace even to where
[7:07] animal life and everything's getting
[7:09] along and this is what Christ can do in
[7:12] our hearts right now if we let him have
[7:15] preeminence as King this is what Christ
[7:18] can do in our hearts right now now if
[7:20] you could just walk with me very quickly
[7:22] through several scriptures because I'm
[7:25] wanting just to
[7:26] identify this Spirit of the Lord which
[7:29] is the spirit of wisdom and
[7:31] understanding Spirit of counsel and
[7:32] might the spirit of knowledge in the
[7:34] fear of the Lord to make us of quick
[7:36] understanding in the fear of the Lord
[7:37] that we might have discernment and
[7:39] recognize this is a consistent theme in
[7:41] the New Testament Ephesians 3:1 17-
[7:45] 21 he says that Christ May dwell in your
[7:49] hearts by faith now that's the that's
[7:51] the indwelling of Christ this is what
[7:53] he's praying this is the prayer that he
[7:55] has for these believers who are being
[7:56] positionally placed that Christ May
[7:58] dwell in your heart Hearts by faith that
[8:00] ye being rooted and grounded in love may
[8:03] be able to comprehend with All Saints
[8:06] what is the breath and length and depth
[8:08] and height so that's that's the full
[8:10] scope and to know the love of Christ
[8:13] which passeth knowledge that you might
[8:15] be filled with all the fullness of God
[8:18] now unto him we dealt with the fullness
[8:20] so I think these are just again review
[8:21] scriptures now unto him that is able to
[8:23] do exceeding abundantly above all that
[8:26] we ask or think so he's the one that can
[8:29] do
[8:30] above according to the power that
[8:32] worketh in
[8:34] us now sometimes we think oh he can do
[8:37] above what we could even ask or think
[8:39] and so we kind of imagine this working
[8:41] that takes place outside of us but he
[8:43] says I want Christ to dwell on your
[8:45] hearts by faith that he who is able to
[8:48] do exceeding abundantly above all that
[8:50] we ask or think according to the power
[8:53] that works within us so this power and
[8:57] the manifestation above what we can ask
[8:59] or think is according to a power that
[9:01] works in us uh unto him be glory in the
[9:04] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[9:06] ages world without in amen he got so
[9:08] excited he amened what he was writing
[9:11] there's there's a what a beautiful
[9:13] picture that's painted the power that
[9:15] works in us from Christ indwelling in us
[9:19] can do exceeding abundantly above all
[9:21] that we can ask or think so it's beyond
[9:24] ourselves it's beyond our Humanity it's
[9:27] beyond our carnal thinking and this is a
[9:29] consistent theme we could be reading
[9:31] from several more places in Ephesians
[9:33] we've already seen where he's raised us
[9:34] up seated in the Heavenly places in
[9:36] Christ Jesus a lot of those images he
[9:38] says in Ephesians chapter 4 that there's
[9:40] going to be those that he's given gifts
[9:42] unto men uh uh for the work of the
[9:44] ministry for the preaching of the word
[9:46] to speak the truth in love that we might
[9:48] grow up into Christ who is the head in
[9:50] all things till we all come in the unity
[9:52] of the faith he says in verse 13 and of
[9:55] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[9:58] perfect man un the measure of the
[9:59] stature of the fullness of Christ so as
[10:02] Christ dwells in our hearts by faith
[10:04] we're able to
[10:05] comprehend and have this knowledge which
[10:08] passeth knowledge filled with all the
[10:10] fullness of God according to the power
[10:11] that works in us bringing us to the
[10:13] unity of faith that we might comprehend
[10:15] with All Saints so there's a Unity of
[10:17] the faith and the knowledge of the Son
[10:19] of God this is that fullness of God the
[10:22] whole Earth shall be full of the
[10:23] knowledge of God well then I just desire
[10:26] that my mind would be full of the
[10:28] knowledge of God that Spirit would be
[10:30] permeated by the knowledge of God that
[10:32] it wouldn't just be an anchor in my soul
[10:35] and I'm just like well one day it's all
[10:36] going to be over and we'll all be happy
[10:38] and we're going to live well but I want
[10:39] to experience the benefits oh more than
[10:42] ever in my life I want to experience the
[10:44] benefits of that power of God that's on
[10:47] the inside of me Hallelujah the unity of
[10:50] the faith and the knowledge of the Son
[10:51] of God in 2 Corinthians 4:6 he says it
[10:55] this way for God who commanded the light
[10:57] to shine out of Darkness hath shined in
[10:59] our
[11:00] hearts to give the light of the
[11:02] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[11:03] face of Jesus Christ This is why the
[11:05] light shined in your hearts this is why
[11:07] the word uh came to you and it flashed
[11:09] in your soul so that to give the light
[11:12] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[11:14] the face of Jesus Christ the face of
[11:17] Jesus Christ the revealing of Jesus
[11:19] Christ is to give light of the knowledge
[11:20] of the glory of God this is something
[11:22] that is at the heart of our experience
[11:25] as Christians in Philippians 1: 9 and 10
[11:29] he says it this
[11:30] way and this I pray that your love may
[11:33] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[11:37] and in all
[11:39] judgment if we are rooted and grounded
[11:41] in love he would desire this Christ
[11:42] dwells in our hearts by faith that we
[11:44] would uh our love would abound yet more
[11:47] and more in a greater depth of knowledge
[11:49] and a more comprehensive discernment
[11:52] being rooted and grounded in love you're
[11:53] to grow in that love and our love is to
[11:55] be without dissimulation to abord that
[11:58] which is evil cleave to that which is
[11:59] good and so here is this working out of
[12:02] this Holy Ghost experience as it shined
[12:04] in our hearts to give us the light of
[12:06] the knowledge of the glory of God that
[12:07] it might manifest and abound in more
[12:10] knowledge and in all
[12:13] discernment that you may approve the
[12:15] word there in the Greek approve is
[12:16] discern discern things that are
[12:18] excellent that you may be sincere and
[12:20] without offense till the day of
[12:22] Christ to discern is to perceive or to
[12:25] recognize to detect something to to
[12:28] disting or perceive differences if you
[12:30] have discernment you have some keenness
[12:31] of insight we might call it wisdom uh
[12:34] some sort of perception but it's a it's
[12:36] a a insightful judgment which is correct
[12:39] there's a perception of things that are
[12:41] obscure when someone says uh did you
[12:44] discern that
[12:45] sound it implies that maybe it's not uh
[12:48] you can't perceive it readily right can
[12:51] you detect differences can you discern
[12:53] uh what's off did you sense what was
[12:55] wrong there and that so it's not
[12:57] necessarily if you discern something
[12:58] it's something that's not
[13:00] obvious like nobody discerns that I have
[13:03] a big
[13:04] nose it's like well just just the right
[13:07] angle no it's obvious so there's things
[13:09] that are maybe slight and maybe you
[13:11] don't see right off and you take some
[13:12] time just to pick up on it that's what
[13:14] discernment is it's a depth of
[13:18] knowledge it's a is more comprehensive
[13:21] discernment and that he says that you
[13:23] may be sincere and without
[13:25] offense so this is what brings sincerity
[13:27] when brother BR says we must be more
[13:29] sincere and he relates that story in the
[13:30] B and the angel of the Lord said you
[13:32] must be more sincere we said well how
[13:34] how can I get sincere I can't take my
[13:37] shoes off enough I can't humble myself
[13:39] enough I can't lay enough on the ground
[13:41] low enough and so how do I become more
[13:43] sincere here's here's the secret to
[13:46] sincerity it says that that this
[13:48] knowledge of the Lord in all judgment
[13:50] that you may be sincere means to judge
[13:53] right and be judged right having a
[13:56] single eye to the very best things amen
[13:59] you want to be more sincere you need
[14:00] more understanding of the word of God
[14:02] you want to be more sincere you need
[14:03] more knowledge of the word of God that's
[14:05] what it takes to be sincere not a false
[14:07] humility not a bowing ourselves
[14:09] artificially but we need to really know
[14:12] the love of God we really need to know
[14:13] the magnitude of God and trust me with
[14:15] that knowledge will come a humility true
[14:18] knowledge and insight into the nature
[14:20] and character of God and just to know
[14:21] his love for us more and more does what
[14:23] it humbles us more and
[14:26] more it's that knowledge and this
[14:28] discern that brings the sincerity to be
[14:31] sincere is to be examined by the Sun's
[14:33] light and be found pure when examined
[14:36] under scrutiny under the light found
[14:38] pure that we may be sincere in order to
[14:41] be sincere we have to have the knowledge
[14:43] that he's talking about here and all
[14:45] judgment
[14:46] amen sincere and without offense means
[14:50] not striking against or stumbling you
[14:52] can say not led into sin but to be
[14:55] blameless I think the Greek word is
[14:57] smooth
[14:59] right don't we all want to be
[15:02] smooth that it's we be found sincere
[15:05] without offense how is it we can be
[15:07] smoothed
[15:08] out how is it we can be sincere well
[15:11] this is a very pointed uh few scriptures
[15:14] we put together here I think to declare
[15:16] this it's that Christ May dwell in your
[15:18] hearts by faith amen and as we begin to
[15:22] comprehend him as he begins to grow in
[15:25] us and that power that works within us
[15:27] brings us to a Unity of faith faith in
[15:28] the knowledge of the Son of God giving
[15:30] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[15:31] of the Lord will give us a more
[15:32] comprehensive discernment a greater
[15:35] understanding that brings
[15:36] sincerity that brings this without
[15:40] offense if I could phrase it this way
[15:42] knowledge of the word of God I'm talking
[15:44] about true knowledge not book learning
[15:45] but knowledge of the word of God or
[15:47] knowledge by the word of God has the
[15:49] effect of purging amen knowledge by the
[15:52] word of God as Paul is writing it here
[15:54] that we may abound more in knowledge and
[15:56] in all judgment that your love would
[15:58] abound yet more and more in all
[15:59] knowledge and in all judgment it has the
[16:01] effect of cleaning and purifying Psalms
[16:04] 199 says wherewith all shall a young man
[16:06] cleanse his way by taking heed thereto
[16:09] according to Thy Word how do how are we
[16:11] cleansed how are we Pur by the word of
[16:13] God it's the word that does the washing
[16:15] it's the word that does the cleaning
[16:16] it's the word that does the
[16:18] perfecting and so the word of God
[16:20] knowledge by the word of God purges it
[16:23] cleanses it pushes out when I say
[16:26] knowledge by the word of God I want you
[16:27] to think of spiritual understanding
[16:29] Revelation yes Paul says it this way in
[16:32] Galatians
[16:37] 5:16 I brought my tepid tea to the
[16:40] pulpit tonight to this this morning oo
[16:42] tonight
[16:43] Glory this is going to be a good one
[16:46] this morning uh just to keep my my
[16:49] throat going Galatians chapter 5:1 16
[16:53] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[16:56] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[16:59] flesh we've all read it before right
[17:01] we've all read it we've read it walk in
[17:03] the spirit you not fulfill the lust of
[17:04] the flesh how many of us wrestle with
[17:07] it how how many of us try to figure out
[17:10] well I mean what it means is right or we
[17:13] just try to but I think it's an absolute
[17:15] right if you can walk in the spirit it
[17:18] suggests it's
[17:20] impossible for you to act to satisfy the
[17:24] lust of the
[17:25] flesh read it as an absolute walk in the
[17:28] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[17:30] lust of the Flesh and if any time you
[17:32] find yourself satisfying the lust of the
[17:34] flesh correct yourself with these words
[17:37] I must not be in the spirit don't
[17:40] condemn yourself just correct yourself I
[17:42] remember one time I'd been serving the
[17:45] lord maybe not for very long maybe may
[17:47] have been a year and I went away think
[17:49] was after I graduated from college and
[17:51] I'd went away for a few weeks and I came
[17:53] back home and found out that they had
[17:54] had a big garage sale and sold some of
[17:56] my stuff while I was gone sold my
[17:59] trumpet and uh and I said Hey where's my
[18:02] trumpet and my mom said we sold it at
[18:05] the garage sale and so I just said I'm
[18:07] officially In the
[18:10] Flesh I mean at that moment I knew this
[18:13] is I'm not operating according to the
[18:15] spirit I'm officially in My Flesh and
[18:17] that's what we can say to ourselves
[18:18] sometimes we realize I've been nudged a
[18:20] little bit I'm not walking in the spirit
[18:22] but this to me seems to be an absolute
[18:24] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[18:27] fulfill the lust of the
[18:30] how many have ever heard of the sermon
[18:31] how can I
[18:32] overcome and brother bradman's very
[18:34] intro to that is talking about
[18:37] overcoming and he says we should never
[18:39] let the spirit of Revival die this is
[18:42] this is what his subject is I want to
[18:43] speak to you today because I I don't I
[18:46] think that we should never let the
[18:48] spirit of Revival die how can I overcome
[18:51] means how can I keep the spirit of
[18:53] revival going in my life because that's
[18:55] what Revival is yes sir walk in in the
[18:58] spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of
[19:00] a dead flesh you shall not walk after
[19:03] deadly things things that pretend to to
[19:05] destruction and Corruption and brother
[19:08] BR in many different places describes
[19:11] and and I realize now maybe open up the
[19:13] door to a much larger subject that I've
[19:14] been uh studying on so it satisfies me
[19:17] just to say these few things and maybe
[19:19] it'll create a little bit of a thirst
[19:20] for you but brother B says in many
[19:22] different places how a true Revival
[19:24] washes out all
[19:26] unbelief and there might be a lot of
[19:28] movement right there might be a lot of
[19:30] uh uh shaking around and a lot of things
[19:32] taking place but brother Braham says
[19:33] says at the end of the the true Revival
[19:35] surfaces the trash to get rid of it and
[19:39] that would be that would be the mark of
[19:40] a real Revival that'd be the true fruits
[19:42] of a Revival how many times did Brother
[19:45] brandham correct the the the
[19:48] manifestation of the spirit in meetings
[19:50] and church services and people could
[19:52] shout dance and speak with tongues and
[19:55] scream and do all sorts of
[19:56] manifestations it could be a move move
[19:58] and even you can say maybe not even a
[20:00] workup but he would correct their manner
[20:02] of dress their manner of living the how
[20:05] they with cut hair and painted nails and
[20:07] all the other things that he called out
[20:09] and he said this is this is not a
[20:10] Revival unless that
[20:15] changes because the true fruits of
[20:17] Revival washes out
[20:18] unbelief good that's the spirit's moving
[20:21] and spirit's moving it may get may get
[20:23] you excited I have a statement uh that I
[20:26] was going to read
[20:28] and it's maybe a little lengthy but
[20:30] brother BR talks about it I'm just
[20:32] paraphrasing if you want it I can share
[20:33] with you about how if everybody's all
[20:35] excited you're going to get excited too
[20:37] he's he's basically of course yes but
[20:40] what you want is not just that you want
[20:42] it to move and stir in very deep ways so
[20:45] that it's cleaning out the
[20:48] trash and I and I would say this I guess
[20:51] the statement is if it takes eating
[20:52] apples to cause us to recognize causes
[20:55] women to recognize they're naked past
[20:56] the apples and I would say if if it's if
[20:59] it's certain things it takes for us to
[21:01] clean our lives up then I say let's do
[21:02] it but I know no better way to clean our
[21:06] lives up and have a Revival than the
[21:07] word of
[21:09] God Amen walk in the spirit you shall
[21:12] not fulfill the lust of the flesh walk
[21:14] speaks to your manner of Life how you
[21:16] live how you think how you judge he
[21:19] picks it back up in verse 25 and notice
[21:20] what he says if we live in the spirit
[21:22] let us also walk in the
[21:26] spirit if we live
[21:28] in the spirit in other words if you've
[21:31] been quickened by the spirit and again I
[21:33] think you should take this as an
[21:35] absolute to recognize Paul acknowledges
[21:37] if we've been revived by the spirit your
[21:39] Soul's been quickened you've been
[21:41] resurrected from the dead spiritually
[21:43] passed from death into life if you live
[21:45] in the spirit having been made Alive by
[21:47] the new birth then he's saying then walk
[21:50] in the spirit one is a certainty if
[21:53] you've been born again the other is an
[21:54] opportunity of the born again he says if
[21:57] you walk in the spirit spirit I say walk
[21:59] in the spirit and you won't fulfill the
[22:00] lust of the flesh so he says if you've
[22:02] been quickened by the spirit then just
[22:04] live in it or walk in the spirit let us
[22:08] follow his guidance and all of our
[22:10] estimations and all of our words and our
[22:12] temperaments and our actions follow
[22:15] it every minute of every day if possible
[22:19] amen yielding to his Spirit if you've
[22:22] been quickened by it he says walk in
[22:25] it John 14:2 6 this is the nature of the
[22:29] spirit I hope this isn't too much of a
[22:31] step forward in
[22:33] this but he says but the comforter which
[22:36] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[22:39] send in my name he shall teach you all
[22:43] things and bring all things to your
[22:45] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[22:48] you so it's the inside teacher it's the
[22:50] Holy
[22:51] Ghost Holy Ghost is the inside teacher
[22:55] and I emphasize that in the sense that
[22:57] it it doesn't
[22:59] matter well the most important aspect is
[23:04] that you would have the inside teacher
[23:06] so that if the holy spirit is anointing
[23:08] a minister to preach or to teach and to
[23:11] preach the word of God you have the
[23:13] spirit on the inside that's teaching you
[23:16] by that word because no matter how good
[23:19] a preacher is how anointed a preacher
[23:20] can be and no matter how anointed
[23:22] teaching can be and some of the most
[23:25] powerful anointings I've ever
[23:26] experienced in church services with when
[23:28] the teaching of the word was going forth
[23:30] and so it's not just a certain manner in
[23:32] which it's being preached it's the word
[23:33] that brings the
[23:34] anointing and no matter how anointed it
[23:37] could be if you don't have the Holy
[23:39] Ghost you're not going to go any further
[23:41] in the
[23:42] word in a real way in spirit and Truth
[23:46] until you get the inside teacher there's
[23:48] there's that that aspect of the inside
[23:51] teacher the Holy Ghost this is the
[23:52] nature of the Holy Ghost he's going to
[23:53] teach you all
[23:55] things bring all things to your
[23:58] remembrance somebody touch your neighbor
[23:59] and say all
[24:01] things nobody nobody even did it my
[24:04] goodness just say all
[24:08] things he shall teach you all things and
[24:11] bring all things to your remembrance
[24:13] whatsoever I have said unto you this is
[24:16] the spirit of the
[24:17] Lord this is the spirit of wisdom and
[24:20] understanding this is how you're made of
[24:21] quick understanding the fear of the Lord
[24:23] to judge not after your sight but
[24:25] reprove or reprove after the hearing of
[24:26] your ears this is the teacher the holy
[24:29] ghost that comes on the inside who's
[24:31] going to teach you all things and bring
[24:34] all things that you were taught to your
[24:35] remance so he just doesn't want to teach
[24:37] it to you he wants to teach it to you
[24:39] and then reme reminds you of
[24:42] it because notice he teaches you all
[24:44] things first and then he can bring the
[24:45] things that he talk to you back to your
[24:47] remembrance that's
[24:49] right okay you with me yes all right
[24:52] page two Revelations chapter 1 verses 10
[24:56] 11 and 12
[24:58] I'm using this because of some
[25:00] statements that brother brownon
[25:01] makes are just very very
[25:04] orienting uh to some things but it was
[25:06] this aspect as we're looking at the
[25:09] spirit that rest upon the Messiah during
[25:11] the millennial Reign and it's that
[25:14] Messiah that's ruling in your heart
[25:15] right
[25:16] now right that's the one that's in your
[25:19] heart right now so this is the spirit of
[25:22] the Lord this is the spirit of wisdom
[25:23] and understanding in Revelations 1 10
[25:26] verse 10 I was in the Spirit on the
[25:28] Lord's day now notice if I can say this
[25:32] the meaning the purpose and the meaning
[25:35] of being in the spirit I was in the
[25:38] spirit on the Lord's Day the very first
[25:41] thing that John says is and
[25:45] heard he doesn't mention anything else
[25:49] his weeping comes later right the
[25:50] emotions maybe come later I was in the
[25:52] spirit of the Lord's day and heard
[25:54] behind me a great voice as a trumpet
[25:56] saying and who does he hear the voice of
[25:58] Jesus Christ I am Alpha and Omega the
[26:00] first and the last and what thou seest
[26:02] write in a book and send it unto the
[26:04] seven churches which are in Asia under
[26:06] Ephesus and under Smyrna and under
[26:07] pergamus and under thyra and under
[26:09] Sardis and under Philadelphia and under
[26:10] leoda this is what he hears when he's in
[26:14] the spirit on the Lord's day he hears
[26:15] this voice and this is what's happening
[26:18] and then is he still in the spirit on
[26:20] the Lord's day I turned to see so he
[26:24] hears and sees and now not only has he
[26:27] heard the voice but he's turned and he
[26:30] sees the voice that spake with me and
[26:33] being turned I saw seven golden
[26:36] candlesticks I hope that can just kind
[26:38] of wash over you that beautiful picture
[26:40] I was in the spirit of the Lord on the
[26:42] Lord's day and I heard and what I heard
[26:45] caused me to turn and when I turned I
[26:48] saw what I saw is him I saw him and what
[26:52] he was and what he would be this is what
[26:54] it means to be in the spirit of the Lord
[26:56] it means I can hear and hear the voice
[26:59] see Christ and he receives the
[27:01] revelation of Jesus Christ when he was
[27:03] in the spirit of the
[27:05] Lord I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[27:07] day and what does it do he hears it
[27:10] turns him he sees this is what it means
[27:14] to be in the spirit somebody says
[27:16] they're in the spirit and they're not
[27:17] hearing the word of God it's not causing
[27:20] them to turn and they're not seeing
[27:21] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[27:23] and
[27:24] forever I don't know it it may be the
[27:27] spirit but I don't know if you're in the
[27:29] spirit that's good brother Brandon picks
[27:32] picks this up in patas
[27:36] Vision just taking
[27:39] those five words I was in the spirit
[27:41] goes isn't that just beautiful my I love
[27:44] that love I love his formal writing
[27:47] style you could just call those words
[27:49] the whole of the Christian
[27:52] Life let's let's focus on this now if
[27:56] we're going to live live as Christians
[27:58] we have to be in his
[28:01] Spirit John was not talking about being
[28:03] in his own
[28:05] Spirit one it's important for us to
[28:08] understand this right because some
[28:09] people's Spirits everyone's different
[28:12] and you you meet some people and one
[28:14] spouse is really really talkative and
[28:15] the other one's quiet and it's just
[28:17] nature it's their own natures and it's
[28:19] just the way they are and someone's own
[28:21] Spirit can be more exuberant more
[28:23] expressive and more uh more animated
[28:25] someone else can be a little bit more
[28:26] reserved and you could just be showing
[28:28] your own Spirit by the way you handle
[28:31] yourself but here he's saying not John
[28:33] was not in his own spirit that would not
[28:36] have brought these Visions it had to be
[28:39] the spirit of God Amen it has to be the
[28:42] spirit of God with us too or all our
[28:46] efforts are in
[28:47] vain Paul said I will pray in the spirit
[28:50] I will sing in the spirit I will live in
[28:51] the spirit if there's anything good that
[28:54] will come to me it has to be be revealed
[28:58] by the spirit confirmed by the word and
[29:01] made manifest by the results it
[29:03] Bears write it down print it out put it
[29:06] on a bumper sticker make a sticker for
[29:08] your water bottle get a bigger one if it
[29:10] won't fit this is perfect if there's
[29:13] anything good that will come to me it
[29:15] has to be revealed by the spirit
[29:17] confirmed by the word and made manifest
[29:18] by the results it bears as surely as
[29:21] John needed to be in the spirit to
[29:23] receive these tremendous Revelations
[29:24] fresh from Jesus so how what be received
[29:28] what was this Mark in this
[29:29] characteristic he's in the spirit
[29:30] receiving tremendous Revelations we need
[29:33] to be in the spirit to understand the
[29:35] revelations that God has given us to
[29:38] live by in his word for it is the same
[29:41] spirit this is at the real heart of what
[29:44] it means to be in the spirit we need to
[29:46] be in the spirit to understand the
[29:49] revelations that God has given us to
[29:51] live by in his words that's
[29:54] beautifull I say Amen to that this is at
[29:58] the real heart of what it means to
[29:59] overcome and how can I keep the Revival
[30:02] how do I keep the spirit of Revival
[30:03] Never Dying well you need to have a
[30:04] church service every night on you need
[30:07] to get a really good organ player you
[30:08] need a screaming B3 up here and you need
[30:10] everything just get the music just right
[30:12] and we can keep the spir has nothing to
[30:13] do with
[30:15] it that's nothing to do with it we need
[30:18] to be in the spirit to understand the
[30:19] revelations that God has given us to
[30:21] live by in his word for it is the same
[30:24] Spirit don't get me wrong I love a
[30:25] screaming B3
[30:28] I love a good
[30:31] organ so getting out let me I let me
[30:34] just go ahead and continue to read a
[30:35] little bit more brother Bram is and I'm
[30:38] just before we go to Ephesians chapter 1
[30:41] I'll just bring this in right here
[30:43] brother Brown is talking about in this
[30:45] very continuing In this passage he says
[30:47] look at it this way he says people read
[30:49] in Acts
[30:50] 238 uh but they don't they just pass
[30:52] right on so I see it in the word of God
[30:54] they just move right on what do they do
[30:56] it's right there in the word of God but
[30:59] they'll move right on and they'll find
[31:01] the sound bite that they
[31:03] like baptize the name of Father Son and
[31:06] Holy Ghost they just pass right on what
[31:08] they they see one oh no that's that's
[31:10] that does this and that does that and
[31:11] that's then they just start knocking
[31:13] down all these other things in the word
[31:14] of God he says they just pass right on
[31:17] he says if they saw it by getting in the
[31:19] spirit right they would know that they
[31:21] need to repent and be baptized in the
[31:23] name of Jesus Christ he says they never
[31:25] get in his spirit
[31:27] or would happen to them exactly as the
[31:30] word says
[31:31] amen so he says pray for God pray to God
[31:35] for Revelation by his spirit that is the
[31:38] first step get in the spirit so you tell
[31:42] me what it is it mean to get in the
[31:44] spirit getting in the spirit is is to
[31:47] have Revelation by his
[31:49] spirit that is the first step get in the
[31:52] spirit by this Revelation he says don't
[31:54] and he's talking about uh another illust
[31:57] frustration of people trying to be
[31:58] healed and and he says that
[32:01] they they get a they if we did how they
[32:05] ask God to do this and do that suppose
[32:07] you need healing what does the word say
[32:09] well we' we've all read it countless
[32:12] times but did not get in the spirit when
[32:13] reading it did we ask God for a spirit
[32:16] to teach us the real truth of
[32:19] it he says all we
[32:22] need this to get in the spirit and then
[32:25] things will be done amen don't go
[32:27] through the acts first get in the spirit
[32:31] and then go through the acts and watch
[32:33] what God will
[32:34] do yes sir so get in the spirit of it
[32:37] the revelation of it the stimulation of
[32:42] it Ephesians chap 1:
[32:46] 17-23 notice how closely this language
[32:50] tracks Isaiah chapter
[32:53] 11 says that the god of our Lord Jesus
[32:55] Christ the father of Glory may give give
[32:57] unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[32:58] Revelation in the knowledge of him
[33:01] Hallelujah the eyes of your
[33:03] understanding being enlightened that you
[33:05] may know what is the hope of his calling
[33:08] and what the riches of the glory of his
[33:10] inheritance in the
[33:12] Saints and what is the exceeding
[33:14] greatness of his power to us word who
[33:16] believe according to the working of his
[33:18] mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[33:21] when he raised him from the dead and set
[33:23] him at his own right hand in the
[33:25] Heavenly places
[33:27] the
[33:28] spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the
[33:30] knowledge of him is the working of his
[33:32] mighty power
[33:34] amen that we
[33:36] might
[33:38] know the hope of his calling the riches
[33:41] of his glory and what is the exceeding
[33:43] greatness of his power to us word who
[33:45] believe according to the working of his
[33:48] mighty power which he told us it's the
[33:50] power that works in
[33:53] us this is the real power of the Holy
[33:55] Ghost this is is the real manifestation
[33:58] of the spirit Hallelujah that it would
[34:00] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[34:02] Revelation and the knowledge of him and
[34:04] unless you someone tried to confuse my
[34:06] language and twist it it's not it's not
[34:09] just a knowledge that's yeah well I I
[34:11] got it all right here this is a
[34:14] knowledge with power this is a this is
[34:17] when you get in this Spirit you get the
[34:18] Revelation the acts will happen God will
[34:21] perform his word he says you'll know it
[34:24] by by a revelation by his word confirmed
[34:26] by the word and then it'll be made
[34:28] manifest by the results it Bears so
[34:31] don't for a second think that this is
[34:33] not there's not going to be a result of
[34:35] your Revelation that there's not a
[34:36] manifestation of your Revelation but
[34:38] listen Revelation there is no
[34:40] impersonation of Revelation there's just
[34:44] demonstration touch your neighbor and
[34:46] say
[34:49] demonstration that God may give unto you
[34:51] the spirit of wisdom and
[34:53] Revelation because this is the working
[34:55] of his mighty power
[34:57] brother Bram writes in the church age
[34:59] book yes Satan hates re hates
[35:01] Revelation but we love
[35:03] it Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[35:06] with true Revelation in our lives the
[35:08] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[35:12] but we will prevail over them with what
[35:15] Revelation with Revelation you will
[35:18] prevail over all the tactics of the
[35:21] enemy you will prevail over all the
[35:23] gates of the
[35:25] enemy you will recall the I mentioned at
[35:27] the beginning of this message that this
[35:28] book we are studying is the actual
[35:30] revelation of Jesus himself in the
[35:33] church and his work in the future ages
[35:36] amen then I mentioned that it takes the
[35:38] Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we
[35:39] will fail to get it bringing these two
[35:42] thoughts together you will see that it
[35:44] won't take just ordinary study and
[35:45] thinking to make this book real it is
[35:48] going to take the operation of the Holy
[35:52] Ghost that means this book can't be
[35:55] revealed to anyone but a special class
[35:56] of people Revelation takes the operation
[35:59] of the Holy Ghost it'll take one with
[36:02] prophetic Insight it will require the
[36:05] ability to hear from God it'll require
[36:08] Supernatural
[36:10] instruction not just a student comparing
[36:13] verse with verse though that is good but
[36:16] a mystery requires the teaching of the
[36:19] spirit or it never becomes
[36:22] clear a mystery requires the teaching of
[36:25] the spirit or never becomes
[36:29] clear let this sink in this is so
[36:32] important a mystery requires the
[36:34] teaching of the spirit or it never
[36:36] becomes clear how we need to hear from
[36:39] God and lay ourselves open and become
[36:44] yielded to the spirit to hear and
[36:48] know notice how much this would be
[36:50] corrective to the Pentecostalism of his
[36:52] day where the yielding brother I'm
[36:54] talking about just let they talk about
[36:55] oh just let your mind go blank right and
[36:59] there was this yielding to just whatever
[37:01] move just yield yourself
[37:02] now and and maybe if I push on you hard
[37:05] enough you'll yield to the floor and
[37:08] there's a certain yielding to certain
[37:09] manifestations In the Flesh in the
[37:11] physical uh way that we could yield to
[37:13] the spirit and see how much it's going
[37:15] to declare and to shout and dance and
[37:17] how much you're going to cry all that is
[37:19] wonderful we all enjoy a good a good
[37:21] weeping session a a good a good shouting
[37:25] and dancing and how how good that feels
[37:28] but this is where we really need it he
[37:30] says yield to be to the spirit to hear
[37:34] and
[37:36] know as I've already said this book
[37:38] Revelation is the consummation of the
[37:40] scriptures mystery requires the teaching
[37:42] of the spirit or it never becomes clear
[37:44] we need to lay ourselves open and become
[37:46] yielded to the spirit to hear and
[37:52] know this is the consummation of
[37:54] scripture it is even placed exactly
[37:55] right in the Canon of scripture at the
[37:57] end now you can know why it says that
[37:59] Anyone who reads or even hears it is
[38:02] blessed it is the revelation of God that
[38:04] will give you authority over the
[38:07] devil a lot of good Liners in here it is
[38:11] the revelation of God that'll give you
[38:13] authority over the devil and you can see
[38:15] why they would what add or take why they
[38:17] could who would add or take from it
[38:19] would be cursed it would have to be so
[38:22] for who can add or take away from the
[38:24] perfect revelation of God and overcome
[38:26] the enemy good amen on there's your
[38:30] overcoming
[38:32] Revelation it is that simple there is
[38:35] nothing of such prevailing power as the
[38:37] revelation of the
[38:41] word it's a revelation of God that'll
[38:43] give you Authority there's nothing such
[38:44] prevailing power as a revelation of the
[38:46] word
[38:49] wow this is the working of his mighty
[38:52] power in US amen this is the spirit of
[38:55] wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge
[38:56] of him this is their understanding being
[38:59] enlightened see in verse three is a
[39:00] blessing is pronounced on those who give
[39:02] special attention to this book I think
[39:04] this refers to the Old Testament custom
[39:05] of the priest reading to the the word to
[39:07] the congregation in the morning you see
[39:09] many could not read so the priest had to
[39:11] read to
[39:13] them as long as it was the word the
[39:15] blessing was there it didn't matter if
[39:18] it was read or
[39:20] heard that's the power of the word and
[39:23] he says we need to be yielded to the
[39:24] spirit to hear and know
[39:27] I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day
[39:28] caused John to hear to turn to
[39:32] see to see the things unfold in future
[39:35] ages to have an understanding to get
[39:36] this revelation of Jesus Christ that he
[39:38] writes down in the Book of
[39:40] Revelation we see these consistent
[39:42] themes and I know these are things that
[39:44] you've heard many many times but this is
[39:47] the spirit of wisdom and understanding
[39:51] the spirit of counsel and might to cause
[39:53] you to be full of the knowledge of the
[39:56] the
[39:57] Lord in 2 Timothy 3: 1516 and 17 it says
[40:02] and from that and that from a child as
[40:04] he's writing to Timothy brother Bram
[40:07] said as long as it's the word there's a
[40:08] blessing it didn't matter if it was read
[40:10] or heard just talking about how perfect
[40:12] the scriptures are if anyone would add
[40:14] to or take away Paul speaking of the
[40:17] word of God says that from a child that
[40:18] H has known the holy scriptures which
[40:20] are able to make thee wise unto
[40:22] salvation through faith which is in
[40:24] Christ Jesus all scriptures given by the
[40:27] Breath of God by inspiration of God and
[40:30] all scriptures profitable for Doctrine
[40:32] for reproof for correction for
[40:35] instruction and
[40:36] righteousness these are the different
[40:38] varied aspects of the word of God as he
[40:40] says that we need the teaching of the
[40:42] holy spirit that we need the Myster
[40:44] requires to teach of the spirit or it
[40:45] never becomes clear we need the inside
[40:48] teacher we need the word of God to be
[40:50] taught we need the Holy Ghost working on
[40:51] both ends and from a child you've known
[40:54] the scripture he says those scriptures
[40:55] are able to make you wise through faith
[40:57] in Jesus Christ so the very word of God
[40:59] by Revelation can bring wisdom the
[41:02] revelation of the word of God Revelation
[41:04] by the spirit is going to bring wisdom
[41:06] and understanding and knowledge it's
[41:08] good for Doctrine reprove correction
[41:11] instruction and
[41:13] righteousness and then Paul makes this
[41:15] statement that the man of God may be
[41:18] perfect
[41:19] truly furnished Uno all good
[41:24] works walk in the spirit you shall not
[41:26] fulfill the lust of the flesh if we live
[41:28] in the spirit then we should also walk
[41:30] in the spirit what happens when you walk
[41:32] in the spirit you grow in wisdom and
[41:34] understanding your love abounds in more
[41:36] knowledge and comprehensive discernment
[41:37] as that grows it pushes things out it
[41:39] gives you understanding you know what I
[41:41] figured it out I followed the
[41:43] breadcrumbs I when I do this I've
[41:45] learned it's because I did this this
[41:47] this this and this and you're able to
[41:48] use some forensics right do some data
[41:51] analytics on your own life and say I
[41:53] figured out the problem and that's a
[41:55] spirit of wisdom and understanding to
[41:57] know how to approach problems know how
[41:59] to overcome know how to address things
[42:01] in your life oh hallelujah praise be to
[42:04] God who gives us wisdom and
[42:08] understanding that the man of God may be

[42:15] spirit the word of God giving you the
[42:19] revelation of the word being profitable

[45:16] building thly
[45:19] furnished now this is going to start
[45:21] summarizing a lot of things that we
[45:23] focused on earlier in this series and I
[45:25] know it's been 30 something Parts but in
[45:27] habac 2: 12 to 14 woe to him that builth
[45:30] a town with
[45:31] blood establishe a city by
[45:35] iniquity brother John was fat was
[45:38] sharing with me just how much he could
[45:39] see the image of Cain in
[45:41] that and what we can see is an image of
[45:45] mystery Babylon right a town so that
[45:49] wasn't me disagreeing I just said but
[45:51] John was struck by that and I saw
[45:53] incredible similarities how he named a
[45:55] city after his son and he built this
[45:57] watching place it was built by Blood
[45:58] it's built in the fear of blood being
[46:00] shed built by iniquity and that being a
[46:03] seed of even that City that comes in the
[46:05] end called the mystery
[46:07] Babylon built on pride and
[46:11] pretense a memorial to
[46:13] man this is what was built up it's a
[46:15] memorial to man it's a boasting even we
[46:19] see the tiwer bible let us build us a
[46:21] city by Blood and by iniquity and this
[46:25] is verse 13 it shows us the vanity of
[46:27] their carnal labor behold it is not of
[46:29] the Lord of hosts that the people should
[46:30] labor in the very fire that the people
[46:32] should weary themselves for
[46:34] vanity and so I ask what are you
[46:38] building you building your own kingdom
[46:42] or you building
[46:43] his at the end of the day is it just
[46:45] another mystery Babylon or is it the
[46:48] mystery of
[46:49] God cuz what a Razor's Edge What a fine
[46:54] line as it brings this the Spectre woe
[46:57] to him that builds a town with blood and
[46:59] establishes a city by
[47:01] iniquity what are we
[47:04] building what what is what are the what
[47:06] are the materials I'm using to build my
[47:11] testimonium what materials are we using
[47:13] Even in our testimony of our church and
[47:15] our our Ambitions and what we emphasize
[47:19] and what we say is important if we if we
[47:21] took our testimony which are stones and
[47:24] we and we take all these things and we
[47:25] start trying to add them up what are we
[47:28] building if everything we say and
[47:31] everything we support and a brother was
[47:33] talking we're desirous to have and I
[47:35] didn't get any feedback on whether or
[47:37] not they scheduled it or not but we're
[47:38] hoping to have a Brother's breakfast uh
[47:40] this coming Saturday is that still a go
[47:42] I don't know it is a go we're announcing
[47:43] it right now how do you like that top
[47:45] billing next Saturday the Lord will and
[47:47] you want to have a Brother's breakfast
[47:49] and some of the the burning desire in
[47:51] the brother's Hearts is that I just
[47:52] don't want to get together and talk
[47:53] about sports right I that doesn't or
[47:58] hunting
[47:59] right that's not what you want that
[48:01] doesn't want to be added all up what is
[48:04] it that has preeminence what is the
[48:05] story we're telling as we Fellowship
[48:07] about things and give emphasis to things
[48:09] the question is what are we
[48:11] building
[48:15] Hallelujah the iron of me saying that
[48:17] while I'm wearing baseball cuff
[48:20] links because the Texas Rangers finally
[48:22] won a World
[48:24] Series
[48:28] but notice verse
[48:31] 14 for the Earth shall be filled with
[48:33] the knowledge of the glory of the Lord
[48:35] as the waters cover the sea Now isn't
[48:37] that a striking turn of events yes wo to
[48:41] him that build a town with blood and
[48:42] establish a city by iniquity behold it's
[48:45] not of the Lord of hosts that the people
[48:46] shall labor in the very fire and the
[48:48] people shall weary themselves for very
[48:50] vanity well what okay that's awful
[48:53] that's horrible and the Lord's
[48:54] questioning so here's the answer think
[48:56] for the Earth shall be filled with the
[48:58] knowledge of the glory of the Lord as
[48:59] the waters cover the sea now that's a
[49:01] reminder to the people Jerusalem will be
[49:04] built again the temple will be restored
[49:07] again From the Ashes she will rise from
[49:10] the rubble she will be built up Stone by
[49:13] Stone Brick by Brick the house of God
[49:17] will live
[49:20] again from the dust and from the
[49:23] ruin Jerusalem it would bring to mind
[49:26] the fact it's coming to Kingdom age why
[49:29] would we build a town by Blood why would
[49:32] we establish a city by iniquity why
[49:34] would we labor in the very fire and
[49:36] weary ourselves with vanity when the
[49:38] whole Earth shall be filled with the
[49:40] knowledge of the Lord and I would say to
[49:43] you today what is needed right now I ask
[49:45] it as a question what is needed right
[49:47] now and and whatever it is you might
[49:49] begin to elicit well I've got physical
[49:51] problems I've got marital problems I'm
[49:53] I'm in a transition right now in my life
[49:54] I've got a young family we're just
[49:56] starting out in marriage or we're just
[49:57] starting to have children every these
[49:59] different things you might find yourself
[50:00] in all these different stages what would
[50:03] you need to
[50:05] emphasize what should have
[50:08] preeminence what's the first thing we
[50:10] should do a de
[50:12] snowball what's the first thing we
[50:14] should go get blood work
[50:16] done first thing we should do is call
[50:18] upon God for
[50:22] Revelation now this will work as a
[50:24] transition
[50:27] and to some future
[50:28] Services I've been studying I I think
[50:31] maybe we'll just call the next series
[50:32] the house of
[50:34] God it says in Proverbs 4:
[50:37] 3-6 for wisdom is a house building amen
[50:42] and by understanding it is
[50:46] established and by knowledge shall the
[50:48] chambers be filled with all the precious
[50:51] and pleasant riches now are you God's
[50:54] house are you his building it's built by
[50:58] wisdom established by understanding and
[51:01] through knowledge it's filled with
[51:03] precious and pleasant riches
[51:05] am think of this through wisdom it's
[51:08] built through understanding it's
[51:11] established and by knowledge it's
[51:15] filled how are we going to be filled by
[51:19] knowledge wisdom builds and then it
[51:21] causes it to continue to be built up a
[51:23] wise man is strong yeah a man of
[51:25] understanding increaseth strength
[51:26] there's
[51:28] your knowledge is
[51:30] power for by wise counsel Thou shalt
[51:33] make thy war and in the multitude of
[51:36] counselors their
[51:38] safety brother Dan daisley told me one
[51:41] time he says I've got a scripture for
[51:43] you brother Aaron woe un do you lawyers
[51:47] and I said I've got one for you too wo
[51:49] is
[51:51] me but my answer whenever anybody says
[51:54] something about lawyers is saying the
[51:55] multi to the counselors Hallelujah their
[52:00] safety for by wise counsel Thou shalt
[52:03] make thy
[52:05] War Proverbs 9:1 wisdom hath builded her
[52:08] house she hath heun out her Seven
[52:10] Pillars I'm going to just go quickly
[52:12] here and skip over some of these details
[52:15] we'll get into them it later but this
[52:17] speaks of
[52:18] stability this is the stability and
[52:20] power of wisdom the durability of
[52:23] wisdom wisdom built her house
[52:26] so she rests
[52:27] secure wisdom has he out her Seven
[52:30] Pillars so she's not afraid that it's
[52:32] going to fall through wisdom is a house
[52:34] built not hastily not
[52:37] unadvisedly not ignorantly not just
[52:41] haphazardly but wisdom builds the house
[52:43] and understanding establishes It
[52:46] prepares it arranges it settles it makes
[52:48] it firm stabilizes it and then the house
[52:50] is filled by knowledge it makes it
[52:52] complete and satisfied wisdom builds
[52:55] understanding establishes in knowledge
[52:57] fs and brother Bram says no man knows
[53:00] the things of God Save The Spirit of of
[53:03] God and He To Whom the spirit of God
[53:05] reveals them we need to call on God for
[53:08] Revelation more than anything else in
[53:10] the world we've accepted the Bible we've
[53:13] accepted the great truths of it but it
[53:15] still is not real to most people because
[53:18] the Revelation by the spirit is not
[53:20] there the word has not been
[53:24] quickened
[53:26] we may believe
[53:28] it we may believe it absolutely but if
[53:31] we want it to be real it needs to be
[53:34] made Alive by
[53:39] Revelation musicians if you could
[53:41] come from the sermon
[53:54] indictment
[54:01] what are we
[54:03] building how can we build maybe I asked
[54:05] the question you know what are you
[54:09] building are you building a kingdom to
[54:12] yourself are you building a
[54:15] Babylon or is a Jerusalem being built in
[54:19] you God's wanting to build a kingdom in
[54:21] our
[54:23] hearts and I I'm wanting this to be a
[54:25] Challen a challenging service to
[54:28] challenge us to have a to awaken an
[54:31] appetite for the word of God in our
[54:33] hearts so many voices in the land today
[54:35] so much skepticism about the word so
[54:38] much watering down of the scripture so
[54:40] much uh revisionist history about the
[54:42] message and and and even Jesus Christ
[54:44] and Old Testament New Testament and
[54:47] anymore it's just a kind of a a
[54:49] subjective truth to to each his own and
[54:52] and there's such a watering down so many
[54:54] voices in the land today that would try
[54:57] to take the
[54:59] word and say it's not enough
[55:03] on and say you need the word Plus
[55:07] on when it's the word
[55:10] only now maybe some people have taken
[55:12] word only and made it something that's
[55:14] not on to it's it's not the word at all
[55:19] they say it's the word only but it's no
[55:20] it's only your
[55:22] word but we we should not be afraid of
[55:25] what God Said to take them by at his
[55:28] word what what's the only way you can
[55:30] know you're Overcoming By the
[55:34] word the word the total word all the
[55:37] word and what is it we need besides just
[55:40] like dry reading and just printing out
[55:42] of quotes and the weighing of quotations
[55:45] and we need the revelation of it he says
[55:48] today men Walk ignorantly This is called
[55:50] the
[55:52] indictment they're walking ignorantly
[55:54] and let me say this ignorance is no
[55:56] excuse under the law and just because
[55:58] they were ignorant brother brandham
[55:59] didn't refrain from indicting them they
[56:01] don't know that's the truth they think
[56:03] it's some kind of ism whether they think
[56:05] it's intellectualism or fanaticism or
[56:07] some other ISM they don't dig down deep
[56:10] enough to get into the spirit of
[56:13] Revelation they don't pray enough they
[56:16] don't call upon God
[56:19] enough what what what do they mean by
[56:21] call on God and enough is that mean just
[56:23] shouting
[56:25] screaming he's talking about getting in
[56:27] the spirit of Revelation called on God
[56:30] for Revelation more than anything else
[56:32] in the world not just blowing off steam
[56:36] not just ripping to shred our vocal
[56:38] cords but a heart cry and a longing for
[56:42] Revelation digging down deep enough to
[56:45] get in the spirit of Revelation they
[56:46] don't pray enough they don't call upon
[56:47] God enough they just lightly take it oh
[56:50] well I believe there's a God sure the
[56:52] devil believes the same thing the devil
[56:54] believes it more some than some people
[56:56] who claim to believe it the devil
[56:57] believes it and
[56:58] trembles people just believe it and just
[57:00] go on but the devil trembles knowing his
[57:03] judgment is coming and people believe it
[57:05] and don't pay no attention to the
[57:06] judgment is coming wow if the devil
[57:09] knowing his judgment's coming makes him
[57:11] tremble what would knowing your
[57:13] deliverance do for
[57:15] you knowing your judgment's been passed
[57:17] and you're
[57:18] sinless what ought it to do for us
[57:21] guilty of crucifying him he says sure I
[57:23] indict this generation finding them
[57:25] Guilty by the same word that found them
[57:27] guilty at the beginning that's right
[57:30] Jesus said who can condemn me he was the
[57:32] word made flesh and today the same word
[57:36] is made
[57:37] flesh and it's the word they crucify and
[57:40] why do they crucify it because they
[57:42] didn't call upon God enough or they
[57:44] don't call upon God enough for
[57:46] Revelation not that they don't call upon
[57:48] God enough but he says they don't call
[57:50] upon God enough to get into the spirit
[57:52] of Revelation so it can be made real to
[57:55] them so they can see past the veneer as
[57:58] we read earlier that people look at the
[58:00] word of God and they say the Bible says
[58:02] oh repent and be baptized in the name of
[58:04] Jesus Christ and they go ah what they
[58:06] want to find the spot that tickles their
[58:09] ears brother Daniel fory Darko who
[58:11] ministered for us a couple
[58:13] Services he has in his WhatsApp profile
[58:16] picture is someone going with the Q-tip
[58:19] in their
[58:20] ear and and I was like it's got to have
[58:23] some meaning to this I thought it was an
[58:25] mistake or accident very actually the
[58:26] first time you ever texted me I ignored
[58:28] it cuz I had no idea who this person was
[58:31] and uh and then so later on when he
[58:33] talked about it said what is this for he
[58:35] says they shall Heap to themselves
[58:36] teachers having itching
[58:40] ears that's what some people want right
[58:43] they just want to find something that
[58:44] tickles their fancy and since they pass
[58:47] right over they never get into the
[58:48] Revelation up they just shove it aside
[58:49] let's not be like those Q-tip
[58:53] Believers right they just want to itch
[58:55] their ears with certain things that the
[58:56] messenger said and not say Lord I need a
[58:59] revelation by your
[59:02] spirit so I canot fulfill the lust of
[59:05] the
[59:06] flesh if I've been made Alive by the
[59:09] spirit I want to walk in the spirit then
[59:12] I say Lord let through wisdom let this
[59:14] house be
[59:16] built by understanding let it be
[59:19] established CU I want to be a kingdom
[59:21] builder for his kingdom let's stand
[59:25] together and pray
