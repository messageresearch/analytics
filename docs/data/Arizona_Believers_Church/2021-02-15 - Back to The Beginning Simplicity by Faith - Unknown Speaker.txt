TRANSCRIPT
========================================
isaiah chapter 32 verses 9 to 20 and i'm reading these first several verses up to verse 17 just for context and background and also you'll see a contrast and some connections to what we're going to be speaking on this morning it says rise up you women that are at ease hear my voice you careless daughters give ear unto my speech many days and years shall ye be troubled you careless woman women for the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come tremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye careless ones strip you and make you bear and gird sackcloth upon your loins they shall lament for for the teats for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vine upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers yea upon all the houses of joy and the joyous city because the palaces shall be forsaken the multitude of the city shall be left the forts and towers shall be for dens forever a joy of wild ass a joy of wild ass as a pasture of flocks until the spirit be poured upon us from on high in the wilderness be a fruitful filled and the fruitful field be counted for a forest then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness remain in the fruit fulfilled and the work of the righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and ensure dwellings and in quiet resting places you may be seated i hope to come back to that uh those last two verses towards the end on how the work of righteousness is peace the effect of righteousness is quietness and assurance forever and then my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and ensure dwellings and in quiet resting places doesn't that just describe something you want just a wonderful wonderful description my title today is back to the beginning and simplicity by faith and we're continuing on the theme of how things have become very complicated focusing on genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 we saw how that life was simple in the beginning and then genesis chapter 3 is what brings the complication and complication started to set in as soon as a question was asked of the woman that god had already answered and she began to ponder what those implications might be the lie that followed and this had an impact upon her spirit it gave her knowledge that god had not given her knowledge contrary to the word of the lord it was a lie you shall not die it was a lie that you would become as god knowing good and evil and you'd be wise and you'd have this understanding that would be opened but the knowledge opened herself up to desire and long for an experience so it went just beyond information and it turned into experiencing something which manifested in the fall and we we've acknowledged that life in the beginning though it was simple it could be described as complex but god gave them a rule to live by a word to live by and with structure with order and with boundaries and with roles and certain irrational a godly rationale to approach creation it took the complexity away so that the man and the women could just live simple god gave them a word to live by they could have faith in that word and they could just walk forward in that promise and so complication was born from something that was not true wisdom something that had not been in the word of god something that was contrary to truth and once complication enters into the picture it's irrational it's unpredictable you don't know which is up or which is down you don't know exactly what the reasoning is behind it because a lie doesn't need to have any kind of rationale a lie doesn't need to have reasoning lie doesn't really need to have a foundation or a base though those who use lies often try to bolster with a lot of facts and a lot of data a lot of information and sometimes when a person's giving a little bit too much detail you start to wonder is this are they making this up because how could somebody remember that that much detail but but something that's not true doesn't really have anything to back it up so it's unpredictable you can't rely on it you can't you can't trust it and so today i'm i'm just beginning on the thought of getting back to simplicity or back to the beginning and simplicity by faith and so that this is exactly how i want to present it how do we get back to simplicity how do we get away from things that are complicated how do we not get caught up in in the labyrinth of complexity you go back to the beginning and i believe we can go back to the beginning and identify the very things that complicates life we've looked at it in genesis chapter three but now i want to take a step further in genesis chapter four so that's kind of just my little bit of a foundation and let's turn in genesis chapter four and read verses one to two and then we're just going to stay in genesis chapter 4 skipping just a few verses here and there to follow this as a story so genesis chapter four we'll start with verses one and two and it says and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived in bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord and she bear again his brother abel even the the jews when they look back upon these scriptures believed that cain and abel were born as twins and so it says cain was born then abel was born and then it lists abel first which is a very interesting uh factor to name abel first even though cain was bore first or it shows in the scripture he was born first to mention abel first is an interesting point but then it says this and abel was the keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and i just want to start right here um and i'll preface by saying this even though we're looking at genesis chapter 4 we're trying to understand 2021. so even though we're going back to genesis chapter 4 we're only doing this because these scriptures we're not only doing it for this reason but we're doing this because the scriptures were written for our benefit and for our learning they're written so that we can draw strength and comfort from them and they can be instructive to us so there's something that we can learn today from these very verses that are written and when you read it you have adam and the woman adam and eve they have two sons cain and abel it says abel was a keeper of sheep and cain was a tiller of the ground so you have a shepherd and a farmer and when you begin to think about it there really wasn't very many other professions outside of that so when they're born daddy what can i be when i grow up and and and adam was like well you could either be a farmer or you could be a shepherd you could either plow on the field or you could herd the sheep there really wasn't any other choices so they had a very simple decision to make as they were growing up and some speculate that cain being the firstborn adam being described as a tiller of the ground uh asked that cain be the designated him to be the farmer but in these two professions and these two walks of life and these two callings and these two daily tasks that adam that abel and cain were to bear from these two tasks you find that every necessity of life could be met within these professions as adam excuse me abel being a keeper of the sheep this the sheep themselves could be a source of meat a source of milk a source of clothing a source of you could tan the hides to make tents and to make dwelling so the the sheep itself could be something that could provide even if they were never um killed for meat it could be used for milk they could be used for wool there's a lot of things that could be done from this sheep to provide resources to preserve life and cain being a tiller of the ground he could grow fruit he could grow grain there could be vegetables there's herbs that he could grow so just think i'm just trying to want you to think about how simple life was even after the fall in some sense and we might call this primitive labor labor it means it was this was the first kind of labor that was done by man it's the first it was primary uh we could even say it's primitive in the sense that it was extremely basic but it was only what was necessary to sustain life that's all that that's all that able was doing that's all that adam was doing that's all that cain was doing that which was necessary to feed the body to clothe the body and those are the things that they engaged in those are the things that they did on a daily basis and we could if you i was even just pondering it this past week of how many professions are there now compared to how many there were then and say well if you can take an aptitude test there was only two results you're either going to be a farmer or you're going to be a shepherd and but nowadays there's thousands and thousands of professions and there's always new ones that are coming forth there's always new ones that are being created there's who would have thought that you could have on your resume influencer right i mean that's what you do for a living you're an influencer and well what do you do i just make little short little video clips and i get paid for it like wow that sounds like the life right but there's people who who make living and not just make living they make some of them make millions of dollars it's a very very small segment so don't start thinking lord i want to grow up to be an influencer very very small segment of the population but when you think of the millions of dollars that are being earned in some industries or some professions and some uh some jobs you think where did that come from where did that money come from but yet there's constantly new areas of revenue and new areas of income and things that can be done and so nowadays someone says well what do you want to be when you grow up mutants well i want to be a a blacksmith or i want to be a farmer i want to be an innkeeper it's so much more broad now than it's ever been before and that adds to the complications of life especially when we we got further away from agrarian society into an industrial society the things about home and community begin to break down and now things are very fragmented and and even within industries you say well i'm in this industry but you can be in a niche within that industry then you can be a niche within a niche and then you could be within a niche within that niche of a niche and that's just the way that it works so somebody asks you a question i have no idea well i thought you were in this industry but i'm in this part of the industry just when people ask about lawyers they say well do you go to court do you go to trial but less than five percent of all lawyers um even go to court less than 10 percent they're they're not litigators they're more than a great majority over 90 or in areas of law that you probably haven't even thought of they oh lawyers do that yes they do that why because it's more complicated or you could say complex than it ever was so i'm just wanting to bring this contrast here at the very beginning how that abel was a keeper of sheep cain was a tiller of the ground and this is what they would do every day they would wake up and they would begin to till the ground they'd wake up they'd begin to shepherd the sheep but it wasn't a life without hope and this is where we're zeroing in on something that it's just so easy kind of to lose track of what was there in the beginning because they say well man and the woman were placed in the garden of eden it was perfect they had a promise a word to live by and when they sinned they were just shoved out into chaos and life has been chaotic ever since and we're all just kind of chaotic sinners pleading for the grace of god but you can go all the way back to genesis 4 and see that there was some order and there was some sense of the divine that still gave meaning and purpose to the lives that were being lived because it wasn't just a life without hope it wasn't a life that was worthless it wasn't just a life where man was just living to return to the dust well one day i guess i'm just going to go to the dust but in genesis chapter 3 specifically genesis chapter 3 verse 15 god had prophesied of a redeemer god had prophesied of one that would come who would bring a remedy who would bring a help who'd be a savior or a deliverer to man these feelings that man experienced the fallen nature that man would have though it may be expressed in very simple words and maybe even to some degree symbolic of all the things that god might have actually said to adam god told adam and the woman as they're going don't fear i will send you a man who's going to rescue you don't worry it may look bad right now and you may be fearful right now and you may may be worried about your future but one day a woman will bring forth a man and this man will destroy everything that this serpent caused woman i know you feel deceived i know you feel duped i know you feel responsible for ruining this eden but one day a woman will bring forth a child and he will be the help that you need he will be the remedy to sin he will be the answer to all this confusion you're feeling right now and so they had a source of encouragement god had given them a word still even as they left the garden he'd given them something that they could place their faith upon something that they could believe for so although they were doing the things that were necessary to sustain life by being a keeper of sheep and a tiller of the ground it was most necessary to have faith in god it was most necessary that they looked to the promise because god had given them a promise before they're completely banished out of the garden god said i will send you a deliverer so adam and the woman now are living with this con with this consciousness of the promise that god said he would send us help now could you just get that in your minds as simple as it might be and i feel that's really the remedy to all the complications is just to address this very simply in the scripture not try to dig out all the types and count the numbers and say see notice that that's the seventh word it has seven letters and it's seven in the seventh column of your bible i'm getting let's get past that right now sometimes what people do is they find a type and then build the truth around it instead of finding truth and then looking for the types we want to stick to truth what i wanted to share with you today is truth and if there's beautiful types we could talk about it at lunch because i enjoy them but we want to just look at it very simply now at how that god had given them a promise so they're conscious of this promise and it gave them something to take the faith that they had and place it on that promise so faith becomes the foundation upon which they're now living their lives in genesis 4. not the same faith that we would have today on particular promises that we have now but look at it in that simple dynamic of a man and a woman with children who are thrust into a chaotic world where they're not sure what's coming next they're not sure what to expect but they knew one thing god spoke and said if you eat that fruit you die and they learn that was true and they knew this god's the one that created heaven and earth this is the god that walked with them and visited them in the eden and the voice of the lord that would come and make his presence known and now he's thrust them out they've seen his mighty hand even in being banished from the garden and now he said listen i will send you a deliver i will send you a helper and they knew to take their faith and base it upon that and so you could even imagine that for adam and the woman there was one thing that was necessary there was one thing that was needful as jesus told mary this she has chosen she had chosen the good part he told martha martha you're so busy being encumbered and that was the feedback i got from wednesday night as i kept getting mary and martha mixed up so that's the feedback i get on the drive home is dad when are you ever going to figure out who mary is and who martha is so and who abel and who adam is today so things are there just so my kids know i'm human otherwise they would just be thinking who is this guy he's from another world but mary had chosen the one thing necessary as jesus said it and chosen that good part and so we're going back to the beginning to see that there's always been one thing necessary there's always been the good part that could be chosen and it just seems to be the very thing that makes sense of everything else or gives you a confidence to believe that if it's outside this i'm not going to worry about it if it's outside this i'm not going to try to make sense of it and i can't use the things that are outside of that to turn this upside down or take it away from me and so this was the one thing necessary faith and the promise so now verse three and and and this this next act to me is connected with this promise and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel into his offering but a decaying into his offering he had not respect in cain was very roth and his countenance fell now if you could just imagine how that cane offers an offering from the ground it would have been a very beautiful altar it would have been fruits that were given things that he had cultivated and grown fruit and grain and herbs and vegetables and you'll find that even in the old testament there's a grain offering you'll find that there's things that could be given as tithes or things that are given from from a worshipper that god would receive and so cain builds an altar and he offers these these sacrifices of fruit from the ground to the lord then abel perhaps at the same time maybe even before but in some proximity to cain's offering he offers the firstling of his flock and the fat thereof and so this was a bloody mess literally right this was an altar that would have smelled this is something that would have been repulsive this could have been an act that was very off-putting uh even decaying or maybe there if there were sisters alive or other siblings alive at the time this is something that could have been like oh my goodness what are what are my older brothers doing but he offers this sacrifice and god in some way respects abel's offering but doesn't canes and there's a tremendous lesson in this as we pondered this that there's abel does what he feels in his heart to do and having done it god gives this respect to it whether he consumes it with fire god does something to show that he respected his offering and cain's take takeaway from this abel's sincere offering cain offers sincere worship god respects abel cain though says he's very roth he's angry he's very very mad and his countenance has fallen in other words he's going to let you know he's mad he looked mad he wasn't just putting on a happy face and making it look like everything's fine no nothing's wrong i promise nothing's wrong he was he was very you could tell he was something was wrong now kane abel's offering was connected with god's promise the very offering of this lamb he was a he was a keeper of the sheep so he would have taken a lamb a sheep an innocent lamb and he was slain it upon the altar and allowed that blood to be shed and what abel was doing reflected genesis 3 15 because the man that would be born of that woman that would crush the serpent's head he would do it as being a lamb he would do it as being a sacrifice that would shed his blood so whether or not abel fully understood that even in his revelation and his offering it was connected with that and then it was also connected with the provision that god had given in 3 21 genesis 3 21 dressed them in skins it would have been a bleeding lamb it would have been a bloody sheep that was slain that adam took and slew and then made coats and made skins to cover himself in so abel's worship is connected with the promise of god connected with the prophecy of there being a deliverer and even how it says in revelations 3 13 8 that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so this is something abel has his worship is connected with something divine it's connected to god's promise and in hebrews chapter 11 verse 4 it says by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by faith in other words by revelation abel was able to offer a more excellent sacrifice so what made his worship greater than cain's you can say well because it was connected to the lamb and it was connected to genesis 3 21 it was connected to genesis 3 15. it's connected to revelations 13 8. it was connected to this it's connected to that it represented christ and we could see yes those are things that make the revelation seem so significant but what abel did is he acted by faith he acted by revelation god had quickened it god had revealed it to him he by faith offered up that offering by which he obtained witness that he was righteous it was by his faith that he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts wherein god had respect unto his offering and then it says and by it by the faith he being dead yet speaketh now this is this is how it's instructive even still to us today abel's righteous acts still declare still speak that it's best to act by faith what he did in the beginning if you just look at him in the most simple basic terms without the types and without book of revelations without before the foundation of the world without even fully understanding genesis 3 just looking at the very basics of what was done the word of god identifies that abel offered the lamb by faith cain did not offer by faith and so abel still testifies his blood still speaks today that it's best to act by faith it's best to be doing what you're doing by faith and since it's written this way it directly implies that cain acted without the necessary requirement of faith it directly implies this it's it's absolutely right that we would take this from it um because it's being implied it's been we're being told this to look at this and abel is recognized as having faith therefore it's telling us that cain did not have faith that cain and acting he acted as if the ceremony was enough that as long as i just give the worship that'll be enough as long as i just give him his due yeah yeah yeah he's a god it doesn't matter how you worship him just give him some kind of worship cain was a little bit dismissive and though he may have been sincere in his offering and though it may have been perfect and it may have been beautiful cain lacked something deep down on the inside to know that he was offering this offering by faith and brother branham even makes a statement in one place and maybe a couple places where it's uh if it says well why did cain bring this and why did abel bring that he makes a statement referring to cain's offering and and he says as he was taught by his parents there may have been a reluctance on the part of adam and the woman to share everything that had happened in the garden and there may have been they may have spoken even symbolically say well why did you why did you why did this happen or why did that happen uh and they say well god told us not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and and we partook of that fruit in doing so we were cast out of the garden and cain takes it very literally it was fruit that done it then i'm gonna offer fruit now think of how sincere he would have been then but then abel gets more a deeper revelation there's something that's quickened to him and by faith he doesn't just stick to what may be symbolic he doesn't just stick to even what his big brother was doing there's something inside that says i have this unction and this feeling of faith based upon what what has been shared to me and what god is showing to me to offer a lamb an innocent lamb and sacrifice and so cain thought ceremony was enough but abel knew he needed to act by faith and did the bible says in hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him this stands for us today it's impossible to do things that please god unless faith is underneath it and that goes for anything that if there's not faith with it it doesn't please god without faith it is impossible to please him this is something that though we read it within the context of coming to god and believing that he is and believing that he's a rewarder this is a statement that stands on its own without faith it is impossible to do things that please him now cain's act of worship was not worthless in itself but since it was offered without faith it condemned him and there's a lot of theologians that debate on the the the fruit offering itself wasn't sinful uh and the offering of abel itself as a lamb was not even was was it more righteous and and you can see that just in the language that's used within the bible that's all the bible's dealing with the abel offered by faith cain didn't so what was it that made cain's offering uh displeasing it was the fact that he did not have faith in offering it and that's what condemned him that's why when he saw that god had respect unto abel's offering he was wroth and his countenance fell because he didn't have that confidence in the end that what he did was right because had cain offered by faith and abel offered by faith though it may look like abel gets all the recognition cain by faith would have been satisfied that his offering was enough because it's faith that pleases god and do you realize that's where we get pulled into situations and scenarios that are very very hard on us and tear us apart and life becomes very very confusing because someone acts by faith and god blesses their faithful acts and then you are torn well i don't know what to do just act in faith and even if it doesn't turn out the way theirs turned out you can only go by what you know is right you can only act in faith so as immediately cain is exposed when he saw that god had respect unto abel's offering his lack of faith was exposed in that his emotions began to stir up within him that he was angry and his countenance fallen he knew immediately he wasn't right in what he had done he knew that he had only acted out a ceremony he knew he had only acted out of a head knowledge the bible says in romans 14 23 for whatsoever is not of faith is sin if you're not fully persuaded that it pleases god it condemns your conscience now you want to talk about simplifying life you want to talk about resolving paradoxes and get rid of complexes and avoiding scenarios that bind us and hold us down if you're not fully persuaded that it pleases god then your own to you it is sin without faith it is impossible to please him but then also for us whatever is not of faith is sin our conscience will condemn us if we know we're not acting fully persuaded that it pleases god and i want to focus on this at the beginning and highlight it because this is what i want you to see this pattern i want you to see it as we continue all the way to genesis chapter 12 and we're going to read every single verse very slowly at my hourly rate i want you to recognize this variance now in the beginning because this variance on the part of cain cannot be overlooked because once you could focus in on this and realize what cane did you have a shepherd and you have a farmer these are the two walks of life they're raising sheep they're growing corn they're raising sheep they're growing fruit they're raising sheep and they're growing herbs and and kane can always say i've got a lot more diversity in my field than yours and okay that's fine but they both one was a farmer one was a shepherd they both brought things to the table they participated in communal living and they had a promise that they were living for and according to that promise they offered up worship to the god who made the promise as an acknowledgment of his greatness and his power as a a as an act of sincerity within their hearts but now if we when we look at this this part of this act on cain's part this missing part and what what his act lacked so we want to call it his variance or his step away from something what he overlooked it highlights the complications of life even to this day it highlights what's wrong with religion and what's wrong with worship and what's wrong with so many different ways of trying to find god is because cain left something and his step away from this is what you can see in every single act of disobedience every single act of rebellion in every single complication that exists in life and so i want to focus on cain varied from this act in worship he varied from faith and immediately his lack of faith was exposed in his emotional state then god tells him well why are you angry why are you so upset cain that dynamic in itself is shocking god's still speaking to man god is still somehow communicating to cain so he said well then how did abel know to offer a lamb well how did cain know that what he offered was wrong god talked to him in whatever way he spoke in whatever way he communicated it says that god spoke and this is the question that god asked in verse 7 if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door that's the first part of that verse if thou do as well shalt not not be accepted if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door here god is bringing cain to the threshold of the promise he's telling him that there is something that you can do well there is a better way that what abel did was a more excellent sacrifice what abel did he did it by faith and he's telling cain if you do it the way that abel did it then you could be accepted he was giving cain the opportunity to receive something that could he could believe in if thou doest well that means well pleasing or to do good so it's not just merely doing the work but doing it right it's not just merely going through the motions and performing the act but doing it correctly he said so if you do it well you will be accepted as abel was accepted now in order to do it pleasing and to do it right cain would have to do it by faith so he said if you can do it by faith then you will be accepted he says but if you do not do it well if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door another sin is in your mind it's in your heart if you're not doing it by faith then sin lies at the door cain's conscience condemned him already and he's telling look if you don't do it by faith your conscience will condem you continue to condemn you he was already angry he had a fallen countenance he was already very roth when he saw that abel abel's offering was respected and it was because he lacked the faith in his own offering and god is saying as long as you act without faith you're going to remain in this condition sin life at the door it's right there at your heart sin lies there he knew he was wrong immediately even before god talked to him he knew he was wrong he knew he was wrong by the emotions he was feeling he knew he was wrong by the way he responded to his brother jealousy can't be right he knew these things were wrong so as god says sin lieth at the door there was actually two things that were set before him if thou doest dwell he was showing him the door of faith he was given him an opportunity to consider that there was something different than what he had been doing already that he could walk into and that he could receive and on the other hand you could keep doing what you're doing and sin is going to eat at your conscience and you're going to feel this condemnation all the time so there was doors that he could take choose your own adventure came do you want to take god at his word who says there's a way that you can do this right and there's a way that you can do this well or you just want to continue doing what you're doing and cain had opportunity in that moment to say well lord why was it that you respected abel's offering lord what is it that i must do to please you i offered in sincerity believing that it would please you if i'm wrong then lord what is it that i need to know what what can you share with me what can you show me could you give me some leadership could you give me some guidance could you show me the right way to take in this instance i'm not sure what to do versus what get angry and kill your brother you could almost take that that that that dynamic and impose it on many different instances that take place in our lives all the time humble yourself to god admit that you're wrong ask him to show you what's right or take a step back and start criticizing this other person and running them down and making up reasons why they're not doing the right thing and why they're this and why they're that and that's exactly what cain chose to do he chose jealousy he chose envy he chose murder all he did was make it more complicated because one moment he he offered the wrong sacrifice he's wrong and the the worst thing about being wrong is being wrong it's got a huge upside right as soon as you know you're wrong you can get right and to a member to a son or daughter of god to the bride there should be no fear in being wrong because if you find out you're wrong that's your opportunity to be right it's your opportunity to make things right it's your opportunity to say i'm sorry i made a mistake lord forgive me to whomever you would make that apology to and you get right so don't live in fear of finding out you're doing something wrong live say lord if i'm doing something wrong show me because i want to be right and so cain then further complicated life because now he's just didn't offer the wrong sacrifice and do it without faith not only was he just angry and jealous but now he's a murderer and and he and and obviously he's not thinking through just how much more complicated he's been yeah your little brother got a better grade and your little brother is more popular and your little brother gets more attention and you know sometimes you see this dynamic in twins where there's a twin that's more athletic more fun more funny and more even identical twins but the one twin could be more gregarious and outgoing and more accepted have more friends be more popular be more athletic and it creates a complex in the other twin and they grow up in an adult life and it's almost as if they've never gotten past eight years old when they lived in their twin shadow and so cain if he had looked at all the studies and and saw all the research they'd been doing in the universities at the time he could have been fearful that he was going to live in his brother's shadow the rest of his life but that would have been that's all that it would have been but instead he becomes a murderer now it gets really complicated and cain acknowledges it to in his response well now that i've shed blood i'm going to be hunted i'm going to be a miserable creature this is what happens when you leave faith this is what happens when you won't just humble yourself to the word of god and accept that its right so when god condemns cain he's worried that he's going to be hunted and but then god says in verse 12 genesis chapter 4 verse 12 when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength cain when he was a farmer before as it said it came was a tiller of the ground he was gifted with the ground there was something that he did with the soil there was a knowledge he had an experience that he had where he knew how to plant and he knew how to uh to put in these rows and to sow these seeds he knew how to bring stuff out of the earth but now god is saying because you are a murderer because you've shed the blood of abel upon the ground the earth is no longer going to yield up her strength unto thee the earth was already cursed but now his labor was increased the earth being incursed and adam's labor already being multiplied now he's saying that the labor that comes upon you will and be increased and you will not be as fruitful as you were before we cannot even imagine what it was like in the garden we cannot even imagine what it would have been even in the fall because the ground we work with now is ground that cain made sure came forth it's a ground that was further cursed and cursed within humanity that whereas cain could get strength from the ground and there was a certain way that he could use the soil said something changes now with the curse that follows cain to where it's not going to be as fruitful for him as it was before and this is a direct result of disobedience this is a direct result of refusing to humble himself to the will of god so he had already put himself in a position to realize he's wrong and to be angry by not offering by faith but god said if you just do it by faith you'll be accepted and you could have said lord what can i do to please you what can i do in order to live by faith but instead he chose murder and he chose to slay his brother and in doing so he made a bigger mess by defying the will of god consciously going against and opposing the will of god and then it's cain's unrighteousness that continues in his descendants cain chose this fleshly gratification over the promise and the fleshly gratification of revenge the fleshly gratification of avenging himself of this jealousy and this hatred towards his brother that this uh coming back and getting back at abel for offering a better sacrifice this act of jealousy this act of rage even cain in offering the fruit of the ground could do it without sacrifice cain and offering the way that he offered there was it was not connected with faith it was not real obedience to the word of god so there's something within the way that cain thinks and now this i want you to notice this just using some brief scriptures how that this act of cain continues in his children choosing the flesh choosing the mind choosing the will of the flesh over the promise verse 16 of genesis chapter 4 we'll read verse 17 as well and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden the land of nod whatever you do don't go there this morning but the land of god that word nod means aimless it means wondering no expectations cain went into the land of not it receives that designation because cain went without any promise cain went he was aimless he was wandering he he didn't know what the future would hold and not knowing what the future would hold not knowing that there was a place for him not knowing that there was anything that belonged to him he went aimless he just was wondering he had no expectations so cain goes from the presence of the lord think of that he left from the presence of the lord what distinguished the presence of that place where god was speaking the place where god was making his will known god speaks to king that's what cain was running from cain was wanting to run from the voice of god that made him conscious of his heir that made him conscious of the way that was right and made him conscious of the fact that he was not walking in it and so he went out from the presence of the lord to a place of aimless wondering and came to his wife and she conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch so he has a son he builds a city and calls it enoch city a city is a place that is guarded the very word that's used there is he builded a city a an encampment a place guarded by waking or by watch and the very word for city there from the root and the hebrew comes from excitement or terror now why did cain feel the need to build a city because of his dread because of his terror his motivation behind building a city was so that they could build up walls and have an encampment and do it in such a way for they could always be on watch for abe for his brothers always be on watch for man who would be out to take him because he shed innocent blood so now he's worried that the family is going to avenge themselves so he cannot just live peaceably in the wilderness he can't just go and find a place that's suitable for raising sheep and suitable for for growing crops he has to build an encampment and build a city which would have never been needed before never needed this kind of civilization but because of his fear because of his dread it means because of excitement or terror all because of his own sin all because of his own fears he had to build a city an enchantment which was waking and watching so they had to always be on guard stripped of contentment stripped of peace he had to devise ways to protect himself not being able to rest not being able to know that he could just work and put his shoulder to the plow and put his eye towards the line and look at his sheep he had to keep watching over his shoulder and because he couldn't have that peace he could not have that contentment he had to come up with ways to protect himself he had to devise ways to bring that sense of satisfaction because he lost it as as just as just a farmer he could farm and look to the promise farm and look to the promise but now that he was a murderer he had to farm and he'd lost sight of the promise and he had to worry about vengeance he had to worry about karma he had to worry about what was coming to get him so he could not just live life simply in getting things from the soil and using the things or at his at his disposal to sustain life and have children and tell them about a promise that god had made to his family many many years ago now he needs to protect himself and devise ways to protect himself and now he has to quiet the fear the condemnation and the wrath and the jealousy that he has within his heart so now he has to devise ways to silence that voice of conviction that's down in his heart he had to come up with some way to dole the fear to dole the conviction we're reading this from genesis 4 but can we get a hearty amen that that's today that's why mankind is so full of all the things he has today so you'll find in his progeny as his seed comes forth as his children are born and their children are born and as you contrast the two lineages of of seth and those of cain it's in kane's lineage that you find polygamy that you find more murder with lamech he was a polygamist he was a murderer and you see an expansion of civilization you see an expansion of certain sciences in verse 20 of genesis 4 6 4. it says jabel was father of those who made tents and raised cattle so this seems innocent enough it's a means of sustaining life it's one of the sons of lamech i believe and it's a pla you can get protection from it you can make tents uh you can you can get meat there's so many things in milk it was very simple maybe on this part of jabel but his brother jubal who shared the same mother he was the father of all as such as handle the harp and organ now see these are generations that come forth he says he was the father of those who made tents this was the father those that handled the harp and organ now you see musical instruments making their appearance and so yes you still had one who could be a farmer or be a sheep herder one who would be a shepherd one who'd be a cattleman but now there's these other things that are coming and families are being characterized by these instincts and these abilities and they're cultivating these skills and now jubal and his family he's the father of this whole family that comes forth that can handle the harp and the organ they're skilled in they're skilled in instruments these men are inventors even it says in verse 22 of tubal kane an instructor of every artificer in brass and i in iron which is they made weapons and they and they made armor and they could construct things by smelting and by welding and putting things together and they could get this ore that was in the earth and they could fashion these things whoever needed a weapon if all you were needed was a sheep farmer and all you needed what was uh was the the the contents from the soil but now they need armor they need weaponry these are inventors of instruments and warf weapons of warfare and this is in the seventh generation from king by the seventh generation is you have this great great great great grandson that comes forth of cain now they're inventors and they're devising different ways of entertaining themselves protecting themselves even offensive weapons to to kill and to hunt and to destroy and so within the lineage of cain you see great accomplishments and great advancements and even the polishing and refinement of skill you see it in music you see it in industry you see it in science you see it in knowledge and all these things are increasing yet sin is increasing so it's not that man is living righteous and these things are coming forth from righteous living but sin is increasing with polygamy and murder and they're devising more ways to do what to protect themselves and quiet that voice that keeps telling them you're getting away from something your great great great great great grandfather cain didn't worship by faith and that little step away from how he ought to have lived the one thing necessary he took one step away from that and now seventh gen seven generations later where is everything brother brother made an extraordinary observation and he says this and i believe it's in the 1950s it could have been an early 60s where he says in just 100 years or 50 years at the time man has gone from a horse and buggy to a rocket ship to an astronaut now think about that in just five decades went from propelling themselves to natural horsepower that's where the term horsepower comes from for those that didn't realize that they drew themselves with with a carriage with a horse and buggy and mankind went from that as the primary means of transportation to where now there's a rocket ship taking men to the moon he says how did we get there he said man let loose of his faith in god and gave himself over to his own abilities is man able to do these things are men able to do these things yes man can do these great things but what let loose his power to do it when he left off just simply trusting in god just believing in god his simple faith in him as abel would have kept this righteous living and this faith in god if cain would have said well how did you do that how did this i don't understand how did that work he said well i just pray to ask god then god does the same thing for cain then man would have never varied from that if we could assume that had the woman never fell in the garden that all of us would have come forth in a perfect eden that it may be safe to assume that had there never been one step away from the faith and the promise then we would not have known all the things that we knew today but yet it was sown within the flesh of cain this weakness to where he could not humble himself to the word of god and again to accomplish god's objective here's one that can step outside of the promise and in doing so it lays this imprint and all of his progeny to where they're let loose of their faith in god they're no longer trusting god they're trusting their own ability and they can fashion instruments they can build great cities they can form weapons they can invent things they can devise things they can increase in all these industries but yet while they're doing it sin increases and we'll come to where the bible refers to that here in just a moment in genesis chapter 6 but look at genesis chapter 4 verse 25-26 all those things that we say about cain says and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth for god saith he she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew it's act even appointing her another seed instead of cain not only does it replace abel but it replaces cain and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos so here you have adam who has a son named seth seth has a son named enos and this is how we describe the sons of adam then begin men to call upon the name of the lord as we read about cain and his lineage they're inventing instruments and they're and they're building cities and they're crafting weapons and and they're coming up with this and they're coming up with that and let's just be honest if we wanted to hang out with the crowd like who do you want to go live with you want to live with enos you want to go live with jabel uh can i live with uncle jabel i want to hang out with jubal he's got instruments i want to go live with tubal kane he's got weapons and he's got a ps5 there's all sorts of awesome things that they had in cain's lineage but how does it describe adam's family the the family of seth and enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord the sons of adam or the sons of god is what it's saying sought god then began men to call upon the name lord it could be written this way then sons of god begin to seek god and call on god the sons of adam were still connected to the promise whereas cain ran from the presence of the lord now they're not running from his presence but they're seeking it cain wanted to get as far away from it as possible i didn't want to hear what's right i don't want to hear god talking anymore i don't want to be challenged with what happened in genesis 3. i don't want to be challenged with what happened with my brother abel i just want to get away from here where are you going i don't know i'm just wondering i want to go i got to build a city i want to raise children and they give themselves over and over and over towards seven generations later they have a family of instrument makers they have a family of of weapon makers they have a great big huge civilization with this big thriving economy but god is nowhere in their conscience but now with enos and his sons and as it begins to come forth these men begin to call upon the name of the lord not running from the promise seeking the promise and established an unbroken rule that you can take from this very moment in genesis chapter 4 within the very shadows of the fall of genesis 3 that despite the fall men could still seek god's presence or disregard it you could not just make the excuse well now that we've been banished from the garden they've sealed up the way to the tree of life no no no you couldn't use that as an excuse because god said one day i'll bring a man that'll take you back to that tree of life and so you had a you god had put it before you to choose life to choose blessing to choose to deliver to choose the promise and i'm going to choose to live by the promise and i choose to live by faith and somehow that's going to be foundational somehow that's going to be headship somehow this is going to be what leads me and guides me within the confines of everything else my life has but cain ran away from that so it establishes an unbroken principle that even though mankind had fallen you could choose to seek god's presence or you could disregard it and cain's descendants departed further and further and further from the righteousness that god had intended for man cain as he would have married his half-sister and begin to have children that line becomes even more entrenched in that way of thinking more entrenched in just releasing their their their human talents their human gifts and giving themselves over to what they think and what they feel and by the seventh generation you have polygamy and you have murder but then in the line of seth genesis chapter 5 verse 24 and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took them think of the difference between the seventh generation from adam through seth and the seventh generation from cain or even the seventh generation from adam through kane if you wanted to number it that way lamech a polygamist and a murderer but the seventh generation from cain is all sorts of inventors and divisors of different things and so you have the seventh generation from adam what is this guy doing he's walking with god in such a pleasing way to where god's like i don't want to share you with anybody walking so pleasing with god but god was so in love with the with enoch for these 365 years where he was so moved by the way that enoch lived how he was so dedicated to the promise so dedicated to the things that he understood the things that he knew and he so sought god that god took the seventh generation from adam and he took him and caused him to go on a rapture cause him to go into translation so that he would serve as a reminder to those of us who live in the seventh church age that there's a way that we can live and conduct ourselves 365 days a year in such a way that god plea is so pleased to one day take us home it's remarkable just to think of that and the historians from josephus and the different other other writers and commentators especially within the jewish tradition and oral history in written history they believe that adam and eve if you look at the lineages and how long adam lived adam was talking to these sons adam talked with seth adam talked with enos adam talked with enoch and enoch was catching a revelation of what adam was telling him what life was like in genesis 1 and 2. he was catching a revelation of all the promises of god he was telling him maybe one day adam told him said enoch i don't know if i've ever shared this with anybody before but you know that word that god gave us in the beginning he gave us a word that would take us from eden all the way to a body change in two to meet god without facing death can you believe that enoch he gave me a word that if we would have lived by it it would have taken us all the way from eden into the rapture and he never says that ain't nothing but the truth adam i believe that that is true and he just lived by that he talked with god and it so please god that enoch would have a simple faith towards the promise he walked with god and he was not for god took them that's the difference between the seven generations and the generations of the sons of adam who begin to call upon god and seek god in the seventh generation from cain who begin to devise more ways to protect themselves and to dull the consciousness of a god that was above it all we're not going to read all of genesis 5 but we'll make reference to it genesis chapter 5 gives us the lineage of adam giving us the lin these are the generations of adam that's kind of walking us through what these these generations as he in the day that he created the heavens and the earth and these are the generations and it talks about how long seth lived and how each one lived and we could follow all these descendants of enos and canaan and all the way down to uh to lamech to noah and we come to noah and that's where genesis chapter 5 ends is with noah and it says this in genesis chapter 6 verses 1 to 3. it says and it came to pass when men began to multiply in the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be 120 years i'm not saying it is but could it be no one lives above 120 really when you look at how many in the last 200 years that they can keep track of how long people are living one person has lived i believe above 120 lived 122 years old and and maybe so maybe it's a little bit of a soft ceiling there but god's base said hey you know what you could pretty much fix it there's going to come a time where man's not going to be living much beyond 120. and now he's saying this in a very very heavy words let's just start with verse 3. he says my spirit shall not always strive with man god is declaring that the entirety of mankind has become severed from him my spirit shall not always strive with men it's it's implying that maybe god's spirit is dealing with man but man is no longer dealing with god man has no longer opened himself up to god's spirit dealing with him this is what cain ran from he ran from the presence of the lord he built cities and encampments and they devised inventions and distractions and everything to do what to keep the spirit of god from striving with them so god is saying man is closing himself off from me so that my spirit cannot deal with him i will not always be striving with man for that he also is flesh that's a very very heavy word if you think about it because wouldn't we just say haven't they always been haven't they always been flesh but mankind had so lost focus of the promise he says my spirit will not always strive with men they lost focus of the promise and now he's saying he is flesh he no longer has an infinity or a connection to god even within his flesh there's been something that has taken place where he's become corrupted he's become degraded he has entirely lost the image that adam had in the beginning the image that adam even retained that he passed down to his sons it says in genesis 5 3 and adam lived 130 years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name seth verse 1 it told us that adam was made in the likeness of god so whatever adam had he passed to his descendants so as adam as having children this image that still remained within mankind is being passed that's why when you get to enos the great grandson the grandson of of of adam he's he's calling upon god and these sons that come down the sons of god the sons of adam they're still caught upon god seventh generation still calling upon god taken away in a rapture why they're connected to the promise there's been something passed down there's something there's a nurture by the words that adam's using to deal with that nature that adam had imparted to his children where they could walk in a way that was pleasing to god they were willing to seek after god they are willing to have his spirit strive with them josephus wrote this it is said of seth and his posterity that they were very good and virtuous and very happy without any considerable misfortunes for seven generations it was said of seth and his children that they were very good they were very virtuous they lived very happy lives and they did not suffer calamities did not suffer misfortunes and they did so for seven generations but how does genesis chapter six open up it opens up by describing how the sons of adam begin to mix with the lineage of cain the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair the sons of adam began to see the women that were born into the lineage of cain and they begin to say these are very beautiful women they begin to see what cain's seed had to offer they began to see this other civilization that was sprouting up around him there's other people that were coming in close to him and verse two describes how the godly descendants of seth intermarried with the ungodly descendants of cain and what began to happen as the line of seth begin to marry with the line of cain immorality increases violence increases witness wickedness increases that's exponentially increasing why because man no longer has it within his nature to hinder this wickedness that's being sown into his flesh so by the time you get to verse 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually now all of society is corrupt wickedness had increased to the point where now all of humanity is united in desire they're united in the pursuit of ungodly things god looks at mankind all of humanity and he says they are only imagining evil they're not thinking about the promise they've completely forgot about what adam's been trying to say all these years that i made a promise in genesis 3. god they've forgotten the symbolism of the sacrifice in the garden they've forgotten the symbolism and what abel's blood was speaking they've gotten so far away from that as the intermarrying they begin to mix with the line of cane that now this this habit of cain is sown into the flesh of all mankind where they're living apart from the promise they're holy wicked they're holy corrupt and god's assessment of them is it so great that every imagination in every in other words all of them if they have a billion thoughts he's saying they're all evil what faith is missing faith was lacking this this variance of cain in the beginning one step away from faith what does it result in there's a absence of any no acknowledgement of god there's an absence of any consciousness of god it's only evil continuing and now all of humanity is united in this pursuit of ungodly things and what are they able to accomplish civilization science technologies even the building of the pyramids and things that they say even now would be a technologically a challenge to do and the perfection of those things and their alignment and how that it's done even with respect to the stars and every that the things that man was accomplished in the days of nowhere far beyond what we could even grasp what was able they were able to do at that time because man had let loose of his faith in god and given himself over completely to the flesh to the point where god says i'm going to destroy all mankind i'm going to wipe them all off the face of the earth now if someone had said well pre-adventure god if you could just find 15 righteous would you save it god would say i don't think you're listening to me buddy there's not 15. well what if you could find 10 hey sorry i know there's not 10. the bible says in genesis 6 11 to 12 the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth this was man's doing this is the doing of those men who once called upon god and even josephus and some of the jewish historians say it was right about this time in adam's lineage that certain sons began to cross over and begin to marry with the children of with cain and as they began to do it it deluded their convictions it deluded their consciousness of a promise it brought them more into civilization it brought them more into the ways of cain it brought them more into being flesh to when god says all man is flesh he's saying they're no longer adam like they're cane-like they're no longer perfect to adam they have this mixed blood this hybrid blood with the blood of cain and because they're mixed blood and hybrid they're all completely corrupt the whole earth is caught the earth is filled with violence because of him and he says this all flesh has corrupted his way upon earth this was man's doing he's also wondered after cain's wondering he's now consumed with the same sins of cain and listen how jesus says in luke chapter 17 verses 26 to 30 and as it was in the days of noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man so god is going to call out the days of noah hit them where it hurts god go ahead get them tell us what they were doing all their wicked violence god said they were every imagination of their thoughts were evil continually the whole earth was corrupt the earth was filled with violence tell us jesus tell us about their violence they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage wait hold on no no i want i want to get the dirt come on tell me give give me the give me the real give me the real rumors i want to hear i want to hear it raw and unfiltered that's what we want these days just wrong until just tell me the truth i can handle it tell me everything they were doing and jesus basically no that's that's where the sin was the sin wasn't in the violence the sin wasn't in the murder the sin was in all the other things but the sin first originated in what they're doing here they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot wherein god abraham pleaded lord if you could just find 15 righteous will you spare it and he couldn't find it so today when we talk about sodom and gomorrah and we use phrases to describe certain acts that are related to the sodom and these this awful filthy perverted horrible cities as described in the bible here's jesus opportunity to give it to us in the new testament raw unfiltered really get down to really what was wrong tell me what it was it was the it was their relationships their physical relations right that's what made them awful and filthy and that's what made him putrid in the eyes of god so jesus is going to tell us the real dirt they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded i don't know if anybody planted or built it today but you may have eaten you may have drank you may have bought might have been sold thank you ebay offer up craigslist whatever you might have done a little transaction this morning maybe you're in amazon marketplace that's great probably gotten getting ripped off but you got to have a lot of volume let's just say that but think about it just describing what we do every day it's just sunday and we've already eaten we've already drank some people are getting married tomorrow others are gonna buy and sell and plant and build but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed i want you to recognize that jesus when he wants to call out the depravity of the days of noah the depravity of the days of lord he rever he's pointing out their lifestyle of consumption he's identifying that they had a certain way of satisfying themselves that satisfaction was a way of life synthetizing the flesh was the way of life and what's more amazing is jesus doesn't make mention of the evil that we think he should mention because the evil isn't what was lacking they had no faith in god that was the evil jesus that's all they did and even if they never did anything else as cain they if they would have just been farmers but if they lacked faith that is displeasing to god that was the evil look at the accumulation of evil through seven generations by the time you get to genesis chapter six man is holy evil what because they left off believing in god and if it can happen over thousands of years to the point where you get over 2 000 years to where we get to genesis chapter 6 and you can see this kind of accumulation of sin and this evil that would accumulate to this point to where mankind is holy evil you think well good thing i'm only going to live about 120 years no this can accumulate by minute by a day by hour by day by week by month by year in our own personal lives jesus didn't mention the adultery the fornication the sexual perversions and all these other things the murder and the evil continually and all those different things because the evil was merely in what was lacking they did not have faith in god see it wasn't even a divided pursuit it wasn't like man was calling upon god and wrestling with sin and calling upon god in wrestling with the temptations of cain's seed and calling upon god and really wanting to hang out with tubal cain's daughter it wasn't like that they weren't even thinking about right what was righteous anymore they weren't even divided in their pursuits mankind had become holy flesh by their own doing by mixing themselves with the world they didn't even look for genesis 3 15. if you would even went up to one of them said did you know that god promised to send us a help that god was gonna god's gonna send a man one day a man born of a woman and it's gonna crush is gonna remin change all this and take out this evilness and this adultery and this polygamy and all this nasty stuff and they say where did you get that from yeah well which god which god are you talking about oh well that's just mythology and we've been inventing these stories listen man these are just stories we've come up with that we could talk about when we get high you know your great-great-great uncle ate something really crazy one day and shared these stories and now we're still telling them all these many years later it was nothing to them anymore genesis chapter 7 verse 1. in the middle of all this had there not been one god would have destroyed the whole earth it seems in genesis chapter 7 verse 1 and the lord said unto noah come down all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation in other words noah only in you you're the only one in all the earth do i see righteousness not even in his wife not in his sons he says only in thee have i seen righteous before me in these generations if you see in genesis chapter 6 verse 9 these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god he descended perfectly from seth he's perfect in his generations there's no unrighteous image in within him when he says he's perfect in his generations that means noah can be traced all the way back to adam and you won't find any seed of cain being mixed in that's exactly what the bible's saying he is a just man perfect in his generations he can say i am a son of adam i am a son of righteousness i am a son of god i go all the way back to adam he descended perfectly from seth who descended from adam there's no cane mixed in him there's none of the hybrid blood mix in him and he can say that he is perfect in his generations and that's why god said he was a just man he says in thee only have i seen righteousness in all the generations canoa because noah could still hear adam tell them about the promise noah still sought god noah still believed in god and there's many that speculate that noah recognized and realized that he was the only one left on the earth who had not mixed himself with the blood of cain's seed and that's why he waited so late in life to even get married because he married very very very late in life for a man i mean like something like 19 years old right now i mean they're talking about hundreds of years old before he ever gets married which was rare for them in those days and some speculate perhaps noah was just he did not see a virtuous woman he did not see a woman he would like to marry there was none left think about how sad of a day it would be if there was no daughters of adam left to marry he says he was a just man we know the just live by faith it says in hebrews 11 7 by faith noah being warned of god are things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark for the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became the heir of righteousness which is by faith so however many millions and billions of people that you could estimate there were upon the face of the earth there was one man who remained righteous god himself said there's one man in thee have i seen righteousness before me and you alone you're the only one that's perfect in your generations you're the only one who still remains yet who has not mixed himself with the ungodly seed you're the only one left still upon earth who calls upon me who worships me who still thinks of the promise and as you imagine genesis chapter six just think of how far it had fallen from a shepherd and a farmer and just two chapters and really genesis chapter five is just kind of trying to give us background to how we get to noah but god's whole point is you went from abel who who tended the sheep and cain who tilled the ground and essentially the very next time he begins to describe the actions of man it's genesis chapter six genesis chapter 4 to genesis chapter 6 look at how far had fallen the passing of time increased the complications increased the chaos and what caused it the ghost of the original sin still haunting humanity not content to seek god not content to rest in his promises not content to keep his word they had to devise other ways to make sense of the world mythology religion science all the things that have been the disciplines that we even enjoyed the fruit of today many of them in their genesis were ways to number one protect themselves against the fears and the concerns that mankind has because of cain's actions in genesis 4 and also to silence the conviction to rationalize with eternity to try to figure out why we're all here instead of just taking god at his word the word that would have survived the garden by adam teaching these children for hundreds of years telling his grandson his grandson his great-grandson his great-great-grandson sharing with him this is what god said this is what the word of god says and they would have had something to live by how else do you have a man of such integrity such as job if there was an opportunity to live simply before god though he was a man of great means a man of many friends and a man of many children and he had a lot of wealth but yet he had this conviction in his heart to serve god and even pre-adventure that his children may be sinning he offered up sacrifice on their behalf what was he doing he was acknowledging that god there is going to be a provided way god i can in the midst of commerce and community and civilization and science and friendship and all these religions i'm still holding fast my integrity that what you say is truth what you do is just that you made a promise in one day oh god one day i will stand upon the earth with my deliverer day i will see my redeemer what was he quoting from genesis 3 who was he quoting adam what was he quoting by faith but this ghost of the original sin drives mankind to the place toward genesis chapter 11 they say hey let's go make brick this is after the flood now i need to do this very quickly very very very very very very very very very very very quickly let's go make brick let's burn them they come up a way where they had invented these kilns to to harden to make it even harder he says we'll use this uh brick for stone and slime from order they were inventive and genius they're already getting back in the groove again and how they can build and they say go two verse four let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name out of pride out of selfish ambition they want to erect a monument to glorify themselves not god cain built an altar to glorify god it was altered though he was sincere in his worship he was sincerely wrong and god said cain if you do well will you not be accepted cain at least built it to glorify god now mankind is so severely deluded they want to build a monument a million times bigger and exponentially than what cain offered but now it's not to glorify god but it's to defy god glorify themselves not god they said lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth they were united to build a city to make a name for themselves and keep themselves from being scattered and josephus says it was done in disobedience to god's command to replenish the earth god wants us to disperse god told noah to multiply and replenish and the thought behind what noah was telling his sons and telling his children disperse replenish go go out don't do like kane did go replenish the whole earth branch out expand go expand and they said no instead of we're not going to go in defiance to the word in defiance to the message that god had given noah they said no in disobedience to his command and in absence to god we're going to defeat his will let's build a tower so it can just keep spiraling higher and higher and higher so that we don't even have to branch out just build a city that reaches into heaven we'll see if he wants to flood the earth let's see how high he can get the water next time so we'll build a spiral into heaven and it says in verse 5 and the lord came down to see the city and the tower when the children of men they're all flesh now they're the sons of adam they're the children of men he said all flesh has become corrupted man is corrupted his way completely corrupt his weather now it's the children of men not sons of god and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do why because they've given themselves over to the flesh and they're not thinking about the promise so he says let's go down verse seven go to let us go down there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the lord scattered them abroad from fence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city this is the condition of humanity as it disperses throughout the world no matter where we find them later hundreds of years later thousands of years later no matter where we find them we could say at one point they were all gathered around this tower of babel united in one purpose to defeat the will of god united in one purpose to to offend god to not do as his word said and now with this in their hearts and god recognized they're united still yet in this purpose look we're in genesis chapter 11. we're like wait when did the flood happen is that in another book how could we go from genesis chapter 11 where they're just getting off the boat just just getting off it would be like if you try to imagine it leaving leaving america living in the this first world and all that it has and getting on a boat and then everything being destroyed that's in america and then you arrive on another place where there's nothing there and then just a few short years it's already back the way it was before it's like didn't we reset it's like when you have your house cleaned you know when you get your house cleaned by somebody you clean it for them before they clean it that's just what you do you hire a house cleaner to put pressure on you to clean your house i love how that works i think but then once it's clean how long does it even last it's like did we did we just cleaned the house i thought we cleaned the garage yesterday yeah we did oh what happened this is the nature of man how quickly it was deluded and the part the part i guess i want to drive home but i'm not going to have time to do it now god just confounded the complication someone's going to make you all speak different languages now now mankind can even communicate to each other but why did god do it because man's continued arrogance continued defiance of the promise continued disregard of the promise and he melod humanity fell to this depraved state by continually leaving the one thing necessary by continually forsaking it the one that found righteousness the one that found deliverance the only one that found it and then because of that his household was noah who still was connected to the promise that's why even in ezekiel later on it says you know what god says i'm going to curse this land i'm going to destroy this land he says even if daniel enoch and and i came in noah even if these those three lived in the land i'd still destroy all of it and the only way that daniel enoch can know it be saved is because of their own righteousness that's exactly what it came down to is that there was only one righteous in all the world they had left off the one thing necessary to there was only one man who believed in the promise and if you want to just quickly let's just i want to do this very very fast in romans chapter 1 because this is where all humanity stops this is where this is where all of humanity is painted with this color painted with this brush we can all say that we descended from the tower of bow but we were all there represented before that that edifice we were all represented there in whatever nationality whatever language what ethnicity wherever we we dispersed upon the face of the earth we came from this place of confusion disobedience and rebellion against god the bible says the wrath of god romans chapter 1 i want to read verses 18 to 32. i'm i'm instead of asking for permission i'll just apologize later for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men i want to read this as god's assessment of humanity in genesis chapter 11. i want you to recognize that it's a perfect assessment of where we are today and it's a perfect assessment at the time that paul is obviously writing this that the wrath of god is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which way that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god has shown it unto them now think about cain sin in light of the way paul writes he is describing the sin of cain the similarity of cain for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even as eternal power in godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god think about man when they still were connected to some sense and idea of god but still refused to worship him so that they're so it neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made light to corruptable man there's your mixing of a righteous seed the mixing of the sons of adam with those of the sons of cain and to birds into four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever amen so we could see that in man's sin to worship the creation instead of the creator it types and exemplifies how mankind became became all flesh and was deluding themselves as they try to make god merely a man make him a bird make him a beast make him a creeping thing how did this happen it didn't happen with seth the further away you got from the image of god that's when man fell to these things and likewise this god gods gave them up to vile affections for even their women to change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned and they're lost one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their air which was meat and it doesn't need any interpretation or does it i won't interpret it and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetous maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whispers backpackers haters of god despiteful proud bolsters inventor of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do they do the same not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them this is a perfect synopsis of humanity in genesis chapter 11. this describes what happens in genesis 3 to genesis 11. each one of these things we read in these several verses have their genesis and are born from genesis 3 and they come forward and they manifest they come to their perfection by the time we get to genesis 11 even though god had wiped the face of the earth off and just left it with noah his wife and the three sons and their wives but yet mankind it's in them and he describes everything that humanity is this is all it's 11 55. it's this is all humanity every single one of them none exempt there's not even a noah anymore there's none that's perfect in their generations there's none that are up there's not a job there's not a noah there's not a set there's not an enoch there's none left upon the face the earth man is totally completely and as the word would be used in the bible it would be used for gentiles which means nations or people the entire earth is spread over of nations and all of them are heathens all of them are worshiping the gods of their imagination all of them are living evil all of them are speaking different languages and they're they're pursuing different pursuits they're establishing different kingdoms and they're advancing themselves in certain technologies in certain ways of life and they're and they're good at this and they're good at that and they're spread over whole the whole earth every single one of them reprobate heathen godless wicked vile filthy and we're just in the 11th chapter of the bible genesis chapter 12 verse 1. now the lord said unto abram when you read that you should say well what what just happened god spoke to one man in the midst of all the millions of people in the face of the earth god spoke unto abram because was it because he was righteous no was it because he was doing something right no was it because he maintained an altar like that abel had did he find the original place of the sacrifice did he by revelation know exactly what to do and how to live and how to continue sacrifice no he was building groves just like his father's he was worshiping false gods just like everybody else was on earth that's why the god we serve today is called the god of abraham because nobody else knew who he was until this moment of grace he made himself known to one man named abram he says the lord god said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and i'll make thy name great he's going to do it now jesus 11 let us make us a name let us be great but i will bless thee and i'll make thy name great thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed god is reviving genesis 3 15. god said i made a promise that there would be a deliverer i made a promise that there would be a redeemer i made a promise that there would be one come one day that would save you from your sins and even though there's not anybody left on the face of the earth that remembers that promise i will by election choose one not because he's better not because he has better blood not because he has better lineage every single one share the same lineage back all came from that tower of babel here he says god gives abraham a promise and he says i will i will i will i will i will i will i will and what did abraham have to do just choose to serve his will choose to accept his will he didn't leave saying i will i was like your will be done your will your will your will god gave abraham a promise now abraham's life is different than all the others he has a different purpose beyond the depravity of the flesh the fallen creation everything around him now just like adam he has a promise that there's going to be a seed come there's going to be one come and what does the bible say by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed hebrews 11 8-10 by faith abraham obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went now that sounds a lot like cain except abraham had a promise cain didn't so cain could only go into the land of god because he didn't know where he was going and he didn't have any place he was trying to find that's why it's a true saying if you don't know where you're going any road will get you there and that's the way that cain was taken but abraham's not with the promise because by faith he doesn't know where he's going but he knows there's some place he's getting he knows there's something ultimately by faith he's so adjourned in the land of promises in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs of with him in the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is god he though he wandered around and not knowing where he went he wasn't just a wonder he had a promise which was his foundation he had the promise which was his guide he knew that god had made a promise and that was what he was living for he sought something eternal something permanent something that had real value and this is where humanity's last divided in the old testament this is the last division you read of genesis chapter 12 because now in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and you have one man and one woman that one man and one woman fall and they bring forth twins bring forth a farmer and a shepherd and the the farmer kills the shepherd and then the farmer runs out and creates a civilization in a world in his own seed in his family and they grow in evil and evil and evil and then it begins to mix and combine with the sons of adam and it climaxes in genesis chapter 6 where all the world is evil and filthy and corrupt so god judges the world and brings noah out through on the other side of the flood but that same nature comes in in the flood through the marriage of the wives they come back and in genesis chapter 11 it's all just filthy and ungodless and everyone's a heathen and everyone's a reprobate and now god says i'm like one final division and from this point on genesis chapter 12 the rest of the old testament's gonna be the story of one man and his children because i promised in genesis 3 that i would bring a seat of a woman and he never forgot that and god had never left off in making that promise and to this day it's that seed of that woman that if you believe in today makes life worth living the only one that makes sense of this world it's the only one that makes sense of this life and this is where god divides all of humanity because now you have abraham in his lineage and the rest everyone else what are they called gentiles abraham was one too until god called him what did god give them the sign of circumcision what did they begin to identify themselves as the children of god they had a promise that they were identified by even to this day israelites a nation why are they called israelites because they descend from israel by election from abraham from isaac this is this is god carving out a people and the rest are called gentiles though cain's sin had overwhelmed all of humanity and all of mankind god re-establishes his promise with man if musicians would come jesus says about those who worry about what they're going to eat what they're going to drink and what they're going to wear what does he say that's what the gentiles seek that's what that's the difference between the children of abraham and everyone else the children of abraham believed in what the promise that's what they were marked by that's what they live for that's what they long for it the promise that god had made the gentiles they're only worried about what am i going to eat what am i going to wear where am i going to sleep that's all they're worried about and even paul said don't live as the gentiles live in the vanity of their mind because they live in the living in the vanity of their mind all they ever do is they try to satisfy their lust and their desires and their hungerings and because they do that they just work all uncleanness with greediness what is is the inability to know what is necessary the inability to keep the main thing the main thing the inability to know what is sufficient it's the lack of contentment and simplicity jesus said hey the gentiles are only worried about that stuff paul is saying the gentiles are only worried about what they're going to eat and what they're going to dress and what how they're going to look and how they're going to wear where they're going to sleep and how they're what the kind of car they're going to drive and all the consumerism and all the consumption and they're basically jesus is saying but we've got to have a promise there's got to be something you're living by there's got to be something you're looking for are you only looking at your paycheck and what it can buy you're only looking at your retirement you're only watching the stock market are you only worried about all the other things are you tethered to everything else in this world that sensitizes the five senses of your spirit and the five senses of your flesh or is there something deep down on the inside of you that by faith there's one thing necessary god made a promise and man today as we can see it in genesis chapter 4 he's become the mastermind of his own chaos why because he doesn't know how to discern what is necessary cain in a moment in one moment had a choice there's one thing necessary cain faith and he could have said god give me that faith i lack it but instead he chose jealousy the inability to discern what is necessary mankind left off the one thing that is necessary faith in god believing his word living for a promise and that's where i've took taking a long time just to say this to get real practical this is where simplicity begins have faith in god simplicity begins in a promise of god and he said what is that what does that even mean take a promise of god and put your faith in it that's where simplicity begins wherever you are today there's some that need to be baptized with the holy ghost there's some that need real repentance there's some that need god to deliver them from things wherever you are whatever walk point you are in your life right now take a promise and put your faith in it and that's the simplicity we got to get back to what are we doing it all for anyways is there some is there something connected to it or are there things in our lives if we begin to take this this this faith in our heart and this conviction our heart that there's one thing necessary and come back to simply believing god and taking god at his word and living for a promise is there a way that that promise can begin to loom so large in our lives that there's things outside and that deal with our hearts and deal with our minds and in cumbersome things that we pursue that we begin to realize wait a minute this doesn't bring peace this doesn't satisfy this has nothing to do with this and then we can begin to simplify our lives in light of the fact that i'm living for a promise and i'm taking god at his word and i'm believing you take a promise of god any promise of god and so that i won't vary from it i'll stay with it you made me a promise even the promise of long hair you take a promise of gone and say lord i believe in that i was asked a very difficult question recently someone facing treatment where they would lose their hair and they were told you know if you do this you're going to lose your hair and it created this conflict things began got complicated real fast for this sister while she's growing her hair out for decades and decades as a testament to god as her glory in obedience to the word and now she's being told by those that care for her health saying you might want to cut your hair before it falls out now do you realize it gets complicated and why because science because at one time you just would have you wouldn't there wouldn't even been cancer right thanks hybrid foods thanks fear but now there's diseases and because of science there's certain diseases but science tries to remedy the disease so now there's treatment for that cancer and now but the fallout of that is the falling out of your hair now what do i do there's nothing else you can do just believe god's word take him at his word the same word that you believe that he says by my stripes you're healed and you're believing that you're going to be delivered that cancer is the same faith you put in that promise it says the bible teaches me that my long hair is a glory so god preserve this keep it strong let it grow for your glory lord let it be healthy for your glory and you take god at his word and you take a promise and you're simple towards the word of god and you let everything else fade away you remove the promise all you have is vanity you remove the promise all you have is chaos and complication take away the promise life doesn't make sense anymore can i give you a promise promise that we could all point to it's 1207 isaiah chapter 32 verses 17 to 18. and the work of righteousness shall be peace this is what mankind lost in genesis chapter four this began to lose there was a time when enos was calling upon the name of the lord what did he have peace peace and the promise do you know when it's going to come enos no but i know he made it do you know what's going to look like no but i know he made it what is it going to be it's going to be what destroys what this serpent has caused it can be thing that deliberate delivers humanity he says but a work of righteous shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever and my peace and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and ensure dwellings and in quiet resting places are you his people are you his person today are you his son or his daughter then this is a promise to dwell in a peaceable habitation to live in a sure dwelling to have a quiet resting place you can make this a promise you can make this scripture right here a promise and measure all pursuits and all possessions by this lord you made me a promise to have a peaceable habitation one that's not disturbed one that's not alarmed a place of there's no fighting there's no struggle there's no strife it's not a place of enemies lord you made me that promise i'd have a peaceable habitation you said i'd have a secure dwell and a sure drawing someplace secure confident a place where there's provision a place where there's no worry and a quiet resting place not just a place of labor and vanity but a place i can rest this is the existence that god could give his children today that regardless of whether you live in a basement suite or apartment or a house or wherever you might dwell you can find yourself having a peaceable habitation a sure dwelling and quiet resting places why because he made the promise and you put your faith towards it and then you measure everything else by that promise there's promises of god today if you took that promise and you let have preeminence you say lord this is what i'm believing for then there's other things in your life that say listen this just complicates the simple promise that he said i could have this if i would put my faith towards it and everything else is keeping me from this and you can start making decisions that simplify your life why you get back to simply believing him taking god at his word it's going back to the beginning simplicity by faith and living i just want to live by faith if that's where cain sinned is one step away from faith then i know today being a being a man of flesh and being one that cannot brag as noah did that my generations are perfect then i know there's a place that i can go it's the place that cain ran from i know there's something i can hear is the voice that came disregarded and right now in the middle of a crazy crazy world we can find peace let's stand to our feet let's pray for peace today that may be what you were asking for this morning it could be what you notice is missing in your life that that no worry no strife let's pray for that today our gracious heavenly father lord we learned a lesson from abel's blood that's still speaking that if we act apart from faith it's our conscience that condemns us when we're not doing those things that we know please you even if it would not be technically or lawfully a sin our own conscience condemns us because how could we as sons and daughters of god ever find sure footing if we're not sure we're standing on what you said was right your bible being true it teaches us that without faith it is impossible to please you then my ambition lord is solely to please you therefore i must live by faith if noah in genesis chapter 6 was the only one that you saw righteous in because he was a just man and you teach us that the just live by faith then i'm instructed by your word that it's not a matter of me trying to clean up straighten up fess up figure it all out get clean get right get holy get saved so to speak and then live a good clean life for a few years hoping that you accept me because of my good works but i can lord hear your voice right now right now speaking to my heart and as cain ran from it i can't like abraham walk into it and i said lord you're speaking to me and i just i'm gonna lean into this lord i'm gonna yield to it i don't know where it's taken me but i'm walking into this now lord i don't know much more than what you just said you called me by name abram get up separate come walk with me where are we going i'll show you okay let's go lord i choose to live by the faith of abraham today to follow you with all my heart i pray for those that experiencing great tragedy father and dilemmas in their hearts not knowing which way to go and what to do i pray lord you give them this peace that the effect of righteousness [Music] is peace what is righteousness living by faith not my own works but just doing what you said lord if it's quicken in my heart you must make this decision you must go this way you must do this thing lord regardless of the cost regardless of the consequences regardless of what it might mean to this flesh and to my uh my position to my status all these other things lord i can only find a peaceable habitation i can only find a sure dwelling i can only find a quiet resting place in your will let me come back to the beginning lord that thing that cain left the thing that the woman left and let me come back to simply taking you at your word and believe in you in the midst of chaos in the midst of complication the midst of a booming stock market a booming housing market a midst of thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of jobs in millions of people and hundreds of thousands of religions in 10 000 ways to worship jesus lord i can just simply say right now i'm gonna walk by faith and serve you and like abraham i give myself to you and let me be the son of god and the daughter of god that pleases you lord for brother ian today as he takes a step to water baptism lord you've been dealing with this heart for a year or so and what else could it be that stirs up within a ten-year-old's heart wells up within him and says i want to give my heart to god now i want to be baptized now it's the same god that spoke to abram in genesis 12. the same god that spoke in the beginning and created the heavens and earth and lord may it be that reality for every single one of us who are standing in your divine presence today that is the faith of abraham to take you from that very simple moment that you would speak to a child's heart and he would say here i am lord may we like why you say here we are we choose to believe you we choose to walk in faith we used to we choose to live by faith receive us now i pray and may we live simple towards your promise in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
