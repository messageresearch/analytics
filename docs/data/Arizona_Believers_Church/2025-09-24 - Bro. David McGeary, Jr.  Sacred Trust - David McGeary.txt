TRANSCRIPT
========================================
turn in our Bibles 1 Corinthians uh chapter 11 and verse 1. And before we get started, I you know, we count this a privilege, your pastor, our brother, as he's away, he sends his love and greetings. I think that goes unspoken, though. Um but he did want us to be careful to mention that. And I know there's uh our church back home in in Texas is also sends their love and greetings. represent the body there and and bring those as well. Let's just read. It's going to be a short reading. We'll have you be seated. 1 Corinthians 11 and verse one. Be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ. I just ask the Lord to bless the word and you be seated. And just in this reading, I think there's a lot that could be conveyed. And it's to us as believers to recognize this is a pattern that we uh each would have in our own lives that we would believe that we can say to others that we're following after Christ. And as we follow after Christ, we would want to be an example. We would want to we would want to be uh aware that as we reflect him to others, that is a gospel that's written. your your written epistles read of all men that you are uh you have this authority of the word where you could say follow me as I follow Christ and I would say in this even in no other age can we understand that we have the privilege of knowing the very heartbeat the very mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and we should absolutely have a confidence in what uh we're representing and and to that just to keep a subject and maybe to to follow along and keep myself along the thought. But you pull on the word. I believe we can minister to however the Lord would. But it's a sacred trust. So if I I was going to give this a title, I'd say you have a sacred trust. There's been something given to you that you have the ability to impart eternal life and also you've been it is God's very heart intent to reflect his image in you. So that that is a that is a sacred trust. You're a bedding ground. You're you're something that's going to reflect an image. &gt;&gt; And uh we just want to fellowship along that thought as we would uh if you would turn in Proverbs those who will do it uh in a way maybe we give you a chance to turn. Proverbs uh chapter 18 verse 20 speaks of this uh if you will responsibility death and life are in the power of the tongue 18:21 and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. So it in your words is the power of death in life. the the very things you say the the and profess the things you put on your lip have the power to impart death and impart life. This is not a just to lay a foundation. This is not something that is is uh should be foreign to us. This should be the confidence really that we have in why we would even say you know be still. If you don't know what to say just be still. uh guard your heart, guard your tongue, guard your heart because it is from the heart, right? The that the mouth speaketh. So we don't want to just think that idle words have power. It is really the things that have gone to seed in our hearts that's going to come up from our belly and out of our mouths. And it has life in it. &gt;&gt; It's it's when you speak from experience that you know that it means something. You know, when you say, "I know God's a healer," that in itself has power in it. &gt;&gt; The testimony of the tongue and what you say that you know God to be a is really what you're responsible to. &gt;&gt; And as you're faithful in little, God will add, but be faithful to the little that you know. &gt;&gt; You know God to be real. &gt;&gt; And you can testify to that portion of it. And it is in the testifying that you are fulfilling that sacred trust. As just as much as Adam was given the commandment to go and to tend to the land and to till it, you have the same authority. God wants to see you as little messiahes going out into the world that you've been given tending to those things. When you see weeds coming up, you have the authority to rebuke the weed, to prune the weed in your life, in your own life, and in your the atmosphere, the dominion in the kingdom of God. That's yours. Mark 16:15 would say it like this. This is the great commission. This is this is the authority really that uh establishes us and what we're doing. Uh it would read, "And he said unto them, go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned." So it is in the preaching, it is in the ministering, it is in the giving of the words of life that it could be accepted or rejected. &gt;&gt; You know, it it would do no good to hide your light underneath a bushel. I know this is basic Christianity, but I I want you to understand that it is the uh we've been paralyzed by the scarecrow. We're not handing out denominational belieism. I just believe I'm not trying to convince you of the way I believe, but I'm imparting life. And if we understand what we possess, that we're possessing the very life, the very salvation, the very thing people need to make it, we would be more convinced and concerned. &gt;&gt; You if you do not share what you have, then people are hopeless. &gt;&gt; They're lost. And it's in the manner of living. It's not just in word only because it wasn't that the people would just believe, but and these signs shall follow them that believe. So in your heart, you're converted. You believe. You know these things to be true. And you're testifying to you knowing a risen savior, someone who's changed your life. In my name, they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents and they shall drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. That is not a God of the pulpit only. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. That's the authority the word is is is brought in and that is here. But that is to the individual. &gt;&gt; You have that authority that it's given to you to minister life. &gt;&gt; And when you see the enemy come in, we've been given dominion. Out of all the ages that anybody wanted to live in, it is this age. &gt;&gt; God wants to move through his word and prove it to be true to a lost and dying world. &gt;&gt; How great the darkness. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If we were to just even sit here and look at the millions of people groping in darkness, you possess the very way of salvation, of deliverance from the things that would bind. I I'm and I'm telling you, there's nothing too hard for our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That Satan hasn't managed to con concoct any atmosphere, any imagination, any reasoning, any uh anything that God doesn't know how to find the individual. because he's a a good shepherd that'll leave the 99 and seek the one. &gt;&gt; You may think that you can imagine your way into a place and you're just waiting to get there as soon as church is over. I'm going to go see what my friend's done here and I'm going to go play my game here and I'm going to join the chat and this game and I just can't wait to get there. He knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly where. You can't create a little world and go live on it that he can't find you. &gt;&gt; Because David would say, "Though I make my bed in hell, &gt;&gt; thou art there." So, you could be in the very pits of of Satan's snare, and my God knows how to bring you out. &gt;&gt; I'm here to witness that. I know that to be true for myself. He's a he he's a a loving shepherd. So as we look at this, it is in the partaking of the divine nature that you have something to give. But it's also because of that that Satan will do everything he can do to keep you from doing just that. And we're not naive to these things because we've seen his tactics in this day. It's exposed. We see the son of predition. The same way he deals with the church, he deals with the individual. We know how in each age he came against the church and those same tactics he will use against you &gt;&gt; as the individual. So you want to be aware of the enemy. this message through God's prophet tells us Satan and his in his tactics and reading in in Philippians I I want to impress this this Philippians 1:27 only let your conversation at it as it becometh the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I might hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together in the faith of the gospel Isn't that a beautiful picture of the body of Christ? This this conversation isn't just a measure of words. This isn't something that David, I've only managed to say I I stayed out of the news. I didn't discuss the latest political uh topics, but I've only managed to talk about the things of God. That's not just the conversation that's being spoken of here, but this is your manner of living, the things that you do, how you handle things. That's the greatest testimony. What what you got to be aware of is when the when the opportunity comes to react badly because every excuse has been given to you. The person's done you wrong. You you need better service. The the food was cold. And and I find this true in my own life. the the very times where it feels like sometimes I just almost come short is really when it was the greatest opportunity to live a testimony. &gt;&gt; The food being cold really wasn't that important. I could have recognized what the right response could have been to those around me. &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to be aware of. It's our when I say conversation, how do we handle just the daytoday things? &gt;&gt; That's your mannerisms. That's your conversation. That's your pattern of good works. That's waking up in the morning and putting God first. Those are the things that people see. And we want to establish as uh a pattern of good works or a conversation. That's a manner of living. The amplified would read it like this. Only be sure as citizens so to conduct yourselves that your manner of life will be worthy of the good news, the gospel of Christ, so that whether I do come and see you or am absent may hear this of you. So it is uh it is how others see you that we want to be aware of &gt;&gt; because we want them to inquire what is the hope? Why are you different? Why do you not do the things others do? Why do you not look at that? I've noticed you're different. You turn your head. That's a testimony. That's something that people notice. But what is that? That's now a door. That's that you your your manner of living and your conduct as simple as it was proc was salty enough to portray Christ. But now you can witness what the hope of your calling is. &gt;&gt; So it's that's the and what I mean by that is so many times we take the power of the gospel and we we want to just leave it to the fin the the the the fantastic things the raising of the dead the healing of cancer and those things we do &gt;&gt; but I would say just as much a miracle is you living an overcoming victorious Christian life. That's the true power of the gospel that many deny because many come to him in that day and say, "Have I not? Have I not? Have I not?" And he says, "I never knew you." What did they really do at the end of the day? They denied the Christ. They denied the power of God to live an overcoming, victorious life. Because it's not just about miracles. It's about putting Jesus Christ on display every day. &gt;&gt; This is out of the there's one way provided, God's provided way. It says God's word is the seed. Jesus said that the word of God was a seed that is the swer swed. This is the only seed that will produce eternal life. Now we can have all other kinds of lives. Church life, home life, family life, national life, but the only eternal life comes through God's word. That's the only seed that can produce eternal life. And I want to tell you, there's many people living different lives. The life testifies to it. They're caught up with their job. They're living a work life. That's simply what they have. They come home and they testify my work. &gt;&gt; It was work. It was work. It was work. My work is the reason I live the life I live. They It's politics. It's it's, you know, America first. We got to do better. And their life testifies. That's the life that they're living. They're living a life. And it testifies by the things that they care about, the things that they do. Well, how much more as the bride of Christ do we live the life of Christ, the victory that he's given us, the joy in knowing that we're where we're going. And I want to remind you, we're not staying here. This isn't the life we're living for. &gt;&gt; Everything that he's promised us, we're is is beyond this temporal reality. &gt;&gt; That's the testimony we have. If we don't portray that and we are not showing that reality to be real and the and the strength in knowing that is the joy of your salvation. Satan wants to cut the joy of your salvation off. He wants to choke it out by the cares of this life. He wants to make you think the devil's actually got power and authority and he has none. &gt;&gt; The devil can't take you before it's your time. I don't care how much the calamity is. I don't care how though war should rise in this. I'll be confident. When David said that, he was a man who saw the calamity of war. War is a destructive thing. You think of Ukraine. You think of national force. You think of how it would be to to be powerless before an army coming before you saying, "I've got my bombs. I've got my weapons. I can take your life." And you could stand there and say, "No, you can't do it." Just like you can't do it unless my father allowed it. &gt;&gt; And and as sons and daughters of God, Satan can't touch a hair on your head. without going through God. &gt;&gt; You can be sure of that. &gt;&gt; We can't let the things of this world dampen the confidence we have in the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He knows you and he's keeping you. The the contrast though is that when you're not living in that reality, and I would say it's very easy to be drawn back out of the confidence and the assurity we have in Christ Jesus because we get shocked. Sure, &gt;&gt; we can get shocked in denominational thinking, thinking that we could just settle for just believing it the way I don't want to just settle with easy belieism. &gt;&gt; I want to see my God come real on the scene. &gt;&gt; I I want to know that in my situation, he's a present help in the time of need. &gt;&gt; And I don't have to settle for him not showing up. I can be if God be for us, where be all the miracles? If there's a desire in me to see more of God, there's more of God to be had. And I could tell you why I know that is because the sheathwave offering that came in this day that said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; I I that's whose pasture I'm in. &gt;&gt; That's my shepherd. &gt;&gt; But it's the it's the the interbreeding. It's the It's the hybriding. It's the cutting off of the joy. It's the It's the things that try to take that blessed assurance away from you that will cause you to to think you're meeting the mark. And what you've done is you've just kind of well, I believe it. I'm okay. &gt;&gt; And that's not what we're called to in this hour. It's complete victory. &gt;&gt; And it's a privilege. &gt;&gt; So the it it back to the sacred trust. I think these things will drive it home. I we know that God's word is the vehicle through which he imparts eternal life. He framed the world to it. We we say God's word and we mean it in the simplicity of God's word. This vindicated word that he looked out and wrote over by the Holy Spirit moving upon men. But it's not just in word only, right? But it's through power and demonstration. It's through the life of the word. And that is in you. &gt;&gt; And God wants to prove his word a reality. That is why the prosperity gospel works, okay? Is God does good to those who despitefully use him and he so desires that man would know who they are by showing who he is because we are made in his image. &gt;&gt; You know that this message tells us some beautiful things about who we are that you will find nowhere else. You are made in the image of God. Before Adam was even formed out of the flesh, he was made spirit man in the image of God. And you have that theophony representation, the very the the life of his life. &gt;&gt; You were with him before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; That's the life you have. That's what's desiring to be declared. And I got to tell you, this body can't stop it. &gt;&gt; You though the skin worms eat this flesh. You could do whatever you want. You could destroy this body, but the life of Christ in me cannot be destroyed. It's as eternal as God is eternal. And I want to declare it. But what the thought I want to try to get to is is that this is God's plan was to have a preeminence in the people. We're in the day where he wants to make known what it looks like God in human flesh. That's the sacred trust that we're we're manifesting. This is uh this is out of the sermon. You could probably find it. The Comforter 61, October 1st, the evening. I'm going to take a text here from uh the reading from paragraph 55. Actually, I might back up. I don't know if I read this earlier. This is in 52. And if I read it, we're going to read it again. Now, we have a sacred trust. You know what a trust is. And we have an inheritance, a heritage that we inherit as believing children. It's a sacred trust. And that sacred trust and our sacred heritage is the word of God that's been given to us. The full word of God. The word itself is the vitamin. The word itself, God's word. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it is a privilege to have the full word of God. Not a partial light, not something the enemy's been able to come in and put through the cycle of revival and death, but you are sitting in the hour where the word comes to full maturity. &gt;&gt; It's rapture time. &gt;&gt; This isn't a partial word with you're you're not just stuck under sanctification as powerful as it is. You're not just s stuck under a justification knowing that blessed is he who the Lord doesn't impute iniquity. I know that it's I've been forgiven. But in this day, we understand justification as though you've never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; That how could you when he already took a picture of you before the foundation of the world? &gt;&gt; That you are in the eternal thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; That's our that's our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Just moving on down. God's word is a seed. We read that, pardon me. It is our privilege. It's the sacred trust. This is in 55. That God has put in his church. God gave his word to his church. And that sacred heritage is ours. It's a gift from God. Not just to compromise on this and cut this out and throw this out and add this in to suit our own taste, but to preach the full word. And and just to understand what I would even desire to to to convey is it it's really the the word of God is of no private interpretation &gt;&gt; and and what we really want to display is Christ and not my dogmatic way of carrying the message and its truths and and and uh bless God or and even in and I would say even in the right way of authority. But it and it should be carried that way. This isn't a compromising wishy-washy gospel. &gt;&gt; So I don't mean to demean that, but I mean the nature &gt;&gt; in which it was brought in. &gt;&gt; I don't need to add my own flavor to it. &gt;&gt; But if I could convey to you who I've met &gt;&gt; and how he changed my life, &gt;&gt; that's what can make the difference. So it's not through the abundance of words. &gt;&gt; Little sisters, little brothers, you can display a lot of times a lot more Christ than the the adults can &gt;&gt; because you have a tender heart and you have a nature that he's pleased to draw nigh to. And we could do a lot better with our ability to humble ourselves because what did he say? I suffer the little ones to come unto me. We can get off our high horses and get a little little a lot of times and we that would do more for the kingdom of heaven than all of our theology. &gt;&gt; That's the nature and he draws near to that. &gt;&gt; We know whom we've believed in. &gt;&gt; We ain't guessing who he is. We haven't turned him into some big teddy bear. We don't have him god a far off. But if you've met him, you know that he cares &gt;&gt; and he's mindful &gt;&gt; and he wants to wash your feet. He wants to take the dirt off. He knows where you've been. He knows the things. He knows what it's like to be a teenager. &gt;&gt; He knows. And anybody that tells you that this gospel and the power of the Holy Spirit isn't enough doesn't know my God. &gt;&gt; Because it's not a different life. It's the same life that was in Jesus Christ was the promise. &gt;&gt; So, did it overcome in Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; What charge are you laying to my Lord? Are you saying that Jesus Christ was a flawed teenager? &gt;&gt; That he bore the likeness of sinful flesh in vain? That what was in him just didn't have the power to overcome? And that if he would have just had a good philosophy and a theology, it might have been better. But no, it was the life of Christ that was deity in flesh. And the promise was that the same life that was in Jesus Christ can quicken this mortal body. &gt;&gt; That he that he that raised Christ from the dead, if he dwell in me, &gt;&gt; that I can live. That it's no longer I that liveth, &gt;&gt; that Christ that liveth in me. We can't bypass the death. &gt;&gt; And that's daily. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. If anything, the the when you say you're taking out the flavor, it's we just got to die. &gt;&gt; We just got to die &gt;&gt; because so many times our pride wants to just take the word and just put it the way we want to kind of carry it. &gt;&gt; You know, we want to carry it this way. It's less offensive. You know, we want to carry it this way because we don't have to die. We can hang on to this. you know, it's just moderation. We But that's not that's not the life. That's your flavor. So, we don't want to suit our own taste, but we want the full word. &gt;&gt; And that's a sacred trust. So, what we're, you know, wanting to recognize is um there's those who've carried this truth. And I believe we can look to and see our prophet messenger in this day carried the word and this truth and it was done in a way that really I would say if you want an example of the life of Christ. Thank the Lord for having it in a way that we can look to where we can hear the audio where you could go watch a video and see a man where you can understand that this was not your televangelist. &gt;&gt; It wasn't your aa Allen. It wasn't, you know, there was a lot of moves of God, but something that was different about this was the nature that it was brought in. &gt;&gt; And that's the power. That's I don't want to ever lose that. I want our lives to be so impressed that they could say just as they did of the disciples, we've perceived that these have been with Christ, &gt;&gt; ignorant and unlearned. But what was the effect of being in his presence? That's a virtue. There's a life to give and you've been given that. &gt;&gt; I have no idea where we're at on the time. You guys hide the clocks around here. &gt;&gt; All right. I don't know what time I started either. So, I think someone asked for a two-hour sermon, so we might be in trouble. All right. Well, what time did we start? 7:30, right? So, we're good. Okay. And my my clock may be on a different time, so we're we're doing real good. But so, this is we are all Americans, I think. So, in the church tonight, maybe not. We are all American citizens. We are thankful to be American. Yet, but what happened to our American heritage? What was it? We began to compromise. So, this isn't a this isn't a new understanding. If you think we've compromised now, I mean, this was already the compromise had started. I I you know I I know that it was said recently and I don't want to necessarily borrow uh worldly terminology but it we it should behoove us to understand what it means to be born in a Christian nation. It really we we really should understand that as a nation the people who don't even acknowledge God are beneficiaries of a culture of a country that was raised in Christian principles and we're and people who deny God are still showing forth pieces of the attributes of Christianity. They can. Look, you could lock yourself in the basement and deny there's a son. It doesn't mean there's not a son. And you could say there's good without God, but there is none good but God. And if anybody is portraying any virtue, I'm telling you, it's because they're capable of reflecting the virtues of God. &gt;&gt; They can deny it, but there is nothing good but God. They may not attribute it to God, but they're beneficiaries of the same son that we're under. &gt;&gt; So that's a heritage. &gt;&gt; And just as much as someone can get passionate about preserving an American heritage, I want to awaken in you. You've got a sacred trust to this gospel. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let it be carried in a different flavor and a different life than what God wants to display. He wants Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know who our Christ is. He's the meek and the lowly. He He's the one who was born in a manger. &gt;&gt; That's our Lord. &gt;&gt; And we've been given the privilege to live that. God help me. God help you as Christians never to compromise one word of God's word. For this is the sacred trust that was handed to the church. And it's a glorious thing to have this gospel, the full gospel, to preach it without compromising anywhere. Preach it just as it is written. Leave it just as it is written. What a sacred trust. And if we ever expect this word to ever come to pass, if we ever expect God to keep his word, we've got to stay with it just the way God wrote it. That's the reason if you stay with it the way God wrote it, there will be all kinds of things happening among you. Every word will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It is in putting God's word first with an understanding &gt;&gt; with a a a this is the promise. He said &gt;&gt; that if in all my ways I acknowledge him, he'll direct my path. &gt;&gt; God can move through that. We're not just guessing on how to apply the word, but we want the word to be uh uh applicable. &gt;&gt; We want to find the practical applications of God's word in our life and then put it in practice so God can prove himself the yes the same. And if many people not knowing that they're using scriptural principles are applying it and God does he he's true to his word. But you want to see God come in the power and authority of his word, put it before you. Just as they just as they did when they came to the Jordan, they took the ark and they stepped. You put the word of God before you, it will light your path. It'll make a way. It'll it'll go through the mountain. &gt;&gt; That is the privilege that we have. And there's many mockers of it. There's there's a and this is just a way to capture it, but it is in surrender, right? It is in laying down our understanding. It is in truly humbling ourselves to the word of God because the word of God is above the wisdom and understanding of man. There's things that we would say this is the right decision. This is the right choice. And I would say if it is in contradiction to the word of God, cast that down. &gt;&gt; Quickly, &gt;&gt; God will prove his word to be true. And he's pleased when you stand by faith upon his word. And that it's the faith in his word that ultimately what we ministered on last time. He's pleased by your faith &gt;&gt; in his word. God never used idols. He's always used man. God don't use machinery, mechanic devices. He uses man, individuals. Excuse me. I didn't a mean to holler that loud. Notice, I'm not excited, though. I know right where I'm at. Amen. Notice then this God had come down, great Jehovah, and was manifest himself through a man that they knowed it was more than a man. There was something about him that was different. And the people all worshiped God and believed God, and they built the temple. They done great things in that day. Notice this little queen began to hear it. Now she's talking about Solomon and temple and the queen. Now I I like the Queen of Sheba because she heard &gt;&gt; and I I don't know it was a many days journey. So there was someone carrying the word of God and testifying to the things that had been real to them. &gt;&gt; And this strikes the Queen of Sheba. The privilege you have is might be just the one who we don't hear the account of who brought it to the Queen of Sheba, but there was someone &gt;&gt; who was testifying of the things that they had seen. &gt;&gt; And that is so true in our day. &gt;&gt; Come and see. &gt;&gt; This message is life. &gt;&gt; I I I still like to show the video of of a man sent from God in in well it's uh 20th century prophet there's different titles for it but when he's there and the the Chicago campaign and he's discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart I I that's a beautiful thing to share that's Jesus Christ put on display to this generation to this day &gt;&gt; words of life God's love projected that testimony should not be dead upon our lips I'm not ashamed of this gospel. This message was God's provided way of salvation. &gt;&gt; It's not just in word and deed, but it was the nature that was displayed in that prophet that I want others to see &gt;&gt; because that's just as much a part of the gospel. Now, I want to believe that's for me, too. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just put that off on, you know, you have to look at him because I can't live it. No, but God help me live it. I want to if if they don't have a chance to see it, I want to show it. &gt;&gt; My life should be the the that is the proof that the seed's coming to maturity. It wasn't just a sheathwave offering to be the sheath all by itself, but there's got to be a a seed come to maturity. &gt;&gt; And we're here. I believe it. &gt;&gt; I know we we speak these things a lot of times as they shall be, but I believe we're at the very hour. We have to believe and start claiming it to be for us for ourselves. Hebrews 13:78 would say, "Remember them which have rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God whose faith follow." So this is not an unscriptural principle to recognize the authority of the word of God in our day came through a prophet. We don't have a message of our own. We don't have another place, but we're going to be gathered under the messenger to our age. That word is our provided place of safety. And we absolutely should be remembering that. It shouldn't be something that for some reason uh we've grown past or we think that we now now that we've got everything, we can figure it out ourselves. But that is a provided place of refuge. And I would say I don't have my own thought coming. If I think I've figured something out that makes more sense than what the prophet taught, Lord help me. you it's uh I hope not something that any of us have fallen into that trap but we would have if we if someone has become so wise in their own conceit that they think they understand something better than the very prophet to the age and they want to tell you that they figured it out just stick with the message &gt;&gt; I don't believe this message didn't anything that needed to be corrected was corrected within the message. It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And and this is where and you know, we know the saying quite well. You'd rather have the right spirit than the the wrong than the wrong the the right spirit and the wrong doctrine, the right doctrine and the wrong spirit because the right spirit will bring you to the truth. But even in all of that, the the token life, the Holy Spirit does more to testify about the truth than your ability to explain theology and doctrine. &gt;&gt; There's things that you may never be able to explain, but you understand to be the truth because it's in your heart. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to practice Christian apologetics. You want you you have the ability to just say, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; That's the difference. &gt;&gt; And when you say it, you mean it. &gt;&gt; I know this to be the truth. &gt;&gt; And though my God doesn't deliver me, he may not. But I will not bow to your ideology, your thinking, your theology, your understanding. I don't care what corner you think you painted me into. I'm sorry. I believe what I believe. &gt;&gt; I know it to be the truth. &gt;&gt; You may be able to think you can convince me otherwise, but I've experienced it. He doesn't care how religious you are. But he's he's looking out after if you possess the life. Amen. Take the time to read this. It's a little maybe even a common reading, but it excites my heart. I don't think I could get a I it could get old reading from our prophet. This is uh the rising of the sun, paragraph 62. Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And saints, I know that saying becomes common. But it's something we should really start meditating on more. It is when even when Jesus would say, "Our father which in heaven," and he would begin to pray, he would say, "On earth as it is in heaven." When you start to understand what it means for Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Think of this. Heavens and earth will pass away, but his word will not pass away. So everything that's not going to be there, and you just start thinking about that, there's a lot. The mourner's bench will have no place at all. There ain't going to be no sickness. There ain't going to be no sorrow. There ain't going to be confusion. There ain't going to be no video games. There's not going to be all the things that aren't there are outside of Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's your refuge. I know what's not going to be there and I know who's going to be there. That's my Lord. &gt;&gt; I I know whom I've believed in. That's today. &gt;&gt; That's now. That's lifting out up Jesus Christ out of history and saying he's my Lord right now. &gt;&gt; Because I I I could we could lot could believe for what heaven's going to be. We know the devil ain't going to be there. We just know that academically that guy ain't there. It's heaven. Of course he's not there. But when you could start believing that the light that shines now can cast out darkness, that he's a God that could come present on the scene now, and that your darkness can be turned today, that your sorrow can become joy, that everything that you think Satan's trapped you into can be obliterated. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; today. Now's the hour of salvation. This isn't a God of will be. It's today. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus Christ today and we're his beneficiaries to prove his life is in us now. The beneficiaries of the life. The life there never was a life lived like it. He was the son of God and he died and that and that shut it out. But when he raised again from the dead on Easter morning, then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring the good news to every person that he is living. And how can we do it? By the word only. For it is written, the gospel came not by word only, but through the power and manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive. Now, if there is another gospel as Bo Paul spoke of to one of the groups, I am so surprised that you've turned to another gospel. Saints, that spirit still works. There's people who've made this gospel of none effect. They've literally turned to other gospels &gt;&gt; even in the name and the framework of what we hold dear. And I I I don't even like to call it the message, but it's just the same religious denominational thinking that's been at work in every age. But this message won't denominate. &gt;&gt; It is the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; And we can't be uh caught off guard or or think that we have any less than the full manifestation for us to manifest. &gt;&gt; Don't settle. &gt;&gt; I ain't turning back. &gt;&gt; I want my mountain. I'm not going to stay the same. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not settling for anything less than perfection. I want the I if there's more to me to die than I want to be. The zeal I want to have is to repent &gt;&gt; and die. I don't want to think that I've come so far in my theology and understanding of what a believer should be that for some reason it's wrong to repent &gt;&gt; and to say I'm sorry and to really show the fruits of what the power of Christ is which is really the power to die. &gt;&gt; He had the he laid his life down. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't forget that. &gt;&gt; That was the example. That was the ultimate example that he had. And it the most sublime of all scriptures for their sakes he sanctified himself. He had a right to do a lot of things and he could have done them just as the right of any person would do. But for the sacred trust, for the for the sake of life, for the sake of bearing this Christ, for the sake of bringing the life to the church which the bride has been given, We can die &gt;&gt; to self. &gt;&gt; I could die a little more to my understanding, to my wants, to my needs. That I could be a more effectual in the body of Christ. That I could show forth his image, not with the flavor of in of David McGee. Now, to his glory, he's a bouquet. He He knows how to use all kinds. Be who you are. &gt;&gt; But I want it to be Christ in me. I don't want to be me holding to tradition, to my understanding. My family did it this way. This is the way I see it. If the word of God challenges me, I want to be willing to die &gt;&gt; and just say, Lord, be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; I want to be a carrier of your life above all else. You wanted to have the preeminence in your church in this day to show forth Christ in this day. Just going to try to bring it to a close and wrap uh this is uh the statue of a perfect man. He says it this way in paragraph 75. Know how that God is in his church. The church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ carrying on his ministry. And that is g a giver of life. You you are the light. If there's and I would even say this way, did he not feed the multitudes, the loaves and the fishes? We don't sell the economy of God short. the good day that you could be to others. &gt;&gt; The ray of sunshine there you just your smile, the way you treat somebody, the light you shine very well could change the whole direction that their life was going in because you're Christ. What was it? The funeral possession couldn't cross his path. That's us in this day. &gt;&gt; Darkness has to flee. &gt;&gt; And you I it's it's to be put on display. The token is to be put on display. &gt;&gt; You have a sacred trust. The greatest privilege that we would know really is to know the truth. &gt;&gt; The truth sets free. If it men for a lack of vision perish, but we have an open word and a truth. &gt;&gt; Your heritage is to come into this building to hear the gospel preached, the fullness of it, what God's done in this day. And it would behoove us to make sure that we know what is that you ready to give an answer. Young people, be ready to give an answer. And I and not just from doctrine, but but that you know him. We don't want to be make believers. You can't give what you ain't got. &gt;&gt; And and I'm saying this for myself. There's things I know I believe are the truth. I believe them there. I believe that's God all God. I have confidence in the source. I know it's God's word. But there's a difference when something is just an understanding and a belief and when it becomes a revelation &gt;&gt; and I want to allow myself to be quickened &gt;&gt; it to to bring forth the life of it &gt;&gt; not just settle for an understanding of it. And you know what in even saying that you know what the price is? God will do what he needs to to make it become a reality. Being on the potter's will isn't easy. &gt;&gt; But I want to set before you what the reason is. Why are things hard? Why are there trials? Why is there something that challenges you? Because God wants to show his image in you. &gt;&gt; Christ didn't have an easy road. But there's a victory that we all must win. He doesn't have to bear he doesn't bear the cross alone. But there's a dying out that we can bear the fruit. And it in the in the simplicity of it, it's nothing but the birth. It's let your word be born in me Lord. &gt;&gt; The sacred trust is that is of motherhood is to bear the life. I want to bear the life of Christ. So you just stand with me and the musicians could come. Lord, I want to be faithful to all that you want to in this day display. I believe this is the hour of maturity. Just as Adam would have been in the garden and display his sunship, I believe that there's a bride that's going to reflect the image of who he is, the life of Christ. And I want the Lord just to be faithful to complete the work he started in me. I know the in the seed. It's there. All that he's given will be manifested. But I know that sometimes we just say, "Lord, there's more of me to die that you can live. I haven't allowed you to be on full display the way you should be." Sometimes I [Music] just let my flesh get in the way. But Lord, do what you need to give me the vision of what's set before me. That there's others that are depending on me, the heritage that I have that I need to preserve it. That I want to show the nature of Christ that others could live. Let's just go before him. Gracious heavenly father, we thank you for your word. Thank you for the heritage of it, Lord. And I believe as you've trusted us with your word that it's because you know exactly what we're made out of. We're sons and daughters of God. The power to overcome and all that we are, you put in us before the foundation of the world, Lord. and you give us your word to fight the battle. Father, we ask that you anoint our faith, Lord, to believe and to receive and you'd quicken us, Father, from glory to glory. You'd give us strength that we could be a light and a virtue to others, Lord, that if there's any here that feel like they don't have anything to give, Father, that will you fill their cup, Father, to overflowing, Lord. One touch from you, everything changes. One touch from you father that death becomes life. You haven't changed Lord. You said not by power, not by might, but by my spirit. Father, may your spirit have complete preeminence and control in our lives. [Music] May it be what quickens the word to our heart. Maybe we understand what it means for you to come in and blow through the room and make your presence known. Lord, you've changed not. [Music] But you're the same. It's not for another day age, another day. But I believe that many sitting here now have known you in many times to move in powerful ways. You're still the same, Father. Lord, even now just thinking of the times you've done miraculous things. Can't even explain why you would come and make yourself so real. Father, and yet I know there's many who would desire to have you come in a reality and may say they've never felt you and they don't know you to be real. But Father, I believe you're desiring more than they realize to make yourself known to them, [Music] Lord. And where there's any hindrance, I ask that you would break it. Lord, that recognize Jesus Christ of this Bible promised that he would come again, that he would be the comforter, Lord. And it's given us to know you in the power of your resurrection. Commit it all to you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
