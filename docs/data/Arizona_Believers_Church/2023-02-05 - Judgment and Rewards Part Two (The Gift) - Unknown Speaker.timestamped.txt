[0:00] Keep this in mind. We're going to be
[0:01] speaking on the gift. Uh it's an
[0:02] important um important distinction here
[0:06] at the outset as we want to get further
[0:07] into judgments, different times of
[0:10] judging and judgments and also the
[0:11] different rewards or rewards as a
[0:14] subject. And on Wednesday, we read this
[0:16] statement and you guys can take it from
[0:18] here, but in church age book chapter 4,
[0:21] brother Bram says, "All too little time
[0:23] is spent on laboring for the eternal
[0:26] rewards of God." Remember he said in
[0:28] each age he holds out an incentive
[0:30] encouraging the believer to overcome and
[0:31] thereby re be rewarded. So he says we
[0:34] spend too little time laboring for the
[0:36] eternal rewards of God. So that ought to
[0:39] tell us that there's a labor that we can
[0:41] undertake as Christians and as believers
[0:43] that is going to be rewarded. He says uh
[0:45] the recompense of God is too lightly
[0:47] esteemed. And I would love it if this
[0:49] becomes less and less applicable to us
[0:51] that we spend more time laboring for
[0:53] eternal rewards and we begin to esteem
[0:55] it more heavily or value it more. He
[0:57] says we believe in the reality if we
[0:59] believe in the reality of the
[1:00] resurrection of the body and an eternal
[1:02] kingdom of substance, then we ought to
[1:04] lay up in heaven those good treasures
[1:06] that are available to the faithful
[1:09] saints. And the way that he the way that
[1:11] he says that we should be thinking um
[1:13] very intently on that and focus on how
[1:16] he says it that there's treasures
[1:18] available for us to lay up. So there's
[1:20] rewards that God makes available and
[1:22] then we have to undertake some effort to
[1:24] then secure it in heaven. Secure it in
[1:27] eternity because he calls them the
[1:28] eternal rewards of God. So he says that
[1:30] we ought to lay up these treasures that
[1:32] are available. So you have so many
[1:35] treasures that are available to you
[1:37] there. there there's a certain amount
[1:38] and if there's a certain amount we want
[1:39] to lay up 100% of that amount lay it up
[1:42] in heaven and secure that Jesus in
[1:45] Matthew chapter 6 20 this is what
[1:46] brother's drawing from but lay up for
[1:48] yourselves treasures in heaven that lay
[1:51] up means accumulate riches I know some
[1:53] of you people some of you believers are
[1:55] going to like this lay up riches brother
[1:56] Loyal said something the other day when
[1:58] he was preaching last year and he said
[1:59] you know the world wants to you know
[2:01] work hard and get rich and he said amen
[2:03] right and so and there's things that we
[2:06] realize there's benefits in having
[2:08] income and and their single greatest
[2:10] asset in building wealth is your income
[2:11] and so that we we want to accumulate
[2:13] that and there's ways that we want to
[2:15] have investments and we want to secure
[2:16] maybe a future but that's not our goal
[2:18] that's not our aim whatever effort we
[2:20] put into that we should ought to double
[2:21] in the things of God at least because he
[2:23] says lay up which means accumulate
[2:25] riches treasures which is accumulated or
[2:28] stored wealth and so it's this image as
[2:31] brother Bram says that we can labor for
[2:33] eternal rewards and that we ought to lay
[2:35] up treasures that are available That
[2:36] means there's a way that you can work to
[2:39] take store up and accumulate wealth in
[2:42] heaven in eternal reward. And so there
[2:46] are ways that the believer in laboring
[2:48] for Christ can secure a heavenly wealth
[2:51] during this lifetime.
[2:54] And in Luke 12:33, brother uh Jesus says
[2:57] it this way in kind of the same subject.
[2:58] He says, "Sell that you have and give
[3:01] alms, and in doing so provide yourselves
[3:03] bags which wax not old, a treasure in
[3:06] the heavens that faileth not, where no
[3:08] thief approacheth, neither moth
[3:09] corrupteth."
[3:10] What's he referring to? Acts of
[3:12] unselfishness, acts of generosity and
[3:14] living for others. He's saying doing
[3:16] that builds wealth. It gives you uh
[3:18] these treasures in heaven that a thief
[3:20] cannot steal or a moth cannot corrupt.
[3:22] He says, "If you live in and live for
[3:24] others and you labor unselfishly and you
[3:26] give generously, these are the acts that
[3:28] bring us that bring us these rewards or
[3:31] secure us these rewards in heaven." And
[3:34] uh these riches that Jesus is talking
[3:36] about are our eternal rewards that
[3:38] Brother Bam's referring to
[3:43] a reward. And this is important to catch
[3:46] this now because I want to speak on the
[3:48] gift. And a reward is something given in
[3:51] payment for labor or worthy behavior. So
[3:54] a reward is something that's earned. You
[3:56] earn it. You do something and and you're
[3:58] befitting of as brother Bam says, we
[3:59] ought to labor uh to gain those
[4:01] treasures that are available. So there's
[4:03] things we ought to do. We ought to be
[4:04] laboring for these eternal rewards. A
[4:06] reward is something given do to do
[4:09] someone who's labored in a particular
[4:11] way. Brother Bram says this in the
[4:13] Sardisian church age. If they are
[4:15] willing to walk with him through the
[4:16] toils and snares of life and be honor to
[4:18] him, he was going to reward him. He's
[4:20] not forgetful of our labor of love. God
[4:23] will always recompense us our efforts to
[4:25] please him. And so these are eternal
[4:28] rewards that are given to the elect at a
[4:31] time of judgment,
[4:32] at this time that Paul refers to here,
[4:34] that we'll all appear before the
[4:35] judgment seat of Christ. And I'll go
[4:37] into this in greater detail scripturally
[4:39] through the message of the hour. But
[4:40] this isn't a time when everyone appears
[4:42] before Christ to be judged. But this is
[4:44] when the elect appear before Christ.
[4:47] And at this time of this gathering
[4:48] together, there's going to be awards
[4:50] rewards given out. It's kind of like the
[4:53] bride's awards banquet.
[4:55] All right? Because there's going to be a
[4:56] wedding supper in the air. There's going
[4:57] to be a time of gathering to Christ. And
[4:59] so these are eternal rewards that
[5:01] brother refers to are given to the elect
[5:02] at this time of judgment. And I believe
[5:04] it's a wonderful truth that brother says
[5:06] we don't labor enough for and we don't
[5:08] esteem it enough. Amen.
[5:10] As Paul says, for we must all appear
[5:12] before the judgment seat of Christ, and
[5:15] everyone may receive the things done in
[5:17] his body according to that he hath done,
[5:19] whether it be good or bad. We must all
[5:21] appear. That means be made manifest in
[5:23] our true character. So, think of this.
[5:26] You when you die, what do you take with
[5:27] you?
[5:28] When we're translate, we take with us
[5:29] our character. And that character is
[5:30] going to be examined and and it's going
[5:32] to be proven. And we must all appear
[5:34] before the judgment seat of Christ to
[5:36] receive those things done in our body,
[5:37] to answer for the things that we've done
[5:39] in our flesh. So all believers, I know
[5:42] this is a difficult subject. That's why
[5:44] I plan on spending more time in it um
[5:47] than just a service or two. We must give
[5:49] an account of ourselves before Christ.
[5:52] We're going to have to answer. We're
[5:53] going to have to answer to Christ for
[5:54] what we've done with the word. And then
[5:56] when we answer, we receive a reward for
[5:58] those good deeds that we've done. And so
[6:00] there's uh as though I'm not going to be
[6:03] emphasizing it much today as we
[6:05] transition to the the the thought of a
[6:06] gift. We will be accountable for the
[6:09] things we've done in our body. Now
[6:13] bear this in mind and this is hopefully
[6:15] what I can emphasize today. The
[6:17] accountability does not determine
[6:18] whether or not you go to heaven or go to
[6:20] hell.
[6:21] The answering is not it does not relate
[6:23] to salvation at all. This judgment where
[6:25] we we answer and accountable for the
[6:27] deeds that we've done, the things we
[6:28] said in our stewardship is a judgment to
[6:31] determine a reward.
[6:32] So the only thing you would miss out on
[6:34] is not receiving more.
[6:36] Can't take can't take your salvation
[6:38] away. Can't take your the seal of God
[6:40] away, but there's a reward that's going
[6:42] to be given out. There's rewards that
[6:43] are available. And so these are the
[6:46] things that that's what we're looking at
[6:47] when we say judgment and rewards.
[6:49] There's a lot of other things that we'll
[6:50] try to bring into the the into view
[6:52] there, but that's the first thing we
[6:53] want to focus on. But if you could turn
[6:57] your Bibles to Romans chapter 6 23, I
[7:00] want you if you could just pay very
[7:02] close attention this morning. [snorts] I
[7:04] think that we're at a comfortable
[7:05] temperature. Um we're we're we're
[7:07] crowded. Maybe some people are sitting
[7:09] in some unfamiliar places, but if you
[7:11] could just pay very close attention
[7:13] because these are some very familiar
[7:15] concepts, but it's almost as if through
[7:17] the familiarity, they're not easily
[7:19] understood or they can be easily
[7:21] misunderstood. They're so familiar that
[7:23] we don't maybe we don't ever really dig
[7:26] down deep enough to get the revelation
[7:28] of the concept. And there's even some of
[7:30] these things I'm going to refer to that
[7:32] we have used we use as terminology that
[7:34] have lost their true meaning
[7:36] scripturally. And we kind of give a
[7:38] monopoly on certain terms to certain
[7:40] organizations or belief systems. And I
[7:42] believe that as believers and as genuine
[7:44] Christians, we should take back any
[7:46] scriptural term and any any any language
[7:48] that is used in the Bible, understand
[7:50] it, own it, make it our own. Like we
[7:53] shouldn't be ashamed to say we're
[7:54] Christians.
[7:55] Uh because that's only for those who are
[7:57] Christlike. And there's a uh we
[7:58] shouldn't be ashamed to say that we are
[8:00] true believers because we are believers
[8:01] in the truth. And so there's a lot of
[8:03] phrases that can lose their meaning. And
[8:05] even as brother says, eternal rewards
[8:07] are too lightly esteemed because it's
[8:09] lost its meaning. In Romans chapter 6
[8:12] 23, this is where we're going to be able
[8:14] to just start to really dive into the
[8:17] gift. For the wages of sin is death, but
[8:20] the gift of God is eternal life through
[8:23] Jesus Christ our Lord. So notice the
[8:26] first part. The wages of sin is death.
[8:27] Wages is compensation or payment for
[8:30] service or work. So you are paid death
[8:34] because of sin. Because of your sin,
[8:36] because of your unbelief. And so death
[8:38] is earned because of sin. It's not a
[8:41] gift. Death is not a gift. Death, the
[8:44] wages of sin. So it's used in a way to
[8:46] say it's compensation or payment for
[8:48] service or work. The reward, we could
[8:50] say the reward of sin is death. uh
[8:53] because there's sin and because you
[8:54] because we do sin and because we make
[8:56] mistakes and because we've lived uh we
[8:59] live we're born in sin and we we live
[9:00] out a life of unbelief that if that sin
[9:03] is never atoned for and paid for then
[9:06] what's due for that the due for that is
[9:08] death.
[9:11] But then it says the gift of God is
[9:13] eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[9:14] Lord.
[9:15] Amen.
[9:16] So there's a difference between the wage
[9:18] and the gift. One is a wage, the other
[9:19] one is a gift. In Luke 23:41, the thief
[9:22] on the cross, the one that was pardoned
[9:24] is objecting to the one that was railing
[9:26] against Christ. And he says, "We indeed
[9:28] justly. We hang here justly. We're on
[9:29] this cross because we deserve it. For we
[9:31] receive the due reward of our deeds, but
[9:34] this man hath done nothing to miss. I'm
[9:36] receiving the due reward, the wage of
[9:39] our sins. We are receiving a reward for
[9:42] our labor. We've done things that merit
[9:44] this crucifixion." That is a reward.
[9:46] That is a wage. When you do something
[9:48] that merits you something in return,
[9:50] it's a wage. It's a reward.
[9:54] But a gift is something that's given
[9:56] voluntarily without payment in return. A
[9:59] gift is showing favor. It's showing
[10:01] kindness. And when you give a gift, you
[10:03] do it uh you do it of your own free
[10:05] will. A and you do it and as a way of
[10:07] saying this is I'm going to give this
[10:09] gift and I'm going to I'm giving it
[10:12] expecting nothing in return. I'm giving
[10:14] it not because um I want you to pay for
[10:17] it or make you feel guilty. And isn't
[10:19] that the worst when someone gives you a
[10:20] gift and then find out later on they
[10:22] they kept the receipt and they're going
[10:23] to charge you for it. You're like,
[10:25] "Well, had I known you were going to
[10:26] charge me for this piece of garbage, I
[10:28] would have just given it right back,
[10:30] right? I could have gone to the thrift
[10:31] store and got that myself." But there's
[10:33] it's not fun when that happens. You
[10:35] realize if they were expecting something
[10:36] in return, it's not a no strings
[10:39] attached gift, right? It's not something
[10:41] that was given out of love to show favor
[10:43] and kindness voluntarily, but there is
[10:45] something expected in return. So think
[10:46] of this. A gift is something that's
[10:49] given to show favor without the
[10:51] expectation of anything in return,
[10:53] without any payment or any merit as
[10:56] consideration.
[10:58] A gift is not purchased
[11:01] or earned by the recipient.
[11:05] But wages are earned. They are deserved.
[11:07] A reward is earned. A reward is
[11:09] deserved. that a gift is not purchased
[11:10] or earned by a recipient. Paul says it
[11:12] this way in Romans 4:4, "Now to him that
[11:14] workketh is the reward not reckoned of
[11:16] grace." So if you work and receive a
[11:18] reward, it's not grace. You've earned
[11:20] it.
[11:21] So the re the him that workketh is the
[11:23] reward not reckoned of grace, but of
[11:25] debt. So a labor's wages are credited to
[11:27] to him as an obligation owed. He that
[11:30] works is owed a wage. He that labors is
[11:33] owed a reward. So it's not paid of
[11:34] grace. Well, I'm going to show you
[11:36] kindness. And if a a service provider
[11:38] came over, someone came over and built a
[11:40] fence or dug a trench or, you know, I
[11:43] cleaned your swimming pool or whatever
[11:44] it is and you go and say, "Here, I just
[11:46] I just want to give you a gift." He's
[11:47] saying, "This ain't a gift. You owe me
[11:48] that."
[11:49] Right? I don't think any of our
[11:51] employers give us our paychecks and
[11:52] said, "I just thought I'd be nice to you
[11:54] this week and pay you for your 40 hours.
[11:57] If you if they're doing that and they're
[11:58] considered a gift, you should call a
[11:59] lawyer, employment lawyer, real quick.
[12:01] Something's a miss." But that's so a
[12:04] labor's wages are given to him out of
[12:06] obligation because he deserves a reward
[12:09] for what he's labored for.
[12:10] So can you see just through these few
[12:12] scriptures that there's a reward for
[12:14] labor and there's a gift that's not
[12:16] connected to any works whatsoever.
[12:18] It's the gift that is of grace and not
[12:20] of any merit or effort on your part. And
[12:24] so there's a difference between God's
[12:26] reward for labor when we talk about
[12:27] rewards in this initial uh part on these
[12:31] specific rewards that are given out of
[12:32] this time that we're reading here in the
[12:34] Bible. There's a difference between
[12:35] God's reward for labor and the gift of
[12:37] God for the wages of sin or death. But
[12:40] the gift of God is eternal life through
[12:42] Jesus Christ. So the gift of God, we
[12:45] could say very easily, this is just
[12:47] simple math, the gift of God is eternal
[12:50] life. Paul is telling us what the gift
[12:52] is that it is eternal life. And this is
[12:54] the elect salvation through Jesus
[12:56] Christ. The gift of God is eternal life
[12:58] through Jesus Christ our Lord. The
[13:00] believer's rewards. Now the rewards that
[13:02] a believer receives are in addition to
[13:05] are more than the gift of God and
[13:07] salvation. So we talk about rewards. It
[13:10] has nothing to do with our salvation.
[13:12] It's things that are given to those who
[13:14] are are saved and then and then labor
[13:16] because of that grace.
[13:18] Amen. And so I had originally had um a
[13:21] different emphasis that I wanted to
[13:23] express this morning on on the rewards
[13:26] and the timing of the rewards. But I
[13:28] just felt I felt compelled to take time
[13:30] this morning to just look at the gift
[13:33] itself.
[13:34] Amen.
[13:35] So that we can have this we can be
[13:37] certain of the gift and not confuse it
[13:39] with any other of other God's promises.
[13:41] Because let me say this there. It's very
[13:44] clear in the word of God that there's a
[13:46] grace that's given that is not connected
[13:48] with works and it's by election. But
[13:50] then there's a judgment that is related
[13:53] to works. And if you're not able to
[13:55] place it correctly, the devil will
[13:57] exploit it
[13:58] and he'll try to drag you out of grace
[14:01] into works inappropriately.
[14:03] Try to use things to either keep you in
[14:05] sin or keep you out of the liberty of
[14:08] the Holy Ghost. So it's very important
[14:09] that we focus on this to to be certain
[14:11] of the gift and not be confused on any
[14:13] of God's promises.
[14:15] So the gift is eternal life. So I want
[14:17] to propose this question. Well then what
[14:18] is that scripturally? And let's begin in
[14:20] Acts chapter 1 and let's just keep
[14:24] reading until we finish in the book of
[14:25] Revelation and maybe we can glean what
[14:28] eternal life is.
[14:33] Acts 1:es 4 and 5. Now, as they are
[14:37] being assembled together with them,
[14:38] Christ is with them. He commands them
[14:40] that they should, and this is his
[14:41] commandment, not depart from Jerusalem,
[14:44] but wait for the promise of the father,
[14:47] which saith he, ye have heard of me, for
[14:51] John truly baptized with water, but ye
[14:53] shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[14:55] not many days hence. So, this is what he
[14:58] tells you. Terry and Jerusalem remained
[14:59] there and and and when the full the
[15:01] fullness of Pentecost has come, it was a
[15:03] specific time. It's important to
[15:05] remember that they tried until the
[15:07] dispensation was ushered in
[15:09] it. It it was it didn't establish a
[15:11] template that the believer has to tarry
[15:13] or the individual has to tarry to get
[15:15] the Holy Ghost because now once that
[15:17] that time came, God sent the Holy Ghost.
[15:19] And from then on, we don't have to have
[15:21] tarrying meetings to get the Holy Ghost.
[15:23] You don't have it's not a it's not
[15:25] undertaking a labor or some sort of
[15:27] threshold that we need to break in order
[15:28] to get it. And the Bible says in in
[15:31] Actsap 2:4 that they were all filled
[15:33] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[15:35] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[15:37] them utterance. So the Holy Ghost was
[15:39] poured out upon them. This was the
[15:41] promise of the father. What was the
[15:43] promise of the father? To be baptized
[15:45] with the Holy Ghost. So God's promise
[15:48] and this baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[15:50] this feeling are all the same. So the
[15:53] promise of the father to be baptized
[15:55] with the holy ghost and when the holy
[15:56] ghost comes it fills him with the holy
[15:58] ghost and so it's important to maybe
[16:00] make this distinction that there is a
[16:03] temporal gift of the baptism of the holy
[16:05] ghost where it kind of pours out as an
[16:06] anointing but the filling of the Holy
[16:08] Ghost is that seal upon the soul and I
[16:10] kind of just gave it all away. We could
[16:11] just sing take the name of Jesus with
[16:13] you.
[16:14] I was trying to bury the lead and I and
[16:16] I I failed. But the the the this feeling
[16:20] of the Holy Ghost then becomes something
[16:22] that is yours. And so in Acts chapter
[16:25] 2:es 38 and 39, this is uh Peter now
[16:28] having had this fresh experience and
[16:30] seeing now that this dispensation, the
[16:31] inauguration of the church, the pouring
[16:33] out of the Holy Ghost and and now they
[16:36] have had this experience of the baptism
[16:37] of the Holy Ghost or the filling of the
[16:39] Holy Ghost and they've received this and
[16:41] then from that moment on every age is
[16:43] the age of the Holy Ghost for the true
[16:45] believer. So Peter stands up and he says
[16:47] says unto them,"Repent and be baptized
[16:49] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[16:51] Christ for the remission of sins." So
[16:53] they would be repenting and in repenting
[16:56] they would feel that their sins are
[16:57] remitted. They would experience this
[16:58] this release that God has forgiven of
[17:00] their sins and you shall receive the
[17:03] gift of the Holy Ghost or the Holy Ghost
[17:05] as the gift
[17:07] for the promise. This is the promise of
[17:09] the father. He's now hearkening back to
[17:11] what he was already told by Christ. He's
[17:13] looking at what they've received. the
[17:15] promise of the father, the baptism of
[17:17] the Holy Ghost, the filling with the
[17:18] Holy Ghost that they had received. So
[17:20] he's saying, "Repent, be baptized in the
[17:22] name of Jesus Christ, and you shall
[17:24] receive the Holy Ghost as a gift, for
[17:26] the promise is unto you and to your
[17:27] children and to all that are far off,
[17:29] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[17:31] call."
[17:32] Amen.
[17:33] So the gift of the Holy Ghost is the
[17:37] gift of God.
[17:39] The gift of the Holy Ghost is the gift
[17:40] of eternal life. Amen.
[17:42] And this is where it might start to get
[17:44] a little deep and strange for some
[17:45] people, but the gift of eternal life is
[17:48] the gift of the Holy Ghost. They're not
[17:50] two different things
[17:52] scripturally and this gentile
[17:54] dispensation as the word is unfolding
[17:56] itself. They're not two different
[17:58] things. They are one gift. It's very
[18:00] important to place this correctly.
[18:02] Otherwise, and to me, I find that this
[18:04] is a this is a leveler because there's
[18:06] ways that you take being saved and
[18:08] having eternal life, but being filled
[18:10] with the Holy Ghost, and you start
[18:11] creating all these categories, there's a
[18:13] way that that never quite seems to make
[18:15] sense,
[18:16] right? Especially in light of what the
[18:18] Bible teaches us and what the message
[18:19] teaches. If you don't get and I know it
[18:21] might seem like categories and it may
[18:22] seem like semantics, but we should come
[18:24] to terms with the terms and at least
[18:26] understand what they mean in their
[18:28] context and how some people can use the
[18:30] term I'm saved or I I I I I've been
[18:33] converted or I've been born again and
[18:35] realize that people have certain ways
[18:37] that they define that, but we want to
[18:39] know what the Bible means when it comes
[18:41] to that. We want to know what brother
[18:42] Brandham taught us when it came to those
[18:44] things. And so it is important to
[18:46] recognize that the gift of the Holy
[18:48] Ghost and the gift of eternal life are
[18:50] one and the same.
[18:51] Yes, sir.
[18:52] It's one gift.
[18:54] The Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost, they are
[18:55] one and the same. Uh but it's that
[18:58] hagios which is the Holy One. This is
[19:01] speaking of God and the numa. That's
[19:03] what Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost is a
[19:05] lifegiving spirit. The Holy Spirit is
[19:08] the life of God.
[19:09] Amen.
[19:09] It's the Holy One which is a lifegiving
[19:12] spirit. So when you receive the Holy
[19:13] Spirit is the life of God.
[19:16] And Peter is preaching this this
[19:19] conviction now filled with the Holy
[19:22] Ghost standing there with this boldness
[19:23] on the day of Pentecost to repent be
[19:26] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so
[19:27] that you can receive this uh this gift
[19:30] of the Holy Ghost. And Jesus had said to
[19:33] him in Luke 22:32.
[19:36] Um [clears throat]
[19:37] I'm not I'm not sure about my pace
[19:38] today. I don't if I'm going uh too fast.
[19:41] I apologize, but I have a lot there's a
[19:43] lot of scriptures I just want to start
[19:44] connecting together.
[19:46] Uh, but I I try to be faithful that if
[19:49] if we reach a point where it's just a
[19:51] little bit too much, we'll just stop. We
[19:52] can pick this up at another time. And
[19:55] and if we rapture, then we didn't need
[19:56] it.
[19:58] It's just awesome how God works.
[20:01] He says, "But I have prayed for thee."
[20:03] This is now Jesus speaking to Peter. I
[20:05] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[20:08] and when thou wart converted strengthen
[20:11] thy brethren.
[20:12] So this is what Peter experiences and
[20:15] this is what God Jesus promised for him.
[20:17] Peter had all sorts of professions of
[20:18] faith. He had all sorts of following and
[20:20] discipline and understanding things that
[20:22] he had learned. He had a faith his own
[20:23] faith in him as the Messiah. Even had a
[20:26] revelation as Jesus referred to it. And
[20:28] he says when thou art converted this is
[20:30] a divine transformation of Peter's soul.
[20:33] when thou art converted it he says he
[20:36] says that I pray that your faith fail
[20:37] not so that when you're converted knows
[20:39] your faith is converted into his faith
[20:42] it's converted into this experience and
[20:45] into this new life and so the the the
[20:48] conversion was the sealing of Peter's
[20:50] faith
[20:52] and he says when thou art converted it's
[20:54] important that we rightly divide the
[20:55] word of truth and rightly dividing the
[20:58] word of truth requires placing God's
[21:00] promises in their proper season in
[21:03] context
[21:04] a
[21:05] and recognizing how God uses these
[21:07] terms. What was happening with Peter
[21:09] when he was converted? What is a genuine
[21:11] conversion? What what does it mean uh to
[21:13] be filled with the Holy Ghost? And
[21:16] again, I'm looking at all this as the
[21:18] gift. So, this will I I'll try to end on
[21:21] specific scriptures about it being gift.
[21:23] It's a free. It's free. But this theme
[21:24] is in in this this first part here. It's
[21:26] in all of this. It's a gift. It's given.
[21:28] It's received by his He's given it to
[21:30] you. you voluntarily receive it. And so
[21:33] when Peter stands up on the day of
[21:35] Pentecost, when he's been filled with
[21:36] the Holy Ghost, when he's preaching that
[21:38] others should likewise repent and
[21:40] receive the Holy Ghost as a gift, this
[21:42] is what Acts 2:4 was for Peter, the
[21:44] filling of the Holy Ghost. It was a
[21:45] Pentecostal experience of a conversion.
[21:48] Amen.
[21:49] And we hear a lot about apostolic. We
[21:51] hear a lot about Pentecostal and about
[21:53] Pentecost. But let me tell you
[21:54] something. If it isn't a new birth, it's
[21:58] the wrong kind of Pentecost,
[22:00] right?
[22:01] If it isn't a new birth, then we're just
[22:03] being Pentecostal,
[22:05] because the Pentecostal experience is to
[22:07] be born again by the word of God.
[22:09] Brother Brandham said, and I have these
[22:10] statements here. We'll just pull these
[22:12] up. I think I may have lost control.
[22:13] I've lost control.
[22:16] I said to Elizabeth the other day, I
[22:17] said, "I think people think God's gone
[22:19] crazy." She says, "Why?" I said, "Well,
[22:20] they're always trying to find the mind
[22:21] of God.
[22:25] says, "We People are groaning."
[22:28] You know, I am a dad of four, right?
[22:32] Can't wait till I turn 40. I'm sure that
[22:34] dad humor is just going to take off.
[22:36] Says, "We experience Pentecost by the
[22:39] new birth."
[22:40] Amen.
[22:41] That's how we experience Pentecost, by
[22:43] the new birth. Now, you start connecting
[22:45] these principles. We've already covered
[22:47] the promise of the father, eternal life,
[22:49] conversion, filling with the Holy Ghost,
[22:51] baptized with the Holy Ghost. There's a
[22:52] lot of things that you can start uh
[22:54] connecting together. We experience
[22:55] Pentecost by the new birth. You're not
[22:58] going to experience it just by speaking
[22:59] in tongues, shouting, dancing, uh uh
[23:02] even in the working of miracles. You're
[23:03] not exper We experience Pentecost by the
[23:05] new birth.
[23:06] Then he says in another place, "And the
[23:08] new birth and the conversion itself is
[23:11] the Holy Ghost."
[23:12] I feel like it could just stop right
[23:14] there. The new birth AND THE CONVERSION
[23:16] ITSELF IS THE HOLY GHOST.
[23:18] You're not even converted till you get
[23:20] the Holy Ghost.
[23:22] Think about what brother Ram's trying to
[23:23] get us to getting out of this church
[23:25] experience. Just get us out of religious
[23:27] experiences. Get out just being, you
[23:29] know, just being a certain way. The the
[23:31] you're not even converted till you get
[23:33] the Holy Ghost.
[23:34] Then he says this, "Oh, okay. I'm just
[23:37] going to let you take control. You're
[23:38] doing great. You're the pilot. I'm not
[23:40] even a co-pilot. I'm just sitting back
[23:41] in coach eating my peanuts."
[23:45] He says, "You're believing unto eternal
[23:47] life." When you believe and you're a
[23:49] believer and you believe in the word of
[23:51] God, you're just believing unto
[23:54] eternal life. But when the Holy Spirit
[23:56] comes, it is eternal life.
[23:59] Can you see the simple algebra I'm
[24:00] trying to do today? That the gift of God
[24:02] is eternal life. And now we have the
[24:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost or the filling
[24:06] of the Holy Ghost. And brother Bam is
[24:08] saying that the Holy Ghost is eternal
[24:10] life. right?
[24:12] That if you're believing, maybe you're
[24:14] potentially you're you're a potential
[24:16] candidate to receive eternal life, but
[24:18] it's not until the Holy Spirit comes
[24:20] that you actually receive eternal life
[24:22] because THE HOLY SPIRIT IS eternal life.
[24:26] He says, "And now in this other place,
[24:27] what is eternal life?" I had some of
[24:28] these were just much larger quotes and I
[24:30] knew I was just going to be running out
[24:31] of time today and so I wanted to
[24:33] abbreviate these um so that I run out of
[24:35] time on other material. Says, "What is
[24:38] eternal life?" The Holy Spirit. eternal
[24:40] life. Take that word and run it in the
[24:43] Greek and it said Zoey. Zoey is the Holy
[24:47] Spirit.
[24:48] Amen.
[24:49] Now, these things I think I know they
[24:51] seem obvious based upon the response
[24:53] today. I think these are things that you
[24:55] understand and you believe, but I think
[24:56] it's important that we emphasize it as a
[24:58] young church
[24:59] that the Holy Spirit is eternal life. We
[25:01] understand what the gift is. And and I'm
[25:03] sure you all can be honest with me later
[25:05] and if you if you could recall these
[25:07] things. I feel that the Lord has really
[25:08] dealt with me a lot in the way of
[25:11] salvation over the past year or so,
[25:13] revisiting a lot of themes of salvation
[25:14] and a lot of things that are fundamental
[25:16] to us so that we can have this as part
[25:18] of our foundation and our bedrock as an
[25:20] assembly that these are things we
[25:21] believe in and these are the things we
[25:23] want to make available to others.
[25:24] Salvation, healing, all these things.
[25:27] But you may say, why is it important?
[25:31] If you misunderstand it, it'll keep you
[25:32] from it. Right.
[25:34] The reason why it's important to visit
[25:35] this, there may be some young people
[25:36] here who don't know what the Holy Ghost
[25:38] is, don't understand what eternal life
[25:40] is, and a misunderstanding can keep you
[25:43] from it.
[25:44] And and that's that's bad. That's why
[25:46] teaching this is important. Now, on the
[25:48] other hand, there may be some of you
[25:49] that have it but can't walk fully in it
[25:51] because you don't understand it.
[25:53] You're constantly torn between whether
[25:55] or not you need to be rebaptized or
[25:56] whether or not you need to be sealed or
[25:57] whether or not you've got this and
[25:58] whether or not you got that. And we need
[26:00] to understand if you've received the
[26:02] gift, you need to understand what that
[26:04] IS AND JUST ACCEPT it
[26:07] and quit questioning God
[26:10] a
[26:10] and not give into all this fear and
[26:12] scare because I I I know that I I I I've
[26:15] heard it I've heard it expressed before
[26:18] that there's such a fear there's such a
[26:21] fear to preach predestination plainly
[26:23] such a fear to preach election because
[26:25] because the fear that people will abuse
[26:26] it. Right?
[26:28] So what they're afraid of is abuse. And
[26:31] so what they do is they abuse the people
[26:33] with the wrong teaching on election OR
[26:35] PREDESTINATION OR BY NOT ESTABLISHING IT
[26:37] PLAINLY TO GIVE THE BELIEVER THE
[26:39] SECURITY TO BE WHAT THEY'RE CALLED TO BE
[26:42] WITHOUT the fear of failure, without the
[26:44] fear of being rejected.
[26:46] And so it's important to understand it
[26:47] so that none of you are kept from
[26:49] receiving it. But then it's also
[26:51] important that we understand so we can
[26:52] be walk more freely in it.
[26:55] in John chapter 6:es 39 and 40 and and
[26:59] you'll find a lot of this in in chapter
[27:00] 6 where Jesus is referring to these
[27:02] things
[27:05] and this is the father's will which hath
[27:07] sent me that all which he hath given me
[27:12] I should lose nothing so if you are
[27:14] elect if you are given he's not going to
[27:16] lose
[27:18] not going to lose but should raise it up
[27:20] again at the last day so now he's going
[27:22] there's going to be those that are
[27:23] received and Even if they die, they're
[27:26] coming up.
[27:27] That's what Paul was referring to that
[27:28] we're all going to appear. We're going
[27:29] to be made manifest in our true
[27:30] character before Christ. He says, "So
[27:32] there's those that God has given me.
[27:35] This is the will of God that I would not
[27:37] lose any that are ordained and they will
[27:39] come up in the resurrection." So he
[27:40] says, "And this is the will of him that
[27:42] sent me that everyone which seeth the
[27:44] son and believeth on him may have
[27:47] everlasting life, and I will raise him
[27:50] up at the last day."
[27:51] Amen. So eternal life, we understand
[27:53] this principle very very clearly.
[27:55] Eternal life is what entitles you to the
[27:57] first resurrection.
[27:58] Yeah.
[27:59] Right. What is it? The constant theme of
[28:01] the resurrection. If you have eternal
[28:02] life, you're going to come up in the
[28:03] resurrection. If it's the life of God,
[28:05] you're going to come up in the
[28:05] resurrection. You will come up in the
[28:07] first resurrection. You will be gathered
[28:09] together with all the elect to meet the
[28:10] Lord in the air. Eternal life is what
[28:12] entitles you. He says, "He that
[28:14] believeth on me, who has everlasting
[28:16] life, will be raised up in the last
[28:17] day." So eternal life entitles you to
[28:19] the resurrection. This is the gift of
[28:21] God.
[28:22] This is one of the benefits to that gift
[28:24] is to come up in the resurrection.
[28:26] Abraham says this multiple places. I
[28:29] think this one may be in Bakersfield in
[28:30] the token. He says, "The Holy Ghost in
[28:32] you is the token that brings you from
[28:34] the grave
[28:36] because the token is God, the Holy
[28:38] Spirit, which is eternal life."
[28:39] Amen.
[28:41] Coming from the Greek word Zoe, which
[28:43] means God's own life in you.
[28:45] So the token is God. It is the Holy
[28:47] Spirit. It is eternal life.
[28:49] Amen.
[28:50] So if you have eternal life, you have
[28:52] God.
[28:53] If you have eternal life, you have the
[28:54] token. If you have ETERNAL LIFE, YOU
[28:56] HAVE the Holy Spirit.
[28:58] And so in Acts 11 15 to18, and I I
[29:01] struggle just exactly where to place
[29:03] this particular scripture
[29:06] um because it just seemed to fit in a
[29:07] number of different places. I hope it's
[29:09] not out of place here, but you could
[29:10] kind of see this being a uh maybe a
[29:13] culmination or the outpouring of what
[29:15] began on the day of Pentecost. Now
[29:16] you're seeing it being instituted in
[29:18] this gentile experience. And it says,
[29:20] "And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost
[29:22] fell on them as on us at the beginning
[29:26] because they heard the word and believed
[29:29] and that and God sealed that faith."
[29:30] Then remembered I the word of the Lord,
[29:32] how that he said John indeed baptized
[29:34] with water, but ye shall be baptized
[29:36] with the Holy Ghost.
[29:38] So what what happened as the Holy Ghost
[29:39] fell on them? They were baptized with
[29:41] the Holy Ghost. This is the promise of
[29:42] the father. This is the filling in verse
[29:45] 17. For as much then as God gave them
[29:47] the like gift as he did unto us who
[29:50] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. So
[29:52] what is Paul what is being recognized
[29:54] here that this is the gift of the Holy
[29:57] Ghost. This is the gift of God that was
[30:00] promised
[30:01] through Lord Jesus Christ. Uh what was I
[30:05] that I could withstand God. When they
[30:07] heard these things, they held their
[30:08] peace and glorified God, saying, "Then
[30:10] hath God also to the Gentiles granted
[30:14] repentance unto life." [snorts]
[30:16] This is a gift.
[30:18] Even the repentance was a gift.
[30:20] IT WAS THAT GODLY SORROW THAT LED HIM TO
[30:22] A GENUINE REPENTANCE. AND HERE Peter and
[30:24] the apostles WERE ALL ACKNOWLEDGING,
[30:26] "WOW,
[30:27] we we felt maybe entitled to it since we
[30:30] walked with him and suffered THE
[30:31] PERSECUTION AND WE WERE THERE ON THE DAY
[30:33] OF PENTECOST AND WE FELT IT WAS OURS
[30:35] BECAUSE WE'RE JEWS. BUT NOW THE PROMISE
[30:37] IS BEING POURED OUT ON THE GENTILES. AND
[30:39] WE SEE THAT GOD IS GIVING IT TO THEM.
[30:42] APART from any HISTORY IN THE LAW, APART
[30:44] FROM ANY BLOODLINE, apart from any
[30:46] works, ANY LABOR, APART from any
[30:48] history, WELL THE DISCIPLES may have
[30:49] reasoned, well, we did walk with them
[30:51] for three years, so maybe we earned it
[30:52] on the day of Pentecost. Or these were
[30:54] all Jews who had made their pilgrimage
[30:56] to Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
[30:58] Maybe that is what did it. And there
[30:59] might have been a lot of ideas THEY'VE
[31:01] PUT IN THEIR MIND as to what made the
[31:03] Jews better candidate candidates. BUT
[31:05] WHEN GOD CALLED THE GENTILES, THERE WAS
[31:07] NO WAY THEY COULD RATIONALIZE WITH IT.
[31:09] THIS GUY DIDN'T EVEN BELIEVE IN THE TRUE
[31:10] GOD A MOMENT AGO. BUT NOW I'M PREACHING
[31:12] THE WORD AND THEY believe it and they
[31:14] receive the same gift we did.
[31:16] Amen.
[31:17] What did God do? He had given them,
[31:19] granted them repentance unto eternal
[31:22] life.
[31:26] To those that believe, God gave them the
[31:28] like gift. What was the like gift? The
[31:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It was the
[31:32] gift of God.
[31:36] I'm emphasizing the gift today
[31:39] because I want us to I want us to fully
[31:41] understand what brother Brandon was
[31:42] meaning when he said far too little time
[31:45] is spent on laboring for the eternal
[31:46] rewards of God.
[31:48] And it's not it's too lightly esteemed.
[31:52] I would I do not want us to misplace
[31:55] what that is we're laboring for.
[31:57] Amen.
[31:57] And ever confuse it for the gift.
[32:00] Amen.
[32:01] to never think that we could somehow
[32:03] labor or earn eternal life.
[32:06] I'm emphasizing this morning the gift at
[32:08] the outset so we can realize we will
[32:10] never be able to earn eternal life by
[32:12] our works. It'll never happen.
[32:14] It's the rewards that are earned, not
[32:16] eternal life.
[32:18] The rewards of God and these eternal
[32:20] rewards and the gift of God are two
[32:22] different principles, two different
[32:24] promises.
[32:27] Now, this is this is one of these
[32:28] critical scriptures. I think I would
[32:30] join it with 2 Corinthians chapter 5:10.
[32:32] But to me, this is one of these critical
[32:34] scriptures when it comes to um judgment,
[32:37] the bride's judgment, and understanding
[32:39] what Paul is referring to when he speaks
[32:41] about us appearing before the judgment
[32:42] seat of Christ. It says in John 5:4,
[32:45] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[32:47] heareth my word and believeth on him
[32:49] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[32:52] shall not come into condemnation, but is
[32:54] passed from death unto life." So he that
[32:58] believeth has it's hath it's present
[33:01] possession. It's yours. You have it now.
[33:03] You have everlasting life or eternal
[33:05] life and shall not come into
[33:07] condemnation. What is that? Judgment.
[33:10] Brother man is very particular, very
[33:11] clear on this. And the scriptur is very
[33:13] clear that if you possess eternal life,
[33:15] you will not have to be judged for your
[33:18] sins. You will not have to be judged to
[33:20] be deemed worthy to enter into eternity
[33:23] because you already have eternal life.
[33:25] And therefore, you bypass judgment and
[33:28] you've passed from death already into
[33:30] life. This is present tense. If you if
[33:32] you have eternal life, you will not come
[33:34] before the white throne judgment. If you
[33:36] have eternal life, you will not go to a
[33:38] place of waiting in order for your soul
[33:39] to be judged. You've passed from death
[33:41] into unto life.
[33:42] So, when you receive the gift, there's
[33:44] no there's no judgment.
[33:46] There's no judgment for sin.
[33:48] And I want to and I want to come back to
[33:51] that sometime. But eternal life then
[33:53] what we want to recognize eternal life
[33:55] is the present possession of the born
[33:56] again believer.
[33:58] Eternal life is not a future reward for
[34:00] the born again believer. It is it is not
[34:02] something that you will uh receive at a
[34:04] future judgment. Eternal life is the
[34:07] present possession of a believer who has
[34:09] been born again.
[34:10] Amen.
[34:11] It's important to catch this. I know
[34:12] it's very simple. I know you all believe
[34:13] it, but maybe I just needed a service
[34:15] full of a lot of amens today.
[34:18] But it and and the better we can
[34:19] understand it, the better we can teach
[34:20] our children.
[34:21] Sure. better able we can witness to
[34:23] those that are hungry and thirsty for a
[34:24] change. Now, in the church age book
[34:27] chapter 4, there's a lengthy portion
[34:29] where brother Bam is dealing with people
[34:31] who've misunderstood him in his meetings
[34:33] when he would make altar calls and and
[34:36] he would call for the people to receive
[34:38] the Holy Ghost and there'd be a lot of
[34:40] he'd say the our Pentecostal brothers,
[34:41] they had their certain idea of how they
[34:43] thought that it should be and what
[34:44] brother Bam was trying to get him to do
[34:46] and he was saying, "I've been
[34:47] misunderstood. They've got it all
[34:48] wrong." And he was trying to make it
[34:49] clear what he meant when he said for the
[34:51] believer to come forward and be born
[34:53] again. And he says this, this is very
[34:55] plain English. Now to receive Christ is
[34:57] to receive his spirit. To re receive his
[35:00] spirit is to be born again. To receive
[35:02] his spirit is to be baptized with the
[35:04] Holy Ghost.
[35:06] And the critic says, I think Leel wrote
[35:09] that.
[35:10] But brother Brandham substantiated this
[35:12] over and over again in his ministry. To
[35:13] receive Christ is to receive his spirit.
[35:15] To receive a spirit is to be born again.
[35:16] to receive a spirit holy spirit is to be
[35:18] baptized with the holy ghost. So that to
[35:20] me is very very plain. What am I doing
[35:22] this for? Because that's the gift.
[35:24] Yes sir.
[35:25] The gift of God is eternal life. The
[35:27] Holy Ghost is a gift. These are things I
[35:30] want you to recognize. You don't work
[35:31] for that. You're ordained to it.
[35:35] You just you receive it. You yield to
[35:36] it. And brother Bam says in another
[35:38] place, I don't have it here, but you can
[35:40] keep that up. He says that Peter and any
[35:42] of the disciples never said you must be
[35:43] born again and then filled with the
[35:45] spirit.
[35:47] It's not taught in the Bible. Nowhere is
[35:48] it ever taught that you're born again
[35:50] and then filled the spirit. And so, so
[35:52] it it page 147 he says to understand
[35:54] what I've just said is to clear up why
[35:56] students have never ever found Paul
[35:59] saying at any time be born again and
[36:02] then be be spiritfilled. So Peter and
[36:04] none of the apostles now neither Paul
[36:06] ever said that you're born again and
[36:08] then filled with the Holy Spirit or
[36:10] you're born again and then baptized with
[36:11] the Holy Ghost as a seal as a
[36:12] conversion. said, "They have inferred it
[36:14] is there and they have put their own
[36:16] meanings to say it." And then brother
[36:18] Ram yells at us FOR SOME REASON. BUT
[36:20] SCRIPTURE DOES NOT SAY THAT.
[36:24] Jesus never said it either.
[36:27] Why? Because if you twist it just a
[36:29] little bit, it's a setup for works based
[36:31] salvation.
[36:33] Twist it just a little bit. It's a setup
[36:34] for worksbased baptism of the Holy Ghost
[36:36] to where now we're earning the gift of
[36:38] the Holy Ghost. We're earning the
[36:39] baptism. We're earning the seal. We're
[36:41] earning the filling.
[36:43] But scripture doesn't say it. The
[36:45] apostles didn't say it. Peter didn't say
[36:47] it. Paul didn't say it. Jesus didn't say
[36:49] it. Brother Bam didn't teach it.
[36:52] What Jesus taught, we could look in John
[36:54] chapter 3. We'll just read verse 15.
[36:56] We'll make reference to the context.
[36:59] This is a conclusion of his conversation
[37:01] with Nicodemus who wanted to know how he
[37:03] could have uh uh you know, how you know
[37:05] what he could do to have eternal life or
[37:07] the question that he's presenting. And
[37:10] he said, "We know that you would not be
[37:12] you could not do these things except you
[37:14] come come from God."
[37:24] Jesus
[37:26] Jesus is kind of the conclusion where
[37:28] Jesus says in verse 7, "You must be born
[37:30] again."
[37:30] And and and so he's answering to
[37:32] Nicodemus's inquiry. Well, we know that
[37:34] you're these things must be could not be
[37:36] so if you be had not come from God. So
[37:39] this is a conclusion of him telling
[37:41] Nicodemus that except a man be born
[37:43] again cannot see the kingdom of God. And
[37:46] then he says ye must marvel not when I
[37:47] say unto you you must be born again. His
[37:49] conclusion is that whosoever believeth
[37:51] in him should not perish but have
[37:53] eternal life. This is this is the
[37:57] conclusion that whosoever believeth in
[38:00] him should not perish but have eternal
[38:03] life.
[38:04] What is he referring to? He hasn't
[38:05] changed the subject,
[38:07] you have eternal life because you're
[38:09] born again.
[38:11] So then in John chapter 4 with the woman
[38:14] at the well in verse 14 he says but
[38:15] whosoever drinkketh of the water that I
[38:17] shall give him shall never thirst but
[38:20] the water that I shall give him shall be
[38:22] in him a well of water springing up into
[38:27] everlasting life.
[38:29] Think about what Jesus is saying. He
[38:30] that believeth shall not perish but have
[38:33] have eternal life. He that believeth uh
[38:35] has passed already from death into life
[38:39] should not perish, shall not come into
[38:40] condemnation. These are repetitive
[38:42] things. These aren't creating levels.
[38:44] These aren't different circumstances.
[38:45] They're all the same salvation for God's
[38:47] elect. And I shall give him this water
[38:50] and it shall do in him. It shall be in
[38:52] him a well of water springing up into
[38:55] everlasting life. And brother Brandham
[38:57] teaches us that this is the Holy Spirit
[38:58] that came at Pentecost. This outpouring
[39:01] of the Holy Ghost, this fill in the Holy
[39:02] Ghost. It is that well of water
[39:03] springing up into everlasting life. So
[39:06] the individual who has been born again
[39:07] has a well of eternal life inside of
[39:09] him. Has a wellspring a source of
[39:12] eternal life inside of him. Few chapters
[39:14] later in John 7:es 38 and 39 he says he
[39:17] that believeth on me as the scripture
[39:19] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[39:21] of living water. So in one place it's a
[39:23] well now it's a river. And so people who
[39:26] might want to uh strain on a net and
[39:28] swallow a camel start trying to divide
[39:30] this and make them two different things.
[39:32] But it's the same requirement. Believing
[39:36] believing is not going to perish.
[39:37] Believing is going to be have a well of
[39:39] water springing up. Believing is going
[39:40] to have out of his belly shall flow
[39:42] rivers of living water. What are these
[39:44] rivers? Thank God for the parenthetical
[39:46] phrase. But this spake he of the spirit
[39:48] which they that believe on him should
[39:50] receive.
[39:51] Amen. For the Holy Ghost was not yet
[39:53] given because that Jesus was not yet
[39:54] glorified.
[39:55] Amen.
[39:56] This is what's being referred to here.
[39:58] The gift The gift is to be born again by
[40:00] the spirit. The gift is to receive a to
[40:04] receive a a a life flow which is
[40:06] referred to as a a belly out of your
[40:08] belly flowing rivers of living water or
[40:10] a wellspring of water.
[40:14] This isn't this well and the river are
[40:17] one and the same.
[40:18] It's the same experience.
[40:20] One's not um one is not salvation and
[40:22] the other one's a blessing.
[40:25] There are gifts of the spirit which are
[40:27] outpoured and there gifts of the holy
[40:29] ghost that can be poured out upon people
[40:31] and people can receive them apart from
[40:33] any fundamental born again experience.
[40:36] But what Jesus is talking about is not
[40:37] just an anointing that comes and goes.
[40:40] He's talking about a a possession,
[40:43] eternal life, not a separate blessing.
[40:45] not not something separate that's coming
[40:46] coming along that anyone could operate
[40:48] in. But he's talking about the the well
[40:49] and the river one and the same. And what
[40:51] is it's eternal life
[40:53] in John chapter 17:es 2 and three as
[40:56] thou hast given him power over all
[40:58] flesh. He's speaking of himself the son
[41:00] of man that he should give eternal life
[41:02] to as many as thou hast given him. So if
[41:04] you are elect and you and he says you've
[41:06] been given to him and you're elect in
[41:08] him then you are to give you are to
[41:09] receive eternal life be given eternal
[41:11] life and this is life eternal that they
[41:14] might know thee the only true God and
[41:17] Jesus Christ whom thou has sent and what
[41:20] did Paul say that no man could say Jesus
[41:21] Christ is Lord but by the Holy Ghost.
[41:25] And Jesus saying that eternal life is to
[41:26] know God and Jesus Christ.
[41:30] So eternal life is the Holy Ghost. We
[41:32] can't you cannot separate the two.
[41:35] It's we have to be very very careful
[41:37] that we not separate things out just to
[41:39] and you know the brother Brandham
[41:40] identifies as the problem is experience
[41:42] is the problem. Right?
[41:44] And and a lot of people engage in this
[41:45] because they say, "Well, I believed I
[41:47] was saved when I was a Baptist, but then
[41:48] when I came to the message, I got the
[41:49] Holy Ghost." And they're just trying to
[41:51] make sense of their experience
[41:53] and say, "So that must have been when I
[41:54] was born again, or that must have been
[41:55] when I got saved, or I was in Pentecost,
[41:58] and and that's when this happened, but
[42:00] then when I came to the message, this
[42:01] happened." And away with experience is a
[42:03] plum line.
[42:05] We don't want to draw from truth. We
[42:07] don't want to develop truth out of
[42:08] anecdotal evidence. that the anecdotal
[42:10] testimonies should be brought back to
[42:12] truth to understand what it is we're
[42:13] believing on and what it is we we hold
[42:15] dear. And Jesus is telling us that to
[42:17] believe on him that what comes after
[42:20] believing is going to be an experience
[42:22] of being filled with the Holy Ghost. Is
[42:23] going to be the seal of God's elect. It
[42:25] is the the gift of God which is eternal
[42:27] life. It is the gift of God which is the
[42:29] Holy Spirit.
[42:32] And brother Brandham identifies it when
[42:34] he's teaching this in the church age
[42:35] book that the Baptists were wrong
[42:38] because they they
[42:41] felt that believing
[42:43] equaled the seal.
[42:47] And he's saying they're wrong because
[42:48] they think when they believe there
[42:49] there's that's it. Just believe and
[42:51] you've got it. There's no additional
[42:54] experience of being sealed.
[42:56] And they they think that eternal life
[42:59] comes in. They think that this eternal
[43:01] life just comes because you say that you
[43:02] believe. But then the Pentecostals, he
[43:04] says, are wrong because they thought you
[43:06] could have the birth without the seal.
[43:09] And he's saying, you guys are both
[43:10] wrong.
[43:11] And as long as you deviate from that,
[43:13] everything you're trying to do isn't
[43:15] going to line up. It's not going to
[43:16] match up. They think that life life
[43:19] comes in one place and then the seal
[43:21] comes later. And he said, "This isn't
[43:23] this isn't how it works. God's not going
[43:25] to give you eternal life and then take
[43:26] it away from you. Then give you eternal
[43:28] life and take it away from you. give you
[43:29] eternal life and take it away from you.
[43:30] That's not how God works.
[43:32] And so, he's correcting a lot in what
[43:34] he's teaching. And he and and he he he
[43:37] did a lot of things through his ministry
[43:39] to capture everyone and get us all on
[43:40] the same page in terms of what the new
[43:42] birth was and what the baptism of the
[43:43] Holy Ghost was. And it was because there
[43:45] were such extremes,
[43:47] right?
[43:48] A Baptist can use the phrase born again
[43:50] believer and doesn't even believe in the
[43:52] Holy Ghost.
[43:53] Right?
[43:54] I'm a born again believer and they don't
[43:56] believe in the baptism of the Holy
[43:57] Ghost. So, how would you answer a
[43:59] question? If a Baptist said something
[44:00] about being a born again, you'd have to
[44:02] say, "Well, you need the Holy Ghost,
[44:03] buddy."
[44:04] Right? You just got to take him where he
[44:06] lacks and bring him to what he needs.
[44:09] And so, the gift of God is eternal life,
[44:12] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[44:14] which is the new birth, which is to be
[44:16] born again, which is the gift,
[44:20] not reward,
[44:22] it's the gift.
[44:24] Ephesians chapter 1:13
[44:28] speaking of Christ in whom you also
[44:30] trusted after that you heard the word of
[44:31] truth the gospel of your salvation. So
[44:34] the word of truth is the gospel of your
[44:35] salvation and whom also after that ye
[44:37] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[44:40] Spirit of promise.
[44:41] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[44:43] seal of your faith.
[44:45] It is not just because you believe but
[44:48] it's after that you have believed. You
[44:51] say, "Well, I when I say not just
[44:52] because you believe." You don't believe
[44:54] you have it just because you believe.
[44:56] It's an experience of being born again.
[44:58] I know there's just a little tricky
[45:00] tricky area in there, but the best I
[45:02] could say it is there is a genuine
[45:03] experience to be filled with the Holy
[45:05] Ghost.
[45:06] An absolute genuine experience of
[45:08] meeting God face to face. So, after you
[45:11] heard the word of truth, after you
[45:12] believed, you were sealed with the Holy
[45:14] Spirit of promise.
[45:15] Now, this is not works. This is not your
[45:17] labor. This is not because you prayed
[45:18] right, because you terried long enough.
[45:20] This is has nothing to do with anything
[45:22] that you merited. God didn't look down
[45:25] upon all your efforts and all your labor
[45:27] and all your hard work and say, "You
[45:28] know what? I think you've earned the
[45:30] Holy Ghost."
[45:30] Right?
[45:32] He gives you the Holy Ghost as a gift
[45:35] after you heard the word and believed.
[45:37] And this is this is critical. And I I
[45:40] know that I've gone I'm long and I'm
[45:42] just going to try to to finish this. The
[45:45] Holy Spirit, this is important. Holy
[45:47] Spirit assures the believer of their
[45:49] relationship with God.
[45:50] Amen.
[45:51] That it is the it is it is assures not
[45:54] just your relationship but your eternal
[45:56] relationship with God.
[45:57] That's what the Holy Ghost is. It I love
[45:59] how God ordained it that way that I want
[46:01] to give you this permanent possession
[46:04] that it can always be there. And though
[46:05] you may grieve it and you may lose touch
[46:07] with it, it's a place that you've got to
[46:08] come back to as an anchor to remember
[46:11] that if I gave this to you, it is the
[46:13] token that you're mine and I'll never
[46:15] lose you. Amen.
[46:16] It is the token that you are my
[46:18] possession and you're coming up in the
[46:19] resurrection. It is it is the assurance
[46:22] of your relationship with God. It is and
[46:24] everybody get ready to clutch your
[46:26] pearls. Eternal security
[46:29] because the true believer has eternal
[46:32] security.
[46:34] And so this ETERNAL LIFE, THE BAPTISM OF
[46:36] THE HOLY GHOST, the seal of God, this
[46:37] new birth, it is sovereignly given by
[46:40] God according to election.
[46:42] It is the gift in Ephesians chapter 2:es
[46:45] 8 and N as Paul is saying that after you
[46:47] heard the word and believed you were
[46:48] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.
[46:50] He says for by grace are ye saved
[46:52] through faith. What was this salvation?
[46:54] It's the seal of the Holy Spirit of
[46:55] promise. You're saved through faith and
[46:58] that not of yourselves. It is a gift of
[47:01] God.
[47:01] Amen.
[47:03] Not of works lest any man should boast.
[47:06] What is this salvation? WHAT IS THIS
[47:08] HOLY GHOST? IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD.
[47:10] AMEN. there's no works. And he and I
[47:13] think he's just he says it he says it
[47:15] very very plain. The gift is not earned
[47:19] that nobody HAVING RECEIVED THE HOLY
[47:21] GHOST COULD SAY I THINK I I think I
[47:23] figured it out.
[47:24] I think I figured out this is what you
[47:25] need to do and this is how you need to
[47:27] do it. There's there's no way.
[47:29] There's absolutely no way. Even when we
[47:31] take and I and I realize now that I I
[47:33] think I took these statements out on my
[47:35] notes, but even when we take the uh the
[47:38] the three elements of the new birth, and
[47:40] it takes all three to be born again,
[47:42] justification, sanctification, baptism,
[47:44] Holy Ghost. If you lack any one of
[47:46] those, it's not the new birth, it's not
[47:47] to be born again. So, you have to have
[47:48] all three to be born again. But then
[47:51] what we do is kind of like in this
[47:52] Catholic mindset,
[47:54] we turn it into stations.
[47:56] Well, have you have you burned a candle
[47:58] at the justification altar? Right? And
[48:00] we almost feel that we've got to go
[48:01] through these steps to where nobody can
[48:03] get it until they've they've spent time
[48:06] going to these stations. Bre says it can
[48:08] all happen at once.
[48:11] Can I get a witness?
[48:12] Amen.
[48:13] Amen. It's happen. There's some of you
[48:15] WHO THERE THERE'S NO THERE was no season
[48:17] of justification. There's no season of
[48:19] sanctification. There was no God did I
[48:21] earn the Holy Ghost. IT WAS THE POWER OF
[48:23] GOD FALLING UPON A OPEN HEART THAT HAD
[48:25] YIELDED IN THE MOMENT. AND THE POWER OF
[48:27] GOD, THE WORD HAD SHIFTED THEIR MIND.
[48:29] AND THEY LOOKED TO CALVARY AND SAID,
[48:30] "GOD, THAT'S ME. FORGIVE ME OF MY SINS,
[48:32] LORD. SEAL ME IN YOUR KINGDOM." AND THE
[48:34] HOLY SPIRIT POURED OUT UPON THEM AND
[48:36] CHANGED THEIR LIFE.
[48:38] CAN HAPPEN JUST LIKE THAT. PASS FROM
[48:40] DEATH INTO LIFE.
[48:42] Happened in a moment. Happened in an
[48:43] instance.
[48:45] So the gift is not earned. It's not
[48:47] something you're owed because of your
[48:48] works.
[48:50] It's a gift of God.
[48:52] Amen. In Titus 3:es 5, 6, and 7, not by
[48:56] works of righteousness that we have
[48:58] done, but according to his mercy, he
[49:00] saved us.
[49:02] How did he save us? By the washing of
[49:04] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[49:06] Ghost. It's the word. This is your
[49:09] salvation. The renewing of the Holy
[49:11] Ghost is salvation. Can Can I Can I say
[49:13] this just to pro provoke some really
[49:15] good conversation at the lunch table?
[49:19] The bride alone is saved.
[49:22] Right.
[49:23] Amen.
[49:24] Right now, the bride alone is saved.
[49:28] Because she's been, and I say bride, you
[49:30] say, I don't know if I like that term.
[49:31] The elect, true Christians, those who
[49:33] have the Holy Ghost,
[49:35] the believers who's been sealed, they
[49:36] are the ones who have seen themselves
[49:38] renewed by the Holy Ghost, washing of
[49:40] regeneration according to his mercy. He
[49:43] saved us. Not works of righteousness
[49:45] that we have done, but mercy. And he
[49:46] says in verse six, which he shed on us
[49:48] abundantly through Jesus Christ our
[49:50] savior. What did he shed on us
[49:51] abundantly? THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS BEEN
[49:53] SHED UPON US. This is his grace. THIS IS
[49:55] HIS MERCY. THIS IS HIS GIFT that being
[49:58] justified by his grace, we should be
[50:00] made HES ACCORDING TO THE HOPE OF
[50:02] ETERNAL LIFE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THE
[50:04] eternal life that he's given you has
[50:06] birthed INSIDE OF YOU A GREAT HOPE.
[50:08] THE HOPE OF [screaming] WHAT IS THE HOPE
[50:10] OF ETERNAL LIFE? IT IS IF THE
[50:12] INHERITANCE IS TO COME. THE FACT THAT
[50:14] YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE IS THE EARNEST OF
[50:17] THE REDEMPTION OF THE FULL THING. THE
[50:19] FACT THAT YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. IT'S
[50:21] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT TELLS
[50:23] YOU THERE IS AN INHERITANCE TO COME.
[50:25] THERE ARE ETERNAL THINGS THAT ARE MINE.
[50:27] AND THAT'S THE HOPE OF THE ETERNAL LIFE
[50:29] THAT YOU'VE RECEIVED THROUGH THE POURING
[50:31] OUT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT INTO YOUR SOUL.
[50:32] AMEN.
[50:35] This eternal life is given by sovereign
[50:37] election.
[50:39] Brother Bam says it this way and I have
[50:41] heard but now I see. And he says in a
[50:42] number of places a similar way. If
[50:43] you've got eternal life, then the germ
[50:45] of eternal life was in God at the
[50:47] beginning. Amen.
[50:49] And you've had that seed from the
[50:51] beginning.
[50:52] It was always in you.
[50:54] And that's why you can be quickened.
[50:57] Only the elect can be born again.
[51:00] Right.
[51:00] I mean, I think it's very I think it's
[51:03] simple. Only the elect can be born
[51:06] again. Therefore, only the elect can
[51:07] have eternal life.
[51:09] Now,
[51:11] if God permits in judgment and rewards,
[51:13] we can visit the white throne judgment
[51:14] where many will receive eternal life on
[51:16] that day. Right.
[51:18] And they'll receive. They'll be saved
[51:20] according to what?
[51:22] Their works.
[51:24] But how did you get it?
[51:25] Yes, sir.
[51:26] By his work.
[51:28] By his price.
[51:30] You've received the the token that he
[51:32] paid for.
[51:34] You You can't brag about it at all. It's
[51:36] his election. It's his grace.
[51:39] If you've got eternal life, THAT GERM
[51:40] WAS IN GOD at the beginning. If you HAVE
[51:42] ETERNAL LIFE NOW, IT WAS ALWAYS WITH YOU
[51:44] FROM THE TIME THAT YOU were born. I
[51:46] THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I I I feel
[51:48] the liberty to express TO ALL OF US
[51:49] TODAY. THAT'S WHY YOUR LIFE ALWAYS
[51:51] SEEMED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
[51:53] IS BECAUSE DOWN INSIDE OF YOU THERE WAS
[51:55] A SEED, A GERM OF GOD CRYING OUT FOR
[51:57] EXPRESSION. SISTER JASMINE, SHE'S HERE.
[51:59] I THINK ABOUT HER HOW THAT PERHAPS HER
[52:01] WHOLE LIFE THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF
[52:03] HER MADE HER FEEL THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE
[52:04] MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS. THOSE OF YOU
[52:06] WHO'VE TRIED RELIGION, THOSE OF YOU
[52:08] TRIED CHURCHES, YOU'VE EVEN TRIED THE
[52:10] MESSAGE. THE MESSAGE WON'T DO IT. CHRIST
[52:12] IS WHO DOES IT
[52:14] BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE [screaming] ALONE
[52:16] THAT CAN GIVE YOU THIS ETERNAL LIFE.
[52:17] HE'S THE ONE ALONE THAT CAN SATISFY THE
[52:19] HUNGER OF THAT SEED.
[52:21] AMEN.
[52:22] YOU'RE BORN I LOVE HOW IT SAYS THE BIBLE
[52:25] SAYS AND ALL THAT WERE ORDAINED TO
[52:27] ETERNAL LIFE BELIEVED. YOU ARE BORN
[52:29] ORDAINED TO THIS FAITH. YOU ARE BORN
[52:31] ADDICTED TO THIS. AND THE ONLY THING
[52:33] THAT WOULD SATISFY IS TO RECEIVE IT.
[52:36] AMEN.
[52:40] It's the that elect germ inside of you
[52:43] that has been the hidden the hidden
[52:45] draw, the hidden power for your entire
[52:47] life. It's why you didn't die when you
[52:49] thought you would die because that seed
[52:51] had to come to life. It's why you
[52:52] haven't been taken when you thought
[52:53] you'd be taken because that seed needs
[52:55] to come to life.
[52:56] Amen.
[53:00] In Lukeap 11:13
[53:02] speaking of this relationship between
[53:05] parents to children and then the
[53:07] heavenly father he says if ye then being
[53:09] evil know how to give good gifts unto
[53:14] your children how much more shall your
[53:16] heavenly father give the holy spirit to
[53:18] them that ask him.
[53:23] This salvation is a free gift.
[53:26] It's not earned or due you because of
[53:28] your works.
[53:31] He wants to give it to us more than we
[53:32] want it.
[53:36] And I'm sure you all know how it is that
[53:39] if you you have a you buy someone a gift
[53:41] and you buy it too early, the temptation
[53:44] is just ah you know what? You just want
[53:46] to give it to them because you want to
[53:49] give it to them so bad.
[53:50] You you you just you you don't care if
[53:52] you spoil it. You want to give it to
[53:54] them so bad, you're willing to come up
[53:55] with some sort of lousy excuse to give
[53:57] it to them weeks early.
[53:59] Right?
[54:00] I did that with our kids. I I gave them
[54:02] a Christmas gifts in November and I used
[54:04] our trip to Europe for the convention as
[54:05] an excuse to give it to him. So what I
[54:08] have to do, buy more Christmas gifts,
[54:14] but he wants to give it to you more.
[54:17] More than you even wanted. Why? Because
[54:20] he's it's not anything you earned.
[54:23] Right?
[54:25] He can have this gift. He's anxious to
[54:27] give it to you. And he go, "But I've
[54:28] made mistakes and I've sinned and I've
[54:29] done this and I've done that and I've
[54:31] done this. I've done that." And and he's
[54:33] he's going,
[54:35] [snorts]
[54:36] "Okay,
[54:37] I had this for you before you did all
[54:38] that."
[54:40] Just so you knew I was going to give it
[54:41] to you no matter what you did, I put the
[54:43] germ in there to begin with.
[54:45] I I I basically I secured it be before
[54:49] the devil had a chance to get you. I'd
[54:51] get to you. I'd already swed you into
[54:52] the earth.
[54:54] I'd already laid out the plan of
[54:55] redemption. I knew you would do all
[54:57] that.
[54:58] So, I made a I made a plan in the
[55:00] beginning. And as a matter of fact, I
[55:02] hope you don't mind, but you had to do
[55:03] that so that you would know more about
[55:05] me
[55:06] than just a lord or just a a creator or
[55:09] just a sovereign. I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
[55:11] MY WHOLE HEART. AND SO, SO I I FORGIVE
[55:13] YOU OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE. I I FORGIVE YOU
[55:15] OF YOUR MISTAKES. I FORGIVE YOU OF YOUR
[55:17] TRESPASSES. IS A GOD THAT IS NOT LORDING
[55:19] OVER YOU USING HIS OWN WORD AS A WEAPON.
[55:22] I JUST DARE YOU TO MAKE A MISTAKE.
[55:24] NO, THAT'S NOT GOD. THAT'S NOT THE HEART
[55:26] OF CHRIST. CHRIST WANTS YOU TO COME TO
[55:29] HIM. CHRIST WANTS YOU TO YIELD TO HIM.
[55:32] AND HE WOOS YOU WITH LOVE, [screaming]
[55:33] NOT HARSHNESS, NOT BITTERNESS.
[55:36] HE'S WOOING YOU. HE'S BREAKING YOU DOWN
[55:38] THROUGH HIS UNRELENTING, UNCONDITIONAL
[55:41] LOVE. AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS HE'S
[55:44] OFFERED IT TO US. MAYBE WE JUST NEED TO
[55:46] ASK HIM FOR IT. AND SAY, "LORD, I I
[55:48] RECEIVE YOUR FORGIVENESS. LORD, OH GOD,
[55:51] FORGIVE ME. GIVE ME THIS BLESSED GIFT."
[55:54] AMEN.
[55:55] LORD, I NEED IT.
[55:57] AMEN.
[56:00] I wonder if you've received it. You
[56:02] young men, you young ladies, you you
[56:05] don't forget this. It's the most
[56:08] important thing there is
[56:10] to receive this gift. Amen.
[56:15] And if you have it, do you know what it
[56:16] is?
[56:18] Is the devil constantly trying to take
[56:20] you and say, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
[56:21] no, no. You're down here."
[56:24] So, Brother Brandham said this and the
[56:26] Bible says this. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[56:27] You're down here.
[56:30] You know, one thing that I
[56:34] I I God help me to say this, right?
[56:38] But if you don't hate the devil, this is
[56:39] one reason to hate him.
[56:41] is he always try to tries to make you
[56:43] feel broken
[56:45] and then present himself as the one that
[56:47] can fix you
[56:49] and that nature of the devil to always
[56:51] make you feel compromised but he's the
[56:52] one that got has the solution to the
[56:54] problem that's the devil
[57:00] lengthy quote to close on in the message
[57:02] the token
[57:05] said God's everlasting eternal token
[57:07] it's eternal life
[57:09] by the eternal God and anything that had
[57:12] a beginning has an end. And everything
[57:14] that had a beginning besides God and
[57:16] everything had a beginning besides God.
[57:18] So the things that are eternal are the
[57:21] eternal
[57:23] attributes of God
[57:25] made manifest by the spoken word,
[57:28] right? Which you are
[57:31] which the earth is heaven earth, right?
[57:34] That's where you realize that there's
[57:35] going to be those eternal spoken word
[57:36] attributes of God that to them alone
[57:39] pertains this promise of perpetuity and
[57:41] eternity. And then this is such a
[57:44] beautiful thing. Then you sustain
[57:47] because you remember even in the eighth
[57:49] day in in eternal there's those that are
[57:50] being have partake of the tree of life
[57:53] to be to to s for the healing of the
[57:54] nations to sustain them.
[57:56] Like come on, think about it. You're
[57:58] going to be the only ones with the
[57:59] glorified body,
[58:01] right?
[58:02] that do you ha recognize who you are.
[58:06] Recognize who you are in Christ. Think
[58:08] think more deeply about what salvation
[58:10] is. Let's not create a cast system
[58:12] within the body of Christ
[58:14] to where now we we relegate ourselves to
[58:16] some other level of a believer so that
[58:19] we can be we can feel that we're broken
[58:20] so that some false doctrine is going to
[58:22] fix us. No. Listen to what he's saying.
[58:25] And God is the only form of eternal life
[58:26] there is. And when God places his holy
[58:29] spirit in you, which is God, and when
[58:30] God places himself within you, you are
[58:32] eternal as God is because you're a part
[58:35] of him because you become a son or
[58:36] daughter of God. And you're DISPLAYING
[58:38] HIS WORD. HALLELUJAH. I FEEL RELIGIOUS.
[58:41] THAT'S TRUE. GOD IDENTIFIES IN HIMSELF.
[58:43] YOU'VE GOT ETERNAL LIFE. AND THAT'S GOD
[58:45] IN YOU.
[58:47] And this word is God. And that word
[58:50] lives and PRODUCES ITSELF JUST EXACTLY
[58:52] what God has ordained for this age. You
[58:54] have it. Amen. the Holy Ghost. The Holy
[58:56] Spirit being displayed.
[58:59] That's and that's maybe at the crux of
[59:01] even this the next step and these
[59:03] things. IT'S THE HOLY GHOST NOW. IT IT
[59:07] WANTS to live through you and be
[59:09] expressed.
[59:10] It's just begun. WHEN YOU'RE BORN AGAIN,
[59:13] WHEN YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, YOU'VE JUST
[59:14] BEGUN. NOW, IT WANTS TO GROW INTO AN
[59:16] EXPRESSION.
[59:18] He says, "WHAT IS IT?" THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[59:21] THE word has been quickened to you by
[59:22] the Holy Spirit to vindicate this age
[59:25] that you've passed from death unto life.
[59:27] And now you're his. OH, BECAUSE HE IS.
[59:30] We have the right to all that he has
[59:32] purchased for us. EVERY PROMISE IN THE
[59:35] BIBLE IS YOURS. SO NOW this is important
[59:38] to catch this that if you have the gift,
[59:40] YOU GET THE BENEFITS of the gift.
[59:42] GOD, THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE
[59:44] YOU'VE GOT THE CARD, BUT YOU GOT TO
[59:46] SPEND SO MANY POINTS, SO MANY DOLLARS TO
[59:48] GET THE BENEFITS. THERE. THIS IS
[59:50] SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO RECOGNIZE. WITH
[59:52] THE GIFT COMES BENEFITS. WITH THE GIFT
[59:54] COMES THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU
[59:56] NOW. RIGHT NOW, AS A BELIEVER, THERE ARE
[59:58] THINGS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE
[1:00:00] GIFT.
[1:00:01] AMEN.
[1:00:03] Every promise in the Bible is yours.
[1:00:07] I I I have a a dear friend, Brother Jim
[1:00:09] Kingston, that refuses to sing, "Every
[1:00:10] promise in the book is mine." Because he
[1:00:12] says, "Some of them in there ain't for
[1:00:14] me." I go, "Those aren't promises. Those
[1:00:16] are threats or curses." [laughter]
[1:00:18] And so I intentionally one time sang
[1:00:20] that song after I preached for him. And
[1:00:22] that's why God had to beat so much out
[1:00:24] of me.
[1:00:26] I cringed thinking about myself.
[1:00:31] [clears throat] EVERY PROMISE IN THE
[1:00:32] BIBLE IS YOURS. IT belongs to you.
[1:00:37] When this token is upon you
[1:00:39] and God has sealed you, say you have a
[1:00:41] right to everything it's purchased.
[1:00:42] Every promise is yours and it belongs to
[1:00:44] you when this token is upon you. eternal
[1:00:46] life, the Holy Ghost, God has sealed
[1:00:48] you. Now, we want to check ourselves
[1:00:51] just for a moment.
[1:00:53] When God has given you the true baptism
[1:00:55] of the Holy Spirit, then the life of
[1:00:57] Jesus Christ is within you.
[1:01:00] That's true. And every theologian will
[1:01:02] have to admit that to be yes, sir. It's
[1:01:04] the new birth. You are born a new of the
[1:01:07] Holy Ghost. And because that God has
[1:01:10] done this AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE NO GOOD IN
[1:01:12] YOURSELF AND YOU ACCEPT WHAT GOD HAS
[1:01:14] DONE, WHAT DOES IT SAY? IT'S NOT MY
[1:01:15] WORKS. It's not my merit. It's not my
[1:01:17] worth. Then he seals YOU INTO HIS
[1:01:18] KINGDOM BY THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:01:21] AND EVERYTHING I'M JUST THIS IS WHERE
[1:01:23] I'M ENDING. EVERYTHING THAT JESUS
[1:01:25] purchased and promised you in the Bible
[1:01:27] is yours. IT'S YOUR PROPERTY BECAUSE
[1:01:29] IT'S PAID FOR.
[1:01:31] OH, TALK ABOUT HAVING THE RIGHT ATTITUDE
[1:01:33] TOWARDS THE GIFT WHERE THERE'S NO UH
[1:01:35] THERE'S NO SELFISHNESS INJECTED INTO IT.
[1:01:37] THERE'S NO WRONG SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT.
[1:01:39] THERE'S NO LEISIA ATTITUDE COMING BEFORE
[1:01:42] THE THRONE. YOUR BOLDNESS IS HONESTY
[1:01:44] THAT YOU NEED IT. THAT YOUR BOLDNESS IS
[1:01:47] THIS REVELATION THAT YOU NEED IT AND HE
[1:01:49] PROMISED IT TO YOU. OH, WHEN YOU COME
[1:01:51] WITH THE RIGHT ATTITUDE, HE SAYS AND
[1:01:53] EVERYTHING HE PURCHASED IN THE BIBLE IS
[1:01:55] YOURS. IT'S YOUR PROPERTY BECAUSE IT'S
[1:01:57] PAID FOR. LIFE IS MINE. HE PAID FOR IT.
[1:02:00] LIFE IS YOURS. HE PAID FOR IT. HEALED IS
[1:02:02] MINE. HE PAID FOR IT. HE IS YOURS. HE
[1:02:04] PAID FOR IT. FREEDOM IS MINE. HE PAID
[1:02:06] FOR IT. HEAVEN IS MINE. HE PAID FOR IT.
[1:02:08] AMEN.
[1:02:09] AMEN.
[1:02:09] AMEN.
[1:02:10] DO YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE
[1:02:12] PRICE FOR YOUR HEALING? WE'VE GOT TO GET
[1:02:14] THAT IDEA OUT OF OUR MINDS THAT SOMEHOW
[1:02:16] SOMEWAY I'VE GOT TO SUFFER TO EARN IT.
[1:02:19] I'VE GOT TO PAY FOR IT TO GET IT. NO,
[1:02:21] YOU GOT TO BELIEVE IN THE TOKEN TO GET
[1:02:22] IT.
[1:02:24] HE'S PAID THE PRICE. EVERYTHING HE
[1:02:26] purchased belongs to the man that holds
[1:02:28] the token. Amen.
[1:02:31] We got to free ourselves from the
[1:02:32] legalistic bondage of thinking we can
[1:02:35] earn God's love and respect.
[1:02:37] Earn his approval, earn our healing,
[1:02:39] earn our deliverance.
[1:02:43] You may reap what you sow,
[1:02:46] but you don't have to sow to be healed.
[1:02:48] That's right.
[1:02:50] I believe Satan has just so twisted up
[1:02:53] the teaching of salvation
[1:02:57] in order to cause the saved to live
[1:02:58] below their power.
[1:02:59] Yes, sir.
[1:03:02] by devaluing eternal life, devaluing the
[1:03:05] token
[1:03:06] so that when things don't happen
[1:03:09] and and you struggle, you get that you
[1:03:12] get sick or you you certain things
[1:03:14] happen and the devil just likes to pour
[1:03:16] it on you. Instead of standing upon the
[1:03:19] promise that I've got the token and it's
[1:03:21] a right to everything I paid for, the
[1:03:23] devil just introduces to you another
[1:03:25] level.
[1:03:25] Right? Well, maybe
[1:03:29] maybe you have eternal life, but maybe
[1:03:31] what you need is to join my MLM
[1:03:37] get baptized again,
[1:03:38] right?
[1:03:39] And really get the Holy Ghost this time,
[1:03:42] right? You know how you know how many
[1:03:44] people have been baptized unto new
[1:03:45] doctrines,
[1:03:46] rebaptized under new ideas?
[1:03:53] He either wants to save to live below
[1:03:56] the power that God's given you.
[1:04:00] And therefore, it becomes a struggle to
[1:04:02] operate the power of God. You might even
[1:04:04] have you might even be certain you have
[1:04:06] the token, but you keep looking at it
[1:04:07] thinking, "Do I have a right to use it?
[1:04:10] I prove myself well enough yet?" What
[1:04:13] does the token represent? Not your
[1:04:15] payment.
[1:04:15] Yes, sir.
[1:04:16] Right.
[1:04:17] The token is a gift. That's why
[1:04:20] sometimes people they they see something
[1:04:22] that you have that's really nice and I'm
[1:04:24] like that was a gift. Right?
[1:04:27] I couldn't have afforded that. Right?
[1:04:29] Like hey that's kind of why in a way I
[1:04:32] have this rule that don't let someone
[1:04:34] pay for you something that you couldn't
[1:04:36] buy on your own.
[1:04:38] Right? Because it's just like this this
[1:04:40] I don't know I don't even think it's a
[1:04:41] really a wisdom necessarily but it's
[1:04:42] just one of those things I have in my
[1:04:43] mind. Someone offered one time to buy
[1:04:45] something for me. They said just pick it
[1:04:46] out. So, I was going to pick something
[1:04:47] out that I could afford,
[1:04:49] right? Cuz I didn't want I was going to
[1:04:50] pick out something expect someone to pay
[1:04:52] for something that I couldn't pay for
[1:04:53] myself. I don't know where I'm at right
[1:04:54] now. I'll get back. All right.
[1:04:57] But when we have that token,
[1:04:59] if we try to attach any of our own merit
[1:05:01] to it,
[1:05:03] and and present it as if we earned it,
[1:05:06] I deserve it, IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE. RIGHT?
[1:05:10] AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE
[1:05:11] TRYING TO USE IT THAT WAY, but they've
[1:05:13] got THIS THEIR OWN SELFISHNESS BEHIND IT
[1:05:15] AND IT'S NOT GOING TO OPERATE. AND THEN
[1:05:17] ON THE OTHER HAND, AND MAYBE I'M TRYING
[1:05:18] to take people FROM TWO DIFFERENT SIDES.
[1:05:20] ON THE OTHER HAND, PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT
[1:05:22] TO USE IT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T FULLY
[1:05:24] ACCEPTING THAT CHRIST PAID THE PRICE.
[1:05:26] AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO EARN THE UTILITY
[1:05:28] OF IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO EARN THE POWER
[1:05:31] OF IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT IT AND
[1:05:33] PRESENT IT.
[1:05:35] OH, JUST BACK TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:05:38] [screaming] BACK TO THE WORD OF GOD THAT
[1:05:40] LIFTS THE BRIDE UP TO THE PLACE THAT SHE
[1:05:42] OUGHT TO BE IN. BACK TO THE WORD OF GOD
[1:05:44] WHICH IS OUR MEASURING STICK. BACK TO A
[1:05:46] PENTECOSTAL EXPERIENCE OF BEING BORN
[1:05:48] AGAIN. BACK TO PRESENTING THE TOKEN.
[1:05:50] BACK TO LIVING FOR CHRIST.
[1:05:54] And not be beat up and bullied into
[1:05:57] hiding our token.
[1:06:01] But knowing that if we have it and it's
[1:06:02] on display, I can't take credit for it.
[1:06:06] I can't take credit for it.
[1:06:08] He purchased it. Oh, wow. Where did you
[1:06:10] get that awesome token? Oh, Christ gave
[1:06:13] it to me.
[1:06:15] You mean you didn't buy that nice watch?
[1:06:17] Nope. It was a gift.
[1:06:18] Wow. Where'd you get that? It was a
[1:06:20] gift.
[1:06:22] You don't need No, there's no pretense.
[1:06:24] Don't need to make people think you know
[1:06:26] more or have more. No, this was a gift.
[1:06:28] Amen.
[1:06:30] The gift of God is eternal life which is
[1:06:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:06:34] the filling of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:06:36] the new birth which is to be born and
[1:06:38] which is the seal. It's all the gift
[1:06:40] and don't cheat cheat God or cheaten it
[1:06:44] by thinking you can earn it.
[1:06:45] Amen.
[1:06:46] I thank God for the gift.
[1:06:50] Amen. And maybe you can thank God for
[1:06:51] the gift of closing.
[1:06:53] My dad used to always tell me that the
[1:06:55] gift to preach was not getting started.
[1:06:56] It was stopping.
[1:07:00] I don't know if he meant like completely
[1:07:01] like quit preaching.
[1:07:04] Um, but I'm I'm I'm going to stop right
[1:07:06] now. Could we stand together?
