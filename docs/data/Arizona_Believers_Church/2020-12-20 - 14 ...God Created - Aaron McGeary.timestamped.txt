[0:00] let's turn our Bibles now Genesis
[0:01] chapter 3: 14-
[0:04] 21 so nice to see all of you out out in
[0:08] the house of the Lord today Genesis 3:14
[0:11] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[0:14] because thou Hast done this Thou Art
[0:16] cursed above all cattle and above every
[0:18] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[0:21] thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
[0:23] days of thy life we saw even how this is
[0:26] connected with death and what the
[0:28] serpent had sown into Humanity and to
[0:30] mankind it's the serpent eating the
[0:32] Flesh and has a and the sin now has a
[0:35] right to this body and I will put enity
[0:38] between thee and the woman and between
[0:40] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[0:42] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[0:45] under the woman he said I will greatly
[0:47] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[0:49] in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[0:51] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[0:53] husband and he shall rule over thee and
[0:56] unto Adam he said because thou Hast
[0:58] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and
[1:01] Hast eaten of the tree of which I
[1:03] commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat
[1:04] of it cursed is the ground for thy sake
[1:07] in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the
[1:09] days of thy life Thorns also and thistle
[1:12] shall it bring forth to thee and thou
[1:13] shalt eat the herb of the field in the
[1:16] sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
[1:18] till thou return unto the ground for out
[1:20] of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art
[1:22] and unto dust shalt thou return and Adam
[1:25] called his wife's name Eve because she
[1:28] was the mother of all living
[1:30] unto Adam also and to his wife did the
[1:32] Lord God make coats of skins and clothe
[1:35] them amen you may be
[1:37] seated I'm just excited about the word
[1:40] of the Lord this morning and appreciate
[1:42] the atmosphere that you've been able to
[1:44] create just through your worship and
[1:45] your expectation continued on the
[1:48] subject of God created and it is I do
[1:51] have it was very uh special for me just
[1:54] to see how this kind of converged uh to
[1:57] this point we've been pondering um theme
[2:00] of seeing the new birth in the beginning
[2:03] and also uh uh just some of the elements
[2:07] with respect to Christ and his birth and
[2:09] we had kind of put some of those things
[2:11] aside but it just seemed like God just
[2:13] converged it to where I believe I'm able
[2:14] to preach a Christmas message to you
[2:16] today and a message that would focus and
[2:18] give honor to the birth of Christ but
[2:20] it's in this thought of in the beginning
[2:23] God created and as we've been looking at
[2:26] these first few chapters of the Bible
[2:29] and of the book of Genesis we've seen
[2:30] that God's purpose who he is and his
[2:33] character his nature and his very
[2:35] essence and even his reason to exist
[2:37] could not be satisfied or his purpose
[2:40] his will who he is could not be revealed
[2:42] without Redemption so when you read
[2:44] Genesis chapter 1 and you read Genesis
[2:46] chapter 2 Redemption is actually hidden
[2:49] Mystery because in everything that we
[2:51] read in Genesis chapter 1 and Genesis
[2:53] chapter 2 it's an evolution of
[2:55] perfection it's Perfection upon
[2:57] Perfection and Mankind is described is
[3:00] being in the garden naked but not
[3:01] ashamed and it's the Perfection of
[3:04] perfection it's it's it's Beauty it's
[3:06] Holiness it's perfect love there's no
[3:08] fear there's no death and so it'd be
[3:10] very hard to perceive redemption in that
[3:13] picture but yet that's the picture God's
[3:15] painting it's a mystery hidden there in
[3:18] Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2 and as
[3:20] we've been looking at Genesis chapter 1
[3:22] verse 28 how that God commanded the man
[3:25] and the woman to be fruitful multiply
[3:27] and replenish the Earth and subdue it
[3:29] and then they to have dominion over all
[3:31] things we saw that how Redemption would
[3:34] not allow Genesis 1:28 this need for God
[3:37] to be Redeemer would not allow Genesis 1
[3:40] 128 to be fulfilled without suffering
[3:43] that there had to be a loss of this
[3:45] command a loss of this blessing this is
[3:47] not something that man would have be e
[3:50] be able to grasp easily or just walk
[3:52] into and fulfill God's need to be a
[3:56] redeemer required that Genesis 1 128 not
[3:59] be fulfilled unless there was suffering
[4:02] and this was necessary to bring about
[4:04] God's purpose this was get to give God
[4:06] reason to exist and those are just some
[4:09] statements and elements we're bringing
[4:10] together here at the beginning just to
[4:13] kind of uh understand where we are in
[4:15] this track or this trajectory that we're
[4:17] on so when mankind Falls Genesis 1:28
[4:21] this blessing this command uh this
[4:23] empowerment that's given to them in
[4:24] Genesis 1:20 is taken away from Mankind
[4:28] and we understand that no no mortal no
[4:30] human being had ever fulfilled this
[4:32] commandment or this blessing Genesis 1
[4:35] 128 is given to Adam and the woman but
[4:37] the man and the woman never fulfill any
[4:40] part of this command when it comes to be
[4:42] fruitful multiply replenish the Earth
[4:45] and subdue it this blessing is taken
[4:47] away from mankind but when God makes a
[4:50] promise he's going to keep it amen and I
[4:53] want to I want to just stay in this area
[4:56] maybe for several moments here at the
[4:58] beginning if God says he's going to do
[5:00] something then God's going to keep it
[5:02] and Genesis 1: 26-30 I read it as a
[5:06] covenant with creation that God is not
[5:09] just kind of throwing things out there
[5:11] in a list of house rules but this is a
[5:13] covenant that God's making with creation
[5:15] and and it has a if you will I will
[5:18] component to it as God made a
[5:20] conditional Covenant with Adam but
[5:22] rather what God says here in Genesis 1:
[5:26] 26-30 represents something that God is
[5:28] covenanting with creation and not saying
[5:31] that it's going to be lost forever but
[5:33] rather I have spoken this this is the
[5:35] way that I want it to be and it is going
[5:38] to be amen it's God's covenant with
[5:41] Creation in Isaiah chter 45: 23 he says
[5:45] I have sworn by myself the word is gone
[5:48] out of my mouth in righteousness and
[5:51] shall not return and and the the
[5:53] phraseology that you use there it's not
[5:55] going to be empty it's not going to be
[5:57] uh uh unsatisfied it's going to be
[5:59] satisfied the word has gone out of my
[6:00] mouth that which I have spoken is not
[6:03] going to come back and say well it
[6:05] didn't do what it was supposed to he
[6:06] says but my word goes out of my mouth it
[6:08] shall not return that unto me every knee
[6:11] shall bow and every tongue shall swear
[6:13] God's the only one that can say this
[6:15] that anything he says will not fall to
[6:16] the ground man is known to be a liar man
[6:19] will fail you man says things with great
[6:22] sincerity and can promise things and it
[6:24] not not come to pass despite his great
[6:26] efforts but there's something about the
[6:29] word that goes out of God's mouth and
[6:31] this is why we worship him because he's
[6:34] God we worship him because he's God I I
[6:37] we don't even worship him because he
[6:38] loves us that just makes the worship
[6:41] sweeter we worship him because he's God
[6:43] he's the one true God whatever he says
[6:45] is truth whatever he does is just that's
[6:47] why we worship him because he's God and
[6:50] the word that goes out of his mouth is
[6:52] not like the words of man but it's
[6:53] accompanied with Divine
[6:56] energy When God Says something that
[6:58] there's something behind it there's
[7:00] weight and substance to what he says so
[7:02] what he says when God makes a covenant
[7:04] with creation God's going to keep that
[7:06] Covenant the very next chapter in Isaiah
[7:09] chter 46: 10 to1 says God declaring the
[7:13] end from the
[7:14] beginning and from ancient times the
[7:17] things that are not yet done saying my
[7:20] counsel notice just how beautiful this
[7:23] is my counsel shall stand and I will do
[7:26] all my pleasure amen what he says will
[7:29] stand and it's sure it's firm and
[7:31] whatever he wants he
[7:33] gets I will do all my pleasure that this
[7:37] is what I want I'm going to get it I'm
[7:38] going to have what I want I'm going to
[7:40] get what I want calling a ravenous bird
[7:42] from the East the man that executeth my
[7:44] counsel from a far country yay I have
[7:47] spoken it I will also bring it to pass I
[7:50] have purposed it I will also do it
[7:53] notice how the scripture is standing for
[7:55] something that when God speaks something
[7:57] God says something will be it's going to
[7:59] happen regardless of how long it takes
[8:02] for it to happen it's going to happen
[8:04] it's the lesson we learned from the
[8:05] message the trial that brother Brandon
[8:07] preaches uh several times that when God
[8:09] makes a promise no matter how many years
[8:11] it takes God's going to bring it to pass
[8:15] that When God Says something you can
[8:16] Bank on it you can count on it you can
[8:17] trust it you can rest in it when God
[8:20] makes a promise Genesis 1: 26-30 even
[8:23] Genesis 12 is God's covenant with
[8:25] creation it is a promise that will not
[8:27] be left unsatisfied it will not return
[8:30] the word has gone out of his mouth my
[8:32] counsel shall stand I will do all my
[8:33] pleasure I've spoken it I will bring it
[8:36] to pass I've purposed it I will do
[8:39] it every word of God is a seed then that
[8:43] has an energy to it has a power to it
[8:44] that's sealed within it and that God has
[8:48] the power in his word to bring it to
[8:51] pass it's a principle that brother Bram
[8:53] uses in God's power of transformation or
[8:55] the power to transform or power of
[8:57] transformation
[8:59] he deals with how there's life and power
[9:01] within the seed to bring it to pass now
[9:04] this uh this quote is very
[9:07] lengthy and I I wanted to trim it but
[9:10] the more I tried to find a place to trim
[9:11] it the bigger it got so I just had to
[9:13] stop at some point but it's lengthy but
[9:15] I want to read it to you because it
[9:16] it'll help lay this
[9:18] foundation for where we're headed today
[9:21] and that's what God did for Adam and Eve
[9:23] he created this Garden of Eden he spoke
[9:26] it it was in his mind and when he says
[9:29] it then it has to happen he says bear
[9:32] that on mind now when he says it must
[9:35] happen nothing can hinder it nothing can
[9:39] keep it from happening there's nothing
[9:41] that can keep it from happening God said
[9:43] so that settles it God said it it's
[9:46] going to
[9:47] happen this is a promise this is
[9:50] something that encourages us he says now
[9:52] he had all this in his mind and he said
[9:54] let there be now that's Genesis 1 see
[9:57] Let There be this and let there be that
[9:58] let there be
[9:59] he was sowing seed Let It Be Here let it
[10:02] be here let it be here and he knew it
[10:05] was going to be that way because it
[10:07] cannot
[10:08] change now as we as we arrive to this
[10:11] spot notice he's saying when he says it
[10:13] it has to happen what he says it must
[10:15] happen nothing can hinder it nothing can
[10:17] keep it happening there's nothing to
[10:18] keep it from happening God said so that
[10:19] settles it it's going to
[10:21] happen this is something that when God
[10:24] speaks something it must come to
[10:26] pass it's going to be that way because
[10:28] it cannot changed now bring this into
[10:31] your heart and hold this at the center
[10:32] of what we're ministering today now that
[10:34] gives us Faith then and what he said
[10:37] here is going to be so let's let that
[10:40] seed fall into our hearts that we might
[10:43] be the bedding ground of that see it
[10:45] into our hearts and let us act out this
[10:48] place that he has placed Us in in the
[10:51] last days let the word come into the
[10:53] beding ground of your heart by faith
[10:55] believing that whatever God has spoken
[10:57] is going to come to pass we might as
[10:59] well say Let It Be Me amen God you said
[11:02] you're going to do it then do it in me
[11:05] let it happen to me be it unto me
[11:07] according to Thy word it gives us faith
[11:09] that whatever God has spoken we could
[11:11] just open up and say Lord you said
[11:13] there's going to be then let it be in me
[11:15] let us act out this place that he's
[11:17] placed Us in in the last days so now
[11:19] there's a an act that we're doing in our
[11:22] place in these last days he says see let
[11:23] the seed fall in uh let the seed fall
[11:26] into our hearts Lord let Thy word fall
[11:28] in my heart let there not be any
[11:30] unbelief amen now God had said all these
[11:34] things so he knew it would be and it did
[11:37] he brought forth of its kind now that he
[11:40] had transformed then all the seed into
[11:42] the living creature and the creation
[11:44] that it was supposed to be it came up
[11:46] just as he said it would he said Let It
[11:48] Be maybe hundreds and hundreds of years
[11:51] passed but here we find it a beautiful
[11:53] Eden the big birds flying then Birds
[11:55] didn't have to die and the wolf and the
[11:57] lamb were feeding together the leopard
[11:59] The Lion The Leopard and oxx there was
[12:01] no killing no death no sorrow and there
[12:04] was Adam and Eve Walking In the Garden
[12:07] of Eden every seed bringing forth it
[12:09] never could do nothing else why God said
[12:13] it that way it never could do nothing
[12:16] else because God said let let it be that
[12:18] way it had to be that way now this is
[12:20] where he stops he says oh how i' like to
[12:23] stop here just a minute to say now if
[12:26] you could have in your mind and really
[12:29] would want to start before paragraph 88
[12:31] and just start at the very beginning of
[12:32] this message to track everything brother
[12:34] B's saying to this moment is this
[12:36] momentum building there's this picture
[12:38] that's being painted and brother br's
[12:40] described it so beautifully the leopard
[12:42] and the ox and the lion no killing no
[12:44] death sorrow Adam and the woman walking
[12:46] through the garden every spoken word of
[12:48] God bringing forth after its kind what a
[12:50] beautiful picture what a powerful scene
[12:53] everything is just uh laid out so
[12:55] wonderfully says oh I just want to stop
[12:57] and say this is where we are facing yet
[13:00] the completion of that
[13:03] word in other words this is where we're
[13:06] standing today he says let us act out
[13:08] this place that he's placed Us in in
[13:10] these last days the place that we've
[13:12] been put in in this last days is to
[13:14] fulfill all the promise and the
[13:16] potential that was represented in Adam
[13:19] and the woman all the Splendor all the
[13:22] glory all the the Majesty that was
[13:24] portrayed there in the beginning we know
[13:26] that something was interrupted but now
[13:28] here here we are today in our place
[13:31] acting out the final stages of what was
[13:34] represented in Genesis chapter 1 and
[13:36] chapter 2 this is what we are facing
[13:38] this is where we're standing today this
[13:40] is the place we are in today the
[13:42] completion or the Fulfillment of the
[13:44] original word that's
[13:46] exciting what a wonderful place to be
[13:49] now God said let there be and here it
[13:52] come up first perfectly just
[13:55] exactly now this tree can only bring
[13:58] forth that tree this tree can only bring
[14:00] forth this tree and Adam a Son of God
[14:03] can only bring forth a Son of God it's
[14:07] everything after its kind and so God
[14:09] could say well I'll just rest
[14:13] now he had a system and a way of doing
[14:17] things let it be just and that's the way
[14:20] it was everything at seed bringeth forth
[14:22] of its kind now when everything looked
[14:24] pretty and everything come to pass just
[14:26] what God had said now here comes that
[14:28] slime dirty deceiver now that's what I'm
[14:31] trying to warn you all about here and
[14:33] you know that this is the theme to power
[14:35] of transformation uh God's power to
[14:38] transform is the deformer god transforms
[14:41] by the power that's within the seed
[14:43] Satan can interrupt the transformation
[14:45] and cause a de defect or a a a
[14:48] disconformity to the original design and
[14:50] this is the theme to what he's preaching
[14:52] in this sermon but he says this dirty
[14:54] slimy deceiver this is what I'm trying
[14:56] to warn you about when you see God's
[14:58] seed begin to to take hold to grow watch
[15:01] out for that fellow coming in just as
[15:03] slick as he can be quote scripture just
[15:06] just to who wouldn't have it see watch
[15:08] him because he's a deceiver I'm going to
[15:11] call it instead of a conformer being
[15:12] conformed he's a deformer deforming the
[15:15] things that's been conformed he is a
[15:18] deformer and he a deformer or perverter
[15:20] or corruptor of the Original Seed in the
[15:24] program now I love what he says here
[15:26] because this is instructive to us
[15:28] especially
[15:29] as a church that's just beginning and we
[15:31] see the the hand of God in it we
[15:33] recognize the supernatural now you see
[15:35] here like in your group this morning you
[15:38] got a program you got a vision we have
[15:41] that right now watch for that corruptor
[15:44] oh he'll be Sly and slick as he can be
[15:46] you see but keep your vision boy see
[15:49] keep holding to that when God has given
[15:52] you a place when God gives you a vision
[15:54] when God has a program or a purpose and
[15:56] you begin to line up with it you begin
[15:58] to kind of catch the move of God catch
[16:00] the will of God for you expect Satan to
[16:02] come around and try to bump you off that
[16:04] track expect the deformer to come and
[16:07] try to pervert the trajectory and get
[16:09] you a little bit off center and get you
[16:10] away from things but we got a program we
[16:12] got a vision watch the slly Slick slimy
[16:15] deceiver corruptor come in but you've
[16:17] got to keep your vision keep holding to
[16:20] that say we also find out when he come
[16:22] in he deformed that seed and he
[16:25] corrupted that seed by getting into the
[16:27] bedding grounds which was e
[16:29] and corrupting that seed with
[16:30] corruptible seed before it could get
[16:33] there to corrupt that beautiful Garden
[16:34] of Eden and it that I know that's kind
[16:37] of a fragment there he says we're Heaven
[16:39] the only thing that that is is just the
[16:42] restoration so Satan comes and
[16:45] interrupts and corrupts things this
[16:47] beautiful Garden of Eden is interrupted
[16:49] and then he refers to Heaven he says
[16:51] Heaven is just a restoration that we
[16:53] have to change our mindset of what the
[16:54] future heaven is going to be we think
[16:56] Heaven oh we think of H uh some kind of
[16:59] h a dimension in the sky that's got
[17:01] clouds and streets of gold and pearly
[17:04] gates and we try to just imagine what
[17:06] it's going to be but it's going to be
[17:08] here amen new heavens and new earth
[17:11] that's what it's going to be for all
[17:13] eternity it's not in another dimension
[17:14] out there but there's a a just a seiling
[17:17] and a fusion of all dimensions and God
[17:20] is is going to be expressed throughout
[17:22] all eternity he says Heaven is just the
[17:24] restoration of the restoration of what
[17:26] in the beginning that's right the very
[17:28] plan and purpose of God he goes he goes
[17:31] where are we now now notice how he comes
[17:32] back to this Heaven is just a
[17:34] restoration where are we now we're on
[17:36] our road back to the original beginning
[17:38] of the creation of God where are we now
[17:41] what are we facing today back to the
[17:42] original beginning of the creation of
[17:44] God back to the Garden of Eden again
[17:46] husband and wife without any sin or
[17:48] anything to live
[17:50] eternally praise the Lord I love how
[17:53] brother brandham takes us in the in
[17:56] where we're going it's taking us back
[17:58] it's Redemption think all the future oh
[18:01] heaven but yet this this uh this
[18:03] eternity this Loop is coming back to
[18:05] where it left right we're on our road
[18:08] back to the original beginning of the
[18:09] creation of God that's the original
[18:11] we're going back to back to the Garden
[18:13] of Eden again husband and woman husband
[18:16] and wife without any sin or anything to
[18:18] live
[18:20] eternally why God spoke it it's going to
[18:24] come to pass he's going to keep his
[18:27] Covenant with creation in Isaiah chap
[18:30] 55:
[18:32] 10-13 if you'll just can follow these
[18:34] verses with
[18:36] me says for as the rain cometh down and
[18:40] the snow from heaven and returneth not
[18:43] thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it
[18:46] to bring forth and Bud that it may give
[18:49] seed to the S and bread to the eater he
[18:52] says so shall my word be that goeth
[18:54] forth out of my mouth so he the verse 10
[18:58] is wanting to condition our minds and
[19:01] open up our minds by understanding even
[19:03] natural things to be able to relate to
[19:06] the word of God for as the rain cometh
[19:09] down and the snow from heaven so this
[19:13] precipitation that would come from the
[19:14] sky and returneth not thither in other
[19:17] words it comes down and then it just
[19:19] doesn't go right back up again in its
[19:20] same state but WTH the Earth it's not
[19:23] just uh comes down for no reason goes
[19:26] back up he says it comes down for reason
[19:28] it Waters the the Earth and in watering
[19:30] the Earth it makes to bring forth and
[19:32] Bud what the seeds that are in the earth
[19:35] for what purpose and know each thing
[19:36] just builds to the next that it may give
[19:39] seed the Earth may give seed to the SE
[19:42] through the process of uh of this plant
[19:44] coming to seed the seed can then be used
[19:46] again to be sewn and bread to the eater
[19:50] so it comes to seed and then the seed is
[19:52] used to sew again but also to make bread
[19:55] for the eater so he says as the rain
[19:57] falls Waters the Earth in watering the
[19:59] Earth it brings forth a plant which
[20:01] brings forth seed that seed is used
[20:03] again to perpetuate the cycle but then
[20:05] also used to make bread it's a germ to
[20:08] make bread for the eater he's wanting us
[20:11] to have this picture in our mind in this
[20:13] uh this process in our minds of sewing
[20:17] growing and harvesting when it comes to
[20:20] the word of God so when God speaks
[20:23] something we say God says Let There Be
[20:24] and we think boom there's got to be but
[20:27] it can happen that way if you ever catch
[20:29] the Revelation that you're healed you
[20:31] you could start looking for it
[20:33] immediately because it can happen just
[20:36] like that brother Bram even says the new
[20:38] birth can happen justification
[20:39] sanctification the very seal of God
[20:41] which is the new birth can happen all at
[20:43] one time amen but then there but there
[20:46] can also be a process to it God says
[20:48] it's going to be you might as well
[20:50] expect that it's going to happen but Ram
[20:52] said whenever God says something the
[20:54] predestined just make they're under
[20:56] Supernatural expectation and they make
[20:58] preparation for for it they say well
[21:00] it's uh you're making preparation
[21:02] Abraham you're going to have a son he
[21:03] starts making preparation maybe the
[21:05] first few years they kind of humor
[21:08] them then after five people
[21:11] like then after 10 20 right but you can
[21:16] count on it whatever God says is going
[21:19] to happen so this phrase this this image
[21:22] that the prophet is trying to draw what
[21:24] God is trying to get us to understand in
[21:26] this is that when God says something
[21:28] it's a seed but there's a season for the
[21:30] sewing there's a season for the wa the
[21:33] germination and the watering and the and
[21:35] the energizing of that seed and the
[21:37] development of that plant to where it's
[21:39] going to come to seed and then it's
[21:41] going to be harvested and then used for
[21:43] its particular purpose whether it be
[21:45] sewn again or turned into bread God
[21:47] wants us to think of his word in that
[21:48] way in terms of season development and a
[21:51] process of time but remember no matter
[21:53] how long the seasons no matter how long
[21:56] the process no matter how uncertain it
[21:58] may seem God's word will be
[22:03] fulfilled this is how he wants us to
[22:05] think before we read verse 11 so shall
[22:07] my word be that goeth forth from out of
[22:09] my mouth you can count on it it's going
[22:13] to go forth and when my word Goes Forth
[22:15] it falls like grain when my word Goes
[22:17] Forth it's like a seed in the ground
[22:18] think in terms of seasons and
[22:20] development it shall not return unto me
[22:24] void when I say something it's not going
[22:26] to come back empty but it shall
[22:29] accomplish that which I please and it
[22:33] shall prosper in the thing where to I
[22:37] sent it well I want to be a
[22:39] thing if he says brother man says this
[22:42] this is a there's a place let us act out
[22:44] this place that he's placed Us in in the
[22:46] last days this is where we're facing yet
[22:48] the completion of that word we're on a
[22:50] road back to the original beginning of
[22:52] the creation back to the Garden of Eden
[22:54] again husband and wife without any sin
[22:55] or anything to live Eternal eternally he
[22:58] says in the message God's power to
[23:00] transform he says that it's what I
[23:03] believe he says as long as it would have
[23:04] stayed in God's Great economy every word
[23:06] in its place as long as that creation
[23:08] would have existed there'd be no death
[23:10] as long as it stayed like that God's
[23:11] Great economy and he's looking at this
[23:13] perfect picture with no death he says
[23:15] it's where I believe that we're headed
[23:17] back to we're going back to that spot
[23:20] that place that seventh morning God
[23:23] looked upon it all and said it's good
[23:25] I'm pleased with it yeah I'm glad I did
[23:27] it
[23:28] that's what we're coming back to that's
[23:30] the place we're coming to we're on a
[23:32] road back to that then I want to be the
[23:34] thing wherein it
[23:36] sent that's what we are I I guess I
[23:38] could even say it's not that I want that
[23:41] is what you are contrary to my desire
[23:44] contrary to what I want I I want you to
[23:46] catch this as a personal revelation that
[23:49] this is what I am today I am the thing
[23:52] where into to God has sent this
[23:56] promise it will come forth
[23:59] oh it looks pretty dark I
[24:01] know doesn't man are you sure that can
[24:04] really happen you sure that's going to
[24:06] work you sure this is going to come to
[24:07] pass like it ought to it's going to
[24:09] happen every word that proceeds out of
[24:12] the mouth of God will not return void it
[24:14] shall accomplish that which I please it
[24:17] shall prosper in the thing where to i s
[24:19] it there is intent behind his word
[24:22] there's a design there's a purpose
[24:24] behind what God says God has a distinct
[24:26] intention when giving his word he
[24:28] actually has a distinct audience in mind
[24:30] when he gets it gives it and he's
[24:32] looking at you the recipients the beding
[24:34] ground of it that place that he's placed
[24:37] Us in in these last days just say God
[24:39] let the seed fall into hearts and he
[24:40] says it will
[24:43] prosper I'm the God of all creation my
[24:46] word when I speak it is going to prosper
[24:49] now follow this as we look at this
[24:51] Isaiah chapter 55: 10 to13 this is a
[24:55] prophecy now when he says for as the
[24:57] rain cometh down
[24:59] and snow and it returns not thither but
[25:01] it bring for brings forth Bud gives seed
[25:04] to the so bread to the eater we could
[25:06] actually go back and look in Genesis 1
[25:08] and Genesis 2 and see these very
[25:10] elements now that's really no big
[25:12] profound mystery because that's when God
[25:14] created
[25:15] everything but think of the process even
[25:17] where God is giving the command to man
[25:20] that he may eat of the herb that he may
[25:22] eat of the these certain plants in the
[25:24] field and that this is the process that
[25:26] God in the very beginning is saying that
[25:27] there's going to be seed sown there's
[25:30] going to be things that bud you're going
[25:31] to have a right to them to eat them he's
[25:34] describing creation and then with that
[25:36] seeing in mind he says whatever I say is
[25:38] going to come to pass my word is like
[25:41] this it goes Goes Forth out of my mouth
[25:43] it will will not return void it will
[25:44] accomplish that with I please it'll
[25:46] Prosper the thing where unto i s it what
[25:48] he actually speaking of this is actually
[25:50] a prophecy what he says here is a
[25:52] prophecy of the Redemption of everything
[25:54] God
[25:55] created you say well is it really EX
[25:58] exactly that well I can at least say
[26:00] this it
[26:01] applies because he's saying I what I say
[26:04] will come to pass and God has
[26:06] prophesying the Redemption of all of
[26:07] creation what God spoke in the beginning
[26:10] will be perfected I seed these seeds in
[26:13] Genesis 1 they're not going to return
[26:15] into me void they're not going to get
[26:17] corrupted they're not going to be
[26:18] defiled they're not going to lay dormant
[26:20] forever I will see the fruit of every
[26:23] original spoken word
[26:26] seed so the very language that we're
[26:28] following here and catch the connection
[26:30] to Creation catch connection to the fall
[26:33] because Isaiah 5510 to13 is prophesying
[26:35] the Redemption of the original wow the
[26:38] completion of the original notice how we
[26:40] follow this language rain falling upon
[26:42] the Earth seed coming forth to be swn
[26:44] again to become bread to the eater my
[26:46] word is like that it will not return to
[26:48] be void it will accomplish it will
[26:50] prosper verse
[26:52] 12 for ye shall go out with joy and led
[26:56] forth with peace
[26:58] how this is this is a climax right this
[27:01] is a culmination it says ye shall go out
[27:04] with joy that means this is how it's
[27:06] finishing you go go out with a bang that
[27:09] means you finished with the flurry you
[27:10] did or if you go out with a whimper this
[27:13] going out speaks of a
[27:14] climax this going out speaks of Triumph
[27:17] it's I I if you're going to go out with
[27:19] joy if you're going to go out with peace
[27:21] this is something where you're being
[27:22] ushered forth in a climactic moment in a
[27:25] climax of something and the Very length
[27:28] Ang that's used of joy and peace ought
[27:31] to already begin to uh conjure up in our
[27:33] mind Joy to the
[27:35] World Peace on Earth why this is the
[27:38] very blessing that comes with the
[27:39] Messiah joy and peace and Isaiah chapter
[27:42] 9: 6 to7 now I I wanted to read this
[27:46] here I had it placed in another spot but
[27:48] the Lord just draw me back to this for
[27:50] you shall go out with joy and be led
[27:52] forth with peace this is the promise of
[27:54] the Redeemer and the Messiah For unto us
[27:56] a child is born unto us a son has given
[28:00] now I want you to keep this hold this in
[28:01] mind I may be getting this a little bit
[28:03] of out of order but now they're wanting
[28:05] you to think a child is going to be born
[28:07] a son is going to be given now that's
[28:09] not peculiar here in Isaiah chapter nine
[28:11] to the passage of time many sons have
[28:13] been
[28:14] born but this is a language though
[28:17] that's to make a connection this is a
[28:19] language to get man thinking in a
[28:21] particular way every man is born of a
[28:23] woman children have been born sons have
[28:26] been born but now this prophecy y of a
[28:29] son being born a son being given a child
[28:32] born but it's a son given and then it
[28:34] says and the government shall be upon
[28:36] his
[28:36] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[28:39] wonderful counselor wonderful counselor
[28:42] the Mighty God the Everlasting father
[28:45] the prince of
[28:46] peace now this conjures up an image of
[28:49] Genesis 1 and two this speaks to even
[28:52] the silence that would have been between
[28:54] Genesis 2 and Genesis 3 why here's one
[28:56] with the government upon it shoulders
[28:58] the Dominion not just of a natural
[29:00] people but it's of the world a child is
[29:03] given a child is born a son is given the
[29:05] government The Authority the power he's
[29:07] wonderful counselor Mighty God
[29:09] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[29:11] why peace is going to reain upon all the
[29:14] Earth it's from this prophecy that the
[29:17] Jews believed that the Messiah would be
[29:20] a natural man of a natural Kingdom that
[29:22] even under his Rule and Reign all
[29:24] Gentiles all reprobates all Humanity
[29:26] would come to his light in the entire
[29:28] world would exist in peace in natural
[29:31] lands the Prince of Peace of the
[29:34] increase of his government and peace
[29:36] there shall be no
[29:38] end so this is going out this is
[29:41] something that's ushered in and it never
[29:43] leaves it's the climax culmination
[29:44] government and peace shall have no end
[29:46] upon the throne of David and upon his
[29:48] kingdom to order it and to establish it
[29:50] and with judgment and with Justice from
[29:52] henceforth forever the Zeal of the Lord
[29:54] of hosts will perform this
[29:58] the Divine energy which has spoken it
[30:00] you could take Isaiah 9 6-7 you could
[30:03] take it count on it it's going to happen
[30:05] why the Zeal of the lord of the hosts
[30:07] his power his energy the transforming
[30:09] power within the seed will perform
[30:12] this that's what he's saying in Isaiah
[30:14] 55 I will accomplish whatever I say
[30:17] whatever do the Zeal of the Lord will
[30:19] perform this for ye shall go out with
[30:21] joy and be led forth with peace notice
[30:23] the connection with creation the
[30:25] mountains and the hills shall Break
[30:27] Forth before you singing into singing
[30:29] and all the trees of the field shall
[30:31] clap their hands what's happening
[30:33] creation is rejoicing at this right a
[30:37] picture of trees breaking forth H into
[30:41] clapping and mountains uh breaking forth
[30:44] and singing and the hills skipping think
[30:47] of this picture that's being expressed
[30:49] that creation is going to be satisfied
[30:52] amen all of creation is rejoicing as
[30:55] we've been reading in Romans chapter 8
[30:56] through a few services verse 22 for we
[30:59] know that the whole creation granth and
[31:02] travaileth in pain together until now
[31:06] waiting for this explosion how many Of
[31:08] You' have ever gone up to the preacher
[31:10] after he's preached his heart out on a
[31:12] Sunday morning and you said men brother
[31:14] I almost shouted I almost jumped out of
[31:17] my seat I you know I almost started
[31:21] dancing you
[31:23] almost right you
[31:26] just and something just caused you to
[31:29] compose yourself this is how creation
[31:32] has been from the very moment that man
[31:35] fell at that precipice as it was at this
[31:38] spot groaning and travailing something
[31:41] bubbling forth in it something longing
[31:44] something Desiring something wanting to
[31:47] see Longing To See and not in a hope so
[31:50] but in a know so that one day I have
[31:54] been made subject by the fall of Adam to
[31:57] vanity
[31:58] but not without hope as the scripture
[32:00] says I have been made subject in hope
[32:03] that one day I know all of creation
[32:06] knows as if it's been in designed in
[32:10] Mother Nature within herself within her
[32:13] Springs within her mind within her
[32:15] patterns it is sown within her every
[32:19] cycle every season every Dawn every
[32:23] setting of the Sun every passing of the
[32:25] Comet every conjunction of planets it's
[32:28] all testifying in hope that one day it's
[32:31] going to be delivered into the Glorious
[32:33] Liberty of the manifestation of the sons
[32:36] of
[32:38] God and that the whole world's been in
[32:40] birth pains why because it was made
[32:43] pregnant with expectation of a blessing
[32:45] of a power of a government of a kingdom
[32:48] of a
[32:50] Perfection and I can't help but think
[32:52] and I know we've probably all done it
[32:56] before we think about what we're taught
[32:58] in this word and in this message about
[33:01] creation about our association with it
[33:04] about the power that we have through the
[33:05] word of God and the Dominion we given
[33:08] man was made as the God over
[33:10] Earth and we go hunting and we think God
[33:14] bring that big
[33:15] buck and we want to draw in some kind of
[33:17] power some kind of association with
[33:19] creation we're fishing I want to catch a
[33:22] lunker right brother Preston I want to
[33:24] catch a I want to catch a double diit
[33:26] bass Lord I I'm a son of God here I am
[33:28] and we long for this and and we think in
[33:30] those terms but creation doesn't long to
[33:34] be gigged by your arrow so it can be put
[33:38] on the wall and you could have backstrap
[33:41] fajitas it longed for something
[33:44] different and so the image that comes
[33:46] into my mind when I begin to think about
[33:49] creation groan and longing is when we
[33:51] see the manifestation of the third pole
[33:53] when brother Bam's there in Colorado we
[33:55] immediately begin to identify oh yes he
[33:57] said spoke to the storm that's the
[33:59] spoken word upon creation but the
[34:01] manifestation of that doesn't stop there
[34:04] God says would you walk with me this is
[34:06] the full reality of the word of God
[34:08] would you walk with me and he begins to
[34:10] walk says there I am in virgin Timber
[34:12] Untouched by man back to what it would
[34:15] have been in the beginning he says in
[34:16] every motion all of a sudden I was young
[34:19] again there's his wife walking together
[34:21] with him and what happens creation's
[34:23] drawn to him he says he has his gun
[34:26] there he notice the pitter patter the
[34:28] tears falling on dry leaves and creation
[34:30] is all of a sudden drawn why because in
[34:32] this manifestation there must have been
[34:35] a birth pain creation must have been
[34:38] having a contraction at that very moment
[34:40] again to sense what is this what is
[34:44] happening there in Colorado on this
[34:46] Mountaintop do I see the deer drawn to
[34:49] it do I see a Son of God in his position
[34:53] again oh Hallelujah why creation is
[34:56] groaning
[34:57] the hills Want to Break Forth in the
[34:59] singing the trees want to clap their
[35:02] hands why it's been made pregnant with
[35:07] hope contining now verse
[35:10] 13 notice the connection When God says I
[35:12] say something it's going to happen
[35:14] notice the connection says instead of
[35:15] the thorn shall come up the fur
[35:19] tree and instead of the Brier shall come
[35:21] up the Myrtle tree and it shall be the
[35:25] the Lord for a name for an everlasting
[35:27] sign that shall not be cut
[35:32] off what is he referring to he says the
[35:35] Zeal of the Lord will perform this
[35:37] because this is going to be increase of
[35:38] his government of Peace there shall be
[35:40] no end now when it speaks to the throne
[35:42] of David well finally finally we're
[35:44] going to have a Kingdom of Israel
[35:45] that'll never be overthrown no what you
[35:47] see in Israel is just the repeat of what
[35:50] you saw in the garden a kingdom
[35:53] fall and so Israel's just in this cycle
[35:56] of Revival and death Revival and death
[35:57] and we can say well this is a prophecy
[35:59] that Israel will be restored to its
[36:01] glory and it'll never diminish but it's
[36:02] actually God saying creation all of
[36:05] creation will be redeemed and it'll
[36:08] never
[36:09] end and he says this it'll be for an
[36:11] everlasting sign that shall not be cut
[36:14] off why the very first cutting off is in
[36:17] Genesis
[36:18] 3 that's when what looked like a an
[36:21] eternal uh something that would never be
[36:23] that that's when there's a something
[36:24] that drops down out of it it seemes
[36:26] interrupted God's prophesying of
[36:28] redemption and as he speaks of it the
[36:30] Thor instead of a thorn and a fur tree
[36:32] instead of a Brier the Myrtle tree it's
[36:35] a prophecy of the curse on creation
[36:37] being
[36:38] lifted because God deals with the Thorns
[36:41] he deals with the Briars he deals with
[36:43] the joy he deals with happiness he deals
[36:45] with fear it's all being addressed here
[36:48] in Isaiah
[36:50] 55 Genesis chapter 3 now as we come to
[36:54] this in our text I think it's just a
[36:56] good spot right here in the middle
[36:58] of our sermon
[36:59] today Genesis chapter 3 now because this
[37:02] is where we're going to draw from this
[37:04] language we'll pick up in verse 15 if
[37:05] you want to turn
[37:06] there it not only brings the
[37:10] curse but it's the first prophecy of
[37:15] Christmas I I I probably would desire
[37:18] amen's or at least a wow or interesting
[37:22] or as some people go
[37:24] okay you know they're like uhhuh where
[37:26] are you going with this
[37:28] it's the first prophecy of Christmas I
[37:31] guess the the word Christ Christmas is
[37:33] um sometimes we associate it with
[37:36] Catholicism a Christ Mass but you know
[37:38] What Christmas Means the very word means
[37:40] the sending of
[37:42] Christ Christmas is it's not a mass of
[37:45] Christ we think of a gathering and and
[37:47] the Eucharist in the ca Catholic service
[37:50] but the word Christ Mass the very word
[37:51] means the sending of Christ the sending
[37:55] forth of Christ and so if God's word
[37:57] first Goes Forth as a SE Genesis 3 holds
[38:01] not just the curse but the very first
[38:04] mention of sending
[38:06] Christ it's the very first prophecy that
[38:09] we can identify that there is going to
[38:11] be Redemption right that yes man has
[38:14] fallen by virtue of The Serpent and the
[38:15] interaction of the woman and it's it's
[38:18] sucked in Adam and all these things have
[38:19] happened and transpired and then we see
[38:21] as we begin to read this here in just a
[38:23] moment we can see that well God's
[38:25] speaking to address this there must be a
[38:27] restoration coming in Redemption so
[38:30] Genesis 3 is not only a curse but it's
[38:32] actually a prophecy of peace on
[38:35] Earth it's a prophecy of Joy it's a
[38:38] prophecy of a son being given the Prince
[38:40] of Peace the Mighty God the very image
[38:43] that Adam held the hope of there's going
[38:45] to come one that will fulfill everything
[38:48] that Adam
[38:49] couldn't or at least
[38:52] didn't Genesis chter 3 let's read verses
[38:54] 15 we'll read all the way to 21 may get
[38:57] a little a little bit out of order but
[38:58] let's read together speaking to the
[39:00] serpent and I'll put enity between thee
[39:02] and the woman hatred animosity a fight
[39:05] and between thy seed and her seed no
[39:07] more would these two be able
[39:09] to uh H uh uh interact as it had between
[39:14] thy seed and the seed of the woman the
[39:16] phrase phrasing used there is very rich
[39:19] to suggest son Offspring between thy
[39:22] seed and her son it shall bruise thy
[39:25] head and thou shalt bruise and then the
[39:27] scripture showing it his
[39:30] heal this is a prophecy of a son coming
[39:33] forth
[39:35] right and we we we've mentioned this
[39:37] before we could be we can be absolutely
[39:41] certain of it because the word of God
[39:42] declares
[39:43] it and then we see that Satan
[39:45] immediately acts in response to it in
[39:47] the next chapter by what killing the son
[39:50] of
[39:51] Adam why because he's like a son's going
[39:53] to be given and he's gonna he's going to
[39:55] interrupt try to interrupt my program
[39:57] he's going to try to stop me he's going
[39:58] to try to crush my head my thought my
[40:01] intent my purpose my design what I've
[40:02] tried to sew into mankind this is going
[40:04] to be dealt with this is going to be
[40:05] addressed so he's looking for the heal
[40:08] of the man that's going to crush
[40:11] him and it's so this is the prophecy of
[40:14] a son being
[40:17] given this is the prophecy of
[40:20] Christ right Genesis 3 3:15 it's the
[40:24] first prophecy of Christmas there's
[40:26] going to be a sun given that's right
[40:28] he's going to be born and he's going to
[40:29] deal with the
[40:31] curse but now as it begins to continue
[40:33] notice the the uh um the if I I want to
[40:36] give this backdrop to verse 15 but I
[40:39] love how God prophesies this first
[40:41] because it says this in verse 16 and
[40:43] under the woman he said I will greatly
[40:45] multiply thy sorrow and thy
[40:48] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[40:50] forth children and thy desire shall be
[40:53] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[40:54] thee a double Covenant that's now been
[40:58] introduced and in the courage that comes
[41:00] upon the woman I want you to catch the
[41:01] key here the phrasing to conceive and
[41:04] bring forth I'm going to greatly
[41:05] multiply or multiply I'm going to
[41:07] multiply greatly multiply thy sorrow in
[41:09] thy conception or the sorrow of
[41:11] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[41:13] forth children so now this this is not
[41:16] associated with pleasure but this is
[41:18] something that's a pain this is a
[41:20] distress I will greatly multiply your
[41:22] grief your suffering and pregnancy and
[41:24] the Pains of childbearing with spasms of
[41:26] distress you shall bring forth children
[41:29] any amens amen I didn't expect a loud
[41:32] one from a
[41:33] brother but the reality of this every
[41:36] woman who's brought forth a child knows
[41:38] it from the very conception there's
[41:41] things that begin to take place within a
[41:43] woman's body that are
[41:45] distressful from the nausea the fainting
[41:48] the weakness the changing of the body
[41:50] God is saying that now child conception
[41:54] and bearing and caring and development
[41:57] and and then delivery is going to be
[41:58] associated with sorrow and you're going
[42:00] to conceive and it's going to be a pain
[42:03] and it's going to be through sorrow and
[42:04] distress that you're going to bring
[42:06] forth the process of conceiving and
[42:09] bringing forth a child from conception
[42:11] to birth is going to be marked by pain
[42:14] suffering and
[42:16] distress I you could very well say that
[42:18] in the beginning God said be fruitful
[42:21] multiply but now her
[42:24] multiplying is going to be associated
[42:26] with pain in suffering and
[42:29] distress and the curse of the woman is
[42:31] in conception and delivery conception
[42:35] and
[42:36] delivery I'll greatly multiply thy
[42:38] conception and thou shalt bring forth so
[42:41] keep that in mind is the Bible said unto
[42:42] us a child is born a son is given now
[42:44] this very image the woman is cursed in
[42:47] conception and bringing forth now verse
[42:50] 17 and under Adam he said because thou
[42:52] has hearkened under the voice of thy
[42:53] wife and Hast eaten of the tree of which
[42:55] I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not
[42:57] eat of it now notice the point of the
[42:59] curse cursed is the ground for thy sake
[43:03] now there's sorrow but of a different
[43:04] sort and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
[43:06] the days of thy life now notice the
[43:08] connection with Isaiah chapter 55 the
[43:11] rain comes down Waters the Earth the the
[43:13] herb grows the seed grows the wheat
[43:15] grows comes to Bud the so the the one
[43:18] that has sowed Harvest to takes some
[43:20] seed he SWS it again he makes bread for
[43:22] the eater and he's saying in sorry
[43:24] you're going to eat bread all the days
[43:25] of the life he says thorn s also and
[43:28] thistles shall it bring forth unto
[43:31] thee what did the Bible say in Isaiah 55
[43:34] and the point I'm trying to drive home
[43:35] by using that scripture is if God spoke
[43:37] it it will come to pass it will
[43:39] accomplish what he pleases he says these
[43:41] thorns and these thistles are going to
[43:42] be replaced with the fur tree and with a
[43:44] myrtle tree it's God now catch the
[43:48] connection with Isaiah 55 that when
[43:50] Isaiah 55 is spoken God is saying what I
[43:53] said would happen in the beginning is
[43:56] going to be fulfilled it will be
[43:58] accomplished he says what I've spoken
[44:00] will come to pass and he addresses the
[44:02] very curse upon
[44:04] mankind because Genesis 3:15 to 21 is
[44:08] speaking of sorrow and conception and
[44:10] birth and thorns and thistles and thou
[44:12] shalt eat the herb of the field in the
[44:14] sweat of thy face Thou shalt eat bread
[44:16] till thy return into the ground for out
[44:18] of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art
[44:20] and unto dust shalt thou
[44:22] return what is God prophesying the cycle
[44:24] of life and
[44:26] death Adam you came from the earth
[44:28] because of the Fall you're going to go
[44:29] right back to the
[44:30] Earth it's going to be a process whereby
[44:33] every man is going to be uh
[44:35] subdued by the
[44:37] Earth think about it that you came he
[44:40] came forth this body came forth from the
[44:42] earth and as he was given power to
[44:45] subdue it now that's taken away it's as
[44:47] if mankind ultimately succumbs back to
[44:50] the
[44:51] Earth even though he's eating substance
[44:53] from the earth ultimately it can't keep
[44:55] him alive forever he succumbs to it and
[44:59] it's prophesying this cycle of Life
[45:01] Death Life Death the subduing under the
[45:03] Flesh of the flesh back to dust and so
[45:07] as the woman was cursed in conception in
[45:11] childbirth now through Adam and then by
[45:15] virtue of through Adam all of humanity
[45:17] creation is cursed the woman the the
[45:20] serpent is cursed and here he singularly
[45:22] takes upon a curse and he's transformed
[45:24] to crawl upon his belly and there's
[45:25] enity put up up between seeds and he's
[45:29] characterized in a particular way and he
[45:30] suffers this curse then the woman
[45:32] individually is cursed now Adam he says
[45:34] for thy sake I'm going to curse the
[45:37] Earth Adam came from the
[45:40] earth and now the whole earth holds a
[45:43] stain and think about it you know how in
[45:46] school uh when we used to go to school
[45:49] that somebody would do something and and
[45:51] the teacher would make the point or
[45:52] maybe we don't have to talk about school
[45:54] you say within the family well because
[45:55] so and so did this the rest of you are
[45:57] going to suffer and maybe it's not put
[45:59] in those words but well we would have
[46:01] had punch and cookies today for recess
[46:03] but Johnny wanted to act up today so
[46:06] we're all just going to lay our heads
[46:07] down for 30 minutes and it's like one
[46:10] guy we all suffer come on think about
[46:15] what happened to the
[46:16] Earth we say Adam fell well listen Adam
[46:20] fell no question but when Adam lost his
[46:23] position all of Earth lost its position
[46:26] Earth is like perfect I'm perfect I'm
[46:30] awesome and he's bragging about his Adam
[46:33] and he's bragging about it all all he
[46:35] can do and he's you see Adam you see how
[46:37] he is is this great see how he named all
[46:38] of us in this great creation is just
[46:40] bursting at the same and then Adam makes
[46:41] a mistake and it's like what what
[46:43] happened and it's like well it's not
[46:45] just Adam you're getting it buddy like
[46:49] what did we do we didn't doing anything
[46:51] this wasn't even a real
[46:52] tree it was a serpent that did it then
[46:55] it was Adam and we didn't do anything
[46:59] but they're
[46:59] punished all of creation lost its
[47:02] position when Adam fell that's why it's
[47:04] important for us men to be in our
[47:06] position amen because if you're out of
[47:08] position the rest is out of position and
[47:11] he brings it to this when we see this it
[47:13] lost its position when its ruler fell
[47:15] there's a stain upon Earth all of
[47:17] Humanity's curs says the ground is
[47:19] cursed for thy sake and then the whole
[47:21] cycle of life and death is is within the
[47:24] Earth by virtue of man's fall
[47:28] now looking again at verse 15 as I said
[47:31] a moment ago this is the first prophecy
[47:33] of
[47:34] Christmas why because it's the first
[47:36] Prophecy of the coming or the sending of
[47:38] the Messiah
[47:39] Christ and it's not God it's not just
[47:43] God in the sense of him being a
[47:45] supernatural spirit that would
[47:47] somehow uh his voice would kind of
[47:49] Thunder out over creation as it was on
[47:52] Mount Si or he would do things in in an
[47:55] unseen way and he would kind of in an
[47:57] invisible way remedy things and move
[47:59] things and correct things and everybody
[48:00] just like oh everything's back to normal
[48:02] but it prophesies of God becoming
[48:05] flesh so that he becomes a Kinsman to
[48:07] the one that he's redeeming now when you
[48:09] think of the law of the goel and the
[48:11] kinsman redeemer and what we see of how
[48:13] the rules of redemption and the laws of
[48:14] redemption that are placed within Israel
[48:17] and how a Kinsman and a near Kinsman had
[48:19] rights of redemption we could say that
[48:22] that was given as a type of what was to
[48:25] come but it's actually the it was
[48:27] actually the type following the prophecy
[48:30] of the
[48:31] Kinsman we we could already look to
[48:33] scripture and see that God was going to
[48:34] use a near Kinsman a son was going to be
[48:37] given a son of a a seed of a woman was
[48:39] going to come forth and he was going to
[48:41] be a kinsman
[48:44] redeemer and this is where the law of
[48:46] redemption first is introduced when the
[48:48] Messiah is spoken of in Genesis 3:15 and
[48:52] so this is the part that I I just love
[48:54] to keep emphasizing this before the
[48:56] woman's cursed before the Earth is
[48:58] cursed before they're driven out before
[49:00] they're completely banished before they
[49:02] lose all consciousness of what e the
[49:04] Eden was the Garden of Eden was God
[49:07] prophesies Redemption amen the seed of
[49:10] the Messiah is lifted up the prophecy of
[49:13] sending Christ is first mentioned before
[49:15] the
[49:17] curse and God foreshadowed in Genesis
[49:21] 3 what this Redeemer would
[49:24] be he foreshadowed that Christmas was
[49:26] would bring forth a
[49:28] lamb it and what and we could we can
[49:31] look back hindsight is 2020 don't Flinch
[49:34] when we say
[49:35] 2020 but we look back and we can see now
[49:37] it was an innocent child laying in a
[49:40] Manger that came born of a woman just
[49:43] think of how vulnerable even that child
[49:44] is in the
[49:46] womb and here this child comes
[49:49] forth and here is the Redeemer of all
[49:53] the
[49:54] world innocent
[49:58] and God foreshadows this in Genesis 3:21
[50:00] unto Adam also and to his wife the Lord
[50:03] God did the Lord God make coats of skin
[50:07] and clothe
[50:08] them what happened God took an innocent
[50:12] lamb as you could as we would read it
[50:15] just as it might seem to unfold
[50:16] chronologically this way you could see
[50:18] all the creation is in this state of
[50:21] holding its breath because now fears
[50:24] entered into creation mankind is acting
[50:27] acting in a way that's
[50:29] completely uncharacteristic of man first
[50:31] sewing fig leaves together and all these
[50:33] things all the excitement commotion
[50:35] everything that would be happening in
[50:36] creation everything's being upset and
[50:38] creation as it is is holding its breath
[50:40] and the serpent is cursed you're going
[50:41] to crawl upon your belly you're going to
[50:43] eat dust all the days of your life and
[50:44] I'm going to put imity between thy seed
[50:46] and the woman's son and he's going to
[50:48] crush your head but you'll bruise his
[50:50] heel and creation is still holding its
[50:52] breath and then the Earth is cursed so
[50:55] there's there's a sense of oh oh we're
[50:57] being brought into bondage we're being
[50:59] made subject to vanity and all the
[51:01] creation is holding its breath as each
[51:03] one these these things are being ushered
[51:05] forth but then all of a sudden God
[51:07] speaks to Adam and gives him a
[51:08] revelation and Adam goes forward to the
[51:10] very lamb that he would have
[51:13] named grabs him by the neck the innocent
[51:16] lamb and now the lamb begins to
[51:20] bleat and there's so many different
[51:22] statements brother Bron makes about this
[51:24] where he just a few statements where now
[51:26] with sudden this lamb begins to speak a
[51:28] language Adam doesn't
[51:30] understand and Adam has to take this
[51:32] lamb and what take its life slay it and
[51:36] shed its blood and then take the skins
[51:38] of this innocent lamb and this lamb is
[51:41] being taken what have I done what did I
[51:43] do I was not complicit I was not a
[51:46] player I was not used I I have done
[51:49] nothing I'm innocent but now it begins
[51:51] to bleach and speak a language that Adam
[51:53] doesn't understand but what is the
[51:55] language of the language of the innocent
[51:57] dying that mankind could be
[52:01] redeemed and he slays the
[52:04] lamb an innocent lamb sheds its blood to
[52:07] cover guilty
[52:09] mankind what is it foreshadow an
[52:12] innocent sinless infant in a
[52:17] Manger that's a that's a phrase I
[52:19] believe it's even a course to a
[52:21] song he was a baby born to
[52:25] die now we can say about all men that
[52:28] it's a put under men once to die and
[52:30] after that the judgment and that all of
[52:32] us are born with a clock ticking inside
[52:35] of us that one day we'd go to a grave
[52:37] but this baby was born for the purpose
[52:39] of
[52:41] dying we Comfort ourselves in knowing
[52:44] that once our purpose is
[52:46] finished we cannot be taken until that
[52:49] time that once we have satisfied God's
[52:52] purpose so that we have some ultimate
[52:54] purpose we have a design we have a
[52:55] something that God wants want us to do
[52:57] and once it's been satisfied Satan
[52:58] doesn't have a right to us but now think
[53:00] of the purpose of this child his purpose
[53:02] was to
[53:04] die and God foreshadows it in Genesis
[53:08] 3:21 and then the very prophecy of a
[53:11] messiah Isaiah
[53:12] 536 I I I found this scripture just to
[53:15] be uh it just kind of turned over for me
[53:17] this past week all we like sheep have
[53:19] gone
[53:20] astray now notice even the
[53:22] characteristic how it's connected with
[53:24] this lamb in the beginning who would
[53:25] have been slain We Know by teaching of
[53:27] the word of God slain and dressed with
[53:30] over mankind he says we've turned
[53:32] everyone to his own way and the Lord
[53:34] hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
[53:38] and how does it describe us it's very
[53:40] interesting like sheep we've gone
[53:42] astray so our very backslid and our
[53:45] iniquity and our failure is
[53:47] characterized as a Wandering sheep but
[53:50] yet it's a lamb that God needs to redeem
[53:52] us why did he have to come as an
[53:54] innocent lamb to redeem sheep that have
[53:56] gone
[53:59] astray we're Redeemed by that innocent
[54:02] lamb and notice what it says in Genesis
[54:05] 3:20 I I I I'm I try might pick up the
[54:08] pace a little bit here because now we
[54:11] got we have to associate ourselves with
[54:13] this particular part Genesis 3 chapter
[54:16] 20 and God called his wife's name Eve
[54:19] because she was the mother of all
[54:23] living the the mother of all living is
[54:26] sign ifies this it's not that she
[54:27] brought forth every single child that
[54:29] exist in the Earth today but it was true
[54:33] then that she would she was the first to
[54:35] bring forth life and she was the mother
[54:38] of those that were
[54:40] born not that Adam was the father of all
[54:43] living but she was the mother of all
[54:44] living so it's that all living are
[54:47] represented in that conception and that
[54:49] bringing forth as the curse was placed
[54:52] upon the woman versus prior in thy
[54:55] conception is going to be sorrow and
[54:57] bringing forth is going to be sorrow all
[54:58] living now she's the mother of all
[55:01] living all living have come from that
[55:08] curse and so now we come to Genesis
[55:11] chter 4: 1 to
[55:15] two and consider the contrast now to the
[55:18] birth of Christ Christmas is a
[55:21] recognition the celebration of or ought
[55:23] to be the celebration of the birth of
[55:25] Jesus Christ and a baby born an innocent
[55:28] baby born the the the bringing forth of
[55:30] life now let's go to the first birth is
[55:33] in Genesis 4 contrasting with the birth
[55:35] of Christ and Adam knew Eve his wife and
[55:38] she conceived and bear these are the
[55:41] very elements of Genesis three's curse
[55:43] she conceived and be can and said I have
[55:45] gotten a man from the Lord why it's
[55:48] almost her trying to connect the
[55:49] prophecy of gen Genesis 3:15 to this son
[55:52] I have been given a son I've been given
[55:54] a seed I've gotten a man from the Lord
[55:56] we know that all life comes from God and
[55:58] she again Bears she conceived and now
[56:01] bear again so there's one conception she
[56:03] Bears two sons and she bear his brother
[56:06] Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep and
[56:09] Cain was a tiller of the
[56:13] ground it should point be it should
[56:15] stand out to
[56:17] us that God these these things that are
[56:19] mentioned here in Genesis 4 are now
[56:21] answering back to the fall answering
[56:23] back to the very curse because Abel
[56:25] comes forth
[56:26] and what does he do by Revelation he's
[56:29] given the position to be a keeper of
[56:32] sheep and this aligns this son of Adam
[56:35] with the Revelation that the Redeemer is
[56:38] going to be a sacrificial lamb because
[56:41] it was the blood of the lamb in the
[56:43] garden that covered Adam and Eve as they
[56:45] were banished from the garden now Abel
[56:48] then is connected with Redemption he's
[56:50] connected with innocence he's connected
[56:52] with the
[56:53] sacrifice though the Sheep lost its life
[56:55] it was sinless it was
[56:57] innocent and it shed its blood but now
[57:00] Cain becomes a tiller of the ground and
[57:03] we can see that this connects back to
[57:04] the curse where now Cain is associated
[57:07] with the ground which is cursed and he's
[57:08] going to bring an offering from the
[57:10] ground which is cursed but Abel's going
[57:11] to bring a revelation to as a sacrifice
[57:15] of a
[57:15] lamb and what's being described here in
[57:18] Genesis 41-2 she conceived and bear Cain
[57:20] and she bear Abel this answers to
[57:22] Genesis 3:16 it is the actual coming to
[57:26] pass how that you're going to conceive
[57:28] and you're going to bring forth children
[57:29] she conceived and bear can it's an
[57:32] answer to Genesis
[57:34] 3:16 she conceived she became pregnant
[57:36] she was with child she Bears she brought
[57:38] forth she
[57:40] travailed now all of humanity comes
[57:42] forth through this curse with this stain
[57:45] let me go quickly through job and Psalm
[57:47] and Isaiah job says man that is born of
[57:50] a woman is of a few days and full of
[57:51] trouble he cometh forth like a flower
[57:53] and is cut down he fleeth also as a
[57:55] shadow and thought what is it man's life
[57:57] is but a vapor it just vanishes away
[57:59] he's born he grows he's strong and all
[58:01] of a sudden he dies and it's just maybe
[58:04] hundreds of years at one time now just
[58:06] decades and dust thou open Thine Eyes
[58:08] Upon such a
[58:11] one let mean he cometh forth like a
[58:14] flower and is cut down he fleeth also as
[58:15] a shadow and conth not and Dost thou
[58:17] open Thine Eyes Upon such a one and
[58:19] bringest me into judgment with thee he
[58:20] says who can bring a clean thing out of
[58:22] an unclean not one amen what is he
[58:25] referring to man
[58:26] man how can you take an
[58:29] unclean humanity and bring forth clean
[58:32] Humanity next chapter job 15:14 what is
[58:35] man that he should be clean and he which
[58:37] is born of a woman that he should be
[58:38] righteous job has a revelation of how a
[58:42] man born of a woman is
[58:45] Fallen comes through a channel that is
[58:47] cursed job 25 how then can man be
[58:50] justified with God how can he be clean
[58:52] that is born of a woman EES the mother
[58:55] of all living it puts a stain upon all
[58:57] that are born because they're not born
[58:59] according to Genesis 1:20 they're born
[59:01] according to a
[59:03] fall behold I was shapen in iniquity
[59:06] Psalm 515 and in sin did my mother
[59:09] conceive me it answers to Genesis 3:16 a
[59:12] man born of a woman shapen in iniquity
[59:15] in sin I was conceived Isaiah 64:6 but
[59:18] we are all as an unclean thing and our
[59:20] all our righteousness are as filthy rags
[59:23] and we all do Fade as a leaf and our
[59:25] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[59:28] away these are all real encouraging
[59:30] scriptures right we're all why that
[59:33] speaks of us well sometimes it's this is
[59:35] what we can at least amen
[59:38] yeah this is something that ought to be
[59:40] very real to all of us let me say if
[59:42] this has not began to Dawn upon you how
[59:45] could you ever really
[59:47] repent full ownership acknowledgement
[59:50] accepting
[59:52] responsibility the subsequent response
[59:54] of evidence of remorse and guilt in
[59:57] repenting and Desiring to be
[1:00:00] changed brother BR says in spoken words
[1:00:02] of the Original Seed every man no matter
[1:00:04] whether he's a pope priest Bishop
[1:00:06] whatever is he dies because he's a
[1:00:08] hybrid every man is a
[1:00:11] hybrid every man does that mean you yes
[1:00:15] you every man every woman right there
[1:00:17] can be this I I call it an
[1:00:20] arrogance or or or the a misplaced
[1:00:24] righteousness where because we were
[1:00:26] taught the original sin the subsequent
[1:00:28] uh fallout of the original sin and
[1:00:29] serpent seed and because we take with
[1:00:31] serpent seed there's a seed of
[1:00:32] discrepancy and that serpent seed cannot
[1:00:34] humble itself to the word of God we have
[1:00:36] this little template that we use that we
[1:00:38] just impose upon people and go oh
[1:00:39] they're serpent
[1:00:41] seed as if you're
[1:00:44] not cuz think about
[1:00:47] it what was the serpent seed hybrid
[1:00:51] right but we use this oh you're pure
[1:00:53] bread from the serpent I'm pure bread
[1:00:55] from Adam hold on wait a minute every
[1:00:58] man is born a hybrid now it seems heavy
[1:01:01] we can talk about it later and walk
[1:01:04] through it in in a way that may qualify
[1:01:06] it for you in a way that you could be at
[1:01:07] peace with it but this flesh is hybrid
[1:01:10] just like
[1:01:14] can's and brother Brandon says that's
[1:01:16] exactly he was born between Satan and
[1:01:19] Eve every man every woman they may call
[1:01:23] it whatever you want it was Satan Eve
[1:01:24] the original word had nothing to do with
[1:01:26] it the original word was life he hybrid
[1:01:28] it and it brought death this body right
[1:01:31] here Bears within it the stain of the
[1:01:34] fall and it is
[1:01:37] hybrid but thank God for a promise that
[1:01:40] it will be subdued and we will be
[1:01:43] changed in our atoms amen and that there
[1:01:47] is a glorified body awaiting the elect
[1:01:49] but every man born of a woman is born
[1:01:51] between The Serpent and the woman born
[1:01:53] by the ambition of Satan he is hybrid
[1:01:56] and being hybrid there's death swn into
[1:01:59] this flesh right but what God has spoken
[1:02:03] must come to
[1:02:05] pass he will not be disappointed he will
[1:02:09] remember his Covenant with creation
[1:02:12] brother Bram said and seeed not air with
[1:02:13] the shock the kingdom of God which is in
[1:02:15] the Earth today can never be set up
[1:02:18] justly on a permiss of
[1:02:20] will oh this Thrills me and this just
[1:02:23] means I'm going to have to go longer he
[1:02:25] says the kingdom of God which is in the
[1:02:27] Earth today can never be set up justly
[1:02:30] on a permissive will it's got to come
[1:02:34] back to his perfect will the kingdom of
[1:02:38] God which is on Earth today cannot come
[1:02:40] back to its right position cannot come
[1:02:43] back to the original design until it
[1:02:45] leaves the permissive and comes back to
[1:02:48] the
[1:02:51] perfect has
[1:02:53] to so of the son to whose kingdom would
[1:02:56] be know no end and the increase of it
[1:02:59] would never falter or
[1:03:01] fail as we keep in mind she's the mother
[1:03:04] of all living and a man born of the
[1:03:05] woman is born with this stain and this
[1:03:07] fall Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord
[1:03:10] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[1:03:13] virgin shall conceive and bear a
[1:03:16] son now what's remarkable about that
[1:03:19] well you can say every child that's ever
[1:03:21] been born has been conceived and that it
[1:03:23] has been born of a woman
[1:03:26] but the language is
[1:03:28] purposeful a virgin shall conceive so
[1:03:31] we've got to immediately begin to think
[1:03:32] this is something that's happening
[1:03:34] differently but it uses the language to
[1:03:36] conceive and bear conceive and bring
[1:03:39] forth and it goes right back to Genesis
[1:03:41] 315 and
[1:03:43] 16 I'm going to give a woman a seed and
[1:03:47] he's going to crush your
[1:03:49] head and then he says to the woman in
[1:03:51] sorrow you'll conceive in sorrow you'll
[1:03:54] bear
[1:03:56] and now it says Behold a virgin shall
[1:03:58] conceive a son bear a son and shall call
[1:04:02] his name
[1:04:04] Emmanuel in the Hebrew we read is God
[1:04:06] With Us or with us is God this is
[1:04:09] different this is different in Matthew
[1:04:12] 1:23 Behold a virgin shall be with child
[1:04:14] and shall bring forth it's the same
[1:04:16] language of Genesis 3 the same language
[1:04:18] of Isaiah shall be with child shall
[1:04:20] bring forth the son and they shall call
[1:04:22] his name Emanuel and then the writer
[1:04:23] interprets it which being interpreted is
[1:04:25] God god with
[1:04:28] us this prophecy is directly connected
[1:04:31] with the
[1:04:32] curse this prophecy is directly
[1:04:34] connected with Genesis 4:1 because we
[1:04:36] see the elements of a woman can being
[1:04:39] promised that she would have received
[1:04:40] seed and bring forth a son now Isaiah 7
[1:04:43] is saying oh virgin shall conceive and
[1:04:44] bring forth a son Matthew 1:23 is saying
[1:04:46] a woman shall be with child bring forth
[1:04:48] a son his name will be God with us
[1:04:51] Emmanuel this is a great promise and
[1:04:54] it's connected in of set against the
[1:04:57] curse and the Very things that happen in
[1:04:59] Genesis 4:1 where a woman conceived and
[1:05:02] bear but it's not just in that that it
[1:05:05] runs up against it it's an answer to the
[1:05:07] fall because this is the language that's
[1:05:10] used Behold a virgin shall
[1:05:14] conceive it's one of you it's one of you
[1:05:17] to
[1:05:18] take begin to catch now this is going to
[1:05:21] be
[1:05:24] different though of a woman God's going
[1:05:26] to bypass the original
[1:05:29] sin and the and the innocence of the
[1:05:32] woman that brings it forth brings us
[1:05:34] back to the innocence of the Garden of
[1:05:35] Eden brings us back to
[1:05:39] Redemption as we read before from spoken
[1:05:42] words in the Original Seed how brother B
[1:05:43] said that the woman would have
[1:05:45] eventually brought forth that child she
[1:05:47] would have brought forth that child she
[1:05:49] would have finally done it did not God
[1:05:50] tell her multiply and replenish the
[1:05:54] Earth this is a promise oncoming thing
[1:05:57] this was something for her she never
[1:05:59] fulfills it but yet she becomes the
[1:06:00] mother of all
[1:06:01] living but not to bring forth this child
[1:06:04] she couldn't
[1:06:07] anymore so if you look at Matthew
[1:06:08] chapter
[1:06:12] 1 the
[1:06:14] Bible says the book of the generation of
[1:06:17] Jesus
[1:06:18] Christ and he began to read Abraham
[1:06:21] begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob Jacob
[1:06:23] begat Judas and his brother Judas at FES
[1:06:26] and and it begins to go through each one
[1:06:28] and it describes 15 different begats AG
[1:06:31] gendering or bringing
[1:06:33] forth all according to Genesis
[1:06:37] 3:16 all according to Genesis 3:20 Eve
[1:06:41] the mother of all living conceived a
[1:06:43] particular way brought forth a son a
[1:06:45] particular way now Matthew chapter 1
[1:06:47] through these first 16 verses begins to
[1:06:49] describe a beting a gendering a bring
[1:06:51] forth it would be conceive and bear
[1:06:54] conceive and Bear conceive and bear all
[1:06:57] the way to verse 16 Jacob begat Joseph
[1:06:59] the husband of
[1:07:01] Mary and then it recaptures the
[1:07:03] different Generations in verse 17 but
[1:07:05] then Verse 18 now the birth of Jesus
[1:07:10] Christ when it says the birth of Jesus
[1:07:13] Christ this Jesus Christ is the he of
[1:07:17] Genesis
[1:07:18] 3:15 I I know I've mentioned it a number
[1:07:20] of times and those who take very good
[1:07:22] notes could probably flip back and say
[1:07:23] he's been saying this since July but
[1:07:25] we're we're going to lay this in the
[1:07:26] foundation it's going to be here it's
[1:07:27] going to be a part of our understanding
[1:07:29] this Jesus Christ is the he of Genesis
[1:07:33] 3:15 now the birth of Jesus Christ was
[1:07:37] on this wise or after this
[1:07:40] manner and it's written this way to be a
[1:07:43] contrast to every other child that has
[1:07:46] come forth as the writer took pains to
[1:07:48] read through all these different
[1:07:50] generations and say 15 different times
[1:07:52] that a man begat a son a man begat the
[1:07:55] son it wants to stop and say wait a
[1:07:57] minute I know that Joseph was born from
[1:08:00] from uh from Jacob and he was the the
[1:08:04] husband of Mary but I want you to know
[1:08:07] what happens next is out of order of all
[1:08:09] these other ones the birth of Jesus
[1:08:11] Christ was on this wise this is
[1:08:16] different when as his mother Mary was
[1:08:18] espoused to Joseph before they came
[1:08:21] together she was found with child of the
[1:08:25] Holy
[1:08:26] ghost the Bible departs from the use of
[1:08:29] the word begat begat and uses a word
[1:08:31] that's only used twice and says the
[1:08:33] birth of Jesus the conjugation of this
[1:08:36] means the Genesis or the Nativity of
[1:08:38] Jesus was on this wise a man had a son a
[1:08:42] man had a son it even takes a place here
[1:08:45] where it says Rahab and Tamar and Ruth
[1:08:49] these ones receive seed and bear a son
[1:08:51] receive seed and bear a son but the
[1:08:54] birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise
[1:08:57] before she knew Joseph the child born in
[1:09:00] her was not like every other son born in
[1:09:03] the earth after a natural man giving
[1:09:06] conception to a woman but this one is
[1:09:10] different it denotes something peculiar
[1:09:14] as it even says in Matthew 1:1 the book
[1:09:16] of the generation of Jesus Christ in
[1:09:18] other words he has a different origin
[1:09:22] story he's not another
[1:09:26] Adam he's the second
[1:09:29] Adam but not a
[1:09:33] junior not a
[1:09:36] grandson he's a different he's another
[1:09:39] creation alog
[1:09:41] together and brother Bram said about
[1:09:43] Genesis 120 here lays the word it's
[1:09:46] there here's the word the word that God
[1:09:49] spoke to multiply and replenish the
[1:09:50] Earth it couldn't find a place to land
[1:09:54] amen finally
[1:09:56] this word caught into the womb of a
[1:09:59] virgin
[1:10:01] finally finally why God said
[1:10:05] it it must come to pass in Luke 1:31
[1:10:09] to35 and behold Thou shalt conceive in
[1:10:12] thy womb and bring forth the son this is
[1:10:14] the very thing that God said to the
[1:10:16] woman would suffer and suffer with and
[1:10:18] go through behold Thou shalt conceive in
[1:10:20] thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[1:10:22] call his name Jesus he shall be great
[1:10:25] and he shall be called the son of the
[1:10:27] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[1:10:29] him the Throne of his father David and
[1:10:31] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[1:10:33] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[1:10:35] be no end unlike Adam whose kingdom
[1:10:38] ended this Adam this son will be the son
[1:10:42] of the highest in his kingdom shall know
[1:10:44] no end his glory shall know no
[1:10:48] bounds here's a woman conceiving just as
[1:10:51] Genesis 3:16 said would happen here's a
[1:10:54] woman bringing forth the son just as
[1:10:55] Genesis 3:15 would happen but this son's
[1:10:58] different shall be great the son of the
[1:11:00] highest then notice Mary's response The
[1:11:03] Logical conclusion Mary said to the
[1:11:05] angel how shall this be seeing I know
[1:11:07] not a
[1:11:08] man the angel answered s to her the Holy
[1:11:11] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[1:11:13] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[1:11:15] therefore also that Holy thing which
[1:11:18] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:11:20] The Son of
[1:11:23] God it's come back full
[1:11:26] circle the
[1:11:28] original program of God the original
[1:11:31] plan of God it all comes back behold
[1:11:34] this virgin conceives and brings forth
[1:11:36] the son and a holy thing is born and who
[1:11:39] is he not a Son of God the Son of God
[1:11:43] the only begotten Son of God so he can
[1:11:47] become a Kinsman to all
[1:11:51] living and what was it I'm going to have
[1:11:53] to skip over a number of these quotes
[1:11:55] very very quickly here the Bible says he
[1:11:58] is the beginning of the creation of
[1:12:01] God I know I've been lengthy to this
[1:12:04] point and I don't know how much longer I
[1:12:07] I I can hold up as far as
[1:12:09] energy but Jesus Christ this babe
[1:12:14] conceived of this woman referred to in
[1:12:16] Luke 1 Matthew chapter 1 this Christ is
[1:12:20] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:12:24] Amen Revelations
[1:12:26] 3:14 brother Bram says when he preaches
[1:12:28] revelation of Jesus Christ and Le to
[1:12:30] seen age he's the beginning of the
[1:12:31] creation of God how could God be created
[1:12:33] if he's a spirit how could he be he's
[1:12:35] Eternal he never was created he never
[1:12:37] will be created because he's God at the
[1:12:39] beginning but he that is the beginning
[1:12:41] of the creation of God was Jesus Christ
[1:12:44] when he was made manifest when God lived
[1:12:45] in him he is God's
[1:12:48] creation so in the beginning God
[1:12:52] created and he had the substance own but
[1:12:56] God's going to create again and the next
[1:12:59] time he creates is not a creation but a
[1:13:01] creation of himself to exist within
[1:13:06] creation he says in Revelation chapter 4
[1:13:08] part three he is the beginning of the
[1:13:09] creation of God God is eternal but when
[1:13:12] God was created when a little baby that
[1:13:14] was conceived in the womb of a mother a
[1:13:16] virgin and she began to develop these
[1:13:18] cells within her to bring forth this
[1:13:19] little baby that was the beginning of
[1:13:22] God's creation for God was made flesh
[1:13:24] and dwelt Among Us and became Emanuel
[1:13:26] God With Us the beginning of the
[1:13:28] creation of God isn't it wonderful to
[1:13:31] think that Jesus Christ was not the son
[1:13:34] of Mary was not the son of Joseph after
[1:13:37] the flesh but yet he is the very
[1:13:39] creation of
[1:13:42] God proving his word what did he come to
[1:13:44] do to redeem that part of the earth he
[1:13:46] was the beginning of the creation of God
[1:13:49] because God is not a creation only in
[1:13:52] Christ he is a creation and that's how
[1:13:55] you in Christ are a new creature amen
[1:13:59] praise the Lord only in Christ is he a
[1:14:01] creation because God is eternal and a
[1:14:03] spirit and the spirit is not created he
[1:14:05] was the beginning of the creation of God
[1:14:07] and God redeemed that body he also
[1:14:10] multiplied bread and fish the B virgin
[1:14:12] born son what was it to prove the word
[1:14:14] to prove that it's back to the
[1:14:16] original to prove that it's a Son of God
[1:14:19] the with dominion and power and control
[1:14:21] he was the beginning of the creation of
[1:14:23] God God in creation god with a little
[1:14:26] part of the creation here that God was
[1:14:28] living in himself he was the beginning
[1:14:31] of that creation of God from him begets
[1:14:35] many
[1:14:37] sons all right there got to be
[1:14:41] more he says note he also multiplied the
[1:14:44] fishes he is the word and the proof of
[1:14:48] that
[1:14:48] word and he begets many sons he's the
[1:14:52] first of that Creation Church age book
[1:14:54] he it was God created in the form of man
[1:14:57] now by his Spirit he's creating many
[1:14:59] sons un himself God the Creator creating
[1:15:03] himself a part of his creation this is
[1:15:07] the true revelation of God this was his
[1:15:10] purpose can you see in the beginning God
[1:15:14] created what was expressed what was
[1:15:16] manifested now in Christ it's God
[1:15:19] creating himself as a part of creation
[1:15:23] when in Jesus Christ am and now it
[1:15:26] continues with you this is the true
[1:15:29] revelation of God because it was his
[1:15:32] purpose to
[1:15:33] be and here you
[1:15:36] are you are the
[1:15:38] word and the proof of the
[1:15:41] word so could you understand John chap
[1:15:44] 3: 3-7 a little bit better not that you
[1:15:46] didn't understand it this well before
[1:15:48] but just in this context Jesus as
[1:15:50] Nicodemus comes to him you you must be
[1:15:53] from God to do these things you have to
[1:15:55] be from God verily verily I said to thee
[1:15:57] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:15:59] the kingdom of God to understand just
[1:16:01] how peculiar this phrase was to
[1:16:03] Nicodemus they they share his response
[1:16:07] how can a man be born when he's
[1:16:09] old can he enter the second time into
[1:16:12] his mother's womb and be born because
[1:16:14] that's all birth
[1:16:16] was that's all bringing forth was they
[1:16:19] didn't know any other way than to come
[1:16:22] forth from your mother's womb so he says
[1:16:24] except a man be born again the phrase is
[1:16:27] common to us because as Christians we
[1:16:28] think Born Again Born Again born again
[1:16:30] but just think of having never heard of
[1:16:31] a second
[1:16:32] birth not thinking of a spiritual birth
[1:16:35] and Jesus says um you got to be born
[1:16:38] again you have to become birth again the
[1:16:41] phrase would have invoked all these
[1:16:43] images and so Nicodemus says so I I got
[1:16:46] to go back into my mother's womb and
[1:16:47] come out
[1:16:49] again and Jesus says verily verily I say
[1:16:52] unto thee except a man be born of water
[1:16:55] and of the spirit he cannot enter into
[1:16:57] the kingdom of God then he says that
[1:16:59] which is born of the flesh is flesh that
[1:17:01] which is born of the spirit is Spirit
[1:17:03] Marvel not when I say unto thee ye must
[1:17:06] be born
[1:17:08] again why would we Marvel at it and in
[1:17:12] marveling we ought not distort it this
[1:17:14] is the most important teaching that
[1:17:16] Jesus gives here in John chapter 3 you
[1:17:18] must be born again nothing else is going
[1:17:20] to make any sense nothing else is going
[1:17:21] to last nothing else it's all going to
[1:17:24] be temporary you shall lay hands on the
[1:17:25] sick and they shall recover great you
[1:17:27] get sick you get sick again but to be
[1:17:30] born again you pass from death into life
[1:17:34] amen shall not come into judgment to be
[1:17:36] born again is to be sealed by God into
[1:17:39] eternal
[1:17:40] life there there's no threat of
[1:17:42] punishment there's no threat of death so
[1:17:44] Jesus saying listen that which is born
[1:17:46] after the flesh is flesh it will die but
[1:17:48] if you are born again a second time says
[1:17:51] Born Again from above then you are
[1:17:53] spiritual so don't don't wrestle with it
[1:17:55] don't Marvel at it just do it you must
[1:17:58] be born
[1:18:01] again I'll catch this and I may stop
[1:18:04] short today uh in terms of not finishing
[1:18:08] this but at least I've made it to this
[1:18:09] statement here does God ever change his
[1:18:11] mind does God change his mind about his
[1:18:13] word now think of this it just was so
[1:18:18] beautiful how God locked this to opened
[1:18:20] this up to me but if the people won't
[1:18:22] walk in his perfect will he does have a
[1:18:24] permissive will he will let you walk in
[1:18:26] we're familiar with his teaching on this
[1:18:28] permissive will perfect will he permits
[1:18:30] it all right but he will make it work
[1:18:34] out for his glory in his perfect
[1:18:37] will now we think of incidences in our
[1:18:39] lives we think of different uh things
[1:18:41] that take place and listen let me
[1:18:42] challenge you God works it for the good
[1:18:47] and God will work it to his perfect but
[1:18:50] it's necessary for us to acknowledge
[1:18:53] when we have walked in per
[1:18:55] permissive and not always self-justified
[1:18:58] well it worked out didn't it all things
[1:19:00] work together for the good sons of God
[1:19:02] are led by the spirit of God and we use
[1:19:04] that to justify everything we say
[1:19:07] everything we do well I'm sorry it hurt
[1:19:09] you but I'm a Son of God so I must have
[1:19:11] said it for a
[1:19:13] reason or well you know it was a mistake
[1:19:16] but God allowed it no humility
[1:19:19] repentance
[1:19:20] acknowledgement but the principle is he
[1:19:23] won't if you don't walk imp perfect he
[1:19:25] permits
[1:19:26] permissive but he will make it work out
[1:19:28] for his perfect for his glory in his
[1:19:31] perfect will then he says just like in
[1:19:33] the
[1:19:34] beginning it was not God's perfect will
[1:19:37] for children to be born on Earth through
[1:19:39] sex no sir and I know there's a lot of
[1:19:42] statements and different things that's
[1:19:44] used in this we can we can at least
[1:19:47] accept that the way man came is not the
[1:19:49] way that God intended it no sir God
[1:19:51] created Man Out of the Dust of the earth
[1:19:53] breathed the breath of life into him and
[1:19:54] he became a living Soul he took from man
[1:19:56] a help meet and made a wife to him that
[1:19:59] was God's first and original will but
[1:20:02] when sin come in and did the thing that
[1:20:03] it did then he permitted now notice
[1:20:06] God's going back to the beginning for us
[1:20:09] to understand perfect and permissive God
[1:20:12] had a perfect first and original then
[1:20:15] sin comes in and God permits so it
[1:20:18] leaves the perfect and comes to
[1:20:19] permissive and he permits man to marry a
[1:20:22] wife legally and have children to her
[1:20:23] multiply and replen the Earth then if
[1:20:25] that's the way you're going to do
[1:20:28] it but you see it never was his perfect
[1:20:31] will so brother Bram says that God has a
[1:20:35] perfect will but man can leave the
[1:20:38] perfect will enter into permissive will
[1:20:41] but he will work it out for his glory in
[1:20:44] his perfect will so God has a perfect
[1:20:46] plan man falls into permissive but God
[1:20:49] will not leave Humanity within
[1:20:51] permissive God will work it back to
[1:20:53] perfect how he does it he's God I'm glad
[1:20:56] he's in charge of it so now God brother
[1:20:59] brandham in laying that pattern says
[1:21:01] let's go back to the beginning God had a
[1:21:03] perfect will man entered into permissive
[1:21:06] but God will work permissive back to his
[1:21:11] perfect so this is just so extending to
[1:21:14] me it's so beautiful Jesus says Marvel
[1:21:16] not that you must be born again to be
[1:21:19] born again is his perfect
[1:21:22] will but God allowed sin to come
[1:21:26] in and God then allows and permits your
[1:21:30] first
[1:21:32] birth but by virtue of your first birth
[1:21:36] you can be born again let's just think
[1:21:40] very simply today if you're never born
[1:21:42] you can never be born again so God had a
[1:21:45] perfect will man fell from perfect will
[1:21:48] he enters into permissive will but God
[1:21:51] will make it work out for his glory in
[1:21:54] his perfect will to be born again is his
[1:21:57] perfect will we come born of a woman man
[1:22:00] is of a few days in full of trouble he's
[1:22:02] how can it be clean how can it be clean
[1:22:05] how can it be clean the scripture says
[1:22:06] over and over and over again but God
[1:22:09] takes the first birth which he permitted
[1:22:11] and he leads us to a new
[1:22:14] birth God taking the permissive and
[1:22:17] leading it to his
[1:22:18] perfect says in Romans 8:29 for whom he
[1:22:21] did Forno he also did predestinate to be
[1:22:24] be conformed to the image of his son
[1:22:26] that he might be the first born among
[1:22:30] many
[1:22:32] Brethren according to Genesis
[1:22:34] 3:20 the mother of all living according
[1:22:37] to Genesis 3:16 a woman conceiv in
[1:22:40] sorrow and bring for or is it through
[1:22:43] Genesis
[1:22:44] 3:15 a son is going to be
[1:22:46] given that he might be the first born
[1:22:49] among many Brethren that if we
[1:22:51] acknowledge the birth of Christ we have
[1:22:54] to likewise acknowledge we must have one
[1:22:59] too to be born again from above puts us
[1:23:03] in affinity and relationship to God the
[1:23:05] same as Christ was to
[1:23:07] God he's predestinated as to it in
[1:23:11] future home brother says the Holy Blood
[1:23:12] that was created by God the blood of the
[1:23:13] life the creation of God Jesus was the
[1:23:16] beginning of the creation of God oh my
[1:23:19] you see it God made in creation he was
[1:23:23] Spirit the Bible say he's the beginning
[1:23:25] of the creation of God how did he
[1:23:27] begin in the womb of a woman he says
[1:23:30] which is what how then blind people
[1:23:32] can't see the serpent seed right here
[1:23:34] Eve was put here on Earth and before
[1:23:35] Satan ever touched her or anything God
[1:23:37] said multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:23:39] it's right but Satan comes in here if
[1:23:41] that was Adam's son then that Adam was a
[1:23:43] direct descent from God and you only
[1:23:45] take the nature of your parent he's
[1:23:46] trying to understand how Cain was what
[1:23:48] he
[1:23:49] was but he's teaching us another lesson
[1:23:52] because then he says and when you're
[1:23:53] born again you take the nature of your
[1:23:54] parent of
[1:23:56] Heaven you only take the nature of your
[1:23:58] parent Jesus was the beginning of the
[1:24:01] creation of God when you're born again
[1:24:02] you take the nature of your parent of
[1:24:04] Heaven and the word is the attribute of
[1:24:06] your parent and how can you deny it the
[1:24:08] word for denominations can't you people
[1:24:10] blind people see that's the seed of the
[1:24:12] serpent oh my Satan got there before
[1:24:14] Adam that was the seed but she received
[1:24:17] a seed the woman Mary what was it God
[1:24:20] himself he was the beginning of the
[1:24:23] creation of God I know that I've
[1:24:26] emphasized this before and the message
[1:24:28] lifts it up you bride are the climax the
[1:24:31] culmination the finishing of the
[1:24:34] creation of God
[1:24:35] himself if Christ was the beginning then
[1:24:38] you shall go forth he shall go out with
[1:24:40] joy you shall go out with peace this is
[1:24:43] the climax of The Kingdom amen yeah
[1:24:46] right here in a Courtyard by Marriot
[1:24:48] right has gathered together
[1:24:50] today in
[1:24:52] Phoenix a people that are very Climax
[1:24:54] and culmination of joy and peace and the
[1:24:58] kingdom of God the beginning of the
[1:25:01] creation of
[1:25:03] God I've been at an hour and a
[1:25:08] half brother BR says in spoken words The
[1:25:10] Original Seed I have two quotes two
[1:25:13] scriptures God in the beginning
[1:25:15] commissioned Adam and Eve to multiply
[1:25:17] and replenish the Earth that's how sex
[1:25:18] was given that's why it was but what
[1:25:21] caused the hybriding brings death
[1:25:25] now we know there's a lot that can be
[1:25:26] assumed in how brother Brandon phrases
[1:25:28] that from does God change his mind to
[1:25:29] this and the few years in between
[1:25:31] there's different ways that there could
[1:25:33] be an understanding but what God caused
[1:25:35] the hybriding but what caus the
[1:25:37] hybriding bring death we'll get to it
[1:25:39] this afternoon in the two wombs now in
[1:25:41] this God
[1:25:43] foresaw and predestinated a world of
[1:25:45] sons and daughters he predestinated them
[1:25:48] to be there Genesis 1 128 be fruitful
[1:25:53] multiply
[1:25:54] replenish the Earth fill it up I have in
[1:25:58] my mind my thoughts Sons and Daughters
[1:26:00] of God and because a hybriding
[1:26:03] disbelieve in God's word caused a
[1:26:04] hybriding
[1:26:06] God God puts it
[1:26:09] back God's put it right back again that
[1:26:12] you don't have to be hybrid
[1:26:15] anymore you can come right back to the
[1:26:18] original word and be a Son of God just
[1:26:21] like he was supposed to be at the
[1:26:23] beginning
[1:26:24] listen it's not just repenting it's not
[1:26:27] just being baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:26:29] Christ you have to know there's a
[1:26:31] promise to be born again by the baptism
[1:26:34] of the Holy Ghost and that takes you out
[1:26:37] of the being subject to a hybrid flesh
[1:26:40] and it put you back to a son or daughter
[1:26:42] of God that you were supposed to be in
[1:26:44] the beginning oh isn't it wonderful I
[1:26:47] can be a Genesis one son of God in
[1:26:50] Satan's
[1:26:52] Eden he said Christ couldn't help being
[1:26:55] what he was he was the son of God see if
[1:26:58] you're intended you see the word of God
[1:27:00] you believe it because why there's
[1:27:02] something new have you ever heard of a
[1:27:04] strain in a family a son kind of
[1:27:07] impersonates his father the mother the
[1:27:09] grandfather the grandmother that's
[1:27:10] strain in the family we all know about
[1:27:13] strain in the family especially
[1:27:15] Thanksgiving Christmas can be family
[1:27:18] strain but he's talking about a
[1:27:19] different
[1:27:19] strain kind of a line a DNA a
[1:27:22] characteristic you've heard of iten
[1:27:24] aren't you well that's the same thing
[1:27:26] from
[1:27:26] predestination you were supposed to be
[1:27:29] here in the right way at the
[1:27:31] beginning but being that you come the
[1:27:33] way you did you're subject to the fall
[1:27:36] perfect will permissive will but being
[1:27:40] that you're predestinated you hear the
[1:27:42] word and it brings you right back where
[1:27:45] you were
[1:27:47] predestinated and what makes you believe
[1:27:49] the word of God and turn down these
[1:27:50] other things it's because you were
[1:27:53] there's something in you it's a family
[1:27:57] strain it's seed that's been swn into
[1:28:00] this Earth something put there by God
[1:28:04] that backsliding and marriages and
[1:28:07] denying and difficulties and despondency
[1:28:10] and depression and cancer and sickness
[1:28:13] and backsliding in decades of wed in sin
[1:28:16] cannot snuff out the life in that seed
[1:28:19] why because God stood there in the
[1:28:21] beginning and he spoke a word about you
[1:28:24] you and he says it will come back to me
[1:28:26] the way I want it to
[1:28:29] be he spoke it there's something in you
[1:28:32] way back Yonder you was supposed you are
[1:28:35] made to live here
[1:28:39] forever you're made for
[1:28:42] that God put it right back to where you
[1:28:45] don't have to be hybrid
[1:28:47] anymore you were made to live here
[1:28:52] forever I know I've been thinking about
[1:28:54] it differently over the last few months
[1:28:56] about we saying going home and and going
[1:28:59] up yonder and and I realize one day this
[1:29:03] Earth is going to be new again that's
[1:29:05] right and we shall reign on the Earth
[1:29:08] right
[1:29:11] forever Luke Chapter 2:
[1:29:16] 8-14 just think of this Christmas night
[1:29:21] as the song calls it Oh Holy Night
[1:29:32] I believe it was Charles Wesley that
[1:29:34] wrote hark the herald angel
[1:29:37] sing glory to the newborn
[1:29:40] king peace on Earth and mercy mild God
[1:29:43] and sinners reconciled dozens of
[1:29:46] scriptures that he's painting in this
[1:29:50] picture in this song joyful all ye
[1:29:52] nations rise join the the Triumph of the
[1:29:55] Skies with Angelic hosts proclaimed
[1:29:58] Christ is born in
[1:30:02] Bethlehem and this third verse says hail
[1:30:05] the heaven born Prince of
[1:30:08] Peace hail the son of
[1:30:11] righteousness light and Life to all he
[1:30:13] brings risen with healing in his wings
[1:30:16] he's referred to Isaiah 9:6 Malachi 4:2
[1:30:19] light and Life to all he brings John 1
[1:30:21] John 8 Second Timothy
[1:30:25] risen with healing in his wings mild he
[1:30:28] lays his glory
[1:30:31] by Philippians 2 John 17 born that man
[1:30:35] no more shall die it's John
[1:30:38] 11 he says born that man no more may die
[1:30:43] why you were made to live here
[1:30:45] forever Born to Raise the sons of
[1:30:49] earth born to give them second birth
[1:30:54] this is what it ought to mean to us is a
[1:30:57] recognition that we are identified in
[1:30:59] his
[1:31:00] birth I'm represented by this coming of
[1:31:03] the
[1:31:05] Messiah and that night there were in the
[1:31:07] same country shepherds abiding in the
[1:31:08] field keeping watch over their flock by
[1:31:10] night and lo the angel of the Lord Came
[1:31:12] Upon them and the glory of the Lord
[1:31:14] Shone round about them and they were so
[1:31:17] afraid why
[1:31:20] Shepherds do we know why it had to be
[1:31:22] Shepherds because it was was a lamb that
[1:31:24] was
[1:31:26] born and ever since the blood of Abel
[1:31:29] began to
[1:31:30] speak it's angels that appeared to his
[1:31:34] kind Abel a
[1:31:36] shepherd and ever since the blood of
[1:31:38] Abel brother Bram talk about that blood
[1:31:41] from Abel from every goat every heer was
[1:31:44] bathed in the earth up until the time of
[1:31:46] the crucifixion of Christ why did it
[1:31:48] have to be Shepherds to join with the
[1:31:51] voice of Abel the blood of Abel that
[1:31:53] spoke of a better Covenant that spoke of
[1:31:55] better things and here they are watching
[1:31:57] the
[1:31:57] sheep and the angel come to the shepherd
[1:32:01] says fear not I bring you good tidings
[1:32:05] of great
[1:32:08] joy which shall be to all
[1:32:12] people with joy with peace Thou shalt go
[1:32:15] forth for unto you is Born This Day in
[1:32:18] the city of David a savior which is
[1:32:22] Christ the lord send Christ the
[1:32:25] Christmas and this shall be a sign unto
[1:32:27] you you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[1:32:30] swaddling clothes lying in a Manger this
[1:32:34] is the
[1:32:36] announcement we we we mail out baby
[1:32:38] announcements or we post them on
[1:32:39] Instagram however we do it nowadays
[1:32:41] we're even getting virtual Christmas
[1:32:43] cards now people don't even need to they
[1:32:45] stopped writing things on them and they
[1:32:47] would just kind of hand them out
[1:32:48] generically well now they don't even
[1:32:50] hand them out you just get it in
[1:32:51] WhatsApp here's our Christmas card I I
[1:32:53] appreciate them all whatever form
[1:32:55] digital or otherwise but this was an
[1:32:57] announcement of a
[1:32:58] birth and the angels Angel comes the
[1:33:01] angel Lord is announcing it and when
[1:33:04] it's spoken think of these words are now
[1:33:06] not it's not just falling upon Mary and
[1:33:09] Joseph it's not just the testimony of
[1:33:10] Mary it's not just to Elizabeth and John
[1:33:13] and these those that that are that are
[1:33:15] being brought into this understanding
[1:33:17] and a revelation is being given but now
[1:33:19] this is a declaration from Heaven unto
[1:33:22] you born this day in the city of David a
[1:33:25] savior which is Christ the lord and you
[1:33:28] will find him innocently wrapped in
[1:33:31] swaddling clothes lying in a Manger this
[1:33:34] is the language not of a poet not of a
[1:33:36] songwriter but this is the description
[1:33:39] of the heaven said that there's one
[1:33:41] laying in a place where there was no
[1:33:43] room for him he laid in a Manger wrapped
[1:33:46] in swallen clothes this is the savior of
[1:33:48] the
[1:33:49] world and as if immediately
[1:33:52] spontaneously
[1:33:53] if you could just imagine as the verse
[1:33:55] says and suddenly there was with the
[1:33:58] angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host
[1:34:02] praising God and saying I imagine that
[1:34:04] never has the heavens been lit to this
[1:34:07] Glory before and all of a sudden the
[1:34:10] singular Angel is joined with a host of
[1:34:13] other Angels my I just imagine that
[1:34:16] there's one that represents Christ and
[1:34:18] once the announcement is made all of
[1:34:20] Heaven declares his righteousness as if
[1:34:23] a br coming forth to join with the
[1:34:26] pronouncement glory to God in the
[1:34:29] highest could you imagine the light that
[1:34:32] would have shown the power that's being
[1:34:34] expressed and on Earth
[1:34:36] peace and Good Will towards Men Let it
[1:34:40] not just have a Melody to it but let it
[1:34:42] become a revelation how distinct this
[1:34:45] pronouncement
[1:34:46] was it doesn't even make
[1:34:50] sense man did nothing to this point to
[1:34:52] Merit it
[1:34:54] Israel had not finally got their act
[1:34:56] together and everything was ready it's
[1:34:59] like well here it is it's time it's time
[1:35:00] for the Messiah to come in the darkest
[1:35:03] in the worst the most depraved go back
[1:35:05] and find that they had restored the
[1:35:07] temple in Nehemiah looks like things are
[1:35:09] getting right what's the Book of Malachi
[1:35:11] you've done it for the last time Israel
[1:35:12] I'm done with you I'm turning to the
[1:35:14] Gentiles it's
[1:35:15] over yeah yeah all these ups and downs
[1:35:18] you finally you finally had the temple
[1:35:19] back you open the Scrolls you realize
[1:35:21] what you did wrong they fell right back
[1:35:22] into bondage again there was nothing
[1:35:25] about the Earth that would speak of a
[1:35:28] Genesis chapter
[1:35:30] 2 Genesis chapter where God says you
[1:35:33] know what this looks so
[1:35:35] good it didn't look like the seventh
[1:35:38] morning and he says you know what
[1:35:41] creation is ready for its
[1:35:43] climax the Christmas tree is trimmed now
[1:35:47] let's place our star at the top no it's
[1:35:49] at its lowest it's at its bottom it's
[1:35:53] depress craved the children of God
[1:35:55] Israel are lost and in bondage
[1:35:57] everything's upset they're under bondage
[1:35:59] to foreign government once again and
[1:36:01] here's what the angel says here's what
[1:36:03] the heavens declare glory to God in the
[1:36:06] highest we can all join in that but then
[1:36:09] on Earth
[1:36:10] peace what did on Earth peace how did
[1:36:14] man bargain this how did they come to
[1:36:16] the table and get this Tre but God just
[1:36:18] says I am declaring my Covenant with
[1:36:21] creation on Earth peace and this
[1:36:24] Good Will to men man did not Merit this
[1:36:27] will Humanity was not deserving of but

[1:36:46] joy be led forth with peace Redemption
[1:36:50] was Rising a new day was Dawning
[1:36:54] and brother Bram says this brother Micah
[1:36:56] brother LOL if you could come this
[1:36:59] morning brother Bram makes this
[1:37:05] statement God is fixing to make another
[1:37:11] creation he's creating mortal Earth and
[1:37:14] Mortal life Angels sing in
[1:37:17] heaven you could go that's in Genesis 1
[1:37:20] when God's created mortal life on Earth
[1:37:21] angels are singing in heaven but here
[1:37:25] he's creating a new
[1:37:26] life eternal life from
[1:37:29] man and he's singing to his subjects
[1:37:32] through his
[1:37:33] angels on the earth not in heaven heaven
[1:37:38] had eternal
[1:37:39] life they sang to the
[1:37:42] heavens when the Mortal creation come
[1:37:45] in and hear the immortal creation is
[1:37:48] coming in so just how it answers to
[1:37:51] Genesis 1 when there's creation there
[1:37:53] there's a singing to the heavens when
[1:37:56] the Mortal creation came in and
[1:38:00] here the immortal creation is coming
[1:38:05] in and now they're singing to Earthly
[1:38:10] people the first time to
[1:38:13] Shepherds he had started a new
[1:38:16] creation what was it a creation of
[1:38:20] himself God was made flesh and dwelt
[1:38:23] Among
[1:38:25] Us the Bible said in the beginning of
[1:38:27] the creation of God God was created in
[1:38:30] human form in Jesus Christ his son God
[1:38:36] dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh
[1:38:38] and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle
[1:38:41] God Emmanuel God With Us he built
[1:38:47] himself a house to live in it so he
[1:38:51] could reflect his word to his subjects
[1:38:53] through through
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:57] that you know what God
[1:39:00] is when you see
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:04] Christ you know what God
[1:39:07] is when you see
[1:39:10] Christ if you could close your eyes for
[1:39:12] a moment and just Ponder this scene as
[1:39:13] brother brandham describes
[1:39:16] it Genesis 1 and 2 when mortal creation
[1:39:19] came
[1:39:22] in he says Earth sang to
[1:39:28] heaven but on the day that Christ was
[1:39:34] born Heaven sinks to
[1:39:38] Earth why it's a new
[1:39:42] creation God created in human
[1:39:46] form he says you know what God is when
[1:39:48] you see
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:51] Christ I implore you to seek
[1:39:56] Him it may be kind of a catchy phrase
[1:39:59] but they say wise men still seek
[1:40:02] Him seek Him Today seek his face during
[1:40:06] this time or this
[1:40:09] season because you know what God is when
[1:40:11] you see
