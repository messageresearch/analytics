TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want to just spend a few minutes and I I know that we're limited here and I've got a lot on my plate so we're just going to read um I sent you one brother John uh uh most recently called Changed Das sub the most recent one if you could display that one okay good so brother Brandon spends a lot of time and we're going to read just a lot here so I just want to take a moment to just uh recap not so much from what we preached but maybe recap uh this thought that I've titled being changed and as we spoke to you on Wednesday there's something inside of you that takes place supernaturally and it has to be Supernatural that changes you completely amen we used that phrase last Wednesday that there's a part of you that everything changes but there's a part of you that one day will change but is in the process of being changed right now and the that's why the Bible would Paul the Apostle Paul would say things like add to your faith uh add to your virtue knowledge and let this mind which was in Christ also be in you and so there's something that of necessity and I can't emphasize this enough if we could say anything that there's got to be something Supernatural that changes your soul and it changes the man who's in the control room from that first nature carnal that sold under sin to a new nature that Paul calls in Romans at the law of the spirit and so as I spoke even to a man even recently a cousin of mine who our lives separated completely at 12 10 or 11 years old somewhere in there grew up with him was one of my closest friends and just was a real just a real bosom buddy of mine and our life went different directions my family moved maybe even younger nine or 10 years old and my life went a different way his life went a different way my family moved to stayed away and we lost communication lost contact and then years elapse and I'm older married children and I've wondered throughout this entire time what ever happened uh to my cousin and and it never was able to connect with him he's never on any kind of social presence like Facebook where I could ever uh look him up knew his family but never seen him would try to ask how he's doing but just almost completely lost communication with him until maybe just two weeks ago I get a email uh to our church website and it's a plea for a cry for help saying uh my and we grew up as best friends and and we grew up together and and I've seen the direction that God has taken in his life and I want to talk to him about my direction and so I gave him immediately took his number and called him and then we're catching up and reminiscing about life and um G sending him pictures of my children and he's telling me about his life and his family and his children and and I'm just watching the way that two lives two paths that were once so closely uh intertwined and taken two different ways and and it just wasn't very long long after just the catching up that immediately I could just hear the tone of his voice change and he just said I I've got to have help I'm my life is is going the wrong direction and and and and he said I've got this thing in my life it was an addiction to alcohol and he became a complete alcoholic and he starts telling me his life how that he's uh you know that he's very private person and he wouldn't you know I'm not going even going to mention his name today CU this was just something he told me and he said I don't I don't share this he said I've I just want to tell you you know we haven't talked in so many years he said I'm I'm very successful in life he started to tell me his income very very successful uh engineer and and just to told me I've got the you know the nicest cars and the nicest vehicles and I've got boats and ATVs and we take vacations and and I've got a lot of money I I I've got a good job I've got a good career I've got everything you could ever want in life he said but inside I'm I'm so broken inside because there's an emptiness inside of me and it just begin to express the condition of ma of a man who's not born again who's unregenerate who's uh you can you can and he starts telling me just expressing to me how that he said I'm I'm disciplined in my life and I I wake up every day and and I I'm up at 5:00 a.m. and I'm off to the gym and and I put in my exercise and I eat right I'm healthy and I'm I've I've I'm I'm you know very militant in the way that I treat life I'm very uh dis iined and very you know have my life in order and he said but there's this one part of me that I and he just begins to cry and be break down and he says there's this part of me that's so broken because I can't get control of it and it has control of me yeah and so his mind's just going both ways because he says i' I've brought my body subject but why can't I get over this one thing in my life and I just begin to tell him I said there you you have to understand there's a part of you that you were born a slave to that you were born already subservient to a master and Until you realize there's a nature inside of you and I don't care how much you discipline your life I don't care how militant you are I don't care how much by grit will and determination and and just human strength you try to bring your you try to bring your life subject there will always be a part of your heart that is slave to a master and until you're set free from that Master and until God changes something in you it's just in incredible to me so let me just stop here and say to you that I can't emphasize this enough that there must come something inside of your soul that supernaturally transforms who you are true and so even we we're going to deal with that just for a moment but but let me just say it at the onset brother brandom called it a paradox we read this in the message on Wednesday night and brother the prophet of God's dealing with the boy and he's trying his best to overcome it you remember that and he says but until he's born again until he receives the spirit he's trying his best to overcome it he'll never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it and he says and when he does it'll be a perfect Paradox how that a man born of a woman born of a mother born of a father with all the their complexes and strains in those families and now this boy is made up of all of The Faults and failures the good and the bad and he's made up of all those things and he's trying his best to overcome it brother bham says but when he when Christ comes into his heart it'll be a perfect Paradox what is a paradox something that can't be but it is I want to show you even after you're born of the spirit of God there still as we said a part of you that's being changed listen to what brother brandham says and he carth for you in Phoenix 1960 so if man he was made to want to be comforted so then if he doesn't accept God's way then he'll take a way for himself he'll try to substitute something to take the place of the holy spirit thank you all I want you to listen to it a man or woman that will not accept the Holy Spirit the comforter will try to comfort themselves with some violent substitute that Satan will present to them that's what I begin to tell my cousin you don't realize there's something inside of you greater that's longing for something higher there there's a thirst as brother Brandon preaches this but Satan has given you a violent substitute to fill that void Satan's just got plenty of substitutes but why do you have to have a substitute when the Pentecostal skies are full of the real why would I eat from a garbage can when a clean table setting full of choicy food there would be some something mentally wrong with me if I did that now what it is what it what a Pity it is to see the man that man would try to substitute something to take that place sometimes he'll try to ease notice his conscience by going out now this is life 57 just for instance for the psychology part of it psychiatric now let's notice just a moment the psychic view here is the picture of Christ and here is an electric fan it depends on which one I look at see if my emotions is moved this way or my emotions is moved that way if I look at that and long for that and desire that my emotion is set towards the fan but if I look this way my emotions and my desires are set that way right hello you here that's the reason Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart see it's where where your emotions is set where your thoughts is L of time we over complicate the ability to overcome the world we we complicate the issue of overcoming when it's really so simple it's where you have set your affections or your heart Jesus said where the where your heart is there's your treasure also and so brother mam says this he says it's where your emotions are set where your thought is now we're going to skip the zakus we're going to come back to that brother John you can display it listen to the greatest battle ever fought what's the matter you had to open the channel you've got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront that takes God's word he's the word and he stands there there's nothing going to stop him that's what's so look at the underline that's what's a matter with so many blowned up Christians because they don't clean out the channels they don't go down to the inside you've got to clean it conscience memory thoughts laying aside everything and coming from the inside out with the adulterated word of God that's the truth so there's something inside of you even after you're born of the spirit of God and God has changed supernaturally that inside nature yet there's something that has to always be clean it has to constantly be washed it has to constantly be cleaned and it has to ever be evolving and changing as we're going to find out here just in a moment in that subconscious or in that heart and the heart is a very mysterious thing even today even with the things that we could read to you in the Bible and the things that the prophet said yet there's still a mystery of the heart of the human Spirit maybe we don't even fully comprehend or understand but brother Brandon would say it this way you're made up of a Triune being you have body you have soul and you have spirit and within that spirit is an is a realm of emotion there's a realm of conscience reason and Imagination affection and you can ingest things in that spirit that affect you outwardly you know you take Co for example there was many people who never got really deathly sick some did but some never really got that you were never that affected by covid in your flesh but many people ingested the fear that came with that pandemic and it did more of a toll of damage than getting the physical disease ever could do you humanly right because you ingest something that's in a spiritual world that you can't see a disease that's as real as the physical disease hello it's a disease that has as much effect as the physical disease sometimes the spiritual diseases that people live with create more harm than a physical condition ever could and it's the diagnosis of the heart that inside of that human heart there's a there's a there's the potential for all sorts of evil and I I hope we can be transparent and honest to say that today inside of your heart if not guarded and checked with the word is the potential for any Limitless amount of evil listen what Martin Luther says you have that brother John I am more afraid of my own heart than of the Pope and all his Cardinals I have within me the great Pope self you know who the biggest enemy I got I got is William brandham he's always in God's way if I can just get him out of the way then God can go to work that's your worst enemy is yourself just get yourself out of the way and God can go to work you find out power of decision you find out you're the biggest enemy you've got if I can get William brandom out of the way Jesus can have a wonderful time but you've got to get him out of the way inil and a man never knows what it is to live a Victorious life until he's completely overcome who himself you can go to the next one it should come up brother John he says he says yes and a man never knows what it is to live a Victorious Life till it's completely overcome who himself that's the biggest enemy you got is yourself that's the reason you can't rise up in faith what stands in the way you looking for Jesus listen to this brother mam says I want to ask you something how many in here you know you got a subconscious don't you we are conscious of that that's the fellow that subconscious he says that's the fellow that subconscious is causing you all the trouble tonight it don't agree with this one out here it's scared and it backs up but when it when what your conscience your subconscious your spirit he says but when it becomes harmony with this one and this one becomes in harmony with God's word you're going then demonology but in America it never did work listen to what he says it's so much teaching in America so many different teachings till it has one of their own idea they'd say now my pastor said that man was a spiritualist well that settles it with you all you say I don't believe that now brother brandom but the way notice but way down in that subconscious it's still there you usually move by your subconscious just like a big ship going out of the sea the captain gives order to a little man that goes down in the bowels of the ship and oh he don't see nothing he just operates the way order come from above he don't know he said Ste he says steer this way or turn this way or Full Speed Ahead or back up he's just works according to what the man does up here isn't that incredible same message well usually that's the way your subconscious works it stirs you wi up he says it stirs you went up here you're trying to think this but way down in here there's something else moves you now I know that I've caught the patience by the thousands on the platform where that well there where they'll say brother brandham I believe that with all my heart yes brother brandham I believe that and yet down in there so intellectually I believe that with all my heart yet down in there yet down in there I think God if they believed it down here like they did up here I read that and I say Lord help me to believe down in here like I do up here he says cuz that won't work this here it's a subconscious will overrule that cuz subconscious will move on you notice what would happen even the prophet of God would begin to talk about this this with a child we spent time on Wednesday to to to show you this how that even that child is born and brother bam talks about in leadership starts with the mother goes to the father it's incredible when you notice even the love of God that that child first feels as a as a baby and he's starting his journey in life and as we said your reaction your adult life re is a reaction of of your childhood and you notice everything that's put into him all of the complexes that you live with today as as an adult were something that came in your past all of the fears that you have today and the things that you're afraid of of things most of the times that developed from the time you were just very small and very young and maybe a fear came upon you and you don't even know why you're haunted with it today remember what the prophet said there's a reason for everything yeah there's a reason for everything you're trying out here to accept it mentally but somewhere down in here there's a doubt or there's a fear there's a stronghold that Satan or a spirit that Satan is hiding behind and brother bom talks about this I just want to read it if you have that uh next PowerPoint brother um brother John jooba jyra 1962 in Grass Valley now what does a mother with her little baby when he's sick and Fring she picks up that little fell she holds him to her breast and she nurses the mother's strength into his own body through the breast and not only is he's satisfied this is the mother the child to the mother he's quietened he's screaming to the top of his voice he's all Disturbed but when the mother picks him up and puts her puts him on her breast and begins to hum to him Rock him back and forth he FS his mother I just want you to have this I'm going to tell you what it was brother uh John it should be called quotes Das mother yeah just listen while while he's pulling that up he says he feels his mother his head on her bosom and he begins to nurse and draw the strength from his mother into his body he's rejuvenating himself building up strength and also satisfied while day by day he's growing stronger and stronger expectation Phoenix and you can't do that Lo notice until you have love the prophet's going to begin to talk about what true love is remember what brother brandom says that one of the greatest weapons God ever gave man was Love Now true love not love like the world loves today or what the world defines as love but true love brother brandom says you can't do that until you have love perfect love cast out all fear isn't that a powerful statement perfect love cast out all fear so how do I defeat the Comm complexes in my mind how do I defeat that temper which was maybe caused by something inside of your spirit a stronghold that Satan has built how do I conquer it brother Matt do I need a psychologist no that's not what you need you need the great psychologist to come and discern your heart and discern your mind and bring healing through love perfect love cast out all fear if I want to con contribute anything to my success in the ministry is this if there's one thing is because that I I have loved people and people knows that it's powerful yes there's been one thing I can contribute to the success of my Ministry is that I have loved people and people know that you could take a little baby three months old he don't know nothing he's got a mind but it isn't developed he don't know notice this he says he's got a mind but it isn't developed he don't know who or nothing the doctors say they can see a light might see your hand but they can only follow it and he would just be kicking his little heels and screaming to the top of his voice well here comes some kind woman comes along passing him saying well well dear he just kicks right on he don't know who the woman is he don't know nobody but let that mother walk up just put her hands on him that settles it now he don't know his mother but his little Spirit knows there's something about that Spirit there there's nothing else can inject that Mother's Love to him do you not have that brother John that's that's you don't have that so that's all right that's all right no worries we'll just keep reading you with me and he says there's nothing else can inject that Mother's Love to him no matter how much the other person loves it and ain't the Mother's Love And She lays her hand on him he'll dry up see he's ready because that mother there is a love I hope you can catch this there is a love about her that goes to that baby that the baby's little Spirit recognizes that that's a love that no other love is mother is so great you know the first one that receives you in this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she Bears you under her hard and she's the first to know you the first in this life to hold you then when you're born she's one of the first hands that touch you and wipes back the tears out of your eyes she's the first one to patch you and to love and to coup over you in this life is your mother now I think that there's not enough honor we could give to a mother mother is first with the child she's a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way the mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has the responsib ability from God to place that child on the right Road and I think that's why mother has a special little touch I'm just going to keep reading I hope you're just listening I know of a boy in the city I think the mother's present now he's almost my age I don't say this to hurt the mother because that she has enough hurts as as all mothers but the boy drinks and he drinks heavy and when he gets real drunk he will come home and jump in the bed with his mother put his arms around her and he's got grandchildren but there's something about the pad of a mother that seems to take a different place than anything else can touch that is in this life humanly speaking you know a man like Moses if I could ever credit anything to his character it was because he had a godsent mother now I want you to connect this with the things brother brandom says the reason why you have so much juvenile delinquency Across the Nation is because of Parental delinquency but what was brother baram referring to he was referring to what we read that when that child is born he's born with a void inside of him and that love that affection that fing that nurture that care takes the place before that child ever receives the love of God he first is given the love of a mother and of a father and brother bam says but if he doesn't receive that love what happens he'll take some violent substitute to feel the love of that mother that Satan will give him yes we have such a juvenile crime wave Across the Nation I really think it started at home I think the parents begin to let go if that child had been raised up in a good oldfashioned Godly home I don't say it would be all over certainly not but it would certainly give that child the right kind of influence I think many times homes that children has been brought up wrong turned loose on the street just live for themsel while the mother stays in a barroom the father and so forth they don't take care of this child another is the other thing is they don't love it and give it the affections to take it up it's Young you've got to teach it to love and respect and to read the Bible God hath a provided way 1956 the lady was born in that nervous condition her mother and father died when she was a child baby and raised up and just tossed about everyone never had the proper love and care that a baby has you know mother I want to tell you something I know I got a little boy back there he's really rankly spoiled but I would rather have him that way I believe it'll make a better man out of him if God lets him live then to let him scream and cry and upset his little self listen a few years ago some Norm some normal modern witch doctor said let that baby cry don't pick it up all things like that don't let Grandma touch it and you know what they hatched out you see what it is a juvenile delinquency a bunch of neurotics God made a baby to be loved that's why he made a mother to love a baby that's why we're supposed to be this way God made it that way and anytime you upset God's program you must remember you're wrong and it will be wrong as long as you're up setting God's program follow God's program he was made to be loved I'm just going to skip over we're just going to move just to save time I believe you've rece you got the point loud and clear wonder and so brother random even begins to talk about this in himself and I want you to go to the PowerPoint brother John that we sent Wednesday the very first one and uh I think the slide if I send it to brother Aaron slide is 29 we'll just begin with that I want you to notice as brother Brandon begins to you you just heard him speak about this and how that a person can even no not that one brother I'm sorry the the other one that I sent glad we got a pilot amen and so brother Brandon begins to talk about this and he you notice where he comes from I was just even studying this last night I want you to watch as brother Brandon begins to relay this problem and you'll notice this even in his ministry he comes all the way through in 1962 and all the way to the end of June and in in 1963 actually and he's talking even in is this the uh time of the end sir and brother Brams beginning to talk about this trouble that he's having he knows there's something he's ingested in his spirit that isn't right and he's struggling to find this and he says I I just there there there's just something inside of me that I know the Lord needs to needs to deal with something the Lord needs to fix and the prophet wasn't really sure what it would be so in in standing in the Gap in 1963 brother Ram says and he's referring here to brother Roy's dream and he says one night the Lord woke him up one morning we were sitting he and I looked like in Jerusalem at the Lord's communion table and I was talking he couldn't understand it and brother Roy set him present looking at me right now and he saw it he called me up in Houston or out in Arizona or sent me a letter and I called him back notice this he says you were sitting there brother brandom and I saw this is slide 30 and I saw that big pillar of light notice this is Brother Roy's dream I saw that big pillar of light come in and get you and take you from the Lord's table so here's brother Brandon the Lord's table and here's that same Pillar of Fire come in Snatch his brother brandom from the Lord's table and you went Westward cuz he was sitting on the east side watching me go west and this light come in and taken me out said it was one morning like it was a vision God up in bed about 3 or 4:00 in the morning something like that and saw this happen and he screamed look like for days brother the bill come back Roy and I have been real brothers we live together and Hunt together and we're just brothers and he screamed for me till he was horse in his throat come back bring him back bring him back crying here come that Pillar of Fire coming back or a cloud and notice and he set me at the head of the table and I had been changed it was a mystery to brother Roy me this is where I got my title from me being changed to look different brother brandham takes a piece of paper and he writes out this word these words being changed and he says I lay this up here for something I don't want to remember being changed when I give him the interpretation of it now it's incredible how your mind immediately when you read this if you've not read this and standing in the Gap recently your mind immediately goes to this is he's at a table here's the Lord's table he's the head of the table here comes the pillar of fire he goes Westward and takes him out and and it's got to be something with the the revelation of the seals and it's got to be something maybe mysterious and the you know maybe it was that and you start to go a million different ways let's look at what this Vision was of when brother brandham says he looked different it was you brother brandham he took you from the table and then he put you back at the head but you were different you look different I lay this up here for for something I want to remember being changed now I'm preaching to myself could we stand and see a human being that's blind physically blind and know that he's walking over a cliff could we in our stall state of mind that we're in this morning could we stand and see a blind man walk over a cliff blind and not try to warn him it would be so cruel notice we would be so indifferent in our heart so the heart can become indifferent even as a Believer even with the love of God down inside of your heart yet through something that you ingest into your spirit and now your heart can become so indifferent you say how could you ever get to a place brother Ram say could you watch a blind man and you watch him walking over a cliff and he says how could you not stop him or warn him you would have to be so indifferent in heart could you imagine a person getting so indifferent that he could almost laugh see a blind man that can't see and can't help himself deliberately walk over gri well that'd be a bad thing to do nothing about it well to my brethren world over I want to make this confession I humbly say it that just about what I was doing or fixing to do I had been preaching for years and I had become an old man an old veteran preacher and had a a lot of hard battles now this is June 23rd doors brother brandom even begins to deal with this and all the all of the doors even in the messages before this even brother ROM's relaying how that all of the all of the doors had been closed to him and he said you know you were you were coming the multitudes they just love me oh brother Bill when I was Raising when the dead was being raised and the sick were being healed and we were having great healing revivals and great healing meetings and then he begins to he says but this when I brought the word you wouldn't walk with me any further than that you still you you took a different direction you you closed your door to me and brother bham says even when I was coming what brother bham seen is the climax of his ministry and he he relates this and S is this the time I believe is the message and he says when I was coming to the climax and there was something really great the Lord was about to bring and then you couldn't stay you couldn't pay attention you lost you lost your focus then amen and it troubled him in his heart it troubled him in his human spirit and he says I've been I've fought a lot of hard battles maybe I'm scarred and cut up on the inside from fights because my lot that the lord gave me was not back to kiss the babies and to marry the young and bury the old but it was to hold a two-handed sword at the Battlefront against the Ws of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness and fight it with the word of God till I seen the enemy defeated I've been cut deep many times I met a man that was a Christian he's got a great country right under lashka made up my mind that being that I had left here and gone west that I would take my wife and kind of trap her into something you brothers ever done that before you know just sort of trap her don't tell her I'd get her up here and become a guide and then if the Lord wanted me to do something I let my hair grow out and whiskers and go back in there and be a GU there's only about two or three Indians live back there in the country I'd just be a guide I'd help Bud if the Lord wanted me to do anything that I'd say all right Lord give me a vision I would slip on out then I notice I want you to notice just just the I'm so thankful for how transparent brother Bron becomes here he says then I being a nervous I say this kind of quietly maybe an neurotically type of person that I am and knowing that I was insufficient at the beginning for the job the Lord commissions him he gives him a job and yet even in his own Humanity he's thinking is the entire time I I am not sufficient for this job it's too much for me I'm so thankful that we had a prophet who is that real yes I wish we could be that real sometimes I believe Sometimes some of the trouble that prevents us is that we have a facade or something we put out in front and we're not honest H with other people and we're not honest with oursel if we'd be really honest with oursel we'd all realize we need an abundance of Grace and an abundance of Mercy in our life and if I receive that much grace how much more grace should I give other [Music] people there's so much pretense we we have sometimes brother brandom's throwing all that to the side he says I I was insufficient at the beginning for the job as many as complained that I did dude it was hard but I thought God why didn't you call somebody that could have done it I'm sorry but I failed the people just won't listen to me and I failed to do what I should have done somewhere because they won't listen isn't this the trouble that we always get into that immediately when we don't see the result that we think should come the blame instantly immediately goes to self-condemnation and self failure even as parents sometimes when you've obey the word of the Lord and you've you've raised your children in the way that they should go rather than just settling on the promise of God that God will get a hold of him Satan will come and try to oppress us with every kind of oppressive Spirit to tell you look what you've done wrong they turned out that way because of this and if you would have just done this and there's guilt and there's guilt and guilt listen the holy spirit will never give you condemnation to guilt and shame he'll convict you but he'll never get you to a place to where you're you're so low and you're so defeated he'll always encourage you you got to learn to discern the voice that's speaking to you and sometimes say that's not my heavenly father talking to me that's the devil talking to me and I'm going to cast that thought down and if you don't you ingest it as a lie into your conscience and then it hinders you from receiving the word they fail I failed they just won't listen my mother they just passed in the glory about a little over a year ago my mother father is a hunter I think think I got all that come from him in the stand cuz I love the woods I thought if this people that call themselves Christians if they don't want to listen to the message that I'm preaching let them alone I'll just stop it all together I'll go up to that mountain and I I know a friend before leaving here I might drop this in we'll hurry I Dreamed a funny dream listen an odd dream and I hope when my brother-in-law gets a hold of this he doesn't hurt his feelings and I hope it don't hurt my wife who's sitting present now but she knows it many months ago right on what it was around about October November I dreamed that I was roaming out in the dark I had no place to go and nobody cared for me and I had become a bum just a bum and I was cold I looked in the distance and saw a fire and when I got over there it was a city dump and they had ditches and the fire was in these ditches and between the ditches was slick where bums would sleep there to keep warm keep from freezing between these fires on a cold winter night and I was cold I walked up to this fire to get warm and it was laying full of bums and they were I didn't see any of them but they all like had stalls or places where their sleeping place was and I saw my brother-in-law Fletcher Bry when I woke up before I woke up flet said to me he said in the dream he said Billy I'll hunt you a place brother Bill you fed my children and weat when they were hungry and he was a daddy to them I'll find you a place here to keep warm we went walking by the bums places and finally come to a place he said I'll sit down here and said I'll walk up here and see if I could find a place I walked up and looked out into the dark cold night and I thought think of it one time God Almighty let me lead his church one time he let me preach his gospel and see Souls saved men and women come from around the world to speak with me for a few minutes and here I am now a bum and nobody wants me and I'm cold what must I do then I woke up I told my wife maybe it means Fletch is a need we hurri up we could find him and his brother found him so I come back down from can of the Fred with them the other day notice and in my mind that's an important distinction it wasn't in what the Lord it wasn't in his soul that God had spoke to him but in my mind I had made up if these people didn't want to hear my message all right they didn't have to I had preached now for about 35 years in the last 15 to 18 years I'd done nothing but just to the Lord I've tried to live so close and not close so close to him and not say a word till he would told me first everything then I come down from Canon and Fred and brother Roy told me his dream and he and I and brother Banks Woods rode along together just before we separated I say the people I've never regarded myself as KN as knowing this but people have said brother Brandon the Lord called you to be his Prophet I've never regarded myself as that but I began to get to the time that I was about ready to do it to think well maybe if I am I'll live back in the wilderness I'll live back in the wilderness and I'll be his prophet and if he wants me to send me somewhere I while he's not using me then I I I I'll sure to catch some fine fish and do some things of course that was kind of a selfish attitude see because I wanted to do that now it is isn't just exactly the thing that's to do and now I had that made up in my mind to do that so about got up about 4:00 got started driving Billy was sleeping we went into a place I was thinking on my mind you know what one of these days as soon as I can get the wife up here I won't tell her what I'm going to do I I I'd get up there and then I'm going to tell her I love this place see so well no need of us going anywhere let's just stay here and that's back from civilization 1100 miles from anywhere see way in the wilderness I thought won't that be fine I won't have to get a haircut now don't your boys start getting any ideas I won't have to dress up I'll just be a regular Mountain Ear what I always wanted to be and I said I've got some guns some people give me I'll be a guide like you never heard of I just love it that the Lord tells me go down and tell somebody something I'll run out and tell them and come back again and I'll help Bud and we'll have a real well we'll really have a place here now notice the prophet is not what you're not reading is that he's struggling in his mind as Billy's asleep and he's thinking oh I'll just backslide and I'll go to the barroom and I'll go back to alcohol and I'll just completely walk this isn't what he's considering it's not it's not brother brandom completely but in his conscience now because of a complex he had formed in his mind he was just going to take a little detour and rearrange the things that God had arranged in his life because he couldn't understand what was happening presently couldn't make sense of it he says I'll just I'll help Bud notice and we'll have a real place I love how he says this I was thinking on that it said carry out your plans and you'll be like that you notice brother random goes and even didn't put it on the screen here but he goes into a cafe and there's a man looks just like him Billy says Oh Daddy that looks just like you he says oh man just a real man you know not one of these little you know guys wearing a pair of shorts and slick back hair he say not one of those Ricky he said was a real barely man and he said just hair you know big beard and and he say daddy say brother M says oh that's the man I always wanted to be and he and and brother brand him says Billy you think so and he he says then and then here walks in a little man shriveled up just real real frail like and he said it been over with by campfire and he said had my had my exact profile was a bum and here's this here's another man look just like Fletch Fletcher Bry and and and brother random makes the connection here's two bums and now the voice comes to brother brandham and he says carry out your plans you'll be like that and notice immediately brother brandham Lord I I don't want to be like that said your wife will go too she won't live up there in them Hills like that and you'll become a bum just as the dream showed you you would I said I I don't I don't I I don't want to live I have to live like that I I I want to do something different but I was told that you called me to be a prophet and I want to live in the w is like the prophet but I was using my own excuse so I could hunt isn't it amazing how brother random talks about this remember in that sub in that spirit is the is reasoning it's so amazing how we justify these paths that our life has taken and we give every kind of justifiable reason and excuse he says I want to live like that I was just using as small excuse so I could hunt my own good notice carry out your plans so something brother Brandon wasn't this is incredible to me because it wasn't even unreasonable what he was thinking it's not like it's some horrible my goodness brother wow no I can't even believe you would ever even consider that aren't you a brother my goodness no if I told you that you know you had that plan you think well okay you know brother Matthew that's maybe what the Lord the Lord is calling you to do well I'm just trying to make sense of my circumstances I'm trying to make sense of what's happening and so then what is brother bam do he starts just fabricating and creating his own little route through life and you can God has a route that God has planned and charted your entire course from the beginning you took your first breath through your teenage years your adult years your all the way to your El where when your elderly brother there there's a perfect plan and a perfect path and a perfect route that God has routed it all the way from beginning all the way to the end but you can off of that route step off of that route and just create a little detour over here the pressure is just too great of the journey God's called you to and so the pressure begins to build and then you immediately a Believer filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but inside of that conscience you start reasoning things out I let the sick lay I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to that's wrong I had built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message and if God forbid that I try to compare the life God forbid I'll try to compare the life of now like Moses but it's exactly what Moses did the people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver them so he just left them alone and went into the Wilderness but God turned him around and he had long forgotten the suffering people why you said but how did this happen to God's Prophet because he was so troubled with what he seen around him he couldn't understand I've obeyed the Lord I've done nothing remember what he said I've done nothing but what pleased the Lord I had lived totally for him and I'm expecting because I've done that I'm expecting this result that this is what I'm going to see and now that I don't see that result I'm going to rather than trusting the Lord I'm going to begin to question and allow the devil to question everything in my life and pick it apart and we allow bitterness to get a door and access we allow you know disappointments can be very dangerous I just felt the holy spirit for me to say that to you disappointments in life can be very dangerous because at a disappointment you're at a crossroad of decision on what you're going to do with that disappointment you're either going to allow that disappointment to envelop you with depression and oppression and complexes and questions and the devil would just beat you like a punching bag you have a choice to either do that or to just trust the Lord and say God I commit it to you I don't understand it he had long forgot the suffering people and these notice this and these Ricky and that have so sassed the words and I've called them Ricky and Retta God give me to understand I shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches has got them that Spirit upon them they're in much in prison as Israel was in prison just as much as Moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that loveed Jesus Christ would serve him if they only knew what to Ser him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't you do this and don't you do that notice what brother ROM says here I want you to notice the next slide in the in the in the underlined portion and I wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you that the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him and brother Roy notice now he points back to that dream here's the note laying in front of him being changed brother Roy you see your dream and now I cannot go with a Ministry like that until I feel different in my heart yes that was a person who could be so honest with himself people that can be honest with you can be honest with thems when people can't be honest with you most of the times they've never really confronted that man in the mirror they've never really seen him for who he really is your greatest enemy you got brother Bram says as you right there in the mirror and this is the change brother Bram says you were the dream says you were different brother brandom what was different his attitude towards people and he says no matter if God did tell me but that is that change that brother Roy that seen coming something's got to change me because in my heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that they ought to have listened notice I ought to have heard the message they ought to have done it I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I can get that feeling there's no need in me going because I'd be a hypocrite he's so concerned I want you just and I'm just going to stop here for a moment he is so concerned the holy spirit is so concerned with brother bram's attitude he quotes Ricky and retas of what you've heard the prophet say on tape time and time again and is it because they weren't were they sassing the word absolutely were they rebellious against God's prophet and his message absolutely they were but he allowed something in his Spirit of how he looked and treated people and he's so concerned with how he treats unbelievers notice I want you to make sure you understand this this is denominational people people that maybe could never have the ability to accept his message but he's so concerned with how he treated or viewed or looked at other human beings and if you think God doesn't care about how you treat people and about how you treat each other come on friends you think God is Not greatly concerned on how we treat each other yes absolutely let me go just a little bit further you think God doesn't isn't concerned with how a husband treats a wife and his attitude he takes towards his children or the wife towards the husband or the child towards the father or the the father towards the son when that child begins to get rebellious and you allow something in your spirit and it clouds your love that you should project it's not not saying wink it at you know and and don't bring correction and don't bring dis but but you know there's a way to bring true Jesus said those that I love I chasten with with what with true love there's a way to bring correction and to say something you can have 100% I don't know why I'm preaching this but I'm just going to trust the Holy Spirit you could be 100% right in what you're saying but if you say it with the wrong attitude it won't help you it'll hurt you yes you could be 100% right on how you're perceiving a situation with your child but come with the wrong spirit in correction and now you've not helped them you've hurt them and you've hurt you you could be 100% right but if your attitude in the way that you project it isn't through the love of Christ I've got notice until I can get that feeling all these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart and I won't go out there being a hypocrite I've got to feel that that it isn't Ricky and Rett it isn't this Bunch it's God's children that's in bondage and I must go to them until I can feel that way I'll just loaf around preach some conventions and things but wait God bless you each one of you we hope to see you again real soon till then will you do this one favor for me now both ear on the tape also Brethren pray that God will place into my heart that's something that I lost out there in that complex because something whether brother bham had realized it at the time now he realizes something the Devil is a thief he comes to steal kill and destroy and he doesn't even realize himself but now he's realizing there's something that he's missing just something something maybe you know that woman who searches her house and she's looking for that lost coin she's just missed one and brother and the Bible says she sweeps the house and she searches for it and she lights a candle but you got all the other coins but that one thing that God gives you when he fills you with the Holy Ghost love and joy and meekness and kindness and a sweet spirit and love for everybody and love for your fellow brother that love that you f it for your wife when you're first married and that cherishing and that Joy of that child when he's first born but let life go through turmoil and twist and turns and then that that maybe just that one part you lose it and the Bible says she'll sweep her house she'll light a candle until she finds that missing pieace maybe you're here today and you could say Lord I'm going to light a candle I'm going to sweep my house until I have all of those virtues that you placed in me I want all of them and I'm not willing to surrender any of them to the devil I'm not willing to give up any part of the nature of Christ that he's put in me I'm not willing to let the devil have it I'm here today to say Satan I might have lost it but I'm a son or daughter of God and I'm here to claim it in the name of Jesus if life has made you an old crabby heart Harden heart hearted person and you're angry and you don't understand why God can give it back to you he can take that out of you and place the real love and joy of Christ inside of your heart I pray that God will place it in my heart that's something that lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex I had an interview the other day with my brother wayon in here standing in front of good man build himself around a complex another kind of complex did the same thing brother way isn't it incredible brother way passes away in that service loses as you go to the end of that tape and here's brother way here's brother brandom and he references him says just like me just like me uh brother brother way he says I've I've you've you've built a complex and he says there was I didn't that my brother way sitting here standing in front of good man build himself around a complex brother bandam goes and brother way passes away dies in that service and you hear Brother brandham go on tape and he begins to pray and you watch that prayer the way brother brandham prays it and here brother brandom is saying I'm just I'll just loaf around go until I get this right what God was doing now brother random goes to pray for for that man and he says Lord I I pray and I forget the way that t how he words exactly but he says I pray you'd bring him back to himself and the man starts breathing again his heart starts beating had no pulse and God raises the dead after the transparency and confession of a of a prophet you notice the power of honesty and confession when you can be honest enough to admit it to your spouse to your child I was wrong Daddy was wrong I should I've got that attitude when you can repent and bring bring real repentance to a husband maybe something you've done or to your wife or to your pastor you know what God can do the power of honesty when transparency comes God can bring Supernatural because why all the channels are cleaned out and Satan perfect love cast out all fear he has no hold he's got to let go then you ever become honest with your f with God honest with people the devil has no hiding place amen and God raises brother wave brother Brandon preaches that night flashing red light of his coming and he's trying to make sense of it and he says I don't know maybe I said the thing to brother wayy about his complex and then brother wayy was just too much for him thought I was scolding him or rebuking him and maybe brother the way was just so overwhelmed he had a heart attack brother Brandon do said no and he says or maybe the Lord was just showing me that even in the midst of my complex God's still going to use me in a supernatural way you know why because even with that thing in his Spirit that's not going to change his gift that God placed in his life right you say but brother Matt why is that important because you never judge where you're standing with the Lord based upon some Supernatural work or God using your gift or your ministry or God using your talent or the go how God's been that is no sign or evidence that you're right where you need to be with the Lord and pleasing to him am you can so easily do it it's just got a little something in your mind listen how he says you form a complex keep he says this you can so easily do it it's just you just get a little something in your mind keep thinking that way remember it just begins something so small that it begins to filter everything go back and check it with the scripture and see if it's right or not and then go from there on how do I know it's it's so amazing how many times we negotiate and we allow the devil to reason in our minds and reason and now brother brandom says you just get a little something in your mind you know it's amazing how much phantom pain people get you take a person who goes in audence you feel like you have pain it's called phantom pain so the doctor gives you a placebo something that maybe can fix in your mind you know this devil has sold so many Believers Phantom Pain well this person hurt me and that's the way that I am and it's because this brother did and because and maybe I'm not saying that that that can't be the case but a lot of times sometimes let me say it that way you're thinking something in your mind and that person has no idea about it whatsoever but you've allowed the devil to give you phantom pain over this person and this hurt and you know what friends what that is that's a lie just like that woman had a lie and it gave her heart trouble what do you got to do you got to cast down the lie and say I choose to believe the word and denounce the lie that the devil's trying to sell me just keep thinking that way go back and check it with the scripture and see if it's right or not and then go on from there don't lose your feeling for the people you must remember they're not made out of sawdust they're flesh and blood human beings and a soul pray for me all of you if you will you know we we have to keep that in our mind you you take a a I'm just going to deal with it here for a moment don't ever forget your children yeah they may have mistakes and failures and may disappoint you no like no one else good but they're not sawdust they're Flesh and Blood they've got a real soul and a real heart the devil might have tripped them up you take that husband and that wife you should be able to have patience you must have patience one with another yes CU none of us are perfect well amen none of us are without fault none of us are without failure sir none of us are without mistakes all of us have the potential within ourself to hurt each other do you realize that I don't care how born of the spirit of God you are and how much God has transformed you you have the ability within yourself in fact it's what you do very well you you destroy that's what we do we hurt that's what we do very naturally so we have propensity towards it we do it very well we tear down what do we do in our carnal nature we naturally we tear things down we destroy things it's not naturally in us but the spirit of Christ builds up the spirit of God restores the spirit of Christ reconciles it's natural for you to take your nature and become bitter and hold hard feelings or hold a grudge or not forgive but I say today surrender to this inner man down inside of you and say Lord I'm I'm going to I'm going to choose not to listen to my nature but to your spirit that's inside of me and I'm going to choose to forgive I'm going to choose to reconcile I'm going to choose to allow you to restore yes to do what you do best you're a carpenter carpenter son Jesus was a builder he could rebuild he could take what was broken and put it back together there're flesh and blood human beings and a soul pray for me all of you if you will God bless you now we're going to Bow our heads and ask brother R than it might have been this that I've tried to think this is the flashing red light of his coming listen that night it might have been this that I've tried to think of it this afternoon that I had stood here and with all my heart told you exactly the truth and tell you of my complex and make an open confession cause and ask you to pray and I want you I want to just ask you as we close the service here today maybe this would be your prayer and you could say brother Matt I just want to raise my hand and say I ask you to pray that my inside being would be changed could you do that today could you say Lord that's my prayer every head bowed every eye closed why don't you just stand to your feet raise those hands say that my inside being here's my prayer I'm going to raise a hand I I've brought I'm going to be honest enough and confess it but here before the Lord Lord Jesus is here now he knew that the Lord had this service planned he knew he wasn't finished Wednesday and God would have me bring this message today and I'm here just not with anybody looking around I just want to raise the hand to the Lord and say Lord with all my heart I'm going to tell you of all my complexes I'm going to tell you of all my bitterness I'm going to tell you of all my disappointment I'm going to tell you all of my pain I'm going to open up all the channels right now Lord I'm going to become humble enough to confess that maybe maybe I've lost something maybe it's been missing from me and my attitudes towards people and I just want to make an open confession I want to raise a hand and say Lord make it an open confession and I ask you to pray that my inside being would be changed yes [Music] that my inside being could be changed that could do as the Lord did I could look Beyond The Human Side I could look down to a I could look the way that God looks I want to I want Lord I want your vision of people I don't want my clouded up carnal way of looking at people I want to see them as you see them Lord will you wash my eyes and wash my mind so that I can see my husband I could see my spouse not in their failures and human weaknesses but let me see that that way that you see them Lord let me look past that child of maybe that dis maybe the way that they've disappointed me to the struggle that they're going through and I've allowed myself to my temper my bitterness and I my pride if I'd be honest to get in the way but let me look to them let me look beyond that flesh let me look at that Soul that's worth 10,000 worlds and let me love them with the love of Christ let me love them how you love them let me honor them and value them how you value them Lord and now now I want to ask you something that's much harder than looking at other people that way now I want you to say Lord let me look at myself the way you see me Jesus let me look at you let me look at myself not the way that I see myself as just a mess and just just a failure and I've got myself down in the ash Heap and I'm just graveling and I can't move on because of a mistake or maybe because something in my life Lord I want today to erase that image out of my mind that Satan has put there and I want to receive the image of how you view me before the foundation of the world how you why you loved me so much to save me I'm a Son of God I'm going to cast down any thought any vain imagination that exalts itself above the know knowled of Christ Lord Jesus you you're here Lord and that makes me so comfortable Satan's afraid Lord he's trembling right now he gets the he gets the most afraid when you're the closest and Lord we feel you right now Jesus near to us Lord near to hearts Lord I I believe Lord that today as I pray this prayer the work is Lord I've you've already the holy spirit's already done the job of opening up minds and that mind is now went transferred and now hearts are open Lord but it'll take you to bring us Supernatural healing you're the great physician Lord You're The Physician who really cares for them and loves them you're their Shepherd men stand in Lord in in places of pastors and preachers and ministers we're just your servants Lord but these are your children you're the great Shepherd you're that these are your sheep this is your son that you created this is your daughter that you made this is your family that you built Lord so now come and do what I can't do I'll step aside now Lord I'll let you do what you do best Lord if you've got to do surgery inside of that heart I pray God that you'd have your way have Liberty this morning Jesus have Liberty Lord God healing is here and I believe that I lift my hands to the heavens I believe that tonight today this morning I want just want to raise my hands and surrender to him now just step aside Lord and let you do a work inside Hearts let you do a work inside complexes you've exposed the enemy Lord You've exposed the lies of the enemy he's Defeated You've exposed him Lord and I just want to I just want to say this I just want to say it may it Quicken Into the Heart of anyone that's struggling here this morning the work is already done God's already done a miracle inside of you God's already done it you just got to raise hands and accept it and say Lord I believe it I'm not going to struggle with it anymore I'm going to reach out and and claim the promise that you've given me the works already done the battle's already over Satan you're already defeated it's already gone it's yesterday in your mind Lord now is a new day may we walk in a new day may we walk in the newness of life may we forget yesterday may we never dwell on it for another moment but bury it in the sea of your forgetfulness let us move into a new day take our hand I just pray Lord you take the hand of mothers take the hand of fathers take the hand of teenagers take the hand of spouses take our hands and lead us on Lord that's our prayer Jesus Hallelujah
