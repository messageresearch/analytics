[0:00] If you could just give the title there,
[0:01] brother John, for a moment before we uh
[0:04] begin with the statement from Satan's
[0:05] Eden, but this is the title is
[0:08] descriptive for a reason. It's
[0:11] vulnerability and our need for security.
[0:14] Um I wrestled a lot in terms just
[0:16] exactly what title to use. I felt being
[0:19] descriptive was important and even each
[0:22] word is was critical just expressing
[0:25] this to you at the outset in addressing
[0:28] vulnerability and our need and the
[0:31] necessity uh for security. And we chose
[0:34] security for a very specific reason. We
[0:35] hope to uh amplify that a little bit.
[0:38] But uh if you want to jot that down and
[0:40] keep this in mind, vulnerability and our
[0:42] need for security is what we're looking
[0:44] at under the the umbrella of perfect
[0:47] love. And as we've already read these
[0:49] scriptures here, we're wanting to
[0:51] address God's perfect love for us and
[0:54] even our love that is being perfected.
[0:56] And so I think there's just a lot of
[0:58] meat there for us to chew on and a lot
[1:00] of things to fellowship on. And I wanted
[1:02] to begin by reading a quote that I think
[1:04] we've referenced in every service in
[1:06] this series so far. Speaking of Adam and
[1:08] the woman, they were holy veiled. They
[1:10] were behind a holy veil. God had placed
[1:13] them behind the word and that was a
[1:15] protection and a barrier for them. and a
[1:17] boundary. And they said they were safe
[1:19] in God's pavilion. And so safety um is
[1:23] kind of a little bit of a kinship to
[1:24] security. And these is this is how God
[1:27] uh was dealing with me in this. They
[1:28] were safe in God's pavilion. They were
[1:31] alive. They had no death around them.
[1:34] They had perfect love one for the other.
[1:36] So that was to each other. Perfect life
[1:39] forever. They had perfect love, perfect
[1:42] understanding of the love of God. They
[1:44] had God's word and kept it. So we can
[1:46] see that they understood God's love and
[1:48] had a perfect love for God because it
[1:50] manifested in obedience. And then he
[1:52] repeats uh what he said just a few
[1:54] moments before. And they were alive and
[1:57] safe in God's Eden with no death at all
[2:00] around them. And what I want to draw
[2:04] from this very specifically and looking
[2:07] at they were safe in God's the secret of
[2:08] God's presence. They were in the
[2:10] security of God's pavilion and where
[2:13] there was safety. It was preserving
[2:15] life. And so this perfect love is kind
[2:17] of the middle of this that they have for
[2:19] each other that they understand of God.
[2:22] And this perfect love created a place of
[2:24] safety for them. And it was a place of
[2:26] perfect trust and confidence in God. And
[2:29] those are themes we'll just kind of
[2:31] continue to emphasize of trust and
[2:32] confidence. Now, this is going to be
[2:35] maybe a um a hard turn here. And I I
[2:40] want and it's just I this was maybe I
[2:42] can't remember just exactly where
[2:44] initially I was going to have it. It was
[2:44] going to be maybe at the end, but I'm
[2:46] wanting to move it now uh to the
[2:48] beginning despite all this perfection in
[2:51] the Garden of Eden. And we could read
[2:52] about how sublime it was and how perfect
[2:54] it was and uh and everything in order
[2:57] and everything working in harmony.
[2:58] Despite the perfections of the Garden of
[3:00] Eden, there was still a vulnerability
[3:03] that existed. Though there was they were
[3:06] safe and they were secure and they were
[3:08] alive and they had perfect love one for
[3:10] the other and a perfect love for God.
[3:12] Despite all the perfections, there was
[3:13] still a vulnerability. And so God had
[3:16] warned Adam and the woman of the dangers
[3:18] that were lurking in the garden. He had
[3:21] told them there there's things that you
[3:23] must obey. There's things that you must
[3:25] heed. And we know that when God placed
[3:27] them in this place of perfection, and I
[3:30] referenced this because I hope to come
[3:31] to the unconditional part maybe here in
[3:34] the future, he had specifically placed
[3:36] them on a conditional covenant. Now,
[3:38] that doesn't mean the perfect love was
[3:40] conditional. doesn't mean God's favor
[3:42] was conditional, but there was
[3:43] conditions to that uh given to them in
[3:46] that setting that they were in and there
[3:48] were certain promises given and there
[3:50] were certain uh things that were made
[3:52] available to them, but they couldn't
[3:54] bypass the provisions of God. They
[3:56] couldn't work outside of the protection
[3:58] that God afforded and then feel that it
[4:00] was without consequence because after
[4:02] all, it's perfect love.
[4:05] And so I'm just acknowledging that
[4:07] despite the perfection of it, there was
[4:10] a devil that was present, there was a
[4:13] serpent that was going to be possessed
[4:14] by that devil. And so there was dangers
[4:17] that were lurking there in the garden.
[4:19] And I would even go so far as to say
[4:21] because I think this is part of the
[4:22] burden that I have uh today. Despite the
[4:24] one flesh that the man and the woman
[4:27] shared in this wonderful union that
[4:29] steps forth in chapter two, their union
[4:32] was, and I'm just stating the obvious
[4:33] because we know the outcome of the
[4:35] story. Their union was obviously
[4:36] vulnerable to deception. Their union was
[4:40] obviously vulnerable to unfaithfulness.
[4:43] So this is something I want you just to
[4:45] think in the outset. It was perfect
[4:47] love. It was they were safe. There was
[4:49] safety in God's love. There was safety
[4:51] in love one to another. But yet despite
[4:53] that, there's some vulnerability. And
[4:55] even their union was susceptible to or
[4:57] vulnerable to unfaithfulness.
[5:00] Now, just to hopefully say something
[5:02] that uh qualifies that or conditions
[5:05] that enough to where you can move on
[5:07] with me and not just get hung up on
[5:09] that. And I think this is a key. For
[5:12] love, for full love, for true love, for
[5:14] charity, for God who is love to be fully
[5:16] manifested, God had to make humanity
[5:19] vulnerable.
[5:21] So perfect love just could not be God by
[5:23] force. And perfect love could not be God
[5:25] by constraint or by barriers and
[5:27] boundaries and all sorts of things just
[5:29] kind of cage man up. And so here he is,
[5:31] he's just kind of locked in a cage of
[5:33] perfect love. A and he's an involuntary
[5:36] love slave and he's there he is in the
[5:37] garden just on autopilot. uh doing
[5:40] things that pay honor to God and fulfill
[5:42] his word. God had to place man on the
[5:44] basis of self-will and and he did that
[5:47] in order that true love would be made
[5:49] manifest.
[5:50] Now, not only his love for us, but a
[5:52] love for him.
[5:54] He couldn't just program it and bake it
[5:56] into creation. He had to put it upon a
[5:58] basis where there would be those that
[6:00] not only did he cho choose, but they
[6:02] choose him.
[6:04] And so, for love to be fully manifested,
[6:07] there had to be vulnerability. there had
[6:09] to be uh um the susceptibility to
[6:12] unfaithfulness. And brother Bam even in
[6:14] the church age book says when Satan had
[6:16] worked out that which was necessary to
[6:18] God's plan. So this was necessary.
[6:21] Now uh to refocus us on our subject
[6:25] today, vulnerability and our need for
[6:28] security.
[6:31] We're we're using we're wanting to
[6:33] understand God's perfect love better.
[6:35] That's at the heart of all this is
[6:37] understanding God's perfect love better.
[6:39] And what we're looking at in some of
[6:42] these very specific things is removing
[6:44] the barriers. Uh you know how that
[6:47] perfect love removes the barriers so
[6:49] that our love can be perfected. That
[6:52] God's love is committed and and it's
[6:54] going to work and going to move. And
[6:56] perfect love is removing barriers to
[6:58] perfect our love. That maybe that's just
[7:01] the thesis statement through even this
[7:03] service today. these four services and
[7:05] at the core of this if I somehow get
[7:07] away from this and and you start looking
[7:09] more at uh you know a different
[7:11] dimension of this love everything that
[7:13] I'm saying is intended to understand his
[7:16] love better
[7:17] and that's at the heart of this and so I
[7:20] want to I want to say this at the outset
[7:22] make this part of the foundation the
[7:24] love of God and we'll look at the love
[7:25] of God from two aspects this is just me
[7:27] using a language so that I can
[7:28] understand it and hopefully this helps
[7:30] you to understand it that the love of
[7:32] God is vertical
[7:33] in the sense of the love of God is his
[7:35] love for us and our love to him. And so
[7:38] we're wanting to look at the love of God
[7:40] that way. How does how do we understand
[7:42] God's love for us? How do we show our
[7:44] love to him? And so there's a vertical
[7:46] relationship of the love of God. But
[7:47] then there's also a hor horizontal
[7:49] aspect of the love of God and that would
[7:51] be the love among us, the love from me
[7:54] to others, the love between us and other
[7:56] people. So there's a horizontal uh
[7:58] aspect and relational aspect of the love
[8:00] of God, a vertical, but then there's
[8:03] also a horizontal and in the uh like I
[8:06] say this, our love is imperfect in the
[8:09] vertical.
[8:11] Probably should have had a little bit
[8:12] more hearty amens there, but maybe the
[8:14] self-awareness is just too strong. But
[8:17] there is a imper our love in the
[8:19] vertical is imperfect. His is perfect
[8:21] in the vertical. His love is perfect.
[8:24] Our love is imperfect. And our love is
[8:26] imperfect in the vertical and even more
[8:29] imperfect in the horizontal. So the love
[8:31] of God is shared between us and the
[8:33] Lord. But then there's also a love of
[8:34] God that is horizontal between us and
[8:37] others. And it's even more imperfect in
[8:39] the horizontal. Now we use this phrase
[8:43] vulnerability and our need for security
[8:44] because I'm wanting to look at two
[8:46] related elements that are critical
[8:48] factors both in the vertical and the
[8:50] horizontal. And the most important I
[8:53] think is the vertical. his understanding
[8:55] his love for us and the love that we
[8:56] have for him back. But then it it
[8:58] manifests in the horizontal as well. And
[9:01] so there's two very critical elements in
[9:03] the horizontal and vertical love of God.
[9:07] Now I want to define vulnerable and uh
[9:10] so that in a way that kind of comes to
[9:12] the root of the phrase because to me it
[9:14] was so perfect for how the Lord had
[9:16] burdened me. The the word vulnerable
[9:20] comes from in the late Latin the word
[9:22] meaning wounding.
[9:24] So think of how vulnerability speaks
[9:26] about pain. It's from the Latin to
[9:29] wound, to hurt, to injure, to maim.
[9:33] I it means to strike or to wound. So to
[9:36] be vulnerable uh it speaks of a
[9:39] wounding. It speaks of pain. And I want
[9:42] to say this at the very very beginning.
[9:44] As human beings, we cannot love without
[9:48] experiencing on some level pain.
[9:52] It is impossible to love without there
[9:54] being some injury as a result of loving.
[9:58] And so it is no uh surprise, it should
[10:01] be no surprise that if you're going to
[10:02] be looking at love, at some point you
[10:03] have to begin to look at wounding and
[10:04] injury. And as we experience the wounds
[10:07] of love, this is I'm saying it at the
[10:09] outset. I'm just going to hammer this
[10:10] home for the rest of the service. As we
[10:13] experience the wounds of love,
[10:16] we might desire to never love in order
[10:19] to avoid the pain.
[10:21] Because we we recognize this isn't
[10:23] correlation. This is causation. That in
[10:26] my capacity to love or even in the sense
[10:28] of being loved that there has been in
[10:30] that some wounding, some injury. I've
[10:32] been strick stricken by it and I've
[10:34] experienced pain as a result of loving.
[10:36] I've experienced pain as the result of
[10:38] being loved. And it may be because of
[10:41] this wounding an instinct to say, well,
[10:44] I would just assume never love again to
[10:46] avoid the pain of love.
[10:49] And so when we use the phrase
[10:50] vulnerability
[10:52] and and and I I sense and know that this
[10:55] will be very real and and and if some of
[10:58] you are thinking this would be very real
[11:00] for someone, you might as well just own
[11:03] it that you're that one and you know who
[11:06] I'm talking to,
[11:09] right?
[11:10] And you can all say amen. Someone
[11:12] someone say amen.
[11:14] There we go. So vulnerability
[11:17] means the susceptibility to physical or
[11:20] emotional attack or harm. And and and
[11:24] that's maybe the phrase is just obvious.
[11:26] If someone's vulnerable, they're open to
[11:28] attack. If someone is if there's a
[11:31] vulnerability, it's this susceptibility
[11:34] to injury, susceptibility to harm. And
[11:37] and I think that we can all agree
[11:39] instinctively we don't like it.
[11:41] Instinctively we don't like
[11:42] vulnerability. that it we don't like
[11:44] being open to attack. We don't like
[11:46] being subject to harm. If there's any
[11:48] kind of susceptibility to physical and
[11:50] emotional harm, uh we instinctively
[11:53] don't like uh that feeling. And
[11:56] vulnerability uh runs against our desire
[11:59] for security and the human need for
[12:02] safety. And those are two different
[12:04] phrases uh really that have different
[12:06] implications today. I'll use them in
[12:07] different ways. But if there's in our if
[12:11] we're vulnerable that kind of works
[12:13] against this base instinct as a human to
[12:15] be safe that I if we sense some
[12:17] vulnerability there's this human
[12:19] instinct to want to guard against
[12:21] vulnerability uh just from a a survival
[12:24] instinct.
[12:26] And I would even say that security and
[12:29] safety implies some protection from
[12:30] danger that you are vulnerable to.
[12:34] So, I I'm reminded of a story I heard
[12:37] one time where a guy was sitting on a
[12:38] street corner here in Phoenix and he was
[12:39] flipping a coin and whistling and some
[12:41] guy came by and said, "Uh, what are you
[12:43] doing that for?" He said, "I'm keeping
[12:44] the elephants away." The guy said, "Man,
[12:47] there ain't a elephant within 2,000
[12:49] miles of you here." And he says, "It's
[12:50] doing a really good job then, isn't it?"
[12:52] And so, THERE MAY BE SOME things that
[12:54] we're we're doing because we're trying
[12:55] to protect ourselves, but there's no
[12:57] threat.
[12:58] There was really no vulnerability. So,
[13:00] that isn't necessarily keeping you safe.
[13:02] So even security and safety really are
[13:04] only relevant if there is an actual
[13:06] danger.
[13:08] Safety and security only mean something
[13:10] if there is a legitimate vulnerability.
[13:14] Now safe as an adjective just means free
[13:17] from danger. If you're safe, you're free
[13:18] from danger or I think more
[13:20] appropriately as we mean it today, not
[13:21] exposed to danger or pain.
[13:25] One might say like a safe investment.
[13:27] Someone might say if it's safe, they're
[13:28] what they're talking about is well
[13:29] there's really no risk here. there's
[13:31] really no risk of loss or injury. And
[13:33] that's maybe the idea we think in terms
[13:35] of being safe. And safety is that
[13:38] freedom or immunity from harm or danger.
[13:41] So it's not saying that it doesn't
[13:43] exist, but there's some immunity from
[13:44] it. Doesn't mean that it's not looming,
[13:46] but there's some freedom from it where
[13:48] you're not exposed to that danger.
[13:49] You're not uh you're not at harm uh uh
[13:52] uh placed in harm's way. So safe and
[13:54] safety kind of speak of the the harm or
[13:56] the injury, the safety or the immunity
[13:57] from it. But security
[14:00] a as we'd like to define it is similar
[14:02] in the sense that it's a condition of
[14:03] being safe from danger or harm. So these
[14:06] are kind of related phrases
[14:08] and and I don't want to get too deep
[14:10] into this but our need for security and
[14:13] our desire to be safe in instigates many
[14:15] actions cause us to act on many
[14:17] different levels and and to do many
[14:19] things to save ourselves from loss to
[14:21] save ourselves from injury. So this base
[14:23] human need for safety and this desire to
[14:25] be secure uh causes us to act in a
[14:28] number of different ways
[14:31] and this is very important. If you're
[14:33] taking notes I'd find some way to jot
[14:34] this down. This base human need a this
[14:39] human condition and even if you want to
[14:40] call it a human weakness is at the heart
[14:43] of God's design for love and faith. This
[14:46] base human need is at the heart of God's
[14:48] design for love and faith. It is a it it
[14:52] is a necessity
[14:54] that that uh faith and love are a
[14:59] necessity as a result of our human need
[15:03] for safety and security.
[15:06] in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5:es 8-9
[15:11] and I'm reading this uh kind of to or to
[15:15] re-emphasize how we're taught in the
[15:17] message how that faith and love are
[15:18] relation and we'll see them here married
[15:20] together but let us who are of the day
[15:22] be sober putting on the breastplate of
[15:25] faith and love and for in helmet the
[15:27] hope of salvation
[15:29] for God hath not appointed us to wrath
[15:32] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[15:34] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[15:37] Notice how the breastplate
[15:40] is of faith and love.
[15:44] That they are forged together as one
[15:46] thing. And that together they form
[15:49] protect the for they form the protection
[15:51] of our hearts and our life. That is is
[15:54] symbolic of even our emotional state and
[15:56] our well-being and our our our physical
[15:59] state of being. That there is a forged
[16:01] together. Faith and love form the
[16:03] protection of our hearts.
[16:05] and love which is speaks of affection
[16:08] and faith which speaks of trust and
[16:10] confidence are working together.
[16:13] That is the the it's the breastplate of
[16:14] faith and love. It's not just the
[16:16] breastplate of faith. It's not just the
[16:18] breastplate of love, but this is
[16:19] something that's used to show the
[16:21] relationship between the two and they're
[16:23] forged together to make one piece that
[16:26] together they form a protection. and and
[16:28] this faith and love working together,
[16:30] love which is affection, uh faith which
[16:33] is trust and confidence, they work
[16:34] together to protect us.
[16:37] A and to protect life.
[16:39] But now if you want to think about the
[16:41] opposite would be fear and doubt.
[16:45] And fear is a withdrawal, some a
[16:48] repulsion, a turning away. And doubt is
[16:51] a a distrust. So those are the opposites
[16:55] to faith and love, fear and doubt. And
[16:57] we see here in this scripture that
[16:59] faith, hope, and charity are working
[17:00] together. And we could take not a number
[17:04] of scriptures now in the in the view of
[17:07] faith, hope, and love. And how that
[17:08] they're all working together using
[17:10] scriptural terms to make us not ashamed.
[17:12] Amen.
[17:13] That they're working together to cause
[17:15] us to not be fearful of judgment, TO NOT
[17:18] BE AFRAID OF REJECTION. Because he says
[17:20] the breastplate of plate of faith and
[17:22] love and the helmet of the hope of
[17:24] salvation. Why? We have these things for
[17:26] God hath not appointed us to wrath but
[17:29] to obtain salvation. So we're saying
[17:31] these things are our shield and they
[17:33] work together from US EVER FEARING THE
[17:35] WRATH of God. Amen.
[17:37] I hope this helps us with in the
[17:39] vertical
[17:40] and there are a number of scriptures
[17:42] that are constantly
[17:44] if maybe constantly is not the word it's
[17:46] only if you keep reading it but it's
[17:48] consistently the Bible's consistent in
[17:50] addressing our human complexes about
[17:52] fear uh complexes and fear about love
[17:57] and trust
[18:00] it's this isn't psychology
[18:03] uh in in a negative sense and I'm very
[18:06] careful to use the word in a positive
[18:07] sense too. I know what can happen if you
[18:09] do that. But there's the scriptures
[18:12] consistently address our our human
[18:15] condition and and human complexes, human
[18:18] fears and human perceptions about love
[18:21] and trust.
[18:23] And if you want to begin to look there,
[18:25] we're not going to come to it just yet,
[18:26] but in First John chapter 4,
[18:29] I I want to say this before we read it
[18:31] again because I'm wanting us to look at
[18:32] this.
[18:34] If I could say even from the standpoint
[18:36] of vulnerability
[18:38] and and recognize that the need for
[18:41] emotional security and the need for
[18:45] emotional safety is at the heart of
[18:48] affirming God's love.
[18:50] Amen.
[18:51] That that God is affirming his love
[18:55] not so much that it's just something to
[18:57] do, but it's done because it meets a
[19:00] need.
[19:00] Right. Amen. And that the emphasis and
[19:02] even the way that God chooses to express
[19:05] his love to us and repeat it and affirm
[19:08] it is as a result of our need for
[19:11] emotional security and emotional safety.
[19:14] And within a relationship, emotional uh
[19:18] safety would just speak of a
[19:20] relationship that's open uh where both
[19:22] people are open among each other uh
[19:24] where you're vulnerable to each other.
[19:25] you're trusting and and and if there if
[19:28] it's NOT IF THERE'S NOT EMOTIONAL SAFETY
[19:31] where we're vulnerable, we're honest,
[19:33] we're trusting. Uh then if there's not
[19:35] that emotional safety, then it's
[19:37] distrust and suspicion.
[19:40] And that's that would be the condition
[19:41] of an emotionally safe uh relationship.
[19:46] And I'm not afraid maybe to use modern
[19:48] parliament. Maybe parliament isn't a
[19:50] modern word to use uh modern slang or
[19:53] language or phrases or buzzwords. Uh uh
[19:57] a as we huddle here as a church. I'm not
[20:00] afraid to use these phrases because
[20:03] there's a certain way that maybe the
[20:04] world talks about these things, BUT THE
[20:06] BIBLE'S TALKED ABOUT IT LONG BEFORE THE
[20:08] world did.
[20:10] And science is still just stumbling
[20:11] around in God's great laboratory. And so
[20:14] this emotional safety is one thing to
[20:17] where it things are open and trusting
[20:18] and we understand one another. But then
[20:21] there is a emotional security which
[20:24] ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT THE SAFETY of the
[20:26] relationship but emotional security.
[20:28] This is critical I think for me and
[20:30] trying to express this. These are things
[20:31] I've been wrestling with for some time
[20:33] TO MINISTER ON THAT EMOTIONAL security
[20:35] would be you being at ease with being
[20:38] vulnerable.
[20:40] that a a relationship there can be
[20:42] emotional safety and there's openness
[20:45] and there's honesty and you recognize
[20:46] you're vulnerable and you're YOU'RE
[20:47] SUBJECT TO ONE ANOTHER AND THERE'S
[20:49] MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY but security
[20:51] EMOTIONAL SECURITY BEING I'M at ease
[20:53] with that
[20:54] because there are situations where the
[20:56] opposite of that is insecurity
[20:58] and insecurity is I'm not at ease being
[21:01] vulnerable there are certain dynamics
[21:02] and things and structures and
[21:04] relationships and phrases and things
[21:06] that trigger me and I feel I feel uneasy
[21:09] AND I FEEL VULNERABLE AND I'M INSECURE
[21:11] WITH BEING VULNERABLE.
[21:13] And so to use a phrase I think that
[21:15] would be kind of the uh the the trendy
[21:19] word would be psychological safety.
[21:23] And I believe the Bible is addressing
[21:24] psychological safety.
[21:27] It's the state of reduced interpersonal
[21:29] risk. And I know you all understand
[21:30] that. So I'm just going to define it for
[21:33] myself. I'm just going to say, "Hey
[21:34] Google, if you could define for me what
[21:37] in the world is interpersonal risk." but
[21:39] has to do with your feelings of
[21:41] selfworth.
[21:42] So if there's psychological safety, it's
[21:45] your emotional well-being. It it's the
[21:48] way you view yourself. A and the reduced
[21:52] interpersonal risk is I I am not afraid
[21:55] of the loss of one's favor. I I I'm not
[21:58] afraid of be respect being lost. I I I'm
[22:00] not afraid of losing my social standing
[22:03] that I can and it's more of a buzzword
[22:05] within corporate structure that we want
[22:06] to create an environment uh that fosters
[22:08] creativity and hard work and allow
[22:11] people to try a a and to be ambitious
[22:14] and so you don't create AN ENVIRONMENT
[22:15] WHERE IF somebody makes MISTAKE
[22:17] EVERYBODY'S LIKE [screaming]
[22:19] RIGHT AND everybody's laughing at the
[22:20] dude in cubicle 4 who just messed
[22:22] everything up but everybody's like hey
[22:23] we like it when you try we like it when
[22:25] you ask questions and and so
[22:27] psychological safety means that I can I
[22:30] can try. I I CAN DO MY BEST and and I
[22:33] can ask questions and I and I'm not
[22:34] afraid UH TO BE MYSELF UH BECAUSE I KNOW
[22:37] THAT IF IF I DO make a mistake OR IF
[22:39] SOMETHING'S WRONG, I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE
[22:41] FAVOR. I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE RESPECT.
[22:42] I'm not going to lose social standing.
[22:44] So when someone FEELS THAT THEY'RE IN A
[22:47] PLACE OF emotional safety or even
[22:48] they're emotionally secure, IT HAS TO DO
[22:51] WITH THE person's self-esteem
[22:54] and and their own value and the
[22:57] resulting FEAR OF REJECTION OR the
[22:59] resulting FEAR OF BEING SHAMED FOR
[23:01] MAKING MISTAKES.
[23:03] I I think we should we should be
[23:05] thinking very hard about this just how
[23:08] easy just how instinctive shame is as a
[23:12] tool.
[23:14] And and I believe that if you have a
[23:16] relationship with shame, you ought to
[23:19] break up right now.
[23:25] And so the reduction of interpersonal
[23:27] risk
[23:28] as it relates to emotional security and
[23:33] being an emotionally safe relationship
[23:35] in the vertical and even in the
[23:36] horizontal. This is important to realize
[23:39] that just to be emotionally safe or even
[23:43] emotionally secure to be in a place of
[23:44] psychological safety does not imply the
[23:47] lack of consequence.
[23:50] It does not uh require the lack of
[23:53] consequence.
[23:55] There is where there is emotional safety
[23:57] and emotional security in a
[23:59] relationship. It means that there's no
[24:01] fear of rejection, no fear of shaming,
[24:04] but it doesn't mean that there's not a
[24:06] consequence that may need to be
[24:07] addressed or worked through.
[24:10] But it's about creating an atmosphere of
[24:12] trust.
[24:13] Amen.
[24:13] Where we're not shamed. We're not
[24:15] rejected for failure.
[24:17] We're not subject to embarrassment for
[24:20] doing something wrong.
[24:22] And I've used a language that hopefully
[24:24] some of you can relate to because it's
[24:26] exactly what John is addressing in 1
[24:27] John 4:16 to18.
[24:30] He says, "We have known and believe the
[24:33] love that God hath to us. God is love
[24:35] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[24:36] God and God in him." He's wanting to
[24:39] affirm the love that God hath to us. And
[24:42] on the basis that we have known and
[24:44] believed the love that God hath to us.
[24:45] He says herein is our love made perfect
[24:48] that we may have boldness in the day of
[24:51] judgment. Remember that phrase because
[24:53] as he as he is so are we in this world.
[24:57] There is no fear in love but perfect
[25:00] love casteth out fear because fear hath
[25:03] torment. I want to I'm wanting to unpack
[25:05] this. We've been doing it slowly and
[25:08] hopefully incrementally to where it's
[25:10] more impactful with each step. And I
[25:12] think today we're going to take another
[25:13] step that is liberating. A and if you
[25:16] haven't fired off that miss up to shame
[25:18] yet, you're you're going to maybe be
[25:19] able to form just the right words to
[25:21] say, "Shame, it's time for you to leave
[25:24] because I'm not subject to it anymore."
[25:26] He said, "There's no fear in love, but
[25:28] perfect love casteth out fear BECAUSE
[25:31] FEAR HATH TORMENT." JOHN'S JUST BEING
[25:33] RAW ABOUT THIS. WHY DOES PERFECT LOVE
[25:35] CAST OUT FEAR? LET'S JUST BE HONEST.
[25:37] FEAR HATH TORMENT. HE THAT fearth is not
[25:40] made perfect in love.
[25:43] Now focus on this.
[25:46] And I say focus intently, not so much in
[25:48] the sense that we would ponder it a and
[25:51] just dwell on it, but really try to grab
[25:53] a hold of this. The fact when he says
[25:56] there is no fear in love,
[25:59] it's specifically referring to not
[26:01] fearing God when it comes to his opinion
[26:03] of you.
[26:04] That's good. because it says that we
[26:07] might have boldness in the day of
[26:10] judgment.
[26:11] Right?
[26:12] There is no fear in love. SO WHEN HE
[26:15] SAYS there is no fear IN LOVE, I KNOW WE
[26:16] JUST immediately think in general.
[26:19] Now when it comes to love, there is no
[26:20] fear in love. And if there's ANY FEAR OR
[26:22] DOUBT, THEN I DON'T HAVE LOVE AND and it
[26:24] kind of causes that cycle of questioning
[26:25] and that litmus test. But he says there
[26:27] is no fear in love. And he's
[26:29] SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO JUDGMENT,
[26:31] WHICH IS GOD'S OPINION OF YOU. And so he
[26:34] says, "BECAUSE FEAR HATH TORMENT."
[26:37] AND THIS TORMENT HE'S REFERRING TO IS
[26:40] THE ANTICIPATION of deserved punishment.
[26:44] Please
[26:46] just uh
[26:49] UNBBURDEN YOURSELF OF ANY SUSPICIOUS
[26:51] intent on my part. and and and even if
[26:55] you would QUESTION MY MOTIVE, TRUST IN A
[26:58] GOD THAT CAN STAND BETWEEN me and you
[27:01] and give you what you NEED BECAUSE I
[27:04] WOULD SAY THAT THE REALITY IS YOU NEED
[27:07] him to speak to you
[27:09] and you NEED HIM TO SHARE THESE things
[27:11] with you AND I WOULDN'T WANT EITHER OF
[27:14] US TO GET IN THE WAY. AMEN.
[27:17] AND SO HE'S SAYING THAT FEAR HATH
[27:20] TORMENT.
[27:21] AND SO THERE IS THIS TORMENT is this
[27:24] anticipation of deserved punishment. And
[27:27] we know this is true
[27:30] that if you anticipate punishment, it's
[27:32] a foretaste of it. Come on, kids.
[27:35] Where's the amens? Right? When you know
[27:38] a SPANKING IS COMING, IT'S JUST AS BAD
[27:40] AS THE SPANKING.
[27:42] AND and to the child protection services
[27:44] by spanking we mean grounding you from
[27:45] IPADS
[27:47] WHEN YOU KNOW it's coming YOU IT IS
[27:50] ALMOST AS BAD AS IT
[27:53] AND SO PAUL IS SAYING FEAR HAS TORMENT
[27:56] AND FEAR OF PUNISHMENT COME ON LISTEN
[27:59] FEAR OF PUNISHMENT IS ALMOST THE
[28:02] EQUIVALENT OF THE PUNISHMENT
[28:05] SO GOD WOULD [screaming] NOT WANT YOU HE
[28:07] DOESN'T WANT TO PUNISH YOU NOR WOULD HE
[28:09] WANT YOU TO BE IN A STATE OF ANTICIPATED
[28:12] IT BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT EVEN THAT
[28:15] EVEN THAT ITSELF IS A FORETASTE OF THAT
[28:18] WHICH you don't deserve.
[28:21] And therefore fear is self-punishing.
[28:25] It is as if we lock ourselves in a cage
[28:27] that we beat our own heads against.
[28:31] And if we fear God, this is what this is
[28:34] what John is addressing. If we fear that
[28:36] God will shame us,
[28:39] if we fear THAT GOD WILL REJECT us or
[28:42] abandon us,
[28:44] then John is saying his love is not
[28:47] perfected in you.
[28:48] Right?
[28:49] So, do you recognize that when we use
[28:51] the litmus test that there's no fear in
[28:52] love and we think of the horizontal or
[28:55] we even think of this part of the
[28:56] vertical, we're looking at it wrong.
[28:58] He's saying that when it comes TO HIS
[29:00] LOVE FOR YOU, you ought not TO FEAR HIS
[29:03] LOVE. YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE AFRAID OF HIS
[29:05] OPINION OF YOU. THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY
[29:08] FEAR OF GOD AND HIS OPINION OF YOU, THEN
[29:10] CLEARLY HIS LOVE HASN'T ACCOMPLISHED ALL
[29:14] THAT IT CAN and will accomplish for you.
[29:19] It's not even evidence. You can't even
[29:21] use it as evidence he doesn't love you.
[29:22] You can't use it AS EVIDENCE THAT YOU
[29:24] DON'T LOVE HIM OR YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[29:25] IT JUST MEANS YOU HAVE NOT YET FULLY
[29:28] benefited
[29:30] from this perfect love.
[29:33] So he is not referring to doubt and fear
[29:35] and anxiety in general. But when he says
[29:38] THERE IS NO FEAR IN LOVE, HE'S
[29:40] SPECIFICALLY referring to his love for
[29:41] us
[29:43] and our love for him.
[29:47] I almost feel that we could just start
[29:49] the griddle.
[29:52] You know, Go ahead. Please sit down.
[29:54] Don't
[29:57] Whatever you do, stay in your seat,
[29:58] Mother Michael.
[30:00] But fear and doubt now again they are
[30:03] related.
[30:05] And so God is recognizing this. He
[30:08] doesn't want there to be any fear of his
[30:09] love.
[30:10] Amen.
[30:11] And and no fear of your love for him in
[30:14] that because the opposite fear and doubt
[30:17] are related. And just as you cannot have
[30:19] faith without love, you cannot have
[30:21] doubt without fear. Fear without doubt.
[30:24] And so the word is addressing our own
[30:26] complexes and fears when it comes to
[30:29] love.
[30:31] John is using a language that's honest
[30:33] about vulnerability.
[30:35] He's using a language that's honest
[30:37] about security.
[30:39] AND SO IN FIRST JOHN CHAPTER 3 verse 20,
[30:42] this is in the prior chapter. And I
[30:43] think this is this is connected with
[30:45] John is kind of reinforcing in the next
[30:48] uh the next verses in the next chapter
[30:50] in and and I want let let me reset that
[30:53] recognize how the word is addressing
[30:56] right
[30:57] security
[30:58] vulnerability safety trust and the trust
[31:02] issues that arise and the and the
[31:04] suspicions and fears that humans have
[31:06] and even how we have fight orflight
[31:08] responses or freeze and and there are
[31:10] certain things kind of baked into us by
[31:12] evolution and BY GENETICS THAT WE'RE
[31:14] GOING TO ACT INSTINCTIVELY in certain
[31:15] ways and when we perceive threats or
[31:17] when we see things that are triggers
[31:18] that human beings JUST HAVE A A WAY OF
[31:20] ACTING A CERTAIN WAY AND SO GOD is kind
[31:22] of approaching us in a way saying look I
[31:25] get it
[31:26] right being very cautious I understand
[31:29] these are things you're going to have to
[31:30] wrestle with and so John says in 1 John
[31:33] 3 20 to 21 remember there is no fear in
[31:36] love and perfect love cast out fear IT'S
[31:39] TO CAST OUT THIS FEAR OF GOD so
[31:42] recognize Is it that we could be under
[31:43] this slavish fear and this self- BONDAGE
[31:45] AND THIS SELF-PUNISHING A AND this
[31:47] tormenting fear that I deserve
[31:49] punishment. I I deserve to be rejected
[31:53] a as a way of being conditioned through
[31:55] all the narcissistic relationships we're
[31:57] SUBJECTED TO THROUGHOUT OUR LIFETIMES.
[31:59] WE COULD ALMOST TAKE ON THE MENTALITY
[32:00] THAT WELL I HAD IT coming
[32:03] and so I have it coming. 1 John chapter
[32:05] 3 20- 21 says, "For if OUR HEART
[32:08] CONDEMNTH, GOD IS GREATER THAN OUR HEART
[32:12] and knoweth all things."
[32:13] So he's wanting to loose burdened hearts
[32:16] WHERE IT'S THE SELF- CONDEMNING HEART.
[32:18] IT'S THE HEART THAT HAS A HARD TIME
[32:19] MAYBE LOVING GOD. IT'S THE HEART THAT
[32:21] HAS A HARD TIME ACCEPTING GOD'S LOVE FOR
[32:22] US. HE'S SAYING, LISTEN, IF YOUR HEART'S
[32:24] CONDEMNING YOU, IT'S NOT GOD THAT'S
[32:26] CONDEMNING YOU. THAT'S YOUR HEART
[32:28] CONDEMNING YOU. THAT'S FEAR WHICH HAVE
[32:30] TORMENT CONDEMNING YOU. AND GOD KNOWS
[32:32] ALL THINGS. AND HE PREFACES GOD'S LOVE
[32:35] FOR YOU AND HIS A AND HIS GREATNESS IN
[32:38] THAT IT'S NOT THAT YOU KNOW SOMETHING
[32:41] GOD doesn't
[32:43] like man if he only knew the thoughts I
[32:46] had
[32:48] I know you love me but if you only knew
[32:49] what I did last week right AND WE THINK
[32:52] THAT SOMEHOW UH WE'VE HID SOMETHING FROM
[32:55] GOD THAT HE'S not aware of and AS SOON
[32:56] AS HE FINDS OUT UH WHAT KIND OF
[32:58] SKELETONS WE HAVE IN OUR CLOSET BOY HE'S
[33:00] DONE AND HE'S OUT BUT HE SAYS BELOVED IF
[33:02] OUR HEART CONDEMNEST NOT THEN WE HAVE
[33:06] CONFIDENCE TOWARDS God
[33:08] condemn it means to find fault with
[33:11] TO BLAME OUR HEARTS ARE ACCUSING
[33:13] ourselves
[33:14] and IT'S LIKE THIS SELF-PUNISHING FEAR
[33:16] FROM EXPECTING HARSHNESS EXPECTING
[33:19] REJECTION
[33:21] AND EXPECTING TO UH TO BE SHAMED FOR
[33:24] DISAPPOINTING God
[33:27] if a heart condemnth God's greater than
[33:28] a heart and he states the obvious and
[33:31] think if your heart's not condemning
[33:33] about God and you're not worried that
[33:36] he's going to reject you. He's going to
[33:37] shame you. He's going to be harsh. He's
[33:38] going to be brutal and he's disappointed
[33:40] in you and we're disappointing God.
[33:43] Says, if you could if your heart can be
[33:44] unburdened from that, then you can have
[33:47] confidence towards God.
[33:48] Amen.
[33:49] Because you're not letting your
[33:51] incorrect perception of his love
[33:55] keep you from trusting him.
[33:59] And if I could say this, God knows
[34:04] that love and having that unbburdened
[34:07] free love and have this confidence, this
[34:09] trust towards God, he knows that this
[34:11] kind of love makes us feel vulnerable.
[34:14] So he's speaking directly to it.
[34:18] He is telling us that if our hearts do
[34:20] not condemn us, then we have confidence.
[34:22] Confidence that we will be heard because
[34:24] he speaks about then your make your
[34:25] request known. And we have confidence
[34:26] that he'll hear you. We have confidence
[34:28] to ask. WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT WE'LL BE
[34:29] HEARD IN NOT SHAMED OR JUDGED or or
[34:32] rejected in and and we when coming to
[34:34] HIM IN BEING OURSELVES WITH HIM.
[34:37] And a condemned heart is just simply one
[34:39] that doesn't feel secure.
[34:42] The heart that says, "Well, I deserve
[34:43] punishment or I don't deserve this love.
[34:46] Well, this is what I have coming to me.
[34:48] I I guess this is what I I'll suffer
[34:50] with." And and I I'm always remissed to
[34:53] share maybe my personal testimony.
[34:59] But it took me a long time as a son of
[35:02] God
[35:03] to to fully recognize that in my
[35:07] relationship with God, I always had this
[35:10] fear that I would be abused and uh
[35:14] rejected
[35:15] by him in the same way that I was by
[35:17] others that I loved or loved me.
[35:19] Right? I might have never consciously
[35:21] said it,
[35:23] but yet there was this instinct of
[35:24] you're going to get what you deserve or
[35:26] you don't deserve this. And it's this
[35:27] shadow that can haunt you.
[35:30] And God had to bring me to a place to
[35:32] realize that if he loved me,
[35:35] if he's ever loved me, HE WILL ALWAYS
[35:38] love me.
[35:39] AND THAT GOD IS NOT A NARCISSIST.
[35:42] AND THAT GOD IS NOT PLAYING WITH MY
[35:43] EMOTIONS. AND GOD ISN'T TOYING WITH ME
[35:46] IN ORDER TO manipulate me. BUT THERE'S
[35:48] NO GUILE. THERE'S SUCH A PURITY AND HE'S
[35:50] SAYING, "LOOK, I I MAY HAVE SHOWED MY
[35:53] HAND PRETTY EARLY ON, AARON, but I love
[35:55] you and I'm committed
[35:57] and I mean, I've given YOU THE WEDDING
[35:59] BAND OF PREDESTINATION AND I'M I'M
[36:01] COMMITTED TO YOU AND I'M NEVER GOING TO
[36:03] GET UP GIVE UP ON YOU." AND SO, I MEAN,
[36:05] MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE KIND OF SHOULDN'T
[36:07] HAVE TOLD THAT TO YOU. SO, MAYBE YOU
[36:08] WOULD HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED BY FEAR TO
[36:10] SERVE ME ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE. BUT
[36:12] I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW IN THE HOPES OF
[36:14] MAYBE MOTIVATING YOU THAT HEY, GET UP.
[36:18] TRY.
[36:19] SAY YOU'RE SORRY. DON'T STOP FIGHTING
[36:22] BECAUSE I'M WITH YOU AND I'LL NEVER GIVE
[36:25] up on you. YOU MAY QUIT ON ME, BUT I'LL
[36:27] NEVER QUIT ON YOU. YOU MAY STOP AND WALK
[36:29] AWAY, BUT GUESS WHAT? I'M RIGHT BEHIND
[36:31] YOU AS A SHADOW BECAUSE I'LL NEVER LEAVE
[36:33] YOU OR FORSAKE YOU. EVEN TO THE POINT
[36:36] WHERE DAVID SAID, "IF I MAKE MY BED IN
[36:38] HELL, THERE YOU ARE SAYING."
[36:40] AMEN. I got you.
[36:43] I'm with you.
[36:48] We know
[36:51] that there's no greater pain in life
[36:52] than that of unrequited love.
[36:56] We know that probably nothing leaves a
[36:58] greater stain or scar or wound than an
[37:02] unconditional love that is unrecrocated.
[37:06] probably no greater betrayal than a
[37:08] trust that is not mutual.
[37:13] And when we love
[37:15] unconditionally in in the horizontal
[37:19] and we're rejected or rebuffed or it's
[37:21] not returned, it wounds the human
[37:23] spirit.
[37:25] God knows this.
[37:27] Amen.
[37:27] And he knows we've had these experiences
[37:29] in love. And so he reminds us over and
[37:32] over again that this is not so with
[37:34] mine.
[37:35] Romans 8:35-39, "Who shall separate us
[37:38] from the love of Christ?" I want you to
[37:39] think about these words from the
[37:40] standpoint of one who's wanting you to
[37:42] be emotionally secure, emotionally safe,
[37:45] wanting you to be in a good place
[37:46] mentally and emotionally. He's wanting
[37:48] to address complexes and fears. Let's
[37:50] look at this not so much of the truth of
[37:51] it, but why God said it, why he would
[37:54] address us this way. Who shall separate
[37:56] us from the love of Christ? shall
[37:58] tribulation or distress or persecution
[38:00] or famine or nakedness or peril or
[38:01] sword. As it is written, for thy sake we
[38:03] are killed all the day long. We are
[38:05] counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay,
[38:06] in all these things we are more than
[38:08] conquerors through him that loved us.
[38:10] For I am persuaded that neither death
[38:12] nor life, nor angels, nor
[38:13] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[38:14] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[38:16] nor depth, nor any other creature shall
[38:18] be able to separate us from the love of
[38:20] God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[38:24] He's using the language of one who is
[38:25] wounded by love.
[38:28] He's using the language of one that
[38:30] knows rejection.
[38:31] He's using a language of one who
[38:33] understands that we can have complexes
[38:35] when it comes to commitment. That we can
[38:37] be a little bit suspicious like, "Yeah,
[38:39] I know you promised. Pinky promised,
[38:40] crossed your heart, swore, whatever it
[38:42] was, you know, blood brothers, whatever
[38:44] it might be. We've we've swore ON THIS
[38:46] COVENANT. YEAH, I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE. I
[38:49] I've heard till death do we part. I I've
[38:51] seen THE PROMISES. I'VE I'VE HEARD THE
[38:52] VOWS. I I'VE BEEN THERE, DONE THAT. I I
[38:55] KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE FOR THOSE THINGS
[38:56] TO BE SAID. AND SO THERE'S THIS
[38:58] AFFIRMATION OF GOD'S LOVE WHERE HE'S
[39:01] SAYING, LISTEN, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE
[39:03] SEPARATED FROM THE LOVE OF GOD. It is
[39:05] IMPOSSIBLE TO BE DIVORCED FROM THE LOVE
[39:07] OF GOD. AND HE'S USING A LANGUAGE THAT
[39:09] MIGHT BE IN A LANGUAGE THAT SEEMS TO
[39:11] SPEAK OF MORE OF MEDIEVAL TIMES OR
[39:13] SOMETHING, BUT IT'S A LANGUAGE OF ONE
[39:14] THAT'S BEEN WOUNDED BY LOVE. IT'S THE
[39:16] LANGUAGE OF ONE WHO'S BEEN DISAPPOINTED
[39:18] IN COMMITMENT. IT'S A LANGUAGE OF ONE
[39:20] WHO KNOWS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT LIKE TO
[39:22] BE REJECTED.
[39:26] And these are things in the vertical.
[39:30] But in 1 John 3:1
[39:37] for this is the message that you have
[39:38] heard from the beginning that we should
[39:40] love one another.
[39:43] To love God adequately is difficult
[39:45] enough. I would say complex and we make
[39:48] it complicated.
[39:50] So to love God in itself, that's a
[39:52] that's a tall task for a human. But to
[39:55] love one another with the perfect love
[39:57] seems unreasonable.
[39:59] And yet that's what John's concluding.
[40:02] We've known and believed the love that
[40:03] God hath to us. And fe there is no fear
[40:06] in love. And perfect love cast out fear.
[40:07] And there's this there's this washing
[40:09] and conditioning and qualification and
[40:11] centering of the horizont the vertical
[40:13] relationship of God's to us and us TO
[40:15] GOD. BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT. SAYS, "THIS
[40:18] IS THE COMMANDMENT you've heard from the
[40:19] beginning, that we should love one
[40:22] another."
[40:24] Faith and love to God have the power,
[40:28] just kind of maybe backing up to to set
[40:30] this love to one another. Faith and love
[40:32] have the power to release us from the
[40:34] prison of fear and doubt
[40:36] of loving him.
[40:37] So faith and love are washing us,
[40:40] freeing us, delivering us from fear and
[40:42] doubt of loving him and his love for us.
[40:43] Amen.
[40:44] And if I CAN SAY THERE'S NO RISK IN
[40:46] LOVING GOD.
[40:48] AMEN.
[40:48] So I was looking at the words of safety
[40:50] and security. There there's there's no
[40:52] risk in loving God. HIS LOVE IS A SAFE
[40:55] LOVE.
[40:57] It is a love that is true. It is a love
[41:00] that will not disappoint you. It is a
[41:01] love THAT WILL NOT BETRAY YOU. It is a
[41:03] love THAT WILL NOT REJECT YOU. IT IS A
[41:04] LOVE THAT WILL NOT SHAME YOU.
[41:07] God's love is corrective, but it is not
[41:09] shaming. Amen.
[41:10] God's love MAY REBUKE US, BUT IT'S NOT
[41:12] EMBARRASSING US.
[41:15] But our hearts can be hardened by the
[41:17] wounds of love.
[41:19] And we can be fearful of trusting. We
[41:21] can be reluctant to risk trust.
[41:25] And so to command us to love one another
[41:28] is not a riskless act.
[41:31] And God knows this. He's constantly
[41:34] affirming our love, his love for us so
[41:36] that we would be safe in loving him. and
[41:38] that there's no risk in his love. BUT
[41:40] NOW TO ASK US TO LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE, WE
[41:42] RECOGNIZE THAT MAKES US FEEL VULNERABLE.
[41:46] TRUE.
[41:46] Can I get a witness?
[41:48] To love God. MAYBE WE COULD BE LIKE,
[41:50] "ALL RIGHT, YEAH. ALL RIGHT. I can love
[41:52] God. I I can do this." And his love, the
[41:54] Bible says it's unconditional. And the
[41:55] message tells me I'm justified. AND WE
[41:57] COULD KIND OF GET KIND OF AMPED UP TO
[41:59] ACCEPT HIS LOVE. AND I THINK I'M GETTING
[42:00] THERE. I can receive his love. I think
[42:02] I'm going to get there. I think I'm get
[42:03] there. And it's like, and you've got to
[42:04] love him. And you're like
[42:08] h yes Jesus loves me right this this
[42:14] part
[42:15] makes us vulnerable
[42:18] but this is why
[42:21] loving one another is predicated on
[42:23] loving God
[42:25] us loving him and him loving us
[42:28] that HE IS NOT ASKING US TO LOVE ONE
[42:30] another unless we have first known and
[42:32] believed the love that God has to us
[42:34] That's good.
[42:35] And that we KNOW HIS LOVE FOR US AND
[42:37] THAT WE ALSO LOVE GOD. And that loving
[42:38] one another is an extension of love we
[42:40] have to God. Otherwise, love isn't love.
[42:45] Amen.
[42:49] I I I I'm going to read a scripture to
[42:50] you very quickly. I don't even know if
[42:52] I'll explain it. I'm not going to say
[42:53] anything more than read it, but I'm
[42:55] going to throw this out there lest
[42:56] anyone twist what love is
[43:00] into something that it's not. Because
[43:02] Jesus said, "If any man come to me and
[43:04] hate not his father and mother and his
[43:05] wife and children and brethren and
[43:07] sister and yay and his own life also, he
[43:08] cannot be my disciple."
[43:18] We cannot avoid the duty to love one
[43:22] another.
[43:25] And I this I'm saving this for the
[43:28] sermon on love hate,
[43:30] but
[43:32] There's many who might find it easy to
[43:34] hate their dad.
[43:36] It might find it easy to hate their mom
[43:38] but very difficult to love. And therein
[43:41] lies a problem
[43:44] because we cannot avoid the duty to love
[43:45] one another
[43:48] because we must love as Christ loved us.
[43:52] John 13:34
[43:54] as it is written in first John how this
[43:56] is the commandment you've heard from the
[43:57] beginning and even the new commandment
[43:59] that John is referring to. He says, "A
[44:00] new commandment I give unto you." Jesus
[44:01] says, "That you love one another as I
[44:04] have loved you, that you also love one
[44:07] another. As he loved, we are to love."
[44:12] So, IT'S NOT SO MUCH JUST SAYING LOVE
[44:14] one another. And so, we could have OUR
[44:16] VISION OF LOVE AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
[44:18] AND what brotherly kindness is. And
[44:19] there's kind of this love that we have,
[44:21] but yet there's A LOVE THAT WE OUGHT TO
[44:22] HAVE ONE FOR ANOTHER. And I would say
[44:24] that it is an act of love and it is a
[44:26] submissive love because it is a LOVE
[44:29] THAT WAS BOUND BY GOD'S WILL FOR HIM AND
[44:31] FOR THE PERSON AND EVEN GOD'S DESIRE AND
[44:34] PERFECT will for the others. So it's not
[44:35] something that's UNRESTRAINED AND
[44:37] SLOPPY. WE REALIZE that love has limits
[44:39] just based upon what the scripture
[44:41] teaches us. But this is a love. The love
[44:43] that he has for us is a love that we
[44:44] ought to have for others.
[44:46] Couple chapters later inif chapter 15 12
[44:49] and 13. This is my commandment that you
[44:51] love one another as I have loved you. So
[44:54] he's giving some sort of qualification
[44:57] to what this love ought to look at like.
[44:59] AND HE SAYS, "GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN
[45:02] than this that a man lay down his life
[45:04] for his friends."
[45:05] Amen.
[45:06] Remember how that perfect love to a to a
[45:09] Jew carried with it the idea and the
[45:11] love of God. And this kind of love
[45:13] carries it with the idea of loving when
[45:14] it's hard to do so.
[45:17] It means loving when you're at the risk
[45:19] of rejection. Loving when you're at the
[45:20] risk of hurt and pain. And that's why
[45:23] Jesus tells us that we're to love our
[45:24] enemies, to do good to them that
[45:27] despitefully use us. And Paul says,
[45:29] "What good is it if you do good to
[45:30] them?" Jesus teaching, "What good is it
[45:32] if you do good to those THAT LOVE YOU?
[45:34] WHERE'S YOUR REWARD FOR THAT? WHAT WHAT
[45:36] IS IT LOVE?" RIGHT? WHAT'S WHAT'S LOVE
[45:39] IF YOU SAY, "WELL, I REALLY LOVE THIS
[45:42] GUY, AND MAN, ISN'T THIS GUY AWESOME,
[45:44] AND ISN'T HE GREAT? MR. BILLIONAIRE WHO
[45:46] LIKES TO GIVE ME STUFF,
[45:49] RIGHT? And everybody's kind of like, I
[45:51] don't
[45:53] I don't know if he really loves him. I
[45:54] mean, the guy's kind of ugly, right? I
[45:57] mean, and we're like, it must be love or
[45:59] money. I had a friend one tell me one
[46:01] time that his wife married him that she
[46:04] wanted a man that was funny,
[46:07] good-looking, and rich. AND HE SAID,
[46:10] "ONE OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD." And I
[46:11] said, "I didn't know you had a sense of
[46:12] humor. [laughter]
[46:20] But perfect love when he asks us to love
[46:23] one another,
[46:25] it's not just with this, it's not a
[46:27] fantasy.
[46:29] Love is ugly and chaotic.
[46:34] And it would be easy to instinctively
[46:36] recoil from love for our own protection
[46:40] because love in in the in asking us to
[46:44] love one another.
[46:46] John knows IT'S A NEW COMMANDMENT. JOHN
[46:48] KNOWS THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. IT
[46:50] WAS EVEN KIND OF THE CRUX a with the
[46:53] argument with Jesus AND THE LAWYER TO
[46:55] WHERE IT'S LIKE, WELL, WHAT'S THE GREAT
[46:56] COMMANDMENT? WHAT ARE THESE GREAT and
[46:57] all the law and the prophets? Hang on.
[46:59] Uh, love thy Lord thy God with all thy
[47:01] soul, heart, and mind. LOVE THE LORD THY
[47:02] GOD, AND THY NEIGHBOR, love thy neighbor
[47:05] as thyself. There's the key that you
[47:08] can't love your neighbor properly if you
[47:09] love yourself improperly.
[47:12] And so THERE THERE IS THERE'S something
[47:13] there even in as you love yourself, BUT
[47:16] EVEN IN THIS LOVE. AND SO WHAT WAS THE
[47:17] LAWYER'S RETURN? WELL, who's my
[47:19] neighbor, right? You you'll force me to
[47:22] love somebody I don't want to love and
[47:23] and I want to pick and choose who my
[47:25] neighbors are. AND SO THERE'S SOME
[47:27] THERE'S SOME SENSE that it's a
[47:29] recognition that to love somebody else
[47:30] is a is is a UGLY OR IS A HARD thing
[47:35] in Colossians chapter 3 19. I I I'm just
[47:39] introducing this into the record as
[47:41] we'll be able to call back to it later.
[47:43] BUT PAUL SAYS, "HUSBANDS, LOVE YOUR
[47:45] wives and be not bitter against them."
[47:48] That means angry or irritated. Don't be
[47:51] harsh.
[47:53] AND SO PAUL, IT MIGHT SEEM ODD,
[47:58] let let me just play um devil's advocate
[48:01] or let me just kind of take the other
[48:02] side to say that if HE HAS TO TELL you
[48:06] to love her, then you don't love her,
[48:08] right? I mean, haven't you been told
[48:10] that before? Like, if I have to tell you
[48:12] how to treat me good, then you just
[48:14] don't love me. And if I have to tell you
[48:15] what to do, and you should just know how
[48:16] to do it. And you know how people talk
[48:18] to one another, right? That's how Elliot
[48:20] and I go at it.
[48:22] Well, if you RESPECTED ME, I WOULDN'T
[48:23] HAVE TO ASK. HE'S LIKE, WELL, IF YOU
[48:24] LOVE ME, you wouldn't. No,
[48:28] there there's just a WAY THAT WE TALK TO
[48:29] ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE WE LIKE TO WE KIND
[48:31] OF LIKE TO SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, I
[48:32] SHOULDN'T HAVE TO tell you, right? AND,
[48:35] YOU KNOW, IN SOME WAYS, IT'S KIND OF
[48:36] like
[48:39] actually you do, right? Help me out
[48:41] here. I love you. I want to make you
[48:44] happy. How can I do that?
[48:46] And it's not like, no, if you if you
[48:48] love me, you'd know exactly you'd know
[48:50] exactly what I want. You know what
[48:50] they're going? Oh, God help me.
[48:56] AND SO PAUL IS PAUL IS SAYING IT JUST
[48:58] FROM THE PLACE OF HONESTY. Husbands love
[49:01] your wives. And husbands like
[49:03] yes that's right. I SHOULD LOVE MY WIFE.
[49:07] BUT PROBABLY THE MOST TELLING PART IS HE
[49:09] SAYS AND BE NOT BITTER AGAINST THEM.
[49:12] PAUL is acknowledging THE TEMPERAMENTAL
[49:14] NATURE OF HUMAN EMOTIONS.
[49:16] THAT WITH THE SAME HEART THAT WE LOVE IS
[49:18] THE SAME HEART THAT GETS JEALOUS. AND
[49:20] WITH THE SAME SPIRIT WITH WHICH WE LOVE
[49:21] IS THE SAME ONE THAT GETS FRUSTRATED.
[49:23] IT'S THE SAME ONE THAT CAN GET BITTER
[49:24] AND HARSH AND IRRITATED. SO PAUL IS
[49:26] ACKNOWLEDGING THE TEMPERAMENTAL NATURE
[49:28] OF EMOTIONS. AND IF I COULD SAY THIS, HE
[49:29] SAYS, "LOVE YOUR WIVES AND BE NOT
[49:30] BITTER." HE'S SAYING, "HEY, I KNOW IT'S
[49:32] not easy.
[49:34] Not just to love your wife, but to love
[49:35] your spouse.
[49:37] If I could say this, maybe there's a
[49:39] reason to be bitter."
[49:42] But here he offers no way out or excuse.
[49:46] HE HE IS ALMOST ASSUMING HUSBANDS LOVE
[49:48] YOUR WIVES AND MAYBE YOU HAVE CAUSE TO
[49:50] BE BITTER, BUT DON'T BE.
[49:52] I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXCUSE TO
[49:54] BE BITTER. I'M NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO
[49:56] JUSTIFY YOUR BITTERNESS. I AM NOT GIVING
[49:58] YOU ANY ROOM TO SAY, "WELL, THEY DID
[50:00] THIS OR THEY DID THAT." HE SAYS, "LOVE
[50:02] DOESN'T MAKE ROOM FOR BITTERNESS TO TAKE
[50:04] ROOT."
[50:07] He's saying you got to love when it's
[50:08] when it is easy.
[50:11] You got to love when it's not hard.
[50:13] LOVE DESPITE THE HURT. LOVE DESPITE THE
[50:16] PAIN. HUSBANDS LOVE WHEN IT'S NOT EASY.
[50:19] If I could say this, as I hope to come
[50:20] to it as we continue in this, he's
[50:22] saying because it's worth it.
[50:26] And and if I could say, isn't that why
[50:27] we even have it?
[50:30] Isn't that what the love is there for?
[50:33] That the love isn't there necessarily
[50:34] when things are going good. I I mean,
[50:37] the love isn't there when what's being
[50:38] cooked is awesome because you would eat
[50:40] anything from anybody who cooks
[50:42] something awesome,
[50:44] right? The love is there FOR THE TIMES
[50:46] WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WHEN THINGS ARE
[50:47] ROUGH.
[50:49] LOVE IS THERE FOR THE TIMES WHEN TRUST
[50:50] IS BEING CHALLENGED. LOVE IS THERE FOR
[50:52] TIMES WHEN YEAH, MAYBE I AM A LITTLE BIT
[50:54] UPSET AND MAYBE THINGS HAVEN'T WORKED
[50:55] OUT THE WAY THAT I WANT THEM TO IN THIS
[50:57] MOMENT. BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHEN LOVE
[50:59] THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS FOR.
[51:01] AMEN.
[51:02] So he says, "Husbands, love your wives
[51:04] and be not bitter against them." And
[51:06] then in Ephesians 5:25 and 26, husband,
[51:08] love your wives. And then here's the
[51:11] great qualification. Even as Christ also
[51:13] loved the church and gave himself for
[51:15] it.
[51:20] This is where you can see that love is
[51:21] messy.
[51:23] And I don't want you just to think that
[51:24] this is speaking to the husbands. I'd
[51:26] say this to all of us. Spouses must
[51:28] embrace the hard side of love.
[51:31] The vulnerability of it, the risk in
[51:34] loving, the risk and the commitment.
[51:36] Because it says, "Husbands, love your
[51:38] wives even as Christ also loved the
[51:40] church." church and then it just doesn't
[51:41] kind of let it float out there in the
[51:43] ether for us to interpret it. He says
[51:44] and gave himself for it that he might
[51:46] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[51:48] of the water by the word. Paul is
[51:50] acknowledging again that love is hard
[51:52] that loving is difficult that it comes
[51:55] with pain. It comes with commitment. It
[51:57] can come with loss. Just as Christ
[51:59] suffered loss for his for love's sake,
[52:02] he is saying that we also must risk the
[52:04] loss
[52:06] because it's giving, it's sanctifying,
[52:08] it's cleansing, it's in other words,
[52:09] this is it's something that you work at
[52:12] that if it's if it's easy and and I
[52:15] recognize this that in in any
[52:18] relationship
[52:20] that I I think we've said this before
[52:22] that a a spouse should never say to the
[52:24] other one, uh, well, if you had my job,
[52:28] Right? Because trust me, you don't want
[52:30] hers.
[52:32] And so whenever if you say, "Well, I
[52:34] have to go to work every day. Go. I have
[52:36] to go to work every day." And it's like
[52:39] famous last words, right?
[52:42] That it's at that point maybe you've
[52:44] started the blame game and it just gets
[52:46] ugly from there. There's something to
[52:48] realize that in in this in this this
[52:50] working in this labor and the suffering
[52:53] that we might say, well, well, the
[52:55] husband has to love his wife as Christ
[52:58] loves the church. And so the husband
[53:00] always has to be Christ, right? And so
[53:03] then we can always say, you need to be
[53:05] Christ. And we can always say, well, you
[53:06] need to be the church,
[53:08] right? And so it almost just kind of
[53:11] creates this re we're repulsing one
[53:14] another.
[53:16] So if it if I could say this at all to
[53:18] understand and recognize the duty maybe
[53:21] some of the washing and cleansing are
[53:23] the very things that we've caused
[53:26] that realize that we have to be
[53:27] dedicated to cleansing and to washing
[53:29] and make a commitment to but Paul is
[53:31] acknowledging that even in love it's
[53:33] work
[53:35] and that we got to embrace the hard side
[53:36] of love even as Christ suffered for his
[53:39] own love's sake. Bible says in Isaiah
[53:42] 53:3, he is despised and rejected of
[53:45] men.
[53:47] Is despised and rejected of men. A man
[53:50] of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[53:53] And we hid as it were our faces from
[53:55] him. He was despised and we esteemed him
[53:58] not. These are not the actions of one
[53:59] who trusts. We hid our face. This is
[54:02] fear. This is doubt. This is the
[54:03] distrust. This is the distancing. This
[54:05] is not the affection AND THE DRAWING TO.
[54:07] This is the turning away from. This is
[54:09] the fear. This is the doubt. THIS IS THE
[54:10] REPULSION. HE IS DESPISED AND REJECTED A
[54:13] MAN. HE IS A MAN OF SORROWS AND
[54:14] ACQUAINTED WITH GRIEF. BUT DESPITE ALL
[54:17] THESE OTHER EMOTIONS THAT HE HAD AND
[54:18] BROTHER SAID EVEN THE OF ALL THE HUMAN
[54:20] EMOTIONS THAT HE DISPLAYED THE MOST, HE
[54:22] DISPLAYED THE WEEPING.
[54:24] Thank you Jesus.
[54:24] A man of sorrow acquainted with grief.
[54:26] IF ANYTHING THAT OUGHT TO DESTIGMATIZE
[54:28] SORROW AND GRIEF.
[54:31] But though he was characterized AS A MAN
[54:33] OF SORROW, BEING DESPISED AND REJECTED,
[54:36] the Bible says, "The Father loveth the
[54:38] Son and giveth all things into his
[54:40] hands."
[54:42] There's a love, there's the trust.
[54:45] And I want to point out THAT THOUGH GOD
[54:47] LOVED HIM AND COMMITTED all things to
[54:49] him, God's love did not protect him from
[54:51] heartache.
[54:54] It's
[54:54] maybe the paradox that the love of God
[54:56] required a sacrifice of his own life.
[54:59] And in God's love to him and his
[55:01] reciprocal love to God, he willingly
[55:02] laid his life down, but he trusted that
[55:04] God would raise it up.
[55:06] Amen.
[55:08] GOD'S LOVE DID NOT PROTECT HIM FROM
[55:09] HEARTBREAK. GOD'S LOVE DID not protect
[55:11] him from the pain of loving. Nor did the
[55:14] rejection release him from love.
[55:18] THAT THOUGH HE WAS DESPISED AND
[55:19] REJECTED.
[55:21] Though he was CAME TO HIS OWN, HIS OWN
[55:23] RECEIVED HIM NOT, JESUS did not COULD
[55:26] NOT REFUSE THE ACT OF LOVE. JESUS COULD
[55:29] NOT SAY, "WELL, I CAME AND AND THEY HAD
[55:31] A VOTE AND GREATER THAN 51% VOTED
[55:34] against me and and and THEY DON'T WANT
[55:35] ME ANYMORE IN THEIR ASSEMBLIES AND
[55:38] THEY'VE KICKED ME OUT OF THEIR
[55:38] SYNAGOGUES AND THEY THEY'VE TURNED THEIR
[55:40] BACKS AGAINST ME." The rejection did not
[55:43] release them from the love's obligation.
[55:46] help us
[55:48] even to where when he came to his
[55:50] crucifixion in John 13:1
[55:52] said having loved his own which were in
[55:54] the world he loved them unto the end.
[55:58] Jesus having derived his confidence from
[56:00] God's love for him was confident and
[56:03] loving
[56:05] and even despite the agony and pain of
[56:07] the cross where even there on the cross
[56:10] he cried my God my God why hast thou
[56:12] forsaken me. Do you realize we cannot
[56:15] use the excuse of rejection and loss and
[56:17] pain in the wounds of love to avoid
[56:19] loving? Because even in this act he
[56:21] recognized that there would be a
[56:22] forsaking from God.
[56:25] But he trusted in a God who raises the
[56:26] dead.
[56:29] He was so confident in the love of God
[56:30] that no matter what he faced, what he
[56:32] went through, what he endured, love was
[56:34] worth the risk of the pain.
[56:36] It was worth the risk of loss.
[56:40] in Proverbs chapter 31:1.
[56:46] I'm I'm coming to my closing
[56:49] uh
[56:51] my closing uh focus here. In Proverbs
[56:55] 31:1, it's speaking of a virtuous woman
[56:58] and it uses a phrase I believe that is
[57:01] very remarkable. The heart of her
[57:02] husband doth safely trust in her so that
[57:07] he shall have no need of spoil
[57:10] in the flow of the chapter.
[57:13] Her resourcefulness
[57:17] and her ingenuity and her faithfulness
[57:21] puts the husband in a place where he
[57:23] does not need to res resort to thievery
[57:26] or or uh fraud or deceit or easy gain.
[57:29] that he's not being overworked and he's
[57:32] not worrisome. He knows that with what
[57:34] provision he has and and her
[57:36] faithfulness and how she can use it. He
[57:38] just he trusts her with what is what it
[57:40] has and what she can do. And it says the
[57:43] phrase is safely trust in her.
[57:48] It adds this other element of that
[57:50] whenever there is trust in another
[57:52] person, does not the Bible caution us
[57:54] that we put confidence in no man?
[57:57] But yet the challenge is if you can get
[57:59] the people if you can get the people to
[58:01] believe and have confidence in you and
[58:03] how important confidence is in the
[58:04] horizontal relationships. He says the
[58:06] husband's heart safely trusts.
[58:10] And why does it say safely trust?
[58:12] Because anytime there's confidence
[58:13] there's the risk of broken trust.
[58:16] Anytime you trust somebody, and I hope
[58:18] I'm not pulling the curtain back on
[58:19] trust, but anytime you trust somebody,
[58:21] you make yourself vulnerable to being
[58:23] deceived.
[58:26] Right?
[58:27] That's how some of the best that's
[58:29] that's at the heart of what people call
[58:30] the best pranks. At the end of the day,
[58:34] all the person simply did is trust you.
[58:38] Haha. Right?
[58:41] I just all I just believed you. You told
[58:43] me and I just took you at your word. And
[58:45] so it's that act of trust. If you trust
[58:47] somebody, it makes there's a risk of
[58:50] being deceived.
[58:52] And when the Bible SAYS IN HIS HEART
[58:54] DOTH SAFELY TRUST IN HER, IT USES THIS
[58:56] PHRASE TO SHOW THAT LOVE IS NOT WITHOUT
[58:58] RISK.
[59:00] THAT LOVE IS NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.
[59:03] THAT WHEN THERE IS TRUST PLACED IN
[59:05] SOMEBODY THAT THEY'RE PUT IN THE POWER
[59:07] OF YOUR TRUST. THEY'RE PUT IN THE POWER
[59:09] THERE THERE'S SOME VULNERABILITY that
[59:11] you're exposing yourself to. And I would
[59:14] say that there WHAT WE'VE COME TO
[59:16] ANYMORE is that people want things
[59:19] related to love without the risk of
[59:22] love.
[59:24] They want to experience love without the
[59:25] consequence. THEY WANT TO HAVE IT
[59:27] WITHOUT THE RISK.
[59:29] And I would even go so FAR AS TO SAY
[59:31] THAT many of us through innocence and
[59:32] through the things we've endured
[59:33] experience may tell us that it's better
[59:35] not to trust so that we're not deceived.
[59:38] And we might say, WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S
[59:40] JUST BETTER NOT TO TRUST LESS WE BE
[59:42] DECEIVED. I WOULD EVEN ASK THE QUESTION,
[59:44] WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER THAT TO OFF BE
[59:46] deceived and to know real trust
[59:50] than to never know trust at all?
[59:53] And so our experiences may tell us that,
[59:55] you know, I there's no such thing as
[59:57] safe trust,
[59:59] but in that there's a danger of
[1:00:00] constructing a means of protection
[1:00:02] against God's commandment to love.
[1:00:05] THAT I'M I'M I'M FINE WITH WORKING ON
[1:00:07] THE VERTICAL. I'M FINE WITH YOUR LOVE
[1:00:10] FOR ME AND MY LOVE FOR YOU. AND AND I
[1:00:12] WOULD LOVE TO GET VERY CULTISH ABOUT
[1:00:13] THIS where uh we could just HAVE THIS
[1:00:15] PERSONAL LOVE AFFAIR AND BE ABLE TO LOOK
[1:00:17] DOWN UPON EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOESN'T
[1:00:18] HAVE A CLUE ABOUT this and they're not
[1:00:20] ordained to it and they're NOT ELECT AND
[1:00:22] AND THEY'RE ENEMIES OF THE CROSS AND
[1:00:24] THEY HATE THE WORD AND THEY'VE REJECTED
[1:00:25] THE MESSAGE. AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE
[1:00:27] JUST TO ENJOY THIS. BUT it's in this
[1:00:30] PART THAT WE REALIZE SOMETIME OR WHAT WE
[1:00:32] DO SOMETIMES IS WE CONSTRUCT THE MEANS
[1:00:34] OF protecting ourselves against God's
[1:00:37] commandment that we love.
[1:00:40] In Proverbs 25 19 says, "Confidence in
[1:00:44] an unfaithful man in time of trouble is
[1:00:46] like a broken tooth and a foot out of
[1:00:48] joint.
[1:00:57] If we let's just say the Bible's saying
[1:00:59] the pain of betrayal is real
[1:01:02] that when you count on somebody and you
[1:01:04] trust in somebody and they let you down,
[1:01:07] it hurts.
[1:01:09] Confidence in an unfaithful man, it's
[1:01:11] not to say that you knew he was
[1:01:13] unfaithful beforehand. It's just
[1:01:15] confidence in one and maybe I safely
[1:01:17] trusting and all of a sudden things turn
[1:01:19] around and and this is when I need you
[1:01:21] and this is when things are important.
[1:01:23] It's like a broken tooth and a foot out
[1:01:25] of joint. NOTICE THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH
[1:01:27] SAYING THAT UNFAITHFULNESS uh um IS THE
[1:01:30] PROBLEM, BUT IT'S AT THE TIME YOU NEED
[1:01:32] IT THE MOST. When there's
[1:01:33] unfaithfulness, it's a broken tooth.
[1:01:36] It's a foot out of joint. That when you
[1:01:37] you need it to perform a function, when
[1:01:39] you need it in the moment that it counts
[1:01:41] and the betrayal is there, the pain is
[1:01:43] real.
[1:01:45] And when it once it fails, you'll be
[1:01:47] reluctant to use it again.
[1:01:50] Just as it is with those who've
[1:01:51] experienced chronic pain, they find that
[1:01:53] they favor. If it's a broken tooth, you
[1:01:56] you're not going to rely on that side of
[1:01:57] your mouth, you're going to chew on the
[1:01:58] other side. If it's a foot out of joint,
[1:02:00] you're going to favor the other one
[1:02:01] because you've experienced the sharp
[1:02:02] pains. And maybe you've done it more
[1:02:04] than once. I'm not going to make that
[1:02:06] mistake again. It kind of builds to this
[1:02:08] place to where one is reluctant to rely
[1:02:11] in trust because the memory of the pain.
[1:02:14] If I could say this, I'm hoping to be
[1:02:16] winding this down to a close.
[1:02:20] And again, this kind of points to the
[1:02:22] the the the way that Christ says that we
[1:02:25] must hate.
[1:02:30] If you hate not and come after me,
[1:02:32] you're not worthy.
[1:02:35] That there it's it speaks to where
[1:02:39] how strong love is.
[1:02:42] And the stronger the love, the stronger
[1:02:44] the confidence, the greater the capacity
[1:02:46] for pain and betrayal.
[1:02:48] I mean, let's just be honest. If you go
[1:02:51] you everyone here, if if Brother Mike
[1:02:53] and Sister Maddie were trusting me to
[1:02:54] give them a million-dollar check as a
[1:02:56] wedding gift, I mean
[1:03:00] I mean I'm I'm pretty sure they're not
[1:03:02] going to be really hurt. I mean, like
[1:03:04] too terribly hurt. You know, they don't
[1:03:07] get anything from me. Like, I mean, I
[1:03:09] shouldn't have done it anyways, right? I
[1:03:10] should have never trusted, you know? I
[1:03:12] didn't have any reason to believe that
[1:03:13] he had a million dollars. You know,
[1:03:15] there's a there there's some something
[1:03:16] there that when the it's the magnitude
[1:03:18] of trust. It's the magnitude of
[1:03:20] confidence. It's it's ONLY BEC IF I
[1:03:22] COULD SAY THIS FOR some grace in our
[1:03:23] relationships we have with one another.
[1:03:25] We only HURT EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE LOVE
[1:03:26] EACH other that much.
[1:03:29] The stronger the love, the greater the
[1:03:31] capacity for pain.
[1:03:33] But then also the greater capacity of of
[1:03:36] pain when we are betrayed.
[1:03:39] When we are betrayed by love, we retreat
[1:03:41] from it as a means of protecting
[1:03:42] ourselves from it.
[1:03:44] It's a means of safety that it's within
[1:03:47] this framework of trusting that I find
[1:03:49] myself hurt. It's in this framework of
[1:03:50] making myself vulnerable, that I find
[1:03:51] myself being taken advantage of. It's in
[1:03:53] this framework of trying to work on love
[1:03:55] and and loving and and GIVING OF MYSELF
[1:03:58] AND AND and trying to forge this union
[1:04:00] and this is any any kind of relationship
[1:04:02] that might BE IN THIS HORIZONTAL THAT
[1:04:04] WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES BEING HURT IN
[1:04:06] THAT, WE JUST AS SOON RETREAT from it
[1:04:08] and say, "Nope, not doing that again."
[1:04:11] as a means of saving ourselves. And I
[1:04:13] would say that sometimes it's necessary
[1:04:15] for us to heal. It's necessary for us to
[1:04:17] catch our breath. It's necessary for
[1:04:19] sometimes to disengage a little bit and
[1:04:21] get some distance to learn, GET OUR
[1:04:22] FOOTING BACK underneath us. But listen,
[1:04:25] if you retreat for too long,
[1:04:28] the idea of loving again can be very
[1:04:30] scary
[1:04:33] and our our idea of what it means to be
[1:04:36] safe can become very very distorted.
[1:04:40] this it was from these studying these
[1:04:42] things that I was struck with how that
[1:04:46] whenever religion and whenever church
[1:04:48] loses sight of God's love it becomes
[1:04:50] very unsafe
[1:04:52] and we can retreat into church service
[1:04:55] and we can retreat into service to one
[1:04:57] another and we can retreat to all the
[1:04:58] elements and the accutrants of church
[1:05:00] service and church function all without
[1:05:03] the love of God
[1:05:04] and without service to God
[1:05:07] and so our idea of what is safe can
[1:05:09] become very distorted Ed, you know, they
[1:05:12] say, and I'm sure that some have seen
[1:05:13] this and experienced this, that an
[1:05:14] animal that is caged for a short period
[1:05:16] of time cannot wait to be escaped from
[1:05:17] it, to escape from its prison. That cage
[1:05:20] for a short period of time that once
[1:05:21] loosed, it runs out.
[1:05:24] But take an animal and cage it long
[1:05:25] enough and you can open the door
[1:05:28] and they'll stay trembling in a corner,
[1:05:29] fearful
[1:05:31] of what what is in store for them
[1:05:32] outside the cage.
[1:05:35] And I believe that even for us sometimes
[1:05:37] who retreat from loving or being loved,
[1:05:40] we find ourselves in that cage. And if
[1:05:42] we stay too long, even with the door
[1:05:43] open, we're fearful of leaving it.
[1:05:46] And the wounds of love can cause scars,
[1:05:49] complexes that we hide behind. And we
[1:05:52] say we're doing it to protect ourselves,
[1:05:54] but we're doing it to our own harm.
[1:05:57] This is wonderful pregame talk right
[1:06:00] before we eat burgers and hot dogs.
[1:06:04] just working up a great appetite. Man,
[1:06:06] I've just never been more hungry in my
[1:06:07] life.
[1:06:09] Such levity and such lightness. And what
[1:06:11] a beautiful sermon for newlyweds.
[1:06:17] I don't know if it's dawned on either of
[1:06:19] them, but there is a moment when you
[1:06:21] recognize that marriage makes you
[1:06:23] vulnerable.
[1:06:24] The mutual commitment and trust. I could
[1:06:27] even say this.
[1:06:29] Your pastor went to great lengths to let
[1:06:30] me know you weren't moving here for me.
[1:06:34] She's move. She moved sister Mattie
[1:06:35] moved here for brother Micah.
[1:06:38] And when when when brother the more
[1:06:40] brother Micah realizes that, the more he
[1:06:42] realizes how vulnerable his wife is
[1:06:45] and how important his love for her is
[1:06:47] and how how strong it needs to be. This
[1:06:49] is just being unaware,
[1:06:51] self-aware of our commitment to one
[1:06:53] another, our mutual dependency, and
[1:06:55] these things. And so I'm sorry if it's
[1:06:56] not maybe not the uh the right kind of
[1:06:59] sermon to feed on before we want to
[1:07:00] enjoy lunch together, but it's very real
[1:07:03] what we experience as human beings, our
[1:07:05] vulnerability and our need for security.
[1:07:07] In the book CS Lewis's book, The Four
[1:07:10] Loves, he makes these statements that I
[1:07:12] just couldn't find any other way to
[1:07:13] express it than just to read it. I hope
[1:07:16] you can listen to this. It's very, very
[1:07:18] impactful. There is no safe investment.
[1:07:22] To love it all is to be vulnerable.
[1:07:25] Love anything and your heart will
[1:07:26] certainly be rung and possibly be
[1:07:28] broken. If you WANT TO MAKE SURE OF
[1:07:31] keeping it intact, you must give your
[1:07:33] heart to no one, not even to an animal.
[1:07:37] Wrap it carefully round with hobbies AND
[1:07:39] LITTLE LUXURIES. AVOID ALL
[1:07:41] ENTANGLEMENTS. LOCK IT UP SAFE IN THE
[1:07:43] CASKET OR COFFIN OF YOUR SELFISHNESS.
[1:07:46] But in that casket, safe, dark,
[1:07:49] motionless, airless, it will change.
[1:07:53] It'll not be broken. It will become
[1:07:56] unbreakable,
[1:07:57] impenetrable,
[1:07:59] irredeemable.
[1:08:01] The alternative to tragedy, or at least
[1:08:03] to the risk of tragedy, is damnation.
[1:08:06] THE ONLY PLACE OUTSIDE heaven where you
[1:08:09] can be perfectly safe from all the
[1:08:10] dangers and perputations of love is
[1:08:13] hell.
[1:08:15] You don't think loving is risky? You
[1:08:18] don't think the risk of love has caused
[1:08:20] some of us to retreat. And what happens
[1:08:22] is we get hard and we say, "I'm not
[1:08:24] going to get my heart broke again." Come
[1:08:25] on. Is anybody going to back me up on
[1:08:27] this?
[1:08:28] Don't be afraid just to own it. We know
[1:08:30] that in life, and this doesn't have to
[1:08:31] necessarily be in our marriages, it can
[1:08:33] be before our marriage. And we come into
[1:08:35] marriage with a lot of bad relationships
[1:08:37] with our parents or with our siblings
[1:08:39] and with other people and other
[1:08:40] relationships and uh uh infatuations and
[1:08:43] dependencies we had in through our adult
[1:08:44] life. AND A LOT OF THESE THINGS AND WE
[1:08:46] CARRY EVEN OUR CONDUCT in engagement AND
[1:08:48] COURTSHIP. WE CARRY OVER THESE COMPLEXES
[1:08:51] AND FEARS and we've come to have these
[1:08:52] real iron dispositions AND WE'VE
[1:08:54] HARDENED OURSELVES AND WE DO IT BECAUSE
[1:08:56] WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT OURSELVES. WE
[1:08:57] DON'T WANT TO BE VULNERABLE AND WE THINK
[1:08:59] THAT SOME WAY MY HEART'S NOT BEING
[1:09:01] BROKEN AND WE'RE LIKE, "YEAH, YOU CAN'T
[1:09:03] BREAK MY HEART. YOU CAN'T BREAK MY
[1:09:05] HEART." YEAH, MAYBE IT'S NOT BROKEN.
[1:09:07] THAT'S TRUE. BUT IT CAN'T EVEN be
[1:09:08] penetrated.
[1:09:11] It can't be moved.
[1:09:14] And we think, "Well, I JUST WANT TO BE
[1:09:15] SAFE." The only place outside of heaven
[1:09:17] you can be safe from loving is in hell.
[1:09:20] It's what CS Lewis said. And if I could
[1:09:23] close with this thought, the wounds of
[1:09:24] love will never heal heal without love.
[1:09:28] Only love can heal the wounds that have
[1:09:30] been caused by love.
[1:09:32] Both in receiving his unconditional love
[1:09:34] for us, the love we have to receive his
[1:09:36] unconditional love for us and then also
[1:09:38] his absolute forgiveness. But then also
[1:09:40] the wounds of love cannot heal without
[1:09:43] love even in our loving and forgiving
[1:09:45] others.
[1:09:47] Does not the Bible teach us how is it
[1:09:49] that we can accept his forgiveness and
[1:09:51] then hold unforgiveness in our heart
[1:09:52] towards others?
[1:09:54] Hatred, bitterness, unforgiveness can
[1:09:57] never heal or erase the scars from a
[1:10:00] vulnerable love.
[1:10:03] Can never heal or erase the scars and
[1:10:04] the wounds from being taken advantage of
[1:10:06] by trust.
[1:10:09] If I can say this, I just have a one
[1:10:12] more scripture I'd like to read
[1:10:16] because of vulnerability and and if I
[1:10:19] haven't made this clear in
[1:10:23] you have to embrace vulnerability at
[1:10:25] some point.
[1:10:26] Security is being at ease with
[1:10:28] vulnerability.
[1:10:29] It's not the absence of danger. It's not
[1:10:32] the fact that there is no danger. It's
[1:10:33] the fact that you recognize the risk.
[1:10:35] You acknowledge the danger. But I'm good
[1:10:37] with it. I'm at ease. And and I would
[1:10:41] say that God even recognizes that his
[1:10:43] love is pretty scary when you think
[1:10:44] about it. And what he asks us to do and
[1:10:47] he asks us to trust and he he kind of
[1:10:49] lays out the future and we don't know
[1:10:51] exactly how it's going to happen, but he
[1:10:52] just wants us to trust. He's he's on the
[1:10:54] other side of it saying, "I know from
[1:10:56] your vantage point, this is scary, but
[1:10:58] maybe you need to kind of accept the
[1:11:00] risk and the vulnerability because if
[1:11:03] you don't kind if you don't if you DON'T
[1:11:05] WRESTLE WITH THAT AND AREN'T WILLING TO
[1:11:06] ACCEPT IT, you're never going to get to
[1:11:08] where you want to be in my love."
[1:11:10] But it's because of this vulnerability
[1:11:13] and the insecurity that we have. I hope
[1:11:16] that you can catch this. Because of the
[1:11:18] sense of vulnerability and our
[1:11:20] insecurity, there's parts of your heart
[1:11:23] that have never been loved.
[1:11:28] That's just a summation of doors and
[1:11:30] door.
[1:11:32] Brother Brandon preaches about these
[1:11:33] doors of the heart
[1:11:35] and how THAT THERE'S PARTS TO our hearts
[1:11:38] the doors closed off limits. And we
[1:11:41] don't realize it, but we have these
[1:11:42] compartments, these places in our lives,
[1:11:44] these areas in our lives to where WE
[1:11:45] HAVE CLOSED IT OFF. AND BECAUSE YOU'VE
[1:11:48] HID BEHIND THE VULNERABILITY BECAUSE
[1:11:50] YOU'VE HID BEHIND THE PROTECTION OF NO,
[1:11:52] NO, UH, I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE AGAIN.
[1:11:53] I'M afraid to do it. I KNOW WHAT
[1:11:55] HAPPENS. I've been there. I'VE SEEN THIS
[1:11:56] BEFORE. I'VE SEEN HOW THIS ENDS. I DON'T
[1:11:58] WANT TO DO IT. BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE THAT.
[1:11:59] LISTEN, there's parts of your heart that
[1:12:01] HAVE NOT BEEN FELT THE LOVE OF GOD
[1:12:04] BECAUSE THE door shut. And if I could
[1:12:07] say this then if THERE ARE PARTS OF YOUR
[1:12:09] HEART, YOUR MIND, YOUR THINKING THAT
[1:12:11] JOHN IS SAYING, HEY, IF YOU STILL FEAR
[1:12:13] GOD AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HIS OPINION
[1:12:15] OF YOU THAT HIS LOVE HASN'T COMPLETELY
[1:12:18] WASHED YOU AND PURGED YOU, IF THERE'S
[1:12:20] PARTS OF YOUR HEART THAT HAVE NOT BEEN
[1:12:21] LOVED, THEN THERE'S PARTS OF your heart
[1:12:23] that have not loved.
[1:12:26] And I express that in a way of
[1:12:27] encouraging you. And I'm encouraged,
[1:12:30] I'll say this, a a as a father, I'm
[1:12:32] encouraged to know there's parts of my
[1:12:34] heart that can experience the love of
[1:12:36] God so that I know there's greater
[1:12:38] depths of love that I could show to my
[1:12:39] children. To know THAT THERE'S PARTS OF
[1:12:41] MY HEART THAT EXPERIENCE the love of God
[1:12:43] SO THAT THERE'S MORE LOVE THAT I CAN
[1:12:44] SHOW MY WIFE. I'M HAPPY TO KNOW THAT IF
[1:12:47] THERE'S A PART OF MY HEART, A DOOR THAT
[1:12:49] I'VE SHUT BECAUSE OF THINGS I'VE
[1:12:51] EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE, IF I COULD JUST
[1:12:53] TAKE THE COURAGE TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND
[1:12:55] LET THE LORD IN, THAT THERE'S A PART OF
[1:12:57] MY HEART THAT CAN LOVE IN A WAY THAT
[1:13:00] I'VE never loved before.
[1:13:06] If you invert the wisdom of Proverbs 29
[1:13:08] 25:1 19, confidence in an unfaithful man
[1:13:11] in a time of trouble is like a broken
[1:13:13] tooth and a foot out of joint. If we end
[1:13:15] inverted that, I think there's an
[1:13:17] inversion to this
[1:13:20] that the power of love and trust really
[1:13:22] shows itself in times of trouble
[1:13:28] and loving GOD AND TRUSTING God in this
[1:13:31] kind of reckless abandonment.
[1:13:34] I know that there's uh I think we've all
[1:13:36] heard the the song that Brother Maverick
[1:13:40] City or whoever it is, Brother Bethl
[1:13:41] wrote on reckless love.
[1:13:45] And uh that and I think initially I mean
[1:13:49] some people are kind of changing it to
[1:13:50] precious love and it's just funny how
[1:13:52] sometimes we try to sanctify some of
[1:13:54] these songs you like when heaven meets
[1:13:57] earth like a sloppy wet kiss. I mean
[1:13:58] they couldn't even play that on
[1:13:59] contemporary radio stations and now I'm
[1:14:00] hearing cuss words in Christian songs
[1:14:03] and BUT YET TO ME IT'S LIKE YEAH YOU
[1:14:05] KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT IS
[1:14:06] RECKLESS.
[1:14:09] I love you and nothing you can ever do
[1:14:11] will change that. really nothing. How
[1:14:14] fast you say the Audi could go, right?
[1:14:18] Nothing. Nothing I can do. Yeah. And
[1:14:22] that FROM A CERTAIN STANDPOINT, YEAH,
[1:14:24] IT'S RECKLESS.
[1:14:27] AND AND THEN TO LOVE HIM IN THE WAY THAT
[1:14:29] HE WANTS US TO LOVE HIM BACK. I KNOW
[1:14:31] THAT WE REALLY RECOGNIZE just how much
[1:14:33] he loves us. The more that we realize he
[1:14:35] loves US, THE MORE INADEQUATE OUR LOVE
[1:14:37] TO HIM BEGINS TO FEEL. BUT IT'S RIGHT
[1:14:39] THERE WHERE HE BEGINS TO TELL US, "OH,
[1:14:40] NO. YOU don't understand how much that
[1:14:42] means to me. Said, "BUT LORD, YOU LOVE
[1:14:44] ME. You did this for me. YOU DID THAT
[1:14:46] FOR ME. YOU DID THIS FOR ME. You did
[1:14:47] that for me." It's like, "Oh, no, no,
[1:14:47] no, no. You don't understand the how
[1:14:49] much it means to me that you love me
[1:14:50] back."
[1:14:52] Amen.
[1:14:53] YOU DON'T YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. JUST YOU
[1:14:55] JUST THAT THAT CONFESSION, THAT DESIRE,
[1:14:58] I KNOW YOUR HEART. YOU YOU CAN NEVER DO
[1:14:59] FOR ME WHAT I DID FOR YOU. IT'S
[1:15:01] IMPOSSIBLE. DO WE NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THE
[1:15:04] PARABLE OF THE OF THE ONE WHO FOUND THE
[1:15:06] TREASURE THAT WE'RE NOT THE ONE THAT
[1:15:08] FOUND IT? WE'RE the treasure. YES.
[1:15:10] LIKE THAT'S HOW HE FEELS ABOUT US.
[1:15:12] HE'S LIKE, "LISTEN, LISTEN. I WANT YOU
[1:15:13] TO LISTEN LISTEN JOSHUA. I SOLD
[1:15:16] EVERYTHING TO HAVE YOU. WOULD YOU HAVE
[1:15:18] ME?" AND YOU'RE LIKE, "YES, I DO." AND
[1:15:20] HE'S LIKE, "YES,
[1:15:22] YES."
[1:15:23] Like he HE HE WANTS TO HEAR THAT FROM
[1:15:25] US. WE'RE LIKE, "I DO. YOU'RE GREAT.
[1:15:28] YOU'RE GOD. IT just doesn't MAKE MUCH
[1:15:29] SENSE." AND SO I REALIZED THAT FROM OUR
[1:15:31] VANTAGE POINT, loving him and trusting
[1:15:33] him makes us feel very vulnerable
[1:15:37] in times of trouble.
[1:15:40] And in times of weakness,
[1:15:42] we don't feel that way when everything's
[1:15:43] going great,
[1:15:45] but it's in times of trouble.
[1:15:47] But it's in that moment,
[1:15:50] in the time when we're wanting to kind
[1:15:52] of uh hide. It's in the moment when we
[1:15:55] want to withdraw, that's when his love
[1:15:58] pays off. Amen.
[1:16:01] It's in that moment of I'm kind of I'm
[1:16:03] in that in that in between
[1:16:06] when it's like, well, everything's going
[1:16:08] great, BUT NOW EVERYTHING'S FALLING
[1:16:09] APART. AND IT'S IN THAT MOMENT, IT'S
[1:16:10] LIKE WE START TRYING TO RETHINK things
[1:16:11] like, "Wait a minute. Where's all this
[1:16:13] trust got me? What's happening? I I I I
[1:16:17] was trusting the Lord in this, AND I WAS
[1:16:18] TRUSTING THE LORD IN THAT, AND NOW
[1:16:19] EVERYTHING'S FALLING APART." AND AND AND
[1:16:21] GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU SAYING, "YOU'VE
[1:16:23] trusted my love all the way to this."
[1:16:25] Why would you why are you getting
[1:16:27] nervous now?
[1:16:30] And he's saying the the FACT YOU YOU
[1:16:32] TRUSTED MY LOVE AND IT'S GOTTEN YOU
[1:16:34] THROUGH ALL THESE THINGS AND GOT THAT'S
[1:16:35] WHY YOU'VE ENJOYED ALL THESE THINGS.
[1:16:37] THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THE THINGS THAT YOU
[1:16:38] HAVE. YEAH. Things are starting to maybe
[1:16:40] get difficult and hard and things are
[1:16:42] LOOKING REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT AND NOW
[1:16:44] YOU'RE STARTING TO DOUBT. NO, THIS IS
[1:16:46] THE PAYOFF TIME.
[1:16:47] AMEN.
[1:16:49] Like this is the moment when you need MY
[1:16:51] LOVE THE MOST.
[1:16:52] THIS IS WHEN YOU NEED TO TRUST me the
[1:16:54] most.
[1:16:56] My one of my working titles was full
[1:16:59] send.
[1:17:02] I don't know if it's just those who
[1:17:04] snowboard would know or skaters, right?
[1:17:07] The skaters get it.
[1:17:10] There's that. In other words, IT'S IT'S
[1:17:12] THIS idea of I'm risking it all.
[1:17:15] I'm just going to do the jump. I
[1:17:18] WHATEVER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE, I'M ALL
[1:17:20] IN. AND IT'S AT THAT MOMENT HE SAYS,
[1:17:22] "NOW DON'T ABANDON YOUR CONFIDENCE NOW.
[1:17:26] THIS IS THE PAYOFF TIME.
[1:17:28] THIS IS THE moment when you need it the
[1:17:30] most. THIS IS WHAT LOVE IS FOR.
[1:17:33] If you if you were only in IT FOR THE
[1:17:34] GOOD, IF YOU WERE ONLY IN IT FOR THE
[1:17:36] THILLS, IF YOU WERE ONLY IN IT FOR THE
[1:17:37] POPULARITY, you're only IN IT FOR THE
[1:17:39] BLESSINGS, YOU WERE ONLY IN IT FOR ALL
[1:17:40] THE OTHER THINGS THAT I COULD PROVIDE.
[1:17:42] IF YOU WERE JUST IN IT FOR THE MONEY,
[1:17:44] NOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HARD PART,
[1:17:46] YOU'RE LIKE, "NOPE, I'M GONE."
[1:17:49] RIGHT? But if there's love there, it's
[1:17:51] like, you know what? This is what love
[1:17:53] is for.
[1:17:56] Oswald Chambers said, "Faith is the
[1:17:57] deliberate confidence in the character
[1:17:59] of God whose ways you may not understand
[1:18:02] at the time."
[1:18:05] That's what why love speaks so much of
[1:18:07] confidence and trust. That's what faith
[1:18:09] is. And so if I could bring this around
[1:18:14] to
[1:18:16] there is no fear in love.
[1:18:20] We're acknowledging our vulnerability.
[1:18:25] And because we're vulnerable, we ought
[1:18:27] not to create
[1:18:30] our own means of protection that keep us
[1:18:32] from being loved and love loving.
[1:18:35] And in Psalms 56:3,
[1:18:40] I think you ought to read this as
[1:18:44] forever truth. Not just the words of one
[1:18:45] in the Old Testament or one who didn't
[1:18:47] know the love of God, but just read it
[1:18:48] as one as a permanent truth. What time I
[1:18:53] am afraid, I will trust in thee.
[1:18:57] Fear isn't the absence of perfect love.
[1:19:02] It is what perfect love is for.
[1:19:06] At what time I'm afraid? I'll trust in
[1:19:09] you.
[1:19:11] In other words,
[1:19:14] I know this is the paradox and maybe
[1:19:16] it's just why in preparing this for
[1:19:18] these weeks. It's I wrestled with how to
[1:19:21] express it. There's so much paradox to
[1:19:23] this. We think there is no fear in love.
[1:19:27] No, there is no fear in love. So that if
[1:19:29] we have fear,
[1:19:32] there is no love. But if I could say it
[1:19:34] in a way that maybe doesn't make a lot
[1:19:35] of sense, if there was no fear, you
[1:19:39] wouldn't need perfect love.
[1:19:43] So the one the one has not nullified the
[1:19:46] other, it has given it a purpose
[1:19:50] because there is fear. God has a perfect
[1:19:52] love. If there was no fear, maybe love
[1:19:54] would be enough.
[1:19:56] There was no punishment. IF THERE WAS NO
[1:19:58] TORMENT, LOVE WOULD BE ENOUGH. BUT GOD
[1:20:00] KNOWING WITH THE SPECTRE OF FEAR,
[1:20:02] KNOWING WITH THE SPECTRE OF DISTRUST,
[1:20:04] KNOWING WITH ALL THE WOUNDS AND SCARS
[1:20:05] THAT WE WOULD GO THROUGH, HE KNEW LOVE
[1:20:07] IS NOT ENOUGH. ACTUALLY, PERFECT LOVE.
[1:20:11] This is what we need is this PERFECT
[1:20:13] LOVE.
[1:20:14] AND AT WHAT TIME I AM AFRAID? IT HAS NOT
[1:20:17] NULLIFIED YOUR LOVE. IT HAS GIVEN LOVE A
[1:20:19] PURPOSE. AT WHAT TIME I AM AFRAID? IT
[1:20:22] HAS NOT DIMINISHED MY LOVE FOR YOU. AT
[1:20:24] WHAT TIME I AM AFRAID? IT HAS GIVEN MY
[1:20:26] LOVE AND TRUST IN YOU. reason
[1:20:29] just as we pre HAD PREACHED BEFORE IN
[1:20:32] HOW THAT THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT
[1:20:34] GIVE PATIENCE A JOB to do.
[1:20:39] This fear gives perfect love a purpose.
[1:20:43] And if I could say this, even in the
[1:20:44] idea of the full sin in the moment
[1:20:46] whenever there's doubt, this is what the
[1:20:47] woman ought to have done in the garden.
[1:20:49] At the very moment she felt betrayed
[1:20:52] through the lies of the devil. At that
[1:20:54] very moment, that's when she should have
[1:20:56] trusted in him.
[1:20:58] At that very moment, at that very
[1:21:00] moment, he says, "Well, God may be
[1:21:01] hiding something." She should have said,
[1:21:03] "Then it must be for a reason.
[1:21:06] If he hasn't showed me, maybe I don't
[1:21:08] need to know yet.
[1:21:09] If he let this happen, he's only doing
[1:21:11] it for my good.
[1:21:12] At what time I am afraid, I'll trust in
[1:21:14] him.
[1:21:15] At what time things are going, I'll
[1:21:17] trust in him. And no matter what is true
[1:21:20] about what IS SAID, NO MATTER WHAT IS
[1:21:21] TRUE ABOUT WHAT IS DONE, THERE'S A
[1:21:23] CERTAIN LEVEL OF TRUSTING NOT NOT
[1:21:25] NECESSARILY THIS DEVIL, NOT NECESSARILY
[1:21:28] ADAM OR SOMEBODY ELSE, BUT IT'S TRUSTING
[1:21:30] HIM.
[1:21:32] THIS IS WHAT THE WOMAN COULD HAVE DONE
[1:21:34] IN THAT MOMENT OF QUESTIONING. I MAY NOT
[1:21:37] UNDERSTAND HIM. I MAY NOT UNDERSTAND
[1:21:40] WHAT HE'S DOING. BUT IF HE'S ALLOWING
[1:21:42] THESE THINGS TO COME TO PASS, THEN I'M
[1:21:44] GOING TO TRUST THAT HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S
[1:21:46] DOING. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:21:48] And listen, IT'S THAT VERTICAL THAT I'M
[1:21:50] TRYING TO EXPRESS. IF I IF MAYBE I BEGIN
[1:21:52] TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON THE HORIZONTAL, I
[1:21:54] BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH WE HAVE SO
[1:21:57] SUCH GREAT DIFFICULTY TRUSTING GOD
[1:21:59] BECAUSE OF OUR HORIZONTAL RELATIONSHIPS.
[1:22:02] AND HE'S CONSTANTLY HAVING TO address
[1:22:03] the misunderstandings caused by the
[1:22:05] horizontal so that we don't
[1:22:06] misunderstand the vertical.
[1:22:09] And I would say if trusting
[1:22:12] is something very hard for you to do. I
[1:22:14] know this is where people get nervous.
[1:22:16] They think that to forgive is means a
[1:22:19] certain thing and trusting means a
[1:22:21] certain thing. But I can say that it
[1:22:23] could be said, well, I mean, if you
[1:22:26] don't care, you don't care.
[1:22:28] If you're numb, you're numb.
[1:22:32] But if trusting and loving feels beyond
[1:22:35] you,
[1:22:37] then just fall into his love.
[1:22:39] Amen.
[1:22:39] Go full sinned. Risk it all.
[1:22:44] Because you'll never heal by running
[1:22:46] from love,
[1:22:48] but by just diving deeper into his love.
[1:22:51] Amen.
[1:22:52] And I acknowledge how scary it looks.
[1:22:56] Because even in natural relationships,
[1:22:58] commitment is scary.
[1:23:01] It's what makes different decisions in
[1:23:03] life uh so uh
[1:23:07] so hard and we wrestle with it whenever
[1:23:09] we're proposed with the risk-free
[1:23:10] transaction. Try it out. You know what?
[1:23:13] Don't even pay me. You just take it.
[1:23:15] Keep it. If you like it, just come back
[1:23:17] and pay for it. You know what we would
[1:23:18] do? Thank you very much. Right. Do you
[1:23:22] know my name? No. Do you know where I
[1:23:23] live? No. You have any cameras? Nope.
[1:23:25] Okay. I'm going to come back and pay for
[1:23:26] this. Right. Risk-free transaction. kind
[1:23:29] of like all you did with those loans the
[1:23:30] government was giving out, right? Never
[1:23:32] had a payroll in your life, but you had
[1:23:34] SEVERAL PPOS, RIGHT? YES. WOOHOO.
[1:23:36] KACHING, RIGHT? They're going to forgive
[1:23:37] it anyways.
[1:23:39] When it's risk- free, RIGHT? YOU JUST
[1:23:41] YOU JUST ENJOY IT. YOU JUST TAKE IT. AND
[1:23:43] WHAT MAKES DECISIONS DIFFICULT? The
[1:23:44] commitment, the cost, the risk.
[1:23:48] And so, EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE THINGS
[1:23:50] OF THE LORD, WE LOOK AT IT. WE recognize
[1:23:53] that it can be scary. But he calls from
[1:23:56] beyond
[1:23:57] the scariness.
[1:23:59] Even in that picture, right, Bre talks
[1:24:01] about that it looked like clouds and
[1:24:05] it looks chaotic and it looks dark, but
[1:24:07] then when you get closer, it's angels.
[1:24:09] And I know sometimes God's love looks
[1:24:11] really messy and chaotic. You're looking
[1:24:13] at it the wrong way.
[1:24:14] Because his voice calls you beyond it.
[1:24:16] He says, "You can trust me." I think
[1:24:18] maybe we've been the victim of too many
[1:24:20] trust falls that have become trust fails
[1:24:23] and we instinctively when it comes to
[1:24:25] love and it comes to trust even if we're
[1:24:27] not recognizing it we're operating under
[1:24:28] a complex or a scar or a limp and it
[1:24:32] keeps us from trusting God.
[1:24:36] And you won't heal by
