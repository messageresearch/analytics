[0:00] so sons are to be in the family under
[0:03] preparation to find their life
[0:06] mission and to be a provider and a
[0:09] leader and a benefactor to a wife and to
[0:13] children so really by definition as
[0:16] Fathers as husbands we need to have this
[0:19] Vision within our heart we don't just
[0:23] we're not just having fun with our kids
[0:25] we're not
[0:26] just uh making sure they eat something
[0:29] and and get off to school but that it's
[0:32] our duty that we're preparing Sons right
[0:36] the the uh children of one's youth are
[0:38] like arrows in the quiver right so in
[0:41] other words we're aiming them for
[0:43] something we're aiming them for what God
[0:46] has for them we're teaching them how to
[0:48] find God's purpose for their life and at
[0:50] the same time we also know within a
[0:53] certain realm we can tell them exactly
[0:55] what God's purpose is for them now the
[0:57] journey is is different and the
[0:59] outworking of that is different but most
[1:02] people are not gifted to be Unix for the
[1:04] kingdom of heaven right there is a gift
[1:07] and Paul speaks about that but but most
[1:11] people are not in that in that spot if
[1:14] you are may God bless you and may you
[1:16] serve Christ with all your heart with
[1:18] singleness of Mind in that state to to
[1:22] to be a single person if that's your
[1:24] gift however most people don't have that
[1:26] gift and so we really understand that
[1:30] sons are need to be prepared for broad
[1:34] shoulders strength to carry a load to
[1:38] carry responsibility for a wife and for
[1:41] children they're not in preparation for
[1:44] being top five video game players in the
[1:47] world not everybody's Elon Musk I
[1:51] guess who can do all that and be the top
[1:54] to a top video game player really if you
[1:57] if you understand it most people most
[2:00] young men that dedicate their lives to
[2:03] playing a lot of video games end up in a
[2:06] PL in a place where they are feminized
[2:10] they become effeminate because it's
[2:12] trying to express
[2:14] masculinity in a perverted way in a
[2:17] virtual way and when you try to express
[2:20] it in a virtual way all that goes along
[2:23] with that is taking away true and
[2:26] genuine masculinity that God has
[2:28] designed for young men to be what should
[2:31] young men be doing
[2:34] they I'm just going to I'll just go for
[2:37] a second and then get back to my notes
[2:39] what should young men be doing they
[2:40] should be moving their bodies they
[2:42] should be outside getting dirty they
[2:45] should be learning how to work with
[2:47] their hands they should be taught they
[2:50] should be LED under a father who's
[2:53] showing them how to lead a family in
[2:55] other words if you have family devotions
[2:57] your sons should start as they get older
[3:00] leading helping lead family devotion so
[3:02] that when they come and become a father
[3:05] become a husband become a father and
[3:06] that that is the right order husband and
[3:09] then father
[3:12] um that it's not a mystery to them that
[3:14] they don't know I grew up and that's not
[3:16] the life that I had I didn't know
[3:18] anything about it and it took many me
[3:20] many years of studying and reading and
[3:23] finally coming to a place hey why aren't
[3:24] you doing family worship with your
[3:27] family oh people do that I didn't
[3:32] know and so the these things it
[3:34] shouldn't if they're if you're listening
[3:36] here and you're a man and you're a
[3:38] husband or a grandfather even it's not
[3:40] too late if you're a
[3:43] grandfather encourage and teach your
[3:47] family to do that to have a time of
[3:50] Family Worship
[3:53] together daughters are to be in the
[3:55] family under preparation to be a helper
[3:59] a child Bearer and a homemaker this
[4:02] should be the vision that we're
[4:04] implanting within our
[4:06] daughters not you're going to have a
[4:09] career go after this go after no that's
[4:13] not God's Vision that's not the
[4:15] scripture that's not what it's putting
[4:17] forward and so we're we we are how many
[4:21] believe we're living under the influence
[4:24] of the seven voices of the seven
[4:26] Thunders that have uttered their voices
[4:28] yes right and so that seventh seal is
[4:32] bringing together all the mysteries of
[4:35] the Bible that have been
[4:37] hidden right the word is being has been
[4:41] restored into our hearts into the hearts
[4:43] of every
[4:45] believer so that that is going to bring
[4:47] the restoration of the Oneness of the
[4:51] last
[4:52] Adam and the last Eve that doesn't
[4:56] fall so the bride actually becomes comes
[5:00] the perfect
[5:02] reflection of the vision that Christ has
[5:05] she becomes the manifested man she
[5:08] becomes the she is the the the the bride
[5:11] is the image and Glory of
[5:14] Christ so then let's let that trickle
[5:17] down a little bit and see that our
[5:20] families need to to to turn to this
[5:23] place where we are the reflection of
[5:26] that same thing of Christ and his bride
[5:30] am and so the restoration of the word
[5:32] didn't just come to so that we would
[5:34] have a great understanding of the right
[5:37] Doctrine but that our lives would
[5:39] literally become the reflection visible
[5:42] manifestation of Christ yes amen so the
[5:45] woman is the glory of the
[5:47] man and the man is the glory of God is
[5:50] that what the scripture says right so in
[5:53] other words man is a a reflection of the
[5:56] out ring of God's nature and attributes
[6:00] and then the woman she was taken out of
[6:02] a man the woman is a reflection of the
[6:06] nature and attributes of the
[6:08] man so if we translate that down into
[6:11] our own lives a man must have God's
[6:13] vision for himself and for his
[6:19] family when many times when we come to
[6:23] marriage the the end go for a for a
[6:25] young man the end goal is some young
[6:28] lady
[6:30] but we're setting our goal and our
[6:32] vision a lot lower than we are supposed
[6:34] to set it because if a woman is to
[6:37] reflect the is the vision of a man right
[6:40] because that's the
[6:41] type so she she is the glory of man he's
[6:44] the glory of God so he the man is then
[6:47] not supposed to reflect his own idea his
[6:49] own thoughts his own Vision but he
[6:52] reflects the vision that God has for him
[6:55] and when he reflects that then his wife
[6:57] is supposed to take that same vision
[7:00] and reflect that to the
[7:02] world and so when a man looks at it and
[7:06] says my whole life goal is the woman
[7:09] this becomes an idolatrous situation
[7:13] where he is actually putting her first
[7:15] before God right very good and so then
[7:19] if she is to reflect that same vision
[7:21] then what in the world is happening in
[7:23] the home but self centered idolatry so
[7:27] you have a you this is the world we live
[7:30] in a a woman who is self-centered
[7:33] focused on self and a man who's focused
[7:36] on only pleasing her not concerned about
[7:39] pleasing God not concerned about doing
[7:42] what is is glorifying to God but simply
[7:45] wants to make her happy and she then in
[7:48] turn wants herself to be happy we have a
[7:51] we have a recipe for total chaos total
[7:57] disaster and so first of all the
[8:00] headship is Flowing down who is who is
[8:03] the head of the man not himself Christ
[8:06] is who is the head of Christ God who is
[8:10] the head of the woman the man so the man
[8:14] is not to reflect himself he is to
[8:18] understand what Christ is speaking to
[8:20] him and then that is how he needs to
[8:23] lead his family you're not there to do
[8:26] your own will what did Christ himself do
[8:29] not my will but thy will be done I've
[8:32] come not to do my own will but the will
[8:34] of him that sent me that has to be what
[8:37] every father every husband looks at the
[8:41] situation in his life as well that is
[8:45] what a Godly woman can get
[8:48] behind that's what she is going to
[8:50] appreciate reflecting to know that her
[8:53] husband's number one concern is doing
[8:55] the will of God and young ladies if
[8:57] you're looking for a husband
[9:00] this is should be your number one
[9:01] concern does this man fully surrendered
[9:04] to Christ not if his hair is nice not if
[9:08] he has a good smile not if he's popular
[9:11] but first and
[9:13] foremost he he needs to be reflecting
[9:16] Christ in his own life and that his
[9:18] greatest burden and his greatest concern
[9:20] is doing the will of him that sent
[9:24] him anything besides that is a disaster
[9:32] so we again we as the bride take the
[9:34] mind of Christ Christ doesn't take the
[9:37] mind of the
[9:38] Bride so must our wives take forth the
[9:42] Mind purpose vision of her husband and
[9:46] become a reflection of that so so men
[9:50] young men we should all have a clear
[9:53] picture of God's vision for us now this
[9:57] is we'll talk about this more and we'll
[9:58] lay we're lay the foundation but I can
[10:01] tell every one of you young men what
[10:03] God's purpose is for you you say how in
[10:06] the world can you do that because
[10:08] there's a general calling for every man
[10:11] that's created and it was told to Adam
[10:13] and it's for you too and I can tell
[10:16] every young woman this is what God has
[10:18] called you to right because it went to
[10:21] Eve and Paul clarified it and brother
[10:24] brandham brought brought us back to that
[10:26] original faith and so when when it comes
[10:29] down to specifically I can't tell if
[10:31] you're going to be a carpenter a
[10:32] preacher an engineer that's something
[10:36] only you and God can work out you know
[10:39] he's he's gifted each one of us
[10:41] differently and it's our goal to our our
[10:44] desire personally as individuals to
[10:47] understand what our gifting is and then
[10:50] use that for the glory of God and the
[10:52] furthering of the
[10:53] Kingdom brother brandham in the sermon
[10:55] doors Indo 1965 says I like a man of
[10:59] vision I like people that's got
[11:01] something they're fighting for just not
[11:03] just lay around well every what comes
[11:05] along will be all right oh be up and add
[11:08] it and Lincoln never let his education
[11:11] stand in the way he had something to do
[11:13] I think every Christian ought to be that
[11:15] way find your purpose and go do it every
[11:18] member of this chapter just not well we
[11:20] have a breakfast once a month that isn't
[11:22] it or once every Sun Saturday have a
[11:25] purpose in life something you're going
[11:26] to do God has placed you here do
[11:29] something about it every member of every
[11:31] Church there's a Revival in town that
[11:33] Revival is there for a purpose let's get
[11:36] something out of it let's do something
[11:38] about
[11:39] it all right in the sermon as the eagle
[11:43] stirreth up her nest 1957 Brothers you
[11:45] have that on the
[11:47] PowerPoint when I hear of a church that
[11:49] hasn't got any ambition to grow there's
[11:52] something wrong with that church the
[11:54] Church of the Living God has a high
[11:56] ambition and another thing the Church of
[11:58] the Living God is built high because
[12:00] it's got high anticipations and
[12:03] expectations say well we belong to the
[12:04] church Our Father served in the church
[12:06] years ago that might be fine but the
[12:08] Church of the Living God can't sit still
[12:10] its Ambitions is to go higher and
[12:14] further and and brother brandham
[12:18] skipping down says this Christian at his
[12:19] work is set on a hill his Ambitions is
[12:22] high to win his boss or somebody else to
[12:25] Christ that's right his expectation is
[12:27] high somewhere that God will give him a
[12:30] chance to speak to somebody amen so we
[12:33] should have each man should have God's
[12:37] vision and set his
[12:40] expectations High many times in life as
[12:44] an aside you get what you
[12:47] expect this isn't just in a church
[12:49] service this isn't just at special
[12:51] meetings but it's in your everyday life
[12:54] if you said it low you know I I'm not a
[12:57] lucky person I've heard people say that
[12:59] to me through over time I'm just not
[13:01] very lucky I don't I don't have many
[13:04] good things happen to me uh and it's
[13:07] like this is becomes a
[13:09] self-fulfilling prophecy is their life
[13:12] becomes ruined because everything is wo
[13:14] as me negative bad things happen to me
[13:16] no we set our Ambitions and expectations
[13:19] high and we keep them there no matter
[13:22] what comes our way right all right so
[13:26] looking at the importance of
[13:31] fathers the number one indicator of
[13:33] young people falling into a life of
[13:35] crime is that the home does not have a
[13:38] father in
[13:39] it so I think you could go on to the
[13:42] next
[13:44] screen uh keep going there we go so
[13:48] fatherless homes produce 63% this is in
[13:51] the United States 63% of used suicides
[13:55] 71% of high school dropouts 90% of all
[13:59] homeless and runaway youth 85% of all
[14:02] children who show behavior disorders 71%
[14:05] of all pregnant
[14:08] teenagers so the other part is when a
[14:10] father has a good connection with the
[14:12] heart of his children and is truly
[14:14] Walking with God statistics show that
[14:17] 90% of children remain faithful and
[14:20] continue in the faith without father's
[14:24] participation this percentage sinks to
[14:26] below
[14:27] 50% so when just a mother is Walking
[14:30] with God the chances are the children
[14:33] are not going to they're going to enter
[14:35] into the father's Vision what is the
[14:37] Father's Vision not to walk with God so
[14:40] a higher percentage is going to just
[14:42] say Dad isn't doing it even daughters
[14:46] daughters if you if you can understand
[14:49] it Sons and
[14:52] Daughters need a father to call them to
[14:56] maturity a mother's nature is not to
[14:59] call their children to maturity but to
[15:02] protect and
[15:03] guard and and nurture them that's that's
[15:07] how they built her if father doesn't
[15:09] call the children up to maturity they're
[15:12] going to stay immature and again if
[15:16] they're not if fathers aren't Walking
[15:17] with God the likelihood of those
[15:19] children not walking with God is is
[15:22] higher than if it if if he was so 1
[15:27] Timothy 58
[15:30] this always amazes me if any provide not
[15:33] for his own and especially for those of
[15:34] his own house he has denied the faith
[15:37] and is worse than an
[15:40] Infidel so it's it is very powerful
[15:43] because we realize that this is
[15:46] connected to a man's obedience so for
[15:49] for this doesn't say if any woman does
[15:52] not provide for her family she's denied
[15:55] the face and she's worse than in Infidel
[15:58] the the part it says about sisters is
[16:00] that she'll be saved in child birth or
[16:04] childbearing if she continues in faith
[16:07] and truth right and so for for man you
[16:10] could almost put it as he'll be saved in
[16:13] providing for his family if he continues
[16:16] in faith and truth right so why is Paul
[16:21] saying this this is basically a man
[16:25] who's refusing to be obedient to what
[16:27] God has called him to do
[16:29] he's essentially saying I don't I don't
[16:32] need to reflect
[16:34] Christ I can ju I I can just let my
[16:38] family deal with what they deal with
[16:41] this is not the attributes of a man and
[16:44] so it's not saying that the person is
[16:46] actually denied the faith but that but
[16:48] the fact that he doesn't provide for his
[16:50] family is in itself a denial of the
[16:54] faith he could just say no no I don't
[16:56] deny the faith I believe every word of
[16:57] the Bible I'm standing with Christ but
[17:00] the the verdict of the Apostle is you're
[17:03] you're worse than an unbeliever not just
[17:06] as bad as an unbeliever you're actually
[17:08] worse than someone that refuses to
[17:10] believe the
[17:12] word and he's saying you're an apostate
[17:15] no I'm not an apostate I believe the
[17:17] word you're not providing for your
[17:19] family you don't have a heart to provide
[17:20] for your family it means you're an
[17:23] apostate and you you've your status
[17:26] level is lower than an infidel
[17:30] it's very harsh but it is very it's very
[17:33] important to realize that God has called
[17:37] those who have the experience of
[17:39] Salvation to express that salvation in
[17:42] their life and men are called to express
[17:45] it differently than women are called to
[17:48] express express it now there's certain
[17:50] there are certain the fruit of the
[17:52] spirit it's not masculine fruit of the
[17:54] spirit and feminine fruit of the spirit
[17:56] at the same time there's an IM masculine
[17:59] expression of the same fruit of the
[18:00] spirit and there's a feminine expression
[18:03] of the same fruit of the spirit and yet
[18:06] there are different works that God has
[18:09] ordained for a man than works that he's
[18:11] ordained for a woman 1 Corinthians
[18:16] 16:13 another verse that always stuns me
[18:20] watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit
[18:23] you like men be strong so that word quit
[18:28] you like men
[18:29] is the Greek word
[18:33] andrii so it's four words but in Greek
[18:36] it's just one
[18:38] word and the meaning is to render Brave
[18:41] or manly to show or be behave oneself
[18:45] like a
[18:47] man so essentially as I look at this
[18:50] he's putting the attribute of of Bravery
[18:54] together with being a
[18:56] man so if you're if you're a
[18:59] man there should be an amount of
[19:02] Bravery that you have in your in your
[19:05] own life and the reason is that is that
[19:07] is an expression of the strength that
[19:09] you need to have to Pro protect and take
[19:13] care of your
[19:14] family and this is directly connected to
[19:18] what God designed Adam for 1 Corinthians
[19:24] 6:9 know ye not that the unrighteous
[19:27] shall not inherit the kingdom of God God
[19:29] be not deceived neither fornicators nor
[19:31] idolators nor adulterers nor
[19:34] effeminate nor abusers abusers of
[19:36] themselves with mankind nor thieves nor
[19:39] Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[19:41] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[19:43] of
[19:44] God and such were some of you but you
[19:47] are washed but you are Sanctified but
[19:48] you're justified in the name of the Lord
[19:50] Jesus and by the spirit of our God so
[19:53] Paul puts within this list of of
[19:57] behaviors that would disqual ify you
[19:59] from entry into the kingdom of God one
[20:01] of them is
[20:02] eminate so this is a man who's
[20:06] expressing female
[20:09] characteristics and this goes along with
[20:12] Deuteronomy
[20:13] 22:5 that says that it's an Abomination
[20:16] for a man to put on a woman's garment
[20:18] and for a woman to put on a man's
[20:20] garment this goes goes beyond that and
[20:23] goes to the nature that's on the inside
[20:26] of what it's expressing neither is that
[20:28] the N that you're not as a man you don't
[20:31] express a feminine characteristic
[20:35] neither should you dress with feminine
[20:37] characteristics and the same goes for a
[20:40] woman but here Paul is speaking about
[20:42] eminite men become disqualified so again
[20:46] this is how important this is an
[20:48] expression of Christ so if you're a man
[20:51] and you have the Holy Spirit that's
[20:53] going to lead you into a place where
[20:56] you're expressing masculine
[20:59] characteristics now don't lose hope Paul
[21:02] says and such were some of you some of
[21:05] you were eminate men but the Holy Spirit
[21:08] has delivered you from this captivity of
[21:11] the devil so that you can express Godly
[21:18] manliness all
[21:20] right modern
[21:24] culture does not seek to lead itself to
[21:29] feminization and if I can just make a
[21:32] commentary within that I think we've
[21:34] seen in this recent election a the start
[21:39] of a rejection of the feminization of
[21:42] everything and that's wonderful but
[21:45] there's a there's a lot of fighting and
[21:47] there's a lot of battling against evil
[21:49] spirits that needs to happen still
[21:51] within the body of
[21:53] Christ and and within real
[21:56] Believers Christian men need to throw
[21:59] off this modern culture of the
[22:01] feminization of everything and become
[22:03] real men again real leaders Real Men of
[22:06] Honor Real Men of strength virtue real
[22:09] men that speak the truth no matter what
[22:11] the consequences that have courage that
[22:14] are willing to die for the truth that
[22:16] are willing to stand and to die in
[22:19] protection of their wife and their
[22:21] children and their sisters and their
[22:25] mother all right so again we've we've
[22:29] we've looked at and we've seen what
[22:31] brother brandham has said about
[22:33] motherhood getting out of its place
[22:35] right but remember that motherhood
[22:39] cannot get out of its place until first
[22:41] manhood gets out of its place because
[22:44] men are the stronger vessel women are
[22:46] the weaker vessel and so in order for
[22:49] the woman she cannot overpower the man
[22:52] my wife can't say I want you to do this
[22:54] and come try to beat me up it's not
[22:55] going to work she's she's pretty strong
[22:58] I'll I'll give her
[23:00] that but she still can't whoop
[23:03] [Laughter]
[23:05] me and that's the same that's the same
[23:08] and of course my duty is to protect her
[23:11] not anything besides that that's what
[23:14] strength is that's what the strength of
[23:16] a man is designed
[23:18] for but the point being is our culture
[23:21] got effeminized because the
[23:24] men refused to
[23:26] lead they allow Ed the women to take the
[23:30] place in fact it was men who voted to
[23:34] give women the right to
[23:39] vote and so again we can we can we can
[23:42] uh rebuke the women for being out of
[23:45] place but first we should rebuke the men
[23:48] for letting them be out of
[23:50] place a woman is designed to have a
[23:53] quiet and meek spirit and yes there's
[23:56] that's perhaps a uh you know there's a a
[24:01] what do you call
[24:03] it a spectrum of meekness and
[24:07] quietness and some some of y'all sisters
[24:09] are are on the edge there
[24:14] but they're on the edge of the spectrum
[24:16] but you're still on the Spectrum praise
[24:18] the
[24:20] Lord amen we want to find balance right
[24:24] we don't want to be so quiet and meek
[24:26] that we're scared and fearful and can't
[24:28] take a stand for the word as as sisters
[24:31] and then on the other hand we don't want
[24:32] to be so bold that we're trampling over
[24:36] men and children and everyone else
[24:38] around
[24:39] us and so it's it's it's important to
[24:42] understand that meekness is not
[24:45] weakness right Moses was the most was
[24:48] the meekest man he wrote about himself
[24:51] meekest man upon the Earth what do
[24:52] meekness means it means the ability to
[24:55] be
[24:56] led and so God has designed kind a woman
[24:59] with a nature to be led so whe When a
[25:02] man doesn't lead her she will step up
[25:05] and lead and at the same time she will
[25:08] resent and hate that man for having to
[25:11] do it right we see that in a perfect
[25:14] expression of all these crying feminists
[25:17] on Tik Tok right now they're so upset
[25:21] because their person didn't get voted in
[25:24] and they hate men and now you know what
[25:26] they're going to do they're going to
[25:29] keep themselves
[25:30] chased they're going to protect their
[25:32] womb because men are horrible it's like
[25:35] we've been trying to tell you this for
[25:37] 2,000 years to protect your womb what
[25:40] what is it what did it take this now for
[25:42] you to realize because they they hate
[25:46] and resent men for not leading them yeah
[25:50] they hate their fathers they they hate
[25:53] the people around them because they
[25:55] refused to step up and be men and say no
[25:58] no you're doing wrong you can't act like
[26:00] this you can't live like this this isn't
[26:02] the right way and a woman is designed to
[26:05] be under
[26:11] headship so we see we see in our day
[26:14] that the modern world has glorified
[26:17] eminate men who wear skinny jeans bangs
[26:22] over their forehead like The Beetles and
[26:24] in their eyes weak sickly looking young
[26:28] men that's what the modern world is
[26:31] producing God forbid that our churches
[26:35] are producing the same thing if we are
[26:38] it is a problem not with the mothers
[26:41] it's a problem with
[26:43] fatherhood fathers are not leading their
[26:45] children and they're producing these
[26:47] Beetle looking kids with skinny
[26:50] jeans and don't tell me it's not
[26:52] happening I run I run a youth camp
[26:58] and so we have this situation where we
[27:01] we got to repent and the repentance has
[27:03] to produce some outward work in the
[27:06] lives of young
[27:09] men we see our sisters waiting till
[27:11] they're 30 years old to get married
[27:13] because there's no men around around
[27:15] there's no young men that are willing to
[27:17] be masculine and step up and actually
[27:19] lead and actually do something with
[27:22] their life and I'm I'm I'm sick of
[27:25] seeing
[27:26] that God is a lot sicker than I am of
[27:28] seeing
[27:29] it dads Step Up be men lead lead your
[27:37] family you don't need your wife's
[27:39] permission to lead your family right you
[27:43] don't ask to have to ask her can can we
[27:45] do this can we can I lead the kids this
[27:50] way you talk to God and you be willing
[27:53] to take a stand and even have your wife
[27:55] mad at you over it that's okay
[28:00] that's okay sit down don't be angry
[28:03] because she's angry don't be angry if
[28:06] she's trying to boss you sit down
[28:08] because the wrath of man works not the
[28:10] righteousness of God if she's kicking
[28:13] against the
[28:14] goats CU she doesn't want to follow the
[28:17] leadership that you're
[28:19] providing you pray first you sit down
[28:23] you pray before you talk with her and
[28:25] you say darling I love you I haven't LED
[28:30] right and I'm repenting right now we're
[28:34] not going this direction anymore I'm
[28:36] going to I'm going to lead the family
[28:38] I'm going to do it with love now if
[28:41] you've you you've not been leading
[28:43] properly she's going to have a season of
[28:47] pushing up against you because you have
[28:50] to prove yourself now right exactly
[28:52] that's okay good you must be willing to
[28:55] prove yourself and take the punches of
[28:59] anyone including your wife it's true
[29:02] very good because this is your job and
[29:05] this is your
[29:07] duty and again why don't we get rid of
[29:12] the modern world's
[29:14] entertainment that's pushing men towards
[29:17] this sissified bumbling fool that's
[29:21] protected and saved by the wisdom and
[29:23] strength of his wife this is permeating
[29:27] our culture
[29:28] culture and it is actually the opposite
[29:31] of the truth God has designed man to be
[29:35] a stronger vessel the scripture also
[29:38] shows us that a man is less easily
[29:41] deceived than a woman that might be
[29:43] offensive to to someone's sensibilities
[29:45] but that's scriptural that is why a
[29:48] woman is told not to teach or to usurp
[29:51] authority over a man because for two
[29:54] reasons one Adam was formed first so
[29:58] because of Adam being formed first he
[30:00] was designed to be the leader in the
[30:02] relationship he Not only was he Not only
[30:05] was created first he was given the
[30:07] authority to name his wife two different
[30:10] times first woman second Eve he also
[30:15] named the animals this showed his
[30:16] headship and Authority he had the power
[30:19] of naming both the animals and his own
[30:22] family right and so she was designed to
[30:26] be a helper
[30:28] she was taken out of the man she was
[30:31] made for man the man wasn't made for the
[30:34] woman so it's a man's duty to lead so
[30:39] she is more easily deceived as well
[30:42] that's another reason why she shouldn't
[30:43] teach or usurp authority over man she's
[30:46] not designed to be a leader in the home
[30:48] in the church or in Civil Society
[30:53] right right she is she is specifically
[30:56] designed to be a health ER and to a life
[30:59] be a lifegiver in fact that's what the
[31:01] very word eve means Hava means life or
[31:06] lifegiver she was to be the the beding
[31:09] grounds where the seed is planted to
[31:11] bring forth life into this world and and
[31:14] she's designed in every in every step to
[31:17] be the one that is the first one to
[31:20] nurture brother brandom calls mother The
[31:22] Fifth Gospel and she's the first one to
[31:25] really give love and security to a child
[31:30] all
[31:31] right so man so
[31:34] men are not to be bumbling fools right
[31:38] this isn't the picture that God gives us
[31:41] men are to have
[31:43] wisdom and wisdom is something that is
[31:46] not inherently given to us out of our
[31:51] sinful nature wisdom must be sought and
[31:54] pursued that's what Proverbs tells us in
[31:57] all your getting get wisdom right so
[32:02] what is wisdom wisdom is well let's put
[32:06] it this way knowledge tells us that
[32:09] tomato is a fruit wisdom tells us not to
[32:14] put it in a fruit salad
[32:23] so so you can get you can grow in
[32:27] knowledge and you can grow in wisdom and
[32:29] you say I haven't been a good teacher of
[32:31] my family that's that I'm sorry to hear
[32:34] that but that's irrelevant you can do it
[32:37] that's right I don't think I can I think
[32:39] God can help you and I think with time
[32:42] you can be very skilled at
[32:45] it it just takes applying yourself I
[32:49] promise you I I couldn't teach or speak
[32:52] like this the first time that I spoke
[32:54] I'm pretty sure no one had any idea what
[32:56] I was talking about the first time I
[32:58] spoke because I was just coming out of
[33:00] theology
[33:05] class and the Lord has helped me I think
[33:07] you could understand what I'm talking
[33:08] about I'm not sure 100%
[33:12] but but the devil has done everything he
[33:15] can to fight and to battle and to
[33:17] suppress and Destroy manhood and it's
[33:20] the time to time for us B to say enough
[33:23] I'm sick of this I'm not going to walk
[33:25] around scared of what to say I'm not
[33:27] going to run around and call people they
[33:29] them and G and all this garbage I'm
[33:32] going to speak the truth and whatever
[33:34] the consequences are I don't
[33:37] care I want to stand for God and I I I'm
[33:41] not going to be afraid of the this woke
[33:44] mind virus that's out there in the
[33:46] world the greatest thing that they want
[33:48] to do is silence the the voice of men
[33:52] put you in fear for speaking out and
[33:55] it's time to be done with that I'm I'm
[33:58] over I'm over all that garbage I'm going
[34:00] to speak out I'm going to speak plainly
[34:02] and you can put me in jail you can kill
[34:04] me you can do whatever you want to me
[34:06] but we're going to keep we're going to
[34:07] keep doing what God has called us to do
[34:11] not only not only has he assaulted Us in
[34:14] the the uh The Fifth Dimension we'll say
[34:18] the information Dimension but he's also
[34:21] assaulted us here in this Dimension with
[34:24] the F with the foods that we have you
[34:27] know you can't almost find any food that
[34:29] doesn't have some kind of plant estrogen
[34:31] in it what does estrogen do it's a it's
[34:34] a female
[34:36] feminizing plant
[34:39] phytonutrient so everything has soy in
[34:42] it what do you think that's going to do
[34:44] to men it's going to feminize them
[34:47] brother brandom says calls has this
[34:50] phrase look it up when you have a chance
[34:52] jellyfish look at all the things that he
[34:54] speaks about it what has it done this
[34:57] type of food has turned men into
[35:01] jellyfish and as society as a whole I
[35:04] think in in the 1960s 3% of people were
[35:09] obese now in today's day and age over
[35:13] 60% of Americans are
[35:16] obese it's not a mistake this is the
[35:18] devil's program to turn PE literally
[35:20] turn people into jellyfish and you can
[35:23] read what brother Bram said about it he
[35:24] prophesied it
[35:28] so we need to we need to get comfortable
[35:31] with being men whose approval do you
[35:33] need can I ask you men that that whose
[35:35] approval do you
[35:37] need
[35:40] Christ's that's that's the only person's
[35:42] approval that you need you don't need
[35:45] the government's approval you don't need
[35:47] another person's
[35:49] approval you really don't even need your
[35:51] wife's approval right we want to please
[35:54] our wives we want to make them happy but
[35:56] we have to understand if our only focus
[35:58] is our wife we're missing the fact that
[36:01] our only focus should be Christ and when
[36:04] our focus is Christ that will be sure
[36:06] that we'll take care of our wife and our
[36:08] children the right
[36:10] way so manliness starts with leadership
[36:13] and having a vision and a purpose and
[36:15] working with the audacity to fulfill the
[36:19] purpose that God has designed for you
[36:22] personally to fulfill without
[36:25] fear Without Anger
[36:28] without hatred without malice but having
[36:31] the audacity to do it no matter what
[36:34] anyone else says to
[36:36] you Ephesians 5:23 says for the husband
[36:39] is the head of the wife even as Christ
[36:43] is the head of the church and he is the
[36:45] savior of the body this speaks of
[36:48] leadership this speaks of decision
[36:51] making again I don't think we'll get
[36:53] that far in in my notes but
[36:57] modern our modern uh denominational
[37:00] Christianity's idea of headship is
[37:03] little more than
[37:04] just word service word service lip
[37:09] service but the biblical version of
[37:11] headship if you look uh into I believe
[37:14] it's numbers 30 and it speaks clearly
[37:17] that a father and a husband can
[37:20] invalidate any decision that his wife or
[37:23] daughter makes and so when we speak of
[37:27] ship we speak of a deciding
[37:30] factor husband is to be the deciding
[37:33] factor in the home and again that might
[37:37] put some women into a
[37:39] panic maybe that's Justified maybe
[37:42] that's not justified but either way as
[37:44] men we should be leading in such a way
[37:47] that our wife hears this and
[37:50] says thank God I never wanted to be the
[37:53] one making the decisions
[37:56] anyways and that she's so comfortable
[37:58] with the fact that you're her leader
[38:00] that it is a reason to be
[38:04] thankful all right let's find out what
[38:06] God's purpose is for us Genesis 1:26
[38:10] through
[38:11] 2828 and God said let us make man in our
[38:13] image after our likeness and let them
[38:16] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[38:18] and over the fowl of the air and over
[38:20] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[38:21] over every creeping thing that creeps
[38:23] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[38:26] own image in the image of God created he
[38:29] him male and female created he them and
[38:32] God blessed them and God said unto them
[38:33] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[38:36] the Earth and subdue it and have
[38:38] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[38:40] over the foul of the air and over every
[38:42] living thing that moves upon the Earth
[38:44] so he designed man to be to have
[38:48] dominion and to
[38:51] multiply so man on his own is the
[38:53] stronger vessel he might have the
[38:54] ability to take Dominion on his own
[38:58] but I'm pretty sure he cannot multiply
[39:00] on his own and so that's when we go into
[39:02] Genesis 2 and we see man is God plays
[39:05] out this great drama man is alone he
[39:07] says I'll make him and help me then he
[39:09] brings the animals in front of him shows
[39:11] them male and female he names all the
[39:13] animals and he and he tells us that it's
[39:16] not good for man to be alone so out of
[39:19] all of this creation everything is good
[39:20] except for one thing and it's not that
[39:23] the man isn't
[39:24] good the man is good but it's not good
[39:28] for the man to be alone right and so
[39:32] what does God do he performs a surgery
[39:34] puts him to sleep performs a surgery and
[39:37] from the man creates a woman and she is
[39:41] to be a help meet him or a a help that
[39:44] is helper that is suitable to him so
[39:48] whatever the man's vision and purpose in
[39:51] life that means his wife is to enter
[39:53] into that same purpose and vision and be
[39:57] his helper within that purpose and
[40:00] vision so we see right there that this
[40:03] whole modern idea of dual income and
[40:07] careerism is of the devil it's not of
[40:11] God it's not a scriptural approach to
[40:14] life the family is to operate as a unit
[40:18] husbands are to provide wives are to be
[40:20] a helper in this
[40:23] process Genesis 2:15 and the Lord God
[40:26] took the man and put him into the Garden
[40:29] of Eden to dress it and to keep it the
[40:32] word dress is the word Abad and it means
[40:35] to work or to serve or to work for
[40:38] another or to serve another by labor so
[40:42] it's really looking at the man was
[40:43] designed to work and again this is not
[40:47] after the fall this is before the fall
[40:49] in the very definition of him creating a
[40:51] man I put you here to work and then the
[40:55] other part it says and keep it the other
[40:57] part is Shamar and that means to to
[41:00] hedge about to guard to protect so
[41:03] there's two functions that every man is
[41:05] supposed to provide on Earth and that
[41:08] they are supposed to work and they're
[41:10] supposed to be guardians or
[41:12] protectors so if you wonder young men
[41:15] what is your what is God's vision for
[41:17] your life work and
[41:20] protect for a family this isn't just a
[41:24] just you yourself but the garden
[41:28] so to speak is not just a physical
[41:31] destination but it's a
[41:36] family Proverbs 22:6 says train up a
[41:39] child in the way he should go and when
[41:40] he is old he will not depart in it in
[41:43] our modern sensibility we take this
[41:45] verse to mean only in spiritual
[41:49] things but it's very clear that the the
[41:52] training that a child is supposed to
[41:54] have is supposed to be from in within
[41:57] the context of the family within the
[41:59] context of the home it's not just a
[42:02] spiritual training it's also a natural
[42:05] training for the things of this life
[42:08] show them how they're supposed to live
[42:10] and function in the
[42:12] world and again as I said before we
[42:14] train Sons for one duty and we train
[42:17] daughters for another Duty different
[42:20] functions within the same uh sphere of
[42:24] Home Genesis 18:17 through 19 the Lord
[42:28] said shall I hide from Abraham that
[42:30] thing which I do seeing that Abraham
[42:32] shall surely become a great and mighty
[42:34] nation and all the nations of Earth
[42:36] shall be blessed in him for I know him
[42:39] that he will command his children and
[42:41] his household after him and they shall
[42:43] keep the way of the Lord to do justice
[42:45] and judgment that the Lord may bring
[42:47] upon Abraham that which he has spoken of
[42:50] him this always amazes me because God
[42:52] says I'm going to reveal my secret
[42:55] Mysteries to Abraham because I know that
[42:58] he is a man that is going to teach his
[43:00] family after him so maybe sometimes if
[43:04] we're we're lacking in spiritual
[43:06] Revelation in our own lives it's because
[43:08] a of a lack of our teaching and
[43:10] instructing our own
[43:12] families and so teaching and instruction
[43:14] must start with a
[43:16] patriarch not Abraham you
[43:20] brother that's that is what you're
[43:22] called to be patriarch simply means the
[43:25] rule of fathers
[43:27] this is God's
[43:28] design wh the the feminist movement says
[43:31] we're going to fight and throw off the
[43:34] patriarchy well good
[43:36] luck the only patriarch patriarchy that
[43:39] a woman can throw off is a weak
[43:43] one you either have a bad patriarchy or
[43:46] a good one we happen to live in America
[43:48] and have a bad patriarchy perverted
[43:51] patriarchy that's surrendered much of
[43:54] its leadership to a woman yep
[43:57] and it's it's a mistake that we've made
[44:00] but we don't have to make that in our
[44:01] own
[44:03] homes all
[44:06] right so brother brandham tells us in U
[44:10] invisible
[44:11] Union that a woman is given three sacred
[44:16] trusts and as I look at this I realize
[44:19] that the woman is given these three
[44:22] sacred trusts because they're direct
[44:24] directly
[44:25] tied to what what her Duty and function
[44:29] is supposed to be in
[44:31] life so first one brother brandom says
[44:35] now notice now we find that her body is
[44:37] the bedding ground and therefore it's a
[44:40] sacred trust not to defile
[44:43] it he also says she has a sacred Trust
[44:46] of virtue committed to her by her Lord a
[44:49] certain virtue nothing else holds it but
[44:51] a woman right that's committed to her by
[44:53] God she must def not defile that virtue
[44:57] and third he says now we find out she
[44:59] has been given this sacred trust that
[45:01] she must not break of Womanhood act have
[45:04] her character raise her children be
[45:06] honorable to her husband so again three
[45:09] three sacred trusts
[45:10] body virtue and Womanhood so keep your
[45:16] body
[45:17] pure amen keep keep it
[45:20] pure second is virtue it's it's it means
[45:24] strength it means your ability to say
[45:26] yes or no
[45:29] and then Womanhood that's the character
[45:30] and conduct that she has towards her
[45:34] family and so looking
[45:39] at looking at her uh her Duty that's
[45:45] committed to her from the very beginning
[45:47] we see this is all
[45:49] surrounding the family this is all
[45:51] surrounding the home this is all
[45:54] surrounding motherhood and this is is
[45:57] God's design right again we live in a
[45:59] world and in a society that
[46:02] devalues true Godly Womanhood and
[46:06] motherhood and Al almost makes fun of it
[46:10] but the fact is I'm going to spend the
[46:12] rest of my life making fun of feminism
[46:15] because it's not making women
[46:18] happier it's not bringing joy to to
[46:21] Womanhood it's not making homes
[46:24] happier it's it's glorifying in this Al
[46:28] this aloneness this separateness just
[46:31] just think think of how horrible it is
[46:35] short-sighted a woman grows up and goes
[46:38] to a public school and a university and
[46:40] has no father teaching her any truth has
[46:43] no mother teaching her any truth and she
[46:46] thinks the greatest thing I can do is go
[46:48] work in some men's office doing
[46:51] spreadsheets that's the greatest
[46:53] function I can have and really what I
[46:55] want to do is I want to work on some
[46:56] man's spreadsheets and I want to have a
[47:01] cat and maybe a few cats and maybe more
[47:05] cats
[47:06] and suddenly she's 65 and she's the
[47:09] crazy cat lady next door my goodness
[47:13] sisters aren't you so sad that you
[47:15] couldn't have such a life that you're
[47:17] missing all that
[47:22] freedom
[47:23] well the reality is this isn't joyful
[47:27] this
[47:28] isn't beautiful this is not a simple or
[47:32] easy life in that
[47:34] context God has called us to something
[47:38] different all of us want to be happy but
[47:42] because of our sinful nature what do we
[47:44] do we chase a instead of chasing after
[47:47] what will actually make us happy we
[47:48] chase after the thing
[47:50] itself and what do we find when we chase
[47:53] after the thing itself we could have
[47:55] just read Solomon and looked at the Book
[47:57] of Ecclesiastes and find that seeking it
[48:01] that way through the things of the world
[48:04] is what vanity of
[48:07] vanities all is Vanity sayith the
[48:10] preacher what does it mean it's
[48:12] meaningless it's
[48:15] purposeless it's not a it's not a a a
[48:18] it's not going to bring happiness what
[48:21] does bring what
[48:22] brings
[48:24] happiness Finding what are function and
[48:27] design is and fulfilling that under the
[48:31] authority that God has designed when we
[48:34] can when we fully surrender ourselves to
[48:37] the
[48:37] Lord and we find what our calling is
[48:41] what our purpose is it doesn't mean
[48:43] there's not a lot of times where you're
[48:44] not
[48:45] happy again happiness is not the end
[48:48] goal right Joy Joy
[48:53] from finding the true meaning in our
[48:56] life right what what does he say this is
[49:00] the chief end of man to obey God and to
[49:06] keep his Commandments right so really
[49:10] when when it says that the chief chief
[49:11] end or chief purpose something like that
[49:14] in
[49:15] Ecclesiastes what is he saying he's he's
[49:17] saying this is the function this is the
[49:19] purpose that man was created for and
[49:22] when we when we find that purpose and
[49:25] pursue that purpose that is the place
[49:27] where real Joy comes from that doesn't
[49:31] mean we're always happy happiness is
[49:34] something that is not a prize that we
[49:37] should try to grasp and retain we
[49:40] because we live in a fallen world
[49:42] there's always suffering and the fact is
[49:44] without suffering we can never grow in
[49:46] maturity we can never grow in in wisdom
[49:49] and so uh a joyful life necessitates
[49:53] suffering yes it's true very and so
[49:57] when we're when we're pursuing meaning
[50:00] which really is pursuing Christ within
[50:03] the context of our own lives as Fathers
[50:07] as husbands as wives as mothers when
[50:11] we're pursuing Christ in that that's the
[50:14] place where we find a satisfaction in
[50:16] our
[50:18] heart you know I as I get older I think
[50:23] I get I hope I get a little wiser and I
[50:26] see
[50:27] one of the most precious things is
[50:30] sitting and conversing with my own
[50:32] children my own flesh and blood as they
[50:34] get older talking about the things of
[50:36] God making jokes
[50:39] laughing just enjoying a hike out in the
[50:43] woods or sitting together by the coast
[50:48] these things where we're really Christ
[50:50] is at the center of our lives and we're
[50:54] enjoying our our one another
[50:57] this is where meaning is you know
[51:01] I've you go through lots of hard things
[51:04] and you have teenagers this these hard
[51:08] things increase but in at the same time
[51:11] out of it sometimes the are the out of
[51:14] the greatest suffering the the greatest
[51:17] joy
[51:18] comes and you know you go through those
[51:21] times and you think is my f family going
[51:24] to come to Faith are they going to
[51:25] really you know take hold and then you
[51:28] find out things are happening and you
[51:31] think oh my
[51:33] goodness All Is Lost but then you then
[51:36] you draw it causes you to draw closer to
[51:38] the Lord and then you draw closer to the
[51:41] Lord and Dig Down Deeper and say Satan
[51:43] you're not taking my family you're not
[51:45] taking my children I'm claiming them and
[51:48] I'm not only just claiming them but I'm
[51:50] going and running after them and
[51:52] pursuing them with the strength of the
[51:55] Lord and you see out of that God brings
[51:58] Deliverance God God brings healing God
[52:01] brings them the baptism of the Holy
[52:03] Ghost and sets their heart on
[52:05] fire I don't know about you I don't find
[52:08] any Greater Joy than this isn't that
[52:11] what the Apostle said I find No Greater
[52:14] Joy than seeing my children walk in the
[52:18] truth musicians if you'd
[52:22] come and I you know you can you can
[52:26] preach this and and paint a very uh hard
[52:30] picture and this world is dark and evil
[52:34] and it
[52:36] is and you see this Spirit of
[52:39] feminism that's that's trying to destroy
[52:45] the world destroy the church even to
[52:48] destroy the bride if it
[52:50] could but then you then you come to
[52:52] really seek the seek the scriptures and
[52:55] there's many you know I didn't even get
[52:57] to 10% of my
[52:59] notes but you can go through and just
[53:02] just do a search in the message about uh
[53:06] a woman kitchen just read that woman's
[53:09] places in the kitchen yes it's a very
[53:12] offensive thing to say in
[53:14] 2024 but look at what brother brandham
[53:16] says just read it yourself and you'll
[53:18] see that that you know that's a woman's
[53:21] place of course we're talking about the
[53:23] home it's not just she doesn't have to
[53:24] set up her bed in the kitchen
[53:28] it's in the home it's that's where God
[53:30] has
[53:32] designed that's a woman's sphere
[53:36] and you know as a 47y old
[53:40] man every time I say this I begin to
[53:44] tear up because the two most precious
[53:47] people in the world that I can think of
[53:49] are my wife and my mom my mom's gone
[53:51] onto Glory but she raised me to love the
[53:55] word of God yes and she prayed me into
[54:00] the kingdom when I was struggling and my
[54:04] wife his brother bandam she stands
[54:06] between me and the public as he said
[54:08] about his wife and you know she's got to
[54:11] put up with a lot for a traveling
[54:14] Minister you know I'm I'm
[54:16] gone last week get back Monday night
[54:21] start preparing to leave Friday I get
[54:24] home on Monday afternoon out Tuesday
[54:28] morning and this is the this she has she
[54:32] has to have faith that God is leading
[54:35] her husband in a lot of ways I would say
[54:38] our dear sisters have to have more faith
[54:41] than men because they've got to submit
[54:43] to the leadership of a fallen
[54:48] dude that's doing everything he can to
[54:50] follow Christ with all his heart and so
[54:53] my wife is the most precious thing to be
[54:56] in the world and the fact that she stays
[54:58] at home and she homeschools the kids and
[55:01] she takes care of my girls how could I
[55:03] not want to do everything I can to stand
[55:06] for her and to protect her and honor her
[55:09] with my whole life and so you know we
[55:13] thank God for mothers this wasn't a
[55:14] Mother's Day message but I think instead
[55:18] of making it just once a year Mother's
[55:20] Day should be every day right
[55:23] kids amen honor honor the women in your
[55:27] lives because when they really when you
[55:31] when together let's put it that way when
[55:33] together we can really enter into the
[55:35] place that called us God called us to be
[55:38] that's where we really can find joy and
[55:41] meaning and rejoicing within the context
[55:44] of our families CU really that's that's
[55:46] the main place that we're
[55:48] at I believe that's the place the that's
[55:50] the context where kids are raised in the
[55:53] atmosphere and that's going to that's
[55:55] that's the direction that they're going
[55:57] to be sent some kids might stray but I
[56:01] the word says if we train them up in the
[56:03] way they should go they'll not depart
[56:04] from it
[56:06] that make sure men let's make sure our
[56:09] homes are in line with God's word and
[56:12] that we're being true and genuine
[56:14] Patriarchs yes leading our families and
[56:17] benefactors of our families I think I
[56:20] think uh I'll just comment on it because
[56:22] it it goes It goes with this and it's
[56:25] important to say is
[56:26] this idea of this
[56:29] Macho uh uh
[56:32] rude tough guy that's always sort of
[56:36] harsh with his family that's not
[56:40] manliness that's that's a sissified
[56:42] thing a man that would just use his wife
[56:45] and use his family and discard them he
[56:49] he's
[56:50] a ultimately he's a broken and uh
[56:54] bruised man that would
[56:56] act and behave that way you know I've
[56:59] seen I've seen different comments from
[57:02] different people man I come I came home
[57:04] my wife and my kids were arguing they
[57:06] wanted me to solve it I I just went and
[57:08] got a hotel forget
[57:10] them oh that's a real expression of
[57:12] masculinity right no that's a man's job
[57:17] to come home and say all right what's
[57:19] going on everybody sit down let's calm
[57:21] down and let's pray about this let's
[57:24] talk about this that that's that's a a
[57:27] real man understands that he his duty is
[57:31] a provider and I'll put it this way as a
[57:33] benefactor of his family not just saying
[57:37] here's the money here's the groceries
[57:40] here's the clothes but looking at it as
[57:42] I know the hearts of my children I know
[57:45] the need that they have maybe this one's
[57:47] lacking in confidence so I got to do
[57:50] something specifically for this child to
[57:53] help increase their confidence help
[57:55] increase their faith or this one is
[57:57] lacking because they're fearful so now
[58:00] we got to sit down and and address that
[58:01] and do things that address the
[58:04] fear you know that that as men we have
[58:08] to see that and be the benefactor of our
[58:12] wife and of our
[58:14] children not just taking our wife out to
[58:16] on a date every once in a while this
[58:18] whole mentality but really understanding
[58:20] what's going on in our home what
[58:23] specifically the needs are within the
[58:26] context of our family and meeting them
[58:27] that's what a provider is it's not just
[58:30] a paycheck right amen any male or female
[58:35] for that matter or teenager right can do
[58:39] these things that's not true Godly
[58:42] manhood but it's understanding the
[58:46] needs and actually if you understand a
[58:48] provider means Vision beforehand so in
[58:51] other words you actually understand the
[58:53] need before it happens and you do
[58:56] something to meet it Jehovah Gyra before
[59:01] Abraham even looked he turned there it
[59:03] was already provided for
[59:05] him and God calls every man to be that
[59:09] it's a pretty that's intimidating for me
[59:13] know the need beforehand I'm struggling
[59:15] just to know it when it's when it's
[59:18] happening but God is calling that's the
[59:20] kind of prayer life that's the kind of
[59:22] walk with the Lord that we need to have
[59:24] that we actually see the need beforehand
[59:27] and go to meet it before it even gets
[59:31] there amen let's let's stand let's pray
