TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Revelations CH 21 veres 1 to7 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God this is we'll come to it here in a little bit it's a very uh I found it to be a very peculiar not peculiar maybe but very outstanding reading comparing it to what God was accomplishing in the beginning and even God's relationship to humanity and Mankind throughout the years but now something has uh something has climaxed something has culminated and we'll just uh verse four and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that over cometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son amen you may be seated what thrilling uh scripture reading uh and then me kind of knowing which way I which direction I'm headed and hopefully we get it just is even more thrilling uh to look at that we're continuing on the subject of God created it's an outflow of Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created and I'm wanting to just going to take time uh this morning really to recapture where we had stopped last time in the uh in the area of subdue how this commandment this commission was given but I just want to background a few things from the last couple services at the outset so that we can have um some context for this and the first few chapters of the Bible we've been looking at maybe the first three The more I've pondered it the more I just want to start saying the first four the first five uh maybe even get all the way up to Genesis CH 12 when we introduce Abram uh those first several chapters just setting up God's plan and story of redemption but these first few chapters of the Bible lay a foundation for understanding really what is the mystery of God uh because God an unknown being an unknown entity uh is making himself known through scripture and so as things unfold we see things that God does and things that God says so there's something that's being declared but yet there's still kind of a mystery uh to what he is doing and what he's trying to accomplish and so when we look at creation brother brandom used this phrase we see what he is in his program The Creator is letting himself be known what he is in his program and we've been specifically over the last couple Services looking at how this is a story of redemption and the story of redemption begins in Genesis but not where we might think it begins we think oh the moment that Eve fell that's when the story of redemption begins but the story of redemption begins with in the beginning God created that's where the story of redemption begins and so we're looking at the story of redemption and how that even within this story of redemption those things can be very plain and they're described in a particular way there's a mystery that's hid within it and so this is uh as you begin to read the Bible we cannot read it just as a history but it's God telling his story so it is his story but not history it is God telling something about himself it's divine love being portrayed Divine love being expressed and we we taking taking time just to point out how everything that God was doing and this is a very I would even it just be admit to you it's even a fresher Revelation to me than it's ever been because you take Genesis and you think this is perfection the Perfection Perfection everything that God's trying to achieve everything God's trying to accomplish it's all perfect it's in its Radiance it's in its Glory and then when man falls Redemption begins but it goes back even before that this is redemption because everything that God created everything that he fashioned everything that was formed by God he did it with redemption in mind so what we see unfold in Genesis is not the accident of sin this is not an accident because brother brandham tells us very plainly in that church age book when Satan did that which was necessary to bring about the purpose of God so God allowed things to be into place to be in a particular position so that Satan would act of his own will and in doing so set certain things in motion so that the story of redemption could be told so it's no accident of sin and we've been emphasizing this that God's purpose could not have been revealed without Redemption if we had all stepped forth fresh from God then there would have been no doubt a perfect existence but the paradoxes we wouldn't have perfectly known God there still would have been something about God that would have been missing or lacking so if there was only one Eden what would God mean to us if there was never any sorrow what what what would be uh what that that think about how God's desire to be a comforter if there's no there's no sorrow then God's desire and need to be a comforter is imprisoned if there's no sickness then God's attribute of being a Healer is imprisoned it's in bondage so there's things that had to happen for God to be able to express himself so if we had only known one Eden then what would God be to us he would be God and we would worship him just as Angels would worship him but he wouldn't be known to the his people as he desired to make himself known now if you look at Genesis CH 1 ver 28 and that that backgrounds we're still going to be backgrounding some things but this is I really want this to become the main Cog that we uh press forward from because we're looking at God created now as we as we look at this uh Genesis 1:28 I want you to realize this is God speaking now to the so the totality of his creation and so this is what God created this is the desire he had for his creation this is how he begins to arrange in these few verses here if we took more than verse 28 we'll find that God's arranging creation to one another and among one another and now God speaking to the man with the woman inside of him and God blessed them the blessing confers power and God blessed them what he says unto them is the blessing it's not like the pope doing a little thing with his hand or you or some kind of something being sprinkled on somebody it says and God blessed them what he's about to say is the blessing it confers power it conveys ability and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth this is God's blessing on what he he has created in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth then we come to verse 28 and this is God even before he sums it up in the beginning of Genesis chapter 2 he's saying this is my creation this is the sum of it I'm blessing man who's the Pinnacle of this and now he's going to have a particular Arrangement over everything that I've created now this blessing and this commandment is left unfulfilled and we're we've been mentioning that several times and we're going to continue to emphasize that this morning because the principles of redemption or if I could say the mystery of redemption would not allow Genesis 1 128 to be fulfilled without suffering now we can look back and say that's just exactly how it happened that this could not have been fulfilled and was not fulfilled until first sorrow and death entered into Humanity but I want to emphasize it that it could not have been fulfilled unless first there was some Interruption within this Perfection some Interruption within this harmony that was in the garden because every everything that is meant by Genesis 128 it was not something that God wanted man just to easily grasp that for man just to be able to fulfill all these things and do all these things there was something that had to take place to put man in a character to be able to fully fulfill Genesis 128 and so when man fa the power of Genesis 128 the commission or blessing of Genesis 128 is taken away from Mankind and we could say that was even sealed from him and brother B talks about how those great Powers lay dormant and these things that he had this ability to do he can no longer access them whatever means by which he could not access them whatever means by which he no longer was they were no longer available to him to use God seals man off from the blessing the power and the potential of Genesis 1 128 but this is part of God's predestinated plan called Redemption it's not that this is an accident all of a sudden but it's part of God's plan and it was necessary for God's purpose and so brother BR makes this statement in the message Oneness when Adam and Eve listened to the LIE of the devil this is a very heavy statement to me I can still remember the first time I ever heard it says the holy image of God left them so man's made in the image of God he's made in the likeness of God though he retains particular a particular likeness and a particular image of God after the fall there's the whole holy a holy image that leaves man as soon as he listens to the LIE of the devil and hold that deep within your heart that man lost something the moment he believed a lie and it says and their Fellowship was broken with God he describes it this way their Fellowship of Oneness with God was broken the very minute they listened to the LIE of the devil that broke their Fellowship so now think of the totality of this very short statement and if you listen to the message Oneness brother brandham really emphasizes the theme uh quite a bit in there Adam's Oneness and the Oneness of man and that's God's desire is is to have Oneness with his creation not just to have a creation but to experience Oneness and a to Total Union with his creation it says the holy image of God leaves Adam and the woman the very moment they listen to the LIE of the devil so man loses that that godlikeness some God quality some Divine deity that was that he had some of fellowship with that he had communion with that he had access to that leaves man and it says that breaks their Fellowship he calls it the fellowship of Oneness so man is no longer one with God he may still be like God and he may still uh be in an image of God but this holy image leaves him something about the divine power something about the Divine intent and Notions have left man and he's no longer one with God now he can call upon God he can feel his presence and God could even still communicate with man but something is lost in man's relationship with God through the fall so many different statements I'd like to read and I want I'm going to read several of them but brother B says God in harmony with his creature and the creature in harmony with his maker that's the way it was in the beginning God was in harmony with his creature and the creature was in harmony with his maker that's how man was at the start but as soon as he listens to the LIE of the devil it's disharmony right so now there is no longer Perfect Harmony between God and the creature nor can the creature have perfect harmony with his maker this is interrupted and when the harmony is gone the Oneness is gone when the harmony is gone the holy image cannot be expressed there's something that distorts or perverts that likeness or we could even put it in a way that might even be better for us to understand as soon as there was a breach within the character of man he's no longer fit just to grab a hold of the power of God and use it like he would want to that's right and brother Bram is the holy image of God leaves Adam and the woman their Fellowship of Oneness think of that Fellowship of Oneness and the holy image keep those two ideas in mind the holy image of God departs from the creature The Fellowship of Oneness with God is broken and then brother BR says our health our strength our eternal spirit was lost in Adam so here's things that were lost when Adam fell our health our strength and our eternal Spirit was lost in Adam so there's something that's removed from man and man is separated from and it would have been a very eerie very odd feeling and that's when you find in Genesis 3 when man sinned all sudden fear entered enters in for the first time because he only knew Fellowship of Oneness he only knew the holy image of God as long as he had the holy image fear couldn't get in as long as he had this Fellowship of Oneness with God if there was no fear around him at all soon as that leaves the first emotion he experiences is fear so our our health our strength our eternal spirit was lost in Adam yeah now in Genesis 2:7 and I know it may seem to be uh it might seem just to be kind of very applauding course that we're doing today uh but I I believe that it's going to be a blessing to you as we are able to go hopefully deep into this in Genesis chapter 2:7 it says and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul when Man became a living Soul he now gives him Affinity to the animals all living creatures upon the Earth because it's the same phrase used for living creature of those that creep creep upon the Earth the fowl the fish those things man now has an affinity by having the Breath of Life man becomes a living Soul he becomes a Kinsman now even to Creation but then it also says that God formed him from the dust of the ground so now he's given a physical body now to put this in context of Genesis chapter 1 the blessing Genesis 1 128 had two parts there is a commission related to him as a man or mankind as this as as Adam and the woman that would come from him they are told and commanded to be fruitful and multiply so they're to become many they're to have progeny they're to have those after them so this commission related specifically to them as a as an entity as a being as even as a spirit but the second part of the blessing or this commandment was a commission related to their power over all things in the earth and also all things from the earth as they are told to have dominion over the fish of the sea over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth this is a commission related to their power over all living things everything that had life anything that was growing anything that was breathing walking moving anything God had created really we could just say anything God created they're power and dominion over it but then they're also given a commandment to replenish and subdue the Earth so now they're given a power over all things from the earth and when it says man is formed from the dust of the ground this flesh body that God gives man it connects Adam to the power to replenish and subdue the Earth because where did the body come from thank you we'll just turn this over and we'll preach to Brother John the body came from the earth so man is formed from the dust of the ground he's formed from the earth and now this flesh body that Adam is placed within connects him to the power to replenish the Earth and subdue the Earth so now the body becomes a part of the blessing the blessing is be fruitful multiply well there's a it's conceivable that he could have multiplied spiritually it could have been other Spiritual Beings just like Adam in the image of God in the likeness of God supernatural beings without flesh but when God forms man from the dust of the ground he's connecting everything together man becomes Kinsman to the Earth man has a body like um like these other animal bodies and brother man talks about he has a hand like a bear and you describe them in all these different ways where man has some Affinity to Creation but now also man has a direct connection to the Earth it's not just a supernatural being spiritual being but now the very body that he inhabits man is formed from the dust to the ground and now man has power has has a connection with the Earth that he is told to replenish and to subdue and so now the body becomes part of that blessing brother Bron makes this statement and and if it doesn't seem like these are connecting I think there'll be a point where maybe we'll just put the grout over all of it and it'll seem like it connects but brother says Adam lost the rights of that book so when he fell when he lost his harmony with his maker and our health our strength our eternal Spirit was lost in Adam he lost rights to that book what was that book the book of redemption the title deed to Heaven and Earth the power and control over everything he lost that so man lost when he says he lost his rights to that book man lost his full rights to the Earth and all of creation he would have had a he would have had a dominion and control by the word of God not by his own volition his own savviness and he's smart SM than the serpent and he's smarter than all the Beast and he can trick them by divine power God had conferred into Adam the ability to control all things but as soon as he fell he lost his full rights to the Earth he lost his full power over all of creation and let me say this including his body his brother says our eternal spirit was lost in Adam this this the ability any ability this body may have had to live forever and not die he loses that at the fall now there's a peculiar scripture in Jude n there's no chapters to Jude you could say Jude chapter 1 ver9 but there's just since there's no chapters to it it's Jude verse 9 speaks this and it's a very peculiar scripture within uh theological circles and christiandom and they try to find the origins of it and there was different ancient books the Assumption of Moses and different things that they feel that may be Jude is drawing from but it says Yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses dur not bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee so Jude in context is talking about how um you would Wrangle with the adversary the things that you had said or the the things that you would say uh the things that people even say of dignities and things that are holy and and he's said man you you shouldn't say certain things he says even Michael when he was arguing with uh uh the devil just said the Lord rebuke theee but in in this context notice what he says that Michael is contending with the devil over the body of Moses now why would there be an argument with Satan over the body of Moses because of the Fall Satan would have asserted a right to Moses's body and so Satan and Michael and the Archangel are arguing over the body of Moses because be when man fell man lost his first claim to the Earth he could no longer this body coming from the earth he couldn't just assert his right with the title deed says no see this body I own it so that when this body now when he loses that title deed then an accusation could be brought if you don't have the deed to your house if you don't have a lease or a deed you don't have something that proves you own it then have fun argueing it right say well I I live here okay you live there but do you own it and I would I would argue that possession is nine10 of the law and if you're living there you got pretty solid footing at least for some period of time but the argument who owns it who who has a right to it so Satan asserts his right to the body of Moses because when man fell he doesn't even have clear title to his own body I ponder that Ponder how significant this is now when man dies he loses this power to his own body so that when Moses dies God hides the body of Moses as we read from the message and and even understanding from scripture whether it would be to keep Israel from being tempted to idolatry brother Bram using it using it in a beautiful sense that this is now Moses being resurrected as it were being preserved we see him again on Mount Transfiguration but Satan asserts his right to the body because it came from the earth and man has lost his rights to the Earth the power he had to replenish to subdue the blessing of Genesis 1: 128 withdrawn from man so now there's an argument over even the body in the breach brother bam says Adam lost his inheritance the Earth that was his part of his inheritance The Inheritance it was gr granted to him in Genesis 1:28 it was God's to begin with correct then God creates this this is God's Legacy and he leaves it with man he says it's yours that was his inheritance he inherited it from God he says now so Adam lost his inheritance the Earth and remember man is formed not just as a supernatural being from God in the image and likeness of God but he's also brought up from the earth so see the two meet together the Divine deity Supernatural Heaven coming now together with Earth and man is formed together so man comes from the earth and he loses his inheritance the Earth but says now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan the Earth is now passed he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasonings therefore his eternal life you following me so far his eternal life his right to the tree of life These are things he lost his right to the Earth belonged to him I'm wanting you to understand this connection that God had given man to the Earth his right to the Earth belonged to him and he forfeited it every bit to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hand to Satan it returned and has been polluted and the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had that's the Earth so when Adam fell he forfeits the Earth to Satan now what he does not forfeit is the title deed he's forfeiting possession Satan's a squatter Satan has moved in on a on a vacant piece of a vacant house and he's he's there uh uh not even under the color of title necessarily he's just there and he's invaded the Earth and he's possessing it and he's manipulating he's abusing it and he's abusing man that's come from the earth and that's because Adam when he fell he now forfeits his rights to the Earth and now Satan comes and begins to assume control over it just using maybe summary language in doing so but the title deed the power Genesis 1: 120 the blessing that doesn't go to Satan anybody believe that did not go to Satan the title deed went back to the hands of the original owner so the title deed the power the book of redemption that sealed book however you want to describe it that goes back to the hands of God but now that book being absent from creation puts the whole world into chaos and into a power struggle because man man can't just sit there and say no stop you can't do that and have all power of Heaven behind him now there's there's fightings there's Wars there's going to be murders and killings and there's going to be es and flows and there's going to be seasons of Triumph and righteousness in Israel but then SE seasons of depravity and the whole world is chaotic and turned upside down why man lost his inheritance and this whole inheritance actually comes into the power of Satan what is Satan called in scripture Prince of the power of the air he's called the spirit there's a spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience he's called the God of this evil age brother bam describes all of creation now as Satan's Eden now he doesn't have the power he doesn't have Genesis 1:28 he doesn't have full total control as a Divine entity or in the same way that Adam would have had it in the beginning but the Earth which one time belonged to Adam it is now forfeited into the hands of Satan right now in the message fundamental foundation for Faith and this is another sermon that you can go back and listen to and you'll find brother bham touching on some of these points that we're making even in these last few Services brother BR says man in the fall has lost his conscience of what father put him here on Earth to do do this is one of those one of these outstanding statements to me this morning as we go through this when man fell he lost his conscience of what father put him here on Earth to do could you just remember that just take that first sentence there and think about that that what brother bandam is saying is that when man fa he's no longer aware in fully understanding what he was put on Earth to do he's still gonna eat still gonna have kids still going to build and and and propagate and there's going to be a lot of things that happen but he's he forgot what he was put on Earth to do though he may be accomplishing things and though there is a um a history that unfolds and man procreates and man builds and man controls the Earth and he does all sorts of things to Creation but he forgets what he was put on Earth to do he has forgotten Genesis 1 128 because this is the only place that you find where God gives him something specifically to do now you you could look at the prohibitions of partaking of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and you could look at how he was given certain things to eat but when it comes to what you to do your marching orders your duty Adam it's Genesis 1 128 when he falls he loses his consciousness of what his commission is brother says in other words all the plumbing as it was in our brain and that's sometimes how we feel about our brain it's just a bunch of plumbing and the outlets the faith has been clogged up with business affair with home life domestic things it's it's all become so clogged up with that until God can't operate through those channels that he made a man for so man was made for God to operate through man and the fall essentially blocks God off from being able to operate through our channels there's no Clear Channel or clear Consciousness that I am a Divine representative upon Earth I am Divine I am deity I am God upon Earth I have been given a a commandment to be fruitful multiply replenish and subdue the earth I have dominion over every living thing on the earth I have all power over Heaven and Earth I'm here as a Divine entity I'm here in the stad of God I have this Divine character I have the mind of Christ I can operate and then God has this Oneness the holy image of God is in flesh the fellowship Oneness between God and His creation and now you just have deity being expressed as soon as man falls it it vacates him and he does even know what he's called to do he can say those things but the harmony is not there the Oneness isn't there the connection isn't there and brother bandam continues this is so beautiful when God made the human body every little part had its place to play so the body had a purpose to it he says the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make the man to live and he continues and says if he gave that much thought to your body how much more the body of Christ and that's the point Point that he's trying to make because that's ultimately what God's Acom going to accomplish but what God put man here on Earth to do man lost his conscience his channels become clogged there's no free flow of the Divine into the nature of man and the human body which was to have everything the teeth the eyes the tongue the nose was to have a place to play God put it there to be in perfect operation for that man to live within creation Now something is lost Harmony and unity is lost and because of this man is no longer capable of fulfilling the commission of Genesis 1 128 man can't do it man's still upon Earth the commission seemingly is lingering there but because man can no longer fulfill the commission of Genesis 1 128 God has to recommission him so in Genesis chter 9: 1-7 Genesis 9: 1-7 it says and God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them now this is from it's from these three sons that we know the whole earth is populated by one blood God has made the whole earth uh to be filled up with Humanity it's coming from this blood that comes forth from the ark and so now this is all of humanity all of creation starting a new as it were After the flood we could call it a a a new world even though I think you could refer to the world that's was destroyed as the new world and now this is a a subsequent world and God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them notice the how similar this sounds be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth upon every foul of the air upon all that moveth upon the Earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hands are they delivered now it may sound the same but it's very different man is told to have dominion over the fish over the foul and over living every living thing that moves upon the earth now there's just a dread upon every living thing so it's not it's not a continuity of subjection in harmony between the man and creation or man and creature but now there's a dread there's a fear there's something that has interrupted the initial Harmony the man and the lion could have walked together the tiger and the bear would have all had this harmony but now this is all going to be up set but God is going to say now there's going to be the dread of you upon the animal life every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you this is different than what was said before even as the green herb have I given you all things but the flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall you not eat and surely your blood of your lives will requ I will I require at the hand of every Beast will I require it and at the hand of man and at the hand of Every Man's brother will I require the life of man who so shth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God made he man so there's still something special about the VIS of man the the the body of man the the nature of man there's still something special about it so God is preserving it and sanctifying it and and set it in a special that it ought not to be taken though you may eat uh every moving thing that moves shall be meat for you there's a a division that's made amongst the flesh with life thereof and how you shall not take another man's life and because man is in the image of God in verse 7 again and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein now as you read that would you you could we could agree that it's very familiar to what's said in Genesis 1 128 but what's missing there's no commission to subdue it's very similar in the have dominion over the fish and the fowl and every living thing that moveth be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth the very phrase is there be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth be fruitful multiply bring forth a bundle in the earth multiply therein but God is very purposeful because he has not told them to subdue it he has not given them power to subdue because what is being said here represents a new order it's not dominion over the Earth as Adam had it because Mo Noah and his sons are not going to sit there as a god upon Earth to be able to control everything and bring things back and say oh man this is a this is a chaotic world after this flood let's just reverse the curse let's just bring things back and let's move mountains and let's do this and do that Noah and his sons did not have that power though they are commissioned by God saying I want you to multiply you're going to bring forth seed and you're going to populate the whole earth and from you is going to come every living known man upon the face of the Earth and I'm going to make you uh give fear over you of every beast in the earth and every foul of the air and everything that moves and all the fish in the sea they're going to uh they're delivered into your hands you can uh those are yours uh uh to wrestle with to take as you want and for your possession but it's not Dominion like man had as a God can you understand that this is a this is a new commission he's not reissuing the Commandment to Adam God isn't saying oh here hold on Moses Hold On Noah hold on right here let me find it yet Genesis 1:28 and then recommissioning Noah and his three sons after Genesis 128 this is a new commandment altogether when God blesses Noah he's saying this is this is something new for Humanity this is something new for fallen man because by one Blood by one hybrid blood all mankind is going to populate the whole earth and so it's a new commandment really for a new mix of people a hybrid people so God has to recommission man and he has to give them a new commandment be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth but what's Miss in no commandment to subdue the earth now are you each one of you following me so far this morning we're just slowly slowly going through this now Genesis chapter 3: 22- 24 I'm looking at this to show that man in his and this is review this portion here is definitely review that man in his perfection in the G still had further Expressions uh um to be made Genesis 3: 22- 24 and the Lord God said behold the man as is become as one of us to know good and evil plain language man had become something more like God he was already made in the image of God and perfect but now he does something and he acts a certain way he manifests something and in manifesting something God says he's become as one of us or if I could put it this way just if you wanted to give me um the Liberty to use this language he's become more like us man has become as one of us to know good and evil so now something man in his Perfection has taken a step further and if we could use this phrase he's become more perfect man who was like God has become more like God man who had the potential to express the Divine has done something that in one sense is more Divine than what he had had before so God recognizes this then he says and now lest he put forth his hand so now there's something more he can do and take also of the tree life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God set him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man why because man has become more like us and now lest he put forth his hand take of the Tree of Life eat and live forever I'm going to drive out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden chams and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life in other words to seal man off to this from the secret of the further glory to seal man off from this power to take eat and live forever now it's symbolic language I believe it's it's descriptive and it's symbolic and it's showing us that there was something there that man in his per ction was to walk forward in the blessing in the commandment and as he fulfilled God's commission as he had a consciousness of what father put him here on Earth to do as he would act in it he would become more Godlike Express more of God now if if it's hard to understand that just think of the reality that even in eternity God's going to continue to unfold himself he's he's inexhaustible so even Adam in his Perfection still had more to manifest more to accomplish and it become a further the reflection of the divine nature and God so Adam could have walked in this consciousness of what he's placed on Earth to do and now he steps outside of the Commission in Acts and God says he's still become more like us and lest he step further and do more I'm going to stop him from having access to the Tree of Life lest he partake of that and live forever so now God has sealed man off from the secret of further Glory man is not going to be man from that moment on has never gotten any closer to God and God likeness in his flesh that that was the very moment that humanity is degraded and he's not moving towards Perfection he's not moving towards the kingdom he's not moving towards a further expression of God so this shows that there was a further expression of God likeness that could have unfolded or that was to be made manifest in Adam do we can you uh just if you if you're able to just give some affirmation this morning it'd be wonderful if only if you understand it I I don't I don't like for amens to be prompted and say tell someone to say Amen when they can't say Amen it's a very dangerous dangerous place to be and so a very dangerous position to be put in to to demand amens of one who cannot volunteer it of the of the unction of the holy spirit so these scriptures man has become as one of us shows there was a further expression of God liken and then for it say now lest he take also of the Tree of Life suggest that there was more that could have developed this is what the scriptures show to us that there was more that was to unfold so the power the promise the potential that Humanity held was left unfinished and this is this is what we're uh uh this is really maybe what we were spending the first 30 40 minutes just emphasizing is that man lost something his harmony with his maker the maker harmony with his creation our health our strength our eternal spirit he lost the rights to the book he lost his inheritance the Earth he all these things that he lost his holy image of God the fellowship oness with God was broken all the power that Humanity held was lost all the potential that Humanity stood for all all the promise that Adam and the woman have is left unfinished and so was the earth so is the earth brother bam says in the third seal who is able to come and take this book of redemp referring to Revelation 5 for the whole Plan of Redemption from Adam all that Adam lost there was nothing lost until Adam and after Adam all was lost in the earth everything on the creation of the Earth was lost this is where this is all coming in view to me when as God has inspired this God created in the beginning God created God's creation is lost the the potential of it the promise of it what what he wanted to do with it things are being lost he says all Adam was lost with after Adam all was lost in the earth everything on the creation Earth was lost and everything fell with Adam crossed the chasm no one could get back no way at all man when he sinned he left his way he left no way back for himself so there is now a uh uh the power of mankind lays dormant all the promise that he had everything that he could do you talk about wasted talent and all that had such potential it's gone and it's not only just Adam as a man but the Earth feels the same loss everything the Earth was to do everything the Earth was to be everything all the potential this beautiful Perfect Harmony between Creator and creation and and the the made and the maker oh it's oh this is so amazing this is so wonderful it's all lost all of a sudden Humanity is left un the purpose of humanity what father put him here on Earth to do is left unfinished and what he was supposed to do related to the Earth therefore the Earth's potential is left unsatisfied right but from the beginning God was aiming for something glorious that's right and because that was his aim he's going to hit it that's the beautiful part from the beginning God was aiming in the beginning God created he was aiming for something glorious and God will do it just say he won't God's going to do it God's going to accomplish it because in Revelations chapter 21 let's read this now I think this just means so much more to me to read it here in this context of what we just went through because even after we read in Genesis 9 how there's a a world New World Order and a commission given to Noah and it follows this order that was given to Adam from Genesis 3 to Genesis 9 we just see the upheaval and turmoil and tearing down of of God's creation and then even after the New World Order we see mankind is just further thrown into a a a confusion and Chaos of Babel and everything but this this creation of God from the beginning this in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and and the so quick undoing of all of it and all the p potential and the promise and the power and man what he's supposed to be to his maker and creation what it's supposed to be to man and all this big beautiful picture all of it's lost but now you get to Revelation 21 and remember those parallels that you could bring out between Genesis and Revelation says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away now what was brother B points out to us it's not annihilated and gone but renovated redeemed amen it's passed away the the the former El elements and the things that were imperfect there's a new Heaven A New Earth these original spoken word attributes of God uh that anything that was perverted anything that was unsavory anything that was not part of the original has been purged out and it's a new Heaven and a new Earth re remade re re renovated and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband we've gone through these things through these first several uh services in this subject and he says and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying now this is beautiful behold the Tabernacle of God is with men this is this Fellowship of Oneness being restored back to man behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God what is this the holy image of God being united back together the Tabernacle of God God not only the Tabernacle of God with men but man is the Tabernacle of God yeah he's going to dwell in them they're dwelling together this is the expression of God where do we see him how do we know him here he is man is the Tabernacle of God and then beautiful beautiful verse four and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away that's right God has now anything that was able to come up in Genesis 3 God's dealt with it gone it's over where did Death come in Genesis 3 where does it end Revelations 21 it's gone where does sorrow come in Genesis 3 where do we know it's completely gone and no more Revelation 21 verse 5 and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new the same God in the beginning who created now says I make all things new the very God who formed man of the Dust of the ground the very one who made all things that are the very one that made all of creation Now is declaring something that is glorious I make all things new now consider what is now made and what's represented Revelation 21 compared to what was made in Genesis 1 and 2 and we can say this without without a doubt at all what he makes here will never be defiled amen yes what he has made I make all things new it will never top over it'll never go into a cycle it'll never revert back to sorrow never revert back to death it'll never revert back to night I make all things new this is what God in the beginning was foreshadowing this is what Satan thought he had upended but it was necessary for God to be a redeemer so God allowed there to be a fall to the original creation but now he says behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and this verse s six is is hit me harder than it I it's almost as if I'd never read it before and he said unto me it is done amen it is done now it is finished now is accomplished well I thought when we read in Genesis chapter 2 and God rested on the seventh day he said no every seed's been swn I won't I don't need to create from nothing again the spoken word Original Seed has been sown and now you can say it is done yeah that which I spoke in the beginning that which was embodied in Genesis 1: 11 that which was embodied in Genesis 1 128 that which was meant in humanity in Genesis chapter 2 all these things that I've spoke it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end am it is done I've accomplished it what I was wanting in humanity what I was wanting in creation it is accomplished and I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcome a Herod all things all of creation all that is finished all that I've made new and I will be his God and he shall be my son it's the very image that God expressed in the beginning amen but now it's not just a man who stepped forth from God but now it is one who has overcome to inherit all things Adam lost his inheritance the Earth but he did it without suffering Adam had lost his inher or had inherited the Earth but he did it without suffering and he lost all of his inheritance to the Earth but now here's one that overcomes and inherits all things and God is his God and he is his the son it's the very image that God had in the beginning perfected yes oh it's so beautiful oh it's so wonderful I wish I had more breath in my lungs I wish I wasn't so tired I wish I could really just preach this well maybe if I was a better preacher I could and I'll accept that but even now to whatever degree if I'm a two on a scale of one to a 100 I wish I was really getting a two right now to be able to convey just how perfect this picture is in my my eyes how God begins to describe the new Heaven and the new Earth and how it appears to be the full development of the negative of Genesis 1 2 and 3 that's right it is done I am the alpha that was there in Genesis 1 I'm the Omega here in Genesis 21 what I set out to do I have accomplished that beautiful so now let's continue with this picture of what God's wanting to get to we have to get there is it isn't it beautiful to be reminded that we're we're in this spiritual condition now as this New Jerusalem the bride the body the Tabernacle of God here upon Earth now we ended with this statement last time conflict between God and Satan and you might wonder why didn't you just start with this and service would have been half as long um I wrestled with just what order to go in but I felt some of these things were necessary to background this conflict between God and Satan God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite God seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle so did the battle surprise God no did God have to scramble all of a sudden he like oh no no Michael come here Satan's in the garden why didn't we think of this he's talking to the woman what's going to happen no he had it all laid out there knowing there'd be a conflict there's going to be a battle God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition right kind of attack the right kind of everything that they would have need of and this is the phrase to me that I trust that you never forget that would sweep them all the way from Eden to the Rapture isn't that statement just amazing isn't it precious it's almost as if we read it and we're like well okay yeah Technic Al the same word he gave him in the beginning it's the same word that we use now in the end but he's not saying it that way he's saying that God knew there would be conflict God knew there would be a battle so before man ever fell and would need a resurrection before man ever fell and would need a Rapture before man ever fell and would need Redemption God gave him a word that would do it before there was death he gave him a word that could defeat death before there was sickness he gave him a word that could defeat sickness however you want to look at it is exactly what brother bram's saying he gave him the right kind of attack he says what was it the word he gave him a word in the beginning that would sweep them all the way from Eden as it fell and it would be that word that would lead you to a Rapture so when did God speak the word for a Rapture Genesis 1 spoken word is the Original Seed that's why when you go back to that message spoken words of the original seed and you recognize that this message does not just bring us back to the day of Pentecost this message does not just try to restore back Christian principles to the Christian church but it brings us back to the in the beginning amen brings us back to the original purpose and nature of God he gave them a word that would sweep them all the way from Eden in a fall to the Rapture and I let me say this I believe it's embodied in Genesis 1 128 that's that's when the word is given to man it's the only place that we can read and God blessed them and God is giving them the word of God it's the one thing that we could see where it's embodied it embodies all this he gave them a word that would sweep them from Eden to the Rapture think Genesis 1: 12 would give mankind everything he would need in the earth he was given his eyes his nose his teeth everything that the body in order for him to live he was given five senses to contact this Earthly home he had every element everything there that he needed he came from the earth he had a body everything was there but he needed this power now in him to operate and function within it and God by Genesis 128 gave him everything he would need to live in Eden and not just live in Eden but take him in a Rapture the word in Genesis 1 128 that points to the Rapture is this very power that he was given to subdue the Earth multiply replenish the Earth be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth is given to Noah but the power to subdue is withheld from him but in the beginning in this original blessing and commandment this word that he was given to sweep them all the way from from Eden to the Rapture where do we find a word to sweep them to the Rapture I have given you Adam power to subdue the Earth yes subdue means to subject to to to force to keep under to bring under subjection it means to dominate or tread down Adam I give you power to subdue the earth now when we think subdue the Earth do we think just the the dust of the earth he's going to be able to make sand castles or he's going to be able to build Adobe Huts or he's going to be able to subject the clay and he's going to bring seed out of it or does it also relate to this cuz he formed him from the dust of the earth so the power to subdue the Earth gives them power to subdue the flesh so before even the flesh had fallen God says I'm going to give you power to subject it that's what he was originally within him he was to have that power it's kabash subdue kabash put the kabash on it I don't know if that's exactly where they get it from it may be Hebrew or Yiddish or something subdue kabash to subject to force to keep under to bring into subjection to dominate and tread down subdue the Earth dominate it tread it down bring it under subjection and Paul now uses this very language in 1 Corinthians 9:27 he says but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away it's the exact same language that God gives Adam to subdue the Earth to keep it un bring it into subjection and Paul is I believe picking up on this Revelation that this is what man is supposed to do he is to possess this vessel he's to subdue this Earth I will keep under my body I will bring it into subjection I will control it not let it control me I will have power over it so this this blessing this power this commandment the word in Genesis 1: 128 to subdue the Earth This Promise relates to the body and it pointed to the further Glory that man was ordained to manifest because man acts and and God says man's become more like us now lest he reach forth and partake of the tree of life and live forever in what his flesh I'm going to stop him from doing it so this power to subdue the flesh this power to subdue the Earth which is which the flesh relates to it Point pointed to the further Glory that man could have walked in and manifest Ed can I get your permission to go further thank you in the message hear ye him now and I I think I just want that to stand there and I hope it I hope it there's enough there that I've shared in this I I I just don't have the uh that just the clarity this morning in my in my mind I think to know whether or not I'm even uh passing this along correctly but let let's just let it stand there I gave you power to subdue the Earth Earth that was power to sweep them all the way to a Rapture what's the Rapture change of these bodies so now God had contemplated a further Glory now in the message hear ye him when God made man he made him a God he gave him dominion over the Earth that would include the flesh all of creation but his Fallen estate dropped that his dominion over the Earth that's why man can't keep himself alive no matter how hard he tries but what they lost by Adam it was restored by Christ now this is where it just there's so many statements I want to read to you and I trust we'll be able to get to a lot of them here I'm telling you Calvary means more to me than it's ever meant the the the story of God sending his son means more to me Christmas is going to mean I know he wasn't born in December but it's going to mean a little a little bit more to me this year to understand these things in light of the full picture it was restored by Christ what Adam lost was restored by Christ brother says everything the human race lost in Adam was redeemed when Christ okay so now what man lost Christ is showing he's restored so there has to be then the resurrection of the power the potential the promise all that Humanity held and now some connection to the Earth as a creation and the body which came from the earth Braham says in the message Led Led by the spirit he says and he sent his son on earth made in likeness of sinful flesh and he died that we might be redeemed and brought back to God to be Sons and Daughters of God to walk with him again notice this phrase that Missing Link from the Garden of Eden what Adam lost Christ restored again we often think The Missing Link is the serpent correct there's another Missing Link why because there had to be the brother ra said the correct son would have been Christ he would have eventually come forth right but he didn't so that was the missing link that son had to come he had to be made manifest but it couldn't come without their first being a fall and there has to be suffering and there had to be death and there had to be sorrow before that son had come had to come so that's the missing link from the garden what Adam lost Christ restores again so Christ restores what Adam loses so in Genesis 3: 14- 15 he says this is a curse to the serpent but it prophesies of this Redeemer The Missing Link so as he's cursing The Serpent and creating one missing link he reveals the other Missing Link amen right Genesis 3:14-15 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and notice what it says and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life now that's a peculiar phrase isn't it where does man's body come from the dust of the earth what is that serpent seed done to this flesh it's caused death that hybriding that mongrelize so now the serpent swn into Humanity it's going to eat man's flesh all the days of its life as long as that hybrid is in flesh what does it do it dies it dies so God is declaring more than just you're going to Slither on your belly and the dust of the earth going to get in your mouth but no it also speaks to the fact that he's a flesh eater that it takes life from man so he says and I'll put enity in light of the fact that you are going to be the one that causes death to mankind I'll put enmity between thy seed between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so the it is a he this is a prophecy of who Christ who restores back everything Adam lost so when BR when God now is speaking this he says the serpent you're going to be a uh you're going to crawl on your belly every day all the days of your life and he says but now I'm going to put enity between the seed of the woman and thy seed and the seed of the woman is he it is Christ and because he's going to restore everything Adam lost then he is going to have power to bruise thy head he's going to have power to crush thy head so the serpent was a flesh eater and because of sin All Flesh is as grass and it Withers away and I I could share more scriptures in that but we'll just make quick reference to them because of the fall of mankind his flesh becomes subject to death and man is dying and he Withers away and his life is but a vapor but now in this prophecy of Christ say Christ is going to crush the head of the flesh eater he's going to crush the head of the one that brought death into mankind he's going to destroy death why because he restores what Adam lost Adam had power over death he forfeited power over his body he forfeited power over the flesh to keep it alive to sustain it but now in the very first prophecy of Christ the very thing that we see come up is the fact that Christ is going to destroy death and the one that caused it the serpent who eats the Flesh and causes death and he going to eat dust all the days of his life there's going to come one that's going to have power to subdue in John chap 10: 17 to 18 therefore doth my father love me because now notice who could say this I Lay My Life down that I might take it again huh what I'm going to lay my life down but I'm going to take it back up again who can do this who has power to do that no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself and could you imagine those people over there who are you know sharpening their knives and tying knots and getting nails ready wanting to crucify this guy we're going to take him we're going to take his life and he goes oh you're not going to take it from me I'm going to lay it down well fair enough if you just want to give yourself up and die like oh and not only that I'll just come right back up again like who does this who takes his life and then take it who gives his life and could take it back again this doesn't even make any sense surely he is a mad man but he says this I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this is new yeah any man could take his life any man could could lay his life down put himself in a dangerous situation put his life in Peril and act in a way that's negligent or uh Reckless and take his own life and take somebody else's life a man can voluntarily willingly do something to cause life to uh to go out of his body but no man can reverse that and he says and no one certain terms I have power to lay down my life I have power to give my life and I have power to give myself life again now where in the world did you get that Jesus this commandment have I received of my father the Commandment had been given back to to man again he didn't just have it because again he's just saving he knows he knows molecules and he had essential oils that we don't have I mean it was nothing like that he had power from the Father the father had given him a commandment multiply replenish subdue the Earth I've given you power to lay down your life I've given you Commandments to take it back up again he had received a commission of the Father the commandment and the blessing had been revived in Christ all that Adam had lost in the fall Christ is proven that it restores back Christ is proving God's Plan of Redemption by saying I give you power to lay down your life and I give you power to take your life back up I'm showing that Redemption is in you the power lays within you Jesus how did he have it why did he have it it was given to him a commandment a blessing an enduement was conferred upon him this commandment have I received of my father he didn't even he couldn't even brag about the power to lay his life down and to take it back up of his own volition of his own will it came from God Revelations chapter 1 verse5 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead you don't want to leave now this is when it's getting good there's not a mass Exodus taking place you know if anybody's wondering but Jesus Christ who's the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead now that's a strange phrase isn't it first begotten of the Dead we know he's the only he was the only begotten Son of God but now he's the first begotten of dead the first born or it is the first to enter life the first to ra ra by power given to him to Immortal Life this is something that's inherent in what Man was created to be and what Man was created to have and to express God's power of redemption what greater power of redemption would there to be for something to have completely vanquished of life but then have power to bring the life right back up that's what all nature testifies to that's what it was all the cycles of day and night everything God was always testifying and poined us so now Christ is the first begotten the first born from the dead the first one to enter Life by a power that was given to him he was raised from death into not just life again but Immortal Life though some were raised before from the dead it was not by a power they possessed nor was it to eternal life they could not raise themselves back up nor was it to eternal life though many had been I say many though others were raised from the dead Christ had power to give up his life power to take it up again because it was conferred upon him a blessing given to him so he's called the first begotten of the Dead in Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence that in all things he might have the preeminence and we're told that he that overcometh shall inherit all things behold I make all things new that in all things he might have the premise it's because he's the first born from the dead he's the first to conquer death the first begotten of the Dead the first to enter into life from Life into death into immortality he's the first born from the dead and he's not called the only born from the dead but the first begotten from the dead the first born from the dead the first to conquer death because why the powers to be conferred upon others amen he is not the only begotten from the dead why there are others also who are going to share in this immortality he's the firstborn from the dead in John 13:3 Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was from come from he was come from God and went to God he knew all things had been given into his hands well this is the power the blessing the promise confered upon him he says in Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth yeah the what Adam lost in the fall Christ is now given again it has been conferred upon him it is conveyed to him everything that he was given Adam had he lost it was forfeited it went back to God but now Christ is proving that this power is resident in flesh again Philippians chapter 3: 21 I I I am in an unfortunate spot in how this just laid out this morning to where I can't just stop there I've got to just taken another step further and it says this in Philippians chapter 3: 21 because I want to nail this down this power to subdue Christ who's restored all the Adam lost he's the missing link from the garden this commandment have I received of my father to lay down my life power to take it up again the first begotten of of the Dead holding all those thoughts in your minds now I think it all has to fit together a word that would sweep them all the way from Eden to the Rapture the Rapture relates to this body the change of this body now Christ proved he had power to lay that body down and to take it up again and then it says in Philippians 3:21 who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like un his glorious body according to what according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself C did you catch that he's going to change our vile body into a glorified body by what power the glorification of our flesh is connected to his power to subdue all things all power is given to me in heaven and earth I've given all things are into my hands and in all things that he might have the preeminence and what did it result in he's the first begotten from the dead he's the first born from the dead he has conquered death and entered into immortality he has power to lay down his life he has power to take it up again and now he's expressing this that the very glorification of our body is connected with God giving him power to subdue Adam in the beginning was be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth and subdue the Earth subdue all things that means your body Adam but Adam lost the power to subdue the flesh but it was given back to Christ and now the power to subdue is being conveyed as a blessing upon mankind that this body shall be changed what is it Colossians 1:27 Christ in you the hope of glory he will change our bodies into a glorified body by what power the glorification of your flesh the further glory to be revealed in you is connected with Christ's power to subdue that's why Jesus brother brandom could say he gave you a word to sweep you all the way from Eden to a Rapture in Genesis 1 128 notice these few statements I I have three of them on one slide so I could go through them very quickly here see I knew I needed to hurry have faith in God we have the Blessed assurance that someday these vile bodies will be changed and made like into his own glorious body whereby he's able to subdue all things unto himself brother just quoting the scripture what was the Holy Ghost given for the corruptible bodies of those that sleep in him shall be changed and made like into his own glorious body this is a glorified body a glorified body a glorified flesh that will never die never rot never age whereby he's able to subdue all things unto himself Jubilee year the corruptible bodies of those that asleep in him will be changed and made like into his own glorious body whereby he's able to subdue all things unto himself again it's just a quoting of Philippians 3:21 but the power to change this body from flesh to glorified flesh is connected with power to what subdue it's power to subdue the Earth just as we go back and think about that again to subdue Christ was given power to what to subdue to crush or to bruise the Serpent's head it means to tread under to dominate to put death under your feet to take the body and to subdue death to subdue it to where it's no longer subject to corruption Christ has power to dominate and tread down the effect of the serpent his power to dominate and tread down death he has power to subdue all things and the glorification of our body is connected with the commandment and the blessing to subdue the Earth in the message Queen of Sheba says Christianity is based upon not replacement reincarnation but Resurrection the same one went down come up but in the Splendor of immortality wo aren't you glad that there was there was some immortality withheld from Adam because God was saving it he wanted to deal with death first sin make himself known in imort being Immortal there would have been so many things God could not have expressed to to another Immortal we had to become mortal for this Splendor for the real glory of God to be made manifest but now that one that went down comes up in the Splendor of immortality made like un his own glorious body where he's able to subdue all things unto himself is this beautiful to you isn't it wonderful just to see how these things are laid out so clearly for us in the word of God to understand that God has given us power to bind the greatest am as it says in the message Countdown the hour will come when we I'll take this conjunction we will have to have Rapture power who will have to have it I will you will we will the hour come when we will have to have Rapture power not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment who will have the power you will have it you will have power to subdue to do what to subdue this body and change it from a mortal body to an immortal body to take the very elements and atoms of this body which are which are ingrained and swn with death you're going to have power to change yourself in your atoms very very Changed by the power to subdue why you've been given power over it as a God to take the atoms and align them back upright to where they will not die the very power of glorification resides within us we'll have power to Rapture we'll have Rapture power to change the body in a twinklet of an eye Christ will be so real into their bodies till he can change it by his great death and what he purchased will have Rapture power you have Rapture power what is it power to subdue power to change this flesh from Mortal to immortality power to swallow up death into life because the Bible says in Romans 16:20 and the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly we've been reading that several times already in these first few months Satan the flesh eater you're going to crush his head why you've been given power to subdue I'm gonna skip I'm just GNA skip a scripture reading where the Bible says well let's just read it quickly Romans 8:1 19-22 for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope remember the Earth's purpose was left unsatisfied from the very moment that mankind fell creation has been groaning waiting for all the promise the potential and power that Adam represented they sensed it they experienced it in Genesis chapter 2 when Adam walked among them and named them and empowered them and gave them purpose and was placing them the naming of something is placing them in their position and here's Adam placing animal life and Creation in their position giving them meaning giving them purpose and now all this potential that was being expressed and then the woman comes out from man and all the creation is witnessing isn't this beautiful isn't this amazing now there's something left groaning and the Earth is left pregant longing for something but they're made subject in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now what are they longing for the manifestation of the sons of God even a manifestation that was not fully made manifest in Adam but was made manifest in Christ all creation travails we said it last time not because of sin and not because man sinned but it travails and groans for Redemption because Redemption is what all creation was made for brother Braham says in the message unfailing realities of the Living God and when God made man in his own image he put him on the earth as a Lesser God Jesus declared it when he said is it not written in your law that you're gods and if they called those Gods who the word of God come to which was the prophets how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God he said see they just couldn't understand it but man was put here with a dominion over the Earth he had everything under his control Adam lost Jesus proved that he had restored he stopped nature he raised the dead he done everything now if you could I I've been trending to this and I just can't seem to get there just start thinking about all those instances of the third pool it relates to all things it relates to Creation it relates to the original commission he done everything and all the world is growing today the Bible said for the manifestations of the sons of God for God to get into his children again in reality to make things real to bring it back to the reality of Genesis 120 to bring it back to the full realization of what God wanted to do to do in the beginning and it stumbles the people he says the the concept of salvation oh I'm a sinner oh I'm depraved and I'm strained from God and adopt me as your child and make this orphan you know one that could sit at your table that doesn't stumble people but the fact that God desired to make man God that's what stumbles people for God to get into his children and to become flesh in his bride and to make things real and the reality of God to be lived out in the flesh of his people that's what stumbles the people and not only does creation grown and creation cry out longing for the manifestations of sons but we ourselves verse 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the Redemption of our body Why without that there's not the glorification there's not the subduing there's not the full man estation of what all creation was Longing To See in the beginning the body that came from Earth must be subdued it's not enough that it would be healed it's not enough that it would even be raised from the dead to die again but it must be changed to the original Glory that God contemplated it must be changed into the same glorious body that Jesus Christ has that's right that's what we're living for we're not living for a funeral one day we're going to have the last one one day the last bride member is going to lay in a coffin why because it's a promise of God that will not fail death will be swallowed up of life amen in the message conflict between God and Satan I'm just not going to be able to finish and and I know it won't stumble any of you to have to just pick back up on some of this I want to read that statement again but God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite God now seeing there's going to be a conflict and there's going to be a battle God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition right kind of attack the right kind of everything that they would need had need of that would sweep them all the way from Eden to the Rapture can you see that a little bit better now what was it the word the word that's what defeats Satan is the word it will defeat him anywhere any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing that there is the word and we find Jesus on Earth just to prove this was the best equipment when Satan came in hand toand combat with Jesus he never reached over with this power and tied his hands he just took the same weapon that God gave in the Garden of Eden his word and said it is written it's written and he punched him right out of the ring with it that's right because it's God's best and do you realize what brother brandham said has been restored back to you the word the word has been restored back to you listen that's what must have the preeminence that must be what we're connected to and tied to above even certain gifts and certain manifestations and certain charism and outpourings and things that can move Upon Our flesh those things are wonderful the gifts of the Spirit are in the word these certain powers of Prophecy and speaking in tongues they're lovely and God communicates to us through those things but listen let the word have preeminence that's the best it's the word that'll bring the results brother brandham says in future home and I I had a few more statements and some more things I wanted to amplify in it but we'll just stop here he says Adam was to multiply and replenish the Earth Noah was after the new world was destroyed was to multiply and replenish the Earth can't you see what the serpent seed is what replenished the Earth you get it you see how Satan got to Eve that's why death has reigned on Earth ever since and Heavens Earth Beast atmosphere is all cursed of God because of it that's the curs because Satan got to this first Jesus came to redeem it back to the father in order to do this he became part of it and from that very dust the part Jesus was himself being redeemed through him all of the attributes of God are redeemed with the Earth is redemption beautiful all the attributes of God do you know you know that's who you are all the attributes of God are redeemed with the Earth and he teaches how God redeems the person is the same way he redeems the Earth listen Saints we are ordained to satisfy and subdue the Earth this word this word has been committed unto you why you are a redeemed attribute of God through Christ through the even the Redemption of the very dust of the Earth power has been given to you to subdue as an attribute of God therefore I believe we could take the word which is the best weapon the best equipment and we can fight the Devil With It Whatever you have need of you can use this word to do it we have been given power this Earth this body which came from this Earth it must be subdued God bless you let's stand to our feet this this morning we just eak in in the morning we got finished before noon I don't have much breath or energy to worship I trust it wouldn't be an offense if we just cut it short but let's worship Him in song Let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich I want to ask you today and I want you to raise a hand do you know that God is with you you know that he loves you he's promised to never leave you nor forsake you we have urgent needs within our body sister Ruth Korea's dad is in the hospital struggling with severe covid symptoms whether Albert Morales is at home a very strong man very able capable man is struggling with sickness others in our church suffering from different maladies and different afflictions I have no doubt that a word has been committed to us that we could take and use against any sickness if we've been given power to subdue the Earth that means any sickness resident in your flesh is subject to the power to subdue that's even what Divine Healing it represents Divine Healing is just a token it's just a a signification of power over death why because that would be the greatest that's the most wonderful power there could be is the power to lay down your life and take it right back up again if there's power over death there is no power over you therefore let us stand confident in the grace that God has given us as the elect stand for loved ones stand for those who have needs today and as we pray let's present our token let's go to prayer our gracious heavenly father today those of us who are able to be here in service we have needs we have our own needs in our flesh we're weak we're tired Lord some of us fighting different afflictions and those of us who are present we have longings and desires for ourselves financially emotionally physically Lord we have questions and perplexities but Lord we stand here today for others and Lord we stand for sister Ruth's Dad we stand for brother Albert we stand for brother James we stand for sister Morgan Lord we stand for anybody in our church today who is absent from us we stand for those who are caring for their loved ones Lord we're not standing for ourselves but we stand before the throne of grace as bearers of your presence as Believers in your word as those who hold the token and hold it high and we claim now healing in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we claim name these Redemptive blessings Lord what are these Redemptive blessings it's the very restoration of what man lost in Genesis chapter 1 and Lord I pray today for healing in our body I pray for a raising up we speak power over sickness we speak power over disease we speak power over sin and I pray Lord that you would take feeble bodies and raise them up take lungs and put breath into them take inflammation and may it be gone the loss of taste Lord may it be restored the loss of smell may it be restored back lord whatever the malady may be free things up loose things father I pray we're standing Upon A Promise without doubt Lord there's not one doubt in my heart today believing that it shall be done father I ask now that you would give strength to your body for we are standing Upon A promise that this bride has been restored to a position to be able to subdue may all things be subdued father commit it to you now praying for your grace and your blessing upon your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
