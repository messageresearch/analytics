[0:00] amen let's turn to genesis chapter 2.
[0:03] we like to read verses 16 and 17 genesis
[0:05] chapter 2
[0:10] 16-17
[0:11] we begin a
[0:14] a series called
[0:16] barriers and boundaries on wednesday
[0:19] night
[0:20] and it is in a lot of ways just a
[0:21] continuation of a number of different
[0:23] themes that we've been ministering on
[0:24] over the last few months
[0:26] and
[0:28] just see a lot of continuity with some
[0:30] what some of the busy ministers have
[0:31] ministered on over the last month or so
[0:33] as well so i think there's just be a lot
[0:35] for us to grab ahold of and piece
[0:38] together genesis chapter 2
[0:40] verse 16 and lord god commanded the man
[0:42] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[0:44] mayest freely eat
[0:46] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[0:48] and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in
[0:50] the day that thou eatest thereof thou
[0:52] shalt surely
[0:54] die
[0:55] let's bow our heads in prayer
[0:57] our gracious heavenly father it's a
[0:59] grand privilege to be together this
[1:00] morning and to
[1:02] do so with believers that have a a
[1:05] unique faith and a precious faith
[1:07] and lord we pray that as we have
[1:09] gathered together and brought our faith
[1:10] our expectation our licks of fire as it
[1:13] were
[1:14] to hear from you and to receive from you
[1:17] may it just
[1:18] create
[1:19] a wonderful atmosphere
[1:22] to receive whatever it is we have need
[1:23] of
[1:24] and lord as we have things that have not
[1:26] been expressed by lips and desires that
[1:29] we have not shared with others we know
[1:30] that you know our hearts
[1:32] and in knowing our heart you can discern
[1:34] and you can meet those needs and even
[1:36] you today lord could speak a word that
[1:38] addresses it in such a way to lift our
[1:41] faith to encourage us and to help us so
[1:43] lord i pray that you'd come now take the
[1:45] word of god bless it may it be amplified
[1:47] to our hearts by revelation be with your
[1:49] people to comfort them and strengthen
[1:51] them and have preeminence we pray in the
[1:54] name of the lord jesus christ amen
[1:57] amen you can be seated
[2:03] i would uh
[2:05] mention that we started this on
[2:07] wednesday night and i almost would like
[2:09] to make it recommended listening as we
[2:11] continue in this subject
[2:13] if you if you didn't weren't here
[2:15] wednesday night and you'd like to hear
[2:16] it
[2:17] i would recommend you going back and
[2:19] listening to it maybe even after this
[2:21] just not right now
[2:23] everyone leaves puts their headphones on
[2:25] uh but no i just would recommend that
[2:27] you listen to it uh and just to kind of
[2:29] add to and kind of help understand where
[2:31] we're coming from today because i really
[2:33] just want to pick up where we were
[2:34] wednesday night without much um
[2:37] the without much background in where we
[2:39] were and we are focusing on genesis
[2:41] chapter one and god is establishing
[2:43] order in creation and having boundaries
[2:46] and setting bounds and putting the moon
[2:48] uh keep boundaries and tell them to see
[2:50] it could only go so far
[2:52] but on barriers and boundaries what we
[2:54] touched on at the very very end is how
[2:56] important it is to recognize the
[2:58] differences between the two
[3:01] uh barrier is one thing a boundary is
[3:03] another we'll get to some of those
[3:04] definitions here in a moment
[3:06] but this is gonna sound like a paradox
[3:08] but in order to experience an unlimited
[3:10] god you're gonna have to understand his
[3:12] boundaries
[3:13] and there's a way we think about his
[3:14] love his love is boundless his word was
[3:16] without end he's a god that fills all
[3:18] time and space and we think about
[3:19] eternity and all those different factors
[3:22] but in order to experience that god
[3:24] you're going to have to understand his
[3:25] boundaries
[3:26] and in order to
[3:28] truly express his nature if you we
[3:30] likewise are going to be those that
[3:32] express the character and nature of
[3:33] christ we're gonna have to understand
[3:35] the difference between barriers and
[3:37] boundaries
[3:38] and if i could put it this way that's
[3:39] just terminology uh that i'm using to
[3:42] understand concepts within the word of
[3:44] god
[3:45] and something there's uh different ways
[3:49] that we could be pulled even this
[3:51] morning as we minister there's maybe
[3:52] different ways that we could start to
[3:54] veer into some things but when we talk
[3:56] about barriers and boundaries we're
[3:58] looking at relationship and
[4:00] responsibility
[4:01] uh if you think about the concept of
[4:03] boundaries even the concepts of barriers
[4:05] you'll find that they have application
[4:07] in terms of what would give one
[4:09] responsibility has application with
[4:11] respect to relationships
[4:13] and as we were talking about practice
[4:15] this kind of veers into or kind of
[4:17] continue to lead into
[4:19] the concept of us doing our part in
[4:22] doing what we are called to do
[4:24] and
[4:25] there's uh there's just so many
[4:27] different examples that come to mind but
[4:28] we talked about it wednesday night how
[4:30] every day we're navigating barriers
[4:32] every day we're navigating boundaries uh
[4:34] it's both in the natural and the
[4:36] spiritual uh some of us bump into
[4:38] boundaries when we're driving some of us
[4:39] are navigating them or bump into
[4:42] barriers there's things that we
[4:44] fight against or things that we wrestle
[4:45] with and it's both natural and spiritual
[4:47] the concept of berries and boundaries
[4:49] shouldn't be real foreign to us
[4:51] and before i really get into this
[4:55] and and i i sense that you already are i
[4:57] really would desire that you focus very
[4:59] intently because i
[5:01] i feel like there's things i'm just kind
[5:02] of
[5:03] brushing over but if you could focus and
[5:05] concentrate very intently you can just
[5:07] kind of get the depth to it and so some
[5:10] things may not seem to connect but if
[5:12] you're really focusing and very intent i
[5:14] think you'll just see something very
[5:15] rich
[5:16] be amplified this morning
[5:19] now where we were wednesday night when
[5:21] we stopped
[5:22] is we identified how that god uses
[5:25] boundaries something that god does he
[5:27] uses boundaries and a boundary is that
[5:29] which indicates a border or a limit you
[5:32] say well what would that example be a
[5:33] wall a wall is a boundary a fence is a
[5:36] boundary something that's set up or put
[5:38] up indicate the limit of something or
[5:40] the border of something
[5:42] a boundary is something that indicates
[5:44] the limits of something therefore it is
[5:46] a dividing line or boundary is the
[5:49] furthest point of something
[5:51] so this is this is what we want you to
[5:53] think in terms of boundaries it's the
[5:54] limits of something it's the border
[5:57] it's the dividing line when you have a
[5:59] boundary it's the dividing line your
[6:01] property has a dividing line it's a
[6:03] boundary line it's a border and so it's
[6:04] what divides your property from someone
[6:06] else's property and in our in our
[6:09] country uh we put up fences uh to mark
[6:12] our boundaries to mark the borders of
[6:14] our property and that becomes a boundary
[6:16] indicating this part's my responsibility
[6:19] what's on the other side is your
[6:20] responsibility and so it marks the
[6:23] furthest point of a property line the
[6:24] furthest point of
[6:26] and god is the one that uses boundaries
[6:29] he's a god of boundaries but barriers
[6:31] are something that man uses barriers are
[6:34] something that satan uses and i'd like
[6:36] to look at it more in that context that
[6:38] satan uses barriers and it barriers
[6:40] anything that obstructs an entrance so
[6:42] you want to get into some place you put
[6:44] up a bear if there's a barrier there
[6:45] it's keeping you from entering in other
[6:47] words it's it's made for an entrance
[6:49] it's made for you to have access it's
[6:52] there there's something there for you to
[6:53] take or to have or to enjoy and you put
[6:55] up a barrier to keep others from coming
[6:58] in or to keep someone out so barrier is
[7:00] an obstacle a barrier something that
[7:03] impedes a barrier is something that
[7:04] hinders and so god uses boundaries
[7:08] he sets boundaries he has the limits of
[7:10] things but satan's the one that uses
[7:11] barriers we're all on the same page now
[7:14] good now that we're on the same page you
[7:16] can you can unleash your amens
[7:19] now if you'll turn to matthew chapter 13
[7:22] this is uh maybe a unique place to start
[7:25] but god uses boundaries satan uses
[7:28] barriers matthew chapter 13
[7:30] verses 53-58
[7:37] it says and it came to pass that when
[7:39] jesus had finished these parables he'd
[7:42] departed things
[7:43] and when he was coming to his own
[7:45] country so now he's coming to nazareth
[7:47] he taught them in their synagogues in so
[7:49] much that they were astonished and said
[7:52] here's christ present amongst them
[7:53] teaching he's the messiah
[7:56] he's just expressed these different
[7:58] parables he's not uh this isn't his
[8:00] first sermon so we have several chapters
[8:02] into the story of jesus and different
[8:05] works that he's done
[8:06] so now he's teaching he has a reputation
[8:09] he's there amongst him it says winst
[8:10] this is their response when's hath this
[8:13] man this wisdom and these mighty works
[8:15] where is this coming from
[8:17] how is it he has these profound things
[8:19] to say and and why do how is it he's
[8:21] able to perform these mighty works and
[8:23] this is how they begin to wrestle within
[8:25] themselves
[8:26] and speculate is not this the
[8:29] carpenter's son
[8:30] is not his mother called mary and his
[8:33] brethren james and joseph and simon and
[8:36] judas
[8:37] and his sisters are they not all with us
[8:40] they're given the whole family tree
[8:42] you know his mom we know his dad we know
[8:44] his brothers we know his sisters are
[8:45] they're not with us so they're not all
[8:47] not human and mortal creatures
[8:49] wins then hath this man all these things
[8:53] perhaps there's some speculation that
[8:54] they're saying well we know joseph we
[8:56] know mary we know his brothers we know
[8:57] his sisters and none of them have any of
[8:59] these gifts none of them have this kind
[9:01] of wisdom have these kind of talents
[9:02] there's there's no way for us to deduce
[9:04] that this is a family of stature and
[9:07] skill or acumen and there's no real
[9:09] reason for us to see these things being
[9:11] expressed in jesus but this is the
[9:14] process they're going through as they
[9:16] wrestle with the words that jesus is
[9:18] teaching and
[9:19] that he's doing
[9:20] and he says and it says verse 57 and
[9:24] they were offended in him
[9:27] defended in him
[9:30] and but jesus said unto them
[9:35] a prophet is not without honor saving
[9:38] his own country and in his own house
[9:41] it was i'm honored everywhere else
[9:43] i'm honored in every other country i'm
[9:45] other honored in other places that i go
[9:47] but the one place that i'm without honor
[9:49] is in nazareth the one place i'm without
[9:51] honor is within within my own family
[9:53] those that know me those that are around
[9:55] me a prophet is not without honor save
[9:57] in his own country and his own house and
[9:59] then notice this is the verse i wanted
[10:00] to zero in on and we're just giving that
[10:03] background in and he did not many mighty
[10:05] works there because of their unbelief
[10:08] now pondered this story here's jesus
[10:10] christ he's the son of god in him dwells
[10:12] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[10:14] he's one that teaches things that are
[10:16] astonishing he's one that's performed
[10:18] mighty works and he's standing there in
[10:21] their presence and they start to
[10:22] rationalize with who he is and what his
[10:24] history is and what his background is
[10:26] and maybe they're surmising a little bit
[10:28] about his family and his family's
[10:29] attitude towards them or whatever it
[10:30] might be he says but they are offended
[10:33] and jesus now picks up on this offense
[10:36] and says the prophet has honor
[10:37] everywhere else except in his own
[10:39] country and in his own house and then
[10:41] the bible declares this jesus doesn't
[10:43] say it but the bible says he doesn't do
[10:46] many mighty works there because of their
[10:49] unbelief
[10:51] now i want to ask you this question was
[10:52] that a boundary or a barrier
[10:56] all right we got i guess i should have
[10:57] polled everybody we should do
[11:00] write your answers down there'll be a
[11:01] prize at the end so we look at this and
[11:04] you say is this a barrier or a boundary
[11:05] i think i heard a lot of barriers but it
[11:07] depends on the vantage point
[11:10] because to be to god if i could put it
[11:12] and this is just to help us understand
[11:14] barriers and boundaries how sometimes it
[11:16] can be different depending on where
[11:17] you're standing to god it was a boundary
[11:21] in other words he did not do many
[11:24] wonderful works because this is a
[11:26] boundary for god
[11:27] this is something that god would not
[11:29] cross
[11:30] and so god has said god is setting a
[11:32] marker and god has set in a parameter
[11:34] and he's saying i'm able i can do
[11:36] whatever i want but this is something
[11:38] i'm going to respect this is something
[11:40] i'm not going to cross but to those in
[11:42] nazareth their unbelief was a barrier
[11:46] so they did not experience the miracles
[11:47] they did not see the miracles they were
[11:49] not partakers in the miracle so from
[11:51] them their unbelief and what they're
[11:53] looking at there were barriers in the
[11:55] way of them enjoying and seeing more
[11:57] mighty works and so their unbelief and
[12:00] their attitudes and the questions they
[12:02] had and their offense becomes a
[12:04] hindrance
[12:06] for them it's an impediment here's the
[12:07] christ who can heal him here's the
[12:08] christ that can save him here's a christ
[12:10] that can do many mighty works and
[12:12] declare himself to be the messiah but
[12:14] there's something that withheld them and
[12:16] kept them from appreciating that
[12:18] because let's just think about it it's
[12:19] not that christ didn't have the power to
[12:21] do the miracles
[12:22] it's not that he did not have the power
[12:24] to do many many mighty works and it's
[12:26] not that unbelief is greater than god
[12:29] and it's not that their unbelief was
[12:31] just so great that he couldn't overcome
[12:33] it but it wouldn't have been right for
[12:35] christ to do it
[12:36] it wouldn't have been appropriate for
[12:38] him to operate god's power under those
[12:40] conditions
[12:41] if i could just give a quick contrast an
[12:43] example as christ is passing through the
[12:46] crowd and through this press there's one
[12:48] that kind of touches just the hem of his
[12:49] garment and his attention is caught
[12:52] and he and and jesus
[12:54] uh when he's looking at this woman
[12:56] he begins to have a conversation with
[12:58] her and she's like oh i i need this heal
[13:01] and he says well
[13:02] i'm not sent but to the lost sheep of
[13:04] israel and she's saying well
[13:05] even the
[13:06] dogs eat the crumbs from the master's
[13:08] table jesus was kind of throwing things
[13:11] out there that would have been a barrier
[13:12] to her
[13:14] he's saying things to suggest i'm just
[13:15] wanting to reference it very quickly
[13:17] this might be something that to her
[13:18] could just signal oh well i'll just go
[13:20] ahead and leave but what was it she
[13:22] declared a faith
[13:23] and she expressed something that went
[13:25] past anything that might seem to be
[13:27] hindering anything that might have been
[13:28] telling her to go the other way and it
[13:30] expanded the borders of faith and god
[13:32] says that's where i operate i operate
[13:34] within faith i operate within one that
[13:36] believes
[13:38] and so it's it wasn't it would have been
[13:40] right for christ to operate god's power
[13:43] in the presence of their offense in the
[13:45] presence of their unbelief
[13:47] that interesting
[13:49] to think that at any moment god could
[13:50] just come in our lives and completely
[13:52] change everything but he's a gentleman
[13:55] he's he's respectful of certain things
[13:58] he's mindful of certain things he he
[13:59] uses wisdom that it's not just all about
[14:01] accomplishing it but it's how you
[14:02] accomplish it
[14:04] there's things that god could do right
[14:05] now in our lives as god who can just do
[14:08] things and he and he could do it and
[14:09] since he's god and he does it in a way
[14:11] that only god can without us knowing us
[14:14] without us realizing in a supernatural
[14:16] way you realize if we if he did it the
[14:18] way we want him to we would never know
[14:19] he was god
[14:21] things would just happen
[14:23] things would just take place and you'd
[14:25] never see the fingerprints of god in it
[14:28] and so the bible says that they were
[14:30] offended in him
[14:32] the word means to put a stumbling block
[14:34] in someone's way to put an impediment in
[14:36] the way means to cause to stumble or to
[14:39] fall what was it that was a barrier
[14:41] they there was a barrier to them
[14:43] something they tripped over something
[14:45] they stumbled over now this is where it
[14:46] kind of gets you say well brother aaron
[14:48] which was it a boundary or a barrier
[14:50] where there was a boundary
[14:52] but it became a barrier
[14:55] if you think about it there are barriers
[14:57] to those in nazareth were the natural
[14:59] flesh of christ
[15:00] you see they just see a man i look in
[15:02] this guy and they say well we know your
[15:03] dad we know your mom we know your
[15:05] brothers we know your sisters and so it
[15:08] was his natural flesh it was his family
[15:10] history it was things they knew about
[15:11] him and their processes we know when you
[15:13] were born we know what the rumors were
[15:15] about your birth we know about this we
[15:17] know about that there's all these things
[15:18] that they begin to ponder and
[15:20] contemplate and it's those things that
[15:22] became the offense and it hindered them
[15:25] from seeing god and flesh
[15:27] here's the father standing amongst them
[15:29] and they're unable to see them because
[15:30] of all these things that are in the way
[15:32] and that to them was a barrier
[15:35] now to
[15:38] that i want you to just keep that in
[15:39] mind the barrier of the flesh the
[15:41] barrier of the way it's being presented
[15:42] the way the buried in a sense it's being
[15:44] manifested
[15:45] but god's boundary because to god this
[15:48] is the boundary god's boundary is his
[15:50] word
[15:51] and he operates on the principle of
[15:52] faith so that's where god works if
[15:55] you're going to find god working you're
[15:56] going to find god moving it's going to
[15:57] be within the framework of his word
[15:59] according to faith you can have the word
[16:01] there's your boundaries but it takes
[16:02] faith to ignite it there's something
[16:04] that quickens it so anything out of
[16:06] bounds won't work
[16:09] so here's christ he has the power he's
[16:11] present he's there he's teaching
[16:12] wonderful things it says in the bible
[16:14] that when he was teaching there was
[16:15] power there to heal them all and so what
[16:18] does it take to operate it then it takes
[16:20] faith so there's a boundary of god's
[16:22] word and if there's anything
[16:24] out of bounds god won't work there
[16:27] so this is where we we could take from
[16:29] this even though it says they they he
[16:31] did not do many mighty works because of
[16:34] their unbelief we have to recognize
[16:36] unbelief does not hinder god
[16:38] it hinders the unbeliever
[16:41] jesus didn't need the mighty works for
[16:43] himself he didn't need it to prove who
[16:44] he was as a matter of fact he's tempted
[16:46] many times to prove who you are if thou
[16:48] be the son of god and and show out for
[16:50] us and who hit you and who did this and
[16:53] they're always wanting him to clown
[16:54] around but god doesn't clown around for
[16:56] the devil
[16:57] and so unbelief doesn't hinder god it
[17:00] only stops the unbelievers so unbelief
[17:02] was a barrier to the unbeliever because
[17:05] god only works within the boundaries of
[17:07] faith in his word
[17:10] brother brown makes the statement in
[17:11] presume and he said sin lays beyond the
[17:14] boundaries of god's word
[17:17] to disbelieve one iota of it god will
[17:19] let you set there
[17:21] so you have the boundaries of god's word
[17:22] if you disbelieve you find yourself out
[17:24] of bounds and as long as you're in
[17:26] unbelief god will just let you stay
[17:27] there
[17:28] so your unbelief becomes the barrier
[17:30] unbelief becomes the hindrance but faith
[17:32] is what will bring remove the obstacle
[17:34] for entrance into the word of god to
[17:37] experience whatever it is god is
[17:38] promising for you
[17:40] so this is
[17:41] ponder this think about this focus very
[17:43] intent on this there is a dividing line
[17:47] this has been very helpful for me in
[17:48] pondering the difference between
[17:50] barriers and boundaries because there's
[17:51] a lot of times brother brown talks about
[17:53] denominational barriers and barriers
[17:54] that hinder fellowship and so we see one
[17:56] side well there's things that man has
[17:58] created that keeps people from being
[18:00] together but then you find another hand
[18:02] there's boundaries that god establishes
[18:03] to keep people apart
[18:06] and so the you say well how do we
[18:07] navigate that
[18:08] identify what are barriers and identify
[18:11] what are boundaries
[18:13] in second corinthians chapter 6 verse 17
[18:16] says wherefore come out from among them
[18:18] and be ye separate saith the lord
[18:21] and touch not the unclean thing and i
[18:24] will receive you it's an if then
[18:26] statement if you will come out from
[18:27] among them and be separate and touch not
[18:30] the unclean thing then i will receive
[18:32] you
[18:33] separate means to mark off by boundaries
[18:35] it means to limit if you will be limited
[18:37] if you'll be separated if you'll be
[18:39] marked off by boundaries it means to be
[18:41] set apart for a purpose
[18:43] then i will receive you
[18:45] so think of the boundaries that we're
[18:46] trying to establish god's boundaries
[18:48] what he relates to what he identifies in
[18:50] and how he makes himself known he makes
[18:52] himself known within the word of god
[18:55] brother brahm says in the message
[18:56] perseverance and i would actually
[18:58] recommend
[19:00] perseverant perseverance this this
[19:02] sermon as a
[19:04] as one to listen to as we've been drawn
[19:06] a lot from perseverance and humble
[19:07] thyself
[19:09] it says examine your revelation with the
[19:11] word if it's contrary to the word leave
[19:13] it alone
[19:14] if it's with the word god is bound duty
[19:18] bound to keep his word now
[19:20] so what is god bound to he's bound to
[19:22] his word he's not bound to your whims
[19:25] he's not bound to oh show me a sign he's
[19:27] not bound to do this and do that god is
[19:29] duty bound to his word that's the those
[19:32] are the borders and the boundaries that
[19:33] he's responsible over
[19:35] he is he he loves to be held to his word
[19:38] he loves to prove his word he he is
[19:40] obligated to his word god is bound to
[19:43] his word anything outside of his word
[19:45] he's not responsible for
[19:47] so in matthew 13 the prophet is he says
[19:51] a prophet is not without honor and
[19:52] except in his own country and in his own
[19:54] house
[19:56] and the people were offended it says
[19:57] he's not able to perform miracles
[19:59] because of their unbelief unbelief was a
[20:02] barrier to them but faith in the word of
[20:04] god is the boundary that god works
[20:06] within
[20:09] now if you turn to john chapter 1
[20:13] verses 43 to 50 i appreciate your
[20:16] attention this morning
[20:24] in john chapter 1 verses 43 to 50
[20:28] it says the day following jesus would go
[20:31] forth into galilee
[20:33] and findeth philip and saith unto him
[20:36] follow me
[20:38] now philip was a bethsaida the city of
[20:40] andrew and peter
[20:41] philip findeth nathanael and saith unto
[20:43] him we have found him of whom moses in
[20:46] the law and the prophets did right now
[20:47] this is remarkable speaking of the
[20:49] messiah prophet liken unto me jesus of
[20:52] nazareth the son of joseph and nathanael
[20:54] said unto him can there any good thing
[20:57] come out of nazareth so those in
[20:59] nazareth didn't think any good thing
[21:00] could come from that family those
[21:02] outside of nazareth didn't think any
[21:03] good thing could come from nazareth
[21:05] and says philip sayeth unto him
[21:07] wonderful words perfect words come and
[21:09] see
[21:10] we should make that part of our
[21:11] vocabulary
[21:12] not always try to make people see tell
[21:14] them to come and sing come and see the
[21:16] mighty works of god that's what it says
[21:17] on psalm come and see what god has done
[21:19] just come and see what he is doing come
[21:21] and see jesus saw nathanael coming to
[21:23] him and saith to him behold an israelite
[21:26] indeed in whom is no guile
[21:28] this that instance did more than all the
[21:31] explaining philip could have done
[21:34] just that moment in his presence the
[21:36] word of god affecting in his heart
[21:37] discerning his needs
[21:39] in that opportunity there that he said
[21:41] just come and see and and he comes says
[21:43] behold an israelite indeed in whom is no
[21:45] guile nathanael said unto him when's
[21:48] knowest thou me
[21:50] and jesus answered and said to him
[21:51] before that philip called thee when thou
[21:54] was under the fig tree i saw thee
[21:56] now that had significance to nathaniel
[21:59] that got his attention he's saying now
[22:00] this is something before i was called by
[22:03] philip this whatever it was whatever
[22:04] this uh instance was it got his
[22:07] attention and now just in this simple
[22:09] exchange
[22:11] behold an israelite in whom there's no
[22:13] guile and he says well
[22:15] how do you know me before philip called
[22:17] thee i saw you when you were under the
[22:19] fig tree just this simple instance
[22:21] nathanael answers and says unto him
[22:23] rabbi thou art the son of god thou art
[22:26] the king of israel
[22:28] when you go later into matthew chapter
[22:30] 13 later in jesus ministry he's doing a
[22:32] lot more profound things than this
[22:35] he is expounding more he's doing more a
[22:37] lot more is being expressed and declared
[22:38] but yet nathanael's just able to say
[22:40] thou art the son of god. this is a
[22:42] remarkable statement thou art the king
[22:44] of israel
[22:46] and jesus answered and said unto him
[22:48] because i said unto thee i saw thee unto
[22:50] the fig tree believeth thou
[22:53] because you believe this sign because
[22:56] you believe you truly believe that uh
[22:58] this this manifestation this expression
[23:01] he says just because i saw thee and i
[23:03] said i saw you under the fig tree you
[23:05] believe he says thou shalt see greater
[23:07] things than these
[23:09] but nathanael's already a believer
[23:12] he didn't need the greater things to
[23:13] believe but because his was quickened
[23:15] and faith was already quick and he's now
[23:18] within the boundaries of god's word he's
[23:20] now operating with the framework of the
[23:21] prophecy his eyes have already been
[23:23] opened and now that his eyes are open
[23:25] he's going to see greater things
[23:28] now christ can do greater things but
[23:31] other people not see greater things
[23:33] what was happening in matthew 18 ah well
[23:35] he's a he's a nazarene and he's of
[23:37] joseph and he's of mary and we know his
[23:39] brothers we know his children or we know
[23:41] his sisters we know what's going on here
[23:43] and they weren't impressed they were
[23:45] offended just one little miracle to
[23:47] nathanael and he's so impressed by that
[23:49] that he's quick and to to faith he's
[23:52] quickened to believe he and if i could
[23:54] put it this way because you truly
[23:56] believe you'll see greater things
[24:00] and if i could put it in this context
[24:02] nathanael could see greater things
[24:03] because he recognized god and simplicity
[24:07] because he could just recognize a simple
[24:09] manifestation of scripture because he
[24:10] could recognize god operating in the
[24:13] flesh of christ he he was he was a
[24:16] candidate he was in the position he was
[24:18] in the place to see greater things
[24:21] because if you're a skeptic no amount of
[24:23] proof is going to convince you
[24:26] hey
[24:27] someone was explaining something to me
[24:28] the other day and i think they kind of
[24:30] misrepresented they referenced the kafka
[24:32] effect and i don't think that's the
[24:33] effect they're actually thinking about
[24:34] and i don't know exact effect it's
[24:36] supposed to be but you know when someone
[24:37] believes something and you try to
[24:39] convince them it's not true your efforts
[24:41] to convince them it's not true is like
[24:43] they think that's the proof that it is
[24:45] true
[24:46] right
[24:47] well if this wasn't if this wasn't true
[24:49] you wouldn't be trying to convince me
[24:50] it's not
[24:51] right
[24:53] like how come none of us know where the
[24:54] illuminati is right because they want it
[24:56] that way
[24:58] and and so there's just a way where it's
[24:59] like circular reason and there's no way
[25:01] you can convince them and walk them out
[25:02] of it if somebody is is against
[25:05] something someone's offended then no
[25:06] matter what you do you don't see it for
[25:09] what it is
[25:11] and so on one hand you have people that
[25:12] could christ could be doing
[25:14] greater things
[25:16] and there's the skeptics there's the
[25:17] critics there there's the scoffers and
[25:19] the mockers but yeah here's a nathaniel
[25:21] that's going to see the greater things
[25:23] because he has faith
[25:25] the nazarenes couldn't see the mighty
[25:27] works because they stumbled at the
[25:28] simplicity of god's glory
[25:31] here was god in simplicity and they
[25:33] stumbled at it they couldn't enjoy it
[25:34] they couldn't appreciate it
[25:36] now
[25:37] there maybe this is a lot of scripture
[25:39] reading a lot of commentary to make this
[25:40] point but in order to understand god's
[25:43] greatness they needed to see how small
[25:45] he could become
[25:48] people want to worship a god that's huge
[25:50] and expansive and great and all-knowing
[25:52] and all-powerful but yet they don't they
[25:54] don't want to recognize him and how he
[25:56] manifest himself
[25:58] in order to begin to understand god's
[26:00] greatness as nathanael was going to see
[26:01] the greater things his ability to see
[26:03] the greater things started in just a
[26:05] very small thing
[26:07] and to begin to understand god's
[26:08] greatness you have to first be able to
[26:09] recognize how small he can become
[26:13] the omnipotent
[26:14] omniscient
[26:16] omnipresent god who fills all time in
[26:19] space
[26:21] but is bound in his word
[26:24] and binds himself to his word
[26:28] now if you could just continue to
[26:29] concentrate your spirit
[26:31] and just focus very intently
[26:34] i'm wanting you to ponder in your own
[26:36] life the barriers that keep you from
[26:37] seeing the supernatural
[26:39] now in first kings chapter 19
[26:44] and i had to veer i had to kind of
[26:47] divide my sermon
[26:50] in half and maybe next sunday we'll get
[26:52] to
[26:54] the part that i thought i would get to
[26:55] today
[26:57] but it's on humility actually it was the
[26:59] original title was perfect pride
[27:02] chew on that for a little bit perfect
[27:03] pride
[27:06] now
[27:07] we think
[27:09] recognizing barriers and boundaries is
[27:11] still at the focus here in first kings
[27:14] chapter 19.
[27:18] can you give me a loud amen
[27:21] all right okay good
[27:24] first kings chapter 19 verses 9 to 13.
[27:27] elijah has escaped from jezebel he's
[27:29] very discouraged he's
[27:31] uh
[27:32] he's under a juniper tree
[27:35] and he's uh
[27:37] even expresses his desire to die
[27:41] and he's very honest about this
[27:42] something they've been pondering quite a
[27:44] bit that uh
[27:45] we we have to be very i'm just just
[27:47] going to say we have to be very careful
[27:49] that we don't create the kind of climate
[27:51] where people can't be honest
[27:54] because they're afraid that if they're
[27:55] honest it's going to cause us to think
[27:57] oh they don't believe anymore they don't
[27:58] have faith
[28:00] and really it's a barrier that we got to
[28:01] overcome
[28:03] and it's a barrier that we don't want to
[28:04] create and elijah is honest he says it's
[28:06] enough i don't want to live i know
[28:07] better than my father's he's he's he's
[28:09] very uh weakened the journey's too great
[28:12] for me
[28:13] and the bible says that god sent the
[28:15] angel with the softest hands to minister
[28:17] to him
[28:19] now verse nine it says and he came
[28:20] elijah now has arisen
[28:23] and he goes under the of the mount
[28:24] of god and he comes thither unto a cave
[28:26] and lodged there and behold the word of
[28:28] the lord came to him
[28:30] and he said unto him what doest thou
[28:32] hear elijah so god's now speaking to
[28:34] elijah now elijah in his honesty he's
[28:37] honest before god he says he said i have
[28:39] been very jealous for the lord god of
[28:40] host for the children of israel have
[28:42] forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine
[28:45] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[28:46] sword now that's a
[28:48] elijah's recognizing how they've
[28:50] abandoned god they've violated his
[28:52] precepts and they've broken the covenant
[28:55] of god
[28:56] and i even i only am left
[28:59] and they seek my life to take it away
[29:02] and he said now god speaks go forth and
[29:05] stand upon the mount before the lord
[29:09] so now this is god's response to his
[29:11] anxiety and his fear
[29:13] his assessment of the situation we
[29:15] recognize later that
[29:18] he didn't have it exactly right he
[29:19] wasn't the only one that was still
[29:20] standing for god
[29:22] but god tells him to go forth and stand
[29:24] upon the mount before the lord i hope
[29:25] that you're focusing and concentrating
[29:27] it says and behold the lord passed by
[29:30] now god told him to go stand upon the
[29:33] mount before the lord so he told him go
[29:35] to this place and as you're standing
[29:37] there you're going to be in the presence
[29:38] of god you're going to stand before god
[29:40] and behold the lord does indeed pass by
[29:44] now recognize that he elijah is in a
[29:47] place where he needs something from god
[29:48] he needs encouragement he needs strength
[29:50] he's been very jealous for god he
[29:52] recognizes the forsaken of god's
[29:54] covenant he's come through this escaping
[29:56] from jezebel he's been very discouraged
[29:58] and
[29:59] and a broken man with the broken spirit
[30:01] and god is going to come he's going to
[30:03] present himself and says and the lord
[30:05] passed by
[30:07] and i know you know the story so just if
[30:09] you could just uh ponder this
[30:11] and a great and strong wind rent the
[30:14] mountains and break and pieces the rocks
[30:17] before the lord
[30:19] so god it says the lord passed by the
[30:21] lord's there
[30:22] and at his presence a strong wind runs
[30:25] the mountain and it breaks it into
[30:27] pieces and elijah's witnessing this
[30:30] and it says but the lord was not in the
[30:32] wind
[30:35] after the wind
[30:36] an earthquake
[30:38] now it doesn't describe
[30:41] what is actually happening when the
[30:42] earthquakes but we could imagine that if
[30:44] the wind was breaking rocks from their
[30:46] places that the earthquake was
[30:49] registering
[30:50] something that was felt but it says and
[30:52] the lord was not in the earthquake
[30:54] and after the earthquake a fire
[30:57] so you've had wind
[30:59] earthquake and you've had a fire and it
[31:01] says but the lord was not in the fire
[31:06] now we could put ourselves in elijah's
[31:07] shoes if we were there
[31:09] we would have had a revival at the wind
[31:13] we we had another one at the earthquake
[31:15] we had another one at the fire and we
[31:16] would have set up a church of the earth
[31:18] wind and fire church
[31:20] and we would have had something
[31:22] to to recognize this and to give honor
[31:26] to this and we would have been caught up
[31:27] in all the natural things happening
[31:29] around us great things significant
[31:31] things things of depth and magnitude and
[31:33] shakings and and rattlings but it says
[31:35] the lord is not in the wind the
[31:37] earthquake or fire and after the fire
[31:39] after the wind after the earthquake
[31:41] after the fire a still small voice
[31:45] and it was so when elijah heard it
[31:48] when elijah heard the still small voice
[31:50] that he wrapped his face in his mantle
[31:52] and he went out and stood in the
[31:55] entering in of the cave it's then that
[31:57] elijah's moved it's then that elijah
[31:59] reacts and behold there came a voice
[32:01] unto him and said what doest thou hear
[32:03] elijah that was god's hello
[32:06] we say what's up god's with elijah says
[32:08] what does thou hear elijah that was his
[32:10] greeting for elijah
[32:11] that's how he knew who it was what doest
[32:13] thou hear elijah
[32:15] and now we'll we'll just stop at that
[32:17] point because i've set the the picture
[32:20] hopefully the scriptures have painted
[32:21] this picture
[32:23] of how god declares that he's going to
[32:24] make himself known elijah come and
[32:26] present yourself before the lord in the
[32:28] mount
[32:29] and then a wind comes an earthquake
[32:31] comes and the fire comes and god's
[32:34] presence is there but what those are are
[32:36] the effects of his presence
[32:38] they're clearly an effect of his
[32:40] presence and there was a way to measure
[32:42] it you could measure the wind speed
[32:44] you could measure the magnitude of the
[32:46] earthquake you could have certain uh
[32:48] movements you could measure speed and
[32:50] movements and and the magnitude and the
[32:53] scales and all the different things that
[32:54] you could try to come with the
[32:55] categories of the wind there was a way
[32:57] that man could quantify and somehow
[33:01] measure what god was doing on that
[33:02] mountain
[33:03] well the wind was at so many knots or it
[33:05] was at this speed or the wind was a
[33:07] direct wind of 80 miles per hour it was
[33:08] an earthquake of a 7.6 on the rick six
[33:10] on the richter scale it was a 12 alarm
[33:13] fire however it was they would try to
[33:14] find some way to describe what god was
[33:16] doing
[33:17] why because
[33:19] men like to measure
[33:21] one of the
[33:22] funniest single panel cartoons i ever
[33:24] saw as it said the problem with all male
[33:25] juries
[33:26] and what was depicted is these men in
[33:28] the jury box building the gallows
[33:31] they had their saws out in the hammers
[33:32] and they were already getting ready to
[33:33] hang the hang the defendant because
[33:36] that's what men like to like to measure
[33:37] they like to build they like to see the
[33:38] progress they like things to be great
[33:41] but in all these great things god wasn't
[33:44] in them
[33:45] and what's if you could
[33:47] i'm sure you've heard this before but it
[33:49] says
[33:50] we know that he was in the still small
[33:54] voice
[33:55] because he's not moved by the wind
[33:58] not moved by the earthquake he doesn't
[33:59] cover himself with the earthquake he
[34:00] doesn't cover himself at the fire he
[34:02] hears a still small voice and when
[34:04] elijah heard that something he was in
[34:05] tune to it's then that he grabs his self
[34:07] and he covers himself
[34:10] the words that are used for still it's
[34:12] whisper calm
[34:14] a calm voice
[34:16] a whisper
[34:18] and then
[34:21] small it means fine like thin
[34:24] or gaunt
[34:26] this isn't something very robust what
[34:29] was it that stumbled about jesus
[34:31] he was he was a weak man he was an
[34:33] uncomely man he was a man in his 30s and
[34:35] they thought he was around 50.
[34:39] a still small fine thin gaunt voice
[34:43] that's what moved elijah
[34:45] elijah was not moved by the other things
[34:48] regardless of how moving they would be
[34:51] regardless of how fearful they would be
[34:53] surely god's going to make himself known
[34:54] in an earthquake surely this is the way
[34:56] god moves in a wind but those none of
[34:58] those things enticed him
[35:00] he was told to go to a particular place
[35:02] and stand before the presence of the
[35:03] lord and god is moving he's exciting
[35:06] things and things are happening but none
[35:07] of those enticed him to cover himself
[35:09] and present himself at the face of the
[35:11] cave because we could we could say this
[35:13] for sure the lord caused the wind he
[35:15] caused the quake he caused the fire but
[35:17] he was only found in the voice
[35:20] a lot of things that were the effect of
[35:22] his presence but he was only found in
[35:24] his word he was only found in the voice
[35:25] why because that's where god hides
[35:27] himself
[35:29] i want to show something to you in this
[35:32] slide here
[35:33] and what you're looking at is on th to
[35:35] the left is the cover
[35:37] this is what brother george and sister
[35:39] rebecca smith i published for many years
[35:41] called the only believe magazine and it
[35:44] was from the
[35:46] june 1993 issue
[35:48] volume six number two i know some of you
[35:50] probably were reading it yesterday
[35:53] but uh it's on the very back of this
[35:56] volume is what i have it's it was
[35:58] printed on the very back is what's on
[36:00] the right here i don't know if you could
[36:02] read it but i'm going to read it to you
[36:03] but these were
[36:05] taken this was printed here from brother
[36:07] branham's handwritten notes for a sermon
[36:09] entitled the glory of the lord
[36:12] and brother branham took you know he
[36:14] wrote out his sermons in some instances
[36:16] very specific precise things that he
[36:18] wants to wanted to share and i was
[36:20] amazed to find out that very few of his
[36:22] sermon notes preserved or they've been
[36:24] able to find but this was a sermon he
[36:26] never preached but he had this
[36:27] handwritten notes that they had
[36:29] had kept i think the on display at the
[36:32] den there in tucson for many years
[36:34] but notice what brother bannon wrote he
[36:36] says notice him elijah in the cave
[36:39] the oneness storm billy graham earth
[36:42] shaking campaigns
[36:44] oral roberts the pentecostal rushing
[36:46] wind
[36:47] never moved the prophet
[36:49] as i did to find great moves great
[36:51] manifestations it's the effects of his
[36:53] presence it's god doing these things but
[36:55] what's going to move the prophet catch
[36:57] what he says they were only a facts of
[37:00] his passing by
[37:01] but what attracted the prophet elijah
[37:05] it was the glory of his voice word
[37:09] revealing his glory plans
[37:12] now if we read we read still small voice
[37:15] still
[37:16] whisper calm gaunt thin voice
[37:19] and yet it's described as the glory of
[37:21] his voice word on one hand it doesn't
[37:24] seem profound on one hand it doesn't
[37:26] seem remarkable on one hand it's a quiet
[37:29] whisper it's finn it's gaunt it's frail
[37:31] it seems weak but yet from another
[37:33] perspective it is the glory of his voice
[37:36] word elijah recognized the glory of
[37:38] something very small
[37:41] it's the glory of his voice word
[37:42] revealing his glory plans he says the
[37:44] prophet waited on his office we could
[37:47] take that to ourselves there's something
[37:49] there's a place that we're called
[37:51] there's something that we're to do and
[37:52] we're to be active in it and faithful in
[37:54] it and not to vary from it in other
[37:56] words the prophet wasn't moved by winds
[37:59] he wasn't moved by earthquakes he wasn't
[38:01] moved by fires he knew that for him he
[38:03] had to hear the voice of god in order to
[38:05] move
[38:10] the prophet waited on his office and
[38:12] then notice as a type
[38:14] not long then to the rapture
[38:17] this is instructive to us he said he was
[38:18] only nearing the wind earthquake fire
[38:20] etc the man of god waited for manifested
[38:24] reality vindicated word abiding glory
[38:27] our remarkable words
[38:30] what remarkable words to ponder that
[38:32] what attracted elijah
[38:34] was something still
[38:37] small but yet it was the voice of god
[38:40] no matter how much of a whisper no
[38:42] matter how thin or gaunt since it was
[38:44] the word it got his attention
[38:47] this i hope that you're
[38:48] pondering and i've been using that word
[38:50] a lot today pondering i hope you're
[38:52] thinking about the barriers to seeing
[38:54] the supernatural
[38:55] because what are we somehow programmed
[38:57] something great
[39:00] and and we can all blame uh
[39:02] apple for this right is it john ives is
[39:05] he was he the designer there for many
[39:06] years that produced things that are so
[39:08] highly polished and well made and and
[39:11] it's just it's eye candy
[39:13] right it's like iphone i want
[39:16] eye candy yes because it looks good and
[39:18] it's pleasing to the eye and it's
[39:20] presented in a certain certain way
[39:22] and i'm not presenting it as the
[39:24] forbidden fruit even though it is an
[39:25] apple with a bite out of it
[39:27] but there's something that we're wired
[39:29] to want to mention it before and this is
[39:31] kind of where we're hopefully getting
[39:32] into we're wired to compare and we're
[39:34] measuring ourselves by what other things
[39:36] appear to be to us
[39:39] and in each one of these instances if
[39:41] you think about it there's certain
[39:42] mechanisms that people are judging
[39:44] things by in measuring things by and
[39:47] looking for god wanting to see god but
[39:49] yet in the framework of it god is only
[39:51] known a particular way
[39:54] and in in the example in first kings 19
[39:58] we have to be honest with ourselves what
[40:01] would get our attention
[40:04] something big
[40:06] something flashy something engaging
[40:08] something very inviting maybe something
[40:10] that satisfies and checks the box
[40:12] socially or checks the bosch the box
[40:14] emotionally things that that would be
[40:15] pleasing to the flesh
[40:18] but elijah
[40:20] recognized god in his word
[40:24] now this may seem to be a paradox the
[40:25] way i'm going to describe this and i'm
[40:27] just turning my corner here to to get to
[40:29] my clothes
[40:31] we'll have power over barriers by
[40:33] recognizing and respecting the
[40:35] boundaries of god's word
[40:37] the only way we're truly going to have
[40:38] power over barriers we'll have power
[40:40] over barriers when we recognize and
[40:42] respect the boundaries of god's word
[40:45] just as elijah
[40:47] he waited on his office he stayed in his
[40:49] place the only way that we're going to
[40:51] overcome berries is know where our place
[40:52] is
[40:54] now let me just put it this way
[40:56] if you know you're not in your place but
[40:58] you're called to it
[40:59] and if there's something keeping you
[41:00] from it then you know that's something
[41:02] you have to get over to get there
[41:04] but once you're in your place you want
[41:06] to keep your place
[41:08] and if there's things trying to call you
[41:10] out of your place then you recognize no
[41:12] there's a boundary this is where i
[41:13] belong this is what i'm called to i
[41:15] can't i can't i can't be pulled out from
[41:17] this place elijah was going there on
[41:19] that mountain in order to have an
[41:21] audience with god and if he would have
[41:22] ran after the wind and chased the wind
[41:24] trying to find the source of the wind
[41:25] where are these rocks leading me if he
[41:27] tried to divine something in the tea
[41:28] leaves as it were as the earth was quake
[41:30] was shaking if he tried to figure
[41:32] something out and if i stare long enough
[41:34] at the fire maybe i'll recognize the
[41:35] word he would have been he would have
[41:36] been out of place
[41:40] and if i could put it in this context or
[41:42] if i hope that this makes sense to you
[41:44] because i like to say it this way
[41:46] the devil wants the word of god to
[41:48] appear to us very differently than what
[41:50] it really is
[41:52] he wants the word of god to look like
[41:54] bondage
[41:56] so here we are we're we're free we can
[41:58] make choices we can live as we want we
[41:59] live in a society where we have rights
[42:01] we can exercise those rights
[42:03] and so what he wants what's the word to
[42:05] become is we want he wants us to look at
[42:07] the word as something that's limiting
[42:10] something that restrains us
[42:13] and i recognize that the bible
[42:15] christianity even the words of christ or
[42:17] we can say the word of god has been used
[42:18] to abuse people it's been used to
[42:20] marginalize certain sections of society
[42:23] whether it be races or ethnicities or
[42:25] gender it's been used to justify evil
[42:27] it's been used to bind people come on
[42:30] somebody
[42:32] all you got to do is be take an honest
[42:34] look at church history and honest look
[42:35] at history and people have bible thumped
[42:38] to commit many many atrocities
[42:41] and so the the word of god and
[42:43] christianity in that sense carries a
[42:44] scarlet letter and for a lot of people
[42:46] maybe it's triggering because christ has
[42:48] been used for um for ungodly things
[42:52] and i recognize that the word of god has
[42:53] been used to abuse and to hinder and
[42:55] restrain and to control but god's word
[42:58] is liberating
[43:00] and it's truth it's liberating it's
[43:01] truth it's freedom you shall know the
[43:03] truth and the truth shall make you free
[43:06] we use the example quite a bit here that
[43:08] israel wanted freedom from the romans
[43:10] but what was greater than freedom from
[43:11] the romans was freedom from sin freedom
[43:13] from self and the word of god provides
[43:16] that
[43:17] a man free from sin can live in just
[43:20] about any condition
[43:22] but man wants to remedy just about any
[43:24] condition and not worry about sin
[43:26] but the word of god is so liberating the
[43:29] word of god is so liberating that once
[43:31] you get into the word of god and the
[43:32] word starts unfolding and the word
[43:34] starts breaking upon your heart and you
[43:35] start taking responsibility for the
[43:37] things that god has given you
[43:38] responsibility over and you start living
[43:40] according to the precepts of the word of
[43:42] god and it gets richer and richer to you
[43:44] the less politics means to you
[43:47] the less you're worried about
[43:48] controlling everybody else and we're
[43:51] voting for this and
[43:52] uh being an activist for that and
[43:55] campaigning for this and campaigning for
[43:56] that why because you're free from it
[44:02] but satan paints a false image
[44:06] there's a phrase i think that's used
[44:07] quite often these days is people being
[44:09] uncomfortable in their own skin
[44:12] you don't think the devil wants to make
[44:13] you feel uncomfortable
[44:16] he wants you to feel uncomfortable so
[44:17] that he could present to you a remedy
[44:19] for
[44:20] it i've got something for that you don't
[44:23] you don't feel like that's the real you
[44:25] you don't feel like you feel
[44:26] uncomfortable he's like he's got a way
[44:27] to try to make you fit and find your
[44:29] place
[44:31] but the only place you're going to find
[44:33] liberty is in the word of god
[44:37] and when god has boundaries those
[44:38] boundaries are not for the purpose of
[44:40] being controlled
[44:42] boundaries are not for the purpose of
[44:43] being constrained
[44:45] but for the purpose of operating true
[44:47] power
[44:49] god had a boundary in matthew 13 that
[44:51] when he he's standing there with power
[44:53] to heal them all he does not cross the
[44:56] boundary of faith into unbelief
[44:59] if you don't believe he's not going to
[45:00] operate
[45:02] he's going gonna let you stay there in
[45:03] unbelief if i could say it this way it
[45:05] means it may seem odd to put it this way
[45:07] but out of respect for your unbelief
[45:10] well if you don't believe i'm not gonna
[45:11] force myself on you i'm not gonna force
[45:13] this issue so it hinders the unbeliever
[45:16] it's a barrier to the unbeliever and so
[45:18] god's word it's with it has boundaries
[45:21] so that true power can operate
[45:23] now in genesis chapter two some of you
[45:25] probably thinking how in the world is he
[45:28] gonna get to genesis chapter two well
[45:29] you just go there
[45:31] right you don't have to try to make it
[45:32] fit you just go there and people like oh
[45:34] yeah that's his text
[45:37] genesis chapter 2 verses 16 and 17
[45:41] and the lord god commanded the man
[45:43] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[45:45] mayest freely eat
[45:48] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[45:50] and evil thou shalt not eat of it
[45:52] from the day that thou eatest thereof
[45:54] thou shalt surely die
[45:55] i know we're very familiar with the
[45:57] scripture reading it's not something
[45:59] that is strange to us when we read it if
[46:02] you read in the creation
[46:04] uh in the very precise words that moses
[46:07] uses
[46:09] if it grew out of the ground it was good
[46:10] for food
[46:12] it's what the bible says and god
[46:14] reiterates of every tree of the garden
[46:16] thou mayest freely eat if it grows out
[46:17] of the ground it's good for food but
[46:19] there's a tree of the knowledge of good
[46:21] and evil that they're not to eat of and
[46:22] so we could take it scripturally and
[46:24] recognize that this is not your typical
[46:26] tree or your literal tree that grew from
[46:28] the ground
[46:29] and god declares we recognize it's in
[46:32] symbolism and it's used in ways to
[46:34] convey to us uh certain things and
[46:36] certain truths it says but in that day
[46:38] that you eat of that tree you're going
[46:40] to die and so god's not playing a trick
[46:43] on us if it grows from the ground it's
[46:44] good for food you can eat it but then if
[46:47] you eat it and you die it must not be
[46:48] growing from the ground
[46:50] that's just taking it directly from the
[46:51] bible
[46:52] now we know that man was made in the
[46:54] image of god we find these things just
[46:56] being expressed very near to this
[46:58] scripture
[46:59] and he was given power to subdue and
[47:01] have dominion
[47:04] over the earth genesis 1 26 let them
[47:07] have dominion over all the earth and as
[47:09] you read it over every living thing
[47:11] this is god now creating man in the
[47:13] image of god and they're to have
[47:15] dominion over all the earth and over
[47:17] every living thing
[47:19] so in one way we're reading about adam
[47:21] wow adam's being placed on earth and
[47:23] everything is his
[47:25] he can he's to subdue the earth he's to
[47:27] multiply he's to fill it up he's to
[47:30] subdue it he's had the dominion over it
[47:32] he's to control everything he has power
[47:34] over all the other kingdoms he is at the
[47:36] highest order and he can control all
[47:38] nature he's given power and he's given
[47:40] wisdom to name all creatures and all
[47:42] creation he can take of any herb any
[47:44] fruit
[47:45] he even has a power over the animals the
[47:48] whole world was his you heard the phrase
[47:50] the world your oyster
[47:52] the world was adam's oyster the entire
[47:54] thing every bit of it it was his he can
[47:56] live in it he could control it but then
[47:58] this is an odd scripture genesis 2 16
[48:00] and 17.
[48:02] you're just you have power to subdue you
[48:04] you could take anything you can have
[48:06] anything you want
[48:07] but then god's boundary line is set
[48:10] in genesis chapter 2 verses 16 and 17
[48:12] this is god's boundary line for man and
[48:14] the woman
[48:15] and if you read everything god has said
[48:17] to this point and even some of the
[48:18] things you read afterwards you'd think
[48:19] well this seems to limit adam's power
[48:22] adam you can have everything you want
[48:24] except
[48:25] adam you have power to subdue everything
[48:27] but this and you have unlimited power
[48:29] except it is limited
[48:31] that's not
[48:32] how when we read it it might seem to
[48:34] limit his power might just seem to kind
[48:36] of restrict his life or or to reduce his
[48:38] dominion but it's not doing it in any
[48:40] way
[48:41] i want you to i i hope that you can
[48:43] think about this again i keep saying it
[48:45] over focus ponder concentrate think
[48:47] about these things
[48:48] that what might seem to take adam's
[48:51] domain and his jurisdiction and shrink
[48:54] it up it had nothing to do with limiting
[48:57] his power
[48:59] this was not a boundary intending to
[49:00] limit man's ability this was not a
[49:02] boundary he intended to handcuff adam
[49:04] and it wasn't meant to limit his ability
[49:07] to subdue and have dominion
[49:09] but it was meant it was placed there in
[49:11] order to keep man in his place
[49:14] the boundary was set there god's
[49:15] boundary line was put there in order
[49:17] that man would stay in his place in
[49:19] order to fulfill all his potential
[49:22] he's given a command multiply and
[49:24] replenisher be fruitful multiply and
[49:25] replenish the earth subdue it have
[49:27] dominion over it do all this but he had
[49:29] to stay who he was
[49:31] and he had to he had to remain with his
[49:35] wife
[49:36] under the word of god and the woman in
[49:38] order to fulfill the word of god he
[49:40] couldn't step outside of the framework
[49:42] that god had established and fulfill his
[49:44] purpose
[49:46] remember god is the god of order
[49:48] and when god is creating and the world
[49:50] is without form and it's it's void i'm
[49:52] glad i brought the notes from wednesday
[49:53] night let's stand let's read from
[49:54] genesis chapter one
[49:56] we'll just re-preach wednesday night god
[49:58] is a god of order and he he he's gonna
[50:00] bring uh structure and formation out of
[50:03] chaos and he moves the seas to one side
[50:06] and he brings up the dry land and he
[50:07] hangs the moon in the sky and it's gonna
[50:09] stand there's the watchdog and it's
[50:11] going to have a power and exert a force
[50:13] to control tides in order to keep
[50:15] ecosystems working and the bible tells
[50:17] us that god told the ocean stop you can
[50:20] only go so far
[50:21] he's a god of boundaries he told each
[50:23] seed to bring forth of its kind he he
[50:26] described things in a particular way he
[50:27] says you're herb yielding seed you're a
[50:29] fruit-bearing seed you're this animal
[50:31] you're this plant everybody stay in your
[50:34] lane stay in your place bring forth of
[50:36] your kind and everything will operate
[50:38] perfectly
[50:40] and so man had to do the same thing in
[50:42] order for god's kingdom to flourish
[50:46] this was god's wisdom
[50:48] it wasn't like god just dumped a bunch
[50:50] of materials out there and said yeah
[50:52] adam hey whatever you want to do man
[50:54] whatever you want to do
[50:56] and think about all the different places
[50:58] where god asks men to build something to
[50:59] do something and how precise god gets
[51:02] have you ever read the construction of
[51:04] the temple the tabernacle in the
[51:05] wilderness
[51:06] i mean the rings and the colors and and
[51:10] the
[51:10] everything it's like this is
[51:12] this is home interiors before there was
[51:14] home interiors
[51:15] i mean this is detailed this is precise
[51:17] it's like god didn't say hey just build
[51:19] me a box man make it seven by seven by
[51:22] seven just give me a place to hang uh
[51:24] and and it'll all be good he's so
[51:26] detailed i want it's measured so much i
[51:29] want it made with this kind of wood he
[51:30] didn't say hey no build me a boat make
[51:32] it big
[51:34] he gave him all the details here's the
[51:36] blueprints here are the materials pitch
[51:38] it with this build it this wide build it
[51:40] this one because god is a god of
[51:42] precision it got a details well why did
[51:44] it have to be that way he knew what it
[51:45] would take to float
[51:48] he knew what it would take to house the
[51:49] animals that he would ordain to be on
[51:51] that ark this is god's wisdom so when
[51:53] god told noah how to build the ark no
[51:55] good you're just ruining my fun i want
[51:57] to build a speedboat
[51:59] it's the wisdom of god and when he told
[52:01] adam adam whatever you do don't eat of
[52:03] that tree it wasn't i'm going why can't
[52:05] i have it why can't i have it i want to
[52:08] have that tree no there's a wisdom of
[52:10] god saying if you want to be who you are
[52:13] you want to fulfill my word you want to
[52:14] live happy you never want to die don't
[52:16] do it that's what we start telling our
[52:19] kids you wanna live huh you wanna you
[52:20] don't wanna die then don't do it son
[52:23] are you threatening to kill me well
[52:26] implications
[52:30] it's intended to keep a man in that spot
[52:32] where god could bless him
[52:35] to keep him from that place in matthew
[52:37] 13 of offense
[52:39] mighty works unable to be done
[52:42] so in genesis chapter 3 verses 1 to 6 it
[52:44] says now the serpent was more subtle
[52:45] than any beast of the field which the
[52:47] lord god had made
[52:48] is such a
[52:51] jerking the needle off the record like
[52:54] what like we're just reading creation
[52:56] it's wonderful man and the women are
[52:57] both naked and not ashamed was now the
[52:59] serpent was
[53:01] because this is where it gets real
[53:03] more subtle than any of the filled with
[53:04] the lord god had made and he said unto
[53:06] the woman
[53:07] yea hath god said you shall not eat of
[53:09] every tree of the garden
[53:12] and the woman said unto the serpent now
[53:13] i want you to consider boundaries
[53:18] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[53:19] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[53:21] garden
[53:22] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[53:24] the midst of the garden she even knows
[53:25] there's a difference right
[53:26] god said you shall not eat of it neither
[53:28] shall you touch it lest ye die
[53:31] a lot of commentators note the curious
[53:33] edition of neither shall you touch it
[53:35] because it's not mentioned before
[53:37] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[53:39] shall not surely die
[53:42] there's your lie
[53:43] but then notice how he frames it for god
[53:46] doth know that in the day he eat thereof
[53:49] then your eyes shall be opened he shall
[53:52] be as gods knowing good and
[53:55] and this is all it took
[53:58] in that moment
[53:59] she believed the devil's lie over god's
[54:02] word
[54:03] and in that moment what does she do she
[54:04] steps across a boundary
[54:07] immediately she stepped across a
[54:08] boundary and the woman saw that the tree
[54:10] was good for food
[54:12] it wasn't
[54:14] you eat it you die it's not good for
[54:15] food and that it was pleasant to the
[54:17] eyes when it speaks of the trees of the
[54:19] garden being pleasant to the sight it
[54:21] means it looks like it's good to eat but
[54:23] here the very phrase pleasant to the
[54:25] eyes means she lusted
[54:27] has nothing to do with oh that's that
[54:29] pie looks good has something to do with
[54:30] inner spirits she was lusting and a tree
[54:32] to be desired to make one wise she took
[54:35] of the fruit thereof and did eat and
[54:38] gave all so under a husband with her and
[54:40] he did eat
[54:42] i'd like to spend more time on this but
[54:43] this is not
[54:44] the focus of our sermon
[54:47] but this is the description of the
[54:48] original sin
[54:51] put
[54:52] uh in just very simplistic terms it's a
[54:54] disturbance of god's original plan
[54:57] god had an order he had a program he had
[54:59] everything in its place and this was a
[55:01] disturbance of god's original order and
[55:03] in do and what happened is there was a
[55:06] transgression of boundaries
[55:09] look as seen in the allegory of here's a
[55:11] fruit you can't eat it god's saying you
[55:13] can eat everything you want but this now
[55:15] just in that simple allegory god had
[55:17] placed a boundary
[55:19] that you're not to eat of this fruit
[55:21] now there's a lot of people that
[55:23] sincerely believe that god just put this
[55:25] really good looking piece of fruit in
[55:28] the middle of the garden just said you
[55:30] can eat everything you want except that
[55:32] really
[55:32] nice looking apple right there like does
[55:35] that not look good don't you want to eat
[55:37] that but don't
[55:39] right if you don't want someone to look
[55:40] at something don't say don't look now
[55:42] but because what's the first thing
[55:43] you're gonna do what
[55:46] and so god's not tempting them that's
[55:48] not how god works
[55:49] god's not trying to abate them into
[55:51] transgression he's not like now don't
[55:53] touch it but you want to touch it don't
[55:55] you but don't you you want to don't you
[55:57] don't do it that's not how god is
[56:00] he's expressing something about his
[56:02] order he's expressing something about
[56:03] his character he's expressing something
[56:05] about the seeds he's expressing
[56:07] something about his his characteristics
[56:10] and so he's he's showing them that this
[56:11] is your bounds this is what you're made
[56:14] to do this is how you're made to bring
[56:16] forth you're to create and and to bring
[56:18] forth according to my word in my time in
[56:21] my season and you're not to do it in any
[56:23] other way it's god defining the
[56:25] parameters of the expression of the word
[56:28] of god and what happened is the man and
[56:30] the woman transgressed god's boundary
[56:35] there was a transgression there was a
[56:36] mixing
[56:38] and think of it this way
[56:40] now one thing to kind of
[56:41] uh maybe help to
[56:44] think about this discourse
[56:47] the woman is talking to the serpent
[56:50] and talking to the serpent it might not
[56:51] have been a strange thing
[56:54] for them to have a conversation with the
[56:55] serpent
[56:56] so it's not like the devil you know he
[56:58] he wore a red suit with a fork towel and
[57:01] a pitchfork and started speaking in a
[57:03] very you know evil voice to her and she
[57:06] should have been shocked and pearl
[57:07] clutching and ran away
[57:09] this is this is the conversation with
[57:11] the serpent but who's animating him
[57:13] who's inspiring
[57:15] the serpent doesn't respect boundaries
[57:17] what was satan trying to do
[57:19] he was trying to tear down a boundary
[57:22] and this enticement to the woman if you
[57:25] think about it versus what elijah did on
[57:26] the in mount horeb
[57:28] this enticement beyond beyond a boundary
[57:31] was death
[57:33] go beyond this border is not life it's
[57:35] death
[57:36] one thing i find that when it comes to
[57:38] god's word the only thing for you on the
[57:40] other side of god's word is judgment
[57:42] once you've crossed the bounds of god's
[57:44] word once you've crossed the borders of
[57:45] god's word once you've crossed the
[57:46] boundary of god's word it's judgment
[57:48] consequence
[57:49] this is what we need to be learning as
[57:51] christians why is it i'm suffering why
[57:53] is there a consequence well when you
[57:55] cross god's word there's a consequence
[57:59] if you're in god's word and you're
[58:00] suffering there's a purpose
[58:02] right if you're outside of god's word
[58:04] there's a consequence we're recognizing
[58:06] that one there's a boundary of god's
[58:07] word there's a boundary of god's
[58:08] blessing there's a way that god's saying
[58:10] you can all there's you can't go past
[58:11] that my blessings won't extend beyond
[58:13] that
[58:15] now if i could just uh
[58:16] try to summarize this by just making
[58:18] this story even uh amplifying it more to
[58:22] you
[58:23] as the serpent is speaking to the woman
[58:26] satan is making the case to the woman
[58:29] and the serpent presents to the woman
[58:32] god presents god's word to the woman as
[58:35] a barrier
[58:36] can you catch that
[58:38] think about how he described him he's
[58:40] saying that that oh no you're not going
[58:42] to die
[58:43] in other words you can eat this and live
[58:46] so what became a barrier to her eating
[58:48] that was this thought that she was gonna
[58:50] die
[58:52] so if he could just somehow remove this
[58:54] thought oh you're not gonna die no
[58:56] he just said that to you to keep you
[58:58] from eating it but you're not really
[59:00] gonna die so he took the word of god
[59:01] that said you would die which would have
[59:03] formed a boundary
[59:04] and he makes the woman see it as a
[59:06] barrier
[59:08] he said he now she's looking at as an
[59:11] obstacle
[59:12] like wait a minute
[59:14] i i should eat this i have no reason not
[59:17] to because if i eat it i'm not gonna die
[59:19] i'm actually become more wise
[59:21] and i'm a no good from evil and he's and
[59:23] it's presented to her like god knows
[59:25] that too so he's trying to keep you from
[59:27] it he's trying to borrow you from he's
[59:28] put up an obstacle
[59:30] so now what god put as a boundary
[59:33] for the woman to stay in her place and
[59:35] become the means by which the earth
[59:38] would be multiplied she that adam's seed
[59:40] would multiply bring forth another son
[59:42] of god in the image of adam and to to
[59:45] fill up the earth and fulfill god's
[59:46] purpose in the earth she's now that was
[59:48] a boundary of the promise satan's got
[59:52] her to view it as a barrier
[59:55] and god hiding himself in simplicity
[59:57] brother bam says and he fortified the
[59:58] church by the word his own word
[1:00:01] he just asked them to believe his word
[1:00:03] that's all there was and satan by his
[1:00:05] own wisdom
[1:00:07] caused eve to break down that barrier
[1:00:09] just in one place
[1:00:12] now in a moment i'll express it in this
[1:00:15] way
[1:00:16] i'll kind of expound upon it but now god
[1:00:20] brother branham says that eve broke down
[1:00:22] a barrier
[1:00:24] in just one place
[1:00:26] you mean what does it matter if just one
[1:00:28] thing just one thing
[1:00:31] well it's there for a purpose
[1:00:36] the woman
[1:00:37] now
[1:00:38] he caused the woman to break down that
[1:00:41] barrier the woman was made to see the
[1:00:43] word as a barrier
[1:00:45] so then what do you do if it's a barrier
[1:00:47] you
[1:00:48] get past it
[1:00:50] if it's a barrier you want to break
[1:00:52] through it if it's a barrier you want to
[1:00:54] turn it tear it down i'll just use it in
[1:00:57] the next service
[1:00:58] hopefully or next couple services i can
[1:01:00] run through a troop and leap over a wall
[1:01:03] by my god in the image of god i'm made
[1:01:05] to overcome barriers
[1:01:07] i'm made to overcome obstacles i can i
[1:01:10] can run through it i can leap over it i
[1:01:11] can i can fly over it tunnel through it
[1:01:13] whatever it takes i can get beyond it
[1:01:14] why because with the spirit of god in me
[1:01:16] i'm made to conquer i'm made to overcome
[1:01:19] but the boundaries of god's word are
[1:01:21] what you exist within
[1:01:24] that's your reality those are your
[1:01:25] bounds that's that's that's where life
[1:01:27] is but the woman is made to see the word
[1:01:30] not as a boundary that she exists within
[1:01:32] but now she's her understanding is
[1:01:34] perverted so now she sees it as a
[1:01:36] barrier so she broke past the boundary
[1:01:39] thinking it's a barrier and what does
[1:01:40] she tumble into sin
[1:01:44] she's deceived into thinking that the
[1:01:46] word was a limit
[1:01:48] it was restricting
[1:01:50] it was something holding her back
[1:01:53] in the message the seventh seal brother
[1:01:54] bam says satan and his angels were
[1:01:56] kicked out
[1:01:57] and then they come to the earth and the
[1:01:58] battle set in again
[1:02:01] because eve broke down the barrier for
[1:02:03] where she was isolated behind the word
[1:02:05] of god
[1:02:06] something that was protecting or
[1:02:08] something keeping her and from that very
[1:02:09] hour satan won the battle over god's
[1:02:11] word because one of his subjects the god
[1:02:13] subject the weaker let down the bar
[1:02:17] so
[1:02:19] i think the language he's using is
[1:02:20] beautiful because it's painted the
[1:02:22] picture that god's word or if i say this
[1:02:25] god's boundary was a protection for the
[1:02:27] woman
[1:02:29] and a barrier to satan
[1:02:32] the word was there as a boundary for the
[1:02:34] for the creation to live within in
[1:02:36] safety and harmony and everything
[1:02:38] perfect and so that was a boundary for
[1:02:40] the woman but what did satan view it as
[1:02:43] a barrier
[1:02:44] what was a boundary for the woman was a
[1:02:46] barrier to satan it was barring him it
[1:02:48] was keeping him out and she let down the
[1:02:51] bar to her it's a boundary but once she
[1:02:53] goes beyond the boundary saying like
[1:02:55] that was the only thing keeping me away
[1:02:57] that was the only thing keeping me from
[1:02:59] you
[1:03:00] remember this for next time boundaries
[1:03:02] marks your marked jurisdictions whether
[1:03:04] it be a city whether it be a a piece of
[1:03:07] property or a government uh jurisdiction
[1:03:10] is what is the extent of one's power a
[1:03:12] boundary says my power comes to this far
[1:03:15] when you when you pas when some of you
[1:03:17] if you told me your stories you pass a
[1:03:18] cop on the freeway and you know you're
[1:03:20] just coming up to buckeye and you're
[1:03:21] just leaving phoenix like if i could
[1:03:22] just get to the boundary line
[1:03:24] he can't follow me here well i don't
[1:03:26] even know if you really know the law on
[1:03:27] that so don't drive too fast they might
[1:03:29] have just caused to follow you
[1:03:30] but there's because we have in this mind
[1:03:32] well the cops his authority is only good
[1:03:34] to this line and your authority is only
[1:03:35] good to this and what department are you
[1:03:37] in oh you're in marketing well i'm in
[1:03:39] sales you don't have any control over me
[1:03:42] right and i'm marketing rc glow and you
[1:03:46] can't stop me
[1:03:47] there's a there's a there's these
[1:03:49] boundaries that people want to cross and
[1:03:51] pass and say oh i can't i can't i don't
[1:03:53] have authority
[1:03:55] that's not in my jurisdiction that's not
[1:03:57] in my department that's not under my
[1:03:58] purview some people said i i don't i
[1:04:00] don't i'm not paid enough that's not
[1:04:02] that's not in my salary that's not what
[1:04:03] i'm asked to do just think of it in
[1:04:05] those terms that someone the extent of
[1:04:07] one's power and authority and
[1:04:09] responsibility satan is whispering to
[1:04:12] her trying to get her to step out of
[1:04:13] sight of her authority
[1:04:17] oh my
[1:04:18] as i see the picture in my mind he can
[1:04:20] only have access to the woman if she
[1:04:22] crossed god's boundary line
[1:04:25] he can only walk up and down the
[1:04:26] boundary
[1:04:28] he could only look in
[1:04:31] and he i can't get there
[1:04:33] and and the and the serpent may be being
[1:04:35] inspired by devil hey you should go do
[1:04:37] some dirty work he's like how in the
[1:04:39] world am i going to do it
[1:04:40] there's nothing i can do i've been made
[1:04:41] a particular way this is who i am i
[1:04:43] can't do anything about it and he knew
[1:04:45] the only way he could ever get access is
[1:04:47] to get hurt across god's boundary line
[1:04:50] it's in the masterpiece brother man says
[1:04:52] by deceit he crawls under the garden
[1:04:54] walls
[1:04:55] and then he marred this beautiful
[1:04:56] masterpiece
[1:04:58] why is that image used because for satan
[1:05:00] the boundary was a barrier keeping him
[1:05:02] out
[1:05:03] it was an obstacle saying you can't do
[1:05:05] this
[1:05:06] you can't go that far
[1:05:10] in the message the seat of discrepancy
[1:05:15] now this harvest time at the beginning
[1:05:18] because it's it's orienting us the
[1:05:20] harvest time we're in now comparison to
[1:05:22] the beginning when god sowed his seed
[1:05:23] upon the earth and gave it in the hearts
[1:05:25] of his children his family to keep the
[1:05:26] word that was their only defense keep
[1:05:29] that word
[1:05:30] here come the enemy in and broke that
[1:05:33] barrier by sowing the seeded discrepancy
[1:05:36] contrary to the word of god
[1:05:38] if that was discrepancy in the beginning
[1:05:41] it's still
[1:05:43] anything that will add to it that'll add
[1:05:45] anything to the word of god is still the
[1:05:47] seed of discrepancy i don't care where
[1:05:49] it comes from let this sink in
[1:05:52] if it's from organization if it's from
[1:05:53] military sources if it's from political
[1:05:56] powers
[1:05:57] this is my commentary your favorite blog
[1:05:59] or your homeschool form or whatever it
[1:06:01] is
[1:06:03] think about it it doesn't matter if it's
[1:06:05] from military sources political powers
[1:06:07] especially if it's from facebook
[1:06:09] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:06:11] god is the seat of discrepancy
[1:06:13] why is it as believers were so quickly
[1:06:16] drawn sides by things that have nothing
[1:06:19] to do with the word of god
[1:06:23] the devil's just over there
[1:06:25] trying to get us offside trying to get
[1:06:26] us to jump trying to get us to move guys
[1:06:28] god's given us something perfect to
[1:06:30] enjoy god's given us perfect peace
[1:06:33] perfect understanding perfect love he's
[1:06:35] given us everything in perfection he's
[1:06:37] given us the word of god to enjoy and
[1:06:39] we're always like huh what
[1:06:41] and we're drawing all sides to other
[1:06:43] things and we're led astray why because
[1:06:45] if the devil can just get us outside the
[1:06:47] boundaries of the word of god
[1:06:50] he can wreak havoc in our minds and in
[1:06:51] our thoughts
[1:06:53] doesn't matter if it's organization
[1:06:54] military political anything that's
[1:06:56] contra the word of god is the seed of
[1:06:58] discrepancy why god bro the the the
[1:07:01] devil uses the seeds of discrepancy to
[1:07:04] tear down the boundaries
[1:07:09] and satan wants us go ahead brother
[1:07:11] micah brother
[1:07:12] mike if you could come satan wants us he
[1:07:14] wants us if he can accomplish one thing
[1:07:16] he wants us to perceive god's word
[1:07:17] boundary as a barrier
[1:07:20] to entice us to break it down
[1:07:23] the boundary defined adam's
[1:07:24] responsibility
[1:07:27] and it it just it defined the limits of
[1:07:29] god's protective covenant
[1:07:33] god's covenant with them wasn't wow hey
[1:07:35] you're my son do whatever you want
[1:07:37] have at it hey yeah that's not what i
[1:07:39] wanted that wasn't my original plan but
[1:07:41] just do whatever you want
[1:07:43] god had a covenant he had made with them
[1:07:46] and free moral agency gave the woman an
[1:07:48] opportunity to go outside of god's
[1:07:50] boundary
[1:07:52] it's amazing to think
[1:07:55] that god put everything in its place
[1:07:58] and gave them a power
[1:08:00] and really
[1:08:02] for most most of creation
[1:08:05] and if i could say all of creation there
[1:08:07] was only one way they could act
[1:08:11] by the life that was inside of them
[1:08:14] you look at plant life and it still
[1:08:15] exists today that there's a life in that
[1:08:17] seed and it's going to follow the the
[1:08:19] the circuits of nature
[1:08:21] to to manifest fruit and to go back into
[1:08:25] the ground and grow again germinate
[1:08:27] pollinate express fruit and it's in a
[1:08:29] cycle that god has set in course
[1:08:31] and the only way that
[1:08:33] that could be interrupted if something
[1:08:35] comes along and interrupts it it's
[1:08:38] amazing to think that god places
[1:08:40] everything in this fine tuned creation
[1:08:43] but then the man and the woman are given
[1:08:45] a choice
[1:08:47] if anything that's what's expressed in
[1:08:48] genesis chapter 2
[1:08:50] is you can if you want
[1:08:54] right
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:58] right
[1:08:59] i mean genesis chapter two he's
[1:09:01] basically saying you can
[1:09:03] but you shouldn't
[1:09:06] i that we i think it's a little
[1:09:09] uh pedant in our home but whenever the
[1:09:10] kids say can i
[1:09:12] we don't we're very strict i don't know
[1:09:14] if we're borrowing from the oxford style
[1:09:16] or what i i support the oxford comma in
[1:09:19] our home school and
[1:09:21] rub some feathers with those who don't
[1:09:22] agree with the oxford comma
[1:09:24] but we can be sticklers about you don't
[1:09:26] say can i when you want permission it's
[1:09:28] may i
[1:09:29] but we understand that can is used
[1:09:33] i'm not establishing any kind of order
[1:09:35] you can say can all you want but what
[1:09:36] what's the distinction saying can speaks
[1:09:38] of ability
[1:09:41] but may speaks of permission
[1:09:43] god wasn't giving them permission
[1:09:46] god was saying don't do it you must not
[1:09:48] do it because if you do there's a
[1:09:50] consequence
[1:09:52] but in telling him not to
[1:09:55] he's indicating to us they can
[1:09:59] isn't that amazing
[1:10:01] have you ever thought about it and you
[1:10:02] really began to think wow god didn't
[1:10:05] just keep them from it
[1:10:09] let's be honest if we were god
[1:10:11] like we would hid the tree
[1:10:14] it would have been a 900-foot tree the
[1:10:15] fruit would have been the very top and
[1:10:17] adam couldn't fly couldn't build a
[1:10:18] ladder
[1:10:19] like you know what
[1:10:21] you shouldn't eat that and i just put
[1:10:23] some where you couldn't even get to it
[1:10:24] and god just doesn't work that way
[1:10:27] and we know he did it so that the plan
[1:10:28] of redemption could unfold
[1:10:30] but he put the man and the woman
[1:10:32] in a position to where they had to
[1:10:34] respect the boundary
[1:10:36] and they had a choice to cross it and as
[1:10:38] soon as they crossed it there was a
[1:10:39] consequence
[1:10:41] see god's a god of boundaries
[1:10:44] just chapter one and two god establishes
[1:10:46] boundaries establishes relationships
[1:10:48] give gives them responsibility in
[1:10:50] genesis chapter three it's trespassed
[1:10:52] god's boundary is
[1:10:54] brother man says in marriage and divorce
[1:10:56] she broke the covenant because she
[1:10:57] stepped across the borders of god's word
[1:11:02] she was able she was able to step across
[1:11:04] the borders of god's word god didn't put
[1:11:06] her in a straight jacket and chain her
[1:11:08] in binder and she's in a chain well i
[1:11:10] can't i can't really go beyond this
[1:11:12] point he didn't do it
[1:11:14] she had she was a free-more agent who
[1:11:15] can make a decision that could have
[1:11:17] consequences and she stepped across the
[1:11:20] borders of god's word now if you go to
[1:11:22] the new testament you find paul says i'm
[1:11:24] afraid that as the serpent beguiled eve
[1:11:26] he tells the corinthians your minds
[1:11:28] might be beguiled from the simplicity
[1:11:29] that is in christ the same devil that
[1:11:32] deceived then is the same devil that's
[1:11:34] working now trying to corrupt us from
[1:11:36] the simplicity that is in christ
[1:11:39] and peter writes in second peter 3 17 ye
[1:11:42] therefore beloved seeing you know these
[1:11:44] things before beware lest he also
[1:11:48] be led away with the air of the wicked
[1:11:51] fall from your own steadfastness
[1:11:53] fall from your place lose your footing
[1:11:56] being led away with the air of the
[1:11:58] wicked wandering led astray
[1:12:01] you have a path you have a lane you're
[1:12:02] to stay and you have something here to
[1:12:04] do he says i i beware be diligent be
[1:12:07] circumspect
[1:12:09] that you don't get led away
[1:12:12] and fall from your own steadfastness
[1:12:16] the things i'm speaking about
[1:12:19] are not to imply that you could ever
[1:12:21] lose your salvation
[1:12:24] but we're not just living to be saved
[1:12:25] right
[1:12:27] it's the fullness of salvation we're
[1:12:29] hungry for
[1:12:30] the fullness of redemption is the time
[1:12:32] that we're living in
[1:12:33] my final statement in the message
[1:12:35] oneness
[1:12:36] billy graham says today it's too bad to
[1:12:38] think this but the churches try to lean
[1:12:40] upon their own understanding just
[1:12:42] exactly like eve did
[1:12:45] she thought because it was presented to
[1:12:47] her it looked so
[1:12:48] real my goodness we're living the day
[1:12:51] and age where anything can be made to
[1:12:52] look real
[1:12:54] and authentic
[1:12:56] he says oh don't fail to get this it
[1:12:59] looked so real
[1:13:00] something that could be added to what
[1:13:02] god said this is the phrase that's so
[1:13:05] remarkable it looked like she had she
[1:13:08] have something that god hadn't told her
[1:13:10] just how far she could go
[1:13:13] it looked like
[1:13:15] she could go further it looked like god
[1:13:19] hadn't told her
[1:13:21] all the things that she could enjoy all
[1:13:23] the things that she could do it looked
[1:13:24] like there was something that god hadn't
[1:13:26] told her about that she could go further
[1:13:28] in he says god hadn't given her
[1:13:31] the boundary line like he had set the
[1:13:33] sea and it cannot pass
[1:13:35] because the moon watches it
[1:13:39] it looked like to her
[1:13:41] that the boundary wasn't exactly where
[1:13:44] she thought it was
[1:13:46] so what she originally perceived as a
[1:13:48] boundary she now sees as a barrier
[1:13:52] i that's those are the terminologies i'm
[1:13:54] using if you'd use a different one
[1:13:55] that's certainly fine with me but just
[1:13:57] catch the truth and the concept
[1:13:59] things changed her mind and now she's
[1:14:01] thinking oh
[1:14:02] god told me to stay in this place
[1:14:05] but there's more
[1:14:07] oh maybe there's more or maybe that
[1:14:09] doesn't matter maybe i can venture into
[1:14:10] this she thought
[1:14:12] that satan had something on the ball as
[1:14:14] we'd say
[1:14:15] he knew more
[1:14:17] that she could still be in union with
[1:14:19] god and yet be smarter she would have a
[1:14:21] better education
[1:14:23] but god had lauded her just exactly what
[1:14:27] she
[1:14:28] had need of
[1:14:31] can you believe that for yourself
[1:14:33] if you find yourself sometimes in your
[1:14:35] life looking around and seeing what
[1:14:36] everybody else has
[1:14:38] and you think oh my
[1:14:40] i really wish i could have that
[1:14:43] and you think of all the things that
[1:14:44] keep you from having it and you see them
[1:14:46] as barriers
[1:14:48] because that's what the devil wants you
[1:14:49] to see
[1:14:50] instead of it being god's protection
[1:14:53] god's keeping you from it
[1:14:55] god has a boundary there's a place he
[1:14:56] has a calling something he's called you
[1:14:58] too he says for the woman he had
[1:15:01] something he allotted her just exactly
[1:15:03] what she had needed everything the woman
[1:15:05] needed was at her disposal
[1:15:07] she didn't need anything else
[1:15:09] the grass wasn't greener on the other
[1:15:11] side
[1:15:12] and so for her she was in a position
[1:15:14] where she needed to recognize that what
[1:15:17] satan was trying to entice her into was
[1:15:19] to step across a boundary into unbelief
[1:15:23] and to suffer the consequences for it
[1:15:26] why because god had given her the bounds
[1:15:28] of the word of god satan wants us to
[1:15:30] perceive the boundary of the word as a
[1:15:32] barrier and just kind of bullhead right
[1:15:34] through it and stumble into unbelief and
[1:15:36] we don't want to make that mistake
[1:15:40] tate you ask god to give you discernment
[1:15:42] to recognize those things that god has
[1:15:45] placed there as boundaries as
[1:15:47] protections as limiters so that you can
[1:15:50] be blessed not that he can withhold
[1:15:51] things from you but so that you can be
[1:15:53] blessed
[1:15:54] oh and just take the reverse of it there
[1:15:57] are things that the devil wants you to
[1:15:58] think is a boundary but in reality it's
[1:16:01] a barrier to you experiencing what god
[1:16:04] has for you and you've got to recognize
[1:16:06] the barrier that satan has put in your
[1:16:08] way
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:10] because it's his way of isolating you
[1:16:13] he's just put up all these barriers so
[1:16:15] he can kind of keep you isolated from
[1:16:16] the word of god because as soon as you
[1:16:18] as you could exist within that framework
[1:16:20] satan has you right where he wants you
[1:16:23] and wear you out in your mind
[1:16:25] anybody want to testify about a battle
[1:16:28] in the mind by show of hands
[1:16:30] yeah it's the greatest battle and it's
[1:16:32] getting worse
[1:16:34] why because that's the battleground
[1:16:37] that's why the battle's so hard in your
[1:16:38] mind
[1:16:40] if i could say anything to give you
[1:16:41] comfort this morning because to this
[1:16:42] point
[1:16:43] [Music]
[1:16:44] i don't know
[1:16:46] say anything to comfort you battles are
[1:16:48] fought in land that wants to be
[1:16:50] possessed
[1:16:52] and if there's not an opponent there's
[1:16:54] no fight
[1:16:57] and you're having a battle in your mind
[1:16:59] because that's the ground that satan
[1:17:00] chose
[1:17:01] and god's glad to take it
[1:17:04] and you're having a battle in your mind
[1:17:05] because the word is there doing battle
[1:17:08] and he's fighting and the battle is
[1:17:10] getting heavier and heavier but god's
[1:17:11] equipping you to win it
[1:17:14] and this concept of barriers and
[1:17:16] boundaries will help you
[1:17:18] because there's things that satan's
[1:17:19] trying to keep you barred from that god
[1:17:21] wants you to tear down
[1:17:23] and there's things that god never wants
[1:17:24] you to cross
[1:17:26] and if you feel like you're just going
[1:17:27] to hold your breath saying well i'm
[1:17:30] afraid to make a move don't be afraid
[1:17:32] god's with you
[1:17:34] let's stand
