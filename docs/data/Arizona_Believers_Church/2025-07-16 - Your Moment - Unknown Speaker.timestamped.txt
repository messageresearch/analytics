[0:00] 1 Corinthians chap 12:es
[0:03] 12- 27. If you could follow with me in
[0:06] this. I don't um I'm not expecting to
[0:08] amplify much as we go through it, but
[0:11] I'm hoping to be able to draw from much
[0:12] of this, but then I'm just going to pick
[0:14] up at the end uh starting with verse 24
[0:17] most likely. For as the body is one and
[0:19] hath many members, and all the members
[0:21] of that one body being many many are one
[0:24] body, so also is Christ. So there's that
[0:26] parallel that Christ is one. And then
[0:28] we, though we are many members, it's
[0:31] still that oneness, one body. For by one
[0:34] spirit are we all baptized into this one
[0:36] body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles,
[0:39] whether we be bond or free, and have all
[0:41] been made to drink into one spirit. It's
[0:44] this scripture that brother Brandham
[0:46] uses when he says that God's word is
[0:48] like a drama. And it's specifically this
[0:50] part where he says that by one spirit
[0:52] we're all baptized into one body but yet
[0:54] we being individuals understand that
[0:58] through the symphony. For the body is
[1:00] not one member but many. If the foot
[1:03] shall say because I am not the hand I am
[1:05] not of the body. Is it therefore not of
[1:07] the body? If the ear shall say because I
[1:10] am not the eye I am not of the body. Is
[1:11] it therefore not of the body? Notice
[1:14] that the attitude resides within the
[1:16] individual understanding their part. If
[1:19] the whole body were an eye, where were
[1:20] the hearing? If the whole were hearing,
[1:22] where were the smelling? But now hath
[1:24] God set the members, every one of them
[1:27] in the body, as it hath pleased him? And
[1:30] if they were all one member, where were
[1:32] the body? But now are they many members
[1:35] yet but one body? How? It just seems
[1:38] very uh repetitious. But then I think
[1:41] there's a lot of different elements and
[1:42] nuances he keeps introducing for our
[1:44] benefit. And the eye cannot say unto the
[1:46] hand, I have no need of thee, nor again
[1:48] the head to the feet, I have no need of
[1:50] thee. Nay, much more those members of
[1:53] the body which seem to be more feeble
[1:55] are necessary. And those members of the
[1:57] body which we think to be less
[1:59] honorable, upon these we bestow more
[2:02] abundant honor, and our uncumbly parts
[2:04] have more abundant comeliness. For our
[2:07] comely parts have no need. But God hath
[2:09] tempered the body together, having give
[2:12] more abundant honor to the part which
[2:14] lacked, that there should be no schism
[2:16] in the body, but that the members should
[2:18] have the same care one for another. And
[2:21] whether one member suffer, all the
[2:22] members suffer with it, or one member be
[2:24] honored, all the members rejoice with
[2:26] it. Now ye are the body of Christ, and
[2:29] members in particular. Amen. You can be
[2:33] seated.
[2:35] I may have given you the wrong title on
[2:37] Sunday. Can't remember if it was the
[2:38] bride's uh song or the bride's move or
[2:41] what it was. But tonight, our title is
[2:43] your moment. I wanted to make it just a
[2:45] little bit more personal and express
[2:48] this to you and trust that you can just
[2:50] uh enter into this service just as the
[2:52] one that we have before us. Uh not
[2:55] trying to figure out everything that's
[2:56] been preached before and make everything
[2:57] fit, but just look at this um directly
[3:00] this evening and catch the mind of God
[3:02] for us. But I do want you to make it
[3:03] personal. This is your moment which is
[3:05] an opportunity. Uh it's even derived
[3:07] from even the sense of momentum a
[3:10] segment of that momentum this this time
[3:12] of this opportunity.
[3:14] And let's start in 1 Corinthians chapter
[3:17] 14 as Paul has expressed these things in
[3:20] chapter 12. Uh he's now going to be
[3:23] continued to build on this oneness and
[3:25] the different members and gifts and
[3:26] administrations in the body. He does
[3:28] mention in Romans that um that's the
[3:31] same spirit but different
[3:32] administrations and different offices.
[3:34] And there's a lot of emphasis on how
[3:36] we're all working together for a whole
[3:38] even though we have individual parts. He
[3:40] says, "Now brethren, if I come unto you
[3:42] speaking with tongues, that's in other
[3:44] words, a language that you can't
[3:46] understand, what shall I profit you
[3:49] except I shall speak to you either by
[3:51] revelation or by knowledge or by
[3:52] prophesying or by doctrine?" In other
[3:55] words, these are more profitable to
[3:57] speak with an unknown language or in
[3:58] tongues that is just in the spirit
[4:00] that's unintelligible. It's not in
[4:02] necessarily any language at all. He says
[4:04] it doesn't profit you unless we speak by
[4:07] revelation knowledge, prophesying or
[4:09] teaching or doctrine. Those things
[4:11] edify. Those things are profitable. Even
[4:14] things without life. Now it's this this
[4:17] uh dividing between us who could
[4:20] vocalize or and speak. But even things
[4:23] without life giving sound, whether pipe
[4:25] or harp, except they give a distinction
[4:28] in the sounds, how shall it be known
[4:31] what is piped or harped? So what is the
[4:33] benefit? If he says, if I speak in an
[4:35] unknown language and you don't
[4:36] understand it, he's saying there's no
[4:38] prophet. So only when I speak by
[4:40] revelation or knowledge, prophesying or
[4:42] teaching that you receive a benefit in a
[4:45] profit. So in the same way if an
[4:47] instrument is uh it does not have a
[4:50] distinction in sound he says there's
[4:52] there's no benefit to it. I could put it
[4:54] this way it's not pleasing. And he's
[4:56] looking uh at the dynamic of music where
[4:58] one can pipe and one can harp and it
[5:02] works together to produce something that
[5:03] is fruitful or beneficial. And so for in
[5:07] order for music to be made or understood
[5:10] perhaps even enjoyed there must be a
[5:12] distinction in the sounds. some
[5:14] distinction among notes and tones and
[5:16] and the different elements that make up
[5:19] music. Even if vocals are a part of it.
[5:22] Vocals have to be combined with the
[5:23] instruments. And when arranged properly,
[5:25] it produces music. That's how we have a
[5:28] a difference between music and noise. If
[5:30] somebody's just shouting and another
[5:32] person's just banging and another
[5:33] person's doing this, we wouldn't say,
[5:35] "Ah, listen to that music." We say,
[5:36] "Listen to that noise, that racket." So
[5:39] each instrument, pipe, harp, if we say
[5:42] vocals, whatever we might want to look
[5:43] at this, have to work in a way that's
[5:45] complimentary. We saw in 1st Samuel 16
[5:48] 23 and it came to pass when the evil
[5:51] spirit from God was upon Saul that David
[5:53] took a harp and played with his hand. So
[5:56] Saul was refreshed. Here he is playing
[5:59] with his hands the harp and he's singing
[6:02] with his voice as they believe
[6:03] traditionally. And it says Saul was
[6:05] refreshed and was well and the evil
[6:08] spirit departed from him. David's
[6:11] playing and singing had a harmony to it.
[6:13] It had a a tension and a melody and
[6:16] vocalization and it was all arranged in
[6:18] such a way that it contrasted the
[6:20] chaotic mind in this turbulent spirit
[6:23] that Saul had when this evil spirit from
[6:25] the Lord came upon him. And so that's
[6:28] something skillfully played things that
[6:30] are put together. It has that power of
[6:32] music. It's something that God enjoys
[6:34] and is a beautiful. So the what I want
[6:37] to emphasize here at the outset is that
[6:41] the pipe and the harp these instruments
[6:43] whatever the instrument might be must be
[6:45] true to their purpose their intended
[6:47] purpose. They must be true to their
[6:49] design in order to produce
[6:53] a unique sound um that can become a
[6:55] melody that can form music. There a lot
[6:57] of instruments maybe we can pick up and
[7:00] we can blow on or we can slap on or we
[7:02] can do different things too and it makes
[7:04] a sound but said that's not how that's
[7:06] supposed to be played. That that's not
[7:07] how it's intended.
[7:09] A each instrument having a unique sound
[7:12] and when played right uh produces that
[7:14] sound as Paul is saying that there has
[7:17] to be a distinction. Think of this a
[7:19] distinction in sounds and that
[7:21] distinction or that difference is
[7:22] necessary for music. then the pipe
[7:24] should not want to be the harp and the
[7:27] harp shouldn't try to sound like the
[7:28] pipe because there's if they do
[7:31] something is lost that it doesn't Paul
[7:34] is saying if we if we can't tell the
[7:36] difference what's the benefit if
[7:38] everything tries to be the same on the
[7:39] same tone and do the same thing he's
[7:41] saying what's the benefit so there can
[7:43] be and you might just have to really
[7:45] think about this in a way to say I'm
[7:47] going to chew on that or maybe I'll come
[7:48] back to later but there can be a loss of
[7:50] distinction through overemphasis or
[7:54] through impersonation.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; If a pipe tries to sound like a harp, so
[7:59] then a pipe sounding like a harp, it
[8:01] loses it can lose its distinction from
[8:03] the other instrument which may be meant
[8:05] to contrast it. And when it try when
[8:07] everything tries to sound the same, you
[8:09] get this loss of distinction. And
[8:11] through impersonation, one one
[8:13] instrument would be complimentary if
[8:14] they played uh a certain rhythm or they
[8:17] didn't play the melody and they were
[8:18] filling in certain notes and the other
[8:19] one is on the melody. But when they all
[8:21] try to play it together, any musician
[8:22] here will tell you, especially in this
[8:24] church, that it just becomes a roar. And
[8:26] and it's not beautiful to those that sit
[8:28] here in the corner because they're just
[8:30] everything's just blending together in a
[8:32] disharmonious way because they're just
[8:33] bouncing off of each other. Even the
[8:36] science of sound waves dictates that not
[8:38] everything needs to be on the same
[8:39] length, but there needs to be some
[8:41] contrast in different textures and
[8:43] elements to make music beautiful. And
[8:46] even through overemphasis where things
[8:48] are well it has to be this way it has to
[8:49] be this way it has to be this way or you
[8:51] emphasize only one part uh and then
[8:53] everything tries to sound that part or
[8:55] be that way then you lose distinction. I
[8:58] was thinking of it this way that it's
[8:59] kind of lazy homogyny. Well let's all
[9:01] just be the same and it's just laziness
[9:03] because nobody's willing to take their
[9:05] part and let God deal with their hearts.
[9:07] Let's just find somebody we can mimic
[9:09] and we can copy. Or maybe it's uh
[9:11] legalism on one sense or maybe
[9:13] fanaticism in another way. Paul
[9:15] continuing in verse 8. For if the
[9:17] trumpet give an uncertain sound, who
[9:19] shall prepare himself for battle? So
[9:21] he's talking about giving sound and the
[9:24] need to have distinction in our sounds
[9:27] when we pipe or when we harp or when a
[9:29] sound is given in order for there to be
[9:32] a benefit. And he says because if a
[9:34] trumpet sounds in an uncertain way, it's
[9:37] not going to give the proper signal in
[9:39] order to respond appropriately.
[9:42] So, an uncertain sound here is an
[9:45] unknown or secret sound. Or we could
[9:46] just say it's not understood. Say, "Yep,
[9:48] that was a trumpet. Yes, something was
[9:51] played." Maybe you even say to some
[9:52] point that sounds like it it it followed
[9:54] a particular melody. But if it's
[9:56] uncertain or unknown or secret, then
[9:59] there's no benefit from listening to it.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; It can be played or maybe even heard.
[10:05] But if it's not according to, as Paul's
[10:07] saying, revelation, knowledge,
[10:08] prophesying, or doctrine, then you can't
[10:10] get the proper response to what's being
[10:13] sounded.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; In the sermon, feast of the trumpets, he
[10:16] says, the only way you'll know what the
[10:18] trumpet sound is, and he's specifically
[10:20] referencing this verse. The only way you
[10:22] know what the trumpet sound is is to
[10:23] look what the music sheet says. That's
[10:26] all. It's a great symphony and beating.
[10:29] The music sheet is I look at it as I
[10:31] study it using the table program on the
[10:34] Windows operating system. It has music
[10:36] sheet capitalized. So we know we're
[10:38] looking at the word of God, the Bible,
[10:41] and not just something pulled off the
[10:43] shelf at at a bookstore or or a music
[10:45] store, but it's something that is
[10:47] according to God's word. And how are we
[10:49] going to know what is sounded unless we
[10:52] can understand the sheet music?
[10:55] &gt;&gt; And Paul is following along these lines
[10:57] in verse 9. He says, "So likewise, ye,
[10:59] except you utter by the tongue words
[11:02] easy to be understood,
[11:05] how shall it be known what is spoken?" I
[11:08] guess sometimes it's amazing uh that
[11:10] Paul can be so direct and explicit about
[11:13] the use of the gift of tongues and how
[11:15] it could be manifested a and how that he
[11:18] is not saying this is the ultimate
[11:19] expression, but rather he's saying this
[11:21] is what can bring confusion for ye shall
[11:24] speak into the air. In other words, it's
[11:25] worthless. It's not going to edify it.
[11:27] just kind of empties out into the
[11:28] atmosphere. There are it may be so many
[11:31] kinds of voices in the world and none of
[11:33] them is without signification. So sounds
[11:35] voices are are have a purpose and they
[11:38] have a meaning. He says therefore if I
[11:40] know not the meaning of the voice
[11:43] the voice has to be understood or the
[11:45] meaning behind it. I shall be unto him
[11:48] that speaketh a barbarian and he that
[11:50] speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.
[11:52] one is sounding and the one who's
[11:55] hearing what is sounded thinks the one
[11:56] speaking is a barbarian and the one
[11:58] who's speaking realizing it's not having
[12:00] the response on the recipient or the
[12:02] hearer he thinks they're a barbarian and
[12:05] so there's this sounding out if we even
[12:07] look at in the sense of music well this
[12:09] is what the music should do and
[12:10] someone's just sitting there going
[12:13] then the one who's playing the music
[12:14] says well they obviously don't get it
[12:16] and the one that's listening says well
[12:18] they obviously don't get it so there
[12:20] must be understanding or We can say this
[12:22] in the context of the word of God. The
[12:24] understanding of the sheet music and
[12:27] there must be a faithful performance of
[12:29] it. We can see it in the word and we say
[12:32] well it says this we says this. But if
[12:34] we misunderstand the sheet music even if
[12:36] it's being uh performed then it's
[12:39] barbaric to us. It's foreign or it's uh
[12:42] it's uh uncertain univilized is what it
[12:44] would be uh rude. So the rude barbarians
[12:47] were univilized. They're rude. And then
[12:50] if it's misinterpreted misinterpreted
[12:52] sheet music where it's not being played
[12:54] right then it's it's always going to be
[12:56] univilized or root it's not going to be
[12:58] harmonious
[13:00] and in that even something if it's
[13:02] properly understood and then I kind of
[13:04] feel just to say this it can be properly
[13:06] understood it can be properly performed
[13:08] but still the things of God can only be
[13:10] known by the spirit of God. Therefore it
[13:12] can seem foolish and unreasonable to
[13:15] those who don't know the music.
[13:17] 1 Corinthians chapter 1 18 to2.
[13:21] For the preaching of the cross is to
[13:23] them that perish foolishness, but unto
[13:26] us which are saved, it is the power of
[13:28] God. Now, it's important to recognize
[13:30] that the foolishness aspect is from the
[13:33] base instinct of fallen man. Not God
[13:36] saying, "Oh, well, this is foolishness.
[13:37] I'm going to use it." But rather, the
[13:39] preaching of the cross is to those who
[13:41] don't have understanding, it's
[13:43] foolishness. But to those which are
[13:45] impacted by it, it is the power of God.
[13:47] For it is written, I will destroy the
[13:48] wisdom of the wise, and I will bring to
[13:50] nothing the understanding of the
[13:52] prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the
[13:54] scribe? Where is the disputer of this
[13:56] world? Hath not God made foolish the
[13:59] wisdom of this world? For after that in
[14:01] the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom
[14:04] knew not God? It pleased God by the
[14:07] foolishness of preaching to save them
[14:09] that believe. He didn't use maybe their
[14:12] their socratic method and their uh the
[14:14] their porches of philosophy. He didn't
[14:16] use their schools or their rationale or
[14:19] even their scientific method or rigor or
[14:22] their proof. But he used preaching to
[14:24] save them that would believe. To them
[14:27] it's foolishness. It's the foolishness
[14:29] of preaching to the wise in this world.
[14:32] Says for the Jews require a sign and the
[14:35] Greeks seek after wisdom. Yeah. But we
[14:38] preach Christ crucified. That's the
[14:41] wisdom of God. That's the power of the
[14:42] gospel. And it is still yet under the
[14:44] Jews a stumbling block and under the
[14:47] Greeks foolishness. The their root
[14:49] identification is in their educational
[14:52] system, their structure, their culture.
[14:54] And the to the Jews, it's a stumbling
[14:56] block because they believe the gospel is
[14:58] a misinterpretation of their religion.
[15:00] To the Greeks, they don't hold to the
[15:02] any of those philosophies. They're
[15:04] looking for more an intellectual uh um
[15:07] stimulation. And so the gospel in itself
[15:10] is foolishness to those who are still
[15:12] rooted in their traditions and their
[15:15] cultural identities and their human
[15:17] education. But unto them which are
[15:19] called both Jews and Greeks, Christ the
[15:22] power of God and the wisdom of God.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Because the foolishness of God is wiser
[15:28] than men and the weakness of God is
[15:31] stronger than men. So the gospel being
[15:34] preached is a certain sound. It is a
[15:37] sounding out. The gospel trumpet, the
[15:38] gospel sound. The voice of one declaring
[15:41] and publishing the word of God is a
[15:43] certain sound. And yet still in its
[15:45] certainty and in its truth, one can hear
[15:48] it and think it's foolishness. I can
[15:50] misunderstand what is being piped and
[15:53] what is being preached. Brother Brandham
[15:55] in the sermon shalom July 12th of 1964
[15:59] he says the scripture is God's symphony
[16:03] only the composer knows what it really
[16:05] means and he reveals it to those who are
[16:07] listening who are interested in knowing
[16:10] what the drama is
[16:12] &gt;&gt; kind of takes it out of that realm I'm
[16:14] just going to be a casual observer I'm
[16:16] just going to show up I'm just going to
[16:17] be uh president when they call the roll
[16:19] call a and thinking that just by osmosis
[16:22] I'm somehow going to be able to
[16:23] understand the word of God. But he's
[16:25] saying the Bible is God's symphony. The
[16:27] composer, God who composed the word
[16:29] knows what it means. And he will reveal
[16:31] it to those who are wanting to
[16:33] understand, who are listening and
[16:35] interested in knowing what the drama is.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Now, come on all you tea drinkers.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; You know that's what you want. And here
[16:44] it is right here. All the drama you
[16:46] could ever want is in the word of God.
[16:49] It'll scratch that itch for the gossip.
[16:51] Gossip. You say, "Hey, spill some tea. I
[16:54] want to know the I I I want the DL on
[16:56] this. What's happening? You don't have
[16:57] to worry about it. You can get all that
[16:59] that scratched right here in the word of
[17:02] God to know what the drama is.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; But you'd have to know about a symphony
[17:08] first. It's not just something you see.
[17:11] It's the changing the junctions of the
[17:14] word of the music.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; It throws. Sometimes it's going this way
[17:20] for a while, a certain beat. After a
[17:22] while, it changes all around. Now,
[17:24] there's a way that we can look at that
[17:25] and say, "Oh, that's exactly what a
[17:27] movement will do within a larger
[17:29] composition that it has a certain beat
[17:31] and a certain rhythm." And some people
[17:33] just fixate on that first pull. They
[17:34] fixate on that second pull and they
[17:36] that's music to them and they rejoice in
[17:38] it, but they haven't caught those
[17:39] transitions or those movements. He says
[17:41] it's going this way for a while that all
[17:43] of a sudden it changes. He says, "A
[17:45] certain beat after a while it changes
[17:47] all around. What is it to you who
[17:49] wouldn't understand it or don't know
[17:51] nothing about it, not interested in it,
[17:55] it's just a racket. It's a fuss.
[17:58] Now, I believe that when one doesn't
[18:00] take that dig down deep enough to get in
[18:02] the spirit of revelation and they're not
[18:04] uh hungry for revelation, they're not
[18:06] looking at at it in the light that they
[18:07] ought to or in the way that pleases God,
[18:09] and they just kind of take the message
[18:10] lightly and they just kind of uh
[18:12] cherrypick their quotes to scratch their
[18:14] denominational itch, they when they look
[18:16] at it and they're not getting the
[18:18] understanding of it, what they're seeing
[18:20] is racket and fuss.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; And so they think that's how the message
[18:24] is supposed to sound. So that's what
[18:26] they drum up,
[18:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[18:28] &gt;&gt; That's what they teach. Now, they're
[18:29] probably not going to call it fuss, but
[18:30] God wants and hears a lot of fuss. No,
[18:33] but they what they're doing is they're
[18:34] what they're seeing in it. They're
[18:36] reflecting through their emphasis,
[18:38] through their legalism or their
[18:40] impersonation. And so it's rack it's a
[18:42] racket. It's a lot of fuss if you don't
[18:44] know it. And if that's you, if you don't
[18:46] know it, and that isn't what it is to
[18:48] you, you can then begin to channel your
[18:52] misconception. Amen.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "But to those who know about
[18:55] it, they're watching for it. They know
[18:57] it's coming."
[18:59] In other words, there's now as we
[19:01] mentioned that prophetic angle of how
[19:04] the word of God is sheet music and how
[19:06] that the church ages as it was expressed
[19:09] to John and Jesus is speaking and uh
[19:12] Christ in the midst of the church as a
[19:14] conductor is telling John what those
[19:16] movements will be, what's going to
[19:18] happen in each age and what parts going
[19:20] to be played and there's going to be
[19:21] these different elements and if they we
[19:24] have the benefit of looking at back at
[19:25] it historically but in a way the word
[19:28] was telling what was coming in a way
[19:31] that the church could have been looking
[19:32] at their their music and saying this is
[19:36] exactly what we have. We've identified
[19:38] ourselves in the word. We're being
[19:39] persecuted or this is happening that's
[19:40] happening and they can watch for it.
[19:43] Amen.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Now, this may seem to be a little bit of
[19:45] an aside, but it's not a rabbit trail.
[19:47] And I I want this is uh fits into our
[19:51] theme tonight of your moment. How Paul
[19:53] is saying that well, you're all
[19:54] individual members, but yet we're one
[19:56] body. And the body being one is still
[19:57] yet many membered. And he's emphasizing
[19:59] that in such a way to where kind of
[20:02] weaves in and out of those different
[20:03] things of members and and one body but
[20:06] different parts. And he uh that great
[20:08] emphasis. What he's expressing is how
[20:11] that the hand can't say to the feet,
[20:13] you're not part of the body. Nor can the
[20:15] feet say to the hand the same. And nor
[20:17] can the ear say, well, I'm not part of
[20:19] the body. No matter what it says, it is.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; And what is what is expressed is a
[20:25] unified hole. something that is one but
[20:27] yet there's some division the
[20:30] distinction amongst parts. So when there
[20:33] are differences among members unity is
[20:36] key and when it comes to music unity is
[20:39] key when combining different voices and
[20:41] different instruments and different
[20:42] sounds and different notes to make
[20:44] music. Unity
[20:46] is paramount.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Unity is the state of being united into
[20:51] a whole. If something is just singular,
[20:54] then you say, well, there it's not
[20:55] necessarily unity unless you begin to
[20:57] look at it in its components and what
[20:59] makes it up and say, oh, these are
[21:00] things fused together. This is what
[21:02] comes together to make this. There's no
[21:04] single cell organism as it were, but
[21:06] there's different ways that we shape.
[21:08] So, there's uh there's a unity is a
[21:10] harmony of parts into a whole.
[21:14] To be united or have unity, it's a
[21:16] unchanging singleness of purpose or
[21:18] action among different parts or members.
[21:21] So unity uh produces harmony or
[21:23] agreement.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; One thing may be different uh uh and
[21:27] almost opposite of the other but when
[21:28] they unite they find how where their
[21:31] differences blend or fuse together with
[21:34] the other.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; We touched on this briefly recently in
[21:38] Genesis 11:1 how this spoke of a had a
[21:42] musical tone to it that the whole earth
[21:45] was of one language and of one speech.
[21:49] They didn't all sound the same where if
[21:50] someone said, "Hey, Bob." And and all
[21:53] the Bobs turned around and said, "Yeah,
[21:55] Jack." They all had they had different
[21:57] voices and they had different sounds and
[21:59] uh they maybe had different pitches and
[22:01] different tones and different ways that
[22:03] they would speak and but yet they were
[22:05] all of one language in one speech. In
[22:08] the musical sense, there's ways of
[22:09] combining harmony and timing and tone
[22:12] and rhythm and different kinds of
[22:14] structure. go and study these different
[22:15] elements of music, even texture and
[22:18] dynamics.
[22:20] A and that's one may be playing uh very
[22:22] loud, the other one very soft, one may
[22:24] be doing something that's not
[22:26] necessarily out of beat, but it's it's
[22:28] hitting differently or alter alternating
[22:30] than something else. And how you make
[22:33] music is when all those things combine.
[22:36] And if you guys aren't writing song and
[22:38] making songs and making your own music
[22:40] by the time I get back, I'm going to be
[22:41] incredibly disappointed because I'm
[22:43] giving you everything. It's right here.
[22:45] How to make music.
[22:48] So there's unity is necessary. In Isaiah
[22:51] 52:es 78 and 9, how beautiful upon the
[22:55] mountains are the feet of him that
[22:57] bringeth good news. So I believe that I
[23:00] have
[23:02] uh beautiful feet upon the mountain
[23:05] that publisheth peace, that bringeth
[23:07] good tidings of good, that publisheth
[23:09] salvation, that saith unto Zion, "Thy
[23:11] God reignth." There's the gospel being
[23:14] preached. What to the world is
[23:15] foolishness. There's something beautiful
[23:17] and its foundations and its efforts, its
[23:19] purpose, its pathway, its endeavors that
[23:21] publish peace, that bring good tidings
[23:23] of good, that publish salvation, and
[23:25] say, "Thy God reignth."
[23:27] So it says in verse 8, it says an
[23:29] amplification, maybe just a threshing
[23:31] out of these different elements. Thy
[23:33] watchmen shall lift up the voice.
[23:38] It doesn't say they shall lift up their
[23:40] voices, but watchmen plural are lifting
[23:44] up the voice. Certainly, you could take
[23:47] from this the different how when uh
[23:50] harmony is just perfectly tight, it
[23:52] blends to make one sound.
[23:56] They shall lift up the voice. With the
[23:58] voice together shall they sing. So
[24:02] there's a singing with the voice
[24:04] together shall they sing. And it says,
[24:06] "For they shall see eye to eye." Now
[24:08] that's a eyecatching statement.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; They shall see eye to eye. Many times,
[24:13] "Wow, brother, we're always going to see
[24:15] things differently and we're just
[24:16] looking at it from different angles and
[24:18] and sometimes it's used in such a way to
[24:20] say, well, you're just looking on this
[24:21] side of the mountain and you're looking
[24:22] on the other side." And we think, "No, I
[24:24] don't even think we're on the same
[24:25] continent."
[24:27] I mean, that there I don't I appreciate
[24:29] the positivity.
[24:31] And yet we should believe that there is
[24:33] a unifying process taking place where
[24:35] the God- called men and the bride with
[24:38] her voice sounding out that there's a
[24:40] seeing eye to eye when we recognize who
[24:43] we are. When there's a uniting where
[24:45] there's a common preeminence that with
[24:47] the voice it's lifted up with the voice
[24:49] together they shall sing for they shall
[24:52] see eye to eye. And then here comes this
[24:55] end time type when the Lord shall bring
[24:57] again Zion. Remember in brother Brown
[25:00] has the preview of the bride. It comes
[25:02] again and then goes it comes and then it
[25:03] goes away. But it says we shall bring
[25:05] the bride again. It's going to come in
[25:07] preview again. So that church which has
[25:09] been eaten down. The Lord's going to
[25:11] bring again Zion. He's going to build
[25:12] her up. And with that time there's going
[25:15] to be one voice. The voice is going to
[25:17] be lifted up. They are will sing
[25:19] together with the voice.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; They'll see eye to eye. That's common
[25:23] understanding revelation being given.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Verse nine. So then this is for all of
[25:28] us. Break forth into joy. Sing together,
[25:31] ye waste places of Jerusalem. For the
[25:34] Lord hath comforted his people. He hath
[25:36] redeemed Jerusalem. Has anybody ever
[25:39] used this scripture for those who live
[25:40] in Tucson? The waste places. They always
[25:43] call us Jericho, but I mean, you got
[25:46] some waste places yourself.
[25:49] The waste places of Jerusalem. For the
[25:51] Lord hath comforted his people. He hath
[25:53] redeemed Jerusalem.
[25:55] Now, think about this end time that
[25:57] we're living in. Think about the
[25:58] principles that brother Brandham is
[25:59] preaching and recognizing your day in
[26:01] its message. Some of these many
[26:03] different things we've shared recently
[26:05] uh in the sermon shalom a and the
[26:08] rapture. We are at the harvest time.
[26:10] This is the time of redemption. This is
[26:12] the time of the rapture. This is shalom.
[26:14] Not so much an evening light as much as
[26:16] a rising sun.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; So it's bride time. It is uniting time.
[26:22] And this is a theme that brother Bham is
[26:24] using in the time of preaching these
[26:25] sermons where he's trying to get
[26:26] everybody to see there's been a
[26:27] changing. It's been the same. It's been
[26:29] the same spirit. It's been the same God.
[26:31] It's been the Holy Ghost through the
[26:32] church ages. But now we're at this
[26:33] junction time. There's a bit change in
[26:36] the beat. And you can't be going in the
[26:38] same old trend. And when brother
[26:40] Brandham's trying to make this point, he
[26:42] comes to this concept of a musical
[26:44] composition.
[26:45] The composition that he uses is Peter
[26:48] and the Wolf.
[26:50] It was composed in 1936 by Sergey Proo
[26:55] Proofv
[26:58] rather. I'm not Russian, forgive me.
[27:02] Salaboga,
[27:04] but he's uh it's about 25 minutes long,
[27:06] so it's not very long. I kind of just
[27:08] threw it out there before the family. Uh
[27:10] should I play it tonight and or this
[27:12] Wednesday night? And nobody bit on it.
[27:14] And I realized maybe that would be a
[27:16] little bit too much of a stretch. Maybe
[27:17] it's one thing to preach on art all
[27:19] year, but then to play Peter and the
[27:21] Wolf on a Wednesday night would be the
[27:23] end of me.
[27:26] But it's a story. They say, I think in
[27:28] some ways it was definitely communist
[27:29] propaganda. Uh but uh it's a story about
[27:32] not being afraid. It was commissioned.
[27:33] He was commissioned to write this for a
[27:35] very specific purpose. There's themes of
[27:37] taming nature and conquering external
[27:39] threats. So you can see how during a
[27:40] cold war that would be maybe appropriate
[27:42] to the Soviet children who are looking
[27:44] at things on the outside as threats and
[27:46] not being afraid of things that would
[27:48] happen. But it is this composition that
[27:51] brother Brandham uses when he's saying
[27:53] that God's word is like a musical
[27:56] composition when he likens it to music
[27:59] or sheet music. This is the one that he
[28:01] refers to the most. And in this
[28:04] composition, Peter and the wolf and and
[28:06] here in a moment, brother John, I'll
[28:08] queue it up when I'm ready for those
[28:09] next slides. But here in this, let me
[28:11] just give a summary first. There are
[28:14] certain characteristics of that piece
[28:16] that I believe Brother Vanam caught. And
[28:18] even he mentions it in there. He says,
[28:20] well, it's this does this and this does
[28:22] that. And he mentions some of the things
[28:24] that stood out to him and it it drew him
[28:27] these characteristics of this piece drew
[28:29] him to use it as an example. Now
[28:32] summarizing it in the actual piece, this
[28:35] composition, this classical piece,
[28:36] there's a narrator uh that tells a
[28:39] Russian folk tale and the tell and he's
[28:41] actually narrating these different
[28:42] pieces about a young boy who lives with
[28:44] his grandfather in the forest and some
[28:46] of the elements and activities that take
[28:48] place. It kind of centers around the
[28:50] tension comes from that antagonist, the
[28:52] wolf, hence Peter and the wolf. And so
[28:55] in the beginning, the narrator explains
[28:57] and this is actually part of the show.
[28:59] This is part of the symphony. The
[29:01] narrator explains uh what instruments
[29:04] are going to be used in the drama, tells
[29:07] you upfront um in which instruments will
[29:10] represent each character. And then one
[29:12] thing that I thought was remarkable
[29:14] especially considering the things that
[29:15] brother Brandham says around this time
[29:16] when he's using these examples is that
[29:20] the story ends with the triumphal
[29:22] procession I think are the words that
[29:24] are used even in the original of each of
[29:27] Peter and all the characters that were
[29:30] in the drama. The each one come in their
[29:34] turn to their music each one after
[29:37] another. In other words, that symmetry,
[29:39] that parallel to what brother Brandham
[29:40] saw in the preview of the bride. So,
[29:42] each character in the story has a
[29:44] particular instrument and a musical
[29:46] theme. Brother Brandham identified this
[29:48] characteristic as what stood out to him
[29:50] because he says, "Oh, well, this
[29:50] instrument identified this animal." And
[29:53] brother John, if you want to just follow
[29:54] with me in this and pay attention to
[29:56] this, but the bird in this composition
[30:00] or this drama is portrayed by a flute.
[30:03] This is the actual sheet music which is
[30:05] played. So all our floutus or floutas
[30:08] taqua whatever we call them they would
[30:10] play the these notes and each one of
[30:13] these symbols would tell you and you
[30:15] can't really read it here but the algro
[30:17] is indicating how it's what the that
[30:19] rhythm or that speed is going to be and
[30:21] the bird is represented by a flute.
[30:23] Their part is different but it's still
[30:27] part of the same sheet music. And then
[30:29] you have and just notice how it visually
[30:31] is represented. A duck is presented by
[30:34] or sounds like is played by an obo.
[30:38] Again, it's different. Seems shorter,
[30:40] maybe smaller. Try to use um a
[30:42] representation of this would be easy to
[30:44] see. But a duck is the instrument of an
[30:47] obo is used to characterize the duck. A
[30:52] cat is played by a clarinet. Not just a
[30:55] clarinet, but playing staccato in a
[30:57] lower register in the lower register.
[30:59] And that's going to convey the character
[31:00] or mimic some sort of uh motion of the
[31:06] cat.
[31:10] The grandfather
[31:12] is portrayed by a bassoon, not a
[31:15] buffoon, a bassoon.
[31:17] And again, the music's different. Even
[31:19] some ways you look at say, "Well, that
[31:20] looks like it's written in a different
[31:21] language and it's all along different
[31:23] bars or different lines." It's done to
[31:25] represent the grandfather. The wolf is
[31:28] portrayed by three horns.
[31:30] Hunters are portrayed by woodwinds and
[31:32] drums. Peter himself by a string
[31:34] quartet. And the shooting, I don't
[31:37] believe I have this slide in there, but
[31:38] the shooting is actually kettle drums
[31:39] and the bass drum. And it indicates
[31:41] there's shots being fired.
[31:45] Now, as those quickly went by your gaze,
[31:48] each character has a part to play. So,
[31:51] they they have some role. They have some
[31:53] part in the narrative. there. If we were
[31:56] looking at in terms of a script, it
[31:57] would say, well, Peter looks like this
[31:59] and Peter's going to do that and Peter's
[32:00] going to do this and Peter's going to do
[32:01] that. But in this way, something's not
[32:04] actually being acted out. We're not
[32:05] talking about the Disney uh Peter and
[32:07] the Wolf. We're talking about a musical
[32:09] composition where what would visually be
[32:12] seen as people playing an instrument and
[32:14] one would be listening to the narrator
[32:17] and those on the instruments would be
[32:19] playing it. And so each character had a
[32:23] part to play and the sound a sound more
[32:26] than just a sound but all those
[32:28] different elements of music were
[32:29] associated with each character. So the
[32:32] composer
[32:33] through his own his own uh thought
[32:36] process uh let's try not to read that
[32:39] one just yet there. So I want you to
[32:40] stay with me before we get there. The
[32:43] the composer chose these instruments for
[32:46] a reason. It's a reason why uh the
[32:49] bassoon is used to portray the
[32:52] grandfather or the the French horns, the
[32:54] wolf, because there's a way that they
[32:56] could be used a certain register, a
[32:58] certain texture or dynamic that could be
[33:00] used to convey that personality or that
[33:03] character of each one of those
[33:04] individuals. So he did did it to convey
[33:07] the nature of the characters. And so
[33:09] each instrument properly mastered and
[33:12] played could express the nature and
[33:15] character individually of what was in
[33:16] that composition.
[33:23] Proop
[33:25] says this about it and this is that
[33:26] slide we had there for a moment.
[33:29] This is what he wrote. It's translated
[33:31] when he when it was being introduced in
[33:32] America and this was provided in the
[33:34] English as kind of a preface to this. He
[33:39] says before an orchestral performance it
[33:41] is desirable to show these instruments
[33:43] to the children and to play on them the
[33:47] corresponding late motifs. So they're
[33:49] saying let them see the instrument how
[33:51] it works what's being used to make the
[33:53] sounds and different notes. You see
[33:54] because this uh is being used for a very
[33:57] specific purpose. And here it is thereby
[34:00] the children learn to distinguish
[34:03] the senorities of the instrument during
[34:05] the performance of this tale. They learn
[34:08] to appreciate. They learn to distinguish
[34:11] and discern the quality, the prominence.
[34:15] They learn it so that whenever they're
[34:17] all playing together, it just doesn't
[34:19] become a bunch of fuss, right? Not just
[34:22] a bunch of racket, but they're like,
[34:23] "Oh, I hear the bird. I hear the cat. I
[34:26] hear this." And they can say, "I know
[34:27] what instrument that is. I know what
[34:28] instrument that this is."
[34:30] So it's done, this entire composition
[34:33] was done for the purpose of teaching
[34:37] distinction
[34:39] for knowing the sounds of different
[34:40] instruments and how they're playing and
[34:42] knowing how they're supposed to be
[34:44] conveyed.
[34:45] I know this may be uh supremely boring
[34:49] for some. So I'm glad you're catching up
[34:51] on your sleep. as the story unfolds as
[34:54] it begins as each one of these
[34:55] instruments says with the bird is played
[34:57] by the flute and there's a that little
[34:59] melody is played out and everyone s
[35:01] hears it but then he says that the
[35:02] narrator begins to tell the story. So
[35:06] now he's telling the story it's been
[35:07] introduced all the different parts and
[35:09] characters are introduced and the
[35:11] narrator tells the story and the
[35:13] narrator foreshadows it. He tells it and
[35:16] then the orchestra illustrates what he
[35:19] just said.
[35:21] the duck is playing and he gives the he
[35:23] he says it he reads it it's already been
[35:26] written and as he reads it and says it
[35:28] then it's played out
[35:30] &gt;&gt; so using their different instruments the
[35:33] orchestra plays that theme to express
[35:36] each character in the story
[35:39] and you may be thinking no one has ever
[35:41] cared that much about Peter and the wolf
[35:43] when they read it in shalom in these
[35:46] different places but I believe it's
[35:47] there for a purpose
[35:49] &gt;&gt; and when you realize ize that brother is
[35:50] like Peter and the wolf. It's acting out
[35:52] of drama. And you go and you look at
[35:53] Peter and the wolf and you realize that
[35:54] it was done to teach. It was done done
[35:56] to understand different distinctions.
[35:58] And brother Brandham in the midst of
[36:00] preaching this is using 1 Corinthians
[36:02] 12. And he's using uh he's using these
[36:04] different 1 Corinthians 14. He's saying
[36:06] there's different sounds, there's
[36:08] different distinctions. We have to know
[36:09] what they are because if you don't catch
[36:12] it, you're not interested in it, you
[36:13] won't recognize your day and its
[36:15] message. Right?
[36:18] And
[36:18] &gt;&gt; if we could look at it this way as the
[36:20] narrator says narrator says something
[36:23] according to the composition, the
[36:25] composer isn't necessarily the narrator,
[36:27] but the one who has the composition and
[36:29] understands it begins to narrate and
[36:31] then in response to the narrator, the
[36:33] musicians play their part. We can look
[36:36] at at this if we use brother Brandham's
[36:38] emphasis. God is the composer. The
[36:41] message is the narrator. And then we as
[36:43] the believer were the orchestra to
[36:45] illustrate it after it has been
[36:47] narrated.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; The message is not be to be read as
[36:51] history. It's to be read as your cue.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; It's to be read as a narration of your
[36:56] life that it says and the bride will do
[36:58] this. You're like, well, here I go. My
[37:00] turn and this will happen. Then you know
[37:02] this is what's happening. So the message
[37:04] is narrating the composition. It's
[37:07] queuing us up for what is next. I
[37:09] believe that pattern could even be said
[37:10] to have proceeded through the ages with
[37:13] each messenger and each star and the
[37:15] candlestick associated with it.
[37:18] Let's just use this one part. I think
[37:20] it's appropriate since it's called Peter
[37:22] and the wolf.
[37:24] The wolf even itself, the composition
[37:27] identifies that antagonist, the one that
[37:29] is feared and despised. This one who is
[37:32] represented, get this spiritual type by
[37:34] three horns, right? You got that unholy
[37:38] trinity,
[37:39] &gt;&gt; got horns. And Ezekiel 22:27,
[37:44] her princes in the midst thereof are
[37:45] like wolves ravening the prey to shed
[37:48] blood and to destroy souls to get
[37:50] dishonest gain. Those in Israel who had
[37:53] become wicked and their understanding
[37:55] defiled, they acted as wolves. Wolves
[37:58] are being characterized negatively here.
[38:00] I stumbled across a whole segment of how
[38:02] to appropriately balance out the
[38:05] negative themes in Peter and the Wolf
[38:07] about wolves with the more positive
[38:09] themes about wolves.
[38:12] Okay,
[38:15] these wolves are ravening.
[38:18] Matthew chapter 7 verse1 15 Jesus says
[38:21] beware of false prophets which come to
[38:23] you in sheep's clothing
[38:26] but inwardly they are ravening wolves
[38:31] wolves in sheep's clothing that's not a
[38:34] fairy tale
[38:35] that's just not a folk tale that's
[38:37] reality
[38:39] &gt;&gt; beware of those false prophets who dress
[38:42] who act who try to play the part but in
[38:44] fact are not that part but they have
[38:47] selfish motives motives. They have
[38:49] things that they desire to gain at your
[38:51] expense. Luke 10:3, "Go your ways.
[38:54] Behold, I send you forth as lambs among
[38:56] wolves."
[38:58] Notice the protagonist, excuse me, the
[39:00] antagonist in Peter and the Wolf, that
[39:01] the villain,
[39:03] the the evil, the bad guy, is portrayed
[39:06] by the wolf
[39:08] &gt;&gt; who is uh has an ominous sound. And it's
[39:12] done in certain ways to try to make it
[39:14] seem like this wolf is cunning and he's
[39:16] he's careful and he's proddding and he's
[39:19] trying to trying to devour and to eat.
[39:21] It even has the theme where the the
[39:23] grandpa is saying, "Hey, look Peter, you
[39:25] got to be careful of the wolf
[39:28] in John 10:12. But he that is a hireling
[39:30] and not the shepherd whose own who who
[39:33] own who's owned the sheep or not
[39:38] seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the
[39:40] sheep and fleth. It's exactly what
[39:42] happens with these false prophets with
[39:45] the hierling.
[39:46] Whenever danger appear they're going to
[39:48] they're going to cover themselves and
[39:50] they're going to cover themselves at the
[39:51] expense of the sheep. And it says the
[39:52] wolf catcheth them and scatterth the
[39:54] sheep.
[39:56] The hireling lets the wolves prey on
[39:58] God's flock. And again, there's that
[40:00] image of the wolf being the hunter,
[40:03] hunting after God's flock. In Acts 20
[40:07] 29, for I know this, that after my
[40:09] departing shall grievous wolves enter in
[40:11] among you, not sparing the flock. They
[40:13] don't care. Going to misuse it. They're
[40:15] going to abuse it.
[40:17] And so this Satan and these false
[40:20] workers, they're all portrayed
[40:22] as
[40:24] working against the believers, fighting
[40:26] as being viewing uh children of God as
[40:29] prey. The wolf is portrayed even in the
[40:31] Peter and the wolf as kind of being
[40:33] sneaky and strong. He moves silently
[40:35] through the trees. He's something to be
[40:36] feared and to be respected. Lock the
[40:38] gate because he's going to try to get in
[40:40] and be careful of what's out there in
[40:41] the dark forest.
[40:44] Peter in 1 Peter chapter 5:8, not Peter
[40:46] and Peter and the wolf, but Peter the
[40:48] apostle, be sober, be vigilant, because
[40:50] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[40:52] lion walketh about seeking whom he may
[40:55] devour.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; He roars. There's a howling like a wolf.
[40:58] He is looking for prey.
[41:01] So this composition we could say as it
[41:04] would a certain image is being created
[41:07] through the use of the musical
[41:08] instrument. Brother Brandham is
[41:09] identifying this when he teaches. Can
[41:12] you recognize what's happening now in
[41:14] the change of the music? You got to know
[41:16] what the music says so that whenever a
[41:18] different instrument starts playing, you
[41:19] can recognize what that is,
[41:21] &gt;&gt; where you're at in the story.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; So you could recognize, ah, now that's
[41:26] the French horn,
[41:28] &gt;&gt; right? You ever heard a human
[41:30] impersonate a French horn? Immediately
[41:32] something's wrong with that or that
[41:34] person.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Just the screaming and the shrilling and
[41:37] the way that they could make it sound.
[41:38] So there is a there's the sense of oh
[41:41] that is an uncertain sound that that
[41:45] that that's the that's the devil that's
[41:47] Satan that doesn't match that's in the
[41:50] symphony brother said if they don't get
[41:51] it right but it's in your sheet music
[41:53] it's be you're being told but you're
[41:55] able to identify it
[41:59] now this composition we just I think
[42:01] we're pretty close to just being able to
[42:02] sum sum
[42:04] we're almost we're getting somewhere
[42:08] This composition was used by brother
[42:11] Bannam as an example
[42:14] of sheet music and how music is written
[42:16] to help us to understand the end times
[42:20] to the time that we're living in
[42:24] that not only
[42:28] had a change come
[42:30] from the cycle of revival and death. Not
[42:33] only should we be outside
[42:36] of the the the composition and the
[42:38] movements of the church age that are
[42:41] looking to be revived
[42:43] from the cycle of death by another
[42:47] messenger,
[42:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[42:48] &gt;&gt; That we don't we don't look for another
[42:50] prophet. We don't look for even a
[42:52] prophet to come and fix what he didn't
[42:54] get right the first time. That there's
[42:55] not he's showing there's been a change
[42:58] in this cycle. there's been a change in
[43:00] the me in the message and the timing to
[43:02] where not only is he saying look this
[43:04] revival of this cycle of revival and
[43:06] death is now being broken in this end
[43:08] time. So not only is he wanting us to
[43:10] recognize there's been a change maybe a
[43:12] transition into Revelations 4, but he
[43:14] also uses it to for us to understand to
[43:17] teach us the importance of knowing the
[43:20] composition and your part in it.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We can't just sit back and say,
[43:26] "Well, not not going to be any more
[43:27] death, brother Eliza. Not going to be
[43:29] any more death."
[43:31] A and just sitting back and just kind of
[43:33] going with the flow. So that whenever
[43:34] there's some kind of fanaticism, we just
[43:36] kind of get caught up in that. And then
[43:37] when everything gets kind of legal, we
[43:38] just get kind of caught up in that. And
[43:40] we're just kind of going with the flow
[43:41] and the movement. And he said, "No, you
[43:43] need to recognize that there's different
[43:45] sounds and different roles and different
[43:47] parts." So you not only recognize the
[43:50] age and the time, but you begin to
[43:52] recognize who you are. in the drama.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; In the feast of the trumpets, he says
[43:58] like Peter and the wolf and the composer
[44:00] has wrote the book and the director must
[44:03] be in the same spirit of the composer.
[44:05] If he don't, he gives the wrong beat and
[44:07] then the whole thing is out. That's
[44:09] what's the matter today. We got too many
[44:12] directors not in the spirit of the
[44:14] composer.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; They say the denomination, well, we
[44:18] believe this. Well, you can just use
[44:19] whatever language you want to use, but
[44:20] too many chiefs, right? too many chefs
[44:23] in the kitchen, whatever analogy you
[44:25] want to use, but he says too many
[44:26] directors not in the spirit of the
[44:28] composer.
[44:29] So, the duplicity or the numerous
[44:33] directors is fine as they're all as long
[44:34] as they're all in the spirit of the
[44:36] composer. Not what you say. It's not
[44:39] what you no matter what you say the
[44:41] Bible is right. Beat it out according to
[44:43] the sheet music right here before it.
[44:46] Then the great symphony of God's great
[44:48] act is playing out just right. Then we
[44:52] can see the hour in where we are
[44:54] standing.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; When the directors are not in the spirit
[44:58] of the composer and they're ad libing a
[45:00] little bit saying, "Well, I think this
[45:01] would sound good here and I think this
[45:02] will sound good there." A and they're
[45:04] kind of changing it and they're adding
[45:06] in their own vocalization. They're
[45:08] wanting to put in their own bass track
[45:09] to it or they're wanting to use autotune
[45:11] and and get the pitch to different ways.
[45:13] There's a way that they're manipulating
[45:14] it and contriving it to fit their own
[45:16] narratives. And brother man says that's
[45:18] there's too many that are doing that.
[45:21] The Bible is right. Let it be played
[45:25] according to the word and then God's
[45:28] great symphony will be portrayed and
[45:30] we'll see where we are.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; I want to emphasize this in my closing.
[45:34] We need to learn the music.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; We need to understand the overall
[45:39] composition. It's why it's important
[45:41] that we be reading our Bibles. That's
[45:43] why it's important that you should still
[45:45] have an appetite to understand the
[45:47] message of God because we want to know
[45:50] the music as a whole.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; We want to understand the composition
[45:55] and God's mind and God's purpose.
[45:56] Opening up the the the things in the
[45:58] back part of God's mind. We're not just
[46:00] zeroing in on one detail. Well, I got
[46:01] this movement figured out. Watch what I
[46:04] can play.
[46:08] What's that one song where
[46:15] and man if you're 13 years old you're
[46:16] like woo this is awesome listen to what
[46:19] I can do come over here help me play
[46:20] this right it's like it's time to get
[46:22] out of those blinders on this works for
[46:25] me and this sounds good and recognize
[46:27] well how does that fit into the overall
[46:29] composition
[46:32] &gt;&gt; I'd say more importantly so well let me
[46:34] say it this way our part. If I'm saying
[46:37] that you have a part, our part depends
[46:39] upon the part of others.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; So, it's important that we recognize who
[46:44] we are in the way that we that we should
[46:47] endeavor to appreciate these other
[46:49] characters that are part of the drama.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; So, our part depends on somebody else
[46:55] playing their part. So we should
[46:57] appreciate how your part may be
[46:59] different than somebody else's part,
[47:01] &gt;&gt; but that it's all necessary in order for
[47:03] it to sound the way that it's supposed
[47:04] to sound. So as you the more you learn
[47:07] about the body of Christ, the more you
[47:08] learn about the word, more you learn
[47:10] about God's purpose and his heart and
[47:12] you read the scripture and you listen to
[47:13] the message of the hour, you're
[47:14] understanding the overall composition
[47:16] and you're being able to identify as the
[47:18] children would in that symphony. This is
[47:20] an obo. This is a bassoon. These these
[47:22] are French horns and these are the
[47:23] stringed instruments. These are the
[47:24] woodwinds and they represent this
[47:26] character and they represent that
[47:27] character and they begin to recognize
[47:29] distinctions because remember if you
[47:31] don't have distinction you don't have
[47:33] music.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; If you don't have differences you don't
[47:36] have a beautiful sound. So you have to
[47:38] begin to recognize
[47:40] those different sounds.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; But most importantly we need to know our
[47:44] part
[47:46] &gt;&gt; and how it fits in the composition and
[47:48] our timing in it.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even in the gifts, brother
[47:52] Brandham addressing the gifts. He was
[47:54] saying, "Well, we're not going to uh
[47:56] we're not going to take the gifts out of
[47:59] the church because they're in the word."
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Show me where they put them in. Show me
[48:04] where he put them out. But he does show
[48:05] that there's a certain rhythm, a certain
[48:07] timing, and there's a place for it. And
[48:09] he shows uh ho how prominent it should
[48:12] be, how it should be emphasized, how it
[48:15] should be used, what what we could be
[48:17] able to recognize when it's being
[48:18] inordinately used or wrongly emphasized.
[48:22] And so, yeah, some make the mistake of
[48:24] saying, "Wow, they're done with and
[48:25] they're done away with." And I had a
[48:26] brother, a pastor one time tell me, you
[48:28] know, that uh you know, when you're
[48:31] courting somebody and you uh and you uh
[48:34] you want you want to marry them, then
[48:35] you give them an engagement ring and you
[48:37] give them gifts. But then when you marry
[48:39] them, you don't need the gifts anymore.
[48:42] And you know, I guess I realized in that
[48:44] moment that I was growing up because I
[48:45] wanted to say, "Your wife threw away
[48:47] your engagement ring you gave her.
[48:49] She went back and threw away everything
[48:51] you gave her while you recording her."
[48:53] So the the type doesn't really work that
[48:55] way.
[48:56] But there does become this reality that
[48:58] there is one present which is Christ.
[49:00] And yes, there are still gifts, but the
[49:03] place that those gifts have to the point
[49:04] where brother Bam says they ought they
[49:06] should not be used in a manner that
[49:08] interferes with the word.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; And so he was placing them where they
[49:12] ought to be used within a church
[49:14] service. And well, I think that we
[49:15] should let me say this. There's a lot of
[49:18] things that we honor in the message of
[49:19] the hour because brother Brandham said
[49:20] it and we honor it because he said it.
[49:22] But it's amazing how sometimes we just
[49:24] can bull right past something say,
[49:26] "Well, every church is sovereign.
[49:29] Our deacons should be able to beat up
[49:31] whoever they want. Every church is
[49:33] sovereign."
[49:36] So, we have to know our part,
[49:39] appreciate these differences,
[49:43] and recognize that there's a placing.
[49:44] Sometimes these things find their place.
[49:47] In the sermon shalom paragraph 169 he
[49:49] says so we have these times of
[49:51] symphonies of the symphony of God's word
[49:54] that the whole drama changes
[49:57] you who are interested listen for that
[50:00] change.
[50:03] It's so beautiful how he preaches and
[50:06] preaches and preaches and to me it's
[50:07] like he's preaching like upper level
[50:08] courses in the message. It's like this
[50:10] is such a distinct departure of
[50:12] pre-sills and this is kind of the
[50:14] outflow of everything that he went
[50:15] through through that summer. Christ is
[50:16] the mystery of God revealed and even
[50:18] coming to some of those sermons he
[50:19] begins to preach and then uh souls in
[50:22] prison now but then look away to Jesus.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Some of these just landmark sermons at
[50:26] the end of 63. So now he's kind of
[50:28] ventured out with this caution. Can't
[50:30] say too much. Don't explain too much.
[50:32] This is where you made your mistake in
[50:33] the first pool and the second pool. But
[50:34] now that we know what it is and what it
[50:36] does, a and we're thoroughly convinced,
[50:38] it's thoroughly identified, thoroughly
[50:39] vindicated. Now the narrator knows
[50:41] exactly what's happening, but he's very
[50:43] careful not to give the whole plot away.
[50:44] He's very careful not to explain too
[50:46] much, but he's under a commission. And
[50:48] so he tells you, if you're interested,
[50:50] listen for the change.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; You know it's getting close. You hear
[50:57] the way the drums are beating.
[51:01] Want something to happen.
[51:04] You know, this is a change. It's going
[51:05] to break out into a burst in a few
[51:08] minutes. It's using that thought of a of
[51:11] uh music. There's some songs, and I
[51:15] would venture to say that many of us, if
[51:17] not all of us, could probably identify
[51:18] it in some songs that you listen to the
[51:21] song, and some of them kind of have a
[51:22] real predictable pattern where you have
[51:24] your verse, chorus, verse, chorus,
[51:26] bridge, and you just know it's coming.
[51:28] But you can hear how a song builds and
[51:30] the architecture building a song where
[51:32] it starts out with this and this starts
[51:34] coming in and then something kind of
[51:35] blends in the background and you could
[51:37] tell by the momentum of that song that
[51:39] when they come out of that one course
[51:42] there's maybe a chord change or beat or
[51:44] something changes where you know now
[51:46] it's going into a bridge. It's not just
[51:49] changing. And if you've just now figured
[51:52] out that I'm doing all this preaching so
[51:54] we could be a little bit more on time as
[51:55] singers, follow the song leader and the
[51:57] musicians and stop going in all these
[51:59] different directions, you found me out.
[52:00] But it's been fun. We've learned some
[52:03] things along the way. But there's a way
[52:04] that you listen and you're interested.
[52:06] You know, oh, something's getting to
[52:08] change.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Something's changing. And I I I love it
[52:12] especially and with good singing in a
[52:14] choir when they can make the chord
[52:17] change
[52:18] and they can all change to a different
[52:20] key. They can take it that step higher
[52:22] even a half step and the piano player
[52:24] doesn't have to stop and go
[52:27] and everybody goes
[52:29] right. They just know how to do it.
[52:32] He says you know it's going to change.
[52:34] It's going to burst forth in a few
[52:35] minutes and you're watching for it. You
[52:36] can tell the ways are drum the drums are
[52:38] timing. Oh God, if you can hear the
[52:42] drums of the finish now, if you can hear
[52:44] the echo of the music of the heavenly
[52:47] word singing itself out, it shall come
[52:50] to pass in the last days.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Church, listen. Listen to the change.
[52:54] Listen to the change of the rhythm, the
[52:56] change of the music. Be interested in
[52:58] it. The symphony of God's great drama
[53:00] that he's playing, it changes him,
[53:03] &gt;&gt; his symphony at the junctions. the
[53:06] composer and those who are interested.
[53:08] Listen for the change.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; That's what all this stuff is to us.
[53:12] We're listening. We're watching
[53:15] &gt;&gt; all this stuff. All these things he's
[53:18] preaching. If you go and listen, this is
[53:19] paragraph 169. Go back and listen to the
[53:21] first part. Preaches it again a week
[53:22] later. Listen to that first part. It's
[53:25] so if I was to tell you, oh, you need to
[53:27] listen to shalom. Those two sermons.
[53:28] Shalom. It's really brother Brandham
[53:30] uses music and musical composition. You
[53:32] might be straining it for a while and
[53:34] you might give up after a while and say,
[53:35] "Well, he never did get to the story."
[53:37] It's because he uses it at the end to
[53:40] kind of make his point in a very subtle
[53:42] way of where we are today.
[53:49] In Acts chapter 2, mentioned unity is so
[53:53] important. Let me just go through this
[53:54] very fast. Before the Holy Spirit poured
[53:58] out upon those gathered in the upper
[54:00] room, they were all with one accord,
[54:03] with one mind, with one purpose. They
[54:04] were had a unified passion.
[54:07] With one accord, it's a very unique
[54:09] Greek word. It's used 12 times in the
[54:10] New Testament. 10 times it's used in the
[54:13] book of Acts,
[54:15] I believe, for a reason. I've already
[54:17] said this before. The image is musical.
[54:19] Many different sounding notes,
[54:20] harmonizing,
[54:22] many different pitches, many different
[54:24] tones. There's no chaos. There's no
[54:26] disorder. It was harmonious. It was
[54:28] beautiful. It's even expressed in even
[54:33] in some ways as a paradox where they
[54:34] come out of the upper room speaking to
[54:36] some unknown tongues but to others music
[54:38] to their ears.
[54:40] So it's like the instruments as brother
[54:42] Bam's saying in a great orchestra or
[54:43] symphony under the direction of a
[54:45] conductor.
[54:47] It's the same image that we could say
[54:48] they were all with one accord. The Holy
[54:49] Ghost is blending even now blending our
[54:53] lives together.
[54:55] uses our differences. It uses our
[54:57] distinctions to harmonize them to
[54:59] fulfill God's word. In Acts chapter
[55:02] 4:32, it says, "And the multitude of
[55:03] them that believed were of one heart and
[55:05] of one soul. Neither said any of them
[55:08] that ought of the things which he
[55:10] possessed was his own." Nobody, listen,
[55:13] in the first church, we're being
[55:14] restored back to a book of Acts, right?
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Nobody claimed that the cars in the
[55:18] parking lot, even Teslas, were their
[55:19] own. We could all use them if we wanted
[55:22] to.
[55:27] It's the way it was in the first church.
[55:32] But they had all things in common.
[55:35] I think this sometimes is really
[55:36] misunderstood. I think my my dad,
[55:39] brother David, is probably a good
[55:40] example of what the misconception is. Is
[55:43] let's all live in the same house and
[55:44] wear the same clothes and eat the same
[55:45] food and have the same long hair and and
[55:48] make everything in common. And what do
[55:50] you make? You make a commune and you
[55:52] become a cult.
[55:54] unult.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; And that's what you become when you
[55:58] don't understand your part. Because when
[56:00] it says they had all things in common,
[56:01] it doesn't mean they all became carbon
[56:02] copies.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Something very beautiful about the
[56:06] reality that we are all originals,
[56:10] that we're not all just copies of an
[56:12] original.
[56:13] Because if you're there's a way that you
[56:15] just being a print that the more that is
[56:17] printed
[56:19] a print of a copy the more it begins to
[56:21] be distributed into and to the market
[56:23] and the more people that have it in
[56:24] reality it's really diminishing the
[56:27] value of the copies but God is such a
[56:29] master artist to where we are all
[56:31] originals
[56:33] &gt;&gt; because we're all part of the same
[56:35] composition.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; No oneoffs in this. And when they had
[56:40] all things in common they weren't just
[56:42] robots. They weren't just uh it wasn't
[56:44] all just homogyny, but they're and they
[56:47] weren't just all the same, but their
[56:50] unique gifts and their unique qualities
[56:52] had to be preserved. And when it says
[56:54] that nobody claimed that what they had
[56:56] was their own, it meant that there was
[56:58] some sharing of it with others so that
[57:01] there was this harmony in give and take.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; There it wasn't that, well, everything I
[57:07] have is yours. And everybody's like,
[57:09] awesome. That guy's pretty rich. He's
[57:10] got everything. We don't need I don't
[57:11] even need to work
[57:13] cuz this guy he makes shoes and this guy
[57:15] cooks this and he has eggs and I I but
[57:17] no everyone had something to give so
[57:20] that in the exchanging and the sharing
[57:22] they were all one.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; There was a blending together of
[57:26] different qualities and different gifts.
[57:28] So Paul admonishes the Corinthian church
[57:30] that we should all speak the same thing
[57:33] that there be no divisions among you
[57:35] perfectly joined together in the same
[57:36] mind and the same judgment. The language
[57:39] that he uses there in first Corinthians
[57:40] is that we'd be in perfect harmony and
[57:42] full agreement. No dissensions or
[57:44] factions or division divisions among
[57:46] you, but perfectly united in your common
[57:48] understanding
[57:50] in a symphony. One piece, whether it be
[57:53] a horn or whether it be another
[57:55] instrument or a percussion. It it may be
[57:58] beautiful and inspiring on its own on
[58:00] its own. Or it may seem really odd. Have
[58:03] you ever been listening to music being
[58:04] played in another room and it's just
[58:06] kind of filtered out just enough to
[58:08] where you're hearing something like, "Oh
[58:09] my goodness,
[58:10] &gt;&gt; that guitar player's out of tune. What
[58:12] What is that?" You don't hear the whole
[58:14] thing. You only hear that one part. And
[58:18] then when you get in a room where you
[58:19] can hear all of it, it almost disappears
[58:21] and it goes, "Oh, that's beautiful."
[58:25] So something on its own could be
[58:26] beautiful, could be inspiring, or it
[58:28] could be horrible. But when the whole
[58:29] thing gets together,
[58:31] every instrument, the woodwinds, the the
[58:33] strings, the brass, the percussions,
[58:35] they all work together in unison, it
[58:36] produces something greater than the
[58:38] individual part.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Makes some of the most beautiful sounds.
[58:47] I told brother Michael I'd credit his
[58:48] grandpa, brother Lonnie, for this, but
[58:49] brother Michael shared with me on Sunday
[58:51] the different definitions of being
[58:52] composed.
[58:54] Something be can be composed wherein you
[58:56] write or create a work of art.
[58:59] But then to be composed also means
[59:01] you're in control of your emotions.
[59:03] You're in control of your feelings.
[59:06] You've composed yourself.
[59:08] You're going to respond properly. You're
[59:10] not going to blurt out. You're not going
[59:12] to get out of place. You're not going to
[59:13] interrupt somebody else. And I think
[59:15] this is what it speaks to when we all
[59:16] should be of one heart and one soul. We
[59:18] don't all have the same part. But when
[59:20] one someone else h someone else has
[59:22] their part, you're supporting them.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; You've made a good you've laid a good
[59:25] foundation for them.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; That's that's how we should feel as a as
[59:30] people who sing, as people who play, as
[59:32] congregants that were we're I'm
[59:34] supporting this person. I want to make
[59:35] it easier for them to do their job. When
[59:37] you hear their part and they're getting
[59:38] their their recognition and they're
[59:40] rejoicing, then you know your part's
[59:41] coming. Paul said, "Because when we all
[59:43] suffer, when one suffers, we all
[59:44] suffer."
[59:46] &gt;&gt; So it's those distinctions. Again, in
[59:48] the beginning, part of my inspiration is
[59:50] that if we don't have distinctions and
[59:52] differences, we don't have music.
[59:55] But being disunified and separate, we
[59:58] still have noise.
[1:00:00] But if we could come together and be
[1:00:02] united together and find our part, as it
[1:00:05] says in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, that
[1:00:07] God hath tempered the body together. It
[1:00:10] means he's united all these different
[1:00:12] parts one to another to create one
[1:00:15] structure. He's caused several different
[1:00:17] parts, harmony parts, rhythm parts,
[1:00:21] instruments, chords, and notes into one
[1:00:23] structure.
[1:00:26] Musicians, if you could come. And he
[1:00:27] says, there ought not to be any schism
[1:00:30] in the body
[1:00:32] because by one spirit, you've been
[1:00:33] baptized into one body and now being in
[1:00:36] one body. By one bread, we're all
[1:00:38] partakers of that one bread, we become
[1:00:39] part of one body. He says, "Let there be
[1:00:41] no schism, no division, no disunityity."
[1:00:44] excism is to tear apart to take a cloth
[1:00:47] rip into separate pieces.
[1:00:51] My title was your moment.
[1:00:55] And
[1:01:02] I that's what we ought to be
[1:01:07] desiring to understand is who who am I?
[1:01:11] Not selfishly, but who I who am I in the
[1:01:16] composition?
[1:01:18] I want to play my part.
[1:01:21] And what the devil does and what the
[1:01:22] world does, he tried to break things up,
[1:01:24] make us feel insufficient, insecure. But
[1:01:27] Paul says that there should be there is
[1:01:30] no unnecessary
[1:01:32] or independent part of the body.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; The foot can't just say, you know what,
[1:01:37] I've been holding you guys up for a long
[1:01:39] time.
[1:01:41] I'm going to leave.
[1:01:43] I I I I I don't I'm tired of being
[1:01:46] stepped used to step on. I'm tired of
[1:01:48] this. I'm tired of that. You know, the
[1:01:49] the finger can't say, "I'm tired of
[1:01:51] going in your nose. I'm getting out of
[1:01:52] here." There it's it's stuck.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; It's part of the body. And so, likewise,
[1:01:57] we should not think of the body and our
[1:02:00] part in the body as being unnecessary or
[1:02:02] think that we can be independent.
[1:02:05] I believe that's the the great sin of
[1:02:07] how the devil gets us kind of worked out
[1:02:09] and to to the side and and we make
[1:02:11] different mistakes because we start to
[1:02:13] think independently of how we fit within
[1:02:16] the overall purpose of God's word even
[1:02:18] as it relates to church, our
[1:02:20] participation in local church, our
[1:02:22] attendance, our paying tithes, our our
[1:02:24] lending support or being conscious of
[1:02:26] the needs. Those are ways that we begin
[1:02:27] to function independently.
[1:02:30] reminds me today I was supposed to bring
[1:02:33] greetings to you from brother Israel
[1:02:34] Escalante who wanted to say he loves
[1:02:36] you. He's the one that cut my hair
[1:02:37] today. Isn't it beautiful? And he's he
[1:02:39] he just sh was sharing his testimony
[1:02:41] today in the presence of the Lord came
[1:02:42] and he's crying and glad he had a towel
[1:02:44] over my face cuz I knew I wasn't going
[1:02:46] to get hit with anything. But my tears
[1:02:47] start welling up. And part of the
[1:02:49] testimony was just how necessary it is.
[1:02:51] How Satan tries to get you out away and
[1:02:53] vulnerable. And that's when things start
[1:02:55] going into a tail spin. But as it
[1:02:57] relates to God's composition, the sheet
[1:03:00] music, there's no parts that are
[1:03:01] despendable, expendable. Say, ah, who
[1:03:04] needs that? Bass soon. We could tell
[1:03:06] this story without that. Oh, who needs
[1:03:08] this? It's all necessary. Using the
[1:03:11] analogy of the human body, there are no
[1:03:13] tonsils
[1:03:15] and there is no appendix.
[1:03:17] One medical dictionary said, "An
[1:03:19] appendix serves no function in humans
[1:03:22] and is thought to be a remnant of our
[1:03:23] primitive past. And if that doesn't just
[1:03:26] weak of modern religion.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, there's really no need for
[1:03:30] that. Uh that was part of our primitive
[1:03:32] past as Christians and we've evolved.
[1:03:34] There is no necessary distinction among
[1:03:36] genders. What's gender anyways?
[1:03:39] Something. It's just a remnant of this
[1:03:41] and a remnant of that. That's modern
[1:03:42] religion. Unable to reconcile
[1:03:44] differences. What they do is they just
[1:03:47] remove what is necessary or create
[1:03:50] unnecessary things
[1:03:53] because they don't recognize the
[1:03:54] composition, how God's composed the
[1:03:56] body, how it all fits together. Because
[1:03:58] in God's design, every part contributes
[1:04:00] to the health of the whole body. I've
[1:04:01] got a number of scriptures I could read
[1:04:03] to you, but they all work together in
[1:04:04] proportion and symmetry and function.
[1:04:06] Even those parts you don't see or that
[1:04:08] are uncommonly. He says God uses them to
[1:04:11] produce a greater beauty.
[1:04:14] the body of Christ and you as an
[1:04:15] individual should be unified, tempered
[1:04:17] together, fused together into one
[1:04:19] harmonious whole.
[1:04:21] And you may not feel like much. You may
[1:04:23] not feel like you've got a great part,
[1:04:24] but every part is necessary.
[1:04:28] God's watched out over the symphony.
[1:04:30] He's wrote every movement.
[1:04:32] And he comes to a time where now to
[1:04:34] represent the end times. He chooses a
[1:04:37] piece that has no movements
[1:04:42] that follows takes its momentum from the
[1:04:45] beginning and through the whole story.
[1:04:47] Each part's played out and then there's
[1:04:49] a triumphal procession
[1:04:52] and one of the characters in the duck in
[1:04:56] the original Peter and the Wolf is eaten
[1:04:59] alive by the wolf.
[1:05:02] And so as there's a great procession of
[1:05:05] all and they're coming each character is
[1:05:07] coming and the wolf has been vanquished
[1:05:09] and he's being held by the hunters and
[1:05:10] as they come through the pro procession
[1:05:12] each one being represented by their
[1:05:15] music and the sound and the drums are
[1:05:17] foreshadowing who's next to at that
[1:05:19] point you almost don't even need the
[1:05:20] narrator but the very end there's a a
[1:05:24] distinct sound that if you're not
[1:05:26] listening for it and you're not
[1:05:28] interested in it you'll miss it and the
[1:05:30] nar narrator says, "Listen, what is that
[1:05:33] you hear? It's the sound of the duck
[1:05:38] who's still yet alive,
[1:05:40] though it looks like though the wolf ate
[1:05:42] him cuz the wolf ate him alive." It's
[1:05:45] going to be a resurrection.
[1:05:47] Those that went before, they're they're
[1:05:49] still going to live. And so when we look
[1:05:52] at God's composition, when we look at
[1:05:54] this great symphony that God has watched
[1:05:56] out over and he's watched, he's
[1:05:57] conducted and he's governed it all the
[1:05:58] way down to this very moment that you're
[1:06:01] living in right now. And whatever
[1:06:04] instrument you play, even the way that
[1:06:06] I've thought about it quite often is,
[1:06:07] let's just say that all you have is I
[1:06:10] think it's called an angle. It might be
[1:06:11] called a triangle, but all you have is
[1:06:14] all you have
[1:06:16] is an angle. and you're sitting there
[1:06:18] and and you go through every part, every
[1:06:20] part and you're just sitting there.
[1:06:23] Enjoy the symphony.
[1:06:26] Stay pay attention cuz there's going to
[1:06:28] come a moment where your time comes
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; and the conductor is going to give you
[1:06:34] the look and the drums are going to give
[1:06:36] you the signal and it's going to be your
[1:06:38] moment. Ding.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; And some people may think, well, that
[1:06:43] was that seemed to be pretty
[1:06:45] insignificant. not to the composer.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; It's your moment.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing that God's doing
[1:06:53] in this end time. Look at it. Read it
[1:06:54] with an eye to what is happening in this
[1:06:57] day and age. Not a not a history lesson,
[1:06:59] not a musical lesson, but an opening of
[1:07:02] our understanding. Brother Brandham
[1:07:04] didn't watch the Disney Peter and the
[1:07:06] Wolf and all of a sudden say, "Well, I'm
[1:07:07] going to see if I can shoehorn this in a
[1:07:09] little bit for the youngsters."
[1:07:11] Something was quickened to the prophet
[1:07:12] to use something for us to grasp.
[1:07:16] what's happened in this hour.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Stay in your lane, learn your role,
[1:07:20] right? Hike your own hike. Whatever
[1:07:22] analogy you want to use, you have an
[1:07:24] opportunity to do your part.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Let's stand and pray together. Our
[1:07:28] gracious heavenly father, Lord, at the
[1:07:30] close of this service. I pushed it maybe
[1:07:32] past uh my own comfort level in terms of
[1:07:35] time, but I'm grateful that I've been
[1:07:37] able to deliver this to such a wonderful
[1:07:39] audience.
[1:07:40] I ask Lord that through what may seem to
[1:07:43] be the minutia of music and chords and
[1:07:46] history
[1:07:48] and even on a Wednesday night Lord I
[1:07:50] know people are tired and
[1:07:53] their bodies are weary and they're here
[1:07:54] and I
[1:07:56] I'd rather them be here even if they do
[1:07:59] doze off a little bit than just
[1:08:00] forsaking their posted duty and not
[1:08:03] being at church. So forgive me Lord if
[1:08:05] it's inappropriate to just call out
[1:08:08] the weariness. I mean no offense by it
[1:08:11] but I do believe there's something
[1:08:13] important in these things that we don't
[1:08:15] want to miss. He said if we're wide
[1:08:17] awake we'd catch it. The emphasis
[1:08:20] tonight was those who are listening,
[1:08:21] those who are interested, they'll catch
[1:08:23] it.
[1:08:25] Lord, we are too distracted
[1:08:31] by a distraction.
[1:08:33] We're led astray. We miss our parts. We
[1:08:36] miss our queue. But you're always
[1:08:37] faithful to cycle back around.
[1:08:41] When the bride was came back in view
[1:08:44] again to her music, marching in beaten,
[1:08:47] this great symphony wherein she ascends,
[1:08:50] there's no other movement. Leodysia
[1:08:52] descends into chaos. The bride ascends
[1:08:55] into heaven. She begins to rise. She
[1:08:58] gets a little bit out of step. But there
[1:09:00] is the word of God, the director, the
[1:09:03] Holy Spirit, the narrator, the conductor
[1:09:06] saying, "Get back in step."
[1:09:09] Lord, sometimes our timing is off. May
[1:09:11] we use that half measure, whatever it
[1:09:13] takes to get back in step.
[1:09:15] Bless your people tonight for their
[1:09:16] diligence, their faithfulness, their
[1:09:18] fortitude to listen to these things and
[1:09:20] the way it's taught. And I trust that
[1:09:22] they'll be benefited by it as you use
[1:09:24] it. Lord, we ask all this in the name of
[1:09:26] Lord Jesus Christ.
