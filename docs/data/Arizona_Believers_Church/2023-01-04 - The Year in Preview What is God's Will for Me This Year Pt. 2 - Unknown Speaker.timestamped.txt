[0:00] My title tonight, we skipped I had the
[0:02] title slide there. We'll give it to you
[0:03] again at the outset. Um continuing on
[0:05] where we were on uh Sunday morning on
[0:09] the year in preview. And so the year in
[0:11] preview, not year in review, but year in
[0:13] preview and asking the question, what is
[0:16] God's will for me this year? So much to
[0:18] expound upon in the things that we
[0:20] expressed on Sunday morning. I'd like to
[0:22] take a little bit of a different
[0:23] direction for our Wednesday night crowd,
[0:25] but we are continuing on this subject
[0:27] tonight. And in Joshua chapter 1:es 7
[0:30] and 8, we're going to take our text here
[0:31] and then we'll focus on it right at the
[0:34] beginning and then want to move forward
[0:35] a little bit. He's speaking, God
[0:37] speaking to Joshua. And it says, "Only
[0:40] be thou and it after he said, you know,
[0:42] be strong and very courageous." Only be
[0:44] thou very strong and strong and very
[0:46] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[0:48] do
[0:50] according to all the law which Moses my
[0:52] servant commanded thee. Turn not from it
[0:54] to the right hand or to the left that
[0:56] thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou
[0:58] goest. So his prospering in the way a
[1:00] prospering path whatever you do is
[1:02] contingent upon him observing the word
[1:04] that was given by Moses. This book of
[1:06] the law shall not depart of thy mouth
[1:08] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:10] night that thou mayest observe to do
[1:12] according to all that is written therein
[1:14] for then thou shalt make thy way
[1:15] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[1:19] success. Amen. You could take your
[1:21] seats. I believe that we all want to
[1:23] have good success this year. We'd like
[1:25] to be prosperous. I think even brother
[1:27] Loyal mentioned it when he was
[1:29] ministering about make money. Um and so
[1:32] we know that we want to be prosperous.
[1:33] We want to have good success. And we're
[1:34] going to be we're identifying things
[1:36] both this past Sunday and even tonight
[1:38] on how we can make that possible. So
[1:41] we're continue on the year in preview.
[1:43] Uh this is part two on what is God's
[1:45] will for me this year. We're very
[1:46] specific towards the end of the service
[1:48] on Sunday morning. We'll be again
[1:50] specific tonight. I want to start again
[1:52] where we started Sunday morning. Psalms
[1:54] 119 verse 133. It says, "Order my steps
[1:57] in thy word. And let not any iniquity
[2:00] have dominion over me. Make my motions
[2:02] and my actions firm. Solidify them. Make
[2:05] them consistent." And that's what is
[2:08] being requested here. Order my steps in
[2:10] thy word. So we want to be stepping in
[2:12] his word. We want our steps to be
[2:13] ordered by the Lord. Bible tells us that
[2:16] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[2:18] the Lord. So we that's what we want is
[2:20] our steps to be ordered. He wants to
[2:21] ordain steps for us. We want to walk in
[2:23] those steps that he has ordained for us.
[2:25] So, this is a prayer to make our steps
[2:27] consistent, to make them firm, to make
[2:29] them sure. Uh we don't want to step and
[2:31] then slip. We don't want to step on
[2:33] sinking sand. We want to know the way
[2:35] that we're going. And I think the way
[2:36] that we used it on Sunday morning is we
[2:38] want our way to match his way. And so,
[2:41] if even if it's not what we want
[2:43] exactly, but we know this is what he
[2:44] wants, then the way that we take will be
[2:47] his way. And that was exemplified where
[2:49] Jesus said, I if this cup could pass,
[2:51] it'd be great. My will would be that I
[2:53] don't have to die, but nevertheless, let
[2:55] thy will be done. It was an abandonment
[2:57] of his own agenda. And he took the way
[3:00] that God had chosen. And that's how we
[3:02] can harmonize our desires with his by
[3:04] taking the way that he wants us to go.
[3:07] And another way of putting that is
[3:08] subjecting our will, whatever that might
[3:10] be, to his will whenever we can identify
[3:12] it. And so when we ask this question,
[3:15] what is God's will for me this year? Uh
[3:17] it's an invitation to identify what his
[3:19] will is and then in identifying what it
[3:21] is. We're going to choose it. I know
[3:23] this is what God wants me to do. And
[3:24] then when we choose it, we submit to it.
[3:26] We act on it. We let it come out into
[3:28] into motion into manifestation.
[3:31] And I do believe and it's it's nice to
[3:33] have kind of this uh reset of a change
[3:35] of a year and an opportunity to use it
[3:38] as kind of a transition point. We used
[3:40] it from a unique perspective of the
[3:41] doorway effect. And I trust that none of
[3:43] us are plagued by it tonight. since we
[3:45] left out those doors, we've forgotten
[3:47] everything that was preached on Sunday.
[3:49] But I think this kind of affords us a
[3:51] nice chance to re reset a little bit and
[3:53] think about certain things uh and and
[3:55] kind of give a a look at our desires and
[3:59] our ambitions and what our vision might
[4:00] be. And I'm wanting to use this uh
[4:04] thought because I've been very
[4:05] deliberate about this for the last month
[4:07] or so in my mind as I've thought about
[4:08] these things is you have and I say we we
[4:12] all have the freedom to choose the path
[4:14] that we're going to take in this year.
[4:16] And you say, "Oh, what about God? What
[4:18] God ordains and what God does." Now, so
[4:20] I can say this that if we accept God's
[4:23] providence and that he's going to ordain
[4:25] a path and we're going to end up where
[4:27] he wants us to be, I'll say this.
[4:29] There's a lot of choices you make along
[4:31] the way that's going to determine what
[4:33] that journey's like.
[4:34] Whether or not it's going to be a happy
[4:35] mission, whether it's going to be very
[4:36] sad, whether it's a lot of be heartache
[4:38] in it. There's a lot of things that you
[4:40] can do in this pathway to determine your
[4:43] reward in the end. The blessings that
[4:45] you receive while you travel this way.
[4:46] Because I believe that by the grace of
[4:48] God, we're going to make it and we're
[4:50] going to be overcomers. But I want to
[4:52] live I want to bring forth a hundfold. I
[4:54] don't want to fall short of any promise
[4:56] or any blessing. And that's really what
[4:58] we're desiring for you and your families
[4:59] and in your lives is that we live that
[5:02] hundfold and we identify the things that
[5:04] pleases God and we we do the best that
[5:06] we can. I'd even go so far as to say
[5:08] that our salvation is secure and and we
[5:10] own it and our health is secured in
[5:12] Christ. There's a lot of benefits and
[5:14] blessings we have as the family of God.
[5:15] But I don't want it just to end there. I
[5:17] want to be able to benefit my neighbors.
[5:19] I want to benefit my extended family. I
[5:21] want my co-workers and people I
[5:22] associate with. I want their lives to be
[5:24] better because I'm a part of it. Amen.
[5:26] And I'm never going to be able to do
[5:27] that if I'm just just barely getting by
[5:30] in my own life. I want there to be I
[5:32] think I can't remember who it was that
[5:33] may have wrote it. Brother Phillip, you
[5:35] may know, but I'm drinking from my
[5:36] saucer because my cup is overflowing.
[5:38] The first time I ever heard that one,
[5:39] some one of the believers there at Mesa
[5:41] Church saying it. And in some ways,
[5:42] that's where we want our lives to be is
[5:45] our lives just overflowing so that other
[5:46] people can experience it and be
[5:48] benefited by it. So there's a lot of
[5:50] things that we have liberty to choose
[5:53] a and things to change like this needs
[5:55] to change in my life and that's what the
[5:56] turn of the year maybe gives us the
[5:58] opportunity to look back and say I
[5:59] wasn't doing this I want to do this in
[6:00] the new year I need to stop doing this I
[6:03] I want to start doing this might a lot
[6:04] of things that we can change start or
[6:06] stop but this is the time to think about
[6:08] it uh this is the moment I'm wanting us
[6:10] to think about it as a church and this
[6:13] is a statement I actually I wrote it out
[6:15] so I could just say it very deliberately
[6:17] and specifically there's a lot that's
[6:18] built behind it when I say this and I
[6:20] want you maybe to ponder it without me
[6:22] amplifying it this evening, but
[6:25] spiritual growth and spiritual maturity
[6:27] are demonstrated in the deliberate
[6:28] choices we make. And so your your your
[6:32] spiritual growth and your maturity are
[6:34] going to be manifested in the conscious
[6:36] choices that you are making, the way
[6:38] that you choose in not only your
[6:40] actions, but the way you think about
[6:41] things, the way you respond to things.
[6:43] And and there's ways that we can be
[6:45] responding as parents where in the
[6:46] moment we're making a deliberate choice
[6:48] to respond a certain way. There's ways
[6:50] that we can be responding to other
[6:51] people, decisions we're making with
[6:53] respect to finances and other things
[6:55] that manifest a spiritual growth and
[6:58] maturity and even emotional maturity
[7:00] because our emotional maturity is part
[7:02] of our growing character as Christians.
[7:04] And so we want to be growing
[7:05] spiritually, want to be growing
[7:06] emotionally. And these are things that
[7:08] should be important to us as Christians.
[7:10] and they're manifest in the choices we
[7:13] make. So God gives you liberty to choose
[7:15] and that still at the end of the day can
[7:17] never interrupt God's sovereignty. So in
[7:19] his sovereignty, he's given us this
[7:21] latitude to make certain decisions and
[7:23] we want to be making the right
[7:24] decisions. And I want to use Joshua
[7:27] chapter 1 7 and 8 as kind of um a
[7:31] support for that statement about our
[7:33] maturity and our development being
[7:35] expressed in the choices we make.
[7:37] Because your spiritual success is
[7:39] dependent upon decisions that you make.
[7:42] And we know that it's by grace that we
[7:44] are saved. We know that it's his grace
[7:45] that workketh in us. Even as the Bible
[7:47] teaches us, it's him that is both in us
[7:49] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[7:51] It's not him that willth or him that
[7:52] runth, but God that giveth the increase
[7:54] and God that shows mercy. But did you
[7:56] know you still have to will and you
[7:58] still have to run? You still have to
[8:00] submit. You still have to yield. You
[8:01] still have to make decisions and
[8:03] choices. And that's what we're
[8:04] identifying is our purpose and a
[8:07] determination as Christians to do the
[8:09] right thing. So it says in Joshua 1 7
[8:12] and 8 and and I'd like there's a lot we
[8:15] can amplify here, but we just want to
[8:17] point out a few things. Only be thou
[8:19] strong and very courageous that thou
[8:21] mayest observe to do according to all
[8:24] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[8:26] thee. Turn not from it to the right hand
[8:28] or to the left. So he's wanting he's
[8:31] saying that what he ought to do is be
[8:34] courageous be strong and courageous. So
[8:36] there's something within his uh uncction
[8:38] and his desire his fortitude
[8:41] that needs to be directed towards all
[8:43] that he has been given by the prophet so
[8:45] that he may obey observe to do all not
[8:48] just part of it all that Moses
[8:49] commanded. Turn not from it to the right
[8:51] hand or to the left that so that you may
[8:54] be that thou mayest prosper
[8:56] whethersoever thou goest. So the success
[8:59] of Joshua and his prospering in his way
[9:01] and in his journey. And if we could use
[9:02] that as an analogy for us that our
[9:04] success this year is going to be
[9:06] dependent upon how courageous we are and
[9:08] how strong we are in observing to do the
[9:11] things that God wants us to do. And just
[9:13] as Joshua had to dig down deep and find
[9:15] some courage to observe it, we have to
[9:18] do the same thing to have this courage
[9:20] to choose the right thing so that we may
[9:22] prosper in the way that we go. I think
[9:24] there could be ways that we could
[9:26] express this that you can reach the
[9:27] finish line and we're all going to reach
[9:28] the finish line. It's just a question of
[9:30] what kind of condition do you want to be
[9:32] in when you get there. And I really do
[9:34] want to be in that image of an overcomer
[9:36] more than a conqueror. I want to be one
[9:38] that I is radiating in the glory of
[9:40] Christ when I cross that line so that
[9:42] thou mayest prosper with usoever thou
[9:44] goest. This book of the law shall not
[9:46] depart out of thy mouth. So there's
[9:48] something about it being close to him
[9:50] and thou but thou shalt meditate therein
[9:52] day and night. And I hopefully can come
[9:54] back to this before the service is over.
[9:56] There's this real rich pull that you all
[9:58] are giving this evening that sometimes
[10:00] just drives my my plow in a little bit
[10:02] deeper and I go a little bit slower and
[10:04] I'm enjoying it. But it says, "Thou
[10:05] shalt meditate therein day and night
[10:07] that thou mayest observe to do according
[10:09] to all that is written therein." if we
[10:12] don't have time to come to it that
[10:13] speaks to us that the word that we've
[10:15] received as it is in Bible form and is
[10:17] in in message form that there's things
[10:20] in it that we ought to be observing
[10:22] meditating in thinking about praying
[10:24] reading on listening to and that as we
[10:27] learn it we go oh that's something I can
[10:29] do that's something I can put into
[10:30] practice that we may meditate day and
[10:32] night so that it can be in our mouths
[10:33] day and night that we can observe to do
[10:35] it all the time all that is written
[10:37] therein for then thou shalt make thy way
[10:40] prosperous
[10:41] and then thou shalt have good success.
[10:43] We want to have good success. And the
[10:46] bookstores are full of all the different
[10:47] methods you could use to be successful.
[10:49] Whether it be in diet, whether it be in
[10:50] finance, whether it be in certain
[10:52] disciplines, if you want to be a good
[10:53] mountain climber, if you want to be a
[10:54] good uh uh runner, if you want to be
[10:56] this, you want to be that. They all have
[10:57] these theories and disciplines and ways
[10:59] that you can do it. I think that as
[11:01] Christians we can distill it down to
[11:02] this is the most important that in
[11:05] whatever I do in life if I want to have
[11:07] good success and I want to make my way
[11:08] prosperous I can then do what God wants
[11:11] me to do. And let me say this to those
[11:14] who have recreations and hobbies and
[11:16] other pursuits that you enjoy. You'll
[11:18] get a lot more out of them when you get
[11:19] your spiritual life lined up right.
[11:21] Maybe a lot of things that we think
[11:23] about that we need to exit whenever we
[11:24] start serving God correctly. And that's
[11:26] true. But you don't realize even the
[11:28] things you enjoy now, how much more
[11:30] beneficial and enjoyable they'll be when
[11:32] you can come under the right kind of
[11:33] spiritual headship.
[11:35] He doesn't want to take them all away
[11:36] from us. Sometimes he really wants us to
[11:38] learn how to enjoy them the right way
[11:40] and get the most out of it. And it's not
[11:41] going to happen until we demonstrate
[11:42] some spiritual maturity by making the
[11:44] right kind of decisions. For then thou
[11:46] shalt make thy way prosperous and then
[11:48] thou shalt have good success. What a
[11:52] beautiful thought for us to consider
[11:53] tonight. Now on Sunday, I want to recap
[11:56] this very very quickly. We did the year
[11:58] in preview and uh and we said we can
[12:01] know uh God's will for us this year.
[12:04] Brother John, I think I have a slide
[12:05] with those three. Perfect. Uh this is
[12:07] what we can do as a minimum. And we
[12:09] talked about this on Sunday. We'll
[12:10] hopefully maybe go into it in great
[12:12] detail. Um I could spend a lot of
[12:15] services just demonstrating how
[12:17] important church attendance is. I could
[12:19] use a lot of time in services on how
[12:21] important our contributions are uh in
[12:23] the eyes of God and according to the
[12:24] scripture and even on missions and I
[12:26] would like to give you some more context
[12:28] on those things but these are the three
[12:29] things that I feel very comfortable as
[12:31] your pastor telling you are God's will
[12:33] for your life this year and feel that it
[12:35] doesn't vary for any one of us here
[12:38] now a lot of people might say well does
[12:39] that mean I have to have perfect
[12:40] attendance does that mean I have to
[12:41] support this particular ministry it
[12:44] might be a lot of qu certain min uh uh
[12:46] mission program or whatever it might be
[12:47] a lot questions that are attached to it.
[12:49] But I can say that uh in the most basic
[12:52] way, God's will for you this year is to
[12:54] go to church, contribute tithes and
[12:56] offerings, and support missions. It's
[12:58] very clear in the word of God, I
[12:59] believe. And these are things uh that we
[13:01] make decisions to do, and we ought to
[13:03] make these decisions. I say at a
[13:04] minimum, this is what we can do this
[13:06] year. And from the the sermon, the
[13:08] marriage of the lamb, we read this last
[13:10] time, and I want to read it again to
[13:12] emphasize that these are things that
[13:14] don't just come easy to us. And I think
[13:16] even all of you are here tonight can say
[13:18] amen. It's not always easy making it to
[13:20] church, especially on a Wednesday night.
[13:22] And he says, you see, God cannot push us
[13:24] through a little pipe, pull us out on
[13:26] the other end, and then say, blessed is
[13:28] he that overcomemeth. You had nothing to
[13:30] overcome. He just pushed you through.
[13:32] But you've got to make decisions for
[13:34] yourself.
[13:35] It'd be great if God just had a a
[13:37] spiritual electric vehicle that just
[13:39] could we could just do the summon mode
[13:41] and it would just show up at our house,
[13:43] pick us up, just take us to church. Or
[13:45] maybe we could just take a pill in the
[13:46] afternoon and it would put us to sleep
[13:48] and somehow we're all just kind of
[13:49] transported to some kind of gathering
[13:51] place. Wouldn't it be great if we could
[13:52] just stay at home in our pajamas and
[13:54] stream it, right? Or just push play and
[13:56] obey and feel like we did gone to
[13:57] service. But there's things that God
[13:59] wants us to do and there decisions we
[14:01] make and it's not easy. He says, "But
[14:04] you've got decisions for yourself. I
[14:06] have to make decisions for myself." In
[14:07] doing that, this is the part that I love
[14:09] and kind of became the anchor for me
[14:10] that this statement was relevant to what
[14:13] we're saying. In doing that, we show our
[14:14] faith and respects to God.
[14:17] These things I believe in attending
[14:18] church and giving pay giving to the
[14:20] right things and supporting missions. It
[14:22] demonstrates that what we believe is
[14:24] important. Demonstrates what we believe.
[14:26] It demonstrates the importance of what
[14:28] we believe especially to our children
[14:30] and those that are watching us that the
[14:32] things that we attend, the things that
[14:33] we give to, the things that we support
[14:36] speak very loudly to our children and
[14:38] those watching us of what we believe in
[14:39] and what we're important. As brother
[14:41] Benamy uses the story, I think he says
[14:42] it later on about going to church and
[14:44] going somewhere. If you can just get a
[14:45] slice, go because you want to so show
[14:47] what side you're on. Or the deaf and
[14:49] blind man who went to church and he did
[14:51] it to show what side he was on. He
[14:52] wanted to show the devil what side he's
[14:53] on. These are things that we do to
[14:55] demonstrate what we believe, the
[14:57] importance of what we believe and what
[14:58] side we are on. Now, this is this is
[15:02] just maybe observations that you've made
[15:03] and you're kind of just journeying with
[15:05] me in this thought tonight. uh attend
[15:07] church, contribute tithes and offerings
[15:09] and support missions. I believe that all
[15:10] three of those are very church centric.
[15:12] They relate to church and that attending
[15:15] church and you contribute your tithes
[15:17] and offerings where you go to church and
[15:19] um I know many of you support mission
[15:20] work and you may do it outside of what
[15:22] this church supports and uh and I I
[15:25] don't I think that's wonderful that
[15:26] you're supporting missions and so but
[15:29] most people support missions through the
[15:31] mission work that the church itself
[15:32] does. And so you can say in all three of
[15:34] these may have a lot to do with Arizona
[15:35] believers church, a lot to do with this
[15:37] address, this location, the people here,
[15:39] the ministries here, and what we do
[15:41] here. And so it relates to church, but
[15:44] these really are a small part of our
[15:46] lives in terms of our overall time and
[15:48] money.
[15:50] As if you did the math, we spend less
[15:51] than I I I would say probably maybe more
[15:53] around 2%, but I could safely say that
[15:56] we spend less than 5% a week uh 5% of
[15:59] our weeks in church. And so if you just
[16:01] kind of add up the time you spend in
[16:03] church every week and if you want to
[16:04] count the time that you drive here, the
[16:05] time you spend here from song service to
[16:07] the end, less than 5% of your week is
[16:09] spent in church. And when it comes to
[16:11] giving, some of us give as much as 0%
[16:14] maybe up to around 20% of our our money.
[16:17] So when you think about it in terms of
[16:19] uh percentages, maybe 90 95% of our time
[16:22] has nothing to do with being here
[16:24] physically or supporting things here.
[16:26] maybe our finances and our income
[16:28] anywhere from 100% to maybe 80% uh goes
[16:32] elsewhere and supports other things. And
[16:34] so you'll find that attend church,
[16:36] contribute tithes and offerings and
[16:38] supporting missions uh isn't uh does not
[16:41] take up all of our life.
[16:43] You say, "Well, he told me he he told me
[16:45] what God's will was for my life, so now
[16:46] I know what I'm going to be doing
[16:47] Wednesday nights and Sunday mornings,
[16:49] and I know where x number of dollars are
[16:51] going to go, and I know how much I can
[16:52] support missions and what I can do to
[16:54] pray." But that leaves a lot more uh
[16:56] within view in terms of the rest of our
[16:58] lives. And I will say this, the I
[17:02] believe that the importance of church
[17:03] ought to never be separated from the
[17:05] rest of your life. I I I I view it
[17:08] opposite in the sense that uh if I could
[17:10] use it this way, uh that I probably have
[17:14] by nature the tendency to live to eat,
[17:19] but it's more healthy to eat to live.
[17:21] Right. Right.
[17:23] And there's a lot of people who have the
[17:24] mindset that they live to go to church,
[17:27] right?
[17:28] But it's more healthy to go to church to
[17:29] live.
[17:30] And so our whole our whole life isn't,
[17:32] oh, if we can just make it to church, we
[17:34] just make some people just make it all
[17:35] about church and all about church. And
[17:37] it's wonderful because you can get a lot
[17:38] of dedicated people. You can get a lot
[17:40] of cultist people. You get a lot of
[17:41] people who are just um cultured into
[17:43] being Christians. And so it can create
[17:45] for some really nice church dynamics,
[17:46] but there can be a little bit of 11
[17:48] mixed into it to where it's not actually
[17:50] having the benefit that it ought to have
[17:52] because they're just living to go to
[17:53] church. And church is about living.
[17:56] Amen.
[17:56] And so we go to church to live, not live
[17:58] to go to church. And so I think that we
[18:00] ought to have it in the right order and
[18:02] realize that we what we're doing here,
[18:04] what I try to lift up here, what we
[18:06] support and what we do as Christians and
[18:08] what this church stands for uh is not
[18:11] all about the church, but what about
[18:12] your life individually about your
[18:14] families, the headships of fathers
[18:15] within their homes and it's about you
[18:17] living the best kind of the right kind
[18:19] of life to manifest this message. And I
[18:22] believe that we can't separate and we
[18:24] should never discount the importance of
[18:26] this in what you do the rest of the time
[18:28] out outside of here.
[18:30] But I do believe what we're doing is to
[18:31] support that a and to support the lives
[18:34] you live outside of here. And so if we
[18:37] only spend maybe 5% of our time and I
[18:40] would say even much less than that in
[18:41] church uh a very small percentage of our
[18:44] income towards missions and towards
[18:46] tithes and offerings then it begs the
[18:48] question you know what what's the God's
[18:50] God's will for me for the rest of the
[18:51] time and so I want to ask it put it to
[18:54] you this way what is God's will for me
[18:56] this year at home
[18:59] and and and look at it from this way if
[19:01] I can give you a year in preview for
[19:02] your home life and you're like now
[19:03] you're meddling brother Aaron and Maybe
[19:06] you're right.
[19:07] But I can tell you what God's will is
[19:09] not only for us as a church, but also in
[19:11] your home life.
[19:12] And look at it as a minimum. What it
[19:14] things that God would want us to do in
[19:16] our home life this year. And and I did I
[19:20] don't have the the the clicker up here,
[19:22] brother John, if you want to just follow
[19:24] me in this. The first one is sanctify
[19:26] your home. Now, I've I've I've really
[19:29] taken some time to think of the right
[19:31] way to phrase it. Different ways we
[19:32] could have said it, different ways we
[19:33] could have listed this. different order,
[19:35] but scripturally and according to the
[19:37] message of the hour, this is God's will
[19:39] for you.
[19:41] It's to sanctify your home. You say,
[19:42] "Well, can you just give me a cleaning
[19:44] list, a to-do list or something like
[19:45] that?" Well, there could be some very
[19:47] specific things that I could say, but
[19:49] the best thing for you to do is to
[19:50] follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[19:52] in your in your life to dig into the
[19:54] word of God and find the things that you
[19:56] can do to do it. But sanctify your home
[19:58] in terms of what that means. I think a
[19:59] lot of that's going to be according to
[20:00] your desired and the choices you make.
[20:03] And the second thing is gather around
[20:04] the word. There's a lot of different
[20:06] ways I wanted to phrase this. Felt this
[20:08] just kind of summed it up was using the
[20:09] phrase lift up the word in my studies,
[20:11] but gather around the word as family.
[20:14] Gather around the word. And then the
[20:15] third thing, and I didn't even bother uh
[20:18] putting my quotes and scriptures printed
[20:19] out tonight. The third thing is live for
[20:21] others. And I say definitively, I've got
[20:24] no just as much as I feel that I can say
[20:26] thus sayith the Lord on the three things
[20:28] we shared Sunday. I can say for all of
[20:30] us, whether you're single, whether
[20:31] you're married, whether you're
[20:32] grandparents, where no matter where you
[20:33] are in life, that these are three things
[20:35] that we can say are God's will for you
[20:37] this year, sanctify your home, gather
[20:39] around the word, and live for others.
[20:42] And if you say, "Well, brother Aaron,
[20:43] you're just so general about it that you
[20:45] can't be wrong." Then I say, "Well,
[20:46] that's good because I don't want to be
[20:47] wrong. I want to be right. I want to get
[20:49] it right. I want to share with you
[20:51] things that are correct." And so these
[20:53] things here, and I I know maybe some of
[20:55] your minds are already working like
[20:57] where does this go and what does this
[20:58] mean? and already thinking about things
[21:00] you've prayed about, things you've
[21:01] thought about, and ways that this can
[21:02] manifest. But I believe that we can be
[21:04] making conscious, deliberate decisions
[21:07] about these very areas just as much as
[21:10] someone could purpose in their heart
[21:11] they're going to give to missions or the
[21:13] purpose in their heart they're going to
[21:13] be paying their ti. They could purpose
[21:15] in their heart they're going to attend
[21:16] church. We can be making conscious
[21:18] decisions in each one of these areas.
[21:20] And I believe in doing so, we can be
[21:22] fulfilling the very explicit will of God
[21:25] in our lives. I I I know that we think a
[21:28] lot of times in terms of what God's will
[21:30] is for our lives. It's who am I going to
[21:31] marry? Where am I going to go to school?
[21:33] What kind of job am I going to have?
[21:34] Should I buy this house? Am I beble to
[21:35] get this job? And there's a lot of
[21:37] questions. We wonder about God's will.
[21:39] And they're very significant,
[21:41] substantial decisions. We wouldn't want
[21:43] to minimize them at all. And those are
[21:45] the things that get all the air time
[21:46] when we talk about the will of God. But
[21:48] you realize there's things that are very
[21:49] significant and substantial that he has
[21:51] already spelled out for us. Right?
[21:53] Even when God's talking to Joshua, he
[21:55] he's saying, "Look, if you'll just do I
[21:57] know it's a lot, but he says, "If you'll
[21:59] just do all that Moses commanded, then
[22:01] you'll be successful." And you say, "Oh,
[22:02] brother, I have to do all that's in the
[22:04] word of God." Yeah, I'll say that. Yes.
[22:06] But you say, "How am I going to do
[22:07] that?" Well, let's start with the things
[22:08] we can identify first.
[22:10] Let's start with the things that seem to
[22:11] be like the basic, the fundamental, the
[22:13] foundational things. And these are
[22:15] things that we can do. And in doing so,
[22:17] fulfill the word of God in our lives.
[22:18] And I believe make our way prosperous,
[22:20] demonstrate spiritual growth, emotional
[22:22] maturity by doing these things. And we
[22:24] do face, we face so many decisions, so
[22:27] many choices, so many crises. Um there's
[22:29] people that are facing very difficult
[22:32] decisions and families moving and uh
[22:34] families experiencing loss and job
[22:36] changes and a lot of things that are
[22:37] taking place. And I think what will be
[22:40] helpful for all of us is to identify the
[22:42] constants.
[22:44] And I believe that no matter where you
[22:45] are and what job you have or whatever
[22:47] God's will would be for you in your
[22:49] specific calling in life, these are
[22:51] things that are constant.
[22:52] Amen.
[22:53] And say, "Well, God called me to be a
[22:55] lawyer. I can't live for others, right?
[22:58] You know, that that doesn't work." Not
[23:00] that I've tried it, but that doesn't
[23:02] work. You can't say, "Well, I'm single,
[23:04] so I don't have to gather around the
[23:05] word." No, it doesn't work that way.
[23:08] These are all things that no matter
[23:09] where you are and what you're doing,
[23:10] these are constants that we should have.
[23:13] Now, do we do you feel like we're we
[23:15] feel like we're all on the same page?
[23:17] I want to start with uh sanctify your
[23:19] home. Now, I I have so much I wanted to
[23:24] say in this that I felt I could just
[23:25] start almost into another series on
[23:27] this. So, if you'll uh show some
[23:30] patience and be patient with me and show
[23:33] some grace with me, I'm going to get
[23:35] into it with a little bit of detail.
[23:37] And then I might go back over it in
[23:38] greater detail later. We might repeat
[23:40] some of the same things and I don't
[23:43] think there'll be any detriment in that.
[23:45] But when I say sanctify your home,
[23:48] what's in my mind and my heart is where
[23:49] we take we take our home and we make it
[23:52] a place that's peaceful. Uh we have a
[23:55] it's a place where we're comfortable.
[23:57] Place of safety is a word that I've been
[23:58] thinking about maybe in a different term
[24:01] different way than we just think of
[24:02] physical safety, but a place of rest.
[24:04] And I draw a lot from Isaiah 32 17 and
[24:08] 18. And it says, "And the work of
[24:10] righteousness shall be peace and the
[24:12] effect of righteousness, quietness, and
[24:14] assurance forever." The song that
[24:15] brother Michael was singing there. Uh,
[24:17] righteousness is what you want from me.
[24:19] Just felt like it fits so well. Uh,
[24:21] those things that we were singing in the
[24:23] transition. But the work of
[24:25] righteousness is peace. The effect of
[24:27] righteousness, quietness, and assurance
[24:28] forever. That's that's awesome to think
[24:33] that the the effect of righteousness and
[24:35] the work of righteousness, peace,
[24:36] quietness, and assurance, those are the
[24:38] things that we desire in our lives. That
[24:39] if we if we can somehow tap into
[24:41] righteousness, lift up righteousness,
[24:43] identify righteousness, let
[24:45] righteousness have preeminence, value
[24:46] righteousness, support righteousness, uh
[24:48] pursue righteousness, that it has this
[24:51] effect of peace, quietness, and
[24:52] assurance forever. And those are the
[24:54] things I start thinking about when I
[24:55] think about home and our feelings of
[24:56] home. Regardless of what culture you
[24:58] come from, the ideas of home often
[25:00] embody this place of comfort and
[25:02] belonging and rest. And he says, "And my
[25:04] people in verse 18, he expounds upon it
[25:06] in that very well very way. And my
[25:08] people shall dwell in a peaceful
[25:09] habitation and in sure dwellings and
[25:11] quiet and in quiet resting places. It
[25:15] speaks of a habitation to say a peaceful
[25:17] hab peaceable habitation is something
[25:18] that's not alarmed or disturbed. uh
[25:21] where there's not fighting and
[25:22] struggling and always disagreement and
[25:24] everyone uh this uh everyone's kind of
[25:26] enemies and at each other's throats and
[25:28] this an unsettledness that that's not
[25:30] really a home. That's just a that's just
[25:32] a forced uh a forced gathering and
[25:34] people in the same house are always
[25:35] fighting, struggling and unable to get
[25:37] along. The Bible says we ought to have
[25:39] peaceable habitations or sure dwellings,
[25:41] something secure to be a sure dwelling.
[25:43] There's provision there. There there is
[25:45] uh there's confidence there. There's no
[25:47] worry there. It's a place you don't have
[25:49] to worry about provision. You don't have
[25:50] to worry about uh uh peace. It says in
[25:53] quiet resting places. In other words,
[25:55] it's not just a place to labor. This is
[25:58] something we could give a lot of thought
[25:59] to wherein we we homeschool and and the
[26:03] and the wives are the homeschool
[26:05] teachers and they're the the ones that
[26:07] do all the domestic duties at home. And
[26:10] really at the end of the day, that home
[26:12] is just a place where they're always
[26:13] working, always laboring. And we want to
[26:15] be able to identify a component to where
[26:17] even in those things, it becomes a
[26:18] sanctuary and a quiet resting place.
[26:21] Because I believe that in our labors, we
[26:23] can still find rest when it's under the
[26:25] right the right vision and the right
[26:27] desires, but then also create the kind
[26:29] of atmosphere at home and the things at
[26:31] home to where it's not only a place of
[26:33] labor, not only a place of vanity, but a
[26:35] place of rest. And this should be our
[26:39] goal.
[26:40] Amen. I would say to all of us here
[26:41] tonight and I would that more families
[26:43] could be here tonight and young families
[26:44] could be here tonight to hear this. But
[26:46] we should make this our goal and measure
[26:48] everything we pursue and anything we
[26:50] want to possess by it. That what I want
[26:52] in my this is the vision I have for home
[26:54] that it would be this. And then whatever
[26:56] I pursue I want to measure it by this.
[26:59] Whatever I possess I want to measure it
[27:00] by this. And if anything that I would
[27:02] pursue would take away from this I'm not
[27:04] going to pursue it. If anything that I
[27:06] would possess would take away from this
[27:07] then I'm not going to possess it. or
[27:09] find the way to pursue and possess and
[27:11] that it promotes this
[27:14] because you got to find something that's
[27:15] your ultimate something that's your
[27:16] ideal and your vision and your desire.
[27:18] We we do not want to become uh so secure
[27:22] in the sense that oh well I know that
[27:24] I'm uh I know that I'm going to make it
[27:25] to where we're we're not even being
[27:27] discerning anymore about the impact
[27:29] things have on our lives and especially
[27:31] the impact it has on our children. Some
[27:33] of us may say, "Well, I was raised this
[27:35] way and I turned out all right, so I'm
[27:37] not really worried about my kids." Well,
[27:38] you're really uh you're really playing
[27:40] loose with the grace of God. A and
[27:43] you're really you really haven't fully
[27:45] appreciated all the deficits you carry
[27:48] because of the way you were raised.
[27:49] You probably don't realize just how you
[27:52] turned out,
[27:53] right? I turned out okay, so I don't
[27:55] care if my kids smoke dope when they're
[27:57] 16, you know? Like, well, maybe you
[27:59] didn't turn out okay,
[28:02] right? There's something to be thought
[28:03] about in that way. like no I the way
[28:05] that I went I don't want my children to
[28:08] repeat and I'm very glad and I'm saying
[28:10] this for all of us not necessarily
[28:11] myself but uh we could all say I'm happy
[28:13] where we are wouldn't change a thing but
[28:15] I have the opportunity now to make it
[28:18] the way different for my children so
[28:20] that they don't wrestle with the things
[28:22] that we wrestle with internally they
[28:24] don't have the scars and the torments
[28:25] and the difficulties that sometimes uh
[28:27] boil beneath the surface there's a lot
[28:29] that we have at our opportunity that we
[28:32] have what a blessing oh it overwhelms me
[28:33] to Think of the tremendous
[28:36] responsibility. But what a great
[28:37] wonderful opportunity to make a
[28:39] difference in the lives of other people
[28:41] where maybe others didn't care enough
[28:43] and think enough about it or even know
[28:45] well enough. We do. And therefore, we
[28:47] can act accordingly to make it easier on
[28:49] these young men on these front rows and
[28:51] these young ladies on these front row
[28:52] thinking about their hearts, thinking
[28:54] about their spirits, and thinking about
[28:55] their future. Amen.
[28:58] We can measure
[29:01] measure what we do and what we desire by
[29:03] these things. I think the scriptur is a
[29:05] great measuring stick. We could say it
[29:07] this way. We should make our houses
[29:09] homes
[29:11] must be more than just a common dwelling
[29:13] place. If you took the if you took look
[29:16] at home life anymore and how people
[29:18] handle it, you'll find that it's really
[29:19] no different than a dorm. This is just
[29:21] where people who have different agendas
[29:23] and taking different classes and have
[29:24] different pursuits and different lives.
[29:25] This is just a common place they sleep
[29:27] and keep their stuff.
[29:29] That's the way a lot of houses become.
[29:31] It's just a place they sleep in a common
[29:33] arrangement. They keep their stuff and
[29:34] they share the same refrigerator and
[29:36] they and they write their name on the
[29:38] milk and the cereal and all they have
[29:39] different cupboards and it's just kind
[29:41] of it it's a convenience uh maybe given
[29:44] financial circumstances or whatever
[29:46] more. And that is not how a house should
[29:47] be. It should be a home. You'll find
[29:51] several places in the message of the
[29:52] hour where brother talks about what
[29:54] makes a home. It's the order of the
[29:55] family. It's the order of the house.
[29:57] It's the characteristic of it.
[30:00] So, it's the character. It's what you
[30:01] make of it is what makes a house a home.
[30:04] And that's what we ought to be doing. I
[30:05] think I've said this here before and I
[30:07] believe it stands for all of us that as
[30:08] men, we're homemaker. We're home
[30:10] builders. And as sisters, we're
[30:11] homemakers. And we have a duty and a
[30:14] responsibility to make a home. That goes
[30:15] for our single men, our single sisters.
[30:16] It goes to whoever it is. You have
[30:18] responsibility to take a a home, a
[30:20] house, a dwelling place, whether it be
[30:22] an apartment, it be a basement suite,
[30:24] whether it be a house, whatever it might
[30:25] be, and turn it into a home. And Joshua
[30:29] 3:5, I'm picking up on this to take
[30:31] bring into the thought of
[30:32] sanctification.
[30:37] Those were several things on a home just
[30:40] a little bit to build the idea of home.
[30:42] Now, this is uh sanctifi to sanctify
[30:46] your home. I want you to recognize what
[30:48] I I mean by this.
[30:50] Let me say this. What if God impresses
[30:53] you upon you something that sanctify
[30:55] your home means? I'm not taking away
[30:56] from that, but this is what the
[30:58] inspiration was to me. And Joshua said
[31:00] unto the people, "Sanctify yourselves
[31:02] for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders
[31:05] among you." They're going to be crossing
[31:06] over the Jordan. They're going to be
[31:07] passed over to the promised land. If you
[31:08] could just get that image in your mind
[31:09] of now they're possessing all the things
[31:12] that God told Joshua he needed to do.
[31:13] They're walking in the footsteps of the
[31:15] prophet's message. And he says,
[31:17] "Sanctify yourself." We use consecrate,
[31:19] dedicate. Now, think of this.
[31:20] Consecrate, dedicate, to keep apart, to
[31:23] separate, to be kept as sacred or
[31:26] devoted.
[31:27] And this to me, it just just blew up to
[31:30] me in terms of what sanctify the home
[31:32] means, is we often, and I'll be coming
[31:36] to it here in a moment on the the very
[31:38] specific things that we ought to we were
[31:40] reminded of that we should be doing.
[31:42] And it seems like such subtraction. Take
[31:44] away this and take away that and you
[31:46] shouldn't do this and you shouldn't do
[31:46] that. And there's a lot of no nos that
[31:48] we we think about.
[31:51] But to sanctify your house is to keep it
[31:54] apart and separate and to make it
[31:56] devoted. And so what I want you to think
[31:59] about is that your home ought to be a
[32:02] place that keeps a safe distance from
[32:04] the world.
[32:05] Amen. I mean, it's even the idea of what
[32:08] a an edifice, a dwelling place, a
[32:10] habitation was in in the very beginning
[32:12] was this idea of protection from things
[32:15] and and a place of keeping and
[32:17] separation from the elements and enemies
[32:19] and intruders and and any uh things that
[32:23] would prey upon you. And so there is
[32:25] that's the idea of the house and what
[32:28] would make it a home is a place which
[32:30] keeps a safe distance from the world.
[32:33] So, if you could think about that, that
[32:36] there's there's a there's a the devotion
[32:38] and a setting aside of the atmosphere in
[32:41] our homes that we ought to be doing that
[32:43] gives us that respite and gives our
[32:45] children, gives the husbands, gives the
[32:47] mothers, anyone who comes into that
[32:49] home, they're getting relief
[32:51] from all the things that are in the
[32:52] world. Amen.
[32:53] And this is if you could really just
[32:55] open up your hearts to uh and already
[32:57] maybe catch where the Lord is leading
[32:59] me. If he could give me very direct
[33:00] leadership in the future is uh there's a
[33:06] there's such a detriment to us working
[33:08] from home, schooling from home,
[33:10] socializing from home, everything. It it
[33:13] can all take place within our living
[33:15] rooms, our bedrooms, you name it.
[33:17] Entertainments. It used to be maybe
[33:18] you'd have to leave to go to an
[33:19] entertainment venue and everything that
[33:21] you could do out there in the world can
[33:23] now virt be done either virtually or
[33:25] literally within your home. And we lose
[33:28] something when our homes don't give us
[33:31] the distance that it should from the
[33:34] world.
[33:35] And listen, it's the devices that we
[33:37] hold in our hands. It's the screens that
[33:39] we set before us. It's a lot of the
[33:41] technology that we enjoy that make our
[33:42] lives easier that become spots or
[33:45] sources of influence and touch points
[33:47] with the world where if we took
[33:50] inventory of our daily interactions in
[33:52] our lives, we could ask ourselves, when
[33:54] am I ever getting a safe distance from
[33:56] the world?
[33:57] When when am I ever detoxing digitally?
[34:00] When am I ever not in tune to what's
[34:02] happening? When am I not being informed
[34:04] by the billions of people on Twitter,
[34:07] right? and all the comments and
[34:09] responses that we get in social media
[34:11] and we're constantly being informed by
[34:12] it. I say that's a way that home life is
[34:15] being taken away from us when we're no
[34:17] longer able to get away from the voices
[34:19] and we're constantly informed with news
[34:21] and opinions from outside sources and
[34:23] the home's not a sanctuary anymore.
[34:25] That's right.
[34:28] Can I say amen to myself and that won't
[34:30] won't bother anybody?
[34:33] That's good.
[34:36] It's just so real to me.
[34:39] I can see it in my own life. I can see
[34:40] it in my own home. I just accidentally
[34:42] showed everybody my bald spot on the
[34:44] stream. I might have to might have to
[34:46] edit that a little.
[34:48] But this is Anybody really good in video
[34:51] editing.
[34:54] You got to be really good if you're
[34:55] going to touch that up. But it's
[34:58] something to really think about in a
[34:59] real honest way about how there's no
[35:02] separation anymore. And that's what home
[35:04] should have been. That's what home
[35:05] should be. Uh there's a lot of us who
[35:07] work from home and we recognize the
[35:09] downside to that because then you never
[35:10] leave the office. It's always there.
[35:12] It's always present. It's on your phone.
[35:13] It's on your laptop. You're being
[35:14] pinged. You're being reminded. There's
[35:16] if you work if you're self-employed.
[35:18] There's one of the downsides of
[35:19] self-employment. You're never really off
[35:20] the clock. There's always demands and
[35:22] you could always you wake up in the
[35:23] middle of the night, well, I can always
[35:24] get this done. And there's always
[35:26] something pressing and there's always
[35:27] responsibilities. And the home life that
[35:31] ought to be that sanctuary. There ought
[35:34] to be something set aside about the home
[35:36] that becomes that
[35:40] and it and it's and it's a place that's
[35:42] set aside
[35:45] in in 2 Timothy chapter 2 21. And if I
[35:49] could also say this,
[35:51] it's that dynamic that the church
[35:54] mirrors
[35:57] and and therefore looks to support and
[36:00] provide all the resources necessary to
[36:02] maintain that
[36:03] Because what good would it be if we come
[36:04] here and and then on the whole way home
[36:06] you're getting anxious, right?
[36:08] Because you don't go back to another
[36:09] sanctuary.
[36:11] When we come to church, be from
[36:12] sanctuary to sanctuary.
[36:14] Or if you leave work and you come to
[36:15] church and you leave this sanctuary, you
[36:17] know, you're going to another one when
[36:18] you get home.
[36:19] That's what we ought to have as
[36:20] believers. That's what pro we're
[36:21] promised that as believers.
[36:23] So in 2 Timothy chapter 2 21, this is
[36:26] pulling it out from a much larger
[36:27] thought that I think is extraordinary
[36:29] and very very important. But he's
[36:31] talking about vessels of honor and
[36:32] vessels of dishonor. And if a man
[36:34] therefore purge himself from these, it's
[36:36] the vessels of dishonor. He shall be a
[36:38] vessel unto honor, sanctified, and I
[36:42] just love these phrases, and meat for
[36:44] the master's use, and prepared unto
[36:46] every good work. Brother Ram used
[36:48] sanctification and he uses it very
[36:51] uniquely. It's a compound word which
[36:53] means to uh to cleanse and set aside for
[36:55] service. That's what sanctify means. And
[36:57] he talks about how you find a cup, you
[36:59] find something and you clean it all up
[37:01] that's cleans cle cleansed and set aside
[37:03] for service and then there's an actually
[37:04] putting it into service. And this is to
[37:07] me a scripture that perfectly uh
[37:11] encapsulates that thought that we must
[37:13] sanctify ourselves, purge ourselves. Uh
[37:16] it's basically saying keep yourself from
[37:18] the corrupting influences of
[37:20] dishonorable vessels. Yeah,
[37:22] if you read it in a way Paul's saying
[37:23] you he that keeps himself from the
[37:25] corrupting influences of dishonorable
[37:26] vessels. So you purge yourself from
[37:28] these and are sanctified. Therefore,
[37:30] you're meat for the master's use. You're
[37:31] available. You're ready for the master.
[37:33] You're prepared. You're appropriate.
[37:34] You're complimentary to the master's
[37:36] use. Remember how he says he make Adam a
[37:38] help meat. Now you're meat for the
[37:39] master's use and prepared under every
[37:41] good work all through sanctification.
[37:44] And the word here sanctified in the New
[37:47] Testament Greek, it's to separate from
[37:48] profane things and dedicate to God to
[37:51] consecrate.
[37:53] And this is the image that is means if a
[37:55] man could be sanctified, if he could
[37:56] separate himself, if he could separate
[37:58] from pro profane things, if he can be
[38:00] dedicated to God, if he could be
[38:01] consecrated, well, I believe that our
[38:03] lives ought to be that. And then there
[38:05] I'm talking about doing our houses that
[38:07] way where we can find that it can become
[38:09] a sanctuary for God's presence and it
[38:12] can be a place that others can enter
[38:14] into and be blessed by.
[38:16] I believe that we ought to have the kind
[38:18] of atmosphere in our home that when
[38:19] people come and sit in it, they're
[38:21] blessed by it.
[38:22] They experience a difference that
[38:23] they're moved even even in their spirits
[38:26] uh to know that this is a home that's
[38:28] dedicated to God. It's set aside to God.
[38:31] And when Joshua says, "Sanctify
[38:33] yourselves." And I was really pulling a
[38:35] lot from the Exodus um in this as
[38:37] Joshua's already been told in chapter
[38:39] one to observe to do all that is written
[38:41] therein. Therefore, you're going to make
[38:42] your way successful. When Joshua tells
[38:44] him to sanctify yourselves, he sanctify
[38:46] yourself because tomorrow the Lord's
[38:48] going to do wonders among you. Notice
[38:51] that sanctification was preceding the
[38:53] miracles. And there was this this
[38:56] emphasis on sanctifying themselves and
[38:58] setting themselves apart so that they
[39:00] could participate in observe and be
[39:02] beneficiaries of the miracles and
[39:04] wonders that God was doing. And so in
[39:07] the expression to sanctify yourselves
[39:09] and reading a lot of different
[39:10] scriptures that touched on this uh there
[39:13] would be a in a ceremonial sense there'd
[39:15] be a washing of clothes and a bathing of
[39:17] the body even for the men to abstain
[39:18] from their wives. And this was in a very
[39:21] specific ceremonial sense for them to
[39:23] prepare to sanctify themselves for a
[39:26] move of God. So I'm wanting you to think
[39:28] about this that when Joshua says it, the
[39:31] people that heard it were going to have
[39:32] to make very conscious decisions about
[39:33] what they did to prepare themselves.
[39:36] And then in a spiritual sense, they
[39:38] would be praying, they'd be meditating,
[39:39] they'd be repenting, they'd be doing the
[39:41] things that they ought to do. And so as
[39:43] they prepare to cross over the Jordan,
[39:46] they have this very specific instruction
[39:48] to sanctify themselves because
[39:50] sanctification was necessary in order to
[39:52] cross over. Does not the Bible teach us
[39:54] that with holiness, no man shall see the
[39:56] Lord. And we see that sanctification is
[39:58] a step before we are filled with the h
[40:00] the Holy Ghost. And so there is this
[40:02] sanctification is a very large subject
[40:05] that I'm wanting now to take the concept
[40:06] of sanctification and see how there was
[40:09] very literal practical application of
[40:11] that sanctification to the things that
[40:13] people did in their lives.
[40:15] And as you read it and identify it in in
[40:19] Joshua chapter 3 and other places, the
[40:21] idea was to avoid any influence that
[40:25] might influence their attention away
[40:28] from the miracles.
[40:30] Sanctify yourself. Be of a sober mind.
[40:33] Do not be influenced and intoxicated,
[40:35] energized by, and too caught up in, and
[40:37] oh, you're worried too much about how uh
[40:40] this is going to turn out. You're
[40:41] worried too much about the stock market.
[40:42] You're worried too much about fantasy
[40:44] football. You're worried too much about
[40:45] this this sale that's going to be going
[40:46] on. You're worried too much about this.
[40:48] All these other things that start to
[40:49] drain on someone's mind and saying,
[40:51] "Avoid anything that might influence
[40:54] your attention away from what God is
[40:56] about to do on the tomorrow. Sanctify
[40:58] yourselves. Be ready. Be available. be
[41:00] be conscious and discerning because
[41:02] God's going to do something and don't
[41:04] let your mind be attention being drawn
[41:06] away from it. And don't be in a state of
[41:08] mind where you kill really can't enjoy
[41:09] it and participate in it
[41:12] because God's going to do great things.
[41:14] I I I'll just I'll just say this. God's
[41:16] going to do mighty miracles in our
[41:18] midst. He's going to perform the
[41:19] supernatural and he's going to manifest
[41:21] himself among us.
[41:23] And if we're not in the right place,
[41:25] none of us will see it.
[41:28] And no one can say, "Well, God ain't
[41:29] visiting there." No, we're just not.
[41:30] We're not putting ourselves in position
[41:32] to hear it.
[41:33] We're not pos putting ourselves in
[41:34] position to feel it because God is with
[41:36] us. God is amongst us. He's doing mighty
[41:38] things. He's doing miracles. And
[41:40] sometimes we just need to sanctify
[41:41] ourselves to feel to feel it a little
[41:42] bit. That's right.
[41:44] And so the principle that God identifies
[41:46] just using these few scriptures, these
[41:48] couple scriptures here
[41:50] is how easily our minds are influenced
[41:54] and and how easily our attention can be
[41:56] just turned away.
[41:58] And I believe that there must be a
[41:59] determination, there must be a
[42:01] discipline to keep the world out and the
[42:02] word first. that this is a this is a
[42:05] daily constant routine that there's
[42:08] those people who find themselves who
[42:09] have allergies to certain things and
[42:11] they're not allow allowed to eat um if
[42:13] they're not allowed to eat nuts or they
[42:15] can't have dairy and what they're always
[42:17] on guard, right? And they have people
[42:19] around them who are always on guard. I
[42:21] tried to give Micah uh some really good
[42:24] candy one time and Sister Maddie was
[42:26] like, "Wait, does that I told him to
[42:27] close his eyes. I wanted to surprise him
[42:29] because it was a really unique tasting
[42:31] uh uh chocolatecoed or lemon covered nut
[42:34] or something like that. And I was like,
[42:35] "Man, you got to try this. This is
[42:37] amazing." And and Sister M was like,
[42:39] "Does that have is that have nuts in
[42:41] it?" I'm like, "I almost killed our
[42:42] piano player." And that's what you need.
[42:45] You people are looking out over what's
[42:47] on the label, what are the ingredients,
[42:50] right? And if you have an allergy, every
[42:52] meal you're asking yourself when you go
[42:54] out to eat, you're saying, "What's it?
[42:56] What is this prepared in? Do you have a
[42:57] food allergy? Yes, I have a shellfish.
[42:59] Whatever it might be. And I think all of
[43:01] us have a selfish uh allergy, but the
[43:04] shellfish allergy maybe is a little bit
[43:05] more rare. But the and there's this is
[43:08] one of those things people who have that
[43:10] know it's life or death and they're they
[43:12] have to always be vigilant.
[43:14] And what happens when you're on a flight
[43:15] when somebody's allergic to peanuts?
[43:17] They take everybody's peanuts away.
[43:19] Like nobody can enjoy peanuts on a
[43:21] flight because of it because that's how
[43:23] serious it is. We should be the same way
[43:26] about keeping the world out in the word
[43:28] first where we have some sort of
[43:30] discernment and energy and attitude
[43:32] like, "Hey, I always want to keep my
[43:33] eyes open. I want to be sensitive. I
[43:35] want to be aware. I want to be
[43:36] recognizing influence and what can get
[43:37] in and mix things up and what can cause
[43:39] things to go a little bit sideways." We
[43:41] ought to have that.
[43:41] Yes, sir.
[43:42] We ought to have that for the benefit of
[43:43] others so that we can be the ones say,
[43:45] "Hey, wait a minute. Does that have too
[43:46] much of the world in it? Does that have
[43:47] the wrong kind of influence? Does it
[43:49] have a little bit of le I don't know
[43:50] that I don't that that's not going to
[43:52] work for my child,
[43:53] right? may work for somebody else's, but
[43:55] that's not going to work for mine
[43:56] because we're we know what works. We
[43:58] know what hurts.
[44:00] And in Joshua chapter 3, when he asked
[44:01] them to sanctify themselves, it wasn't
[44:03] much different than what God had asked
[44:04] him to do in the Exodus and the night of
[44:06] the Passover. In Exodus 12:15,
[44:10] it says, "Seven days shall you eat
[44:11] unleaven bread. Even the first day you
[44:14] shall put away leaven out of your
[44:16] houses. For whosoever eateth leaven
[44:18] bread from the first end to the seventh
[44:20] day, that soul shall be cut off from
[44:22] Israel. Now
[44:28] I know that many of you recognize this
[44:32] as the concept of what we call in the
[44:34] message applying the token. Now brother
[44:36] Bram does something very extraordinary
[44:38] when he preaches the token sermons. Um I
[44:40] think he preaches them five times and
[44:41] then desperation. It's kind of a
[44:43] companion to that and preaches it all
[44:44] over the United States and different
[44:45] places. And it's
[44:49] applying the token was to take the blood
[44:52] and put it on the doorpost and lentil.
[44:54] Right?
[44:55] That was that was the literal in our
[44:57] minds putting the blood as an outward
[44:59] sign that the lamb was being partaken of
[45:01] in the house. And as a prophet, he says
[45:04] it doesn't stop there. He uses this
[45:06] scripture, not just verse 13. He uses
[45:08] this scripture as applying the token and
[45:11] how that the act the concept of applying
[45:13] the token was in getting the leaven out.
[45:17] Now I know I realize now that I'm
[45:18] running out of time. If I just wouldn't
[45:20] have amended myself, I'd be so much
[45:22] further down the road here.
[45:24] But this is
[45:27] I want to be able to ready my thoughts
[45:28] here because there's so much that could
[45:29] be said in the the act of applying the
[45:32] token. And I can already tell some of
[45:34] you getting tense, right?
[45:36] We know where this goes whenever, and
[45:38] don't worry, I'll read the quotes. Uh,
[45:39] we already know where it goes when
[45:41] someone talks about applying the token.
[45:42] Brother Ram doesn't mince his words.
[45:44] He's very, very plain about it. But this
[45:46] is what I want to be sure is not missing
[45:48] the context,
[45:49] right?
[45:51] It wasn't it wasn't as if Moses and a
[45:54] group of guys kind of got together and
[45:55] said, "You know what? We're wanting to
[45:57] go gluten-free.
[45:59] So, it'd be easier on us if everybody
[46:01] else was gluten-free. So, we're just
[46:03] gonna tell everybody to get the the
[46:04] leaven out and and to make sure there's
[46:06] no gluten in the houses or, you know, my
[46:08] son has an allergy. If you could do your
[46:09] best not to do this. This was God saying
[46:12] it's a matter of life or death.
[46:14] And he's he's he's symbolizing something
[46:16] and he's expressing something. There's
[46:18] so much in this. And so the concept of
[46:20] applying the token is the act of
[46:23] sanctifying your home.
[46:25] Uh what literally happened in in in the
[46:28] in ex in the Exodus is the removal of
[46:30] leaven which is an influence that
[46:32] pervades the whole loaf. And this is the
[46:36] concept. I guess I'll just go ahead and
[46:37] keep continue to amplify it that the
[46:40] commandment was to not eat any leaven
[46:42] bread.
[46:42] Right? Because if anyone eats any leaven
[46:44] bread they be cut off from Israel. Right
[46:48] now, if it was you or I, we would just
[46:49] say, "I promise not to eat any leaven
[46:51] bread." And we would have leaven bread
[46:53] in the pantry. And we would just keep
[46:55] telling ourselves, "Don't do it. Don't
[46:56] do it. Don't eat it. Don't eat it." I
[46:58] don't know why this happened, but on
[47:00] Sunday, someone in the church made sure
[47:01] there was 12 donuts delivered to my
[47:03] house to see whether or not I would eat
[47:05] a dozen donuts and have enough self-will
[47:08] not to do it. And I'm a Christian. I
[47:10] didn't eat one of those donuts.
[47:12] and I was trying to give them away and
[47:14] other people at my m but I managed not
[47:15] to eat any of them but that would be our
[47:18] idea but God takes it a step further and
[47:21] he says because eating leaven something
[47:24] leaven is going to cause a curse then
[47:27] don't have any leaven in your house
[47:29] because in the absence of leaven you
[47:31] can't have a leavened bread
[47:33] right so this is actually God's wisdom
[47:36] this is God giving us some wisdom and
[47:37] some um tools to say well if you keep
[47:40] finding yourself having to deal with
[47:42] something and deal with something over
[47:44] and over again instead of just trying to
[47:45] remediate the consequences and effects
[47:47] of it. How about getting down to the
[47:49] root cause and removing the root cause
[47:52] and finding out that the blessing comes
[47:54] when the cursing leaves
[47:56] from getting rid of the underlying
[47:58] thing. And that is what's being taken
[47:59] place here is God is telling him to
[48:01] remove the influence the leavenan which
[48:04] has the ability to pervade the whole
[48:05] lump. And instead of I would want us to
[48:08] think very spiritually and if I could
[48:09] encourage you to do this tonight before
[48:11] I read these statements is be very
[48:14] mature about this
[48:17] about these prescriptions in God's word
[48:19] and not think just so legalistically
[48:22] because I think what what's happened to
[48:23] us is a lot of us we've been forcefed it
[48:25] legalistically so it has that taste
[48:27] whenever we hear it
[48:28] all right because it was given to us
[48:30] legalistically and we were told bless
[48:32] God you have a TV in your home you'll
[48:33] never be a deacon in this church right
[48:35] and we kind of always just associate
[48:37] with this legalism and legalism and it
[48:39] was never given the context that no this
[48:41] is this is not legalism. This has given
[48:44] you a little bit of wisdom to identify a
[48:46] way that you can live a better life as a
[48:48] Christian, the way that you can
[48:49] overcome, the way that you can uh
[48:50] prosper and and protect your children.
[48:52] There's a lot more to it than just
[48:54] making everybody look the part.
[48:56] And so just two statements that brother
[48:58] uses. I I went I went with these two and
[49:00] just left anything else out just to just
[49:03] to identify the usual suspects. But I
[49:05] want you to think maturely about this.
[49:06] He says, he said, "Get all the filth out
[49:08] of your house. Put every all leaven out.
[49:11] You can't have no levaven. When this
[49:13] marker come into your house, this token,
[49:15] you cannot have a leaven in it. That's
[49:17] the world."
[49:19] So there's this thought of purging your
[49:20] home from the world whenever the token
[49:23] is applied. Now, if you want to get
[49:25] legalistic, then I don't know that you
[49:27] could have a home.
[49:29] Right?
[49:30] I mean, what what is not from the tree
[49:32] of knowledge of good and evil? it is not
[49:34] have some root uh rudimentary element
[49:36] from the world. There's a lot of ways
[49:38] that we need to be think materially
[49:39] about it, think spiritually about it. So
[49:41] there is a wisdom that is able to look
[49:44] at influence and say if I'm going to
[49:47] sanctify my home, if I'm going to aside
[49:50] my home, if it's going to be a
[49:51] sanctuary, then there's certain things
[49:52] that can't be in it.
[49:53] There's certain things that ought to
[49:54] have moderation. There's certain things
[49:56] that not ought to not have the
[49:57] preeminence or be so easily accessed. So
[49:59] then in another place, I think this is a
[50:01] little bit earlier, he says this, apply
[50:03] the token to your house. That's that
[50:04] phrase that's so common to us. Apply the
[50:06] token. Apply the token. Apply the token.
[50:08] But again, I want you to think about
[50:09] apply the token is something not
[50:11] legalistic, but it's something that is
[50:13] demonstration of maturity. It's
[50:15] something done for very specific reason.
[50:16] It's done to sanctify the home, which is
[50:18] to get distance from the world.
[50:20] Apply the token to your house. Then what
[50:22] you do when you apply it to your house,
[50:24] move all the trash out. And then these
[50:27] are things that brother Bham explicitly
[50:29] identifies. But if we could think
[50:30] maturely about it, we would think about
[50:34] what he's identifying instead of just
[50:36] thinking that we could somehow create a
[50:37] laundry list and if you would just let
[50:39] me come into all your houses and get rid
[50:41] of all these things and our church will
[50:43] be sanctified. Nope.
[50:45] Right.
[50:46] Ain't going to do it.
[50:47] Haven't we learned that? I remember one
[50:49] time when we were in uh in in Texas, a
[50:52] young girl had gotten had an experience
[50:53] with the Lord and just coming really
[50:55] strong to the Lord and she was uh it was
[50:57] just happening over just a matter of
[50:59] days and and my brothers and some other
[51:00] young people like let's just go to her
[51:02] apartment and and they all went over
[51:03] there and they're dumping alcohol out
[51:05] and trashing all sorts of stuff and I
[51:07] just like man guys I'm not having one
[51:08] thing to do with this because it just
[51:10] didn't seem right to me you know and it
[51:13] was kind of like we're going to apply
[51:14] the token and it and you know it only
[51:16] lasted a few days. I think all they did
[51:17] was cause her a lot of more money on,
[51:20] you know, 9-in nail CDs and and and
[51:22] alcohol. I mean, it was just they didn't
[51:24] really do her any favors. And but you
[51:26] can't it can't be something that's
[51:27] prescribed in a well, if I can just do
[51:30] this. No, it's got to be, as brother
[51:32] Loyal put out, I'm looking for a city.
[51:33] This has got to be something real
[51:35] burning inside of me and I got a vision
[51:38] and I got a purpose and I realize these
[51:40] are things I can start identify in my
[51:42] life that I can touch on and take care
[51:43] of that's going to benefit me
[51:45] spiritually. it's going to make a
[51:46] difference for me spiritually. And so
[51:48] these are things that start maybe could
[51:50] become use it in whatever language is
[51:52] more appropriate for you today. But he
[51:54] says get all the short skirts and the
[51:56] shorts and the cards and the cigarettes
[51:58] and the televisions and whatever more
[51:59] and kick them out the door. And I say
[52:02] amen to that.
[52:03] Amen.
[52:04] And he says, "You're going to apply the
[52:07] token. Won't stand still for it." Yes,
[52:08] sir. Take it all out. All the dances and
[52:11] the parties and the rock and roll and
[52:12] old vulgar newspapers and the stuff
[52:13] that's of the world. kick it out the
[52:15] door. Say, "We're cleaning out this
[52:17] place around here."
[52:21] Now, I had some other statements to
[52:23] read. We're not going to get to them
[52:24] tonight,
[52:26] but Brother Brandham is making in in the
[52:29] the idea of gathering around the word.
[52:31] He says, um,
[52:35] he says, "Get the old beer out of the
[52:37] ice box. Take the cards off the table
[52:39] and, um, and these other things. Let me
[52:42] see what's in your office and in your
[52:43] house and I'll tell you what you are.
[52:45] And and I was going to say when we came
[52:47] to that that
[52:51] you if it if it's not beer cans in the
[52:53] ice box or cards on the table, you know
[52:55] what the the equivalent is.
[52:58] Could I say that? In in these things
[53:01] that we read here, dance parties and
[53:02] rock and roll and old vulgar newspapers
[53:04] and stuff like that, you know what the
[53:06] equivalent is? Come on.
[53:07] Let's not one not let not one man fool
[53:09] himself tonight by leaving here and say,
[53:10] "Well, I don't have one dirty magazine
[53:12] in my house."
[53:13] Well, you know there's other things that
[53:14] have no place in your house,
[53:17] right?
[53:18] And justify it because it's digital.
[53:20] I I I trust to God nobody does that. But
[53:24] don't find any kind of safety and
[53:25] antiquated language. Let the Holy Spirit
[53:28] update these things to where we are
[53:30] today.
[53:31] Because as I kind of just alluded to on
[53:34] Sunday, just kind of a way to get us
[53:35] thinking is when brother Bam told us too
[53:37] many people stay home on Wednesday
[53:38] nights and watch television
[53:40] and and and that's what they're viewing
[53:41] me on right now.
[53:42] And I wanted people just to think about
[53:44] it a little bit because it's a way that
[53:46] we update it today to say, "Hey, I need
[53:48] to use Holy Ghost discernment about how
[53:51] these things have evolved." And it's the
[53:53] same spirit presenting itself a little
[53:55] bit differently, but having the same
[53:57] impact of bondage and the same way of
[54:00] tearing down families and and corrupting
[54:02] our young people and pro providing them
[54:04] access to things that are going to
[54:06] completely tear up their minds.
[54:08] And these are things that he identifies
[54:10] that hopefully by God's grace we can
[54:12] update to today's language or we can
[54:14] find the equivalent for in our lives.
[54:16] Whatever these things allude to, whether
[54:18] it be fashion, whether it be
[54:19] entertainments, whether it be things we
[54:21] ingest, things that we view, whatever it
[54:23] is that might influence us, whatever
[54:24] that is that might enthuse us, anything
[54:27] that is of a pervasive influence that
[54:29] tends to the things of the world and
[54:31] gets us further from the word.
[54:36] And you know what standards
[54:38] I believe there's a baseline standard
[54:40] that we all can should align up line up
[54:41] with and that's the message of the hour.
[54:43] But you'll find that in life there's
[54:45] there's some people who have greater
[54:47] dietary restrictions because of what
[54:49] their body can tolerate. Or there's
[54:51] people that can suffer more because of
[54:52] what their body can endure. And there's
[54:55] some people that are going to have to
[54:56] take a much greater level of
[54:57] sanctification in their home because of
[55:00] the susceptibilities that their children
[55:02] have or the tendencies that they have
[55:04] themselves. So make no one else your
[55:06] standard and do what you know you have
[55:08] to do in your home.
[55:11] You say, "Well, brother so and so does
[55:12] it." So that means it's okay for us. I I
[55:15] don't know.
[55:18] You got to do what you know is right for
[55:19] your house, for your home.
[55:21] I'm gonna I had a lot more to share with
[55:24] you tonight and we'll just leave it for
[55:26] another time. But let me end with this
[55:29] scripture in Ephesians 4:27. Neither
[55:32] give place to the devil.
[55:34] That's what sanctifying your home is all
[55:35] about.
[55:36] Not getting giving any place to the
[55:38] devil. That I have a home that I'm
[55:40] responsible over. I have if you have at
[55:43] a home I think about some of our people
[55:46] uh our young people and there's several
[55:48] in this church that live on their own
[55:50] and that that that place where you live
[55:52] whether it be a house whether it be an
[55:54] apartment wherever it is you dwell you
[55:56] have a responsibility over that to
[55:57] sanctify that for yourself for anyone
[56:00] else who'd come and be a part of it you
[56:02] want it to be a dwelling place not only
[56:03] for yourself to where you lay your head
[56:05] where you keep your stuff but you want
[56:06] the Holy Spirit to be welcome there
[56:08] so much about what we're talking about
[56:10] is is creating an atmosphere where he's
[56:11] welcome. That's why we do the things
[56:13] that we do at church. We try to keep the
[56:15] sanctuary u a sanctified atmosphere so
[56:17] the Holy Spirit can be welcome. And this
[56:19] is a phrase that you could use if
[56:22] anybody wants to take it and put in a
[56:23] real pretty font and use a really nice
[56:25] filter and put a really nice sunset
[56:27] scene behind it and post it on
[56:29] Instagram. It's Instagrammable. Neither
[56:31] give place to the devil.
[56:34] This is so true. It should be a theme.
[56:36] It should be something we think about. I
[56:37] don't want to give the devil any room to
[56:38] work
[56:39] any occasion. I do not want to be giving
[56:42] him a place at my table. I do not want
[56:44] to be giving him an opportunity in my
[56:45] home. And you say, "Well, brother Aaron,
[56:47] then where what do we do and how far do
[56:48] we need to take it?" You know, if we
[56:50] really start to think about it and you
[56:51] start to think, "Well, if I do that,
[56:52] then I won't be able to do anything."
[56:55] Then maybe you shouldn't, right? If
[56:58] that's if that's what you start thinking
[56:59] is, well, I won't even be able to do
[57:01] anything if I do that. If I do that, I
[57:02] won't be able to have this. I won't be
[57:03] able to do this. I won't be able to
[57:03] watch this. I won't be able to watch
[57:04] that. then maybe you shouldn't
[57:06] cuz what it's telling you is you're
[57:07] letting the devil in everywhere
[57:09] and you haven't developed any bar
[57:12] boundaries to them
[57:13] and that if this is where I didn't want
[57:15] to get into it but I'll just say it
[57:16] applying the token and sanctifying your
[57:19] home is the process of identifying
[57:20] strongholds
[57:22] recognizing where where is the Satan got
[57:24] a tow hold in my home because I I feel
[57:27] like I'm doing so many other things
[57:28] right but something keeps popping its
[57:31] head up when you sanctify your home you
[57:33] find out where the imp is hiding
[57:35] you find out where the devil's been
[57:36] hiding like, whoa, who thought it would
[57:38] have been there?
[57:40] Had no idea this is the door it was
[57:41] backing through. Had no idea this is
[57:43] where it was coming through. But that's
[57:45] what happens when you start to sanctify
[57:47] your home is you begin to make your your
[57:49] habitation a dwelling place for the most
[57:51] high. And there shall no evil come nigh
[57:53] your dwelling when you do that. So you
[57:55] have to start identifying the
[57:56] strongholds.
[57:58] And this is what I'd like for you to
[57:59] leave with this inspiration is in
[58:01] sanctifying my home. I want to give no
[58:03] place to the devil. And that sanctifying
[58:06] the home or applying the token instead
[58:07] of thinking legalistically anymore,
[58:09] think it's about removing influences,
[58:12] removing stumbling blocks, and creating
[58:14] a place that gives a safe distance from
[58:16] the world.
[58:17] That's what it means.
[58:19] Next, Lord willing, next Wednesday, we
[58:21] can get talk on more on gathering around
[58:24] the word and uh living for others. But
[58:26] let's let's stand together
