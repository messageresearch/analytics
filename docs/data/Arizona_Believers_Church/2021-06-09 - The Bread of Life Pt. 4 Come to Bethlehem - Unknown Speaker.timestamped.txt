[0:01] Ruth 1: 1-5 says now it came to pass in
[0:05] the days when the judges ruled that
[0:07] there was a famine in the land and a
[0:09] certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to
[0:12] soldier in the country of Moab he and
[0:14] his wife and his two sons and the name
[0:17] of the man was IMC and the name of his
[0:19] wife Naomi and the name of his two sons
[0:21] Mahan and kilan ephes of Bethlehem Judah
[0:25] and they came to the country of Moab and
[0:27] continued there and aimc Naomi's husband
[0:31] died and she was left and her two sons
[0:34] and they took them wives of the women of
[0:35] Moab the name of the one was orpa and
[0:38] the name of the other Ruth and they
[0:40] dwelt there about 10 years Mahan and
[0:44] kilan died also both of them and the
[0:46] woman was left of her two sons and her
[0:49] husband if we could just bow our heads
[0:52] in prayer our gracious Heavenly Father
[0:54] lord it's with a heavy heart that we're
[0:56] bowing our heads before you tonight just
[0:58] thinking of our dear brother
[1:00] Lord and even the circumstances of his
[1:02] passing and how that one who is loved by
[1:06] so many and one who's touched so many's
[1:08] lives could somehow Lord as it sounds um
[1:11] pass away in a hospital with a with a
[1:14] sickness Lord that none nobody knew
[1:16] about and with no one at his side and
[1:18] Lord I don't know what the circumstances
[1:20] are that would allow that to happen and
[1:23] just exactly even how he passed away but
[1:26] Lord just having it confirmed just
[1:27] before service Lord I have a heavy heart
[1:29] for for his family for the church family
[1:32] and Lord we just pray that you'd be a
[1:34] comfort to them all that you would use
[1:37] this as only you can For Your Glory for
[1:39] the bride's benefit for his family's
[1:41] benefit Comfort his sister and the
[1:42] different ones Lord that may may they uh
[1:45] find soulless in your presence Lord for
[1:48] the Believers there at Cloverdale Bible
[1:49] way we know that they've uh as some
[1:52] other churches have been been split by a
[1:54] border being closed and restrained
[1:57] because of the circumstances of the
[1:58] pandemic Lord they've suffered
[2:00] tremendously already we just pray that
[2:02] you bring healing to them and comfort
[2:04] Lord and wisdom instruction Lord and
[2:07] father tonight as we stand in your
[2:09] presence we are looking forward to you
[2:11] sharing something in your word that
[2:12] would be a strength to us that would
[2:13] encourage us Lord we have not gathered
[2:16] here in vain there's not one person here
[2:19] who's going to confess and profess that
[2:22] they gathered in vanity that they came
[2:24] merely to be seen Lord there's not one
[2:26] here who's come to be a Critic there's
[2:28] no one here who's come traditionally
[2:30] Lord We Gather in a setting like this
[2:32] because we want to be here and so I pray
[2:34] Lord you'd speak to all of us because
[2:35] we're here to hear from you we thank you
[2:37] for the visitors that are with us this
[2:39] evening Lord for those who are traveling
[2:41] in a way we ask that you bless them and
[2:42] strengthen them and encourage them be
[2:44] with us now we pray in the name of the
[2:46] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless
[2:50] you you can be
[2:55] seated going to just jump right into our
[2:58] subject this evening as we've been
[3:00] ministering out of the Book of Ruth and
[3:02] our subject has been um the bread of
[3:05] life building from the statement where
[3:07] brother brandham says that in the
[3:09] Rapture message that the shout is the
[3:11] living bread of life bringing forth the
[3:13] bride and so that is the message so the
[3:16] the message is the living bread of life
[3:19] and that Miracle or that revelation of
[3:23] the bread of life is what brings forth
[3:24] the bride it's what her attraction is
[3:27] and how that is so important to the
[3:30] bride uh coming to her Rapture condition
[3:33] and we started looking in the Book of
[3:35] Ruth because it talks about how that
[3:37] Ruth came to Bethlehem at Harvest Time
[3:40] and we've been using the subject of Come
[3:42] to Bethlehem and brother brandham says
[3:45] about the Book of Ruth that there's a
[3:46] hidden revelation in it and when you
[3:48] catch it the real meaning it'll bring
[3:50] you close to God and he prays that God
[3:53] would reveal himself what he is in this
[3:55] story what he is to you and how to
[3:59] accept him so there's just tremendous
[4:01] truths that are in this book tremendous
[4:03] truths that are in this story and it
[4:05] begins just even with the setting in in
[4:07] verse one it begins with just even the
[4:10] names of each of the characters there's
[4:11] so much so many Rich things that are in
[4:14] this and uh I I'm wanting just to kind
[4:16] of finish up verse two tonight and
[4:19] realize I'm not even going to be able to
[4:20] finish finish what's on my heart so I
[4:22] just want to come to a particular Point
[4:24] that'll perhaps challenge us just to be
[4:26] thinking a little bit about what these
[4:28] verses mean to us and what this
[4:30] Revelation is in the Book of Ruth for us
[4:32] but we're if I could say it this way the
[4:35] Ruth as brother Ram says it has a hidden
[4:37] revelation that it holds a revelation of
[4:39] how that God deals with his people to
[4:41] bring full Redemption as a story of The
[4:44] Book of Ruth is about Redemption and a
[4:46] kinsman redeemer and about inheritance
[4:49] uh being changed or even lost and how
[4:51] that through marriage it redeemed uh the
[4:53] family of ALC and even redeemed uh Ruth
[4:56] the moabitas it holds a revelation then
[4:59] the truths that we see in it hold a
[5:01] revelation of how God redeems fully
[5:04] redeems his people and we're living in a
[5:06] time of full Redemption amen so if we're
[5:08] living in a time of full Redemption then
[5:09] we could look to a story like Ruth and
[5:11] we can begin to see types of how that
[5:13] God deals with his people and we know
[5:15] that Christ is the hidden revelation in
[5:18] the Book of Ruth and when I say that
[5:20] he's a hidden revelation there could be
[5:21] a lot of Scholars and theologians say
[5:23] that's not hidden everybody knows that
[5:25] Christ that Boaz is a type of the
[5:27] kinsman redeemer that Boaz is a type of
[5:29] Christ but we realize that a lot of
[5:31] people believe in the Christ of the
[5:33] Bible but Christ is hidden from them
[5:36] that Christ is restrained by tradition
[5:37] and false interpretation and so we want
[5:40] to see Christ as he is in the word of
[5:42] God and not just pay lip service to
[5:44] something that we believe because
[5:46] someone told us and not only is Christ
[5:49] the hidden revelation of the Book of
[5:51] Ruth but his bride is also part of that
[5:53] mystery just doesn't reveal Christ but
[5:56] it also Reveals His Bride and we see
[5:57] this played out in typed out in the Book
[6:00] of Ruth and Ruth being a a a moabit or a
[6:03] gentile now where I want to pick up is
[6:06] on uh something we've been identifying
[6:09] for through the first few Services how
[6:10] that IMC and his family are portraying
[6:13] Israel and the Disobedience of Israel in
[6:15] departing from the promised land and
[6:17] it's real key to catch that how that as
[6:19] as as they depart from the promised land
[6:22] and we'll use some more scriptures later
[6:24] to show this how that the Israel was
[6:27] blinded for whose sake for our sake had
[6:30] Israel not been blinded then the
[6:32] Gentiles would not not come in and God
[6:34] had ordained it that way because really
[6:36] you are the mystery of God the fact that
[6:37] he would have a gentile bride that was
[6:40] hidden in the Old Testament prophesied
[6:41] in the Old Testament so there Israel's
[6:43] Fallen away made way for the bride the
[6:46] Gentiles to be brought in as heirs to
[6:47] the Covenant and so just as you see IMC
[6:50] and his family falling away it's their
[6:52] Disobedience but what does It Make Way
[6:53] for Ruth to come into the promise and be
[6:56] part of the lineage of Christ so we see
[6:57] that parallel through it but I want you
[6:59] you to remember how that IMC and and by
[7:02] virtue of his wife following him his
[7:04] sons going out with him they are
[7:06] foreshadowing and acting out Israel's
[7:08] Disobedience because God brought the
[7:10] famine in Israel because of their
[7:12] Disobedience God had said if you don't
[7:14] obey me then there's going to be famine
[7:16] that comes in the land if you don't do
[7:17] what I ask you to do then you're going
[7:19] to be suffer suffering Natural Things
[7:21] I'll withhold the blessings of the
[7:22] ground and so as God is judging Israel
[7:25] by famine IMC instead of seeking God and
[7:28] repenting he runs I want you to ponder
[7:31] that how that what he did instead of
[7:33] staying in the Promised Land staying
[7:35] where he was supposed to do in atoning
[7:37] for and making right what he could he
[7:38] actually leaves the promised land and
[7:41] brother Brandon makes this statement
[7:42] we've read part of this before but we're
[7:44] going to read a little bit further down
[7:45] and brother Brown opens up some more
[7:47] details to this he says Redemption
[7:50] beautiful story of redemption I believe
[7:52] for the next few moments let's view
[7:53] something a beautiful story comes into
[7:55] my mind a book that's shorten the Bible
[7:58] and gives out the very very lines of
[8:01] redemption remember that the very lines
[8:03] of redemption and that's the Book of
[8:04] Ruth so the Book of Ruth gives out the
[8:06] lines of redemption it is the screenplay
[8:09] it is the script it is the book that
[8:11] tells you the boundaries and the
[8:13] storyline and the theme of redemption
[8:15] many people just pass over that book but
[8:17] it's the most beautiful story of the
[8:19] Lord Jesus almost almost of the Old
[8:21] Testament and then he adds this and this
[8:24] is where we left off before during the
[8:26] time of the judges when the first thing
[8:28] there come a time when Israel got away
[8:30] from God and when they did the water
[8:33] supply Supply was withheld and when
[8:36] people get away from God today the water
[8:38] supply is withheld all other blessings
[8:40] will be
[8:42] withheld so God is brother bam is
[8:44] connecting something that is within our
[8:46] power within our control many times that
[8:48] we ought to be doing something we ought
[8:50] to be acting we ought to be heeding the
[8:52] voice of God doing what he asked us to
[8:54] do stop doing what he told us not to do
[8:56] and by virtue of not doing what we know
[8:58] is the right thing that's how blessings
[9:00] are withheld and so he's pointing out
[9:03] that in the time of Judges when this
[9:04] famine Came Upon the land of Israel and
[9:07] how there was a famine in Bethlehem
[9:08] Judah it was not because of poor farming
[9:11] tactics on imc's part it wasn't just
[9:14] because it was just a uh the Farmers
[9:16] Almanac called for it that year but it
[9:18] was a direct result of Israel getting
[9:20] away from God and when Israel got away
[9:23] from God the droughts came and the and
[9:25] the droughts coming the plants would not
[9:27] grow the wheat would not grow the corn
[9:28] would not grow so he's saying they got
[9:30] people got away from God and the water
[9:33] supply is withheld he says when we get
[9:35] away from God what happens our blessings
[9:37] are withheld now in two other places he
[9:40] makes this point he says in the Book of
[9:42] Ruth it's a very beautiful picture how
[9:44] that Boaz the type of Christ how that
[9:47] Naomi went over in a strange country as
[9:49] a backsliding went out of the land and
[9:52] brought back with her Ruth and when Ruth
[9:55] came back she was out of the country of
[9:57] Moab and when she came back she was a
[9:59] moit absolutely a picture of the Gentile
[10:02] Bride of the church so he's identifying
[10:05] how that Ruth is a type of the Gentile
[10:07] bride so we identify with Ruth from that
[10:10] vantage point and he's saying that as
[10:12] they backslid in as they went into uh
[10:15] the land of Moab Ruth comes back with
[10:18] Naomi as a type of the Gentile bride but
[10:21] notice he identifies the journey into
[10:24] Moab as
[10:25] backsliding he says they went out of the
[10:27] land so they had been given a Promised
[10:28] Land they had been given borders that
[10:30] they ought to stayed in and God's
[10:32] judgment within that land was not the
[10:34] release that they needed to go back to
[10:37] what they had been called out of just
[10:39] because there was a famine in the land
[10:40] it didn't exempt God's promise of
[10:42] blessing it didn't exempt it didn't take
[10:44] away God's promise to care it was only a
[10:46] sign post to them that something's not
[10:48] right repent and make things right but
[10:50] instead as we mentioned before IMC
[10:52] instead of repenting Ran So notice how
[10:56] he identifies it as a backsliding
[10:59] then the message God has a way provided
[11:01] he says in the Book of Ruth many of you
[11:02] run over the top of that not thinking
[11:05] what it is that's one of the most
[11:07] greatest stories in there of a type of
[11:09] Christ in all the Old Testament the
[11:11] first chapter of the Book of Ruth he
[11:13] says the word Naomi means Pleasant so
[11:17] this is one of the greatest stories in
[11:18] the old Old Testament now he's even
[11:20] looking at the names as we have of what
[11:23] these characters mean he says the name
[11:25] Naomi means Pleasant she her husband and
[11:28] her two Sons left Palestine a type of
[11:31] the church so he's identifying how you
[11:35] can even see now the type of the church
[11:37] not just Israel but a type of the church
[11:39] and they left Palestine went over in the
[11:41] land of Moab and there they homesteaded
[11:44] out of the Homeland this is the problem
[11:46] they left the Homeland they left where
[11:48] they were called to be they went into
[11:50] Moab he says that's a symbol of
[11:51] backsliding like Israel did so when we
[11:55] see immc leave with his wife and two
[11:57] sons out of Bethlehem Judah it's a
[11:59] symbol of backsliding and you say oh but
[12:02] Ruth came out of it that just goes to
[12:04] show how God uses all things to work
[12:06] together for the good and doesn't excuse
[12:08] or Justify our backsliding but we look
[12:11] at this the act of IMC leaving with his
[12:13] family into Moab he says as a symbol of
[12:15] backsliding like Israel did any Jew that
[12:18] left Palestine was out of the will of
[12:20] the Lord and there's still a very rich
[12:23] uh tradition amongst the the rabic
[12:25] teachings and in Israel and a certain uh
[12:28] laws that they hold that says that you
[12:30] cannot be blessed outside of the
[12:31] promised land and that an Israelite
[12:33] should not be dwelling outside of the
[12:35] promised land and so the Jews that left
[12:38] Palestine were out of the will of God
[12:39] God gave Palestine to the Jews and said
[12:43] remain there this is what God Said God
[12:46] said this is your land you've entered
[12:47] into it I'll drive out the enemies from
[12:49] before you as long as you serve me and
[12:51] do that which is right in my sight I
[12:53] will protect you and I will guard you
[12:55] but if you start doing wrong expect
[12:56] these things to happen so the answer
[12:58] when things bad start happening was not
[13:00] to leave the promised land but do a
[13:02] little self-examination say well why are
[13:04] these things happening what's taking
[13:05] place let's call upon god let's get our
[13:07] lives right let's steady the ship let's
[13:09] let's repent instead of repenting this
[13:12] is a sign of backsliding not only had is
[13:14] Israel backslide but now IMC runs from
[13:17] God and it's a sign of this stubbornness
[13:19] and refusing to Humble
[13:21] himself in Jeremiah chapter 3:
[13:25] 19-22 today I was reading many different
[13:27] scriptures that refer to backslid in so
[13:30] that we can kind of kind of catch the
[13:31] context of what it means to backslide is
[13:34] this uh bo IMC leaving Mo leaving to
[13:37] Moab is a sign of backsliding in
[13:40] Jeremiah 3:1 19-22 it says but I said
[13:43] this is God speaking how shall I put
[13:44] thee among the children and give thee a
[13:47] pleasant land and a goodly Heritage of
[13:48] the host of Nations and this is exactly
[13:51] what Israel was it was a pleasant land
[13:54] how how am I going to do this how am I
[13:55] going to bless the especially at this
[13:57] time in light of their disobedience he
[13:59] says and I said Thou shalt call me my
[14:02] father and shalt not turn away from me
[14:04] it's even speaking of a of an adoption
[14:07] surely as a wife treacherously departed
[14:09] from her husband so have you dealt
[14:11] treacherously with me oh House of Israel
[14:12] sayith the Lord a voice was heard upon
[14:15] the high places weeping in supplications
[14:17] of the children of Israel for they have
[14:19] perverted their way and they have
[14:21] forgotten the Lord their God return ye
[14:24] backsliding children backsliding seems
[14:27] to be a peculiar phrase and I guess
[14:29] maybe we hear it a lot of times in
[14:30] different context but it's a scriptural
[14:32] word he calls them backsliding children
[14:34] even as a wife deals treacherously with
[14:36] her husband calls them backsliding
[14:38] children and I will heal your
[14:39] backsliding if you return says behold we
[14:43] come unto thee for thou art the Lord Our
[14:45] God so in this even these scriptures we
[14:48] can see how that Israel the land was a
[14:51] pleasant land they were to be given a
[14:53] goodly place among all other nations and
[14:56] they were to be given an honor and a
[14:57] Heritage of the host of Nations and they
[15:00] are to turn to God those who had turned
[15:02] away and he says ye backsliding children
[15:05] so that I can heal your backsliding in
[15:07] backsliding means to turn away that's
[15:10] what it means to to to backslide it's a
[15:12] turning back it speaks of apostasy where
[15:14] there's an abandonment of Truth now we
[15:17] could we could use this to refer to
[15:20] anyone who would reject full out reject
[15:22] truth and say one time I believed in
[15:23] this but now I rejected one time I used
[15:25] to believe in this uh but now I don't
[15:27] believe it anymore we say Well that's a
[15:29] that's a backliner someone leaves
[15:30] Christianity someone rejects the message
[15:32] of the hour and they used to believe it
[15:34] and they used to go to church or maybe
[15:36] there's no clear rejection of the word
[15:37] of God but they're serving God and then
[15:39] they go back out in the world and we say
[15:40] they're backslid but it's important for
[15:43] all of us to understand that if if if
[15:45] it's merely turning away or some letting
[15:48] go of Truth or abandonment of Truth it
[15:50] it even speaks of losing a fervency and
[15:53] a passion for something that used to
[15:55] ardly believe in and and God that's his
[15:59] rebuke even of the Le Deans is you're
[16:01] not hot nor cold you're just kind of
[16:03] lukewarm that was a backsliding
[16:04] condition it doesn't have to be a total
[16:07] repudiation of Truth it can just be
[16:09] getting numb where you are just going
[16:10] along with the flow just resigning that
[16:12] this is just the way things are just
[16:14] going through the motions and that's a
[16:16] backsliding so it doesn't have to be
[16:18] going into the world it doesn't have to
[16:20] be rejecting Truth uh uh you know
[16:22] overtly and letting everyone know that I
[16:24] hate the truth I don't believe in God
[16:25] there's nothing to Jesus Christ it can
[16:27] just be a turning away and a removing
[16:29] from where you once were or some letting
[16:32] go of Truth and we could we could even
[16:35] say it in this this way that for a
[16:38] Believer we backslide when we fail to go
[16:40] forward we ought to be advancing so just
[16:42] staying in the same place is in that way
[16:45] uh kind of going against the momentum of
[16:47] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wants to
[16:49] go forward the light is always moving
[16:50] forward truth is always advancing and
[16:52] always going forward so we must continue
[16:55] to walk in truth so that we don't come
[16:57] into this complacent
[16:59] condition just a numbness and L fair and
[17:02] anything goes and it doesn't really
[17:04] matter we got to stay fervent and
[17:05] passionate otherwise that's a
[17:08] backsliding in 1 John 1:7 it says but if
[17:11] we walk in the light as he is in the
[17:14] light we have Fellowship one with
[17:16] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[17:18] his son cleanseth us from all sin so in
[17:22] order to be in Fellowship one with
[17:24] another in order to be in that cleansing
[17:27] flood of the blood of Jesus Christ being
[17:29] purged of all iniquity being washed
[17:31] growing and maturing properly in the
[17:34] things of God we must walk in the
[17:37] light and and that should create the
[17:39] image of advancement that there's some
[17:40] sort of moving there's some sort of
[17:42] progress that and it also should
[17:44] understand that the light continues to
[17:45] move the light is going on the light is
[17:48] advancing so we must walk in that light
[17:50] to stop or to stand still and to fail to
[17:53] go forward in the light can be a
[17:56] backsliding and so brother brandham
[17:58] identif ifies that IMC and his family
[18:01] were backsliding when they left
[18:02] Bethlehem Judah to go into Moab and so
[18:05] IMC just kind of catch this image he was
[18:08] rebelling against God's correction
[18:10] instead of relenting to it if if he had
[18:14] been stubborn at all if he had been well
[18:16] this is the way we ought to do things
[18:17] and God's already abandoned us and I'm
[18:18] sick and tired of this happening I'm
[18:20] sick and tired of that happening instead
[18:21] of letting go of his own ideas and his
[18:23] own pride and just giving in the dealing
[18:25] of God instead of repenting he becomes
[18:28] more OB subate inv vacates the land that
[18:31] God gave him he ought to have looked at
[18:34] those fields he ought to looked at
[18:35] Bethlehem Judah and said God gave this
[18:36] to me God drove out my enemies from
[18:39] before me this is an inheritance of God
[18:41] this land right here is to me the word
[18:44] made flesh this is the word tangible
[18:47] this is a promise of God that has been
[18:49] materialized God gave our Father Abraham
[18:51] This Promise he said that we would go
[18:53] soldier in a Strange Land but then he
[18:54] would bring us out he was standing on
[18:57] the evidence of De
[18:59] he was standing on the Vindication of
[19:01] God's promise to Israel he was standing
[19:03] and living in a place that spoke of
[19:05] God's goodness towards Israel he should
[19:07] have said no matter how bad things are
[19:09] if this is God's judgment he ought to
[19:10] give an end to God's correction say Lord
[19:12] forgive me I'm sorry I'm wrong he should
[19:15] have relented and repented and then God
[19:17] could have brought back Health to the
[19:19] land but instead he abandons this
[19:21] precious
[19:22] land and we can see that this was
[19:24] Rebellion on imc's part not only in the
[19:28] way that it's characterized by brother
[19:30] brandham but also again into what
[19:33] unfolds later here's in Ruth chapter 1
[19:36] verse4 as we read it it speaks of one of
[19:38] the two sons it says and they took or
[19:40] both the sons and they took them wives
[19:42] of the women of Moab the name of the one
[19:45] was
[19:46] orpa and orpa comes from the Hebrew word
[19:50] stiff neck or obstinate you better ask
[19:54] what your wife the girl you like ask her
[19:55] what her name means first so I've never
[19:57] heard that before does that mean but
[20:00] this name it it speaks of being stiff
[20:02] necked or obstinate or rebellious to be
[20:04] stubborn this is the very meaning that
[20:06] is given even if it would be after the
[20:09] fact because uh when they would give
[20:11] names uh traditionally and in ancient
[20:14] times they would ascribe some meaning to
[20:16] the name and we know there's a meaning
[20:18] behind the name we're taught to be
[20:19] prayerful about what we would name our
[20:21] children and this orp is derived from
[20:23] being stiff neck something stubborn or
[20:25] obstinate and it's reflected now what uh
[20:28] Rebellion is been reflected
[20:31] immc because now his son is taking a
[20:33] woman as a sign now that the act of them
[20:36] leaving uh Bethlehem Judah was not just
[20:39] a man looking to provide for his family
[20:41] it wasn't merely an act of desperation
[20:43] because times were bad but it was an act
[20:45] of rebellion against God so a son takes
[20:48] a woman a moabit to wife and her name
[20:50] means stiff neck speaking of his own
[20:52] stubbornness of his father and
[20:55] Rebellion notice what the scripture says
[20:57] about being stiff neck there's a lot
[20:59] that I could have read in this regards
[21:00] too in 2 Chronicles 30:8 now be you not
[21:04] stiff necked as your fathers were but
[21:07] yield yourselves unto the Lord to be
[21:10] stiff neck you resist God God's dealing
[21:13] with you it's kind of like that I when
[21:15] you when you're going to punish somebody
[21:17] and they're say well that didn't hurt or
[21:18] you yeah that's fine do that you could
[21:19] do whatever you want it's more obstinate
[21:21] and stiff necked and this isn't going to
[21:23] hurt that's not going to bother me
[21:24] there's nothing you can do to sway me
[21:26] and he says now be not stiff NE as your
[21:29] fathers but yield yourselves unto the
[21:31] Lord they were resisting God they were
[21:34] resisting his dealings instead of
[21:35] becoming more repentant and more
[21:37] contrite they got more stubborn more
[21:39] opposite to the point to where they
[21:40] leave and they abandon the promise then
[21:42] but the Bible says be not stiff neck as
[21:44] your father but yield un the Lord and
[21:46] enter into his Sanctuary this is the
[21:49] opposite of what IMC does which he has
[21:51] Sanctified forever and serve the Lord
[21:53] your God that the fierceness of his
[21:55] wrath may turn away from
[21:57] you when one of the sons of IMC took
[22:01] orpa to wife it was a sign of being
[22:05] obstinate it signified the rebellion and
[22:07] the stubbornness of how this family was
[22:09] not willing to yield themselves unto the
[22:12] Lord and in the face of his wrath and
[22:14] his fierceness that he was judging them
[22:16] said God we're sorry align us back up
[22:19] with your word we'll do those things
[22:20] which are right in your sight this is a
[22:22] sign of them further
[22:24] rebelling now let me just
[22:29] point out some things very quickly as we
[22:30] come to the part that I'm wanting to
[22:33] amplify this evening so we've looked at
[22:36] how these different aspects how it was
[22:38] in the time when the judges rule it's
[22:40] famine that causes on the surface what
[22:42] causes IMC to go from Bethlehem Judah
[22:45] and de Moab and last time we were going
[22:48] through verse two the name of the man
[22:49] was ALC and the name of his wife Naomi
[22:52] ALC means my God my king what did it
[22:54] foreshadow that Israel was going to
[22:56] reject God as their King and want to
[22:57] take to the eles an Earthly King and
[23:00] then here's Naomi who means pleasantness
[23:02] but she's going to come back bitter the
[23:04] name of his two sons Mahan and kilion
[23:07] which means uh sickness and wasting
[23:09] completely wasted and pining and
[23:11] consumption to be consumed and so even
[23:13] their sons are carrying these names
[23:15] ephes of Bethlehem Judah and how this
[23:19] identified this place that had special
[23:22] significance in the history of the
[23:24] children of Israel that right here was
[23:26] born a child that was called to the
[23:27] mother the son of sorrow but to the
[23:30] father he was to be the man of my right
[23:32] hand and how Christ was signified and
[23:35] foreshadowed in this birth to Rachel
[23:37] thousands of years hundreds of years
[23:39] before the birth of Christ who was born
[23:41] right there in that same area right
[23:43] there in that same time we were looking
[23:45] at each one of these meanings and these
[23:47] phrases and where we stopped was at this
[23:49] part and they came into the country of
[23:52] Moab and continued there now I've been
[23:55] studying on
[23:57] Moab and The more I've studied more I
[23:59] thought well I mean this could be one of
[24:00] those places you get lost and uh and
[24:05] well they clearly were lost when they
[24:07] got there but this is as you study you
[24:09] can get lost in the subject of Moab oh
[24:11] my goodness there's so much here there's
[24:12] so much here and so I am Imp purposing
[24:15] in my heart to be briefer than before
[24:18] and if that seems somewhat ambiguous
[24:20] then maybe that was
[24:22] intentional uh but to not be labored
[24:25] this point because to take it another
[24:27] step further than this would almost take
[24:29] us too far into this to I really want us
[24:31] to ponder the full weight of what was
[24:33] taking place place when they left
[24:35] Bethlehem Judah so think of this in your
[24:38] in your hearts tonight where did they
[24:40] leave when ALC Naomi Mahan and kilon
[24:44] left Bethlehem Judah what were they
[24:46] leaving so it's not just the city all
[24:48] Bethlehem but what they were leaving as
[24:50] we really think about break it down and
[24:52] disal it down to ultimately what was it
[24:54] they left they left God's
[24:56] promise this was the Promised Land but
[24:59] not just a land it was the
[25:01] materialization of the promised word all
[25:04] the prophecies that have been expressed
[25:06] are now materialized before them they're
[25:08] fulfilling the prophecy they're where
[25:10] the promised land was to be this is the
[25:12] ultimate place for them to be gathered
[25:14] together the rest would be now them
[25:16] perfecting their borders in possessing
[25:19] every inch they they weren't the promise
[25:22] to them was not well we got another we
[25:23] want to conquer this region and we need
[25:25] to build an Empire God had made it very
[25:27] simple I'm going to give you this land
[25:28] and this is going to be your land this
[25:29] is going to be your
[25:31] territory and so and it wasn't again I
[25:33] want to identify it just wasn't merely
[25:35] the land the land spoke to the greater
[25:37] promise that God said I will be your
[25:39] protector I'll be your provider I will
[25:42] be your pleasure so when they leave
[25:43] Bethlehem Judah they're not just leaving
[25:46] a place that had been afflicted by
[25:48] famine but they were leaving God's
[25:49] promise word they were leaving where God
[25:52] said I will be your provider they were
[25:53] leaving where God said I will be your
[25:55] protector they were leaving where the
[25:57] word of God ought to give them and
[25:58] provided for them everything that they
[26:00] would have need of this is the thing
[26:03] that they're leaving and as they're
[26:05] leaving remember this is not an
[26:07] exodus this is not the children of
[26:10] Israel leaving Egypt this is not uh uh
[26:13] this is not a fulfillment of children
[26:15] being in bondage in Babylon and coming
[26:17] back to the temple we're working in
[26:19] Reverse of what the Exodus was God
[26:21] brought them out of Egypt brought them
[26:23] across the Red Sea and brought them
[26:25] through the land of Moab and caused them
[26:27] to cross the Jordan River and entered
[26:29] the promised land but now they're going
[26:31] to the other side of the Jordan River
[26:33] this is not an exodus we cannot think of
[26:36] what a Lim's doing is
[26:38] progress just because he was moving and
[26:40] going to another place and seeking
[26:42] something out that this is progress but
[26:44] the the the the the place of his journey
[26:47] where he was journeying to is what
[26:49] reveals just what a backsliding this was
[26:53] he doesn't seek another place in Israel
[26:56] you could even uh you could even
[26:58] considered that the fact that it says
[26:59] there was famine in the days when the uh
[27:02] the judges rulle that there was famine
[27:04] in the land and that only it tells us
[27:06] the story of a man leaving Bethlehem
[27:08] Judah that maybe it was more specific in
[27:10] Regional that this great place that was
[27:13] known for its abundance of crops and
[27:14] Good Earth and a place that was very
[27:16] verdant and had Abundant Life is is
[27:18] suffering they don't go to any other
[27:20] place in Israel was there no other
[27:21] family was there no other provision was
[27:23] there's not some place where they could
[27:24] take soless and comfort and other
[27:27] believers but no they leave and they go
[27:28] to Moab going to Moab was the biggest
[27:31] signal to us that what they were doing
[27:32] was not progress or following the
[27:34] leadership of the Lord where did they go
[27:37] Moab they leave God's promise and go to
[27:40] Moab and remember why did they
[27:43] leave we could break it down this way
[27:45] they left because of the abundance in
[27:48] Moab yes there was a famine in Israel
[27:51] but it was the abundance in Moab it was
[27:53] something about Moab that was drawing
[27:54] them to it and if we were to take it and
[27:57] say well was a man who was who had a job
[27:59] and things got really tough and he's
[28:02] there was no no really work to be had
[28:04] and this was tight and money was getting
[28:06] really really tight the economy in his
[28:07] area was uh tearing down so he took his
[28:10] family and left and moved and went to
[28:12] this other area where the economy was
[28:13] booming and the numbers were up and
[28:15] everything was seemed to go great and he
[28:16] moved there to get a job and to provide
[28:18] for his family and that's exactly what
[28:20] immc was doing and we can say that even
[28:23] today in our terms that from a worldly
[28:25] view this move would be understood oh
[28:27] you're economy was going tank and the
[28:29] market was horrible there where you were
[28:31] there were no jobs where you were and uh
[28:33] and that's why that's why you moved to
[28:35] this place where there was more jobs and
[28:37] more economic opportunities more upward
[28:39] Mobility a better job opportunity from a
[28:41] worldly perspective they would
[28:43] understand it uh they would encourage it
[28:46] they would applaud it man said yeah I
[28:49] moved and I moved to this state and I
[28:50] moved here to get a better job or I took
[28:52] this position because had a had better a
[28:55] better benefits package we would the
[28:56] world would look at at that they would
[28:58] applaud it they would say that's the way
[28:59] to do it you ought to be looking out
[29:00] after yourself that was great but from a
[29:02] word
[29:03] view I want you just to ponder this us
[29:06] as individuals tonight I said well
[29:08] brother Aaron I really wanted you to
[29:09] preach on the open of the seventh seal
[29:11] and how that's going to give us Rapture
[29:12] and condition well this is part of it
[29:15] this is absolutely part of don't think
[29:16] you can just live lasciviously and be
[29:18] claiming to walk in in the light of the
[29:20] seventh seal don't think that you could
[29:22] be forsaking the word of God and the
[29:24] things that the word teaches and you're
[29:26] grasping and getting hold of the of this
[29:28] message no it's an
[29:30] impossibility but from a word view they
[29:32] were forsaking the spiritual benefits
[29:34] made available to them in the promised
[29:36] land from a worldly view they're they're
[29:39] leaving and he's going to get a better
[29:41] job from a worldly view he's accepting a
[29:44] position with greater benefits from a
[29:46] worldly view he's taking care of his
[29:47] future from a worldly view he's taking
[29:49] care of his family from a worldly view
[29:51] he's making the necessary decisions to
[29:53] be sure that he is getting the assets
[29:56] that are required to build wealth and to
[29:58] take care of his family and preserve his
[29:59] future but from a word view he's
[30:02] actually forsaken the things that mean
[30:04] the most we ought to be able to relate
[30:06] to him from a spiritual standpoint that
[30:08] the advantages that were afforded to him
[30:10] from a spiritual standpoint that is what
[30:13] he's forsaking yeah there might be
[30:15] better crops in Moab there might be
[30:16] better things in Moab there might be
[30:18] more opportunities and a better job and
[30:20] better retirement Moab but what about
[30:22] everything you're leaving in Israel is
[30:25] this not where God promised to bless you
[30:26] is this not where your inheritance is is
[30:28] this not where the inheritance there's a
[30:30] law that protects your children is this
[30:31] not where your inheritance is protected
[30:33] by leaving this and abandoning this how
[30:35] have you preserve for your children
[30:37] there's a better promise in Israel and I
[30:40] believe that all of us ought to
[30:41] challenge ourselves when we go to make
[30:42] decisions and ask am I make the decision
[30:45] I'm making yeah it makes a lot of sense
[30:46] from a worldly standpoint but does it
[30:48] make sense from a word standpoint are
[30:51] you willing to forsake spiritual
[30:53] benefits and spiritual privileges and
[30:54] spiritual advantages for the sake of a
[30:57] worldly advantage
[30:59] it's what aimc did and I think it's too
[31:02] easy to evaluate the upside of a
[31:05] decision based upon the natural
[31:07] things very easy to look at a decision
[31:09] and say well if I do this I can get more
[31:11] money if I do this I can I have more
[31:13] vacation if I do this and we start
[31:15] looking at things we evaluate it from a
[31:16] natural standpoint it's very easy to
[31:18] kind of run the numbers and say well
[31:19] this looks like it's a better
[31:20] opportunity but let me say that the
[31:22] believer has a different entry in their
[31:24] balance sheet and and that holds a
[31:27] greater value then and bonuses and paid
[31:29] time off and health benefits and we can
[31:32] look at the things of God and say I
[31:33] cannot make this decision to flee into
[31:36] another place that does not have
[31:39] provision for me spiritually like the
[31:41] place I'm
[31:42] in and a lot of people are willing to
[31:44] stay in a place because of the natural
[31:46] advantages completely disregarding all
[31:48] the spiritual chaos that's taking place
[31:50] around them right because they're not
[31:53] they're making the same decision aimc
[31:55] did in that they're being inactive
[31:57] looking at all the natural upsides
[31:59] instead of looking at the spiritual side
[32:01] ALC looked at the natural advantages of
[32:02] Moab but didn't consider the downside
[32:05] spiritually to leave the promised land
[32:08] we have to be very very careful when we
[32:11] evaluate decisions and opportunities and
[32:13] we ought to consider the gain or loss as
[32:15] it relates to the things that matter the
[32:17] most Paul said but what things are gain
[32:20] to me those I counted loss for Christ
[32:24] there's things that to the Natural man
[32:25] are gain and to the world is loss but in
[32:28] book the loss values
[32:30] greater like the the things are oh
[32:32] you're going to be rejected what for
[32:33] what sake Christ well that means more
[32:36] well if you do this you're not going to
[32:37] have that but what am I what am I going
[32:38] to have Christ well that means
[32:42] more we got to consider those things
[32:44] ought to ought to consider these the
[32:47] spiritual benefits that were Forsaken
[32:50] and this is what immc did not
[32:53] do so this land they
[32:56] left God's promise
[32:59] promas and they go to Moab because of
[33:02] the economics the natural things and
[33:07] look at Numbers chapter
[33:10] 24 and this will kind of open the door a
[33:13] little bit if you want to take time to
[33:14] look into these things and on your
[33:17] own you're going to see a prophet in
[33:23] Moab and you see that balum baale Feast
[33:27] of PE all these events take place in
[33:31] Moab think of those things and this is
[33:33] the place that immc goes back to but as
[33:36] we read this I want you to see that Moab
[33:37] was a country under a
[33:39] curse it was a land of idolatry it was a
[33:42] land of ungodliness it was a land of
[33:43] crime different places I've been reading
[33:45] spoke of just the ungodliness of the
[33:47] land and now here it says in numbers CH
[33:50] 24: 15 to 17 and he took up his Parable
[33:54] and said balam and now bam is speaking
[33:56] balum the son of beor hath said and the
[33:59] man the man whose eyes are open hath
[34:01] said Heath said which he heard the words
[34:04] of God and knew the knowledge of the
[34:05] most high which saw the vision of the
[34:07] almighty fallen into a trance but having
[34:10] his eyes open hears balam's
[34:12] pronouncement I shall see him but not
[34:14] now I Shall Behold Him but not nigh
[34:17] there shall come a star out of Jacob and
[34:20] a scepter shall rise out of Israel and
[34:22] shall Smite the corners of Moab and
[34:25] destroy all the children of sh death one
[34:29] translation said it shall destroy all
[34:31] the princes of Moab it says it shall
[34:34] Smite the corners of Moab it doesn't
[34:36] mean he's just can go over go dtin here
[34:37] and dtin there when it says the corns it
[34:40] means all of it to to the whole breadth
[34:43] of it everything about Moab so here's
[34:45] balam we know the story of balam how
[34:47] that he is supposed to prophesy a curse
[34:49] upon Israel for the benefit of the
[34:51] moabites and for the benefit of Moab but
[34:54] when he comes under this anointing he
[34:55] begins to prophesy that a star shall
[34:57] come out of Jacob a scepter power shall
[35:00] rise out of Israel and what is it going
[35:01] to do it's going to completely destroy
[35:03] and smite the corners all of
[35:06] Moab so Moab is a cursed Nation it's a
[35:12] cursed land it's a cursed country it's a
[35:14] place say look that they're going to be
[35:16] judged they're going to fall they're
[35:17] going to be torn down this is not a
[35:19] place you want to go and hang out this
[35:22] is not a place you want to go and live
[35:23] and while we're just trying to catch
[35:24] back up we're trying to get our feet
[35:25] underneath us and we're just going to go
[35:27] there for a while and the the lesson
[35:29] keeps coming up over and over I'm just
[35:31] going to souljour for a while we're just
[35:33] going to go for a while but we'll be
[35:35] back be very very careful the place you
[35:38] plan to
[35:39] visit because sometimes when you visit
[35:41] for the the wrong place for the wrong
[35:43] reasons getting out can be very very
[35:46] hard Naomi made it out but with the
[35:49] prize because when it came time for her
[35:51] to return she didn't return with the men
[35:53] in her
[35:54] life and so though they were going just
[35:56] to sojourn whereever they're wanting to
[35:58] go was a place that was under a curse I
[36:02] shall Smite the corners of Moab this was
[36:03] a prophecy that went forth Moab is going
[36:06] to be judged Moab is going to be
[36:08] condemned and what waited IMC and Moab
[36:12] and think of this and this is where we
[36:13] have the benefit
[36:15] of knowing the rest of the story and and
[36:18] and and reading this in conjunction to
[36:20] the things that have happened uh that we
[36:22] know happened later what awaited IMC he
[36:26] dies his two son dies what awaits Naomi
[36:28] and Moab Moab is already foreshadowed in
[36:30] the history of
[36:31] Moab as you read this it's so remarkable
[36:34] to me as immc goes into Moab little does
[36:38] he know that he could just read the
[36:39] history of Moab and get an idea about
[36:41] what's about to happen to
[36:43] him because the symmetry of the Book of
[36:45] Ruth and the beginnings of Moab are
[36:47] striking the parallels and the symmetry
[36:49] of how that in the Book of Ruth IMC with
[36:52] his wife and two sons flees into Moab
[36:54] but by the time his dealings in Moab are
[36:56] over elimin is dead and the two sons are
[36:59] dead and one woman is returning now with
[37:01] daughter-in-laws this symmetry to the
[37:03] origins of Moab is very very
[37:05] striking in Genesis chter 19:
[37:14] 36-37 I think I might be figuring this
[37:16] out I feel like I'm almost done and it's
[37:17] only two two minutes past eight maybe
[37:21] you're going to be able to make it to
[37:22] Culver
[37:25] tonight Genesis chapter 19 ver verses 36
[37:28] to
[37:31] 37 now in Genesis 19 well we could even
[37:36] back up just to take the whole scene
[37:38] that's taking place God said I'm going
[37:40] to judge Sodom and
[37:43] Gomorrah Abraham is not living in Sodom
[37:46] gomorra he's not down in Sodom but he
[37:49] has these angels that visit him and one
[37:52] of them is the Lord that has a vision
[37:54] has a prophecy for Abraham regarding his
[37:56] wife Sarah
[37:58] and the other two angels are going to go
[38:01] what into Sodom to warn the people or to
[38:04] go into Sodom because there's judgment
[38:07] coming and there's a judgment that's
[38:09] coming on Sodom and lot is in Sodom we
[38:11] know the Angels go down there and even
[38:13] as Abraham pleaded with the Lord look if
[38:14] you could just find 50 righteous 40 30
[38:17] 10 finally God says what we can't find
[38:19] enough righteous we're going to judge
[38:20] Sodom and Gomora and these Messengers
[38:23] tell lot get out of Sodom with your wife
[38:26] and your daughters flee bom and don't
[38:29] stop just get to the mountain whatever
[38:30] you do don't stop keep going but in the
[38:34] story Lot's wife just takes a slight
[38:37] look back turned into a pillar of salt
[38:39] so she's judged because the the angel
[38:41] said don't even look back don't look for
[38:43] nothing and the story tells us that lot
[38:46] and his two daughters don't even fully
[38:48] obey the Angel's message but they stop
[38:49] in zir at to solder so to Z zoir and
[38:54] this is what happens there that while
[38:56] they're there the daughters realize well
[38:58] there's no heirs to for lot there's no
[39:00] Sons to continue his lineage so then uh
[39:03] they want to have children with him it
[39:06] says thus were both the daughters of lot
[39:08] with child by their father it it's
[39:10] obviously a very delicate subject and I
[39:12] know you understand what we're referring
[39:14] to thus were both the daughters of lot
[39:16] with child by their father and the
[39:19] firstborn beah son and called his name
[39:23] Moab the same as the father of the
[39:25] moabites unto this day
[39:27] so who are the moabites they're related
[39:30] to lot who is lot Abraham's
[39:33] nephew and so Moab in the very origin of
[39:37] this nation of Moab this is what their
[39:39] Beginnings think of their beginnings and
[39:40] how they were born through this
[39:42] relationship referred to in Genesis 19
[39:45] these daughters have this son the son
[39:47] that is Born the firstborn is named Moab
[39:50] and he is now he is the beginning in the
[39:52] Genesis of the people of Moab or the
[39:54] moabites and so that's where it has its
[39:57] beginning and there's a certain meaning
[39:59] or symbolism that's now going to be
[40:01] associated with Moab from that moment on
[40:04] because lot is typed as the foolish
[40:06] virgin he's typed as the make believer
[40:07] he's typed as the unbeliever mo lot does
[40:09] not hold a very uh Pleasant place in
[40:12] scripture when you look at his example
[40:14] in his life and so there's a meaning or
[40:16] a symbolism that is intended when it
[40:18] says that IMC left Bethlehem Judah the
[40:21] house of God's praise the house of God's
[40:23] bread left Bethlehem Judah and goes into
[40:26] Moab and and they're going to a place
[40:28] whose beginning is very very dark whose
[40:31] beginning comes from a time of judgment
[40:33] and hurried Exodus out of Sodom and
[40:35] gamorra a failure to fully obey all the
[40:37] Commandments of the Lord a decision that
[40:39] is makes made amongst these daughters
[40:40] that is very very dark to bring forth
[40:42] these children and now this first child
[40:44] that comes forth is
[40:46] Moab and who is he who is he a son to
[40:50] lot and look at lot because there's a
[40:53] meaning that's intended in this in
[40:54] Genesis 13: 10-13
[40:58] and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld
[41:00] all the plain of Jordan that it was well
[41:03] watered and everywhere before the Lord
[41:05] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the
[41:07] garden of the Lord like the land of
[41:09] Egypt as thou comest unto Zoar which is
[41:13] this land is on is near Jordan in the
[41:17] land that would be considered Moab it's
[41:19] the country of Jordan now the nation of
[41:20] Jordan now is where Moab would have been
[41:23] and so lot is drawn to this area why
[41:27] because it's well watered everywhere why
[41:30] is he drawn to it it's like a garden of
[41:31] the Lord so he would lot said Abraham
[41:34] said you choose what did notot choose
[41:37] based upon oh this looks nice this looks
[41:39] pleasing this this this looks really
[41:41] good verse 11 then lot chose him all the
[41:45] plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed East
[41:47] and they separated themselves one from
[41:49] the other Abram dwelt in the land of
[41:51] Canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of
[41:54] the plain and pitched his tent toward
[41:56] Sodom
[41:58] I we think well this is wise I mean this
[41:59] is prudent that's what if you were given
[42:01] a choice of well-watered planes what
[42:03] would you choose he chose what would
[42:05] have been more economically beneficial
[42:07] he chose the one that had more
[42:08] advantages this is why he chose the
[42:10] well-watered plains but it revealed
[42:12] something in lot's character but the men
[42:14] of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before
[42:17] the Lord
[42:19] exceedingly even though the Bible tells
[42:21] us that it vexed his righteous Soul it
[42:23] was something that he did not have the
[42:25] appropriate fear over that he ultimately
[42:28] assimilated himself into the culture and
[42:29] the people of Sodom I say assimilated
[42:31] himself in the culture he eventually
[42:33] moves in amongst them and he's existed
[42:35] among them to where he would have been
[42:36] the subject of the Judgment had he
[42:39] remained but just as immc chose Moab
[42:43] because it was well watered and had
[42:46] abundance Moab has its beginning with
[42:49] lot and lot chose a very same area
[42:53] because it was well watered and it was
[42:54] the G it was like the garden of the Lord
[42:56] so
[42:57] chooses just like lot had chosen that's
[43:00] where he's going in Genesis chapter 19
[43:04] lot is in zor with his two
[43:07] daughters and his wife well he's in zoah
[43:10] with his two daughters but had lost his
[43:12] wife as he was fleeing Sodom and
[43:15] gomorra and so here's In This Very land
[43:19] in this very area who's going to be the
[43:21] father of Moab when Moab is birth as a
[43:23] nation when moab's going to come forth
[43:25] now remember one day Alm is going to
[43:27] come but before it comes here's a man
[43:29] and his two daughters with his wife
[43:31] having just died and the son Moab is
[43:34] born and what happened in the story of
[43:37] Ruth we just read it Naomi was
[43:41] left in
[43:43] Moab without her husband without her two
[43:46] sons after LMC dies with two
[43:51] daughter-in-laws just as lot is there
[43:53] with his two daughters and births the
[43:55] nation of Moab the symmetry now with the
[43:57] Book of Ruth that now Naomi is going to
[43:59] be right back there now with two
[44:02] daughter-in-laws one has been judged it
[44:04] one has been judged their wife has been
[44:06] judged he's been cast out of Sodom and
[44:08] gor judgment is coming on the places
[44:10] that he once lived and fellowship in now
[44:12] Naomi's experience a similar kind of
[44:18] judgment it's remarkable
[44:21] Symmetry and the
[44:23] firstborn daughter bore a son and called
[44:26] his name name
[44:28] Moab Moab means of his father of lot of
[44:31] his father or seed of his father and I'm
[44:35] I'm going to end on this this part right
[44:37] here it was a son of lot and lot means
[44:42] covering that the mobites now are sons
[44:46] of lot the seed of lot lot the make
[44:48] believer lot the foolish virgin lot the
[44:50] one who's just playing Church the the
[44:52] lot the one who could not follow could
[44:55] not make the right decision about Sodom
[44:57] and Gomorrah who could not obey the
[44:58] Angel's testimony comeing to flee Sodom
[45:01] completely don't stop keep going go go
[45:04] all the way but he stopped short and
[45:05] settles in Zar the moabites are the sons
[45:08] of
[45:10] lot the moabites are of his father the
[45:13] seed of his father lot which means
[45:16] covering and this is what is meant in
[45:18] fleeing to
[45:22] Moab brother B says this you probably
[45:25] already thought about where I'm going
[45:26] with this that's what a covering
[45:28] is but this is what's represented in
[45:30] going to Moab God hiding himself in
[45:34] Simplicity this is the one that was
[45:35] preached in Albuquerque brother B says
[45:37] in the beginning when man sinned it
[45:40] showed the nature of
[45:42] man what's important for us is to not
[45:44] look at immc as a sympathetic historical
[45:47] figure but to even recognize him as an
[45:50] image of us what could be our base
[45:53] instincts what could be our our
[45:54] weaknesses what could be our downside
[45:56] brother says in the beginning when man
[45:58] send it showed the nature of man he's
[46:01] always trying to hide from God and make
[46:04] himself a way that he can feel Justified
[46:06] a
[46:07] religion religion is a way for man to
[46:10] feel Justified that's been a religion
[46:12] means a covering a religion means a
[46:15] covering so he tried to make his own
[46:18] religion now this is the image that
[46:20] brother Bam's trying to bring before us
[46:21] that when man makes a mistake when he
[46:23] does something wrong instead of making
[46:25] it right he tries to justify himself and
[46:28] in order to find support for his
[46:31] justifications he builds a
[46:33] religion can accumulate different quotes
[46:35] or different ideas different theologies
[46:37] different ways and certain traditions
[46:39] and so he can stand behind all these
[46:41] things say well how can I be wrong look
[46:43] at how many others believe this how can
[46:45] I be wrong look at all these different
[46:47] things look at the blessings look at the
[46:48] benefits look at this and hides behind
[46:51] this as a way to justify himself and
[46:53] make him feel that he is covered with
[46:55] God
[46:57] this is the this is in the beginning
[46:58] when man sinned it showed man's nature
[47:01] instead of just coming to God as he is
[47:03] and saying I'm sorry he tries to make a
[47:05] way to feel Justified and that's what
[47:08] religion is is a way to self justify and
[47:11] he calls it a
[47:12] covering and this is I believe this is
[47:14] one of the images that is meant to come
[47:16] up when we see IMC leaving the judgments
[47:19] of God trying to avoid the judgments of
[47:20] the god in Bethlehem Judah and traveled
[47:22] to a place of Moab Moab is seed of lot
[47:25] seed of My Father which which means
[47:27] covering it was a place IMC is trying to
[47:30] cover his own Disobedience and outrun
[47:32] the judgments of
[47:34] God in Genesis 3: 7 to8 it says the eyes
[47:39] of them both were open it's speaking
[47:40] about Adam and the woman after they had
[47:42] partaken of the tree of knowledge of
[47:43] Good and Evil and the eyes of both of
[47:45] them were open and they knew that they
[47:46] were naked and they sewed fig leaves
[47:50] together and made themselves
[47:53] aprons and they heard the voice of the
[47:56] Lord God walking Walking In The Garden
[47:58] in the cool of the
[48:00] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[48:03] from the presence of the Lord God
[48:05] amongst the Trees of the
[48:09] garden had they eaten of a tree of the
[48:11] garden literally I doubt that they would
[48:13] have
[48:14] hidden among the trees in the garden
[48:17] right kind of like a kid trying to hide
[48:20] the fact that he ate a cookie out of the
[48:21] cookie jar by hiding behind the cookie
[48:24] jar so just another evidence I believe
[48:26] in scripture of the allegory the image
[48:29] and the analogy of partaking to the
[48:30] fruit of the knowledge of tree of e good
[48:32] and evil is
[48:33] symbolic but now we see the guilty
[48:37] hiding from the presence of God Among
[48:39] the Trees of the
[48:41] garden think of how I silly it
[48:46] is think of even we try to get the image
[48:49] of you know even the the the kid eating
[48:52] the cookie out of the cookie jar and you
[48:53] look at him said did you eat a
[48:55] cookie and and the cookie jar and it's
[48:59] like then why are there chocolate chips
[49:02] all over your face it's
[49:05] like I don't know there's not any
[49:08] chocolate chips on my face this is just
[49:10] almost how foolish it was God you you do
[49:14] know God's going to know what you did
[49:15] even if you go sew yourself together you
[49:17] know some fig leaves you do know God
[49:20] knows God's calling for you you do know
[49:22] you can't hide from God but this is the
[49:24] foolishness of a religious covering this
[49:26] is is how indoctrinated people can be
[49:28] and how much in bondage they can be and
[49:30] how shortsighted they are to think well
[49:32] I'm escaping God's judgment or it really
[49:34] doesn't matter and it's just a phase and
[49:36] this is not going to bother me and
[49:38] everything's going to be okay when the
[49:39] auar said hold on wait a minute we've
[49:41] done something wrong God forgive us we
[49:43] shouldn't have done it they run from it
[49:44] brother battle identifies that the
[49:46] Instinct in man even to this day is to
[49:50] try to cover up instead of
[49:53] relent to try to cover up instead of
[49:55] repent justify well but this and but
[49:57] that and this that and the other instead
[49:59] just saying God I'm
[50:01] sorry this is exactly what ALC was doing
[50:04] I'll try to get my family out of this
[50:05] situation we're going to work harder uh
[50:07] we're going to work smarter not harder
[50:08] we're going to go to Moab and we're
[50:09] going to figure this out and we're going
[50:10] to save some money and we're going to
[50:12] get out of this problem we're going to
[50:13] go back and we're going to buy the ranch
[50:14] again and everything's going to work out
[50:15] it doesn't matter we're just leaving for
[50:16] a little bit we'll be back message don't
[50:18] worry we're coming back where are you
[50:20] moving the middle of nowhere North
[50:22] Dakota is there a church there no but
[50:23] we'll be back there Believers there no
[50:26] but will be
[50:28] back and this is what I want you to
[50:32] ponder tonight as we
[50:35] close it
[50:38] was God is bringing this image up he
[50:41] mentions it twice there in these first
[50:43] two verses in the country of Moab into
[50:46] the country of
[50:47] Moab it's a theme that's repeated quite
[50:50] often in the book the moit the moit the
[50:52] moit the moit it's something that's not
[50:54] just it's not just there to give us some
[50:55] historical cont context or some
[50:57] geographical reference I believe it
[50:58] means something and I believe that if we
[51:01] could even catch the hidden revelation
[51:03] of what Moab represents we can begin to
[51:05] understand more how God is wanting to
[51:07] deal with us in this time and in this
[51:09] day that if you could catch the
[51:11] revelation of what he is in this story
[51:13] and what he is to you and how to accept
[51:15] him this is what brother Brandon want us
[51:17] to do I think there's something that we
[51:18] can see in this image of Moab brother
[51:21] Ram says in the message conferences oh
[51:23] the hour the tremendous time that we are
[51:26] living in and when men are told of their
[51:29] error instead of trying to come back and
[51:31] say father I'm wrong forgive me they
[51:34] still hide behind the Fig leaves it's
[51:37] still the problem today fig Lea is fig
[51:40] leaves are what they sewed together the
[51:42] word religion means a
[51:45] covering now this is I would say this is
[51:48] a prophetic
[51:49] definition how that the the certain a
[51:52] religion to be to be dedicated to some
[51:54] precepts to be dedicated to a particular
[51:57] ideology or theology is just a covering
[51:59] for man's sin instead of accepting the
[52:02] true sacrifice and the true way to
[52:04] Salvation the word religion means a
[52:06] covering they tried to make themselves
[52:08] themselves a handmade covering and man
[52:11] hasn't changed yet
[52:16] today we must challenge ourselves with
[52:19] this image of
[52:21] Moab that it still exists within mankind
[52:24] today to justify and make it excuses
[52:27] instead of saying I'm
[52:28] sorry instead of owning up to it and
[52:31] making it right and doing what they
[52:32] ought to do well I do this and I do that
[52:34] and it's okay this it's okay
[52:36] that Moab represents
[52:40] religion Moab was the son of lot who
[52:42] means
[52:44] covering our
[52:46] Moab is a religious
[52:51] covering so what does Moab represent to
[52:53] us in this story
[52:57] think about it are you
[53:00] thinking it's what Ruth was called out
[53:05] of I I I've set it up this way in
[53:08] talking about immc going in and imc's
[53:12] rebellion and immc stubbornness and his
[53:14] obstinance and his own son marrying orpa
[53:17] who stiff necked and and all these
[53:19] images on this one side of this negative
[53:21] side this dark side and we can represent
[53:23] now Moab who is the son of lot the seed
[53:26] of his father of of his father which was
[53:29] covering in the history of lot and the
[53:31] nature of lot and the nature of the
[53:32] mobites and the curse of upon Moab and
[53:35] everything that Moab represents that's
[53:37] where Lim like fled but that's not the
[53:40] point because I I'm not speaking to you
[53:42] as
[53:43] aex the point is this is what God calls
[53:47] roof out
[53:48] of that's that's not where you're going
[53:51] that's not where you're headed even if
[53:53] it's position in the beginning to say
[53:54] well you got to be careful don't make
[53:56] the sins of of ALC but yes we could use
[53:58] that in a way to challenge ourselves to
[54:00] make sure that we're looking at the
[54:01] right factors when we make a decision
[54:03] but above all it's the mindset it's the
[54:06] condition it's the attitude it's the
[54:08] religious covering that God is wanting
[54:10] to call us out of as the Gentile
[54:14] bride this is what Ruth was delivered
[54:16] from this is the great Proclamation when
[54:19] she says your people will be my people
[54:21] your God will be my God it's it's it's
[54:24] it's a signpost to us that this is what
[54:26] God wants to take us out
[54:29] of is is something that can be closely
[54:32] related to the message as lot was oh it
[54:34] can be so close it can sh share so many
[54:38] same fundamental ideas it can share the
[54:40] same worship of the same God but yet
[54:42] what God had to do is she couldn't find
[54:45] redemption in Moab she couldn't find
[54:47] relationship in Moab the Gentile bride
[54:50] has got to come out of Moab to find her
[54:55] Boaz and this is what the bread of life
[54:57] is calling us out of
[54:59] today when it says the living bread of
[55:01] life bringing forth the bride is to call
[55:04] us out of our moabi is condition to
[55:08] completely change our our identity as
[55:11] Aaron the Gentile Elizabeth the Gentile
[55:14] L the Gentile and we're to change our
[55:16] mindset of Gentile human this is what we
[55:19] are to where we can finally come to the
[55:21] place where we believe that we are who
[55:23] we are in God's election and according
[55:26] to God's word and so God is calling us
[55:29] out of Moab to Redemption the living
[55:31] bread of life today what it's doing
[55:33] right now in your life you could just
[55:35] stop for a moment say all right I'm
[55:36] going to take a deep breath Culver is
[55:37] open to at least nine we still have some
[55:39] time yet what is God doing in my life
[55:41] right now we we know you're not in Moab
[55:44] we know you're not somewhere in the
[55:45] Middle East you're not in denominations

[55:48] here tonight but what is the living
[55:50] bread of life still trying to do for you
[55:53] to bring the full Revelation that you

[56:05] you're the very center of his
[56:09] program and the living Bread of Life
[56:11] Today is still calling you out of a
[56:13] moabites
[56:15] mindset and it's the remedy to a moabi
[56:18] US

[56:23] mobites I want to say it again I want to
[56:24] get a real hearty amen we don't want to
[56:26] be message

[56:30] close we don't want to be that and so
[56:32] what does it mean go ahead and study in
[56:34] the message start re start looking at
[56:35] what it means to be a moabit in the
[56:38] message and how brother Brandon placed
[56:40] this
[56:43] nation I'm reminding myself I was going
[56:45] to be
[56:46] short let me just say this so you can
[56:48] start thinking about it brother bam says
[56:51] that Moab always looked down on Israel
[56:58] why would you want to
[56:59] support something that looks down on
[57:02] you why would you want to be a part of
[57:04] something that belittles
[57:06] you dehumanizes you dechristianize you
[57:11] if given the chance would just use you
[57:13] and let go of you like
[57:17] that that's what Moab
[57:20] represents that's what this living bread
[57:21] of life is calling you out
[57:23] of let's stand to our feet tonight
[57:40] it's nice to have you back brother Micah
[57:43] trust your trip was a
[57:46] blessing we bow our heads in
[57:52] prayer the living bread of life
[57:56] is our remedy to a moabit
[58:00] religion the message of the hour in its
[58:02] pure form is trying to call us out of
[58:06] these
[58:08] mindsets these attitudes these behaviors
[58:16] [Music]
[58:26] if you need a touch in your heart just
[58:27] lift your hand to the Lord
[58:30] tonight I believe he wants to touch you
[58:32] he wants to strengthen you wants to
[58:34] encourage you don't be
[58:40] frustrated as fellowship with somebody
[58:44] here recently
[58:45] and they expressed how that they just
[58:47] realized after 50 years or so of
[58:50] something that they'd been battling with
[58:52] their whole lives something that always
[58:54] plagued them they couldn't ever get past
[58:56] and that God had just brought it was
[58:58] just bringing him to the realization of
[59:00] it and it seemed that maybe there was
[59:02] some discouragement in the realization
[59:04] and I said my just think of the
[59:07] grace that after all these years he's
[59:09] not done trying to show
[59:11] you after all these years he's still
[59:13] willing to say no this this is what's
[59:15] holding you back my
[59:17] child and tonight let's not be
[59:21] discouraged if you hear the voice of God
[59:23] walking in the cool of the day don't
[59:25] hide
[59:27] just say Here I Am
[59:28] Lord I know I've made
[59:31] mistakes I know I
[59:34] failed I know as a treacherous wife I've
[59:39] dealt foolishly with you but now Lord
[59:42] I'm coming back will you heal my
[59:46] backsliding and make me
[59:52] whole if you're in Moab the message is
[59:55] not
[59:57] oh if you're in Moab and then you're a
[59:58] moabit and you can't be redeemed it's
[1:00:00] come
[1:00:02] out we're always going in keep inverting
[1:00:05] until we finally get it right you are
[1:00:07] not lost you are not forsaken you are
[1:00:09] not non-elect you're not foolish you're
[1:00:12] not Hellbound you are the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:15] Christ you're going to make it in any
[1:00:18] condition to the contrary it's God
[1:00:20] saying I can handle this that's what the
[1:00:22] word is for I can handle this let's just
[1:00:25] yield to
[1:00:27] that as the word of God said that let's
[1:00:30] not be stiff neck but yield yourselves
[1:00:33] unto the Lord and enter into his
[1:00:36] Sanctuary could you do that tonight
[1:00:39] yield yourselves unto the Lord our
[1:00:42] gracious Heavenly Father this is my
[1:00:44] prayer
[1:00:46] tonight Lord I I I I sense it and I feel
[1:00:50] it how that there's a press of
[1:00:53] resistance in the face of God's people
[1:00:57] as it were a screen or that or a jail
[1:01:01] cell Lord they can see past the
[1:01:04] bars like a plexiglass or a ceiling a
[1:01:08] glass it's there they can see beyond it
[1:01:10] but it just seems like they run right up
[1:01:12] against
[1:01:14] it and Lord I believe that
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:17] it worse it's a
[1:01:21] mirage in other words father I believe
[1:01:23] that there
[1:01:24] is there's no reality to those chains
[1:01:27] there's no reality to that glass there's
[1:01:29] no reality to that
[1:01:31] screen that they are somehow withheld
[1:01:35] from it permanently that they can never
[1:01:37] get past
[1:01:39] it some ways lord it's just a learned
[1:01:41] response from all these dashed hopes and
[1:01:44] Broken
[1:01:46] Dreams and Lord tonight is if there be
[1:01:48] any believer that feels restrained and
[1:01:50] held back from your
[1:01:52] promises Lord may they just simply yield
[1:01:55] to you tonight
[1:01:57] and say Lord I'm just yielding to
[1:02:00] you I'm not afraid of finding out that
[1:02:03] I've done something wrong I'm not afraid
[1:02:05] to find out that my choices have been
[1:02:06] wrong I'm not afraid to find out that
[1:02:08] I've been on the wrong path I'm not
[1:02:09] afraid to admit that I've sinned and
[1:02:11] I've made mistakes because I'm coming to
[1:02:13] the one who can heal me of my
[1:02:15] backslidings Lord as long as I use a
[1:02:17] religious covering of my backsliding it
[1:02:19] can never be healed as long as I
[1:02:21] continue in this moabites mindset I can
[1:02:23] never be healed but Lord now I'm shaking
[1:02:25] off the nature of IMC I'm shaking off
[1:02:28] the nature of orpa I'm shaking off my my
[1:02:30] moabitas nature and nurture Lord and I'm
[1:02:33] yielding to you
[1:02:35] tonight the Lover of My
[1:02:37] Soul
