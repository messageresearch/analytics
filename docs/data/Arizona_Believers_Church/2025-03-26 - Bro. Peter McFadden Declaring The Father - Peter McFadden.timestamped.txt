[9:59] I just want to be more like you. Let's

[13:46] prayer this evening. Just want to
[13:48] remember the McGiri family homesick
[13:50] tonight. Brother Michael was homesick as
[13:52] well this evening. Seems to be a bug
[13:55] going around. So if you know of anyone,
[13:56] just hold them in your heart tonight as
[13:58] we approach his throne. If you have a
[14:01] need, just make it known by an uplifted
[14:03] hand. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[14:06] count it a privilege to be gathered
[14:08] tonight with your people,
[14:10] Father. Lord, we come expecting to hear
[14:12] from you this evening, Lord. But we're
[14:15] thankful for this opportunity, Lord
[14:17] Jesus, just to enter into worship, Lord,
[14:19] to just shed the worries of the day,
[14:22] Lord God, the stresses of the week,
[14:24] Father. Anything that would be hindering
[14:26] us from receiving what you have for us
[14:27] tonight, Lord, we just wash it away in
[14:30] worship now this evening, God. Father,
[14:32] we ask that you receive our praise from
[14:34] pure hearts, Lord Jesus.
[14:37] Lord, we just yield ourselves to you
[14:39] tonight, God. Asking that you have the
[14:41] preeminence in our midst, Father.
[14:43] Accomplish anything that you've purposed
[14:46] for your people tonight, Lord God, and
[14:49] we'll receive it. God, we ask a special
[14:51] blessing on the McGary household.
[14:53] Father, as they battle sickness, Father
[14:55] God, just not feeling well, we ask that
[14:57] you deliver a special touch to them
[15:00] tonight, Lord God. Just raise them up
[15:02] completely, restore them. We pray, Lord,
[15:04] for brother Micah. that just under the
[15:07] weather as well. We ask that you just go
[15:09] to his home, Lord Jesus, touch him
[15:11] completely. Deliver him in the way that
[15:12] only you can, Lord. Father, for those
[15:15] who couldn't be here tonight, Lord,
[15:17] whatever the barriers are, we ask that
[15:18] you just step in, show yourself mighty
[15:20] on their behalf. For every uplifted
[15:23] hand, Lord God, we know that you're the
[15:24] provider, Father. So, we just look to
[15:27] you expectantly this evening, Lord God.
[15:29] We lay it at your feet. We ask that you
[15:32] just bless each one in attendance
[15:33] tonight, God. Bless our brother as he
[15:35] brings the word. Lord, may you just
[15:37] speak through him. Be with the tithes
[15:39] and the offerings as they come forward.
[15:40] In the precious name of Jesus Christ, we
[15:42] pray.
[15:44] Amen.
[15:45] [Music]
[15:49] Amen. Well, my heart was
[15:52] distressed Jehovah's dread frown. And
[15:57] low in the pit where my sins drag me
[16:01] down. I cried to the Lord from the deep
[16:06] my reclaim who tenderly brought me out
[16:11] to golden day. Oh, and he brought me out
[16:17] of the mighty clay.
[16:20] And he sent my feet on the rock to stay.
[16:26] And he puts a song in my soul
[16:31] today. A song of praise.
[16:36] Hallelujah. He placed me upon the strong
[16:41] rock by his side. My steps were
[16:45] established. And here I'll abide. No
[16:50] danger of falling with I remain but
[16:55] stand by his grace until the crown I
[17:00] gave. Oh, he brought me out of the
[17:04] mighty grave. And he set my feet on the
[17:10] rock to
[17:12] stay. He puts a sun in my soul today.
[17:18] A song of praise.
[17:23] Hallelujah. Well, he gave me a song was
[17:27] a new song of praise. By day and by
[17:32] night, it sweeten notes I will raise. My
[17:36] heart's
[17:38] overflowing. I'm happy and free. I'll
[17:42] praise my redeemer who has rescued me.
[17:47] Oh, and he brought me out of the mighty
[17:52] clay. And he set my feet on the rock to
[17:58] stay. He puts a song in my soul
[18:04] to a song of praise.
[18:09] Hallelu. And I'll sing of his wonderful
[18:14] mercy to me.
[18:18] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[18:21] Lord. And I'll sing of
[18:24] salvation and hope and abroad till many
[18:29] shall hear the truth and trust in God.
[18:34] Oh, he brought me out of the mighty
[18:39] clay. And he set my feet on the rock to
[18:45] stay.
[18:47] peace in my soul today. A song of
[18:53] praise.
[18:55] Hallelujah. Oh, and he brought me out of
[19:00] the merry flame. And he set my feet on
[19:06] the rock to stay. And he puts a song in
[19:12] my soul today. A song of praise.
[19:20] Hallelujah. Amen. You may be seated this
[19:23] evening. The brothers want to go ahead
[19:24] and take up the tithes and
[19:26] offerings. Let's sing. There is a
[19:28] fountain.

[20:21] state? Who's
[20:24] all their
[20:27] guilty state?
[20:32] And
[20:34] sinners plunge
[20:39] beneath that flood pose
[20:44] all their
[20:47] guilty state.
[20:52] A
[20:54] dying thief
[20:58] rejoice to
[21:00] see that
[21:03] fountain
[21:06] tend his day.
[21:12] And

[29:19] shineing through me. Sing it
[29:24] again. And all I want to
[29:28] see is J. Yes, Lord. Hallelujah.
[29:35] All I want to

[33:48] brother Peter McFaden here with us this
[33:50] evening to minister. So as we invite him
[33:51] to come, let's just sing, I bless your
[33:55] name. I bless your
[34:01] name. I
[34:04] bless your
[34:08] name. I give you honor.
[34:16] I give
[34:23] you. Oh, you are the
[34:29] life, the
[34:31] truth, the
[34:37] way. I
[34:38] bless your name.
[34:44] I bless your name. Some midnight
[34:50] hour. Some
[34:52] midnight hour.
[34:58] If you should
[35:03] find, you're in a
[35:10] presence in your mind.
[35:18] Reach out and
[35:23] pray to find those
[35:30] chains and they will
[35:37] fall in
[35:39] Jesus name.
[35:44] I bless your
[35:50] name. I bless your
[35:57] name. I give you
[36:04] honor. I give you praise.
[36:11] You are the
[36:17] life, the
[36:19] truth, the
[36:24] way. I bless your
[36:31] name. I
[36:33] bless your
[36:36] name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Greet you
[36:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[36:42] The only name that's worthy of praise
[36:44] and honor. He's the only great one among
[36:46] us. But if he's here, then we've not
[36:48] come in vain. I know you didn't come to
[36:50] see me. You didn't come to hear me. But
[36:52] we came to look to the promises of God.
[36:55] We came to gather in faith and and to
[36:58] believe that the Lord will meet us here.
[37:01] So let's let's just pray. Father, it's
[37:04] good to be with your people, Lord. the
[37:07] people that you've put your name
[37:09] in. And Lord, we don't have any
[37:13] goodness, any worthiness of ourselves to
[37:15] stand here. But Lord, we thank you for
[37:17] Calvary. We thank you for the blood that
[37:19] was shed. Lord, that when we were yet
[37:20] sinners, Lord, enemies of God, Lord,
[37:22] you've reconciled us to yourself through
[37:25] the death of your
[37:27] son. Father, help us to accept what
[37:30] you've purchased, Lord, that we could
[37:32] walk in faith, Lord, that you would draw
[37:35] us near to your side, Father. open your
[37:37] word to us, Lord. No man can open this
[37:40] book, but Lord, you can open it to us,
[37:42] Father. And I pray, Lord, that you would
[37:45] send your word once again, Lord, and
[37:46] heal us. We have much need of healing,
[37:49] Lord, in our bodies, in our minds, in
[37:50] our souls, Lord. We come from the
[37:53] battle, Lord, with the different aches
[37:55] and pains of the battle, but Lord, we
[37:58] see you've gone on before,
[38:00] and Lord, we're following in your
[38:02] footsteps, Lord. And we believe that by
[38:05] faith we will be victorious, Lord,
[38:07] through you that made us more than
[38:09] conquerors. Lord, bless the reading of
[38:10] your word. Move me aside, Lord. Seal
[38:13] these lips that they would say anything
[38:15] but your word. And I pray that you would
[38:16] anoint the ears of the hearer. Lord,
[38:18] that your word would go and accomplish
[38:21] that which you sent it to do. Lord, you
[38:22] said it would not return void. And Lord,
[38:25] that's the promise that we're coming and
[38:26] standing. Lord, we stand like David just
[38:29] believing Lord that what you have sent
[38:33] us to do, Lord, you'll also give us the
[38:36] way to do
[38:37] it. So, Lord, come and be here in a
[38:41] special way. I pray you bless Brother
[38:42] Aaron and his family, Lord, and those
[38:45] that are sick, Lord, and just minister
[38:47] to each one, Lord. You know my family,
[38:49] too. I pray you'd bless us and help us,
[38:51] Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. While
[38:55] you're standing, let's go to the book of
[38:58] John, chapter 1, and verse
[39:03] 14. I know a lot of you, but I don't
[39:07] know all of you, but that's not so
[39:10] important. But, uh, my name is Peter
[39:12] McFaten, and I'm by faith one of those
[39:17] that's following after the Lord Jesus.
[39:20] And all my hope and trust is in him. And
[39:22] he has been so good to me. Amen. And uh
[39:25] it's only by his grace that I'm
[39:27] standing. Think of the the scripture
[39:29] says, "By this I know that you favor me,
[39:30] that my enemy doesn't triumph over me."
[39:33] And so if you're standing today, you're
[39:34] keeping the faith. You're you showed up
[39:36] to to serve the Lord. Something drawled
[39:38] you. Well, the Lord must favor you. He's
[39:41] kept you. He's keeping you. And he said
[39:43] he wouldn't lose a one of you. Amen. So
[39:45] that's what we're trusting
[39:47] in. And uh I thank brother Aaron for for
[39:50] this privilege to stand before you. I I
[39:52] I think really highly of of brother
[39:53] Aaron and I think you're really blessed
[39:56] and to to come and and u enjoy the
[39:59] ministry the Lord's given him. I I I
[40:02] look up to to brother Aaron very much
[40:04] and I just uh think very highly of
[40:07] him. Okay. John chapter 1 and verse
[40:13] 14 says, "And the word was made flesh
[40:18] and dwelt among us, and we beheld his
[40:21] glory, the glory as of the only begotten
[40:24] of the Father, full of grace and
[40:28] truth." John bare witness of him, and
[40:31] cried, saying, "This is he of whom I
[40:34] spake. He that cometh after me is
[40:37] preferred before me, for he was before
[40:41] me. And of his
[40:44] fullness have all we received in grace
[40:46] for grace. For the law was given by
[40:49] Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
[40:52] Christ. No man hath seen God at any
[40:56] time. The only begotten
[40:58] son, which is in the bosom of the
[41:01] father, he hath declared him.
[41:04] I want to speak a few minutes on
[41:07] declaring the father and also while
[41:09] you're standing one more scripture if we
[41:12] turn to first
[41:18] John chapter
[41:21] 3 and verse 1 to 3.
[41:28] First John chapter 3 verse one says,
[41:32] "Behold what manner of love the father
[41:36] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[41:39] called the sons of
[41:41] God. Therefore the world knoweth us not
[41:44] because it knew him not. Beloved, now
[41:48] are we the sons of God, and it does not
[41:51] yet appear what we shall be, but we know
[41:54] that when he shall appear, we shall be
[41:56] like him. Amen. For we shall see him as
[42:00] he is. And every man that hath this hope
[42:03] in him purifith himself, even as he is
[42:06] pure. Amen. You may be seated.
[42:14] The thought behind this is related
[42:17] to why we're in town. I live in the
[42:21] cold, frozen land of
[42:25] Massachusetts. And I came here to
[42:28] Arizona for the funeral of a friend,
[42:31] Brother Dan Roberts, from Vale, Tucson
[42:33] area. And as I was thinking, uh, brother
[42:37] Dan passed away what we would say very
[42:40] young, um, in his 40s. He was
[42:43] 48.
[42:46] And thinking about his life, I was
[42:49] thinking about these these scriptures
[42:51] and and so this was all fresh on my
[42:53] heart from the funeral was last week in
[42:55] Tucson. And so this was what I've been
[42:58] pondering. And then uh talking to
[43:00] brother Aaron on Sunday, he said, "Well,
[43:02] do you have anything um to minister and
[43:05] this was still kind of burning on my
[43:08] heart and just believe that there's
[43:11] something in here for you. You know, we
[43:13] don't just come here to to preach and to
[43:15] make a good sermon, but the Lord knows
[43:18] each one that's here, each one that
[43:20] would be here. And I believe that if
[43:23] you'll just look to the Lord in faith,
[43:24] he can move me aside. He can speak his
[43:27] word to whatever you have need of. Amen.
[43:30] And
[43:32] uh we just thank the Lord that he's so
[43:35] good.
[43:37] Amen. But thinking here in in the book
[43:40] of John, I love the book of John,
[43:43] especially that first chapter because
[43:45] instead of diving right into, well, here
[43:48] was the the parents of Jesus, John takes
[43:51] a step back and he he gives you the big
[43:54] picture.
[43:56] In the beginning was the word and the
[43:57] word was made flesh. And and then he
[44:01] gets to here where he's talking
[44:03] about Jesus, the son of God. He's in the
[44:08] only begotten son. He's in the bosom of
[44:09] the father and he's declaring the
[44:12] father. And naturally, we see that all
[44:15] the time. any any one of us that's seen
[44:18] sons of a father, we can look at the
[44:20] sons and we can see attributes of the
[44:22] father and we can see naturally in in in
[44:25] the physical appearance. You can see the
[44:28] same uh physical attributes but then you
[44:31] can see the same
[44:33] characteristics. You can see the same
[44:35] ways of speaking and the same ways of
[44:37] walking and and we look like our fathers
[44:41] naturally. And just like uh Jesus said,
[44:43] every tree brings forth uh every tree is
[44:46] known of its fruit. And if you if you
[44:49] have an apple, you can tell about the
[44:51] apple tree. And and here in the natural
[44:55] way of um looking at things, we can see
[44:58] this principle that if you want to know
[45:00] about the father, you look at the son.
[45:03] And in the sun is the declaration of the
[45:06] father.
[45:08] And what we're looking to in the word of
[45:12] God is not just something far removed
[45:14] from everyday life and from the
[45:16] creation, but this book of the Bible, it
[45:21] explains the world all around us.
[45:24] Because this world also
[45:26] declares the Lord, declares the creator.
[45:30] This creation declares the creator. And
[45:32] uh David said, "The heavens declare the
[45:36] glory of the Lord." The firmament, all
[45:38] this, it declares the Lord. And so we
[45:42] see in this in this great um world that
[45:46] we're living in, this great creation
[45:48] that we're living in that God's doing
[45:51] something and he's demonstrating
[45:53] something. And we could see way back in
[45:55] the beginning, there was nothing. The
[45:57] earth was without form and void.
[46:00] And and God started moving. The spirit
[46:02] of God started moving on the face of the
[46:04] deep. And in that he was showing
[46:06] something about
[46:07] himself, showing little shadows of
[46:11] redemption, showing little shadows of of
[46:13] God taking something that's ugly and
[46:15] making it
[46:16] beautiful. That all these years later
[46:18] here, we'd be in a church and and we
[46:21] could see in our own lives the same
[46:22] thing that God did back there in
[46:24] Genesis. We took this shapeless void
[46:28] hunk of earth and now look we go out and
[46:31] in the springtime in Arizona we go and
[46:34] see things life coming up and we say wow
[46:38] the Lord has done this. The Lord can do
[46:41] something beautiful in my life if we
[46:43] just hold on in
[46:45] faith. And then we see God making the
[46:49] earth to show himself. and he made a
[46:51] little flower and and he made um some
[46:54] animals and this and that. And then
[46:57] finally we see the son of
[47:01] God walking on the earth. We see
[47:06] Adam and we see in Adam now the best
[47:10] picture that we have of God that we can
[47:13] look at Adam and and before we could
[47:16] kind of guess at how God was looking at
[47:18] the earth, looking at the animals,
[47:20] looking at the flowers, but then God
[47:23] didn't choose the heavens to preach the
[47:26] gospel or the the birds or the bees. But
[47:28] what he chose is man.
[47:31] And he had this perfect man that would
[47:33] show what God was like.
[47:37] And we know there was the fall there
[47:38] where sin came in. But all that was part
[47:41] of God's plan to show the
[47:44] attributes of himself in his son. And
[47:48] that we know that the in God was to be a
[47:52] healer and to show that he could heal us
[47:54] when we're sick. But we couldn't know
[47:56] sickness before the fall. in God was to
[47:59] be a savior, but we couldn't know
[48:01] salvation before the fall. So God
[48:03] allowed sin to come in and to poison
[48:06] things that he could show himself
[48:08] strong. That he could show that he's the
[48:10] one that comforts the brokenhearted.
[48:13] He's the one that binds up the wounds.
[48:15] He's the one that hears when we call
[48:17] when we feel so
[48:19] lonely. That he's God. He's a very
[48:21] present help in times of trouble.
[48:24] And so here we see part of the picture
[48:27] all the way back in Genesis is that for
[48:29] us to know the goodness of
[48:32] God, there had to be some darkness come
[48:35] in. And we see that in our own lives
[48:37] that we'd um we'd expect when we come to
[48:40] God that we everything would just be uh
[48:43] easy all the time.
[48:46] But still we see in in the hard times in
[48:48] the trials that that's where we really
[48:51] see the beauty of the scriptures. that
[48:54] you don't really appreciate an anchor
[48:56] when you're out with your boat and
[48:57] everything's looking great. The anchor
[48:59] is just a bunch of dead weight and uh
[49:02] who needs this? Where's where's the
[49:04] snorkel? Right? But then the storm
[49:07] comes.
[49:09] Then the time comes when your family
[49:11] could be down at the bottom of the sea.
[49:14] Then you're thankful for an anchor. Then
[49:16] you're thankful for a solid rock. Amen.
[49:18] So we thank the Lord for the trials that
[49:21] let us see that he is the unmovable
[49:23] rock. He's the one that like David said,
[49:27] "All my springs are in thee." World will
[49:30] tell you, it's very dangerous to put all
[49:32] your eggs in one basket. You got to
[49:34] diversify and get the whole put some in
[49:37] Bitcoin and put some over here. But
[49:39] David said, "All my springs are in thee.
[49:42] All my hope is in thee." You know, we've
[49:45] got one plan. The Christian has one
[49:46] plan. Yes, that's the Lord Jesus.
[49:50] That he'll get us out of here.
[49:55] Sure is dry here. Now that I'm not from
[49:58] Arizona, I can say
[50:01] that. So, we see Adam. Adam fall. The
[50:04] Lord allowed that. And then you see
[50:07] little glimpses of the nature of God
[50:09] through the prophets. You see in David
[50:12] the heart of God. You see in Moses the
[50:14] law of God. and different ones. You see
[50:18] little pictures here and there of God.
[50:20] The spirit would fall on a man and he
[50:22] would speak the word of
[50:24] God and then the spirit would lift and
[50:27] he'd go on sinning. He'd go on in
[50:30] darkness. His nature was still the
[50:33] fallen nature. We see that even now in a
[50:36] lot of a lot of people a lot of times
[50:39] the spirit can fall and and somebody can
[50:41] speak the word of God.
[50:45] But there's more than that. There's the
[50:47] Lord Jesus came to redeem us back to
[50:50] that perfection of Adam.
[50:53] That we could be like the Lord Jesus.
[50:56] And we don't want to put that far off.
[50:59] As as first it says in first John, now
[51:01] are we the sons of God. And that in this
[51:06] second Adam, this man Christ Jesus, in
[51:09] his death on the cross and his
[51:10] resurrection, that if we put our faith
[51:12] in him and we believe in him, we're
[51:14] restored
[51:16] back to that position of sunship, just
[51:19] like Adam
[51:21] had. And so if we are
[51:25] sons, then we will declare the father
[51:29] just like Jesus did
[51:32] in our lives. And and
[51:34] so we're doing a lot of different things
[51:37] here. And I I heard a story one time
[51:41] uh back in England when when the
[51:43] cathedral burnt down and Christopher Ren
[51:46] and them, they were rebuilding the
[51:48] cathedral and a lot of men working
[51:50] really hard to build this place. And he
[51:53] goes uh one of the men, he goes up,
[51:56] somebody's laying brick. Says, "What are
[51:58] you doing?"
[52:00] man says, "I'm laying brick." He spoke
[52:04] truly. That's what he was doing. He
[52:07] could see what was in front of him. He
[52:09] was doing what was right, but he wasn't
[52:12] too happy about it because laying brick
[52:13] is not all that
[52:15] fun. Gets kind of heavy. So, the man
[52:18] went and found another man. He said,
[52:20] "What are you
[52:22] doing?" The man was also doing the same
[52:24] thing. He was laying brick.
[52:27] This man says, "Well, I'm building a
[52:29] wall. That's a little better. Still
[52:32] true. Still what he's
[52:35] doing, but still not that great." He
[52:38] goes and finds a third
[52:41] man. He says, and this guy's doing the
[52:43] same thing. He says, "What are you
[52:46] doing?" And the third man says, "I'm
[52:49] building a cathedral to point people to
[52:52] God." You know, they're all doing the
[52:54] same thing.
[52:56] But if you understand what the bricks
[52:59] are for,
[53:00] it makes a big difference. If I go up to
[53:03] you and say, "What are you doing?"
[53:04] "Well, I'm uh providing for my family.
[53:08] I'm working a job, doing these things,
[53:13] trying not to lose my
[53:15] temper, trying not to have road rage."
[53:19] You know, we're doing a lot of things
[53:20] and we could speak them truly.
[53:23] say, "I'm just keeping my head above
[53:25] water." No, we have got to have a better
[53:26] confession than that.
[53:29] But if we could step back and see God's
[53:31] doing something in our lives. He's not a
[53:34] God that vainely just, well, I think
[53:36] I'll have some kids. I'll just scatter
[53:37] some kids around and won't this be fun.
[53:40] Won't this be interesting? That's not
[53:42] how God is. God is very particular.
[53:46] He has a plan for each and every one of
[53:48] us.
[53:50] And though we can get forgotten in this
[53:52] world and we can see him
[53:54] invisible, there's a God that knows the
[53:56] very hairs on your head. He said not a
[53:58] sparrow falls to the ground, but he
[53:59] knows about it. So don't think for a
[54:02] minute that he's not mindful of you.
[54:05] He knows what he's doing. And in
[54:08] you, if you're a son of God, if you've
[54:10] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, the
[54:13] word said, as many as are led by the
[54:15] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[54:18] So here we've got a really um a good way
[54:21] of telling is this for us? Is this first
[54:24] John says now are we the sons of God?
[54:26] But who's that? Is that just talking
[54:28] about brother Aaron or brother Michael
[54:30] or Mitch? Brother Mitch. I say Mitch
[54:32] because he's he's my good
[54:35] friend.
[54:37] But if you want to know are you one of
[54:40] those? Are you a son of God? The Bible
[54:43] says as many as are led by the spirit of
[54:46] God.
[54:48] So, if we can believe on the Lord Jesus
[54:50] Christ, if we can accept what he's done
[54:52] for us on
[54:53] Calvary, and if we can surrender, and so
[54:57] here I'm kind of skipping through all
[54:58] the notes, but if we can let go, if we
[55:02] can yield,
[55:04] if we can be led by his spirit, that
[55:07] shows that we're sons. And if we're
[55:10] sons, we're hes joint hes with Christ.
[55:15] Amen.
[55:18] And we
[55:19] declare the image of the father.
[55:23] Even in our failings and our hair that
[55:25] sticks up and our our sinful nature and
[55:28] our bad thoughts and all these
[55:32] things, even in this,
[55:35] we're declaring the father. were showing
[55:38] the world just like Adam walking on the
[55:40] world and pe and now there is a picture
[55:42] of
[55:43] God. Well, that's the sons of God today.
[55:48] That's the sons of God now. So, when
[55:51] somebody comes up to you says, "What are
[55:52] you
[55:55] doing?" Maybe not with your words, but
[55:58] with your life. Your life will say,
[56:01] "There is a God.
[56:04] He's a savior. He's a healer. He's good
[56:08] all the time. His word is true. He's
[56:11] faithful.
[56:14] A lot of preachers can get up and say
[56:16] that, but our lives will say that.
[56:20] And our hearts will say that.
[56:23] Amen.
[56:26] Jesus
[56:27] said, "If you've seen me, you've seen
[56:30] the father."
[56:33] And if we
[56:34] are really following what Jesus said, if
[56:37] we really will by faith be one of his
[56:41] disciples, if we'll take up our cross
[56:44] daily and we'll follow after
[56:47] him, then we'll be part of that same
[56:51] ministry. And
[56:53] that when Jesus was here on on the
[56:56] earth, you know, he was the long awaited
[56:58] Messiah.
[57:00] all this time waiting waiting for this
[57:04] declaration of
[57:07] God. Finally, he's here. He's in the
[57:11] temple. Most people didn't recognize
[57:13] him, but Anna was there. Simeon, they
[57:17] caught it. He's here. The angel saying,
[57:21] "He's here. What
[57:24] now? What now?"
[57:29] There's a long period of
[57:32] time where it doesn't seem like
[57:33] anything's happening. We know Jesus had
[57:36] a short ministry at the end of his life
[57:39] about 30 to 33. So there's about 30
[57:44] years where he's the Messiah. He's the
[57:46] one that's declaring God. Nobody's
[57:49] writing books about
[57:51] him. There's a little miracle here.
[57:54] There's some really nice wedding
[57:57] a well-watered wedding.
[58:01] Um, but there's nothing written about
[58:03] that time. That's okay. That's part of
[58:06] the
[58:07] plan that even though he was the
[58:10] Messiah, he was the perfect one, he was
[58:12] declaring God, the way that he was
[58:14] declaring God for 90% of his life was
[58:18] that he was learning obedience by the
[58:20] things that he suffered.
[58:22] That he was just showing that a real son
[58:25] is obedient.
[58:27] that a real son looks in faith to the
[58:30] father. He wasn't even showing the
[58:32] miracles that
[58:35] came that came at the end. So let's not
[58:39] get weary in
[58:43] welloing. Hold on to the end.
[58:47] You can read this book and there are
[58:50] great exceeding great and powerful
[58:53] promises. They are true.
[58:56] I don't see all of them yet.
[58:59] I don't see all of them in my life
[59:02] yet. But the Bible says, "He that
[59:04] endures to the end, he will be saved."
[59:07] And I believe that the whole creation is
[59:09] groaning together for the manifestation
[59:11] of the sons of God. That there's a time
[59:13] coming that we're going to see prophecy
[59:16] being fulfilled and all these things.
[59:18] And we've
[59:19] seen so much more than people have seen
[59:22] throughout the ages.
[59:24] I mean to know of the life of the Lord
[59:26] Jesus and to know of the ministry even
[59:28] the ministry of brother Brandham and and
[59:30] these things we're so privileged
[59:33] to have seen so much and that in our
[59:35] midst has has walked the people whose
[59:39] eyes have seen feet being made and eyes
[59:42] being
[59:43] made and we get a little impatient
[59:47] sometimes because I've
[59:49] never seen some of these things in my
[59:52] own life
[59:54] yet. But if we just look at the example
[59:56] of Jesus life and we can see much of his
[59:58] life was a quiet time.
[1:00:01] I believe there are things going on
[1:00:03] there that we'll understand maybe
[1:00:06] later. But be patient.
[1:00:09] Just hold on. Don't get ahead of God.
[1:00:12] Abraham, he had a promise of God. He
[1:00:15] wasn't seeing it coming. And so he tried
[1:00:18] to force it. He tried to naturally he
[1:00:20] said, "Okay." Sarah said, "Take my
[1:00:22] handmaidaiden. Try to help God
[1:00:25] along." God doesn't need our help that
[1:00:27] way. God just needs us to hold to his
[1:00:30] promises.
[1:00:32] He'll bring it to pass in his own time,
[1:00:34] in his own way. He'll interpret it, too.
[1:00:37] It's okay if we don't understand
[1:00:38] everything right now. Right now, we can
[1:00:40] see through a glass
[1:00:42] darkly. We can say, "Lord, show me. Open
[1:00:45] it to
[1:00:47] me." But we don't have to understand. We
[1:00:49] just have to believe
[1:00:51] that there's this period of time that
[1:00:54] we're just
[1:00:56] showing the the
[1:00:59] the planting
[1:01:01] season and we will reap. And even in
[1:01:05] Jesus's life, the triumph of his
[1:01:08] life was right at the
[1:01:12] end. And and we think when we think of
[1:01:14] the death of Christ, we think of on the
[1:01:17] cross. That's what everybody
[1:01:19] saw was him lifted up. He said, "If I be
[1:01:21] lifted up, I'll draw all men to me." And
[1:01:24] everyone saw. But we know
[1:01:27] that when he actually laid down his
[1:01:30] life, when he actually died
[1:01:32] was before that in Gethsemane,
[1:01:36] right? So the greatest triumph of Jesus
[1:01:39] life when he triumphed over death, hell,
[1:01:42] and the grave. He took the the
[1:01:44] punishment for sin.
[1:01:47] But where that really happened, I mean,
[1:01:49] we know he was slain before the
[1:01:51] foundation of the
[1:01:53] world. But where he really died was in
[1:01:58] Gethsemane.
[1:02:00] Everybody left him. The disciples left
[1:02:02] him. He was all alone. The disciples
[1:02:04] were
[1:02:05] sleeping. And that's when he
[1:02:08] proved that he had the nature of
[1:02:11] Christ. Because the nature of Christ,
[1:02:14] the the true nature of Christ is the
[1:02:17] love of God.
[1:02:19] There's a lot of things that God shows
[1:02:21] in Christ.
[1:02:24] But what he's showing most of all is the
[1:02:26] love of
[1:02:27] God that he would lay down his life for
[1:02:30] us.
[1:02:32] That he would give himself a ransom for
[1:02:34] many. And in Christ, we see this. And
[1:02:37] and where he made that decision was in
[1:02:40] Gethsemane all by himself. and the
[1:02:42] triumphs in our life. I believe there's
[1:02:45] going to be miracles. I believe there's
[1:02:47] going to be things that the world sees.
[1:02:50] They're going to say, "That's a
[1:02:51] Christian. That's a follower of Christ.
[1:02:53] That that's a declaration of God."
[1:02:57] Well, we only get there if we go through
[1:02:58] Gethsemane.
[1:03:00] We only get there if there's a dying in
[1:03:03] our our private prayer closet.
[1:03:08] And what you are on the inside comes out
[1:03:10] when you're alone.
[1:03:12] That's how you see what somebody really
[1:03:14] is. And if you want to know what your
[1:03:16] character
[1:03:17] is, watch how you are when nobody's
[1:03:20] looking.
[1:03:22] And if you say, "Oh, I'm I'm ashamed of
[1:03:24] myself." Well, Lord, help us. Righteous
[1:03:28] man falls many times. He rises again.
[1:03:32] There's grace for that. There's mercy
[1:03:33] new every morning. And if the devil's
[1:03:36] caught you up in sin and he's made you
[1:03:38] ashamed, just bring it to the foot of
[1:03:40] the cross. Come, let us reason together.
[1:03:43] Though your sins were as scarlet, I'll
[1:03:44] make them white as snow.
[1:03:48] There's now no condemnation to them that
[1:03:50] are in Christ Jesus. Walk not after the
[1:03:53] flesh, but after the spirit.
[1:03:55] But don't hide from me. Don't just go on
[1:03:58] pretending like everything's okay and
[1:04:00] show up to church. We can all show up to
[1:04:01] church and lie to everybody and say
[1:04:04] everything's fine, but if in your heart
[1:04:06] you know there's things that you need
[1:04:08] the Lord to deal
[1:04:10] with, just bring them to Calvary. Bring
[1:04:13] them to the Lord. Say, "Lord, I can't do
[1:04:15] this. Lord, there's Goliath in my life.
[1:04:18] I need you to set me free from
[1:04:21] this." If we confess our sins, he's
[1:04:24] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[1:04:26] and to cleanse us from all
[1:04:28] unrighteousness.
[1:04:30] Not just to forgive us our sins. That
[1:04:32] would be good.
[1:04:34] Said if it said if we confess our sins,
[1:04:36] he'll forgive us. But it said he'd
[1:04:39] cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[1:04:42] If the son sets us free, we're free
[1:04:44] indeed.
[1:04:46] We don't have to live in bondage to
[1:04:48] these different things. You know, every
[1:04:51] gun in hell is trained on you. You're
[1:04:53] here. You're standing by faith. You're
[1:04:55] looking to the cross. Well, the devil
[1:04:57] doesn't like that.
[1:05:00] He's going to point every gun at you.
[1:05:02] He's going to try to take you down. But
[1:05:04] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:05:06] that's in the world. He's already
[1:05:07] overcome
[1:05:09] if we'll follow in his
[1:05:10] footsteps. Goes through Gethsemane.
[1:05:13] Those footsteps lead through Gethsemane.
[1:05:15] Those footsteps. They lead to the
[1:05:19] cross, but they also walk out of the
[1:05:21] grave.
[1:05:23] And I've got a lot of scriptures. I
[1:05:25] don't think we're we're going to get to
[1:05:26] all of them, but if we are partakers in
[1:05:30] his
[1:05:30] sufferings, if we share in his death,
[1:05:34] we'll also share in his resurrection.
[1:05:37] If we can be obedient like he was
[1:05:40] obedient to the death of the
[1:05:43] flesh, then we'll rise with him in
[1:05:45] newness of life. We'll rise here. We'll
[1:05:48] we'll do great things in this life, I
[1:05:51] believe.
[1:05:52] But we'll be with him.
[1:05:56] He's gone to prepare a place for us. And
[1:05:57] he said, "Eye has not seen, nor ear has
[1:05:59] heard, nor has it entered into the heart
[1:06:01] of man. What God has prepared for them
[1:06:04] that love him." Don't miss it, friend.
[1:06:07] It's for you. The devil will tell you,
[1:06:09] "No, it's for the others. It's not for
[1:06:11] you." He said, "Whosoever will." Amen.
[1:06:15] It's for you. If you'll take it, if
[1:06:18] you'll say, "That's for me." I believe
[1:06:19] it. It's yours.
[1:06:22] The spirit of God is brooding even now.
[1:06:25] I know he's here. I I know he's here.
[1:06:29] He's dealing with hearts.
[1:06:32] And if you'll just reach out in faith to
[1:06:34] him, he can change you tonight.
[1:06:38] You don't have to wait years and years
[1:06:41] and try to crawl up
[1:06:42] perfection. But our perfection is in
[1:06:46] Christ. and just a touch from him. If we
[1:06:49] can just reach out in faith and touch
[1:06:51] the hem of his garment, reach out and
[1:06:54] touch the Lord as he passes by. Find
[1:06:57] he's not too busy to hear your heart's
[1:07:01] cry. He's that brass serpent that was
[1:07:04] lifted up in the
[1:07:06] wilderness. That there was great
[1:07:08] sickness in the
[1:07:09] land. And those that looked on
[1:07:12] him looked, they were made whole. They
[1:07:16] were
[1:07:17] healed. Most of this isn't in my notes,
[1:07:19] but I believe the Lord knows where
[1:07:21] you're at and what you have need of.
[1:07:24] And every promise in the book is is ours
[1:07:27] if we'll take it. By these promises, we
[1:07:30] can be partakers of the divine nature.
[1:07:33] We can have that very nature of Christ.
[1:07:35] And in any
[1:07:37] situation, that life of Christ will be
[1:07:39] victorious.
[1:07:42] In your situation, the life of Christ
[1:07:44] will be victorious. And so you say,
[1:07:46] well, you don't know what I have to to
[1:07:47] go and face tomorrow. I'm behind on work
[1:07:50] and kids are, you know, all these
[1:07:54] things. The wife, the husband, whatever
[1:07:56] it
[1:07:58] is, in your
[1:08:00] shoes, the Lord Jesus Christ can
[1:08:02] overcome.
[1:08:04] He can help you to turn the other cheek.
[1:08:07] He can help you to give that soft answer
[1:08:09] that turns away wrath.
[1:08:11] He can help you to show to your loved
[1:08:13] ones it's time to get in the ark of
[1:08:15] safety. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:20] He's still in the fire and he's walking
[1:08:22] in the flames. Amen. Though it's getting
[1:08:23] hot all around us, the devil says, "Oh,
[1:08:26] they're about to cook. They're about to
[1:08:28] pop like popcorn."
[1:08:31] But no, the Lord's with us. He said he'd
[1:08:35] never leave us nor forsake us. Be with
[1:08:38] us, even in us till the end. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:41] It's getting hot.
[1:08:43] But inside of us, what he's put inside
[1:08:45] of
[1:08:46] us is the incorruptible seed.
[1:08:50] And heaven and earth will pass away.
[1:08:53] Everything you see here is temporal.
[1:08:54] It's all made of atoms. It's all
[1:08:55] chemistry stuff. It's all going to be
[1:08:58] gone.
[1:09:00] But the word of God
[1:09:02] is eternal. It's forever. and that
[1:09:05] incorruptible seed that's inside of you,
[1:09:08] nothing can crush it, nothing can pop
[1:09:10] it, nothing can take it away.
[1:09:14] That's yours to keep.
[1:09:16] So, don't be
[1:09:17] discouraged. Don't get all down and
[1:09:20] disheartened.
[1:09:23] I love this scripture. It's in I think
[1:09:25] it's Isaiah 42.
[1:09:36] talking about this man Christ
[1:09:40] Jesus says, "Behold my servant whom I
[1:09:45] uphold." And as as we read these words,
[1:09:47] think of the Lord
[1:09:49] Jesus. But then if you're one that's led
[1:09:51] of the spirit of God, if you're a son,
[1:09:54] you're a daughter of God, realize that
[1:09:57] you're in here, too. Yes. And when it
[1:10:00] talks about the nature of Christ, and
[1:10:02] when it talks about all the different
[1:10:04] things of Christ, if you are Christ's,
[1:10:07] you can be identified in these
[1:10:08] scriptures, too. So when it says,
[1:10:11] "Behold my servant whom I uphold." We
[1:10:14] know that's talking about the Lord
[1:10:16] Jesus. But if you're his servant, if
[1:10:18] you're the one that cleans the toilets
[1:10:20] here,
[1:10:22] he'll hold you up.
[1:10:25] He doesn't hold up one and hold the
[1:10:26] other. God's no respector of persons.
[1:10:29] That's right. But he respects faith. He
[1:10:32] respects the one that'll take hold of
[1:10:33] the promises of God, not let go. Behold,
[1:10:36] my servant whom I uphold my elect, in
[1:10:39] whom my soul delightth. You know the
[1:10:42] Lord delights in
[1:10:43] you. That you're the apple of his
[1:10:46] eye. That he loves you.
[1:10:49] Don't let the devil take that away from
[1:10:51] you. Say, "No, you've gone too far.
[1:10:53] You've sinned too much." When God looks
[1:10:55] at you through the blood of Christ, he
[1:10:58] sees the perfection of Christ. And
[1:11:00] though we feel so unworthy, so
[1:11:04] dirty, in Christ, we are the one whose
[1:11:09] God's soul
[1:11:11] delights. I have put my spirit upon him.
[1:11:15] He shall bring forth judgment to the
[1:11:18] Gentiles.
[1:11:20] He shall not cry nor lift up nor cause
[1:11:23] his voice to be heard in the street.
[1:11:26] Have you seen that nature in a
[1:11:29] Christian? There a lot of people in the
[1:11:32] world, they do something nice. They got
[1:11:33] to go and boast and make it known and
[1:11:35] post it everywhere.
[1:11:38] But I was thinking, I know a lot of
[1:11:41] people. I've been privileged to know a
[1:11:44] lot of people that when they do good
[1:11:46] things, the right hand doesn't know what
[1:11:48] the left hand's doing.
[1:11:50] They're declaring the father.
[1:11:53] Even though they're carrying around a
[1:11:55] dead man,
[1:11:57] even though they're born in sin, they're
[1:11:58] not virgin born people.
[1:12:02] But they're being changed by this word.
[1:12:04] Amen. That they're coming, they're
[1:12:05] conforming into this image of the
[1:12:07] father.
[1:12:09] They're not loud and boastful, but they
[1:12:12] do good quietly, and the Lord sees
[1:12:15] them. Now, here's where we're going. A
[1:12:17] bruised reed shall he not break, and the
[1:12:21] smoking flax shall not quench
[1:12:24] quench. He shall bring forth judgment
[1:12:27] unto truth.
[1:12:30] He shall not fail nor be discouraged
[1:12:34] till he have set judgment in the earth
[1:12:37] and the aisles shall wait for his
[1:12:41] law. It says talking about Christ, he
[1:12:44] won't fail and he won't even be
[1:12:46] discouraged.
[1:12:48] Amen.
[1:12:50] So we take discouragement as
[1:12:52] inevitable that you get to get to se get
[1:12:55] to Sunday or get to Wednesday you get
[1:12:57] your courage all charged up then Monday
[1:13:00] Thursday come along and boy I'm
[1:13:03] discouraged where has my courage
[1:13:05] gone I was ready for the devil and then
[1:13:09] everybody has a plan until they get
[1:13:11] punched in the face. Is that what the
[1:13:12] quote
[1:13:14] is? But though on the outside we can get
[1:13:17] discouraged. We can look around say,
[1:13:20] "Oh, how is this going to work? How's
[1:13:23] God going to do it?" But on the inside,
[1:13:27] that incorruptible seed doesn't even get
[1:13:29] discouraged. It's that anchor that
[1:13:31] holds. No matter what's going on, things
[1:13:34] go up and down and this way and that way
[1:13:36] and everything's going sideways and
[1:13:38] winds of doctrine and unbelievers and
[1:13:40] hypocrites
[1:13:43] and inside of your
[1:13:45] soul. It's not even
[1:13:48] discouraged. It's not even shooken.
[1:13:52] Amen.
[1:13:55] You just got to look to the Lord Jesus.
[1:13:58] Don't get caught up with the outside.
[1:14:00] Just stay anchored in Christ. He'll
[1:14:03] carry you
[1:14:05] through. Amen. He is good. See if I can
[1:14:09] get back on my notes anywhere.
[1:14:13] But do you love the Lord Jesus?
[1:14:16] Amen.
[1:14:28] So Jesus finally came. He's finally on
[1:14:31] the earth. The
[1:14:33] disciples, you know, they lived through
[1:14:35] the the quiet times, but then he came
[1:14:37] and
[1:14:38] ministered. He died. He rose
[1:14:42] again. Now, if you're the
[1:14:44] disciples, now is the time. It's going
[1:14:46] to get good,
[1:14:48] right? He conquered sin, death, hell,
[1:14:50] and the grave. He's here. He's perfect.
[1:14:54] He's
[1:14:56] sinless. But he told them, "I'm going
[1:15:01] away." What? We've been waiting so
[1:15:05] long. We've been waiting and waiting.
[1:15:08] You going to leave
[1:15:13] us? But in in the time when the father
[1:15:16] goes away, that's when you see if the
[1:15:19] son is really a true son. That's when
[1:15:21] you really see the attributes of a son.
[1:15:23] Just like I was talking about who you
[1:15:25] are when you're alone. Well, that's what
[1:15:27] Christ did to the disciples. He trained
[1:15:29] them
[1:15:30] up and he leaves them.
[1:15:34] But what he put inside
[1:15:37] them was able to overcome
[1:15:41] to change the world.
[1:15:44] And we see this pattern all through the
[1:15:46] Bible that you've got Moses and Joshua.
[1:15:47] if Moses could just stay around and help
[1:15:49] us set up the the promised land. But
[1:15:53] Moses is gone. It's on Joshua and he's
[1:15:55] shaken. He has to be told time and
[1:15:57] again, "Fear not. Fear
[1:16:00] not." We see the Hebrew children. It'd
[1:16:03] be nice if the Hebrew children had their
[1:16:05] rabbis and their parents and and the
[1:16:07] committee and and the church with them.
[1:16:09] They're all alone.
[1:16:14] And even, you know, in this last day,
[1:16:17] brother Brandon, it would be nice if he
[1:16:19] could have been an old man on a porch.
[1:16:20] We could go and ask him all these
[1:16:21] things. The Lord did what he needed to
[1:16:23] do and he takes him off the scene.
[1:16:27] And a lot of times in our lives, we see,
[1:16:29] we want to look to man to be able to put
[1:16:32] our confidence in man.
[1:16:35] That's not God's way of doing things.
[1:16:38] He'll use man to preach to you, to show
[1:16:41] God to you, to reveal the person of
[1:16:44] Jesus Christ to you. And then one way or
[1:16:46] another, by death or by discouragement
[1:16:48] or this or that, a lot of times he'll
[1:16:50] take that influence away.
[1:16:53] That you can fix your eyes on Jesus.
[1:16:56] And any man of God, they don't point to
[1:16:59] themselves, but they point you to the
[1:17:00] cross. They make sure that you've met
[1:17:02] the Lord Jesus. And that once you and
[1:17:05] the Lord Jesus have met, there's no
[1:17:09] mediator in between. There's no
[1:17:10] intercessor. There's one. Christ Jesus
[1:17:13] is between God and man. And there's no
[1:17:16] other man in the relationship there.
[1:17:19] But it's you and God. And it's those
[1:17:21] times in your prayer closets, and the
[1:17:23] trials of your life, in the Gethsemane
[1:17:25] that you go through,
[1:17:28] that's when your faith is proved.
[1:17:32] But what he's put in you, that
[1:17:35] incorruptible seed, when you've received
[1:17:37] his
[1:17:40] word, it'll do the same thing in you
[1:17:42] that it did in the Lord
[1:17:44] Jesus. And though he cried, though drops
[1:17:46] of blood were
[1:17:48] coming, his flesh wanted to
[1:17:53] run, but he said, "Not my
[1:17:55] will, thine be done."
[1:17:59] And in our in our own lives, though we
[1:18:01] say, "No way. I quit. I I give up." Then
[1:18:04] there's a still small voice that says,
[1:18:06] "Father,
[1:18:08] glorify thy name.
[1:18:11] I didn't come here for my own
[1:18:13] edification or glory. I came to do your
[1:18:16] will. Whatever that
[1:18:19] is, whatever you want to show the world
[1:18:21] in my life, Father, glorify your name."
[1:18:27] Amen. Jesus said, "He that believes on
[1:18:31] me, out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:18:34] of living
[1:18:36] water." That Jesus is the water of life,
[1:18:40] the everpresent water from the rock. Now
[1:18:44] that's in you.
[1:18:46] He's the light of the world. You're the
[1:18:48] light of the world. He's the bread from
[1:18:50] heaven. Well, the bread was broken and
[1:18:53] multiplied.
[1:18:55] Amen. that man is every day. So now when
[1:18:59] somebody needs to see Jesus in the
[1:19:01] flesh, they can't just go over to
[1:19:03] Palestine and go over to the Holy Land.
[1:19:07] I guess got to be careful what I call it
[1:19:09] over there. It's very political
[1:19:10] nomenclature now. Go over to Israel
[1:19:12] there.
[1:19:15] Now if they want to see Jesus in the
[1:19:17] flesh,
[1:19:20] the Lord will bring them by your way.
[1:19:24] If they want to get a love letter from
[1:19:26] the Lord Jesus, they don't get a letter
[1:19:27] from Paul
[1:19:29] necessarily, but they they have you show
[1:19:31] up.
[1:19:34] That your written epistles read of all
[1:19:35] men. You're the light of the world.
[1:19:38] You're the one that God has put on a
[1:19:41] hill that everyone can see you.
[1:19:44] And we're fools for Christ. We show, you
[1:19:48] know, we go and try to do something good
[1:19:50] and we trip over ourselves.
[1:19:52] That's part of it. The Lord didn't say
[1:19:55] that our flesh would glory in his
[1:19:56] presence. He said the opposite. He said
[1:19:59] no flesh would glory in his presence.
[1:20:01] But even so, where do you want me, Lord?
[1:20:04] Where can I do? What else is there to
[1:20:06] live for?
[1:20:07] What else is there to
[1:20:10] do but what we've received to give it
[1:20:13] freely? What we've been told in the
[1:20:16] private to go tell it to the world, to
[1:20:18] go demonstrate it.
[1:20:23] Jesus is the firstborn among many
[1:20:26] brethren. He's bringing many sons to
[1:20:29] glory. He's given unto us the ministry
[1:20:32] of
[1:20:33] reconciliation. That the life you give,
[1:20:35] the ministry that you
[1:20:37] have, maybe it's never behind a pulpit,
[1:20:40] but you have a ministry. If you're part
[1:20:42] of
[1:20:43] Christ, he's a minister.
[1:20:46] And so, if you're part of him, you have
[1:20:48] a ministry. And what that ministry is is
[1:20:50] not a ministry of
[1:20:52] condemnation. Okay, I'm part of Christ
[1:20:54] and I get to go and where's those
[1:20:56] Pharisees at? I'm going to go and tell
[1:20:58] them they're wrong. That's a small part
[1:21:00] of
[1:21:02] it. But the ministry of Christ is the
[1:21:04] ministry of reconciliation. And our
[1:21:06] hearts, our lives ought to scream, "Be
[1:21:09] reconciled to God.
[1:21:12] Come to Jesus.
[1:21:14] Come and receive of his spirit. Oh,
[1:21:17] taste and see that the Lord is good.
[1:21:20] He doesn't withhold any good thing from
[1:21:22] his own. Amen. That's what he's speaking
[1:21:27] in our lives. That's what we're
[1:21:29] declaring in our lives. And sometimes
[1:21:32] we're just putting brick on top of
[1:21:34] brick. What are you doing? I'm I'm just
[1:21:38] laying
[1:21:40] brick. But together, we're building a
[1:21:42] holy habitation.
[1:21:44] We're building a living temple. You're
[1:21:46] living stones
[1:21:48] that not one of us has everything
[1:21:52] uh that the world
[1:21:53] needs, but together we are the body of
[1:21:57] Christ.
[1:21:59] We're his hands and his feet. We can
[1:22:02] minister in in a way that he he didn't
[1:22:06] have a ministry when he was here. He
[1:22:08] said, "The works that I do shall you do
[1:22:10] also, greater than these shall you do."
[1:22:14] We know that's more
[1:22:17] that we have the same heart, we
[1:22:18] demonstrate the same life, but now
[1:22:22] there's not the Holy Ghost in in one
[1:22:24] body, but there's the Holy Ghost here
[1:22:27] and there
[1:22:28] and all throughout the world. God is
[1:22:32] moving by his spirit, moving throughout
[1:22:33] all the earth. Move, O Lord, and me.
[1:22:37] Amen.
[1:22:40] We're ambassadors for Christ.
[1:22:44] He said, "These signs shall follow them
[1:22:46] that believe."
[1:22:48] See, there's a tendency to try to to
[1:22:50] water down Christianity and and make it
[1:22:53] lukewarm, but don't give an inch up. You
[1:22:57] hold on to every promise of God in my
[1:23:00] name. They shall cast out devils. That's
[1:23:03] yours. If you need that, that's yours.
[1:23:06] If if you go out of here and you meet
[1:23:08] the
[1:23:09] devil, say, "Oh, that'll never happen."
[1:23:12] There's a lot of devils out there. Be
[1:23:15] ready. But if you go out of here and you
[1:23:17] meet the devil in my name, they shall
[1:23:19] cast out devils. Who? They that believe.
[1:23:22] Is that anybody like that here?
[1:23:25] Demons tremble.
[1:23:27] When the weakest sinner falls to their
[1:23:30] knees, we have the power in the name of
[1:23:32] Jesus. They shall speak with new
[1:23:34] tongues. I believe that
[1:23:37] that's still for us. They shall take up
[1:23:40] serpents. If they drink any deadly
[1:23:42] thing, it shall not harm them, hurt
[1:23:44] them, they shall lay hands on the sick,
[1:23:47] and they shall recover.
[1:23:51] So after the Lord had spoken unto them,
[1:23:53] he was received up on heaven and sat
[1:23:54] down in the right hand of God, and they
[1:23:56] went forth and they preached
[1:23:58] everywhere. That's what we're going to
[1:24:00] do. Okay? When we leave here, we're
[1:24:02] going to go and get some sleep, maybe
[1:24:05] some
[1:24:06] burritos.
[1:24:08] Um we're going to go preaching. We're
[1:24:11] going to go proclaiming the good news
[1:24:14] everywhere. The Lord working with them.
[1:24:17] It's not just us. He didn't just say,
[1:24:19] "Okay, disciples, go on." But he said,
[1:24:21] "I'll send you the comfort. I'll be with
[1:24:23] you even in you." He's working with us.
[1:24:26] We can't do anything without him.
[1:24:29] If we're not abiding in him, if we're
[1:24:31] not drawing strength from the vine,
[1:24:34] though we be children of God, without
[1:24:37] him, we can do nothing. Yes, sir. We've
[1:24:41] got to be in him.
[1:24:43] But he when they did that, when they
[1:24:45] preached everywhere, the Lord worked
[1:24:47] with them. Says, "And confirming the
[1:24:50] word with signs
[1:24:52] following." If this is the word of God,
[1:24:55] and if we'll just take it, we won't mix
[1:24:57] man's ideas into it, but we'll just take
[1:24:59] it. Say, "Yes, Lord, be it unto me
[1:25:02] according to your word." He will confirm
[1:25:05] it in his own way, in his own time. Yes.
[1:25:09] He'll bring it to pass.
[1:25:12] Whoop the devil with it.
[1:25:14] Amen.
[1:25:19] But we've got
[1:25:20] to not just go and say, "Okay, I think,
[1:25:23] you know, read a couple scriptures.
[1:25:24] Okay, I think I'm one of the sons of
[1:25:31] God." But what we do has to be according
[1:25:34] to this book. It has to be in line with
[1:25:37] this word. And our lives have to be in
[1:25:40] line with the life of Jesus Christ. If
[1:25:43] we say, "Okay, I've
[1:25:45] received. I'm led of the spirit. I've
[1:25:47] received." And then we go out and our
[1:25:50] life is not like his life. Something's
[1:25:51] wrong. We've missed it somewhere.
[1:25:55] But if we look at the attitude of Jesus
[1:25:58] Christ, the way that he was, he was the
[1:26:00] Lord, the perfect
[1:26:03] one. And he said, "The Son can do
[1:26:05] nothing in
[1:26:06] himself." But what he sees the father
[1:26:09] do, he wasn't puffed up. He wasn't
[1:26:11] proud. He wasn't
[1:26:14] showy. He said,
[1:26:19] "Father, whatever I see you do, that's
[1:26:22] what I'm going to do." That's how we got
[1:26:24] to be.
[1:26:26] He didn't even
[1:26:27] speak his own. He said, "I do nothing of
[1:26:30] myself, but as the Father hath taught
[1:26:32] me, I speak these
[1:26:35] things. Not my will, but thine be done."
[1:26:38] We've got to come to that same
[1:26:42] place. And he was perfect. He was born
[1:26:44] without sin. But now the Lord's going to
[1:26:47] do what he did in Christ in us, though
[1:26:50] we're born in sin.
[1:26:54] Isn't that amazing?
[1:26:57] Do you believe he can do it in you?
[1:27:04] Amen. We've got to speak good
[1:27:07] things. If we want to speak the word of
[1:27:11] God, don't speak the bad things. A
[1:27:14] fountain doesn't bring forth salt water
[1:27:16] and fresh.
[1:27:18] Don't get caught up in this trap of
[1:27:20] speaking the devil's language, but just
[1:27:22] let your confession be positive. Yay and
[1:27:24] amen.
[1:27:31] Amen. We've got this hidden behind
[1:27:34] badger skins in our in our flesh.
[1:27:39] But let's let's read uh I've
[1:27:42] been let's uh let's bring this to a
[1:27:45] close and let's read 2 Corinthians
[1:27:48] chapter
[1:27:50] 4 and we'll read starting from verse
[1:27:58] 7 Corinthians 4 and verse 7 says but we
[1:28:02] have this treasure is it a treasure to
[1:28:05] you is the word of God is the Holy Ghost
[1:28:09] a treasure to you. The world doesn't
[1:28:11] think anything of
[1:28:12] it. But we've seen the pearl of great
[1:28:16] price. You've got to sell everything to
[1:28:18] get it. Treasure. We have this treasure
[1:28:21] in earth and vessels that the excellency
[1:28:24] of the power may be of God and not of
[1:28:27] us. We are troubled on every
[1:28:31] side. You ever feel like that? It's all
[1:28:34] around me. Well, that makes aiming easy.
[1:28:37] You just hold the
[1:28:39] trigger. We're troubled on every side,
[1:28:41] yet not distressed. We are
[1:28:45] perplexed. Some of us live that one, but
[1:28:48] not in
[1:28:49] despair. Persecuted, but not forsaken.
[1:28:52] Cast down, but not
[1:28:55] destroyed. You cannot be lost.
[1:28:59] always bearing about in the body the
[1:29:01] dying of the Lord
[1:29:03] Jesus, that the life also of Christ
[1:29:05] might be made manifest in our body.
[1:29:10] Amen. For we which live are always
[1:29:13] delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,
[1:29:16] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:29:18] made manifest in our mortal
[1:29:20] flesh, that this flesh can declare God.
[1:29:26] So then death workketh in us, but life
[1:29:27] in you. We having the same spirit of
[1:29:30] faith, according as it is written, I
[1:29:33] believed, and therefore have I spoken.
[1:29:36] We also believe and therefore speak,
[1:29:38] knowing that he which raised up the Lord
[1:29:41] Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus,
[1:29:46] and shall present us with you.
[1:29:48] For all things are for your
[1:29:50] sakes, and that the abundant grace might
[1:29:53] through the thanksgiving of many redown
[1:29:55] to the glory of
[1:29:56] God. For this cause we faint
[1:29:59] not, though our outward man
[1:30:03] perish, yet the inward man is renewed
[1:30:05] day by
[1:30:06] day. For our light affliction, which is
[1:30:09] but for a moment, workketh for us a far
[1:30:12] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[1:30:14] glory.
[1:30:15] While we look not at the things which
[1:30:17] are seen, but at the things which are
[1:30:19] not
[1:30:20] seen. For the things which are seen are
[1:30:23] temporal, for the things which are not
[1:30:25] seen are eternal.
[1:30:29] Amen. Don't be
[1:30:31] weary if you don't see it
[1:30:39] yet. As we've borne the image of the
[1:30:43] earthly, we shall also bear the image of
[1:30:46] the
[1:30:52] heavenly. And what we'll see
[1:30:55] is a lot of times we we look at these
[1:30:58] things about declaring the father and we
[1:31:00] look at it all about
[1:31:01] us. We say, "Okay, I've got to do this
[1:31:04] and I want to declare the father."
[1:31:07] And Jesus was not that
[1:31:10] way. He wasn't looking at himself. He
[1:31:13] was looking at
[1:31:14] God and he was looking at the ones he
[1:31:17] loved.
[1:31:19] He said, "I do this for their sakes." He
[1:31:21] said, "He sanctified himself for their
[1:31:23] sakes, for our sakes."
[1:31:25] Said that they may be with me where I
[1:31:28] am. And if you'll follow in the
[1:31:31] footsteps of
[1:31:33] Christ, if you lay your life
[1:31:36] down, you will see the word of God
[1:31:40] change the people around you.
[1:31:44] And
[1:31:45] I I've got loved ones that I I want to
[1:31:50] know the Lord. I want them to see
[1:31:55] Jesus. And if me yielding to the spirit
[1:31:58] of God will give them a glimpse of
[1:32:01] Jesus, it'll all be worth
[1:32:03] it. That that was the spirit of that was
[1:32:06] in Christ that he was always laying down
[1:32:07] his life for his friends. Greater love
[1:32:10] has no man than this. And that he lays
[1:32:12] down his life for for his
[1:32:15] friends. That was in Christ. That love
[1:32:18] of
[1:32:19] God. and then passed it on to Peter.
[1:32:24] Said, "If you love me, feed my sheep."
[1:32:27] And Peter, he he had the Holy Ghost
[1:32:30] right at the beginning of Acts. He could
[1:32:31] have gone and got on a cruise boat
[1:32:34] somewhere and just hung out for a while,
[1:32:37] but the rest of his life, it
[1:32:39] was the life of Jesus.
[1:32:42] Same with Paul. Same with all the
[1:32:44] apostles. They could have just gone and
[1:32:46] worked on their
[1:32:49] 401k, but no, they were whipped. They
[1:32:51] were scored. They were beaten. They were
[1:32:53] driven about. Their lives were
[1:32:56] terrible by our
[1:33:00] estimations. But if they're planted in
[1:33:03] that, if they're planted in the death of
[1:33:05] Christ,
[1:33:07] they'll rise in the resurrection of
[1:33:09] Christ.
[1:33:13] Amen.
[1:33:15] For if we've been planted together in
[1:33:16] the likeness of his death, we shall be
[1:33:19] also in the likeness of his
[1:33:20] resurrection.
[1:33:22] If ye through the spirit do mortify the
[1:33:24] deeds of the body, ye shall
[1:33:27] live.
[1:33:29] Amen. Maybe the musicians would would
[1:33:32] come. Let let's just stand and
[1:33:38] pray. If you have a need, just lift it
[1:33:41] up by faith to the Lord. He's here. I
[1:33:44] know he's here in his word. He's here in
[1:33:45] his people. And he knows what you have
[1:33:48] need
[1:33:49] of. And maybe you came in a little
[1:33:51] discouraged in the flesh. But I hope
[1:33:54] you've seen that in your spirit, you
[1:33:56] don't have to be discouraged in your
[1:33:59] soul. That there is an anchor that
[1:34:01] holds.
[1:34:03] So while we're in this atmosphere of
[1:34:05] faith, while we're with Christians,
[1:34:07] while there's angels all around
[1:34:09] here, just reach out to the Lord.
[1:34:13] And if you need forgiveness, if you need
[1:34:15] healing, whatever you have need of,
[1:34:17] just don't rush to go go away here. But
[1:34:21] there this is a special time.
[1:34:25] There's no time like the present. And
[1:34:26] none of us is guaranteed tomorrow. We
[1:34:28] could go from here and be
[1:34:31] gone. But now, while the Lord is here,
[1:34:34] if you need something from
[1:34:35] him, just reach out and and touch him by
[1:34:38] faith.
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:34:42] If you've never been born
[1:34:45] again, you can be born again
[1:34:48] today. If you never believed on him with
[1:34:51] all your heart, you can believe on him
[1:34:53] with all your heart
[1:34:55] today. He loves
[1:34:58] you. He's calling you. Come, my son, my
[1:35:03] daughter. I know you. I made you. I
[1:35:06] formed you for a purpose. Your life is
[1:35:09] to de declare my
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:14] glory. Hear his words speaking to you.
[1:35:17] He gave himself for
[1:35:20] you. He loves you. Let's all
[1:35:24] pray. Lord Jesus, we believe your
[1:35:28] word. And still, Lord, help our
[1:35:30] unbelief.
[1:35:35] Father, we don't even know how to pray,
[1:35:37] but your spirit makes intercession for
[1:35:39] us, Lord, with groanings that can't be
[1:35:41] uttered. And we don't even have to have
[1:35:42] the right words. But Lord, if we can
[1:35:44] call out to you from our
[1:35:48] soul, know that you can come
[1:35:51] and touch us,
[1:35:54] Lord. Open our eyes,
[1:35:58] Father. Purify our hearts, Lord. We know
[1:36:00] that we can't even see your kingdom
[1:36:02] except be born again.
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:07] Father, the hour is late and you're
[1:36:08] coming soon. And
[1:36:11] Lord, we don't want to be left
[1:36:13] here. We don't want to partake in the
[1:36:16] judgment that's going to be poured out
[1:36:17] on this earth, Lord. But we want to be
[1:36:20] hidden in you,
[1:36:21] Lord. We want to trust and rest under
[1:36:24] the shadow of your wings,
[1:36:29] Lord. Father, we thank you. Please bless
[1:36:32] everyone here, Lord. those that couldn't
[1:36:34] make it, those that wanted to be here,
[1:36:36] Lord. Your arms not short that you can't
[1:36:39] say. You can reach each one of us, Lord.
[1:36:43] And I don't pray as being anything or
[1:36:46] above anyone, Lord. Help me. Help my
[1:36:48] family,
[1:36:50] Lord. Help us to be sincere, Lord. Help
[1:36:54] us to do nothing but what we see you
[1:36:56] doing, Lord. Help us to speak nothing
[1:36:58] but what we know you would speak through
[1:37:01] us, Lord.
[1:37:03] Help us to be so in love with your word,
[1:37:05] Lord, that everything else would fall
[1:37:07] away. That the cares of this life that
[1:37:08] would choke that life out of us, Lord,
[1:37:11] that we could surrender them to you,
[1:37:18] Lord. You're the chain breaker, Lord.
[1:37:21] You set the captive
[1:37:22] free. You heal the sick, Lord. You raise
[1:37:25] the dead. You're the same yesterday,
[1:37:29] today, and forever, Lord. And we believe
[1:37:31] in you.
[1:37:33] Lord, we receive your spirit now in the
[1:37:35] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:37] Christ. Father, we worship you and Lord,
[1:37:40] we believe that every promise in this
[1:37:42] book is
[1:37:44] true. Lord, be it unto us according to
[1:37:47] your word. Glorify your name, Lord.
[1:37:50] Though it be to our embarrassment, Lord,
[1:37:52] to our
[1:37:54] shame, be lifted up,
[1:37:57] Lord. Draw your own to you, Father.
[1:38:01] Let our lives
[1:38:02] declare your image, Father. Let us be
[1:38:06] true to your word that we wouldn't go
[1:38:07] and make false images, false Christ. But
[1:38:10] Lord, let it be line upon line and
[1:38:12] precept upon precept. Lord, come and
[1:38:14] confirm it with signs
[1:38:17] following. Lord, we love you. Thank you,
[1:38:19] Father
[1:38:21] God. Bless your name in Jesus name.
[1:38:26] Amen. Amen. God bless you all. It's been
[1:38:29] a real p privilege and pleasure to be
[1:38:30] with you. I'm going to turn it over to
[1:38:32] brother Michael and sing all to Jesus.
[1:38:38] All to
[1:38:41] Jesus
[1:38:43] I
[1:38:46] surrender
[1:38:48] all to him.
[1:38:51] I
[1:38:54] freely
[1:38:56] give.
[1:38:58] I will
[1:39:01] ever
[1:39:03] love and
[1:39:05] trust him
[1:39:08] in his
[1:39:12] presence daily.
[1:39:27] Oh,
[1:39:29] I
[1:39:31] surrender to God.
[1:39:39] All to thee my
[1:39:45] blessed
[1:39:48] Savior
[1:39:50] I
[1:39:53] sder
[1:39:57] all oh and
[1:40:00] all to
[1:40:03] Jesus
[1:40:05] I surrender.
[1:40:08] Tender
[1:40:10] humbly
[1:40:12] at his
[1:40:15] feet. I
[1:40:18] bow. Those
[1:40:21] worldly
[1:40:23] pleasures
[1:40:25] all
[1:40:29] forsaken.
[1:40:30] Take me Jesus.
[1:40:35] Take me
[1:40:38] now. Oh,
[1:40:41] I
