[0:01] while you're standing i'd like to read
[0:02] from genesis chapter 22
[0:04] and that's verses 1 to 14
[0:08] genesis 2 22 verses 1 to 14.
[0:13] welcome everyone to the house of lord
[0:14] this evening it's nice to see
[0:17] each one of you with us genesis chapter
[0:20] 2
[0:22] verses 1 to 14.
[0:26] i'm just going to begin reading so that
[0:27] we can
[0:29] stay very focused on the subject today
[0:32] the lord has really
[0:34] dealt with my heart in a very strong way
[0:35] so i just feel very very moved
[0:38] grateful for the presence of the lord
[0:39] that's with us that gives us this
[0:40] liberty
[0:41] to jump right into these things and it
[0:44] came to pass so this is genesis chapter
[0:46] 22.
[0:47] we'll start with verse 1 and read the
[0:48] verse 14. and it came to pass
[0:50] after these things that god did tempt
[0:53] abraham
[0:54] and said unto him abraham and he said
[0:56] behold here i am
[0:58] and he said take now thy son thy only
[1:00] son isaac whom thou lovest
[1:03] and get thee into the land of moriah and
[1:05] offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:07] upon one of the mountains which i will
[1:09] tell thee of
[1:10] and abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:12] and saddled his ass and took two of his
[1:14] young men with him
[1:15] and isaac his son and claimed the wood
[1:17] for the burnt offering and rose up
[1:19] went unto the place of which god had
[1:22] told him
[1:23] then on the third day abraham lifted up
[1:25] his eyes and saw the place afar
[1:27] off and abraham said to his young men
[1:30] abide ye here with the ass
[1:32] and i and the lad will go yonder and
[1:33] worship and come again to you
[1:36] and abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:38] offering and laid it upon
[1:39] isaac his son he took the fire in his
[1:42] hand and a knife and they went both of
[1:44] them
[1:44] together and isaac spake unto abraham
[1:47] his father and said my father
[1:48] he said here am i my son and he said
[1:51] behold the fire
[1:52] and the wood but where is the lamb for
[1:55] burnt offering
[1:57] abraham said my son god will provide
[2:00] himself a lamb for burnt offering so
[2:03] they went both of them
[2:04] together they came to the place which
[2:06] god had told him of and abraham built an
[2:09] altar there and laid the wood in order
[2:10] and bound
[2:11] isaac his son and laid him on the altar
[2:13] upon the wood and
[2:14] abraham stretched forth his hand and
[2:16] took the knife to slay his son
[2:18] and the angel lord called unto him out
[2:20] of heaven and said abraham abraham
[2:22] he said here am i and he said lay not
[2:25] thy hand upon the lad
[2:27] neither do thou anything unto him for
[2:29] now i know that thou fearest god
[2:31] seeing thou hast not withheld thy son
[2:33] thine only son from me
[2:35] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[2:37] looked and behold behind him a ram
[2:39] caught in a thicket by his horns
[2:41] and abraham went and took the ram and
[2:43] offered him up for a burnt offering
[2:45] in the stead of his son and abraham
[2:47] called the name of that place
[2:49] jehovah jireh as it is said to this day
[2:53] the mount of the lord it shall be seen
[2:56] it may be seated
[3:00] we're continuing on the subject of what
[3:02] does wisdom look like
[3:04] and tonight i'd like to take for
[3:07] a subject with respect to
[3:10] what wisdom looks like and use the term
[3:13] confident
[3:14] that wisdom looks confident and we've
[3:18] looked at the meekness of christ through
[3:20] a few services and how that
[3:22] christ the word is the ultimate and the
[3:25] treasure of all wisdom the treasure of
[3:27] all knowledge
[3:28] and how the meekness of christ is an
[3:31] expression of the word
[3:33] and how that wisdom itself is
[3:35] inseparable from
[3:37] meekness that the real wisdom from above
[3:39] demonstrates itself with meekness
[3:41] regardless of how
[3:43] what it portrays and what it stands for
[3:45] it has a meekness to it
[3:47] and we even looked at how christ who
[3:51] is the manifestation of the heart of god
[3:53] and the treasure of all wisdom and
[3:54] knowledge
[3:55] he overcame and he accomplished the will
[3:57] of gone through
[3:58] the word and humility and so
[4:01] what does wisdom look like i want to
[4:03] take this word confident
[4:05] and really begin to examine this very
[4:07] closely
[4:08] uh to give us another another way to
[4:12] measure ourselves whether or not we're
[4:13] abiding in the wisdom of god
[4:16] now i'd like to define confident here in
[4:18] the outset confident means fully assured
[4:20] so this speaks to us
[4:22] that wisdom looks like it's confident it
[4:25] is confident and so this would be the
[4:27] impact or the effect that wisdom has
[4:29] upon us
[4:30] we are fully assured if you're confident
[4:33] you have
[4:33] strong belief if one is confident
[4:37] they're firmly trusting
[4:38] and these are the words that are
[4:39] associated with and which should be
[4:41] conjured up in our hearts as we begin to
[4:43] ponder
[4:44] being confident and having confidence
[4:46] you means you're firmly trusting and
[4:48] that
[4:48] you're relying on something and that
[4:50] you're bold and even daring and these
[4:52] are some of the things that
[4:53] are part of the rich meaning of the word
[4:56] confident
[4:57] and the the root of it it's a
[5:00] combination of a prefix of calm which is
[5:02] confident and that fadir is the
[5:06] uh is the word that's conjugated to
[5:08] fident fadir means to trust
[5:10] to confide or to persuade i was really
[5:14] just
[5:14] struck by this word when we think
[5:16] confident it's with something with this
[5:18] trust with this
[5:19] to confider to be persuaded of and it
[5:21] comes from a root
[5:23] that means to force to advise or to
[5:26] encourage
[5:27] and this so this greek root this
[5:29] indo-european root that it forms
[5:32] uh that it's from it actually is the
[5:34] word that's used for abide or abode
[5:36] so if you're confiding if you have
[5:38] confidence if you're persuaded if you
[5:40] have a strong belief
[5:42] if you're fully assured then it's a it
[5:44] means you have a source of trust it's a
[5:46] you have faith and you have reliance and
[5:49] if you think of an abode or a place that
[5:51] one would abide it's
[5:52] creating this picture that when one is
[5:54] confident they appear strong
[5:56] that when one is confident it's mighty
[5:58] and it's powerful
[5:59] and it would be important i think at
[6:02] this point to even say that as we've
[6:03] mentioned already
[6:05] meekness is not weakness and that we
[6:08] think well oh they just seem so meek a
[6:09] lot of times we we're really referring
[6:11] to someone who seems timid
[6:13] uh uh uh or a little bit placid well
[6:15] they're not really
[6:16] i don't want to offend and they can be
[6:19] just very careful how they act and
[6:21] so meekness isn't the result of being
[6:24] weak
[6:25] meekness you can really only be meek if
[6:27] you have strength
[6:29] uh you know if i was gonna if i bumped
[6:31] into somebody
[6:32] and uh and and they look like they can
[6:34] fight and they're bigger than me
[6:36] and i accidentally bump in and they turn
[6:37] around like hey you got a problem
[6:39] i could act very meek like hey i'm sorry
[6:42] you know i don't want any trouble i
[6:43] didn't mean to bump into you
[6:45] and that's not actually meekness that's
[6:46] just you know reality
[6:48] that i probably couldn't hold my own in
[6:50] a fight and so i just need to move along
[6:52] but one who knows
[6:54] that they could war one that could pick
[6:55] up a weapon one they could respond they
[6:57] could have something to say
[6:59] meekness is demonstrated in what the
[7:00] government of passions
[7:02] and not being quick to respond and not
[7:05] being quick to fight and not being quick
[7:06] to assert yourself
[7:08] and so this confidence it's part of the
[7:11] uh maybe just another way of expressing
[7:13] this
[7:13] aspect of wisdom and the aspect of
[7:15] meekness but it
[7:16] it comes from this word which means to
[7:19] abide or this source of
[7:20] it's the source of trust faith or
[7:22] reliance it's strong it's mighty it's
[7:24] powerful
[7:26] and if you're abiding it means to be
[7:28] sustained or to stay
[7:30] firm under so the word if you're
[7:32] confident if wisdom is confident
[7:35] then this is what wisdom looks like it's
[7:36] resting
[7:38] wisdom is abiding we've mentioned this
[7:40] before how that rest was coming up as a
[7:42] theme as we looked at this wisdom from
[7:44] above
[7:45] this to be confident means you're at
[7:46] rest you're assured
[7:48] you're reliant you're firm and in john
[7:51] chapter 15
[7:52] verse 4 jesus says abide in me and i
[7:55] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[7:58] of itself
[7:58] except it abide in the vine no more can
[8:01] ye
[8:01] except ye abide in me and so if we
[8:05] as the branches abide in the vine then
[8:09] we will bring forth fruit
[8:10] and this word abide it means to live or
[8:13] to rest in
[8:14] to continue to depend upon and so this
[8:17] is
[8:17] this is what confidence is if you have
[8:19] confidence then it's a strong belief
[8:21] you're fully persuaded you're fully
[8:23] assured
[8:24] you're reliant upon something and your
[8:26] reliance upon that gives you a boldness
[8:28] your reliance upon that gives you
[8:30] strength it gives you confidence so this
[8:32] is
[8:32] kind of the picture i'm wanting to paint
[8:34] that when you're when you're resting in
[8:36] wisdom when you're secured in wisdom it
[8:38] produces a confidence
[8:39] it's a source of strength so he says
[8:41] abide in me and if you abide in him if
[8:44] you're resting in him if you're trusting
[8:46] to him
[8:47] if you're depending upon him as a branch
[8:49] is upon the vine
[8:50] then you'll bring forth fruit brother
[8:52] braham says and the branch bears record
[8:54] of the vine
[8:55] because it draws its energy and life
[8:58] from
[8:59] the vine so the branch doesn't brag
[9:01] about itself it doesn't brag about its
[9:03] abilities it doesn't brag about
[9:04] oh look at how fruitful i am the branch
[9:06] knows except to be a part of the vine
[9:09] it's not receiving any energy to bring
[9:11] forth fruit so it recognizes its
[9:13] dependence and its reliance upon
[9:15] the source of energy so the vine
[9:17] furnishes energy to the branches
[9:20] it's resting and depending upon the vine
[9:23] it's resting and depending upon the life
[9:25] this is what we how we can be and how we
[9:27] can live when we're tapped into true
[9:29] wisdom
[9:30] we can be confident now if you look at
[9:32] these verses
[9:33] in james chapter 3 i'd like to
[9:37] and i've provided just a one slide that
[9:39] has all of the
[9:41] uh verses together because i just kind
[9:43] of want to move around
[9:44] in some of these words and i hope that
[9:46] the use of these different colors
[9:48] doesn't throw you off but i just kind of
[9:49] i wanted to kind of group them together
[9:51] because in james chapter 3 verses 13 to
[9:54] 18
[9:55] it's it's showing us the nature of
[9:57] wisdom and as a result the fruits of
[9:59] wisdom
[10:00] in verses 13 and 17 and this nature
[10:04] and fruit of wisdom is contrasted by
[10:07] earthly wisdom or sensual devilish
[10:09] wisdom
[10:10] that's referenced in verses 14 to 16.
[10:13] and so the nature of sensual wisdom
[10:17] is bitter envying and strife that's kind
[10:19] of the nature of it that's
[10:20] that's how it's character that's the
[10:22] force behind it that's what motivates it
[10:24] and then the fruits of it in verse 16
[10:27] are confusion
[10:28] and every evil work so this if you're
[10:32] if there's an evil work somewhere in
[10:33] there we can find bitter even
[10:35] bitter envying in strife and know that
[10:38] wisdom from above did not produce chaos
[10:41] wisdom from god did not produce this
[10:43] confusion
[10:44] and every evil work so the nature bitter
[10:47] envy and strife in verse 14
[10:49] produces the fruit in verse 16 of
[10:51] confusion in every evil work
[10:53] this is the nature and fruit of earthly
[10:55] wisdom
[10:57] and i i want you to kind of identify
[10:59] this characteristic if someone is
[11:00] jealous
[11:01] they're certainly not confident in
[11:02] themselves
[11:04] if somebody's envy and they're striving
[11:07] and they're in strife and there's this
[11:08] conflict
[11:09] then they're obviously not resting and
[11:11] confident in who they are and what god
[11:12] made them
[11:13] and so there's where there's fighting
[11:15] where's the envy and where there's a
[11:16] lack of settledness and lack of rest
[11:18] then this is the lack of wisdom there's
[11:20] not that confidence there
[11:22] so he characterizes earthly earthly
[11:25] wisdom and sensual wisdom and devilish
[11:26] wisdom as being combative and they're
[11:29] being conflict and they're being
[11:30] jealousy
[11:31] and a lack of settledness in a person's
[11:33] heart
[11:34] but the meekness of wisdom as he says in
[11:36] verse 13 he calls it the meekness of
[11:38] wisdom
[11:39] it produces the fruits of verse 17.
[11:42] so as you're looking at this we see the
[11:43] fruits of verse 17
[11:45] these are the characteristics of wisdom
[11:47] which is from above and the bible
[11:49] characterizes it that the wisdom which
[11:51] is from above is pure
[11:52] it inspires reverence it is peaceable so
[11:55] it
[11:55] inspires reverence and promotes peace it
[11:58] is gentle it provokes patience
[12:00] now this is the impact it has on you
[12:03] when you've received wisdom from above
[12:04] then it's pure it's peaceable it's it's
[12:07] gentle
[12:08] but then also wisdom as it's imparted as
[12:10] it has its impact upon you
[12:12] then wisdom as we impart that it ought
[12:14] to provoke patience
[12:16] it ought to inspire promote peace so
[12:18] this is the way that wisdom works it's
[12:20] easily entreated it's willing to listen
[12:22] you it can actually handle disagreement
[12:27] well okay you see it a little bit
[12:28] differently let's work through this
[12:29] that's they help me
[12:30] help me to understand where you're
[12:31] coming from and and and often we
[12:34] we can get in a situation where one
[12:36] person sees it one way and we see it
[12:37] another
[12:38] and what we want to strive to do is get
[12:40] the other person to see
[12:42] what where we're coming from and and see
[12:44] it our way and understand what our basis
[12:46] is and
[12:46] and why we feel the way that we do and
[12:48] real wisdom if it really can kick in
[12:51] if you spent your time just trying to
[12:52] understand where the other person was
[12:54] coming from
[12:56] say well you you're different than me
[12:57] why where are you coming from why do you
[12:59] feel that way what is it you see what is
[13:00] it you feel
[13:01] what are you basing this on then you
[13:03] find the conflict sometimes resolves
[13:04] itself just in knowing where the
[13:07] person's coming from oh
[13:08] i see where you're coming from now i
[13:10] know why you feel that way i know why
[13:11] you made that decision
[13:13] i would have done it differently but had
[13:14] i been in your shoes i understand
[13:16] perfectly
[13:16] why you did it and it's it's this uh
[13:19] easily entreated not just taking a
[13:21] disagreement or doing it differently
[13:23] as a reason to put up your dukes and
[13:25] have it out
[13:26] and then it's merciful so it's not only
[13:29] willing to listen but it's willing to
[13:32] relieve somebody else of their burden
[13:34] when you're merciful you don't just say
[13:36] bless is hard or they're pitiful
[13:38] when you're merciful you're willing to
[13:40] relieve somebody
[13:42] of their burden you're willing to
[13:43] relieve them of what they're carrying
[13:44] and the difficulty that they're going
[13:46] through
[13:46] i know we have a saying that as long as
[13:48] you say bless their heart you can say
[13:49] whatever you want about somebody
[13:51] and that's the wrong kind of mercy mercy
[13:53] we're talking about having the kind of
[13:55] mercy where
[13:55] oh isn't that pitiful isn't that awful i
[13:58] want to help them
[13:59] that's the merciful and then it's
[14:01] impartial
[14:03] so it's without partiality it's
[14:04] impartial it's it's without hypocrisy
[14:06] it's not self-serving
[14:08] and and the bible says that it these
[14:10] fruits are
[14:11] it's fruitful it brings forth and it's
[14:13] abundant in good fruit
[14:15] so the wisdom which is from above
[14:17] exhibits itself
[14:20] with all these different characteristics
[14:22] and if you take them together
[14:23] and if somebody was to have this these
[14:26] guiding attributes within their heart
[14:29] and in their thought
[14:30] process and in their motive and
[14:31] objective that they're pure and
[14:32] peaceable and gentle and easily
[14:34] entreated and merciful and impartial
[14:36] and without hypocrisy and without
[14:38] jealousy and envying and they're full of
[14:39] good fruits
[14:40] then this is the kind of wisdom that
[14:42] exhibits itself in character and grace
[14:45] it's the kind of wisdom that knows where
[14:47] she stands
[14:49] and that's what that's what was really
[14:50] striking me as i read these attributes
[14:52] and these characteristics of wisdom
[14:54] this is if someone is this way they say
[14:56] they obviously know where they
[14:58] stand if someone can exhibit these type
[15:00] of characteristics they're not kind of
[15:02] worried they're not wishy-washy they're
[15:03] not having to resort to certain kind of
[15:05] cheap tactics
[15:06] to have their way they know exactly
[15:08] where they're standing
[15:09] and so this wisdom that is from above it
[15:12] knows as you continue to look at this
[15:14] verse here
[15:15] and verse 18 it knows that it has the
[15:17] seed of righteousness
[15:20] it knows that it has the seed it is
[15:22] wisdom is the seed of justice it is the
[15:24] seed of judgment
[15:25] it is the seed of discernment so wisdom
[15:27] knows that it has the
[15:28] has power within itself to produce the
[15:31] fruits of righteousness
[15:32] it has power in itself to bring bring to
[15:34] pass a desired result
[15:37] so verse 18 is is identifying how this
[15:40] there's such confidence in this seed
[15:42] there's such confidence in the power of
[15:44] wisdom
[15:45] that it knows right the right fruit is
[15:48] planted
[15:48] as you read that verse this as it uses
[15:50] this great language and the fruit of
[15:52] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[15:54] that make peace
[15:55] that the right fruit is planted by those
[15:58] who act purposely
[15:59] who act confidently the right kind of
[16:02] seed
[16:02] is planted by those when it's planted by
[16:04] those who are exhibiting patience and
[16:06] exhibiting grace they know
[16:08] that it's going to return to them
[16:10] fruitful they're not worried about it
[16:12] they're not having to dig it up they
[16:13] haven't done any dirt to cause it to
[16:14] happen they haven't pulled any
[16:16] punches they're not lying and this isn't
[16:17] a con they know exactly where they're
[16:19] standing
[16:20] and so those that plant the right kind
[16:22] of fruit know that through their
[16:23] diligence and being purposeful
[16:25] it's going to bring the right thing the
[16:27] bible identifies it as peace it's going
[16:29] to bring forth peaceable fruit
[16:31] so what wisdom from above looks like
[16:34] these are the virtues here in verse 17.
[16:36] these are the virtues
[16:37] that wisdom looks like and these are the
[16:39] virtues that we desire the spirit of god
[16:41] to promote
[16:42] that's what we ought to desire we all
[16:44] say well we read about the fruits of the
[16:45] spirit you should be desiring
[16:47] that the holy spirit which is in you
[16:49] would produce the fruits of the spirit
[16:51] in your life
[16:53] i i want to read in two different places
[16:56] and since i want to
[16:57] i will unless the lord stops me but two
[16:59] different places that
[17:00] we have mentioned already in isaiah in
[17:03] proverbs
[17:05] and i would like to read in isaiah
[17:06] chapter 32 verses 15 to 18.
[17:10] and i'm really just reinforcing
[17:14] how what we need is wisdom this is what
[17:16] we should ask god for this is what we
[17:18] should be desiring is wisdom
[17:20] and we don't need programs and we don't
[17:22] need certain protocols and we don't just
[17:23] need to be told what to do we really
[17:25] as believers we want to understand the
[17:27] wisdom of god behind
[17:29] certain precepts and principles that we
[17:31] believe and even things that we teach
[17:34] and we can say well i want to apply the
[17:35] token to my home and i want to create an
[17:37] atmosphere and i don't want
[17:38] i don't want certain things to be inside
[17:40] my home well i think it would be good to
[17:42] understand the wisdom behind that
[17:45] understand the wisdom behind it you know
[17:46] what the objective is and the goal is
[17:48] then you have something more than just a
[17:50] don't or do
[17:51] that you're working by you have a wisdom
[17:53] so that whenever you get into a scenario
[17:55] you go well this doesn't fit within the
[17:56] black and white of the do's and don'ts
[17:58] but you have some sort of some kind of
[18:00] driving discernment and wisdom in your
[18:02] heart to say
[18:02] now i've never been in this situation
[18:04] before but can ask god to give you
[18:06] wisdom to navigate it
[18:08] and so there's uh these are things that
[18:10] i hope that you can make very very
[18:11] practical
[18:13] because we're talking about uh um things
[18:15] that are very
[18:16] uh uh very pertinent to the lives that
[18:19] we live
[18:20] and i will say this that my repetition
[18:22] is intentional so
[18:24] if you want to remind me that i've used
[18:25] these scriptures before absolutely
[18:27] by all means you can tell me because i'm
[18:29] easily entreated
[18:31] and uh and and i don't mind that but the
[18:34] repetition
[18:34] is intentional and isaiah chapter 32
[18:39] verses 15 to 18
[18:41] now notice how there's this great
[18:43] symmetry even to the point to where
[18:45] it appears as if james is drawing from
[18:48] these very verses
[18:49] in isaiah chapter 32 verses 15 to 18
[18:52] until the spirit be poured upon us from
[18:54] on high which he refers to the wisdom
[18:56] from above from on high and the
[18:58] wilderness be a fruitful filled
[19:00] and the fruitful field be counted for a
[19:02] force so as this wisdom which is from
[19:04] above
[19:04] he says has this fruit of righteousness
[19:07] which was sown in peace
[19:08] he's saying when the spirit comes from
[19:10] on high the wilderness is going to
[19:11] become a fruitful field
[19:13] and the fruitful field is going to be
[19:14] counted for a forest not just a few
[19:16] twigs here and there and a few shrubs or
[19:18] bushes but it's going to be so abundant
[19:20] it's going to be as a forest
[19:22] then judgment when the spirit has come
[19:25] from on high then judgment which is
[19:27] discernment and wisdom
[19:28] shall dwell in the wilderness now this
[19:31] is where the fruits are
[19:32] so he's connecting the fruitful filled
[19:34] and the fruitful field be in a forest
[19:36] he's connecting it with judgment that
[19:38] dwells in the wilderness
[19:39] in righteousness which is justice and
[19:41] this understanding
[19:43] shall remain remain in the fruit
[19:45] fulfilled
[19:46] so it tells us that there's going to be
[19:48] a spirit that comes from on high
[19:50] and a wilderness is going to be fruitful
[19:51] and the field is going to be counted for
[19:53] for us because of all the fruit
[19:54] and then we see this characteristics of
[19:56] judgment and righteousness
[19:58] is going to be what's bringing forth
[19:59] fruit the very same thing that we see in
[20:02] james chapter 3
[20:03] the meekness of wisdom brings forth
[20:04] these fruits in verse 17.
[20:07] so verse 17 here in isaiah 32 and the
[20:09] work of righteousness
[20:11] shall be peace the fruit of
[20:14] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[20:16] that
[20:16] make peace the fruit or the work of
[20:18] righteousness shall be peace
[20:20] and the effect of righteousness
[20:22] quietness
[20:23] and assurance forever
[20:27] quietness and assurance that's confident
[20:29] trust
[20:30] forever so is this wisdom which is from
[20:33] above it gives a confidence it gives a
[20:35] rest that's my emphasis today
[20:37] that wisdom from above ought to put you
[20:39] in the condition of rest
[20:40] wisdom from above ought to put you in
[20:43] resting give you confidence trusting too
[20:45] sure of what it is you believe in and so
[20:48] this wisdom being poured out from above
[20:50] it makes a wilderness fruitful and a
[20:51] field to be fruitful
[20:53] judgment and righteousness are reigning
[20:55] in the field the work of righteousness
[20:56] is producing peace
[20:58] the effect of righteousness is quietness
[21:00] and confident assurance and trust
[21:02] forever
[21:02] and this is what it produces and my
[21:05] people shall
[21:06] dwell my people shall dwell
[21:09] in a peaceable habitation this is a home
[21:13] this is where you live this is where
[21:14] life
[21:15] is occurring and transpiring every day
[21:18] it doesn't describe
[21:18] church it describes life and i'm so glad
[21:22] that church
[21:23] can impact life and that church isn't
[21:26] just an
[21:27] escape from life for a lot of people
[21:30] that's what church has become
[21:31] churches become an escape from life and
[21:33] they just go back to back to these
[21:34] dreadful living conditions and dreadful
[21:36] relationships and dreadful
[21:38] home life and dreadful dynamics and job
[21:40] and all these things but i believe that
[21:42] church
[21:42] is where the word is lifted up and the
[21:44] word being received into hearts we can
[21:46] go back home
[21:47] and change our home life so that
[21:49] churches isn't an escape
[21:50] from life but that it's a benefit and a
[21:54] boost to life because we don't
[21:57] we don't uh live to go to church we go
[21:59] to church to live
[22:03] and so it says then you my people shall
[22:05] dwell in a
[22:06] peaceable habitation and ensure
[22:09] dwellings which is a
[22:10] a tabernacle residing and in quiet
[22:13] resting places this is what
[22:16] is the effect of righteousness this is
[22:19] what the the work of righteousness the
[22:21] fruit
[22:21] of righteousness is sown in peace of
[22:23] them that make peace
[22:24] these are the kind of fruits and they
[22:26] just get very bold just to proclaim and
[22:28] say lord if you're giving me wisdom
[22:30] and i'm operating wisdom in my personal
[22:32] life if i'm using wisdom in my personal
[22:34] relationships
[22:35] if i'm yielding to wisdom from above and
[22:37] how that i order my home and raise my
[22:39] children and
[22:40] work through things with my wife then
[22:42] these are the fruits that i can claim
[22:44] these are the things that i can believe
[22:46] that god is going to do he is going to
[22:48] bring these things
[22:49] to pass where we have a dwell in a
[22:51] peaceable habitation
[22:53] ensure dwellings and in quiet resting
[22:55] places
[22:57] peaceable habitation that shalom a
[22:59] complete and sound
[23:01] content home assure rest assure
[23:05] dwelling that is a confident trusting
[23:07] and secure
[23:08] place these are the feelings these are
[23:10] the attributes these are the
[23:11] characteristics that you're going to
[23:12] have
[23:13] thank goodness it's not describing the
[23:14] square footage
[23:17] do you realize just what a quandary we'd
[23:19] all be in if it says and then you shall
[23:20] dwell on a 3 000 square foot house you'd
[23:22] be like
[23:22] well mine's 2 700 square feet what do we
[23:24] do or if you lived in a 4 200 square
[23:26] foot house
[23:27] do we have too much but it's not
[23:29] describing
[23:30] a basement suite it's not describing
[23:32] town home it's not describing
[23:34] apartment or duplex or any or a house or
[23:37] tent it's just saying this is the
[23:39] characteristic of it
[23:41] we're not talking about houses we're
[23:42] talking about homes
[23:44] it's something that has to do with the
[23:46] characteristic and the character of
[23:47] something you're going to have a
[23:49] confident trusting
[23:50] and secure place to live it's going to
[23:52] be it says a sure
[23:53] dwelling this is a state of confidence
[23:56] this is a state of being safe and secure
[23:58] it speaks of security
[24:01] i says quiet resting places this is a
[24:03] means you're secure
[24:04] this means you're at ease and it's a
[24:06] place of rest
[24:08] this is the fruit of wisdom this is when
[24:10] the spirit is poured out from on high
[24:12] and it begins to produce fruits if you
[24:13] want to look into your life and say
[24:15] is our is my life being fruitful do i
[24:18] see the effects of righteousness
[24:20] do i see the fruit of yielding to the
[24:22] word of the hour do i see the fruit of
[24:23] applying the token
[24:24] applying the token should not just
[24:26] produce conflict and strife and
[24:28] disagreements and arguments over gaming
[24:30] consoles and how much screen
[24:32] time we have and whether or not we're on
[24:33] the same page as a spouse but rather
[24:35] wisdom from
[24:36] above as it's being yielded to it as
[24:38] it's being properly applied
[24:39] will produce peaceable habitation sheer
[24:42] dwellings
[24:43] and quiet resting places this is the
[24:46] fruit of wisdom
[24:49] there's different things that we're
[24:50] going to be we're reading about here
[24:51] these are the products of wisdom
[24:53] proverbs chapter 24
[24:55] verses 3 to 6. i know that we've read
[24:57] this a number of times already
[25:00] but it's it's just reinforcing how what
[25:03] we can ask god for
[25:05] is wisdom and it can be very very
[25:07] practical
[25:09] whatever stage of life you're in
[25:10] whatever circumstance you find yourself
[25:12] in you can ask god for wisdom
[25:14] and he'll give you something very very
[25:15] practical the wisdom is a house build it
[25:18] and by
[25:18] understanding it is established you'll
[25:20] find that wisdom builds
[25:22] it causes it's going to since it builds
[25:25] by wisdom
[25:26] is a house and through wisdom is a house
[25:27] builder that means it builds it
[25:29] it causes it to continue it builds it up
[25:31] and matures it
[25:32] it's part of establishing the foundation
[25:34] and so once wisdom has built the house
[25:37] then by understanding it is established
[25:39] and by knowledge shall the chambers be
[25:41] filled with all precious
[25:42] and pleasant riches we build it we cause
[25:45] it to continue and to mature through
[25:47] wisdom we establish it through
[25:48] understanding and we fill it through
[25:50] knowledge and then so this is
[25:52] the establishment is the preparation of
[25:54] it the arrangement it being settled and
[25:56] made firm it's
[25:57] it's secured it's ordered to fill it up
[25:59] it means it's satisfied and it's
[26:00] complete
[26:01] wisdom builds understanding establishes
[26:03] knowledge fills this is
[26:05] very practical uh this is a very
[26:08] practical scripture even though we're
[26:09] maybe not being specific and
[26:11] how wisdom builds and how knowledge
[26:12] under uh establishes and how
[26:14] uh knowledge will um fill it up with all
[26:18] these precious things
[26:19] you can take that say lord this seems to
[26:20] be a very general promise to me
[26:23] but i know that you can make application
[26:25] you can give me the right kind of
[26:26] guidance
[26:27] and through your word to make very
[26:29] practical application of this
[26:31] verse five now since we've read verses
[26:33] three and four quite a bit it says a
[26:35] wise man
[26:36] is strong it's about the building of a
[26:38] house
[26:39] your house is builded through wisdom it
[26:41] says so a wise man is strong
[26:43] a man of knowledge increaseth strength
[26:46] these are the things that establish and
[26:48] build and promote and fill up a house
[26:50] for a wise man is strong a man of
[26:52] knowledge increased his strength
[26:53] for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy
[26:56] war
[26:57] those you wouldn't go to war without
[26:59] counsel you wouldn't just do it through
[27:01] emotion you wouldn't just do it simply
[27:03] because you disagree
[27:04] you wouldn't just do it because well
[27:05] that land looks really good if we could
[27:06] just drive the inhabitants out of it
[27:08] you would you would only engage in
[27:10] conflict you would only engage in some
[27:12] sort of
[27:13] uh com combat or a war is it saying it's
[27:16] by
[27:16] wise counsel you make that war it's
[27:18] reply it's referring to something that
[27:20] would be the most significant and
[27:22] substantial thing
[27:23] that people could engage in war says
[27:25] when you make big decisions
[27:26] and when and there's serious things and
[27:28] substantial things in your life you use
[27:30] wisdom
[27:31] only by wise counsel would you make war
[27:33] only by wise counsel would you make
[27:35] these decisions and in the multitude of
[27:37] counselors
[27:38] there is safety whenever someone tells
[27:41] me
[27:41] uh well when do unto you lawyers i say
[27:44] well it also says in the multitude of
[27:45] counselors
[27:46] there there's safety i it was brother
[27:49] dan daisy that came
[27:50] told me one time he said brother aaron
[27:51] i've got a scripture for you woe into
[27:53] your lawyers i said i've got a scripture
[27:55] for myself
[27:56] what was me
[28:00] and he never used it again on me for by
[28:03] wise counsel you make war and in the
[28:05] multitude of counselors there is safety
[28:08] so just be very very practical
[28:11] in your life and even begin to think how
[28:13] that in the very specific situations
[28:15] that you find yourself
[28:17] in how you can make practical
[28:19] application
[28:20] that in these different scenarios i'm
[28:22] wanting to build and promote and cause
[28:23] my house to continue
[28:25] through wisdom is the house built it by
[28:26] understanding is it established and
[28:28] through knowledge it's going to be
[28:29] filled with the right things
[28:31] the beneficial things the things that
[28:33] promote peace because the fruit of
[28:34] righteousness
[28:35] is sown in peace of them that make peace
[28:38] the bible says in proverbs chapter 9
[28:41] verse 1 wisdom hath builded her house
[28:44] she hath hewn out her seven pillars
[28:48] so when wisdom builds her house she hews
[28:51] out
[28:52] seven pillars and the use of the phrase
[28:54] seven pillars means it's complete it's
[28:56] strong it's durable wisdom builds her
[28:59] house and when she builds a house
[29:01] it's it has power it has stability
[29:05] so when it says that through wisdom is a
[29:06] house built and wisdom have built at her
[29:08] house she's hewn outer seven pillars it
[29:10] speaks of stability power
[29:12] durability of wisdom and when
[29:14] something's durable you can have
[29:15] confidence in it
[29:17] something has power or something is
[29:19] secure then it's something that you can
[29:20] rest
[29:21] in you can rest confidently and why
[29:24] because it's secure it's safe
[29:25] it's sure it says wisdom hath
[29:28] built or builded her house
[29:31] this is how we want to build our lives
[29:33] this is how we want to grow we want to
[29:35] grow in wisdom
[29:36] now if you could turn with me to
[29:38] proverbs chapter 31
[29:41] verses 25 and 26 i'll i'll i want to
[29:44] read them and then come right back to
[29:45] him it says strength and honor or her
[29:47] clothing
[29:48] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[29:50] she opened her mouth with wisdom and in
[29:52] her tongue is the law of kindness
[29:54] now i want to take this description of
[29:57] this woman
[29:58] as being descriptive one who is acting
[30:00] according to wisdom
[30:02] so as it applies to a woman i believe we
[30:05] could take these same characteristics
[30:06] and these same virtues and say
[30:08] that really in the way that these are
[30:09] manifested themselves in the virtuous
[30:11] woman
[30:12] this is really wisdom that's operated in
[30:14] her life and then in the same way
[30:16] man or woman male or female we can begin
[30:18] to conduct ourselves in some sort of
[30:20] similar way and have similar
[30:21] characteristics and attributes
[30:22] if we're acting according to wisdom and
[30:25] verses 25 and 26 i want to use this as
[30:28] descriptive of any one of us
[30:30] who's being endued with wisdom and power
[30:32] from on high
[30:33] as the bible says in verse 1 in proverbs
[30:36] chapter 31 verse 10 rather
[30:38] who can find a virtuous woman so it's
[30:40] describing a virtuous woman
[30:42] and it says for her price is far above
[30:45] rubies so this virtuous woman who has
[30:48] strength her strength and honor or her
[30:49] clothing and she rejoices in a time to
[30:51] come she
[30:52] opens her mouth with wisdom and her
[30:53] tongue is the law of kindness she is a
[30:55] virtuous woman whose price
[30:57] is far above rubies now what is it that
[31:00] characterizes her what makes her so
[31:02] profound
[31:03] that her price would be far above rubies
[31:05] it's not her beauty
[31:07] and it's not that she's just really
[31:08] shrewd in business it all comes back to
[31:11] one attribute and characteristic
[31:12] that the ver that the book of proverbs
[31:14] is constantly lifting up
[31:15] wisdom the virtuous woman is not uh it's
[31:19] she's not
[31:20] lifted up in a spouse just because she's
[31:22] virtuous
[31:23] but it's the wisdom that she has it's
[31:25] the grace
[31:26] that she has in her wisdom in job
[31:28] chapter 28 verses 12 to 21 it says but
[31:32] where shall wisdom be found and where is
[31:34] the place of understanding
[31:36] and i'll go through this quickly saying
[31:37] man doesn't know the price thereof it's
[31:38] not found in the land of living
[31:40] depth says it's not with me it cannot be
[31:42] gotten for gold silver cannot be weighed
[31:44] for the price thereof it cannot be
[31:45] valued with the gold of ofer
[31:47] the precious onyx or sapphire gold and
[31:49] crystal cannot equal it
[31:50] and the exchange of it shall not be for
[31:52] jewels of fine gold
[31:54] where is wisdom where's the place of
[31:56] understanding there's no material wealth
[31:58] or possessions that can really ever be
[32:00] accumulated
[32:01] to speak to its worth and in verse 18
[32:04] no mention shall be made of coral or of
[32:06] pearls they can't compare
[32:08] for the price of wisdom is above rubies
[32:12] so when it's asking and again in verse
[32:13] 20 when winston cometh wisdom
[32:15] and where is the place of understanding
[32:17] it says the price of wisdom is above
[32:19] rubies
[32:20] so when the bible says you know who who
[32:22] can find a virtuous woman
[32:24] for her price is far above rubies really
[32:26] what makes this woman so valuable
[32:28] is her wisdom this is what makes her an
[32:31] attribute to her husband this is what
[32:32] makes her an attribute to her children
[32:34] it is not that she is virtuous and that
[32:36] keeping herself from things that
[32:38] would spoil her but it's the wisdom that
[32:40] keeps her it's her discretion that keeps
[32:42] her it's her judgment and discernment
[32:43] that makes her this incredibly powerful
[32:45] woman that we read about
[32:47] in proverbs 31 because the price of
[32:49] wisdom is above rubies
[32:51] and if her price is above rubies then i
[32:53] could even say this
[32:54] wisdom is the thing that's being
[32:56] espoused in proverbs 31.
[32:58] though i believe it does speak to the
[32:59] woman but it's speaking to wisdom
[33:02] that we can all ask for so verse 25
[33:05] proverbs 31 verse 25 strength
[33:08] and honor are her clothing
[33:12] this is this is what wisdom looks like
[33:14] strength and honor are her clothing
[33:16] and she shall rejoice in the time to
[33:19] come
[33:20] now so that we can see that this is
[33:22] wisdom that's being expressed in verse
[33:24] 25 it says she openeth her mouth with
[33:26] wisdom and in her tongue is the law of
[33:28] kindness she
[33:28] governs herself so she opened her mouth
[33:30] with wisdom she governs herself
[33:32] by the rules of wisdom her price is far
[33:34] above ruby so she's characterized as
[33:36] wisdom
[33:37] and she governs herself by wisdom she
[33:39] not only acts wisely
[33:41] but her tongue is the law of kindness
[33:42] she gives wise counsel
[33:45] and remember her speech here she opens
[33:47] her mouth and wisdom and her tongue is
[33:49] the law of kindness she governs herself
[33:51] by wisdom
[33:52] and she gives wise counsel so strength
[33:55] and honor
[33:56] are her clothing she's clothed in
[33:58] strength she's pro
[33:59] she's firm she prevails and she's
[34:02] clothed in strength and honor
[34:05] this is describing then to us that
[34:07] wisdom is strong
[34:10] wisdom is powerful wisdom is confident
[34:12] wisdom is
[34:13] fearless strength and honor are her
[34:16] clothing and she shall rejoice
[34:18] in time to come this phrase is so
[34:21] beautiful
[34:21] to rejoice in time to come it means she
[34:23] looks forward to the future without
[34:25] anxiety
[34:27] now come on everybody just go ahead and
[34:29] wake up here at 7
[34:31] 58 because this is just will get really
[34:34] good for all of us
[34:35] think about it not worrying about the
[34:38] future
[34:39] when we have wisdom we're not worried
[34:40] about what the future holds we can
[34:41] actually look forward
[34:43] to whatever is going to happen
[34:44] economically politically
[34:46] socially physically you name it lee
[34:49] whatever it might be
[34:51] we're just hey i'm not worried about the
[34:54] future
[34:55] well what if this happens i'm not
[34:56] worried about it it says that she can
[34:58] rejoice this phrase is so deep
[35:00] she can rejoice in the future she can
[35:03] look forward to the future without
[35:04] anxiety
[35:05] she can look forward to the future with
[35:08] confident
[35:08] joy that's what it means that this
[35:12] wisdom is strength and honor wisdom
[35:14] of this this virtue of wisdom is that it
[35:16] can it can
[35:17] cause you to look forward to whatever
[35:19] tomorrow holds
[35:21] with confident joy
[35:25] she shall rejoice in time to come it
[35:27] means wisdom gives a constant
[35:28] tranquility of mind
[35:31] it's confident this to rejoice in time
[35:35] to come means there's a cheerful
[35:36] expectation
[35:37] oh it's looking really bad tomorrow i
[35:39] know isn't that great
[35:41] well what do you mean well my god is a
[35:43] god that's really good when things are
[35:44] bad
[35:47] you're rejoicing in the time to come no
[35:48] matter what kind of foreboding whatever
[35:50] seems to be on the horizon you think man
[35:52] it's getting dark oh my goodness this is
[35:55] going to be rough
[35:56] it's just another opportunity for him to
[35:58] come walking on the water
[35:59] just another opportunity to find out
[36:01] just how deep that anchor is rooted in
[36:03] this solid rock
[36:04] so you can just be confident that's what
[36:06] wisdom from above is
[36:07] trying to teach all of us to trust to to
[36:11] rest
[36:11] and to be be sure of him
[36:15] regardless of how dire the circumstances
[36:17] may be or how terrible a situation is
[36:19] strength and honor her clothing she
[36:21] dresses herself in strength and on her
[36:22] no matter how bad it looks and no matter
[36:24] how bad it may seem and how bad
[36:25] everyone's talking
[36:26] she will rejoice and look forward to the
[36:29] future with confident joy
[36:32] why because wisdom has a just confidence
[36:34] in god's gracious providence
[36:37] wisdom has a rightful correct and just
[36:40] confidence in god's promises to us
[36:42] so no matter what's coming we can rest
[36:44] in his promises
[36:46] no matter how bad it looks we can rest
[36:47] in his promise whatever promise you want
[36:49] to think about whatever you want to say
[36:51] however you want to spin it however you
[36:52] want to uh whatever context you want to
[36:54] put it in
[36:54] this is what wisdom from a above
[36:57] produces which comes on the wings of a
[36:58] dove
[36:59] it gives you this kind of confidence to
[37:00] believe i know that even if this happens
[37:02] i don't want it to happen but even if it
[37:04] does happen
[37:05] wisdom tells me to trust him
[37:08] well what if you made a mistake wisdom
[37:10] tells you that you can make it right
[37:11] he'll see you through nothing will
[37:13] destroy you
[37:15] so wisdom is right wisdom is correct
[37:17] just to trust in god in his promises
[37:20] one translation or commentary writes it
[37:23] this way
[37:23] she laughs at the future so far from
[37:26] regarding it with apprehension
[37:28] that she can look forward to it with
[37:30] joyful confidence
[37:33] he said well if the future holds this
[37:36] the future holds that wisdom tells you
[37:38] that you can that you've got this by his
[37:41] grace
[37:42] this is what wisdom builds and when you
[37:45] start building in wisdom
[37:47] now that you have this wisdom and now
[37:49] that you're walking with wisdom whatever
[37:50] the future holds you say
[37:52] i know this is correct i know this is
[37:54] right i know this is a solid foundation
[37:56] wisdom has built this house
[37:57] it's not just on the sands of some man's
[37:59] ideas it's not just on the sands of
[38:01] politics and pretense
[38:02] i'm built upon a solid rock it can
[38:04] withstand the things that are coming
[38:06] and it says that it can have a confident
[38:08] joy or
[38:09] joyful confidence no apprehension or
[38:12] fear about the future what can do that
[38:14] only wisdom from above
[38:18] so it is it is speaking to how that if
[38:21] we have
[38:22] prepared in wisdom and that we have
[38:25] gained our provision with wisdom
[38:28] then it's that it's going to be secure
[38:30] it's going to meet the need
[38:32] and as you read in proverbs chapter 31
[38:34] and these characteristics of this
[38:35] virtuous woman
[38:37] you'll find that she has behaved in such
[38:39] a wise manner
[38:41] that no matter what the future holds she
[38:43] knows that her wisdom will uphold her
[38:46] that she's already been making the
[38:47] prudent decisions
[38:49] she as even you could go through it you
[38:51] almost feel tempted just to start going
[38:52] back through all these different
[38:53] scriptures and proverbs
[38:55] she's learned from the ant to store up
[38:57] during the right kind of season
[38:58] she knows that when the dark and hard
[39:00] times come that she's already in the fat
[39:02] times and the good times and the things
[39:03] when
[39:04] things are being blessed that she's made
[39:05] the proper provision for the lean times
[39:07] this is what wisdom will afford you
[39:10] the ability to prepare and the provision
[39:12] in a time of
[39:13] when there's not plenty so this is why
[39:17] this is how wisdom builds and how it
[39:18] continues
[39:20] so we want to start building with wisdom
[39:22] so that when there's a calamity there's
[39:24] something coming
[39:25] we can just to use the language of the
[39:27] scripture rejoice in time to come
[39:29] we can laugh at the future as it were
[39:32] we can rejoice knowing that our god has
[39:35] this
[39:36] that we're made for this he'll see us
[39:37] through
[39:39] strength and honor are her clothing
[39:42] she has by wisdom prepared and has
[39:44] sufficient provision to meet the needs
[39:47] in proverbs chapter 14 verse 1 it says
[39:49] every wise woman
[39:51] buildeth her house proverbs 9 told us
[39:53] that wisdom builds her house now it says
[39:55] every wise woman
[39:56] buildeth their house but then it break
[39:58] makes this great contrast
[39:59] but the foolish plucketh it down with
[40:01] her hands
[40:03] the foolish woman will blame everyone
[40:05] else but we know scripturally
[40:07] the foolish woman has tore down her own
[40:09] house with her own doing
[40:11] the foolish is one who despises wisdom
[40:13] it speaks of one who's quarrelsome
[40:15] there's envy there's strife there's
[40:16] always a a rationalize and there's
[40:18] always a fighting always a disputing and
[40:20] it plucketh it it destroys or ruins her
[40:22] own house
[40:23] with her own hands she can't sit back
[40:27] and say oh this is the providence of god
[40:29] and he's trying to teach me something
[40:30] and and this is what no it's their own
[40:32] foolishness that brings this the
[40:35] characteristic of a full scripture is
[40:37] one who despises wisdom or despises
[40:39] instruction or hates knowledge
[40:41] these are all phrases that are used of
[40:42] the fool in the book of proverbs they
[40:44] despise wisdom they despise instruction
[40:46] they hate knowledge the shame is the
[40:48] promotion of fools the foolish mouth is
[40:50] near destruction
[40:51] fools die for want of wisdom the
[40:53] companion of fools is destroyed
[40:56] don't hang out with a fool my companion
[40:59] of a fool is destroyed the fools die for
[41:01] one of wisdom
[41:02] shame is the promotion of a fool you
[41:04] want a promotion if you're full your
[41:06] promotion will be
[41:07] shame i was just promoted to more shame
[41:10] today ah you must be a fool
[41:12] because this is scripturally they
[41:14] despise wisdom they despise instruction
[41:16] they hate knowledge
[41:17] the foolish mouth is always near
[41:19] destruction
[41:21] so on one hand you have wisdom which
[41:22] sustains it protects it builds it
[41:24] provides the sure
[41:26] safe dwelling but foolishness is what
[41:28] tends to destruction
[41:31] but the the bible says in proverbs that
[41:34] to a full his way seems right
[41:37] and so this is where we have to be very
[41:40] careful
[41:41] that we don't confuse our own arrogance
[41:43] for confidence
[41:45] and this is just a simple challenge that
[41:48] sometimes people could they they sense
[41:50] there's some pride there or arrogance
[41:52] and we just quickly defend ourselves
[41:54] saying well i'm just very confident and
[41:56] that intimidates them
[41:58] and i think it would be important for us
[42:00] to ponder some time maybe i am being
[42:01] presumptuous maybe i am being arrogant
[42:03] may i
[42:04] maybe i am coming along a little strong
[42:06] maybe i am being foolish
[42:08] and what i think is confidence what i
[42:10] think is security
[42:11] and confidence in my in what god has
[42:13] done for me and sureness and what he's
[42:15] what he's allowed for me to do maybe i
[42:16] am lacking the meekness of wisdom
[42:19] and foolishness is being presented and
[42:21] what i'm calling
[42:22] confidence is actually a fool's
[42:24] arrogance or pride
[42:27] it says in proverbs 14 16 a wise man
[42:30] feareth and departed from evil he
[42:32] respects he reverences when he sees evil
[42:34] by wisdom
[42:35] he departs from it but the full rageth
[42:38] and is
[42:38] confident he rages
[42:42] why because his he is it is in his folly
[42:45] he rages in his carnality he's raised
[42:47] he's very adamant he's very convinced
[42:48] he's very boastful he's very arrogant
[42:50] this is the full rages in a time of uh
[42:53] when he's ought to be departing when he
[42:55] ought to be running and says and is
[42:57] confident it's the wrong kind of
[42:58] confidence
[43:00] confidence in an unfaithful man is like
[43:02] a a broken tooth or a foot out of joint
[43:05] it's not going to work it's not going to
[43:06] produce the results it's the wrong kind
[43:08] of confidence why it's not according to
[43:09] wisdom
[43:11] according to something that's sensual
[43:12] and devilish and earthly
[43:14] something that's loud and proud so the
[43:17] full can rage the full combos and the
[43:19] full can pretend to be confident
[43:21] but that's not what we're talking about
[43:23] proverbs chapter 1 verse 32
[43:26] for the turn in the way of the simple
[43:28] shall slay them this is the wrong kind
[43:30] of simple
[43:30] the turning away that means they refuse
[43:32] wisdom they just decline
[43:34] the call of wisdom this chapter wisdom
[43:36] is crying wisdom is calling out
[43:38] they turn away and therefore it slays
[43:40] them and the prosperity of fools
[43:43] shall destroy them the prosperity
[43:47] i think it's actually translated to
[43:48] quietness in other places in proverbs
[43:51] but it's the ease
[43:52] it's the failure to act it's the failure
[43:56] to plan
[43:57] it's the failure to prepare according to
[44:00] wisdom
[44:01] the fool is very confident but has no
[44:03] actions to back it up
[44:04] the fool is very confident very boastful
[44:07] but they don't have the wisdom of
[44:08] planning they don't have the wisdom of
[44:09] preparation they don't have the wisdom
[44:10] of foresight they don't have the wisdom
[44:12] of being proactive
[44:14] a fool can be very confident in his
[44:15] reflexes
[44:17] right always reacting always knee jerk
[44:19] ah i got the i got this i got that
[44:20] always has a
[44:21] has an opinion on something but the wise
[44:23] is proactive the why is this considering
[44:25] the why is this thinking through
[44:26] but it said the full he his prosperity
[44:29] is what destroys him it's his failure to
[44:31] act he's at ease
[44:32] it's the wrong kind of quietness i know
[44:35] there may seem to be a little bit of a
[44:36] paradox there
[44:37] and these different disposition
[44:38] dispositions or states
[44:40] but i'm trying to lift up this
[44:41] characteristic of wisdom which is
[44:43] confident
[44:45] the right kind of confidence
[44:49] so i had to make this practical
[44:52] when we know that we have god's word
[44:55] when we know that we have his wisdom
[44:58] then our conduct should reflect it
[45:00] i know i've been repeating myself over
[45:02] and over again
[45:04] maybe saying the same thing through
[45:05] several services now when we know we
[45:07] have the word then we should
[45:09] act according to it and in acting
[45:12] according to it
[45:13] this conduct is reflective of real
[45:15] wisdom
[45:17] we have the word of god if we have
[45:18] wisdom from above we can act confidently
[45:21] we can be trusting we can be at rest why
[45:24] because his word is sure
[45:26] the bible speaks when it says that jesus
[45:28] is speaking he says you know doth not
[45:30] the wisdom of god
[45:31] say that the prophets will be rejected
[45:33] what is the word it is the wisdom of god
[45:36] it says that the word will be rejected
[45:38] so we can we can act confidently
[45:40] we can be at rest we can be trusting in
[45:42] god's wisdom why because his word is
[45:44] sure
[45:46] you could take it to the bank you can
[45:47] rely on it you can trust in it
[45:49] his word is sure and his wisdom works
[45:52] you want to know what is timeless the
[45:54] wisdom of god
[45:55] if there has been a principle outlined
[45:57] in the scripture if there's a principle
[45:59] that's laid out and very plain in the
[46:00] word of god
[46:01] you ought to recognize that there's a
[46:03] wisdom to it and we what we want to tap
[46:05] into and be connected with is the wisdom
[46:07] of that word
[46:08] and not engage in revisionist history
[46:10] and try to explain away everything
[46:11] that's in the message
[46:13] i i have felt at times that man unless
[46:15] you know everywhere brother branham was
[46:17] preaching and who the pastor was and
[46:18] what year it was and who the audience
[46:20] was and unless you knew who paul was
[46:21] writing
[46:22] and where he was in his journey you can
[46:24] never really understand the scripture
[46:25] because we just try to explain
[46:26] everything away based upon the context
[46:29] he was here and he was there i know he
[46:30] said that in that message but that was
[46:31] this and this was that
[46:32] what we want to be tied into and connect
[46:34] with what's the wisdom behind it
[46:36] what's the prevailing wisdom behind it
[46:38] so that i can be benefited by these
[46:40] things that are being taught
[46:42] because that wisdom works and because it
[46:46] works we can rest in it
[46:48] the preparation and the provision of
[46:50] wisdom gives us confidence
[46:52] not the fool that rageth and is quiet
[46:54] and is at ease but rather the wise man
[46:56] who feareth
[46:57] and in fearing as we've mentioned it
[46:59] before he can see what's coming
[47:00] and he either can make himself available
[47:02] for a blessing or he can get out of the
[47:04] way of a cursing
[47:05] this is what discernment gives us as
[47:08] believers
[47:09] we can rest in it
[47:12] genesis chapter 22 the time is just
[47:16] unfolding perfectly this evening this is
[47:19] where i want to end
[47:24] just ponder
[47:29] this what wisdom looks like it's
[47:31] confident
[47:33] and let me say it at the outset abraham
[47:36] had been given a promise
[47:38] he had his name changed he thought well
[47:41] i just need a seat of my own house could
[47:42] it be my servant seed
[47:44] or could it be through my servant my
[47:46] seed through through my wife's handmaid
[47:48] and the lord just keeps confirming his
[47:50] promise no it's going to be through
[47:51] sarah it's going to be your son
[47:52] it's going to be isaac and through him
[47:55] all the families of the earth are going
[47:56] to be blessed and your seed is going to
[47:57] be multiplied as the sands of the earth
[47:59] and the stars of heaven these are all
[48:01] the things that abraham believes
[48:02] and as he's gone through these paces and
[48:04] as he's walked with these
[48:06] up these places with god and entrusted
[48:08] to the promise
[48:09] now he comes to a difficult time
[48:13] with it with his son with the
[48:14] commandments of god with the word that
[48:16] he's been given how that he has to apply
[48:17] it to his son
[48:18] the things that he's asked to do as a
[48:20] father the things that he's going to ask
[48:21] his son to do and to be obedient to
[48:24] and if you can notice abraham never
[48:26] appears to panic
[48:29] why he had wisdom and i want you to see
[48:31] how confident abraham was in verse 1
[48:34] 22 genesis 22 verse 1 and it came to
[48:36] pass after these things that god did
[48:37] tempt abraham
[48:38] instead of no abraham and you'll see
[48:40] this happen i think at least three
[48:42] different times
[48:43] abraham says here i am
[48:46] whether it's son his son or god he said
[48:49] behold here i am
[48:50] and god speaks take now thy son thy only
[48:53] son
[48:53] isaac whom thou love it's very
[48:55] interesting that god is
[48:56] not regarding the the son of
[49:00] of hey garit oh ishmael thy only son
[49:04] isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into
[49:06] the land of moriah
[49:08] and offer him there for a burnt offering
[49:11] this is not ambiguous it's very plain
[49:13] sacrifice your son upon one of the
[49:16] mountains which i'll tell you of
[49:19] offer your son as a burnt offering
[49:23] i believe the bible is very specific in
[49:25] the way this is written
[49:26] to convey to us something about abraham
[49:28] because the very next verse
[49:30] is not abraham pleading with god but
[49:32] says and abraham
[49:33] rose up early in the morning the very
[49:36] next
[49:37] action by abraham is god this is what
[49:39] you told me to do there's no disputing
[49:41] there's no wrestling
[49:42] it doesn't say and a week later abraham
[49:44] finally got up enough resolve to do what
[49:46] god had said
[49:47] immediately god speaking to him maybe
[49:49] coming to him in a vision that night or
[49:50] in a dream that night
[49:51] as soon as he raises up we ought to have
[49:53] this understanding
[49:54] that god comes to abraham and says to do
[49:57] something
[49:58] and the very next opportunity that
[50:00] abraham has to do it he rises up early
[50:02] in the morning he saddles his ass and
[50:04] took two of his young men with him and
[50:05] isaac his son
[50:06] claimed the wood for the burnt offering
[50:08] and rose up and went under the place of
[50:10] which god had told him
[50:11] in other words he got everything he
[50:12] needed
[50:14] he didn't just say well god told me to
[50:16] go sacrifice isaac on a hill and then
[50:19] drag his feet for a few days
[50:21] and then kind of feel the pressure well
[50:23] okay let's just go over here and show up
[50:25] with isaac
[50:26] and not have all the things that he
[50:27] would need he says god wants me to do
[50:29] this then i want to have everything i
[50:30] need for a burnt offering
[50:33] he brought young men with him he brought
[50:35] the wood that he would need he has
[50:36] everything with him including isaac and
[50:38] he went into the place which god had
[50:39] told him this is wisdom and action
[50:41] very confident even in the face of let's
[50:43] just all admit it
[50:44] this is a pretty wild thing to have to
[50:46] do am i the only one who's like
[50:49] kill your son but remember
[50:53] had because we wrestle with this right
[50:55] man god tempted abraham and well
[50:57] god didn't let him kill abraham or he
[51:00] killed his son isaac
[51:01] because if he had and we have all sorts
[51:03] of explanations and rationales
[51:05] as to why uh what would happen if
[51:07] abraham had succeeded
[51:09] but let's just be real real talk with
[51:11] brother aaron
[51:13] if abraham had been allowed to kill
[51:15] isaac
[51:17] whatever god says is truth and whatever
[51:20] god does
[51:20] is just let's never argue and
[51:23] rationalize with god in his word and
[51:25] what he says
[51:27] and what he establishes i'm grateful it
[51:29] didn't happen
[51:31] but had god asked him to do it and
[51:33] abraham succeeded we would have just
[51:35] said he did what god said for him to do
[51:37] and if that becomes father for the
[51:38] critic
[51:40] god's god he's the one that wrote this
[51:44] word he's the one that put in the
[51:45] scripture he's the one that asked
[51:46] abraham to do it but what we want to
[51:47] recognize is this is the wisdom of
[51:49] abraham
[51:50] verse 4 then on the third day this
[51:52] wasn't just a short journey
[51:54] he's had to think about this there's
[51:56] plenty of opportunity in the scripture
[51:57] for him said then abraham went back and
[51:59] abraham went here and abraham said this
[52:00] and abraham said that
[52:01] no it seems very purposeful he is
[52:03] preparing wisdom is giving him the
[52:05] confidence to prepare to make provision
[52:07] then on the third day abraham lifted up
[52:09] his eyes and saw the place so far off
[52:11] why because god had showed it to him
[52:13] and abraham said unto us his young men
[52:15] he brought the two men with him
[52:16] abide ye here with the ass and i in the
[52:19] lad
[52:20] will go yonder and i and the lad will
[52:22] worship and i believe it's appropriate
[52:24] to say and i
[52:25] am the lad will come again to you
[52:28] now if he's not sure how to express it i
[52:31] know that it's been
[52:32] preached and it's been offered that when
[52:33] he says i am the lad will go in worship
[52:36] that he's saying by this confession i am
[52:37] the lad will come again to you
[52:39] but he knows one thing is for sure he
[52:41] must go he must sacrifice
[52:43] and then he must return he's got to do
[52:45] what god said
[52:47] and abraham took the wood of the burnt
[52:48] offering this is wisdom taking all the
[52:50] things that are necessary
[52:51] not trying to skirt around it i'm not
[52:53] getting up there saying oh well
[52:55] i forgot the wood god i guess i gotta go
[52:57] three days all the way back home to the
[52:59] firewood pit
[53:00] you know i gotta get some firewood sorry
[53:02] god if you you've got time now it can
[53:04] take three days to go get it three days
[53:05] to come back you've got six days to
[53:06] change your mind god
[53:07] no he's preparing god told me to do it
[53:09] this is wisdom
[53:11] i gotta do everything this is what he
[53:13] wants me to do i've got to have the
[53:14] things necessary this is wisdom from
[53:16] above this is what i've got to do this
[53:17] is what i've got to do
[53:18] he takes the wood for the burnt offering
[53:20] and he lays it upon isaac his son and
[53:22] now he's already portraying how god is
[53:24] going to lay the sins of the world on
[53:25] his son jesus
[53:28] he's acting out the wisdom of god and in
[53:30] doing so he's foreshadowing
[53:32] the seed of abraham which is christ upon
[53:35] whom all the sins of the world will be
[53:37] laid
[53:39] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[53:40] knife wisdom
[53:42] is making the right kind of preparation
[53:45] a fool could be raging every step of the
[53:47] way
[53:47] abraham going yeah father of nations
[53:49] yeah whatever i can't believe he's
[53:51] asking me to do this i should have just
[53:52] been happy with ishmael and a full
[53:54] raging in his folly
[53:56] but this is what wisdom does even in the
[53:58] face of being asked to do one of the
[54:00] most
[54:01] difficult irrational things that we
[54:03] could ponder
[54:04] abraham is acting very purposely very
[54:06] diligently
[54:08] very confidently if i must
[54:11] do this then i've got to have wood i've
[54:13] got to have fire
[54:14] got to have a knife
[54:18] and they went both of them together
[54:22] and isaac spake unto abraham his father
[54:24] and said my father
[54:26] and here he says again here am i my son
[54:30] and he said behold the fire and the wood
[54:33] but where is the lamb for a burnt
[54:36] offering
[54:37] i don't know if isaac is starting to
[54:39] think okay
[54:40] where's this whole thing going but he's
[54:43] asking the right kind of question
[54:45] maybe isaac doesn't have enough
[54:46] knowledge he doesn't have enough wisdom
[54:48] isn't privy to the things that god has
[54:50] been asking abraham to do but this is
[54:52] just like children this is just like the
[54:53] things that can arise in a household
[54:55] i'm doing what god's asked me to do i'm
[54:57] doing the best that i can with what
[54:58] god's revealed and you get asked certain
[55:00] questions
[55:00] well where's the lamb for burnt offering
[55:03] do parents always have the answers to
[55:05] all your children's questions
[55:06] this one doesn't
[55:12] behold the fire and the wood but where
[55:14] is the lamb for burnt offering and now
[55:15] notice just how beautiful
[55:17] abraham's response is abraham said my
[55:20] son
[55:21] god will provide himself a lamb
[55:24] for a burnt offering so they both of
[55:27] them
[55:27] went both of them together
[55:31] this is an extraordinary claim now we've
[55:33] already read where this goes in the next
[55:35] few verses
[55:35] but this is an extraordinary claim in
[55:38] the face of what god had asked abraham
[55:40] to do
[55:41] and in the face of everything he's doing
[55:43] in these affirmative steps to do it he's
[55:45] not languishing he's not fighting he's
[55:46] not wrestling asking god to reconsider
[55:48] he's doing exactly what god asked him to
[55:50] do he says my son
[55:52] god will provide he's declaring a very
[55:55] simple yet very robust and strong
[55:57] confidence in god
[56:01] this is the rest that wisdom affords
[56:05] he come to a place where he could trust
[56:07] in god trust in his promises trust what
[56:09] he has to say
[56:10] even in the face of this is not going
[56:11] the way that i thought it would this
[56:12] isn't happening the way that i
[56:14] wanted it to and the thought process
[56:16] that he could begin to engage in in his
[56:18] mind
[56:18] if you slay your son how can god keep
[56:20] his promise to you
[56:22] and your seed how it can be as many as
[56:24] the stars of heaven
[56:25] abraham says jehovah will see to it
[56:29] how can you be the father of many
[56:31] nations he had already been pondering
[56:33] this with each day that passed
[56:34] when he rose up early in the morning all
[56:36] these voices bombarding him
[56:38] jehovah will see to it as he went to get
[56:41] the wood and saddle his ass and get the
[56:42] young servants and get isaac
[56:44] how are you ever going to explain
[56:45] yourself jehovah will see to it
[56:47] with each day that passed 24 hours 48
[56:50] hours
[56:51] 72 hours every question every scenario
[56:54] every challenge every worry every fear
[56:57] jehovah will see to it
[57:00] how will you go back home to your wife
[57:03] how will you go to sarah
[57:04] and return home with the blood of your
[57:07] son upon your hands
[57:08] and answer her questions jehovah will
[57:11] see to it
[57:13] hallelujah this is the confidence
[57:18] and this is the way that he met every
[57:20] distrust
[57:22] this is the way that he met every
[57:23] suspicion this is the way that he met
[57:26] every criticism he knew right where he
[57:28] was standing and even if he didn't have
[57:30] the exact answer
[57:31] he said jehovah will see to it i'm
[57:34] standing right where he wants me to
[57:35] stand i'm doing exactly what he wants me
[57:37] to do
[57:38] jehovah will see to it how are you going
[57:41] to meet your neighbors abraham
[57:43] you've testified the father of nations
[57:45] you've testified and professed
[57:46] to be a holy man how are you going to
[57:48] face servants and nations and people
[57:50] being a murderer of your own son jehovah
[57:54] will see to it
[57:59] so when he comes to slay isaac he
[58:02] stopped
[58:05] and as he had already spoken it i let me
[58:07] just maybe express it this way
[58:09] this is what's in his heart this is the
[58:11] answer to every question
[58:13] this is the answer to his
[58:14] rationalizations this is the answer to
[58:16] his own
[58:16] wrestling within his heart jehovah will
[58:18] see to it jehovah will see to it
[58:21] so that when his son finally asks him
[58:24] his answer is instinctive
[58:25] my son god will see to it
[58:29] god will provide trusting to him
[58:34] sure enough as he went to slay his son
[58:37] his hand is stopped and behold
[58:39] a ram caught in a thicket and he offers
[58:42] that lamb
[58:43] or that ram and in verse 14 it says and
[58:45] abraham called the name of that place
[58:48] jehovah jireh
[58:52] and we say my provider but has
[58:55] has such a rich meaning to it jehovah
[58:58] jireh
[58:59] and this is what they say as it is as it
[59:02] is
[59:02] said to this day in the mount of the
[59:05] lord it shall be seen
[59:07] and the very strict simple
[59:11] translation of jehovah jireh is jehovah
[59:14] sees
[59:17] jehovah knows abraham had been saying it
[59:20] long before he ever named the place he'd
[59:23] been saying in his heart as the answer
[59:25] to every mistrust
[59:26] every personal doubt to every wrestling
[59:28] to every question to every anxiety
[59:30] to every fear jehovah sees jehovah sees
[59:34] jehovah sees and when his son finally
[59:36] asks him
[59:37] what is going to happen dad how are you
[59:39] going to sacrifice
[59:40] my son god will provide his jehovah gyra
[59:44] he knows he'll see to it that when he
[59:47] finally comes to the place and god has
[59:49] come upon the scene
[59:50] and the lord provide provided a ram to
[59:53] be sacrificed he had already had the
[59:55] theme
[59:55] mulling over in his heart as one who was
[59:58] confident and trusting to god
[59:59] he named the place jehovah jireh in the
[1:00:02] mount of lord it shall be seen
[1:00:04] jehovah sees jehovah knows
[1:00:09] this is how we ought to be as believers
[1:00:11] god knows
[1:00:13] god sees it's not that he sees your sins
[1:00:16] and your mistakes and all the things
[1:00:17] that you've done
[1:00:18] he knows he has the provision jehovah
[1:00:21] sees
[1:00:21] he sees what the promise is he sees the
[1:00:24] provision
[1:00:24] that's who we're trusting to how we're
[1:00:26] going to get out of this how are we
[1:00:27] going to make it work
[1:00:29] jehovah will see to it you think about
[1:00:32] the sacrifices we make as parents you
[1:00:34] think about the loneliness we experience
[1:00:35] as believers and trusting to him and
[1:00:38] keeping his word to the things that we
[1:00:39] go through and being obedient to god
[1:00:41] don't ever forget that jehovah sees
[1:00:47] don't ever forget that he knows he's
[1:00:50] jehovah jireh
[1:00:54] he sees that's why moses even comes back
[1:00:56] later and even expresses it
[1:00:58] in the mount of the lord it shall be
[1:01:00] seen
[1:01:03] why jehovah sees in other words
[1:01:07] jehovah jireh we say my provider
[1:01:11] jehovah will see to it jehovah will make
[1:01:15] a way
[1:01:17] i want to read to you something it's not
[1:01:18] very lengthy but this is what i'd like
[1:01:20] to close with it's
[1:01:22] from a sermon that charles spurgeon
[1:01:23] preached in october 12
[1:01:25] 1884 it's my mother's birthday not in
[1:01:28] 1884 but october 12th
[1:01:32] but he preached a sermon called jehovah
[1:01:34] jireh
[1:01:36] and he and he he's working from verse 14
[1:01:40] but he refers to verse eight my son god
[1:01:43] will provide
[1:01:45] now listen i i feel just to read this
[1:01:47] paragraph to you in its entirety
[1:01:49] that first utterance was most remarkable
[1:01:53] it was simple enough but how prophetic
[1:01:56] it teaches us this truth are you
[1:01:59] listening
[1:02:01] that the confident speech of a believer
[1:02:04] is akin to the language of a prophet
[1:02:08] the confident speech of a believer is
[1:02:11] like
[1:02:12] the utterances it's like the speech is
[1:02:14] like the tongue of a prophet
[1:02:16] the confident speech of a believer the
[1:02:19] man who accepts the promise of god
[1:02:21] unstagnantly and is sure that it is true
[1:02:25] will speak like the seers of old
[1:02:29] he will see that god sees and will
[1:02:32] declare
[1:02:33] the fact and the holy inference which
[1:02:36] comes of
[1:02:37] it even if he doesn't have the answer
[1:02:40] even if he's not sure even if he doesn't
[1:02:42] know he can say my son
[1:02:44] god sees and that gives them the
[1:02:47] confidence that he needs
[1:02:48] because he accepts the promises of god
[1:02:51] without staggering
[1:02:52] he is sure that his promise is true then
[1:02:54] he can speak like the prophets of old
[1:02:56] he will see not what god sees
[1:02:59] but that he sees
[1:03:03] and he will declare the fact that he
[1:03:05] sees
[1:03:07] what are we going to do with our family
[1:03:08] what are we going to do about this what
[1:03:09] are we going to do that jehovah knows
[1:03:12] jehovah sees listen if we can't make all
[1:03:15] the promises we can to our children we
[1:03:17] can't make all the promises we want to
[1:03:18] our wife
[1:03:19] we can at least instill in them a
[1:03:21] confidence in his promise that he knows
[1:03:24] and he sees
[1:03:26] we demonstrate a confidence not because
[1:03:28] we've got it figured out not because we
[1:03:30] know
[1:03:30] we see what he sees but we know that he
[1:03:32] does see
[1:03:35] so he continues the believer's childlike
[1:03:37] assurance
[1:03:39] will anticipate the future
[1:03:42] hallelujah his childlike assurance
[1:03:46] just as that wise woman will rejoice in
[1:03:49] the time to come
[1:03:50] she laughs at the future so far from
[1:03:52] apprehension that she can look forward
[1:03:55] to a joyful confidence
[1:03:58] she looks forward to the future without
[1:03:59] anxiety she does it with a
[1:04:01] confident joy believers childlike
[1:04:03] assurance
[1:04:04] will anticipate the future and his plain
[1:04:07] statement
[1:04:08] god will provide will turn out to be
[1:04:12] literal truth
[1:04:17] literal truth if you want to come near
[1:04:21] to prophesy and listen to this believers
[1:04:23] if you want to come near to prophesying
[1:04:26] hold you
[1:04:26] hard to the promise of god if you want
[1:04:30] to be like these
[1:04:31] those that accept the promise of god
[1:04:35] and those that that take this truth of
[1:04:37] genesis 22
[1:04:39] 8-14 that the confident speech of a
[1:04:41] believer is like the tongue of a prophet
[1:04:43] if you want to come near to prophesy
[1:04:45] hold fast hold hard to the promise of
[1:04:47] god
[1:04:47] and you shall prophesy according to the
[1:04:50] measure of faith
[1:04:52] he that can say i know and am sure
[1:04:56] that god will not fail me in this my
[1:04:59] hour of tribulation
[1:05:00] will before long drop pearls of divine
[1:05:03] confidence
[1:05:04] in diamonds of prediction from his lips
[1:05:07] i'm so glad this just isn't some
[1:05:10] preacher and houston oh brother oh joel
[1:05:12] osteen i'm talking about you
[1:05:14] who's just trying to make me happy and
[1:05:16] just speak positive
[1:05:17] and have the right things to say i'm
[1:05:19] glad it's charles spurgeon october 12
[1:05:21] 1884 who's just taken the wrong truth of
[1:05:24] the bible
[1:05:25] it says somebody who could stand on the
[1:05:26] word and say i know and i'm sure
[1:05:29] that god will not fail me in my hour of
[1:05:31] testing
[1:05:32] shall be able to drop pearls of divine
[1:05:34] confidence in
[1:05:35] diamonds of prediction from his lips
[1:05:38] away with the bundles of thousands and
[1:05:40] all the diamond hands and all the pearls
[1:05:42] and all the riches
[1:05:43] and all the things that money can buy
[1:05:45] this is the kind of riches i want
[1:05:47] the diamonds of prediction from my lips
[1:05:50] that god will provide
[1:05:56] choice saiyans which become proverbs in
[1:05:58] the church
[1:06:00] are not the offspring of mistrust
[1:06:03] but a firm confidence in the living god
[1:06:07] listen he says to this day many a saying
[1:06:09] of a man
[1:06:10] of god is quoted among us even as
[1:06:13] abraham's word was quoted
[1:06:15] moses puts it as it is to this day in
[1:06:17] the mount of the lord it shall be seen
[1:06:20] and we might mention many a sentence
[1:06:22] which is said
[1:06:23] unto this day which first fell from the
[1:06:26] mouth of a faithful spirit
[1:06:29] in the hour of the manifestation of the
[1:06:31] lord
[1:06:32] now listen each one i'm closing here the
[1:06:34] speech
[1:06:35] of the father of the faithful
[1:06:38] became the speech of a spiritual seed
[1:06:41] for many a year afterwards and it abides
[1:06:45] in the family of faith unto this day
[1:06:50] what was abraham basin it on what did
[1:06:53] abraham have to show
[1:06:55] he had he had everything it took
[1:06:57] including the request
[1:06:59] of god to sacrifice his son upon the
[1:07:01] altar but he still said
[1:07:03] jehovah will see to it
[1:07:06] and the speech of the father the
[1:07:08] faithful the speech of the father of our
[1:07:09] faith
[1:07:10] has become our speech as the spiritual
[1:07:12] seed
[1:07:13] today he says and it abides in the
[1:07:16] family of the faith
[1:07:17] unto this day if we have
[1:07:21] full faith in god we shall teach
[1:07:24] seceding generations
[1:07:26] to expect jehovah's hand to be stretched
[1:07:29] out still
[1:07:31] that's what i want to teach that's what
[1:07:33] i want you
[1:07:35] as being sheep in this church what i
[1:07:37] want you to come to expect
[1:07:38] is that jehovah's hand is going to be
[1:07:40] stretched out still not to flinch and be
[1:07:42] afraid of the
[1:07:43] the smilings of god and the rebuke of
[1:07:45] god in the chastisement of god
[1:07:47] but know that he reaches when he reaches
[1:07:48] out his hand is to assist
[1:07:50] it's to aid it's to benefit it's to help
[1:07:53] this is what we desire to teach our
[1:07:55] children this is what we desire to
[1:07:57] promote within our homes
[1:07:58] is that we having full faith in god will
[1:08:01] teach our children
[1:08:02] to expect that jehovah's hand is
[1:08:05] stretched out still to them
[1:08:07] and that we have this conviction and
[1:08:09] this faith that jehovah will see to it
[1:08:11] why are you teaching your daughter to
[1:08:13] live that way why are you teaching your
[1:08:14] sons to do that why do you deprive them
[1:08:16] of this why do you put lift up that
[1:08:18] why do you read your bible and pray with
[1:08:20] it why do you do this
[1:08:21] why do you do that god will provide
[1:08:25] jehovah will see if we could stand to
[1:08:28] our feet
[1:08:30] jehovah will see
[1:08:33] god will provide
[1:08:40] with our heads bowed
[1:08:47] could we make that our confession of
[1:08:49] faith right now our spiritual language
[1:08:52] that if we are perfectly and completely
[1:08:55] trusted in god
[1:08:57] and we have a firm confidence in the
[1:08:59] living god
[1:09:02] then we can drop pearls of divine
[1:09:04] confidence
[1:09:07] let's do that tonight let's talk to him
[1:09:12] and drop pearls of divine confidence
[1:09:15] and as we do that diamonds of prediction
[1:09:20] come from our lips what kind
[1:09:25] god will provide himself
[1:09:29] a lamb
[1:09:32] was it in that moment abraham hadn't
[1:09:35] rationalized with it
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:38] hadn't tried to figure it out hadn't
[1:09:40] been there before and knew
[1:09:42] that there was a lot of rams in that
[1:09:44] mountain
[1:09:45] but could it be that every time he met
[1:09:47] this spirit of doubt he said
[1:09:49] god will provide how are you going to
[1:09:51] explain yourself to your wife
[1:09:53] jehovah will see to it how are you going
[1:09:55] to explain yourself to your neighbors
[1:09:57] and your servants jehovah will see to it
[1:09:59] if i'm doing what he's asked he will see
[1:10:02] to it
[1:10:03] if i'm doing what he asked he will see
[1:10:06] to it
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:08] because he had practiced this discipline
[1:10:10] and this confidence and this character
[1:10:13] and had dropped all these pearls of
[1:10:15] divine confidence within a spirit that
[1:10:17] when it came time
[1:10:19] to answer the very difficult question
[1:10:21] from the lips of the sun that he would
[1:10:23] soon lay upon an altar to slay
[1:10:26] he spoke with these
[1:10:29] diamonds of prediction and prophecy god
[1:10:33] jehovah will provide himself a ram
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:40] he will provide himself a lamb a
[1:10:43] sacrifice an offering
[1:10:48] he will provide himself a lamb
[1:10:51] for burnt offering
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:56] could we tonight demonstrate that we
[1:11:02] with childlike assurance will anticipate
[1:11:04] the future
[1:11:05] we with the confident speech of a
[1:11:07] believer
[1:11:07] [Music]

[1:12:28] in its best lord i'm even reminded how
[1:12:32] that with my own children
