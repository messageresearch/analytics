TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Acts chapter 7 thank you musicians Acts chapter 7 I'd like to read verses 1 to6 Acts chapter 17 Acts chapter 17 veres 1-6 my title today is pure joy and so overwhelmed with the subject matter and there's so much um so many ditions to it and breth to it uh that I know that this will just be the first part um and on this subject and Lord willing to speak many different services on pure joy and amplify that more but then my subject or subtitle is invert always invert and hopefully that'll make some sense to you here in a little bit uh but our sub our title is pure joy that's a subject matter and then a kind of a subtitle is invert always invert acts chap 17 veres 1 to6 and when they had passed through amphipolis and appollonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the Jews and Paul as his manner was went unto them and three Sabbath day Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ wow powerful and some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas and of The Devout Greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few but the Jews which believed not moved with Envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort thank you Luke for that uh rare insult certain lwd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people and when they found them not they drew Jason and certain Brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also think about that phrase these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also amen God bless you you may have your seats these that have turned the world upside down I'm ministering on and beginning to look at the subject of pure joy and I'd like to make maybe just a few comments at the outset to express how God's been dealing with with my heart on this subject of joy and the way that it's impressed me is in looking at it even in the sense of pure joy it's about fully experiencing the joy of the Lord amid all the chaos that surrounds us and the confusion uh that seems to be so near whether it be criticism or some sort of Confrontation and even maybe in the midst of conflict some sort of warfare that we could find that there is this steadiness and there's this consistency of pure joy and scripture if in looking at the word joy in the Old Testament and we hold true in the Hebrew as well and Greek that pure joy is a gladness it is a joy is a gladness it is a rejoicing and so when we say pure joy we're talking about a gladness or rejoicing a happiness even that is not born of dissonance where in our minds we're trying to uh you know plate ourselves and keep us from being conscious of certain things it's not a a carnal mechanism of a dissonance or even a f a psychological defense where we have psychological immunity where we try to protect ourselves and keep ourselves from feeling pain and convincing ourselves yeah I I I'm really happy with the fact that my house burnt down it's great no it's wonderful that's not what I'm talking about when I'm talk about joy and those kind of mechanisms but rather I'm talking about a pure joy which Finds Its Genesis in the Divi in in the Divine so it's a joy that has a Divine gen Divine Genesis it begins in God it's a joy that's more than an emotion so part of this is is we kind of use this as a a basis it's a joy that's more than an emotion but it's it's an abiding condition something permanent something firm something real and as I've been studying the subject of Joy there's there's so many different components and facets to it one began to stand out to me that I found in the message of the hour and I just want to address it very quickly brother Ram makes the statement Brethren we've had churches bubble dancing long enough think about that we've had the church's bubble dancing bubble dance long enough we got to get down to something real then things all right so bubble dance is all right says but we got to get down to Something Real it's the joy of the Lord many times instead of the power of the Lord and brother man makes a few statements where he's identifying a a joy of the Lord that can be expressed in in excitement and exuberance and and some sort of physical manifestation jumping shouting praising rejoicing and those things and he's saying you can have this joy of the Lord Dynamic wherein the spirit of God will be poured out upon All Flesh and people can get excited and they can dance and they can shout even as he says here the we've had the church's bubble dance and he says but we've got to have something real you can have Bubble dancing he said it's all right nothing against bubble dancing but you need something real and he's identifying a power of God so he's this is the uh this is how he's setting it there's a joy of the Lord many times but it's not the power of the Lord so he's identifying in these different statements an emotional Dynamic that produces an excitement that's temporal where a spirit the spirit can move in service and people shout and people dance and people get all excited and we even say my I didn't even know she was could get loud like that I didn't know that brother could dance and and we see something maybe we don't normally see manifest in people's lives but there's a different side where he says it's the power of the Lord that uh that's different than this move he says in another place the spirit of the lord it's anointing many people don't understand what anointing means they think it means to shout and he says that's Joy so some people think anointed is shouting and sweating and expression and and and let's just be honest that there's a way that sometimes we view S Services and if they don't get loud the people Don't Clap the people don't shout people don't cry if there's people not at the altar if you don't have a prayer line the meetings were a flop however it is sometimes we're looking to the outside and the external to determine whether or not the the anointing was really there he like well I don't even know if he was anointed at all he didn't even sweat but somehow if the guy's sweating and his tie gets a skew and he takes his coat off and we're like man he just seemed to be so anointed no it was just humid or he was hot and he needs to lose some weight or something it doesn't always have to be the anointing but he's saying that's a that that they think that means to shout he says that's Joy then he says power comes solemn that's the joy of the Lord this is the power of the Lord healing making well and he uses this line when he's looking at how when the spirit of God can move in a meeting shouting and there's Charisma and there's excitement and physical exercise and he's doing this from the basis of even his own Ministry because you'll find that whenever it came time for prayer lines and it came time for healing and the power of God to move there wasn't a bunch of shouting and carrying on everything got very sober and very solemn and brother brandham is saying this is different with the power of God it's more quiet it's more sober it's more solemn and brother Craig Boer brought it to my attention one time he was expressing his heart on things and he says you know we don't do prayer lines in the message like brother brandham did prayer lines and it really kind of caught my attention I kind of expounded a little bit on on how the Lord was dealing with his heart because you'll find that in those prayer lines that it was more sober it was more quiet it was more solemn the word had the uh the focus a and the promise of God was what was was being enacted was being done but then there's a certain way that prayer lines anymore is just who can hit the person the hardest with their Palm without them noticing that that's exactly what you did uh my dad tells the story one time he' just come to the Lord and just come to the message and he hadn't been around the charismatic side of of the gospel and hadn't been in Pentecost or anything and he said there was a sister come through the prayer line he's just a young preacher he's up there and this sister was going through going my dad you know CES her coming along and he puts his hand on he says bless God he said Heavenly Father heal her neck in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and she straightened right up like and then my dad looked at her and said praise God like he's already healed that Twitch in her neck and and so there's a way that brother Bam's recognizing that there can be a move of God where people are shouting they're they're screaming they're running the aisles they're praising he says that's the joy of the Lord says but then there's also a dynamic of the power of God and it's more sober it's more solemn and he's addressing the manifestation of a spirit how a spirit would move in a service the moving of the spirit in a service and how people would inter interact with it and how that they would rejoice and Shout now with identifying that distinction there is a joy which is power the Bible says the joy of the Lord is my strength there is a joy which is power there is a joy which is manifested in the same solemn power that brother bradam is talking about and it's a joy that transcends emotion it it's not a joy of the spirit where I'm exuding and I'm excited I feel good today and I and I feel like shouting but it's a joy that's deeper than that and it transcends just the type of emotions that we have says in Hebrews chap 12:2 who for the joy speaking of Jesus Christ the author and the finisher of our faith I want just to take this piece out of that scripture who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross now this is different than Jesus looking forward to a time where he would dance and he would shout and because this bubble dance is coming up I'm going to be so I'm so excited for the bubble dance that's not the joy which was set before him who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross so Christ had a case or occasion to Joy and that's what gave him the per that's what allowed him to persevere past the suffering and the reproach and the word Joy there is also used to persons who are one's Joy so he says for the joy which was set before him you can say this is you for this Pride this joy in the in and his his desire to see you and his and in your election and your predestination with that Joy set before him this abiding condition this permanence this something that transcends emotion like oh once I get through this I'll feel better we don't want to make ourselves hurt just so that we can appreciate not hurting and so he's saying for the joy which was set before him it wasn't an emotion it was something greater than that and so when we talk about pure joy we're not talking an exuberance and an exaltation we're identifying something deeper than that that a believer holds deep within their hearts and it allows them to go forward in such a chaotic time there is a pure joy do you believe that there is a pure joy and there are things that stand between you and pure joy and this is where taking just a little bit of a turn to focus on a um H maybe a little kind of a preamble on this subject there's a pure joy and there's someone that wants to stand in the way of your pure joy in the message greatest battle ever fought and a lot of the things that we're pondering uh today are from this message greatest battle ever fought brother remember says Satan Army brings diseases so I've laid my Foundation now you could if you didn't have that background of pure joy I still think this would just resonate with you as a separate subject but let's just begin to think about this a little bit Satan's Army brings diseases That's what Satan is he's a destroyer so Ponder these attributes and characteristics of Satan he has an army he's bringing disease he's a destroyer Satan the whole Kingdom of Satan is sickness death and sorrow and frustrations and worry all of Satan if we were kind of just stacking up uh uh characteristics and doing pros and cons these are all the all the negative sides of life and these are the things that are represented by Satan's kingdom sickness death sorrow frustrations and worry disease he's a destroyer and then on the other hand God is life Faith joy peace over here now if we could just imagine it that this is a battle a battle's being set in Array and you have on one side the Destroyer you have disease you have sickness you have sorrow you have frustration you have worry and you have death this is the negative things but then you have on the other side the positive side which is God in life Faith joy peace over here and one's on one side and one's on the other and what are these they're opposites this is what I want you to begin to ponder why are they opposites because we could focus so much well Satan is a destroyer and Satan has sickness and he has sorrow and he has frustration and he has worry but why do those things even exist worry only exists because there's peace fear only exists because there's Faith death only exists because there's life the these different characteristics in natur Satan is a destroyer because God is a Creator and and and that this is where I'm starting to kind of get into my my thought about invert always invert but I want you to just before we get there think on one hand you have all these dirty vile filthy horrible characteristics but then you have on the other side God is life Faith joy peace over here those things only exist because there's a positive side and we're not just focusing on Satan's AR he's got death he's got disease he's got sorrow he's got sickness why do these things even exist within his army why would these things even show up and begin to press Upon Our psyche or our experience our lives and our family in our experience why are these things even encro seem to be encroaching consider that now in Revelations 2: 24 he says but I say unto you in this description of the theran age but I say unto you and unto the rest in thyra as many as have not this Doctrine in which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden and that we know there's a lot of depth to this statement but I want to focus on how he says we have not known the depths of Satan brother bam points out how that none of the commentators have anything to say about this look at commentaries you look at uh things that people say and in his study he found that there's not a lot of people trying to express what the depths of Satan were and this is how he approaches it now catch this let us first know what the depth of God is and the opposite will be true for the depth of Satan so we can read the scripture and say well we have not known the depths of Satan and we can be like oh well let's figure this out don't you want to know the depths of Satan let's know how how deep it goes and how horrible it is and how dark it is and let let's get into this let's roll up our sleeves and let's really really wrestle this out let's have a weekl long retreat for Ministry to kind of figure out what the depths of Satan are and you could approach it from that standpoint we want to know the depths of Satan so let's get into his thoughts and his attributes and his characteristics and all the things that we could see through history and our own experience and things in the scripture but brother bam says no you don't need to figure out and study the depths of Satan all you need to know first is what the depth of God is and if you know the depth of God then you could just take the opposite and know the depth of Satan if you could just if you just approach it as well if Satan is I if Satan is the opposite then I don't need to know everything about Satan to know the depth of it I just need to know everything I need to know about truth to know that the opposite is how deep Satan will go now in this he he quotes from Ephesians chapter 3: 16 to 18 and I've excluded it because he begins he kind of summarizes it in the next few statements now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling in him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word but the depth of Satan will be in that he will attempt to destroy this so there's only a depth of Satan because there's a deepness to God there's only a lie because there's a truth and he says this this actual personal experience of the spirit indwelling and Illuminating the Mind by wisdom and knowledge through the word the depth of Satan is his attempt to destroy this he will as always attempt to make a substitute for this reality of God how will he do it he will take away the knowledge of the truth of God destroy the word by putting forth his own yay hath God said this is very important to consider very important to ponder very deeply how is what what are the depths of Satan he's got to chip away at something that already exists he's a perverter he can't create he cannot derive his own truth he cannot come up with something of his own he can only work as a defiler and a perverter of Truth so if Satan has a gospel he's borrowing borrowing something about truth and perverting it and twisting it and adding something he doesn't have his own Messiah he can only pervert pervert the truth of the Messiah yeah hath God said he puts forth his own he will then substitute the personal Christ in our Spirits wow now that's that's a heavy statement we who are born again have the personal Christ in our spirits and what Satan wants to do is give you a substitute for that where I'm no longer enjoying that I'm no longer connected with that I'm no longer subject to that but he wants to give us a substitute for the personal Christ in our spirits and just in that way that if every action has an equal and opposite reaction we're getting scientific today then if there's some sort of Christ that's supposed to be in your heart that's supposed to have the preeminence and then Satan wants to do a substitute then there's something that kicks back and that's when you begin to know the depths of Despair that's when there's a sense of hopelessness when the personal Christ is substituted in our spirits and let me say if you have never come to know the Lord personally he's given you a substitute to keep you from it he says he will do it as he caused Israel to do the same by a human being reigning as King instead of God the Born Again experience what is the Born Again experience the spirit of God indwelling in you and your mind being illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word the Born Again experience will be rejected in favor of church joining it kind of makes it uh I mean maybe maybe it's easy for us to amen that because we we we we we believe that it's not just join in a church but I mean why can't the Born Again experience be rejected in favor of selling drugs you you didn't think about that you had thought about that why can't it be uh the Born Again experience will be directed in favor of rejecting Christ it's it puts it on a plan where man the devil's pretty shrewd isn't he born again experience is replaced with just church joining then and this is where the language begins to get very heavy the depths of Satan have been in had been entered into that age the depth of Satan had entered into the age and the fruit of that depth of Satan which are lies murders and horrible crimes came forth from it and somehow brother Bram is placing the depths of Satan on par of of joining Church on par with lies murders and horrible crimes that come from it now why do these things exist because the opposite of the depths of God where there's life and there's joy and there's there's satisfaction and there's power and there's righteousness the fruit of the depth of Satan there lies murders and horrible crimes they come forth from it but notice how the Born Again experience is usurped he replaces the personal Christ in our Spirits he destroys the word of God by putting forth his own he takes away the knowledge of the truth of God and he wants to substitute the reality of God for something else and that's what leads to the depth of Satan how is there any depth to Satan because there's such great depth to God so he says first know first know what the depth of God is this is the next slide there first know what the depth of God is and the opposite will be true for the depth of Satan and what is brother brandham doing when he takes this scripture they have not known the depths of Satan and instead of him saying well they haven't known it do we know it what does it mean what does it mean to know it he does not pursue the path of trying to figure out the depths of Satan he just says first know what the depth of God is and then you could just take the opposite for the truth of the depth of Satan this is inversion not perversion or conversion this is inversion inversion is the reversal of a position reversal of an order or even a reversal of a form or the reversal of a relationship the word invert it means to put upside down or in the opposite position the opposite order the opposite Arrangement so we're looking at well let's look at the deps of Satan brother man says well if you want to know the depths of Satan then just look at look at the depths of God he's changed the order he's changed the arrangement he's changed the view and so Carl jacobe he was a mathematician he had this phrase and it wasn't in English but this is what it translates to invert always invert and if you invert that it's invert always invert that's kind of the the cleverness to it so this is you say invert always invert and it was a maxim to describe an approach to difficult problems so invert always invert relates to things that are difficult to figure out problems hardships uh uh uh Pathways things that you're try you're wrestling with and trying to figure out and it speaks of how that many hard problems are best solved when addressed backwards and in instead of and it's it's just a different way of thinking things thinking about things it's the ter into things upside down that you have a problem and instead of trying to figure out a way to get to to to get to this or to figure this out you start in a different place than you normally would and work your way backwards I think it's Charles Munger who made the statement tell me where I'm going to die tell me the place I'm going to die and I'll always avoid it right and this is kind of the idea of working backwards and what we really really I really really want to do this I I I want to I want to be able to accomplish this I want to be able to have this instead of trying to figure out what's going to get you there you think about what's going to keep you from getting there what's going to stand in the way what's going to keep you from getting it and so this is the these are kind of the thoughts behind how a hard problem can be addressed through inversion or addressed backwards where you look at a problem well it's this way it's this way it's this way oh turn it around work backwards address it differently and this is so this is um this invert always invert this is where and even the idea of pure joy this is the foundation this is how how the Lord dealt with me on in this and we spoke about it very briefly Wednesday night I I've been pondering mind battles and in these mind battles and just how pervasive they can be if you have a battle in your mind it's it's a battle everywhere it's present with you it seems to both be internal and external it's mental and physical it's emotional it just seems to go everywhere and it it weighs down upon your soul it clouds your spirit it causes your body to feel heavy and to feel sick and so there's so much to mind battles and then I was pondering the greatest battle ever fought my wife had been listening to that we'd been fellowshipping on it and that's kind of how these things have been thinking about it and where the inversion part comes into it is I realize that we can view Warfare we can view the the battle and the fighting and the struggle in a way that brings additional discouragement or it's what causes the discouragement and and there's just so much I'd like to be able to share and I I have to just try to stay very disciplined that I I just don't kind of go here and go there because I want to express this the right way and and if you can relate and you can identify with this and and by all means nod aggressively if when when we find ourselves fighting when we're fighting and we're struggling and we're wrestling we're not all grins it's more of a Grimace and and we and I don't know that we that I don't know if any of us have ever answered when somewell how are you doing brother John it's like hey man I'm fighting woo right we just it's like oh man I'm really going through it I'm just really fighting the devil's just really working me over and we kind of have a way that we talk about it and the Very fact that we're fighting the very fact that they're Waring just the fact that there's a fight discourages us has nothing to do whether or not you're winning or what it's about it's just it's a fight and since it's a fight I'm discouraged and you find yourself becoming uh you know more Melancholy or or unmotivated because it's fighting or you find your faith slipping a little bit uh because you're actually fighting and this is a phrase that I've heard lately the devil is attacking my mind and different ones expressing this battle that they're in and things that they're going through and I'm not going to let the devil hide behind well you know about it so you shouldn't preach about it I certainly don't want to touch anything through my own Humanity my own opinion and my own emotions but a man of God studies and he prays and he sees the spots where the people are and he recognizes an attack and he says you know what devil we're going to shut you down we're just going to go ahead and address it and so the devil is say well the devil is attacking my mind and when we say that and it's and the reality is there's a Warfare taking place in the mind but there's a way that we view this Warfare and this battle where we're made to feel defensive like I'm being picked on I'm being poked I'm being prodded we're made to feel vulnerable like where did this come from I mean everything seem to be going well and all of a sudden I have this thought and this happens and that happens and we're made to feel weak because we find ourselves finding or at worst we're made to feel wrong well I must something must be wrong because I'm fighting something must be wrong because this is happening something must be wrong because this is taking place a a and with if you think I'm disqualifying that let me just say you need to be honest with your life if you're in a battle because you've wandered from the Wall come back to the wall we could certainly go into great depth in this but when Nehemiah and they were restoring the temple walls in the book of Nehemiah and they're restoring the temple they were hard at work and they were working and they had this uh this plan that whenever you hear the trumpet you you work with a hammer in one hand a sword in the other when you hear the trumpet fire on one side of the wall let's all run together and fight along the wall but then there was a letter that came and said hey you know why don't you meet meet me in the valley of Ono and they wanted Nehemiah to come down and meet in the valley and get him away from the wall and if you leave the work along the wall and you're fighting in the valley that's a battle you shouldn't be in and you're fighting now as like a reminder a red flag as a buffer as God saying stop you're in the wrong place get back along the wall some of us can be fighting because we haven't been obedient to the leadership of the Holy Spirit we know we're not where we need to be our family's not where it needs to be I'm not doing the things that I know a Believer ought to do and the Warfare is directly resulted with you leaving your position along the wall and you got to get back on the wall because if there's a battle along the wall there's a trumpet that sounds and there's support that comes to help you you're in the valley you're all on your own but the problem the way what I'm looking at is how that this battle the devil is attacking me how we're made to feel wrong but when we look at say I'm right where I believe the Lord wants me to be I'm doing what God wants me to be so what I'm suggesting today is a different perspective let's invert this this is this is a difficult trial this is a this is something we don't understand this is things that very Troublesome to our Spirits all right this is a hard problem let's invert let me say start by saying this you're not the victim when we look at it from the perspective the devil's attacking me you feel as if you've been assaulted you've been jumped and you've been sucker punched and you're the victim and the devil's given you put you you know kind of got you on the chin so you're made to feel like you're the victim you're not the victim we are not the ones being attacked this is where we mentioned just briefly Wednesday night and I want you to hold this phrase this is just kept coming to me over and over over and over again as I studied last week the word is the aggressor in this war oh the devil's attacking me I'm fighting I'm really going through it the word is the aggressor in this war in Acts chapter 17 is talking about how Paul uh came to thessalonica and he goes to the synagogue of the Jews he begins to teach about Christ that Christ suffered and that this Jesus is Christ and there's many that believed of the of the Greeks and chief women and then the Jews who didn't believe that they begin to look at what's happening they get all upset and they're and they growl everyone up against them and you think well Paul comes preaching and now they're being going to be persecuted and Jason's going to be brought out and they're going to be he's going to be scourged and they're going to be called out and going to be threatened with punishment but this is what they're saying hey these that have turned the world upside down have come hither Paul wasn't the hunted Jason wasn't the persecuted I want you to just kind of take this to really what how this should look look in your minds in this instance Paul was the aggressor Paul had brought the battle to thessalonica this whole thing is taking place because something's being stirred up and the way that they described Jason and all those that came with them is they turned the world upside down these have taken the order of things and completely rearranged them they have taken what we thought to be true what we thought to be right what we thought to be the proper order they have turned the world upside down what was taking place this was an inversion it was an invasion not of these Jews and let's just say it the way that Luke said it lewd fellows of the baser sort why were their lewd fellows of the baser sort even showing up because the word had come up the Jews would have never consorted with the the lewd fellows of A baser Sort if Paul hadn't showed up everything would just be fine everything would be normal everyone would be in their place but one day the word shows up in thessalonica the word begins to have the preeminence the word starts to be get lift up lies start to be torn down and Paul begins to preach the truth and now what happens hey go get the LW fellas of a baser swort we've got problems and it's then that the lud fellas of A baser Sort show up they said call The Brute Squad it's like I am the brute Squad right they're all showing up now now that now they're here now they're going to start causing problems why because their world had been turned upside down Paul wasn't hid away in the mountain somewhere Jason wasn't just minding in his own business doing what he wanted to do and keeping his head down no the word was the one that was causing the offense the word was the one that that was the aggressor and so when we look at this inverting this difficult problem these mind battles the things that we're going through Satan's attack may be him fighting back the the devil's bombarding my mind the the devil's attacking me maybe he's been attacked and now he's defending against the advancement of the word if you just would have left well Al alone and just left it alone if you just would have kept doing what you were doing if you wouldn't have red things up if you wouldn't have got more dedicated if you wouldn't had made a decision to serve God if you wouldn't have said Lord I know there's more for me and I want it if you hadn't made that difficult decision to stand for truth and make a decision in your family if you just would have kept your mouth shut and your feet still this never would have happened but something has moved forward in your life and now Satan is all of a sudden put on the defensive think about it that way oh the devil's attacking me the devil's attacking me no you're attacking the devil and you didn't realize it oh God the great Marinette he's got your dukes up and he's just moving you and he's causing you to give punches to the devil and you thought it was the devil who started the fight the greatest battle ever fought Bill Bram uses this principle goes how did Grant take Richmond there's a phrase like Grant took Richmond anyone ever heard that phrase you actually have okay great because I think that's kind of what brother Brandon was borrowing from I know we've had uh different Wars since then so we're not always just talking about Grant taking Richmond but it's when Grant took Richmond says like Grant took Richmond you'd say well he just came through here like Grant took Richmond think something decidedly determination quickly and so how did Grant take Richmond but this is this is the part I think is so beautiful just as he come to it Grant took Richmond Richmond didn't come to grant grant came to Richmond so in the greatest battle ever fought we're just not kind of sitting here you brother Aon I was just believing the word and just hanging out you know just chilling a villain and everything was great and everything was wonderful and I thought this was smooth and and then I'll boom all of a sudden I'm attacked now in your heart in your life you've come to Richmond said how did he take Richmond just as he come to it that's how God's soldiers take sin sickness and add whatever else you want to it Melancholy depression anxiety pressure financial troubles if you're going to conquer it it's going to be because you come to its door step we could spend a lot of Our Lives defending ourselves and fending off blows and we and oh I escaped this and oh I escaped that but there comes a point in a believer's life where you're no longer hiding and defending attacks but you go on the offensive there's definitely times in our lives when we're being under attack and there's things that we can say and do that put us on on the defensive I'm looking at a diff a difficult situation a problem a a wrestling that you're engaging in how that now it's not a matter of the battle coming to you but you've taken the battle yourself and you've Advanced to a particular position in this Warfare he says just as he come to it that's the way God's soldiers take sin sickness just as they come to it you're not sitting back waiting for sickness to come to you somehow in your life God has walked you to this not so that it would def deat you but so that you could defeat it just as they come to it that's the way they overcome their doubts that's the way they overcome their fears that's the way they overcome things how are you going to overcome things not by hiding out somewhere in an easy chair and they kind of show up and pester you and call your name and and chide you and spy on you and do these sneak attacks no you overcome it when you walk up to your doubt and you begin to defeat your doubt you overcome when you walk up to your fears and defeat your fears you overcome things as you come to things oh this fear is bother me this doubt has bothering me you picked to fight with fear or God did just like God did with job hey satan have you considered job did you hear what job said I had to say about you oh yeah he said he in yeah he said he could beat you up he said you could do whatever you want to him and he won't curse curse me and die oh is that what he said yeah you should I mean you going to let him do talk to you like that huh you going to let him do you like that and God's the one that set it up why was job attacked not because he was a sinner that's what all his friends wanted to tell them but because there was none like him invert just as they come to it they overcome doubts fears years and things when one Rises they chop them down move out of the way there's a there's a path forward something is moving forward and I was thinking about this last week no just kind of got me all stirred up we we love the Civil War as a family we've visited a lot of don't like we love war we love the history of the Civil War man we just really can't wait for another one we we love the history of the Civil War and the Civil War and in the capture of Richmond we think well how did Grant take Richmond they say well that that like Grant took Richmond and even some historians and different people kind of wrestle with the fact that how long it took for Richmond for them to get to Richmond and they think out this protracted battle and how late in the battle it was in 1965 before they finally overtook Richmond but the fall of Richmond was preceded by the siege of Petersburg and and I just want to use this historical Point hopefully it kind of light fire uh for some of you for nearly 300 days I it was 292 days at least that the two armies were entrenched from June 15th 1864 to April 2nd 1865 almost a year nearly a year both sides had been entrenched and so during this time the armies were entrenched over 40 miles my they dug in their positions the Confederates had their line the had their line and they just had these skirmishes so over 10 for over a period of 10 months nearly 70,000 soldiers spread out over 40 miles would just kind of do these little attacks and these little skirmishes and these attempts to flank but each one held their ground and held their position and for near nearly 10 months they built one of the most sophisticated systems of Earth Works ever seen in battle to even when it came time for the Great War they didn't call it World War I when the first started they didn't have the premonition well this is just the first of two World War I of two like how did you know that kind of like the coin don't ever buy a coin that's dated 400 BC just a pro tip for coin collectors they didn't know there was going to be a second one so they called it the Great War they actually established what was called camp Lee in this area to teach soldiers here in the 19 1900s teach them how to build bullworks and Earthworks and to create trenches because this was something very sophisticated and new in Warfare and it wasn't just go meet over here in battle and meet over there in battle now was taking these entrenchments and establishing themselves in strongholds and say this is the ground that we possess we're going to dig in here this is ours we're going to defend Petersburg we're going to set up this line this is where it's going to this is where it's going to happen and it's this long drawn out protracted Warfare Skirmish here Skirmish there attack here attack there but finally after 10 months St Petersburg was surrendered at dawn on April 3rd at Dawn on April 3rd Petersburg Falls nearly 300 days 70,000 men over 40 miles through 10 months fight and it's this entrenchment and this is their fortifications this is where they stand but in the dawn of April 3rd Petersburg Falls and by that night Richmond fell man I don't is lot about got a lot of rebels here I thought I might get a bless God or you know thank God for the union and right there let me make the spiritual application to get some amens think about it there was a long Siege where there was an entrenchment and it took a long time and there's different skirmishes but once that finally broke and it was uprooted from the stronghold that evening Grant Advanced to Richmond didn't take him days that the SE they the lines didn't crumble and then Grant they're all toasting each other this is great this is wonderful we got them out there and trenches no it was time to move forward and the next Target was Richmond so once the siege of Petersburg was over and the the rebels had surrendered it and they vacated their positions they weren't just happy oh they're gone they're out of their fox holes they're out of their trenches like no let's advance to Richmond so how did Grant take Richmond as soon as he came to it and that night Richmond fell why because there had been a stronghold that had been Tor down so it's time to go forward in the greatest battle ever fought brother R says take the word of God and cut your way through every doubt we're not laying around just trying to defend ourselves no you're cut your way through you got your eyes on something you're moving sure that's it I love the way he says it that's the next job let's get it done after this Siege of Petersburg the next job was Richmond this is the idea this is the example that the analogy brother brah is using for the believer that once you why is there a battle in Richmond why is there a fight in Richmond because you've come to it and you take it as you come to it so whatever battle you're in right now as a Believer who who's want serving God and doing all you can to serve him and you've turned over every Rock and you're you're trying to find what's wrong and you're wanting to do the things that are right before God but you find yourself being bombarded whatever the wherever the bombardment is coming from that's your next job let's get it done next thing I'm to do is get away from my doubts cut it down that's my next job is get all my frustrations away it just it's I mean notice the grace in this well brother Aaron I finally overcome doubt now I'm frustrated all the time you haven't gone backwards you've gone forwards so while I was struggling with doubt and now now that I've resolved my doubt and I've got faith now I'm dealing with frustration the only reason why you're able to deal with frustration is because you got doubt out of the way right I mean this isn't uh a video game where you're trying to get to the final boss and defeat him but in some ways if you trying to figure out what's going on here you've just defeated level one you're level two now it's not ah I thought that was the end of the game no you've you've graduated you matriculate to another battle another now that you have faith and you got doubt out of the way now you can really deal with frustration if you defeat frustration and you still have doubt you're just going to get frustrated again so he's walking you through these steps and these progressions of battles you got to get this done your doubts that's my next job frustration if all my senses tell me Well you feel bad now that you got dealt dealt with doubt dealt with and you got frustration dealt with now your senses well yeah my senses feel bad the next thing to do is cut that thing away that's right you say you know my conscience tells me brother brand I'm that well you might as well cut this thing away that thing away you ain't going to get no further than that this is the next job just get your next job done he says take off your coat and Bear right into it just keep on going one objective I'm going to win I can't lose I'm going to win we know that that we say that well the it's on the battlefield that a victory is decided Well okay but we know who wins I wish Brother Andy was here right brother Andy you've read the back of the book right we win we know how this story ends we know that in the end we're going to win so there should never be any doubt as to the outcome the way my wife Elizabeth and I were fellowshipping on this and what I thought of that that uh made some sense to me is we think about these little skirmishes and these little battles and the devil thinks oh you know look what we did we kind of got you to do this we got you do that it reminded me of the you know the last two battles of the Civil War were won by the rebels and there were battles in Texas by a bunch of guys who didn't know the war was over and they had these battles and it's like hey did you not know we already won so what you got my flag oh you got my Cannon oohoo big deal it didn't matter anymore they had already won the war it was already decided it was a defeated enemy that was just trying to have bragging rights over something the devil it don't matter no more it doesn't matter to me the war is already won so we can have this kind of attitude when it comes to conflict and confrontation and when there's a battle that's taking place there it's never in doubt I'm going to win I can't lose I'm going to win and if this is what is in the way now in front of me then this is what's going to have to fall and the story that brother bam is building off of is the story of uh cartright Peter cartright he went into town to have a Revival and there he's in there washing the windows and setting up chairs and I think the story's told that he was up on a ladder washing windows and he's washing the windows the town bully shows up and he gets down at the base of the ladder and he pulls his coat back so he can see the gun he says yeah I hear you're having a Revival and you know what brother cartright did tell you what he didn't do he didn't take the sponge and put it down and climb down off the ladder and have a conversation he just kept washing windows why he's supposed to have Revival and he had to get the place ready for it so he didn't stop he just kept washing windows yeah I hear you're going to have Revival pulls a gun back and he's like yep mhm what God called me to do he goes well you're not going to have a Revival around here oh really he knew what God called him to do he just kept working so finally the bully's like you know what if you're going to have to have if you're going to have a Revival then you have to go through me first and Peter's like oh so that's my next job it's exactly what he did he's like oh well then that's my next job and he put the sponge down the rag down whatever is he climbed down the ladder took his coat off and said I must fight if I must reain increase my courage Lord and beat the car out of the bully why the bully stood in the way of his Revival and there was a bully standing there taunting him saying he was going to keep him from his Revival Peter wasn't walking down the road and got picked on he was in the line of duty and the fight came to him why was the bully brandishing a weapon inside of that place that day because he was in the line of duty doing what God wanted him to do and the devil didn't like it so there was a brawl and there was a fight and he put it down took his cut off beat the tar out of that guy and the bully came that night and got saved brother B says this is how we ought to look at it you've got a job to do keep doing what you're supposed to do if something comes up in the way of you doing it then that's your next job cut it down get it out of the way conquer it and just keep going on why because I'm going to win I can't lose I'm going to win let me say this is a different way of viewing the greatest battle ever fought it's just not the a battle in the mind he said the greatest battle ever fought the chosen The Chosen ground is in the mind that's the Battle Ground that's the Battlefront it rages in the mind but so that we can think about this differently it's not it's not I wouldn't even say it's a battle in the mind it's a battle for the mind that's why there's a battle there did Satan just choose the mind because it was inconsequential did Satan choose the mind because he thought well this doesn't really matter and if I as long as I have the mind I can just do my tricks and play my games we know God chose the heart first and the devil chose the Mind next and the battle is in the mind but it's a battle for the mind therefore we realize the battle is not without a purpose there has to be a battle there we know that we have something to overcome and in overcoming it it's for a reason says in Genesis 22:1 17 about Abraham and his seed after him that they thy seed shall possess the gates the Gate of his enemies and it's referred to in other places as the gates of his enemies this is the promise to Abraham's seed they will possess the Gate of his enemies you are Abraham's Royal seed therefore you are under a prophecy you are under a commandment you are under an order that you are to possess the Gate of your enemies and then this is a an order that is so expansive to where God is not not God is Not merely just saying he's going to save your soul and change your body but you are going to possess your completely and you're going to bring mind body and spirit under subjection to the word of God so that there's not just one dimensional Deliverance but there's a three-dimensional Deliverance to the fullest extent of the word why because God has not only purchased your soul and will one day change your body but he's going to redeem this Spirit into Perfection this mind must be possessed if we are taught that the greatest enemy is ourselves then your Gates of seeing taste feel smell here and touch all those senses those five gates of the spirit they must be uh conquered the imagination conscience memory reason and affection they these Gates these channels must be possessed says in Genesis chter 49: 19 this is Jacob Israel's prophecy of each one of these Sons he says Gad a troop shall overcome him Gad was called a warrior tribe it says he's going to be overcome gathers a bunch of Warriors they they like to fight they're going to be overcome but notice the next part but he shall overcome at the last I love it the enemy may come and take the enemy May advance and possess certain grounds and build certain Gates and certain bullworks and do certain things but we'll overcome at last this was a prophecy that God would be Warriors and at times they would be conquered But ultimately they would be victorious they may seem to be defeated they may lose some battles but it says but he shall overcome at last whatever has been taken away will be restored and Paul borrows on the same thought in Romans 8:37 nay and all these things we are more than conquerors said of God He Shall Overcome ultimately be victorious exceed victoriously he shall overcome at last Paul says we are more than Overcomers we are more than conquerors through him that loved us in all these things what were the things he was talking about tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril sword but ultimately we gain surpassing Victory ultimately we are more than conquerors said it's a surpassing victory what how is it that we overcome what this is we're looking at this I want you to look about look at this differently than traditionally how we express the battle and the Warfare is oh I'm being attacked oh I'm really going through it no something else is happening it's not just a wasteland where skirmishes are taking place but God wants your mind was talking about the the actual mechanics of this and greatest battle ever thought he says you had to open that channel the Channel first so there has to be an opening up an allowing but this is part I want to focus on you've got to get the the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront so the battle is not you in your mind with the devil as we think about the greatest battle ever fought if we just think it's a mind battle with Satan that would be discouraging but and I want to choose my words carefully because I'm I'm certainly not suggesting that we're Spectators but in one sense there's a fight taking place because the soldiers there the Holy Spirit just admit it before you didn't have much of a fight right before he got there you just kind of gave in oh you really want me to do that okay you really want me to doubt okay I'll doubt but now you have a soldier there that's what had to happen you open up the channel you've got the soldier placed at the Battlefront that takes God's word he is the word and he stands there there's nothing going to stop it then there's nothing why is there a war because of the presence of the warrior why is there a fight because the presence of the fighter why is there a battle because of the one that leads the battle if there was not one on the battlefield it wouldn't even be called to fight it wouldn't even be fair because you're not a match at all but through Christ you're more than a match for the devil why because through him the word is our Warrior he's the soldier the soldier he's the combatant he's the one that wages War he's the one that says follow me we got thisam in the story greatest battle ever fought talks about how the Jeffersonville fire department and the Albany fire department there was a big huge Raging Fire and he said there was a captain saying shoot a little fire water there phw put a little fire water there phw and you had these little guys there kind of just telling them how to put out a fire but then the captain from Louisville showed up and and what did the captain from Louisville do he didn't tell the men fight there and fight here and put water there he grab took his ax and said come on boys follow me and he went to the fire to put the fire out he ran to it he says that's our captain if there's a fight it's not because you're over there put a little water here and a little water there trying to put our fires we spin our whole lives bubble dancing and putting out fires and now there's a battle why because Christ said follow me and now you begin to follow and obedience do what the word requires you to do things start changing things start moving God starts doing Supernatural things and all of a sudden you're in the greatest battle ever fire not because you're laying around but because you're moving forward the word is the one that wages the war the Bible says in Exodus chapter 15 verse three the Lord is a man of war this is how he's described this is part of his essential characteristics I if he saved us and then we just put on the sidelines and everything was just easy and we just begin to Bubble dance and have a picnic then Jehovah would be over there just itching for a fight oh I want to fight so bad how is he going to fight unless it's your feet unless it's your hands unless it's your mind he is a man of war he wants to go to battle he he wants to roll up his sleeves he wants to fight he says the Lord is a man of war Jehovah is a hero of the battle in battle he always overcomes God wants a fight and the only way he can fight is through you Isaiah 42:13 the Lord shall go forth as a Mighty Man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war why are these things happening we're talking about invert always invert think about this greatest battle ever fought think about what you've been going through and how bowed down you felt and how discouraged you felt and how you felt things were turning you I thought things were really good you know what they're better than you thought they were Hallelujah they're better than that you thought they were because now there's things happening that you didn't even know needed to happen next time someone says how it's going say better than I thought it was well how do you know man I'm in a fight I'm in a fight it's like the Civil War up in here you're all excited like this guy's crazy the Lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stirp jealousy like a man of war he shall cry y Roar he shall Prevail against his enemies who is it that's fighting the battle all the devil's attacking me turn it around the devil is being attacked and he's angry he's mad and he's brought you up as he did Jason this guy is turning the world upside down what are we going to do with him 1st Samuel 17:47 and all this assembly shall know that the Lord sath not with sword and Spear and other words it's not through the man for the battle is the Lord's he will give you into our hands that's exactly how David felt it's not going to be through Talent not through training but this is God's battle this is God's battle and I know I'm going to win I can't lose how do you know you see who I'm with you think you're fighting me a little Ruddy 13-year-old boy you think that you think you're fighting me you think you you said send me a man and you think what you got was a boy my Lord is a man of war and you may see me with a sling and five stones and you may stand there with a shield and a sword and a spear but I'm coming in the name of the Lord and this battle is the Lord's in other words the events of War Are Holy in God's power it's under his Direction it is the Lord's war and I'm here fighting alongside My Savior I'm right here with the chief Warrior and the chief captain and he can't lose therefore I can't lose listen if you want to set up some sort of prop bet or side war and do something off on the sidelines you're probably going to get it whipped a little bit but stay close to his side the battles the Lords in Exodus chap 14: 13- 15 here they come up against the Red Sea people all worried all nervous all fearful um if you could just think about it for a moment that and I know it may seem just to be logic but they come up against the Red Sea and it's as if collectively they're all like God isn't God is ignorant and wasted his time through all the plagues through everything he done and all the Vindication and everything he brought them through he's bringing them out by a mighty hand finally their prayers are being answered they prayed for this for decades they prayed for it for hundreds of years as a people this is something they always wanted something they always look forward to they finally have it and now all of a sudden a little bit of trouble arises it's almost like those 10 plagues that meant nothing that was so yesterday and they're all worried and fretful but had they just stood there and said all right this doesn't look good doesn't look good at all so what's going to happen here how are we going to get out of this because God's got to get us out of this because when he brought the 10 plagues upon Egypt and finally hardened the heart of pharaoh and called us to eat because we were going to be leaving and he would bring us he said he would bring us into the land I know this is not the land so we have a Red Sea in front of us we have an enemy behind us I may not be able to figure this out in my mind how it's going to happen but this is a difficult situation so I'm going to invert I know he's going to put me in the promised land so I know neither Red Sea nor Pharaoh's Army is going to keep me from it so God's got to deal with one or the other or both there was just this is just how they should have looked at it but they all fearful and there said a you bring us out here to die and he says Moses said fear not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians you whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace now I think the next verse is still very important for us because it puts us in the frame of mind that the Lord fighting for us us is indicative of advancement it's not just recovery it's restoration it's not just a hostage situation where he's trying to get us out of the clutches of the devil get us the clutches of Egypt well we're out of Egypt you know let's just let's just hang out here no he says the Lord shall fight for you in verse 15 and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the the children of Israel that they go forward what are you crying for have you not seen my mighty hand do you not know what the promise is the Lord is the one that shall fight for you the battle is the Lord's then go forward whatever's in front of you it's got to go it's got to be dealt with it can't hang on it can't be there forever it's got to go out of the way so this is what I want to take from this this says the Lord shall fight for you the battle is the Lord's he is a man of war he Goes Forth as a mighty man Jehovah as a hero in the battle the Lord he shall fight for you so speak and go forward your fighting isn't an act of Defense I I I I I'm probably going to have to just close very or I'm not going to be able to cover all the ground I wanted to cover today but we're going to advance this fighting is not an act of Defense it's an act of enforcing Redemption I it's so important that you view it correctly it is not you're fully redeemed you're fully adopted fully placed sign and here I am just kind of waiting for these other guys to catch up and you just start I'm just fending things off I'm fending things off no the armor of the believer they're dressed because they're advancing they're dressed because there's forward movement they have their feet Shaw why because there's going to be times when their feet are exposed because they're walking forward they're not just hiding behind the shield they don't just have their backs up against the wall no this is a forward moving message and so the fight is not a defensive one but it's an act of enforcing redemption's claims this is how Paul spoke to Timothy in 1 Timothy chapter 1 1 Timothy chapter 6 he's charging Timothy that by the prophecies that have been spoken over him by them he might War a good Warfare there's nothing defensive in that language to war it means to make a military expedition to lead soldiers to war to be in service to fight so when he told them to take the prophecies that have been spoken over you and War a good Warfare he didn't say hold yourself up and defend yourself against all the attacks of the enemy but he said this is going to be an advancement this is going to be offensive and as you advance there's going to be fiery darts coming your way as you move forward there's going to be battles As you move you're going to be possessing land so use the word to war to make a military Expedition and to be led into to war war a good Warfare a military Expedition or campaign speaks of military service or Warfare so he tells them in 1 Timothy 6 fight the good fight of faith and to lay hold of eternal life fight means to enter a contest to contend with adversaries to fight with difficulties and dangers so he's telling them to fight the good fight that's a battle fight a battle to a contest a fighting a striving endeavoring with great against enemies and when he says lay hold of eternal life again this is not a defensive posture but it's the act of taking possession lay hold is the o to overtake or to attain it means to seize upon with your hands so there must be a reaching forth and you don't think while you're trying to reach forth the devil's not there trying to knock your hand away keep your hands in your pocket that's when you know it's really cold right when a lawyer has his hands in his own pocket as long as you keep your hands in your pocket Devil's all right it's fine but as soon as you start reaching forth he's there to try to stop you lay a hold I notice what it says in 2 Corinthians chapter 10: three and four for though we walk in the flesh we do not war there's the same word for war to make military Expedition we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare there's the word again about a military Expedition or campaign the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds what did the siege of Petersburg teach us once the strongholds tore down you keep advancing once something's cleared out you possess it once you've had a victory you move the battle line forward in this battle we do not Skirmish on a field and then Retreat we do not have a battle here over doubt and then we vacate the battlefield of doubt we plant the flag of faith and we say this ground is possessed and now that I have this ground what's next frustration all right let's plant the flag of faith on frustration next and you keep advancing and you keep advancing why because the weapons of our Warfare are meant to the pulling down of strongholds that's a fortress that's an entrenchment that's a place where your enemy has been fortifying his position against you and one CE you've shined the light on him and exposed him he puts up a fight but once you tear it down you've got him on the run and now you bring the fight to the enemy there's a difference of you fighting Philistines and you kicking Philistines out of where they want us they've been living and the battle some of you are facing is not a matter of you having not possessed enough or Disobedience or backsliding but it's a matter of your maturing you're finally a great grown up enough to fight this I'm not saying that condescendingly you've Advanced to push that out you were too small at one time to push it out just as he said by little and little I'll drive the enemy out from before you till you be increased and can possess the land I'm not going to do it all at one time but as you increase as you put footsteps to the promises as you come to their door then I'll drive them out I'm not just going to go ahead and drive them all out you've got to come to their doorstep and then I can f for you you've tored down some strongholds now the devil's been exposed now there's more fighting the greatest battle ever fought is a mind battle because God's taking back your mind recesses in your thoughts that were buried things that you had no idea formed the basis for certain attitudes and actions and all of a sudden like why am I going through this now this is Victory why is this happening this is maturity this is advancement these are things that have held you back but now this is going to be dealt with this is going to be torn down God wants it all every part there's there's no junk jawer in your mind right some of us have junk drawers some of us have junk closets some of us have junk garages right we all have some space we just kind of let it go now don't look in there that's just where all our garbage goes that's where hm I want to save this from kindergarten you just never know when you're going to need it one day when my kids are in kindergarten oh they're all teenagers now well my grandkids but there's no there's no junk jawer in your mind for God there's no garage there's no under the bed there's no part there's no part in your mind that God says you know what it's okay you can keep that God says I want it all every thought every crevice every nook every cranny every drawer every closet every room every gar he wants everything his and so as the word starts searching through your mind he's taking possession of your soul now that he has your soul he's like now it's time to do battle not just in the mind but for the mind now you've got the warrior and what is he itching for a fight and that place you just never wanted to go there oh no I'll do anything but I don't want to have to clean the garage he's like no we've got this come on we've got this it's time and now he's wanting to give you enough courage to roll up your sleeves and say today is garage day today is the day that I get this cleaned up today is the day that this is finally set in order and we just need to put our shoulders back like a Peter cartright and say God this must be what's next you know why you're going through it because God wants you to be free from it brother BR says restore means to return to the former own owner or to bring back to the former of state of condition this is what he says restoration is if we are in a restoration season if this word is restorative if our faith is being restored it means to return to the former owner to bring back to a former estate or condition and he says and we can enforce a claim to be restored you're you're not defending a claim you're taking back a claim you're not building up entrenchments and a moat and and trying to do this and trying to do that trying to figure out a way to defend yourself no you are enforcing a claim upon what basis the basis of restored faith I have a right to have this we're saying we're inverting the battle now any raging battle is the evidence of the work of restoration every battle is the evidence of a work of restoration in other words you're taking back what was lost you know I surrendered that part of my mind my emotions I Surrender that part I I I just let the devil have it I just let it go no at some point God's going to circle you back and say now you're strong enough take it you're taking back what was lost this was so impressed upon me that I know this is this is God speaking you have not lost your mind you are not losing your mind you're winning it back I didn't get that from Joel Stein or Joyce Myers you're not losing your mind you're winning it back and the devil wants us to think I'm losing my mind am I'm losing my mind I think I've lost it I'm losing control I'm losing control of my emotions no no the battle may seem hot and heavy things may seem to be chaotic things may seem to be going sideways this may not be what you expected and you think you're losing your mind but in reality you're actually winning it back because now something's been stirred up and now the lewd fellows of a baser sort are all anxious and upset why because you've turned somebody's world upside down and God is getting things right and that's why you're fighting you're not losing your mind you're winning your mind you're finding your right mind as thought by thought inch by inch I because Satan's being exposed okay I'm GNA skip a whole bunch brother John's the only one that knows just how much I'm skipping i w to go to I don't know what slide it is but it's just after the breach I think the first statement from the breach greatest battle ever fought we got a festar general and then I'm going to skip um to the last quote if I could say this brother bam talks about in greatest battle ever fought he says the brains of the army lays in its captains the intelligence what's taking place today is not it's a Warfare related to the time you're living in it's because of the things that are happening in the super Supernatural Realm again if we're looking at a problem we work our way backwards and you say I have to defeat death right you do I won't say me you do right you have to defeat death you have to bind the greatest so you're going to go in a Rapture right whoever believes it can amen it then let's work our way backwards if I'm going to go in a Rapture then what would be something that would keep me from getting there now think about what you're going through now can you recognize that the reason why you're fighting what you're fighting now is not because you've wandered off somewhere not because you're weak and because you're wrong but it's because of where you're going you're fighting this because of where you're going you're fighting because where the promise l if they had gone the other way there would have been no Red Sea and the devil would have said well go ahead run right head long into the desert but because they were going in the right direction there was a Red Sea in their way and an army behind them but there was a promise that said they would get there so they just had to work backwards I'm fighting today because of the promise that God gave me and he made the promise that this is his fight brother Bram says this and greatest battle ever fought we got a five-star general spelled Jesus s this is the one we have fighting the battle this is the intelligence think now I wanted to use some other statements in a little bit different context about the time that we're living in now this is who is in the battle on the Battleground the battle in your mind is not a is not oneon-one you and the devil Christ the reason why you're fighting is because Jesus Christ and you've got a five star five star general Jesus and I love this placing five stars on us we've been made a five-star general right along with him and what did he give us F AI t h Faith he's never lost a battle and he starts saying hallelujah a lot in here hallelujah he conquered death hell in the grave get the Devils out of the way out of the way why out of the way I'm going somewhere Satan get out of my way if you're just laying around you say just leave me alone just leave me little I'm trying to take a nap but you're going somewhere and you've ruffled his feathers and ye he's in your way and you're enforc it what are you doing you are evicting him he's not disturbing your peace you're taking it back you're not losing your mind you're winning it back you've Advanced to his doorstep and you're saying I've got eviction papers I've got a title deed I've got every right to this I'm enforcing Redemption claims what gives you the right to do that the mighty Angel the man of war has told me to take this claim and to enforce this claim and that's exactly what I'm doing says get the Devils out of the way he's the great chief captain and this is just what's so beautiful in some ways maybe it contradicts everything I've been trying to say so the devil isn't even in the picture it's not about the devil let's not make him the subject the devil is attacking me okay why because he's under attack says to where the devil isn't even in the picture anymore why because it's about Christ it's about advancement of the word it's about the promise of the hour and anything that stands in the ways has got to get dealt with and Lord deal with my adversaries Lord deal with my weaknesses deal with my doubts deal with my frustrations deal with my word deal with them Lord I don't want to suppress them I don't want to ignore them I don't want to shove them off into a corner if there's some recess if there's some dark place if there's something in me come on Lord you're itching to fight Lord come fight my battle Lord get in here and help me I want to overcome this once and forever I want to be God I want to be behind me why I'm going forward so the devil isn't even in the picture anymore the greatest battle was ever raged is setting right ready now in the language that he's using he says the great hour of charge is at hand not the great hour here's coming another one we kind of use this the idea brother saying Satan's got one punch so it's almost as if we're just kind of hanging out at the party just waiting to get sucker punched oh thought you were the devil right like what's what's my punch right so I back up I'm G to hide go wor no throw the Long Island ice tea away you're out of that it's over behind you you're on the battlefield for the Lord now and he's got one punch coming but he's going to throw it when you show up at his doorstep say time to leave buddy enough's enough I'm getting out of here and you're in my way and you didn't pick a fight with the devil this isn't bradia this isn't you making some wild claims the Lord brought you to this fight the battle's the Lords David didn't go picking on the armies of the Philistines and they said well you want to mess with us you're going to mess with Goliath David showed up one day just doing his business doing what he was supposed to do doing what a 12-year-old boy would do bringing cheese and bringing some corn and bringing things to his brothers and the captains and he shows up and someone has showed up and making a bold claim send me a man send me a man and they was like you guys are just going to let him talk to you like that well this isn't right think about all the things God had done for us the things that Jesse had said and taught him instilled with him a faith to believe God said that every single one of our enemies would be defeated this is the battle this is our enemy what are we worried about take the battle to him that's how he said the battle is the Lord's the great hour of charge is at hand David didn't wait for Goliath to regroup he ran after after him and he ran and said today I'm you're going to be delivered in my hands and he charged to the Giant and he slew the Giant in his advancement caused all Israel to rally and put the Philistines to flight the great hour of charge is at hand he says he don't have Retreat so he's teaching Us in these statements shine your armor polish your armor up you got to get ready because it's time to fight musicians if you could come if you could just take some time go listen to the breach and and all the things brother talking about Redemptive claims Redemptive claims and how that we must we can only properly view the Battle we're going through through God's promise of the hour that somehow when I'm going through right now is related to where I'm going somehow if it's if you've been disobedient you've been doing things wrong and you're in a battle and things are falling apart and things aren't working out the way you want them to that's God's grace forming forming some resistance and you're getting this resist you're not going to drop any further than this and it's his way of saying Turn Around you're going the wrong way why is that there because of where you're going if you weren't going up yonder if you weren't leaving in a Rapture that wouldn't be there you just go as far as far as one could go but at some point God says stop you're going the wrong direction it's says turn around and then whatever you meet on your way back you're meeting it because you're on your way back whatever you're going through whatever you're fighting with whatever's happening it's standing in the way of you in pure [Music] joy brother B makes a statement the greatest battle ever fought he says oh Lord come down oh I love it get that five-star general let him come let him come who will Rouse him up let him come you made me a free moral agent you are my son all right I open up my heart and my mind come in Lord Jesus and grab the faith that sword of the spirit thus sayith the Lord scream hallelujah amen then cut down every enemy in front of you there it is cut every enemy if it's an old spooky Spirit making you feel all you get to fill in the blank cut that thing away with the word of the Lord but our strength is the joy of the Lord is my strength that's my that's my strength some spooky Spirit Some Cloud something coming against me I'm going to take the word of the Lord the joy of the Lord is my strength get away from me whack you cut them with the word whether it be a demon whether it be an enemy whether it be a sickness whether it be a disease whatever it is take that word pull it with the sword and if you whack it the first time and it don't seem to move whack it again and whack it again and whack it again don't stop brother what should I do whack it yeah let it have let him have it about the arrow of God's Deliverance the prophet said take this take the arrow and smite the ground King took the arrow was like the prophet was Roth he said that's it he's going to kind of pound it five times he said because you only did it you you you'll have five victories but you won't completely defeat the enemy you ought to have taken this opportunity to strike and to strike and to strike and to strike and to strike did he recognize the value of the opportunity with the prophet that was standing before him did he recognize the chance that he had to take the AR of God's deliverance and completely drive out the enemy from before him that Prophet made his mistake but or that King made his mistake let us not make the same mistake take the eror of God's deliverance and say Lord I must strike and strike and strike and strike and strike how many times are you going to strike I'm going to strike until it's gone I'm going to keep fighting if I can't do anything else but wiggle my toe I'm going to wiggle my toe I'm going to fight I'm going to fight till my arms fall off and then I'm going to bite the devil till my teeth fall out and then I'm going to gum him to death why he's going to die I can't lose Whack It Again Whack It Again whack it again and whack it until you chip the hole through like a little chicken pipping itself out or an eagle what are you pip yourself right on through that old Shell of sickness you're an eagle you want to let a shell stand in your way cut your way out and say hallelujah where's the next one maybe you've had your fall of Petersburg this great long siege that you've been battling for so long now you've come to Richmond take it just take it where's the next one that's the battle that's a soldier that's a soldier of the Cross yes sir not knock every enemy out brother Bram Said Knock You Out that's what I've been told word Said Knock You Out so I'm going to do it I'm going to knock you out it's what I've been called to do Whack It Again Whack It Again whack it again until you've chipped through so what in the world does this have to do with pure joy well it's whatever stands in the way of it and there's a lot standing in the way and so what I wanted to do is just turn your battle upside down you thought you were being attacked no you're attacking the devil so stand Victorious today stand with me as Victorious Army blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] let's pray a prayer of encouragement if you can say I'm going to win I can't lose I'm going to win lift your hands let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father am I a soldier of the Cross yes I am I your son you made me a free moral agent so today Lord by lifting up of a hand I'm opening up that Chanel CH and I'm letting the word come to the front of the battle and I realize now Lord that I've only gone through what I've gone through because of where I'm going whether it be a buffer that stopped me in the fall or a roadblock that stands in my way now as I'm rising Lord I'm accepting that I'm going to win I can't lose I'm accepting that you know the way we don't I'm looking to you the festar G General that's placed a five star of faith upon me the battle is yours that's why I'm willing to fight is because you're fighting with [Music] me I'm willing to fight because I know the thoughts that you have towards me I'm fighting Lord because of the promise that you made Lord as I've encouraged the people to invert the battle what it's what has been so heavy upon my heart is how that you have attacked that how that people have felt [Music] attacked and how the devil tries to work in that realm to discourage like oh it seems so much harder now and I didn't know it'd be like this and man it was a lot easier when we were just kind of bubble dancing and oh man I I don't know are we doing something [Music] wrong and I felt impressed [Music] to take the word of God and open up our understanding to see that we as Believers are fighting this fight because we're going forward not going back if he would have just stayed where we were there would have been no fight we have just kept the status quo there' have been no fight if we hadn't made a stand for the word there' have been no fight but Lord we're fighting today because we drew our swords and we made a stand for truth we said Lord we're going forward and father if this be true then Lord I put my shoulders back and if I I must fight if my I must rain increase my courage Lord and then I want to take the fight to the bully who's trying to steal my joy today rob me of my peace take my family tear down the things that you're [Music] doing devil you are exposed re reason why you're scurrying the reason why you're fighting is because light has advanced to your hideout and the fall of Petersburg has come and now the armies of God have advanced to Richmond and now the believer takes their sword it says today I take the capital today I possess it and Lord may we do so Lord we do not do so presumptuously to venture without Authority thinking that somehow after this afternoon there will be no fight no Lord we're going forward we expect a fight but the battle is yours we're going forward that's why you gave us a sword and no armor for our backs we're going forward therefore we know there's more fights there's more victories and Lord let us win victories save Souls hurting Hearts sick bodies may we advance Lord in the promises of God and see every enemy defeated that's our prayer may the believer take the sword today say my strength is the joy of the [Music] Lord fight every demon out of hell we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
