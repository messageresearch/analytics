[0:00] Joshua 7 verse
[0:03] 1-6. But the children of Israel
[0:06] committed a trespass in the oursed
[0:08] thing. For Achen, the sons of Ki, the
[0:11] sons of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the
[0:13] tribe of Judah, took of the oursed
[0:15] thing. And the anger of the Lord was
[0:17] kindled against the children of Israel.
[0:19] And Joshua sent men from Jericho to I,
[0:22] which is beside Bethan, and east of
[0:25] Bethl, and spake unto them, saying, Go
[0:27] up and view the country. And the men
[0:30] went up and viewed I. And they returned
[0:32] to Joshua and said unto him, "Let not
[0:34] all the people go up, but let about two
[0:36] or three thousand men go up, and smite I
[0:39] that not all the people to labor, and
[0:42] make not all the people to labor
[0:44] thither, for they are not but few." So
[0:46] you could tell they just didn't think
[0:47] much of this city that was in the way.
[0:49] So there went up thither of the people
[0:51] about 3,000 men, and they fled before
[0:53] the men of I. And the men of ice smoke
[0:56] of them about 30 and six men, and they
[0:59] chased them from before the gate, even
[1:00] unto Shabarim, and the smokeote them in
[1:03] the going down. Wherefore the hearts of
[1:05] the people melted, became as water. And
[1:08] Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the
[1:10] earth upon his face before the ark of
[1:12] the Lord until the evening tide. He and
[1:14] the elders of Israel and put dust upon
[1:17] their heads. If we could just pray
[1:20] again, just a a short prayer. Heavenly
[1:22] Father, Lord, as we read of these
[1:24] things, we know that there's a great
[1:25] principle that we can gather from it.
[1:28] And Lord, in the burden that I have
[1:29] tonight to express in a particular way,
[1:32] may your emphasis and your thought not
[1:35] be lost in my own. And may you deal with
[1:38] hearts appropriately. We ask this in the
[1:40] name of Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:42] Amen. You can be
[1:46] seated. Tonight, my title is faith or
[1:49] cake. And so now we've we've arrived at
[1:52] this climactic sermon. And that's my
[1:56] title. There's a lot that's meant in
[1:57] this. There's a lot of different
[1:58] directions we can go through this. Uh
[2:01] consider it for just a little bit. We'll
[2:03] just give a little bit of background on
[2:05] why I use this particular title. But
[2:07] Sunday, we're ministered on the final
[2:09] front line. It's that climax of the
[2:12] greatest battle ever fought. That's kind
[2:14] of the line that we're using that in is
[2:16] that in the greatest battle ever fought
[2:18] which is in the mind we're now with
[2:21] Christ the intelligence comes on the
[2:23] battlefield and now we're defeating
[2:25] intellectual faith and emotional faith
[2:27] so that Christ can have preeminence. We
[2:30] were using 1 Corinthians chapter 2 in
[2:32] particular verse 16 it says for who hath
[2:35] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[2:37] instruct him but we have the mind of
[2:41] Christ as we believe that the
[2:43] intelligence has come to us at this end
[2:45] time that it's here to have preeminence
[2:47] in his bride and that we are to allow
[2:49] the the the mind of Christ to grow and
[2:52] to come into preeminence 1 Corinthians
[2:55] chapter 2:es 9 to10 it says but as it is
[2:58] written I ath not seen nor ear heard,
[3:01] neither hath entered into the heart of
[3:02] man the things which God hath prepared
[3:05] for them that love him. But God hath
[3:07] revealed them unto us by his spirit. For
[3:10] the spirit searchth all things, yay, the
[3:13] deep things of God. I want you to think
[3:15] of it this way. We do not need to
[3:16] imagine or conjure up or by any means
[3:20] uh in our flesh try to apprehend the
[3:24] things that God has prepared for them
[3:26] that love him. So we know that we love
[3:28] him. We know that his uh spirit is
[3:30] within us that there's things that God
[3:31] has for us. So we do not need human
[3:34] capacity uh to see the things of God. We
[3:37] don't do it through human conception or
[3:39] through human senses but God will reveal
[3:41] them to us. So we look to revelation. We
[3:44] call upon God for revelation more than
[3:46] anything. And so God want wants us to
[3:48] know him by revelation. And then also he
[3:51] wants us to express him in reality. So
[3:54] it's not just a figment of our
[3:55] imaginations. It's not just a fleeting
[3:57] thought. God does not, we do not need to
[4:00] know God through human activity or human
[4:02] senses. Nor does God merely want him to
[4:05] be a thought in our minds. But he wants
[4:07] to be a reality to us by revelation so
[4:09] that he can be a reality lived through
[4:11] our lives. And I would say that Satan
[4:14] works hard to prevent this. If he could
[4:16] keep you in verse 9, then um I what your
[4:19] eye sees, what your ear hears, and what
[4:21] comes into your heart or your
[4:22] imagination, then he wins because he
[4:24] wants to prevent or distort or fabricate
[4:28] that reality of God. And that's what
[4:30] brings me to that title. Uh maybe it's
[4:33] it might be considered clickbait, but
[4:34] faith or cake. It's that conclusion of
[4:37] sermons that begin with the art of
[4:39] seduction. Uh so it's been several
[4:41] services. And when we use this phrase uh
[4:43] faith or cake, we're drawing from what
[4:45] many of you might be familiar with, the
[4:47] viral phenomena called real or cake. And
[4:50] brother John, if you just want to cycle
[4:51] through these as I go through this, but
[4:54] uh these hyperrealistic cakes appear as
[4:57] an actual object here. This looks like a
[4:59] pickle, but in fact, it's cake. And
[5:01] could you imagine uh playing this this
[5:03] game where he had to uh decide whether
[5:05] or not this pickle was cake? I guess
[5:08] Preston would feel like either way he
[5:09] wins. He loves pickles. cake, that's
[5:11] just fine, too. But what's happening is
[5:13] when we see this, it tricks our senses.
[5:15] We look and you say, "Well, that looks
[5:17] like an onion." Uh, and really it would
[5:19] do better if I had provided a gift for
[5:21] some as who are minded to say, Jeff, I
[5:23] could have appi uh showed it in ways
[5:24] that you look at say, "Oh, that's an
[5:26] onion." But then the knife cuts through
[5:27] it and reveals that it's a cake. But
[5:29] when you look at it, what you see is one
[5:31] thing, but then it creates this conflict
[5:33] where what between what we know and what
[5:35] we see. And because the mind uses
[5:37] schemes or these schema and then the
[5:39] mind begins to respond to it and
[5:41] responding to this new reality, uh it
[5:43] kind of sets up this sensation. And they
[5:45] say that the reason why we're so drawn
[5:48] to these types of videos where something
[5:50] looks like a croc but in fact it's a
[5:52] cake or something looks like toilet
[5:54] paper but in fact it's cake or someone's
[5:56] head. Uh it turns out to be cake. The
[5:58] reason why we enjoy this is our brains
[6:00] enjoy art or some creation that sets up
[6:04] a particular expectation and then
[6:06] violates that
[6:07] expectation. So when we are when I say
[6:10] faith or cake, you're all thinking of
[6:12] the viral sensation realer cake. I think
[6:15] it became real popular in 2020s when
[6:16] nobody had anything better to do than
[6:18] sit indoors wearing a mask and making
[6:20] hyperrealistic cakes. But I want to draw
[6:24] from the phrase real or cake to use
[6:26] faith or cake and not so much uh the
[6:29] principle of our brains being tricked
[6:32] and asking this question is our faith
[6:35] real or is it genuine? And through many
[6:38] of these sermons that we've ministered
[6:40] to this point on the I thought this is
[6:41] one of the best ones. What a burger
[6:43] chicken and biscuit. And I think I'd be
[6:45] vastly disappointed if it turned out to
[6:47] be red velvet cake underneath uh because
[6:49] that chicken and biscuit looks pretty
[6:50] good. But in asking is your faith
[6:54] real or is it fake in this age of
[6:58] artificial influ artificial
[7:00] intelligence? And I was going to spend
[7:02] maybe more time looking into those
[7:03] things and some of those parallels, but
[7:05] I feel that maybe just save it for
[7:07] another time. I don't know that it's
[7:08] really I think we all get kind of where
[7:10] things have gone with respect to
[7:11] artificial intelligence and just how
[7:14] much more shallow we begin to live uh
[7:16] through those processes. But I'm not I
[7:19] haven't been approaching this subject
[7:20] from uh that those sermons on uh the art
[7:23] of seduction and anti-faith and pseudo
[7:26] Christrist and cosmetic Christians and
[7:28] copyr all those things have not been
[7:30] looking at trying to tear down and
[7:32] expose something outside of us in
[7:35] certainly not wanting to destroy your
[7:37] faith but challenge us to identify
[7:39] anything that is lacking in our faith
[7:42] and recognize I'm not my faith isn't
[7:44] resting on the word of God here. I need
[7:47] to reorient my faith to the things that
[7:49] count and the things that matter. As it
[7:51] says in 1 Thessalonians chapter 3:10,
[7:54] Paul is praying and night and day
[7:56] praying exceedingly that we might see
[7:57] your face and might perfect that which
[8:00] is lacking in your faith. As we are to
[8:03] grow into the mind of Christ and grow in
[8:05] God's intelligence, it takes a
[8:07] perfecting of what is lacking in our
[8:10] faith. Something that is deficient,
[8:12] something that is not there. So if we
[8:14] grow, if we're going to perfect that
[8:15] which is lacking, if there's some
[8:17] deficiency, if something is sick, if
[8:19] something's missing or something is
[8:21] mixed in, then the perfecting is the
[8:23] removal of those things that make it
[8:25] mixed. As we want to mix nothing with
[8:28] the word of God, but faith, there's this
[8:30] process of perfecting our faith. So I'm
[8:33] not I'm not trying to expose any one of
[8:35] us as not having the goods or expose any
[8:37] one of us as a fraud, but that we might
[8:39] recognize that place in which our souls
[8:42] which are definitely resting on the word
[8:45] of God where our minds are wondering in
[8:47] resting on things external to the word
[8:49] of God. That's where that greatest
[8:50] battle ever fought lies. Now, as we've
[8:54] been using uh different phrases as it
[8:56] relates to artificial resurrections,
[8:58] artificial conception and and these
[9:00] different things that we've been using
[9:02] lately and pseudo faith, uh we've been
[9:04] looking at how that unbelief can pretend
[9:07] to be belief and in doing so, it is
[9:10] makebelief. And so, another phrase we
[9:13] could be using through this is hybrid
[9:14] religion or hybrid Christianity where
[9:17] there's unbelief masquerading as faith.
[9:20] In the sermon calling Jesus on the
[9:22] scene, Brother Brand, listen to this as
[9:24] he teaches this. And hybriding has
[9:26] gotten into the church, instead of
[9:29] having a real rugged bunch of Bible
[9:31] believers, they have hybrid it by a
[9:34] denomination. Now, brother Brandham uses
[9:37] hybrid as a verb. I don't know if we
[9:39] have that verb in our English language,
[9:41] but this hybriding and in they have
[9:43] hybrid it as to by denomination. And
[9:47] they have to I got this, I got that, I
[9:50] belong to this, and I belong to that.
[9:53] Sounds like a denominational freestyle.
[9:55] They're claiming to have something,
[9:57] claiming to be something. He says it's
[9:59] hybrid. And the one and the thing cannot
[10:01] produce itself again. And he says, "We
[10:04] need a book of Acts." Remember Sunday
[10:06] how we identified a book of Acts will
[10:08] have certain characteristics. Number
[10:09] one, it'll have the word expressing
[10:11] itself. And number two, it'll have the
[10:12] impersonations right next to it. So, but
[10:15] the only way you'll do it is get back to
[10:17] the Bible away from some of this hybrid
[10:20] religion. Hybriding have to be babyed.
[10:23] This is the part to me that really
[10:25] stands out. That says power puffs. Can
[10:28] you change that to say powder puffs or
[10:29] is it too late? That's a typo on my
[10:32] part. You'll hear it in a second. He
[10:34] says, uh, get back to the Bible. Away
[10:36] from some of this hybrid religion,
[10:38] hybriding, have to be babyed. No faith.
[10:42] Just a bunch of powder puffs. Just
[10:45] sisified baby into it. And we're not
[10:48] able to change it. Well, woe is
[10:51] me. Powderpuffs. Sisified baby into it.
[10:54] I say, "Are you a Christian?" I'm
[10:55] Methodist. Are you a Christian? I'm
[10:57] Presbyterian. I'm Pentecostal. That
[10:59] don't mean that to God. You are a
[11:01] Christian because you're born in the
[11:03] spirit and the word of God lives in you.
[11:06] Amen. Now, on the subject of hybriding
[11:08] or something being a hybrid, and that is
[11:10] even taking something that's real or
[11:12] genuine or a seed and mixing it with
[11:14] another seed that produces something
[11:16] that is a mixture of both that cannot
[11:18] reproduce itself. And we know that uh
[11:21] hybriding is the sin of the original
[11:23] sin. And that's where Satan works is in
[11:26] perverting. He cannot bring forth the
[11:27] genuine. And he refers to it here as
[11:30] powder puffs, which is some soft
[11:33] material that's used to put on facial
[11:36] powder.
[11:37] It is a an instrument to apply makeup
[11:42] and then it's used since it would be
[11:44] identified with women who are powdering
[11:45] their face or powdering uh uh uh their
[11:48] cheeks with something that is soft or
[11:50] weak. In my day, I doubt it exists in
[11:53] today's society where we are all
[11:55] politically correct, but we had our
[11:57] football teams and then there was always
[11:58] a powderpuff game where the girls got to
[12:01] play football. And so powderpuff is
[12:03] something refers to something soft or
[12:05] weak or when someone plays something in
[12:07] a feminine way or does something in a
[12:09] feminine way. Brother Ram's identifying
[12:12] hybrid religion as being weak, being
[12:16] babyed. In Acts chapter 19, he says that
[12:19] we've got to get back to the Bible to
[12:20] have a book of Acts again. I want you to
[12:23] see how this spirit continues to work
[12:25] and how that we are looking at whether
[12:27] or not we have faith or cake when you
[12:30] get to the center of our faith, whether
[12:31] or not it's revealed to be the real
[12:33] thing. And it says, "And God wrought
[12:35] special miracles by the hands of Paul,
[12:38] so that from his body were brought unto
[12:40] the sick handkerchiefs of or aprons, and
[12:42] diseases parted from them, and the evil
[12:45] spirit, evil spirits went out of them."
[12:48] What great testimonies by even the
[12:50] garments of the prophet. We believe that
[12:52] in the supernatural, it's able to do
[12:54] this. Now, notice the carnal response to
[12:57] the supernatural. Then certain of the
[12:58] Vegabon Jews, exorcist, took upon them
[13:02] to call over them which had evil spirits
[13:04] the name of the Lord Jesus. Now if we
[13:07] pause for a moment, we already saw in
[13:09] two instances Sunday at least in one in
[13:13] particular where Jews kind of have this
[13:17] uh spiritual side of being exorcist or
[13:19] sorcerers and they're Jews. So, they're
[13:22] not doing it in the name of of some
[13:24] other false god, but they're using what
[13:26] would be their scriptural, their law,
[13:29] their conviction, their tradition, their
[13:31] history. Uh, and they're even calling on
[13:33] the one true God. They're using it in
[13:35] this superstitious way. But these
[13:37] Vegabon Jews, exorcists, took upon them
[13:40] to call over them evil spirits, which
[13:42] had which those which had evil spirits
[13:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus, saying,
[13:46] "We adjure thee you by Jesus whom Paul
[13:51] preachth." Oh, this is kind of an
[13:53] interesting phrasing. And there were
[13:55] seven sons of
[13:57] onekeva. Reader, a Jew, and chief of the
[14:01] priest. This isn't a witch or something.
[14:04] And uh uh but this is a Jew, a chief of
[14:07] priest, his namekea. He's a mind
[14:09] readader which did so. So so these seven
[14:11] sons of this Jew who is a mind reader,
[14:13] an exorcist, someone working in the
[14:15] spiritual realm, someone I would say
[14:18] pretending. And the evil spirit answered
[14:20] and said, "Jesus I know and Paul I know,
[14:23] but who are
[14:24] ye?" They said, "In the name of Jesus
[14:27] whom Paul preaches, come out of the
[14:29] person." And the demon says, "I know
[14:31] Jesus and I know Paul, but I have no
[14:34] idea who you are." So no matter how much
[14:36] they use that incantation or that,
[14:38] "Well, Jesus or Paul or in the name of
[14:40] the message or whatever they tried to
[14:42] use, the evil spirit did not recognize
[14:45] the authority of these seven sons
[14:47] ofKeva." And if it wasn't bad enough
[14:49] that this they were called out by the
[14:51] evil spirit, it says in verse 16, "And
[14:53] the man in whom the evil spirit was
[14:55] leaped on them and overcame them and
[14:58] prevailed against them." So that they
[15:00] ran out of the house naked and
[15:03] wounded. That's an
[15:05] L, right? They took a big L that day,
[15:08] saying, "In the name of Jesus, whom Paul
[15:10] preaches, come out of him." And not only
[15:12] does the demon say, "I have no idea who
[15:13] you are. I can't I don't have to listen
[15:15] to you." It then proceeds to influence
[15:17] the man to beat him up, strip them
[15:18] naked, and they ran out of the house
[15:20] wounded. And this was known to all the
[15:23] Jews and the Greeks also dwelling at
[15:24] Ephesus. So this is at Ephesus. and fear
[15:27] fell on them all and the name of the
[15:29] Lord was magnified. And what I want you
[15:31] to catch is that the false use of the
[15:33] name. The impersonation was exposed and
[15:38] exposing that this isn't child's play.
[15:40] Exposing that there was something very
[15:42] real about this name, it brought this
[15:44] reverence. So the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:46] was magnified. And many that believed
[15:48] came and confessed and showed their
[15:50] deeds. Many of them also which used
[15:52] curious arts, brought their books
[15:54] together, and burned them before all
[15:56] men. And they counted the price of them,
[15:58] and found it 50,000 pieces of silver. So
[16:02] mightily grew the word of God, and
[16:05] prevailed. The imitation was exposed.
[16:08] With the imitation out of the way, the
[16:10] word could grow. Had this uh imitation,
[16:13] and you may say, "Well, brother, there's
[16:15] just a little bit of conjecture there."
[16:16] But in reading this, the story is told
[16:18] that someone heard the word that was
[16:20] preached or the effectiveness of the
[16:22] name of Jesus, then tried to use it in a
[16:24] very superficial way and God did not
[16:27] allow it to happen in the name of Jesus
[16:29] whom Paul preach has come out of the
[16:31] person and there's an exposure of this
[16:33] pretending. And once that pretense was
[16:36] exposed, once that imitation was
[16:39] exposed, the word could come to
[16:40] preeminence. Not everybody was saying,
[16:42] "Oh, well, all I have to do is just
[16:44] intellectually intellectually say this.
[16:46] All I have to do is do this." There was
[16:48] an calling out of that shallowess in
[16:51] order for the word of God to grow and
[16:54] prevail.
[16:56] I hope you're thinking about this in a
[16:58] very serious uh way that sometimes the
[17:02] the fake and that which isn't real has
[17:04] to be exposed for the real to grow.
[17:06] Amen. In the sermon, the choosing of a
[17:09] bride, brother Bam's telling the story
[17:10] about uh those couples who won, they had
[17:12] real genuine love for each other and
[17:14] they lived in a box car and then the
[17:15] other ones lived in the big beautiful
[17:16] house and as soon as they realized it
[17:18] was Brother Brandham at the door, they
[17:19] just pretended to be in love. He says,
[17:21] "You're putting on something that isn't
[17:23] real." Think of this for ourselves. Now,
[17:26] you can't get warm by a painted fire.
[17:30] like some of these churches trying to
[17:31] paint Pentecost as something that
[17:34] happened a thousand years ago or 2,000
[17:36] years ago. You cannot get warm by a
[17:38] painted fire. Now, to those who would
[17:41] say Pentecost was only 2,000 years ago,
[17:46] they're not even painting a fire.
[17:48] They're just saying there was a fire and
[17:50] it no longer exists today. But with the
[17:53] wrong concept of Pentecost, you can
[17:55] begin to paint fire and it's just a
[17:58] painted fire. Trying to reimagine or
[18:01] reinvent or redo the book of Acts in a
[18:04] carnal way, trying to repeat Pentecost,
[18:06] which what we have received today is not
[18:08] a repeat of Pentecost. And so there's
[18:11] those that try to reimagine it and
[18:12] rework it and get it worked back up. And
[18:14] it's just a painted fire. Brother Vanam
[18:17] says Pentecost is just as real today as
[18:19] it was then. The fire is still falling.
[18:22] It ain't a painted fire. It's a real
[18:24] fire. So just there they was. He said,
[18:27] "I wouldn't want to live like that."
[18:30] Wouldn't want to live in a marriage that
[18:31] had a false love or put on pretense and
[18:34] put on heirs. I would not want to have a
[18:36] religion that was just painted fire that
[18:38] was all pretense. And brother Bam said,
[18:40] "It's painted fire as long as you
[18:42] haven't received that fire. No matter
[18:45] what it might look like on the outside,
[18:47] you cannot get warm by a painted fire.
[18:50] cannot get warm by an intellectual faith
[18:53] cannot be energized even by an emotional
[18:55] faith because that only goes skin deep.
[18:58] So this false
[19:00] imitation here in Acts chapter 19 this
[19:03] impersonation this mimic by using uh
[19:06] gathering information and data watching
[19:08] how something would work was exposed and
[19:10] once it was exposed the word of God grew
[19:13] and then the word of God could prevail.
[19:15] Could you imagine if God just let it
[19:17] slide, continually let something slide
[19:19] and people begin to think, "Oh, all I
[19:21] got to do is this." And then the word of
[19:23] God never has preeminence.
[19:26] So the word grew and prevailed as
[19:28] believers. And if you find how brother
[19:30] Brandham addressed the Ephesian church
[19:31] in the church age book, you find that
[19:33] the believers at Ephesus as they
[19:35] departed from unbelief, the word of God
[19:37] grew.
[19:39] He writes this, "All they did, they did
[19:42] in the name. In that name they acted.
[19:45] But if they could not act in that name,
[19:48] then they refrained from
[19:51] acting. I was really hoping for a little
[19:53] bit louder amen on that.
[19:57] Oh, if they didn't have the
[20:00] character, they had thus sayaith the
[20:02] Lord or kept still.
[20:04] They didn't want to just know what he
[20:06] wanted done. They wanted to know how to
[20:08] do it. They wanted to know the season,
[20:09] the place, and the time for it. If they
[20:11] could not act in character, if they
[20:13] could not act in the name. If it could
[20:15] not be a demonstration and it would only
[20:17] be an impersonation or presumption, they
[20:20] refrained from acting. These were
[20:22] heavenly placed Christians whose
[20:24] behavior was in the Lord. And catch
[20:27] this. But the false vine group that
[20:29] wanted to defile that name hung like
[20:32] skullking wolves in the dark. You ever
[20:35] remember reading that phrase? skullking
[20:38] wolves in the dark waiting to get in in
[20:40] and tear it down. So this is what Satan
[20:43] does. He wants to defile the name. They
[20:45] kind of lurked in the background in the
[20:47] dark waiting as wolves to devour
[20:48] something waiting to get in there and
[20:49] tear it down. But the saint stood the
[20:51] test and kept the word and the name.
[20:55] It's the character. It's the life behind
[20:57] it. That's the real name. So we are
[20:59] taught to let this mind be in you that
[21:02] was also in Christ Jesus. And as that
[21:04] related to the humility of Christ, it's
[21:06] really that mind to know what God wants
[21:08] done with the word. Not for show, not
[21:10] for pretense, not for publicity, not to
[21:13] bring followers to ourselves, but that
[21:14] the name of God could be lifted up. In
[21:18] the sermon, God of this evil age, he
[21:19] says, 'Now he is
[21:21] ready with this careful, selected,
[21:24] educated bride by his own knowledge, all
[21:27] painted up in his
[21:29] deceit of big buildings and big
[21:31] denominations and paints of knowledge
[21:32] and theology and smart and intellectual
[21:34] and educated to deceive the whole world
[21:36] and become a god. This is the spirit of
[21:39] the age that we're living in now. This
[21:40] is what characterizes Leodysia that he
[21:43] can use a painted up to deceive the
[21:47] false bride, false religion, spiritual
[21:49] wickedness is deceitfully
[21:53] painted. Big buildings, big
[21:55] denominations, paints of knowledge and
[21:57] theology, smart and intellectual,
[21:58] educated to deceive the world. That's
[22:01] what he's done. All heading up in the
[22:02] person of the antichrist, which is
[22:04] already crowned the vicor of God by his
[22:06] worldloving scientific bride. all
[22:08] dressed up of impump of intellectual
[22:11] religious
[22:12] education. She is made religious like
[22:15] him and by his own interpretation of the
[22:17] word of God as he did Eve as his son
[22:19] Cain did. This is how Satan is working
[22:22] and moving. This is the subtlety of how
[22:24] he moves today. Think of it more
[22:26] personally in your particular situation.
[22:28] Instead of thinking, "Oh my, the next
[22:30] pope could be the very thing that's
[22:31] going to challenge me at my core." Well,
[22:33] I don't know that you need to worry
[22:34] about that as a believer, but look at
[22:36] how Satan can work very closely to us,
[22:39] even in work situations, school
[22:41] situations, interpersonal situations,
[22:43] and political ways and economic ways,
[22:45] and all sorts of social ways and
[22:48] recreation and entertainment. And all of
[22:49] it is in reality the antichrist, the
[22:52] anti-word trying to scheme in a way to
[22:55] cause you to fail when it comes to the
[22:58] word of God. Amen. I know we could talk
[23:00] about great big moves and religious
[23:02] movements and false ministries, but just
[23:04] think of how he subtly tries to work
[23:06] against you in your mind. You have your
[23:08] own personal battle. The Holy Ghost is
[23:10] to come onto that battlefield and do uh
[23:12] fight for you to win that battle in the
[23:14] mind. And he's fight us in many
[23:15] different ways.
[23:17] What my son Preston may go through may
[23:19] be vastly different than what my
[23:20] daughter has to go through, but they're
[23:22] all fighting their own personal battle
[23:24] to to keep the word at the forefront.
[23:26] Amen.
[23:28] In Philippians 3:es
[23:31] 1-12, he says, "Finally, my brethren,
[23:34] rejoice in the Lord." Amen.
[23:40] He says, "To write the same thing to
[23:42] you, to me indeed is not grievious, but
[23:45] for you it is
[23:46] safe. Beware of
[23:49] dogs. Beware of evil workers. Beware of
[23:53] the concision." Now, beware of dogs
[23:55] isn't for the cat lovers. And he's not
[23:57] don't believe he's talking about canines
[23:59] in particular, but we know that he's
[24:01] talking about in this religious sense.
[24:03] What do dogs do? They always go back.
[24:05] He's talking about them going back to
[24:06] their vomit. Beware of those that would
[24:08] try to take advantage of you. Beware of
[24:09] evil workers. Beware of the concision.
[24:12] Says, "For we are the circumcision, not
[24:14] of Jews, but he says, which worship God
[24:16] in the spirit and rejoice in Christ
[24:18] Jesus and have no confidence in the
[24:22] flesh. This is where I'm wanting you
[24:24] just to kind of rightly divide it within
[24:26] your own hearts to recognize that we do
[24:28] not want to put any confidence in our
[24:30] flesh.
[24:32] That we're not putting our confidence in
[24:34] the flesh of the pastor or the prophet
[24:36] or somebody else. That where our
[24:37] confidence lies is in the word of God
[24:39] and the Holy Spirit that he's given me
[24:41] to feed on that word. And then Paul
[24:43] says, "Though I might also have
[24:45] confidence in the flesh, if any other
[24:48] man thinkketh that he hath whereof he
[24:50] might trust in the flesh, I more Paul
[24:52] the humble one circumcised the eighth
[24:55] day of the stock of Israel, of the tribe
[24:56] of Benjamin, and the Hebrew of the
[24:58] Hebrews, as touching the law of
[24:59] Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting
[25:02] the church, touching the righteousness
[25:03] which is in the law,
[25:06] blameless." But he says, "But what
[25:08] things were gained to me, those I
[25:09] counted loss for Christ." Yeah.
[25:12] doubtless and I count all things but
[25:14] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[25:16] of Christ Jesus my Lord. Whatever's in
[25:18] the flesh, I don't count it. I look for
[25:20] the intelligence of God. I look for the
[25:22] mind of Christ. Let this mind be in you
[25:25] that was in Christ Jesus. This is him
[25:27] describing how he lays aside everything
[25:29] else in and seeks the mind of God. Amen.
[25:32] Amen. for whom I have suffered the loss
[25:35] of all things and do count them but dung
[25:36] that I may win Christ and be found in
[25:38] him. Not having my own righteousness
[25:40] which is of the law, but that which is
[25:42] through the faith of Christ, the
[25:44] righteousness which is of God by faith.
[25:48] Not by being blameless under the law,
[25:51] not by zeal that persecutes the church,
[25:54] not a Hebrew of the Hebrews, not of your
[25:55] natural lineage, no confidence in the
[25:57] flesh, but in the mind of Christ, that I
[26:00] may know him in the power of
[26:01] resurrection, in the fellowship of his
[26:03] sufferings, being made conformable unto
[26:04] his death. If by any means I might
[26:06] attain to the resurrection of the dead,
[26:08] not as though I had already attained
[26:10] either, were already perfect, but I
[26:11] follow after, if that I may apprehend,
[26:14] here's the growing of the mind of
[26:16] Christ. Here's the releasing of that DNA
[26:18] that's in the word that I may
[26:20] apprehended that for which also I am
[26:22] apprehended of Christ Jesus. This is why
[26:24] he says he leaves everything else behind
[26:26] and he presses toward the mark for the
[26:28] prize of the high calling. He wants to
[26:30] reach forth. He wants to seek deeply.
[26:33] Wants the word to have preeminence.
[26:35] Amen.
[26:37] But Satan fighting against that would
[26:39] want us to trust in our flesh.
[26:42] I have not seen nor ear heard neither
[26:44] has entered into the heart of man. But
[26:45] yet sometimes we're just happy if we see
[26:47] it, if we hear it, if we can imagine it.
[26:52] If we can intellectually conceive it or
[26:54] emotionally feel it, we feel good. But
[26:58] that's the realm that Satan wants you to
[27:00] stay in. Those are the realms of the
[27:02] first and second
[27:03] pool. Those are not the realms of that
[27:05] secret place of the third pool. Amen.
[27:08] And the sermon choosing of the bride,
[27:09] brother Ram said, "And so is the church
[27:11] as it tries to achieve by science, by
[27:14] man-made scheme, is taking you farther
[27:17] away from God and into death more than
[27:19] it was at the first place." Science is
[27:22] that even in the Bible, science
[27:24] so-called, it's the it's that inquiry,
[27:26] scientific inquiry, it's knowledge. It
[27:29] would be the wrong kind of
[27:31] intelligence. He says, "Don't choose
[27:33] your church the same way you did your
[27:36] wife." Wow. All right. I'm listening.
[27:41] This is very interesting. Don't you wish
[27:43] Brother Brandham could podcast on this
[27:44] line alone for a while? Do not choose
[27:47] your church the same way you did your
[27:49] wife. Now, Brother Ram's being pretty
[27:51] hard because then in the sermon,
[27:52] Choosing the bride, he says you you
[27:54] picked her because she was pretty. You
[27:56] chose her because you were physically
[27:58] attracted.
[28:00] So, he says, "Don't choose your church
[28:01] the same way you chose your wife. What
[28:04] science did for her was a marvel, but
[28:07] you better keep away from your church on
[28:09] that. He made paints, powders, and all
[28:11] these other things. Choose by character
[28:14] of his word. He's going to go going to
[28:16] go into more detail, but he says, "Now,
[28:17] let us compare the natural bride of
[28:19] today with the so-called church bride of
[28:21] today."
[28:23] There is a false bride that is achieved
[28:25] through intellect and emotion and
[28:26] through paints and powers. The pretense
[28:29] of a great glorious gospel and a great
[28:31] move of God and all the kind of
[28:33] accutrants that you'd want to have in a
[28:35] church and ways that you could
[28:36] participate, ways that you could feel
[28:37] it, ways that your ears could be
[28:39] tickled. And brother Barham is saying
[28:40] that they have achieved that by the
[28:42] wrong kind of knowledge and that we are
[28:45] choosing our churches and our church
[28:47] experience after the flesh
[28:50] and not by the word of God, not by
[28:52] character.
[28:54] He talks about how if you took all the
[28:55] make off makeup off your wife, it'd
[28:57] scare you to
[28:58] death. And think about some of the
[29:00] churches that are made up. If you really
[29:01] got to the core of how it's run and how
[29:03] it's operated, the things that take
[29:04] place. You know why a lot of people uh
[29:06] the people that end up leaving the word
[29:08] of God are the ones that work closely to
[29:10] those who are preaching it. And
[29:12] sometimes they're leaving because what
[29:13] they see behind closed doors and they
[29:15] lose their confidence.
[29:18] Not in every case but in many
[29:21] cases. in Acts chapter
[29:24] 9:es 9-
[29:30] 24. We're we haven't gotten away from I
[29:34] know you're all going to go out and get
[29:35] cake tonight. I don't know where we can
[29:36] get cake at uh 9 9:00 or whatever it
[29:39] might be,
[29:40] but we want the real thing. Amen.
[29:45] I'm wanting to look at this from the
[29:47] angle of God, search my heart so that
[29:50] anything that's not of you, I would not
[29:53] put my trust in. Maybe it's not a matter
[29:56] of it being ripped out of our hearts and
[29:58] no longer being able to uh have this or
[30:00] do this or do that, but I'm not going to
[30:02] let it have preeminence. I'm not going
[30:03] to put my trust in it. You may be very
[30:06] skilled. You may have a lot of things
[30:07] that whenever things get difficult,
[30:08] you're like, "Oh, well, I can always
[30:10] fall back on that." or you really get
[30:11] challenged in your faith and your belief
[30:13] and you say, "Well, I can always go to
[30:14] that and you have a tiepost and anchor."
[30:16] But if God doesn't want that to be your
[30:18] typost, if that's a false security, then
[30:20] God's going to expose it. So that at the
[30:23] end of the day, you just say, "Lord, I
[30:24] believe in you and that's it. I got
[30:26] nothing else. It's but faith and trust
[30:28] in you." Now, I believe these things are
[30:31] uh taken together with what we
[30:32] ministered on Sunday will represent this
[30:35] and and the uh a broader picture and
[30:37] even these several sermons in a row on
[30:39] this using this challenge. Do we really
[30:42] have faith or is it something that would
[30:43] crumble under pressure? Look at this in
[30:46] Acts 8:es 9 to 24. And there was a
[30:48] certain man called Simon which before
[30:50] time in the same city used sorcery. What
[30:54] is going on with all the witches,
[30:56] exorcists, and wizards in the book of
[30:58] Acts?
[31:00] used sorcery and bewitched the people of
[31:02] Samaria, giving out that himself was
[31:04] some great one. So he used some power to
[31:08] woo the people into thinking that he had
[31:10] wisdom and he had power to whom they all
[31:13] gave heed from the least to the greatest
[31:14] saying this man is the great power of
[31:18] God. There was some attribution to what
[31:20] this man was doing to God and not just
[31:23] attribution to God wherein God would see
[31:24] the glory but rather this man received
[31:27] the glory. Be careful of the 11 in your
[31:30] heart that when a God uses a man to do
[31:32] something that you in the slightest way
[31:35] elevate the man.
[31:38] Remember when we were ministering on
[31:40] divine healing that God will use signs,
[31:42] wonders, discernment, all sorts of
[31:44] miracles so that our faith and our
[31:46] confidence would resolve on Christ. But
[31:48] if it ever begins to loop back into the
[31:50] man, the hands, or the sign, then that
[31:52] you've gotten off of the beaten track
[31:54] and you've missed what God was doing
[31:56] because you make an idol out of the
[31:57] hands. We could argue all day long,
[32:00] well, is that God? Was that God? Was
[32:01] that God? Was that man? Was it real? Was
[32:02] it God? But if your faith doesn't
[32:04] resolve on the word and you make an idol
[32:07] out of the hands of the man, what does
[32:08] it matter? God or not? It didn't
[32:10] accomplish for you what it ought to
[32:12] have.
[32:14] said to whom all gave heed and thought
[32:16] he was a great this man is the great
[32:17] power of God and to him they had regard
[32:21] because that of long time he had
[32:23] bewitched them with sorceries. Remember
[32:25] the Galatians church had be been
[32:27] bewitched into carnal discipline apart
[32:31] from the word of God to make themselves
[32:33] perfect. And then the
[32:36] great change and brother Brandon the
[32:39] church age book says Simon the sorcerer
[32:41] impersonated Peter. That's where I'm
[32:43] drawing that from even in my summary
[32:45] there. He says but when they believed
[32:46] Philillip preaching the things
[32:48] concerning the kingdom of God in the
[32:50] name of Jesus Christ they were baptized
[32:52] both men and
[32:54] women. So they believe Philip when he's
[32:57] preaching they believe and are baptized.
[33:00] Then Simon himself believed also. And
[33:03] when he was baptized, he continued with
[33:05] Philip and wondered, beholding the
[33:06] miracles and signs which were done. Now
[33:09] when you think of this, this sounds to
[33:11] be a great uh uh conversion of Simon the
[33:16] sorcerer. And then the Bible says, "Now
[33:18] when the apostles which were at
[33:19] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[33:21] received the word of God, they sent unto
[33:22] them Peter and John, who when they were
[33:25] come down prayed for them that they
[33:26] might receive the Holy Ghost. For as it
[33:28] yet had he was fallen upon none of them,
[33:30] only they were baptized in the name of
[33:32] the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their
[33:34] hands on them, and they received the
[33:36] Holy Ghost. If you're following your
[33:37] Bibles, just pause for a moment. There's
[33:40] this religious man, this one working
[33:42] sorceries. The word of God comes and the
[33:45] people believe and he in the narrative
[33:48] kind of it looks like as if he believes
[33:50] secondarily after all these other people
[33:51] seem to be grabbing a hold of it. He
[33:53] believes and he follows Philillip and
[33:56] beholds the miracles and signs which are
[33:58] done. So he appears to be continuing.
[34:01] He's with the crowd. He's with the
[34:02] group. He's lingering. He seems to be
[34:04] believing. And now he sees that through
[34:06] the laying on of hands, the Holy Ghost
[34:07] comes. And when Simon saw that through
[34:10] laying on of the apostles hands, the
[34:12] Holy Ghost was given. He offered them
[34:14] money.
[34:16] He wanted to subscribe. He wanted to
[34:18] monetize. He wanted to find ways that he
[34:20] could get a following himself. He
[34:21] offered them money, saying, "Give me
[34:23] also this power that on whomsoever I lay
[34:25] hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost."
[34:28] There's a lot here that we could begin
[34:30] to unpack unpack in that the mind can
[34:33] even reach for something genuine, but
[34:35] have that guile or this uh this leaven
[34:39] of thinking that we can somehow buy it
[34:41] or gain it through our own efforts and
[34:44] means and then utilize it. He was
[34:46] willing to pay for it. Certainly he saw
[34:49] other ways to monetize it, get his money
[34:51] back. But Peter said unto him, this is
[34:54] where you really need to focus. Thy
[34:55] money perish with thee, because thou
[34:57] hast thought that the gift of God may be
[34:59] purchased with money. Thou hast neither
[35:02] part nor lot in this matter, for thy
[35:05] heart is not right in the sight of God.
[35:09] Outwardly as we watch Simon the sorcerer
[35:11] go from a sorcerer and a witch doctor
[35:14] and one who's doing all sorts of signs
[35:16] and wonders to be the people to one who
[35:18] hears the word and believes and is
[35:20] baptized and seems to be following. But
[35:22] then something is done that kind of
[35:23] exposes something in Simon's heart. He's
[35:25] like, I'd like to buy this. I'd like to
[35:27] be able to do what you're doing. And
[35:28] Peter says, your heart is not right.
[35:32] He says, repent thereof of this w
[35:34] thereof. Repent therefore of th this thy
[35:38] wickedness and pray God if perhaps the
[35:40] thought of thine heart may be forgiven
[35:42] thee. Repent so that these things that
[35:44] are still in thy heart can be expuned
[35:46] from you be torn out of your heart. For
[35:48] I perceive that thou art in the gall of
[35:51] bitterness. It's using a language of
[35:53] Deuteronomy where when one would serve
[35:55] other gods that there would be this gall
[35:56] of bitterness and in the bond of
[35:58] iniquity wherein in Proverbs it talks
[36:00] about how sin is bound up in the heart
[36:02] of
[36:02] one. You're in the gall of bitterness
[36:05] and in the bond of
[36:07] iniquity. Very promising response from
[36:10] Simon. Verse 24. Pray ye to the Lord for
[36:14] me that none of these things which you
[36:15] have
[36:16] spoken come upon
[36:18] me. I know in many Bibles it said that
[36:21] he receives the Lord on the
[36:23] headings. But here in this process of
[36:26] his own conversion, something false had
[36:29] to be exposed in his heart. the gall of
[36:32] bitterness and the bond of iniquity.
[36:35] It's that word exposing the unbelief.
[36:39] Think of how that if Peter had just said
[36:41] even for our own instruction, oh well
[36:43] you can't buy this. We all say yeah yet
[36:45] you can't buy this. But yet there's some
[36:46] mechanism in his heart wherein he's
[36:48] following even if it was through his
[36:50] sincerity is there's a pause to expose
[36:53] the
[36:54] impersonation expose the pretending
[36:58] where we could try because you could you
[37:00] imagine what would happen to Simon if he
[37:02] tried to cast out a devil or pretend to
[37:04] give the Holy Ghost by laying on of
[37:05] hands because he had bought that power
[37:08] God could not honor it right
[37:12] there was this critical moment where
[37:13] anything that is not of him anything
[37:15] that's not right needs to be kind of
[37:17] worked out of us to find out whether or
[37:19] not we have faith
[37:22] now Joshua chapter 7 we read this in the
[37:24] beginning so I think I'll just kind of
[37:26] uh summarize this as we read through
[37:28] this in Joshua 7:es
[37:31] 1-6 it tells us that the children of
[37:34] Israel had committed a trespass in the
[37:36] oursed thing and that Achen had taken
[37:39] these thing and that caused God's anger
[37:41] to be kindled against them. We recognize
[37:44] in the scripture through the last
[37:46] several weeks of how that the failure to
[37:49] honor God's word brings about
[37:51] consequences. Says in Joshua chapter 7
[37:54] 21, Achen says, "When I saw the spoils
[37:56] of the goodly Babylonian garment and 200
[37:59] shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of
[38:01] 50 shekels weight, then I coveted them
[38:03] and took them and behold, they are hid
[38:05] in the earth in the midst of my tent and
[38:07] the silver under it." He was told to
[38:10] have nothing to do with it. But yet
[38:12] through his own greed, his covetousness,
[38:16] he takes them and he hides them in the
[38:20] center of his
[38:21] tent, something that he knew, the
[38:23] spoils, and it was a Babylonious garment
[38:26] 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of
[38:28] gold of 50 shekels weight. And he takes
[38:30] them and he so is covetous of them, he
[38:33] hides them. So this is an air that's in
[38:37] Achen's heart. And we know there's death
[38:39] comes upon Achen as a result of this.
[38:42] But with this transgression against God
[38:46] in unknowns to Joshua, he sends men from
[38:49] Jericho to I and he says, "Go view it to
[38:53] find out, you know, what's next." And if
[38:54] we'll recognize in the pattern of
[38:56] scripture, God had been telling Joshua
[38:58] what to do. And here he just presumes
[39:00] after a great victory, he kind of
[39:01] presumes, "Wow, look how good we are. We
[39:03] destroyed Zer Jericho." And didn't take
[39:05] time to course correct, examine
[39:07] themselves, go before the Lord, and ask
[39:09] God what they could do next. Because had
[39:11] they consulted the Lord, God could have
[39:13] very well said, "Every man needs to
[39:15] sanctify himself in his heart and
[39:18] examined what's at the heart of his tent
[39:20] before he goes forward, lest you meet
[39:22] failure."
[39:25] They could have been challenged in that
[39:27] moment, man by man. The same way that it
[39:29] was done after the fact, it could have
[39:30] been done before the fact had Joshua
[39:32] waited on the Lord and they had examined
[39:34] themselves as they rightfully should
[39:35] have.
[39:37] But they go and when they see these heap
[39:39] of
[39:40] stones, they said, "Well, we don't need
[39:42] to take all of our men. Just two or
[39:44] three thousand because they're but a
[39:46] few." But when they went up, they fled
[39:48] before the men of I. And the men of I
[39:50] smoke them. 36 men die. And they're
[39:53] chased away. And as they're chased away,
[39:55] the courage and the heart of the people
[39:57] melted and became like water. Then
[39:59] Joshua, they fell on their face before
[40:02] God. and they covered themselves with
[40:03] dust because the group that was supposed
[40:05] to be
[40:06] victorious, every enemy would be
[40:08] vanquished before them could not stand
[40:10] before a heap of
[40:14] stones. And I know it's just a little
[40:16] bit of a play on words, but let me put
[40:18] it this way. If you don't resolve those
[40:22] things that are lacking in your faith,
[40:24] you won't be able to meet the challenge
[40:26] of the hour. Amen. I think it was with
[40:28] my son Elliot that was fellowshipping on
[40:29] it that if you if you cannot if there's
[40:32] things lacking you can't you won't match
[40:35] AI the things that are coming upon this
[40:37] earth the tools that the devil uses the
[40:39] algorithm however you want to look at it
[40:41] you are not a match for how much it can
[40:43] hook into your your dopamine cycles and
[40:45] how much it can hook into your habits
[40:47] and your your instinctive things that
[40:49] there's a way that it's going to work
[40:50] against you and it's going to expose any
[40:52] weakness in your heart any area that's
[40:54] not opened up and allow the Lord has
[40:56] allowed to come into.
[40:58] If we're going to conquer, if we're
[41:00] going to overcome, if the word of God is
[41:02] going to grow mightily and prevail, then
[41:05] he's got to go into our hearts and root
[41:07] out any unbelief.
[41:10] I was going to take first Peter chapter
[41:12] 1 as my text. So many things that you
[41:14] could read in here and how that there's
[41:16] going to be uh this revealing at the end
[41:18] time, this grace that is to be brought
[41:20] to us, something that's going to fortify
[41:21] our minds. We're going to g up the loins
[41:23] of our mind. We're going to hope to the
[41:24] end cuz in this battle of the mind we
[41:26] need Christ the word on the battlefront
[41:29] on the front line.
[41:32] Says wherein ye greatly rejoice though
[41:34] now for a season. 1 Peter chapter 1 6
[41:37] and 7. If need be you are in heaviness
[41:39] through manifold
[41:42] temptations. This is where I want you to
[41:44] think of this that there's
[41:46] suffering and these things. First Pete
[41:50] boy I'm I really need an editor.
[41:53] We got power puffs and first Pete. What
[41:55] else have I missed today? More
[41:57] precarious than
[41:59] gold.
[42:00] Putrified. Lord, help me. I was in a
[42:03] rush
[42:03] today. First Pete. I kind of like that.
[42:06] It's
[42:12] okay. He says, "We greatly rejoice even
[42:14] though now you might be going through
[42:16] it.
[42:17] Don't ever think that your trial, your
[42:20] testing, your manifold temptations, your
[42:23] discouragements, your torment, your
[42:25] torture, whatever it might be, is the
[42:27] evidence that you're not a son of God.
[42:30] Don't count it as evidence that you
[42:31] don't have any faith. Just count your
[42:34] your improper reaction to the test as
[42:37] evidence you need more faith.
[42:40] Be disappointed in your response, but
[42:41] don't question whether or not God loves
[42:43] you. Don't look at and say, "Well, I
[42:45] should have conducted myself better." Do
[42:46] we realize that we could use a
[42:48] particular psychology about our own
[42:50] mistakes to where we would all have to
[42:52] concede we ain't got it. We're just
[42:53] pretending. So, let's figure out a way
[42:55] to make this a little bit more enjoyable
[42:56] to the flesh and then we can start
[42:58] playing church. We have skits, right, on
[43:01] Sunday mornings instead of the word.
[43:03] Wednesday nights could just be uh eg
[43:05] slushies and In-N-Out cheeseburgers or
[43:08] something.
[43:11] It says, "The trial of your faith being
[43:13] much more precious than of gold that
[43:16] perisheth." Your faith is more precious
[43:18] than gold. Why I chose to use gold as
[43:21] faith in the our graphic at the
[43:23] beginning. Though it be tried with
[43:27] fire, your faith is more precious than
[43:29] gold and faith tried becomes purified
[43:32] gold. So that even the trial is more
[43:36] precious to us. Amen. Our faith being
[43:39] tried produces a purified faith that it
[43:42] might be found under praise and honor
[43:43] and glory at the peering of Jesus
[43:45] Christ. He is to perfect that which is
[43:47] lacking in our faith. We humbly come
[43:49] before God and say, "Lord, I believe I
[43:51] have faith. Help thou the unbelief in my
[43:54] mind, the human tendencies, my eye, what
[43:56] my eye sees, what my ear hears, and what
[43:58] enters into my heart. Lord, those things
[44:00] that I humanly put rest my senses on and
[44:03] my imaginations on and my affections on,
[44:05] even if it be towards you, I don't want
[44:07] to be an Limus. I don't want to be a
[44:09] damsel following Paul. I don't be a want
[44:11] to be Simon the Sorcerer. I don't want
[44:12] to be a son ofKeva. I want to I don't
[44:14] want to be a false bride. I want to be a
[44:16] real true genuine believer from that
[44:18] soul realm who puts his trust in your
[44:20] word. Amen. And has confidence in your
[44:23] word that you'll see me through. Amen.
[44:26] And our faith is tried so that we can
[44:28] learn what's cake and what's word.
[44:31] So that we won't be sitting and resting
[44:34] on something that's false.
[44:39] The sermon the oddball there's a number
[44:40] of statements I came across when last
[44:42] year when I was studying on art and how
[44:44] brother Brandham constantly referred to
[44:45] these kind of cheap reproductions of
[44:47] art. He says I can imagine the very
[44:49] first church what they were and compare
[44:51] it with this reproduction today.
[44:54] Remember, brother Brandham saying to all
[44:56] these powderpuff hybrid Christians and
[45:00] how they can't stand the test. They have
[45:01] to be babyed into it. It's a similar
[45:04] thing here. He says this would be a
[45:06] cheap production of what the real first
[45:07] church was. That rugged believers in God
[45:10] with the Holy Ghost. You babyed not
[45:13] them. You didn't have to pat them and
[45:16] tell them. You take them in this one.
[45:18] And if they got get tired that one, they
[45:20] go to another one. You'll make them a
[45:22] deacon if they come over here and leave
[45:23] this other one. That's a hybrid
[45:26] reproduction.
[45:28] People will hold to their post and watch
[45:31] and watch everything die around them
[45:33] instead of obey God. Says, "I was
[45:36] thinking of Michelangelo's original
[45:37] painting, I believe, of the Last Supper.
[45:39] I think he painted
[45:42] it. Leonardo da Vinci, otherwise known
[45:45] as Michelangelo. Here, do you realize
[45:48] what the original picture would cost
[45:49] you? It would be countless thousands of
[45:53] dollars. Would never touch that original
[45:55] because it's beyond price. It's so
[45:58] valued so high. I would love to own a
[46:00] Van Go. And the only way I'm going to do
[46:02] it is if I find one at a flea market
[46:04] that somehow has escaped everyone else's
[46:06] attention. But you can buy a cheap
[46:08] reproduction of it for about
[46:12] $2. That's why people today can't
[46:14] understand the ruggedness of real
[46:16] genuine believers.
[46:20] cheap reproductions won't stand the
[46:21] scrutiny, right? There's even some
[46:24] reproductions that can withstand some
[46:27] scrutiny and be determined to be a
[46:29] really good knockoff, but it's not going
[46:32] to in the end it's still going to be
[46:33] exposed as a fake. Right now, how no
[46:36] matter how long it may exist within the
[46:38] arena as being bonafideed, eventually
[46:40] when examined by the real thing, it's
[46:42] like no cannot be.
[46:45] people today can understand the
[46:46] ruggedness of real, true, genuine,
[46:49] authentic
[46:53] believers. So, I want to bring us to
[46:55] this my last uh scripture reading
[46:58] tonight in Luke chapter
[47:00] 18. Helps me resolve on why I chose to
[47:04] use kind of a catchy title of faith or
[47:07] cake.
[47:11] I saw a video one time of uh Oreos, I
[47:14] think it was, being burnt and uh they
[47:17] they wouldn't
[47:18] burn. And it makes you think, what are
[47:21] in those things? Kind of like leaving
[47:23] certain foods out for weeks and days at
[47:25] a time and nothing touches it. There's
[47:26] no ants, there's no flies, nothing. So
[47:28] fake and synthetic that real things
[47:30] don't want to eat it. Reminds me of the
[47:33] time I was in Africa and I had some, you
[47:35] know, beef jerky that I brought from the
[47:37] States. And as we're driving through
[47:40] these towns or whatever, we see these
[47:42] fish just laying on the ground and sides
[47:44] of meat just hanging in the sun. And I'm
[47:46] driving through and my stomach just is
[47:48] turning. I'm like, "Oh man, how could
[47:49] they eat that? How can they eat that?"
[47:50] And I offered our driver some beef jerky
[47:52] and they were like, "I wouldn't eat
[47:54] that." And it dawned on me, "Wow, this
[47:58] is this is this is fake and synthetic
[48:01] and is not good for they wouldn't want
[48:03] to eat that. It would do worse to their
[48:04] stomach when what the real thing hanging
[48:06] in the sunlight would do to
[48:15] mine. Lord, help
[48:21] us to not have
[48:23] that beautiful looking enticing morsel
[48:28] of something that is so synthetic. It
[48:30] does us no nutritional good.
[48:35] that won't
[48:36] stand in the time of need. If you've
[48:39] ever fallen, if you've ever gotten weak,
[48:41] if you've ever been discouraged, if
[48:42] you've ever backslid or gone into a tail
[48:43] spin, it's not because you're not elect,
[48:45] it's because you were resting in
[48:47] something that wasn't the
[48:49] word. Luke 18:es 1 to8, and he spake a
[48:52] parable unto them to this end. This is
[48:54] what he's wanting to teach them that men
[48:57] ought to always pray. Always to pray and
[48:59] not to faint, become weary or exhausted,
[49:01] give up. So, we're to pray. In our
[49:04] devotion last night, it spoke of this
[49:05] room in a house which was that place of
[49:08] prayer. And that if that one is empty,
[49:10] if it's not inhabited, if it becomes
[49:12] stagnant and old and the hinges of that
[49:14] door rust off, then that's a place of
[49:16] failure. We ought to always pray and to
[49:18] not faint, become weary and exhausted.
[49:20] And this is the parable that he uses to
[49:22] teach us to always be seeking God in
[49:25] this communion and fellowship with him
[49:27] and to not get exhausted or weary. He
[49:29] says there was a city in a city of judge
[49:31] which feared God feared not God neither
[49:34] regarded guarded man and there was a
[49:36] widow in that city and she came unto him
[49:39] saying avenge me of my adversary. and he
[49:42] would not for a while. But afterward he
[49:44] said within himself, "Though I fear not
[49:45] God, nor regard man, yet because this
[49:48] widow troubleth me, I will avenge her,
[49:50] lest by her continual coming, she weary
[49:53] me." Now, think of what's happening
[49:55] here. An unjust judge who keeps having
[49:58] the same woman never give up and keeps
[50:02] coming over and over and over. and he's
[50:06] never responded to this point. But
[50:07] because she knows this man has the power
[50:09] and the and the ability to avenge her of
[50:12] her adversaries, she never stops. Even
[50:15] in the face of no, even in the face of
[50:17] go away, even in the face of not
[50:18] responding, ignored, ignored, ignored,
[50:20] being left on red over and over and over
[50:22] again. Keeps coming, keeps coming, keeps
[50:25] coming. And the Lord said, "Hear what
[50:26] the unjust judge saith.
[50:29] And shall not God avenge his own elect,
[50:32] which cry day and night unto him?
[50:35] There's your seeking. There's your
[50:36] pursuing. There's your diligently
[50:38] following after to apprehend, and to
[50:40] know, though he bear along with them.
[50:43] There's the rebuffing in the same manner
[50:45] that the unjust judge did. He says, I
[50:47] tell you that he will avenge him
[50:49] speedily. But here comes the question.
[50:51] When the son of man cometh, shall he
[50:53] find faith on earth? Right?
[50:56] In other words, the son of man is
[50:59] looking for faith that will not give up.
[51:02] Looking for a faith that will not go
[51:04] back. A faith that'll enter into the
[51:05] promised land and look at a vast arid
[51:08] desert with no grass or water for their
[51:10] cattle and and and and crops and things.
[51:13] But the knows that God promised that if
[51:15] I obey him, this desert will turn into a
[51:18] beautiful lush ground where I can grow
[51:20] the vineyard, I can grow the grain, I
[51:23] can feed my cattle, I can have milk and
[51:25] honey. or will it stop and give up and
[51:27] go back to the wrong side of faith where
[51:30] it can trust in the flesh?
[51:33] When the son of man cometh, will he find
[51:35] faith? He's looking for that kind of
[51:37] faith that keeps coming, keeps going,
[51:40] keeps pursuing even though I doesn't see
[51:44] and ear doesn't hear, ear doesn't hear,
[51:46] and he can't imagine a way out. Can't
[51:48] imagine what it would look like when he
[51:50] didn't feel this way. Can't imagine what
[51:51] it would be like to be healed. Can't can
[51:53] it? But he keeps pursuing God.
[51:56] There's your faith or cake. Faith that
[51:59] endures. It perseveres despite the
[52:01] struggle. Despite the fight, despite the
[52:03] despite the lingering, it can withstand
[52:06] the pressure.
[52:09] The sermon the mighty God unveiled
[52:11] before. He says, "Take a flower that's
[52:13] raised in a hot bed. You have to baby
[52:16] it, pet it, spray it, water it. But that
[52:19] original plant that grows out there on
[52:21] the desert, same kind of a flower, looks
[52:24] like it. It don't get a bit of water,
[52:26] but no bugs get on it. It's rugged. It's
[52:29] real. He said, "Could you compare
[52:32] Christianity with Christianity today
[52:35] with what it was then? You realize how
[52:37] many problems we have today because of
[52:39] the genetics al genetic altering they've
[52:42] done to plants to make them resistant
[52:45] and to make them a certain way.
[52:48] Yet there's something about the
[52:51] original. Could you compare Christianity
[52:54] with Christianity today with what it was
[52:59] then? This speaks to in my heart to my
[53:02] original my inspiration in all this is
[53:04] what what does Christ look like today?
[53:05] Do we have to start dressing up like
[53:07] pilgrims? Should we try to get a beat on
[53:09] what the the the apostles must address
[53:12] and and do we all need to go to Israel
[53:14] and pretend to be Jews? Could you
[53:16] imagine this group what we call
[53:17] Christians today across the world being
[53:19] like those was after Pentecost baby and
[53:22] padded from one church to another
[53:24] something like you don't like say
[53:25] something you don't like get up and walk
[53:27] out could you imagine that no what's the
[53:30] matter it's a
[53:33] reproduction it's a
[53:35] reproduction Michelangelo that created
[53:37] the monument to Moses you can get a
[53:39] reproduction of that very cheap you can
[53:41] get what you can get it from uh forest
[53:44] lawn gift shop online. You can order it
[53:46] online. $50. But the original, the one
[53:50] who painted the Lord's Supper, I guess
[53:51] that original painting would run in the
[53:53] millions of dollars if you could even
[53:55] buy it. I don't even know where it's at,
[53:58] but you can buy a cheap production of
[53:59] it. About a
[54:01] $1.98. I did a puzzle one year for
[54:03] Thanksgiving. Took me a lot longer than
[54:05] just that weekend. It was the Lord's
[54:06] Supper. It was one of the hardest
[54:07] puzzles I've ever done in my life. So,
[54:10] you can even buy the puzzle. And that's
[54:12] what it is today. a cheap Christian, a
[54:15] reproduction, just a church joiner. You
[54:18] can buy them out for a cigarette or a
[54:20] common
[54:21] drink. What's our
[54:24] price? Or a woman with cut hair or
[54:27] painted lips. You can buy her for
[54:28] anything in the fashions of the world,
[54:30] but you can't touch that genuine. That's
[54:33] why I summarized it. The genuine will
[54:35] not sell out for what is
[54:37] fake. Cheap gen those cheap
[54:39] reproductions. He says you can't touch
[54:40] that genuine. I see him in full view.
[54:43] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[54:44] He says, "Oh, Christian, don't you want
[54:46] to be a real Christian?"
[54:48] And if you want to be a real Christian
[54:50] may not be nec necessary for conversion,
[54:53] though some may need to repent and our
[54:54] young people, repent, be baptized in the
[54:56] name of Jesus Christ, call upon the Lord
[54:58] to be saved and that quickening power of
[55:00] God come and regenerate the life of God
[55:01] according to the seed that's in us and
[55:03] produce the power of God down in our
[55:05] souls. But yet, for some of us, what
[55:06] we're needing more is a continual
[55:08] washing and the growing to where all
[55:10] that is fake can be flushed out of us.
[55:13] grow in the mind of Christ. Let it push
[55:15] out all that isn't real. And I could
[55:17] testify myself. I don't like to insert
[55:19] my own testimony into this very often,
[55:22] but to the point that I could speak to
[55:23] this that what I've gone through and
[55:25] experienced many times and I was going
[55:26] to uh include the statement from CS
[55:28] Lewis and how that in all his trials and
[55:31] I think it might have been in his book
[55:32] on grief through everything he went
[55:34] through, God wasn't putting him through
[55:36] a test so that God could figure out what
[55:38] was in him. God knows what he put in
[55:40] you. God knows he he can he can use you
[55:43] if you can just yield to him. But it's
[55:45] us that has to find out what's a house
[55:47] of cards. It's us has to find out what
[55:50] we've been trusted in and relying on is
[55:52] really cake and not faith.
[55:55] That's why I say quite often to us and
[55:57] even this year, we should not be afraid
[55:59] to find out that what I was trusting in
[56:01] was not him. So that we can just
[56:04] refocus,
[56:06] put our trust in him. Amen. A lot of
[56:08] what we go through anymore, I think time
[56:10] and time again as we come into perfect
[56:11] faith and we come to have the mind of
[56:13] Christ is only believe, trust him, trust
[56:17] and obey. I want to trust in him. I'm
[56:19] learning to trust. He's teaching me. I
[56:21] can trust. We're coming to that place in
[56:23] the absence of all sorts of fanatic in
[56:26] our own garden of Gethsemane as it were.
[56:27] When it seems as if we're coming to the
[56:29] end, we can say, "Lord, I believe in
[56:31] you. Not my will but thine.
[56:35] Lord, examine me.
[56:37] find what is lacking. See if there be
[56:40] any wicked way in me
[56:43] and Lord just purge me, purify my heart,
[56:46] my mind in the battle in this mind. Let
[56:48] me say it again. If you haven't been
[56:49] born again, you must be born again. To
[56:52] those of us who've been born again, as
[56:53] we've been born again, as we have, we
[56:54] want the mind of Christ to be in us by
[56:56] the renewing of our mind be transformed
[56:58] into Christ's
[57:01] today. Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[57:07] our musicians, you could come. Brother
[57:09] Phillip, if you could be ready to me
[57:12] just turn it over to you shortly. Let's
[57:14] stand to our feet. Let's pray
[57:20] together. You even challenge
[57:23] yourself and the devil's trying to
[57:25] allure
[57:26] you, trying to entice you. Say, "Not
[57:30] devil. I ain't eating cake today.
[57:34] No cake for me. Sorry, I don't want it.
[57:37] I want the real thing.
[57:39] Heavenly Father, Lord, tonight as we
[57:43] close this service, as we ponder our own
[57:45] condition, our weaknesses, and the
[57:47] things that we fight and struggle and
[57:49] try to work
[57:51] through, Lord, it can be very difficult.
[57:54] I know in my own life through some of my
[57:57] darkest trials and things that I've
[58:00] suffered that the devil could just get
[58:02] me to be
[58:04] afraid and I would I'd start to worry
[58:08] and I'd start to
[58:10] fret. That's when I would act out of
[58:14] character. And Lord, I desire tonight
[58:17] that you would continue this great
[58:18] healing that you've begun in my
[58:20] life toward even when I do something
[58:23] wrong or made a mistake, I can with
[58:25] confidence as a son come back to you and
[58:27] say, "Lord, forgive me. I've been wrong.
[58:29] I I haven't done what I ought
[58:32] to." And Lord, it's when we let the
[58:34] devil push us around and we begin to
[58:36] kind of want to be babyed and we start
[58:37] pouting and we start wallering and we
[58:39] start whining that you begin to say,
[58:41] "Why cry? Speak. I've done enough. I've
[58:44] shown you enough. I proved enough. Take
[58:46] it. Be rugged.
[58:48] You're built for it.
[58:51] Oh, Lord, I pray that we could rise
[58:54] up. Meet the challenge of the hour. Not
[58:56] because we trust in our flesh, but
[58:57] because we trust in your word. My faith
[59:00] is resting solidly on you
[59:03] said. Lord, may we not venture or
[59:06] presume to be able to defeat
[59:08] Aiiah. But Lord, examine ourselves
[59:10] knowing that if there be any weakness,
[59:12] any gall of bitterness, any stronghold
[59:14] of iniquity, Lord, that it will be
[59:16] exposed when we face the enemy on that
[59:17] battlefield. And it had to the extent
[59:20] it's been exposed, Lord, we just say,
[59:21] "Father, forgive us. We ventured without
[59:23] authority. We got weak. We got in the
[59:25] flesh. Lord, forgive me. Make me strong,
[59:28] Lord. Purify my heart. I want to do
[59:31] what's right in your sight.
[59:34] Bless us tonight. those who are here,
[59:36] gathered in your presence, who've looked
[59:37] to you, who've listened. May we be like
[59:40] that woman in Luke chapter 18. May we
[59:42] never give up, never turn away. May we
[59:45] have the kind of faith that won't wilt
[59:47] under pressure, that won't be stamped
[59:49] out because of a no. That won't reverse
[59:51] course and go
[59:53] back, but we'll have the kind of faith
[59:55] that the Son of Man is looking for.
[59:56] Rugged, perseverant, believing,
[1:00:00] strong. It's got hair on its chest.
[1:00:02] Amen. Help us, Lord. I pray in this end
[1:00:05] time to rise above it all, rise to the
[1:00:08] challenge. Lord, even as the song is
[1:00:10] being played, I want to set my wings to
[1:00:13] the winds of
[1:00:14] faith, knowing that if I could just take
[1:00:16] what you've put in me and placed in me,
[1:00:18] this innate ability by the new birth
[1:00:21] that according to your word, I'll rise
[1:00:24] above it all. Bless your people tonight
[1:00:26] as we worship. We ask all this in the
[1:00:28] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:29] Christ. Amen.
[1:00:32] Thank
