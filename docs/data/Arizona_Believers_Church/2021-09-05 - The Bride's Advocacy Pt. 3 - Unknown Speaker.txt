TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it was here in first corinthians chapter nine that we left off wednesday night so we want to jump right back into some of these things and i don't think that there'll be any anything lost in not being able if you didn't hear wednesday night service but we're speaking on the subject of the bride's advocacy and this is continuing on how we identified that we have an advocate with the father this advocate is connected with the mercy seat and then we begin to realize that this advocate is not only before the father but it's within us and it's an advocate that we have as an inner strength and an inner teacher and it that kind of turns around now that with that on our side we have a ministry and we have an advocacy and we're wanting to go slowly through this first corinthians chapter 9 verse 19 for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more he's actually talking about gaining souls and gaining salvation and of the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law gentiles that would still observe judaic tradition and observe the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law to the weak i became his weak that i might gain the weak and i made all things to all men that i might by all means save some all means to save some all means is not worth it if we save all right but if we just save some all means is worth it and says and this i do notice the reason why it is done for the gospel sake that i might be partaker thereof with you he does it for the gospel sake and then even though the next few verses though we don't have them as part of our text he's talking about how that not everyone runs who runs in a race receives a prize but he says run that you may obtain if you're going to strive for the master you have to be temperate and he's actually talking about when he keeps under his body and he brings it under subjection uh he's talking about being effective as a witness not questioning his salvation but being an effective representation of the gospel because then he continues in chapter 10 where we'll get to today about doing all to the glory of god and then calls back to these very verses about being all things to all men let's bow our heads in a word of prayer our heavenly father we're so happy this morning we feel such a an appropriate and spiritual lightness in us where we're not burdened or anxious we're not nervous we're not moved by fearful signs in the world today we're not moved by economics not even troubled by a heat wave lord we're just happy in our spirits and we know there's a lot of challenges that we face as families as young men and young ladies that their circumstances that lay before us that we're not quite sure how we're going to make it we're not even sure what it'll look like on the other side but can we father today is my prayer just accept your leadership and your guidance know that you're working all things for our good but most of all for your glory so i pray today that as we are in your presence that you'll speak to us plainly by your word and it being plain and being articulated in a manner that is pleasing to your spirit and in line in harmony with your character may souls be lifted up there be anyone who's lost today may they be found if there be anyone sick may they be healed there'd be those who are wondering lord i'm gonna give this one last try speak to me or somebody seeking a vision from you lord and just i say pour out your spirit upon us speak to our hearts move in our midst we have no no other idea lord except to lift you up and we know that if you are lifted up you'll draw men unto you so we pray that you bless the reading of the word bless your people as we minister we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you you can be seated if you could turn your bibles to revelations chapter 22 verse 17 this was our text on wednesday night i'd like to start here it has um some principles that we'd like to keep before you as we go forward in the bride's advocacy or you could say our advocacy we don't use the terminology bride in any way to become exclusive but the bride is the body of christ it's a terminology bride is used in revelation and the body of christ used in the new testament paul identifying that the church of god or the church of christ is the body of christ and so that's what we're talking about the body of christ has an advocacy the bride's advocacy but i think and i kind of kept it as the bride's advocacy and the naming convention because we had called it the bride's advocate and i realized it might have been better to say our advocate and our advocacy so that's our little secret for those who don't go anywhere further than just looking at the titles online this is our advocacy it says in revelations chapter 22 verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come so this is a ministry that the bride has not apart from the spirit but together with the spirit they've harmonized so much so to where they're saying the same thing she has the mind of christ she has thus saith the lord she's speaking what the holy spirit is speaking and this is really uh the final message the spirit and the bride this is the final message this is the final bidding invitation here in the the book of the bible this was just sealing off the entire bible it says if you add to not just the revel the what's in the book of revelation but if you add to or take away from the entire book of the bible so this is kind of the summation this is the climax the spirit and the bride say come and it has struck me how that it says in him let him that heareth say come and who is who is him that heareth who does he hear the spirit and the bride or the spirit in the bride saying come so the bride is saying come and now here's one who's been captured by that voice and now becomes part of the voice as well so they were there lost and they weren't where they needed to be but they hear a voice saying come and then he who's heard is now in harmony with the holy spirit likewise saying come and then it says let him that is a thirst come these are those that we call out to those who are thirsty and whosoever will as this bidding is going forth let him take the water of life freely so this is what the bride has invitation to the water of life and it's done it the invitation is coming to take of it freely so as we read this verse the spirit and the bride say come this is our end time advocacy there is there is a responsibility that we have in the end time we have a commission there's been a delegated authority to us we are still fulfilling the great commission we have a calling and here we are together in harmony with the spirit saying come and so this word these are just going to be some review points this word advocacy means public support for or publicly recommending a particular cause or recommending a particular policy there can be a policy that says we believe that we should pass a rule a law or have a policy um that states such and such and then you say i'm all for this proposition and i'm all for this ruler this law and you advocate for it and you you announce your support or you could advocate against it and it would be this public support for a particular cause or policy and so our public words what we say publicly what we post publicly what we what we write what we broadcast in whatever form you may do it in in whatever manner that you may do it but our words and our actions form our voice we have a voice we have a life that is thundering out it's announcing something it's declaring something and that's really we've been taught that's what this world needs is thousands of lived voices thundering out against the devil so this is what we do in the end time we are we are thundering out the voice of god and so it's a public ministry from us should echo out sound out the ministry of jesus christ we are living epistles not written in paper but something that was written within the bosom of the heart of the prophet is now being lived out and expressed in flesh of the believer and we looked at how that advocate the very word advocate means to add a voice um ad which is two and vocacy is vox comes from vox or voice so your ad to advocate is to add the voice of support to a cause to add a voice of support to a person or policy as we're looking at and then we also saw and i realize this is some review so maybe you're kind of waiting for me just to kind of prime it before we get started but help me you just help me do this it comes from advocare which means the very advocare means to summon or to invite so advocacy is active support and to advocate for something you're if we just looked at it in pure public policy standpoint that if there's an issue that comes up and vote vote yes for prop one or vote no for prop one right so then people say we should vote for prop one and their idea is that they're looking out at a mass of people who may have not yet formed their opinion on prop 1 and so when you publicly support prop 1 you want to get people who are on the fence or maybe people who are opposed to it you want to get them to change their mind or sway their minds to accept prop one and so you publicly you don't just stay at home and go boy i sure hope everyone votes the right way it would be nice if that's what they did in elections right put the names on the ballot just like everybody figured out in their heads and we didn't have political ads and we didn't have debates but that's not how it works there's a public support there's vocalizing and what it becomes is one standing on a particular issue and inviting someone saying hey we want you to come join us in this come and it's a summons to support something and so our advocacy is is a voice it is an invitation and one thing that i'm that is very heavy on my heart to identify is our advocacy is not our opinion it's a lot of different things that we can have an opinion on and that could be our our personality even to some extent our individuality and we have these different parts of us that some prefer this and something like that some can even take sides in a political issue or some decision or policy and and we might think that this is good or that's good but these are things that would be indifferent things that aren't pertaining to the word of god matters that do not pertain to salvation or your perfection and we can have variances on that and we have different ways of seeing it and we so we have to be careful that we identify what we ought to be advocating what our testimony ought to be those things that we express that are part of the word of god are reflective of what we believe believe in our core as christians and be able to separate them from all the other ideas and voices and things in the world today that try to polarize us and it was at a minister's meeting last year that and the the question that was presented to the ministers was you know how can you be an effective witness without crossed in the line of being ecumenical or compromising that's a very very challenging question and brother jason demars spoke um in the process and they don't record these meetings because they they want it to remain private amongst the brothers but uh pause the tape uh he made the point i think this would he wouldn't mind me sharing this because it's very very valid he said that oftentimes we're dogmatic where god allows differences and then we allow differences where god is dogmatic and that's what ought to guide us when it comes to how we we think about what we advocate for and what we're publicly supporting and what we get very very adamant about and sometimes we can be very very dogmatic on an issue but the word of god doesn't speak to it and actually allows differences and then in our hypocrisy we get just allow all sorts of differences in some areas oh it doesn't really matter it doesn't really matter but yet god is very clear and dogmatic on it and so that's a principle i think it's a very very good principle that's not just um does it not just speak to ministers but it speaks to all of us who have a public ministry we have we're not we're not in a secret society we're we are not a better rendition of the illuminati right we we are with this is something that we bel what we believe we we i we we don't mind being identified with and we wear it we broadcast it we live it and so our the challenge that i have been expressing is we ought to be careful uh what we are advocating for and even ask ourselves what what are we advocating for what is my voice lending support to what am i inviting people to join in i don't mean to say this um uh in any way of disrespect they have a saying you know you know how you can tell someone is a vegan do you know don't worry they'll tell you you don't have to worry about they're going to tell you now that's no slight on a vegan because maybe we should be a little bit more outspoken about being christians and i realize that christians have actually christians have made it really difficult on true christians to be christians but let's not let their false example and their and their bad example dim our lights don't let their testimony become the bushel that we place over our candlestick but in other words let's let's live the right way as a contrast amounts to those professing to be christians so we can we can ask ourselves what am i advocating for what am i giving voice to so my life is a voice what i say is voicing something overall if someone looked into my life is there enough evidence to convict me of being a christian there's enough evidence to convict me of if i was charged with believing certain principles in the word of god if i was charged with believing certain things about the message is there enough evidence in my life to convict me could i have enough is there enough testimony in my life to be on to reasonable doubt a jury say yeah they believe the message and challenge ourselves with that notion with that with those questions so i want to just quickly uh summarize the uh the foundation for when brother branham writes in the church age book in chapter 9 of the church age book he makes the statement about there's a people who are the final voice to the final age and so i want to just back up for a moment and summarize what his foundation was and kind of his thought process where he arrives at this declaration that there'll be a people we can say the bride is the final voice to the final age and just review it very quickly so in the in those paragraphs preceding that declaration he says that the baptists have their creeds and dogmas and says based on the word and you can't shake them so they become very dogmatic about their creeds um that are based on the word but yet he's making this distinction they are in reality pure word is some sort of interpretation based upon the word and they've come up with their own creeds and dogmas and you can't shake them from it even if the word says well that's not all there is you can't shake them from him says the methodists say based on the word so they the methodists base it on the word he goes so far as to say that the pentecostals also uh claim he says they claim the methods claim that their doctrine the christian scientist and these different ones they claim their doctrine is word based now notice kind of where the temptation is where the trap is is to hold a crete or a dogma that is not truly reflective of jesus christ but yet we justify our adherence to it our vocalization of it or advocacy for it because we believe it to be based on the word so it's based on the bible it's based on the scriptures based on the message and we get very very um adamant about it or dogmatic about it but he's saying he's identifying this is the real trap for it to be word based but not be the word he says go right down the line and come to the pentecostals do they have the word give them the word testancy and he answers this they will sell out the word for a sensation just about every time and those sensations they would say are based on the word they'll even take you to the scripture and if you sat down with the pentecostal who believed that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost they'll take you right to the book of acts and very effectively be able to show you that every time the spirit is falling there's unknown tongues being spoken and they take that and they base on their decision based on the word of god that this is the evidence of the holy ghost look at the hundreds of millions of people that would be baptized in the name of the father in the name of the son and of the holy ghost and what do they base it on they base it on the word but yet we realize it's not in harmony with the word it's not actually the word it's a dogma or creed associated with it so you can have dogmas creeds let me just say even ideas that are based on the word and maybe just to come a little bit closer to home because we might i hardly realize i don't think many of us ever when we're sitting around talking say well my dogma is is i really believe that alabama's going to win it all again this year you don't express it that way right you don't you don't express it as dogmas and say well in our house we have a creed uh those aren't terminologies that use so let's just say personal opinions personal beliefs um different ways of viewing the message and the interpretation thereof that we hold very ardently to and very passionate about and if we were given the word test maybe we're selling out for personal opinion every time maybe we're trying to make the make the message fit our paradigm or make the message fit our opinions instead of just laying our paradigm and opinions in this aside and just taking the word for what it is so it's that it's that language that he uses to build to the place where he says there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age he says yes sir i love it in his formal writing in his book he has a yes sir he's validating this there's again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the the final voice to the final age what is the very clear message that's being sent it's the people who are the final voice to the final age not even the messenger don't throw anything at me but what are they sounding out they're under their messengers so they have to be a spiritual amphitheater of the voice that they're sounding out the same thing they're harmonizing it's not the spirit and the messenger say come and the bride is over here stay at home stay at home no they're saying the same thing they're harmonizing together so he says there will be a people there is again i love how it's present tense then i believe they were there the time that this was written a people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir and then he says this drawing back to the baptist methodist pentecostals different ones the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god that is one who speaks up on the behalf of someone else so if you are a mouthpiece you don't speak of your own behalf you speak on another's behalf that's advocacy if you're not you're not you can't you're not can't necessarily advocate for yourself you have one that does that for you in the true sense of the word so he says the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god he says it is its own mouthpiece it's just trumpeting its own ideas it's just trumpeting its own opinions its own beliefs it wants to grow as bigger organizations and as a bigger church and you can become very protective of their doctrines very protective of their assembly very protective of the people why because at the end of the day they are their own mouthpiece not not speaking on behalf of the body of christ but they're their own mouthpiece and notice it says that it is a people another people in the land who under their messenger now this is a very important part of the uh very important part of this statement because there is there can be this idea that somehow we just evolve beyond the message or we we're further than what brother branham was or we've advanced beyond this and you have to be very careful because even when the we saw the trend we see the transition in the exodus that moses brought a message and brought him to the door of entering in so there was a message to bring him out of and into and you notice that when god spoke to moses he says i'm sending you to call them out of egypt but he never says he's called he's ordained him to bring them into and it's very very plain in the scripture i'm sending you to call them out he leaves this part off of moses himself leading them into but the promise is out of and in two and this is the message we brought you out to bring you into we brought you out to bring you in too and when it comes time for them to enter into the promised land moses now has to transition and he has to he's not going to go cross he knows he's not going to cross so he actually asked that god would put a man that he could set a man before the people that the people could have confidence in so that he could lead them into the promised land and we know that person was joshua and god identified himself with joshua but then you go into the book of joshua when they take over the promised land over 50 times it references as i said unto my servant moses or as you said unto moses and as they're taking possession of the promised land they're not deviating at all from the mess the messenger's message from the prophet's message they're now fulfilling it because they say as it was spoken by moses as it was prophesied by moses just like moses said here we are fulfilling the message of the hour fulfilling the commission so moses message was not surpassed when joshua took him into the promised land it was it was reaching its full vindication it was coming to its full climax or its full outcome that it was intended to produce and so in this this process and my you all are just pulling tremendously this morning and i feel that um even though i cut my notes very short last night i'll probably have to cut it even more so more so today before we go so long we have more baby dedications but in this broad in this passage here in the church age book and he's going through this they have their crease their dogmas and he says oh he's going to speak all right the church is its own mouthpiece but he's going to speak and references revelations 10 7. and it is in the days of the voice of the seventh angel so this is the this is the first voice this is the voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet so it's a very big very big scripture it's got a lot of different principles that are being brought into this and so this seventh angel this he has a voice and now john as he's walking through this in chapter 10 there's going to be the seventh angel which we identify as brother branham and he is that voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he comes to his ministry he begins to sound things out the mystery of god is finished now john then is hearing he's heard this mystery and then he's told as in verse 8. now go to him who has the book and and ask for the book then john goes to him who has the book and he says give me the book now what is this one who has the book uh what does he say take it and eat it up so there's actually a further revelation that unfolds to john when he has this audience take it and eat it up and he talks to him how that it's gonna when you take eat it's gonna be sweet in your mouth and bitter in your belly so when you take this this food and you eat it this is something that goes in your mouth and it's bitter in your belly that's a processing in something that takes place on the inside this is not observable we can look at food like wow that looks good and someone's like oh then taste it right immediately like why i mean i think we've all gone through this before where someone grabs this is my excuse to take a drink of water and they go oh that's nasty here taste this our answer every time should be no why would i do that i now know the mystery of that cup that it tastes foul but looking at it at first it might seem refreshing or appetizing but notice how this is something internalized as he takes the book and eats it but then verse 11 revelations chapter 10 verse 11 i hope that i and it included that says and he said unto me thou must prophesy again you john thou must prophesy again why is it again because in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he sounded but thou must prophesy again in this word before in front of two thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so notice how striking this is in verse 11. take the book eat it up and when you do it in your mouth it'll be sweet as honey in your belly it'll be bitter but this eating the book is very personal it's in your mouth very personal it's in your belly these are things you're experiencing that nobody else can experience the taste in your mouth is personal the bitterness in your belly is personal but it isn't ultimately just a private affair because now once the book is being processed and there's this individual experience of sweet word and the bitter after effects of it and taking of this book there's now a ministry that goes forth that thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings notice the taking of the book is very personal the eating of the book is very personal what the process that takes place in our hearts as we receive revelation of the word of god is very personal but it's through that personal communion between these cherubim in this last days that causes us to be the voice and in voicing it we do it before people tongues and kings and nations it's something that we do publicly prophesy thou must prophesy again it means speak forth by divine inspiration means to declare what is only known by revelation there's things that we know by revelation and we declare it not in the sense that we would try to explain it but we can declare the the word which has been revealed to us and leave it to god to reveal the rest so there is a speaking forth by divine inspiration to declare what is only known by revelation to prophesy also means to teach admonish to comfort others there's a teaching there's a refuting there's a reproven there's admonishment there's a comfort to others this is what is this is what this phrase prophesy means we shouldn't look at it narrowly in the sense of to predict the future and we ought not to look at it narrowly in the sense that this is something that only a prophet would do but rather those who have the mind of christ who have thus saith the lord the bride has thus saith the lord and we have been given the word of god it's been revealed to us we've taken the open book and we've eaten it now we are not saying our own words our own interpretation but we're expressing what has been revealed to us and in doing so we're declaring what has been divinely respired to us inspired us we're declaring what has been made known to us by revelation and the greek word for prophesy the greek root that it is taken from speaks of people who are filled with the holy ghost who by god's authority and his command plead the cause of god and urge the salvation of man this is what the word prophesy comes from the this word of maybe of one that would be a prophet brother brown even says in the new testament prophet means preacher and so we have those who are people who are filled with the holy ghost who by god's authority and command in words plead the cause of god and urge men to salvation plead the cause of god thou must prophesy again you must plead the cause of god and urge men to salvation do you notice even after this when the seals are being opened and at the end of the seals being preached there's still an invitation to salvation why because that it didn't it didn't change it didn't change uh the fact that souls were still being saved didn't change the fact there's still a need to come that there had to be a decision made a conviction made a confession of truth so there has to be the invitation given so if we're to prophesy again we plead god's cause we urge men to salvation now i think that kind of picks up some of the things we ministered on in part one now coming back to some of the things in part two paul says in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 1 he says be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ now kind of laid a foundation i'm taking a little bit of a change here when paul says this in chapter 11 we're going to look back again in verses chapters 9 and chapters 10 to look at what paul was referring to when he said follow me as i follow christ so the example that paul's been expressing through these ten chapters in first corinthians he is saying this is christ like the things i'm laying down to you the things i'm expressing to you and the things that i have done and the things that i say i do are reflective of the nature of christ and so paul is following in this pattern of what jesus says in john 10 27 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me why is it you follow christ because you hear his voice that's why we follow him if we didn't know his voice we'd be following another we'd be following a stranger now the trick is how slick these strangers are is they make you think they're the voice they make you think they're christ they make you think that they're advocates for the cause of christ and you're following a stranger why because he presents himself in such a way to seem to be based on the word of god oh this must be the way this must be the truth but the distinction of sheep is they hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and the beautiful part about being a sheep is if anyone's been led astray by a stranger he seeks out after you and he uses his voice to correct you and bring you back now jesus and i want to look at this very quickly jesus when he is as he declares himself to be a shepherd and we follow his voice and paul himself saying i follow christ jesus christ did not even speak his own words and if someone should have gotten away with speaking his own words it could have been christ but he did not speak his own words or do his own acts or even seek his own cause so jesus isn't out there looking out what was best for him what was best for his ministry and what would be politically correct in this instance and how could i do this to persuade the most people and he didn't justify in the sense that here i am i'm called to get people's attention and and i want people to know that i am the messiah and so he didn't calculate what way he thought was best to get everyone to believe in him he did what the father showed them now as a contrast i think it's josephus that suggests that judas believed jesus to be the messiah he absolutely was convinced that he was a messiah but he felt that jesus needed some impetus to cause him to step into his office and to deliver them from the tyranny of rome so he thought well he's the messiah all i need to do is threaten him with death threaten him with crucifixion if i just sell them out to the pharisees and sell them out to those who are seeking to stone him and i get him in trouble then he'll be forced to show his hand of this messiah now think about that in that way and i realize maybe it's a little bit different look at judas but it identifies sometimes this idea that we want to try to help the gospel we want to help things or we think where this is righteous and this is right and we want to do things a certain way but if you're not doing it in harmony with the word of god if you're not doing it in the way that god has ordained you to do it then then you need to take a step back and say well it's not so much important that i see what needs to be done i i must do it in the way that christ wants it to be done doing god doing the right thing the right way so jesus says in john 14 10 the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself that's what this is his declaration the words that i speak to you i'm not speaking of myself john 5 30 says i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not my own will but the will of the father which hath sent me it's his judgment it's his cause it's not my decision it's not my determination i'm not taking this stand because it suits my fancy i'm not doing this because it's my opinion and it's my gut instinct i'm doing this because my judgment is not my own it's the judgment of the fathers he's the one that judges so i want you to i want this to i want you to be able to personally make this relevant to your life and oh yes if i was jesus back then in the days of the messiah no you're yourself do you seek your own will he speaks not of himself i seek not my own will in john 8 50 i seek not my own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth who that's god god is the judge jesus in following in the lord's way i speak not of myself and following god's will i can do nothing of myself i seek not my own will i seek not my own glory who was whose glory was he seeking the glory of the fathers he was wanting to glorify god in heaven he was wanting to lift up his precepts his mind his principles jesus christ as the very heart of god wanted to be faithful to that cause no confusion then paul likewise as he said be followers of me as i am of christ he says in ephesians 3 1 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles paul the prisoner referred to him as a love slave paul is the prisoner of jesus christ now this is not one that is held in bondage we realize that there's this kind of a double meaning that is given as he's in chains and he would be locked up and he would be enslaved or be imprisoned that he would not claim that his bonds or his chains were those of rome but rather it was in the cause of christ that he had been imprisoned but then he reflects it in this way that i am a prisoner of jesus i'm his prisoner i am bound to him it's for the cause of christ that i that i am faith is to the cause of christ that i am faithful because i'm a prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles not even for his own good he could look at it this way that i must live this way i must suffer these things why must i suffer these things why why must i do this for the gentile sake not his own paul wasn't over there going oh my i'm really racking up the points and mileage in heaven right wasn't solely the rewards program that was motivating him but he saw that there was a reward and seen that others hear the gospel and be blessed by it and be turned to it and so paul is advocating for christ and he teaches us be followers of me he teaches us to follow the example of christ and christ spoke not of himself sought not his own will sought not his own glory i'm asking you individually now can you understand how this relates to advocating what are you giving what do you voice and support for what do you what is it you're lifting up is it the word or is it your personal opinion or is it something that you'd benefit the most from anymore i really it's really hard to trust people when they go out and say oh you you really really should invest in this stock you you should really go all in on this you think oh oh they they've they've bought some puts on this right or someone says oh this stock's gonna you know this is gonna happen that's gonna happen you know there may be there they're short on it right there's a reason there's a motive beyond you can't really trust them because they seek their own now we in first corinthians chapter 9 verses 19 to 23 and i'm this is uh hopefully we'll just kind of give us the ramp that we need to finish this is our text but i'm going to read it this time from the living bible and don't get nervous i i've fully vetted this i believe it conforms with what paul was saying but reading from the living bible hey i'd even say there's somewhere we get dogmatic right you read from your king james bible and somebody reads to you from something else like is that the king james like well no i was just reading from you know the living bible and they're like oh well sorry relax relax it's gonna be okay i mean you realize that there's people in other countries that read it in different languages and it's not necessarily king james god's looking out after the revelation of it even there's been times that i've preached and it's translated into french and i'm in i'm in psalms and i said you know psalms 21 and the guy's like i read it first i'm like psalms 21 21 now just read it first and it's like well why why do you want me to read it i'm telling you what to read he's like because our bible's different your verse doesn't match up with our verse it's different you're like okay let's let all those semantics go and all these dogmas and all these creeds we have about it let the words speak to our hearts and so i'm willing to be corrected if there's anything that's spoken in a translation or something that doesn't harmonize with what we believe to be the truth i believe that this conveys the attitude of paul follow along now he says when i am with the jews i see him as one of them so they will listen to the gospel and i can win them to christ notice his nature now he's not confrontational with him and the reason why he's not engaging them in fisticuffs and drawing the sword and you guys have done this and you guys have done that he wants to have a rapport with him in such a way that they'll be willing to listen to what he has to say when i'm with gentiles who follow jewish customs and ceremonies i don't argue even though i don't agree because i want to help them and with the heathen i agree with them as much as i can except of course that i must always do what is right as a christian this is very good uh principles do we realize that there's sometimes we can really get our gander up very quick with people oh well and we take a stand real quick and we've alienated ourselves like they're not they're not going to listen to a thing you have to say now because you've kind of you've got hopped on your hobby horse or your pet peeve and it actually is what contrary to their pet peeve and now you're perceived as an enemy and the only thing they're going to think of the rest of the time is they're trying to make me a vegan they're trying to make me a vegan they're trying to make i can't have corn fed beef anymore and you're like oh no no i'm talking about christ yeah but what's your endgame you're gonna use jesus to get me to switch to doterra you can pull this young living out of my cold dead hands right we have to be careful not to get into chems he says and so by agreeing i can win their confidence and help them too this is the ethos of paul this is his rationale this is his mindset when i'm with those whose conscience bothers them easily i don't act as though i know it all i'm going to read that again give everyone an opportunity to say amen as if they already know this i don't act as if i know it all and don't say they are foolish the result is is they're willing to let me help them i mean this is wisdom this is real wisdom and zig ziglar doesn't have it all right these guys out there who tell you how to win friends and insults people i mean this is this is gospel instruction on how to be successful in personal relationships and witnessing the message yes whatever a person is like i tried to find common ground with him so that he'll let me tell him about christ and let christ save him if he likes fish and talk to him about fishing find common bases find common ground i do this to get the gospel to them and also for the blessing i myself receive when i see them come to christ where is his blessing not and be able to say oh i passed out a bible and i witnessed to a person but his reward is when he sees that it's effective so it's not just knocking on doors it's not just sending out passing out tracks it's not just getting somebody to listen to something but it's accurately conveying faithfully conveying the word of god so that it can bless them they can receive it and then he is blessed when he sees that they come to christ and this is paul saying that he is following christ this is the example of christ in his public ministry this is paul's ministry but this isn't just paul's approach this is the approach of christ as he said follow me as he says in chapter 11 follow me as i follow christ this is the example of christ in the example that christ set in his own public ministry not serving himself but serving others therefore we do what we don't serve ourselves we serve others paul was saying that i forget my own interest i forget my own convenience i forget about my own comforts i labor i serve and i do the things that i do that the gospel might be effective to others as i mentioned wednesday night this isn't paul who is just a conflict he was a passive aggressive or you wanted to avoid conflict this wasn't conflict avoidance when paul made these decisions it wasn't because i'm not a confrontationalist and i don't like to argue and when things get tense i i i'm not really comfortable i'll actually maybe address it wednesday night paul was not afraid not afraid to make the stand in the right instance paul was not afraid to speak out things that needed to be spoken even in this very book what is he doing he's correcting the corinthians in second quincy hey i hope you don't feel like i was too hard i actually realized i wasn't too hard because you did what i asked you to do and he's actually writing a letter to try to amend things bring them back together to restore their his own relationship and their confidence in him he's very careful to be sure that he hadn't offended him why because he addressed the situation he wasn't afraid to address the situation i will say this we as believers should be very very careful not to confront a situation because there's a difference between addressing it and confronting it confrontation leads to escalation but if you address it it can lead to resolution it can resolve the issue so he uh what paul desired to see was that the gospel would be successful and what he's expressing here when i'm with the jews i see him as one of them when i'm with the gentiles who observe the law i don't argue with him i see him as one of them when i'm with those who are weak i'm weak he mentions all these different classes of people and he's saying i'm acting so that i don't alarm their prejudice i'm acting in such a way to where i don't stir up their opposition to me if i'm talking to a jew they're a jew i'm a christian so i don't want to approach them in such a way to immediately i stir up their opposition to the gospel i don't when i'm talking to a gentile who still observes the law here i'm a jew who's converted from the law and now i don't want to stir him he's actually going to and he deals with circumcision he's saying hey you know it's a circumcision of the heart and they're not necessarily in one instance this is where maybe i'm getting into a wednesday night a little bit he addressed a certain situation a certain way then addressed it another way and then when he did it he's looking at the impact and the effect of the gospel and so he's thinking i don't want to stir up stir up the opposition uh if he was going to sit down and he was going to be witness to uh to the catholic his leading is not going to be like you know he's the antichrist right because what's that going to do to a catholic oh i didn't know who's jesus what do we need to do immediately you're gonna be like they're gonna be like oh i mean the pope he's the vicar of christ we oh no no no you gotta you gotta see this she's the mother harlot man let me look at this 666 and sitting on the hill and like you're going to walk them through issues two babylons right then we're going to start off with that and and if they don't even know you excuse me again can i just get my fries all right my pleasure all right they go back and they get your fries like man they were telling me the pope is you know the antichrist and all i wanted was a you know more french fries they didn't give me my large fry at chick-fil-a and so we there's this paul was saying i'm not going to just stir up their prejudice i'm not going to act in such a way that alarms them and causes them to be on the defensive and and even makes them feel this condemnation like i think i'm better than them but in the love of christ he condescended to their prejudices in the love of christ not the love of man merely and not just the the his wanting to be accepted in every single circle he condescended to their prejudice as an advocate for christ he never leaves that out of view when he said i'm acting this way i'm acting this way they may be they may be saved to christ i did this that they might be saved to christ if you're just doing it because you want a free ex you want something free at a restaurant the wrong reason if you're doing it because you just want to fit in and you want to cover all your bases wrong reason because notice what he says in first corinthians chapter 8 verse 13 wherefore i if meat make my brother to offend if what i eat offends my brother notice how like demonstrative he is and emphatic i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend so there's maybe justification for exaggeration whenever we get real emphatic and say i don't care if you run a hundred thousand miles you know well i'm not gonna be able to run a hundred thousand miles but paul was saying the same thing i'll eat no flesh by the world standing being very very exaggerated exaggerated in a sense to make the point if it me defends my brother i won't eat meat that was easy wasn't it i will i don't want to offend my brother now there's much more emphasis in that than just meat it has something to do with things offered to idols but he's he's declaring something here if there's a sensitivity that's going to cause a stumbling block look this is this is something that's not going to if you eat if you eat this if i eat meat i mean all i got you mean all i got to do is abstain from eating meat to not offend my brother and he's saying all right then i can do that but if you ask me to begin to preach something different and to say something different compromising the word that's where he'd say no sorry i can't do it he addresses it this way in romans chapter 15 verses 1 to 3 when we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves one of the initial series that we started a year ago in september when this church began having regular services was who is my neighbor we recognized just how deep this principle was to love our neighbor as ourselves and how much that would guide our conduct so he's saying those that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves and it's not so much when someone is sick you want to bring them chicken soup but rather if someone has a weakness in their mind and some sort of hardship or something that's very difficult for them that we ought to help them in it and not just act to please ourselves to become to feel more righteous and to feel that we're better than somebody else and make them to feel foolish he's saying we ought to be sensitive and those of us of us who are strong bear the infirmities of the weak not to please ourselves let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification for even christ please not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach they fell on me this is very good this is very good teaching he's saying that let us not please ourselves but let us please our neighbor for his good edification there's kind of the boundary says well my neighbor told me to get high with him i didn't want to make him angry no he said to please your his neighbor for his good edification you realize that means sometimes we can say no because it's for their good edification when family member asks us to do something our neighbor asks us to do something we're feeling pressured to do something like oh maybe i should just please him no do you realize that your abstinence or your stand in the right nature and right character christ in that instance is for his good edification you're declaring something no we don't believe in this and no that's not what we do and that's against my conviction and so do you realize why it's very important to not be dramatic dogmatic where god allows differences but to be dogmatic where god doesn't allow differences for even christ please not himself be followers of me as i am of christ so we looked at chapter nine we read it from the living bible now i will read from the king james in chapter 10 verses 27 to 33 if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and you be disposed to go if you want to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake this is what we try to teach our children eat what you're served we try to do this at home eat what you're served why because we don't want to go to someone's house be invited over for dinner and then something is served and our kids like uh what is this and now everyone's embarrassed and it's like oh um it's chicken liver and it's this oh i don't eat that we don't eat that i don't like this i don't like that you want to teach them eat with their eat what they're served in some ways maybe paul is espousing the same virtue he says that if you're bid to feast and you go sit down to someone who's not a believer so in this instance what's the worry well is this meat been sacrificed to idols should i eat this meat or not was it you know how was it bled out what kind of meat is it he's saying whatever you're served just eat he says don't ask can you imagine that don't ask what's in this now i understand brother mike you might want to find out whether or not there's peanuts in it because he has a nut allergy but in this instance and that's life or death right it wouldn't be too as good out of edification to scarf down peanut sauce uh to not offend the magiris but this is a situation where hey it's it's it's meat that may have been sacrificed to idols and instead of being invited over to dinner and saying oh we're having beef well was it sacrificed to idols what market did you get it from oh i only get my meat from sprouts hey you don't ask so just eat what's set before you he says but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that showed it and for conscience sake now what he's saying is here's one who has a um has his conviction that if something's been offered to idols in his mind he may still think that this idol had this influence over this meat so he's real suspicious of this meat oh it's been sacrificed to idols and maybe he still doesn't understand that there's no life in those idols there's no power in those idols that there's powers in in christ there's power in the name of jesus and that even in blessing things and sanctifying it he could partake in this meat but now you knowing better instead of saying ah you i can't believe you're so sensitive you just grab the tomahawk ribeye and start eating it you go oh oh this was sacrificed to idols okay and you refrain from eating for his conscience sake right no you because you could take the liberty and it doesn't bother you so it may not bother you or it may bother you but it doesn't bother me paul is saying hey just take a chill pill just relax don't get all self-righteous don't try to make this the hill you're going to die on take a step back and say oh well maybe we shouldn't eat here you're going to ask somebody to go out to dinner and say hey you want to go eat where do you want to go well we're thinking of going to applebee's like ah you know what i don't really feel like going there they got a lot of tvs and they always play rock and roll music like oh what are you huh apply the token to applebee's now and we start getting all upset with somebody and trash talking oh does it bother you do you have a problem with the television and and all of a sudden we start running somebody down because they would much rather go to ihop because there's no music being played it's like hey if that offends you if you're sensitive that don't die on that mountain don't pick the fight he says not for for conscience sake for the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof what has he just said really at the end of the day there's nothing wrong with that mead they say conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judge of another man's conscience this is kind of what he i think he's asking the question on you know that maybe even someone else might say but he's also saying why would i let another man's conscience judge my uh moderate my liberty for if i buy grace be a partaker why am i evil spoke enough for that which i give thanks so much if i eat something and i'm spoken evil of i've prayed over it i've asked gave him thanks it's blessed i should be able to eat it but now someone who's offended may say something he says whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do do all to the glory of god so what are we keeping in view what are we thinking how does this promote the gospel how does this edify the body of christ how are my decisions how are my posts how are my attitudes how are my bumper stickers how are the things that i'm espousing and advocating for how does this glorify god he says give none offense neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god give no offense in these indifferent things give no offense in these personal things give no offense in these these things that you hold as your own personal conviction he says even as i please all men in all things not seeking my own prophet but the profit of many that they may be saved paul why would you let another man judge your liberty you prayed over it you should be able to eat whatever you want he says the reason why i don't do it the reason why i would abstain is that in abstaining i am more effective as a witness of what really matters i'm more effective as a witness of the things that really really count that if i'm a stickler about everything and i'm picking on everything and when it comes time to witness to my co-worker about baptism in the name of jesus christ they kind of just look and say well you're just a legalist anyways you've been split hair since the time you showed up here and then you try to talk about something that's really weighty something that really matters and it's kind of like well you your voice means nothing to me anymore they'll even question the very source of it is anybody else freezing cold this morning it means freezing cold can we turn the heat on but scott and brother john can you help with uh this one over here i don't stop preaching till i sweat and i'm up here dry as a bone i don't know if that was by choice i usually preach till i run out of water or until i start sweating that was a joke i don't have either of those as a some sort of guy you never you know sometimes my kids you say something in jess and they remind you years later that well you said you did this i was like did i don't know if they know this but i have i've traveled around the sun 45 46 times did you know that i've traveled around the sun's 46 times like wow he did that and he can't even get the garage clean now notice this in the living bible if someone who isn't a christian ask you to go out to dinner go ahead accept the invitation if you want to eat whatever's on the table and don't ask any questions about it unless you have an allergy then you won't know whether or not it's been used as a sacrifice to idols and you won't risk having a bad conscience overeating it but if someone warned you and what does and what who whose conscience are you afraid of offended in this situation the unbeliever you sit down to eat with because wouldn't you want your life to witness to him and if you immediately alienate them and make them feel guilty about eating meat because of your staunch position on something that paul is saying it's indifferent the word is indifferent about this then you become less effective i know i'm really belaboring this point but i want you i want the holy spirit to be able to amplify this in your own hearts make it applicable in your own life i don't know everyone's situations i can maybe guess as to some i know our own and there may be things that i could think of in our family that we could be less dogmatic about and less legalistic about for the sake of of not offending so we can be effective witnesses and so that we can help and instead of harm there's a way that we all might be challenged on different levels but i'm wanting just the word to be spoken over you and let that wash your spirits and align you correctly and so he says then you won't know whether or not it's been used as a sacrifice to idols and you won't risk having a bad conscience over eating it but if someone warns you that this meat's been offered to idols then don't eat it for the sake of the man who told you and of his conscience in this case his feeling about it is the important thing not yours not beautiful but why you may ask must i be guided and limited by what someone else thinks this really starts hitting home well why should it matter what somebody else thinks if i can thank god for the food and enjoy it why let someone spoil everything just because he thinks i'm wrong well i'll tell you why it is because you must do everything for the glory of god even your eating and drinking powerful is put that way isn't it you should do everything for the glory of god you should give thought to the things you voice support for and advocate for in everything even your eating and drinking so don't be a stumbling block to anyone whether they're jews or gentiles or christians don't be a stumbling block to anyone don't offend don't we know what jesus said about what happens if you offend he says that is the plan i follow too i try to please everyone in everything i do not doing what i like or what is best for me but what is best for them so that they may be saved why do you do it because of christ why do you do it that christ might be effective why did that i might be an effective witness this is why we even jesus said i sanctify myself for your sakes jesus didn't need to sanctify himself for his own sake but there was sanctification that he brought it made himself subject to for the sake of others and we likewise should have the same mindset that just because we might have liberties and we might have our rights and these are our rights and listen do you realize that's the trap allele to see it your rights this is my right i've got a right to do this this is my god-given right and we want to exercise our god-given rights and paul is saying well maybe you should do all things to the glory of god maybe that's what should guide you that's what should motivate you if you read in paul's gospels it's amazing he had power of making himself at home with all sorts of classes of people all races all degrees of men he can make himself at home he never alienated another class of people the poor were at home with him christ even was able to do it he was at home with the sinners and the publicans but yet could be invited into another man's home who is a of high degree and paul had the ability to not offend over many different degrees of men and while keeping the word it's important to understand that paul never transgressed the word he says this i do i do is one who is under the law but yet but yet not forsaking the cause of christ and i'm as one without the law but still under the law of christ while faithfully keeping the word of god he adapted himself to all men and why did he how why did he adapt why did he accommodate in the hope of gaining them i'll adapt in this situation to see that it's effect that might what i believe in could be effective for this person i will i will accommodate so in the hopes of saving them and so all his discipline all his self-denial even with christ and paul i want you to understand this he did it with one single objection objective in mind don't forget this the promotion of the gospel because immediately we could start thinking oh cool i can start doing this so i don't offend my neighbor and oh cool i could do this so i don't offend my family and oh we can dabble in this and we can mix in that and brother aaron's saying that we can kind of get be a little less sanctified so that we don't offend anyone that's clearly not what's being said he recognized that he could accommodate certain things and not be in their face and not be abrasive and not stir up their prejudices and not stir up their opposition to him for the promotion of the gospel so we likewise can moderate our behavior and moderate the things we say and moderate the voice things we lend our voice to so it's the sake of not alienating anyone but as long as we're not just trying to hide our christianity but that our christianity can be the most effective let me let me say this i i believe that we ought not to be afraid to call ourselves christians i believe that we ought to say that we we are we are christians that this is christianity and and though it may be a term that has been borrowed i believe that you are true christians and we identify as christians and we don't need to give ourselves any other nomination to identify who we are we are christians we are bearers of the life of christ we are manifest in the nature and character of christ therefore i have a responsibility to follow what i'm saying here not to make the message look good and not to make the messenger look good but to represent christ fairly because this message is christ and i say this then as advocates for christ should not we regulate our own conduct in light of the same purpose should this not be some sort of guiding principle and i don't mean that we'd have these lists of rules and regulations that whenever we would find ourselves walking into a situation like okay what can i do in this situation what can i do in this situation we look like a quarterback who's getting the call in from the sidelines we're having to look on the cheat sheet to figure out what play we're calling it's not this real uptight real tense thing we're doing we're just saying lord i want to be like you i want to follow your nature i want to do things the right way i want to i want to be an effective witness don't you want to see someone else saved this church has been holding regular services for one year we've seen the lord touch lives we've seen people who were backslid we've seen people who had rejected things of god we've seen the lord restore people i i desire to see people be impacted by this message not just carve art out carve out our little niche and do these little top secret missions into these other places and steal people out of other people's assemblies and hope that other churches fail that so we can benefit by it let's go out and save the lost count those that have been born here let's have this desire to regulate our conduct for the promotion of the gospel just as paul didn't do it we should not insist on our rights and privileges that hinder the cause of christ you may have certain rights you may have certain privileges but we ought not to insist on them if they'll somehow hinder the cause of christ and it's true as it says in the scripture we could look at it in first corinthians chapter 10 verses 23 and 24 the abuse of your liberty in christ leads to destruction not edification your abuse of it oh i'm free i can do this but you can abuse your liberty and it'll result in destruction but our our goal our objective is edification of the body of christ through salvation and sanctification that's what we want to do we want to edify the body of christ through salvation that there would be those added to it and then edify the body through our own sanctification through our serving of it and that's our objective so paul notice this is in the context first corinthians chapter 9 we read how that he became all things to all men first corinthians chapter 10 he said that he pleases all men in all things what for the promotion of the gospel that they may be saved the gospel may be benefited it's in the middle of this that he makes this statement all things are lawful to me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not it's not even a question of his own edification it's not even a question alone of his own expediency but it's the edification of others and the expediency to which the gospel's being conveyed to their hearts he's saying yeah i've got a lot of rights i got a lot of privileges i got a lot of things i should i can do like i should be able to sit down and eat meat that i've asked god to bless and not let another man's weak conscience keep me from eating what i want and paul said that's completely within my right he says so why do you do it paulie goes will i do it that that person could be saved or their conscience not aggrieved because in this instance it's their conscience that means more than mine so he says let not let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth it's interesting isn't it welfare it's welfare let no man seek his own welfare alone but every in another man another man's welfare so paul is actually saying that he's really not coming to any conclusion about whether you should eat or eat certain foods or drink certain drinks he's not bringing a conclusion he's not drilling this down to say so therefore these are meats that are allowed these are meats that aren't he's kind of leaving that question alone in saying that we ought to be guided by our by what promotes the gospel in every situation be conscious of how can i be a most effective witness of what i believe and this is paul's cons prescription as it concerns our conduct's effect on others he's saying all things are lawful for us all things are lawful but not everything is expedient and not everything edifies so don't insist on your rights don't insist on your privileges if they don't edify the body of christ don't insist on exercising your rights if it brings an affront or an approach to a believer so he said in the matter of indifferent things don't seek to just satisfy your own desire don't seek to just satisfy your own passion don't seek to build your own consensus and advocate for yourself and things that are indifferent and things that the word doesn't speak to we have to moderate our conduct for the con for for the consciences of other people and for the sake of the gospel so he said our conduct takes into consideration the profit of others the welfare of others the edification of others look at philippians chapter 2. our advocacy for christ compels us compels us to be concerned about the welfare of others it's our advocacy for christ that restrains us from hurting other people we've said it before we've heard bride doesn't persecute bride why because bro it's not because bride knows everyone who's bride but because she doesn't persecute anybody she never persecutes bride so it's not that we can sit around and be like right not right right not bright not bright right not bright and we have a list that people we can persecute i'm so glad i'm so glad they fell away because now i can openly persecute them because clearly they're not bright no we don't persecute anyone it's not the spirit of christ it's not the nature of christ so we our advocacy compels us to not hurt others we're to consider how our how we are to act we think about how we're acting we think about what we live for what we support what we give our money to what we give our time to what we become characterized as with them leaving the holy spirit to deal with you in your own life and not become legalistic and put down a bunch of rules on how we ought to live and how we ought to act but we ought to consider how that we act so that we can help others not hinder them paul and i realize i want to read philippians 2 20 but i'm drawn back to what he says and all things are lawful for me but all things edify not it's easy to run into evil by accident when you pursue your rights you ponder that for a moment very easy to run into evil by accident when we pursue all rights and privileges that aren't plainly sinful right i'm gonna let you think about for a moment you could cue the jeopardy upon to this when we exercise all rights and all privileges in things that aren't plainly sinful that's when we can easily run into evil by accident was it say evil things have ruined thousands unlawful things ruined thousands lawfully things unlawfully used ten thousands where's the where's the real rub and the real the the area where god's starting to tighten up some of our lives it's not in the big things god's brought that hammer has chopped away so many things so here we sit today as born-again believers and loving the word of god and very faithful we've suffered such agitation of the last 15 years to where we know where we stand and we're real centered on truth and here we are and now these are things where the refiner is coming and he's very delicately chiseling things away from us and refining us because there's things that we hold to very personal these are my rights these are my privileges but yet if you pursue all rights and privileges and things that aren't obvious or plainfully sinful or things that seem to be indifferent we can accidentally run into evil and god is saying show up your lives buckle up a little bit you need to be more sincere we're going to go this way if we're going to take this find this last seed if we're going to go on a rapture we must be more sincere we must become more dedicated then a lot of times it's these areas where we feel we're a little bit loose in that we feel we have the liberty in that's causing us the problem he says for i have no man like mine in philippians 2 20 and 21 who will naturally care for your state as he was sending i believe his titus i have no man like mine who will naturally care for your state for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christ that's not how we should live paul saying i'm sending someone to you who will look out after you i'm sending someone to you who is who's like-minded if i recall in particular that there wasn't just like anybody could help and anybody will do this because he didn't trust everybody i i took out some scriptures in first timothy and i'll read them wednesday night lord willing as paul is instructing timothy he was very deliberate in the way that he talked about certain things because he realized you know what there's some people that preach the gospel for their own benefit and he's actually saying you know what there's some people who are and i took this scripture out as well who are encouraged by the fact that i've been thrown into prison and are preaching the gospel the god the suppose in the gospel that paul is preaching he's saying there's people that preach these ways these people that preach these certain things and paul is saying there's not many who are like-minded who will preach the gospel unselfishly and desire to see that a son and or daughter know christ in a personal way and are led of his spirit and fulfill his will for their lives too many people are selfish and want to build consensus for their ideas want to build uh support for their policies and want to feel that they're a part of something and that their ministry or their ideals or their opinions or their beliefs or their church is thriving and successful and paul said there's so many people that seek their own and not the things which are jesus christ and what we ought to have in our hearts and what we should have at the core of our what our compass our moral compass and our ethics and what guides us is that we desire that men and women come to know that they are sons and daughters of god and that a real relationship with christ be established with god and that they find their value in him where they can be led of god and this word can be effective and the message can open up their lives and they can blossom why because we're advocates for jesus christ we do not seek our own but we seek those things which are christ we are advocates for let him close with this scripture john 10 27 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me i said wednesday night we are only sheep to christ ponder i've been pondering the subject that will prime minister on here soon of blind trust we are only sheep to christ jesus christ is our i like to find maybe a good word to use for it because jesus christ is our hero jesus christ is our role model jesus christ is our example he's the one that we're pattern our behavior after that it's that example that we look to it's that example that paul followed in so jesus christ sets the standard he sets this example paul is amplifying it so beautifully because now we look back and we see that jesus said follow me as i followed christ or jesus saying be therefore followers of me i'm quoting paul each time because that's what paul amplified jesus saying my sheep know my voice and they follow me be follow me follow me now paul is following christ and he's expressing these things philippians timothy corinthians all over he's expressing these things and what is he identifying the nature and character of christ whom he followed and he said i follow christ follow me as i follow christ and he was so faithful to the example of christ that he could say be there for followers of me as i am of god so he knew that he was being faithful in that duty to follow and that what he was preaching and what he was teaching was lifting up these principles and these aspects of christ this is what we here in the world today what would jesus do they don't even ask that question anymore you know what they want to know what would john wayne do it's true john wayne is more of a hero to message believers than jesus christ and i believe that as a reason why god preserved the the many different tapes he had because we have the example of christ paul followed that example and then one who preached the same gospel paul preached so once again you could see someone who lived the example of jesus christ and it doesn't have to fit this rugged man model or the right-wing conservative christian that everyone wants to idolize and become their hero we've had an example we've got a scripture to teach us we've got a word to teach us and guide us and jesus christ alone is the example by which we want to live paul was following christ's example and his meekness and concern for others paul was following the example of christ in his advocacy that men be saved invite the musicians to come i like this guy three that will come this time i'd like to invite you to come and and share this as maybe you're trying to just sum this up in my heart as i've walked through these things with you today the full gospel must be expressed in the character of christ in other words we don't want to just you can just say the word all you want or quote things or you know broadcast certain things but the full gospel it has to be expressed in christ's character you you want it to be conveyed you want to be a vessel is your life worthy of the gospel that was the question is your life reflective of it is it is it can you just act however you want and then at the end of the day justify it because you're a believer and like well i believe the truth don't i give me the word test give me the word test go ahead give it to me whatever brother bram said i believe in and it's like whoa i mean that's that's part we believe in the word for your day receiving your word for the day i i'm the kind of person i would never belittle that but that's not a get out of jail free card or that's not you can live however you want to say whatever you want do whatever you want act everyone be mean be rude be crass live unsanctified be disrespectful talk other people down persecute lie cheat still oh but believe every word right the gospel of christ has to be expressed in christ's character it has to be harmonized with the manner of life these things should not just be summed up in beliefs and opinions like this is what we believe this is my opinion but if you really believe something will you act on it if you really really believe that if you're really really concerned about something if you really if you're afraid let me just maybe just get real here because it's not i could even i realized as i was studying this last week it's like someone's going to ask me are you talking about masks brother aaron you talking about vaccines no but it's applicable if you're really concerned about people being led astray if you're really con concerned about people being deceived if you're really confused about people being harmed and being lined up into concentration camps and being subject to torture and people gonna be this is gonna happen too that's gonna be happening and you're going to liken what's happening today to something that happened in world war ii in nazi germany if you're worried about that what about those who are left behind for the tribulation do you care about them [Music] would you have a heart for them he said well man if i'm real i'm worried about our children suffocating at school maybe i should be worried about my my friends and my family who don't know this blessed gospel and truth because there's a greater tribulation coming and i'm not belittling anyone's personal stand on these things but think about what gets our righteous indignation up but meanwhile we can just kind of walk through laodicea of going look at all these people who are doomed for hell look at all this serpenty look at all these people who haven't heard the truth who rejected the message and act so calloused and act so like it doesn't even matter i trust you feel my heart this morning [Music] that we could we need to be more concerned about the cause of christ take our eyes away from the politics take our eyes away from all the pretense take our eyes away from all the things that are trying to distract us let people have their personal opinions and their personal convictions in things that are indifferent and don't don't berate them if they want to get vaccinated don't be random if they don't get vaccinated don't berate them if they wear a mask or if they don't wear a mask those are all distractions those are the indifferent things that are trying to dominate our minds and our conversations and who we are get our eyes back on christ why why why should we do that for aaron because there's something worse coming than a pandemic something worse awaiting those who don't receive this truth notice what brother graham says in the unveiling of god so much of this sermon in the unveiling of god he's talking about the mercy seat and god being hid behind badger skins and hid behind skins notice what he says in the unveiling of god he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal himself to others oh my goodness he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to the traditions and things to reveal him to others died to the denominations to reveal him to others it sounds like paul does it sound like paul what he said in first corinthians 9 and first corinthians 10 that i died to traditions i died to these things i died to myself i i keep under my body i bring it into subjection that there might be others be saved and he says be ye followers of me as i am of christ brother bottom echoes out the same sentiments he died to reveal himself to us let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to traditions and things to reveal him to others die to denominations how could we sum that up all our personal opinions that are based on the word but aren't in fact the word died in different things die to things that don't matter die to things that become these really personal pet peeves and get on your soapbox tie to them so you can do what reveal christ to others let's stand [Music] that quote this this statement i want to become something that guides me [Music] let me ask does it resonate with you this statement this closing statement [Music] he died to reveal himself to us let's die to self let's die to traditions and things let's die to denominations why to reveal him to others why would you do that why would you do that to reveal him to others with our heads bowed today [Music] i'm going to invite you to lift your hands in surrender and say lord i died to self i die to traditions i die to things i deny to personal opinions based on the word that aren't the word that are hindering the expression of the gospel let me just qualify as a caveat there's things that we base on the word that promote the gospel things that we say and do that we might adequately convey and express the gospel i'm speaking of those things that cloud the issue [Music] these heads hands raised and head spout [Music] i know there's mind battles [Music] and in these mind battles there's things that try to pull us into a certain way of viewing things [Music] but where i want your mind and your thoughts to wander to today is not man not opinion not church not ideas but to him who spoke to you and to begin with the one who's called to you the one who's touched your heart the one that you can be absolutely sure of that's god you can be sure of christ today and let them speak to your heart and guide you back to sinner and come to this compass my sheep hear my voice and they follow me they say lord i want to follow you all the way and die to self and died of traditions and died of things a gracious heavenly father i have a very succinct prayer lord help us to be the revelation of jesus christ help us to be lord that voice to this last age help us to be faithful to your cause lord may we not be sidetracked by all these other causes so moved by other voices to where we're taking up arms to fight a political battle and we seem to have found maybe a scriptural justification for it but could it be that your voice is calling us back off that front line to the real front line calling us back away from the politics lord we're not led by the quote-unquote moral majority we're not led by the political right lord our enemy is not the political left lord we must stand for truth we stand for righteousness we stand for christ in this hour and we merely do not want to just be parroting the message and saying that we believe it and giving lip service to it but not holding it in the character of it so father may we receive it in the way that it was given may we live it in the way that it was lived and i pray father that you help us strengthen us encourage us and lord today as it's been chilly a little bit cold here in this room i realize it could even add to the tenseness lord if it's if there anything in my set in my speech seem to be agitated are even politically motivated lord i bear the consequence myself and i pray that your words and your voice would be what would resonate but i i don't want it to be a my show i don't want it to be my opinion i don't want it to be my perception of things lord it's you know how you do with my heart you know how you speak to me lord i know you have spoken to me let us embrace the mantle as christ advocates lord may we embrace a washing today of the water of the word may it wash us re-centrist put us on the front line for the gospel and help us lord to say and do right things the right way bless your people i pray today help us strengthen us lord as i say encourage us may we overcome the battles that we are facing lord i look out upon the congregation dozens dozens missing today sick at home traveling situations that have burdened some and just blocked them away from the house of god lord i pray that they would be loosed i pray for the sick families today raise them up and make them well very unique sicknesses lord and people feeling that they have coveted getting tested completely free but lord just sickness after sickness lord it bombarding the believers not just in this church but other churches in the valley in arizona around the world lord we see the enemies sneaking in and causing discomfort lord and pain in many different ways for those traveling taking advantage of the holiday we can bless them lord sure father we would love for them to be here but above all lord we want them to find peace with you we want them to be led by you so strengthen them encourage them lord for the evans family brother daniel evans family his cousin who passed away this past week bless bless brother ronald evans family lord those he leaves behind bless the believers in his church and those saints father we've seen two too many good believers and sons and daughters of god be afflicted with disease and past but lord we've been taught that there's nothing worse than sin disease may the grief and the anguish that we feel over the passing of those that we love motivates to motivate us to become more vocal of the healer christ you can become more vocal of the savior christ because there's a worse pandemic coming one such as has never been seen before on this earth when tribulation sets in so i pray father that you help us to rescue those from this plague of unbelief and use us for your glory and let us die to self that we might reveal you to others jesus name we pray
