[0:00] chapter 1 verses 1 to 4. God who at
[0:03] sundry times and in diverse manners
[0:05] spake in time past unto the fathers by
[0:08] the prophet so it's kind of a way of
[0:10] describing God who in times past in
[0:12] different ways
[0:13] spake to Israel through prophets and
[0:17] brother Ram takes this scripture and
[0:19] says it's not by but even in
[0:21] it says hath in these last days spoken
[0:23] on us by his son whom he hath appointed
[0:26] heir of All Things by whom also he made
[0:29] the worlds
[0:30] could be in the brightness of his glory
[0:32] and the express image of his person and
[0:35] that's what I'm wanting to concentrate
[0:36] on today the express image of his person
[0:39] and upholding All Things by the word of
[0:41] his power when he had by himself purged
[0:43] our sins sat down on the right hand of
[0:46] the Majesty on high what an introduction
[0:49] and may God bless you you can be seated
[0:53] as you can see we're continuing on the
[0:55] subject of the Kingdom I do hope those
[0:58] phrases Heaven's mystery and Earth's
[1:00] Glory are still resonating with you and
[1:03] have some
[1:04] a significance in placing as we look at
[1:07] this there's a lot of things we've been
[1:08] studying to minister on that we just
[1:11] haven't quite gotten to and in that uh I
[1:14] don't think I owe anyone apology for
[1:16] that but if it seems that we're not
[1:18] zeroing in on some of these elements I
[1:20] believe that the touch points are there
[1:22] and the connections are there I wanted
[1:24] to say this morning happy anniversary
[1:26] and you might not uh somebody may have
[1:28] an anniversary today and I don't realize
[1:30] it I just nailed it and you're thinking
[1:31] thank you brother and for remembering
[1:32] but it was three years ago today that
[1:34] our family arrived in Phoenix moving
[1:36] here permanently and it was the first
[1:38] Sunday of September 2020 that we held
[1:41] our first service permanently and since
[1:42] then we've never stopped and I really
[1:45] appreciate the grace of God and I say
[1:46] happy anniversary to the church and to
[1:48] you those of you who are part of this
[1:49] it's just been a real blessing I could
[1:52] say even in being on vacation uh that
[1:55] there's a there's a moment in the
[1:57] vacation where there's a Tipping Point
[1:58] where you know it's going to come to an
[1:59] end and you start to get anxious and you
[2:01] start to dread coming home and I could
[2:04] testify that I didn't have that Tipping
[2:06] Point and it's refreshing I was so
[2:08] excited to come back to Phoenix to be
[2:09] back in the service to the Lord to be
[2:11] with the people of God and it's
[2:13] wonderful to be on vacation and look
[2:14] forward to that and to look forward to
[2:17] coming home and that was our experience
[2:18] and I recognize that's a compliment to
[2:20] you and all glory and praise goes to the
[2:22] Lord and it was September 6th I believe
[2:25] on a Sunday that we held our first
[2:27] service so why don't we have service
[2:28] Wednesday night and have an anniversary
[2:29] service on Wednesday night you're all
[2:31] welcome back for that service
[2:35] I also wanted to express just how much I
[2:37] enjoyed the ministering of the word uh
[2:40] while we are away and I find myself
[2:42] thinking you know maybe next time I need
[2:45] to fake go on vacation and stick around
[2:46] to hear all the services because from
[2:48] Brother Manuel all the way to brother
[2:49] Chris they were just amazing just
[2:52] awesome services for me personally I
[2:54] just benefited so much from it I
[2:57] regretted that my family couldn't have
[2:58] been here for all the Coke and soda pop
[3:01] and all the calories that were consumed
[3:03] in the high fructose corn syrup on
[3:04] Wednesday night but just all the subject
[3:07] matter the local brothers who ministered
[3:09] brother Manuel brother Reggie brother
[3:12] Chris just fantastic brother elieza did
[3:14] a tremendous job I really enjoyed that
[3:17] and for me personally I just want to
[3:18] testify especially even as a pastor
[3:20] there's a lot of things you pray about
[3:22] and you you're just wrestling out and
[3:24] you feel in Your Heart Lord should I
[3:26] address something and should I say
[3:27] something and how should I approach this
[3:30] subject and it was just wonderful to sit
[3:32] back and watch the Lord use the men of
[3:35] God to take things that are pertinent
[3:37] that are necessary that are relevant and
[3:39] just put it bring it forth in such a way
[3:41] that if you were listening and you
[3:42] wanted to hear from God I believe you
[3:44] did and I believe that there was things
[3:46] shared that were a great blessing and
[3:47] benefit to you and I've heard great
[3:48] feedback from the few that have reached
[3:50] out and gave feedback and I just wanted
[3:52] to compliment you all as a church and
[3:54] everyone the minister in the world was
[3:55] just fantastic while we were gone and so
[3:57] I'm nervous this morning that I'll be
[3:59] like this buzz kill
[4:00] and step into this wonderful atmosphere
[4:02] and the trajectory of the word and ruin
[4:04] it so I've been really nervous over the
[4:06] last 24 hours in preparation my title uh
[4:10] kind of the subtitle today is character
[4:12] expression I think let's spend maybe a
[4:14] couple services on this aspect building
[4:16] uh these terms of character and
[4:19] expression a little bit we are starting
[4:22] to zero in more on the order of the
[4:25] kingdom and how that heaven is to be
[4:27] expressed in flesh is to be expressed on
[4:29] Earth we see this image of it in the
[4:32] eternity in Revelations 21 we see these
[4:35] expressions in Eternal things but there
[4:38] is a character of the Kingdom that's to
[4:40] be expressed noun you'll find that
[4:42] brother Brandon when he talks about the
[4:43] kingdom he often says that we're
[4:45] Children of the Kingdom act like it so
[4:47] there's a certain character that comes
[4:48] with it and God's kingdom is a has a
[4:52] domain so it has an order it has
[4:53] structure there's things that relate to
[4:55] it and above everything if I could put
[4:58] it this way it really is because I'm
[5:00] wanting it to be present tense right now
[5:01] where we're living today and
[5:03] an issue of manifesting the life
[5:07] and and not that we would see something
[5:10] and say oh that's what it looks like uh
[5:12] let me mimic it but rather have it so
[5:15] that it's doing its thing uh through us
[5:18] because there's this there's a
[5:20] difference between demonstrating
[5:21] something and impersonating something uh
[5:24] there's some there's those who can
[5:26] impersonate and they can do uh vocal
[5:28] impersonations they can impersonate
[5:30] someone's Voice or someone's mannerisms
[5:32] and like oh man that's just like so and
[5:34] so that that sounds just like them or
[5:36] you're acting just like them and and it
[5:39] can be a semblance of it but that's just
[5:41] an impersonation that's zeroing in on
[5:43] certain outward manifestations or
[5:45] characteristics and kind of catching a
[5:48] hold of those and then mimicking them
[5:50] and then there's a there's a way when
[5:51] you say well that was the impersonation
[5:53] but the person whom you're imitating
[5:55] they don't impersonate themselves they
[5:57] demonstrate themselves they demonstrate
[6:00] who they are and that's the thought and
[6:02] character expression and
[6:05] I was uh and while we were away studying
[6:09] and praying about different things and
[6:11] it was just remarkable how the Lord led
[6:13] me in a particular direction and I've
[6:15] been pondering how what does the Kingdom
[6:17] look like in the world today
[6:19] and a brother sent me an article from a
[6:22] publication and it was about a movement
[6:24] that's taking place in the world today
[6:25] the religious world today and the more I
[6:27] read it the more I thought you know this
[6:29] is this is amazing uh what they're
[6:32] thinking and what they're expressing
[6:33] what they're manifesting and they have a
[6:35] language that sounds scriptural but a
[6:37] representation that is Antichrist and it
[6:41] relates to things that we would believe
[6:42] in and we would love and and languages
[6:44] that we'd be using from the scripture
[6:45] and even things that we could even take
[6:47] from the message but it's not the
[6:50] expression of what the Kingdom looks
[6:52] like today and we could ask the question
[6:54] what does it look like today how is it
[6:57] being expressed and we've read from
[6:58] different places where brother Brown
[7:00] says the kingdom is the word of God made
[7:02] spirit and life in our own life so the
[7:04] question could be what does that look
[7:06] like what does the what does it look
[7:08] like to bring the promise of today past
[7:10] to pass in our lives even go so far as
[7:14] to say what is the purpose and the goal
[7:15] this article that was sent to me this
[7:18] woman was felt that it was her mission
[7:20] in life to buy property to be used for
[7:24] this Kingdom movement in order to
[7:25] overthrow governments and put Christian
[7:27] senators in office and get the Christian
[7:29] governors in office and and realize it's
[7:31] just a wrong expression of the kingdom
[7:34] of God
[7:36] now I I feel uh Brother David Cleveland
[7:39] use a perfect word in the office with me
[7:41] before service I felt very vulnerable
[7:43] today because I have everything in front
[7:46] of me but I just don't feel I just feel
[7:48] that I've got to just follow the
[7:49] leadership of the Lord wherever he may
[7:50] take me today so if there was something
[7:53] you were wanting me to do for three
[7:55] years now is your chance
[7:59] good thing we don't have pews for me to
[8:00] run
[8:01] if you look in your Bibles Hebrews
[8:03] chapter 1
[8:04] and we'll read verses one to four
[8:07] and what if what you were wanting me to
[8:09] do is to not have a PowerPoint we're
[8:11] going to be over in like three slides
[8:13] and so we even got that for you Hebrews
[8:15] chapter 1 verse one if we could look at
[8:17] this and I want you to think about
[8:20] expression that's what we're focusing on
[8:23] today is expression it says God now it's
[8:26] going to
[8:27] pick up in verse 2 God hath in these
[8:30] last days but now this phrase who's
[8:32] going to describe something God
[8:35] who we know is the word it says who at
[8:37] sundry times in a diverse manner spake
[8:39] in time past unto the fathers by the
[8:42] prophets now for us what we could do is
[8:44] we could look at the Old Testament and
[8:46] say this is a great summation of the Old
[8:48] Testament Moses being a prophet right in
[8:50] the the first five books of the Bible
[8:52] expressing things about God and creation
[8:55] bringing them up into the promised land
[8:57] establishing all these uh principles
[8:59] that God then uses with Israel to deal
[9:02] with them he's saying that God spake uh
[9:05] in the prophet so God would come to the
[9:07] prophets reveal himself to the prophets
[9:09] and then when they spoke they would
[9:11] speak on behalf of God and it would be
[9:14] the word in them being expressed and we
[9:16] recognize scripture after scripture says
[9:18] the word of the Lord came to the prophet
[9:20] the word of the Lord came to the prophet
[9:21] and that's how he was made known the
[9:23] word came to the prophet he spoke it to
[9:24] Israel
[9:25] and brother Brandon makes this statement
[9:27] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[9:29] I would even give you maybe a steady
[9:31] point you could go and just look at the
[9:32] terminology of expression expressed
[9:34] expressing and look at it in Christ The
[9:37] Mystery of God revealed and you'll find
[9:38] it it's over and over and over again
[9:40] this is the threefold purpose of God to
[9:43] express himself
[9:44] he says the entire Bible is an
[9:46] expression of one goal that God had one
[9:48] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[9:50] entire Bible what a summation saying
[9:52] that the Bible expresses one goal one
[9:55] purpose that he wanted to achieve and
[9:57] all the acts of the Believers in the
[9:59] Bible have been in type
[10:01] now think of that in type Shadow and
[10:04] expressing what God's Great goal is I
[10:07] think that's a mouthful I think he says
[10:09] it says a lot in that statement that
[10:11] this entire Bible is expressing one goal
[10:15] and one purpose that he wanted to
[10:17] achieve and then he say the acts of the
[10:20] Believers in the Bible you could say the
[10:22] apostles and you could go to the
[10:23] prophets as this scripture saying it
[10:25] that it was in type expressing God's
[10:28] heart purpose or what he wanted to
[10:30] achieve brother I'm saying that thing
[10:31] that he had in the back part of his mind
[10:33] he says and now and this to me I guess
[10:36] is the real
[10:37] the real part to chew on he says now in
[10:41] this last day he has revealed it and
[10:43] shows it
[10:45] now this is this is narrowing God who
[10:48] feels all time in space and
[10:50] who is uh we cannot fathom him he's
[10:54] saying he's narrowed it all down to say
[10:56] that this great goal that God had this
[10:58] thought that he had in the back part of
[11:00] his mind this central theme they had in
[11:02] his heart is revealed and he's shown it
[11:06] in the last days now that's quite a
[11:08] statement
[11:09] it's a statement that we should often
[11:12] remind ourselves of when we're combing
[11:14] through the message to understand what
[11:16] is being taught when we're listening to
[11:18] the the messages and we're studying them
[11:20] we should always be reminding ourselves
[11:23] that God had one goal and one purpose
[11:27] and that he has expressed it in the last
[11:30] days and he is showing it in the last
[11:33] days
[11:34] and as he says that he was shown in
[11:38] types
[11:39] in the Bible and that God was expressing
[11:42] these things in the Bible
[11:45] there is something that repeats again
[11:47] and I think that's I want to just take
[11:50] that from that statement that he says
[11:51] there and now in the last days he's
[11:53] revealed it and shows it this is a
[11:55] repeat of something
[11:57] because in verse 2 verse 1 said God
[12:01] half verse 2 in these last days spoken
[12:04] to us unto us by his son
[12:07] now as Paul would write this we know
[12:10] that Paul
[12:12] was not one of the disciples
[12:14] but yet he had met Jesus Christ Our Lord
[12:17] and Christ had made himself known to him
[12:20] and that Paul's gospel I believe he
[12:22] touched on this uh uh maybe before we
[12:25] left how that we'd have to look at
[12:27] Paul's faith and his conversion as not a
[12:29] as a turning away from the Jewish
[12:31] religion or turning away from his faith
[12:33] but a fulfillment of his faith
[12:35] and it says hath in these last days
[12:37] spoken unto us by his son so now Paul
[12:40] orienting them the Hebrews to the fact
[12:43] that God used prophets but now he raised
[12:47] up one liken unto Moses this was the
[12:50] Messiah and he has spoken by his son now
[12:53] not the word coming to a prophet who
[12:56] spoke on behalf of God but now God has
[12:58] spoken by his son and brother Branham
[13:01] says that in the last days he's revealed
[13:03] it and showed it so there so now he's
[13:05] saying Paul says in the last days he
[13:07] spoke by his son now brother Branham
[13:09] saying in the last days he's doing
[13:10] something
[13:12] and speaking of the son whom he hath
[13:14] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[13:17] also he made the worlds that's a that's
[13:19] heavy lifting that statement who being
[13:22] the brightness of his glory
[13:26] so Christ is in the brightness of the
[13:29] glory of God he is the light of God this
[13:32] is he's manifesting God's uh something
[13:34] about God and the express image of his
[13:39] person and I so I I'll just stop on that
[13:42] verse there
[13:44] and that portion of this verse here
[13:47] he is the express image of his person
[13:50] Christ is
[13:52] so God hath spoken by the son who is the
[13:55] express image just take that phrase
[13:57] Express image and hold it in your heart
[14:00] now brother Bradham writes this in the
[14:02] church age book
[14:04] he says down through the centuries we
[14:06] could go and I think that kind of ties
[14:08] back into the entire Bible as the
[14:09] expression of one goal that God had
[14:11] and all the acts of the Believers in the
[14:13] Bible were in types it's down through
[14:14] the century as we could go we find a
[14:16] Moses a Jeremiah John the Baptist and
[14:19] each one of these were God's Eternal
[14:21] thought expressed in its season
[14:24] that phrasing there is even good to
[14:27] study sometimes in its season the word
[14:29] in its season and you'll find that there
[14:32] are certain things that are the word but
[14:34] it's appropriate in its season it must
[14:36] be an appropriate season and therefore
[14:38] if something has a season then God's
[14:41] word in that season had a particular
[14:43] purpose God's word in that season had a
[14:46] particular manifestation the expression
[14:48] of God in Moses was one who was sent to
[14:52] take the Israelites out of slavery in
[14:55] bondage and but Jeremiah his ministry
[14:59] isn't exactly the same to go down into
[15:01] Egypt and to bring them out John the
[15:03] Baptist isn't exactly the same they
[15:05] manifest it's the word manifested in its
[15:08] season to meet the need that is
[15:10] presented to that age
[15:13] and he says each one where God's Eternal
[15:15] thought expressed in its season
[15:18] and I'm some some of the foundation the
[15:22] undergirding to this that we're not
[15:23] necessarily going to read all the
[15:25] statements from the message and all the
[15:26] scriptures these are things that are in
[15:28] God's heart or mind
[15:31] uh with him in the beginning part of his
[15:34] thought and his heart that are being
[15:35] expressed
[15:38] now continue and he says then we come to
[15:40] Jesus the logos
[15:43] there's a
[15:45] the word manifest in it sees in word
[15:47] manifest in its season then it comes to
[15:49] Jesus the logos and he says
[15:51] he was the perfect and complete thought
[15:56] expressed
[15:58] now glimpses in Moses in Jeremiah John
[16:01] the Baptist and you see shadows and
[16:04] types and you could even say with Joseph
[16:06] that he represented Perfection but he
[16:08] wasn't the Perfection there was just
[16:10] something portrayed in him that pointed
[16:13] to the perfect one that was coming David
[16:16] a man after God's Own Heart from which
[16:18] the the root and stem and the branch is
[16:20] going to come but yet he's not it
[16:23] when God brings forth the Messiah he
[16:26] doesn't resurrect David from the grave
[16:28] and say he was hit amongst you all this
[16:30] time he says then he comes and Jesus the
[16:33] logos is the perfect and complete
[16:36] perfect and complete thought expressed
[16:40] and he became known as the word
[16:44] that's
[16:45] each one of these statements is
[16:47] significant he was the perfect
[16:50] and complete thought
[16:52] expressed
[16:54] we could all have we could have thoughts
[16:57] in our minds that we think about
[17:00] and and they and they might even
[17:01] characterize us in a certain way I'm
[17:03] always thinking about this I'm thinking
[17:05] about this but then the thought is
[17:07] Vindicated or proven uh when we Act
[17:11] and and I think this may be the most
[17:13] commonly uttered phrase by parents is
[17:15] what were you thinking
[17:17] right and the most commonly uttered
[17:19] answer is nothing
[17:22] but there had to be some thought process
[17:25] that instigated the action
[17:28] and so brother Adam's just not saying
[17:30] thought but it's expressed
[17:32] and that thought Express became known as
[17:35] the word he says that is what he is and
[17:37] forever will be
[17:40] this is
[17:42] Christ the son
[17:44] in the expressed image of his person
[17:47] the perfect and complete thought
[17:49] expressed
[17:51] the Bible says God hath by his son
[17:54] spoken
[17:55] we know that in John chapter 1 verse 1
[17:57] in the beginning was the word the word
[18:00] was with God and the Word was God
[18:02] there's this
[18:04] one and the same this Oneness there with
[18:07] God The God Who is invisible then the
[18:09] God who becomes expressed and the
[18:11] invisible God not expressed in the logos
[18:13] the son and pre-figure before anything
[18:15] else exists
[18:17] and then to verse 14 John chapter 1
[18:19] verse 14. and brother John are we done
[18:21] with the slideshow take out your pen and
[18:23] paper you can take notes now
[18:25] it says John chapter 1 verse 14 and the
[18:28] Word was made flesh
[18:30] this is God who hath spoken by his son
[18:33] God who was the word in the beginning
[18:35] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[18:38] this characterization and we beheld to
[18:40] his glory
[18:41] this is the glory of the son but he says
[18:43] the Glorious of the only begotten of the
[18:45] father
[18:46] as a son then he he's not an uh uh he's
[18:51] not somebody who has just taken off the
[18:54] streets and say well I want to make you
[18:55] my son and my son died and I just want
[18:57] to adopt you and make you my son the son
[19:00] is the builder of the family name he is
[19:03] he is an expression of the attributes
[19:05] and the genes of the father just as our
[19:07] children Express mom and dad there this
[19:10] is the same for Christ he is the he is
[19:14] the son the only begotten of the father
[19:15] so when he says he's the only child at
[19:18] this point he's saying this is the one
[19:20] that expresses what was in God
[19:23] we haven't seen it anywhere else
[19:26] Moses may have manifested God in its
[19:29] season and he may have been a God to the
[19:30] people and Jeremiah may have been an
[19:32] expression of God and David a man after
[19:35] God's Own Heart expressed certain
[19:36] characteristics of God and in Joseph we
[19:38] can see the type of the Messiah
[19:40] ascending to the throne through
[19:41] suffering but yet we have never seen God
[19:44] expressed this way until the word was
[19:47] made flesh in Jesus Christ
[19:50] the Son of God and says full of grace
[19:53] and truth
[19:54] [Music]
[19:56] this is something that was
[19:58] uh part of God's nature God wanted to
[20:02] express who he was
[20:05] I if we could put it in the words of
[20:07] Coach green uh he he is who we thought
[20:11] he was right
[20:12] the he he is who he is
[20:15] but he's not happy being who he is he
[20:19] wants to express who he is
[20:22] something made manifest so Genesis 1 1
[20:25] in the beginning God created the heavens
[20:27] and the Earth and I was going back
[20:29] through yesterday and all the times that
[20:30] we've ministered on these scriptures
[20:32] and and how frequently we've uh
[20:36] ministered on these things and I just
[20:39] felt this release to revisit some of it
[20:40] because I'm wanting to give a little bit
[20:41] of a different emphasis on the
[20:43] expressing part
[20:44] God in the beginning created the heavens
[20:47] and the Earth he is expressing himself
[20:49] in his creation
[20:51] and then John 1 1 in the beginning was
[20:54] the word and the Word was with God and
[20:55] the Word was God now we see Genesis 1 1
[20:58] John 1 1 are united together in John 1
[21:02] 14.
[21:03] the word was made flesh in the beginning
[21:06] was the word and the word created and
[21:09] the word manifested in the word created
[21:11] all the things that are therein as the
[21:13] Bible's saying and and he brought all
[21:15] these things forth God bringing these
[21:17] things forth but now that word is made
[21:19] flesh in Jesus Christ
[21:22] God wanting to express himself happy
[21:26] just to let himself out piece by piece
[21:28] Through the Ages and through the Old
[21:30] Testament but it was just building and
[21:33] maybe this seems anticlimactic but it
[21:36] was built into the climax of Jesus
[21:38] Christ
[21:39] born of a woman
[21:41] born in a stable
[21:43] the life of Jesus Christ was the climax
[21:46] this is the the head of it
[21:49] so brother Branham said then Jesus came
[21:51] the logos
[21:53] in John 1 1 in the beginning was the
[21:55] word that word there is logos the Greek
[21:57] word logos and we're all very familiar
[21:59] with that that phrasing
[22:01] and brother man brings this out in the
[22:04] church age book and this is where I'm
[22:05] drawing this from
[22:07] the logos is that which isn't spoken
[22:10] and it being spoken it embodies a
[22:13] concept
[22:14] or an idea
[22:16] oh if we say a word is a thought
[22:19] expressed then there has to be some idea
[22:22] some kind of concept with the word if I
[22:26] just said
[22:27] and you say well yeah too
[22:30] and you want to go habitat later
[22:32] do you want habata for lunch and say
[22:34] well I mean it's a sound maybe there's
[22:36] some enunciation there and maybe I'm
[22:38] speaking a language that I don't
[22:39] understand and yet it's there's no what
[22:43] what's what's the meaning of it what's
[22:45] what's behind it what does that phrase
[22:47] mean and that can be the the the trial
[22:50] of trying to learn English right
[22:52] reported we use phrases like man that's
[22:54] bad you're like oh yeah bad no no no
[22:56] good no that's good
[22:58] and if any of your kids say man that is
[23:01] sick and you say well we'll pray for it
[23:03] no no no no no that's good
[23:04] and so sometimes we're using a language
[23:06] that the word on it on the surface
[23:09] wouldn't necessarily convey what we're
[23:11] trying to mean but there's a thought and
[23:13] intent behind it
[23:15] and that's where to me I still feel like
[23:17] the logo sometimes maybe it's more in
[23:20] theological circles they get into the
[23:21] ream of oh wait wait the logos is one
[23:23] thing we want the Rima but the logos
[23:25] itself is everything the logos is spoken
[23:29] it is the word and what it does is it
[23:31] carries a concept
[23:34] or some idea
[23:36] some principle
[23:38] if I can say characteristic
[23:41] and brother Brown makes this statement
[23:42] the concept of God was expressed in
[23:45] Jesus
[23:51] nobody's going to shout at that one
[23:55] the concept of God was expressed in
[23:58] Jesus he says God became expressed in
[24:02] the person of Jesus Christ
[24:04] God the invisible is expressed the the
[24:09] person of Jesus Christ expressed God
[24:13] and when he uses the phrase the concept
[24:15] of God and he's bringing it from this
[24:16] Greek word logos which is not just a
[24:18] thought but it deals with speech so it's
[24:21] an articulation of something it's the
[24:23] expression of something God as a concept
[24:28] I maybe we don't even think about the
[24:30] concept of God
[24:32] but Elohim the logos
[24:35] embodied something and this concept of
[24:39] who God is and what he is is expressed
[24:41] in Jesus
[24:45] and then he makes this statement and I I
[24:47] want to amplify this for the remainder
[24:49] of our time today and into tomorrow
[24:52] morning
[24:53] Jesus Christ was
[24:57] I haven't preached for a week now I did
[24:59] preach Sunday and Wednesday we were gone
[25:01] then I didn't preach on a Sunday and
[25:03] Wednesday it's fabulous
[25:05] he says Jesus Christ was God expressing
[25:09] himself
[25:10] in man
[25:12] two men
[25:15] Jesus Christ was God
[25:18] expressing himself and you're having to
[25:21] kind of use your mind and think a little
[25:22] bit that there is Jesus Christ
[25:24] the word made flesh not born between a
[25:29] man and a woman but born of a woman
[25:32] and the Very the blood cells that made
[25:35] him up were the spoken word of God so
[25:37] he's bypassed a sinful birth but yet he
[25:40] comes through the woman and here of this
[25:42] one Jesus the man Christ Jesus it says
[25:46] God is expressing himself in Jesus
[25:49] Christ
[25:51] and two men
[25:54] so God is in Jesus expressing himself to
[25:58] humanity
[26:00] Jesus Christ was God expressing himself
[26:03] in Jesus Christ to man
[26:07] so give some deep thought to this
[26:10] Jesus Christ was God expressing himself
[26:15] to express something is to represent
[26:17] uh visually as an artist would render
[26:21] something and that's that's an
[26:22] expression of some creative thought so
[26:24] to express is to represent visually or
[26:27] to put into words
[26:29] where and we could say uh you know I can
[26:32] say well I'm angry and that's an
[26:34] expression of some feeling that I'm
[26:35] having or some emotion that I'm
[26:37] experiencing or it could just merely be
[26:39] vented out through some sort of display
[26:41] that uh that is speaking of the fact oh
[26:44] well he must be upset or maybe when you
[26:46] yawn or you fall asleep that's an
[26:48] expression that you're tired and there's
[26:49] a way that you're showing what's on the
[26:51] inside is coming out
[26:53] and one of the things that I find myself
[26:55] as a parent uh dealing with my children
[26:58] is not so much what they're feeling
[27:01] because those are things that maybe we
[27:03] can't control you have to be very
[27:05] careful as parents says don't you cry
[27:06] you know and I mean they're just made up
[27:09] of emotions you're the most cryinst
[27:12] person we've ever met of course your
[27:13] kids are going to cry and so there's a
[27:15] there's a certain thing that they're
[27:16] just they're gonna do it and and so
[27:18] there's a point in which it's okay if
[27:20] you're frustrated I understand that
[27:22] you're upset I realize uh that you're
[27:24] bored or you're experiencing certain
[27:25] emotions but the ability to to mediate
[27:29] those emotions and to control those
[27:31] emotions and to not always express them
[27:33] that way that's the mark of maturity and
[27:36] that's the mark of recognizing wow I'm
[27:38] really angry right now and I want to
[27:39] punch the wall but punching the wall
[27:41] wouldn't be the right way to deal with
[27:44] my anger
[27:45] because there's a there's a the
[27:47] expressing you could do something
[27:48] visually or an action or to put it into
[27:50] words
[27:51] and this phrase to express means to
[27:53] speak one's mind
[27:55] and this is what God was doing when it
[27:58] says that Jesus Christ was God
[27:59] expressing himself it was God ex
[28:02] speaking his mind
[28:04] and to express something that means to
[28:08] press it or to squeeze it out
[28:12] if you're going to express you represent
[28:14] something it's to describe it to portray
[28:17] it to imitate it or to translate it so
[28:20] God is being represented God is being
[28:24] portrayed in Jesus Christ and to express
[28:27] means to literally it means to press out
[28:29] and just to wake everybody up it means
[28:30] espresso anybody want another shot
[28:34] how many do you need today
[28:36] an espresso that's where we get this
[28:38] Latin phrase it means to press out this
[28:40] expression to press it comes to the
[28:42] Latin Premiere means to press
[28:44] so here's Jesus Christ and God is
[28:47] pressing himself
[28:49] uh in Christ and he's pressing himself
[28:52] into this this manifestation if God who
[28:56] is invisible God the law Gods who in
[28:58] times past would reveal himself to a
[29:00] prophet and and that would be the word
[29:02] in the prophet being spoken but they're
[29:04] just glimpses and shadows and types and
[29:06] they're imperfect and and they fail and
[29:08] they made mistakes but now there came
[29:10] one who was the logos and it's God
[29:13] pressed God pressed into man
[29:18] but now that God has spoken by his son
[29:21] and pressed into man but now he wants to
[29:25] press chill man
[29:30] to this Latin word means as clay Under
[29:32] Pressure takes the form of an image
[29:37] so if God has expressed
[29:39] that means God who has some sort of
[29:42] representation
[29:44] he's pressed and it forms this image
[29:47] this Mark if I could put this this
[29:49] identification
[29:51] John chapter 14
[29:55] verse 7 to 12.
[29:58] just read this with me I'm only going to
[30:00] be picking up on
[30:02] uh one particular part here
[30:06] are just a few things that we want to
[30:08] carry forward just recognize this as we
[30:10] read this if you had known me you should
[30:12] have known the father
[30:14] also now that's that's what the sun is
[30:17] to do to express this invisible God that
[30:20] cannot be touched cannot be handled
[30:21] cannot be felt uh that that the children
[30:25] of Israel said don't even speak to us
[30:26] have somebody else speak to us
[30:28] said if you knew me you would know God
[30:30] also and from henceforth you know him
[30:33] and have seen him
[30:35] now I believe that Philip was tapping
[30:38] into it
[30:39] and he's kind of on the edge of his seat
[30:41] and he's kind of he's recognizing wait a
[30:43] minute I get it now
[30:45] that what I'm looking at
[30:48] is the as the son of God
[30:51] is to show me who the father is
[30:54] and and as this excitement Wells up with
[30:57] them he says Lord show us the father and
[30:59] it sufficeth us and I think this is
[31:02] spoken from a place of longing in a
[31:03] place of Faith as the Jews with this God
[31:05] who could not be seen he could not be
[31:07] touched and could not be handled if
[31:08] something is stirring up inside well
[31:10] just then just show us the fathers
[31:12] you've seen him let us see him and Jesus
[31:14] says have I been so long time with you
[31:17] and yet hast thou not known me Philip
[31:20] and
[31:22] then I guess if we could put it in these
[31:24] these words
[31:25] I've been with you this long in this
[31:28] time that I've been with you
[31:30] you still haven't figured it out
[31:33] that that he that hath seen me hath seen
[31:37] the father
[31:39] and then why do you say how I say thou
[31:41] men show us the father
[31:43] when you see me you see God
[31:47] and Phillips thinking yeah but as a
[31:50] human
[31:51] that's not Computing to me
[31:53] if there's one Beyond you then that's
[31:56] the one I want to see and Jesus is
[31:58] bringing out something a mystery of
[32:00] heaven and he's saying no when you've
[32:03] seen me you've seen the father
[32:06] that in beholding me and me making
[32:08] myself known and seeing me this is how
[32:11] God has made known
[32:13] I've been with you this long and yet you
[32:15] still don't know me
[32:18] if I could just uh use some conjecture
[32:21] here
[32:22] and I'm not saying it is this way
[32:26] but in the short time that he had been
[32:27] with them
[32:29] is is Jesus even acknowledging
[32:33] that the more they became familiar with
[32:36] Christ in a certain way
[32:38] the less they were being coming in tune
[32:41] with the supernatural that was in them
[32:45] that if if I wanted to see God and then
[32:48] I saw Jesus Christ he says that and he
[32:51] and he's speaking of things that he's
[32:52] doing he's doing the things that he's
[32:53] doing then after a while I can begin to
[32:55] identify with Christ in such a way to
[32:57] where say well he's got hands like me
[33:00] got feet like me got hair like me this
[33:04] is and I start to look at him in such a
[33:06] way and Jesus have I been with you so
[33:08] long that you become familiar with
[33:10] certain things about me that that is
[33:12] opticating the view that you can't
[33:14] actually see the father being expressed
[33:17] because you identified too much with the
[33:20] humanity
[33:22] I hope you could really give thought to
[33:24] Jesus Christ was God expressing himself
[33:27] in man and to men
[33:30] he says when you've seen me you've seen
[33:32] the father
[33:35] believeth thou not that I am in the
[33:36] father and the father in me
[33:38] the words that I speak unto you I speak
[33:40] not of them of myself catch this
[33:42] phrasing but the father that dwelleth in
[33:44] me he doeth the works
[33:48] therefore what I do he's saying is God
[33:52] doing it in me
[33:54] the father dwelleth in me he does the
[33:57] works therefore the works that I'm doing
[33:59] are the manifestation of him whom you
[34:01] cannot see this is the manifestation of
[34:04] him who was before all things and though
[34:07] someone in the Old Testament could have
[34:09] done one thing and that expressed an
[34:11] attribute of God Moses standing in the
[34:13] Gap Kings making certain proclamations
[34:16] say glimpses and and little scenes we
[34:18] say now God is in me he does the works
[34:23] he says believe me that I am in the
[34:25] father and the father and me or else
[34:26] believe me for the very work's sake
[34:32] so this is the proposition of verse 10.
[34:35] the father God is manifested in the son
[34:40] and he says believe me that I'm in the
[34:42] father and the father and me now he's
[34:44] saying take me out my word
[34:46] and this is the hardest thing that
[34:49] brother Branham said that we have to do
[34:51] is to get one mortal man to believe
[34:52] another
[34:54] and and I the the reason of that is
[34:56] as because you know when someone makes a
[34:59] promise we just kind of poke them a
[35:01] little bit and check their pulse we're
[35:02] like yeah you have a heartbeat just like
[35:04] me you were born just like me you
[35:06] breathed just like me and I know what
[35:09] how humans are and I know what they're
[35:11] like and I know what they're prone to
[35:12] and there's certain things about the
[35:14] human characteristics but he's saying
[35:16] that now don't just if you can he's
[35:20] asking us to take him at his word
[35:22] believe me because I tell you that the
[35:25] father is in me and he's doing the works
[35:27] he says but if you won't take me at my
[35:29] word my very works
[35:33] my very works are now going to back up
[35:36] what I'm saying
[35:39] and it's not a matter of him saying you
[35:42] know God's left-handed did you know that
[35:45] all right and he's gonna you're gonna
[35:46] sign his name with his left hand
[35:48] everybody oh
[35:49] right look he's God God's left-handed
[35:52] he's writing with his left hand it's not
[35:54] some sort of arbitrary physical act by
[35:57] saying you believe me for my work's sake
[36:00] verily verily I say unto you now this is
[36:02] where it gets heavy
[36:03] verily verily I say unto you he that
[36:06] believeth on me the works that I do
[36:09] shall he do also
[36:12] he's saying believe me that I am in the
[36:15] father and the father in me believe me
[36:17] and he that believes him and takes him
[36:20] out his word The Works that I do shall
[36:23] he do also
[36:25] I think that's quite a statement
[36:27] The Works that he did the believer will
[36:30] do also
[36:31] and then he just takes it a step further
[36:33] and Greater Works than these
[36:36] shall he do who the believer
[36:38] because I go unto my father
[36:42] and this is no small thing and we read
[36:44] right past it and and yet we could spend
[36:47] the rest of our time together here on
[36:48] Earth just taking the Greater Works the
[36:51] Greater Works than thee shall he do
[36:52] because I go into my father and these
[36:55] these we can look at greater than these
[36:58] the v's of Christ we could spend
[37:01] eternity expressing the things written
[37:03] in this Bible we could just go over and
[37:06] over and over because it was gone
[37:08] expressing himself in man to me so
[37:12] there's some concept of God that's being
[37:14] portrayed to me and these works that are
[37:17] recorded here and these things that
[37:19] pertain to Christ they're expressing God
[37:20] and then I could take it a step further
[37:22] say Greater Works than these the
[37:25] Believers going to do wow we can amplify
[37:28] that Without End he says because I go to
[37:30] my father and there's something that can
[37:32] be Amplified Without End
[37:35] now if I could express it this way
[37:40] there's somebody counting how many times
[37:41] I say Express are the derivatives
[37:42] thereof this is when he says this the
[37:46] father that dweth in me he doeth the
[37:48] works
[37:49] and it comes back to it believe me for
[37:51] the very work's sake if you believe the
[37:53] works that I do shall you do also
[37:54] Greater Works than these because I go to
[37:56] my father what he is referring to is a
[38:00] special expression
[38:03] it's a unique quality
[38:06] there's some unique quality to his works
[38:09] that sets him apart
[38:12] there's there's something about these
[38:16] works
[38:18] that
[38:19] would make make him different
[38:22] than all the prophets
[38:25] something different about the works that
[38:28] he's saying believe me
[38:31] I I'm just overwhelmed with it and so
[38:34] I'm
[38:35] I'm doing my best to
[38:38] to drink out of a fire hydrant and tell
[38:39] you what it tastes like
[38:42] there's
[38:43] there's God expressed in Christ
[38:48] I says the father that dwelleth in me
[38:50] he's doing the works
[38:52] and he's confident enough to say
[38:55] The Works that I do
[38:57] will declare to you God will declare to
[39:00] you the father
[39:02] and and bring inciting bring of faith
[39:05] to do the Greater Works if I could even
[39:07] go so far as to say that
[39:10] and these works are so special and
[39:12] unique and I know you're just you're
[39:14] wanting me to tell you what they are I'm
[39:15] just saying they are
[39:18] so special and unique that Christ could
[39:20] say that you can believe me for those
[39:24] work's sake
[39:27] wow
[39:29] some unique quality
[39:31] that declared God
[39:36] John chapter 1 verse 18 says no man have
[39:39] seen God at any time
[39:41] the only begotten son is we're coming
[39:43] back to the very phrasings of verse 14.
[39:46] no man has seen him physically with his
[39:49] eyes you say well Moses saw the backside
[39:52] of God that was a way that God chose to
[39:54] express himself
[39:56] uh and it but it was it's with measure
[39:58] it's limited
[40:00] I there's things and I'm wanting you to
[40:02] think as I told you in the very
[40:04] beginning or towards the beginning let's
[40:06] give deep thought to how he says that
[40:08] God Christ was expressed God expressing
[40:11] himself in man to man
[40:14] and there's things where God
[40:17] moved
[40:19] and there was a wind
[40:21] there was an earthquake
[40:23] there's a fire
[40:25] and these are things that are the
[40:27] effects God causing them
[40:29] so there are in some way a manifestation
[40:31] or expression of God's presence but you
[40:34] couldn't find God in it
[40:36] he wasn't in the wind he wasn't in the
[40:38] fire he's not in the earthquake
[40:40] in other words God's concept or his idea
[40:44] and what he's trying to convey yes
[40:47] that's him
[40:48] but don't you want to those are things
[40:51] that he's caused or some sort of
[40:53] stirring but don't you want to know him
[40:57] but that that's one thing that he can
[41:00] cause that it's one thing that he can be
[41:02] seen in that but those are just kind of
[41:05] partial glimpses we see God in creation
[41:07] we see him in the glory of the sunrise
[41:09] and the sunset we see his fingerprints
[41:12] in nature and there's a lot of ways that
[41:14] are declaring to us God's design and
[41:15] God's purpose but yet I'm not happy
[41:18] seeing him in the beauty of his creation
[41:19] I'm not I though I'm happy to see him
[41:23] and you but I want to know him in a way
[41:26] that's Transcendent beyond the human
[41:29] things I want to know him in a way that
[41:31] he can only be known by
[41:33] Hallelujah
[41:35] there's something about this this
[41:38] expression of Christ that no man has
[41:40] seen God at any time and then the
[41:42] pausing of John the only begotten son
[41:44] which is in the bosom of the father he
[41:48] hath
[41:49] declared him
[41:52] that is to say that up to this moment no
[41:55] man can say that they have seen God but
[41:57] now we can say we have seen God
[42:00] in Jesus's own words he says have I been
[42:03] I've been with you if you've seen me
[42:05] you've seen God
[42:07] and the Very phrase in the bosom of God
[42:10] we might think in the sense of well one
[42:11] who's nestled there at the Chester one
[42:14] that might be very near to him but it
[42:16] means the one who is the same as God
[42:20] who is in the bosom of the father who is
[42:24] at the heart of who he is who is Central
[42:27] to his person Christ the son of God the
[42:31] only begotten son who is in the bosom
[42:33] who is the same as God he hath declared
[42:37] him He has expressed him Christ who is
[42:41] in the image of man God has pressed
[42:44] himself into this person and has it has
[42:47] portrayed and has translated himself to
[42:51] man we could have never seen him unless
[42:55] God chose a means which was Slash to say
[42:59] who he was
[43:01] because Jesus Christ was God expressing
[43:03] himself in man
[43:05] two men
[43:08] but the Branham takes this in the church
[43:10] age book The Perkins age chapter five
[43:14] the language is so close to Hebrews one
[43:17] God
[43:18] who on occasions would manifest his
[43:20] presence by the cloud or pillar fire
[43:23] that struck fear in the hearts of men
[43:26] this is God's expression in the Old
[43:27] Testament sundry times in diverse
[43:29] manners God could manifest in a pillar
[43:31] fire god could be expressed in a cloud
[43:34] God could manifest himself in
[43:36] Supernatural signs and wonders I said
[43:38] God as he wants to God can do whatever
[43:40] he wants
[43:43] this God
[43:45] whose hard characteristics were made
[43:48] known only by revelation of words
[43:50] through the prophets
[43:52] so these things God's will God's desire
[43:54] he would speak him to His prophets
[43:56] prophets would make it known this is
[43:57] track in Hebrews chapter 1.
[43:59] now became Emmanuel
[44:02] God who manifested in certain ways
[44:04] pillar fire cloud Who certain
[44:06] characteristics should be known by the
[44:07] revelation of words
[44:09] says now became Emmanuel God With Us
[44:15] declaring himself
[44:18] this is John 1 18 declaring himself he
[44:22] takes this word in John 1 18 the word
[44:23] declare
[44:24] is taken from the Greek root which we
[44:27] often interpret as exegesis
[44:30] and maybe that gets some of you excited
[44:32] but we're not going to get into the
[44:34] exegesis on it but he says it's
[44:36] interpreted which means to thoroughly
[44:38] explain and make clear
[44:42] the exegesis is the proper
[44:44] interpretation the correct
[44:46] interpretation he's saying that Jesus
[44:49] God made himself known through
[44:51] revelation of words God made himself
[44:53] known through certain signs and wonders
[44:54] but now he has become flesh now he has
[44:59] declaring himself and this declaration
[45:01] means to thoroughly explain and make
[45:04] clear
[45:06] Jesus Christ thoroughly explains it
[45:10] makes clear this God who gave glimpses
[45:14] of heart characteristics and would
[45:16] temporarily manifest himself through
[45:17] different means now in Jesus Christ he
[45:20] has thoroughly explained and made clear
[45:23] now I'm easy to say right
[45:26] but then go ahead and read read the red
[45:27] letter read the history
[45:30] and you'll find that he still is only
[45:32] known by revelation
[45:33] bet the clarity's there
[45:35] the image is there
[45:37] the express image
[45:39] the only begotten son
[45:42] who is the same as God hath declared has
[45:45] thoroughly explained and made clear who
[45:47] God is he says this is what the Living
[45:49] Word Jesus did he brought God to us for
[45:53] he was God
[45:55] Birmingham even uses the phrase that he
[45:57] revealed God in perfect clarity or with
[45:59] perfect clarity
[46:01] Jesus Christ this one who is born of
[46:03] Mary
[46:05] who lived a life of 33 years
[46:08] his story
[46:11] his teachings his actions his journeys
[46:14] revealed god with perfect clarity
[46:18] are you pondering what I'm pondering how
[46:22] how
[46:24] what made him the perfect revelation of
[46:26] God
[46:28] what are the characteristics
[46:31] it's not even the name because the name
[46:32] pre-existed to him
[46:35] it's not the fact that he was a a male
[46:38] who circumcised at a certain age because
[46:41] there was ones before him
[46:43] the clothes that he wore were commonly
[46:46] worn the food that he ate was commonly
[46:48] eaten there's a lot of things about
[46:49] Jesus Christ that we could say well
[46:52] uh these are all things that we could
[46:55] say are human
[46:57] therefore that begs the question what is
[47:00] divine
[47:03] can I ask that question of you today
[47:04] what is deity
[47:08] what is the logos
[47:10] who is this Elohim
[47:13] what is essential to him
[47:15] and what makes him who he is
[47:18] and how is it that I can know him
[47:20] through Jesus Christ
[47:22] what is it about this man Christ Jesus
[47:25] the the son of Joseph and Mary who lived
[47:28] a life on and in Galilee this Jesus and
[47:31] Nazareth how is it that he shows me with
[47:34] perfect clarity who God is how is he the
[47:37] perfect revelation of God
[47:39] so much so to her John could write in
[47:41] first John verses one and two that which
[47:43] was from the beginning which we have
[47:46] heard
[47:46] which we have seen with our eyes
[47:49] which we have looked upon and our hands
[47:51] had handled
[47:54] now John could say this in every single
[47:56] one of these
[47:58] he could say literally
[48:01] by means of physical sins
[48:05] I've heard
[48:06] I've seen
[48:08] I've looked upon I've gaze that I've
[48:11] processed and my hands have handled
[48:15] if you came to John said oh there was no
[48:18] Jesus of Nazareth he said I touched them
[48:22] I've held us I've leaned into his chest
[48:25] I've seen him
[48:27] I've heard them
[48:28] that which was from the beginning
[48:31] he says the word of life
[48:35] the word of life
[48:37] oh what a what a phrase the word of life
[48:42] as it's
[48:44] expressed
[48:46] The Word of Life what a phrase
[48:50] we've heard we've seen we've looked upon
[48:54] we've handled
[48:56] and so he explained he explained he's
[48:57] talking about Jesus Christ so he
[49:00] explains and it's kind of put in
[49:01] parentheses for the life was manifested
[49:04] the life was manifested
[49:06] and we have seen it and bear witness and
[49:10] shown to you that eternal life this is
[49:13] First John chapter one verses one and
[49:15] two that which was from the beginning
[49:17] the word of life has been manifested and
[49:20] that's what we're showing to you eternal
[49:22] life he says which was with the father
[49:24] and was manifested unto us
[49:27] this is God himself who is the word the
[49:31] word Zoe life there's only one form of
[49:33] eternal life this is God expressed this
[49:36] is Jesus Christ who is the Living Word
[49:39] that makes God present he is now he was
[49:43] manifested unto us
[49:46] this is why brother Brandon could say
[49:47] the concept of God was expressed in
[49:50] Jesus Jesus Christ was God expressing
[49:53] himself in men to men
[49:56] he became
[49:58] that perfect
[50:01] expression
[50:04] of God
[50:07] his brother Branham says in the church
[50:08] age book here it is most evidently set
[50:11] forth that and I believe this is his
[50:12] commentary in first John 1.
[50:14] here it is most evidently set forth that
[50:17] the perfect manifestation of God in the
[50:20] son
[50:21] was by the indwelling spirit manifesting
[50:24] in word and works
[50:28] here it is most evidently set forth that
[50:31] the perfect manifestation
[50:34] of God
[50:36] so the perfect manifestation of God
[50:38] and here's your formula the indwelling
[50:41] of the spirit
[50:43] there can be no
[50:45] perfect manifestation of God unless the
[50:48] spirit indwells
[50:50] unless the life
[50:52] so when John says that we have looked
[50:54] upon and handled the word of life
[50:57] manifested it's not that we have
[51:00] touched someone who who'd felt the wind
[51:05] we're not we're not hearing from
[51:08] somebody whose house was destroyed by an
[51:11] earthquake when God spoke
[51:13] we're not talking to somebody who found
[51:15] a pyramid-shaped rock in Sabina Canyon
[51:17] this is one who had the life
[51:21] and the life which was the light of men
[51:23] is now living through a person and it's
[51:27] this life that has lived the indwelling
[51:30] of the spirit in the man Christ Jesus is
[51:33] the perfect expression of God or
[51:35] manifestation of God because it's the
[51:37] indwelling spirit manifesting in word
[51:40] and works
[51:42] I could spend a lot of time just on that
[51:44] phrasing in word and works
[51:47] and and my
[51:49] my lead up to this
[51:52] has been
[51:53] that there is a
[51:56] uh
[51:58] the devil would want to
[52:00] the devil's tactic is division and for
[52:03] those of you who hate math
[52:05] right that's the devil's tactic is
[52:09] division
[52:10] and if he can't get you to divide he'll
[52:12] just say get you to add
[52:14] [Music]
[52:15] come on school children
[52:18] all right
[52:19] this is Matthew C
[52:21] this is Rebecca this is by the white
[52:24] Christian Academy whatever brand you are
[52:26] there is a he wants to divide
[52:30] that's just that's his tactic
[52:33] so there is an expression of God
[52:36] and what he would want to do is chop it
[52:38] up
[52:40] think of this
[52:41] Jesus Christ was God expressing himself
[52:44] in man to man
[52:48] brother Adam says the indwelling spirit
[52:50] manifested in word and works
[52:54] so the work these works whatever they
[52:57] were these Works were the word
[53:00] manifested
[53:02] the spirit manifesting Inward and works
[53:07] there are if I could just refer to this
[53:09] for a moment
[53:12] and I'll I'll find a place to stop
[53:17] just hopefully maybe very near here I
[53:19] feel that I'm conveying what's in my
[53:22] heart enough to stop very shortly
[53:27] there are works
[53:30] as we've said already that manifest
[53:33] God's presence
[53:36] but this is a different emphasis
[53:39] the word of life he says the life was
[53:41] manifested
[53:43] are you catching that
[53:44] the life was manifested
[53:46] now Paul says that we understand the
[53:49] things of Man by the spirit of man that
[53:51] is in us and so if I can by the spirit
[53:54] of man understand the nature and the
[53:57] things of man it's because the human
[53:58] Spirit identifies with the human spirit
[54:01] and he goes so far as to express that
[54:03] the things of God the human mind cannot
[54:05] comprehend because that's a different
[54:07] mind it's a different thought it's a
[54:08] different life
[54:09] and in the same way that you ought to be
[54:12] very worried about yourself if you
[54:14] really get your dog right he's like man
[54:16] I get it I know why he rolls around in
[54:18] that stuff
[54:19] I know exactly what he's thinking
[54:25] right I mean there's there's something
[54:27] to be said about
[54:29] you you might be a dog right
[54:32] and that word has all sorts of meanings
[54:34] these days
[54:35] there's something about the nature being
[54:39] expressed that someone else who has this
[54:40] like right on I get it
[54:42] I feel you because it's the life he says
[54:45] the life was manifested so there has to
[54:47] be we have to have a deeper thought to
[54:50] think well how is it a man doing things
[54:53] a man can do
[54:55] is going to express in any way who God
[54:58] is
[54:59] should I just stop there
[55:03] because that's enough to think about
[55:05] but how is it that any one of us we are
[55:08] limited to the mannerisms of men we're
[55:12] limited to the the laws of nature in
[55:14] ways that we find ourselves inclined
[55:17] that if if God had a thought and I was
[55:20] going to express it I would have to use
[55:22] the same means now in terms of God
[55:24] speaking to my heart and I'd say thus
[55:26] saith the Lord the Lord said to do this
[55:27] I would be using the same mouth
[55:31] they eat Cerritos
[55:33] right and the same one that has said so
[55:35] much about how much I like it to people
[55:37] who've had it and didn't like it
[55:40] believe it or not
[55:42] right because you ordered it wrong
[55:44] and as this idea says wow these are
[55:46] these are human sounds and these are
[55:48] human words and these are human
[55:49] expressions and these are things that
[55:51] human does then and then somehow God's
[55:53] trying to convey himself in that if I'm
[55:56] if I'm getting anything across I hope
[55:58] that I'm just kind of putting in words
[56:00] that maybe you haven't been able to that
[56:02] this is something Supernatural to see
[56:05] God it's something it's something oh
[56:08] Hallelujah if he's if you've seen him
[56:10] you should be happy if he's made himself
[56:13] known you that that's the most
[56:14] Supernatural thing that could happen is
[56:16] to get beyond the surface and see him
[56:20] see him standing in his word the same
[56:22] yesterday today and forever
[56:25] and not having been so long with us that
[56:27] all we see anymore is the human part
[56:31] and therefore do the math in our mind
[56:33] and say well
[56:34] then if he's here then the human part
[56:36] must be him
[56:38] then what have we done
[56:41] we've done this and that looks creepy
[56:47] therefore these works
[56:49] that he's referring to cannot be
[56:52] separated from word
[56:54] but this is a different emphasis
[56:58] and the emphasis is from the the in
[57:02] feigning is the is the the Latin to be
[57:05] in to show
[57:07] so God is in something showing means to
[57:10] shine
[57:11] and when you emphasize something if
[57:14] we're going to be doing it in a
[57:15] typography we might use bold we might
[57:17] use a different color we might use all
[57:19] caps and what we're trying to convey is
[57:22] some emphasis
[57:23] that that we're portraying this this
[57:25] extra stress that's given Force that's
[57:28] given to a word or utterance and the
[57:31] emphasis can change the meaning
[57:34] right
[57:36] you know let's eat Grandma you can say
[57:38] well a comma is going to change
[57:39] everything
[57:41] it's just so let's eat Grandma right the
[57:43] emphasis let's eat grandma
[57:46] right the emphasis changes the meaning
[57:48] what what's for lunch because the
[57:52] emphasis gives clarity
[57:54] I I hope that you're picking up when I'm
[57:56] laying down that it's the it's in the
[57:59] emphasis now we are to speak where God
[58:02] speaks and stay silent where God is
[58:04] silent and oh God help us to emphasize
[58:08] what he has emphasized
[58:12] the emphasis the extra stress given to a
[58:16] word that and that that's you're going
[58:18] to emphasize it a little bit
[58:20] and the emphasis is a is a clue
[58:23] that implies there's something more to
[58:25] the surface
[58:27] it's the signification
[58:30] it signifies something
[58:32] it says it has sign it has meaning
[58:35] and brother Adam says this and I'm
[58:37] sharing this just too
[58:39] I guess I'm kind of piecing this out a
[58:41] little bit and I'm running out of time
[58:44] and
[58:46] I'll just skip it
[58:49] so then let's think this way
[58:52] an emphasis in the stress
[58:55] of the word he that believeth on me the
[58:57] works that I do shall he do also
[59:00] what works
[59:02] became the perfect expression of God
[59:06] in his life
[59:09] where was the emphasis
[59:11] that I could pick up on and say there's
[59:12] my CL there's my clue
[59:15] there's the true nature of God
[59:17] Jesus sits down Republicans and Sinners
[59:20] and we say oh there's the nature of God
[59:22] then where are we all going today
[59:23] right we want to fight well that's why
[59:25] we're here but there's a there's an idea
[59:27] in our minds say well am I going to is
[59:29] that what the emphasis is is that where
[59:31] it's at and this is what man has labored
[59:33] to do is to find the formula and say oh
[59:36] well God is where there's this so they
[59:39] come up with this
[59:41] and they want to sell you the Emperor's
[59:42] New Clothes
[59:44] because they want to keep spinning the
[59:45] yarn and building something and it gets
[59:48] enough traction if they can't do it with
[59:49] kind words they'll just bully you into
[59:51] it to make you feel like well isn't this
[59:53] beautiful isn't this great isn't this
[59:56] the word isn't this God this is it right
[1:00:00] this this is it and at first you're like
[1:00:08] and they're like you're a believer
[1:00:10] you're a message believer
[1:00:13] and you don't see this and so you start
[1:00:16] to say yeah yeah I I I I I see it you
[1:00:20] see it right I see it don't we all see
[1:00:22] it you see it right this
[1:00:26] this is God
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:29] and with and and with enough to emphasis
[1:00:31] in us being sincere After all you've got
[1:00:34] that right
[1:00:35] this is it
[1:00:38] then you say this is taking something
[1:00:40] that maybe God uses
[1:00:43] taking something that could be the
[1:00:45] characteristic of God that's revealed
[1:00:47] through through a manifestation but this
[1:00:51] is something different
[1:00:54] where is the true nature of God oh I'll
[1:00:56] say it this way is this something
[1:00:57] different
[1:01:00] it's taking me an hour to get to the
[1:01:02] express image
[1:01:03] now hopefully this will give us
[1:01:05] something to move from
[1:01:09] Jesus Christ was the expressed
[1:01:12] the express image of his person
[1:01:19] the phrase that's used there that is
[1:01:21] written
[1:01:22] it's not past tense
[1:01:24] the express image
[1:01:28] and it makes reference to a person
[1:01:32] that is an exact copy
[1:01:35] is it the ship of our thesis brother
[1:01:37] Michael in philosophy
[1:01:40] oh you're not the philosopher who's the
[1:01:42] philosopher
[1:01:43] there is it the ship of alphysus am I
[1:01:45] getting it right
[1:01:48] brother Luke am I getting am I saying it
[1:01:50] wrong I'm pronouncing it wrong that's
[1:01:52] maybe what I'm doing
[1:01:53] Alfred the ship of Alfred
[1:01:56] the the philosophical argument is
[1:01:59] if you took a ship
[1:02:02] and piece by piece replaced
[1:02:05] a part of the ship
[1:02:07] to where eventually the entire ship has
[1:02:10] been replaced
[1:02:12] is it still the same ship
[1:02:15] all right let's go
[1:02:18] would it even be the same how could it
[1:02:21] be the same how could it be an exact
[1:02:24] ly so the express image is a concept of
[1:02:26] the tool or person that is the Engraving
[1:02:29] or that is that it that is engraving the
[1:02:33] exact copy
[1:02:35] because it's the mark so there's an
[1:02:37] instrument that has the mark
[1:02:39] and so that's the that's the image
[1:02:42] and it's that which is used the express
[1:02:44] image presses
[1:02:46] and when it presses it leaves a mark
[1:02:49] and so by the mark you can tell what the
[1:02:51] original was
[1:02:52] so it's the instrument used for
[1:02:55] Engraving or carving actually comes from
[1:02:57] the word to sharpen to a point so the
[1:03:00] idea of imprinting something or
[1:03:01] scratching something right
[1:03:03] leave a mark
[1:03:06] when he says the express image then of
[1:03:09] his person
[1:03:11] he was the exact expression or image of
[1:03:15] God
[1:03:16] he was that marked likeness or the
[1:03:18] precise reproduction in every detail
[1:03:25] the express image
[1:03:27] therefore is whatever God was that could
[1:03:30] not be seen
[1:03:32] has been pressed into Christ
[1:03:35] so that when you've seen him there's no
[1:03:37] guesswork
[1:03:39] when you whatever you can make out in
[1:03:41] him is a part of God whatever you can
[1:03:43] see in him you can be sure this is God
[1:03:45] this was God
[1:03:47] and the word express image in the Greek
[1:03:50] is
[1:03:51] character
[1:03:55] that's what was being pressed into
[1:03:57] Christ was the character of God
[1:04:00] that if you take a in typography or
[1:04:03] print setting and you have a typeset
[1:04:05] you'd create the letter
[1:04:08] and it would be a carved out and then
[1:04:11] with the ink you put that on paper and
[1:04:14] that's what an old-fashioned typewriter
[1:04:15] would do is it'd take that and replicate
[1:04:17] it on paper
[1:04:19] and you would know what the other image
[1:04:21] was well that was an l and that was an e
[1:04:22] and that was a t and that was a t that
[1:04:24] was an e that was an R because it was
[1:04:25] pressed into the paper using ink and
[1:04:28] this is what God was who was the word is
[1:04:31] pressed into Jesus Christ and that that
[1:04:34] letter that God was that logos that was
[1:04:37] God was that word is pressed into Christ
[1:04:40] he's the character
[1:04:43] he is that character of God and now if
[1:04:46] we take that in what's been meant by
[1:04:48] he's the express image therefore he is
[1:04:51] the defining he has in him the defining
[1:04:55] quality or feature
[1:04:58] as brother Eliza was ministering on
[1:05:00] however this this thing here is just
[1:05:02] mostly space
[1:05:04] and how molecules and the way he was
[1:05:06] even using the the math and science
[1:05:09] and
[1:05:11] I apologize if I felt Vindicated that
[1:05:13] guys came in here the ministers who
[1:05:14] preached were more heady than I have
[1:05:16] been I was like well thank you for
[1:05:18] making me sound more more normal
[1:05:20] uh with the the science that they're
[1:05:22] able to get into I said well yeah that's
[1:05:24] what this is but it this what's the
[1:05:26] state of this solid
[1:05:28] and it's it's presenting in certain
[1:05:31] characteristics and this is what a
[1:05:33] characteristic is a feature
[1:05:36] of H2O H2O can present in different ways
[1:05:40] right
[1:05:41] it could be
[1:05:43] I just need a drink
[1:05:45] it could be a liquid it could be solid
[1:05:47] it could be vapor
[1:05:49] and therefore the it's it's in the
[1:05:51] quality
[1:05:53] a character is a defining quality or
[1:05:54] feature
[1:05:57] you could not just say well this is this
[1:05:58] is a solid then it must be it must be
[1:06:00] H2O
[1:06:02] it wouldn't be
[1:06:04] just because water can be solved doesn't
[1:06:06] mean everything that's solid is water
[1:06:09] the defining quality or of a feature
[1:06:12] character is the sum of qualities that
[1:06:15] define a person
[1:06:17] and distinguish it from another
[1:06:23] Jesus Christ was the express image of
[1:06:27] God
[1:06:28] we could put it this way we could read
[1:06:31] Hebrews 1 verse 3 to say he was the
[1:06:34] character of God
[1:06:37] that in him is the mystery and the
[1:06:40] secret to who God is
[1:06:42] in him was a distinguishing feature
[1:06:45] that made him different from all other
[1:06:47] men
[1:06:49] was the fact that he rose from the dead
[1:06:51] is that what made him God
[1:06:54] other men had risen from the dead
[1:06:56] we could even say if we take the
[1:06:58] scripture and you would accept the
[1:06:59] scripture how it's written and how
[1:07:00] brother Brown taught it that Enoch did
[1:07:03] not taste death
[1:07:05] that Elijah even go in a chair to fire
[1:07:07] that he these are ones that bypassed
[1:07:10] even the physical death that Jesus
[1:07:12] Christ partook of
[1:07:16] there was a defining characteristic a
[1:07:19] distinctive trait there's a distinctive
[1:07:22] trait in the express image to say it's
[1:07:25] the sum there's the math again but now
[1:07:27] this is when it's the total the complete
[1:07:30] the very essence the highest the utmost
[1:07:35] if Jesus Christ was God expressing
[1:07:37] himself in man to man if in him was the
[1:07:39] spirit manifested in word and works and
[1:07:41] he was the perfect manifestation
[1:07:44] that he declared unto us God
[1:07:47] and that he was the perfect and complete
[1:07:51] thought expressed
[1:07:53] the concept of God expressed
[1:07:56] then what was the defining quality of
[1:07:59] God
[1:08:01] what is an expression
[1:08:04] that becomes this distinctive trait
[1:08:07] I I'm wanting to merely get you thinking
[1:08:13] I'm wanting you to
[1:08:16] uh
[1:08:18] wrestle with that
[1:08:20] Russell what is it
[1:08:22] that makes God who he is
[1:08:25] and if there's if there's all if there's
[1:08:27] all sorts of noise
[1:08:29] how can I filter through it to find him
[1:08:34] what's the next what's distinctive
[1:08:37] about him
[1:08:39] musicians if you'd come I'll just end
[1:08:41] here
[1:08:43] or well
[1:08:47] this will help me end
[1:08:49] God in the sermon identification and I'd
[1:08:52] recommend this one from 1964. I have
[1:08:55] some other quotes here from 63.
[1:09:00] you know I don't know if brother Phillip
[1:09:01] if that was at the Mesa Church there in
[1:09:03] January of 63 or in Phoenix but he says
[1:09:07] in the sermon identification God came
[1:09:09] down
[1:09:11] and the character of God was Christ
[1:09:14] now
[1:09:17] I'm saying a whole lot without without
[1:09:19] saying anything
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:22] God came down and the character the
[1:09:24] express image the character of God is
[1:09:26] expressed in Christ he was the
[1:09:28] reflection
[1:09:30] he was God made visible notice God made
[1:09:34] visible
[1:09:37] and he gives us John 1 1 in the
[1:09:40] beginning was God
[1:09:41] he wasn't even God then no God is an
[1:09:43] object of worship only thing he was was
[1:09:45] eternal
[1:09:46] and in him now we're going all the way
[1:09:48] back before the beginning in him we're
[1:09:50] attributes
[1:09:52] and those attributes were thoughts
[1:09:55] and those thoughts were expressed to
[1:09:58] words
[1:09:59] and words were made manifest
[1:10:02] from thought to word to flesh
[1:10:07] thought to word the flesh to expression
[1:10:10] it's all God becoming tangible
[1:10:15] Glimpse Glimpse glimpse of the Old
[1:10:17] Testament but then John says the word of
[1:10:19] life became tangible
[1:10:23] it was always elusive was no other word
[1:10:25] was no other word he had the word but
[1:10:27] then he fell
[1:10:28] was Moses the word was mostly he had the
[1:10:30] word but then he failed was David the
[1:10:32] word was that he had the word but and
[1:10:34] then you find yourself where it's
[1:10:35] elusive it just keeps slipping through
[1:10:36] our hands
[1:10:38] just when we think we found the one we
[1:10:40] just we found the evidence we found the
[1:10:42] sure thing it just slips right through
[1:10:43] our hands but Christ
[1:10:47] does God becoming tangible
[1:10:50] and you he says it's all God becoming
[1:10:52] tangible and you are a part of God
[1:10:56] and Jesus come to redeem those who were
[1:10:57] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:10:59] the foundation of the world it was in
[1:11:00] God's thoughts and that's what he come
[1:11:02] to redeem if you could those of you
[1:11:04] who've been reading uh the future home
[1:11:07] sermon this thought of being expressed
[1:11:10] is just in that repeat in there
[1:11:12] repeatedly so I was going to take it
[1:11:13] from there I chose a different direction
[1:11:15] but go there and you'll find
[1:11:17] Eternal attribute expressed is at the
[1:11:19] heart of the future home
[1:11:21] the future home of the Heavenly
[1:11:23] bridegroom and the Earthly bride they're
[1:11:26] all Eternal attributes expressed
[1:11:30] it was God's thoughts and that's when he
[1:11:32] come to redeem
[1:11:34] and them as soon as it's it strikes to
[1:11:37] them they see it because it's the light
[1:11:38] the life is in there
[1:11:40] but a life isn't there then what can
[1:11:43] they do they don't see it they'll never
[1:11:44] see it
[1:11:45] says and the whole thing is Jesus said
[1:11:47] at that day you'll know that I am in the
[1:11:50] Father the father and me I and you and
[1:11:52] you and me when the Revelation is made
[1:11:54] known
[1:11:57] yes he says the whole thing is God
[1:11:59] becoming material
[1:12:02] like a husband and wife becoming one
[1:12:04] together
[1:12:05] God and his church becoming one
[1:12:08] this is the whole thing becoming
[1:12:10] material
[1:12:12] the whole thing is God becoming material
[1:12:16] the flesh is becoming word the word was
[1:12:18] made flesh now he says invisibility the
[1:12:21] word is becoming the flesh is becoming
[1:12:23] word
[1:12:28] in Romans chapter 8 verse 29
[1:12:32] says for whom he did for no
[1:12:36] there's the Eternal thought
[1:12:38] existing before he also did predestinate
[1:12:43] to be conformed
[1:12:45] now we if you can accept it today you
[1:12:48] are an attribute of God Eternal in his
[1:12:50] heart
[1:12:52] and now you've been predestined to be
[1:12:54] conformed
[1:12:56] to
[1:12:57] the image
[1:12:59] of his son
[1:13:00] the language has been repeated through
[1:13:02] the verses that we've read the begotten
[1:13:03] of the Father the only begotten of the
[1:13:05] father but now the language has changed
[1:13:07] that there were other attributes in him
[1:13:09] and thoughts in him that were
[1:13:11] predestined to be conformed to the image
[1:13:14] the same image of the son that he might
[1:13:16] be not the only begotten but the
[1:13:19] firstborn
[1:13:21] at one time he's the only begotten but
[1:13:24] now he becomes the firstborn among many
[1:13:27] others who are likewise stamped
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:30] predestined to be conformed means we are
[1:13:33] ordained to replicate his likeness that
[1:13:36] we are ordained for him to be pressed
[1:13:39] into us and to be pressed out of us
[1:13:43] that he wants to imprint us the same way
[1:13:47] he did Jesus Christ and that God who is
[1:13:51] an image was pressed into Christ he has
[1:13:53] ordained us to be impressed to be
[1:13:56] another Express image
[1:13:59] brother Branham says the Eternal
[1:14:01] thoughts of God he says let me ask you
[1:14:02] something are the thoughts of God
[1:14:04] Eternal eternal
[1:14:06] are they
[1:14:07] are the thoughts of God Eternal he says
[1:14:09] if you can see this you'll see many
[1:14:11] things and that's quite a statement if
[1:14:14] you can see that the thoughts of God are
[1:14:16] Eternal he said then you can see many
[1:14:18] things he says God is unchangeable in
[1:14:21] both Essence and behavior in both
[1:14:24] character nature character in word and
[1:14:28] and action in word and works there's
[1:14:31] things that are essential to God and are
[1:14:34] unchanging
[1:14:36] the essence is that which something that
[1:14:38] gives you that particular character
[1:14:41] what makes something salty salty what's
[1:14:43] the fact that it's salty
[1:14:46] that's what gives it its Essence its
[1:14:48] character
[1:14:50] and it's the thoughts of God expressed
[1:14:54] God is unchangeable in his Essence and
[1:14:57] behavior
[1:14:58] therefore there is a character of God
[1:15:02] that is the manifestation of God
[1:15:06] there are other things there's other
[1:15:07] ways that God can be expressed
[1:15:10] right
[1:15:12] but then there's a way that is the
[1:15:14] character that belongs to him alone
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:19] brother Branham said God is featured
[1:15:23] in character
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:26] God is featured
[1:15:28] in character
[1:15:30] it's that symbol or imprint on one's
[1:15:33] soul
[1:15:35] it's a quality and a likeness that is
[1:15:37] him
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:40] and that's character
[1:15:42] character of God pressed
[1:15:46] there's a life that's his and his alone
[1:15:50] that's the one we want
[1:15:51] stand with me today
