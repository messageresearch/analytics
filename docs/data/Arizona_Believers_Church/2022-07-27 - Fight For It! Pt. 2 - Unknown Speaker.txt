TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Judges chapter 3:31 we are ministering last Wednesday on fight for it and the Lord um really impressed me on this subject as I was praying and and burdened it was on last week on Monday the Lord spoke to my heart this subject of fight for it and then as a companion to it we preached on the cost of war in Flagstaff and took in a complete different direction and just if the Lord would ever lead for me to minister it here I think it'd be very very fruitful um and very very beneficial to us but we preached on the other side of it and how that anytime there's a war or fight there's a there's a price that comes with it there's something given up and how that uh there's a maybe a double-edged sword to that and how we need the Lord just to come by with his grace and soften hearts that have been callous through battle and I want to continue on the subject of fight for it and when I was ministering last week even I think it was my son Elliot said dad you could have used shamgar and I was like wait slow down I took those scriptures out of my notes that's what I want to finish on maybe Wednesday so he's already he's already in the inspiration and channel so I expect some amens from my right side tonight but Judges chapter 3:31 and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the Philistines 600 men with an ox goat and he also delivered Israel it's very short verse I'll read it again and after him was shangar the son of anath which slew of the Philistines 600 men with an ox go and he also delivered Israel amen you may be seated again my title is fight for it and we're wanting to minister in such a way that would encourage you to fight the battle we took Ecclesiastes chapter 3:8 last time I just maybe have a couple scriptures and a couple statements just to catch us up and then we'll just be begin with shamgar says in Ecclesiastes chap 3:8 a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of PE peace we mentioned how that we can accept that there's times and Seasons but it's not always apparent to us when the time to fight when the time to be at peace and we see all these different um references in those first seven verses before we get to verse eight and we say yes there's a time for this there's a time for that even in terms of it being a time to laugh and a time to cry we don't know always know which the what's the appropriate moment even some people express some very odd behaviors during a time of grief and mourning and they can even begin to laugh or be a little bit more jovial and so just as human beings there can always be an awkwardness is is that appropriate is it too soon is this the right time did I wait too long is should I reach out now should I do this should I do that we can accept that there's Seasons but knowing just exactly the right time can sometimes miss us and here we were looking at the time of war and then it says a time of Peace we expressed how that there's a paradox of Faith it's the Paradox of the Christian Life that we're both fighting the good fight of faith and rested in Christ we're rested in Christ but yet we're fighting the good fight of faith and there can seem to be a little bit of a give and take there when am I resting when am I fighting and when I believe for something shouldn't I just relax and accept it and at what point do I need to fight for what I believe or take some sort of affirmative action brother bradam uh and I guess I could say to that to that extent sometimes it's not always easy to know when to fight and when to rest and so therefore we have to check what we are fighting for and we use that state M um for things that are to be are actually just escaping me now what's from you have to check what you're fighting for and this sermon Hebrews chapter 7 part one is a thinking man's filter where he says check what you're fighting for he says all wars are fought for principles now if you have a little war in church it must be the right principle you must be fighting for the right thing and each member of the church is supposed to do that so there you go each member of the church is supposed to fight but fight for the right thing and so we accept that if you have a little foreign church that means Satan will come along and cause some Strife or cause a misunderstanding and things can take place where there's a little Uprising in the church and brother saying make sure you're on the right side and and let me say this you always want to take sides with the word brother brandham even talks about the real challenge for a pastor is not take sides with any with either one because there's going to be times when people are pitted against each other and one has a claim and another one has a claim it's very important for the pastor to look at it in such a way to where he takes sides with the word and calls the sides to the to that particular place in the word find a point in common he says we must be fighting for the right thing and that's exactly what Paul tells Timothy to fight the good fight of faith in SEC 1 Timothy 6:12 fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life where unto Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses fight the good fight of faith I'm glad he says the good fight of faith that means if you're fighting the good fight of Faith you're good it's okay to fight the good fight of faith if he just said fight then maybe we would just uh as long as we're striving and fighting and get and have our Dukes up we'd be justified but says fight the good fight of faith if I could put it this way Paul is saying fight for it amen if it it pertains to eternal life it produces eternal life if it supports eternal life it's a if something that is a part of uh the calling of eternal life fight for it which we know eternal life is to live for others and so there's something that we ought to be striving for and fighting for so if there there you can even say that Paul is saying fight the good fight of Faith so there's a time to fight and when you're fighting make sure you're fighting for the right thing certain things to fight for brother Braham says in the sermon doors and door he says I like a man of vision he's referring to Abraham Lincoln I like people that's got something they're fighting for just not laying around wellever what comes Al comes along will be all right oh be up and at it and isn't that a caution to maybe our our lazy faith when well I'm just believing we're just going to accept what comes and we almost have an attitude that faith is just accepting whatever takes place and faith is just say well if I'm elect if I'm predestinated if it's supposed to be it'll be but let's think about the other side of it where foot uh Faith footsteps is possession and that there's things that you must reach out for there's things that you must strive for and Paul says I I'm putting everything behind me and I'm pressing toward the mark of the High Calling he didn't say well if I'm ordained to the prize of the high callon I guess I'll just get it he says no I press he doesn't just tell Timothy well if you've got eternal life you've always had eternal life you were never saved on any particular day and and since you can't do anything to save yourself just kind of lays around a little bit just believing you've got eternal life he says no lay hold of eternal life amen so we shouldn't just have an attitude well whatever comes along I'll just accept but we need to have something that we're fighting for and if there's uh maybe maybe it's for our young people who Envision fighting and and I think maybe what they when they think of fighting they think of what they do to each other and it is maybe a little bit with words but a lot of it is with hands right because certainly don't know what a fight is by looking at us as parents right but amongst them and the swinging and the punching and the kicking and the words and everything they and if that's the image that the young people are getting their minds of fighting fighting doesn't H is not physical but it's a perseverance it can just be a mindset it could be standing for something by the profession of faith it could be choosing not to act in a manner which expresses a doubt it could just be I I believe this is a promise I believe that I'm Healed I believe my children are going to be saved I I I believe these different things so I'm going to act in such a manner that declares I have confidence that things are going to work out amen reminds me of how brother brandham teaches us to conduct ourselves with joy in midst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass we could all say it's a fight to do that right but that's what this fight is for keeping the right attitude keeping our eyes on the right thing and he says I like people that got something they're fighting for and it's easy with things just to kind of maybe relax a little bit just accept what comes especially if we want to have a good profession and and and there's a that that that Paradox I'm talking about in my resting in my fighting I think I expressed it this way last year there's been times in my lives where I didn't know if I was numb or if it was Faith because with by faith you can accept certain things you can accept outcomes you can just accept it as it comes but there can also be a flip side where you're just numb and it doesn't you don't care anymore whatever happens happens so you want to be sure that you have that feeling you have a conviction you have an understanding and that you're fighting for something amen and that brings us to Judges chapter 3:31 I'm really hoping just to amplify these verses here it's just one verse in the whole Bible that tells us of shamgar and after him was shangar the son of aath which slew of the Philistines 600 men with an ox goe and he also delivered Israel this is what we know we know his name we know his dad we know what he did we know what he used we know what accomplished that's all we know about him and I want to maybe look at those elements tonight and build some things around it we know his name we know his father we know what he did we know what he used and what he accomplished and brother brandham expresses this about shamgar he says shamgar said I'm a Seed of Abraham and as he began to think of it and that's where it began with shamgar as he identified his rights or His blessings as the natural Seed of Abraham that there was something that impressed him about the fact that I am of this lineage naturally of Abraham and there's certain promises made to Abra certain things that Abraham did in his seed after him and there came a moment in his life where he said I have certain rights and privileges in this land and in this inheritance and that's what he began to think about in Genesis 22:17 God said to Abraham that in blessing I Will Bless thee and multiply and I'll multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and when it says the Gate of his enemies it's wanting to represent that whether it be armies whether it be councils whether it be some fortified Place whatever is representative of the enemy you shall possess the gates what anything that the enemy can use against you you shall possess the Gate of your enemy and he's thinking along these lines I'm not just a farmer I'm not just a father I'm not just a person here in L to Sea I'm not just a laborer in the valley but I've got promises I have rights this blessing is even rehearsed to Rebecca in Genesis 24 and they blessed Rebecca and said unto her Thou Art our sister be be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the Gat of those which hate them this is how the Seed of Abraham begin to think that if this is the promise that God gave Abraham this is the promise we could give to Rebecca and her seed after her that they will possess the gates of those that hate them so shamar's willingness to fight as we're maybe just kind of backing up in his mind as he begin to ponder these things it was first found in the word his will to fight was first found in some sort of promise that instigated this desire this Zeal to stand for his rights and the sermon convinced and then concerned and you'll find this theme in those few Services brother R preached on this he was concerned for his family he was convinced he was an Israelite we want to be concerned for our families we want to be concerned about things that relate to our children and our and their well-being and their spiritual their spiritual makeup and their character he's concerned of his family he's convinced he's an Israelite the first thing he had in his hand he grabbed it it was an ox goat a stick a little piece of brass on the end of it knocked them off a plow or go the ox as it went along and a thousand Philistines with armor he don't see the opposition he was concerned and he was convinced he was convinced and knew he was an Israelite he was convinced God couldn't lie he was convinced that the blessing was upon him he knew that it was a promise of God he kind of just Ratatat you know firing this off Amen brother I feel pretty religious right now he was convinced that it was God's promise just the same as acts 238 is God's promise so that just tells us whatever the mindset of shamard to look at this promise to Abraham that his seed shall possess the gates of the enemy we can look to any promise in the word of God and begin to have the same mindset that's that's something for me that's something for my family that's something for my health that's something for my mental well-being that's something for my future that's something that I can believe in to take up my AR go he was convinced that God said his seed which he was will possess the Gate of the enemy that's Faith so he grabbed the ox coat and stood out there and beat every one of them down why he was concerned and he was convinced it's what it takes sometimes to to not only be convinced but uh to be not only be to concerned but be convinced or not only just to be convinced but to be concerned there's a certain level at which we can sympathize with the message but it doesn't doesn't carry us over into that concern where we're willing to fight for it right he was concerned and he was convinced so let's look at what we know about him we know his name his name shamgar means sword it's so representative for us we know the word of God is quick and Powerful sharper than any two-edged sword we think about the very time when God is bringing the Vindication that this is the third pull it was the sword of the Lord that comes into his hand and so there's something very particular in this message of the hour about the sword the king sword and and how we're being christened with that sword and it's in it's whenever a a seal is broke with Trumper sounds there's a declaration of war so we need to have these elements of Warfare at our hand to be used in this time Commission in Ephesians 6:17 take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God we're not just dressing for a picnic we're dressing for war and we have in our hands the sword of the which is the word of God now this word there is not just logos but it's actually the Rama it's that which has been spoken the word spoken is a sword so we're not just imagining the word we're not just pretending we hear it but it's something that has been spoken to us in this hour something revealed to us and when you put it on your mouth it becomes a sword we can say as long as you're thinking about it you could be thinking about the right things L go I got the thought of go I got the word I got the word but when you put it on your mouth the is what carries the thought of the word and so it's not just thinking about the message but it's speaking the word of God it's not just thinking about the promise but it's something affirmative to show your conviction to show that you're concerned and so we have to take the sword of God which is the word of God in Romans 10:8 Paul says but what saith it the word is nigh the even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach it's really a beautiful picture that I've been studying and hoping that maybe we could take a sermon just on this thought alone how that the word is preached and as the word is preached it can be Navy it can be close to you it can then even be in your thoughts and your understanding but there comes a point to where now you begin to speak it and it's just not near and it's just not in but now it's coming out again because you become so familiar with it the word is nigh me it's been near me the message has been preached to me for decades this message is clearly affirmative and absolutely Vindicated by the end of 65 and it's been we're familiar with it there comes a time though when it's not only ni us but it's in our mouth it's that word of faith which been given to us shamgar a sword the sword that's what we have brother brandom writes in the church age book now Paul said the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went into the conscience of man and like a surgeon's kn it cut out the diseases and set captives free now there's a paradox for you surgeons don't use blunt you know don't use uh if they're going to try to get rid of something well I guess got to be careful what I say there's a surgeon amongst us but it's not just a hatchet job if you're wanting just to remove something in particular there's a Precision there's scalples there's certain tools that you use for certain things he says this sword will actually cut through thing and then can also be very very precise like a surgeon's knife to to get rid of things and set captives free he says everywhere those early Believers went and I believe you're throwback Believers I believe you're vintage Believers you're old school Believers because everywhere those Believers went they went preaching the gospel word and God confirmed that word with signs following and that's what we believe the sick were healed Devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians so if you're a believing Christian you could just put uh have God prove his word and hold God to his word by putting the word in your mouth it has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride the word is stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride I know that may stumble some people he's saying Paul had the word it came in power but in this last age it's stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride that means you ought to have more confidence today to put the message of the hour in your mouth and begin to speak it and watch God back it up as long as it just stays in an MP3 form as long as it just stays in print form as long as it just stays in your mind it can be lust but let it become the Rama which delivers the power of that word am put it in your mouth and he says oh little flock you little minority hold on to that word hold on to the word fill your heart and your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom this little flock hunted persecuted rejected despised he says hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it shamgar speaks of that sword that word that we are to fill our mouths and our hearts with so the Bible says and after him was shamgar the sword and it says the son of anoth so that's the next thing we know we know his dad and his dad is anath and that word means answer so here he is you have the answer and you have the son of the answer you have the answer and then you have the sword the sword of the answer whatever the answer is it has power behind it and so he's shamgar is the son of the answer he is the sword of that truth he is the sword of that answer brother man says God got the answer he is the answer Christ Christ is the answer to every problem we got an answer is a spoken or written reply to a question someone ask a question uh then they they have an answer to it Elizabeth we're after we were engaged she was talking about how wonder what our children going to be like and I said they'll they'll have answers to all their questions because she asked the questions and I'm always giv the answers and I said they'll also be confidently worried just that Paradox of our two personalities an answer is a a reply to a question and an answer is a correct reply so you don't want to just think about you know brother say someone who always has the right answer someone know at all someone always has something to say well to have the answer means the correct reply it means you have the solution to a problem that's a it's a correct solution even in the practice of law it can be a sworn statement you respond to something you have the answer God's got the answer he is the answer Christ is the correct reply Christ is the correct solution he is the answer to every question the solution to every problem I had I preached a sermon one time say then it was I I know the answer what's the question because Christ is the answer I think maybe it was more appropriately I know the solution what's the problem that's how we ought to feel and it's not that the problem doesn't matter but we know Christ has the answer Christ is the solution and the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says we see all these great three-fold revelation God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom coming Adam and he redeemed back to the Garden of Eden in the representation of Christ and his bride and then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise praise to be to God now by the revelation of the three-fold mystery the secret and by the personal Vindication Vindicated word by his original headp think of this I I I was when I was looking at this earlier today I was thinking just how different these things sound after those seals were opened just how permanent how absolute how clear he's speaking these things and I'm just picking out a little part of this but I think it forms a tremendous basis to what the seven still meant and why he's preaching this sermon and catch this not say well glory to God we shout hallelujah we sing that ain't it I'm a missionary I've been seven times practically over the world I've seen heathens devils and everything else dance dance and Shout I've seen all kinds of fleshly manifestations that's carnal so it's not because we shout not because we dance not because we could work up mental tantrum or get all excited but he's talking about the Vindicated word so he says but I'm talking about the headship of Christ being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question what's the devil's question in the last days with these scoffers and these mockers where is the promise of his coming everything's just the same as it's always been we have the answer to the devil's question he says amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question sh was the sword of the answer we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ has risen and has paid the price raising up the head or the body so he's raising up the body the devil can't stand it that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now isn't it amazing how enemies will come together to fight a common enemy people had would never have anything to do with each other but they find out they have a common enemy like hey you know what maybe we do have more in common than we thought well they said the the saying is the the the enemy of my enemy is my friend but then you're also to keep your friends close and your enemies closer so there's a lot of counsil we trying to figure out here Zig Ziggler help us out says there and he says the the the acumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's Hing the way he is his scheme has been uncovered by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body Glory you think I'm beside myself I'm not we got the devil's answer this is what's Vindicated him at the open of the word with this the king sword came in his hand the king sword the the sword of the Lord is the answer the Vindication of the resurrected Christ in his headship The Headstone coming to the body is the Vindication he said that the Rapture is at hand no wonder he could get excited no wonder he was told that you begin Empower to bind him death the greatest and the least I mean there was nothing that should perplex us there nothing that should cause us to be destroyed because we have the answer even to death reminds me of the a book I read many years ago I think it was called the 12 things that science doesn't understand and one of the chapters was science doesn't understand death and and there's a very long chapter on how it doesn't make sense that we would still die based upon Evolution and based upon all the other scientific principles we just don't understand death and why we die but they said we think it has something to do with how we procreate and the next chapter was on procreation or sex and science has figured out death doesn't make any sense to us but we think it has something to do with procreation it's like you think you don't think the original sin that Pro that act is what brought death and science can see all the markers and the pointers to it and we have the answer to their questions and so he says we got the devil's answer not me that liveth but Christ the word living in me so important so important we don't ever one time any get Arrogant with this I got the devil's number and I got this figured I got no it's Christ in me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is amen that's that's a mouthful what he's pointing to there not my power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer Christ is WR has paid the price for our Redemption what God in Christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in that blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed that God in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day that's that's our lot today that's our calling today that's how the son of man has been revealed today not when he gets in h just in brother bradon's flesh he said but when he gets in your flesh that's what we we have today we are the son we are the son of the answer we are Sons and Daughters of God we have the devil's answer today I'm hoping this is encouraging you for the battle so we have shamgar the sword uh the son of anath the answer what did he do the Bible says he slew 600 Philistines I don't know that we could really grasp that 600 Philistines and just to make it even harder to understand understand if he had a Gatlin gun or you know an AR-15 or something like that maybe we could understand it but it says he used an ox go shamgar the son of anoth that's all we know about him but it says he has an ox go so we could begin to extract from that he's probably was a farmer just a just a regular farmer not not one NE of garrisons not even of even part of a legion nothing to indicate that he was a soldier as a matter of fact we find later we read last time that God is actually telling that we need to teach the children of Israel war it was something they weren't taught it was something that they had forgot but he was just a regular farmer with the conviction in the word of God and he used that to slay 600 Philistines an ox coat is just a common Farmers tool nothing special it wasn't like this uh utility knife it said I know it looks just like an ox go but watch this and it turned into a flaming sword it wasn't anything about it like watch this if you point it this way it shoots bullets it's just an ox code and it was just that was the only thing he handed had in his hand that day so it was what God had put in his hand to use that day when he needed it again another sermon convinced and then concerned he says a man I think this might be the one in Tempe he said a man would fight for his family like that brother Bruna that's where your church is there in Tempe they have their Outreach in their Church there in tempy says a man would fight for his family like that under circumstances is like that what ought the Church of the Living God to fight with with the baptism shamgar had an ox Cod you've got the baptism the Holy Ghost so shamgar the son of anath slew of the Philistines 600 men with an ox goat and he's saying that here just a regular farmer who would fight for his family under circumstances like that maybe logically would' say well pick your battles Retreat you know live to live to fight another day as we might say there's 600 of them it's just you your family and some crops maybe you can make it through one more year and he says look at him under those circumstances and he fought with an ox go what ought we the Church of the Living God do who has more than an ox go but we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have the sword of the lord we have the answer to the devil's question what want we to do shamgar with an ox go you with the Holy Ghost what ought we to fight for okay kind of attitude are we to have towards the promise and what did it accomplish it says he also delivered Israel he delivered Israel this this ought to really Inspire us because you could look at a you could look at a church and all the different families represented a church and all of us are fighting battles but isn't it remarkable to think that your Victory could cause victory for the rest of the church I if if the unconfessed sins of one person in the church can cause the church to bitterly fail what about the overcoming of one member what about the faith of one member what about the perseverance of one member that could turn the tide that maybe there could be a lot of families in the church just fighting and fighting feeling like they're going to give up feel like they're going to give up and and and they're fighting 20 Philistines they're fighting 12 Philistines they're just fighting maybe a smaller crop that they're getting this year than they did before prices have plummeted I'm not getting as much on my Bitcoin trades anymore and everything really really hard and then you're over there fighting 600 Philistines and everybody's like woo they're not going to make it and you win and it gives everybody else courage to believe that everything's going to be all right says he accomplished the Deliverance of Israel the actions of one man out of a conviction and concern for his family turn the tide of a very Onslaught against a nation and we can have that kind of feeling today that if I could just hold my place along the wall if I could just fight this battle for the Lord then maybe my victory will give courage to somebody else and not just deliver my plot of land but deliver a whole assembly help us Lord to live beyond ourselves good to accomplish Deliverance for the whole nation yes because one man was convinced about the word and was willing to fight and that that's the the part that I think even when it first was quickened To Me is This Moment where all of a sudden you just kind of wake up he wait a minute I'm not putting up with this anymore maybe there's been a concussion grenade maybe Something's Happened and you're little shell shocked and your ears are ringing you're little concussed you're not sure what's happening maybe the the devil sucker punched you a little bit but now once you start getting your wits about you realiz whoa that devil he took a punch and you start saying I'm not going to put up with this anymore I'm not just going to lay around I'm not going to let the bell ring I'm not going to get to take the count no I'm I want to start fighting yes sir in Numbers chapter 25 when Israel was abiding in shom and the Bible says that the children of Israel committed whoredoms at the daughters of Moab and they joined themselves to Bel peor and the Bible says that when he joined them themselves to Bel peor that it kindled the an or the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel because of their sins God now is so angry with Israel and in he Lord told Moses take the heads of the people and hang them up before the sun Fierce anger of the Lord is going to be that the anger of the Lord may be turned away he says to slay every man who is joined to B peor and and then in this midst of this death sentence and all these people that sinned the Bible says that one of the children of Israel brought a midan itis woman in the sight of Moses in the sight of all the congregation who are Weeping before the door of the lord of the congregation so here they are all those that have been joined need to be slain and Moses is weeping the these other people are sweeping before the Lord God let it not be uh pleading to him and then some just comes along carrying a minidish woman with him going into his tent mocking God mocking his judgment and the Bible says that penhos the son of elazar saw it rose up took a javelin and he went after the man into his tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of Israel I know I just have verse 11 there but it says the plague was stayed from Israel because one man recognizing this what was taking place and recognizing the Judgment of God took up a javelin and I know it's a very you know jolting instance but he thrusts this Javelin through both the man and the woman and then God and I know you're already reading ahead of me but God takes that act and he and it says he stayed the plague from the children of Israel all by one man Moses is pleading all these children of Israel before the door weeping for the door of the congregation everyone's crying out but is anybody going to do anything about it anybody going say anything about it and it says Moses and it said and those that died in the plague were 24,000 but it's at the moment that penos steps up that it stops and then the Lord spake unto Moses saying verse 11 penos the son of elizar the son of Aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel who turned it away Pinos how why while he was zealous for my sake among them that I consume not the children of Israel in my jealousy in my rage in my jealousy I was going to consume the children of Israel but one man stood up and it was his Zeal his Zeal for my sake to be Ze zealous me to be provoked to jealous anger this is a righteous anger this is a righteous indignation it is actually from this example of penhos that you find the zealots in the children of Israel amongst the nation of Israel and you find them there in in the New Testament they were zealous for the cause of Christ and they use shamgar as their image as their leader as their example he was zealous for my sake and he took up the javelin and he thrust it through the sin and God says it's that that jealous anger and the action that it provoked that caused the Lord to stay the plague from among Israel so he finally got to a moment with penos he was tired of seeing everyone die he was tired of seeing this family fail he tired of seeing this young person go away he was tired to see his family not overcoming he was tired he finally got to a point where he was sick sick and tired enough to make a stand for the truth in the sermon God's commissioning Moses he says now shamgar said now look at here I'm not a warrior I can't fight and there's 600 men what am I going to do I can see him Pace back and forth and I love the way brother Bram dramatizes this he didn't know what to do coming closer Trump Trump trump you could hear the Philistines coming Trump Trump trump why because it just it just happened that year it happened year after year on every year the Philistines would come this is how the the tradition expresses it every year the Philistines would come and take their crops after they had plowed them planted them cultivated them watered them and brought them right to the Harvest then the Philistines after you did all the hard work would just come around and take the crops and maybe even shamgar knew it was coming and that day he heard the steps coming from a far off and he doesn't know what to do he's like this happened last year happened the year before here it comes again I'm used to this cycle I've seen this happen I I've seen it seen it done in churches I've seen it done in my family I've seen it done in my own life and maybe he's just bracing just bracing I guess I'll just have to give it up again I guess I'll just have to go through this again I'll just have to go through the cycle everybody undergoes everybody has something they go through and he's just resigning himself to lose another battle coming closer Trump trump a few minutes all of his oats will be gone all the wheat and corn would be gone everything he laid up his family would be starved everything he had done would be taken off over into that big enemy country out there given away to the enemy then the first thing you know God began to move on him thank you Lord first thing you know God began to move on him I like that he began to get angry if if some of you are prone to a temper we might as well make it a righteous one if you want a justification for getting angry we let's find the right thing to be angry at he begin to get angry we can finally start clenching our teeth my he looked around he thought oh my I'm an Israelite I'm circumcised and that's an uncircumcised Philistine coming up here I'm not a soldier I ain't got time to go out there and take some lessons and learn how to duel and how to fight but I tell you God's my God in other words get rid of all the excuses well I'm not trained and I'm not a minister and I'm not this and I'm not that I've lost too many battles ATT listen you've lost too many battles waiting to get trained time to stop and say wait a minute all those losing battles have trained me to trust train me to believe I won't make the same mistake this time and give the devil any room to win God begin to move he begin to get angry I'm not a soldier but I'm God's my God so he reached out there and got an ox code you know what an ox code is a little old thing had a brass knob on the end of it you beat the cattle through the Corral with it he reached up there and got the ox C he didn't have time to train to be some kind of a fighter the emergency was at hand he had to do it then pushed into a corner you don't have time to figure it out you don't have time to Google it you don't have time to check the sources on Wikipedia you don't have time to call this one and that one you don't have time to wrestle it out all you do is you have time to grab what's in your hand it's an emergency it's for his family he had to do it then I love that God begin to move on him it's indignation and he begin to get angry and 1st Samuel 17 it tells us the story of David when he fought Goliath and as The Story Goes David Rises up early in the morning and he's just a keeper of the sheep and Jesse commands why don't you go out and bring some uh food to your brothers dur in the battle and it said for the the Philistines in Israel had put the battle in Array Army against Army and we're and we're not quite there yet and and David had gone and when he came to the place where he was where his Brethren were he says he ran to the Army saluted his Brethren and as he talked with them there came up a champion the Philistine of gath Goliath by name out of the armies of the Philistines and spake according to the same words and David heard them earlier I think it's in verse 10 he's defying the armies of the Living God this is something he would do every day he just come out and intimidate them and yell at him and this day happened to be the day that David is bringing cheese and bread and corn to his brothers and the captains and the generals and David just this one 12-year-old 13-year-old boy who's keeping sheep I think he's maybe a little bit older than that now that I think about it I should have probably looked that up he's 12 or so when he was anointed this is later when he shows up and he comes there and he hears this boasting and they actually said they say to David when he shows up have you seen the man that has come up surely to defy Israel is he come up and verse 26 I'll just we'll skip here and David spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that kth this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God he's having a shamgar moment shamgar wait a minute these uncircumcised Philistines are going to come and take my corn take my barley take my we that I've worked hard for they've got no right to this David shows up in the battlefield and here's all all these Soldiers with armor and Spear and victories under their belt and all he's got is some cheese and corn and he shows up and he said well who is this guy that's going to defy the armies of the Living God and the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that kth him and elab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and eliab's anger was kindled against David wait what I mean David's coming up saying who is this guy that's gonna who is this guy trash talking the the army of the Living God why are we letting this guy guy Mad Dog us why are we letting him talk trash why are we letting him say these things who what what what are you going to give to the guy and I guess maybe by the question they thought maybe David was considering being the solution what will they give to the man who kills this one and his brother is angry against David he said why comest thou hither with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness I Know Thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that th mightest see the battle I love David's response here and David said what now what have I done now is there not a cause in other words as as as as I looked at this he's saying and a lot of people agree to this that he's saying why are you upset at these words is this really a reason to be mad at me what have I done do you even have a reason to be mad he's asking elab you're mad at me you really really mad at me where these really fighting words and then I I took it and turned it around a little bit is there not a cause do we not have something to fight for and it struck me here's a guy defying the army of the Living God and talking trash to the children of Israel and and a young boy comes up and says who's this guy to talk trash about us and they're not angry at the trash talker they're angry at David that's trick the devil plays on us on us quite a bit where we're not mad at the right thing we get mad at each other and not the devil we get mad at the person who's asking the right questions instead of the one who's causing the problem in other words David saying these are fighting words and you're mad at me for asking questions and so I ask us who are we fighting what are we fighting with what are we fighting for in the sermon life brother B said that way we're in a great battle and we're battling sin not one another if we're going to fight one another then Satan can sit back and just let us fight it out while we're fighting each other he doesn't have to even do anything but let's turn everything we got towards the kingdom and put our shoulders one with the other start moving upward and work for there because I don't think we got too much longer certainly not if we could do that we don't go toe-to-toe with each other we stand shoulder to shoulder if we draw swords it's against the enemy CU this is a great battle and we're battling sin we're not even battling The Sinner we're battling sin we're not fighting one another so easy in this battle and this Warfare it's one of the things I was preaching on Saturday night in the cost of War things can get so thick and you know things that you that aren't right you stand against sin that what when you're fighting for principal you you in the kind of the shock of the battle you're you're not fighting again for the principal anymore you start fighting against people that's right and it's in the thick of the battle there's Friendly Fire and there's those that are wounded in the house of friends why because the battle gets thick it gets hot you're fighting for principle and before you know it you're just fighting against people and you forgot what are we fighting for where did this all start and if you could work your way back you might find there was something in the beginning that was worth the fight but in the battle you lose you lose your focus if we're going to fight one another Satan can just sit back and let us fight it out and the sermon faith is our Victory BL re recognizes uh two daughters the Fulkerson daughters and he says God rebuke that devil that's hindering you beautiful little girls May the power that raised Jesus from the G grave cast that thing away and never bother you no more I say that on the authority of God's word you have to get angry with the devil here was a spirit AO on these two girls something afflicting them and he and he rebukes the devil and he says man it never bother you anymore I say in the authority of God's word you have to get angry with the devil God give us the victory we've got it right now this is the victory that overcomes the world even your faith come on we're not angry with one another we're angry at sin we're not angry at The Sinner we're angry with sin we're not battling each other we're battling the devil we've got to get angry with the devil he says in the sermon what is that in your hand he says just get a little mad at the Devil this is a shamgar moment just get a little mad at the Devil say you're old lion Rascal you're a liar Christ made me free I don't have to sit like this no more get out of here told the lion with him brother he hasn't got a bit of authority Jesus stripped him of every legal right he had when he died at Calvary therefore he's a bluff if he's been stripped of every legal right that he had on Calvary if he was stripped of every legal right he's just bluffing he does have the color of title he's just a squatter he says just get a little mad at the Devil we're in a great battle not battling one another should I we shouldn't be mad at each other even if you do something to make me mad I need to take a step back and realize it's not the person it's the spirit behind it that's what it is I I I can't get angry at my brother if I get angry at my brother that's a that's a distraction that gets me fighting the wrong cause because our our Warfare though we walk after the flesh we do not war after the flesh if someone sins it's not the person themselves that is the problem it's a spirit it's an influence and you actually treat it in such a way to you can save their soul I need to move forward in this but as brother brandham says that we're you got to get angry with the devil just get a little mad at the Devil that's what shamgar did finally said enough is enough time to fight for it no more excuses well I'm not trained not blaming anybody else I I could just imagine shamgar sitting there going he walked right by walked right through obadiah's field Jethro's field Joshua the 17th I mean what what's going on here anybody else want to fight these guys you didn't blame anybody else he just finally said you know what the buck stops here I I'm not going to blame it on the government for not building a bigger wall I'm not going to blame it on the generations before me that didn't do enough to drive out the Philistines I'm not going to blame it on anybody else I can't blame it on my parents I can't blame it on my grandparents I can't blame it on the Unfaithful Pastor I can't blame it on this can't blame it on that I'm GNA stop here and stop putting blame in making excuses I'm gonna look to the answer who's above it all better than it all and say oh God In This Moment right now I need your help no matter what's happened before no matter who's fall even if myself year after year after year I fell in this moment to the Philistines this is the last time I've had enough so brother brandom said shamgar had enough of it convinced and then concerned and tempy shamgar had got enough of it he said I'm convinced that he's God and I'm concerned with my family that's all it takes are you convinced tonight are you concerned in Genesis chapter 14 the Bible tells us that Abram Abram heard that his brother was taken captive I love how he calls a lot his brother he wasn't going to get by on some kind of technicality was his brother it's too too often we use this excuse well you know anything against the words my my my enemy well you still got to love them and if I haven't shared it here before I I would expect that I had in our series on who is my neighbor but one of the things God had to rebuke in my heart and correct me before I started the church is this legalistic idea that because someone doesn't see it the same way you do they're not your brother because you reason it out right well if I believe this and this is the truth and this is the revealed word and they don't believe it and you recognize that brother bandam teaches it and that Razor's Edge that this is the truth and if someone denies it or doesn't see it then how can they be my brother it it makes a lot of sense right if they haven't been born by the word and you know that there's only a birth a birth under the word of God you can make this technical distinction well that's not my brother but the eror wasn't necessarily in that they saw it differently and that was wrong the eror is that by my own confession I was saying they never could see it I said well you're my brother if you see it right and if you don't see it right you'll never see it right so I want even confess your brother instead of saying brother believing that if the same Grace quickened the word to me May it Quicken it to them and by the confession of my mouth I speak Grace over them that they too one day could come into the understanding the revelation of what God had done for me and so there's actually power in call them brother if they pastor this church they Pastor that church it why do we need to withhold the blessing it's not a blessing of of vindicating what they believe it's not the blessing of affirming that they're right but it's the blessing that as God had Grace on me may he have Grace on you too and I call you brother not because we see it the same way but because I believe in the grace of God to let us see it that was the sin of the the 10 spies when they crossed over if they would have crossed over and came back and said I can't possess it they would have been right but they said we can't and that's where they were wrong they if they would have just said hey as for me I can't do it God would have said he's right but when he said we can't and said Joshua and Caleb couldn't that's when they were wrong and when we withhold that blessing we're not only saying we're saying you can't we need to be careful Abraham saw the lot was taken the Bible says he went after him he took his trained servants pursued them unto Dan he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smoted them pursued them un hoba which is on the left hand of Damascus Abraham when when you read about Abraham how many chapters in are spent in the Book of Genesis on Abraham's military training how many are spent on on his boot camps training Men of War and how many other places do you find that he was some kind of Jedi Warrior or ninja or you know some kind of you know some special powers where he could do the things he's doing here nowhere if anything it just sounds like he got his servants who worked for him in his farming and and and with his cattle and and he says come on grab your Ox gos and grab your pruning shares your pruning Hooks and your plow shares and come on let's go the guy's just over there you know he's the one that cooks and he's just grinding he's got his mortar and pestal over there and says yeah just bring that guy's just running them after the rock and a pest what am I going to do with this don't worry you'll find a use for it they can smell the lavender from 300 yards away and they just get real slow sleepy all things work together for the good and it says he brought back verse 16 he brought back all the goods also got brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people why because he was concerned for his brother and he wasn't with just willing to let him go I think sometimes they're just too quick to let people go they start to backslide they start to wonder something happens we're just too quick to let them go you may not need to chase after them and grab them but get down on your knees before God and fight for him in prayer oh God have mercy on that family we haven't seen in a while have mercy on that brother we haven't seen while oh God go to their aid go to their defense in 2 Samuel 23: 8-12 it begins to describe David's Mighty Men says these be the M names of the Mighty Men whom David had and I'm just going to read through them and not amplify these things the T night that s sat in the seat Chief among the captains the same was adino the eite he lift up his spear again against 800 whom he slew at one time what this guy slew 800 with a spear you don't think he got angry right he wasn't sleepwalking he didn't accidentally do this and after him was elzer the son of Dodo the aite one of the three might men with David when they defied the Philistines that were gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away it's just a few guys and he arose and smot the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave Into The Sword and the Lord wrought a great victory that day he fought so hard to where he could even let go of the sword and when just all these men had left and it was just three mighty men with David and they gathered together against the Philistines and the Lord wrought a great victory that day by whose hand who fastened that hand by his own willingness to take a hold of it and use it God made sure it was fastened to it and the people returned after him only to spoil and after him was shamma the son of age the herit and the Philistines are gathered together into a troop I came across this studying about shamgar where was a piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled from among the Philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines and the Lord wrought a great Victory let us be the ones that are willing to stand in the middle of the field even if everyone else runs away stand in the Middle Field in the face of the enemy saying it's not my power it's not my idea but stand in the midst of the ground and defend it Lord I'm willing to stand it may look like it's going to cost me my life but Lord I'm willing to stand why why are you willing to fight for it this is my land This is my I promise this is life or death he stood in the midst of the ground and he defended and slew the Philistines and the Lord rought a great Victory how did he rot a great Victory because one man was willing to stand in the middle of a field of lentils I say ah lentils don't really like them anyways let's just leave he's like no this is our ground could have been Acres of Brussels sprouts have you ever roasted them with a little bit of salt fantastic stand your ground doesn't matter god-given ground is it is it worth fighting for that's where we're ending last Wednesday night if it's worth if it's worth keeping says if it's not worth fighting for it's not worth having stand in the midst of the ground and defend it and how did he def how did how did God write a great Victory because one man was willing to stand in the middle of the field we say oh well the Lord will do it the Lord will fight the battles well you there better be someone willing to step up and say the battle is the Lord's David knew the battle was the Lord's but he knew that someone had to stand against the Philistine someone had to stand and say I defy you may God have your head for speaking this way against the army of the Living God we got to fight for it that's what we need we need to fight for it this battle is unrelenting I think maybe it was Saturday I mentioned this that we have the saying you're either in a in a trial coming out of a trial or going into a trial I don't think that works anymore I think you're in a trial while you're coming out of a trial and before you come into a trial and they just all overlap right I mean there's no hard reset you're like wo this feels good right it's just like oh oh oh yeah oh oh oh oh oh no whoa and and it's just every once in a while you get a devil off of you only for another one to jump on and you know what you say oh you want some of this too you see what I did to the last guy you're probably always in one just as you come out of one and going into another you're always fighting at the end of this Leo toan age it's going to be a fight going to be a battle it's going to be hard but God promised he'd be with you may seem like you're all alone in the field of lentils but stand your ground be willing to defend this Ground God will fight your battles and r a great Victory am and the I want to use a statement I came came across one time um I keep referring to Saturday night it's not just because you're here from Flagstaff but uh I'm rejoicing what God did for you too brother Isaac but uh I used a statement that was written uh think in the old gray lady in New York Times it was in uh 1867 it was a statement about how this war has touched everything the Civil War and left nothing is it founded and and and that speaks to the cost of War but I want to just back up and P think about the war right now that moment that time of the war and this is a battle that been raging for a couple years at this moment I'm referring to as the summer of 1863 not time for another ballad but sounds poetic summer of 63 but the momentum was on the Confederate side even at this very moment that I'm referring to leading up to the Battle of Gettysburg Europe was contemplating joining the sides with the rebels and they were standing ready to join the war and completely destroy the union and because of a number of Victories the south then moved into Union territory for the first time and and they're poised to win a tremendous battle on Northern soil and in doing so Europe would join the fight against the union it would have toppled the the nation forever but it was that summer in July as these armies gathered in the uh Union chasing this way and the uh the rebels coming up from the south and then moving East and it looked as if they're going to try to March their way into DC so the Union Army comes to stand between them uh the the rebels and Washington DC and they're all zeroing in on this one spot Gettysburg and it was that battle that changed the tide of the war and the night the day that that battle started July 1st 1863 there was a private named Benedict and just hold that I'll ceue it brother John here just a moment he was of the 12 Pennsylvania reserves this is where he was from Pennsylvania fighting a war a battle for the first time on his own soil it's one thing to go down to Virginia another thing maybe to go down and to Alabama it's one thing to fight these battles in Tennessee and all these other places but now it was on his doorstep maybe it was one thing for shamgar to hear about this and to hear about that maybe it's one thing to hear about all these battles but now it was right on his territory and on July 1st 1863 and I want this to inspire you this is what he wrote in his journal there's no nonsense about us we've been in the service long enough to know that fighting is no Child's Play but we want to be led against the enemy now because we are determined to drive him out of our state or perish in the attempt this ought to inspire us he has this attitude as this Soldier he'd been in the service for for two years it wasn't like he had just joined the week before and said I didn't sign up for this I don't want to be fighting on my own soil no he had been in the he had been in the Army long enough I can say the same thing about everyone that's in this room tonight you've been in this message long enough you've been trying to serve God long enough to know that fighting is no Child's Play that we're not just playing Church we're not just coming here for a picnic there's no nonsense about us and in this Warfare that ought to be the attitude that we have there is no nonsense about us we must be engaged in this battle we've been in the message we've been in the service of the Lord long enough to know that this is no child's place no Child's Play and we want to be led against the enemy now why because we are determined to drive him out of our land out of our state out of our homes out of our lives or die fighting I'm determined to drive them out and drive them out with everything that's in me and if I've got to Die Why trying I'm going to die while fighting is that not what Peter cartright said that when he was told by God to go hold a Revival and he had one job he knew he was going to have a Revival so he showed up and what was he doing washing windows cuz that's what it was going to take to have a Revival then a bully showed up pulled the C back to show me had a gun says if you're going to have a Revival you're gonna have to whip me first you know what Peter said well then that's the next job climbed down the ladder took his coat off and said said if I got to have a Revival I got to wash windows and I got to put up chairs and now this guy shows up and says if I'm going to have a Revival I got to beat him up I didn't know I had to beat up somebody Lord but if I must ran I must fight rolled up his sleeves and beat the tar out of the guy because it was the next job as the devil came in confront of me said then that's what I got to do we want to be led against the enemy now or die fighting man I'll never forget when I was in a chapel when I went to private school probably maybe fourth or fifth grade or something and uh I remember was a a guy a few grades above me Jeff Roberts it was his brother that was a pastor of a Baptist Church in the middle of nowhere probably Independent Baptist and we were used to the southern baptist uh style of preaching there at those chapels and this guy got up there and he was on fire and he was preaching I know you've heard this before story before was the first time I ever heard it and he said he was going to fight the devil and punch him until his hands fell off kick him until his feet fell off and then bite him until his gun teeth fell off and then gum them to death that's about how we ought to feel about it that they finally do an autopsy on the devil it's like well we can see the teeth marks but it looks like he died by gumming right I'm not going to give up this is my land this is my promise remember be sure you're fighting for the right thing and if you know you're fighting for the right thing then fight for it there's no nonsense about us fight for it God bless you today let's stand I want to be led against the enemy now because I'm determined determined to fight until the end
