[5:57] brother uh Jess Joing.
[6:01] You may be seated.
[6:11] Morning.
[6:13] God bless you. Uh on behalf of our
[6:15] family, I want to thank each of you for
[6:17] attending our mother's memorial service.
[6:20] We gather with heavy hearts, yet we do
[6:23] not gather without hope. Uh we have come
[6:25] to honor, to remember, and to celebrate
[6:29] the beautiful life of our mother,
[6:31] grandmother, and friend Florblaski,
[6:35] a life that was a gift to all who knew
[6:37] her. My mother was the greatest cook I
[6:40] have known. She made the best teas.
[6:43] Everything she cooked, even if it was
[6:45] simple, tasted amazing. She collected
[6:48] friends everywhere she went because her
[6:50] heart had room for everyone.
[6:53] My mom's love had a radius that extended
[6:55] far beyond these walls. She had a
[6:57] miraculous way of making everyone feel
[7:00] like family.
[7:02] Whether you a neighbor, a friend, or
[7:05] someone she had just met, you left her
[7:07] feeling seen, heard and valued. She
[7:11] touched lives with simple acts of
[7:13] kindness. Uh first and foremost, mom was
[7:16] a servant of the Lord. Christ was the
[7:19] compass for her life. A melody in her
[7:22] heart and the foundation upon which she
[7:25] built everything. You saw it in the
[7:27] wellwarn pages of her Bible. She lived
[7:30] the scripture, well done, good and
[7:32] faithful servant.
[7:34] Her greatest desire was not for praise
[7:37] but for her but to hear her savior say
[7:41] welcome home.
[7:43] I thank God for allowing me to say
[7:46] goodbye to my mother. As my mom lay
[7:48] dying in the hospital,
[7:51] I asked her, I told her that I loved
[7:52] her, that I did not want to see her
[7:55] suffering any longer. As I was speaking
[7:57] to her, uh, I could I was uh I could see
[8:01] her eyes teer up. I asked her if she was
[8:04] ready to go be with the Lord. I know she
[8:07] didn't want to leave us, but she nodded
[8:09] that she was ready to meet her savior.
[8:12] My mother was the greatest person I have
[8:14] known.
[8:15] She was my anchor. She was the listener
[8:17] who never tired of our stories, the wise
[8:20] counselor who always seemed to have the
[8:23] right perspective.
[8:25] She showed us what unconditional love
[8:27] looks like. Uh not just by words, but by
[8:30] her countless sacrifices and her endless
[8:33] patience.
[8:35] The world feels a little dimmer, a
[8:37] little quieter without her light in it.
[8:41] But because of her faith, we do not
[8:42] grieve like those without hope. We are
[8:45] comforted by the promise that she is now
[8:47] in the presence of the Lord, free from
[8:49] pain and experiencing joy beyond our
[8:53] imagination. Uh she has entered into
[8:56] eternal life.
[8:59] Mom, your work here is done. You have
[9:01] fought the good fight. You have finished
[9:03] the race.
[9:04] You have kept the faith. You loved us
[9:07] and you loved our God. Thank you for
[9:09] everything. We will see you again on the
[9:12] other side one day with Jesus Christ our
[9:14] savior. I also would like to uh
[9:19] specially thank on behalf of my mother
[9:22] uh her pastor Caleb,
[9:25] associate pastor Tommy and Pastor
[9:31] Marte. uh for conducting her services. I
[9:36] just knowing my mom, I know she would be
[9:39] uh want me she would want me to thank
[9:43] everybody as well as everybody here in
[9:45] the congregation
[9:48] that was here today and last night.
[9:51] Thank you.
[9:57] Amen. Beautiful words. Good description

[35:43] nuestra apreciada hermana Florinda,
[35:47] puedo decir que ha sido un honor
[35:53] y un privilegio de ser el pastor de tal
[35:56] fina dama.
[35:59] Me dijeron que ciertamente
[36:01] le amaba
[36:04] y dije, "Yo ciertamente le amo a ella."
[36:09] Como escuchamos las diferentes
[36:11] historias,
[36:14] que buena cocinera.
[36:20] Ves ella enviaba alimento vez tras vez.
[36:25] ¿Cómo podríamos olvidar tanta bondad?
[36:29] ha sido parte de nuestro gozo en esta
[36:31] vida de conocer el pueblo de Dios
[36:35] y de poder pasar tiempo con ellos.
[36:40] Agradecidos con Dios por esos momentos.
[36:42] Como escuchamos anoche,
[36:45] dos hermosos, tremendos sermones.
[36:49] Escuchamos que esto no es un funeral,
[36:54] porque la palabra funeral significa
[36:55] tristeza.
[36:58] Y no hay nada entristecedor de la vida
[37:00] de un cristiano,
[37:02] pero es una celebración de la vida.
[37:05] Solo por unos momentos
[37:08] quisiera hablar
[37:10] de la bendita esperanza.
[37:14] pronto poner un subtítulo
[37:17] cuando el cordero tomó el libro.
[37:22] So tan amables,
[37:24] quiero leer una porción y luego
[37:30] primera de Tesalonicenses 4, una
[37:32] escritura muy familiar.
[37:35] Verso 13.
[37:39] Cuando lo tengan pueden decir amén.
[37:45] Lee de esta manera.
[37:49] Tampoco queremos, hermanos, que ignoréis
[37:54] acerca de los que duermen,
[37:57] para que no entristezcáis
[38:01] como otros que no tienen esperanza.
[38:05] Puede sentarse que el Señor añada
[38:08] palabra.
[38:09] Vamos a seguir leyendo el libro de Tito,
[38:14] capítulo 2, verso 11.
[38:18] Bueno ver los amigos y la familia que
[38:20] está aquí presente. Dios los bendiga a
[38:22] los que han venido.
[38:26] Gracias de parte de nosotros y de la
[38:28] familia.
[38:33] Porque la gracia de Dios que se ha
[38:35] manifestado para salvación a todos los
[38:46] enseñándonos que renunciando a la
[38:47] impiedad y a los deseos mundanos vivamos
[38:49] en este siglo sobria, justa y
[38:51] piadosamente,
[38:54] buscando la esperanza bienaventurada.
[38:57] ¿Cuántos
[38:59] a través de la vida han buscado por esa
[39:01] bendita esperanza?
[39:04] Todos deberíamos de buscar por tal
[39:05] bendición,
[39:11] la manifestación gloriosa de nuestro
[39:12] gran Dios y Salvador.
[39:15] Como dije por unos momentos,
[39:20] en esta escritura parece que Dios es una
[39:22] persona y Jesucristo otra.
[39:24] dice aquí una vez más,
[39:26] buscando por esa bendita esperanza
[39:32] y la manifestación gloriosa de nuestro
[39:34] gran Dios y Salvador Jesucristo.
[39:38] Si Dios es una persona en Jesucristo es
[39:40] otra persona,
[39:42] no hay tal cosa como una bendita
[39:44] esperanza.
[39:48] Cuando habla de la gloriosa aparición
[39:49] del gran Dios,
[39:52] entendemos que Dios es un espíritu.
[39:56] Por lo tanto, un espíritu no puede estar
[39:57] visto,
[39:59] no puede aparecer,
[40:02] no puede expresarse sin un cuerpo.
[40:05] Por lo tanto, Jesucristo
[40:08] era el mismo tabernáculo donde Dios móv.
[40:13] La Biblia dice que Dios estaba en Cristo
[40:17] reconciliando al mundo a sí mismo.
[40:19] Esta es la bendita esperanza.
[40:23] su vecino. Es la bendita esperanza.
[40:26] Tenemos una bendita esperanza.
[40:31] No estamos aquí llorando como aquellos
[40:32] que no tienen esperanza.
[40:38] Pedro 13 dice, "Bendito Dios y padre de
[40:40] nuestro Señor Jesucristo,
[40:44] que según su grande misericordia
[40:48] nos hizo renacer para una esperanza
[40:50] viva.
[40:52] No solo tenemos una esperanza
[40:55] bendita, pero una una esperanza fita.
[41:00] Vecino, tenemos una esperanza viviente
[41:02] también.
[41:04] Qué pueblo tan bendito somos.
[41:07] Cuando el mundo está en oscuridad,
[41:10] cuando el mundo está perdido,
[41:13] tenemos una bendita viva esperanza
[41:18] que nos ha nacido de nuevo en una vida
[41:20] esperanza
[41:23] por la resurrección de Jesucristo de los
[41:25] muertos,
[41:27] a una herencia
[41:29] incorruptible,
[41:31] incontaminada.
[41:34] inmarcescible,
[41:36] reservada en los cielos, para mí, para
[41:39] usted
[41:41] y para la hermana Florinda.
[41:45] Esta esperanza es bendita
[41:48] y bendita es que usted es afortunado de
[41:50] tener,
[41:52] significa que usted está muy bien y que
[41:55] es viva.
[41:59] Lo cual es que est esta esperanza
[42:01] significa que tiene vida,
[42:04] es significa que es activa, que no tiene
[42:07] fin,
[42:09] es poderosa.
[42:13] Tenemos una bendita y una esperanza
[42:15] viva.
[42:17] Una de las cosas que no podía entender
[42:20] cómo el hermano Branham diría
[42:25] que la esperanza es el enemigo más
[42:27] grande que tiene la fe.
[42:30] Yo yo luché por eso, lo creí, pero pero
[42:33] batallé con eso.
[42:37] ¿Cómo una esperanza viva bendita,
[42:40] podría ser un enemigo a la fe? no
[42:42] entendía eso.
[42:45] Pero mientras el tiempo pasa, te da uno
[42:47] cuenta
[42:49] como el hermano Branham
[42:52] no hablaba de esa esperanza.
[42:56] Estaba hablando de nuestra esperanza
[42:58] humana.
[43:01] Como humanos somos, espero que aquello
[43:02] aconte
[43:07] y espero que me sale. Y yo espero y
[43:09] espero y espero.
[43:11] Dice Mar, esa esperanza que es humana
[43:16] es el enemigo más grande que tiene la
[43:17] fe.
[43:19] puedo tener un testigo.
[43:22] Esa es la razón
[43:25] que esa esperanza es el enemigo más
[43:26] grande de la fe,
[43:30] porque esa esperanza empuja todo al
[43:32] futuro.
[43:34] Pero la fe que trae Dios
[43:37] es el ahora.
[43:40] La fe trae las promesas de Dios ahora.
[43:44] no pone nada en el futuro.
[43:48] No es como nuestra esperanza humana que
[43:49] mira al futuro,
[43:51] pero lo trae ahora.
[43:55] Es importante entender
[43:59] porque la Biblia dice que ahora la fe es
[44:01] pues la sustancia. Entonces, esta
[44:03] esperanza
[44:05] que es viva y bendita
[44:08] no es el enemigo a la fe,
[44:11] pero es el compañero de la fe.
[44:15] Obran, viven juntos.
[44:17] Por eso la Biblia dice,
[44:20] "Ahora
[44:22] entonces fe, esperanza y caridad."
[44:26] ¿Por qué esta bendita esperanza?
[44:30] es esta esperanza viva que enseña la
[44:32] escritura.
[44:34] Esta esperanza aquí simplemente
[44:35] significa
[44:37] que es nuestra garantía.
[44:42] Voy a decirlo de nuevo.
[44:45] Esta bendita, viva esperanza
[44:48] es nuestra garantía
[44:51] y algo que es garantizado
[44:54] significa que sin importar lo que pase
[44:56] va a acontecer.
[44:58] No importa que viene en contra, ya es
[45:01] una obra concluida.
[45:03] Es una obra concluida.
[45:06] Esta es nuestra confianza.
[45:10] Por eso no estamos esperando con
[45:11] esperanza humana
[45:14] que la hermana Florinda llegó a casa,
[45:18] pero nuestra esperanza es una bendita
[45:20] aseguranza
[45:22] en que tenemos confianza
[45:25] y tenemos una garantía que ella llegó a
[45:28] casa. Si puedo tener un testigo,
[45:33] no estamos esperando por nuestra
[45:35] esperanza humana que ella llegó a casa.
[45:39] Y vamos a ver si uno de estos días llegó
[45:40] o no.
[45:42] Pero tenemos una garantía que ella llegó
[45:45] a casa,
[45:48] una garantía que va a resucitar
[45:51] otra vez.
[45:53] No sé de ustedes, pero es nuestra
[45:55] garantía.
[45:58] Yo no sirvo a Dios por mi propia
[45:59] esperanza humana,
[46:02] pero le sirvo por la garantía que nos
[46:04] dio cuando pagó el precio en el Calvario
[46:08] y resucitó el tercer día. Era nuestra
[46:11] garantía,
[46:13] nuestra esperanza, nuestra confianza que
[46:16] porque él vive también vivimos nosotros.
[46:20] Es una garantía
[46:24] que aunque su tabernáculo terrenal se ha
[46:26] disuelto,
[46:29] tiene uno más excelente esperando por
[46:31] ella ahora en cual ella ha entrado.
[46:35] Ahora, eso es una garantía
[46:40] y Dios se va a parar y siempre se va a
[46:41] parar detrás de su garantía.
[46:45] Esto no es una garantía limitada.
[46:48] En vida estamos acostumbrados a
[46:50] compramos algo.
[46:52] Quisiera la garantía con esto. Sí, claro
[46:54] que sí.
[46:56] En el momento que necesitamos usar la
[46:57] garantía,
[47:00] oh, no, eso no cae bajo esta categoría.
[47:02] ¿Qué pasa?
[47:04] Que nos atoramos con un un más grande,
[47:07] Dios no nos pone otro.
[47:10] Él pagó el precio de redención.
[47:13] Él expió por nuestro pecado y nos dio
[47:16] una garantía. que nosotros como
[47:18] creyentes podemos llevar esta garantía
[47:21] al banco.
[47:23] Amén.
[47:26] ¿Por qué tenemos esta bendita esperanza?
[47:28] Digo esto,
[47:30] tenemos la bendita esperanza
[47:33] porque un día el cordero tomó el libro.
[47:39] Voy a decirlo una vez más.
[47:41] por causa que el cordero tomó el libro.
[47:44] En Juan 129
[47:48] habla de Juan viendo a Jesús
[47:51] cuando ve que Jesús se acerca, dice él,
[47:57] estas son las palabras del precursor,
[48:00] palabras que son asombrosas,
[48:03] identificando
[48:05] la garantía,
[48:07] identificando
[48:09] que el cordero de Dios ha venido a la
[48:12] tierra. Es lo que él dice. He aquí el
[48:16] cordero de Dios
[48:19] que quita el pecado del mundo.
[48:22] Somos enseñados
[48:24] que cuando leemos la escritura,
[48:27] no solo leemos y decimos, "Eso es
[48:28] hermoso." Usted tiene que poner su
[48:30] nombre allí, ¿sí o sí? Yo tengo que
[48:33] poner mi nombre allí.
[48:35] He aquí el cordero de Dios
[48:39] que quita el pecado de la hermana
[48:40] Florinda. Ahora puede decirle a su
[48:43] vecino eso. Decirle, vecino, he aquí el
[48:45] cordero de Dios
[48:47] que quita el pecado de Caleb. Ponga su
[48:50] nombre allí.
[48:52] Aquí el cordero de Dios. Y la palabra he
[48:54] aquí significa que está mirando algo,
[48:59] pero le dice, "Ponga su atención aquí.
[49:02] He aquí
[49:04] su atención
[49:07] aquel que le va a dar la bendita
[49:08] esperanza
[49:11] al que quita su pecado.
[49:13] He aquí el cordero de Dios
[49:17] quita el pecado de la vida de la hermana
[49:20] Florina.
[49:23] Por eso, agradecidos estamos en Hebreos
[49:25] capítulo 10,
[49:27] que por una ofrenda
[49:30] para siempre hizo perfectos
[49:33] aquellos que son santificados.
[49:36] Una vez yo tengo que poner mi nombre
[49:37] allí porque por una ofrenda
[49:41] ha perfeccionado para siempre a Caleb.
[49:47] Él ha perfeccionado para siempre a la
[49:49] hermana Sablas. Ahora ponga su nombre
[49:51] allí. Él ha perfeccionado por un
[49:53] sacrificio.
[49:55] Él no tiene que morir todo el tiempo,
[49:57] pero por un sacrificio
[49:59] es ya perfeccionado.
[50:02] La Biblia dice que aquellos que
[50:03] justificó
[50:05] ya ha glorificado.
[50:08] Él no hace un trabajo a medidas. Y estoy
[50:11] agradecido a Dios por eso, porque por
[50:13] una ofrenda
[50:17] ve esta mañana nuestra garantía.
[50:21] Aunque él ha pagado el precio de
[50:22] redención,
[50:26] la hermana Sablaski necesitaba ser
[50:28] reclamada.
[50:30] Aunque él ha pagado el precio de
[50:32] redención para cada uno de nosotros,
[50:35] todavía necesitamos ser reclamados.
[50:37] No sé si tiene sentido,
[50:40] pero todavía necesitamos tener clamado.
[50:44] Por eso Apocalipsis 5 es tan importante.
[50:48] Apocalipsis 5:1.
[50:53] Y vi en la mano derecha del que se
[50:54] sentaba en el trono,
[50:58] un libro escrito por dentro y por fuera,
[51:01] sellado con siete sellos.
[51:04] Hermano Branam dice esto,
[51:07] dice, "Esto es uno de los más
[51:12] grandes capítulos de todo el libro de
[51:14] Apocalipsis."
[51:16] Y el libro de Apocalipsis es nuestro
[51:18] libro.
[51:19] Si puedo tener un testo,
[51:22] el libro de Apocalipsis es mi libro
[51:26] y es uno de los capítulos más grandes de
[51:28] todo el libro de Apocalipsis,
[51:31] porque todo el misterio del libro
[51:35] estaba sellado en esos siete sellos
[51:38] que sostiene todo el misterio
[51:43] de todas las redenciones y las
[51:44] bendiciones de Dios.
[51:46] Nuestro pariente redentor.
[51:49] Toma este libro de los siete filos
[51:52] de la mano del dueño original.
[51:57] Estuvo perdido en el jardín del evento
[52:00] cuando Adán lo cantó.
[52:03] Regresó al dueño original y se quedó
[52:06] allí
[52:08] hasta que el pariente redentor
[52:10] podía venir y reclamar este libro.
[52:15] y todo su contenido.
[52:17] Gracias a Dios por eso. Adam no pudo
[52:20] cumplir esos requisitos.
[52:23] No podía cumplir los requisitos de
[52:25] redención
[52:27] porque después de que la había quitado
[52:29] se dio cuenta que lo había perdido
[52:32] y sabía que él no podía como pecador
[52:37] encontrar los requisitos.
[52:41] Él mismo necesitaba redención.
[52:44] El libro de los siete
[52:47] es el título de propiedad de nuestra
[52:49] redención
[52:51] y es el título de de propiedad para la
[52:53] vida eterna.
[52:55] Es el título de propiedad para la
[52:56] tierra.
[52:58] Es un título de propiedad abstracto,
[53:02] significando que ha sido investigado
[53:04] hasta por atrás.
[53:07] Dices como esa pequeña gota de tinta
[53:10] que fue puesta en el cloro,
[53:13] no la puede encontrar más.
[53:15] Una vez nuestros pecados
[53:18] han sido puestos en la sangre de
[53:19] Jesucristo, ni nosotros
[53:23] ni Dios puede encontrar esas cosas otra
[53:25] vez
[53:27] porque ya no existen más.
[53:30] Esta es una bendita esperanza.
[53:34] Este libro ha estado en las manos de
[53:35] Dios.
[53:38] esperando para los clamos de red.
[53:42] La humanidad necesitaba alguien que lo
[53:43] reda.
[53:45] Caleb necesitaba un pariente.
[53:48] La hermana Sablas necesitaba un pariente
[53:51] nacido de la raza humana
[53:55] porque un ángel no podía hacerlo.
[53:58] Tenía que ser un hombre nacido.
[54:00] Pero alabado sea Dios.
[54:03] que fue dada la respuesta cuando esta
[54:06] virgen produjo este niño.
[54:08] Dios a través de esta virgen produjo el
[54:11] producto,
[54:13] produjo el hijo de Dios, nuestro
[54:15] redentor.
[54:16] ¿Qué cosa es?
[54:20] Que cuando Juan ve aquel en el trono con
[54:22] el libro en su mano,
[54:25] la emoción empezó a a crecer.
[54:31] ¿Qué tan cerca?
[54:34] Cuando empezamos a ver,
[54:37] cuando empezamos a ver
[54:39] el libro, es un símbolo, entendemos,
[54:43] pero cuando vemos el libro en la mano
[54:47] y cuando Juan, tipo de la novia,
[54:51] ve el libro en la mano del dueño
[54:53] original,
[54:55] la expectativa empieza a crecer,
[54:59] se pone algo ansioso.
[55:02] Estamos cerca ahora. Este libro, este
[55:05] libro de redención es real.
[55:09] Está regresando al hombre y se está
[55:11] emocionando.
[55:13] Y les digo, nos debe de emocionar esta
[55:15] mañana
[55:17] que el cordero procede.
[55:20] Eso es lo que es tremendo,
[55:22] porque el climax empieza aarse,
[55:25] se hace más grande cuando de repente los
[55:28] ángeles reclaman. ¿Quién
[55:31] es digno de abrir el libro
[55:35] y de soltar los sellos ahí?
[55:38] ¿Quién es digno de tomar el libro?
[55:41] Yo podía ver a Juan como se sobaban las
[55:43] manos buscando y y mirando quién va a
[55:46] ser.
[55:48] Miramos quién responde a este llamado.
[55:51] Cuando de repente
[55:55] el climax se convirtió en un anticlímax.
[56:00] Predicamos de la resurrección,
[56:03] predicamos
[56:05] del rapto,
[56:07] predicamos estas cosas y creemos uno de
[56:10] estos días nos vamos a ir en el rapto.
[56:15] Pero tan emocionados como nos ponemos,
[56:19] emocionados con respecto a la
[56:20] resurrección.
[56:22] Parece que la vida es anticlimática.
[56:26] Cuando de repente vemos que fallece una
[56:28] mamá, oh, duele.
[56:32] Yo sé lo que es perder a la mamá.
[56:35] Yo sé lo que es muera al papá. Yo
[56:37] entiendo esas cosas.
[56:39] y parece anticlimático
[56:43] por lo que hemos predicado.
[56:46] Pero hay otro mundo.
[56:48] Vamos a decirlo de nuevo.
[56:50] Tenemos una bendita esperanza.
[56:53] No se les olvide la esperanza bendita
[56:55] que se nos ha dado, que se nos ha
[56:57] entregado. Aquí está Juan
[57:01] en una escena anticlimática
[57:04] porque parece que nadie responde al
[57:06] tema.
[57:08] Parece que nadie se para al frente,
[57:11] dice, "¿Quién lo va a hacer?" Nadie lo
[57:13] va a hacer.
[57:15] Todo lo que Juan podía hacer,
[57:18] no hay hombre en cielo o en tierra.
[57:22] Cuando escribe estas palabras,
[57:24] no hay hombre,
[57:26] no hombre en el cielo, ni en la tierra,
[57:30] ni bajo la tierra
[57:33] podía abrir el libro
[57:35] o mirar ahí
[57:38] y esperaba que alguien saliera
[57:42] y parecía que era una desilusión.
[57:47] Hay algo acerca de la muerte
[57:50] que nos hace pensar que Dios nos ha
[57:51] abandonado
[57:53] como criaturas de tiempos, seres
[57:56] humanos. Algo en la muerte parece que
[57:58] nos dice eso,
[58:00] pero hay algo más grande,
[58:03] algo puesto en nuestra alma [música]
[58:06] que lo trae al frente
[58:08] cuando más necesitamos,
[58:11] cuando parece que a nadie nos entiende,
[58:14] cuando nos sentimos solos y no hay nadie
[58:15] que voltear, no podemos llamar a orar.
[58:20] Ahora no podemos ir en nuestro carro, ir
[58:21] a visitar.
[58:24] climático es
[58:26] y es como se sintió Juan,
[58:28] esperando que alguien saliera
[58:31] y no vio a nadie.
[58:34] Todo lo que pudo hacer Juan
[58:36] fue sentarse ahí y llorar.
[58:41] Suena como nosotros
[58:43] sentarse ahí y llorar.
[58:47] Cuando estaba escribiendo este libro,
[58:50] dijo, "Lloré mucho."
[58:53] Verso 4.
[58:55] "Lloré mucho."
[58:57] Podemos decir eso en nuestra vida. Algo
[59:00] pasa y podemos decir lloremos.
[59:04] Porque ningún hombre fue digno
[59:07] de leer o abrir el libro o de mirarlo.
[59:12] Y es la razón.
[59:14] Mire qué tan tremendo.
[59:16] En el sexto sello dice, "Es la razón que
[59:18] Juan lloró,
[59:22] porque si nadie podría tomar este libro,
[59:25] toda la creación,
[59:27] todo se hubiese ido.
[59:33] No había bendita esperanza
[59:37] aunque Cristo hubiese muerto en la lad.
[59:39] Pero si nadie reclama el libro,
[59:42] toda la creación estaba perdida.
[59:47] No sé si entendemos esto en ocasiones.
[59:50] Si la expresión se hizo,
[59:52] pero hay un tiempo de reclamar,
[59:56] reclamar para la razón que estuvo en la
[59:59] dice, "Lloré.
[1:00:02] Si nadie toma el libro,
[1:00:04] toda la creación se va.
[1:00:08] Simplemente se va a regresar a los
[1:00:09] átomos, a las moléculas
[1:00:13] y a la vida luz cósmica,
[1:00:17] ni siquiera la creación, persona,
[1:00:20] nada más.
[1:00:22] No hubiese nada más
[1:00:27] porque Adán perdió los derechos a ese
[1:00:28] libro.
[1:00:30] Pero de repente
[1:00:35] lo que parecía anticlimático,
[1:00:39] ni podemos comprender
[1:00:42] el gozo
[1:00:44] que sentiremos
[1:00:47] cuando veamos a nuestros amados
[1:00:48] regresar,
[1:00:50] no en un cuerpo que es enfermo,
[1:00:54] o un cuerpo lleno de enfermedades
[1:00:56] o en un cuerpo que es viejo. Pero el
[1:00:58] gozo, el clímax, cuando vemos nuestros
[1:01:02] amados regresar a la escena. Qué gozo.
[1:01:08] Es lo que está aconteciendo ahora.
[1:01:12] Uno de los ancianos dijo, me dijo, dijo,
[1:01:15] "No llores, no llores. Voy a decirles
[1:01:19] ahora mismo, yo sé que usted va a
[1:01:21] llorar. Vamos a llorar. Todos vamos a
[1:01:23] llorar, pero acuérdese de estas
[1:01:26] palabras. No llore, iglesia,
[1:01:29] no llores.
[1:01:32] No llores. Si si tus abuelos, siga los
[1:01:36] pasos
[1:01:38] que ella dejó para que usted siga.
[1:01:42] Si usted ve que ella amó a Jesús, siga
[1:01:44] esos pasos en lo que ella dejó. Camine
[1:01:48] donde ella caminó. Actúe como ella. Viva
[1:01:51] como ella vivió
[1:01:53] para que usted asegúrese que pueda verla
[1:01:55] una vez más.
[1:01:57] dijo los ancianos, "No llores
[1:02:00] porque se está edificando el climax otra
[1:02:01] vez." ¿Cómo que
[1:02:05] aquí está el climax?
[1:02:07] Dijo el anciano, "He aquí. Oh, me gusta
[1:02:10] eso." ¿Por qué está mirando esta está
[1:02:13] llorando? Cuando de repente el anciano
[1:02:17] dice, "He aquí." Y cuando hace eso le
[1:02:20] muestra que algo viene. Cuando volteó a
[1:02:23] ver, ¿qué ve él? Él ve el cordero.
[1:02:28] ¿Por qué no había visto el cordero
[1:02:29] antes?
[1:02:32] dice, "Porque el cordero estaba en algún
[1:02:34] lugar en la eternidad,
[1:02:37] pero ahora procede el cordero." Y le doy
[1:02:40] gracias a Dios por esto. Capta la
[1:02:42] atención
[1:02:45] y lo pone en algo que es muy remarcable,
[1:02:48] algo que es impresionante.
[1:02:51] El león de la tribu de Judá, la raíz de
[1:02:54] David,
[1:02:56] ha prevalecido para abrir el libro y
[1:02:58] para soltar los siete sellos. Era
[1:03:03] esa bendita esperanza viva
[1:03:06] que apareció cuando más se necesitaba.
[1:03:10] Ahora nosotros tenemos una garantía
[1:03:12] porque el cordero tomó el libro y yo
[1:03:16] miré.
[1:03:18] significa
[1:03:22] es que Juan era obediente.
[1:03:25] Porque cuando la Biblia dijo, "He aquí",
[1:03:28] dice la Biblia que Juan dijo, "Él miró
[1:03:30] entonces
[1:03:33] y aquí en medio del trono y de las
[1:03:36] cuatro bestias y de los ancianos
[1:03:39] se paró el cordero."
[1:03:41] un cordero como que había sido inmolado,
[1:03:44] teniendo siete cuernos, siete ojos,
[1:03:47] que son los siete espíritus de Dios
[1:03:49] enviados a toda la tierra.
[1:03:52] Usted nunca va a ver al cordero
[1:03:55] y conocer el propósito de él en su vida,
[1:03:58] a no ser que usted sea obediente a la
[1:04:00] voz, que le dice, "He aquí."
[1:04:04] Y el verso 7 es el que me canta más. Y
[1:04:07] él vino
[1:04:09] y tomó el libro.
[1:04:14] El cordero tomó el libro.
[1:04:19] Qué gozo nos ha de traer
[1:04:22] que si no hubiese tomado el libro
[1:04:25] estabiéramos perdidos.
[1:04:27] [risas]
[1:04:27] Pero él vino y tomó el libro
[1:04:31] de la mano derecha del que se senta en
[1:04:32] el trono.
[1:04:34] El cordero tomando el libro.
[1:04:38] Ahora Cristo es el misterio de Dios
[1:04:39] revelado. Ahora vemos los sellos
[1:04:45] cuando él está en su obra meditorial
[1:04:47] allí atrás redimiendo,
[1:04:50] pero algún día él va a venir hacia el
[1:04:53] frente a tomar este libro que ha
[1:04:56] redimido
[1:04:58] y todo, no algo,
[1:05:01] sino que todo lo que está en este libro
[1:05:05] será de él,
[1:05:09] porque ese es el creyente. de
[1:05:12] las palabras en el libro y la palabra
[1:05:15] está en él.
[1:05:17] Que si usted es un creyente
[1:05:20] y ha sido expiación por usted,
[1:05:22] su nombre está en el libro y cuando él
[1:05:25] toma el libro, él lo toma a usted y a
[1:05:28] mí. Aleluya.
[1:05:30] No sé qué le causa esto a usted, pero
[1:05:32] esto me emociona a mí de saber que
[1:05:34] cuando él tomó el libro,
[1:05:37] él me tomó a mí y a usted. Y si usted es
[1:05:40] parte de la novia de Cristo,
[1:05:42] usted es una de esas palabras en el
[1:05:44] libro. ¿Qué clímax?
[1:05:48] Cuando el cordero toma el libro,
[1:05:51] es la razón, dice él.
[1:05:54] Creo que Juan estaba gritando tanto la
[1:05:56] otra noche.
[1:05:59] Él tuvo que haber visto su nombre allí.
[1:06:02] Ahí vamos.
[1:06:04] ¿Qué está detrás de esos sellos? ¿Qué
[1:06:07] está escrito en el libro?
[1:06:09] Lo que una vez era un misterio,
[1:06:12] ahora se ha dado a conocer. Voy a
[1:06:15] decirlo de nuevo. Lo que una vez era un
[1:06:17] misterio,
[1:06:19] ahora se ha dado a conocer.
[1:06:22] Nosotros somos la palabra manifestada.
[1:06:26] Ella era una palabra manifestada.
[1:06:28] Ahora, no sé si esto emociona a alguien,
[1:06:30] pero ella era una palabra manifestada
[1:06:34] que ha descendido en este cuerpo donde
[1:06:37] ella vivió manifestada,
[1:06:42] pero ella ha cumplido su propósito,
[1:06:46] su propósito aquí en la vida. Iglesia,
[1:06:50] este libro que fue tomado
[1:06:53] ya no es un libro sellado.
[1:06:57] Estoy terminando ahora.
[1:07:01] Ese libro que que el cordero tomó
[1:07:04] no está sellado más.
[1:07:07] Los siete sellos han sido han sido
[1:07:09] abiertos.
[1:07:12] Ahora es un libro abierto
[1:07:14] y nosotros somos el pueblo del libro
[1:07:17] abierto.
[1:07:20] No sé de ustedes, pero yo soy ese libro
[1:07:23] abierto.
[1:07:24] Significa que los misterios están
[1:07:26] abiertos,
[1:07:27] que los cielos están abiertos,
[1:07:30] que la revelación está abierta,
[1:07:34] nada está escondido o se ha mantenido
[1:07:36] lejos de la novia.
[1:07:39] Y cuando el cordero salga a reclamar su
[1:07:41] derecho,
[1:07:43] a reclamar lo que él ha redimido,
[1:07:45] es todo creación, la tierra
[1:07:49] y todo le pertenece a él.
[1:07:53] Lo ha redimido con su propia sangre.
[1:07:56] Y cuando viene y toma el libro, lo abre,
[1:08:00] ya Juan ya no lloró más.
[1:08:04] Oh, yo extraño a mi padre y a mi madre.
[1:08:07] los santos que se han ido, pero no lloro
[1:08:10] más por ellos.
[1:08:12] Yo lloro como humano, pero ya no lloro
[1:08:17] de tal manera porque tengo una bendita
[1:08:18] aseguranza
[1:08:20] que una día el cordero tomó el libro.
[1:08:23] Hace muchos años
[1:08:25] la hermana Florinta decía
[1:08:27] que cuando el cordero tomó el libro, la
[1:08:30] tomó a ella.
[1:08:34] Escucho que alguien dice funeral,
[1:08:37] oh, murieron de COVID
[1:08:39] o murieron de alta presión, el cáncer o
[1:08:42] lo que sea. El cáncer se lo llevó o la
[1:08:45] enfermedad se lo llevó. Y digo yo, nunca
[1:08:48] en un millón de años, porque no hay
[1:08:51] muerte, no hay que pudiera
[1:08:54] llevarse a un hijo o hija de Dios. El
[1:08:57] cordero lo tomó usted, el cordero lo
[1:09:00] tomó.
[1:09:01] Nadie puede reclamar derechos de usted.
[1:09:03] Usted es libre. Usted tiene una
[1:09:05] eternidad esperándose.
[1:09:08] La hermana Florinda tiene una eternidad
[1:09:10] ahora. Ella ya no se preocupa,
[1:09:14] no tiene que enfermarse más.
[1:09:16] Ella está ahora en un cuerpo,
[1:09:19] un cuerpo que Dios creó para ella. Dice
[1:09:22] el cordero,
[1:09:24] "No se perturbe vuestro corazón. Creed
[1:09:27] en Dios, creed también en mí."
[1:09:30] Porque en la casa de mi padre hay muchas
[1:09:32] moradas. Y si no fuese así, os hubiese
[1:09:35] dicho, cuando yo me vaya a preparar un
[1:09:39] lugar para vosotros, que donde yo esté,
[1:09:42] vosotros también tú, tú, tú también
[1:09:45] esté.
[1:09:46] ¿Qué ha preparado él? un cuerpo él ha
[1:09:49] preparado,
[1:09:51] un cuerpo que espera por cada hijo e
[1:09:53] hija de Dios que viene a él
[1:09:57] y ha sido tomado por el cordero.
[1:10:00] Estoy tan agradecido, como escuchamos
[1:10:02] ayer,
[1:10:04] que Dios permitió que nuestro profeta
[1:10:06] fuera más allá de la cortina del tiempo,
[1:10:09] porque fue allí entonces cuando se dio
[1:10:12] cuenta
[1:10:14] que el cielo no está lleno
[1:10:17] con gente en nubecitas tocando arcos,
[1:10:23] dijo, "La gente allí es natural."
[1:10:27] Es la palabra que usted, hermano
[1:10:28] Branham, dijo, "La gente allí es
[1:10:29] natural.
[1:10:31] Natural significa es que hay una
[1:10:33] naturaleza que va con él. Es lo que es.
[1:10:37] Son naturales,
[1:10:39] tienen cuerpos,
[1:10:42] no son como aquellos del infierno
[1:10:46] que son espíritus vagabundos cuerpos,
[1:10:48] pero ellos tienen cuerpos. Pueden tocar.
[1:10:55] No sé cómo se ve su cielo, pero les
[1:10:58] estoy describiendo el mío. Estoy
[1:11:00] describiendo el cielo de la hermana
[1:11:02] Florinda. Pueden tocar, pueden hablar,
[1:11:06] pueden escuchar.
[1:11:07] No solo son espíritus que flotan.
[1:11:10] Estamos agradecidos a Dios
[1:11:12] porque el profeta fue más allá la
[1:11:14] cortina del tiempo para regresar y
[1:11:16] decirnos lo que estaba allí.
[1:11:19] Agradecido con Dios estoy.
[1:11:22] Con razón nos deja con esto,
[1:11:25] porque yo conozco los pensamientos
[1:11:28] que yo pienso hacia vosotros,
[1:11:30] dice el Señor.
[1:11:33] Pensamientos de paz,
[1:11:35] no de maldad,
[1:11:37] para darles un fin esperado.
[1:11:41] En otras palabras, para darle una
[1:11:42] garantía.
[1:11:45] A eso vino este mensaje,
[1:11:47] para traernos,
[1:11:50] para restaurarnos de regreso. ¿A qué?
[1:11:55] Decimos al principio.
[1:11:58] Eso no vino a hacer,
[1:12:01] vino a restaurarnos de regreso
[1:12:06] a nuestro estado original.
[1:12:10] ¿Cuál fue el estado original de Jesús?
[1:12:12] El logos.
[1:12:16] ¿Cuál es mi estado original?
[1:12:18] ¿Cuál es su estado original? Usted
[1:12:21] relleno.
[1:12:23] Mi mi estado original era logos.
[1:12:26] Jesús dijo, "Yo vengo de Dios. Yo
[1:12:27] regreso a Dios." No es diferente de
[1:12:30] nosotros. Yo no soy nada separado de él.
[1:12:33] Yo soy parte de él. Yo vine de Dios.
[1:12:37] Y si eso el logos produjo
[1:12:41] de este
[1:12:43] logos procedió diferentes cada uno
[1:12:46] cuerpos a cada uno.
[1:12:49] Ahí está ella.
[1:12:53] Ella no está en algún lugar solo
[1:12:54] flotando.
[1:12:57] Se le ha dado una bendita esperanza.
[1:13:01] Esa fue su estado original.
[1:13:03] El tiempo ahora se ha unido con la
[1:13:07] eternidad. La mortalidad
[1:13:10] ha dado un paso en la inmortalidad.
[1:13:13] La corrupción
[1:13:16] se ha puesto en corrupción.
[1:13:18] Esa es la garantía
[1:13:21] que aceptó la hermana Florinda por fe.
[1:13:25] Y esto entonces
[1:13:28] cierra la invitación que continúa,
[1:13:31] que la garantía
[1:13:33] es al que quisiere,
[1:13:35] al que quisiere venir, venga.
[1:13:39] Dios bendiga a cada uno de ustedes.
[1:13:43] Pero que recuerden esto, si usted tiene
[1:13:46] alguna dificultad, que tenemos una
[1:13:47] bendita esperanza, una garantía,
[1:13:50] le damos gracias a Dios por causa del
[1:13:53] cordero que él tomó el libro.
[1:13:58] Dios los bendiga. Voy a continuar orando
[1:13:59] por cada uno de ustedes por su consuelo
[1:14:02] en este tiempo.
[1:14:04] [aplausos]
[1:14:20] Gloriosa será la mañana.
[1:14:41] Cuán gloriosa
[1:14:43] será la mañana
[1:14:48] cuando venga [música]

[1:16:17] yanto no habrá ni tristeza [música] ni
[1:16:22] dolor, porque entonces Jesús es rey de
[1:16:27] gloria,

[1:16:38] fiel y verdadero
[1:16:42] y también [música]
[1:16:44] el obrero del valor.
[1:16:48] Y la [música] iglesia, la esposa del
[1:16:52] cordero
[1:16:55] estará en los brazos del Señor. Amén.
[1:17:01] No habrá necesidad
[1:17:04] de la luz de [música] resplandor y el
[1:17:08] exará su luz ni tampoco [música]
[1:17:12] su calor.
[1:17:14] Ahío no habrá ni tristeza ni dolor.
[1:17:19] Amén. Porque entonces [música] Jesús el

[1:17:33] habrá [música] necesidad
[1:17:36] de la luz elor,
[1:17:39] ni [música] el sol dará su luz, ni
[1:17:42] tampoco su calor.

[1:17:51] [música] porque entonces Jesús el rey de
[1:17:55] gloria,
[1:17:58] para siempre [música]
[1:18:00] será consolador.
[1:18:09] [música]
[1:18:20] En este tiempo nos vamos a despedir
[1:18:27] directamente en cuanto acaba el
[1:18:29] servicio.
[1:18:33] Vamos a ir al cementerio
[1:18:39] si no tienes el domicilio es 760 sur
[1:18:44] compreso
[1:18:47] road
[1:18:49] en en las cruces
[1:18:53] en cuanto se acabe el servicio vamos a
[1:18:54] ir directamente para allá
[1:18:58] mientras que vamos a ser despedidos.
[1:19:03] Vamos a despedir la iglesia primero
[1:19:07] y luego el ministerio
[1:19:10] y luego vamos a seguir con el cuerpo
[1:19:17] y después de eso la familia familia
[1:19:26] y los diáconos van a estar despidiendo
[1:19:28] si pueden seguir la guianza de ellos.
[1:19:31] Así se ponemos de pie
[1:19:36] y vamos a terminar esta celebración con
[1:19:38] una palabra de oración.
[1:19:42] Inclinemos nuestro rostro.
[1:19:45] Padre, te damos gracias
[1:19:50] para permitirnos estar en este lugar
[1:19:55] para celebrar una vida, Señor.

[1:20:05] muchas palabras de esfuerzo
[1:20:10] y estamos confiando que los corazones de

[1:20:25] lugar,
[1:20:27] nunca de tu presencia,
[1:20:29] que vayas con
[1:20:33] y sigue siendo el centro, Señor.
[1:20:36] Sea nuestra paz, nuestro gozo, nuestro
[1:20:40] consuelo,
[1:20:42] especialmente en este tiempo de
[1:20:44] necesidad.
[1:20:45] Te damos gracias, Señor,
[1:20:49] que tuvimos tan gran ejemplo para mirar,
