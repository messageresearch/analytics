[Music] this afternoon man the children excited excited for God's Word I didn't dress up fancy today I just came normal I want to scare anybody but I mean I've had a hard week yeah which ladies hard week it's tough isn't it I had a hard week myself and that's kind of what brought me to this topic because there was things that I was trying to do different things that I was trying to do during the week trying to get things done and working on different things and everywhere I turned I got the door slammed in my face it's kind of weird huh strange you know I try to do something here and door got shut try it another thing in a door got shut so I'm gonna speak a little bit on temptation how many know what temptation is right what is temptation brother uh-huh there we'll attempt you to do something really bad huh our tries to anyway right but how many know what this is right here what is it it's a doorknob right it's got a door it's got a handle inside and out it's got a lock on it right so when you put the when you put these things together this thing in the middle right here this is what keeps the door from opening and closing right so when you put this on the door and it's functioning correctly and the doors closed they can't open by itself right doors though doors don't open by accident yes or no right unless you don't close it all the way right you know sometimes I be sitting in the house and all of a sudden the door just blows wide open right away so oh yeah somebody wants to come in Oh sometimes we just don't close the door all the way you know that and that and that's what led me to this thought is temptation because Jesus was tempted right did Jesus get tempted you go to the scripture Matthew 4:1 right who wants to read that for me Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 go right ahead brother when then when Jesus then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil so Jesus was tempted right so we we shouldn't be no different yes right the devil will tempt you guys all the time right that's why I said think you got you got this door knob opens and closes it even has a lock right so how many young kids here have done something wrong right I guess we're all young kids huh I continue to do wrong to sometimes but how many have done wrong okay and was it ever your fault of course not right I don't know maybe some yeah but I know when I was growing up with my brothers and sisters and something bad happened it wasn't my fault right we always wanted to blame somebody else and that's kind of the way the world is today nobody wants to take responsibility for their actions I did it I did something wrong I remember I beat up my brother at one time you know he was bloody nose and I act I don't know Mom the dog must have did it that's what I said I didn't why I was afraid to get in trouble but every every time we get in trouble we always wanted to blame somebody else yes or no we didn't we didn't want to take responsibility but that's why this door knob goes to a door and when temptation comes you got to shut that door right you got to shut it and then of course we choose if we want to open it or not right because doors don't open accidentally so the devil comes we got to shut that door and we got to close it because he's not afraid to shut the door on us when we're trying to do something right when you're trying to do good the devil will come in he'll try and shut the door on you right he's Trey he's tried on me so what what's what's different between you and I this afternoon there's no difference which we choose what doors to open and close because temptation has many doors there's many doors of temptation you know of course you guys are younger you know and I'm sure your parents ask you will you take out the trash right and what is our first reaction right I don't want to right how come you forgot to take out the trash I don't know it wasn't my fault I started to play next box there's a temptation right there yes his xbox plain plain Xbox is it bad not necessarily but if you're on it all day long and you're forgetting to do what you're supposed to do then the devil's got you he tempted you and he got you and so you opened that door to that but the next time he comes you shut that door right in his face you slammed the door in his face and you locked it and you don't open it that's what the doorknob does he when you when you when you have it this is locked right now it's not gonna open you don't lock it Oh broke it I guess but see this thing right here this is what opens and closes the door this little latch right here when it's it when it pull back in the door the doors gonna open but when this isn't the thing the door don't open so it can open by accident we got to open it I gotta open it so when the devil comes and he says talk back to your parents slam it in his face shut her in his face because Jesus were tempted many times right because it says if you if you read more in in in the scripture if you read on down it says he took him he was hungry right when the devil took him up when he went up into the mountains in the devil's temper he got hungry yes and what did the devil tell him what do you tell him turn in turn these stones into bread right and see whenever you're tempted there's a way to fight the devil how many know the best way to fight the devil the Bible you use God's word against him right you use God's word against the devil and that's what Jesus did here because what did he say to him anybody and shall not live by bread alone right he uses he used God's Word and that's what we need to do the devil comes and we gotta use God's Word to defeat the devil we gotta use God's Word to close that door stop him in his tracks don't let him get any farther because he'll tempt and tempt and tempt and what he's trying to do he's trying to distract us when he's tempting you he's trying to distract you he's trying to to keep you from realizing the young ladies you should be and the young men you should be because the devil don't care how old we are he don't he'll try and defeat you any way he can but we got the greatest word what does brother Branham say God's word is he says drop that atomic bomb on him right drop that atomic word of God on Satan and it will stop every temptation we have every temptation because it's going to come even even right now guys I'm sure you guys had different temptations right the devil has tempted you in many ways right how many go to school getting ready to start school aren't we right maybe sometimes you want to act up a little bit in class why are you laughing at me how are you laughing at me something sometimes we do how we want to act up in class and that's not good because when we get in trouble see that's a temptation right there talking back to the teachers that's not good huh that should be what respectable you got to be respectable that's what he was trying to say you got to be respectable right we got it we got to start young better start even as we get older we got to be respectable I tell you what when I went to school I was a horrible kid I was III I was horrible I was bad I talked back I didn't listen I say words that I shouldn't say right because that's the temptation when you're in school with our friends right we want to be cool right Bryn Jonathan one we wanted to be cool I wanted to be cool so then I start saying things that shouldn't be saying started saying things I shouldn't be saying and I tell you an experience I had I got home from school one day and I didn't realize my mom had had a parent-teacher conference with the principal well next thing you know I got home I got so put in my mouth that's not a good feeling see but that's why we got to close every single door every single door to temptation err single door to the devil because there are many doors out there you know he's gonna want you to talk back he's gonna want you to do to do different things not listen to your parents and then as you get older things getting even worse and then she get older than that things will get even worse but if we stop it if we shut that door shut the door close it in his face and say you are not welcome here you kick him out shut the door don't let him back in he's the only way he gets in is if we let him that's the only way he's coming back in right because if he fought him if you read from from from Mark Matthew for 1 through 10 he tempted him that whole time right he told him bow to me he says take a look at all this this could be yours if you bow to me he fought him with God's Word right and that's what you and I have to do we have to fight him with God's Word we have to we have to close the door in his face we have to listen to our parents we have to listen to the word we have to read God's Word because if we don't read God's Word or read the Bible then how are we gonna know not to fight him right right we got we gotta we gotta read gotta hear his word he attention to his word close the door in his face because he doesn't stop how many are children of God this afternoon right every single one of your hands should go up we are all children of God even to even to this day he's still trying to stop me to realize Who I am because he don't like that and that's what he's starting he's gonna start if he hasn't started already he's gonna try and stop you from realizing the young men and young women and young ladies that you should be right because there is in the end there is consequences to our actions there is consequences to our actions I did something and there was a consequence that I had to pay but I opened the door to that now I got it now when she opened the door it's your responsibility to shut it when I just said it you gotta clean him out but not once you clean it out you got to fill it up with something right you got to fill it up with something watching we fill it up with the Word of God they fill it up with a Word of God don't leave it empty because if you leave it empty what is he gonna do he's gonna peek in the window said oh he cleaned it out but they didn't put nothing back in it that's my spot right there that's my bedroom he's gonna say I want him I want back in and he's gonna knock but don't open it don't don't open the door to the to to the devil don't open the door to their patients because there is many many out there many many things out there many many bad things and and as I as I get ready to close I would like to say something here you know there was a terrible thing that happened yesterday okay and a lot of a lot of it happened to young kids your age now they saw some things that maybe they shouldn't have think but how many would do me a favor when you go to bed tonight will you pray for those young children you know because they saw some bad things that nobody should ever see well pray for them but also pray for them but pray for one another pray for pray for one another that the hand of God will always be in our lives wherever we go like we're starting school again right this coming week pray everyday pray everyday for one another that that no temptation comes in school right because how many like to have fun in school I do I do but you can have fun but you can have some good clean fun right don't let the influences get you don't let the bad thoughts get you don't let the the that going with the crowd get to you shut the door shut the door close the door don't open it don't welcome the devil to those things to that right is it hard how many how many thinks it's hard to resist the devil I think it can be it can be pretty tough it can be pretty tough right but if you read first Corinthians 10:13 who can read that for me anybody want to read that for me first Corinthians 10:13 for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the 1st Corinthians 10:13 there in 2nd Corinthians there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it right he made it a way of escape during temptation that's how we fight the devil with God's Word God's Word is good right right it's God good god is good all the time God is very good all the time has he done good things for you yeah has he done good things for you yeah what has he done for you takes care of you when you're sick man anybody else and we else what has God done for you what he's done for you giving you what you need right it takes care of us right nobody else what he done for you protects us from anything evil amen right because there is a lot of you will out there he protects from evil yeah if you're scared he'll be right there with you he stands right be he's right there with you right now he's right by every single one of us right now right right because we didn't come to church by ourselves right oh who did we come with yeah he did some with our parents right but who else is with us Jesus is with us Jesus is here right first yeah I'm true your parents you can't dry it you can't drive right oh yeah see you got any parents so your parent you got to come with your parents but you also bring Jesus with you right because the devil's always around too so you always got to have Jesus wear your heart down in your heart right so just remember shut the door don't open it cuz it won't open by accident it can only open as if you and I open it shut the door kick him out say you're not welcome here get out get out of my face leave me alone get behind me and don't bother me right and remember as we as we start school pray for one another pray for pray for one another because it's it's it's tough tell you what it's a lot tougher now to go to school than when I went to school
