[13:20] [Music]
[13:30] on the last Mays guns
[13:34] though the
[13:36] [Music]
[13:43] we do have a special this evening our
[13:46] sister Lana um as a poem for us
[14:00] god bless you and forgive me I didn't
[14:03] put my readers in my purse
[14:05] and these have readers and I'm not
[14:07] trying to be cool okay and I also had
[14:13] requested a short testimony and brother
[14:18] Branham says that will pay for our
[14:21] neglection he said you neglect to
[14:24] testify of the glory of God
[14:26] neglect to give God the praise and glory
[14:28] you'll find yourself cold formal and
[14:33] backslidden and I want to give this
[14:38] testimony of for the past 14 years I've
[14:42] been seeing a Rheumatologist for a very
[14:45] painful dangerous potentially dangerous
[14:49] arthritis condition and the treatment
[14:52] was very potent expensive weekly shots
[14:56] and it controlled the help control the
[15:01] pain and the the inflammation in my body
[15:03] and during these visits they would all
[15:07] check my blood and check my arm PRC
[15:11] level which is the level of inflammation
[15:13] in your body and for the past 14 years
[15:17] the the rate in my body was so high that
[15:23] it these shots had were to lower my
[15:28] immune system and so that it would it
[15:32] would you know help control the disease
[15:37] well I didn't write it down but I'll get
[15:44] it but anyway on the last visit oh I had
[15:50] been told by a few doctors I did my best
[15:54] of count was 5 doctors that I was at
[15:58] very high risk for a heart attack and
[16:00] that one doctor even told me I was a
[16:02] walking heart attack and so this last
[16:06] visit which was this past Monday I was
[16:09] there and he was reading my bloodwork
[16:12] and he said I don't know
[16:14] what's happened or I can't I don't know
[16:16] why he said but for the first time in
[16:20] all this time he said your CRP rate is
[16:25] normal and at the at the time he told me
[16:31] that I was I was feeling pain in my
[16:34] chest but you know what I
[16:37] I believe what the Prophet said and
[16:39] science has even proved it now that a
[16:42] disease can leave your body and these
[16:45] memories sales can tell your brain it's
[16:48] still there you know but today I stand
[16:50] before you with no pain whatsoever in my
[16:53] body I give all the honor and the glory
[16:56] and I testify to his goodness and his
[17:00] mercy and His grace another time thank
[17:03] you and I do have a poem that this
[17:05] morning I was just I was praying and the
[17:09] first to the poem is the the prayer that
[17:12] I was praying to the Lord and then I
[17:14] just got my pen and paper and started
[17:15] writing and I hope it's a blessing
[17:30] surely today Lord I want to thank you
[17:33] for Calvary but you're suffering did not
[17:37] just begin that day but it started when
[17:40] you were born
[17:41] wrapped in humanity accused since birth
[17:46] of being illegitimately born being
[17:50] scoffed for claiming a heavenly father
[17:52] and all the rumors humiliation and false
[17:57] accusations you suffered in the years
[18:00] that followed though we don't know much
[18:04] about your childhood how we wish we
[18:07] could take a closer look but it was not
[18:11] recorded since you never wrote a book
[18:15] perhaps it would have said how you were
[18:19] teased because maybe you acted a little
[18:22] strange the other children may have
[18:25] mocked you because you wouldn't play
[18:28] some of their games did your siblings
[18:32] overlook you out of envy and make you
[18:35] feel left out
[18:37] because your mother was probably very
[18:39] protective of you no doubt I imagine you
[18:45] were very proper and obedient your
[18:48] nature very humble and meek some may
[18:52] have thought you were a little slow
[19:00] because you would think before you would
[19:02] speak so many things you must have
[19:06] suffered because you were the son of God
[19:10] though you were not born privileged you
[19:14] were born well-equipped to do the job by
[19:18] the age of 12 you confounded the wise
[19:21] and well-versed but you were the Word
[19:25] made flesh and even corrected your
[19:27] mother when before them she denied your
[19:30] birth perhaps as a carpenter stepson you
[19:37] may have been assigned the harder work
[19:39] to be done I don't believe you would
[19:42] have complained
[19:44] or have shown a bad attitude but you may
[19:48] have slipped away and shed lonely tears
[19:51] no one knew but you as you grew older
[19:56] your trials and tests could have only
[20:00] become rougher because the word declares
[20:03] even you learned obedience through the
[20:05] things you suffered not protecting in
[20:09] the normal things that me and your age
[20:11] would do you were preparing for the
[20:14] greatest trial of all the purpose you
[20:18] were born to see it through you the
[20:26] master diamond would soon get the final
[20:30] cut for years you had been shaved and
[20:34] cut for us there's a part each diamond
[20:38] has to lose to make it Sparkle in direct
[20:42] light it will show the rainbow colors
[20:45] and produce fire when hailed just right
[20:50] now each of those colors represents
[20:53] gifts but only if by Christ that diamond
[20:58] is lit he was the one who was wounded
[21:02] and bruised and hid that he might
[21:05] reflect himself back to the whole world
[21:08] but God needs something in his hand to
[21:11] make something with the logos the great
[21:17] fountain the master diamond chose us in
[21:21] his plan and we are that something in he
[21:25] needs in his hand to reflect his light
[21:29] shades of green blue emerald and red to
[21:35] prove his alive today that he is not
[21:37] dead that his life and all his
[21:41] sufferings from birth to Calvary was not
[21:45] in vain but he rides this trail again
[21:48] giving and living through you and me
[22:00] amen
[22:01] may God bless her sister if you could
[22:05] please stand
[22:07] we're gonna be receiving our Minister
