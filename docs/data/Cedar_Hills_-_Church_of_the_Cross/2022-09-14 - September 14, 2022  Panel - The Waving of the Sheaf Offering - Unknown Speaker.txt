son brother Omar and brother Jimmy brother Jimmy and I we just recorded for at for Africa at about 4 15 this afternoon we recorded a a a a message so we're grateful to the Lord for that brother brother Omar what are we what are we talking about tonight we're speaking on the waving of the Sheaf we are speaking upon the waving of the sheep and so I'd like to to to start off it might be a scripture that that you will not that you might not think it is appropriate but I think it is a most appropriate at this point in the book of Saint John chapter 12. and verse 32 is and the scripture says it like this and I pray we got about an hour and 15. we will Lark ourselves and lock and loaded into to this program and I don't know about you but this has been a lot of fun for me I think learn more more than than maybe you've learned but I sure appreciate them and uh the scripture tells us in Saint John 12 and verse 32. and if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me another translation is is this when I am lifted from the earth I will draw all men unto me we take away the if about it so this is the the waving of the chief offering and to start this brother brother brother Jacob go ahead and and give us a give us a start off yeah God bless you all tonight in every scripture that we need to read tonight let it be for the honor and Glory our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ well I got the portion what is the chief and before I get into that it is an honor Anthony to sit amongst these Great Men of God Hombres de dios man of God Hombres de dios that are carrying the seed question and preaching the unadulterated word of God powerful suit is an honor privilege and to be in your midst medius foreign according to what fish dictionary brother a question a dictionary Webster a chief is a quantity of the stocks and ears of cereal grass or sometimes other plant materials material and you know what brother they have to be bound together be bound together amen there it is amen amen so thank God for Hobby Lobby amen praise God hello serious I have friends that are farmers asking and making calls foreign happy love It's gotta have something yeah Hobby Lobby and you know why I chose this red ribbon to bond them together you know why I feel comfortable standing up because you stand up sometimes during the pedals right yeah yeah man you get excited no no I said I get too crazy we're having a conversation here absolutely absolutely you're gonna be part of the conversation with us man and I chose a red ribbon yes represents the blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ this one does not have the roots and the chief now we go to the Book of Leviticus chapter 23 verse 10. write it down write it down Leviticus chapter 23 verse 10. yes and the word of God reads in this manner speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when ye become into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest yes the one they had to present is foreign because of their work that's right that's right and I was thinking foreign amen are we spiritual Israelites praise God so and I was also thinking sometimes the simple movements even when they had to pick up the showbread a simple motion a simple move is important he had to handle it with care conquidado not be careless and just no set of these no no no no you have to wave it no no oh before the Lord oh he had to wave it before the Lord and what is Pastor he's waving today yes [Applause] amen amen it's a delicate job absolutely amen praise God and we go to uh brother branham's message it is the rising of the Sun paragraphs 87 mistaken he preached this message April of 1965 Easter Sunday and and the first day of the week first of the week April 1965. I was two months old and this man yes this Prophet yes wow 65 is a good year it's a good year that's right I was born in 65. yeah it's a very good year it's a very good year remember that it's a very good year praise God so we go to the rising of the sun almost the prophet Philadelphia program 87 and 88 days Jesus Christ amen he is the chief he is the first of the seed of those that slept waved on the first day the way the pre-made birthday of the week is Sunday Domingo you said you're gonna be part of the conversation we're waiting for the answer Sunday amen thank you the first day of the week primary amen glory be to God you're too serious look at somebody and say Sunday did you get that s-o-n-d-a-y Domingos to s o n a aliho right lift it up amen and praise God Jesus Christ the first of the seeds and the simple move of this of the street that was lifted up that the priest would lift up movement it was already simply it was a type knows about the types we know what a type is right praise God and if I be lifted up now we're gonna we're gonna take again the the word or the the word if out there and just just say it like this when I am lifted up all right this is sometimes the the characteristics of who do people in the message claim to be yes they would tell brother Branham that you that that he made too much of Jesus and brother Brandon would say I can't say enough about him and that's the same Quest that's the same thing that happens to us yes say too much about brother Branham no no no Jesus said Jesus I am lifted up and so when you come come into the the land as brother brother brother brother Jacob was telling us when you come into your land you come into what you're actually coming into is you're coming into your position that's why our pastor always he would tell us this is Lie by yourself but if you don't want to fly far because fly together that's the chief that's the stacking of the Gathering of the sheep it was that she was the quantity of stocks according to history how many stocks in each year this is this is the the numerology in scripture does not get lost there's there's seven Church ages there's seven messages there's all the numerology in God you cannot get away from it first day of the week only convocation that's the first day of the week but I want you to notice they would gather it in three all the way to eight and they would gather it in a way that would form a pyramid in order to be able to shelter the the the the grain from The rain that's why it's so important as our founding Pastor said foreign position that I have given unto you now you speak to the children of Israel that when you get to this certain place is the place God has chosen he lays his name there that name yeah Jesus when you get to this certain place that I promised you I take you when you get in there in this land it's a spiritual it's a natural land but the natural there is typifying the spirituals shall reap the Harvest you've never seen Harvest like what's happening right now doing in the continent of Africa wherever we have been able to go by God's grace is possession every every place and shall reap the Harvest thereof because then you shall bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priests and he shall wave the Sheep before the Lord and you raise your hand move your hands that is the position this is why we tell we we must understand it's not just picking up some sheaves and waving it even though that is the natural but when he picks up your life yeah I was down I was without God or his son I don't know where you were at but he reached when I am lifted up I'll draw all men unto me that is the position is in the land that I have chosen to place my name there is tell us something about what God has told you so when I was looking into this I I began to I began to think about Peter how Satan desires to sift him as wheat look at this um so as we see as a wheat grows we see that it has a stock it has a tassel it has the shock and then it has the seed we see that that in here we we find the three stages of Grace we find how how the life how it comes up through the roots brother Ernie you'll know that this diagram came from the great Apostle brother Bernie Garcia is so we see how it goes through justification sanctification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost but as as I began to read this you find that each piece of the Hui is so important because it gives nutrients to the seed as the seed is b as being pushed forward we see that as it comes and it Springs all the way to the top my name is seven leaves that have protected it the whole way through find seven Church ages seven Messengers but then it comes a time when all of a sudden it's called maturing time wow the first time happens and all of a sudden these please begin to fold away it doesn't mean that that seed is already ready mature but it shows that it's ripe it shows it shows that that it's a it's got a lot of moisture on it right now now it's got to get dried out a little bit and here's where we find this this story and and what shocked me about this you look at me is that Jesus is Jesus Jesus is saying in in Luke 22 31 again you know he never goes and and says he had already called him when he when when he called him to come and follow him he said your name will no longer become Simon it's going to be called Peter we all know that Peter means the rock we all understand that but Simon Simon Simon Simone means a reef significa a type of grass that is easily blown in the wind Peter I know your weakness your nature is that you can be blown away with anything but don't be afraid because I have prayed for these and a lot of times as individuals We Begin our spiritual walk with the Lord it takes a lot of things that you have to go through to build up to the maturity of where God needs you to be yeah we see that that that God his goals and we want comfort and we want blessings he wants to grow you and give you maturity so in this maturity stages all of a sudden Peter gets sifted through his doubt the repente Pedro he denies the Lord he begins to deny him he begins to do all these terrible things and yet and yet Peter is Walking with the Lord the whole time when Peter became mature that day was the day that you hear Brother Tommy speak about yes good up on the day of Pentecost and I want you to know that Pentecost one of the meetings is 50. it was the Year of Jubilee just preparing him for the day of his adoption and he says repent every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a powerful Mighty rushing wind came through and little licks of fire came from this big ball of fire each and every person that's the maturing part of the grain is brother Jacob tell us some more foreign could today be Korea always said someone's Jubilee and who we love the Elgin oh say say that God could today say it again again could today be someone's Jubilee is Christ he's still setting people free he's in the business of setting people free if you haven't been lifted up like he has been lifted today's the day of salvation today's the day of salvation in church brother Hector oh yes today is the day of salvation don't leave for tomorrow for tomorrow what you can do today what a shock chokey [Laughter] I would have loved to be there yeah you know what brothers tell me tell me yeah he said say it I want to mention my wife okay well yeah Esposa her soul is under the altar with my parents Miss Padres she thought it was crazy and my kids thought I was crazy and I will say this because you know what I want to touch lightning and I wish I would have been there to fill that stock during the storm I like to sit on the porch and the Thunder and the lightning I just lost do you want to reach out and touch Christ tonight you suck your life you gotta just feel the presence of the Lord here on this platform and during the messages that your brothers share their answers and I didn't have to put a fork in an outlet the message right here and they can do this thing for you and I listen what a symbol brother brother Jacob the the chief with the this this uh this ribbon this red ribbon symbolizing the blood of Jesus Jesus thank you brother that that that's awesome you know it's it's uh when you when you when you hear Brother Branham on the on the on on on the position when you hear when you hear the prophet of God say this bless us now as we approach the word and father thou knowest the reason that I'm approaching the word from this very scripture here this is It's because that I feel that you want me to do it this way that it's your Divine will okay it's in your order is it's in it's in the it's the order of the day let's to let the people positionally foreign to you not long ago oh you have trained us so long Lord now father Our Father give us our ranks put us out there to what we're supposed to do so we can be about the father's business or we ask it in Jesus name thy son amen Jesus it is it is I I'm I'm I'm I'm listening to our pastor is and and what a message the series that he started with where do I where do you stand when he spoke on the week before of of maturity brother Jacob I found out I found myself and he said do you do this do you do that do you do this is I I failed in almost every box failing failing failure and a person says Where Do We Go From Here well sometimes if you're at the bottom I'm gonna visit you the only way to go is but I felt the responsibility because it is the challenge of the hour it's not even the challenge of the day no more it is the challenge of the hours and when I found myself that I was weak in all these areas did God want me to do he wanted me to go and challenge be challenged to go and to know what the next step is when you go under justification sanctification crucification scientification and you stopped there you said that sheath cannot be waived it's a it's a second because you've stopped it cannot be waved over when you come and under under the baptism of the Holy Ghost and these three processes produces a new birth things got to happen we know by the message of the hours the next step is add to your faith virtue is we know what to do we know what's required of us that's why that's why when when Paul comes to the upper coast of Ephesus foreign [Music] foreign in the local church in La Iglesia local let's go back to Leviticus 23. uh verse 10. I want you to notice four or five things here okay and all you young men that have your notebooks [Music] you know what you know what that means every time you say it in the scriptures significant time the empo is the time that's right wow means the message will even teach you how to read your Bible we've said all these things and now we want to break it down all the way to you how does this relate first thing he wasn't gonna write nothing to the children of Israel he was going to speak unto the children notice that it was a spoken word it wasn't a written word but then that spoken word that was spoken would be written now the question is or is it being written anybody wanna the young people where is he writing that word that was spoken again put your hand on your heart he's writing it inside of you because we already heard about coming to the land that I will give you in Toronto but I'm going to bring that down to the individual [Applause] remember we already know but God had a place he chose to put his name right yes but you see so many vagabonds here's the expression the way I'm gonna say it among the message and I'm not throwing it nobody people simply don't know where their place is in the body I said it that way for a reason so first of all don't even think about a harvest until you come to the place that God has put you in and that brings you to the place where God has put you under the care of a Ministry that is now I want to clarify does that mean everybody has to be in one place I'm not saying that do not misunderstand god brother Ernie God placed you where he wanted you but he placed me he placed you where he till you come to that place that's the only time you're gonna ever find out what your rank is what you your particular job is in the body is and shall reap the Harvest thereof it's the verse 10 again we went from the land that I will give you and shall reap the Harvest he said he spoke to them there was a Karma time goes by in that time he takes him to the land where they're supposed to be there and now there's a conjunction that's gonna connect these two things together shall reap the Harvest thereofs against sumis and we just heard how are you going to reap a harvest if you don't show the seeds if you don't go through the process of what the wheat represents then how are you gonna add the Harvest Harvest time's going by you're growing don't shall you bring a sheath right yes of the first fruits now before I go into the first fruits just a little bit plenty of time we've only been going 45 minutes I have a bad habit of doing that no no that's a bad confession I used to have a bad habit of doing it but I want you to notice them foreign [Music] has to be the whole thing that's right that's right amen amen so without the waving of the sheath we've worked we've just heard there is no to Pentecost Desperado and that's another problem in the message people preaching to go Pentecost when brother says that we are no longer in the dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit we are in the dispensation of adoptions say that again please don't hold that again yeah well well whatever you want yeah no longer the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon All Flesh this guy right here but the infilling of the Holy Spirit but here's the problem why people can't really totally receive the end feeling of the holy spirit this doesn't come upon you no being all the time by itself it takes a vessel someone there just say this one has water and this one does pouring into another and we don't want to go into that our pastors it's coming from one vessel to the other and that's the part sometimes we can't swallow is okay got all these commas here in the time going back and then you've got to bring now notice we we heard how they we're planting the wheat every day they they were taking care of that that quick they were cultivating that question they were watering it every day that was their main focus that's what was most important to them so when their product funny came forth through all those stages and they put that quick out of the ground is Noah Noah did they know what they have did they know what they had location account here's the problem with us I'm going to pluck up some weight and I'm going to take it and we only have the priest wave it let's bring it down I'm gonna bring it to the pastor see and maybe just maybe accepted verse 11 versions and he shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you what does that mean to you our mentality mostly reads that and says he shall wear the Sheep before the Lord so we will be accepted that's the way we think is rising of the Sun in yes a little sold paragraph 84. the chief which was the first of your seed wow not the leftovers not everybody's picked it up and touched it back at the supermarket and I don't even want to go and do the other things thank you the first of your seed that you planted he's bringing it down to to us as individuals and when it comes up when it comes up and is ripened and you cut down the Sheep so if you don't know what you're doing you're gonna cut it down at the wrong time the product is mature you cut it down and take it to the priest how many of us do that well I think the pastor should do everything it's the pastor in the ministry it's always about what somebody else can do for me this person that's maturing he's not waiting for nobody to do this he's gonna do it because he's gone through the process to produce he's not guessing I hope and I I hope I make watch this and let him take it and wave it before the Lord for your exception now notice how it said in Spanish that you might be accepted foreign for your exception that you are accepted you have come with your Chief and he is to wave it before the Lord wow no wonder he can binds Keep Together under the revelation of the blood Revelation and brother Brandon said in the seals I've got about five more minutes there's two groups of people that claim to be under the blood of them rejects the revelation of the blood Revelation and how do they do that where did that blood come from it came out of the spirits that came out of the word you get that is no longer the chemistry of the blood yeah spirit that came out of it but where did that blood come from came out of the word made flesh so when that Spirit of the blood is revealed to you now you can bind your sheep together why this is this is good stuff to me you then are downstairs have to bring your Chief as you grow in the Lord are you understanding so it's no longer I'm going to bring this to see if I'm accepted yes how in the world would this person have a sheep with the whole process and the wheat is the original crane original I've even heard ministers say is we all go through stages there's things that I say now that I didn't say many years ago [Music] God has a way of changing your your tune he knows how to deal with us thank God he didn't leave it up to just to us no no kill one another right I've heard Minister say why you know brother Benham wanted to be bride is could tell the series and they'll bring out these quotes well God's gonna have a church and I hope I'm with her and they say you see he didn't really know he was bride and I just scratch my head yo hello do you think brother Bennett could skip this processes didn't he have to go through the same process of the new birth growing to the adoption when he goes to cff Bosworth on his deathbed FF password and he falls at his feet and says my father my father me padre Israel he said whatever was an apostle to the Pentecostals that's right he didn't just look to see Apostles in the Bible wherever uh he had a personal one right there with him he recognized amen amen so what stage did Brother Brennan think that he was seat and get it that he knew he was elected when the spirit of Elijah had turned his heart to the original Faith Apostolic before God could use him to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers his heart um here's about Transfiguration and those angels came down and he was lifted up into the constellation this is my beloved Prophet is and we could keep going so now you've got to take this it's great get these notes foreign oh I said oh yeah you're not gonna like it it's gonna be so sweet to your mouth but it's gonna be so bitter kicking all the hybrid garbage and that don't feel good that's a super bitter experience is stupid I might just stop right there because my time is up that was awesome [Applause] that was tell us a little bit more we got about 15 minutes you just deal with us about 15 more minutes and our craziness up here so God so then God thinks enough of us that we're strong enough we can pass any test that that the devil will throw at us I began to think all that the wheat has to go through and it goes through good times it goes through bad times but the one thing that was always for sure what a new season was coming every time and in this we see we see this that it had to die to give life and how much more had Christ gave his own life have life today it should be something that that should stir all of us up ever even more every day to know that we are now carriers of that same life and for this Dying World to receive more of Christ [Music] it takes us not just to hold it into ourselves it takes us to go to a Persona that maybe don't have the same opportunity that we have and be able to give them life that's what Christ did for me okay that that was something that was so amazing for me with within this study okay in order to get life you had to give your life and it isn't easy you know it's possible but it is so worth it one of the one of the other things that I that I had simply looking and me and my dad were talking about it you see it here in order to come into mature see how they had to be stacked together you know it's it's like it's like after a while me as a third generation I know there's a lot of people online you you get tired of hearing oh it was brother Bernie's Ministry and the brother Tommy's music and then everybody tried to make it like we were all separate we're all tied together now we've all ripened together today we're all going home together there's their Ministry and this is body of the Lord Jesus Christ and one day you idea we'll all be together on the other side praise God [Applause] good point brother man when they stacked him in the in the field and Los Campos they would stand them up right to avoid rodents and they were facing upwards not to the sun are you pointing brother get a baskets all the time where are you standing where am I standing are we pointing to the son because that's what he's trying to do he's trying to point USA he's pointing us you've got a pointer does it have a red light oh just hit it oh wow this whole plant is the plant from the roots to the stock I'll tell you the castle the Woodland the shark the foreign all of these were carriers of the life there you go that was coming up to develop in the who is but when it came time for the Harvest [Music] all the life had to be in the grain when the combine would come down here to harvest the wheat and brother Benham says hurry hurry live get in the grains because if you stay down in the stocks you will die but now here when this is fully mature in the presence of the s-o-n it's no longer just a carrier of life it is the living carrier of the life itself is it carrying the life that came up to the planet this is fun this is a good deal you have your act together today and every day no no you just think of buying it foreign the first Exodus what did he do diesel he brought them out of a natural land to a natural life the second accident he brought them out from a spiritual condition spiritual and to a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost spirituality this is the prophet of God foreign I bet you somebody won a million dollars you wouldn't be saying now yeah they like you really mean now he is bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy ghosts right back into the Eternal land of the millennium La Tierra Eternal Del milleno and the great Hereafter same Pillar of Fire El mismo mismo Pillar de Fuego by the same anointed Systema unhido the same godios doing the same things and the same word declared the first one the claro La Primera declared the second one the same word declared the second one has declared the third one and here Yaki we see it among among us look at your neighbor we see it among us look at your neighbor here we see it when you see Jesus Jesus and you see him yet a little while and the world will see me no more that's to the believer now we would like for everybody in here to be a Believers for I will be with you until the end of the world this is the this is the Crux of the sheep it is to Islam Jesus a okay Jesus said I won't leave you comfortable I will send unto him unto you uh the comforter all right see so now you're not by yourself doesn't matter which condition you find yourself in no important conditions if you're tired you are not by yourself you know why you're in a bundle this is salt this is so very important it does not matter this is what the devil wants to do he wants to take you out of the bundle and he wants to just take a strand out of this bundle but let me tell you it is the time right now so stick together and let the presence I got to just sit down just just a second when he goes when he goes this is this is where it's all at like he's understanding when he's about ready to leave when he's about ready to leave the world sovereign February 28th when a man's taken up same life that was in the original that was now an original with us the waving yeah such a baptism of the Holy Ghost sweep the bride right off the faces this is the prophet is as Christ was the first one to raise Christos from all the prophets although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride in La Novia coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last days bring all men not to this church not to me nor me but to him he is the one that's being waved over life that is in you and when that life is waived one of these days but Tommy read the next paragraph thank you waving of the sheath is what was the Sheep the first one that come to mature La Primera Maduro the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved remember do I have the next one yeah all right hallelujah hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about weighed over the people and the first time there will come forth right age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism but uh uh one more time brother for for a resurrection out of
