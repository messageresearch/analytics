oyote English [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] amen [Music] I like to come up here when it's nice and hot blessed be the name of the Lord good to know my brothers and we are here to enjoy the word of God it's open our Bibles Brothers and let's open to the Book of Psalms chapter 42. and when you have it please confirm that by saying amen two verses of this chapter verses one and two amen amen the scripture says Aguas as the heart panted after the water Brooks so painted my soul after thee o God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God foreign for this opportunity foreign and we have to approach yourself for so very many reasons foreign [Music] be take except by him that put it there blessed be the name of the Lord I believe that he was in much anguish he said Prophet The Prophet says it usually requires anguish to pick out the very best of what's inside of the man have you ever experienced the time of being in English you will find out that's when you should really show what is a god that is in you because if God is in you nada nothing can separate you from God none of those things will separate you from God the prophet says foreign sometimes we get into many different kinds of orange for very many reasons the prophet said that David had to sit down and think about these things he was thinking what am I doing with my life but can we just business sometimes Brothers it requires you to sit and begin to meditate and you think Lord white tonight go forward instead of advancing it looks like I'm going backwards don't wait till you get in that condition to begin to look for God but to accept that moment brother to think of your life what you are going to do why did this happen to me muchas many times that is trying to get your attention and the prophet says he permits you to get in that hospital how many of you have ever been in the hospital they are laying in the bed you raise your hand Brothers the majority of us that when you look above my time my help comes in the time of trouble from above but we forget over all these things hospital hospital maybe we have to foreign above because success in this world it will have you so busy and the businesses of this world blessed be the name of the Lord says it's for you to seek after him it's time for you to repent what happens that many people they repent I mean the Bible says that separates himself from sins and departs from sins we shall obtain Mercy many people confess they don't separate themselves from the sin that's the Bible the question is if you separate yourself to continue doing the same thing the prophet says that repentance is to have the desire to never do it again that is a true repentance the prophet says David was calling out not for some historical something that happened many years ago he was crying out for the Living God brother I believe in a living God you're afraid to to come face to face with your sins I will never drink of you again I do not need you know why the one that drinks most he gets he gets drunk the next day he's gonna want more yes then he's going to want more but when you take God in his words you will never again you will never have that desire in your heart again foreign eternal life foreign you say now Lord give me that water domination oh I want from that that kind of water you know why porque yesterday she was tired that's why she had had five husbands and the one she had it was no good either but in her heart to find what was right you have to desire strongly to what is right maybe her first husband mistreated her she says maybe the second one he will humiliate her can you imagine that woman but when she found herself oh brother how difficult it is to find today a friend is very difficult the prophet said she wanted to find out somebody that wouldn't condemn her or accuse her of anything and then he would use the judgment and righteousness and in truth she said he said go bring me your husband she said I don't have a husband and Jesus said well you have said you have spoken in truth blessed be the name of the Lord how good is it to find somebody like that sometimes we need someone that will bring Justice or righteousness to you that's what you said if you knew the gift of God the people come to church brother but they don't know the gift of God foreign blessed be the name of the Lord brother when you're thirsty thirsty but all the time you're gonna always have a thirst all the time that's why the Bible says it says the Heart Is Never Satisfied how is that so brother the prophet says it was a woman correct me okay there was this demon in this woman that could take a hold of ten men and tear them up these are these are if the devil can do that what can the Holy Spirit do is just a few days ago I was driving marijuana there was a person in front of me that was smoking marijuana he was without a shirt walking down the street smoking his marijuana and I either started thinking glory to God it's gonna cost you brother and we say we have the Holy Spirit a brother a person one of one of those demons he will jump around he didn't care what people thought about him he didn't make no difference to him who criticized him he was in his craziness there you know in whom you have believed will worship God in his spirit in spirit and in truth why men One More Story I don't know if you've heard this story and in the military service there was a Commander cheat that had a duck yes oh this this Sergeant or whatever he loved this duck he will sit there in the window and look at his duck you know what happened one day one of his soldiers he saw that duck he said that duck I'm gonna eat him oh this duck was So Pretty One Day the sergeants he didn't take care yes the soldier went while he was doing something else he got the duck and dressed him in ate him but one day when the cook one day called him and said come on you helped me wash all the dishes wash the floors mop the floors and the soldiers said that's not my work and the cook said do you remember the duck so now you know just said oh well there he goes cleaning everything up he's mopping and cleaning the next day The Colony said calm oh yeah help me here in the kitchen to do this this and this the soldier said that's not my job and he says but the duck there he goes again he was in such a desperation in this situation I'm gonna go with the sergeant he went into his office he oh commandante he said Sergeant I came here to tell you something you remember that duck you had there outside oh yeah I remember he said I I ate the duck you yourself the surgeon said I knew you did oh that Soldier felt so at rest there are many Christians like that today he's a grandfather that has these pictures but he knows everything you gotta have faith in him and confess to him that cook calls the soldier again with the kitchen he said no no more and remember the duck he says I spoke with the sergeant you know there's something that that governs over the people of God when there is so much sin that we have you know and we know you know and we get all down we get sad foreign don't think that God doesn't know he knows everything come with everything that you have brother Let's Dance your feet [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord yeah well our next picture comes foreign [Music] history [Music] .com [Music] Salvador amen don't you love him what a beautiful message for [Applause] for a beautiful message how many love him tonight my water message on Sunday and then our brother comes and yeah and just throw some more nuggets out there you awake today hey man let's go straight to the scriptures amen let's start with first five sorry and in the evening sacrifice I Rose up for my heaviness and having rent my garments and my mantle I fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God and said oh my God I am ashamed and blessed to lift up my face unto thee my God for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespasses grown upon the heavens it is amen you may be seated amen what a beautiful message you know God gives us that thirst you know but but many times we when we're in Victory time it's easy to serve God but we're when we're in the gutter you know that's when we have we have problems you know because many times you know we come and we hear the word of God you know but we we take part of it you know because we're ashamed we're ashamed that we're sinful people you know because we do not recognize the sacrifice that was made we don't recognize the god that's in our days so we let these sins continue and then they become iniquities and to come to the point where we will not change it's so easy to come to church the pastor brings the word the ministry brings the words and you say oh that didn't partain to me wait a minute when John was told to take the book he was to eat all of it you know if we could come into the presence of God that thirst that God gave us was to take every bit of God's word no we are so worried about our sin are hiding our sinfulness instead of confronting it you know we let the devil play games with us but when we see reality We're not gonna make it we're not going to make you with the sinful nature We're not gonna make it with this iniquity mentality because what is it it's a slave mentality you know if we look and see where God has taken us from we forget about that part we were lost in the nuclear sins we were nobody but God who is Rich down and he saved me but that wasn't good enough we have to have the mentality that we gotta care enough about our brothers because we cannot make it without each other so when that word comes forward you say it doesn't pertain to me but it pertains to somebody you gotta think we gotta see God we gotta pray to God foreign I must say is worthy one more time give us one more opportunity we're not going to give him credit tonight he deserves no credit because my God's almighty God he's strong in Valor as Fuerte because you look at that life foreign [Music] foreign Elias here's Ezra he says I gotta do something I gotta do something and I gotta assure you tonight can you take a trip with me we come to church many times can't even show up on time this is or we don't even show up benimos maybe there's a football game maybe there's a basketball game when all this is at the battle um it doesn't matter what service you come to no importance you come expect the greatest that God has to us that's what you're gonna get let's look when you come to church late when you don't come to service your Robbie someone from a blessing because what happened when they crossed they went into Jericho but there was sin in the camera God promised now one of your men but as soon as these men started and here's here's Aiken he takes the Babylonian government but what happened what happened Angelo what happened next episode who knows but what happened yeah let's get let's get real tonight brother Ronnie you and your family stand up yeah this is how it was it wasn't just brother Ronnie where's Jerry [Music] where's the rest of you how many are related to these guys come on stand up because you did something wrong you're dead you're dead you're dead you're dead that's what it was they lived under the law God did not hold yours so here you find the people in bondage if got everything hey I'll be down Todo they forgot that they crossed over into the promised land they forgot the walls of Jericho they forgot when those two spies went into a to to um rehab the Harlot they forgot what she told the spies that we have heard how you crossed over on dry land almost no evil how great your God is but there was one man that did not forget okay video let's turn to the description sorry I'm so excited tonight but that it may be a witness between us may not say to our children in the time that's to come you have no part with the Lord therefore said we it shall be when they should say unto unto us or to Our Generations in the time to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made that this wasn't for the birth offerings it wasn't for the sacrifices but it is a witness between us what was established that day that it would never be forgotten it was prophesied of what was going to come fighting foreign Aiden examples of what was going to happen today they did not want it to be forgotten remember what the scripture says not the sacrifice not these burnt offerings but it was something wrong what are we here on Sunday what's Rapture it's a condition of who Jesus Christ now was they again Jesus Christ Jesus Christ battle King this is Crystal s so here's Ezra but I guess that is but to this day that was one of the greatest scriptures of someone who fought for the people yeah foreign great part of the Resurrection so what happened it we start thinking and we start praying Lord Keep Us Together keep us focused don't let us lose the joy Lord everything are found in Pastor installed inside of us it's come out we're not waiting for it to come out it's already produced it's already produced so the event just took place for what is inside of us but we gotta wake up to talk about the third pool but it's so hard [Music] you better be ready Church you better be ready you see what's unfolding I remember one thing I was going to share what's in my heart I remember when our family brother Caleb was at my house he turned to me he says you better know what you have he says because it just hit us right in the face foreign but when the ministry comes they give you advice they give you advice is you got to remember the vessel that's there stop rejecting it it's time it's time for us to be made you know the messages that are coming forward the rapturing messages they're not just any message you gotta realize that we gotta recognize because what happened he went to the Lord but then he had to unite better today he had to unite they had given up were some of the tribes that were left but they were fighting with each other they couldn't get along they said where is the prophet of God but he came back with 2 000 men condos Hombres but he came back we know this place under that anointing when he came back to campamento there was victory Victoria something happened something Supernatural because what's happening it's something Supernatural it's uniting time but we first have to unite as a church if they're sin in our campus let's get it out if there's sickness why are you so scared come on church almost Iglesia why are you scared for questions cast that sin out they if why are you scared the prophet of God tells us we have all authorities where's the power at in your throat where donde so what's the problem the prophet God says if you could get one mortal to believe the other two steps can stand in your way [Music] Grande I know the one that produced it I know the one that I could call him on the scene he's up there somewhere else what's the problem are you sick is close your eyes today close your eyes
