[24:50] thank you
[25:15] okay
[25:31] oh
[25:42] [Music]
[25:50] [Music]
[25:52] there's a window
[25:55] into heaven
[25:58] i can close my eyes and see
[26:04] where there are no earthly struggles
[26:18] [Music]
[26:21] cause the flight can't finally see
[26:26] and those crippled legs are dancing
[26:32] out across that crystal sea
[26:38] there's a special place in heaven
[26:44] where the unborn babies play
[26:49] and they're rocking
[26:58] [Music]
[27:03] children
[27:05] [Music]
[27:18] as they spin around
[27:21] [Music]
[27:24] don't that sound
[27:25] [Music]
[27:29] like that sound like
[27:35] where the son of god
[27:41] [Music]
[27:58] darkness there is overtaken
[28:04] by the light that's always
[28:19] [Music]
[28:22] is expensive
[28:25] [Music]
[28:27] don't you worry about the cause
[28:31] [Music]
[28:32] it was painful
[28:35] by jesus
[28:41] [Music]
[28:44] and all the things that he promised
[28:49] will be there just like he said
[28:55] as an
[28:56] eternal reminder
[28:59] [Music]
[29:01] of the precious
[29:04] [Music]
[29:18] where the son of god
[29:21] [Music]
[29:30] [Music]
[29:45] [Music]
[30:01] that's
[30:03] always on
[30:20] amen
[30:30] god bless you this morning
[30:34] grateful to each and every one of you
[30:36] that has made the effort
[30:39] to be here this morning
[30:41] those that are online uh
[30:44] sister christina's family that are in
[30:46] line
[30:47] in i believe new york may the lord bless
[30:50] them
[30:51] also at this time and those that will
[30:53] see this at a later junction her family
[30:56] her friends
[30:57] may the lord jesus
[30:59] comfort you
[31:00] i'm going to ask us to stand
[31:03] and we're going to
[31:07] read a portion of scripture for a few
[31:09] moments
[31:11] this this morning
[31:19] the bible tells us in the book of saint
[31:21] james
[31:24] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[31:29] we will go into such a city
[31:32] and continue there a year
[31:35] and buy and sell and get gain
[31:38] whereas ye know not what shall be on the
[31:42] moral
[31:43] or what is your life
[31:45] it is even a vapor
[31:48] that appeareth for a little time
[31:50] and then vanishes
[31:52] away
[31:54] for that ye ought to say
[31:57] if the lord will
[31:58] we shall live
[32:00] and do this or that
[32:03] but now you rejoice in your boastings
[32:05] all such rejoicing is evil
[32:08] therefore be him that knoweth to do good
[32:12] and doeth it not
[32:13] to him
[32:14] it is sin
[32:16] let us approach the author
[32:19] and ask him to give us our
[32:21] our daily portion
[32:23] as
[32:24] we draw night to him
[32:26] he is as we heard yesterday he is
[32:29] our
[32:30] king
[32:31] the immortal invisible
[32:34] the only wise
[32:36] god
[32:37] thank you father this
[32:39] morning
[32:40] for the opportunity to be able to draw
[32:42] nigh
[32:43] into your presence
[32:46] into this congregation of people that
[32:49] have been purchased by your blood
[32:52] and father
[32:53] we ask father that you will
[32:55] comfort those that need comforting right
[32:58] now
[32:59] that you will bless those that need
[33:02] you this morning
[33:04] may those that are online
[33:06] as they hear these words
[33:09] may your holy spirit descend to them
[33:12] and give them what they need at this
[33:15] moment
[33:16] father we are your children
[33:19] you are our father
[33:21] we
[33:22] don't know what to do unless
[33:25] you
[33:26] inspire
[33:28] the words to become life to us
[33:31] father off out of the pages of your holy
[33:34] word
[33:35] we do garner
[33:37] what we need we do receive the
[33:40] inspiration
[33:41] the revelation
[33:43] and the word that is supposed to supply
[33:48] the
[33:49] our needs today
[33:51] and father
[33:52] every time we look
[33:54] into these sacred pages
[33:56] we always find you there
[33:58] for you
[34:00] uh this is you
[34:02] written
[34:03] in scripture form we ask father that you
[34:06] will bless everyone now once again
[34:09] in the precious name of our lord and
[34:11] savior jesus christ you may be seated
[34:18] i won't
[34:19] take much of your time this morning
[34:23] but i i do want to take
[34:26] a little bit of it
[34:28] to uh
[34:31] to uh
[34:33] give our condolences to the family of
[34:35] sister christina
[34:37] especially to her children
[34:40] to andreas to alexis to adriana to
[34:43] jacoby
[34:49] 35 years is way too early
[34:55] but
[34:57] we do trust in a resurrection
[35:01] reason that
[35:02] we separate
[35:05] christianity from the rest of the
[35:07] world's religions
[35:09] is that we do point to an empty tomb
[35:12] an empty grave
[35:15] and as he spoke to us
[35:17] these words
[35:19] he spoke to us because i live you live
[35:22] also
[35:23] and
[35:25] receiving the strength that we need for
[35:28] our life and in our journey
[35:33] i've
[35:35] i
[35:38] look towards the
[35:40] pages of the scripture
[35:42] i
[35:44] been fortunate
[35:47] in one way shape or another
[35:50] to be able to direct myself to different
[35:52] grieving families
[35:56] to be able to tell them what
[35:59] life is all about
[36:02] you cannot go and know about life
[36:05] unless you know a little bit of what
[36:07] death is
[36:09] death is a separation
[36:12] death is something that each and every
[36:14] one of us
[36:16] in here
[36:17] one day will meet
[36:20] one day
[36:21] when it is our turn will
[36:23] will be lane where sister christina is
[36:27] at
[36:29] and someone will be saying some words
[36:31] over us
[36:34] we
[36:35] know that that is the destiny
[36:38] of each and every one of us
[36:40] as soon as we are born
[36:43] we actually
[36:44] start dying from that day on
[36:49] i i see my aunt cecil and my aunt
[36:52] and my cousin michelle
[36:54] president gene
[36:56] as in kim
[36:58] family
[37:00] brother jorge
[37:01] and all the aunts and the uncles that
[37:04] are here
[37:05] representing today
[37:08] they are our foundation of what our
[37:11] church was built upon
[37:14] in understanding the scripture and
[37:17] understanding the life that we have then
[37:20] lived in
[37:23] i
[37:24] look at the basis of where our eternal
[37:27] destination lays and it lays within the
[37:31] pages of what we know as the holy bible
[37:36] there are
[37:37] around 800 000 words in that
[37:40] king james bible
[37:43] and our life
[37:45] hangs upon
[37:47] some of these words
[37:49] look in our life our life is is a
[37:52] paradox
[37:54] our life is
[37:56] supposed to be at times happy
[37:59] and we laugh
[38:01] but the majority of times that we laugh
[38:03] and are happy it's like
[38:05] a child
[38:06] that is whistling through the cemetery
[38:09] we don't know what life will be
[38:13] we don't know what tomorrow holds
[38:16] but we do according to the scripture
[38:19] no
[38:19] who holds tomorrow
[38:22] and because of that
[38:24] we get our strength in times like this
[38:29] this is the time that shows the
[38:32] character
[38:33] of the person in need
[38:36] this is the time whether we believe
[38:39] or we don't believe
[38:42] this church
[38:43] as i am so proud to be called a member
[38:47] and associate pastor of this church very
[38:50] proud is only four walls
[38:53] and these walls have never saved anybody
[38:56] and never will save anybody but this is
[39:00] a gathering of people that have come
[39:02] here
[39:03] for one purpose and one purpose only and
[39:05] that is to further themselves to find
[39:08] life
[39:10] and as we we look
[39:13] every day of our life should be a search
[39:16] of how much more can i do god's will
[39:20] what does god have me to do today
[39:24] where am i going where did i come from
[39:27] what am i doing here and unless we have
[39:31] the answer to those questions we go in
[39:35] what is called a death walk
[39:38] and the death walk is there is we are
[39:40] just going around in circles and in
[39:43] circles trying to find the end and
[39:46] trying to find the beginning
[39:49] but jesus christ spoke these words to us
[39:54] he says that the thief cometh to steal
[39:58] to kill and to destroy
[40:00] but he said i have come
[40:03] that you might have life
[40:05] and that more abundantly
[40:08] we look at
[40:09] our opening scripture
[40:11] and it says worry where whereas ye know
[40:14] not what we shall be on the morrow
[40:19] what for
[40:20] i did a funeral last november
[40:24] of a little girl that was
[40:27] that died
[40:29] in the birth canal
[40:32] many times people say i'm going to be
[40:34] this and i'm going to do this and i'm
[40:36] going to do that and i
[40:39] had the opportunity
[40:42] last
[40:44] few months ago
[40:45] to do the funeral of a
[40:47] of a girl 23 years old
[40:50] that was
[40:52] disabled
[40:53] handicapped
[40:55] never spoke a word in her whole life
[40:59] we have great plans in our lives of what
[41:02] we shall do
[41:04] and we live like if we're going to live
[41:07] for a thousand years and we act like if
[41:10] there is no tomorrow and no justice and
[41:13] no judgment
[41:17] but the paradox of our time in history
[41:21] is that
[41:22] we have taller buildings
[41:24] but shorter tempers
[41:31] wider freeways
[41:40] but we have less
[41:43] we buy more
[41:45] but we enjoy less
[41:48] we have bigger houses
[41:52] and smaller families
[41:56] more convenience
[41:58] but less time
[42:01] we have more degrees
[42:04] but less sense
[42:06] more judgment
[42:10] more knowledge but less judgment
[42:14] more experts
[42:16] yet more problems
[42:19] more medicine
[42:21] but less wellness
[42:24] we drink too much
[42:27] we smoke too much
[42:29] we spend to recklessly
[42:32] laugh too little
[42:34] we drive fast
[42:37] we get too angry
[42:45] we stay up too late
[42:47] we get up too tired
[42:50] we read too little
[42:52] and we watch too much tv
[42:56] and because of that all of those we pray
[42:59] very seldom
[43:02] used to be that americans would take a
[43:05] bath once a week
[43:07] and pray every day
[43:10] now we take a shower every day and we
[43:13] pray if we're lucky once a week
[43:17] and we wonder
[43:19] why our life has no
[43:24] favor
[43:26] has no feeling
[43:29] and it is because of the work we do into
[43:32] our life
[43:34] they asked me
[43:35] asked us the question
[43:37] as we have been raising and we
[43:40] have as he has been born and been such a
[43:43] blessing to us my boy abraham
[43:46] was born with
[43:48] some
[43:49] difficulties
[43:50] they asked what do you think about him i
[43:54] said he's our salt and pepper
[43:56] he's what adds savor to our life
[44:00] but what is jesus christ mean to you
[44:04] is jesus christ just a man hanging up on
[44:07] a cross to you
[44:10] is jesus christ just a picture that you
[44:13] see every once in a while
[44:16] or is jesus christ the person that you
[44:19] fell in love with a long time ago
[44:21] because he has redeemed you from this
[44:23] body of sin and death
[44:27] if it's a relationship that is something
[44:30] that you have to add savor to
[44:34] when you pray in the morning and you
[44:36] raise up your hands and you sing to the
[44:38] lord you're adding savor to the
[44:41] relationship of life
[44:47] we have multiplied our possessions
[44:51] but reduced our values
[44:55] we talk too much
[44:57] love to sell them
[44:59] and hate too often
[45:03] we've learned how to make a living
[45:06] but not a life
[45:08] we've added years to life
[45:10] but not life to years
[45:13] we've been all the way to the moon and
[45:15] back but have trouble crossing the
[45:17] street and saying hello to our next door
[45:20] neighbor
[45:22] we've conquered outer space
[45:26] we have not even
[45:28] dented to find out what lives inside of
[45:31] our inner space
[45:35] we've cleaned up the air
[45:38] but we have polluted the soul
[45:41] we've conquered the atom
[45:43] but not our prejudices
[45:46] we write more but learn less
[45:50] we plan more but we accomplish less
[45:54] we've learned how to rush
[45:57] but not to wait we build more computers
[46:01] to hold more information to produce more
[46:04] copies than ever
[46:06] but we communicate less and less
[46:09] these are the times of fast food
[46:13] how many love fast food we like everyone
[46:15] here loves fast food
[46:18] slow digestion
[46:20] these are the times of big man and small
[46:23] character
[46:24] steep prophets and shallow
[46:27] relationships
[46:29] these are the days of two income incomes
[46:33] but more divorces
[46:37] fancier houses
[46:39] but broken homes
[46:42] these are the days of quick trips
[46:45] disposable everything
[46:47] throwing away paper plates cups whatever
[46:51] needs to be done
[46:53] and it's also a throwaway of our
[46:55] morality
[46:57] one night stands overweight bodies and
[47:01] pills that do everything from cheer
[47:04] to quiet to kill it is a time when there
[47:08] is much in the showroom window
[47:11] and nothing in the stock room
[47:15] why do i say all of that
[47:18] and it sounds
[47:19] so gloomy
[47:22] it is a gloomy world out there
[47:25] politically
[47:27] religiously
[47:29] in everything that you can imagine
[47:33] and without
[47:34] god in this world
[47:37] this world is chaos and on its way to
[47:39] hell
[47:42] but the word of god
[47:44] tells us
[47:45] oh give thanks unto the lord
[47:49] for he is good
[47:51] for his mercy endureth forever
[47:55] i don't know how many christians and how
[47:57] many people love god even if you're not
[47:59] from this church how many can say that
[48:02] god is good
[48:04] the reason that we are here today even
[48:07] if it's a just a funeral
[48:10] service is we know that god is good
[48:14] oh give thanks unto god
[48:17] unto the god of gods
[48:19] for his mercy endureth forever
[48:23] oh give thanks to the lord of lords for
[48:26] his mercy endureth forever
[48:29] and we can go on and on and on you were
[48:33] able to come here this morning because
[48:35] his mercy endureth forever
[48:39] as bleak as it looks like
[48:42] guys
[48:44] as bleak as it looks
[48:46] like as believe as it looks like me
[48:51] there will come a day
[48:53] but there will be no sorrow
[48:57] i don't think you believe me
[48:59] there is coming a day when no heartache
[49:03] shall come
[49:04] no more clouds in the sky
[49:07] no more tears to dim the eye it is
[49:10] called a resurrection morning
[49:13] that's what the bible calls us that is
[49:15] when we change from this tent to a
[49:19] building
[49:21] amen in a tent
[49:24] it's temporary
[49:26] all the sorrows and everything we go
[49:29] through is all temporary
[49:32] there is something that lives when the
[49:34] soul
[49:35] of the human being and that is god
[49:38] and only god can wipe our tears away
[49:41] and only god can satisfy our heart
[49:50] i look at four beautiful children
[49:55] they're blessed
[49:57] to have a grandmama
[50:00] and a great grandma
[50:02] an aunt and uncle
[50:06] and a great father figure
[50:12] and great people in the church
[50:15] that care about them
[50:17] what will happen to them
[50:20] what will happen to them is all what
[50:22] already happened to them
[50:24] god has already
[50:27] bought them
[50:28] god has already possessed them
[50:31] they belong to almighty god our lives
[50:34] belong to him you know why
[50:37] because his mercy
[50:40] my judgment might be one thing your
[50:43] judgment upon her life might be one
[50:45] thing our judgment upon her life might
[50:48] be one thing
[50:50] but let me tell you what god says
[50:53] praise the lord
[50:54] because his mercy endureth forever
[50:57] if we go upon the creeds of life all of
[51:01] us are doomed to death and are doomed to
[51:03] hell if we lie we do the same thing as
[51:07] the drunkard
[51:11] if we don't do what god wants us to do
[51:14] our responsibility we're all
[51:18] damned
[51:21] but his mercy
[51:24] thankful to god that no one of us here
[51:27] is god almighty
[51:30] because he judges as you heard our
[51:32] pastor say on a higher level
[51:36] it wasn't for the way he judges us and
[51:38] the way he looks at us we would not have
[51:41] a purpose and would not have a chance
[51:44] but because his mercy
[51:52] his mercy
[51:53] endureth forever
[51:56] we can sing
[51:57] and say to sister christina
[52:06] not goodbye sister christina
[52:11] but until the morning
[52:16] and because he lives
[52:19] we have a mark
[52:22] raise up your hands
[52:24] in victory
[52:27] that how god does things we don't
[52:30] know we do know who hold our hand
[52:36] god bless you
[52:38] [Applause]
