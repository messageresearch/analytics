of God it's going to start and see your smiling faces this is Sunday school is you know when I get back here you know uh I don't give you a message for you to jump in trouble don't get me wrong that's fine we need everything but it'll make you think amen amen so not to have you standing as you see the title of the message is the Great Tribulation and if you open your Bibles to Revelation 6 verse 12. I'd like to preach from revelation of the Apocalypse it's a book that very few minutes preachers get into is because it's a book that's very hard to understand but a couple of years ago a couple um being the pester were making tapes to Uganda and it was on the Book of Revelation yes and he would take a Chapter yes and I would take another chapter so when I got to chapter six I I we sent a message on uh the six seal in person and after that is I didn't even do justice to them so this morning we're gonna go a little deeper on it I will not I do not have the time to get to where I wanna get nothing else but I I want to keep it simple this morning and just put a foundation fundamental and I beheld when he had opened the sixth Hill and low there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth uh and the moon became his blood says in the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even it's a big peak casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind is and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together in every mountain and Island were moved out of their places if the Lord had his Blessing to the arena the word you may be seated can you imagine how a guy from a little town of Hanover um how could someone of my stature can teach you people how the Sun became how the moon turned into blood how the Stars will fall from Heaven and how the heavens will roll like a scroll is there is no way I could do it but brothers that God will give you Revelation when that time it's hard to understand it's difficult in there but if you got the Lord on your side to the scripture that we just read ing yeah God bless you my friend and you won't go to our goal go together my brother Fabio and I will be here together when the Rapture comes pray for us so then on the scripture that I read something is wrong here look at the introduction middle introduction there's there's writers know why he net is the answer is what happened even when the fifth seal was open there was no Beastie saying come and see Revelation 6 seven to eight apocalypse says and I look and behold the Pale Horse and his name the chair on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the soul and with hunger and with death and with a beast of the earth is his name was name was so why would he the Beast going to the fifth ceiling says come and see foreign [Music] what if I tell you yes they will yes attention brother Brennan said they went through the pre-tribulation of Adolf Eichmann and Hitler tribulations there are two tribulations in a room this was a tribulation there for the Jews but Moses and Elijah are in charge of the other tribulations I don't think I'll have time to explain that but next time when Caleb gives him an opportunity I'll go a little deeper on them Revelation 4 5. apocalypse is Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven Lambs lands of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God is yet adios and Before the Throne Throne sea of glass I turn to Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round above the throne were forbids full of eyes before and behind is in the old testamental Moses made what he saw in heaven then God commanded him to do he saw a sea of glass in heaven and do you know that the prophet Ezekiel Saw that Crystal over those living creatures Moses made okay says was a labor of Press On Roberto and he called it the Sea of breaths when you see press in the Bible says judgment significant with you so he put that that sea of breast just before the holy place it was for the sacrifice was and on that all oh they sacrificed was burned but in heaven the sea of glass Before the Throne so before the holy place down here the labor which was the Sia is for the sacrifices had to be burned sacrifices before we were received by God anti-scar and receives produce like I I've told you before let's say and I've told all these young ministers because brother Brandon placed a message bring bringing him out of History if we if I just read it like that this Bible is dead so if you don't have somebody to explain it or bring it bring it out of History if it wasn't for a propheta how could we get not only me I'm talking about all you ministers brother we we in other words to get and explain that I need Divine interventions thank God that when I needed the Lord comes on the scene in health message the sacrifices have to be burned before they are received what is he talking about here the guest it is talking about foolish virgins had to be abused they can be received by God because when Moses saw the labor in him and it was clear as Christians because the church already been redeemed like let's say yeah so later Revelation 15 1 apocalypse is and I saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels hearing the seven last plagues foreign and yeah and over the number of his names they were standing on the sea of glass having the hearts of God for eign who were they were they sing in the they sang the song of Moses the servant of God they were the police through the great tribulations they were clean so the Church of The Purge they were the sacrifice that had to be burned before God could receive them when John saw the labor the Sea of glasses you and I were were had already gone out from there and gone with the Lord amen amen the first labor was clearest crystals no more blood the church age was over the church was raptured but notice many tribulations sent as warnings in February of 2013 in February the world was astounded when not blazing me exploded over Russia exploitos sobre Russia estimated he said it was 55 feet wide estimate said weighing 10 000 tons traveling 44 000 miles per hour and the energy released as a meteor this integrated was 500 kilotons question around 30 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped Hiroshima versus their angel s personas and damage thousands of homes that was a warning by God to them and if it happened once it will happen again then there are tribulations that are brought by men remember when the water and as they say Jerusalem where is he Jews and when King Spirit how Ard is Heron was a wicked Maniac can you imagine what kind of man Herod was can anybody tell me how many wives he inherited nobody again he had 10 wives yes and why was he so wicked you know why Ruthie he killed nine of his wife he murdered nine of his wives esposa you think that's bad all to your suspensions nothing like I said there are tribulations brought by men he was paranoid if suspected the day that his wives were Unfaithful is knew that he was hated so what did she do look look Jason look good he he knew he was hated so he demanded that his son be executed on the day of his own death you know why because he was hated foreign he did not want another king so here comes that tribulation what did he do yes it is what is called the massacre of the Innocence healed all the babies two years does the bride go through that fibrillation no we know that the bride does not go through that tribulations no will hook on plus Daniel Bryan teacher drag message I would like to be like John in Elk address for two years and his neighbors were the snakes and the Scorpions and the lizards serpientes now you go to Hebrews everyone says oh you really in Hebrews remember talking about the wheat and the tares when it was so dry they wanted water is doesn't it doesn't only fall on the green chili the in the Roses it falls under which hospital was in that plague of covertus wasn't that a mild tribulation then you all of us pass through it it not only hit the people of the world it hit almost every one of you and yourself is this heat it is so hard it is killing people is and there are tribulations doesn't so that church even the bride goes through this but don't be afraid not through the great population nothing it's a mild tribulation media and that's nothing when we would go to uh get invited to preach in Phoenix I would say even in Phoenix those of you that live in Phoenix you'll be right at home because it's just as hot in hell foreign indices F forgive me I it's giving a scripture before that Genesis 19 22. Escape teaser right can you not do anything kill love come Seether therefore the name of the city was called the war that the Prisa is do you want to escape all this yes all the bad things that are happening we're living in a uh even when I go to the mountains you see so many the dead raised that a lot of dead trees we're living in a time where everything is is dying and on the character and wherever we look we see death and the people that don't die someone kills them and there's so much killings when I was a young man and we would get into fights with other other people it was Bare hand yes now they're all a bunch of cowards they would just have a knife foreign and after some years went by yeah and someone would start to carry a gun now they don't have enough with a gun now foreign just killings that are happening we're almost not in the last days is killings same look Lucas 17 26 yes we want to escape because we know that something is fixing to happen as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man come on they did it they drank they married wife they were given in marriage until the day is that no one entered into the ark and a whole lot came and destroyed the Moon is likewise also she was in the days of lot they did it they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it is but the same day that lot went out of Salam it rained for a year and bring Stone from heaven and destroyed the Moon Manifesto notice nothing I always wondered it says in the days and then right there and then in the days of life like he's repeating the same thing eating drinking and I was wondering why it was like that is it was only for the Gentiles so let's see what they were doing to eat and drink is they were eating foreign modernist beautiful microwaves micronas hermosos hardest they ever used and they like to eat out or every day that's all in the United States is oh my god I've passed through a lot of them I remember when I was just maybe about four or five years old my mother cooked enough [Music] can you imagine this Modern Woman cooking on a wood stove and the weather is 110 out there out there and The woman there by the side of a burning stove I thought there'd be a lot of divorces for eign no you're just living in the Golden Age isn't this the Golden Age you can almost all of you are from the wood they went into El petroleum yeah my brother and wife would deliver the petroleum to the houses with electricity in in uh what not electricity so it was perverted number two and they were drinking well you have to drink you drink water baby agua soda soda juices Google and they like to go to restaurants they drink beer whiskey whiskey cocktail alcohol it says they were marrying they lived together for 15 or 20 years I don't have to explain all this now I'm going to quote brother Brennan in the message now they marry for sexual it's the motivating factor now can you imagine Carlos if he said that about 60 years ago there has never been a time in history when me and my wife we move from Hanover to Las Cruces in 2008. and they took us uh Kensington are you in Kensington are next door to us you can correct me if I'm wrong so they were building the first two houses they're right yeah well I mean When I visit our the Collins Collins for Tommy Jr and Terry and Rachel and that's foreign brother random said the building is so great it is one of the signs of the end times days of Noah there were two groups there were the wicked that perished righteous who escaped but in the times there were three groups that dwellers Lord and his family in Sodoma number three Abraham and his family Abraham is familiar let us look at the coming of Destruction and judgment as it came to in the days of Noah and lots of they are both time an example of the third destruction before God came to destroy the Earth by water and this is against and both rejected the message of in in nowhere and deliverance so when the Waters of judgment came it took the believer to safety yeah but the unbeliever to death and torment will increase but notice today it is the gospel message that will destroy the unbelievers and take the believer to the Realms of Glory Allah Gloria and we'll Rapture the sons of God judgments the same word that spoke this world into existence it'll be the same word will speak it out of existence the word says I can do nothing until you come here there is such a disturbance among the people the churches are so different and on each other's throat there are so many visions of this message and they they separate and many says we have the truth there is a spiritual upon the ministry they want to be leaders they want to be pastors that's why it says in Revelation foreign I love you I had a vision or a dream um and uh I remember in this Vision or dream there was a white church on the side of the road and the other side of the road there was us a warehouse or a storehouse and uh I went inside the church in in the founding Pastor was preaching after the preaching was over me and this brother came out of the church we crossed the road through got into the warehouse and as we went in Ramos to write to the left ales there was a stairwell and he said this is a way to go up and it was dark and he started going up the steps and I I stood there and way down at the end yeah I saw a little light and I walk and walk and when I got to the light again there was a big Coke machine the Coca and I said wow and I kept looking at the uh at that machine made and he had a writing escrito and he said this is the real thing is there was a door knob and it was a door yeah and I walked in and there was stairwell yeah yeah well it was lighted is when I got to the top there was a big white room de Blanco and the founding Festival was sitting on the bench over there the church to over here and as I this is what are you doing here he said I am waiting foreign and we have been together until recently that he passed away we have never had a division the way we started that's the way it hasn't ended you know hallelujah hallelujah there is no love no I am more they separate and the holiday there's hardly no love no Unity when these things brother random said again look up your Redemption draws nights before one drop of rain fell until I went away yeah some was destroyed but lot was out of Salamence my angel told him he didn't do nothing until you get out the angel said I have the lever get on my hand pull and make the fires fall from Heaven and the angel of Destruction holding the hand of Russia with the atomic bombs until the church comes together and get the church in order but I can do nothing until you you you and myself get in order you still stay Northern periods don't die the spiritus the same Spirits those mismos espiritus uncondemned persons that could never be said people right now ismo did Noah have free food the third pool of Noah was to the lost when the door was shut up so in the days was the righteous lot lot then he sent two Messengers that was the second pool but notice more and more Mercy was given to saturnicorius he said more and more Mercy have been given to us he must record the Raptor have already taken place says that we are living on borrowed time this is because God's rich in Mercy doesn't us or our children or grandchildren or relatives to get lost look at the third messenger middle on the third pool in the tanks of laws that third message one get people the Lord stayed outside because if I could find Fifth you spare sodoms um if I could find 40. I will spare some what if there is I would not destroy Sarah if you could even find yes I will not destroy Sarah no this is Las Cruces I was written on the paper this woman from England you say you hear in England about 90 of the people none of them go to church who cares now to go to church and a lot of them just go because it it's a routine or a custom yeah but to us he says shown Mercy system if I could find 10 I would not destroy sarms do you know that the Rapture has not happened remember the righteous because of you even if in this congregation there was only one righteous persona foreign in do you know that it might be your righteous life is thus says William Brennan I see this is direct to Revelation 6 12. the regresso apocalypse says and this hair so much is I won't have the time to explain nothing else but let me read it again and I'd be held when he had opened the sixth Hill and Lord there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sackcloth of here and the moon became his blood yes is her timely fixed when she is shaking of a mighty winds is Heaven departed as a scroll when it is can you imagine see mahina this is the heaven and the heaven this is the heaven is the Bible says follow me here this these things are hard to understand this then difficult in there and the heaven departed as a scroll yes Genesis 1 6 and this is and God said let there be a fair moment in the midst of the waters and he divided the waters from the world is well what others Andrea what is Waters in the in the spiritual in domestic respiratory the people right yeah so I mean and we're supposed to be a separated people said are we supposed to have our own films you don't go to the dances or two bars or none of that we are a separated people because we went through the Truth where is the Jews still have to pass through there and they already have heifer with a red heifer they have to burn us and make the edges repented and got baptized in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's go to the beginning if we see and God called The Pyramid heaven and in it for the evening in the morning was the second day expansion Cielos Segundo remember the heavens will be Los Cielos God made three Bibles one in the heaven and one on paper [Music] but do you know with all three of them you know what they have done with those three Bibles yeah they have made Ouija boards voltry and it's all we have the the last threats has gone the three Bibles yes oh then you go to astrology oh let's go to the pyramid and look at the number of the stones and the way use understand the Holy Ghost the Bible to you Jesus how many Heavens are there how many have cuantos Cielos he had a firmamento so he said let there be light and when he said that the sun came into existence and Isaiah 40 22 is it is he that seeketh upon the circle of the Earth in thy inhabitants thereof are his grasshoppers that stretches out the heavens as a curtain and spread them out as a tend to dwelling is Los Cielos no no why is he stretching the heavens Psalms Uno the heavens declare the glory of God Manos to declare the glory of God Who is the history for the Gloria but I'd like Gloria videos and I can see a peace break from the Sun a false a few million years and he stops it is I remember years ago I know brother Fabio remembers yes I'm brother Bernie said he was playing with marbles it would it was like if you were playing with marbles is in that peace of the Sun like a mirror and then he would stop it and then get another one and then he would stop us what was he doing he was this blame the glory of God yes he was riding the first Bible is in the first constellation it was a dog he made it in heaven because human beings once look after the heavens and when he finished the heavens when he finished the heavens and rode his first Bible yes then he displayed who is a glorious videos all if you give light just loose you are one of those stars and one of those Stars it has your name cause you are children of the light without fear moment was separated from the waters from the people that are above the expansion that was a handy work that he was doing you know all the uh put him under Heavens is the heavens and one of those pieces from the Sun you know this is are you from the Sun whose dead is the soul you're a piece of the sun isn't he Our Father we are his sons and daughters okay okay crazy yes for you and you were coming even yes and says that's enough you stop right there yeah either the Twisters right there and that's what I heard your name is you know I don't know which star has your name with all our Father Abraham as if you can my notice as we turn the corner to finish here nothing you have light Isaiah 34 4. he said yesterday I could say much more but cut the time Isaiah 34 4 and all the hosts of Heaven shall be dissolved and the heaven shall be rolled together as a scroll an older homes shall fall down as thou live follows from the vine and as a fallen free from the fig tree that is foreign he was writing his first Bible is he was writing his first Bible yesterday so he had to head to something hard to write yes you know like we do so it was second Peter 3. knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own laws is and say where is the problem is coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation it is for this they only are ignorant of the water and in the water is whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved until fire against the day of judgment and Perdition of ungodly men so now we're going to find out why you rolled the heavens no unto the coming of the day of God or the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat is nevertheless here we go we according to his promise look for a new Heaven in a new world that is what he wrote the old Heaven Nosotros is righteousness you know why he did of this first Bible the constellation of Leo the Lion constellations and it is Judgment yes because brother random says to do that because we're living in what age are we living we're living in the age of cancer that's why those Heavens have to be rolling foreign
