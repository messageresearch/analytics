[38:17] steven amen i got to spend a little bit
[38:19] of time with him today
[38:23] took him to
[38:24] take him to up to the up to the organs
[38:29] and it's uh
[38:31] i told them it's a special place
[38:34] that's where my father always said
[38:36] that's only
[38:37] this year that's where the angel of the
[38:38] lord
[38:39] like to like to be yes
[38:44] so we have our uh our study this evening
[38:49] and the work
[38:50] shall be cut short
[38:53] amen let's turn into the book of matthew
[38:58] uh we're going to start with the
[39:03] had the hardest time just
[39:05] figuring out where we're where we're
[39:08] going to start
[39:11] and i pray the lord helps us
[39:15] so matthew 24.
[39:18] and um
[39:19] we're going to start with uh
[39:24] start with the
[39:27] with the
[39:28] fourth
[39:29] uh
[39:30] actually the third verse 24 3
[39:32] 2
[39:38] and it says and as
[39:40] he sat upon the mount of olives the
[39:42] disciples came unto him privately saying
[39:45] tell us
[39:46] when shall these things be
[39:49] and what shall be the sign of the coming
[39:52] and of the end of the world
[40:10] and jesus answered and said unto them
[40:13] take heed that no man deceive you
[40:16] responding
[40:21] we're going to jump up to verse 23.
[40:33] then if any man shall say unto you lo
[40:36] here is christ or there believe it
[40:47] for there shall arise false christs and
[40:50] false prophets
[40:54] and shall show great signs and wonders
[40:58] in so much that if it were possible
[41:04] they shall deceive the very elect
[41:09] verse 25 says behold
[41:12] i have told you before vinta
[41:17] amen may the lord have blessings to the
[41:19] reading of the word
[41:22] as we were uh as we were discussing this
[41:26] uh let me thank my i think brother
[41:28] brother abraham
[41:30] for for the time he's he's he's uh
[41:33] he's spent
[41:36] um
[41:39] we we unders we understand
[41:42] as we have listened to to these uh
[41:44] panels the last couple of weeks
[41:53] there's so much
[41:55] as you have seen in in the scriptures
[41:59] there is so much deception out there
[42:03] we all understand that correct society
[42:06] and
[42:07] we we uh
[42:09] we sometimes think
[42:12] that wow that
[42:14] that sounds that sounds pretty good
[42:18] we might we might listen to a song
[42:21] and the song might have a great rhythm
[42:26] the song might might have nice words
[42:30] but look at the deception even in what
[42:33] we call christian music
[42:37] christiana and it could be we could be
[42:39] uh we could be uh
[42:42] singing a song
[42:45] there's a there's a song that says holy
[42:47] holy
[42:48] question
[42:49] lord god almighty
[42:52] beautiful song
[42:54] then at the end of it
[42:56] we sing god
[43:05] and we don't realize the deception even
[43:08] in songs
[43:36] so the book of i i was uh
[43:40] the lord led me to this scripture in the
[43:42] book of habakkuk
[43:45] and i had really never
[43:48] studied or read much about habakkuk
[43:53] but have a cook in this in this book he
[43:55] is he is he is speaking about
[43:59] what feels like
[44:01] right now
[44:06] and it starts out in habakkuk 1-1
[44:11] it says the burden which habakkuk the
[44:13] prophet did see
[44:17] oh lord how long shall i cry and thou
[44:20] will not hear even cry out unto thee of
[44:24] violence
[44:34] violence
[44:37] how many have have have been in that
[44:39] situation
[44:42] or oh lord how long shall i cry
[44:47] verse 3 why does thou show me iniquity
[44:49] and cause me to behold grievance for
[44:52] spoiling and violence are before me
[44:55] and there are that raise up strife and
[44:58] contention
[45:13] and here's and here is a point that we
[45:15] get to sometimes
[45:28] so many times when we're looking for for
[45:31] judgment for other people
[45:34] like wow lord why why are you showing
[45:37] them mercy
[45:40] why are you giving them mercy
[45:43] shouldn't your shouldn't your judgment
[45:45] be upon them
[45:50] therefore the law is slacked
[45:52] and judgment doth never go forth
[45:56] for the wicked doth compass about the
[45:59] righteous therefore wrong judgment
[46:01] proceedeth
[46:17] verse 5 says behold ye among the heathen
[46:21] and regard
[46:23] and wonder
[46:24] marvelously
[46:26] for i will work
[46:28] a work in your days
[46:31] which ye will not be which you will not
[46:33] believe though it be told you
[46:38] yes
[46:53] that he will work
[46:56] in our day
[47:00] let's go to chapter two
[47:03] and here is here is habakkuk
[47:07] after he's after he's
[47:09] after he's saying these things about
[47:11] judgment
[47:14] he understands now
[47:16] now he says i will stand upon my watch
[47:22] set me upon the tower
[47:25] and we'll watch
[47:27] to see
[47:28] what he will say unto me
[47:31] and what i shall answer when i am
[47:33] reproved
[47:45] and the lord said
[47:48] excuse me and the lord answered me
[47:50] and said
[47:52] write the vision
[47:54] and make it plain upon tables
[47:57] that he may run that readeth it
[48:00] is
[48:14] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[48:17] time
[48:20] do you understand what what the
[48:21] appointed time means
[48:28] it's
[48:29] an appointed time
[48:30] it's a specific time
[48:36] but here here's

[51:08] flying by you know
[51:11] it's just fast
[51:14] it's just so quick
[51:17] i remember when
[51:19] my wife and i got engaged
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] it was the
[51:26] the it was in november of 1999
[51:32] in november of 1999 in
[51:34] november best buy was selling a y2k
[51:38] compatible vcr uh best buy stock
[51:44] a lot of kids like what they what's a
[51:46] vcr
[51:47] muchos
[51:50] what's y2k yes y2k
[51:55] so
[51:56] so at that time
[51:58] we're thinking oh my goodness
[52:01] the event of the year 2000 the event
[52:04] oh my gosh oh my computer is going to
[52:06] stop working
[52:09] i got to buy a new computer
[52:13] vcr
[52:14] buy all these new things
[52:17] something is going to happen in the year
[52:19] 2000.
[52:22] 2 000 comes along
[52:24] i get married in the year 2000.
[52:29] nothing happened
[52:35] a year later i had i had noah
[52:38] we had noah
[52:40] and 21 years later
[52:43] we're still here
[52:46] and it seems like
[52:48] that
[52:52] it has happened
[52:54] we ask ourselves as we get a little bit
[52:56] older
[53:12] and there has to come
[53:14] an
[53:15] end to the work
[53:18] brother branham says
[53:20] and this is the reason why
[53:22] this work must be cut short yes
[53:27] it says and jesus spoke of this
[53:30] jesus
[53:31] not as communism
[53:34] but in matthew the 24th chapter
[53:37] the 21st to the 26th verse
[53:41] he predicted that the spirit in this
[53:44] system
[53:47] and this is why the work has to be cut
[53:50] short at this time
[53:53] is that the spirit in this system el
[53:56] espiritu
[53:57] would be so much like the real thing
[54:04] till it would deceive the very elected
[54:21] it was possible
[54:31] whose names are put on the land's book
[54:33] of life
[54:49] until he said if he didn't cut the work
[54:53] short you know of course
[54:55] for their sake for beneficial today
[55:00] there would be no flesh saved upon the
[55:02] earth
[55:11] you know i was talking to brother
[55:13] stephen today around the corner steven
[55:15] and we were discussing the great work
[55:17] established
[55:18] that has
[55:32] into gulu
[55:35] and gulu in in the in the year of 2017.
[55:40] there was no message books
[55:44] and today
[55:45] there's over 15 message books five years
[55:48] later
[55:51] how has that happened
[55:54] fast
[55:55] god has moved in our day
[55:59] is doing a quick work
[56:15] if it keeps going on continuously the
[56:17] doctrines
[56:19] we don't even realize not really we're
[56:21] not even talking about
[56:23] uh
[56:24] the
[56:25] the uh the the denominational doctrines
[56:28] have
[56:43] if it goes on
[56:45] how much deception there would be
[56:47] deception
[56:51] the book of habakkuk again
[56:58] i want you to notice something here
[57:02] uh three one and two
[57:06] a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon
[57:10] us
[57:10] until
[57:18] oh lord i have heard thy speech and was
[57:21] afraid
[57:24] oh lord revive thy works
[57:28] and i want you to notice these uh this
[57:31] this phrase here
[57:33] in the midst of the years
[57:38] when we talk and we see in the midst of
[57:40] the years
[57:42] sometimes we think well it's the middle
[57:44] of the middle of the year june july
[57:49] it's actually a a hebrew a saying
[58:05] revive thy works
[58:07] between now and the end okay
[58:12] and
[58:13] and
[58:16] in wrath remember mercy
[58:21] so
[58:22] when you see between now and then
[58:26] it is a plea of habakkuk
[58:31] he is seeing all these things transpire
[58:48] he's seen
[59:03] but now you are revealing to me such
[59:06] terrible times
[59:09] lord there is no way we can go through
[59:11] this
[59:14] it is a plea of mercy and salvation
[59:18] salvation to cut your work short
[59:20] paracord
[59:22] hebrews 4 1 and squattrona
[59:35] and we'll go with verse
[59:37] verse 12. i was i was going to read a
[59:38] little bit more but we'll we'll we'll
[59:40] we'll just we'll just start with verse
[59:41] 12.
[59:44] and i want us and i want you to know
[59:48] why
[59:51] this word is so powerful
[59:56] for the word of god
[1:00:06] it says for the word of god
[1:00:11] many times when we look at cut shorts
[1:00:17] our our our mentality
[1:00:23] will think of
[1:00:24] maybe you were on vacation one time it
[1:00:26] was
[1:00:49] well that's not what it means yes or no
[1:00:51] let's look at significant so the so so
[1:00:53] the cardinal mind is saying
[1:01:01] and it means that he's not going to
[1:01:02] finish anything
[1:01:03] significant
[1:01:05] he's not going to he's not going to he's
[1:01:07] not going to finish what he started
[1:01:11] completely
[1:01:12] but what the bible says
[1:01:14] for the word of god is quick
[1:01:18] and powerful
[1:01:20] and sharper you must oh
[1:01:38] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:01:41] soul and spirit
[1:01:45] and of the joints and marrow
[1:01:49] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:01:52] intents of the heart
[1:01:56] for the word
[1:01:58] is quick
[1:02:03] and it it's cutting us at this moment
[1:02:10] so the lord says in closing here
[1:02:14] in revelations apocalypse actually let's
[1:02:16] go to
[1:02:17] before we do that we want to go to
[1:02:19] romans 9 28.
[1:02:22] yes
[1:02:34] and it says
[1:02:36] for he
[1:02:39] will finish the work
[1:02:44] and cut it short
[1:02:56] will the lord make upon the earth
[1:03:10] revelations 22 apocalypse
[1:03:23] and before we read 22 i i just want to
[1:03:25] read just one last quote here
[1:03:28] is
[1:03:38] how close are we
[1:03:42] brother branham says
[1:03:44] maybe later than we think he says
[1:03:47] see
[1:03:48] at any time
[1:03:53] maybe it's already happened
[1:03:56] oh my goodness all right for all we know
[1:04:00] i spoke the last sunday being here
[1:04:03] the last name might have been on that
[1:04:06] book
[1:04:08] when it is
[1:04:10] there is no more coming in
[1:04:14] the world will move on
[1:04:17] just as it was
[1:04:20] the world moves on el mundo
[1:04:23] it just keeps on going and going see
[1:04:25] you see
[1:04:27] but the church
[1:04:29] i want you to look at your neighbor
[1:04:31] and tell them
[1:04:38] can you give one to the lord for that
[1:04:43] and
[1:04:47] notice as we go on here
[1:04:51] their names now
[1:04:54] he will not
[1:04:56] deceive those
[1:04:57] whose names are written on
[1:05:04] what is it yes it's got to be a system
[1:05:08] and just think you know to belong to
[1:05:11] that denomination in that system
[1:05:17] where have you done yeah
[1:05:19] you're sealed away
[1:05:35] thereof
[1:05:37] it is the mark of the beast
[1:05:40] he says take some of these old movie
[1:05:42] actors
[1:05:46] they get up here and marry four or five
[1:05:48] times
[1:05:50] living with three or four different
[1:05:52] husbands at the same time
[1:05:55] some of these magazines exposing and
[1:05:57] telling them
[1:06:02] taking their pictures
[1:06:03] naked out here
[1:06:07] and you little girls set that as your
[1:06:09] example
[1:06:12] because your mommy before you
[1:06:15] perhaps your grandma may be before you
[1:06:17] say
[1:06:18] you see where that seat of the serpent
[1:06:20] works in certainly it is
[1:06:24] what and what's it done
[1:06:27] if iniquity
[1:06:29] is to visit
[1:06:30] to
[1:06:45] when the seed of the righteous is about
[1:06:48] worked out
[1:06:52] and god said
[1:06:54] there would come a time
[1:06:56] if he didn't cut the work short
[1:07:22] i want you to notice something
[1:07:25] he says
[1:07:27] this three times
[1:07:28] in the last
[1:07:30] in the last
[1:07:31] book
[1:07:32] and the last chapter of the bible
[1:07:40] behold i come quickly
[1:07:44] blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
[1:07:46] of the prophecy of this book
[1:07:53] and behold
[1:07:55] i come quickly
[1:07:57] and my reward is with me
[1:08:00] to give every man according as his work
[1:08:03] shall be
[1:08:07] verse 20
[1:08:12] that's what habakkuk would was saying
[1:08:14] right
[1:08:15] surely
[1:08:18] come
[1:08:19] quickly
[1:08:21] and why okay because if he doesn't do it
[1:08:24] quickly
[1:08:26] there's no seed shall be saved
[1:08:34] and that's why the work has to be done
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:45] and
[1:08:52] thank you william
[1:08:55] william
[1:08:56] the word cut short goes
[1:08:58] with
[1:08:59] what we're gonna speak now
[1:09:01] uh
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:16] foreign
[1:09:22] well
[1:09:24] i guess
[1:09:26] i'm over 25.
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:31] don't let one of these days you'll be uh
[1:09:38] yeah you know what you're gonna be my
[1:09:40] reader
[1:09:42] i'll give you the scriptures and you
[1:09:43] read them okay in english
[1:09:47] say in matthew 24
[1:09:49] verses 21 and 22 go ahead
[1:09:51] for then shall be great tribulation such
[1:09:54] as what
[1:09:55] as was not since
[1:09:57] the beginning of the world to this time
[1:10:09] and except those days should be
[1:10:10] shortened there
[1:10:12] there should no flesh be saved but for
[1:10:14] the elect's sake those days shall be
[1:10:17] shortened
[1:10:24] ah they will be shortened
[1:10:27] but i'm going to hit first the
[1:10:29] scientific way
[1:10:33] then the scriptural way
[1:10:36] is
[1:10:37] the earthquake in chile
[1:10:41] may have shortened the
[1:10:46] it was the seventh strongest quake ever
[1:10:49] recorded in history
[1:10:54] it may have
[1:10:56] shifted the earth
[1:10:59] axis
[1:11:03] the massive can you imagine 8.8
[1:11:07] in the
[1:11:08] similar magnitude
[1:11:11] the earthquake that stuck struck chile
[1:11:16] may have changed the entire rotation of
[1:11:20] the earth
[1:11:23] and shorten the length of days
[1:11:29] on our planet
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:38] the seven strongest in recorded history
[1:11:41] el ceptimo gravado mas fuerte in
[1:11:43] historia
[1:11:45] and should have shortened the length of
[1:11:48] an earth day
[1:11:52] elaboration perhaps more impressive
[1:11:57] is how much the quake shifted the excess
[1:12:01] of the earth
[1:12:06] they have that it should have moved
[1:12:09] earth
[1:12:10] figure excess by about three inches
[1:12:18] the earth figure excess
[1:12:29] which spins around once every day
[1:12:34] at a speed
[1:12:36] of a thousand miles per hour
[1:12:40] much more i could say mucho mas
[1:12:43] pouriales but i want you to learn
[1:12:45] the spiritual way pero quiero que even
[1:12:55] for
[1:12:57] our father abraham mr father abraham he
[1:13:01] waited 25 years for
[1:13:16] so i could answer this question to you
[1:13:19] people
[1:13:21] respond
[1:13:22] to this
[1:13:23] like i told caleb
[1:13:27] we don't know the answer
[1:13:30] he said you they call
[1:13:42] we have probed and presumed so much on
[1:13:45] this question
[1:13:50] but let us go a little further
[1:13:54] it's talking about the it says
[1:13:57] on the
[1:13:58] on those days the great tribulation and
[1:14:00] i can use diaz
[1:14:02] now in that time
[1:14:05] when he was speaking there on matthew
[1:14:07] 24.
[1:14:10] read
[1:14:10] saint matthew 24 16
[1:14:18] then let them which be in judea flee
[1:14:22] into the mountains
[1:14:25] why do they want to flee to the
[1:14:27] mountains
[1:14:29] let's go a little further
[1:14:31] tomorrow
[1:14:34] and woe unto them that are with child
[1:14:38] and welcome
[1:14:40] and to them that give suck in those days
[1:14:47] why okay
[1:14:49] there was a tribulation
[1:14:55] but pray ye that your flight be not in
[1:14:58] the winter
[1:14:59] neither on the sabbath
[1:15:04] the prophet had already prophesied
[1:15:22] you i do studies fine
[1:15:25] because they especially they had to run
[1:15:28] in the wintertime
[1:15:31] well brother run says in judea sometimes
[1:15:33] he gets five
[1:15:34] feet deep in snow this
[1:15:54] on the sabbath in jerusalem they would
[1:15:56] close the doors nobody could go in and
[1:15:59] out
[1:16:03] was a
[1:16:04] tribulation
[1:16:06] when general titus came and put us
[1:16:10] offense of soldiers around jerusalem
[1:16:16] so it it says and the scripture that we
[1:16:19] read
[1:16:21] that the days had to be shown on account
[1:16:25] of the elect
[1:16:29] these people that were caught inside
[1:16:32] were not the elections
[1:16:50] and their days were not shortened
[1:16:53] they stayed there until they ran out of
[1:16:55] food
[1:16:58] brother venom said he said mother
[1:16:59] branham god will not reveal until he
[1:17:02] sees fear
[1:17:04] that you need it
[1:17:08] in its season
[1:17:10] in 1962
[1:17:13] five planets aligned themselves
[1:17:17] and brother brethren says this is i
[1:17:20] predict
[1:17:21] this has a spiritual application
[1:17:24] application spiritual i believe
[1:17:27] there is the coming of the issue of god
[1:17:35] the great revelations of the world
[1:17:40] will be opened during this time
[1:17:45] and that's what you're hearing on sunday

[1:18:47] except those days they would not be
[1:18:50] shortened
[1:18:57] one and two apocalypse
[1:19:09] and i saw another sign in heaven
[1:19:12] great and marvelous
[1:19:15] seven angels having the seven last
[1:19:18] plagues
[1:19:19] for in them is filled up the wrath of
[1:19:22] god
[1:19:30] and i saw
[1:19:32] as it were a sea of glass
[1:19:34] mingled with fire
[1:19:36] and them that had gotten the victory
[1:19:39] over the beast
[1:19:40] and over his image
[1:19:42] and over his mark
[1:19:44] and over the number of his name
[1:19:46] stand on the sea of glass
[1:20:02] can you see the wrath of god
[1:20:06] what is the wrath of god
[1:20:10] it is the great tribulation
[1:20:15] when john saw this sea of glass when the
[1:20:18] juan vio este marde crystal it was clear
[1:20:21] as crystal oh
[1:20:24] you know why
[1:20:27] because we weren't there anymore
[1:20:30] we had raptured
[1:20:51] the church age was over termina
[1:20:55] but we see here in chapter 15.
[1:21:11] standing in the sea of glass
[1:21:14] or the sea of breaths
[1:21:18] which means judgment significa
[1:21:22] that was filled with fire and blood
[1:21:24] establish
[1:21:27] the fire of god
[1:21:30] but now
[1:21:32] they have gone the victory over the
[1:21:34] beast
[1:21:35] victorious
[1:21:36] his name
[1:21:38] the image
[1:21:40] which is the confederation of churches
[1:21:44] watch that time here vigil
[1:21:48] we see jacob
[1:21:51] he had to pass through our tribulation
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:32] he left the family and everything on
[1:22:35] this side of the river familiar
[1:22:46] because he was afraid of his brother
[1:22:48] that was coming after him
[1:23:00] and that night he wrestled with an angel
[1:23:32] he struggled with him until the breaking
[1:23:35] of days
[1:23:38] and because of the victory
[1:23:41] his name was changed from jacob to
[1:23:44] illinois
[1:24:07] and at that time
[1:24:09] shall michael stand up
[1:24:11] the great prince which standeth for the
[1:24:14] children of thy people
[1:24:21] and there shall be a time of trouble
[1:24:24] the time of travel is called jacob's
[1:24:27] problem
[1:24:40] such as never was since there was a
[1:24:43] nation
[1:24:45] even to that same time
[1:24:48] and at that time thy people shall be
[1:24:51] delivered
[1:24:52] every one that shall be found written in
[1:24:55] the book yeah
[1:25:04] michael was standing for the 144
[1:25:08] thousands
[1:25:13] they see the genuine thing
[1:25:17] there stands moses and elijah paramount
[1:25:22] then they will wrestle with god
[1:25:25] until a hundred and
[1:25:27] forty four thousand are called
[1:25:32] isaiah sixty six
[1:25:34] seven two nineteen
[1:25:52] before she travailed she brought forth
[1:25:56] before her pain came
[1:25:58] she was delivered of a manchild
[1:26:06] who hath heard such a thing
[1:26:08] who hath seen such things
[1:26:11] shall the earth be made to bring forth
[1:26:14] at once
[1:26:18] excuse me shall the earth be made to
[1:26:19] bring forth in one day or shall a nation
[1:26:23] be born at once
[1:26:25] for as soon as zion travailed
[1:26:28] she brought forth her children
[1:26:50] there has to be a reason why those 144
[1:26:54] 000 had to be
[1:26:56] chosen right away
[1:27:01] i

[1:27:44] one and two apocalypses says unidos
[1:27:57] and i saw when the lamb opened
[1:28:00] one of the seals
[1:28:02] and i heard as it were the noise of
[1:28:04] thunder
[1:28:06] and one of the four beasts saying come
[1:28:08] and see
[1:28:18] and i saw and behold a white horse
[1:28:21] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[1:28:24] crown was given unto him and he went
[1:28:26] forth conquering and to conquer him
[1:28:36] notice
[1:28:38] two things
[1:28:40] psa in those
[1:28:49] matthew 24 23 and 24. mateo antiquatron
[1:28:59] then if any man shall say unto you lo
[1:29:02] here is christ
[1:29:04] or there
[1:29:05] believe it not
[1:29:11] for there shall arise false christs and
[1:29:14] false prophets
[1:29:16] and shall and shall show great signs and
[1:29:19] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:29:22] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:29:25] elect
[1:29:34] the indebted white horse rider deceived
[1:29:36] many
[1:29:42] because he was riding a white horse
[1:29:45] because we all thought even brother
[1:29:47] brandon thought that that was christ
[1:30:04] he was deceiving the people established
[1:30:08] how does he deceive come in
[1:30:10] verse 27
[1:30:19] for as a lightning cometh out of the
[1:30:21] east
[1:30:22] and shineth even into the west
[1:30:24] so shall also the coming of the son of
[1:30:26] man becomes
[1:30:45] yes
[1:30:48] and he said unto them
[1:30:51] i beheld satan as lightning
[1:30:54] fall from heaven
[1:31:00] i'd like to give you scriptures so that
[1:31:02] you can study at home
[1:31:06] second corinthians 11 14.
[1:31:14] and no marvel for satan himself
[1:31:18] is transformed into an angel of light
[1:31:27] there he is an angel of light
[1:31:31] well carlos was in that his name lucifer
[1:31:36] lucifer
[1:31:38] significa
[1:31:40] that he carried the line
[1:31:42] he
[1:32:03] therefore rejoice ye heavens
[1:32:06] and ye that dwell in them
[1:32:09] woe to the inhabiters of the earth
[1:32:12] and of the sea
[1:32:14] for the devil is come down unto you
[1:32:17] having great wrath
[1:32:19] because he knoweth
[1:32:20] that he hath
[1:32:22] but a short time
[1:32:38] and the days were shortened
[1:32:44] with great breath
[1:32:46] because he's got such a short period
[1:32:52] so when he fell like lightning
[1:32:56] he made his headquarters
[1:32:59] in the bottomless pit
[1:33:04] full of locusts and scorpions
[1:33:12] what's here jerry
[1:33:15] they have er a king over them
[1:33:30] exactly what the white house writer came
[1:33:33] from except
[1:34:03] and they had a king over them
[1:34:06] which is the angel of the bottomless pit
[1:34:09] whose name in the hebrew tongue is
[1:34:11] abaddon
[1:34:12] but in the greek tongue hath his name
[1:34:15] apollyon
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:44] the first world war
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:35:10] it was on the 11th
[1:35:13] 11 minutes to 11 o'clock
[1:35:18] on
[1:35:19] the 11th month on the 11th day in el dia
[1:35:24] in el misonse november the 11th and 11th
[1:35:26] month
[1:35:28] that's why they were the 11th hour
[1:35:30] workers
[1:35:34] stop the wins foreign
[1:35:56] something had to happen
[1:35:59] because they were scattered in china in
[1:36:02] russia
[1:36:05] so something had to happen
[1:36:08] to bring them back to the homeland
[1:36:12] because a lot of those are hundred and
[1:36:14] forty four thousand days
[1:36:17] some of them right were in the womb of
[1:36:18] their mothers
[1:36:22] yes
[1:36:30] to get the same baptism
[1:36:34] of the holy ghost the spirit
[1:37:03] the second war was passed and behold the
[1:37:06] third woe cometh quickly
[1:37:12] the second was the second world war
[1:37:18] but the last one is coming quickly
[1:37:22] so the days have to be short
[1:37:25] it's coming quickly
[1:37:31] last
[1:37:43] and the sixth angel sounded and i heard
[1:37:45] a voice from the four horns of the

[1:37:59] trumpet
[1:38:00] loose the four angels which are bound in
[1:38:03] the great river euphrates
[1:38:11] and the four angels were loosed
[1:38:13] which were prepared for an hour and a
[1:38:15] day
[1:38:16] and a month
[1:38:17] and a year
[1:38:19] for to slay the third part of men
[1:38:28] who are these four angels
[1:38:32] we see the six angels again
[1:38:41] revelation 16 12 in apocalypse yes
[1:38:54] and the sixth angel poured out his vial
[1:38:56] upon the great river euphrates
[1:38:59] and the water thereof was dried up
[1:39:01] that the way
[1:39:02] of the kings of the east might be
[1:39:04] prepared in sixth one

[1:40:19] i was soloing officina and i wasn't even
[1:40:21] praying to god to give me the answer
[1:40:29] because

[1:42:33] and the stars shall fall from heaven
[1:42:35] and the powers of the heavens shall be
[1:42:37] shaken
[1:42:50] and then shall appear the sign of the
[1:42:52] son of man in heaven
[1:42:54] and then shall all the tribes of the
[1:42:55] earth mourn
[1:42:57] and they shall see the son of man coming
[1:42:59] in the clouds of heaven with power and
[1:43:02] great glory
[1:43:04] allah
[1:43:13] and he shall send his angels with a
[1:43:15] great sound of a trumpet
[1:43:17] and they shall gather together his elect
[1:43:20] from the four winds
[1:43:22] from one
