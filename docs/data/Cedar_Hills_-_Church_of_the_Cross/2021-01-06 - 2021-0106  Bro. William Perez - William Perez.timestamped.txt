[30:32] for for a while
[30:38] and we're going to go into exodus
[30:40] chapter 20.
[30:46] and we're going to start with uh verse 6
[30:53] and showing mercy unto thousands of them
[30:56] that love
[30:56] me and keep my commandments
[31:06] thou shalt not take the name of the lord

[32:18] in in your place father
[32:22] asked that you were just you would just
[32:24] help us this
[32:25] this evening in the name of the lord
[32:29] jesus christ
[32:31] amen amen you may be seated
[32:35] um as um as i was uh
[32:39] as i was kind of looking to what this
[32:42] year
[32:42] was was going to bring me
[32:46] back you know i in
[32:49] uh in a couple of months you know you
[32:52] know this
[32:52] this year's this year is a milestone for
[32:55] me
[32:58] [Music]
[33:02] i'm going to be um in in march i'm going
[33:04] to be 40 years old
[33:05] and marco yeah
[33:10] the lord for that gracias you know and
[33:13] and as i was as i was pondering my life
[33:17] here
[33:20] you know you you there's certain
[33:22] scriptures that you have read
[33:24] hundreds and hundreds of times
[33:29] and sometimes when you read them again
[33:31] they you know you just keep on you just
[33:33] keep on going through them
[33:38] and maybe at that time they don't mean
[33:40] much to you
[33:44] maybe at that time there are certain
[33:48] things that are not revealed to you yet
[34:17] that for a brief moment
[34:21] they look for a for a temporary fix
[34:26] for something that's that's going to
[34:29] fill
[34:29] what they what they long for
[34:48] that will take away the feeling of
[34:50] emptiness
[34:55] and it took me to the fourth commandment
[35:02] thou shall not take the name of the lord
[35:05] thy god
[35:06] in vain
[35:09] and many times when we read this
[35:11] scripture
[35:14] while we first think about
[35:17] well it's it's it's saying um it's
[35:20] saying a cuss word
[35:23] it's cursing god saying bad words
[35:56] what
[36:11] [Music]
[36:25] bless me bendy bless me help me
[36:29] bless me and we realized
[36:33] that through it all we're taking
[36:38] or i'm taking it
[37:04] and he's looking at us
[37:08] you're praying for the exact same thing
[37:09] over and over
[37:13] you're praying for healing i've already
[37:16] done it
[37:19] you're praying for salvation
[37:28] my goodness moses
[37:31] spent 40 years thinking he was somebody
[37:45] and 40 years discovering what god can do
[37:48] with the nobody
[38:01] brings me to the book of romans de los
[38:05] romanos
[38:06] you know this year or 2020 i should say
[38:11] the official mascot of 2020.
[38:30] so official mascot of 2020 was a raccoon
[38:37] well they say that the raccoon
[38:41] is always washing his hands
[38:47] you see him he's always wearing a mask
[38:52] right correcto and if you
[38:56] if you jumble the words around or the
[38:58] letters around of raccoons
[39:04] you can spell corona
[39:08] corona in english so it's the official
[39:11] mascot of 2020.
[39:16] but there's there's there's something
[39:19] that i
[39:19] that i discovered about this little
[39:21] animal
[39:25] and we'll get to that in the book of
[39:26] romans chapter 6
[39:28] verse 23.
[39:36] my wife is always asking me what are you
[39:38] going to preach on
[39:39] animal wise
[39:56] you know before i read the rest of this
[40:01] you know sometimes i can't even get
[40:03] through a
[40:04] entire entire verse without just
[40:07] just thinking about other stuff
[40:12] so i couldn't get past wages
[40:16] it says for the wages

[42:51] for the wages of sin
[42:56] is muerte
[42:59] there's no other thing beyond that
[43:04] there's it doesn't say for the wages of
[43:06] sin
[43:09] you're gonna get a slap on the wrist
[43:14] no because there is something that you
[43:16] have to pay for in the end
[43:23] amen amen

[1:03:09] profitable
[1:03:10] to thee and to me whom i have sent again
[1:03:15] thou therefore receive him receive him
[1:03:17] that is mine own
[1:03:18] that is my that is my known vows whom i
[1:03:21] would have retained with me
[1:03:23] that in thy stead he might have
[1:03:25] ministered unto me in the bonds of the
[1:03:27] gospel
[1:03:28] but without thy mind would i do nothing
[1:03:31] that thy benefit should not be as it
[1:03:34] were of necessity
[1:03:35] but willingly for perhaps
[1:03:39] he therefore departed for a season

[1:04:27] but he's no more a slave
[1:04:30] he spent a little bit of time with paul
[1:04:34] and paul is saying he was a servant
[1:04:38] when he left
[1:04:52] but even even though he was one of us
[1:04:56] even though he's a brother now okay
