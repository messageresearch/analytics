church amen praise the Lord Brother Jimmy the older you get the crazier you get I'm sure you're used to me by now and you know if we if we didn't love one another we wouldn't even stand up here we're going to speak something that doesn't sound like it goes with the season tonight a little bit Yeah but it does and it's called the Great Center of power in the universe turn to your neighbor and say would you like to know what that great Center of power is oh maybe it's way off in space somewhere my praise the Lord so I guess this isn't working tonight so end up turning around don't want to do that so let's go ahead and turn in our scriptures we going start with Luke the second chapter and we're going to start with verse 6 and read through verse [Music] 11 and this is the scripture used for the Christmas message and and we all understand that uh Jesus was not born on the 25th of December we understand that what we're going to read here that the Shepherds were watching their sheep by night and in the winter time there in Palestine there's about two or three feet of snow on those mountains and the Sheep are in the coral number two when are lambs born Springtime but I don't want to go into that just just so we understand when Jesus was really born let's start reading with verse six and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth the her firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling clothes laid him in a Manger because there was no room for him in the end and there were in that same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and Lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be for all of the people in Los cres New Mexico and let's let's read verse 11 together real slow for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David which is savior which is Christ the Lord let us pray Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts Lord we bless your holy name God we thank you for this privilege Lord and we just commit oursel into your hands Lord Jesus in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen you may be seated where would this great Center of power be in the universe let's give the definition of the word Universe first and one of the more humanly definitions of universe is the world of Human Experience so if you're in God's Universe you've got to be in his world where you can have an experience with him how many came to have an experience with him tonight amen amen now this next definition of Universe I'm going to read real slow so that you can pick up on something here it states this is Webster's Dictionary by the way Webster and man does the very best he can to try to understand these things even though he's limited so we're not saying that all these definitions are exactly this this way right but part of it shows what's inside of man and what he's crying out for and why he feels the way he feels how many of you have ever felt powerless nobody oh you have hands okay how many of you have felt powerless well I could do this too right but God has a great Center of power in the universe how many would like to tap into that tonight my we could get into some good stuff here now this definition says a systematic whole words all that's complete that makes a hold o l e a systematic H held to arise by and persist to the direct intervention of divine power wow wow everything is going to be held together it's going to be able to rise up by and and it's going to be able to persist by the divine intervention of God's power and that's why you and I are here tonight now as we start this I want to read this first quote praise the Lord Jesus I think they're going to put it up here yes that's it but let me get it on my tablet since this isn't working I got it right here oh it's in the back if I can see it okay now we could have God get in continuity amongst the Medics and amongst the scientists and different ones no if Einstein only had the spiritual application as he had the physical application as he studied the laws of light and so forth he could have told us something when I heard his message on that great Center s somewhere in the skies oh man he heard a message from Einstein well he was tremendous in the Physical Realm but the prophet saying if he could have got the spiritual application of what he was seeing watch what would happen that ever contacted with that Center you could create Earth do anything and the power would be unlimited my how many still want to get into the center of God's great power in this universe somewhere okay now going to go back before there was light we've got to find out where this great Center is let's go to Exodus chapter 20 amen praise the Lord Jesus and we're starting with Verse 18 I believe yes and all the people saw the Thunders and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and of the mountains smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood a far off they got scared do you still know today that most people are scared of the super natural moving of God and in a symbolic way we we let God come this close and we go okay that's far enough that's far enough next verse 19 and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak to us lest we die well that's how serious it was imagine seeing the mountain shaking lightning and smoke and they say hey hey we don't want nothing to do with that next verse and Moses said unto the people fear not for God is come to prove you and that he his fear may be before your faces that ye s not oh he wants to prove what's on the inside of us he wants to prove that we are elect yes he he want as much as he declared that this is my beloved Son hear ye him he wants to declare this is my beloved bride pleased to dwell don't listen to me no more listen to her and you understand in what sense I'm saying that without going into details verse 21 and the people stood a far off and Moses Drew near unto the thick Darkness where God was I thought God was light he's dwelling in darkness then what's all this lightning and smoke and and pillars of fire those things are just a sign that he's real close by but Moses had to go into the thick Darkness where God was and many people say how is it that God is light and yet he he was in darkness that word dark there or darkness in the Hebrew does not mean night like it is right now it's referring to enter into a place of the unknown and he was the only one predestinated of God to go into that place where there was nothing all these manifestations that were happening on the mountain show that he was there but there had to be somebody that could go in there where he was and it was unknown to the people it's not that it was night time let me ask you could that be the great Center of power Universe oh I got you thinking that's good amen amen we'll get to that give me that the second quote we've got up there amen then when I came back to this place and I had been thinking when I said limit that meant five squirrels which is the limited Indiana indana but I remember last year when he asked me how many did it take for me a mess I said three I just got the three how manyan you know he killed Three Squirrels they appeared he with a rifle and he goes is that a vision and then he goes and picks it up oh Visions don't bleed how many remember three and I just got the three so yesterday I went back and and was going to the same place again and something said do not go cross the road was he couldna go into the great Center of power what was going to happen now God was going to move in a different way and it wasn't going to even be in the same place where he killed the first [Music] three amen let's continue amen and exactly 10:00 on the exact dot 10 o00 with my watch I shot the Indiana limit of five and I want you to not notice there was there rainbows and there was three things said three Scrolls gotten Three Squirrels by 10 o00 and the Sun was shining and 30 minutes and there were three things to give Witness brother Woods Bank Woods Bank brother Billy Paul Billy Paul and his son David and they gave witness to it amen and he goes on to say that these three rainbows all came into one and as he was walking through the canyon he heard a voice Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new oh Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ I want you to notice in the scripture in Luke after this baby was born this this gift that had been wrapped in human flesh the announcement was he is Christ the lord from the time that named Jesus from the time that Jesus was spoken by the angel to Mary and mared to Joseph and mared to Elizabeth Elizabeth they were the only ones that had heard the audable name of Jesus it was still a secret to the public and God here wants them to know when he declares it and the angels come down and sing he wants them to know what this baby really is before the human name of God is spoken to them because otherwise if Jesus was [Applause] born he's just a man his name is Jesus but this baby that was born was Christ the anointed one the Lord God that spoke to Moses in thick darkness that was unknown that was beginning to form a great Center of power oh that great Center had not yet been formed yet he didn't want them to hear the name of Jesus yet he want them to know what Jesus was he was the Anointed God Christ the Lord praise and living name of our God so was that the great Center of power in the universe oh that's right where it started oh but I don't want to leave nobody out let's read our next scripture in Psalms 139 11 through 15 to see what this thick Darkness was and why you you couldn't understand it and how God hid it verse 11 now everybody know here that David thealist is speaking in the personal pronoun I if I say and when he says if I say that's talking about Christ Lord is talking about the anointed one he's talking about the Messiah if I say surely the Darkness shall cover me no wonder what Moses had to go into the thick Darkness that's where you are going to find the anointed Messiah beginning formed next verse yes the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day and the Darkness as the light are both alike to thee they're the same to you it is the same in other words God's not it's not okay it's night time no no signific oh it's daytime Cosmic light he's not going doing anything based on what we know as light and darkness as humans but it's something that's unknown it's something that's never happened in the human race before next verse I will praise thee for for thou Hast possessed my ring thou has covered me in my mother's W you couldn't see him he was hidden God covered him God protected him God created his own incubator as our founding Pastor would say there was a womb created inside of her room no cell that was contaminated with sin could touch that Holy thing so God covered him in his mother's womb oh do you see the great power coming forth yet what do you think James James is that the great Center of power what do you anybody else is that it is that is that all there is to it amen let's read the next verse I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right right well and all many see right there is the Messiah but do you want to know where you are at this point in the scripture where are you where is the life that God was going to put in you and this point of the unfolding of this great Center of power something that would be in relation to Human Experience something that would hold this world together and help us persist and only persist by God's divine intervention have to come from this great Center somewhere out there that like Einstein said Einstein but if it just stayed out here somewhere you couldn't have contact with it then it would do you no good God was going to have to bring it to where you could touch the H of His Garment where you could touch him and he could be touched of you touched by the feeling of your infirmities hallelujah hallelujah where were you you were being formed in God's Great Center of power you following me let's go to our next quote amen law having a shadow and God being manifested in the flesh with Christ Jesus the anoint let's say it together Christ Jesus the anointed wrapped himself in a bloodelf wow wow that's he was going to form this great Center of power and bring it from the god of the universe to an amateur God on Earth so that that power that was way out some where like Einstein said Einstein would no longer be way out there somewhere it would be made blessed we were going to be able to touch him he was is going to be able to touch us amen amen he wrapped himself oh before you he could wrap the gifts and before he could be wrapped in swaddling clothes he had to be wrapped in a blood cell oh oh why I it's getting a little white in here it's getting good thank you is that it is that is that all there is to the great Center of power in the universe remember this is Jimmy now speak as a man once in a while uni uni which means one in itself verse there has to be a verse that unites us unse what is that verse in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made blessed and dwelt among us and we beheld let's say it together and we beheld the glory of the father as if he's the only begotten Son of God full of grace full of Truth where were you you were inside of what made him full of grace and truth you were a part of his grace were a part of his truth he was forming you in this great Center of power because he did not want you to remain powerless he wanted you to come to your day where you could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation just like Mary had no sensation man had nothing to do with it everybody say see so you shouldn't have any emotion you just be Stone fa in church and be all quiet and look like a brick no it comes into your soul without sensation but when that power begins to move inside the center of your heart has to produce emotion it has to produce sensation says any religion that has no emotion you better bury it dead hallelujah hallelujah the blood cell Oh my he goes in the womb of Mary and brought forth his life he lived a man no he lived a man no he lived a man he was not just a supernatural being that made a body out of nothing and appeared no no he wouldn't even be human if he did that much less fulfill the law of the kinsman redeemer he literally had to be related to the human race we're not going to go into that but all I can tell you he's my bigger brother he's my older brother not just spiritually he took on the form brother Brenham says of sinful flesh that that's a rough one okay he lived a man he died a man to give his blood that through his body and the shedding of his blood that every believer could be wrapped in the blood cell with him every believer how many of you are believers your life would have to be wrapped in that blood cell that was inside of him there's your great Center of power that's be coming from outer space somewhere now it's walking on two feet oh now he's a man now the spiritual Gene of who you are is walking in him he's going to walk in his word so what are you going to do when you receive the life of the blood cells you're going to walk the same way you already walked before you're going to to continue to walk with him because it's not you it's him in you and who said hallelujah hallelujah oh but she's born again which is a born again Spirit of a man wrapped in the blood cell of the son of God and God can no more deny you than he could deny himself one Spirit we're all baptized into one body become partakers of The Same Spirit become partakers of the great Center of power in my universe cuz I'm a ver i a word a thought expressed un the one God Church Universe where is where are you in your universe is there a great Su of power in You by One Spirit we're all baptized into one body part ERS of the same spirit that this blood cell and the church is wrapped in the blood cell of the life of Jesus Christ Hallelujah then we will be sons of God we hope we're sons of God then we are of God joints with Jesus Christ in the Kingdom hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus let's go to our third quote in God's wrapped gift amen it ought to be real attractive to the people little Jehovah crying like a baby God made flesh in a package now he can be a package he was wrapped first in a blood cell now he's made a package in flesh God wrapped the life first before he wrapped the flesh and that's exactly what he's doing with the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God who covers all space and time was before there was a world or star or molecule wrapped himself in a little package and was laid in a Manger and I and you were in him are you getting it really see amen amen good good I want you to so this world is not my home I'm only passing through here I have no permanent City here because I was born in that manger when Christ the lord was formed and the angels I kind of think my angel was singing with them he knew that someday I would come to Earth because I had been wrapped in the blood cells now I was wrapped in the package now all we got to do is unwrap the package you guys want to unwrap the package want unwrap the package amen let's finish reading this quote and then we'll two more scriptures [Music] and wrapped himself in a little package and was l in the manger in a stable where the manure of the cattle and sheep and things up over the stable in this little manger on strong Jehovah was laying there crying like a baby could you imagine it I just kind of want to Rapture out of here well you know we're already in the Rapture right are you in the Rapture have you heard the shout the message of preparation now let's go to our next scripture in Ephesians 3 verses 7 through 11 now Paul begins to say how this gift that came out of God's WRA gift came to him and he begins to declare what part he is in the power of that great Center of power wherefore I am made a minister according the gift of the grace of God give given unto me by the effectual working of his power don't tell me he didn't have contact with that great Center of power he had found out who he was in God's plan have you found out who you are in verse and unto me who am the least than the and the less than the least of All Saints is this gift given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men know what is the Fellowship of the mystery notice in Spanish it say dispensation in English it says fellowship and The Fellowship of the mystery the mystery wants to have Fellowship what part of the mystery is in you my brother my sister my brothers and sisters all over here if you have received life from that blood cell of the Holy Ghost part of the mystery is in you and that mystery in you and me wants to have Fellowship oh it's a dispensation oh nothing wrong with saying that mystery wants to have Fellowship which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God oh it was hid in that thick Darkness wasn't it who created All Things by Jesus Christ amen our last scripture 2 Thessalonians 1 verse so how do you know the gifts been unwrapped how many knows that one once you grow in the stature of a perfect man you're born down here in faith and when you have faith your bar is born now you're going to grow Faith virtue you grow all the way up to brotherly love what's the Capstone what's it called charity love right we're going to see right here that the Thessalonians had been unwrapping the gift that was in them do you want to unwrap the gift that's in you the Church of the Living God lacks in no gift and there's many times when the holy spirit's moving and I'm not going to harp on this it's something youve got to enter into the thick Darkness you got to go into the unknown and so this gift in you begins to manifest the gifts so many times are all over this platform speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues discernment prophecy knowledge Miracles healings most churches in the message don't even want the gifts but we do and we've always had those gifts manifested here and they will be manifested until the coming of the Lord what am I trying to say with all this he's trying to unwrap your gift so that you know what it is and it can be a blessing to God's people amen amen we are bound to thank God always for you let's say that we are bound to thank God always for you we are bound to thank God all some of the time always Brethren as it is meat leave my scripture up there there it is it is meat because that your faith growth exceedingly oh that great Center of power unfolding the gift that's in you how's it doing it and the charity of every one of you let's say that and the charity of every one of you you you me you us the charity of all of us toward each other abund abound have we got that gift manifested to that point yet it's grown so much that the charity the Divine love the the cap Stone every one of you all towards each other abound We Stand our in other words there's nothing hindering that love anymore because God's Great Center of power has been manifested in us as the prophet would say oh then where is it today brother it's in a little compartment in your heart about the size of your thumbnail where when he gets in there he controls you it's his control tower the way he made himself in a great Center of power you now have have a great Center of power inside a little [Music] compartment and from there he can express himself manifest his love manifest any miracle for the greatest Miracle there [Music] is is Christ in US Lord Jesus we just thank you tonight Lord oh God we there's enough power here to create worlds oh that great Center of power is no longer out there somewhere lord it's right in your bride Lord Jesus and if the people would just ask what they want in the name of the Lord Jesus why God you would do it Lord because they would grow exceedingly and the love of God would abound and all there would be would be love for one another agap love divine love oh God that's what our heart cries out for tonight we believe it and we speak it in the name of Jesus for your honor and your glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God bless [Music] [Music] you oh Oh Glory praise him [Music] tonight oh he [Music] [Music] spee
