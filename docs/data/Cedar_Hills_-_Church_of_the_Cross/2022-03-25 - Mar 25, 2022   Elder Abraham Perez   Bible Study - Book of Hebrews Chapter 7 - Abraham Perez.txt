TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hmm foreign so buddy [Music] you i want to give thanks to each and every one of you then make the effort to come to these bible studies tonight [Music] i think that we should stop on on chapter 7 because that's all that brother priest and if you study the book of hebrews from chapter 8 to chapter 13 most of it is self-explanatory the mayor is explicit [Music] it's self-explanatory and uh good thing that me and caleb are kindred spirits we were thinking about the same thing he said i'm glad you told me there because i was thinking the same thing so uh for this i think was one of the reasons brother venom because the apostle paul was an authority on the old testament so he talks about the priest and the sanctuary abraham principe habla del santorio so if you would be so kind santana and then and we shall read hebrews chapter 7 verse 11. if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood or under it that people received the law what feather need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchizedek and not be called after the order of aaron kennedy so [Music] if it was by the little levitical priesthood for under the basis of it people received the law so then why was there a need that another priest should rise after the order of melchizedek and not [Music] [Music] you must how many remember going to church and they told us you women cannot wear a ring thank god for a prophet how are the people gonna know if you're married if you don't have a ring you are saved by the grace of god the purpose of preaching the gospel saying matthew 13 47 [Music] again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered up every kind of which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the the goods into vessels but cast the bed away universe so shall it be at the end of the world the angels will come forth and severe the wicked from among the just as israel and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth see through the net in the waters and got lizards and that is the same way when we cast the gospel net from behind this falcon yes yes and they come to the altar and they cry and they pray are they all fish that come to the altar because we were not sent 99 of you are legalists how many legalists in this country congregation if 99 percent in branham tabernacle says you are legalistic [Music] a little leg slips to go the other way here bruce 7 12. for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a chain also of the law candiable for he of whom these things are spoken pertaining to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar the things we are talking about belong to another tribe so what is he talking about numbers 24. verse 17. i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not high there shall come a star out of jacob and a scepter shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be silhouetted for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah of which tribe moses take nothing concerning priesthood hebrews 7 15. and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchizedek there are rises [Music] we finally had seven varieties of spirits revelation 1 4 apocalypses i'm giving you scriptures so you can study them later john to the seven churches who are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne the seven spirits before the throne is the spirit and lessons ministerios for the age in which each lived so if there are seven varieties of spirit is and immediately i was on the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one said on the throne and he they said was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow around above the throne inside like unto an emerald aspect and we know that the rainbow has seven colors so that depends on the age and the messenger eso a different color is assigned to each one of those messengers [Music] and the first one was what color er red rojo most important color in a rainbow that's why it's the biggest one and that's the first color yes which red signifies what rocco significant all the colors represent god's purity represent the morris of god of god then through because it was a blood of sin because it came by carnal desire and when jesus was on the cross it was the custom when they were on the cross to break their legs are the ones that were on the cross to make sure that they were dead and the spirit of god moved up above the waters caused the earth where without form establishing foreign in darkness so he searched for you and me he searched through all the when we receive because god only sees nothing but the blood of his own son because jesus is constantly making intercession jesus you will do wrong [Music] example he said you take a three-corner piece of glass and let the sun heat it the pega it will produce seven perfect colors it brings up perfection powder sun and holy [Music] as long as the lord was in the pillar of fire they sinned because they in that time were still unclean creatures and there was no blood laid before them but then the lamb of god came the second step of god which is another officer the same god [Music] [Music] i [Music] there was in the offering of the shoe bread there was laying on the kosher plate in the jewish sacrifice of the cleansing of the tabernacle those three pieces of bread the middle one was broken that who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life you see how legal as they were there was the law the old law said antigua [Music] and if not you should come to the altar so the pastor and the ministers can pray for you because the devil is on the rampage right now el diablo not [Music] so then in terms it is said of old times thou shalt not commit adultery but i say unto you whosoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery already within his heart with earth you see jesus did not come jesus novino he came to magnify the law elvin opera you see how much harder it is now but remember in those days yes they didn't have the blood of jesus christ like you and me that's why when they died they went to paradise even that's why the witch of endor uh could call their spirit [Music] hebrews 7 17. for he testifies thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek is as long as a priest is needed he'll be a priest necessary that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not and high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin okay for there is very a disallowing of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof had weakness for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by that which we draw nigh unto god you because you still have nothing to offer god in propitiation and you repent not reform only and you say i don't want to stand on my marriage is not without an oath he was made priest the question is what is he said when you get married and you say i do you study you are obligated by an oath what is they were righteous after the order of aaron they were not made after the order of melchizedek they came down through generations tomorrow me and my sister yo last tuesday we went to a funeral we walked into a church that we hadn't been there for ages and uh and i i'm not criticizing i passed it away [Music] you better have a lot of patience because this is going to take longer he said do you have a program for for the service [Music] he he said but i'll say one thing mike is the best interpreter in this church from the benches yes thank you michael you've corrected i wish i had 10 men like my guerra in this congregation nobody wanted to do anything in the church you would always find mike by himself has given you a gift there's hardly very few people that make 80 years of age i'm glad you joined me my friends okay oh my god it's good it's good you know what it's a good to be a family it's one of the students anyway we went to this funeral video in this funeral we had been there for two hours and the minister hadn't gone behind to give his message it was it was a beautiful but but nobody had church orders and i'm glad that our pastor was cut with the same scissors way in the back because i am the eyes of the pastor you know he committed me to them and i see all these young ministers [Music] your neighbor here ross collins will join is thank you lord gracias there's different gifts a different testimony god blesses you in in many ways you know because he but when you give god first thank god you that means that you got money in the bank in heaven [Music] remember last friday it was a strong story when brother brown says i'm very strict on tithing god will get you another [Music] says regardless of conditions because some people get guilty minded that they don't want to face any judgment chaos is hosting a studio you say you know cremation is because regular funeral is kind of expensive but if you study the message that your body don't have to stay many years until it goes back to the dust [Music] you've got to meet him he has spoken a word and put a law with that word and the law is and the only way [Music] and by his own death burial and resurrection he proved his law right he said you destroyed this temple he said i'll raise it up in three days for he knew the law of god he knew that the word of god had been spoken by a prophet suffering by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament hebrews but now have he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is a mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises and there truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death look at all the prisons thousands times thousands of priests ministers but they had nothing but death and death but this man because he continues ever has an unchangeable priesthood he is able also to save them to the other moves that come unto god by him seeing he ever lives to make it intercession for them us who is holy harmless blamed blameless undefiled separated from sinners and made higher than the heavens sublime who needed not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the people for this he did once when he offered up himself for the law makers men high priest which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law make it the son who is consecrated or evermore so the law and priesthood didn't accomplish it was a temporary thing but something greater was coming here we turn the corner revelation 12 1 apocalypse and there appeared a great wander in heaven a woman closed with a sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars we've been told we've been talking about the law so the sun here was israel or the orthodox church and the moon under her feet the law was a policeman and the policeman puts you in jail but it took grace to take you and we came in an exodus like they did they had a mexican from a natural land to another they were under the law [Music] sure remember the moon was under the feet of the when of the woman and the moon was the law if you were under the law [Music] [Music] you must not wear a ring you cannot wear bracelets and you cannot wear a necklace and on and on we can go when the centurion broke that cell it released god yes and he says that the spirit of god moved upon the water but he searched for us for 17 years he knew that she had more children and he and he [Music] [Music] [Music] he said you got wings come up higher so then like they were under the lawn and uh the moon was the this is it says that the moon reflects the light of the sun but then the moon turned to blood the bible says in hebrews god in sun right time jose and temples antiguas spoke through the prophets but in this last are we in an mexico are you still the moon under the feet well then the moon a reflection of the sun remember they were negated us from a and i was preaching from the sun he said come and you'll get paid here with the word and the majority of them didn't want to stay and they went away but you they will step and you instead and you instead and myself we stayed with the sun and the spirit of god moved upon the waters on the earth we're drawing closer to the sun yeah we're crazier than you know what amen it is i see it i could open it more but i mean it is i mean the word is so real yes it is how can we reflect if nobody wants to hear the word nobody wants to hear it it's a complete black hole who cares to hear the word of god nowadays russia is for your support and the effort you have made to come to this bible study studio biblical but we're just doing like the family pastor also used to do it especially [Music] people are so beautiful mr santana i love you a lot like i said because the effort that you make to get out and come to this uh amen amen uh keep on praying for for our pastor and the team that's going with him to to uganda and what he said last time that he spoke all those that are going with him you're not going on a picnic there's a lot of danger but thank god that he has put a shield around him because the sun travels with us amen amen so like i said this is the last bible study but heavens and earth will pass away but the word of god will never [Music] lord jesus we just thank you lord for such a privilege lord to study your word you have such a precious elder lord my professor bless him lord give him strength god give him many more years lord and may your soon coming be manifested lord as you catch your bride away by the living word lord now as we all go home lord to our places lord may your angel in camp around about us until we meet again and bless all those around the world in uganda
