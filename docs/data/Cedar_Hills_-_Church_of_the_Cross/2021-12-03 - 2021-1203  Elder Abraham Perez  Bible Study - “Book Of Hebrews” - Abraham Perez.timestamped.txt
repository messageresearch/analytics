[13:32] today in the name of the lord jesus
[13:35] christ
[13:37] amen amen you may be seated
[13:44] well
[13:45] why not
[13:47] we are in uh
[13:50] our fourth
[13:51] uh
[13:52] bible study
[13:58] and if you will be so kind to open your
[14:00] bibles to
[14:01] chapter 2 verse 4 of the book of hebrews
[14:11] i think that's where we left out last
[14:13] time
[14:20] god also bearing them witness both with
[14:22] signs and wonders and with diverse
[14:25] miracles and gifts of the holy ghost
[14:27] according to his own
[14:43] that's what we started last uh last time
[14:45] we had a bible study
[14:49] biblical says if god bore witness
[14:55] so when elijah was sitting on the hill
[14:58] from the elias established
[15:01] he said
[15:03] if i be a man of god
[15:07] let fire fall from
[15:10] heaven and consume this captain and his
[15:14] soldiers
[15:17] and you know what
[15:20] fire did fall from heaven
[15:24] because god bore witness
[15:27] testified that he was a man of god
[15:32] so your own life and such a supreme
[15:36] will bear witness that testimonial
[15:50] how you live every day of your life
[15:56] if you are a son or daughter of god
[16:02] you know that a tree is known by the
[16:04] fruit it bears
[16:08] so then i asked the question
[16:13] do you have the holy spirit can you stay
[16:15] the spirit santo do you know that the
[16:18] holy spirit
[16:30] maybe one thing that the holy spirit is
[16:49] what is
[16:50] the holy spirit
[16:55] uh
[17:16] okay
[17:19] it's also a seal
[17:23] you know
[17:25] so
[17:26] they see us standing here at church he
[17:29] use contempt
[17:54] people say well no just
[17:57] i mean
[17:58] it
[17:59] doesn't brother brown says that in in
[18:02] the bible there there were seven seals
[18:08] did he say there was no seals in the
[18:09] back of the boat
[18:35] for unto the angels has he not put in
[18:38] subjection the world to come whereas we
[18:40] speak
[18:48] to which angel did he give the world to
[18:52] control
[18:53] pero algesti because
[19:05] anybody answer me that question which
[19:08] angel quality
[19:22] he never said elijah you will have
[19:26] control over the whole world
[19:31] but watch paul
[19:33] magnifying christ
[19:38] hebrews 2 6 and 7 everyone says
[19:45] but one in a certain place testified
[19:48] saying what is man that thou art mindful
[19:52] of him or the son of man that dove
[19:54] visited
[20:04] thou made us him a little lower than the
[20:07] angel
[20:08] god crown as him with glory and honor
[20:11] and descent him over the works of thy
[20:14] hands
[20:17] los angeles
[20:29] who
[20:30] testifies
[20:38] it's it's a little different
[20:41] different
[20:42] and i don't
[20:43] you know to call you by name because we
[20:46] were used to like
[20:49] because we were at home
[20:52] studios we were we had everybody close
[20:55] by
[20:58] so it's a little different here
[21:01] and it used to be that
[21:03] that people were scared of me
[21:07] especially when i would come down
[21:09] especially mexico
[21:11] don't worry i won't go there not the
[21:12] place no no no i said i mean
[21:15] so
[21:16] and
[21:17] and i don't wanna you know because some
[21:20] somebody would get a uh embarrassed or
[21:22] says
[21:25] and so
[21:27] i just asked the question
[21:40] you know who testified savvy skin
[21:53] mindful of him
[21:55] and the son of man that visited
[22:10] a little lower than the angels and has
[22:12] crowned him with glory and honor
[22:21] thou mayest him to have dominion over
[22:23] the works of thy hands thou has put all
[22:26] things under his feet
[22:33] so you see that david was the one that
[22:36] testified
[22:50] thou has put all things in subjection
[23:22] so we're on the question
[23:25] which angel had control over the whole
[23:28] world established
[23:31] control
[23:36] you want to find out get in ayala
[23:39] 10 matthew 28 san mateo capital
[23:45] verse 17
[23:48] and when they saw him they worshiped
[23:51] worship him but some doubted
[23:58] and jesus came and spoke unto them
[24:01] saying
[24:02] all
[24:03] power
[24:04] is given unto me in heaven and in earth
[24:14] so who
[24:15] that's why david
[24:30] there was not
[24:32] one of these angels that we think
[24:37] oh but we're going to get into something
[24:39] good
[24:41] on that same question
[24:43] maybe not
[24:45] not today but we will kisanos
[24:50] what was it
[24:52] he died and his spirit left him
[24:58] [Music]
[25:12] and god was that pillar of fire idiots
[25:17] that led the children in the wilderness
[25:22] and when he died
[25:25] he turned back to that
[25:40] the logos had been made flesh
[25:44] and had been killed
[25:47] and rose again for our justification
[25:53] and then he became
[26:10] [Music]
[26:15] to the heart of his son christ jesus
[26:20] christ jesus to live and reign forever
[26:25] god was in christ
[26:28] which was the final resting place of the
[26:32] spirit
[26:50] but solomon built him a house peros
[26:57] acts chapter 7 verse 46
[27:02] foreign
[27:07] who hung found favor before god and
[27:10] desire to find a tabernacle for the god
[27:13] of jacob
[27:17] this is
[27:35] how big the most high dwellers not in
[27:37] temples made with ants as say the
[27:40] prophet
[27:47] heaven is my throne and the earth is my
[27:50] fruits too
[27:52] what house will you build me saith the
[27:54] lord or what is the place of my rest
[28:00] casa
[28:10] [Music]
[28:26] for god was in the mercy
[28:43] who was made a little lower than the
[28:45] angels for the suffering of
[28:56] death crown with glory and honor
[29:00] coronado gloria
[29:01] that he by the grace of god should taste
[29:04] death for every man
[29:20] emilio why was
[29:22] god made a little lower
[29:38] brother moreno what why was he made a
[29:41] little more than the angel okay
[29:50] this is
[30:04] so he could taste dead you know
[30:21] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[30:24] he said sacrifice enough in thou it is
[30:27] not but a body has now prepared me
[30:33] this is
[31:15] so he could redeem
[31:18] you
[31:19] and i
[31:21] the brother friend says the homeless
[31:27] sin
[31:30] we saying
[31:32] the world is not my home
[31:36] i'm just the best invite
[31:41] you say no no i got a nice house
[31:54] why did god
[31:56] jesus christ when he come when he came
[31:58] yo
[32:19] if you know the book of hebrews you know
[32:21] we're going to hit that theophany hard
[32:23] later on
[32:32] did the patriarch abraham ever found
[32:37] what he was looking for the patrick
[32:40] hamas
[32:43] what was he looking for
[32:49] this doesn't develop says he searched
[32:51] for a city he said
[32:56] he found the city william william ayola
[32:59] william
[33:05] are you searching for a city
[33:20] he came to redeem the homeless
[33:26] to give us a home in heaven
[33:32] he gave us a home
[33:35] and because he gave
[33:49] he lived all the glory
[34:18] we're not liking the times of noah that
[34:21] lived almost a millennium
[34:26] we
[34:27] there used to be us a saying
[34:47] so tom says he became homeless eligible
[34:50] cersei no
[34:52] he came to you and me the sinners
[34:56] [Music]
[34:58] to become sin but you gotta say pecan
[35:13] so you can see it's not me
[35:18] i have nothing for you people you are
[35:20] not even
[35:21] but he who lives in me has a lot for you
[35:28] and a certain scribe came and said unto
[35:30] him master
[35:32] i will follow thee whether so ever thou
[35:35] goes
[35:43] and jesus said unto him
[35:45] the foxes have hoped and the birds of
[35:48] the air have nest but the son of man had
[35:51] no where to lay his head jesus
[36:10] those dears
[36:12] for it became him
[36:14] for whom our all things
[36:17] and by whom are all things in bringing
[36:19] many sons unto glory to make the captain
[36:22] of their salvation perfect through
[36:24] suffering
[36:47] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[36:50] who are sanctified are all of one for
[36:53] which cause he is not ashamed to call
[36:56] them brethren
[37:06] my mom
[37:14] saying i will declare thy name unto my
[37:17] brethren in the midst of the church will
[37:20] i sing praise unto thee
[37:28] and again i will put my trust in him and
[37:31] again behold and the children which god
[37:33] had given me
[37:42] or as much then as the children are
[37:45] partakers of flesh and blood
[37:47] he also himself likewise took part of
[37:50] the same
[37:51] that through death he might destroy him
[37:54] that had the power of death that is the
[37:57] devil
[37:59] he was participating
[38:01] in participation
[38:10] and delivered them who through fear of
[38:13] death were all their lifetimes subject
[38:16] to bondage
[38:26] so he came to deliver them from bondage
[38:44] you might say i never was in band
[38:49] i tell you i was in bangladesh
[38:57] you were never a free man you stand up
[39:00] for nobody liberty
[39:01] you you weren't
[39:04] i don't know in this congregation you
[39:06] know
[39:07] it's a congregation but many were in
[39:10] bondage
[39:11] to liquor which
[39:38] they wanted to
[39:40] and
[40:08] the three stooges
[40:10] or the three musketeers
[40:14] we have to walk from hanover to santa
[40:17] rita
[40:20] maybe it was about two three mile
[40:23] commodore
[40:25] we were real poor we didn't have money
[40:26] to buy cigarettes
[40:31] so the only thing we occurred in our
[40:32] pockets were some matches
[40:35] uh
[41:04] we used to recycle the cigarettes
[41:10] because we were in bondage
[41:16] so then
[41:18] everybody is one way or another you were
[41:21] in bandit
[41:25] you never got liberty
[41:29] for freedom
[41:31] until you came to this message
[41:35] and not only because you came to the
[41:37] message
[41:40] [Music]
[41:43] amen
[41:47] hallelujah hallelujah so this
[41:50] poster
[41:52] paul is talking to the hebrews here
[41:57] you know he would go to this all these
[42:00] places
[42:02] lugares and boy he laid down the law el
[42:06] poniala
[42:11] notice they can say
[42:16] [Music]
[42:28] how many fear deaths
[42:35] and
[42:36] and a lot of people
[42:38] they lie with a straight face
[42:47] [Music]
[43:07] [Music]
[43:20] but you know that if a person is born
[43:23] again
[43:39] so then how can we die
[43:43] if we're still with the holy spirit and
[43:45] have eternal life see someone say i was
[43:47] going to speak to something
[43:49] and how can we die come on
[44:07] didn't jesus say
[44:09] nothing jesus lazarus is not dead
[44:17] how can you die
[45:01] and we do not understand enough
[45:05] there's still a little bit of fear
[45:10] because brethren says we don't
[45:12] we do not understand them
[45:16] we
[45:58] it even made the son of god
[46:03] say
[46:07] could this come yes
[46:12] yes
[46:39] says
[46:43] or verily he took not on him the nature
[46:46] of angels but he took on him the seed of
[46:50] abraham
[46:53] los angeles
[47:11] [Music]
[47:19] he never became an angel
[47:22] he
[47:33] wherefore in all things it behooved him
[47:37] to be made like unto his brethren
[47:41] that he might be merciful and faithful
[47:44] high priest in things pertaining to god
[47:47] to make
[47:48] reconciliation for the sins of the
[47:50] people
[48:05] to make
[48:06] reconciliation
[48:07] for
[48:09] the sins of the people
[48:13] pueblo there was enmity between god and
[48:16] men avia an enemy and mistakenly
[48:20] no man send the angels or when it says
[48:22] angels it means prophet
[48:28] they couldn't take your place
[48:32] because they had to pray for themselves
[48:38] but then he sent the law
[48:41] it was a policeman
[48:44] that put us in jail
[48:47] but they couldn't bring us out but
[48:52] it could not make an atonement nobody
[48:55] expiate but he came down and became one
[48:58] of us
[49:09] for in that he himself has suffered
[49:12] being tempted
[49:14] he is able to stop
[49:16] how do you pronounce this factor or stop
[49:18] court disappear
[49:22] secure
[49:23] thank you
[49:24] secure them that are tempted
[49:28] to
[49:45] [Music]

[50:49] [Music]
[51:02] he wanted to see what you and i passed
[51:04] through
[51:46] but he said i will not leave you
[51:48] comfortably
[52:24] and jesus took that in order to make
[52:28] intercessions for us jesus
[52:36] [Music]

[1:08:59] and one of the young guys says
[1:09:03] he told this other guy ladies
[1:09:33] that every seed produced of its own kind
[1:09:40] and they were obedient
[1:09:44] to the truth
