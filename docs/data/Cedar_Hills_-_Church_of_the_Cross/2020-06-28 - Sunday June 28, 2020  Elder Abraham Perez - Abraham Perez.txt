[Music] you you pity possible weaklings who God separated you and sent you out the Fila gear denomination you can't denominator cost sent you out to be as people but you seem too big fine churches in the theology you got yourselves a lot of big schools and things what did you do you've United God's people again with organization which the very foundation of it is Catholicism pretty big churches planned rest people as mayor of the city and all the rest of them comes best dress best educated ha theologians knows how to come to a place where everybody wears the great thanks and supposed in the pastor stance is so perfect in place why is it looking at the things that God condemned and you touch the Pentecostal church God let it get the tapes and if you added it into an organization God never did Walnut you're not anyone is separated never in united with the Worman the same ole devil the cause Eve to disbelieve the Word of God and don't hurt evils come right back round and tuck the children off saith and let him see these pretty women of team and they United again and they was not infidels they were not communist no no they were believers they said now perhaps maybe the Lord might do something or all this like that if they were they thought that they were doing what was right and what did God have to do wipe the whole thing off had to wipe the whole thing off on her false Union he had to send a flood and destroy the whole bunch judgment come on for that force Jasmine stuck in because of a false Union not a circle Hevesi channel a pouch Union brought judgment on the earth to even Adam and Eden the false Union brought the floods of God's judgment on the earth because that the daughters of teen flirted with the sons of God and they fell apart and United together dude they're your pops Union nothing could happen why did God dude he destroyed the whole thing all over precious old Noah and his family he they got together again after that thanks to the death of North that's spiritual family of Noah first thing you know the children of man begin to look to one another again what do they do they said now we're not infidels we all believe in God so they got a followed by a leader some great archbishop by the name of Nimrod and they build a tower they buzzing infidels they believe there's a heaven they think there was a hell they breathed in judgments but the children of God with the daughters of man again and they made himself a union falsely and built a great big Cathedral a great big organization all the other places was the Babel was to pay tribute to it and they said I'll tell you what we can do you know we're smart were to get that wisdom from the devil exactly they got it from the devil like set like Eve did got it from the devil so they said we don't feel ourself an organization will please gone and I'll tell you what we do we'll have a little spare stamps we are up and saying in a jar with the Angels have come back down here live the way we want to that Devils still live it was against the commandments of God they didn't his Commandments what did God do well if you look our fable false again so God confused them in separated God separated again any South good old righteous Abraham so I'll just take you and make a nation out of you don't separate him come out from among them leave everything behind and God never blessed until they left everything behind Locke was the last come out Abraham separate yourself from them unbelievers I'm gonna take you and make a nation out of you I'll make a people that'll keep my Commandments I'm gonna give him another chance good ol Abraham with the soldier in a strange land that's whatever Abraham does so turning in a strange land one believing a promise that was impossible humanly speaking what do you think that modern Keynes doctors would have said that day mom but old man hundred years old would have a baby about wife 94 what a ridiculous thing but abraham believed God's Word and anything contrary to T called it so it wasn't ever all these folks baptisms false sensations false stuff that's going on today Sam's not better believe God's Word to keep on going it's only a stumbling block to keep you from reaching for the real lubrano children God's Word God keeps his word I don't care how many bogus things the devil shows out there God still got a true word and he keeps it Abraham corny then contrary wrong Romans support chapters you're putting down Abraham called anything contrary to God's Word as though it wasn't that's right now he believed that God was strong no matter how weak his body got how impossible it seemed that wasn't gonna happen Abraham kept on bleeding now I didn't have to doubt the owner say if you don't come right I won't a word believe it or not hey bruh hams taper them for 25 years before time but it got there it always does Abraham come Isaac Isaac come Jacob I've Jacob come the patriarchs now the pig charge 22 Egypt in Egypt grow the nation then when he got his nation grown up his achievement what did he do God separate them again unbelief and faith can't go together no sir he separated them again bra party zone what did he do to him to be sure that they was mad right listen folks now we haven't got too much more time now maybe another 15 minutes you let him close watch he raised up a nation put him under tutors and things they were beaten crying and crying you going oh but God was looking now you never ever promised to give Abraham one day what did he do to him what did he do when he separate them he'd give him a law and he give him a prophet he give him a pillar of fire what did he do oh he said his church order a pillar of fire or spirit to lead them a poppet who had telling the truth of his word they were ready for the journey then isn't that wonderful how do you do the wilderness they went performing signs and wonders opening up the red sea calling the pipes out pillar of fire moving before prophet true to that word standing there halli geek them lined up he was ready to take his children in that's the first time he's ever called a church already it was a pipe but what he's going to do in the last days we'll get to that again just in the marrow it call him on give him the law give him his word give him the profit you give him a sign and he's standing into the wilderness separated them from the rest of the world what did they do saw the pretty women a lukewarm Church with gods and goddesses and everything else what did they do went for him married in among them that's right exactly right I imagine those pretty little morganite women they're really beautiful I got a prophecy laying at home well these days I'm gonna read it you wonder why rapid women over 30 years ago I've got thus saith the Lord 30 years ago and I into the ministry he told me that the strain of women but he comes to him more leading puted in the last ASA to be the most defiled thing on the earth right she started at the beginning and Satan user at the Union look what is happening look down through the years said she'll continue to strip her self and said they'll just be a little tiny group of the very elected that's predestinated will escape that when that vision come I've worried me I saw women I've turned back over the Bible now I was a to be the fifth chapter said the grace that has escaped from the daughters of Zion and that day will be beautiful to the law a woman wrote me a question if it he she's heading brother Brad or no it's a man minister maybe stand here this morning just Mohan and he said we want to say the same thing you do but we found something on your tapes it's not right so Billy brought the letter to me said something on your tapes says it's very contradictory brother branham through the Word of God and we won't if we want to say the same thing said one question I want to say to you that's first Corinthians the labor chapter and it says that about the head covering for the women and the man not to have cover II said we believe that the women should wear hats in the church and the man should pick your hats off in the church say we believe them head coverings and so forth it said then another question is that the people come to us and say the angel of the Lord speaks everything to you every word that you speak is from the angel of the Lord and brother Rand is so hard to fight against something like that said in my church said we want to see the same thing our brother Branham know you believe it she was a little an error there I'll wrote back my precious brother I'm not an error the first Corinthians 11 chapter said a woman should have her head covered and why then the 15th verse said her long hair is given to her fara covered not a hat Catholic spirits dominated the church long enough where long hair is her covering don't hate yourself and look and then the question come back somebody asked me some time ago I'll explain it while I'm at it he said well the Bible said that she should have long hair because of the Angels what's the Angels got to do as a woman I said what is an angel it's a messenger what's Paul saying if a true messenger an angel from God comes by you better have long hair he'll condemn the thing Johnny I mean he's got no was an angel this messenger iMessage you're sent when God will condemn it said you better have long hair because of the Angels then messenger sent from God comes by Oh condemneth II yes indeedy because a real messenger from God rachel is connected with God his word can't fail the exactly right st. Paul said there that if even an angel from heaven come told anything else but he'd been cursed and right now we find out that that's true she should have long hair that's recovering but I imagine these pretty moba night women were very beautiful they might have been fixed upside some look modern and Jessie bells of the day but however not all women I think a woman that's genuine is a jewel praise God firmly a woman God's hands made but a real woman is like a real man then follow the Word of God regardless of what the devil says really false things said our pastor said it's alright to do this don't care what your pastor said if it's contrary to God's Word let his word be a lie keep God's Word okay what denomination is or what he is these guys things day by coming look into the of God exactly oh hi we could go on down and see God separating and we're gonna have to stop isn't it you got some scriptures your water just by pace it to get it hurry up to get to the end then what happened when he taking place there when the moment night women God had to separate him again what did he do then came Jesus now we're we're coming somewhere then came Jesus the Express image of God the woman see conceived by God himself the great architect built himself a body he didn't have to borrow a timber from anybody woman harmony he built himself a house oh I think of Stephens on that day when he stood said juice uncircumcised and heart and ears you stiff Nick's you always resist the Holy Ghost like your fathers did so you said Solomon building the house but I bet the Most High don't live in houses made with hands but a body has had to bar any chambers anywhere Hebrews the legend chapter I believe in the second or third verse says that the world was framed by the Word of God the things were made out of things that don't appear God just said let there be in there was he didn't have for say mr. moon would you know me a little timber mr. Stahr would you let me have some towson god don't do that he didn't have say Mary you know me an egg I want to make the body so I drilled in it God the Creator spoke and she was a mother she was the mother she was just a woman bearing his seed now trying to remember she was not Jesus mother the world said so find me one place of scripture every taller mother now come back to the word mother of God shame on you one day some people said Jim said your mother's outside looking for you said who is my mother looked over his disciples said they they do the will of my father is my mother she was his mother she was a incubator God could use something else but he want to take the very lowest is sure what he could do with it raise it up make something out of nothing that's God expressed image come Jesus the Mackley upon the lovely one the fairest of ten thousand to lily of the valley the Rose of Sharon all the Morningstar what was he what did he come for listen close now to re-establish oneness between God and man did you see it brother all their towers of Babel and all their other things back there didn't work all their fruits the gardens and everything else displease God so God came down and was conceived in the womb of a woman by his own self made himself a body and become Emmanuel God with us neither Jew nor Gentile but God he wasn't you he wasn't Gentile he was God the Gentiles are just as much to him at anytime or he tried to separate a Jew for a nation you tried to everything to get it back to the only way he could establish it was come back to an individual like he was at the beginning that's the way it is today to an individual not to a denomination not to an organization not to a group of people but to an individual notice to reestablish oneness between God and man he was a real sin offering sheep goats and so forth could never take away sin but the life the cause when the sacrifice is killed in the life of a lamb the most innocent thing could not come back that life of only believer because he was a human being with a soul and the Sheep has no soul the nothing has to solve it man God put is the animal farm that's true but he put a soul Oni that's what made him different than the animals he know right from wrong when his soul come along but he remember when God created man in his own image and then he became a living soul he became that knowing right from wrong now notice but now in this Jesus came and he was God not only the life of another man could come back on another man but the very life of God making him a child of God put me back into the same union he was before the fall now we're getting to real ones people somebody says to me hey brother buddy might you oneness not the organization won this but I'm oneness with Christ but not the organization wonders he paid the debt of sin now in order to get oneness between God and man Jesus could not do it as long as he was here in a body of flesh so he had to become the complete sin offering to take away the guilt of the believer he'd taken away so that the Holy Ghost could come into man and make man and God oneness again see there had to be something to reestablish now what could re-establish when God's commandment is fulfilled could an angel fulfill it he has no blood could God a fulfill it he had no blood and God became flesh and blood in order that he could pay the debt correctly and take away sin because that's the only way towers of Babel separating across the earth everything else organizations and things that failed in every way they get mixed up together the world and everything else but this was going to be a total separation Lauren I feel religious well I feel like I take my text and I start preaching right now just get warmed up now to where I can get started right here it's time we stop hmm maybe I'll finish it later sometimes the oneness of God and man do you understand all that understand say a man see that's the only way that man could be back in his original state again is for that penalty of sin to be paid the penalty of sin is why death wages of sin is death and God said the day you eat thereof the day that you had this affair that's the day you'll die and when he did it broke his relationship fellowship and everything from man it could not come back anymore until that penalty was paid and nobody was worthy to pay it because everyone fell with the human being goes every creatures under the human and he was falling we've need this for the night huh under the penalty of death brother Mack you're used to be pastor to the tabernacle when I left now another good old Baptist missionary baptist down there they got the holy go see notice now they come into the oneness with God now when we see this see the penalty must be paid and know the highest form of animal life is a human being and the human being fell itself so how can one human save another it taken God and God in spirit cannot die so God had to bring yourself a little lower than the Angels Hebrews the first chapters had to make yourself lower than the Angels in order to take death to pay the penalty the brains of oneness between man and God again so the Holy Ghost to come man the deadest sin was paid Jesus had to do this to sender the the Holy Ghost back up on didn't unite people again like it wasn't a Garden of Eden the debt was paid when Jesus died that sounded hey if I could only get it to soak in that debt is paid to the Letham that death is paid and every man and woman here in D this morning or will hear me mother take your penalty is paid don't you disbelieve God's word I can't come back to the word don't believe it he was the word boy I feel like shout monster do the penalty is paid it's all over no wonder angel screams Oh anthems of heaven reaction Hey the lost sheep was found a propitiation was made for you to be restored again oh the waters of separation God's word that Washington from his iniquity when the word died in my place they believed as erected again and then come reminisce in my life hey it's over we are redeemed not by a Catholic Church although we are the correct Catholic yes not Roman Catholic with their dogmas they didn't hide this word but their dog everything's are you Donovan not the word Methodist Baptist shame on lovers of iniquity more than lovers of God lovers of pleasure world seekers pleasures slaughtered pigs for the pen available were standing as instruments out there choking that stuff dunya like Satan in the Garden of Eden well our ministers have got an education they got the PhD ll they don't mean a thing how that word is still a trick of the devil I've proved it to you by the word that's not be up to you for now the disciples even walking with Jesus they didn't have no oneness they didn't have any unity Paul they argued who's going to be bishop after this who's the greatest among us they couldn't even believe Jesus they can understand him thou speakest and riddles tell us plainly what you need there was no unity between Jesus and the disciples and cypress to Jesus and the flag was among one another no matter that goes to show you brother listen close now I want this to stick real deep down in your heart see God's got a plan outside of that plan I don't care how about your wisdoms behind it how many fine millions of dollars of buildings how many schools of theology how many holy man and holy holy holy holy makes no difference at all if one word of God's Bible is denied it's of the devil prove that to you by the written word of God from nude Old Testament now bring your own down to the day if you Lissette with me if you lose the disciples who walk hand and hand with Jesus slept with thee eat with thee once these miracles is associated with him clothes did any brother could be and yet they didn't have they wasn't fit to preach the gospel Jesus said don't you preach anymore don't you even try you way or third city Jerusalem I'm going to send the promise has been giving you have only that would unify you there a father I pray that they'll be one justice you and are not as my father has sent me to preach the gospel so send on you and
