we're thankful to God the word of God it gets as Uncle L says gets good and good but but but not just to to be hearers of the word but the Bible says to be doers of the word and you've heard our our our pastor Express his heart to you don't don't uh don't uh don't take that lightly take it through all your heart and do what what what the spirit has told us to do and that's the the only way we're going to make it home I'm many want to make it home that that that's our goal is to make it home and so in the book of Acts the seventh chapter and we we we won't uh I don't see a clock but we we won't take very much time Lori if you could just raave your hand when I'm about 40 minutes if you ra wave your hand at me I'll make sure that I pay attention this time so help me help me Lord Jesus yeah if he he doesn't help me nobody can help me a amen so we thank thank the Lord for brother Caleb our our my interpreter tonight so it that the Lord bless him and and and help him tonight and the Lord bless and help us and the book of Acts the 7eventh chapter and it says like this our fathers had the Tabernacle of will of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of DAV who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but uh but Solomon built him an house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayth the Lord or what is the place of my rest Lord Jesus we come before you and we ask father with the bot from the bottom of our heart we H I can't do nothing without you and we are we are in your hands You Are The Potter we are the clay mold us and make us according to what you will we're we're grateful that you have called us to this wonderful gospel and I ask father that you will bless your people in Jesus precious name amen and amen you may be seated now some that are in the Bible study class might might that we have on Fridays uh might be a little bit uh maybe a little bit ahead of of of uh maybe uh us tonight but but uh I just want to to go maybe go over some things that might might be able to help you and uh I trust in the Lord of what he has done for us now now I I'd like I have a have a pamphlet here and it's a big old pamphlet of of the 12 disciples that that became the 12 apostles and and in it it it I don't know if every anybody ever reads any of these but but it's it's it's uh it's it's a some some Publications that that is that is placed by The Rose Publishing Company it's a Christian company but they give something like uh like uh the name of Peter and Peter was was uh as you know with the chief of the Apostles and you know his his name before Peter was Simon uh but it gives like a general information about him but what I want to read about certain of the of the disciples is this is their personality and their character maybe you can find yourself in one of these disciples I I I found myself and and uh you know you know but but but here here you here you find out the the disciples Peter his uh character his personality ity was this he was impulsive he was hot tempered he was insightful but he was courageous after Pentecost you like that that that uh that that character James the the son of zebede he was vengeful and fiery selfish and conceited but he was committed to Christ and courageous to the end the other son of zebede John vengeful and fiery judgmental and selfish but he was bold and comp passionate and loving after Pentecost are you getting the idea Andrew was enthusiastic about Christ inquisitive and resourceful and you can go on and on and on about their character and their personality and the way that they were these were men just like you and I they each have their personalities they had their characteristics but one thing is that got them together was this this was the miracle of Pentecost now now now we we we do believe in the great miracle at Pentecost right they they came out of the upper room they were speaking in unknown or other other forgive me they were speaking in other languages and but the mystery or the miracle of Pentecost was not that they were just speaking in in tongues or in in other languages the miracle of Pentecost was this that each one one of them 17 Nations that were represented each one of them heard the message in their own language that was the miracle of Pentecost now now but before that Miracle there was another miracle how do you get 120 Jewish people together to be in one place and one Accord now I think I think we we tonight we probably have more than 120 here and and for for a group of this people each one of us has a different idea each one of us has a different thought each one of us has a different concept of what we think should be happening in 12 but could you imagine that 120 Jewish people got together this to me was the miracle before the miracle in one place in one Accord I was I I don't know if we could get three or four people in one Accord some might like a a riye steak some like Chinese food some like to eat Mexican food others like to eat Thai food some like to raise their hands some are very quiet some like to be uh fiery and other people have different characteristics but let me tell you all of these people were in one place in one court and in one mind why they had heard the voice of Jesus and the voice of Jesus said this Parry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high this is what what what what people don't understand we understand and we give God thanks for the mountains we give God thanks for the valley we give God thanks for the ocean we give God thanks for the desert all of these are characteristics of God and God is identified and he is known by his own characteristics some people like to wear blue some people like to wear some people like to wear white the different colors that God has but we're all children of of God but this is what had to happen before the miracle they had to make things right one with the other if you want something to happen you got to make it right at home first you got to make it right in your heart first this is what our pastor was speaking about on Sunday we we we we get we get sidetracked and and we say there's going to be a Rapture and we give go God thanks for all of that but let me tell you we can know all about what God's going to do but unless we are ready to meet him let a message just go over our head and we won't do what God asked us to do on Sunday he told us that we had to repent you want God on the scene you want God in your life You' got to do what God asked you to do they were all in one Accord in one place when all of a sudden there was a great sound from Heaven if we want something to happen in our life we got God at his word now now Sunday to me I I I I was here on the platform and and as our pastor says magnify glorify the Lord feel myself go up I don't know about you but after Sunday we come up to another level now now I if people want to stay with their jealousies if people want to stay with backbiting that's up to them those that have wanted to to accept the message of the hour do what God wants them to do I believe that we have come up high now there's a reason why it was called The Upper Room I think brother FID feels better now I think brother F feels good now he did he did he didn't before but but knowing that he's going to be living in the upper room I know that we should be feeling good right now I know that we have a pastor the way we do a pastor that'll show us the way a pastor that will tell us when we're wrong a pastor that will show us his heart a pastor that will take us in this is what God wants to do in our generation Pentecost we have another time where we can be in one mind in one Accord in one place yes if we start being what we are now our character get us in trouble sometimes we' rather fight than switch I don't know about you but sometimes I fight with my shadow I talk to myself and I tell sometimes I answer myself sometimes I I the the you know why because the worst enemy that I have is nobody out there the worst enemy that I have is myself I've got to conquer Inner Space before I can think of outer space I've got to understand that the word of God is for me the word of God comes to change us from the inside out now I I I want to to to do this real real quick the prophet of God says this now I I I probably won't get to everything that I needed to get to and uh but that's all right I get to get to what what God wants me to get to brother brandham talks about this about moving up higher how how many want to move up higher you don't want to stay where you're at do you no no we we we don't want to stay where we're at if we're gonna stay where we're at we we we we could go do something else but if we're going to be a Christians let's go up higher follow the word you know the brother brandham calls Caleb he calls Joshua the end time leader and he calls Caleb the the type of the end time believer he's the True Believer you know why he's faithful you know why the Bible says he had a different Spirit In other words he had a different attitude while everybody said I can't he said we are more than able when everybody says we can't take the we cannot take it he's the one that after everything was conquered he comes up to Joshua and he tells them give me that mountain give me the most difficult Mountain that there is give me the place where those giants still live that's where I want so then Caleb is an attitude it's a new spirit it's a different Spirit we're we're proud to call Brother Caleb our pastor but not only brother Caleb is Caleb you are the end time believer call Caleb we got a different spirit attitude while everybody goes away and everybody runs we say give me that give me the most difficult job give me the job nobody else wants we are more than able to take to take the mountain but it but it costs us and every day you a person might say I'm I've been in the message for 40 years it couldn't cost anymore you want to go higher it costs it cost it cost you want to stay where you're at it don't cost you you're you just sit down where you're at have the same rental agreement you're going to pay the same utilities you're going to pay the same uh service that you get but if you want to go up higher your mortgage is going to cost a little bit more your utilities are going to cost a little bit more what's it going to cost cost you your life what's it going to cost me well I can move over here sure you can and everybody thinks that over there The Grass Is Always Greener over there but they forget that that same grass still needs to be mowed oh over there I won't have no no trials but if you want to go up higher it will cost you but it'll cost you your life now what do we do I read this quote the other day and this quote just knocked my socks off yeah that's right now brother brandham is saying this he said they brought a little girl up a little Indian girl a beautiful little thing a little maid and her eyes real black shiny before I got before she got to me someone I believe it was a missionary brother brother Mitchell said she's blind and someone said down the line she's blind see them lead her along and brought her in front of me I prayed to our Heavenly Father for the child and I waved my hands in front of her face and those big black staring eyes just staring so then I thought poor little fellow has to go through life like that I put my hand back on her and seemed like that I left this sounds fanatically but it's true seemed like that I left the Earth and went in before the Throne of God there was the blood of Jesus Christ and I know the poor little Indian girl maybe couldn't understand English or know nothing else so seemed like that God opened my faith for the blood of the Lord Jesus and presented it to her now now you we we sometimes I'm not talking about myself sometimes I want to teach somebody about what we believe and they haven't been born again and they'll never see it if you can give somebody something they can see then they believe it now this is what I say that's why people will believe in a literal t because it's something they can see or something they can imagine there are people that can see a certain thing because they can see a certain thing they believe a certain thing but who could believe this this is Supernatural how that a man man on the earth can go into the presence of God the blood of Christ from the throne present it to a creature here on Earth can it be she opened up her eyes didn't this is what I don't understand about Malachi 4 they believe in the Supernatural until it's something they cannot see this and this has got to happen really let me tell you one thing I believe in the tent but I believe that God stretched the tent to a human being that Jesus was the Tabernacle of God here on Earth he was the tent of God walking that's Supernatural isn't it this is what what what what it costs us we can see to a certain point until it costs us this to me is so outstanding what does it cost us to live a Christian Life we walk the Bible says by faith and not by sight yet the majority of Christians all they can walk through is by sight we've had people tell us we took your reservation out of the airplane because you don't believe it and I and I and I said since when were you the one that gave us that re that reservation I believe in the supernal work of God I believe the word of God just the way it is written I believe in the first pool I believe in the second pool I believe in the third po but the third pole has something to do with you and I when they want to take the bride away from the groom they just cut the body in half and when they tried to take the head away from the body it has become a monster in Malachi 4 what you saw Sunday was the union of Heaven and Earth that's what God does he unites one omnipotent with the other omnipotent one in heaven one on earth that's the supernatural can you if somebody needs something from you can you leave your body go into the presence of God take blood out off of the altar come back present it to a person in need and that person receive what they have from God they the only way that can happen is that God finds his rest if God has created a body and you are the mystical body jist now how does this happen you heard our pastor happens in the parable now when two omnipotents meet the Heavenly Angel and the Earthly Angel something's got to happen now could you believe February 28th 1963 a cloud comes into the desert of Arizona it wasn't just any any Cloud give me just your undivided attention for a few minutes it wasn't just any Cloud This Cloud came from eternity are you a Believer tonight I wish I had a believe some Believers tonight came from eternity the message that we have received was a message that came from a seminary it wasn't a message that came from a book the message that we have received straight from the back of the part of the mind of God to the heart of Believers but where are the Believers there sometimes our focus is this how much money I can make what I can drive where I can live and all of that is good we have to live some place we have to drive something we have to make money but that should not be our focus our focus should be this that we be in one place in one ACC that's the miracle of P God is calling us to a different if you didn't see that on Sunday you missed the whole message God calling us to go up higher God is calling us to for you to leave your drugs to leave your liquor to leave your ways of the world go up higher aren't you tired of the devil having you bound now a person says well I'm not I I don't have any of those those vices yeah but but maybe you come to church and you wish you were someplace else and the preacher says something you're like that's nice and the attitude will leave you where you were at in bondage but Caleb had a different attitud what's your attitude tonight we are more than Overcomers amen where was brother Jimmy Jimmy where was brother Jimmy Jimmy sister Rosita after 22 days when you were laying there with Co intubated in the hospital where was brother Jimmy in the room no but you heard a voice and the voice said it's time to wake up Sister somebody had got to another dimension where only God and the person lives we're supposed to be a supernatural people we all encouraged by the things of the world and the world just do the lights they capture our attention that's why television is so exciting the attention in the imagination wow look at that woman she don't exist they've airbrushed her about 20 times and you go to the gym to try to be somebody else of somebody's imagination a person that does not exist and so then we try to be then religious and we say you know what I'll be like the other church member and how come they get to do it but I can't do it let me tell you maybe you're at two different places down here and he's up there me and him could get into one Accord one place the spirit of God would raise us up into another level now this is where this is this is this this is to me is outstanding of the word of God the word of God is where is the place of my rest when brother Caleb has the vision and my my papa comes up to the to the where we're at and he hugs him it's because he had found rest Supernatural again he goes and hugs brother Caleb he's found rest where in the attitude in the spirit that's right who said that we couldn't make it who's the giant who's the person that said we could never make it let me tell you what our founding pastor says together if we stick together we make it together but it cost us a different attitude another Spirit not different because we want to be different but another Spirit a spirit that says yes we can now now my my time is coming is coming to to to an end but but I I trust that God will will will help you okay where where where are we at okay Jesus in the 17th chapter of the book of St Matthew the Bible says he was transfigured he was so transfigured that his clothes couldn't have that his clothes could not hold back the glory the Bible says his face shine like sun different was different he was transfigured he was transformed everything that that that there was all the adoption everything that he was supposed to have he was transfigured when did this happen after six Church ages after 6,000 years what he could not do in his Corporal body all of a sudden he's transfigured translated to the resurrection that was what was it it was just the rehearsal of February 28th 1963 again a man is in Arizona before he meets the Angels he's he's already he had already went to Sabino Canyon and the and and he tells us this I'm with my hands raised up okay okay I'm with my hands raised up some of you have hands some don't okay this is the prophet I'm with my hands raised up so I'm only have one hand okay you're goingon to need both I'm with my hands raised you want something to happen you got to raise up your hands you got to Worship the Lord you got to sing the songs of Zion you got to come up you can't even imagine a man on Pulpit Rock his hands up all of a sudden the sword of the king falls into his hands hallelujah what fell into his hands the revealed word the book was open the book was open revealed all the Revelation from Genesis to Revelation fell into his hands right and you get all excited to hear somebody on TV I've heard people in the message say this oh I heard that lady preach are you serious I heard somebody on television evangelist something tremendous what can be more tremendous than the word of God you got to shake yourself you got to understand that Elijah the prophet to you with the whole message that's right you're not excited yet it's all right it's all right I tell you tonight we are living in the dispensation of the Overflow my cup David says it's running over after Sunday I cannot contain No More To Worship the Lord I've got to say hallelujah I've got to praise the Lord he has opened up the [Applause] [Music] words but you'd rather stay with your Creeds and your dogmas of how you think it's going to happen instead of believing God's word there's more Creeds and dogmas in Malachi 4 than there is in all of denominational you know why they' substituted things of what they've already believed and tried to bring him into the message but the message is the Mustard Seed it cannot be hbed there's no way you can mix this with anything else is a pure unadulterated word of God yes sir when was the last time you said Hallelujah when was the last time you raised your hand when was the last time you said amen the last time you let that person come out sir I want to read you what brother Brown says I believe everything he says but I won't stand for it I believe what our Pastor said on Sunday we got another Spirit we got another attitude another Spirit now again did you ever think of this let me ask you something he said look at me a minute this is my hand that's my finger this is my ear this is my nose but who's me y that's not me that's something that belongs to me you with me this is my hand this is my nose this is my ear that's not me I'm not an ear if you describe me and you said hey this is it's the guy with the nose no that's not me see this is my hand but who is me that owns the hand are you with me there's a body you are part of the body what are you you are the Bride of Jesus Christ tell your neighbor I'm the part of the all right you're way too excited where sister Rebecca are you excited about getting married okay where where's she she's real quiet right where's a sister that that's that that's not quiet that that that is happy to be married sister that's happy to be married 62 years right how much how many years 47 okay anybody else happy to be married yeah you're not sister you're not you're not convincing me no this is Supernatural are you happy to be a son of [Applause] God all right you you sing you sing awesome you sing like you you you're going to town right that's it that's it are you happy to be a son a Son of God that's good anybody else happy to be a Son of God wow wow wow you know why there is something that has happened to us we've been taken up higher our Spirits have come out it's another Spirit don't let the devil take away your spirit it's an attitude it's an attitude it's you've learned anything from Sunday you've seen a man that has given his whole heart to you before him you saw another man that gave his whole life to you our pastor give his whole heart to you he don't hardly ever cry but I saw him Sunday crying saying I won't lose one of you your response the spirit and the bride they both say [Applause] come at the same time transfigured before us my finger my nose my hand is not me that's the house that I'm living in well there's got to be something in there called me amen something in there that's called me come on come on come on me's got to be somewhere because this is mine you see me is somebody because I own something I have a hand it's mine well who's me that that belongs to that's your spirit well it depends on what kind of spirit that is and who you yield your members to if you're coming to church and you're sing that's not the spirit and you come to the house of the Lord and say I didn't I I worship wasn't very good today because because you just heard somebody but when you hear somebody whose name is the Lord Jesus Christ in my father's house are many mansions if they were not so I would not have told you but I go prepare a place for you you may [Music] be is mine brother hallelujah amen I believe that one is mine how many are owners hallelujah amen so when the lamb went and took the book but actually what he was taking was your heart give me your heart give me your heart you know why because out of the heart forth the issues of life I tell you church tonight give the Lord your heart yes amen and when you give him your heart he takes the book and what happens when he takes the book there is a Mount Transfiguration happening they don't see you no more saw no man Jesus it's transfigured one day my papa is going to come to brother Caleb and he's going to stay a little bit longer and then the next time he's going to stay a little bit longer n yeah it and then the next time he's going to stay a little bit longer and then the next time he ain't letting go and then the next time brother Dan the dead in Christ are coming back brother Charlie comes and hugs you the resurrection is on you know why it's not a fairy tale it's one omnipotent on the earth for the heaven when he calls for the Heavenly he stays a little longer until all of a sudden let's go do some work for 40 days why why a body has thou prepared me house will you build when Moses sets up the Tabernacle now I'm going to finish with this he sets up the Tabernacle it was the tabernacle was fashioned or the tent was fashioned or the body was fashioned according to what he had seen on Earth the measurements were the same the throne room measurements were the same the throne was here the seat was here and they were the same measurements that he had seen in heaven so when the sh Glory would come down upon the Tabernacle and God Almighty would sit down fit him perfectly this is my rest when you prepare your body a Living Sacrifice according to what has already been given to us he comes and sits in the Throne of your heart and when God Almighty sits there it fits him perfectly he has found his rest he has found his house what house will you build me where is the place of my rest he has rested in you you are the rest of God you are what Martin Luther could not figure out what had not been revealed to Martin Luther revealed to you but had not been revealed to John Wesley been revealed to you what has not been revealed in the Pentecostal Church There Was An Open Door come up High that has been revealed to [Applause] you well I know I'll stay here I'm impulsive I'm hot tempered I'm insightful and all of that fits and you can stay where you're at I ain't G to believe that well yeah stay where you're at but let a let Pentecost come into your life I'm not talking about a denomination I'm talking about experience I'm talking about the infilling of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about God coming and sitting down in his throne I'm talking about the rest of God I'm talking about the mysical body and when that happens
