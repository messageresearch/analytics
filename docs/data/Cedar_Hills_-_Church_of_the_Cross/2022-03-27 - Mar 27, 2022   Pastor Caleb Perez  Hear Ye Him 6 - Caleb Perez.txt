and how he loved us one more time see what the lord has i'm so gracious and or thankful to god for for being so gracious to us a certain message here uh this morning for this morning and uh the lord changed it yesterday so uh well we'll we'll put out what we well the lord gave us it was such an inspiration for this message as you can see here hear ye him number six with the subtitle from preview to live amen so let's see where the lord takes us matthew 17 one through five good to have all the visitors that are here this morning when you have it you can say amen after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringing them up into an high mountain apart says and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light is and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make three tabernacles one for thee one for moses and one for elias is [Music] and while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye lost amen revelation is the fourth chapter and the first verse good to see you lucas god bless you bud amen it reads like this and after this i looked and behold the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter it is lord we want to tell you we love you so much this morning lord thank you for being our god our savior king our lord you are everything to us we thank you for all the efforts that were made to be here for them to be here this morning those that are listening lord and online father we pray as your word goes forth that it would find a good ground lord when when amen when we look at both of these scriptures we find that that these scriptures are rehearsals they are previews as we all said we like previews we get anxious sometimes sometimes we want to see it right away anybody ever happened to yeah i can't wait till that one comes out like they say usually the the the anxiousness is usually greater than the actual viewing of but here we have a tremendous rehearsal in matthew the 17th chapter tremendous rehearsal it's a preview of what was coming then we see that john what a blessed disciple he he was because he kind of gets a double fold of it right then later on in his life he ends up being thrown into uh put on the isle of patmos and then he gets to continue watching and seeing this how it's going to unfold all the way but now he gets to see all the seven church ages and how it goes all the way to the end so then the bride must be a very special person why because she is is beloved so how many of your type is was john typing i i i say he was talking he was typing me why is the lord having me preach this message at this time because many times there are still people that that doubt they doubt their i mean i want to be part of it i want to do my part i don't know i got too many problems too many issues i i don't know if i'm if i'm a part of it or not so when you see a preview or a trailer the the first thing that you want to know is what you're going to talk back to me today upcoming attractions and what's the first thing that you ask when you when you see that the title okay what else ah that's right uh maina who's in it yeah that'll determine a lot of times whether we're gonna watch it or not no i don't like that that actor i'm not gonna see that one oh i kind of like them maybe i will see it and ultimately what is the movie about it i mean what i mean is it worth i mean storyline that's a good one and and so when we finally get to see this drama or the movie or the play or whatever it is there's one thing that is always certain you know what that is there's one thing i'm going to say again that is always certain well that's certain too that that's a good answer right rotten tomatoes are good tomatoes oh i gotta add that one to the list critic there is always guys gotta go through the hall of critics that the characters that you saw in the trailer or the preview are the exact characters that are in the movies does not that's right i change that one for a little bit one more time make sure you you're awake this morning we are awake this morning all right make sure we're awake because we want to we want to really drive this home today and then you know in the trailer and then when the movie comes brother sam walks out imagine you going to the go that's not what i paid for that's not what the rehearsal was about it doesn't make no sense right nothing isn't no false advertising i want my refund notice this now this is this is what we want to we want you to focus on today and most people would love to be in there's a brother there's a little brother's here everybody else is like no no it don't interest me everybody wants their 15 minutes of fame i think i could do better than them that would be wonderful the crazy thing about it is that we would we would be okay being any character we would be happy with with being the one that that is dressed all messed up ugly [Music] notice this now pikacy some of you don't know this much there's no saving but i was in a movie i know you'll say i know you're wanting to you're wanting to know all and i took a road trip with my brother-in-law ray and we stopped in universal studios universal studios and there yeah i made a movie i know you'll see you guys want a copy of it but i have to sell but in that movie brother henry henry you thought you were the only pilot in the family your brother was a pilot too and in that movie and that was who i was i was a pilot i was in this movie and and uh you know i i uh i was with a lot of celebrities i was with uh the blues brothers establish blues brothers i know you don't you don't now you're saying no the brother's not telling the truth it is true i was with jaws yes i was uh with um john wayne wayne he was already dead and i was still with him in the mood i had those flying saucers of the war of the worlds after me [Music] and so many countless other celebrities i don't even remember who they were but i'm going to give you the whole the the gist of this movie was was granny's bag and everybody was wanting to get a hold of granny's bag so one would get it and then cowboys and indian the indians came they were riding off and then they threw granny's bag granny's bag and kept running with it after a while granny's bag got thrown up in the air wow wow now let me go into my message i'm going to leave him hanging out because everybody doing it all they want to know is what was in the bag imagine the surprise as time went on that the lord showed me that i would be in another great drama it was the greatest honor of my life that i could be in a great drama the greatest drama that has ever has ever been told not a fairy tale not a man-made drama [Music] and that god would be so mindful that he would permit me to be in this great drama but not only me every one of you that is here this morning god has allowed you in and has permitted you to be part of that great drama now the tremendous thing is what i what i started with is that john and and these these these other disciples they they saw the rehearsal of it and the ones that they saw notice this now the ones that they saw cannot be different than those that actually came today that's right if if the preview showed who it was back then i don't know if that excites you but that excites me i think we should give one to the lord jesus this morning because he has allowed us to be part of this great this great drama when i'll say again oh what a script oh what a plan now for there to be a storyline this is important now for there to be a storyline i want you to get a hold of that this morning one more time you cannot have a storyline comes and draws the finite together what story line do we have of elohim when he existed of himself do we see a storyline historically oh there's a storyline all right but because in our state or our condition watch has the how the great spirit the great fountain the great elohim coming and putting on flesh changing his mask and then he would choose mere mortal men to follow him and be a part of his great drama drama then one day he takes these three of them and he takes them up a mountain and is transfigured before them we remember brother tim when he preached that message in in in december if you have it up there revelations chapter 4 of the message no the message not not but let me just go on because he taken peter james and john pedro up into the mountains apart oh amen amen how many can say amen this morning oh they were brought into into view of watching the kingdom of god and god takes one of them as we heard a while ago the next quote if you would jesus loved john jesus john was a man of love and they were asking he said what will happen to this man what's going to be his estate [Music] though he lived on earth the next the next clip and after the rest of them was dead and gone john lived to see the coming of the lord rehearsed in power is issued john saw every bit of it how many here are still the type of of john or john was the type of of the bride john saw every bit of it how many of you see every bit of it wait wait wait wait wait there's a disconnect here oh something's wrong somewhere because if john is typing the bride john saw every bit of it how is it possible somebody might say well brother ah i didn't i haven't seen every bit of it but don't you want to see every bit of it how else are you gonna know the part that you play we're already at the end we don't have a lot of time to sit here and say well maybe the lord just show it to me like that he already showed it god sent a mighty prophet through that great message all these mysteries would be unfolded you and i could see every bit of it hello everybody come on we gotta know where we're at by now ah life i beat and be won that's right we should be live already right i'm gonna stand hallelujah notice this now though we want to keep on going here but i want you to those are things that i want you to think about he saw every bit of it and the millennium over the millennium the kingdom age started millennials so he keeps his word doesn't he is the question does christ keep his word yes he does once again john saw the kingdom of god come in power the resurrection he saw the rapture he saw the ushering in the millennium there had to already be a film about it that's right i'm gonna say it again the only way that god could have showed john this is john had to get in the spirit to already see the the film that was already that was already made how's god going to show him a film that hasn't been made yet but he's showing him the rehearsal the preview of it all and so if you've seen the rehearsal there's nothing to be afraid of anymore right now that's right we heard brother abraham on friday we're afraid it's because we haven't seen the preview of it you already know what's going to happen up here is to practice in preparation for a public performance it's to train and prepare by means of rehearsals to retell or recite or repeat practice makes perfect here's the disconnect sometimes they say practice and we get some good messages why are we so worried about what everybody else is doing or saying keep your nose let's keep our nose on our face business nosy hello everybody i'm sorry i didn't mean to get off on that accident let me get back on the right okay don't worry about somebody else's part they have a script that is made just for them each or rehearse your own life just plainly ask you a question how many of you have seen the rehearsal of the resurrection this is what the holy spirit is trying to get to us how many have seen all the marvel movies marvel movies because it shows us the priorities in our life are wrong he does not have preeminence that's right hello everybody it doesn't have preeminence we can tell you every movie that has come out of hollywood but when the question is asked how many have seen the rehearsal how many have seen the rehearsal of the resurrection [Music] brother branham that says the rapture when's the last time you saw the rehearsal of the millennium you wouldn't even know how to a month later we're going to start messages all right you ready please you learned your lines right do you even know what the movie's about you didn't spend time to look into it no let me find somebody else that would be interested in being in part of the greatest drama there's ever been prevista they read it over and over and over again this is most people i already met read the rapture like long time ago no no no when you're rehearsing okay we need to hear it [Music] my heart begins to turn once again how can you be in a rapture when you have not seen the preview so i'm telling you it's not coming attractions anymore we're in the middle of it everybody understands it's not something that's coming look what the lord has done what we waited for has come to pass what has been shown as a rehearsal how serious we must be about these things no one loves me forgive me that's not part of the script hello everybody oh no i kind of i start to understand why the lord had me preach this message nobody cares for me that is not part of the script [Music] that's part of somebody else's script but it ain't part of the bride you've been given parts is yes but isaiah then says this is me for i am undone i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts i'm going to read the next three just in english then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a life call in his hand he had taken from the with the tongues from off the altar and he said or he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged and i also i heard the voice of the lord saying well whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i yeah then said i here am i send me i'm ready now ah praise the lord this is really where the prophet's script began here am i send me a kiss now that's part of the script come on you want to know what your script is i'm just a sinner ain't by grace that's part of the script i've been called and justified and glorified the script says let's see if we find ourselves in the preview of this one you ready how are you going to go in the rapture and not even know what the rapture is about do you understand how important this is once again how many have read the rapture then let us start doing those things in the message of rapture he says i remembered that night before i seen that i seen the preview of the bride now we're going to see if the preview of it coming attractions stood there and seen a beautiful little lady she was just correctly dressed nobody had to tell her you're not dressing right that's a little too tight you shouldn't dress like that no idea nobody had to do that because from within her [Music] do we find ourselves in the preview of the bride of the church this morning which preview do we find ourselves oh there come the asian church you talk about a filth here come the european church and then i heard a rock and roll come in come on you think it doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to here comes the church not the bride the church and it was miss america i met a good church like lystia she didn't even have any clothes on wow what an x-rated preview [Music] but it was the condition of the church the church i [Music] you know how you feel then i thought god hide me. and we say that as ministers god hide us if i could just get away from here i didn't want to be there in other words if all that we've done and that's what we produce and then when them woman passed by doing all kinds of rocks and things and short hair and painted face and all this hacienda the rocky they were supposed to be virgins before christ [Music] and me know that me a minister of the church he owned me in israel and that's what i produced for him i said oh god i can't look at that let me die let me fade away like that and as soon as it went out every now and then one of them would come up [Music] they'd go to a certain place and then they would just drop off and i would just hear the sound as it went away but then come on thank god for this then something like onward christian soldiers and here come that fainted bunch of little girls against just exactly the way it was all correctly dressed their hair hanging down way down on their back smooth clean they look like one out of every i noticed one of them trying or two or three trying to get out of line is it an ice cream yogurty thing stay in line yesterday day in line get out of line [Music] my question that was that was in what was it in 1965 and sometimes it makes us think well then what chance do we have 1965 is saying could it be already passed my question is what was passed the preview of the pride [Laughter] [Music] come out of her my piece that was already he says could it be passed yesterday then through all the years that he preached it was the preview of the calling out of the bride then what is going on today desire has been to dwell in his people is morality is we're at the closing of history estamos a la alfin de then shall be no more and there is a great drama being set up and the angels are standing over the skies watching it wow the angels have box seats los angeles [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] i've seen them somewhere that's what we were waiting was the last one on the book [Music] oh my goodness i don't know what time i started but it's okay no service this afternoon good call that's audible let's get this done can i get this done and then you can have the rest of the day off watch what he says here now where did the curtain open then for the great the angels are watching with us and asking those questions who is this you but you can also see the rapture church making herself ready you can see the presence of god vindicating and making the is what a thing okay you can and i hope they have it up there they can get put it up there from that time i pray i believe and upon the stand that i have taken for god around the world of who finds themselves in this preview and you see what god has done he's put it right back in the lap of the people i've been thinking about this for a moment because here he is oh he would take the hand vibration let me see what's going on a germ something going on we saw that then he began to discern the hearts now that's leaving now coming up into another higher ministry because first it was well let me see i've got to go and i got to see you see if brother brandon can pray for me [Applause] under this okay who finds themselves in that premium but i cannot say it until he speaks to me you know [Music] because now a little later if i get a chance this is watchmen water of the night i'm going to tell you something that recently happened he says bringing in the new ministry he says where i'll just speak the word and it puts it right back into the lap of the people again give me like 15 minutes and i'll finish up we all know that jesus now listen closely to this we all know that jesus all his words were written in red letter bible that's what it shows they've even and that's the new testament but they've also made a red letter old testament and so when we when we see him he says to be able to speak it the problem is is that many times we don't even believe our own our own words we were up there yes on wednesday we're talking about different things if your words were written down would our words be written in red or black jesus words were written think about it for a moment but even you say well that was him in his car in his corporal body here on earth but when he spoke to oh he was not in that body yet his words when he said i am jesus whom thou persecuted but this is the kicker [Music] yes sir the bible said it is he that testifies that sayeth it was the angel that was testifying [Music] [Applause] then [Applause] and the preview has already come [Applause] yes her words are written in red that's when she says i forgive you that's in rojo when she says i love you i give you grace so the bible says the spirit the relation you might say brother you say that a lot every time this is because the fifo ministry is part of the script you're going to need it one of these days you're going to run across somebody that's going to will the bride have a ministry it'll be made up of apostles and prophets teachers evangelists pastors it's going on now what kind of spirit would want to change that scripture but if there is a false ministry there's got to be a true ministry and that ministry doesn't preach their own message but what happens to people now listen closer let's see who we that's not our script going to say it again that's not our script the gentile dispensation started with the worship of a holy man and it'll end with the worship of a holy man who was that holy man that they were worshiping daniel the prophet that's right they love to use this quote god only deals with one man he don't deal with many men many men have many ideas and i say amen to them amen that's what he said and i say amen to them but who is that one man who is that one man oh this man is the one man now wow that's not the script today brother branham never pointed anyone to himself the people always to jesus christ hear these words jesus of nazareth approved of god what else do i need than that jesus said if i be lifted up because i i'm gonna go ahead and read it down since genesis heaviest thing the beginning el principio surely somewhere god has a man amen that he can lay his hand on now what brother branham said and i say that's right for he he's more than one man now is [Applause] because we're coming down to the gathering time the harvest time now this is not for any other reason but brother jacobs told us this yes and all honoring [Music] oh he said she said i didn't see three men i saw one man hallelujah that's all she saw then we won't have to be looking to see who would be the the next guy we can lift up notices now the only way that we can walk as one man the recognition that everyone has their own offices everyone has their own jurisdiction and we are we are taught don't get out of your jurisdiction in a local assembly there's one man there should only be one man the highest authority is the husband he is the father of the holy spirit but what about worldwide that's easy if i go visit brother fabio yeah that's the one man there yes what do i do i submit to that office and then when brother father says whatever you like whatever the lord gives you you preach whatever god means give me the okay i don't know where it's at but i'm going to try to say it without let's see i can say it has that's what he would say everywhere we would go you say 16 men are going to africa one man is gone and you all are part of that one man [Music] the body and the drama work together you're each once said in god's economy come on this is the way it works yes all the time and communes with god that doesn't mean that there's only one person that fast okay but we're watching god's economy one more time one fast all the time and communes with god we don't need to fast and do to do all that stuff but there's somebody in the body that doesn't because of the one that's fasting i like that man that's good stuff to me that's why he can cast out devils somebody in the body is what makes god omnipresent he knows all things so he doesn't have to be everywhere wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute this is good stuff and i'm finishing up with this how is he omnipresent watch this now the scene was set the actors are working omniscient knows all things makes them omnipresent and the very we're going live now [Music] they see there'll be over 300 pastors there the preview has already been seen diego did you see the previews spectacular to go they don't even have enough money to get to the place where we're going to have it for them you got to provide a place for them to stay you got to provide water that's there for every day you got to provide you know what we told them brothers pray about it because look at him just for the food and the and the state of is [Applause] and and then as time gets closer you people that have caught the vision and you back it up part of it we get 20 000. more than enough to pay for it and now i say well brother now pray because if you want to to help them in their in their in their trip we can pay for their transportation it's not a bunch of people from las cruces we're from phoenix or from colorado or from wherever you understand it is one man it is one body doing this
