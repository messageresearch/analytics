[37:51] oh
[37:52] it's not hard to believe
[37:57] standing on the mountain tops of glory
[38:02] [Music]
[38:09] when you can hear the songs of angels
[38:13] and the breeze from heaven send your
[38:17] story
[38:25] but in the valley once more
[38:29] would jesus still belong
[38:32] that's the question
[38:34] [Music]
[38:40] cause believing
[38:43] when believing
[38:44] [Music]
[38:56] and i need faith for the times
[39:00] when the sun
[39:02] doesn't shine
[39:04] and the mountaintop is just a
[39:08] memory
[39:11] when there's no
[39:13] to be seen
[39:16] and i don't
[39:17] feel a thing
[39:20] to the word of god alone i must
[39:24] [Music]
[39:27] i be strength for the days
[39:31] when troubles come my way
[39:35] and i just don't understand
[39:38] what it means
[39:42] that's when nothing else will do
[39:46] faith alone will see me through
[39:50] and believing
[39:52] becomes my victory
[40:01] oh it's not hard to believe
[40:06] when things are going well and skies are
[40:10] sunny
[40:16] oh when you feel you're making progress
[40:21] doing good
[40:23] living in a time of plenty
[40:32] but if all that should change
[40:36] would you still
[40:38] keep the faith that's the question
[40:42] [Music]
[40:47] cause believing
[40:50] when believing
[40:52] isn't easy
[40:55] that is the testing
[41:02] and i need faith all the times
[41:07] when the sun
[41:08] doesn't shine
[41:11] and the mountaintop is just a
[41:14] memory
[41:17] when there's no sign to be seen
[41:22] and i don't
[41:24] feel a thing
[41:26] to the word of god alone i must clean
[41:33] and i need strength for the days
[41:37] when troubles come my way
[41:41] and i just don't understand
[41:45] what it means
[41:48] that's when nothing else will do
[41:53] faith alone will see me through
[41:57] and believe it
[41:59] becomes my victory
[42:03] and oh
[42:06] and i need faith
[42:09] for the times
[42:12] when the sun
[42:13] doesn't shine
[42:16] at the mountaintop is just a
[42:19] memory
[42:22] when there's no sign to be seen
[42:27] and i don't
[42:28] feel a thing
[42:31] to the word of god alone
[42:34] i must flee
[42:37] and i need strength for the days
[42:42] when troubles come my way
[42:46] and i just don't understand
[42:49] what it means
[42:53] that's when nothing else will do
[42:57] alone will see me through
[43:01] and believe it
[43:03] becomes my victory
[43:07] oh and
[43:09] believing

[1:06:37] because it doesn't seem like there's
[1:06:38] ever enough time to spin with the body
[1:06:40] of christ
[1:06:44] and i made friends as i've passed
[1:06:46] through here a couple times
[1:06:47] brother daniel amigos
[1:06:51] worshipping a minute ago
[1:06:54] and i accidentally call him the accident
[1:06:57] because there's a few daniels in my life
[1:07:01] and siri just assumes that i want to
[1:07:03] call the brother daniel down around las
[1:07:05] vegas
[1:07:08] then when you get him on the phone and
[1:07:10] you didn't really mean to call him
[1:07:11] you're like
[1:07:26] anyway god has a time for things
[1:07:30] i wanted to say thank you to brother
[1:07:31] caleb
[1:07:35] for the fellowship yesterday we took a
[1:07:36] few minutes
[1:07:39] and it just caused
[1:07:47] [Music]
[1:08:08] and he's working
[1:08:26] and he's very thankful and so are we
[1:08:28] we've enjoyed our fellowship
[1:08:30] and last night i saw fellowship with
[1:08:32] brother robert and sister spring
[1:08:35] lucas and miles are fixing to have some
[1:08:37] cousins
[1:08:39] hopefully we figure out the road back
[1:08:41] and forth and everybody gets to play
[1:08:42] together every once in a while all right
[1:08:48] there's fellowship to be had
[1:09:03] is
[1:09:18] when we get to
[1:09:46] because
[1:09:59] as long as we
[1:10:14] absolutely
[1:10:19] seems like the holy spirit laid a little
[1:10:21] subject on her heart
[1:10:24] i asked some of the
[1:10:27] family last night the rodriguez i said
[1:10:28] what should i preach
[1:10:31] i already had to buy a bible okay
[1:10:37] and unfortunately there's a quickening
[1:10:39] that comes
[1:10:41] because i have two questions
[1:11:08] i'm sorry to keep you on your feet so
[1:11:09] long let's turn
[1:11:49] so we need the holy spirit interpreter
[1:12:06] oh
[1:12:19] it says watch yeah
[1:12:22] villa stand fast in the face that firm
[1:12:26] in the king james version here
[1:12:30] it says quit you like men
[1:12:35] if you take that into like an amplified
[1:12:37] translation
[1:12:40] paul is simply saying pablo's
[1:12:43] implemented
[1:12:44] be a man
[1:12:46] be mature
[1:12:47] stand fast
[1:12:49] be courageous
[1:12:53] don't be afraid
[1:12:56] be strong
[1:12:58] let all your things be done with charity
[1:13:03] i beseech you brethren hermanos you know
[1:13:06] the house of stephanos
[1:13:09] that it's the first fruits of achaea
[1:13:12] and that they have addicted themselves
[1:13:15] to the ministry of the same
[1:13:20] my brother told me he was going to help
[1:13:21] me with that
[1:13:24] you have a spanish bible it doesn't have
[1:13:25] that word
[1:13:29] i'm talking about my addiction
[1:13:43] we'll pray together at the end of
[1:13:56] i believe in a body in order as this one
[1:13:58] is in
[1:14:12] i actually believe we have a perimeter
[1:14:13] guard
[1:14:16] brother uh
[1:14:19] caleb shared a testimony with me
[1:14:20] yesterday
[1:14:25] in africa
[1:14:30] [Music]
[1:14:54] there were deacons evidently there
[1:14:55] obviously men that were responsible for
[1:14:58] keeping orders
[1:15:00] as the disruption began to mount
[1:15:05] of course they can correct the testimony
[1:15:07] if i get it wrong but they
[1:15:12] and because the word of god says
[1:15:16] mark 16
[1:15:19] we'll follow those
[1:15:22] that believe
[1:15:52] the spirits the spirit
[1:15:54] manifested themselves
[1:15:57] in the natural realm
[1:15:59] and they slammed the door on their way
[1:16:01] out
[1:16:03] sometimes
[1:16:46] being
[1:17:14] it's
[1:17:29] i believe in these men
[1:17:31] it didn't take me a few minutes at the
[1:17:33] table yesterday
[1:17:37] no ego
[1:17:39] actually
[1:17:40] the only ambition i witnessed
[1:18:10] but
[1:18:27] and without that offspring
[1:18:30] it dies
[1:18:32] we were talking about the revival
[1:18:35] there is a revival in christ that has
[1:18:37] come in this last days
[1:19:06] that will
[1:19:19] the word of god
[1:19:34] the word of god
[1:19:37] when i was listening to brother caleb
[1:19:39] and brother tommy talked
[1:19:40] about
[1:19:42] they almost finished each other's
[1:19:45] sentences
[1:19:47] i almost said sandwiches because
[1:20:17] said you know my brother kind of started
[1:20:18] preaching when he was four years old
[1:20:22] and he never stopped you know
[1:20:24] and i said well i kind of know what
[1:20:25] that's like
[1:20:27] i didn't tell him yesterday i'll tell
[1:20:29] you all
[1:20:31] my mom and dad had gone into this little

[1:20:44] zealous about the truth of what god had
[1:20:46] done in our days

[1:20:55] my dad told my mom
[1:20:58] i believe the preachers are right jesus
[1:20:59] is coming back
[1:21:02] but i don't know all there is to know
[1:21:04] about the word of god
[1:21:10] and if he ever did something
[1:21:26] that before he returns
[1:21:28] he's got to
[1:21:30] send somebody on the scene like he did
[1:21:32] john the baptist
[1:21:35] said and if god don't show me pretty
[1:21:37] soon
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:39] it was or is guinness
[1:22:08] my
[1:22:19] is

[1:23:11] that had a one window
[1:23:14] a mattress on the floor
[1:23:16] and a bathroom in the corner kind of
[1:23:18] makes you
[1:23:33] and she said i would have to keep you
[1:23:35] quiet
[1:23:37] i held your little sister
[1:23:39] i kept you on the mat
[1:23:42] she said the first time the anointing
[1:23:44] ever fell on you
[1:24:06] and you said she said you looked around
[1:24:08] she said we had one chair
[1:24:09] already

[1:24:59] church

[1:54:47] and that ark is not yes
[1:54:52] neither is it
[1:54:54] good works
[1:54:57] it's by one spirit especially
[1:54:59] we are all
[1:55:01] baptized
[1:55:16] brother tom
[1:55:18] finish his sentence
[1:55:22] because it's the same spirit working in
[1:55:24] both
[1:55:25] spirits
[1:55:27] when brother diego
[1:55:28] diego is he here this morning
[1:55:32] why when brother diego prayed over the
[1:55:34] family that was traveling
[1:55:38] under divine inspiration of the holy
[1:55:39] spirit
[1:55:42] god heard his prayers
[1:56:25] you have seen daniel miller
[1:57:21] i don't know how many offspring christ
[1:57:23] has no problem jesus sometimes
[1:57:27] we're too careful
[1:57:30] we're too guarded
[1:57:32] we're too protected
[1:57:35] and we don't hear the word of god
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:53] that's got to have a donkey
[1:57:56] run my leg
[1:57:59] into the wall
[1:58:01] because the donkey
[1:58:04] had more spiritual eyesight
[1:58:07] than the prophet of god
[1:58:12] donkey bailey wanted to kill his dog
[1:58:15] that's the way some people do you got
[1:58:16] incredible servants
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:35] hey
[1:58:36] there's an angel standing right there
[1:58:37] with his sword drawing
[1:58:40] because you're disciplining god
[1:58:45] that'll preach
[1:59:41] if it wasn't for a godly woman
[1:59:45] watching the prophet's back
[1:59:50] we need men
[1:59:52] and women
[1:59:54] have god that's yours to raise up okay
[1:59:57] and to learn the word of god raise the
[1:59:59] eye

[2:00:04] baby
[2:00:06] women can you say baby i love you
[2:00:09] this comes first
[2:00:18] [Music]

[2:00:36] realized this morning

[2:00:54] point in the pier

[2:01:07] can get my skirt

[2:01:12] get it wrapped around me

[2:02:11] their children don't follow in their
[2:02:13] ways
[2:02:15] but it always
[2:02:18] one example we'll move on i'm almost
[2:02:20] done

[2:02:23] eli's sons
[2:02:25] we're like
[2:02:27] and for a moment like moses
[2:02:47] and that is not the condition of the
[2:02:49] bride of jesus
[2:02:51] christ christ does not want us dead
[2:02:54] he wants his life manifested in us
[2:03:46] a few years ago i
[2:03:48] i've done so many job things in my life
[2:03:50] it's embarrassing
[2:03:53] a few years ago
[2:04:34] remember laying there about two o'clock
[2:04:35] in the morning
[2:05:15] and he didn't stop with the second adam
[2:05:17] he actually took me to a revelation of
[2:05:19] justification
[2:05:22] the reason i'm sharing this with you is
[2:05:23] because of the comment brother brown
[2:05:25] just made in that quote
[2:05:28] he said your past doesn't matter
[2:05:32] neither how good
[2:05:35] one of my testimonies used to be that i
[2:05:37] never smoked and i never drank
[2:05:41] i found out that didn't have nothing to
[2:05:42] do with my salvation
[2:05:46] so excited about what i had done i used
[2:05:48] to brag about it
[2:05:54] i wasn't helping anybody
[2:05:57] because when i went to preach
[2:05:59] there were going to be a lot of young
[2:06:00] people are you are mucho hoevenes and a
[2:06:02] lot of you old folks
[2:06:04] that couldn't say
[2:06:06] no
[2:06:06] they never smoked and they never died
[2:06:09] so when i'm up there beating my chest
[2:06:10] about what a great thing is
[2:06:14] that religious
[2:06:28] much less about the second attack
[2:06:36] and i prayed
[2:06:38] and i fell asleep praying
[2:06:41] i said god please don't ever let me get
[2:06:42] a religious spirit
[2:06:45] i didn't mean lord i didn't mean to hurt
[2:06:47] your people
[2:06:49] i wanted to help your people
[2:06:53] but i was going to have to stop certain
[2:06:55] actions
[2:07:22] fellowship with the rodriguez last night
[2:07:23] gabe was there
[2:07:25] rodriguez yeah he was going to give
[2:07:26] birth to a rodriguez
[2:07:28] well he's not and he is
[2:07:30] but
[2:07:31] rodriguez right i think that's right i
[2:07:34] know in some cultures it changes
[2:07:36] you guys last name rodriguez now that
[2:07:38] i've walked out on this plank
[2:07:41] he's going to give birth to a baby
[2:07:42] that's going to bear a name
[2:07:46] when a holy ghost
[2:07:48] person experiences the birth of christ
[2:07:50] they become christians
[2:07:52] receive it
[2:08:07] if there's still work for us to do in
[2:08:08] the continent of africa and other places
[2:08:13] i assume he's going to give me more
[2:08:14] revelations
[2:08:18] because when i went fishing the other
[2:08:19] day i couldn't walk out on the river to
[2:08:21] get in the boat
[2:08:25] i had to use the dock
[2:08:31] my king didn't need a dog
[2:08:34] necessity
[2:08:38] another one of my buddies you know i was
[2:08:39] talking about my three hebrew buddies
[2:08:41] right
[2:08:43] i had another buddy one time
[2:08:45] he learned from the king
[2:08:48] that he
[2:09:03] the molecular structure
[2:09:05] and walks through it
[2:09:07] philip needed to be somewhere else
[2:09:10] so god gave him the faith
[2:09:13] i'm assuming
[2:09:15] not to be too who nope
[2:09:31] say i wasn't there
[2:09:33] all i do know
[2:09:34] is that one minute he was one place
[2:09:37] next minute
[2:09:40] somehow there's revelations
[2:09:42] by me because i have to drive a truck
[2:10:11] and it's mine yes me because
[2:10:27] it's all under the shed blood
[2:10:32] you cannot overcome yourself
[2:10:37] that overcome
[2:10:39] for you
[2:10:40] you
[2:10:54] what
[2:11:18] just like putting a little baby's arm in
[2:11:20] a sleeve hole is
[2:11:35] preacher comes out and preaches on
[2:11:36] holiness why has he got to be harping on
[2:11:38] holiness
[2:11:42] just let us
[2:11:44] rush you because of god's garments
[2:11:49] how pleased the king
[2:11:57] [Applause]
[2:12:10] i told some saints brother josh had an
[2:12:11] experience with god the other day i said
[2:12:13] i come on a holy roller until josh
[2:12:15] prayed through it
[2:12:20] i was trying to hold him because i
[2:12:22] didn't want him hurting himself i didn't
[2:12:23] know i had never seen a birth like that
[2:12:26] what's going on i've been to a few
[2:12:27] birthings just thought there was a new
[2:12:29] one and you know that's the message
[2:12:31] about your birth in christ
[2:13:00] specific calling
[2:13:13] the thing you have to overcome is
[2:13:15] yourself
[2:13:17] your idea
[2:13:18] your thing
[2:13:20] and surrender yourself to him
[2:13:22] he overcome alvin
[2:13:25] knows the way
[2:13:27] brother will
[2:13:29] when i willingly do the blood will never
[2:13:30] lose his power is that okay i'm going to
[2:13:32] sing i can't probably sing so y'all me a
[2:13:35] choir can sing from where you're at how
[2:13:36] many of you believes the blood is the
[2:13:37] same today
[2:13:40] i'm going to read one more scripture
[2:13:42] and then we're going to uh turn it back
[2:13:44] to the pastor i'm going to i promise to
[2:13:47] pray
[2:13:48] whatever happens may it be the will of
[2:13:50] god
[2:13:52] first john
[2:13:54] chapter 3
[2:13:56] my little children let us not love
[2:13:59] inward
[2:14:01] neither in tongue
[2:14:03] but indeed
[2:14:05] and in truth
[2:14:07] and hereby
[2:14:09] we know that we are
[2:14:11] of the truth
[2:14:13] and shall assure our hearts
[2:14:18] for if our heart
[2:14:21] condemn
[2:14:23] us not
[2:14:24] represent young people listen to me for
[2:14:27] just a minute you've got things going on
[2:14:29] right now you know when you do it you
[2:14:31] don't guess
[2:14:32] how it makes you feel you know
[2:14:36] part of that is because your mom and
[2:14:38] daddy had the good sense to tell you
[2:14:40] that's not a good idea
[2:14:44] it don't make your mom and daddy feel
[2:14:46] good
[2:14:48] it may be a little bit their own pride
[2:14:51] i taught you better than that
[2:14:54] your actions
[2:14:56] may condemn them
[2:15:00] i don't care i mean i'm important if you
[2:15:02] live on their revelations
[2:15:05] until you get one in your own
[2:15:21] what do you think about these heels
[2:15:23] i imagine brother caleb feels about
[2:15:25] heels like brother branham felt about
[2:15:26] heels
