that day where I can look my savior face to face and say it was worth every minute and everything and every pain that we've ever gone through at this time we've come to the most important part of the service and I and I know as song leaders we say that service after service we don't say it out of tradition because we don't believe a god of traditions but a living God who's alive right now and it's the most important part of the service every single time that we can hear straight from his throne it is my great honor to introduce my friend but more importantly my brother brother Jimmy let's sing

here tonight Lord to speak to the redeemed Lord to speak to those that you purchased with your own blood how would we ever defraud that redeemed product Lord we stand here to be a blessing to your children Lord realizing that we are just human flesh so here in the pulpit and in the audience we surrender to you Lord Jesus speak to us this night we ask it all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen and amen amen as you're standing let's turn in our Bibles read to James chapter 1 and we're going to read verses 12 through 19 and I want you all to think tonight so at first you might think well what are you talking about you follow along and if you feel led to take notes go home and study the word this is not just a Wednesday and Sunday matter is that every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before the title of our message tonight is what are the colors of the master Diamond our subtitle the mystery of us there's a mystery about us and it's not way up here so simple that if we don't watch out it'll go right over our heads and we will'll never see it amen as we read the scripture now blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised to him them that love him and let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust is enticed amen what is this lust that it's talking about here most of the time we think about adultery or drinking just doing bad things but we're going to find out that this temptation that it's talking about oh it can get to those things if we don't surrender to the Lord but it's not really talking about that kind of lust verse 15 then when lust have conceived it bringeth forth sin which is unbelief it bringeth forth sin which is unbelief and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death amen let us pray Lord we just thank you for your word Lord we just thank you for this privilege to speak to your children in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated am just keep reading do not error other words don't make a mistake my beloved Brethren watch this every good gift and every perfect gift notice good gifts and perfect gifts you know you are partaking of the good gifts right now and that's not talking about anything spiritual that's talking about a normal life you're healthy enough to go to school healthy enough to come to Church you have wonderful parents you have good friends you have good food you have a roof over your head those are good gifts how many are thankful for what you have but now perfect gifts the those come from above amen and cometh down from the Father of Lights we're going to get into what these lights are how many would like to know what the lights of the master Diamond no yeah yeah see see yeah see yeah you notice I didn't say no again no with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning God's not going to change his mind he's not going to be one way one day and another way the next day he's not going to treat you any different than he treats any of his other children sometimes we think well this brother seems to be our sister gets treated better than the others that is not true it just depends on how much of God you want is how much is going to be seen in your life of the goodness of God Amen amen of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruit of his creatures other words the first of his creatures that he created or the first ones we are of those creatures why did he think so much about us what does the word creatures mean here in the Greek it talks about the very early de development of the creation of God that he is creating in you that many times that you don't or I don't understand amen amen now notice it says of his it's talking about Temptation in the first few verses and then it talks about lust and Temptation and sin and then all of a sudden out of the blue he talks about gifts it's kind of kind of seems like there's something missing there even though there isn't and then he goes from there to the word of truth that has been begotten in us now that word begotten uses begat is not the new birth you notice in Spanish it said but when the word is begotten in your soul it's conceived in the spiritual womb of your mind oh yeah it's going to be born yeah amen it'll be born again but this temptation that it's talking about is when anything comes against that word that you have been begotten of that's the Temptation it's talking about here but then he says all these good gifts and these perfect gifts that coming down from the father oh my goodness he sees our condition he knows exactly what we need and even though we may we may be led astray by our own desires at times every good gift and perfect gift cometh continues to come down from the father of lights aren't you so happy for that you I was following up an inspiration that I spoke a little bit in Norway and in Poland that's why I put the subtitle of the mystery of us there's something about us that we don't yet understand but he's revealing it to us amen through the the word that we have been begotten of are you with me so far now if you study at home you'll really get itay and you meditate day and night in the word and you you're going to get some stuff that'll it'll you'll never be the same again now I would like to go to our first quote and before we do I want to read what the prophet said about a mystery and he says it in the message sir is this the end I'm going to read this quote here but I want to refer to this because he's talking about what a mystery is how many want the mystery of who you are to be revealed who you are in yourself no no in him oh that that's the important thing but he says in this message that a mystery is a scripture that is previously hidden truth that is now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element remains even though this mystery has been revealed and for you that are new in the message Mark it down in your notes Revelation 107 in the days of the voice of the seventh Earthly messenger why do I say it that way because that's what the word there angel means from the Greek when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished amen and we're not going to really get into that but to make it sweet and short are you a part of the mystery of God what part of the mystery are you so you ready oh my now as we read this and then we're going to go afterwards to First Corinthians 12 but let us read this it wasn't that God don't deal with a person a group I want you to get that we're a group but when he deals with you he's not always dealing with me the same way God don't deal with you as as an organization he deals with you as an individual an individual individually we are baptized with the Holy Ghost in other words I can't give you the Holy Ghost the baptism you need you've got to receive it he's going to give it to you individually but watch what happens after he baptizes you with the Holy Ghost the first time and I'm saying it that way on purpose we can go justification or repented I turned my back on the world I told the devil I want nothing to do with him no more God forgave me of my sins I was baptized in his name he has cleansed me or he looks at me as if I never did it oh now then he Sanctified me justification let's say it together we know this heart right together justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the majority of what you'll hear today is that once you get to the point where you begin to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the majority will say you're sealed until the day of your Redemption but it ain't that way I know that that's that's a rough one right there that's a delicate one he is beginning to examine your box car as we heard on Sunday you're born again you're a baby do you that are new spiritually you can say Pap papa papa papa cuz you're a baby well a baby doesn't even know how to crawl it first and Jesus is not coming for a baby he's coming for a fully buture bride oh yeah that that baby's born oh that baby could even speak in tongues that's right a language that you don't understand you even know what his name is maybe your your blood blows in his veins if he's your family member but he's not yet in the position to be sealed for the Rapture amen amen amen so that that let that settle a little bit in a while we'll see how it all connects together now collectively we are baptized into the body when we are baptized with the Holy Ghost Brother David gave me this quote on Sunday you're baptized individually but then we're baptized collectively into the body in other words you received it as an individual but you don't function as an individual that's why it says collectively amen are you following it now notice before we go into that you you follow me so far individually each one is baptized with the Holy Ghost God dealing with each one that was his purpose scatter them across the Earth so he could deal individually with them let's go to the next paragraph amen or maybe I didn't give it to you think I did okay here it is but instead instead of that what happened now notice what he says first why he wanted to baptize them individually and to make them function as a body in the beginning that didn't happen but instead of that what happened God had to separate kain's people from Seth's people and he sent Cain away he separated him so he could deal with his church amen we're going to see how what this means to us what what what is this separation talking about right now separating one generation from the other or one brother or sister from from the other no because both Generations afterwards mixed but what has to be separated is the part of the evil can that's in your flesh oh brother I'm a Son of God oh yeah I believe it I'm God Amen you mean to tell me this stinking rotten thing is going to live eternally I've heard people say oh oh man I'm already perfect already have rapturing faith and I would asked what brother Tommy asked what in the world are you doing here you should have already been gone amen amen watch Cain was separated now watch God separated Eve's evil can from Adam's holy Seth wow we'll leave it there keep reading there we're going to get into something else amen praise the Living God so notice let's go back and talk about the supernatural element now we're going to connect this to see what these lights are of the master Diamond amen amen are you happy notice there remains a supernatural element where is it what does that element do amen amen is it super to God no no because that's just the way he is all the time well then how can it be Supernatural let's say it together he's the super super and we're the natural amen that's what makes it Supernatural it's not Supernatural to him because it's his very nature of what he is what motivates him that's what makes him act what makes him love you and me his very divine nature of his Divine love amen amen Supernatural so without you he cannot be made manifest as super wow what how many can give a hand clap to the Lord for that one wow how privileged are we then to be an attribute of this Supernatural God and the only way he can be known as Supernatural is through you I don't know nothing about the supernatural that's even better then you can't put your own ideas to it amen praise the Lord Jesus now order let's go back to what we said about the first time you begin to receive the baptism of the Holy go you're a a baby then you grow to be a child and then you grow to be an adult the problem is a lot of times have you ever seen a child just he's been crawling around he gets a hold of something he picks himself up and he tries to take a step and he falls on his face well he thinks he can walk but he don't have his balance yet that happens to you and me in the spiritual amen and amen amen now I would like to go to our second scripture in First Corinthians 12 and I want you all to mark this down you will hear this scripture quoted probably hundreds of if not thousands of times here in the message because our messenger speaks about this scripture so many times and it seems like something so simple that we think we understand it oh I'm sure we understand it a little bit and I guess I better hurry up I'm almost already been going a half an hour but see I don't want to run with this I mean I got some stuff here that'll blow you off your seat but if you don't get the how to get the foundation right for it instead of getting you to go up you might not recover it'll do it'll make you or it'll break you as the old saying goes first Corinthians 1212 for as the body is one and have many members all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ we're all members of members right but it's not 100 people or 100 bodies in the spiritual it's one body now watch this first part here of verse 13 for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bonded or free and have been made to drink into one spirit how many have been baptized into the body okay justified by faith Sanctified cleansed satisfied for service then baptized with the Holy Ghost brother benam says you've been baptized into the body and the Pentecostal said oh boy that's it I'm ready for the Rapture no no you can be baptized into the body and not even know what part of the body you are but you're in the body but the mystery of what you are the mystery of us lays within that body as the Holy Spirit begins to baptize us over and over again until we begin to understand who we are in Christ and when we understand who we are in Christ there's not a devil that can take it away from us nobody that could ever treat us so bad that we would even get discouraged I tell you what we've been through some things look T like sometimes the hardest ones that learn how to get along together are the people in church we don't see what God's doing in our brother and sister if we could understand the same thing he's doing in us doing in them he's being patient with me can I be patient with my brother and sister can I look Beyond the Veil of this flesh and see that God is dealing with my brother and sister to see that they're growing in the Lord verse 14 for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body now we know Brother David used the scripture sonay but as he was speaking on it this started to open up to me if the foot was to say to the head or the head to the foot I don't need you who's the head anybody there's got two or three answers that are correct so don't feel like it depends on depends on whether you're speaking in the spiritual or the natural well the head says I don't need no foot I don't need feet Christ doesn't need the feat or the pastor doesn't need the feet what does the feet represent where are we shed prepared for the gospel of peace we're shot in the feet Ephesians 5 go read it oh the head has it all but no unless somebody's prepared to take that gospel then the head can't do nothing the next verse and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body what do the ear represent how does faith come Faith cometh by the so the ear can't say to the eye what does the eye represent come on the prophet of the age so you can't hear the the word of God and say that you don't need the prophet if the whole were hearing see is if the whole were hearing the next part of the verse see where would be the smelling where would be the discernment keep on going next verse if the whole body were an eye I don't need nobody to teach me the Holy Spirit anoints me the anointing teacheth me all things and I have no need for nobody to teach me nothing you're just saying you're you're your own eye where were the hearing go to the next verse Verse 18 now God has set the members in every every one of them in the body as it has pleased him amen amen next verse amen that's okay let's go to something yeah there it is but now are there many members yet but yet one body do we understand that in other words I can't do anything bottom line without affecting the body what we do oh I made the mistake on my own and you know this and that and the other you know I eventually I'll get right with God I Feel So Unworthy I'm just going to go over and sit in the corner and you think you're just hurting yourself no no because we're one body amen amen and the ey cannot say unto the hand I have no need of the that's what many in the message are saying today what does the eye represent again what does the hand represent fivefold Ministry so the prophet doesn't need the five home Ministry we just need the eye I saying to the hand I don't need you again neither the head to the feet I have no need of thee brother this is a boring message oh yeah but it's getting right down where we live yeah so we can really understand one another and truly love one another because if you don't make it I don't make it brother Tommy would always tell us the young ministers at that time would ask him real tell me what happens when you can't continue how are we going to make it and he says stick to together that's the only way you're going to make it I don't care what happens I don't care what the devil says I don't care what ever Rises up in the church together that's the only way you're going to make it my time is gone so I'm going to skip the second quote guys and I want to go to the last quote out of Hebrews 1 no it's the message Hebrews chapter one so we can see what the lights of the diamond are man I can tell you I get excited do you get excited now the diamond when it comes forth it's just a big smooth round piece of glass there are blue diamonds black diamonds emerald and a clear diamond white diamond Clos then when it's made and put into use there's a part of the diamond has to lose nobody likes to lose the chips off of it knocks little chips because when it comes into direct light it makes a sparkle the chip what makes the Sparkle is the way it's cut that's rough and one will be a green light the other will be a blue light maybe another an emerald light and a red light and the different lights go from it like a rainbow color they call it fire in the diamond now each one of those lights represents gifts represent you want to know there's a gift that goes with you every one of you has a gift what are you with me you're happy I got till 8:30 I'll be quiet we got to get am Christ is the diamond he was the one who came and was bruised and wounded and chipped that he might reflect himself back as the light of the world master Diamond that where the lights came from like we we saw in James every good gift every perfect gift come down from the father of light that's what it's talking about here now when these great lights went out or great rays of his Spirit love peace that's all there was there was no well better read it I'm getting I'm getting too crazy here there wasn't no suffering there was no hate oh wait a minute wait a minute there was no malice it couldn't come from that fountain that was Jehovah that was Jehovah God now the theologians call it a theophany that went from that which is called in the scripture the logos the logos that went out of God it's hard to explain it's the part of God these lights are gifts where did our spirit come from in the beginning where did our spirit rotate out of the logos Theos notice these lights also rotated out of the logos could it be that God was already thinking of the gift that we would need in our Earthly Journey and yet today I'm talking about in the message I'm not talking about out there anymore most people don't even want the gifts they say the perfect interpretation of the word has come which it has and that finished the gifts you cannot prove that to me with the Bible neither with all all of everything that the prophet says and if somebody would like to sit down and talk with me about that I would love it doesn't mean I know everything doesn't mean I can't learn from you I can definitely learned from you but all of what God has provided let's get our last scripture 1 Corinthians 141 and we'll finish even though we're not going to finish remember he said out of this Fountain came this pure Sweet Love Peace there was nothing else what kind of Love Is thato Love natural human love or is it Divine AG that's where it came out from and notice how Paul now with his prophe and his aposh is trying to help the Corinthians to focus on what's important first then God could put the gifts into operation in the correct way follow after Divine love charity how many can say amen and desire spiritual gifts how many have a desire for spiritual gift oh brother Jimmy you mean I have to prophesy speak in tongues you mean I have to interpret the tong what in the world is wrong with that no it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost no no no no but it's what's coming out of the logos all those lights that came out of the logos right after you came out of the logos one of those lights that represents a gift he predestinated it for you and brother Bren even said I speak in tongues and more than all of you Paul said I I wish you would all speak with tongues do that mean we want a bunch of disorder in here we're not saying that we know the order how many of been here when the Holy Spirit speaks in tongues and then he brings the interpretation how many of that were in Silver City brother Danny you remember this C even sister Cecilia God used her in the gifts for a period of time brother Tommy set up the little room as we stand to our feet and that were gifted went in there they would put a brother in there paper and Pen maybe a recorder the Holy Spirit would descend someone would speak in tongues the interpretation would come and it hit like clockwork remember brother Danny well there be times when visiting ministers would come and we already knew what they were going to talk about we already knew some of the things that God was going to do gifts hogwash excuse me well brother Jimmy you speak in Tong better believe it all of a sudden I'm just praying and all of a sudden what where am I I think I'm in my closet I start speaking in an unknown time I'm not saying everybody has to do that then sometimes God starts telling me what I'm saying what it means and I write it down and I preach on it and it lines up with the word follow after charity desire he made to be in the church all nine gifts all nine fruits of the spirit all of God's divine nature that comes from his word must be here until the coming of the lord lord Jesus we just thank you Lord maybe a little different tonight we've had precious people God used them in the gifts but we may not be here forever if you your coming doesn't come as soon as we would think we need people that desire spiritual gift they want to find out the mystery of who they are in Christ which of those lights represent the gift that God wants to use in them so that it can continue to the coming of the Lord we love you Lord we thank you now in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God bless [Music] [Applause] [Music]
