[37:17] a three persons
[37:20] three manifestations of that same God
[37:23] don't tell us
[37:25] and he says that's enough to hit the
[37:28] devil in the ribs
[37:32] every day and make him squeal like a pig
[37:40] I'm going to tell you again
[37:42] by you being here tonight
[37:45] made the devil squeal like a pig
[37:52] it's time that somebody else should be
[37:55] afraid
[37:57] I ain't afraid no more
[38:00] if there's anybody that should be afraid
[38:04] it's the devil what we did this morning
[38:08] you magnify and glorify God
[38:12] enough to hit the devil in the ribs

[39:10] tired of the devil pushing them around
[39:14] that the devil is afraid tonight
[39:19] because greater is he that is
[40:19] these are the things that
[40:23] if any men love the world of love of the
[40:27] father is not in him
[40:29] for all that is in the world
[40:33] the lust of the Flesh
[40:35] and the lust of the eyes and the pride
[40:39] of life
[40:42] but it is of the world and the world
[40:46] passes away
[40:51] and the lust thereof is their sales but
[40:54] he that doeth of the will of God
[40:57] forever

[41:08] look their children with them and
[41:11] brought them through the prayers
[41:14] it is time that somebody else be afraid
[41:19] this is the Commendation this is to one
[41:23] of the churches
[41:24] is that they were beating Satan in his
[41:28] own Thrones
[41:31] and they only had half away foreign
[41:42] [Applause]
[42:03] [Applause]
[42:33] leave God in his words
[42:35] they asked me last night
[42:38] if I would give a testimony
[42:42] through what God has done today
[42:45] they were talking about blind Bartimaeus
[42:48] in the Sunday school class
[42:51] and that happened 2 000 years ago
[42:55] they were talking about brother bran I'm
[42:58] about 70 50 years ago
[43:03] but I brought them to today
[43:06] in 1999.
[43:16] when the the service was just about over
[43:20] and when the service was just about over
[43:24] they brought a little girl that was
[43:27] blind
[43:29] when they brought this little girl that
[43:32] was blind foreign
[43:57] for the devil to be afraid
[44:01] I was looking in there as as I I saw the
[44:04] little girl with her eyes open
[44:08] we were alive to 16 countries
[44:14] and the announcer was looking
[44:18] he was announcing the next service
[44:23] eyes locked into the eyes of the little
[44:26] girls
[44:30] I remember brother Fabio Bernal
[44:35] cross the the running across the stage
[44:41] and he took the microphone
[44:44] he said I want you to know
[44:47] that God just opened up the eyes
[44:54] who else was there Michael
[45:36] and the world that God created
[45:40] we say we say oh God wants he wants to
[45:44] destroy this world
[45:47] God don't want to destroy this world
[45:50] he created this world
[45:53] you can go out and see the trees
[45:57] you see the mountains you see the organs
[46:03] where the angel of the Lord lives
[46:07] you say how brother
[46:10] the angel of the Lord lives there
[46:13] the other day he waved at me as I passed
[46:16] by
[46:18] you bro you say brother how can that be
[46:22] I just believe God's words
[46:25] beyond the word of God is the truth for
[46:28] to my generation
[46:31] but it cost us questions not a sacrifice
[46:36] it cost us death no
[47:32] What a Wonderful World God has created
[47:37] he's not coming to today
[48:04] immorality that happens upon the Earth
[48:09] because he loves the God he loves the
[48:12] world
[48:13] the Bible speaks to us
[48:15] God so loved the world
[48:25] but man
[48:27] decided they knew what love was
[48:32] when you go and smoke a cigarette that's
[48:35] not God's love because
[48:37] when you go and drink Thomas
[48:41] alcohol that's not God's love
[48:45] when you go with the woman that's not
[48:48] your wife
[48:52] when you do things that are against the
[48:55] word of God
[48:58] that's not the love of God
[49:02] Mundo
[50:24] but there was no place found for him
[50:30] [Applause]
[50:45] that
[50:48] looked like the like this man
[50:51] bro I have my way to go in
[50:55] and when it came to to this man he
[50:58] couldn't he couldn't touch at him
[51:02] but he entered into the serpenter
[51:06] Lucifer enters into the Surplus
[51:10] and when he enters into the circle
[51:15] says now I've got him trapped
[51:22] how did he do it
[51:25] traps the the devil
[51:28] Diablo in this in this man
[51:32] that was a serpenter that looked like a
[51:36] man yeah but without no soul
[51:40] can you imagine
[51:42] when God comes
[51:46] he pronounces judgment
[51:50] upon the serpenter and he says this it
[51:55] is he says now that serpent will bruise
[51:58] your heels
[52:01] but you'll bruise

[52:33] bones and the veins and the muscles
[52:59] yes see
[53:02] [Music]
[53:04] what did Adam do okay
[53:07] he portrayed the part of Christ
[53:11] of what in the future Generations
[53:17] himself would do for us
[53:21] and he crushes his head
[53:26] all through these sacrifices
[53:30] of bringing whatever they wanted to
[53:33] bring to the house
[53:35] after a while it didn't matter if the if
[53:39] the heifer or the turtle doves were were
[53:42] did not have no stains on them
[53:51] sacrifice
[53:53] it was just to appease
[53:58] God knew that that couldn't work for all
[54:01] times
[54:04] people so when they cut the lamb and
[54:07] they killed the Lambs
[54:09] Adam and Eve in the skins
[54:15] and those skins would hit their legs yes
[54:22] that in the future
[54:25] it would also come alive
[54:32] he was not going to just give us an
[54:36] angel
[54:38] he was going to come himself in flesh
[54:42] was gonna die for Humanity
[54:47] we look into the times of Moses
[54:51] and all of a sudden the people started
[54:53] talking against Moses
[54:56] fiery serpents started biting people
[55:02] then what did they do
[55:05] they were dying
[55:07] but all of a sudden they repented Moses
[55:10] the Lord told Moses
[55:12] make you a serpent and wrap it around a
[55:15] pole as the universe brass
[55:21] signified
[55:23] sin already
[55:28] trapped him again
[55:30] but let me tell you the greatest the
[55:33] greatest place
[55:48] the devil says I got you
[55:52] and Jesus he Jesus in the garden brother
[55:57] Branham says died more there than he did
[55:59] on Calvin Harris
[56:06] that came down
[56:09] he died of a broken heart
[56:13] completely ruptured
[56:17] but he knew that unless that seed
[56:22] or forget
[56:34] and he would
[56:36] hold it
[56:38] it was not his sin
[56:42] it was our sins
[56:44] there's a there's a story
[56:48] just in a few more minutes
[56:51] there's a story
[56:53] I only study of a man
[56:56] that saw this man cry coming up the hill
[57:02] and as he sees him
[57:06] he sees him with a big old bag
[57:10] as he gets closer
[57:12] he finds out that it's the Lord Jesus
[57:18] and he says he's saying Lord Jesus
[57:22] are you carrying the sins of the whole
[57:24] world
[57:26] he says I'm just carrying yours
[57:34] he took upon our sins
[57:41] he said let that be bite me
[57:44] where they are me once and for all
[57:48] to settled the sin questions
[57:54] the day I died
[57:58] because I died in him
[58:01] every day I died in here
[58:04] went to Calvary
[58:07] I died
[58:10] man Paul says
[58:12] died with him
[58:17] and when I died
[58:19] that was the greatest day of my life
[58:25] I shall be your death
[58:28] no more can sin govern me
[58:32] no more will it rain over me I am an
[58:36] adopted son of God
[58:39] and when I recognized him
[58:43] he looks at me and he says
[58:47] you see that serpent right there is
[58:50] he low enough
[58:54] all you have to do is
[58:58] he already did it on California
