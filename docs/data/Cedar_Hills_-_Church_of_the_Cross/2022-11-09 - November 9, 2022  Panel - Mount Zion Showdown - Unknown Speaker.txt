to voice the word of God in this panel and uh so we're uh we're grateful to God for life and uh there's been a quite an attack on our on our young people and our children people almost almost passing uh passing on but in all of these things uh we we know him that that is the the one that is the sustainer of our lives uh I'd like to where we're uh we're uh we've uh been we're coming across our tasks tonight and so we're we're here to speak on the Mount Zion Showdown yes and you know we we know that the prophet of God speaks about the the challenge of the day and he speaks to us about the challenge of the hour and we know that that there are scripturally and and knowing this the Bible the message of the hour yes there are three great showdowns I I Tres Grande and so we we don't want to take too much uh uh of going into into a lot of detail no queremos but we want to go into what what is uh our our portion tonight how many have been enjoying now all the panels and I I we've been enjoying it I think to to be able to to speak with you I want everyone to understand one thing tonight we only have one message we have one messengero and and his name is William Miriam Branham is William Marion we don't have a message or or or uh anything without him but we do understand that what the message produces and the message is required to produce a certain things we are then proud of products or manifestation of what the message is the 48th Psalm uh Salmo it reads like this and this is to start off the Mount Zion Showdown how many know what a Slowdown is one two seven if you come to church because to be happy solo to have no problems if you've accepted the message of the hour so you could kick back you've you've you've you've joined yourself to the wrong thing but if you've come for the purpose of understanding him and to know what he he has given us which is the responsibility of his word then it does bring us to a showdown in pontes but I like the uh once we we read the scripture we'll we'll we'll tell you about before there's a showdown there's got to be a show up uh uh Psalms 48 says this is great is the Lord and greatly to be praised this is Wednesday and so I know that that sometimes we're a little we're little little lackadaisical or tired on Wednesdays but great is the Lord [Music] now your neighbor great is the Lord greatly to be praised City above our God in the mountain of his Holiness beautiful for situation Hermosa Provincia the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion is on the sides of the north the city of the great king now there is we've we've understood by the scripture and understood uh Brethren Germans how many showdowns tell me which ones they are dressed uh there's Mount Carmel Showdown Caramelo there is uh and the third one Mount Zion Showdown and that's where we find ourselves at today yeah brother brother brother Seth tell us what happened at at carmelon El Monte Carmelo well there's a lot of interesting things that happened at Mount Carmel this is the reason why we're talking about because it's it's actually a continuation of the same Showdown is to further explain the Mount Zion let's go to Mount Carmel all right the gentleman upstairs Carmelo sorry brother Jim if the gentleman upstairs would uh put the picture or the map of the location of Israel mapa yeah let's try to try a different one almost you can see on this tip to the left kind of where it makes a point there's Mount Carmel ah yes that montage and it's on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea is and rather than just being a single Mountain Mount Carmel is actually a high wooded Mountain Ridge is is located by the Mediterranean Sea and the City of Haifa location and the word caramel in Hebrew is Vineyard Orchard or garden of God and reflects the fertile beauty of the mount carmel's pitch picturesque slopes and you can see Mount Carmel right there so Mount Carmel is also known in Arabic Elias Mount Mar Elias which is translated Mount Saint Elisha or Elijah so this is Mount Carmelo Egyptian records note that it was a holy mountains a high place that was a center of idol worship so here you find okay allowing um going outside of his people and marrying a idol worshiper foreign how he married Jezebel and brought in the the pagan gods of Baal and asherah and and for this that Bale was the actual D favorite deity of Jezebel uh who they claim was the god of rain and vegetation and fertility but our God is a jealous God Thou shalt have no other gods before me and God calls for a three-year drought through Elijah so just real quick think about that they thought they worshiped the god of Baal who they thought brought them Reign and all this Prosperity but they didn't realize that God is the one that created the heavens so it took that man Elijah to go up and gather the prophets to the top of Mount Carmel wanted so like you said that he showed up Elijah and our day showed up and he told Ahab you've heard the story call ye on the name of your gods foreign and so it came to pass that it came for The Showdown and it came to pass at the time of offering that the prophets of Baal another opportunity to to worship their God opportunity he was right that he was their God okay so Elijah gave him all day and even mocked them but it came to pass at the time of the offering it was Elijah's turn yeah it came in the evening time anybody know about the evening time message there shall be lied about the evening time so no coincidences in the evening that Spirit of Elijah is so amazing because he was sent to turn the hearts destination of Israel back to the Lord in that evening time even so today in our times was able to turn our hearts back to the Lord Jesus Christ so what I find was very amazing pop look this place of Mount Carmel Carmelo was an idol worship place and they try to put their altars on it but Elijah actually went up to bring them back bring their hearts back to God it's a very very important important point tonight you know that God does does or or the Jewish people when you find out what they do they do it together individuals everybody has everybody in America we're all individuals of what we possess in America whatever they have they have it together in a tribe that's why they always have a lineage that's why they always say this he was the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and they can go back and back and back and forth into their tribal order because they don't view themselves as a personal they identify themselves in their tribe that they belong to in the nation which they belong to Inland that's why they're called the people of God is that's right and so it's the same in our day you see Jezebel types the Catholic Church the mother of Harlot and how she caused all these and even worse trying to cause the children of Israel or the true church or like even our nation as Ahab types the president United States of the Pagan worship how many prophets did did was was that this scene of the of this of this showdown remember we even though there's three showdowns it's one continuous Showdown we never want to lose fat of it that it continues how many prophets were there my knowledge is for about 400 prophets does anybody have a story of uh or a testimony of did that happen in our time Argentina no that was in Chicago wasn't it is it when Chicago that that is a showdown you know every time that you go and do something for the Lord there's a showdown somebody I'm going to be happy for you to do what you do for the Lord ladies uh sisters you wear a dress and you go you go to the store there's a showdown man you go and you act differently there's a showdown you don't cut your hair ladies there's a showdown you believe what you believe there's a showdown every time somebody gotta stand up in our generation the challenge of the day you know you know you you if if our lives don't pattern of what we're supposed to do but I have come Jesus says that you might have life and that more abundantly every day what you believe comes down to a showdown even in your own members it comes to a showdowns and your body at times will Rebel according against what you actually believe is but this is where this is where we're all at the in the in The Showdown so finally up or finalizing The Showdown there had to be something in Elijah that just irked him about these false gods is kind of like the way the Goliath called out the children of Israel something that's that David couldn't stomach yeah no support So Elijah's turn he's calling on the Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he's telling them to let it be known the day that you that he is the god in Israel and as he's proclaiming this the Lord comes down in a consuming fire and picked up the sacrifice water and rocks the Lord himself showed up and the people fell on their faces saying that the Lord foreign so I want you to know take this last part of The Showdown everyone knew who was God because of who who showed up and through the showdowns you have Elijah you have God but Elijah remembered the Mosaic law and the reason I say that because when we get to Mount Transfiguration you see Moses we remember that in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 13 chapter one he had to bring Moses on the scene you see just because God showed up didn't show up you still have the false prophets that are there alive Deuteronomy tells us if there arise among you a prophet suenos and then he says let's go after other gods and serve them the law says let him be put to death that's very important in our life because many times God shows up and we can't go and kill what a tremendous picture brother bro and and a tremendous testimony brother Seth just got through telling us do you have to add to to our to our showdowns so much give a little background we're talking about um and after a while we're gonna go into the difference between the Z and the S right this is it gets really really really nice I was talking to brother Seth upstairs and uh I was uh mentioning to him that I read yesterday that the word Zion in Hebrew and I mentioned I said is actually used as a feminine term is I think that's very important to remember here so we know that God works in threes uh we're talking about uh we mentioned the three showdowns and I want to speak about three different seeds now if you guys can quickly return to your Bibles in Galatians 3 16. do we have any pictures this is this is going to be this is going to be really good here now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ is Christo and you guys don't have to turn to it but I'm just going to read it real quickly Genesis 1 11. and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind okay seed in itself upon the Earth and it was so conformation now uh I wanted to start with the quoted brother Branham here and if the guys can get the pictures ready now there has been three different kind of seeds planted we have a denominational seat is Oral Roberts Oral Roberts there's Billy Graham there's Billy Brown Billy Graham nominational seat Billy Graham Billy Graham my brother Brown calls him the head planter next Oral Roberts for the Pentecostal organization it wasn't a Pentecostal seed it was a Pentecostal organizations Pentecost is not a movement thank you and then the third C that was planted we all should know who this is anybody know who this is The Showdown so the word seed has been planted plantara now I was going to ask kind of the seed but everyone should know who painted the seed between the Malachi four or five right so the spirit of Elijah anointing a man from Kentucky named William Marion Branham now the seeds have already been planted the denominational seat of the churches we got the Pentecostal seeds the Pentecostal organizations [Music] Tommy Hicks Oral Roberts and brother Brown says they're all great men of God where he says I believe the word of God has been planted and there's a key word here this is unadulterated away from any of those organizations we had the three preseason we know that Christ is the word seeds now you guys might be thinking well what does this have to do with The Showdown tell us we got we got three seeds that were planted right yes everything to do with it these three seeds that were planted they're all growing together we all believe that we're about in The Harvest Time and every seed that is planted is coming to a showdown or a show up now each one of these seeds believes that they're a bride you asked the Pentecostal organization they believe that they're right organizations and they believe sincerely that they're bright they're good people is now they all might be Brides it might be a church pride in English a religious but there is only one word now these three seeds might look similar as they're growing yeah it gets you excited tonight but until the point where they start to bloom and show what life was inside of them from the very beginning now at that point is when we come to The Showdown so if these three seeds are believed to be bright what actually separates the bride from the other groups and brother Tommy asked us this question the other day to be honest I was stuck yeah it's more digging and I called our pastor yes and the Lord just opened it up now it comes down to one thing that is by God's foreign now these religious Brides novias really shows us if they were the bride see what an anovia God would have to judge the World by what they believed by what the church is but we know that God will judge the World by Christ's word now here we have the groom Jesus Christ the word and we have the bridegroom yeah what separates her is she recognizes what part of the word she is she is the very fulfillment of Malachi 4 5 and 6. he says here now remember every spoken word of God is the original seeds God handed everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the original seeds now listen here you can see mue uh-huh so there you see the reproduction of the Original Seed production which is the bride that has made herself ready and how has she made herself ready and he gave some Apostles from evangelists and teachers man that that's also a showdown and that's the that's the whole the whole the whole thing is where we're you know you know when you and I've said this maybe time and time again but but sometimes you get something different sometimes but if you there's a song that says that if you've never had a problem you would never know that God could solve them man you do know what I'm talking about right we're all humans we all have problems you've never had a problem you never know that God could solve them how how was David ever revealed David was revealed by his problem which was the giante only your problem will D will will reveal who you are that's why we give God thanks for for the problem for the trials the Bible speaks so that there are more precious than gold tried in the fires because they reveal who you are well you have plenty of money in the bank car is brand new everything well works fine you love the Lord you raise your hands there's no problem Only The Showdown and only the giant coming into your Valley will make the King show up and reveal who actually David was brother Henry here you come a a a a a king and um and he comes and he he wants to take a take a hold of this this city which is which was which was part of it was Mount Zion and Mount Mount Zion montession is a is a is a is a mountain it's a people it's a place it's a condition is the nation it's a nation and brother Branham says speaking of Zion and I believe that the church today only in its conditions it's only a place that God's bringing the church that when it all breaks what a time of rejoicing when the redeem stands someday to Crown Jesus [Music] king of King and Lord of lords when he's sitting on Mount Zion and all around the earth with the redeemed singing Redemption angels will stand off on the sideline is extend Zion to the whole earth so Zion is a confusing thing what was that is that confusing confusing thing the scripture tells us it's a confusing thing we're talking about it but is it please well it is confusing and the scripture tells us that is confusing is let's go to to the other Showdown are you talking about Mount Zion that's the mountain in the north of London so the most uh if you can pull the map back up the most northern mountain is called Mount Hermon Del Monte at the northern border of Israel you see in Christian tradition in the tradition Christiana they say that the mount Transfiguration Showdown is and I bring that up because they say Christian tradition which to me is Catholic church with an elevation of roughly 1800 feet but the scripture says he took them to an exceeding high mountain 2000 feet is not very high Los milpies ten thousand ten thousand Millions you got a mountain right yes there's a picture we have of Mount uh let's go to Mount Tabor almost and you can see the city on the left yeah it's a it looks more like a hill but it's a communal Loma I couldn't go to the next picture uh go to the next one that's my table still hey you have another one sorry guys I didn't guess the label it I'll keep speaking all right picture of Mount Hermon look you have the picture with the snowy snow snow cap of Mount Hermon brother Genesis there we go you see the little city on the bottom unless you that uh yes sir yes sir [Laughter] get me all excited Hallelujah Mount Hermon ten thousand feet that's the exceeding high mountain means the sacred Mountain you can see that it's very snowy up there it brought a lot of dude because as Jesus brought Peter James and John up there he took them by themselves and was transfigured in front of them and appeared then appeared Moses and Elijah so in Mount carmelon God above us then is you see both Moses and Elijah it's important to have both of them they were the with Christ with Christ with them they were the three Heavenly witnesses there with the three early Witnesses you have faith hope and love did you know that that's over here that Moses been in that mountain talk to me talk to me but not not on the top of the mountain so he got my attention here we speak of Mount Zion and it's spelled the iron he says but the first time that is even mentioned is actually spelled s-i-o-n pero La primes in the book of uh Deuteronomy 448 given the directions of the land it says from Aurora which is by the bank of the river Arnon Del Rio even onto Mount Zion which is Hermann hasta Del montecione so the first time that we find sign in the Bible it is he identifies it as Mount Hermon La primervesque says David speaks a lot of Zion and praises the lore about this mountains [Music] because it is known and brother Brian brings that up that war was so special about this place but it was known and still known that God chose but z-i-o-no it's all in the Old Testament except in those two passages when David speaks of it once and then the first time that we hear of it is when he's identified as as it speaks in the Bible in the Old Testament about 152 times a zione I think it's only nine times as I am and it was a female uh word in the Hebrew [Music] then to the Greeks so it is tremendous to me that the book of Romans Paul says Romanos Pablo dice speaking of a showdown here as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling a precious Cornerstone angular preciosa a sure Foundation establish he has he he that believeth shall not make Ace but going back to Moses Moses when he went around that corner is foreign which gets my attention to that Mount Carmel is in the promised lands is before Jordan well at that point if we take that in time on this side of the river Del Rio he asked permission to go across some property be the permission and the most fear people on Earth in those days which was the king of the amorites two Mega giants look like a little kid German so most of a cinder he was just never happened but he's already been there he passed through there Joshua and Kayla they learn how to kill Giants through that Josue in every showdown in Colorado seems like there's evil ever presente and then goodness so The Showdown is not for for the believer The Showdown is that something shows up so in our daily walk as we're talking sharing with the brothers every time there's there's a showdown then something has to show up I'll go back to caesarea or Philippi or somebody had to show up and Peter actually showed up because everybody's Jesus has asked them Jesus who the son of man is and it took something inside of Peter Revelation to him to declare but Peter the Revelation showed up in him Revelations that Jesus is the Christ is that really settle there or that started a process I would say started the process I didn't start at other showdowns absolutely everybody's gotta answer that showdown in their own life because no one can call him the Christ except by the holy spirit so uh the this area of Philippi right the scholars believe that that uh Mountain Transfiguration was actually in Mount Mount Hermon known as Zion yes maester because the last location before Jesus took him up into a high mountain was that that area there in caesarea Philippines so a previous chapter right there in Matthew 16 they're standing there and yes Peter comes out the greatest Revelation and he thought he was somebody made such declaration concerning who Jesus is Jesus and while they're they're in that condition up in the high mountains oh keep in mind as you follow Peter the moment that uh Jesus was always on his case Jesus and he said you know he would tell him hey Satan asked me for you and and and there was something about Peter too so at The Showdown now this is Peter's Showdown it is really we we call it the the Montrose figuration Showdown but there's not a showdown Elijah you get Moses and and there's and there is uh and there's Jesus yes and the supernatural event takes place there's no confusion there's not really nothing going on tonight Peter had a mountain figuration Showdown because Mr I'm better than everybody I know who Jesus is because I know him when The Showdown came up yeah the trinitarian part of Peter came out didn't he try to erect some Tabernacles Peter had trinitarian Tendencies that's what Jesus says hey I'm going to pray that your faith fell you not this is I'm going to fail I'm going to pray that your Revelation don't don't go against you within him there was something that caused him to to confess who Jesus was there was something there too that immediately he wanted to break it in three elements why don't we just build a turmeric one for you one for Moses this is The Showdown well and that's why I say in that part even in Mark Carmel they they turn their heart foreign in this message was really hard against the trinitarian teaching on the spirit behind it have you wonder why the Catholics decided to pick on Peter to make him the first pope Catholics I mean Peter was never even in Rome Pedro and roma right but period that was there upon this Upon This Rock I will build my church well they wanted those because Peter had trinitarian tendencies the Lord rebukes them how many know that yes now after that confession it's like every time Peter says something the Lord was on his case immediately immediately and and because he was hunting that spirit so then the Lord is speaking about his death and Peter rebukes the Lord a Jesus it I think it's in the book of Luke the music is in Lucas well I know it's different one different this the different scriptures said that I differences but but when the Lord is speaking about how he has to go to Jerusalem and and die then Peter goes and rebukes the Lord no don't talk like that no he's bringing the show down with him because even if people is confounded and remember that Zion brings confusion some people think science is Jerusalem are going to spend some questions and they don't leave Jerusalem because any anywhere outside of Jerusalem is wrong then even Mount Hebron which is very significant in the southern parts of Palestine is Palestinians when the Lord brings uh and mentions uh the New Jerusalem as Zion it's very confusing well Bueno what about Peter que de Pedro and it's trinitarian attendance is the spirit that after the confession of who Jesus is you know that in Mount Zion or Herman in the montession OR Hermon is known for three outstanding Peaks is so still has three points I [Laughter] mean um Peter descends and says Lord I will not leave you it is then the Lord tells him you will deny me three times before I knew this so you you will deny me three times we already show you colors up in Mountain speakers and he did deny him then he he had an experience he knew that his confession it's not good there was not alive in him because what you're saying he hadn't killed those false prophets those that anointing those called spirits espiritus I believe that after his experience to experience yeah he changed them why why was why do I consider this so delicate because Jesus said uh Jesus said in Matthew 28 in Mateo therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the Sun the liho and of the Holy Ghost Santo what if Peter would have got would have gotten hold of this without an experience yeah yeah because it's Peter later on after he said Lord let's build three Tabernacles here this is the Lord said hey I gotta pray for you because I pray your faith don't fail yes I will never leave you even if everybody does before the morning comes you will deny me three times that experience of feeling that he had betrayed the Lord and his confession it's experience when he had a New Birth really you know that later on Peter comes and says says repent he said repentios and be baptized said about this others the name of the Lord Jesus amen but he also said one more thing concerning zione in the book of Peter first Peter 2 6 and he says wherefore also is containing the scripture is a Chief Cornerstone La Piedra principal elect Gonzalo decision [Music] and everybody say amen amen for ye are not common to the amount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet is and the voice of Words which voice they that heard entreated the words should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountains it shall be stoned or thrust through with the dark and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake yo is but ye are common to Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem Celestial and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect so you you we find out then then that Zion or Zion is is the bride is placed in here there is there is a message that we believe there's a message that we should live cannot be something that we can just repeat it's got to be something that we say spoken word is that original so as we have received the seed in this last day it causes a manifestation to come out this is why brother Branham before in future home you can put this this one up here gentlemen before before he talks about what we're going to say this is where where the majority of people have and we all have our problems if we can't turn it around but this is what we have it all the first one el primero this is before we can ever go any further with God it says the first circle is the sinner is God comes he he cleanses the all of this and it comes into the person comes into justification it goes from Lost to Justified and he's cleansed of all these things that but according to the prophet of God that old serpent that thing that made you do it it's still in there and this is then where we come to a key is he said but then it becomes empty that serpent is taken out but what we want to do is to be able to come into Mount Zion it's a new nature it's a new creation this is where he has placed the Revelation this is before we can ever go to the Heavenly Jerusalem has got to be satisfied in our life who and The Showdown is for him that it that his is that is his we are either children or Sons and Daughters of God I always say this if the message only came to produce one son what a waste of a message but the message did not just come to produce we are living in the time The Showdown comes now now I I I was was traveling with our pastor the other day and you know sometimes I I had dreamed that maybe one time that that maybe one day I would learn how I could preach like my papa but when I hear these quotes from my papa foreign and gentlemen would you play the clip token there's a film that's one brother man says he says there's an angel and then he says and these fellow wrestles with Jacob and and when he wrestled with him in other words if you want to bring it down he says give him so many questions to these men to these fellow are questions like and is we we didn't see the atonement no you rejected the atonement and then he says uh well he says uh I'm in deep trouble everyone everyone has come against us the nations are against us we're about to fall fall to the Nations and and then and then when Israel is about to fall that's when this fellow comes to Palestine and that's when Israel wrestles with this Angel we know who that angel is and as a conference or they come for one with the other there's a great conference in Israel and then right at that point that the fellow says look I don't have any more time to to spend with you because it's fixing to break daylight and at seven o'clock in the morning the price going away but he don't tell him that he said he's fixing to break daylight there's a film that comes down yeah yeah you see this is Nosotros nopodemos Vero expression Grandes Leos encontra estamos apunto is angel Israel is a Mira no tengo mucho Tiempo karapasar con ustedes brother brother Ronnie thank you very much for this work the next piece but I'm gonna read it okay and the angel says he says but I got to hear more about it I haven't heard enough noise he says look you will see a signal I will give you a sign he says you will see two prophets coming in amongst you know he said they're Moses and Elijah they'll come and have a conference with you when that man is just my Israel to be let loose and that's when Israel is Born the name change you said it happened back there they were not even in their Homeland when their name was changed but when they're in their Homeland God will bless them in their Homeland useless not while they're out of their Homeland that's when the nation is born in one day by the spirit of the Living God then comes to fulfillment Ezekiel 37. brother Abraham the
