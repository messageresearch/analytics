[31:57] let us pray
[32:10] and may your children be able to catch
[32:12] what you're trying to tell them tonight
[32:17] and maybe you speaking through us
[32:20] as we surrender ourselves to you
[32:24] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[32:25] pray all this
[32:36] yeah one of the things that was said
[32:38] last week is
[32:53] [Music]
[32:54] fundamental
[33:06] amen
[33:07] many believe today that the bible has
[33:09] been interpreted so much and there's so
[33:11] many translations that you can't depend
[33:13] on
[33:19] but god's word
[33:21] he says here he's watching over it he's
[33:24] he's he's hastening it
[33:30] and you look up the word haste and it
[33:31] means
[33:33] it literally means he's trying he wants
[33:36] it to come to pass so bad
[33:40] he would love to fulfill it before its
[33:42] time
[33:45] but we know that in his time it will all
[33:47] be fulfilled
[33:50] if he hastens his word
[33:53] he's watching over his words
[33:55] how would he leave us with the bible
[33:58] that we could not depend on the heart
[34:01] we don't have a god big enough to keep
[34:03] his words
[34:16] amen what we're going to do is we're
[34:18] going to do a little review
[34:22] and i'm going to start with with brother
[34:23] ronnie here
[34:26] last week he spoke of
[34:29] the pilgrims
[34:30] that came over on the mayflower
[34:39] and i asked brother ronnie brother
[34:41] brother
[34:42] what was the main
[34:44] motive or reason why
[34:47] they crossed the ocean
[34:49] to a land they knew nothing about
[34:52] and landed on what was the main motive
[35:00] jimmy
[35:01] they uh
[35:03] they did it so they could worship god to
[35:05] to the dictates of their heart amen
[35:10] how many want to worship god according
[35:11] to the dictates of your heart
[35:16] uh
[35:17] what were they fleeing from brother
[35:19] ronnie is capable
[35:20] of running you know during that time
[35:22] they had a lot of persecution religious
[35:24] persecution from the from the roman
[35:26] church so
[35:28] they left there to come here because of
[35:30] the persecution
[35:35] yes sir so
[35:37] then you talked about the bill of rights
[35:40] and what an amendment was
[35:49] an amendment is a it's an adjustment or
[35:51] it's an improvement
[35:58] amen
[36:00] you have your main constitution is a
[36:02] constitutional principle and our pilgrim
[36:04] forefathers had these amendments
[36:10] and the whole purpose of these
[36:11] amendments was to protect what brother
[36:14] tom
[36:15] brother tommy that's a good one brother
[36:17] ronnie amano ronnie
[36:19] what was
[36:20] the main motive now of these amendments
[36:24] it was to to protect the rights of these
[36:26] people amen
[36:31] you know as just a real quick scripture
[36:33] there
[36:36] uh let's turn into psalms 29 3.
[36:45] and it says the voice of the lord is
[36:47] upon the waters
[36:49] amen the god of glory
[36:51] thundereth
[36:53] the lord is upon many waters
[36:56] amen
[36:59] verse 4
[37:00] says the voice of the lord is powerful
[37:04] the voice of the lord is full of majesty
[37:08] now as you know as brother jimmy said
[37:10] we let you know last week we spoke on
[37:12] the first amendment
[37:20] you know again that this for this first
[37:22] amendment it's the major one that is is
[37:24] under attack
[37:29] and it's again it's a freedom of speech
[37:31] is under the first amendment the freedom
[37:33] of press the freedom of religion
[37:35] the right to petition and the right for
[37:37] a peaceful assembly
[37:47] pacifica you know on april 25th of of
[37:50] this year 2022
[37:55] elon musk purchased twitter for 44
[37:58] billion dollars
[37:59] elon musk
[38:07] you know how many of
[38:09] you are kept up with the news on that
[38:16] got a few hands up there so so so he uh
[38:19] the reason why he purchased this this uh
[38:21] twitter
[38:24] twitter according to what he has said is
[38:26] because he saw how all these uh how
[38:28] these tech giants how they have control
[38:30] of what the people say
[38:39] they can censor they can censor the
[38:40] people they can block whatever they
[38:42] wanted
[38:46] i had a couple of customers that did an
[38:47] experiment
[38:49] and they what they did is they put out
[38:51] certain stuff on their accounts
[38:57] just to see what would happen and sure
[38:59] enough their accounts got blocked
[39:05] you know
[39:06] but why
[39:08] a lot of these tech giants they they
[39:12] they swayed or influenced the election a
[39:14] certain way
[39:15] estos
[39:20] and if they can control what the people
[39:21] put on there they can they can uh
[39:24] put make people's mind uh put in their
[39:27] minds to
[39:28] go for or against certain people
[39:36] now his his uh reason that if he sticks
[39:39] to it
[39:43] it's for him for the people to have a
[39:45] platform for to freely express
[39:46] themselves
[39:51] so the thing that captures my attention
[39:53] is this right here
[39:58] after he purchased this so people could
[40:00] have free speech
[40:04] the government puts out what is known as
[40:06] the disinformation board
[40:23] to have he he purchased this so people
[40:25] can have the free speech
[40:29] expression so but what the government is
[40:31] doing now
[40:33] if you put out a certain information
[40:35] that is true
[40:39] now the government can come in here and
[40:41] say well whatever such and such person
[40:43] put posted is is false it's false
[40:45] information
[40:49] but you know the crazy the the sorry the
[40:52] the thing for me that that stands out
[40:54] the most
[40:57] is this isn't something that's new
[41:00] you know there there was something that
[41:02] was it back in the in the early
[41:05] 19th century
[41:12] they had what was called the ministry of
[41:14] truth
[41:18] and again remember this is your first
[41:19] amendment that is under attack
[41:25] so we might not think that that this is
[41:27] something important
[41:31] because right now we're at liberty to be
[41:33] able to do it
[41:36] now now let somebody come and take away
[41:38] your liberty
[41:40] to be able to freely express yourself
[41:46] now it becomes a problem
[41:49] no if you can't if we can't come over
[41:51] here and preach the word
[41:55] how are we going to be able to come and
[41:56] assemble
[42:00] if we can't have if we can assemble
[42:05] how we can have a freedom of religion
[42:09] so so all of this is this all of our
[42:11] amendments are under attack
[42:16] but this one in particular has the most
[42:18] significance for the believer
[42:25] because speech is power
[42:29] to be able to speak
[42:31] carries a lot of influence
[42:36] speeches to be able to persuade somebody
[42:42] to be able to compel someone
[42:44] to be able to convert someone
[42:47] convinced
[42:50] to be able to bind or to be able to lose
[42:52] atar or
[42:55] our speech or our words
[43:08] so we see how important speech
[43:11] the most important is the expression how
[43:13] are we going to be able to receive life
[43:15] if we don't hear a voice
[43:19] now brother branham here in the message
[43:21] of the true easter seal
[43:22] the mano branham mensah
[43:26] he says and the voice of god
[43:29] hushed by greed and jealousy
[43:38] it's been that way in the church
[43:41] ever since
[43:44] iglesia trying to hush
[43:47] the true voice of god
[44:06] down through the ages he's kept his
[44:08] voice alive before the people
[44:15] okay so now so so we know by by the word
[44:18] of god that there is two vines
[44:23] and these two vines they don't just go
[44:25] [Music]
[44:26] they go parallel but not just go like
[44:28] this right
[44:33] now they intertwined
[45:01] why is it that they want us to to they
[45:03] want to stop the voice
[45:07] but for many
[45:08] the voice can be silenced
[45:12] but since they can't silence the voice
[45:16] your voice
[45:18] they'll do the best sin will do the best
[45:20] he can
[45:23] to be able to hybrid
[45:29] brother branham
[45:30] the wonder domino at the same time
[45:32] brother branham was baptizing in the
[45:34] ohio river
[45:38] where the angel the lord met him
[45:42] at that same time
[45:44] hitler
[45:45] hitler was was reigning
[45:48] hitler estaba
[45:51] now that's in 1933
[45:55] hitler was before that but the the point
[45:57] i'm trying to get to is this uh
[46:09] and the propaganda that he was using
[46:26] and information information so and not
[46:30] only did he use those but he also used
[46:32] the radio and the film
[46:38] technology
[46:39] okay but brother ronnie that was in 1933
[46:44] okay wait a minute
[46:45] now now don't we see these big giant
[46:48] companies
[46:52] like disney for example
[46:54] disney and how they're pushing their
[46:55] certain agendas pushing certain uh
[46:58] things to to our children
[47:07] they're pushing agendas and and they're
[47:10] infecting the the mind of the kids
[47:15] what they're trying to do they're trying
[47:16] to confuse the kids
[47:20] at four years old oh it's okay if you
[47:22] wanna if the little boy wants to be a
[47:23] girl it's okay
[47:29] if the little if the little girl wants
[47:31] to be a boy it's fine if the man wants
[47:33] to be a woman
[47:42] all they're doing is creating a modern
[47:44] day tower of babel
[47:48] it's a bunch of confusion
[47:52] now now that's why we as as parents we
[47:54] need to do the best we can to watch our
[47:56] children and and and uh and make sure
[47:59] they're watching the correct things or
[48:01] not watching that stuff
[48:10] topics for party propaganda included
[48:14] this was hitler now what hitler would
[48:16] use
[48:17] he would use anti-semitism
[48:22] anti-semitism is is was towards the jews
[48:24] but in a nutshell it's racism
[48:29] now it was attacks on christian churches
[48:34] and after the start of the second world
[48:35] war what they were doing was attempting
[48:38] to shape the morale of the people
[48:40] [Music]
[48:44] tell me that's not exactly what's going
[48:46] on today as they're trying to shape the
[48:48] morale of the small generation the of of
[48:51] everyone
[48:52] they're trying to shape these our kids
[49:00] not only our kids but with adults also
[49:04] you know and um
[49:08] so so one of the things that that that
[49:10] hitler would use well let's go says give
[49:12] sabah hitler so he had what uh a
[49:15] minister of truth is what they called
[49:16] him
[49:19] and this minister they had a ministry
[49:21] and a minister of truth
[49:25] so so with this minister of truth what
[49:27] tell hitler luckily
[49:34] he told hitler i've often wondered
[49:37] how is it that all these soldiers would
[49:40] willingly do kill all these people
[49:43] [Music]
[49:47] has anybody ever wondered that like man
[49:48] like they're killing innocent people
[49:54] so this man by the name of joseph gobels
[49:58] joseph
[50:00] he was hitler's minister of truth
[50:06] the hitler so he what
[50:08] this man would do is is
[50:09] watch this brother
[50:11] he told hitler
[50:13] change your tactics because he ha hitler
[50:18] be more expressive
[50:22] use facial expressions
[50:28] use your hands to be able to sway and to
[50:31] win the people over
[50:32] us
[50:35] and as i as i read that
[50:37] on the way to work
[50:40] the holy spirit comes and he says
[50:43] no wonder brother tommy would always say
[50:49] when a minister preaches
[50:52] i watch everything
[50:55] the twinkling of his nose
[50:58] the twinkling of his mouth
[51:01] his facial expressions his movements
[51:06] i watch
[51:09] because we have to watch where this
[51:10] anointing is coming from
[51:14] so this so this and it is also said that
[51:17] the hitler at the end of his speeches
[51:20] is
[51:28] also furthering persuading the people to
[51:30] believe that it was under a religious
[51:33] right that they were doing
[51:58] knowing that this was going to arise
[52:03] how this was going to be a perversion of
[52:06] the word amen
[52:08] amen he was going to he was going to
[52:10] produce the amen
[52:15] that was that's pretty for me that was
[52:17] mind-blowing
[52:20] and just just to finish up here because
[52:21] we got some good stuff coming up
[52:26] final couple points here
[52:28] now now
[52:31] remember this is the voice okay
[52:35] now notice okay if everybody can put
[52:37] their attention on me please
[52:40] if i stay here and i say
[52:44] the lord is great
[52:47] will that does that have an effect
[52:52] but if i'm here
[52:54] and if i say oh the lord is great
[53:12] is
[53:14] oh so not only am i speaking out with my
[53:16] mouth
[53:18] but the hands also speak
[53:21] not only do the hands speak
[53:24] but the body also speaks
[53:39] how do we overcome the evil one brother
[53:41] jerry
[53:42] manager
[53:45] it says they overcame him by the blood
[53:47] of the lamb
[53:52] and by the word
[53:55] of their testimony
[53:58] hey man it's it's like a rocket right
[54:03] a rocket goes up
[54:05] one right
[54:06] one rocket goes up
[54:08] it
[54:19] those five go out i'm sorry
[54:22] silent and then those five explode and
[54:24] produce five more cinco produces
[54:27] and then those go out and they and they
[54:29] produce five more yes
[54:36] that's why
[54:45] gentlemen if you would play that audio
[54:47] this is from the message loose ends
[55:32] [Music]
[55:43] i'm gonna come up
[55:52] brother ronnie
[55:54] and people of our precious congregation
[56:00] congregation do you know where the
[56:02] united states is found in prophecy
[56:04] brother ronni
[56:09] it's religion it's found in the
[56:11] in the 13th chapter and the 11th verse
[56:13] of the book of revelations
[56:21] now we talked about
[56:22] the beast last week just a little bit
[56:26] let it send it out of the bottomless pit
[56:31] and we just heard that our
[56:33] pilgrim forefathers they fled the
[56:36] persecution which almost responded to
[56:38] the roman church
[56:42] romana on the roman martiology this is
[56:45] catholic records this is
[56:48] those records
[56:49] catholics during a 300 year period of
[56:52] time
[56:54] in the church ages
[56:56] on their
[56:58] [Music]
[57:11] that killed catholics
[57:13] there were protestants that also killed
[57:15] catholics
[57:18] that doesn't count
[57:19] the rest right
[57:22] and people think that that can't happen
[57:24] again that
[57:32] and the government gains control of
[57:35] religious freedoms or the all these ones
[57:37] we're hearing
[57:38] about control
[57:42] then he can begin to shut down our
[57:45] churches
[57:48] we've talked about that many times
[57:51] and if you read this whole chapter of
[57:53] the book of revelation it talks about
[57:56] both beasts
[58:01] it talks about the first one
[58:03] that sits on seven hills
[58:20] now this other beast starting with verse
[58:23] 11.
[58:26] before i read the verse now remember
[58:28] this this first beast
[58:32] came out from the ocean or from the seas
[58:43] can anybody tell me
[58:47] thicknesses and multitudes
[59:00] and i beheld another beast coming up out
[59:03] of the earth
[59:04] and he had two horns like a lamb
[59:07] and he spake as a dragon
[59:15] now notice this beast came up out of the
[59:18] earth
[59:21] that means where there was nothing
[59:23] significant
[59:25] of course we do realize that when our
[59:26] pilgrim forefathers landed here the only
[59:28] true americans were the indians right
[59:35] but it was
[59:36] deemed the unknown world where they
[59:39] landed
[59:42] it was up out of the earth
[59:56] amen
[59:58] ecclesiastical
[1:00:01] ecclesiastical or religious religioso
[1:00:04] and political power
[1:00:06] politico
[1:00:08] and those two powers unite
[1:00:11] and now instead of
[1:00:13] being like a lamb
[1:00:16] this beast that looked like it was a
[1:00:18] lamb
[1:00:20] like a dragon
[1:00:23] and who is literally the dragon is
[1:00:25] literally
[1:00:26] the
[1:00:28] but the red dragon
[1:00:32] or the dragon of revelation chapter 12.
[1:00:36] that spurt water out of its mouth
[1:00:40] you come against the remnant of the
[1:00:41] woman
[1:00:43] we know that there's rome
[1:00:45] wrong
[1:00:47] things have not changed
[1:00:49] and this is where the united st
[1:01:07] a photo that we have
[1:01:12] and he exercises all the power of the
[1:01:15] first beast before him
[1:01:21] and causes the earth and them which
[1:01:23] dwell therein to worship the first beast
[1:01:26] whose deadly wound was healed
[1:01:34] amen that first beast that was healed of
[1:01:36] its deadly room was what
[1:01:41] the old ancient empire of rome
[1:01:44] romano it looked like it was totally
[1:01:47] annihilated
[1:01:49] but how was the that wound
[1:01:52] it changed from the roman empire cambio
[1:01:55] del imperio romano to pablo rome
[1:01:59] right
[1:02:00] that's how
[1:02:01] it its wound was healed
[1:02:09] so that he maketh fire come down from
[1:02:12] heaven on earth in the sight of men
[1:02:19] it damien go like 10 different ways
[1:02:21] without but we're just we're just going
[1:02:22] to be going through the basics here you
[1:02:24] all go home and dig in dig into the
[1:02:26] message
[1:02:29] because we could be here all
[1:02:32] night the pastor would probably wouldn't
[1:02:35] put me for a long time
[1:02:38] which he would be totally right into it
[1:02:40] amen okay verse 14
[1:02:44] and deceiveth them that dwell upon the
[1:02:46] earth by the means of those miracles
[1:02:48] which he had power to do in the sight of
[1:02:50] the beast
[1:02:59] so this first beast is watching
[1:03:01] everything that's going on
[1:03:06] behind the scenes
[1:03:08] wrong roma
[1:03:10] is manipulating everything
[1:03:15] you think that they don't know what's
[1:03:16] going on
[1:03:19] i better stop there there i could really
[1:03:21] i could really go somewhere with that
[1:03:23] but now watch this verse 15 verso
[1:03:26] and verse 16.
[1:03:29] and he had power to give life unto the
[1:03:32] image of the beast
[1:03:34] that the image of beast should both
[1:03:36] speak
[1:03:38] and cause that as many as would not
[1:03:40] worship the image of the beast should
[1:03:56] here in the united
[1:03:58] states of america
[1:04:01] america it's hard to even use that word
[1:04:03] united states because it's not united
[1:04:09] in saying all this we appreciate this
[1:04:14] the freedoms we have
[1:04:17] brother ben says in one place it's still
[1:04:18] the greatest nation with all of its
[1:04:20] problems is still the greatest nation in
[1:04:22] the world
[1:04:36] the media of the freedom to have
[1:04:37] business all these
[1:04:46] but he had power to give image
[1:04:48] to the image of the beast to make it
[1:04:50] speak and cause all that would not
[1:04:52] worship that image of the beast should
[1:04:54] be killed
[1:05:00] and he causes all both smalling great
[1:05:03] rich and poor
[1:05:05] reinbound to receive a mark on their
[1:05:07] right hand
[1:05:08] and on their foreheads
[1:05:17] that no man might buy or sell say be
[1:05:19] held the mark or the name of the beast
[1:05:22] or the number of his names
[1:05:30] and all the churches teach they're going
[1:05:32] to stamp you on the head and they're
[1:05:34] going to stamp you on your
[1:05:48] what you're going to do with it
[1:05:50] he also pieced a message
[1:05:52] jesus on your hands
[1:05:55] what are you going to do with him
[1:05:58] your forehead is your revelation
[1:06:01] what are you going to do the mark it's a
[1:06:04] spiritual mark la marquez
[1:06:06] it's not going to be a computer chip
[1:06:10] they're not going to put a number on you
[1:06:16] depends on what you receive as a
[1:06:18] revelation depend
[1:06:21] and then what you do with that
[1:06:24] revelation
[1:06:26] so
[1:06:26] with that said could you guys put the
[1:06:28] picture up there
[1:06:34] of the the dollar bill
[1:06:40] okay
[1:06:41] now i would like to go to the message
[1:06:43] here
[1:06:44] here
[1:06:52] paragraphs 311 and 212 if you'd like to
[1:06:55] mark it down for your
[1:06:58] personality you see where the pope come
[1:07:01] over here the other day
[1:07:05] did you notice all them 13s that
[1:07:08] happened then
[1:07:13] he spoke 13 words
[1:07:16] had 13 taking communion
[1:07:20] spoken yankee stadium
[1:07:25] everything was 13.
[1:07:29] next paragraph
[1:07:31] and our nation's number is 13.
[1:07:36] appears in the 13th chapter of
[1:07:39] revelations
[1:07:45] let's go ahead and put the picture up
[1:07:47] don't worry about the scripture i want
[1:07:48] the picture to be up
[1:07:50] 13 stripes
[1:07:52] inside of the picture where the eagles
[1:07:54] at
[1:07:56] right below the head
[1:07:58] it shows those thirteen stripes
[1:08:03] thirteen stars
[1:08:06] now that like globe above the head of
[1:08:08] the eagle it's the
[1:08:21] 13 bars thirteen numbers on the coins
[1:08:26] there's numeros
[1:08:28] thirteen stars on the coin
[1:08:31] everything is thirteen and a woman that
[1:08:35] i say you know
[1:08:36] in another place he says why the statue
[1:08:38] of liberty is a woman
[1:08:42] woman's
[1:08:43] nation
[1:08:46] 13 13 everything
[1:08:49] and appears in the 13th chapter of the
[1:08:51] book of revelation
[1:08:54] of the apocalypse and he says what's
[1:08:55] going to give life to this image
[1:09:00] plain speech to finish now
[1:09:04] the first beast was wrong
[1:09:09] he says that the image
[1:09:17] what he says they say
[1:09:32] and the whole goal is and you can see it
[1:09:34] now
[1:09:36] is to fight or stamp out communism
[1:09:41] he says don't worry about communism
[1:09:44] it's a pull on the hand of god
[1:09:58] everybody understand intending
[1:10:03] praise the lord
[1:10:04] go home and study it
[1:10:06] yes
[1:10:09] yes
[1:10:10] brother
[1:10:11] jerry
[1:10:14] talked about
[1:10:23] did you open that up or explain it a
[1:10:25] little bit more
[1:10:26] explicit
[1:10:28] in the relation to the first catholic
[1:10:30] president
[1:10:32] the second catholic president
[1:10:35] both prophesied that would come by our
[1:10:37] people
[1:10:41] this evening
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:56] remember what we talked about
[1:10:59] what was the moon
[1:11:02] woman the church right okay so so in the
[1:11:05] context here so what we're doing
[1:11:09] so we talked under the first catholic
[1:11:11] administration which was john f kennedy
[1:11:16] kennedy so he initiated the the mission
[1:11:19] to the moon right
[1:11:21] they made it in 1969 in the mission
[1:11:23] called apollo
[1:11:30] we found that in the manuscripts it says
[1:11:31] apollo and napoleon were the same person
[1:11:36] so apollo or apollyon was the sun god
[1:11:44] so we see that there was a race to the
[1:11:45] moon right
[1:11:48] and the whole race like brother like
[1:11:49] brother ronnie said
[1:11:51] the whole thing of the
[1:11:52] race was to get there first
[1:11:56] the first one that would get there the
[1:11:57] primero
[1:11:59] would be the first one to plant the
[1:12:00] cedar evaplant
[1:12:02] and that way these all these things can
[1:12:04] come to manifestation
[1:12:07] but we saw that now that there's a
[1:12:09] second administration
[1:12:11] administration or catholic
[1:12:12] administration
[1:12:14] and with on the biden harris or biden
[1:12:16] administration
[1:12:19] and we and we saw that they're planning
[1:12:20] another mission
[1:12:23] and who remembers the name of that
[1:12:24] mission
[1:12:27] really
[1:12:29] the artemis mission right
[1:12:31] the artemis is three missions
[1:12:33] so so we see that in 2025 they want to
[1:12:36] go back to the movies
[1:12:40] but notice that now they're going in in
[1:12:42] artemis which was apollos
[1:12:45] a sibling
[1:12:47] a artemis era
[1:12:50] but we see that artemis if you break
[1:12:52] down the name
[1:12:55] she was the goddess of the moon
[1:12:58] so you start to see all this influence
[1:12:59] in this in religion
[1:13:03] what does catholicism have
[1:13:04] catholicism or the queen of heaven
[1:13:07] but she was the goddess of the moon
[1:13:10] and in one stage
[1:13:13] and and like brother jimmy he actually
[1:13:15] read some of the scriptures so i don't
[1:13:16] have to read it
[1:13:20] in revelations 13.
[1:13:23] she was the goddess of the moon
[1:13:26] but she's also known as the hunter
[1:13:29] so we see how it started it looked like
[1:13:31] a lamb
[1:13:33] but it'll be a dragon or a hunter later
[1:13:36] um
[1:13:39] go into that a little bit more
[1:13:44] could you tie in that delphi tripod what
[1:13:47] is it what does that mean
[1:13:51] sure the so the
[1:13:53] delphi tripod the triple delphi was
[1:13:55] something that was sacred to apollo
[1:13:57] herald
[1:14:01] like i said i wanted the tube because
[1:14:03] apollo has a lot of symbols
[1:14:07] and and so apollo he thought that that
[1:14:09] fight tripod he holds it sacred
[1:14:12] triple
[1:14:15] and and so what he did is he stood
[1:14:17] i'll just read it here the stool at
[1:14:19] delphi
[1:14:22] in which pythia was another goddess
[1:14:27] she sat to produce her oracles from
[1:14:29] there
[1:14:32] was sacred to apollo
[1:14:34] apollo
[1:14:35] was the name of the priestess actually
[1:14:39] of the temple of apollo at delphi del
[1:14:42] temple
[1:14:43] but you notice when where she said
[1:14:47] what does the word try mean question
[1:14:49] try is the trinity
[1:14:51] so you start to see all this just fall
[1:14:53] together by itself
[1:14:56] solo brother jimmy you can't make this
[1:14:57] up
[1:14:59] i mean it falls it fell
[1:15:01] together
[1:15:03] it went together by itself
[1:15:06] solo
[1:15:10] okay
[1:15:11] so so we saw okay so we talked about
[1:15:12] apollo like i said just a tiny little
[1:15:14] bit of a recap
[1:15:18] and we'll talk about apollo remember
[1:15:22] okay so but another another detail that
[1:15:24] i wanted to bring out about him
[1:15:27] remember he wrote the quadriga
[1:15:31] which was a chariot with four horses
[1:15:36] one rider for horses
[1:15:47] it was often depicted as a triumphant
[1:15:49] woman driving it
[1:16:05] it's it's in between so we try to try to
[1:16:06] break it down as much as possible
[1:16:12] but that's why especially at this time
[1:16:16] it requires much digging into the
[1:16:17] message
[1:16:20] because there's a lot of things that are
[1:16:21] in between the lines
[1:16:24] and if you just read it like a book
[1:16:28] so it's important to know the symbols
[1:16:30] it's important
[1:16:32] it's important to know history
[1:16:34] historia the scriptures
[1:16:36] and the message
[1:16:37] so it's very very important so that's
[1:16:39] why young people
[1:16:41] again
[1:16:43] it's like bro you would always say
[1:17:00] when it's a
[1:17:19] and and this is how he came through
[1:17:22] how he came through uh to the jews
[1:17:26] right because the scripture revelations
[1:17:28] 9 11 11.
[1:17:32] apollyon you can put it up there so they
[1:17:33] can read it
[1:17:35] and the other word is abaddon
[1:17:39] in the hebrew tongue
[1:18:13] it's the same one
[1:18:15] i know by definition jose for definition
[1:18:18] one is called the destroyer
[1:18:21] and one is the place of destruction
[1:18:24] in all reality
[1:19:07] keep in mind that this roman spirit
[1:19:09] guardian
[1:19:11] civil and ecclesiastical okay
[1:19:15] but that roman demon
[1:19:17] romano whether through apollyon or
[1:19:19] through abaddon
[1:20:02] hitler try to do
[1:20:06] he tried to exterminate the exterminator
[1:20:08] see that spirit okay
[1:20:10] abaddon and napoleon were the same
[1:20:12] self-destroyers
[1:20:15] remember to the to the gentiles
[1:20:18] we see the one rider and the four horses
[1:20:22] or what they call the four horsemen
[1:20:26] but we know it was the same writer
[1:20:29] knowing that at the end it was just all
[1:20:31] of them mixed together
[1:20:34] the white the red and the black
[1:20:37] negro they were mixed together and they
[1:20:39] brought death
[1:20:41] but we see it through on the on the side
[1:20:43] of the
[1:20:44] june see that in joel he speaks about
[1:20:47] four about the yen sections different
[1:20:49] stages
[1:20:52] in different senses
[1:20:53] here and insects over here
[1:20:57] so i started to think
[1:21:05] and remember it's the same one okay
[1:21:08] i just i just flipped them i should have
[1:21:09] i should have done abaddon first and
[1:21:11] napoleon
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:25] remember that this destroyer coming all
[1:21:27] the way through
[1:21:29] but don't forget the truth and the word
[1:21:31] also comes through they're coming side
[1:21:32] by side
[1:21:36] the word through his people
[1:21:40] he would come out through his people
[1:21:41] okay
[1:21:43] but destruction so the first time the
[1:21:44] death angel in exodus
[1:21:48] the destroyer
[1:21:50] the destruction of solomon's temple
[1:21:51] number two
[1:21:59] you can imagine going through the bible
[1:22:00] and seeing so many things
[1:22:04] but i see him in the destruction of
[1:22:05] solomon's temperament
[1:22:08] in 586
[1:22:24] i see him moving into the destruction of
[1:22:25] the temple in 7018
[1:22:31] when titus sees jerusalem
[1:22:36] a time
[1:23:03] killing all those people during the dark
[1:23:04] ages
[1:23:07] right the 68 million jew uh
[1:23:09] christians that brother jimmy was
[1:23:11] talking about
[1:23:13] jimmy i see him in the holocaust during
[1:23:16] hitler's time
[1:23:19] right he tried to exterminate the jews
[1:23:23] 1941-1945
[1:23:26] but then i also see a
[1:23:28] something coming
[1:23:30] in and that's why i said about artemis
[1:23:46] because there's another destruction
[1:23:47] coming okay
[1:23:49] there's another ruin
[1:23:51] there's another extermination
[1:23:53] extermination remember abaddon to the
[1:23:55] jews
[1:23:57] in a literal standpoint
[1:24:00] and to
[1:24:15] destruction destruction so much ruin
[1:24:17] santa rina brother branham watch brother
[1:24:20] branham
[1:24:21] and and he says here in the feast of the
[1:24:22] trumpets if you want to know where he is
[1:24:25] jews in a literal standpoint los judios
[1:24:32] and here comes the persecution to the
[1:24:34] church
[1:24:36] an ecclesiastical standpoint
[1:24:41] my goodness
[1:24:46] everything
[1:24:47] todo
[1:24:48] it's all mixed it's misclado you look at
[1:24:51] everything in history
[1:24:53] and religion
[1:24:55] that was a point of them getting to the
[1:24:57] moon
[1:24:59] remember look at it in this context okay
[1:25:02] i know i know i'm not talking about the
[1:25:04] it's it's the it's the type
[1:25:07] of
[1:25:07] that was the purpose of getting there
[1:25:10] because there was
[1:25:13] what does the offspring mean significa
[1:25:16] an offspring has characteristics of the
[1:25:18] father characteristics
[1:25:20] it's got the fingerprints for caleb
[1:25:23] all over where it's political
[1:25:25] or it's religious
[1:25:27] it's got its fingerprints on everything
[1:25:30] it's in her lace so close yes
[1:25:33] it's intertwined
[1:25:38] she's got her influence on everything
[1:25:40] influencing
[1:25:42] amen no man are you following me missing
[1:25:45] i don't want to i don't want to go too
[1:25:46] far too fast and try to slow myself down
[1:25:49] okay good good
[1:25:50] good um
[1:25:51] okay
[1:25:52] so brother branham here says this is the
[1:25:55] monobrandon catholic church is the beast
[1:25:59] the bible said that a beast
[1:26:02] means a power significant is that right
[1:26:19] and now that was the power of the church
[1:26:21] yes
[1:26:22] that was the beast
[1:26:25] then the protestant church come in
[1:26:28] come out of the catholic church
[1:26:30] and what did she do right after that
[1:26:33] organize themselves
[1:26:38] that is the image
[1:26:40] then the protestant church come out of
[1:26:42] the i read that if anything because
[1:26:44] cialgo if something cialgo watch if
[1:26:47] anything if something algo
[1:26:50] was made in my image foreign
[1:26:56] is something made in the image of this
[1:26:58] church
[1:27:00] you look like this church
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:30] ism
[1:27:32] all them isms
[1:27:35] formed up into an organization
[1:27:38] and made an image
[1:27:41] just like the beast
[1:27:43] brother says there it this is
[1:27:46] so we talked a little bit about
[1:27:49] anything that's set up like that
[1:27:53] anything that resembles that beast
[1:27:57] it doesn't matter what church it is it
[1:28:00] doesn't even matter if it's in the
[1:28:01] message
[1:28:03] the message cannot be denominated
[1:28:06] but many people try to put little isms
[1:28:12] just finished saying hey
[1:28:26] do we have to realize
[1:28:28] is that it's a system
[1:28:30] it's the system behind it
[1:28:33] there's a certain spirit behind certain
[1:28:35] spirits
[1:28:36] whether whether it's churches
[1:28:39] whether it's politics or political
[1:28:54] is
[1:29:05] this brother tommy junior gave me this
[1:29:06] article
[1:29:15] when he gave me the saturn this was
[1:29:16] perfect what would i want to bring this
[1:29:18] perfecto
[1:29:20] but it was published in february 11 2014
[1:29:22] 2014.
[1:29:27] and it's an article that's called in
[1:29:28] lost history
[1:29:33] and i can give you the link if you want
[1:29:35] it after so you can read it for yourself
[1:29:49] the other ones the um
[1:29:51] the ones about rome and washington
[1:29:54] the buildings
[1:29:57] just cycle them that's that's okay
[1:29:59] that's that's called the arch of
[1:30:00] constantine
[1:30:02] constantino but you ever wonder
[1:30:05] you look at the architecture in the
[1:30:07] white house
[1:30:10] you look at you look at the buildings
[1:30:13] and what do they look like
[1:30:15] doesn't it look like they have roman
[1:30:16] influence in them
[1:30:20] in the very architecture that where our
[1:30:22] governing body sits
[1:30:28] let me read this i'll read a little bit
[1:30:29] so you guys can look at the pictures
[1:30:31] okay
[1:30:36] one of the estates which made up the
[1:30:38] original city of washington
[1:30:43] was called rome
[1:30:45] have you heard about rome maryland oh
[1:30:48] escuchado the roma maryland and the the
[1:30:51] author says probably not so read on
[1:30:54] continuous dc has an interesting
[1:30:57] historical connection to the city of
[1:30:58] rome uh
[1:31:03] this this might be one of the more
[1:31:05] fascinating pieces of local trivia we
[1:31:08] have ever come across
[1:31:15] a long time ago
[1:31:17] way before the city in the thought was
[1:31:19] in the thoughts of our forefathers
[1:31:20] founding fathers
[1:31:26] back in the 17th century
[1:31:29] there was a large estate in the area of
[1:31:31] about 400 acres
[1:31:35] acres this farm occupied land estate
[1:31:39] southeast of georgetown and
[1:31:43] georgetown then part of maryland part of
[1:31:46] the maryland the man who owned the land
[1:31:48] was fond of italy
[1:31:53] and decided to name the state rome
[1:31:56] he mentioned
[1:32:01] the small body of water bordering itself
[1:32:06] was originally called goose creek
[1:32:11] but then took a new name lego number
[1:32:14] the tiger creek
[1:32:15] like
[1:32:17] after the tiber in rome
[1:32:22] and i'm just reading verbatim okay
[1:32:23] watch this of course the story would not
[1:32:25] be complete
[1:32:28] without mentioning the landowner's name
[1:32:32] the name just happened to be francis
[1:32:34] pope el hombre del don
[1:32:36] francis pope according to an article i
[1:32:39] came across the washington post
[1:32:46] from october 7th 1883
[1:32:53] the land was laid out
[1:32:56] and acquired by pope
[1:32:59] on june 5th 5th 1663
[1:33:05] and you saw you saw the buildings are
[1:33:07] right
[1:33:09] coincidence coincidence brother brown
[1:33:11] says nothing happens
[1:33:15] we're just seeing how interlaced
[1:33:18] how that destroyer has snuck all his way
[1:33:20] in here
[1:34:03] our new birth is going to happen
[1:34:06] computers the chips the shortages
[1:34:08] everywhere
[1:34:11] setting it up perfectly
[1:34:14] that destroyer
[1:34:15] destructor to come in
[1:34:17] so there was wrong before there was
[1:34:19] washington
[1:34:21] you see the dna in roman in washington
[1:34:26] figuratively literally literally
[1:34:28] revelations 13 1 brother jimmy read it i
[1:34:30] won't read it apocalypse is now we begin
[1:34:33] to see that scripture right
[1:34:36] he looked like a lamb but
[1:34:38] they looked like a dragon
[1:34:39] you see the platform set
[1:34:42] up
[1:34:43] so everything is doom and gloom huh
[1:34:57] but the word of god also came here
[1:35:10] that just before the pope took his
[1:35:12] journey to jerusalem
[1:35:20] just before he took his journey
[1:35:23] tomorrow
[1:35:24] and he's coming here in vienna
[1:35:26] brother jimmy said
[1:35:39] it's ready for a climax
[1:35:42] what's this
[1:35:44] imagine brother branham said i don't
[1:35:45] recall the message
[1:35:48] but all it takes is a little bit of
[1:35:49] vodka somebody does
[1:35:52] go and push the button
[1:36:07] and he's dealing with who is he dealing
[1:36:09] with he's dealing with biden right
[1:36:13] we see them at it
[1:36:15] it's kind of like a proxy war that
[1:36:17] they're fighting right now
[1:36:19] they're fighting wars to some through
[1:36:21] other countries
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:35] is it a coincidence that the very name
[1:36:37] biden is
[1:36:39] literally means button
[1:36:42] significa
[1:36:43] i thought that was awesome
[1:36:45] my goodness
[1:36:47] brother brown says nothing happens
[1:36:51] so watch this here but there's hope for
[1:36:53] the believer
[1:36:54] especially
[1:36:55] the gentile churches and the ladies
[1:37:02] if the jews are in their homeland
[1:37:18] today
[1:37:20] we have atomic bombs hanging in the
[1:37:21] hangars
[1:37:24] we have a church that's lukewarm
[1:37:25] iglesias
[1:37:26] we have a church an iglesia but also a
[1:37:29] people that draw their self together
[1:37:36] that patterns the ministry of jesus
[1:37:38] christ
[1:37:41] for to catch the stone but when it comes
[1:37:46] what's left to happen
[1:37:49] it might be
[1:37:50] i'm sorry brother it might be any minute
[1:37:53] there's nothing else left
[1:37:55] we're at the end times

[1:39:03] purpose

[1:40:23] the church goes on
[1:40:26] the church goes to persecution
