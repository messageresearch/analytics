Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [Music] Very good morning. The Lord Jesus Christ bless you. Before we sit down, I would like to read a scripture in the book of St. John verse uh chapter 11 verse 25. It's a very familiar scripture to many. These are the words of our Lord and Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ. And Jesus said unto her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, he shall live. You may be seated. I would like to thank all to thank all the friends, our family members, that are accompanying our sister Virginia this morning. I would like to say that when one of our loved ones passes on, he he leaves a legacy behind and that will stay in our hearts and it will stay with us always as as a husband, a friend, a companion, his memories ies are going to be converted into the treasure so tremendous for some of us. This is not a goodbye. This is until we meet again. We will see each other very soon. Our brother Alio He is resting on a promise and this promise is not made of menit not it's it's not political it's a promise of our Lord Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior when he said he that believeth in Though he be dead, yet shall he live. Oh, what a promise. I believe with all of my heart before our friend Alio would leave this world, he had the privilege and the opportunity to be able to make his life right before God to be able to prepare himself to encounter himself with God just like that that malfactor on the cross there next to Jesus in that instant that's the only opportunity he had he had an opportunity to hear about God and that's when he said Lord remember me remember me when you come into your kingdom we all heard those words because Jesus said, "He that cometh to me, I will no wise cast out." And and I'm also convinced our brother Alio. He took those words and he accepted the sacrifice and he received the Lord Jesus Christ. as his Lord and Savior. And today, he's not here. He's with our father enjoying the peace of God. Sister Virginia, as the Lord teaches us in his word, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall be saved and all of your house and you have embraced that promise. That promise gives you hope. This is not a goodbye. only till real soon we'll see you again because we will see him again. How long? It'd be like in a twinkling of an eye a lady like you, Sister Virginia, that has chosen You have chosen to put God first in all of your life and you have decided to embrace the faith as a shield to fight in every war that we would have spiritually speaking. This world has brought you these trials. and faith has been your victory that has helped you to overcome in each one of these trials. For for that reason, Sister Virginia, I can say the faith is accompanied by works of righteousness. We say that we believe in God. and we have faith. But I would like to share something else with you. The Bible teaches us. The Bible says that demons also believe in God. They were at one time over there with him before they were cast out of heaven. But the true ingenuine faith come accompanied with works of righteousness. Sister Virginia, your testimony, you speak so much louder than any word you could say. You are a pillar in our church and your Christian life is an example to all of us but not just us here for your neighbors for your family. You are an example and you her friends that accompany us and and the family members that accompany us. I would like to share with you tell you that our brother Alio, he's not here. This is just like a tabernacle. It's like the shell that's left. Because a true alo he is resting and enjoying the presence of God. If we would to ask him right now, would you like to come back? I would think obviously he would say no to come back into that body again. I don't think that would be right or just for him. That's why my friends this body was taken out of the dust of the earth and into dust it will return that the word of God might be fulfilled. The Bible also says if you hear his voice today No heart in your heart. When God created man, he gave him something so valuable. When he created you and me loved us so much and he gave us something of such great valor, it's free choice, free moral agent. the opportunity that you have to choose. And when God gave us this free will, he loved us so much. Then he counseledled us and gave us counsel. He recommended to us that we would choose life that we might live. Now I ask if we would hear his voice today, harden not your heart. Every time we hear God and we hear his voice and we refuse to obey, our heart gets harder. And when we come to these funerals, God is speaking to us. Now, one of these days, you and me, today it's our brother Alio. He's gone before us. But tomorrow, we don't know. Maybe you or me and the more elder person, the youngest person, death respects no one. That's why if you would hear his voice today, harden not your heart. Are you ready to go with him? Our brother Alio was ready. Before we finish this moment, I would just like to ask you a simple question. If you have not received the the Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, I think today would be an opportunity and then we could pray for you. I I want you there just right where you're at, friend, family member. This is not brother Diego speaking. It's God speaking to you through a vessel. What would it be you if it was you tomorrow in this same place? Let's not harden our hearts. I ask someone here that would like to receive our Lord as savior if death would surprise us as we walk out the doors that we could say like our brother Alio, he just simply went home. If you would like for us to pray for you, you could raise your hand. Would you raise your hand? If you would like to receive the Lord Jesus, we would pray for you. It will be an honor. I'm just going to wait a few moments. Would you raise your hand? Our brother Alio, it's been an honor that God lent you to us to be able to share with him so many memories that now are going to be converted into the greatest treasure that we have. If we could finish this service We could say these words, our brother Alio, he's left and gone. He's now at home. But us that remain. And those of us that love him and we appreciate his life and we really respect his memory. Now, we're going to honor his. We're going to respect her and we're gonna embrace her and participate of that respect that we will show her. This is the opportunity to continue showing that respect and respecting the will and respecting her family. This is an opportunity that the family would make things right. and they could come together and be so much stronger together. Let us have a word of prayer. Father, we thank you for this opportunity to be able to express these words to know Lord that one more has made it home. blessed the the widow, her his wife, comforted her heart, her son, even every one of the family, her friends and family that are here and then us that we knew him. Lord, we ask you to take control in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's continue now. God bless you. Amen. I'm going to ask if you'll please stand. [Music] for [Music] me. [Music] [Music] Alma [Music] Yolas [Music] yol. [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. Amen. You may be seated. At this time, we're going to ask our sister Loren Perez to please come up and and sing her special. [Music] Oh, you know I need a brand to touch my strength from yesterday is gone. But if you give me Lord another touch, I'll have the strength to carry on. I thought the sun had come to stay. But all too soon it went away. And in his place the storm's cloud came. And with the clouds there came the rain. It rained so hard and all so long. I miss the storm. I felt a calm. It was your touch that brought me through it all. Without your help, I surely fall. Yesterday has come and gone. And now a new day's come along. I do not know what it may bring. My heart may cry instead of sing. But it matters not what comes my way, Lord. Lord, if you just touch me new each day, your loving touch rise all my tears away. Close by your side. I want to stay. Lord, you know how weak I really am. even better than myself. But with your help, I know I really can make it through the darkness night. Everything's going to be all right. Lord, you know I need a brand new touch. My strength from yesterday is gone. But if you give me, Lord, another touch, I'll have the strength to carry on. [Applause] Amen. God bless our sister Lorenna for that beautiful special. We thank her for that. Amen. At this time of the uh this part of the service, we're going to we're going to open up the the service for any family members that would like to come up and and say some words about about our brother here. If anybody would like to come up, um, we're going to try to limit it, uh, to two to three minutes and, uh, we have a a space here designated for for you all to come and come up and say some words. So, whoever would like to come up, we open it up. Thank you. Hello. Would you like to interpret or is it necessary? No, it's not necessary. Thank you. My name is Leo Hakis. I know most of you here. Um, I thank you for being here to pay your last respects to my father and in support of my family and we are very thankful for that. Um, I like to say I'd like to share a few words to honor my dad. My dad had humble beginning. He was born in 1938 on a farm in Chamarino, New Mexico. He had 12 other siblings. Um, his dad grew cotton, alpha alalfa, corn, and that small farm had he always kept one or two pigs in a pig pen, a chicken coupe, and before the tractor, I'm told there was a team of horses as well. So, there was always work to be done on that farm. And boy, did we hear stories about that. Uh, we heard how we heard how it was uncommon for them to have to work from sun up to sun down during the harvest except for when school was in session. And my dad loved school. Not only did it get him off the farm, but he was good at school. For fun. At times he would have his his cousin from Anthony, New Mexico, uh, Ruben Huckkins. He would go and spend the night on the farm. And my dad tell me that they used to climb up into the cotton trailer full of cotton and lay there and tell each other's stories, gazing into the sky, looking at all those stars and uh, catching up on the the goings on in their life. Um, and my dad said at times that's exactly where they slept, right there on in the cotton trailer on top of all that cotton. Um, bear with me. My dad, as I said, he excelled in school. an aunt of mine, my aunt Estelle, she used to tell me, she'd say, "Leo, your dad's a very smart man." Um, he used to go when he went to school, he would finish up his math homework, all the whole book. He'd read through it and finish up all the work. He'd finish it early and then he'd go around and tutor the other students that needed help in their math. My dad excelled. He graduated amongst the top 10 of his graduation class at Gadston High School in 1956. By 1959, he met my mom, fell in love, married her, and joined the Air Force. He continued his his education at Colorado State University through a program sponsored by the Air Force Institute of Technology. He told me to be in that program you had to maintain a 3.0. So he studied diligently and he earned a bachelor of science in mathematics. Upon completion of that, he went on and completed officer training school and after that he was sent to Vietnam during the Vietnam war. That was 1968 to 1969. I was 6 years old in ' 68. Uh but I remember a lot of nights during that year I would turn on the news to Walter Kankite for the evening news to get an update and all the time wondering if my dad's okay and when he's coming home. I also remember how my parents communicated with with each other that year. Of course, there was a lot of letter writing and um they also communicated by realtore tape. I can I can see my mom when she'd get that that tape in the mail and she'd go put it in her recorder and turn the machine on and there would be my dad's voice talking to me, talking to us. And I thought that was really cool. Yeah. Uh, I remember the day he returned from Vietnam. Many of you might remember that was an unpopular war. Not everybody returned. Not every soldier returned to a nice welcome. But my dad's family and my mom's family did him well. He did us proud. It was a big group of us in the El Paso airport. We're there at the gate waiting for him. I can I I remember all the excitement um with with my mom. She was really excited. Another individual stood out that I can remember in my mind. It was my uncle Danny. He was very excited as well. Uncle Danny is my peasant, my cousin Penny's father. She I saw her earlier. She's here with us today. Um but when he walked through into that gate, uh an uproar of cheer and banners rolled out. Welcome home, Emlio. Confetti thrown into the air. It was quite a celebration. I was really happy that my dad was able to experience a welcome home like that. Coming back from that war after Vietnam and after being honorly honor honorably discharged from the Air Force, he continued his education at uh um Colorado State University again. Um and this time he was going on the GI Bill. That's where he earned his master of science degree in physics. at uh and after he earned that degree, he took a job at the White Sands Missile Range. That was 1973. He was hired as a physicist and operations research systems analyst. And at that time, of course, we we were back here and uh we we pretty much became a typical middle class family. My dad would go home every work I mean he'd go to work every workday. My mom stayed at home, kept up the house, saw to it that us kids got to and from school. And during those summers they would take us on family vacations. They took us to places like Disneyland, Yellowstone National Park, um San Diego Zoo. My youngest siblings, they got to see San Jose in San Francisco, California. My dad retired after working at the Missile Range for 20 years. All the time he loved the outdoors and he loved fishing. He was an avid fisherman. He was the guy that would be fishing in the heat of the summer or the cold of the winter or even in the rain. And he and in his retirement, he thought he could do it every day. He'd be out there at winter in the winter in Reoso with an axe chopping a hole in the frozen river, dropping his line in and catching trout. But even though he had a good time, he found himself with too much time on his hands. So he attended post-graduate studies at New Mexico State University. And that's where he earned his New Mexico teaching teaching license. When that finished and when the interviews came, I remember how excited he was with all the offers that he was getting. But he settled on a teaching job as a math teacher at his alma mater, Gadston High School, where he taught for five years. After that he took on a assistant professor position at the Donana Community College where he taught math. He he was equally excited about that job. He really liked the staff and and really enjoyed the group of students that cycled through the community college. He had to stop teaching when the pain in his lower back was too unbearable for having to stand for long periods of time and then he went into full retirement and that that was about 10 years ago. I'm proud of my dad and his accomplishments. He's taught me much in life. My dad had a full life and he accomplished much. All starting from a farm in Chambarino, New Mexico. And I will miss it. As it was stated earlier, this is not goodbye. Amen. This is until I see him again. God's willing in God's presence. I'd like to conclude thanking my family. 11 months ago when my dad fell down and suffered a traumatic brain injury, my wife Diane, she's been there for me and the family and for that I thank you. Thank you. and my mom. What a faithful servant of God. Amen. Amen. whatever facility he was in these last 11 months, the hospitals or the skilled nursing centers here in Los Cusus or the Veterans Home in Truth or Consequences and then finally the El Paso Eltech. She was there always visiting whenever she could, reading the Bible to him, praying for him, praying with him. At times when I was there with some for some of her visits, a peace would set in and he would just peacefully fall asleep for a little while and it was very beautiful. Thank you, Mom. my sister Ivonne. Oh, the calls, all those calls to the insurance company, the case managers, and the hospital staff trying to keep it all straight and keep it running smooth. It was quite a job for her. And my sister Melissa, she's the registered nurse of the family. She helped us with all the lingo jargon, helped us understand what the doctors were saying and what the nurses were saying. It really was helpful when we had to make those hard decisions together. My two sisters, they had many conversations with hospital staff, doctors. Some of those conversations were good and I'm told some of them were pretty heated. All in advocating for the best care for my father. My brother Robert, he moved into the family home last fall as early as he could. And he's been there helping my mom. My mom's 89 years old. Her knees are weak. She can't lift anything heavy anymore. So he's there to help her inside, outside the house, keep her company, talk with her, watch TV shows with her, accompany her to the grocery store. And for that, I'm very thankful, Robert. With all that they did, it sounds like I did nothing. You did, but I filled in everywhere I could. 11 months ago, we came together as a team, advocating for dad as best we could, taking care of mom. Now, we must remain that team, taking care of ourselves, taking care of each other, taking care of mom. Yes, sir. And also, I almost forgot, my two brothers-in-law, Kenny, married to Ivonne. Chris, Mary to Melissa, anything we needed, you guys were there to volunteer. You guys have been a real help. Thank you. The rest of you, you come here to pay your respects in support of the family. We are profoundly thankful. God bless you all. God bless you, sir. Amen. Amen. And God bless the brother for those precious kind words. Beautiful words. Amen. Amen. Amen. Is anybody else that would like to come up and say some words? Hello everyone. So I'm Ken. Everybody knows me by Kenny when they who knows me. U I didn't prepare anything like Leo did. I just we've been it's been a very busy week or so and it's just didn't have any time plus trying to work and and help uh my wife Ivonne with everything she's going through. You know, she's we had issues with we had a our dog had problems. She's having cataract surgery this week. You know, this is happening to to our dad. But, uh I just I just want to say a few just a few words. So I been in the family, you know, welcomed me into the family 40 years ago when I got married to Ivonne and with welcome arms and uh he uh he this this man demanded or not demanded but he he had respect for everyone but he also presented the presence of of having respect. So the whole time that I was married, it took it was always Mr. Hakis, how are you? How you doing? You know, walking even Thanksgiving and Christmas, Mr. Hakis, how are you? And it was years, you know, after going to Riadoso fishing and uh going to many dinners with the family that I, you know, I finally started like, well, okay, maybe this is the day, you know. And I said, uh, hey, Dad, how's it going? And I was like, "Oo, I said it." Oh, you know, I I was looking for a response and he was like, "Hey," you know, I was like, "Okay, that wasn't so bad, you know, and I was from that point on I was able, you know, I was like, "Hey, Dad." And came became more comfortable for me to do that. and uh and he's always been, you know, very welcoming, very very uh for me and and respected me. And he's he's helped me uh many times when I was going to school, you know, with math because this guy was a math wiz. Uh, I was not the sharpest tool in the the toolbox with math, but in many times he was able to get me through a lot of that, but I I know I want to try to keep this short, but I did want to talk uh with Ivonne has a ride up here. Uh, she had hurt her knee. She recently just fell and hit her knee and she can't come up these stairs. But these are words from from Ivonne. Dad, I miss you more than words can express. I miss our conversations and our moments spent simply enjoying each other's company. I treasure them all. I think about the stories you and mom told me, especially the one about your early days struggling to make ends meet while making sure I never went without. I loved hearing about your life on the farm and your years in the Air Force and the values you instilled in me. I miss taking care of you, helping w with whatever you needed. I miss your voice, your smile, your laughter, the way you could brighten a room just by being yourself. I miss visiting you and sharing time together. More than anything, I just miss you. You are a wonderful father, and I'm forever grateful for everything you gave me. Your love, your unwavering strength. You will always be in my heart and in my thoughts. Being your daughter is the greatest honor of my life. And I will carry your love with me always. I will love you forever. And until we until we meet on that great high mountain, I will hold you close in spirit. That's it. Thank you. [Applause] Amen. Thank you for those kind words as well. Anybody else? Okay, at this time we're going to we're going to be playing a video at this time. Sorry, sister. I'm sorry. See, I'm going to miss my husband very much. He was a good provider. I'll never forget every year in the summer when he would take a vacation from work, he would ask me, "Where do you guys want to go this summer on vacation?" So, we think about it, you know. Finally, we decided where to go. He was a good man. We had good times and bad times too. We all do. But he was a very caring person. He loved his children. He loved us all. He provided for us very good. He was a good provider. I'll never forget that. I can't complain about that. Well, he was in the hospital. I used to go there and and I we would talk to him, but he was hard of hearing. So the only way we could talk to him was we would take a tablet and write what we wanted to say. And I would uh I would ask him before we would leave, do you want me to read for you to you? and he would nod his head cuz I would read the Bible to him different the chapters of course books in the Bible and he would just sit there he would lay there and close his eyes very peacefully sometimes he would fall asleep on us but I am so happy and so glad because we He was gone from home for nine months off and on when we had him at one time at home we had caregivers and I would still read the word to him. I would make time. We used to spend time like that. We'd pray and we pray that the Lord will bring him home so he could spend a little time with us. Well, okay, we pray for a miracle. But you know what? We're going to miss him very much. But I thank the Lord and I praise him that he accepted the Lord sometime last year or maybe before then. And one day me and sister Bertha went to the hospital and I told her I said Bertha let's talk to him about the Lord. Let's let's see if he will rededicate his life. That's what we did. Bertha, sister Bertha talked to him and again we made sure that he will rededicate his life. He did. And so now I told the Lord, "Okay, Father, I'm going to miss my husband very much. But you know what, Father? I'm so happy and so glad that he's there with you. The night that they I that Friday we had gone to visit him. He was okay. Like I told brother Caleb, I don't understand brother Caleb. We went to see him today. He was good. He was in good spirits. We made him laugh. And and now they called us and tell us he's gone. And I said, "Okay." Anyway, I am so happy and so glad. Then that same night, we were all in my house, my children crying, of course, and my daughter Balissa hugged me. She put her arms around me and as she did, the Lord spoke to me and said, "He's here with me." I said, "Lord, I told them, the Lord just told me he's there with him." So, we all praised him and thank the Lord for it. And she said, "Mom," she said, "the told me to hug you." I praise God for that because though he's going to be gone someday, we'll see him. Yes. And I'm so glad and happy that he's with the Lord. Praise be to God. I never gave up praying for his salvation. There were thoughts when there were times when I thought he would ever come come to know the Lord and he did. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus, that he's there with you, not suffering anymore. Praise you, Lord Jesus. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. What a faithful lady. Amen. Wow. Amen. Amen. This time we're going to be watching a video. If we could please get the lights. Immediately following after the video, we will be having our closing prayer by by our brother uh Daniel Martinez.
