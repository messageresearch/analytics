by our prophet brother William Mariam Branham Corinthians a book of Correction amen wanted to just come by and see them this morning the reason I dropped in so now over in the book of Korean just about the tenth chapter and the first four or five verses let's just meditate on that for a few moments our brother can have time to preach now let's bow our heads first this in his presence blessed it a heavenly father it is indeed with grateful hearts that we bow humbly before the this day to thank thee for the good things of life and realizing that life itself is just one great struggle if we're not having it in one way we are in another but some glorious day the battle will be over and we'll see Jesus who we have looked forward to seeing since we have loved him and become acquainted with him in a relative chewing and we're so happy to know that someday we shall see him now today as we pulled up under the old oak as it was for comfort like Abraham sitting there waiting and God and two angels come up and spoke to him and we're just expecting you to come to us this morning and speak to our hearts through thy word Lord as we fellowship around it bless our dear beloved pastor Lord we pray that you'll give him strength and courage we pray that you'll bless the little church and the Deacons and all that's concerned your Lord and all that comes here not only here but other places your Church Universal bless our visiting brethren who are with us this morning in the service we pray that you will be with them and sustain them forgive us of our sins and speak to us through that word we asked in Christ's name Amen if I'm not mistaken brother Coates is sitting here this morning he was over to pray for another night of Veterans Hospital cancer and we're glad to see you in here this morning brother and sister Coates now in the book of Corinthians the tenth chapter this book of Corinthians is a book of Correction we should take the book of Corinthians it's the only church and all of the New Testament that's seemingly that the leaders had such trouble with but Corinthians of always in trouble Paul when he come among them one had a tongue and one had a psalm and one adds of feeling in a sensation and he's always having trouble with these corinthians keep them straight if we notice he couldn't teach the corinthians deep things they were just a baby fashion they he couldn't go to him in a great deep the messages that he did to the Ephesians and he did to the Romans and teach to them the deep things because it wasn't able to take it they depended too much up on little sensations and little things like that just well I've raised the Lord I got a I had a revelation come to me I had a psalm I have a prophecy Paul's at all these things of things see every one of them they're just not to be trusted too much and so but what he's trying to get to the church was that anchor where we where we have an anchor in Christ where that we don't trust up on sensations we don't trust upon revelations we don't trust these things only we trust Christ that's by your faith that we move out there junkies we notice Paul could teach the Ephesians there how that before the foundation of the world they were predestinated unto the adoption of the sons of God he the Corinthians northing about that they just they had to have a little feeling or something little sensation one this another and they depended on that he couldn't teach them the deep things so I think it's a great when you got a people that you can teach these things in the Holy Spirit can wine these great truths and anchor it into the the people's hearts so they know where they're standing Space Station aural sensation a prophecy or an old prophecy that whatever it might be whatever event we don't when I remember we're not I'm not trying to say that God does not deal through prophecy and things like that but we don't rely upon that we got a deeper hole and that could be re said wherever there is offices it'll fail where there's tons it'll cease and where these and all these sensations of those gradients had not one of them of the evidence that they were saved not one of them wasn't evidence that they were saved not if you could shout if you could prophesy if you could heal the sick if you could speak with tongues if you could interpret tongues if you had wisdom and knowledge none of those mean you're safe not on them you're gonna have every one of them Paul said in first Corinthians 13 and be lost I am nothing see but when you got love an anchor this morning for about an hour before the wife woke up I was awake and the Lord was revealing to me a great something about how God has his church together but that bonds of love and how it must be there's not another way for a man to ever be saved without being born again God willing I want to preach on that this coming week and just giving macare lives in my heart maybe the Lord will give me a message on it now this message this morning has to come to my heart in there is a message of warning and I thought maybe if we would get this warning to the people as Paul was warning these Corinthians if we can get this warning to the people knowing that we're facing a revival now and an examining time when we must be examined now Paul said moreover brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea now he's giving them an understanding that when God brought out Israel from the wilderness into the wilderness to serving and to take them to the promised land they setting forth an example there that as we are brought out in all the material things all the rituals and the ardors they were the same and we find on down a little farther in our lesson that many of those were overthrown because they could do all the rituals and all the orders and everything that God required and still their hearts wasn't right with God now we can do many things we can take communion we can be baptized we can we can come to church have our names on the book or be just as respected revered as we can be and still be lost that's a solemn warning we can be justice just rejoice when the spirit would fall and in a meeting where the word was being preached in our souls would just rejoice with the word and still be lost the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same rain that makes the wheat grow makes the weed growth it's the nature of the product see it's a nature of it that tells what we are therefore it's the nature that's in it that tells what we are seeing not we might be so religious that we wouldn't turn our hands on Sunday to do a thing we might not even take a stitch at our toes on Sunday we might not even feel justified device food on Sunday and we might be soul related and sold higher but yet if we are not literally born again of the Spirit of God we're just worshiping and vain so now it's pretty stiff and we want to really find it and know the truth because remember we're not going to get a second chance at this it's just this one time so you better be real sure now I notice I would not have you ignorant brethren now these Corinthians wanted us to enter firstly they were facing as their eternal hopes up on some sensation Paul said just there said when I come among you one as this one as that and what what that now all that's all right we have nothing against but but still that isn't what we're talking about see that isn't it I remember when I was first converted and I begin to see the working of the Spirit and how that Sun could just impersonate the real genuine Holy Spirit and it's just such a way that it would why it was just impossible to tell which was right and wrong Arlie and I seen a man that I knew and I and Bob discernment I knew that man was living with another man's wife and here he was standing there speaking with tongues and interpreting and everything and giving messages and it was enough got the other fella to a place to work I could speak to him a few moments in a real genuine Christian and I thought how can that spirit the same spirit where I that's when I first seen Pentecost and it was at Mishawaka Indiana and I said yeah it's certainly I thought for the first few hours I there I was among angels and the next few hours I thought I was in the hunk demons when I seen that scene these two men one give a message what a jerk I never heard speaking in tongues and things like that before now watch those spirits how they move about all my while the great little lamb has begun and then when I got a chance on the outside to talk to one of them and could tell what he was made from there was one is evil as he could be and that night I watched him again I thought all get me away from here I can't understand how this is and I've seen those things were in the Bible but here was one doing it that didn't have the Spirit of God and the other one doing it it didn't have the Spirit of God then I was all confused and I just left the whole thing go and years later after the flood was over I was going walking up the road going to greens mill mister eyes for the state senator comes here is Church he's met me on the road he put his arms around me said Billy what does Christ mean to you now my father was gone my brother was gone and my wife was gone my baby was gone I said what does it mean I said mister I'm sure he means more than life to me I said something has happened within me years ago Christ came to my heart and I it's just become more than I am myself it's just something that's happened it wasn't because I was religious it wasn't it's just something that God Jude the grace did for me and I said oh he would slay me I'd trust him just the same and if I was in hell and there was such a thing as love and hell I'd still love him that's how a man it's something in here he's right I deserve every punishment that I ever got you do the same even if that ain't that's something that anchor of love of God that holds in the human heart other things becomes secondary setting on a log up there I was praying about something else and my Bible come open and I was reading and over in the book of Hebrews the sixth chapter and I was reading there how that it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and may protectors of the Holy Spirit see as they follow it to renew themselves to give up to repentance far the rain come up off upon the earth to water it to dressing which is prepared but that which is 9/2 rejection thorns and systems which is not into rejection is to be burned and the Holy Spirit kept speaking to me about that what is that I don't read it over again and then Ephesian come I stole the world standing before me journey there's all disc it up and I Cloudant ready for a plane and there when a man by white soaring seen and after he went around the curvature of the earth another man come and black sowing seeds behind him and one of the thieves are a good man stowed come up what sweet and the bad and black man sowed the seeds come up from dressed in black it come up and it was weed and oh what was contrary to the other a great drought come in the vision and the little wheat bowed its head it was just so thirsty for a drink and the weed bowed his head it was thirsty for a drink not a great cloud come over and rains come down in the loop wheat raised up him again the screen praise the Lord praise the Lord it was so happy to get that water and the little weed raised up again a holler praise the Lord praise the Lord for the same water then I understood see there it is the Holy Spirit or fall but by their fruits they are no one said too large in 15 see not by the reaction of the spirit where they healed where they speak with tongues and where they sang in the spirit or whether they rejoice this to where that they can do all that and still be lost it's your life within you a barn begin experiment now Paul was trying to get this to those currencies I'm over over brother and I wouldn't have wouldn't have you Inger how that our fathers were all under the cloud and pass through the seat and we're back I unto Moses every one of them went into the wilderness jesus said not all that's there Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven it isn't what you say you could preach the gospel to still be long certainly this is not just little kid stuff this is absolutely it's deep and Christianity is not to be just a little like fabulous thing like go over to church now it's my duty to go that uh Christianity brother Christianity isn't is something that God has done God has chosen you in Christ and percentage you as a love gift to Christ and if God's calling election and if we have the opportunity to become that type of person and turn it down for little things of the world now listen as we go on and all did eat that pain spiritual man did you hear that the third burst and all did eat the same spiritual manna what's he speaking up the rituals of the church people come to church and say they have repented and are baptized unto Christ taking on the name of the Lord Jesus and they did that in the wilderness also policy that's what the creek is it they come in in with baptized unto Christ on Christ outwardly professionally and taking it all intellectually had accepted in but rather it's a lot more than intellectuals it goes beyond that it goes to a genuine birth not just the middle conception argument emotional work but a firs and experience something it goes on down deep into the heart and changing in the innermost being that makes you do things that you would not have done other words it makes you love those who are unlovable it makes you at different than you ever thought that you would act it when situations arise it's your anchor you don't have to wonder will I make it oh no it is whether I'll make it it's already made for me Christ in me has made it himself and I just trust in his anchor alone what a wonderful thing notice they all took communion that like that was in we know that it was a natural process because it was the frost like that rained from heaven little wafers with honey on the wafer was just a little like a cracker the cookie and had honey over the top of it and they all work for takers of that everyone passed through the Ritz see he was baptized to the cloud and through the sea on to Moses following his instructions of God's service they were all baptized unto Him they were all followers as we are today led by the Holy Spirit the great instructor of the Christian Church we are led through to water baptism and he said they all taken of the same manner the what did it do that manna fell far Korah and for his group just as same as it did for Moses Caleb and Joshua they were all mixed together all four takers of baptism all four takers of membership all four takers of confession now all four takers of the communion you get look at that solemn wine and Tabernacle folks gift that way down deep remember it's yours eternal destination hangs right there don't just pass it on like a little flutter or something this is something we must come respective to it's something that means whether we live you're after are not they were all baptized into Moses through the Red Sea they all follow that same spirit speed the cloud and the pillar of fire they're always led by the same angel they all come out for the same pasture they always baptized into sea they all eat off that spiritual manner and that manna was Christ Christ coming down the manna come down every night from heaven and perish here to sustain the people in their journey and Christ come from heaven and gave His life that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life Christ come down into chains are matter they eat all these things spiritual blessing therefore the Holy Spirit all riding on monks two people and both Christian and lukewarm and a half believers and borderline believers will all eat the same that doesn't mean it yet oh I wished I had worried that I could drive this down and stitch it in the heart of every person hear it see what a deep thing this is it isn't something to be played with it isn't just going to church now listen they all did eat this pain spiritual matter think of it spiritual matter oh you're set on go on fake hollows we up shouting in the street off the list that doesn't have one thing to do with us you see how we face our eternal destination up on the sensation can you see in this day that we're now living how that people are basing their their destination up all just a little sensation or say i know i got it they called us ah cup the power go through me I did this that might be all exactly the truth and you're still lost oh if we just had a moment let's just turn to first Corinthians 13 here just a moment and listen what Paul's got to say about it right here though I speak with tongues of men and angels and a have not charity which is love I am become as a sounding brass and an appealing symbol though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all the mysteries to know all the knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could move mountains and have not charity I am nothing listen to that sternal apostle drive it into this sensational Church who's basing your hopes up own sensations now this is sunny school this is a place of Correction this is a place of teaching and wool unto the man that will standing up a little bit and mislead brother it's time that we've made Scripture compared with Scripture it's right and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it for faileth means nothing see all your good works all your good deeds all the spiritual things you have all the gifts you have all the sensations you have all the joy you have all the PS has nothing at all to do with it you begin with think up that just a moment and think of the churches the dates aren't great churches Presbyterian methodist fastest and the nominations they think because they say I believe come in put her name on the book that settles it how far they're all our Pentecostal people think well because if they thought a little sensation they felt good they spoke with tongues they got a little blood in your hands the lore on their face or something we got it Oh 10 million miles off you get see how the devil is the god of this world has blinded eyes of those and they just go right on living like that listen bar though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body burned and have not charity I am nothing look at all those gifts all those good things up feed the poor got a good heart about me I'll do this I do that I go to church I speak with tongues I prop I heal the sick ah preach the gospel I do these things Paul sit still I am nothing all those things can be carnally impersonated now what does this a charity supper long is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself not puffed up does not miss behave itself unseemly just think not easily provoked thinketh no evil charity love what is love is God how does God come to you by birth see now they always baptized unto Moses they all did eat of the communion they all have the same spiritual matter that come from gotta every one of them eat the same thing and today we stand not around and hear the word and rejoice over and take them in and eat it and say all hallelujah that good all I appreciate that yes I was baptized in the church I take it make my profession I put my name on the book on the chart remember all that is perfectly in vain if there isn't something that God has done if it is done of the things that you did that's the things that your faith produce but unless God has done something to you to new birth just a moment down now the for first and it all drink the same spiritual rough fourth a drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ they all drink from the fountain they rejoice that what does that mean though we end the week book rejoice to get that spiritual water we go to the church we clap our hands out with the rest of them we jump up and down on the floor with the rest of them we praise God for the rest of we prophesy with the rest seven weeks deacon tongues like the rest them we pray for the stick like the rest of them buddy said not listen as we go just a little farther now that won't it stop them in a no on that rock wha right the rock wha cried it was there in literal farm as it is in spiritual farm today the man of the food which is the word that comes from God out of heaven right is the word of God and we eat the word see we stuff like them the message this morning within the listen our whole reach and grab that word we live by the words that they all eat that same spiritual manner and they all fit drinks all three of that things spiritual rough and that rough watts price think of it now what's he going to put it to it in here ease warning those Corinthians be careful what you're doing what I'll come alone you want as a psalm one is it turn one is with this in one half of that one has a proxy one has a revelation one's doing this and one's doing that be careful don't base your faith upon that those things are all right they got their place and in the church but don't never face your salvation on that if your life doesn't tally up to God's Word then it's time for a get right with God notice now and this rock this rock was a rock that was in the wilderness and I want you to notice when God called Moses and sent him down into Egypt to deliver the children of Israel from under the yoke of payroll he said what is that in thy hand and he said it's a stick and he tucked the stick and threw it on the ground and it became a serpent and he Moses fled then he picked it up and it become a stick in his hand and that rod when he got into Egypt he stretched it over Egypt and it flies come up he stretched it and plague fell it was God judgment God's judgment was in the stretching forth of the rod and the notice before that rod could really be handled Moses put his hand in his bosom it's become leprosy like every man is to begin with a sinner bad nature there's no way around it you're born in sin shapes and iniquity come to the world speaking lies you might have been dedicated on the altar on your mother's church she might have a wrinkle you might have been just that but you are a sinner to begin with then there is another what God said put your hand back into your bosoms over his heart he put his hands again as the commission of God where we brought forth first his hand a leper you were brought forth by God first eight tenor not the chart but by nature then you go back again and when you come out the hand was clean and perfect joint that this hand before could waive the judgment rod had to be a cleaned and the floor could play even any Minister any featured on heard something of mine that actually curdled my blood when I turned on my radio just before coming no disregard and of is anybody here relations as a person I don't mean to hurt you but it's time and God helped me to always be Christian enough to put make what black black and white white to be honest I heard someone singing and said I have my Testament and turn it on and read of Scripture and preached from the first stop blessed it is the Spanish that have gotten us feet of the stronger walketh in the way of sinners you know what that rock-and-roll God Ginny Oz burns from on the radio preaching the gospel oh brother if there ever was of disgrace a person like that has got no business moving into the word of the Living God and you picked this fellow the rich rose valley barn day up all night and whole shindig clapping her hands and going on an old shindig and the next morning change his voice around and talk like a Christian and why it's buggerin Delphinus in the side of God the hand that waves this judgment rod must be passed by the power of the resurrection of Christ got no business and the Word of God even a lot of preachers trying to justify this Elvis Presley which is nothing in the world but a modern Judas Iscariot Judas Iscariot got thirty pieces of silver elvis presley got a million dollars to flee to Cadillacs but he's sold out he was a Pentecostal believer and sold out his birth facts to become our rocket and since power off let's get hot don't pull any punches on it no sir and on modern judas iscariot and then even the ministers kind of up build that kind of a paint and he'll the princess and y'all trust God for my success how would a living holy God ever give success above guarantee and a devil denies that absolutely simple the greatest hindrance that this nation has ever seen is a guy like Elvis Presley who sent millions of souls to hell by his old dirty filthy rock'n'roll surely I don't have any apology at all you can leave me to be God's prophet remembers there is a incarnated devil absolutely and Jenny Osborne of those has got no business with the Word of God that neither any man that picks the name of common faith and shindigs and aces a little rock and roll and powder stuff I got the company food kind of picked the word of pot that's what's a matter with many of these churches today you get some of these little boogie-woogie Zout of these places out here a little old girl is out chin digging it doing all these your walk and roll over one night she comes over the next night you got her upside of the special some of you guys taking a move guitar players out of the places out there on a nightclub and fighting the pulpit preaching it to me brother I tell you you'd never do it here no indeed he's got the study to prove himself a man of God and fun enough we don't believe this your overnight jumping around like this that's what got the churches and today we need truth this word is true that's right if I handed sweet is this judgment rot must be a clean hand absolutely that judgment at hand of Moses is clean then the rod was put in it and the rod went down and drop judgments up on Israel and then in the wilderness is up beautiful - on his clothes this beautiful time when there was the rock and that rock block Christ and the perigee people were dying for water and they deserved it they deserved to die because they had murmured that complain they were not believers at the beginning they were nothing but in turn next show believers say that supernatural had been done and the multitude had went out they wasn't converted from their heart there was only three in the bunch that we know of Moses Aaron and Kenan Miriam had married him shorter tendency to when she left the college Moses married this Negro girl and said was there no other girls to be married and so forth he is gonna end table wasn't pleased with that and smaller with a leprosy and her own brother sweetened up and would you let your sister die and that she and God told Moses to come before you that he went and interceded for letter for Miriam she didn't live long after that no brother what God does is perfect we got no business with our minds putting anything to it just leave it the way it is God did it God said it that settles it just take it'll happen if I could explain it then I'd be equal with God Anup and explain and I just believe it huh that's all I'm afternoon there's nobody else to explain it because it's beyond our intellectual it's beyond our it's got another but cannot explain our just expected by faith and since my private property and I believe it I cannot explain how this rock lien they're gone had a rough that have a store full of water just a little rock for have that little bigger net dance but what Moses smoked this rock there was enough water came from it to water two million people in and not only that but as many Catalans sheets and things as I had with him oh when I see some of these artists nude pictures a little little drop falling out of a rock and a kid standing there with a bucket in his hand oh it's never come like that it's bountiful gushers gushing a house it's watered over two million people besides their camels and all their animals that rock was Christ Jesus of beautiful parallels of John 3:16 God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life and notice what happened it's the only way that they could get that water out of that rock that judgment rod had to strike the rock and Moses smoked the rock and God's judgment stuck upon the rock and when it did it gave forth its water the people were absolutely God was Justin letting them die because they had dips beneath him and if audible they were Rhetta bait they did not desert sand there even riff Moses Colin rebel resilience against God and they deserved that and all of us deserve death because we are rebellious against God even a wreck notice we all desert a guy but God is so merciful never thought of it but he's so merciful so he took the sins of every one of us and strike up all these all beloved son price that we might not perish but would have each turn of the night how could we drink from that rock and then he'll be right in our hearts but brother there's millions of them this morning you're doing it said exactly right there trust me because their package or Methodist or Pentecostal their custody because they had a little funny feeling because they spoke with tongues because they shouted because they danced to call they had a healing service of God he allistic or something they're trusting upon because they had a revelation it was true because they did this then things are all right nothing to say against that but that has nothing to do with your salvation not why pain you could put all out of your hands to it went to the gallon of blood out of your faces still me nothing so right Paul said I could speak with tongues like men and angels still be lost no or I could have wisdom and knowledge you're standing strain that by witnesses make it look just type together that's still have you got nothing to do with him brother they all drink from the same rock that rock was Christ the judgments is up on Christ that you might be privileged to come and drink it's God's goodness to you that you do come drink it's God's good to see you that you do eat from the word God's goodness even he's permitted you to be baptized God's goodness to you to make you assistance to give you the house to set you in the church this morning it's God's goodness that's all God's goodness but what about your goodness back to God are you willing to submit everything every spot ever I should ever thank you to him that's what that's what God has done for you what would you do for him notice let's just read a couple more verses now I'll close so the pastor can get to his word now look and this same laws Christ now the fit first but with many of them God was not did he see he permitted them to be baptized he permitted them to eat the word and believe it he permitted time to get spiritual blessing he prohibited them to drink from the spiritual rock Oh that God did by His grace but yet God was not pleased with them look par they were overthrown in the wilderness after all these experiences after all are great healing services we've seen after all the great miracles we see perform after all the great TVs we've had a shouting and praising God drinking from that rock all the good sermons that we have enjoyed and yet be overthrown it's all over depart from me you workers of iniquity God didn't even know yes check out we got a revival coming I know this is hard a brother and father that won't correct these sugars not a good dad right overthrow it now these things were our examples pull stinky you believe it it was an example all right to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted good you imagine on man stands a jockey record spinner and plain old dirty rotten rolls and something happened got all shook up and all those kinds of dirty old songs that Elvis Presley and these guys play and then come back and impersonate preaching the gospel thank God could you imagine a man his woman setting out enough the woman laying out in the backyard and a little dirty have clothes on throwing herself before man and then come right back around and drink from this spiritual rock and shout and carry on there's a great doctor among the Pentecostal people's liberation of women they're wearing great long earrings and doing all kinds of dressings and a young fella stepped in front of my house a few days ago in a little truck crying that his wife Pentecostal speak with tongues gifts prophesy sure and say it all the whole church wear shorts and he she goes out on the street at eight to nine o'clock at night picking up little cigarette stumps another two stowed away and smoking and still shouting praising the Lord and given promises I stood the other day in the church or a great man of God that I have great respect far and he was exposing this after one of the man who's one of the head of it goes off and he has all this blood run now their hands and things and I've become hoarse from East from West trying to condemn that thing on the grounds of the Bible when it's not God any through thought that would come from Christ would be carful Bluffs Denny's car full of bodies here then the Second Coming is over Jesus said buddy but not when they say low aged in the desert believe it not when he sure believe it not all there'll be false christs arise and false prophets and they'll show signs and wonders in so much of this these are very elect and I've screamed it from the east to the west and fighting on the west coast but an old doctor Canada who's a bosom friend of mine stood up and another bandit with a certain man the start of this one of these movies come up there and give a great big said pure or and holy blood her blood will be shown today and they packed the place out and he sholde it out under his belt he has two needles sticking down anyone knows you can pluck this finger and it won't bleed unless you some milk it or squeeze it you stick a hole in it it won't do it the cause of AIDS or safar away from there and when he did it he's short I've done the ads a little back here ladies hands on then he come up and said see my hands perfectly normal then he said glory to God hallelujah any milk these hands down I got sure there was blood squeeze from these fingers while everybody was shot he wiped his head members across when the very man is with the man that did it there it was exposed got out there before the audience and with went in his pocket the show oils and stuff one kind of hard on the wall and said this wall is breathing the blood of Jesus that's the Heart of Jesus a big old text and walked in was the spirit said if anybody had touched that they would die they had ropes all got the pictures of it everything there for this wall with breathing blood out of a heart and this fellow walks in and slipped into the church him his wife wash the paint off of the wall and set back out there and waited to come in the pastor said well you know Jesus has been in here tuck that off he said Jesus had nothing to do with it I've done it myself right what's happened is because people are unstable Don the word of the Living God don't the Bible say they go from the east from the west and the north and the south there'd be a famine not for bread and water alone but for the hearing of the word of God what a day that we're living in and we see not all these great denominational churches are all weaken themselves together and it's got their plates that you have to bomb to this league on churches before you can even have a radio you're gone from the radio why don't you never worry about that and SMR tune all the television programs you'll have to blow to the league of churches before that you're forming nothing in the world but the mark of the beast of the Bible there you are see how it's all deep together old thanks be to God there is truly a Living God there's truly a true Lord that's truly a true word there's truly a true healing there's truly of all these things but brother don't you never base your faith up on some little sensation up on the church order you say I'm oldest brother I've taken god that may be just exactly truth or what kind of a place is that falling in that's the next thing what kind of a bucket did it come in dude Justin unjust now listen now these were examples do the piece that we should not look after evil things as they also lusted what was there last night listening won't get just a little bit part of you excuse me neither be ye idolaters or you say I thank God I'm not on my daughter wait just a minute let's examine it by the words then I would worship an idol that doesn't altogether mean you worship an idol you just have to be idle doing nothing go to church go back home do nothing about it brother real born-again matter when we can't stand they don't there's something in them they got to testify they got to do something they're bound to do something they st. holder peace listen neither the idolaters as they were some of them and it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play let's all talk about example they were baptized into the church they absolutely had a correct baptism was three times forward backward in the name of father son holy go just only whatever it was they had a correct baptism there were baptized right we busted students already about little things like that what good does a new you're leaving off the main principle our churches is separate over back in certainly then you say well Oh hallelujah they haven't got the spiritual blessing we have there's old coal farm of glory to God I keep the real man of God on doors truth that's it back to the truth of what Gipper's does that make you say brother are the Holy Ghost really follow up in our church that's good for what difference does it make to you if you're not the right kind of a vessel it's falling in remember oh you say I'm sincere so were they they left their homes and we're not even cut their neck out for death to follow they did a lot more than what we have to do but didn't have one thing you just think the Bible said in vain do they worship me in vain do they worship Me absolutely true worship in vain where did it begin us come from the Garden of Eden Cain he worshipped God just the same as Abel did but in vain he worshiped yes sir there's the way to seemeth right from Julian you say well why is it now I believe in it why is it I'm not alright I'll repeat it I think I'm just as good as anybody else I go to church of is baptized I get the best things about I love a good sermon I love the Word of God like to read it and I get spiritual blessings to it how do I can prophesy I'm speak with tongues I've got always things give me the second beans I'm not saying something but it's possible that it could be in vain right it depends on what you are in there drying is what you are that's receiving this if you're not barn begin if there's not actually something in you then it's vain all the best things I have enough to do not just one boy neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and 20,000 commits fornication that's spiritual fornication we had time to sunny school's over spiritual fornication neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as summer then murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer mermen lust and mix in the world with your religion going on God love purity real pure this morning I was talking about what not closing I thought this what is any sweeter in a man's life what is any sweeter than they come home when he's tired and weary with this bucket his hands from working all their plowing and whatever he might be to walk in I have a lovely wife to meet him at the door sit down on his lap a minute and brush his brow a little and kiss him on the cheek and put her arms around him and say dear I I know you're tired you've worked so hard give him consolation now that he knows that that arm is around him is absolutely his as his memories around any other man or any other desire the kiss this on his cheeks is from real pure holy heart I just love skiing and him alone how it makes you I know makes you stick your chest out show us apart after all see that's his it does something to you I want to tell you something but what if that kisses placed on his cheek and he has me confidence it might have been on some other man what about my arms around him has embraced everybody but still desiring through the same it won't mean very much there's not much help there why now in the beginning they were one God when he made man he made dual persons both male and female he separated in flesh and putting here on earth and flesh and the female part was still in spirit look friend God was so careful oh don't let it leave yeah God never got a handful of dust and may to Eve she's been a different creation and she's not a creation she's a byproduct and God goes over in the heart of Adam this rib that off hundreds heart and takes the ribbon makes a life and the very part of Adam spirit was in the woman and they too are one soul bodies spirits they are lung they are perfect oneness a real woman and a real husband the real life they are one together what is the type of price from out of these boobs and out of buy product not a Methodists or Baptists or Pentecostal hatch up no sir but he took a sweetheart that's just pure in-law college she can be she's a lot better than it look at look at their solemn and speaking combines let us walk in the tomogram let us take our fill of love and when the real believer opens his arms the pure heart it holds up to Christ that affection of that lover of Christ goes into his bosom is his wife just like the husband does to a real wife what type of person should we be are we playing the harlot with cranks are we depending on some little something and running at the world of things the world and worldly minded or not that real love and devotion that we should have could you imagine my could you imagine your wife brother tell me the setting on your lap with her little prickly frills or little under skirts and things of lace and her little hair all done up and pickled up their thing like a butter I say Oh John I just love you I love you and you know right then that there's something wrong you having a confidence in her no matter how pretty she looks and how well she's fixed you if you don't have that perfect confidence in her there's something wrong it doesn't it doesn't satisfy that longing that man would have for his wife and now I just think of yourself fooling with the world and tangling with the world in get nominees say Oh Lord Jesus I love you it's a burning Judas hypocrite yes sir I think of these things as a rebound we're coming up the hill okay oh you might have the wedding ring on that's right but you're not a wife oh you might be a woman you might be the lady of the house but you're not a wife if you act like that and you're not a readable Christian you're not a real Jenny one product for Christ if you don't love even everything that you got within you I don't care what you look pretty whether you don't you love him and you express yourself that's when you two become one that's when Christ and His Church not by denomination not by baptism not the sensations not been nothing but by real love you were bought from the bosom of God when he was wounded there and he bought you and your love and your trueness and your loyalty proves what you are see what I mean whether you all fricking up or whether you I don't care my wife wouldn't never comb her hair if she didn't wear a pretty dress or never they should be must we'd heart I had not her because her and loyalty her virtue what she is that's what she is and by Christian men and women that's what we are in the side of God it's not because if we can go to the best church and we can invest best or we can get in this neighborhood or we can do this or we can rot in this or we can do this that that doesn't have one thing to do with it it's a virtue of our loyalty and our love to Christ and that's the birth that's the thing that comes and though I speak with tongues of men and angels nothing go off beat the poor though I give my good so I do this to do that to do that I am nothing what this Christ care about what all you can do what all you can do like it if that real genuine love and all healthy isn't it think of it won't you this is Sunday school and remember that's a lesson to you be in your heart let Christ have first place like the real woman would do her husband no other arms could touch her no where no other kids no matter how charming it looks ear should turn her head she's got one step love and that's for her husband it that's right no matter how handsome the man might be in high polish to stick his heir might look and how am i holy stuff correct no sir not one thing she loves that husband let him out of known that she loves she far fits all of her virtues and all of her kisses or her Lovings and everything is to her husband and him alone do you want to mean and you Sparkle everything of the world on there how good look how pretty it looks and how fascinating it looks your virtue is what your cat about new he'll do yeah I know I got the call about this is how are you had enough kipper to fight a bus off let me tell you brother it takes virtue who the Christ respects me though I speak with tongues of men and angels though I pour forth blood out of both hands though I shout and dance in the spirit though I eat the Word of God love it though I drink from the same spiritual rock at the rest of the dough I kept my hands as loud as arrest though I have to cry crocodile tears so I can do all this but at that real genuine real Christian virtue is there to Christ you become as a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal Paul was warning his church of this the Corinthian church where she was all mixed up in all kinds of fantastic I'm warning you friends remember I'll have to answer for you that the day of judgment and your blood won't be upon me no matter how Lord you are anything else be long to Christ remember that as we praying blessed Heavenly Father in this present estate we come now and confessing all of our wrongs Oh be thou merciful merciful God and we pray that you'll look down into our hearts and in this hour while we are waiting with our heads bowed to the dust look into the heart of the old man into the heart of the elderly women into the heart of the middle age and the young even the little children and may we examine ourselves we're coming into that holy week that we celebrate as Good Friday and Easter the resurrection though this year we might have been loyal to church though we might have taken the communion though we might have shouted we might have done many things but Oh God look down into my heart talk borrow myself look into my heart into the heart of this people here this morning and examine us lord if there be something that takes the place of Christ Oh God take it away if it's laziness is insufficient see if it's whatever it might be I don't know but God take it from us oh we don't want to be overthrown right you're at the time of the battle over thrilled by God and be an enemy to him Oh God look into our hearts examine us but I Holy Spirit and let us see this morning if there's any evil thing in us if there is take it away father we now lay it on the altar to walk away and leave it there if it's idleness if it's temper if it's in difference if it's neglecting if it's whatever it may be if it's hatred if it's malice if it's time if it's whatever it may be Oh God take it from us today and this coming revival may we be just so full of your charm Lord until many will come in and be saved the little community here where we've tried so hard the first revival 19 years that I've al now I pray that you'll give us that real real spirit in our hearts and may it a car for eternity Granite Lord make us the examine ourselves we married people by the way we treat our wives how true we are are how true our lives is to us and maybe we just get in our hearts this morning how we'd think of something like that happen in our home and then may we turn our affections towards you and say O God be merciful to me oh yeah if the wife were just about every once - month just come by and put her hand on yours and say dear I love you and walk on or how it would seem she was neglecting me how it would seem that something was wrong and God went maybe once the month or once when we go to church we offer a little prayer or you are our love our communion all the time our thoughts and our intents of our heart will be stayed on being granted Lord Oh keep our hearts so said only that the things of the world would become blind and so in the different granite Lord hear us now and bless us in the further part of these services we asked in Christ's name Amen now the Lord bless you real - Andrew and I sorry I've taken up a few extra minutes Terry at the sunday school was dismissed and I prayed that God will bless you I didn't say these things this is out of God's Word there were examples to us there are examples and now look Fran how would you feel that you know the wife that was kissing Yuna was a betrayer thank studying when alone yeah what would you think not when you come to God in a betrayer don't do the head let's be real you don't have to take a sensation you don't have to take something different one the whole skies are full of the real genuine love of God why pick a substitute when we could get the real it's far yet I may the Lord bless you has a turn of service to our pastor and
