[30:19] we do have to make the people aware that
[30:21] was eternal I can tell Tonto of the of

[30:43] I said I'm not attacking the brother I
[30:44] don't I don't know the brother
[30:47] Konoha but what got me okay so was not
[30:51] just the words of the song no solo
[30:54] foreign las palabras de saber tanto the
[30:56] reaction of the people la reacción de la
[30:59] gente that that that's what really it
[31:01] it's sad in my heart may this yo me
[31:04] could I don't fill my heart with such
[31:06] sadness I tell you mean by the or tanto
[31:08] and like I said it's not just because of
[31:10] the words but but but to see the people
[31:12] just just taking it and saying yes yes
[31:15] no sólo las palabras that come to us you
[31:16] know like a takeover xeo now and and the
[31:18] song in the song en el canto it mentions
[31:22] it just it states this means your night
[31:24] is a stone that Ephesians 4 Disick a
[31:27] physios Quatro is not enough no it's by
[31:30] standing to bring this bride in shape
[31:32] but a para her eyes dunno yeah and as I
[31:36] said it hurt me to my soul to to hear
[31:39] that email Alma in other words they they
[31:42] feel that the Ministry of Ephesians 4
[31:45] since you think and they stated their
[31:47] fists which is known as the fivefold
[31:48] ministry it's gonna see a comeback into
[31:50] pieces it's not enough to get a bride
[31:51] ready know as bastante para para know
[31:54] that that Ephesians 4 has failed FSU's
[31:57] quatrefoil yellow and and when you look
[31:59] at that and don't know mean it saddens
[32:01] you because
[32:02] you realize that Ephesians 4 is part of
[32:04] the sacred scriptures interest in
[32:06] supporting official pastors but today
[32:08] and IIIi don't believe that that
[32:11] Ephesians 4 has failed
[32:12] you know KF is quite rough I yeah we may
[32:15] fail as men Oh mom risky Santos fine but
[32:18] God's Word never fails
[32:20] Peniel no fun we have to make sure that
[32:22] that that is settled within us in a case
[32:25] ago that's okay yes and they don't
[32:26] matter who or how popular the man is if
[32:29] it again okay the poorest people are or
[32:31] who they may be or who their name is
[32:34] okay I wanna always what's that we
[32:37] always remember what this is him pray
[32:39] that God's Word will never fail when he
[32:42] says that he placed this fivefold
[32:45] ministry in the church 22nd Iglesia
[32:47] color coat is the memorial perfecting of
[32:49] the Saints for Allah perfection or the
[32:51] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[32:54] the body of Christ if you could've at
[32:56] believes that this ministry will have a
[32:59] bride ready but I do not know there we
[33:02] understand that this ministry does not
[33:04] preach its own message the most custom
[33:06] is there's no prints but it is a vision
[33:08] ministry that is keeping the voice of
[33:10] Elijah alive it assistant ministerial
[33:12] came until I was alias Eva through all
[33:14] the divisions at restore all the
[33:17] fanaticism
[33:18] Infinity's all the false doctrines all
[33:20] has no penis for there has to be a bride
[33:22] that is being perfect dick ever gonna
[33:24] know yet kisses that but it's just
[33:26] because someone does not see it
