for this day and for letting us be here and put me aside so you can take over and the children can learn something yes is name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated have you been nervous or really worried about something how many here know that brother Branham had a nerves problem many of the people he prayed for had nervousness this is my testimony of how the Lord healed me last year I started to become nervous and it started to affect my body I didn't want to eat and I started feeling sick and had nausea on and off so I got prayed for at the altar it went on for about a month until one Sunday morning I couldn't take it anymore so my mom took me to the hospital the first thing they did was a test and they came back man's nurse said I was dehydrated before the doctor even saw me by looking at my symptoms he said that I had diabetes so decided to keep me overnight the following day they took more tests because my blood sugar was off by the end of the day the doctors and the nurses were confused because they couldn't find anything wrong the Lord told brother Caleb that nothing was wrong with me and he turned against us your Bibles to Philippians 4:6 be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God I want to read a quote from brother Branham and it's from the message letting off the pressure it was preached on May 13th 1963 and then a nervous neurotic age that we're living in and you know and all this the doctors don't have the answers because they're plagued with it too they don't have the answer they don't know what to do you say Oh doctor I am just about to blow my head I don't know what to do I well he'd say I am too well there's nothing you can do he would give you a tranquilizer when that wears off you're more nervous than you was in the first place like a drunk man taking an extra drink to get over snugness you see so you you can't do it there's no answer they don't have it but God has the answer that's what we want to take talk about to have the answer God has got the answer he is the answer Christ is the answer to every problem we got any sickness in the world yes can heal if you're feeling sick kids he already healed us it's our job to believe him and believe his word I hope you received and learned something god bless you [Applause] well it was a drink uh thank you lord they were fishing for the lower well hey there hey y'all doing it was cramped in there Wow what a testimony a man well for those of you who don't know me my name is burger Evans hey there and I want to share with you a little testimony something that happened with me just earlier today how many of you know the Prophet brother branham a man while I was out fishing with him well let me tell you a little story first when I first met brother brenell he was down in a hotel lobby and he came up to me and we stalking and then he's just so kind and gentle and and he said brother Evans can I ask you something I said sure brother Brown he said you like to go fish and don't you I said yes sir he said you caught a lot of fish the other day didn't you I said yes I did he said why'd you throw him away when the game warden came by I said well I'm sorry for the brand name I should have done that he said well I have one request for you I said sure brother Brown said aren't you take more than fish rat so I said all right I don't take you so we went and well first me and my brother went out and I don't know if y'all have shakes out here but we have what's called a ground rattler and my brother's fishing and we've been fishing all our lives out there and you got to be careful with snakes especially this time of year and he went to steppin and a rattlesnake beat him right on the leg and he got out like a wounded puppy laughs and he was scared and before he knew what his leg was swelling up I didn't know what to do so we took him to the house and mama put him on some ice and and we got him all fixed up so few days after that I went out and me and brother branham went out and we was out fishing and man we were catching some big uns and I threw my line out and we started catching ten pounders seven pounders and we were having a good time and I was out there and had my boots on and I thought I'd sit down for a little while because out where we were at there was Gators everywhere water moccasins cottonmouth so I pulled out my gun I was keeping them all away you gotta make sure you're awake now so I was so happy to be out there at the profit and just to see him fishing and so I I was all soaking wet so I took my boots off for a little bit and I was sitting there and brother Brandon was fishing and I just seen his fishing pole bend down like that and he's pulling one in and right when he was about to pull him up that fish just broke the line got away so I said that was Big Jim there brother branham why don't you cast that in again and get him so Billy brown threw his cast out and got him again so I said I'll help you brother Brown so I jumped up off my seat and right when I stepped I just felt the most excruciating pain right in my leg a big old snake just bit me ground rattler and so as soon as it hit me I fell to the floor and I screamed like that it just hurt me so bad my leg fit pillows I couldn't even move and I was crying for Mama and brother branham came up to me and and boy I weigh about 200 pound brittle Brown ain't very big you know and I said well Billy Brown your ain't gonna be able to carry me out of here you know it's two miles back to the car and we was in trouble as our brother just said you know you got a colon Lord he's an ever-present help in a time of need a man and the Prophet very calmly just came to me and he said brother Evans you just sit still and he put his hand where the stake too bit me and he said Lord you gave them power you gave us power to tread over serpents and scorpions and it were not harmless and right when he did that I started laughing not that it was funny because the pain left me and I just felt so good I couldn't help but laugh and I said well brother Brown I guess we better continue fishing so we did and I threw my line out and we just kept catching we caught up to 11 12 inch fish bass and it was some goodie and so that night we got back to to the cabin we had our string fooled fish and and I showed them to my brother and the story got brought up about that old snake and he was sitting there stealing a cast from the last weekend and he said well it's okay to be religious but it's another thing to be dumb he's like you'd better get yourself up to that Hospital and I said well he said you need that anti-venom you know what anti-venom is so when you get bit by a snake you got to get an anti-venom Slade will kill the poison in your body and I said well Jesus already did that for me at 10 o'clock this morning and I'm still alive at 10 o'clock at night so if I ain't going to make it from here on out then I'm not going to make it I believe the Lord just going to take control so that was my experience with the Lord and with the Prophet and like our brother was saying we go through many things in life sometimes we get sick sometimes we get anxiety whatever it may be but what you got to realize kids is those are just symptoms the devil can't do anything to you because Jesus already healed you it's already been paid for and sickness all Satan can do is give you what are called symptoms symptoms are only yours if you accept them and I want to show you all something hopefully it'll help you understand what I'm talking about symptoms brother Brown says or like a gift from Satan who wants a gift it's from Satan and it has your name on it - andreas from the big ugly you won't open it you don't want who wants to fit who's brave okay really why don't you open up this nice dandy gift see what Satan has for you huh you know he's afraid who's brave huh it's a doggy so a Satan has for you is a nice box of rattlesnakes that's the kind of gift Satan last to give you who want some nice box of rattlesnakes as a pet full of venom sharp teeth paralyze you I don't think so so in one sense brother Brown says these snakes are sent to you they have your name on them and they're for you if you accept them that's the key you don't have to accept anything that Satan wants to give you now if the postman were to bring these to you you'd say I don't want that junk you take it back where you got it from and by law you have to take it and send it back - who sent it to you in this case you deny what Satan's trying to give you you give it back to him and he'll take it back to Hell where it came from so whatever sickness you got or whatever you're dealing with all you got to say is singing I don't want that trash and you take it back to Hell where it came from I am not sick I don't have anything wrong with me and I'm healed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ and that's what I did that day when I was fishing with the Prophet I could have looked at the symptoms my brother was back at home with his legs swelling up like a balloon and we was two miles out I could have thought well there ain't no anti-venom we ain't got no ambulance brother branham won't carry me two miles he would have but it were taking him a while and we were in a state of emergency and all we could do was call on the Lord and that's why everything you do you got to make sure he's near because brother Brown said that day why the holy spirit was just standing off waiting for that word to be coated and as soon as he heard it he just came right by and did what he wanted to do because when he hears that word he just loves to heal his children and so that's the lesson for today don't accept what the devil's trying to put on him when he tries to bite you at that venom the anti-venom is the Word of God and you got to have it inside of you when that bike come so you're immune to it because it can't penetrate the Word of God when it's in your heart how many of you understand that today a man let's go ahead and stand I'm going to call the song leader up and I want you all to worship like you never had before amen stay awake now [Applause] and how much how many enjoyed that how many you enjoyed that this raised our hands who did that was fun huh that's good a man
