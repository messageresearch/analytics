[8:48] today man can we get one to the Lord at
[8:54] this time we have a little video we'd
[8:57] like to show you
[8:58] so if they'd go ahead and put that up
[9:00] and turn the lights off and God bless
[9:04] you
[9:28] my name is philip garcia this is the
[9:32] tractor that I was bush hogging in the
[9:33] back pasture on July 25th when I my son
[9:37] Silas Garcia fell off of the tractor and
[9:40] got ran over and I'd like to share with
[9:43] you the testimony that the Lord did for
[9:45] me and my family we were in like I said
[9:49] the back pasture here is back over here
[9:52] behind the woods
[9:54] we were Bush Hagen and I had Silas
[9:56] sitting in my lap right here we've gone
[9:59] around the perimeter one time already
[10:01] there's a lot of tree branches that
[10:03] overhang the perimeter and so he's
[10:05] sitting in my lap right here and he's
[10:07] kind of he kind of hangs on to you gets
[10:09] his arm wrapped around you and so forth
[10:10] and we're moving along on the fourth
[10:12] gear on this end on this tractor run at
[10:15] about 2,000 rpms
[10:18] we're moving along and every time a tree
[10:19] branch comes you kind of duck down or
[10:22] you may have to lift the branch over the
[10:23] stack or something and you're just kind
[10:25] of moving along and we got around the
[10:27] whole perimeter once and we're almost
[10:28] done with the second second pass where
[10:31] we were completely away from the trees
[10:32] and we're we're moving along and we're
[10:35] like right where we only have one or two
[10:37] more trees that we got to get underneath
[10:39] and then we're back into the open
[10:41] pasture and a sycamore branch was
[10:44] hanging real low and he was sitting in
[10:46] my lap right there and I had him and he
[10:48] was hanging on to me and I went to lift
[10:50] the branch over I believe I believe on
[10:53] that one I had to lift the branch over
[10:54] and somehow he he just slipped out and
[10:59] douve for the ground right there I'm I
[11:02] don't sure he wasn't hanging on to
[11:04] nothing and I guess I wasn't hanging on
[11:06] to him good enough and when I saw him go
[11:10] I just knew like the devil just pounds
[11:13] in your mind that you're gonna run over
[11:16] your son and kill him and that yes
[11:18] that's the end there's there's no way in
[11:20] the world you can you can stop a tractor
[11:23] fast enough I reached for him I remember
[11:24] trying to grab him I couldn't get him it
[11:27] was too far gone I slammed in the clutch
[11:29] I pushed on the brake but my feet
[11:31] weren't on those I'm just kind of
[11:33] launched a lot ly driving so I slant I
[11:35] find the clutch I find the brake I stop
[11:37] and when I finally get stopped I looked
[11:40] down there and I kind of this right here
[11:43] in Silas his feet are sticking towards
[11:45] the bush hog and as it is square
[11:54] underneath that back tire and I just
[11:59] screamed out to God I said oh god you
[12:03] gotta help me you gotta save my boy it's
[12:06] his feeder back there I have an
[12:10] independent PTO system which was engaged
[12:13] automatically pulled my three point up
[12:15] as fast as I could and and I keep
[12:18] looking back there and he's just he's
[12:20] he's squirming underneath that that tire
[12:24] and it just it didn't look right I mean
[12:27] it doesn't so I reached down here I
[12:30] kicked my pto out
[12:32] and I'm already in fourth gear and I go
[12:34] to move out real slow and for some
[12:37] reason I I knew that the PTO was out I
[12:40] squared it up obvious when it's in it it
[12:43] makes these pretty significant click
[12:47] noises and I kicked it out of
[12:49] independent PTO I went to take off and I
[12:52] don't know why but that that PTO spun
[12:54] and when it did it it caught its little
[12:57] foot and it smacked at one time I threw
[13:01] the clutch back in and I believe I said
[13:04] out loud why is the PTO going I was very
[13:07] confused at that point and I kept crying
[13:10] out to the Lord
[13:11] Lord save him Lord Almighty God you got
[13:15] to help me and I I kicked it over put it
[13:19] back in neutral and I pulled forward in
[13:21] that time it didn't it didn't it didn't
[13:23] spin and I eased off of it and I kind of
[13:26] rolled forward and I stopped to where
[13:29] his head was right between the tire in
[13:31] the bush hog and and I put the tractor
[13:35] in neutral I jerked the ebrake up as far
[13:37] as I could and and little Silas his head
[13:40] was still on the ground there and he's
[13:43] just laying there and he kind of lifted
[13:45] up his head and and turned and he he
[13:46] looked at me and his little face was
[13:50] smashed he had blood running out of his
[13:52] nose and it wasn't a real muddy spot
[13:56] hadn't rained here for like two weeks
[13:57] and it had sprinkled that morning but it
[14:01] wasn't real muddy there was no mud on
[14:02] his face but he had all the grass all
[14:06] matted up on his face and everything you
[14:08] could see that the lines of the grass
[14:09] and the seeds on him and his face was
[14:12] just his skull and everything was just
[14:14] very it was disfigured and I said Silas
[14:18] go that way and I was I was being very
[14:22] loud because I had the tractor
[14:23] I believe the tractor was still running
[14:25] I killed the tractor I I jumped off the
[14:28] tractor and he was trying to get up back
[14:30] over there and I just ran back and I
[14:32] grabbed him up in my arms and I picked
[14:35] him up in my arms and I grabbed his foot
[14:37] cuz I could tell his foot had been hit
[14:38] and I I just screaming out to God I was
[14:42] like God he got to help us and little
[14:45] as he was in a lot of pain he was
[14:47] squirming and he screamed for the first
[14:51] time and they don't the only thing he
[14:54] said was Lord heal me he just screamed
[14:58] Lord heal me and he just kept saying it
[15:00] over and over again as I I started
[15:02] running back to the house as hard as I
[15:06] could and I was just just holding
[15:09] holding them to me and I kept saying
[15:10] Lord Lord you gotta help us Lord and I
[15:13] kept crying out to the Lord and I'm
[15:16] making it about halfway up it's probably
[15:17] about 200 yards I made it about 200
[15:20] yards up and just the Lord he just the
[15:23] Holy Spirit moved down and I started to
[15:26] cry and I couldn't scream out to the
[15:29] Lord anymore I just was trying to pray
[15:31] and little Silas just quit squirmin he
[15:34] quit screaming he quit everything he
[15:36] just started he just kind of just
[15:38] started hugging me and he at that point
[15:40] he tried to you kept trying to look at
[15:43] his foot and I was holding his foot up
[15:45] as I was carrying him and I wouldn't let
[15:47] him look at his foot I kept I said just
[15:49] hold me Silas and it was so precious
[15:53] because the Holy Spirit just moved down
[15:55] I started weeping and that's little
[15:57] Silas he just it was just the Lord he
[16:00] just goes dad I'm gonna be just fine
[16:04] God already went to Calvary for me now
[16:08] it just it has boosted my faith and then
[16:12] I just encouraged him I said Silas
[16:14] that's right he's the high priest of our
[16:16] confession and you just confessed that
[16:18] he went to Calvary for you you're going
[16:19] to be just fine you're going to be just
[16:21] fine that's right Silas I said the
[16:24] Lord's gonna take care of you we're
[16:25] gonna be fine of course the devil keeps
[16:27] hounding your mind with brain injuries
[16:30] all the things that go along with that
[16:31] he's trying to hand you that box the
[16:33] snakes and just just trying to reach out
[16:36] to the Lord and he just gave us the
[16:38] faith to accept his healing nothing was
[16:41] going to be wrong with him he was going
[16:42] to be fine I almost made it to a gate
[16:44] over here I'm getting close to that gate
[16:48] and getting up to the house and I called
[16:51] my wife and I was up at the house with
[16:54] the other three children when I got a
[16:56] phone call from Phillip
[16:58] and when I answered he was very frantic
[17:03] and he just was saying get a hold of
[17:06] brother Joseph right now call brother
[17:08] Joseph and ask him to pray and then call
[17:11] 9-1-1 and so I started getting a little
[17:14] worried and I hung up the phone and then
[17:17] I just dialed him right back because I I
[17:19] didn't even know what to tell brother
[17:21] Joseph I figured he must have had some
[17:23] sort of accident on the tractor so I
[17:26] called him back and I said Philip what
[17:27] do you want me to say and he said just
[17:29] get a hold of brother Joseph so I hung
[17:31] up the phone and I I opened the back
[17:33] door to see where two of the kids were
[17:35] and they were up by the house and I just
[17:37] told him pray for Silas and brother
[17:41] Joseph picked up the phone and I just
[17:43] told him what I knew that Philip had
[17:45] been in the back field on the tractor
[17:47] with the bush hog and Silas was with him
[17:49] and that he told me to call you and pray
[17:52] for Silas and he told me that he would
[17:55] go to prayer right then and as I got off
[17:58] the phone with with brother Joseph I
[18:00] could hear Philips voice at that point I
[18:02] was almost to the gate I was getting
[18:04] through that gate over there and and i
[18:07] called 9-1-1 and i told him that i had
[18:09] ran over my son with the tractor and a
[18:11] bush hog and so I went to the door and
[18:13] opened a and and I saw him with Silas
[18:17] and my first reaction was like he looked
[18:20] like he was ok but I was wondering if he
[18:22] was unconscious because of how still he
[18:24] was there was just perfectly calm and
[18:26] but I notice Silas was moving and
[18:29] responding and he seemed normal and his
[18:33] his head looked a little discolored like
[18:36] something had happened you know and and
[18:37] his foot
[18:39] I could tell was gashed open pretty good
[18:41] but so Philip brought him in and you
[18:45] know was just calling out to the Lord
[18:46] and we all were at that point and and I
[18:49] I made it into the house and I took
[18:50] Silas and I laid him down on the couch
[18:52] after I hung up with 911 they got my
[18:54] address and they said help was on the
[18:55] way I laid him down on the couch and my
[18:59] wife had sent the kids out and I got got
[19:02] they're laying out on the couch and I
[19:05] believe she was just like there what's
[19:08] wrong with them I'm like honey I ran
[19:10] over his head with the tractor
[19:12] and I'm sitting there looking at his
[19:13] head and I'm going that ain't the same
[19:14] head that was out there cuz I head out
[19:17] there was mashed it wasn't ever flat but
[19:20] it was just it was disfigured and just
[19:25] looking at his head and he had a ridge
[19:28] on the side of his head where the the
[19:29] tractor Ridge where he was stuck
[19:32] underneath there went right across the
[19:33] temple of his his head right across at
[19:36] the bottom of his jaw and and the other
[19:39] side just had some capillaries that
[19:41] burst that he had some red spots on his
[19:43] face and that's all it was wrong with
[19:45] his head it was just just so so precious
[19:49] you know what I mean the Lord had moved
[19:51] on the scene already so while we were
[19:53] there and the paramedics were kind of
[19:55] assessing him they they said that he was
[19:57] cut all the way through on his foot and
[20:00] they were just trying to keep him really
[20:01] still because of his head and they put
[20:04] like a collar around his neck to keep
[20:06] his neck still and they told us they
[20:09] were gonna be taking him in then in the
[20:10] ambulance and then they said they were
[20:13] gonna go ahead and fly in a helicopter
[20:14] so Silas was worried concerned he wanted
[20:17] to make sure I could ride with him and
[20:20] but that was the only thing he was
[20:22] really bothered about through the whole
[20:23] thing they would ask him are you hurting
[20:26] is anything wrong and he would just say
[20:27] well my foots kind of hurting a little
[20:29] bit you know and so so they they were
[20:35] able to load him up into the ambulance
[20:36] and they drove them out to the
[20:37] helicopter which landed in the
[20:39] neighbor's yard
[20:40] and they loaded him up and as they were
[20:43] asking him questions and everything he
[20:45] was just acting completely normal just
[20:47] really calm anytime they asked him to to
[20:51] do anything physically whether it was
[20:53] squeeze their hands or whatever it was
[20:54] he was just completely just doing
[20:58] whatever they asked and so when we
[21:00] landed and they took us in in the
[21:02] hospital there were just people rushing
[21:04] around assessing him and everything and
[21:06] and the one doctor came up to me and
[21:11] yeah I was just kind of standing there
[21:12] and and he said well the reason
[21:15] everyone's rushing around we're just
[21:16] assessing him and everything and he said
[21:18] but really he said I'm not I'm not
[21:20] gravely worried about
[21:21] and he's acting really good he looks
[21:23] really good the doctor he came over and
[21:26] he said well I need to let a few other
[21:29] people look at it the radiologists and
[21:30] things he said but as far as I can see
[21:33] there is nothing wrong with his head
[21:35] everything everything looks fine he said
[21:39] I'm gonna let some other people look at
[21:40] it but I'm not I don't see anything
[21:44] through the whole thing he was
[21:46] completely calm and he never he never
[21:49] cried which I thought was really strange
[21:53] because he's normally reacts in even
[21:56] small situations so then later that
[21:59] night the specialist finally came and
[22:01] looked at his foot and at first they had
[22:03] told us well his foot is more of a crush
[22:05] injury so I'm not sure what the
[22:07] specialist is gonna want to do whether
[22:08] it's gonna be surgery or or what he
[22:11] decides and so when a specialist finally
[22:13] came in and he said well there are a few
[22:16] fractures he said but the bones are
[22:18] really in the right place I just I think
[22:20] I'm just gonna leave him alone and just
[22:21] let him heal up on their own and put a
[22:23] few stitches in so by the next day it
[22:26] was less than 24 hours later when they
[22:27] discharged us the final specialist that
[22:30] came in to to say okay Silas is good to
[22:34] go home he said the thing we're really
[22:36] gonna watch right now is we just want to
[22:38] make sure that no infection gets in the
[22:39] cuts you know now after having your
[22:41] little boy run over by a tractor an
[22:43] infection in the cut so we thought you
[22:45] know the Lord can take care of that I'm
[22:46] not even worried so Silas has been been
[22:50] acting great and the hardest thing has
[22:53] been keeping him stills to let his foot
[22:56] heal but we're just so thankful for the
