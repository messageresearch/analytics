[42:23] ministers
[42:24] be critical of yourself
[42:27] amen I could pray and we could dismiss
[42:31] and that would be enough words
[42:34] that would be enough word to for the
[42:37] rest of the day and the rest of the week
[42:41] just so that we can uh we would live
[42:44] this
[42:46] we know a lot but we don't but but it's
[42:49] hard to live things
[42:53] investigate yourself investigation
[42:55] system this is what the word is telling
[42:57] us
[42:58] investigate yourself
[43:01] inspect yourself inspection and when you
[43:04] do
[43:05] you'll find out you don't have time to
[43:10] investigate your neighbors
[43:13] I'm telling you the truth this morning
[43:16] you would examine yourself
[43:20] you would not have time to examine
[43:22] nobody else
[43:25] let's be honest with ourselves how many
[43:27] want to be honest with yourself
[43:29] you know it's kind of funny when you're
[43:32] talking to people
[43:33] and then they say now can I be honest
[43:36] with you
[43:38] and it's like well were you not honest
[43:41] with me before
[43:52] how far are we willing to walk with the
[43:56] Lord
[44:01] to look within yourself
[44:05] are we willing to go any further with
[44:08] our relationship with God estamos is
[44:12] let me see if is there any hands
[44:15] it's because it's easy to raise your
[44:18] hands just so everybody else is doing it
[44:21] I want to be left out
[44:23] are we willing to go further with our
[44:26] relationships
[44:28] let me see how many here are willing to
[44:31] um
[44:32] once again you got to be honest with
[44:35] yourself
[44:36] because there's times that we know okay
[44:40] this is
[44:42] like I just can't go on anymore
[44:45] anybody here
[44:47] I tell you I've been there before
[44:50] and and we say yes but there's always
[44:53] something that hinders us
[44:56] I want you to listen closely this
[44:59] morning
[45:00] there's always something that hinders us
[45:04] and that something is fear yes though we
[45:09] can act tough okay
[45:11] we're gonna do it
[45:14] many times it's fear that hinders us
[45:17] from going any further
[45:21] cause of the fear yeah is the more we we
[45:24] many times stay in the same place for
[45:27] years
[45:29] am I talking to anybody here
[45:33] five years ten years it's the same thing
[45:37] yes same routine
[45:41] raise your hands
[45:48] same thing over and over and over again
[45:51] and you wonder how can am I getting any
[45:54] further with the Lord
[45:59] what's this fear things
[46:03] what is this fear really
[46:07] I want you to ask yourself that question
[46:10] and you do that right now
[46:12] fear that hinders me
[46:16] I'm going to tell you what it is
[46:19] that will go no further with God
[46:24] till we're ready to pay a greater price
[46:31] are you with me once again we fear that
[46:35] what is it going to cost me
[46:39] what's the price I've gotta pay to get
[46:42] further with God
[46:45] as I said before
[46:48] if it's taken a sacrifice to get where
[46:52] we're at
[46:54] how much more a greater sacrifice
[47:01] because if we don't pay a greater price
[47:08] we're going to do what they say why
[47:19] because we don't want it to get harder
[47:25] oh come on now come on now
[47:28] you know even if you don't agree with me
[47:30] that's okay
[47:32] I've been around a little while

[49:46] a greater price
[49:48] a sacrifice you've got to make
[49:52] Jesus Christ paid the price
[49:55] he has paid the price of redemption
[49:59] but there's also a price that we pay
[50:03] so that we can take Redemption to the
[50:07] world
[50:08] he would say walk where I've walked
[50:12] growing up I would see the sacrifices
[50:15] that our founding Pastor would make
[50:19] the price that he would pay
[50:22] in order to have a Ministry that produce
[50:25] something
[50:28] sacrifices necessary
[50:31] to be in a position
[50:34] we will see more Revelations
[50:39] how many of you want more revelation
[50:44] are you in a position to receive it is
[50:49] if you watch TV all day long
[50:52] then we go go to bed and our Lord show
[50:55] me a dream give me a vision give me
[50:58] something
[51:00] sacrificed
[51:02] you haven't prepared yourself
[51:06] what kind of vision you want
[51:11] right I saw the sacrifices that my
[51:14] mother and father made
[51:17] in order to raise children in the
[51:20] admonition of the Lord
[51:23] early on is when I I figured it out
[51:29] that there was no shortcuts
[51:33] have a life worthy of the Gospel
[51:37] I'm going to say it again there are no
[51:40] shortcuts
[51:44] are you with me say it again there are
[51:47] no shortcuts
[51:49] to having a life worthy of the Gospel
[51:54] when you try to raise your children
[51:56] right
[51:58] what do the children say
[52:00] wait till I grow up
[52:03] I ain't gonna make my children go to
[52:06] church
[52:08] that happened in here
[52:11] I ain't gonna I ain't gonna raise my
[52:14] children the way my parents raised me
[52:17] but the moment
[52:19] instead of stopping
[52:22] and seeing the product
[52:25] and saying I want that it is I want that
[52:29] for my children
[52:31] oh no we have a better way of doing
[52:33] things nowadays
[52:36] making them twofold Childs of Hell
[52:39] everybody
[52:43] you're going to do it your way
[52:49] that's God's way
[52:52] let's go on with this message he with me
[52:56] okay we're putting a foundation here
[52:59] fundamento they don't raise their
[53:02] children
[53:03] teaching them what it is to sacrifice
[53:09] and therefore nowadays this new
[53:13] generation doesn't know anything about
[53:15] sacrifice
[53:26] an airfryer ninja ninjas no I'm not here
[53:32] I'm not here to promote ninja
[53:35] good stuff though
[53:38] ninja yes
[53:43] there you go
[53:46] oh no this is now they don't know
[53:48] anything about sacrifice
[53:51] you know why because because the parents
[53:54] don't teach them anything about cells
[53:55] serious
[54:07] I got some I I gotta filter through
[54:10] these thoughts
[54:12] I really enjoyed brother brother warumo

[56:35] enchilada dinners yes
[56:38] I would go trading my vehicle
[56:42] I didn't have to make the payments
[56:44] so I could use that money to go on a
[56:47] trip
[56:48] it was instilled in me that's my heart
[56:52] I'm willing to make a sacrifice
[56:55] to leave where I was at at home
[56:59] and to come here to Las Cruces
[57:02] we were born and we were showed what it
[57:06] was to make a sacrifice

[58:33] work
[58:36] how you're going to pay your bills huh
[58:39] yeah yeah there's a responsibility then
[58:42] a responsibility it's a sacrifice comes
[58:45] with this is
[58:47] going to hear tapes and read books
[58:50] read the Bible to strengthen our Inner
[58:53] Man
[58:56] now all we care about is the outer man
[59:01] oh we're into ice baths
[59:05] I've been to some ice baths
[59:08] I'm not knocking that what I knock is
[59:11] that when that becomes more important
[59:13] than the spiritual
[59:17] there's a young man the other day
[59:21] are you going to say where I was at
[59:23] because I'll give him up
[59:26] in the mirror and he was just relaxing

[59:55] do you put in your spirit
[59:59] most important of all
[1:00:02] come on why we don't have strength to
[1:00:06] conceive the seeds
[1:00:09] spiritual man has no strength
[1:00:13] says if your spiritual man came out
[1:00:18] that would be weaker than the broth of
[1:00:21] the shadow of a chicken that's half
[1:00:22] starved
[1:00:26] is that right
[1:00:28] amen come on how strong is your internet
[1:00:33] inspect yourself
[1:00:36] are you with me just still put in the
[1:00:39] foundation fundamental
[1:00:43] yeah there are no clock today so we
[1:00:45] don't care
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:50] I Dreamed a few nights back
[1:00:53] I was looking at a
[1:00:55] certain lady in the car Mirage
[1:00:59] in my dream I
[1:01:01] I knew that it was the church
[1:01:04] he was typing the church
[1:01:09] there was a man that was asking her to
[1:01:18] and I saw that that lady and I just
[1:01:22] I said don't you dare gold
[1:01:26] I don't know which which of you are
[1:01:28] struggling
[1:01:30] sometimes we don't know maybe we should
[1:01:32] go maybe we should leave maybe we should
[1:01:34] whatever I don't know
[1:01:37] but I looked at her and I and I I shook
[1:01:40] my head and I said don't you dare this
[1:01:44] this woman looked back at me and says
[1:01:49] you want to have some fun
[1:01:54] anybody here
[1:01:56] looking to have some fun
[1:02:00] don't take you nowhere
[1:02:02] it'll take you to death
[1:02:05] notice this now Romans 6 17 Romano says
[1:02:09] we begin to unfold let the Holy Spirit
[1:02:12] unfold this message to you
[1:02:15] when you have it you can say Amen
[1:02:19] but God be thanked
[1:02:22] huh I like that
[1:02:26] but God be thanked Emperor gracias that
[1:02:31] ye were the Servants of sins
[1:02:41] that form of Doctrine
[1:02:45] which was delivered to you which was the
[1:02:48] which was delivered to you
[1:02:52] I want you to take note to this the form
[1:02:56] of Doctrine
[1:02:59] every Doctrine
[1:03:25] watch how tremendous this is
[1:03:28] this form of Doctrine is what forms you
[1:03:31] into the stature of a perfect man
[1:03:36] our founding Pastor said this
[1:03:39] I suppose that the only way to preach
[1:03:43] this gospel
[1:03:44] is to give it the way it was given to us
[1:03:51] I like that one
[1:03:56] the only way to preach this gospel is
[1:04:00] to give it the way it was given to us
[1:04:05] the way it was delivered to us
[1:04:09] any alterations
[1:04:11] will hurt you and will hurt me
[1:04:15] this form of Doctrine is
[1:04:18] the only thing that can form you and I
[1:04:21] is
[1:04:23] into the stature of a perfect man
[1:04:28] this is the reason that people cannot
[1:04:30] follow today is
[1:04:32] it because of the form of doctrine that
[1:04:35] they've been given is
[1:04:42] praise the Lord
[1:04:44] when it comes to that form
[1:04:48] it becomes hard
[1:04:51] and instead of going full
[1:05:26] to abandon the faith
[1:05:30] we say all that God was he poured into
[1:05:33] Christ
[1:05:35] all that Christ was he poured into the
[1:05:38] church
[1:05:39] and all we think about is oh signs and
[1:05:43] wonders and miracles
[1:05:45] that's not all that was in Christ
[1:05:50] all that was in Christ
[1:05:53] the form of Doctrine
[1:05:56] he delivered to the church
[1:06:01] how many got the package
[1:06:06] UPS
[1:06:08] well Uncle once said right hello was it
[1:06:11] UPS that delivered
[1:06:13] DirectX FedEx or we'll see it was once
[1:06:17] delivered to the Saints
[1:06:18] notice this now we end up fighting
[1:06:22] against God
[1:06:25] I was telling a brother the other day
[1:06:28] so I can be honest with you
[1:06:32] I said as a younger as a young Minister
[1:06:35] coven
[1:06:37] one of my greatest fears
[1:06:40] was seen all that my father went through
[1:06:44] as a minister as a pastor
[1:06:48] I always carry that in the back part of
[1:06:51] my mind
[1:06:53] it was hard to see things
[1:06:57] and I would ask myself the question
[1:07:00] as I would see what he's what he would
[1:07:02] go through
[1:07:05] friends abandoning him Amigos not all
[1:07:09] friends I said some friends
[1:07:15] it cost him his wife Esposa
[1:07:20] it cost him his health
[1:07:22] it cost him so many things and I would
[1:07:26] ask the question
[1:07:28] am I willing to pay that kind of price
[1:07:31] is
[1:07:35] what a question that we we should ask
[1:07:37] ourselves
[1:07:38] and you see the Lord just working in in
[1:07:42] his ministries
[1:07:44] and I would say
[1:07:46] okay I got a walk where he walked this
[1:07:49] is
[1:07:57] a young Minister I would say
[1:07:59] I don't know
[1:08:01] I don't know I'm gonna stand up here and
[1:08:04] say oh yeah I'll pay it
[1:08:07] Jesus Jesus went to the father three
[1:08:12] times
[1:08:13] and said father if it is
[1:08:23] but nevertheless
[1:08:25] not my will but thy will be done
[1:08:29] he was willing to pay a greater price
[1:08:33] are we willing to pay that kind of price
[1:08:37] are we willing to give our life
[1:08:41] that somebody could live
[1:08:45] I say this again and I've said it many
[1:08:47] times and it just hits me so so
[1:08:50] tremendously
[1:08:52] when the Asus Revival I gotta say it
[1:08:57] again in the Azusa Revival
[1:08:59] they would they would send missionaries
[1:09:02] then
[1:09:03] to Africa Africa and they were dying
[1:09:07] by the dozens
[1:09:10] dying from malaria from yellow fever is
[1:09:15] the malaria as I said before the first
[1:09:19] thing we do with our with our with our
[1:09:21] minds
[1:09:24] I guess it wasn't the will of God
[1:09:28] died over there it wasn't the will of
[1:09:30] God
[1:09:35] you know how they thought when they said
[1:09:38] the brothers that were sent they died
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:46] [Applause]
[1:10:23] I just don't feel like going oh no thank
[1:10:25] God
[1:10:28] if you put your hand to the plow and
[1:10:30] turn back you're not even words
[1:10:38] are you with me all right all right
[1:10:42] we're getting to the core of things
[1:10:43] right
[1:10:45] I like I like where we're at notices
[1:10:52] I don't know was my answer
[1:10:54] is
[1:10:56] Jesus can one of my sons
[1:10:59] sit on your right and the other one on
[1:11:01] the left Jesus
[1:11:05] and they drink of the same cup
[1:11:10] it's a bitter cup
[1:11:12] can they drink from the same cup
[1:11:19] they will drink of it he was sure about
[1:11:22] that
[1:11:23] they will drink from it
[1:11:25] like it or not you follow me you're
[1:11:28] gonna drink from that cup she says
[1:11:30] but
[1:11:32] to sit on my right and my left has
[1:11:35] always already been given
[1:11:38] what happens that
[1:11:40] that changes your mentality
[1:11:45] and I pray that you get this is
[1:11:48] fearful
[1:11:50] could I even pay that price
[1:11:53] I don't know but then something happens
[1:11:57] change my mentality towards this
[1:12:01] come on church because the problem is is
[1:12:04] we're always looking at all the negative
[1:12:06] things that can happen
[1:12:09] you know what happened
[1:12:12] I fell more in love with Jesus
[1:12:16] and I fell so much in love with him
[1:12:20] that my focus wasn't on what I have to
[1:12:23] go through
[1:12:25] my focus was now how can I please
[1:12:29] I don't want to do anything else in this
[1:12:32] world
[1:12:33] I want to please God
[1:12:36] I want to have the strength
[1:12:39] to produce
[1:12:56] if he would have known everything he was
[1:12:59] going to have to go
[1:13:03] I don't think so
[1:13:05] it's a little at a time
[1:13:08] a little a little next thing you know
[1:13:10] you've grown and you can handle more
[1:13:17] watches this unfold is this message
[1:13:19] something
[1:13:23] begins to pull on you
[1:13:27] that's what's called the third pool
[1:13:30] something is pulling on you
[1:13:33] people don't understand the pools
[1:13:37] the pool is like a contest
[1:13:43] that's what a pool is it's like a
[1:13:45] contest it's okay
[1:13:47] and many of them as long as Jesus was
[1:13:50] Healing The Sick
[1:13:53] the church was packed
[1:13:55] Miracles happening in the church
[1:14:00] but he barely got to the second pool
[1:14:04] and he says if you don't eat my flesh or
[1:14:07] drink my blood
[1:14:09] you have no part with me
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:21] much less the third
[1:14:24] they didn't even get there
[1:14:27] it's pulling it's
[1:14:30] pulling there
[1:14:32] and the pulling is for one thing
[1:14:36] to pull you to a greater Revelation
[1:14:42] are you with me go he's trying to pull
[1:14:46] you to a greater Revelation is
[1:14:54] instead we're satisfied just staying
[1:14:56] down here
[1:14:59] Hebrews 6 4 says it is impossible
[1:15:04] it's impossible
[1:15:06] those who are once enlightened and
[1:15:09] tasted of the Heavenly gift
[1:15:11] on and on you can read that we've read
[1:15:13] this many times you but you can read it
[1:15:14] when you get home
[1:15:15] if they shall fall away verse six okay
[1:15:18] foreign
[1:15:39] that's a lot of people today I always
[1:15:42] came out of denominations
[1:15:46] and you're stuck at the border is
[1:15:52] why didn't they want to go any further
[1:15:55] because it was too much for them
[1:16:00] being a Christian is not for the weak
[1:16:02] and faint of Hearts
[1:16:05] if somebody tells you it's going to be a
[1:16:07] bed of roses
[1:16:18] mayor
[1:16:47] but we're stuck to say no praise the
[1:16:49] Lord
[1:16:52] of course he did and he
[1:16:55] I want to know everything I want to know
[1:16:58] the whole plan I don't know what he was
[1:17:01] thinking about me
[1:17:06] it's not about religions
[1:17:20] notice as this as this one and we're
[1:17:22] barely getting into our message
[1:17:24] the only thing that keeps us going
[1:17:28] to be a little growth huh
[1:17:35] I grew two inches
[1:17:42] we
[1:17:45] understand
[1:17:47] when we see more that's revealed
[1:17:50] it takes a sacrifice to birth children
[1:17:57] but you husband should love your wives
[1:18:07] speaking to a mother yesterday
[1:18:12] I go to church and
[1:18:14] I don't get nothing I wonder if I should
[1:18:18] just stay home
[1:18:20] no that he can know you get to church
[1:18:23] even if you don't get nothing out of it
[1:18:26] you've at least showed your children how
[1:18:29] to be in church
[1:18:32] yes all right amen teach them how to how
[1:18:36] to sacrifice
[1:18:39] how far are we willing to go
[1:18:42] 17 29 and 30.
[1:18:49] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:18:52] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:18:54] heaven and destroyed them all
[1:18:57] Sonoma
[1:19:00] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:19:03] the son of man is revealed
[1:19:08] when Jesus the son of man came did it
[1:19:11] rain fire in Brimstone
[1:19:17] no yeah no
[1:19:19] see or um
[1:19:25] what do you think
[1:19:28] okay once again when Jesus came did it
[1:19:30] rain fire in Brimstone
[1:19:33] but say like you mean
[1:19:38] oh okay okay sheesh
[1:19:42] about to pack it up here
[1:19:45] not until I finish though
[1:19:48] when the son of man is revealed
[1:19:52] he's pointing them to Something in the
[1:19:55] future
[1:19:57] we went over already
[1:20:00] the four offices of the sun right
[1:20:03] one of Abrahams son of David Son of God
[1:20:08] and they all pertain to Jesus Christ
[1:20:12] but we're going to focus on the son of
[1:20:14] man today
[1:20:17] for it to be son of man
[1:20:20] it has to be flesh
[1:20:23] and it has to be
[1:20:31] and he came in a man called Jesus
[1:20:35] Jesus and in him he was the son of man
[1:20:40] so when they crucified Jesus
[1:20:44] they did not crucify the Holy Ghost no
[1:20:47] crucified They Crucified the man
[1:20:51] because he claimed to be the Son of God
[1:20:55] the holy spirit is the Son of God in
[1:20:59] spirit forms
[1:21:04] official
[1:21:37] I want you to raise your hand if you
[1:21:38] know it I want to see how many know it
[1:21:41] now son of man is always Jesus Christ
[1:21:44] Son of God Jesus Christ
[1:21:46] son of Abraham son of David it's all
[1:21:48] Jesus Christ but there are offices
[1:21:51] and it's a different office for a
[1:21:53] different dispensation
[1:21:56] okay but once again anybody know from
[1:22:00] Ephesians Church age to the laodicean
[1:22:02] church age
[1:22:03] which of those four offices was he is
[1:22:26] right this is importante
[1:22:32] it is more important than your tablets
[1:22:35] and your phones this is
[1:22:39] trying to give life to you this morning
[1:22:43] which office was he in
[1:22:47] go ahead aloe I know you're holding back
[1:22:55] I'm going to say once again so you can
[1:22:57] understand it this way
[1:23:01] son of man
[1:23:03] has to be in flesh
[1:23:05] and has to be a prophet
[1:23:10] so was Jesus Christ in flesh and does it
[1:23:13] here through the church ages
[1:23:19] or was he in spirit
[1:23:24] you agree everybody agree then so for
[1:23:27] the church ages he was then son of Anton
[1:23:35] he was Son of God Son of God is Spirit
[1:23:40] can you give one to the youth they they
[1:23:42] worked it out
[1:23:44] all right
[1:23:46] so through the church ages he was Son of
[1:23:48] God Spirit
[1:23:51] but that's why Luke 17 30 says
[1:23:55] that there at the end he was going to
[1:23:58] reveal himself again
[1:24:05] God in flesh again
[1:24:08] oh okay but we got it now son of God
[1:24:12] through the church
[1:24:13] how many times you got to say son of God
[1:24:16] through the church
[1:24:18] but at the end of the ages I will rebuke
[1:24:23] the the last days
[1:24:25] they would come back in flesh again
[1:24:29] he promised to do that
[1:24:31] let's go on and see this now
[1:24:34] therefore the messenger of the laodice
[1:24:37] he was it was office of Son of God still
[1:24:39] is
[1:24:42] through the church ages
[1:24:46] that's right make sure we get that right
[1:24:47] all through the church
[1:24:50] but at the end of it
[1:24:53] was going to reveal himself again
[1:24:57] hold that now
[1:24:59] that's why the Pentecostals rejected the
[1:25:03] message
[1:25:06] they have to reject it
[1:25:09] because they're the ones that put Jesus
[1:25:12] outside the church
[1:25:17] but they didn't reject Jesus
[1:25:21] as son of Abraham
[1:25:24] they didn't reject him as son of David
[1:25:27] they didn't even reject Jesus as Son of
[1:25:31] God
[1:25:32] but what they rejected was Jesus in the
[1:25:36] office of son of man
[1:25:39] that's why they said we we don't need a
[1:25:43] man to teach us or to tell us anything
[1:25:46] we got the Holy Ghost
[1:25:48] we got the Son of God the holy spirit
[1:25:53] so when he changes his mask now
[1:25:57] throws himself in the office of Son of
[1:25:59] Man
[1:26:03] rejected the prophet
[1:26:06] rejected Jesus Christ right there
[1:26:10] put him outside the church
[1:26:13] okay is it making sense to you yeah
[1:26:18] make sure that we get this because all
[1:26:19] these points you gotta you gotta know
[1:26:21] these things
[1:26:22] so they rejected him as son of man
[1:26:26] because they couldn't stomach the
[1:26:29] ministry
[1:26:31] that a man from Kentucky
[1:26:36] I got degrees
[1:26:42] I've been taught under this one
[1:26:45] not an old Farmer Boy with Town Predator
[1:26:48] teach me
[1:26:51] it is
[1:26:55] foreign
[1:27:14] is coming the flesh is not past tense
[1:27:21] is coming the flesh is present tense
[1:27:24] always
[1:27:26] so these ones that do not confess
[1:27:29] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[1:27:33] this is a deceiver and an antichrist
[1:27:37] he's against the teachings
[1:27:41] showing us that he would return us
[1:27:46] scripture doesn't say that Jesus will
[1:27:49] return as Son of God
[1:27:52] it says that Jesus will return and be
[1:27:55] revealed as son of man
[1:28:00] First Corinthians 15 21.
[1:28:03] am I making sense to you
[1:28:08] we're gonna wrap it all up at the end is
[1:28:18] my man came also the resurrection of
[1:28:21] them
[1:28:22] who is this man that the resurrection of
[1:28:25] the Dead will come by foreign
[1:28:32] and you're gonna say Jesus
[1:28:34] and I'm gonna have to say Amen
[1:28:38] but now I'm going to ask you
[1:28:40] in what office is
[1:28:46] which of the four
[1:28:49] will bring the resurrection
[1:28:53] Revelations 3 17.
[1:28:55] write this down and read them when you
[1:28:58] get home
[1:28:59] because thou says I am rich
[1:29:03] with goods and have need of nothing and
[1:29:08] know us not that thou art
[1:29:13] blind foreign
[1:29:33] ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do
[1:29:35] Holy Ghost tells me what to do this is a
[1:29:39] receiver in an antichristo
[1:29:43] yes the Holy Ghost teaches us
[1:29:46] same holy ghosts
[1:29:49] the church teachers
[1:29:55] how is he teaching through the teachers
[1:30:01] John 14 Juan katorsi
[1:30:04] going a little quick on this big but
[1:30:06] because I want to get to something and
[1:30:07] something to make sure that we get to it
[1:30:11] one through three says let not your
[1:30:13] heart be troubled
[1:30:15] you believe in God believe also in me
[1:30:18] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:30:22] they were not so I would have told you
[1:30:26] I go Jesus is talking Jesus
[1:30:31] to prepare a place
[1:30:34] he's going away to prepare a place for a
[1:30:38] preparation
[1:30:40] Caleb
[1:30:41] he's going to prepare a place foreign
[1:30:59] boy and prepare a place for you
[1:31:03] I will come again
[1:31:08] he's telling you here I'm going to come
[1:31:09] back I go to prepare plays for Caleb and
[1:31:14] then I will come again
[1:31:16] and I'll receive Caleb
[1:31:19] unto myself
[1:31:21] that where I am
[1:31:24] there Caleb may be awesome
[1:31:27] what's your name
[1:31:30] all right maybe we also show me in the
[1:31:33] scriptures
[1:31:34] where he would come again
[1:31:37] in flesh as Son of God
[1:31:40] it doesn't go together
[1:31:44] it's impossible Son of God is Spirit he
[1:31:47] was going to come again as son of man
[1:31:51] that where I am
[1:31:53] where's he at
[1:31:59] you know why a lot of people don't like
[1:32:00] to come to church
[1:32:02] they don't like to be where he's at
[1:32:09] everybody's got so many excuses why I I
[1:32:12] didn't go to church because
[1:32:15] how do you think those excuses are gonna
[1:32:18] are going to help you on that day
[1:32:24] we have such some of the worst I mean if
[1:32:27] you're going to come up with an excuse
[1:32:28] come on do something better
[1:32:32] I mean you're looking at them and
[1:32:34] they're serious Brother The Amazing you
[1:32:37] must think I'm dumb okay
[1:32:43] Luke 17 37. this is and they answered
[1:32:47] and said unto him
[1:32:48] where Lord
[1:32:53] wheresoever the body is
[1:32:58] uh where is he don't understand
[1:33:01] that where I am you can be there also
[1:33:05] where Lord
[1:33:08] wherever the body is
[1:33:11] my mystical body on Earth
[1:33:14] where's where the Eagles will gather
[1:33:17] yeah
[1:33:19] you can go to any church you want
[1:33:23] they're all waiting for Jesus
[1:33:26] Methodist church this morning
[1:33:30] everybody is preaching about Jesus
[1:33:33] coming Jesus is coming
[1:33:35] because Jesus said I'll come again
[1:33:38] but what they're missing is the office
[1:33:46] they're all waiting where's Jesus reach
[1:33:51] office
[1:33:55] I like this
[1:34:00] I'll come again
[1:34:02] and when a man and a woman get the
[1:34:04] revelation of the son of man
[1:34:08] nothing will keep them
[1:34:10] nothing will keep them
[1:34:13] from where the body is
[1:34:18] Romans 8 38 says for I'm persuaded
[1:34:22] neither death nor life
[1:34:24] nor angels nor principalities
[1:34:28] more powers nor nor things present nor
[1:34:31] things to come
[1:34:35] nor any other creature
[1:34:38] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:34:41] love of God
[1:34:44] which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[1:34:48] which is in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:52] I'm going to say it again it doesn't say
[1:34:55] the love of God
[1:34:57] which is in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:01] is it which is in the anointed one of
[1:35:05] Jesus
[1:35:07] which is in the anointed one
[1:35:10] of Jesus the Jesus our lord
[1:35:17] history of the son of man
[1:35:20] that is calling us as sons of God
[1:35:24] through the adoption
[1:35:28] oh come on I'm going to say this again
[1:35:30] the ministry of the son of man
[1:35:34] that is calling us unto the adoption
[1:35:40] the office of son of man was the
[1:35:41] ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:35:46] failed in human flesh
[1:35:48] the office of a prophet when he revealed
[1:35:52] himself in our days
[1:35:54] he did so in the same manner
[1:35:58] through a prophetic Ministry
[1:36:01] Once Again Luke 17 30.
[1:36:04] it was a son of man
[1:36:07] revealing this son of man
[1:36:10] it was dear derailed in human flesh
[1:36:15] like this
[1:36:20] Ezekiel was a son of man
[1:36:23] and he ate the scroll yeah
[1:36:28] in the New Testament it's also a prophet
[1:36:33] we know who that is the seventh angels
[1:36:36] He also had the little book is
[1:36:42] seven still little book is right
[1:36:46] it is deity again today
[1:36:50] in human flesh
[1:36:53] as he revealed himself as son of man
[1:36:57] again
[1:36:59] now young people I want you to get this
[1:37:01] how many remember now the church ages he
[1:37:05] was
[1:37:07] Son of God spirit
[1:37:10] but in the end time now
[1:37:13] he was going to be son of man again
[1:37:17] he sent a man unless it's in flesh
[1:37:20] and it's a prophet is
[1:37:24] who was that Prophet
[1:37:26] we don't just say just to say it
[1:37:29] we got to know what we believe
[1:37:32] okay Matthew 24 44.
[1:37:36] therefore be also ready
[1:37:42] for in such an hour as ye think not the
[1:37:44] son of man cometh
[1:37:48] can you put that that quote of the
[1:37:51] rapture
[1:37:53] how many are enjoying themselves this
[1:37:55] morning
[1:37:57] we're feeding our inner man right now
[1:38:00] when the son of man begins to reveal
[1:38:03] himself
[1:38:05] what is revealed
[1:38:08] make his revelation of what he is in
[1:38:12] this day
[1:38:15] when the son of man begins to reveal
[1:38:17] himself
[1:38:23] okay but but who is the son of man
[1:38:27] Jesus Christ no one else when he begins
[1:38:32] to reveal
[1:38:33] begins to reveal himself
[1:38:37] what is revealed
[1:38:39] make his revelation of what he is
[1:38:45] telling you in this day
[1:38:49] in this day

[1:39:06] making that Jesus Jesus live amongst us
[1:39:12] huh

[1:39:30] and remember
[1:39:32] he was represented there yes
[1:39:36] now he's showing you something back
[1:39:39] there
[1:39:40] with Elohim and Abraham
[1:39:44] what he was represented there
[1:40:05] and she didn't believe that what was
[1:40:09] going to happen Could Happen
[1:40:13] how many of you today will say I just
[1:40:17] don't believe that what he says is going
[1:40:19] to happen is going to happen
[1:40:24] you know the problem isn't knowing that
[1:40:26] that he will have a bride
[1:40:29] the problem is is are you part of that
[1:40:32] right
[1:40:34] to a personal level
[1:40:39] are you one of the ones
[1:40:43] [Applause]

[1:41:03] believe

[1:41:12] according to the time of life
[1:41:17] and Sarah and the tent left
[1:41:22] why did Sarah laugh in the tent
[1:41:27] how can these things be
[1:41:30] remember the intellectual Church
[1:41:35] got two preachers two angels
[1:41:41] Abraham and his group Abraham is the
[1:41:45] Grupo saw God manifested in a body of
[1:41:49] human flesh
[1:41:51] so God manifested
[1:41:54] in a body of human flesh
[1:41:58] that could discern the hearts
[1:42:02] the spirits and tell Sarah what she was
[1:42:06] thinking behind him
[1:42:10] how many times did brother Brandon say
[1:42:12] that he and he mentioned this is
[1:42:15] no I'm going to turn my back to the
[1:42:17] audience
[1:42:19] and you sister you brother

[1:43:01] get into something he had some work to
[1:43:04] do on Sarah
[1:43:06] I don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:43:08] because this this is good stuff
[1:43:11] the Revelation has to
[1:43:18] con yes or yes COC the Revelation has to
[1:43:22] continue

[1:43:30] that unites the bride with the
[1:43:33] bridegroom okay
[1:43:47] in the day that the son of man will be
[1:43:50] revealed

[1:44:09] when the son of man will come down and
[1:44:13] come in human flesh
[1:44:17] to unite the two together
[1:44:21] so it's son of man Jesus Christ

[1:45:05] mad get brother Jimmy afterwards
[1:45:08] he'll take it
[1:45:11] to better understand this
[1:45:13] let's turn to Genesis 18.
[1:45:20] you can read verse 8 and he's he's
[1:45:22] eating
[1:45:23] butter milk and all this it's on my legs
[1:45:27] Jehovah in flesh
[1:45:28] eating and drinking with Abraham
[1:45:31] and they said unto him where is Sarah
[1:45:34] thy why this is verse 9.
[1:45:37] behold in the tent
[1:45:39] we could go off on the tent right now
[1:45:42] the 10 Ministry
[1:45:44] but we'll just hold off for a second and
[1:45:48] he said I will certainly return unto
[1:45:50] thee Jose
[1:45:52] he's he's telling Abraham
[1:45:55] get this closely I mean listen close
[1:45:58] pinch yourself
[1:46:00] he's telling Abraham this is Abraham I
[1:46:04] will certainly return unto thee

[1:46:14] n brother Raj
[1:46:16] I will return unto thee unless you
[1:46:21] believe that still look great all right
[1:46:23] all right that's brother Raj okay he

[1:46:39] he's like whoa
[1:46:40] what I tell my wife all the time
[1:46:43] he said I'm too old for this night
[1:46:48] Sarah was 90.
[1:46:52] and then she says
[1:46:54] but my name's not Sarah
[1:46:58] anyways going back and forth
[1:47:03] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[1:47:07] I'm waxed old and shall I have pleasure
[1:47:10] my Lord be known also it is
[1:47:13] and the Lord said I'm sorry go ahead
[1:47:16] and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore
[1:47:19] did Sarah laugh
[1:47:23] shall I have Surety bear a child which
[1:47:26] I'm old
[1:47:30] and the question arises is there any is
[1:47:33] there anything too hard for the Lord

[1:48:07] time of life
[1:48:08] Sarah shall have a son
[1:48:11] he said he would return to Abraham
[1:48:15] my question is this
[1:48:17] did he returned to Abraham before the
[1:48:23] promised son was born
[1:48:27] what a question
[1:48:32] how many of you read your Bible what is
[1:48:35] okay you can all answer this anybody
[1:48:37] wants to answer did he return to Abraham
[1:48:42] again before the promiscence
[1:48:51] give me scripture that he was
[1:49:04] this is important piece of it all is
[1:49:06] importante
[1:49:08] did he come back to to Abraham hello
[1:49:10] this is
[1:49:23] yes see he came to Sarah
[1:49:30] this is the little piece that people are
[1:49:33] leaving out today
[1:49:36] that the prophet of the age came
[1:49:40] he was the son of man revealing the son
[1:49:43] of man
[1:49:45] yes it was him in flesh Jesus Christ
[1:49:49] but there's a peace here
[1:49:53] something that has to happen
[1:49:58] it's gonna happen
[1:50:01] did he come back or return to April to
[1:50:05] Abraham
[1:50:06] yes see to his feminine Parts
[1:50:11] oh come on I'm gonna say it again back
[1:50:15] to his feminine part
[1:50:17] he is Mrs Abraham
[1:50:20] he is part of Abraham
[1:50:25] you don't believe me let me let's read
[1:50:28] it so you can believe me you don't hear
[1:50:30] after that chapter 18 Till Genesis 21.
[1:50:38] and the Lord
[1:50:40] visited
[1:50:43] something good here at the end now and
[1:50:46] the Lord visited
[1:50:51] you know
[1:50:54] and the Lord
[1:50:55] did unto Sarah
[1:50:58] he had spoken
[1:51:02] if you ever want to see the seventh seal
[1:51:05] in Genesis
[1:51:07] this is the secret Church secret oh if
[1:51:11] you could that the impact of the
[1:51:13] Revelation right now
[1:51:14] this is the secret of the Seven Seals
[1:51:17] this is
[1:51:21] he will produce the promised son
[1:51:26] but nobody else knows
[1:51:28] the church world don't know
[1:51:33] and how does he give it the Lord
[1:51:38] foreign
[1:51:49] and Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a
[1:51:54] son in his old age
[1:51:58] at the set time of which God had spoken
[1:52:01] to him
[1:52:08] and a true sign overlooked is a prophet
[1:52:13] and we saw how that the son of man was
[1:52:16] revealed again
[1:52:18] but there was one last thing
[1:52:23] we say the last sign before the promised
[1:52:26] son comes
[1:52:36] but there's still one more thing
[1:52:39] Church get this there's still one more
[1:52:42] thing
[1:52:44] come on
[1:52:46] the Lord has to visit you
[1:52:50] this is where it's at right now please
[1:52:53] understand this is the grain of the
[1:52:54] message
[1:52:56] because for years we have heard the
[1:52:59] message of the hours
[1:53:01] it's good seeds
[1:53:06] went forth sowing seeds
[1:53:11] and we receive that seeds
[1:53:14] my question is
[1:53:16] through the whole time
[1:53:18] those are you you're adults so get it
[1:53:20] right
[1:53:22] was Abraham giving good seeds
[1:53:26] maybe at some point up
[1:53:31] maybe he ended up drying up
[1:53:33] but there was always trying to try her
[1:53:36] trying to get to get pregnant after that
[1:53:39] God promised them
[1:53:42] we have heard this message inside and
[1:53:45] out
[1:53:47] we have heard Apostles and Prophets and
[1:53:49] teachers and evangelists and pastors
[1:53:54] and what has come forth is
[1:54:00] and people say well I listen to messages
[1:54:04] and I pray and nothing changed I read
[1:54:07] the Bible nothing changes
[1:54:13] the Lord visited Sarah
[1:54:16] when you can receive that
[1:54:20] no and recognize we have received seeds
[1:54:25] but you need a visitation
[1:54:29] something Supernatural
[1:54:32] activate
[1:54:35] form your womb foreign
[1:54:52] you need the supernatural to happen
[1:54:56] I've been hearing and hearing Goods pray
[1:54:59] for a visitation visited
[1:55:08] that was the last visit before the
[1:55:11] promise
[1:55:19] can I go just a little bit more
[1:55:22] just a little bit more
[1:55:27] Sarah had to be restored
[1:55:30] in order to produce the Sun
[1:55:35] when I see these things
[1:55:37] in order for the final part of the story
[1:55:45] is
[1:55:50] God needs you and me
[1:55:56] ah
[1:56:05] he needs the female part to manifest
[1:56:07] neces
[1:56:09] to or to bring the promised son
[1:56:13] this will be the finality of the Seven
[1:56:16] Seals
[1:56:18] you say brother the seven seal is the
[1:56:21] coming of Christ amen
[1:56:25] amen
[1:56:28] but it's not just about the coming of
[1:56:31] Christ
[1:56:33] what good is the coming of Christ
[1:56:37] if we don't know if who he's coming
[1:56:39] foreign
[1:56:50] visitation
[1:57:10] well let me see
[1:57:12] it was supposed to come in 1989.
[1:57:16] in the 90s
[1:57:22] remember that one
[1:57:24] Mayan calendar
[1:57:40] he's already visited
[1:57:45] [Music]
[1:57:47] secret Church
[1:57:52] they're looking for Son of God foreign
[1:58:16] amen amen now how excited is he
[1:58:21] I'm coming for my bride
[1:58:24] we talk about excited
[1:58:29] that's why he spoke more about his
[1:58:32] second coming than his first foreign
[1:58:58] that's my best
[1:59:02] watch this
[1:59:04] it wasn't Abraham this time
[1:59:07] it was his wife Sarah
[1:59:10] she was the one that needed a visitation
[1:59:14] in order for the promised son to come
[1:59:19] she's the one that needed a visitation
[1:59:22] she kind of laughed
[1:59:28] I don't know
[1:59:30] Rio
[1:59:33] not me yes you did
[1:59:37] because sometimes we have that attitude
[1:59:40] be part of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:59:44] how can that be
[1:59:50] why not working now
[1:59:53] can you see the visitation
[1:59:55] to Sarah asada is the seventh Secret is
[2:00:01] he said he would write it in the hearts
[2:00:04] of the building
[2:00:09] what was he riding in that heart
[2:00:12] the Bible is full of types and shadows
[2:00:16] you want to find out one of these days
[2:00:19] there was always written there um
[2:00:22] I'll write it in the hearts what those
[2:00:25] seven Thunders uttered
[2:00:28] we don't know the conversation that he
[2:00:31] had with her
[2:00:33] until he has that conversation with you
[2:00:39] [Music]
[2:00:50] and when he visited Sarah
[2:00:56] conceivio
[2:00:57] hmm
[2:00:59] she went from laughing in her heart yes
[2:01:03] to having
[2:01:05] faith
[2:01:07] that would bring her change
[2:01:11] and the womb is that could hold the
[2:01:14] seeds
[2:01:15] yesterday
[2:01:19] she's the one that needed the visitation
[2:01:23] completion of the Gentile dispensation
[2:01:27] the completion of the Gentile
[2:01:29] dispensation
[2:01:34] is the completion of the promise as
[2:01:37] Lucas
[2:01:40] it is the perfecting of the word bride
[2:01:42] Perfection
[2:01:44] so let's let's do this out just give me
[2:01:47] about 10 minutes and then I'll let you
[2:01:48] go
[2:01:52] Hebrews 11 11. evidence
[2:02:05] to her faith
[2:02:07] being risen
[2:02:09] to a level that she had never knew
[2:02:12] before
[2:02:14] the Bible says Hebrews 11 11 that
[2:02:16] through faith also this is
[2:02:21] herself Sarah
[2:02:24] la mis Masada
[2:02:26] receive strength to conceive seed let's
[2:02:29] leave your food
[2:02:31] that is the subtitle of my message
[2:02:34] by faith for Faith she receives strength
[2:02:38] you know what strength is
[2:02:44] she received Dynamite
[2:02:48] she received power this is
[2:02:58] we're good church members
[2:03:06] but until the visitation happens
[2:03:09] that's when there will be a change
[2:03:13] a faith that'll Reigns
[2:03:19] she receives strength to conceive this
[2:03:22] is
[2:03:24] and was delivered of a child when she
[2:03:27] was past age
[2:03:31] because she judged him
[2:03:37] who had promiseda
[2:03:43] we've been hearing this message for
[2:03:45] years
[2:03:46] but I know
[2:03:49] many of us need a visitation
[2:03:55] it's what gives you Faith to conceive
[2:03:57] the seeds
[2:04:02] the Liberty sins were blind
[2:04:05] because they did not recognize the hour
[2:04:09] of their visitation
[2:04:12] and the message God's provided
[2:04:16] the church will come through
[2:04:18] justification
[2:04:20] to Luther through sanctification through
[2:04:23] Wesley certification
[2:04:33] and we'll go right on into the
[2:04:36] Perfection of the son of man perfection
[2:04:45] into the Perfection of the son of man
[2:04:47] Allah perfection
[2:05:04] when does
[2:05:06] the Perfection of the son of man happen
[2:05:10] when husband and wife
[2:05:13] will be the self-same personas persona
[2:05:19] say it again I gotta say it again when
[2:05:23] will the Perfection of the son of man
[2:05:24] come
[2:05:26] this is in God's Own God's provided
[2:05:29] place of worship
[2:05:31] that when husband and wife
[2:05:34] be the self same
[2:05:38] Persona God will be so manifested in his
[2:05:41] bride
[2:05:43] in his church till they will both be the
[2:05:48] same
[2:05:49] they are one so no no now you see where
[2:05:53] we're at
[2:05:55] show is the father
[2:05:59] be with me so long
[2:06:02] you still say show us the father
[2:06:08] why is it the same if you've seen his
[2:06:12] bride you've seen him
[2:06:14] they're the self same
[2:06:17] Persona why was Adam given a bride
[2:06:20] foreign
[2:06:43] produce himself
[2:06:47] produce something else
[2:06:51] Galatians 4 19 my little children
[2:06:55] of whom I travail in birth again
[2:07:00] until
[2:07:01] Christ be formed in you
[2:07:13] she must come into His very image
[2:07:17] in his
[2:07:20] likenessa she must reproduce the son of
[2:07:23] man again
[2:07:26] and we need the faith to conceive that
[2:07:29] is
[2:07:37] sure without the seventh angel
[2:07:40] we wouldn't know what it would be for
[2:07:42] the son of man to be revealed again
[2:07:47] all we would know is Jesus Christ of
[2:07:49] yesterday
[2:07:52] but Ephesians tells us and we can and I
[2:07:55] I don't want to read it to save time
[2:07:58] he descended and and above and then
[2:08:01] ascended up into Heavens
[2:08:03] that he might feel all things
[2:08:06] he gave his Apostles and all this for
[2:08:08] the Perfection of the Saints
[2:08:11] Souls that are in prison now three years
[2:08:15] Perfection
[2:08:16] the ministry come to its Perfection
[2:08:20] when it reproduced Christ again
[2:08:25] amongst human beings as we're predicted
[2:08:50] and donde
[2:08:53] brother you're out of your mind
[2:08:55] yeah I think so see
[2:09:00] it was through the form of Doctrine
[2:09:04] this bride under the seventh seal is
[2:09:08] will bring him to Earth again
[2:09:12] in what form in que Forma in bright
[2:09:15] forms
[2:09:22] okay
[2:09:23] I'm just going to show you I'm not that
[2:09:25] I'm not making things up
[2:09:38] continue in Spanish not today oh you
[2:09:41] know
[2:09:42] in The Invisible Union of the bride of
[2:09:45] Christ
[2:09:46] what is it just exactly like the same
[2:09:50] grain that went in the ground
[2:09:54] the same Jesus
[2:09:58] the Same power same church same thing
[2:10:04] the same word now I have heard but now I
[2:10:08] see
[2:10:09] but but the wheat has come up through
[2:10:12] here
[2:10:14] and now it's begin to form in the bride
[2:10:18] forms
[2:10:20] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:10:23] but all that Christ was he poured into
[2:10:26] the church
[2:10:28] then the Bride is a further revelation
[2:10:31] of himself
[2:10:35] just get this last part
[2:10:39] pinch yourself
[2:10:41] your neighborhood
[2:10:49] Ultimate Party
[2:10:52] she is a further revelation of himself
[2:10:57] and this is the end time revelation of
[2:11:00] himself
[2:11:02] and she's a further revelation of it
[2:11:06] watch what he says in the exposition
[2:11:09] the New Testament does not reveal
[2:11:12] another God
[2:11:15] it's a farther revelation of this one
[2:11:18] and same God continue
[2:11:21] Christ did not come down to make himself
[2:11:24] known
[2:11:26] he did not come to reveal the son
[2:11:30] he came to reveal and make known the
[2:11:33] father
[2:11:35] he never talked about two Gods he talks
[2:11:39] about one God and now in this last age
[2:11:44] we have come back to the Capstone
[2:11:47] Revelation
[2:11:50] Revelation the most important revelation
[2:11:53] of godhead
[2:11:56] in the whole Bible
[2:11:58] is Jesus Is God
[2:12:01] he and the father are one
[2:12:05] there is one God and his name is the
[2:12:09] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:11] what did Abraham call him
[2:12:14] Elohim God manifested in flesh
[2:12:17] Jesus showing that he himself Jesus
[2:12:22] will be manifested in his bride
[2:12:25] manifestation in the last days now I'm
[2:12:29] I'm going to close with this now
[2:12:31] watch the furtherance of the Revelation
[2:12:34] now
[2:12:35] Revelation the furtherance of the
[2:12:38] Revelation
[2:12:41] the son of man Jesus Christ
[2:12:44] we can see the son of man Jesus Christ
[2:12:47] rebuilding a prophet Jesus Christ in
[2:12:50] flesh
[2:12:52] Travis but it didn't stop there
[2:12:56] because the message
[2:12:59] is a prophetic message
[2:13:03] and the message and the messenger are
[2:13:06] one and the same
[2:13:08] are you with me say it again the message
[2:13:11] and the messenger are one and the same
[2:13:16] right who's the message
[2:13:23] oh come on who's the message
[2:13:31] that wasn't a profit only
[2:13:34] message and the prophet and his message
[2:13:37] are one and the same
[2:13:39] don't separate it out
[2:13:42] you have a job to do
[2:13:45] but you need strings
[2:13:50] now watch this improving his word and
[2:13:52] I'm gonna and I'm gonna stop now yeah
[2:13:55] proving his word
[2:13:58] when the word here unites with the
[2:14:02] person
[2:14:04] the word has come forward I'm finished
[2:14:07] the word has come forth and it unites
[2:14:11] with the person
[2:14:13] and they too become one
[2:14:16] then what does it do then
[2:14:20] word and the person become one
[2:14:31] of man again
[2:14:36] ha I gotta say that again
[2:14:38] it manifests the son of man again
[2:14:45] not the church theologians
[2:14:48] the son of man the word and the church
[2:14:52] becomes one
[2:14:57] whatever the son of man done
[2:15:01] he was the word
[2:15:04] and the church does the same thing
[2:15:09] she has the saith the Lord
[2:15:17] people say only a prophet has thus saith
[2:15:19] the Lord
[2:15:21] well if you're the message you are the
