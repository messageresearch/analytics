ask this that you bless us and give us our daily bread in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I each one of you in the precious name of Jesus Christ I would like for you to open your Bibles to the prophet Mei and chapter 4 and verse two the title of my message this morning is the great light it's a great light so then we'll read from from fromd me it this way but unto you that fear my name shall son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up ases of the S now I would like to read open your Bible to Zechariah which is the book before Mal and from verse 14 or chapter 14 pardon me and verse 6 and seven and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light our them is the great may be seated in the beginning when Man created the heavens and the Earth God created two big lights God created the Sun and he created the moon he created the Sun for the day and he created the moon for the night that is what God created in the beginning in the beginning when God started his creation and God created man from the dust of the earth God created him uh he made him of 16 elements and he one of the 16 elements was Cosmic one was calcium and petroleum this is what man is made out of that is the body that is not the spirit as we look at one another this morning we see a body but we don't see the spirit we neither see the soul but God created in the beginning he created a sun and he created the moon light is a great thing in Early Times uh man looked at at at at the light when they saw lightning come from the sky is one of the great mysteries of nature the ancient Romans believed that thunder and lightning were the weapons of the juper of the god Jupiter but in the year of 1700 uh there was a man by the name of Benjamin Franklin Franklin and he showed the connection between electricity and lightning he made a Sil kite and Fen a piece of wire near its top he attached a long string to the kite and he tied an iron key to the end of the string in the year 1752 there was a storm and Benjamin Franklin took the kite he threw the kite into a thunder head and the as the kite hit the Thunderhead the train started getting stiff Benjamin Franklin took his finger and gently touched the key and he felt the electrical charge coming from the cloud and that was a very dangerous experiment but Benjamin Franklin proved that there was a connection between electricity and lightning he also placed what we call a battery and he took some of that charge and it went into that battery but it took another say another Century for a man by the name of Thomas Edison to be able to make a light bulb that would bring in the electricity and they called Thomas Edison the wizard men par so then Thomas Edison they asked him a question what is a genius he said it is 1% inspiration and 99% persperation that's what Thomas def a genius I was reading an encyclopedia and it says that Thomas Edison created the electricity well I don't care if I read it out of an encyclopedia enyclopedia is wrong Thomas never created the electricity what Thomas Made because I believe God gave him that knowledge he made a light ball with the filament made out of thread that would be able to bring in the electricity and it would put forth light in a dark room but in the beginning God there was a Darkness upon the whole earth and God saw that Darkness wasn't good because God does not abide in darkness for God is light but when we see God and we look at God as light God is not that light that is Cosmic light even our bodies have Cosmic light we go through a cosmic light of the universe but God put a light in the heaven he placed another light for for the night and this light is a s of righteous that's what God put for you and I that's a great light amen Cosmic light is one thing though he isn't thing zo is light from God because God is light that is the reason that a lot of people don't see God because you can't see him with this eye this eye is made out of cosmic light out ofro out of and all these things but is picked up by the Inner Man and then when you pick him up you can then if it brings this body under control then these senses are subject to the inner sense then a man can see God Amen I want to go into a scripture if you open with me to First John chapter 1 and verse and all of you fine people amen notice here first John 51 this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin when Jesus Christ came to this earth he was the light he was not a reflection he was the light when John the Baptist came to this earth they asked him the question are you the light he said I am not the light I only bear witness of the light I am not him he I am not worthy even to untie his shoes I am not the great light he is the light in the beginning was the light which was the word the word was made God and it dwell Among Us the word was made flesh amen and it dwelt among us I could go into preaching but I I want to take it a little slow so that you can understand it I I want I want you to get it these are very what we call very simple things but the people don't seem to understand this but maybe this morning we take it a little slow God can help us he is the only he is the light that comes to man open your Bibles to the gospel of St John from chapter 1 and verse one and it was this way in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the L that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name the Bible here says that the world was made by him that's the reason that I said a while ago that Thomas Edison did not make the electricity Thomas Edison isn't God the world was made by God God came to the world he he was with us in flesh he was here the light of the world Amen now I want to go to another scripture and it's found in the the gospel of St Matthew and in Chapter 13 and verse 10 we are dealing with a great light and no here chapter 13 and verse 10 of the Gospel of St Matthew the disciples came and said unto him why speak thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever has to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever has not from him shall be taken away even that he have therefore speak kind to them in Parables because they see see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which said by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is WX gross and their ears are D and of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verely I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which he see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them what is it that those people did not see if the things that we are now seeing we live in the most wicked age but we also live in the Golden Age we are living in a time when all things have come to a Capone where the things of God are being made manifest I don't want to get ahead of myself I just want to go step by step I was asked the other day that we follow a man I said I Sur don't follow a woman I follow a man even God is Man when he came down to this earth he took the form of a man for the woman is my byproduct of the man so then we see that we do follow a man but what manner of man do we follow I don't follow a man in the outer Court I follow a man in the inner Veil I follow a man that has gone into God's presence and has brought zo and then my eyes began to see my eyes see what they could not see because the eyes are anointed with from God that was brought by a man that man wasn't the light he only was the B heed a b to bring the light I want to go into a scure that's in the book of in the 13th chapter and in verse 45 here it is speaking about Paul and Barnabas now notice the scripture carefully acts the 13th chapter and verse 45 but when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and foke against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blasing notice again these Jews were filled with Envy because when Paul was speaking great multitudes were coming to hear they wanted to hear what was going on in the heavens and Paul was bringing them light and these Jews were very EnV of this they started contradicting and blaspheming Paul everything that Paul said they would contradict it Paul would say something they would Blas me that for that is the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit when they speak what God is doing in the form of the Holy Spirit through his service and to reject that that's blessing of the Holy Spirit they were blasing what Paul was saying but notice what kind of a man Paul was and Barnabas his friend and here it says verse 46 then Paul and Barnabas wax B and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you because in John one we read a while ago John that that to his own he came but his own received him not so then it says here it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you seen you put it from you and C yourself Unworthy of everlasting life no we turn to the Gentiles that is a hard statement because the word came to those Jews but they rejected the light Paul said you people find yourself Unworthy of everlasting life that is the same with the Gentiles people say I am not worthy that's right we're not worthy but he made us worthy we are worthy of that's what makes us worthy if I walk around and I say I am not worthy but when he come back I'm not going to go no place because I'm not worthy but I got to be found worthy to stand before the son of man the only way that I can be found worthy is if the light of God CHS around me it's not AIC zo it is the life of the of the Everlasting God this Jews they said we're not worthy Paul said then we got to turn turn our back we're going to go to another people to find out if they're worthy all right we're going to get to the scriptures to find out we're going to be worthy amen now go again to verse 47 for so have the Lord Comm us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth who played Paul as light to the Gentiles it was God he was the light oh but they couldn't see him they were only seen a b that was bringing the light of God it was reflecting to the people and the light was bringing salvation it was bringing healing through the ministry the AP the wise Master build that was God when Paul was walking that was God walking that's what the people get figured out they don't understand that us they say you follow a man that's very true but I follow a man he is not a reflection he's a reflector he's coming from God a man that blew a he hit Thunder he made the light come down when the lightning starts in the cloud need a ground to come to there got be somebody down [Applause] here that when Jesus Christ went away and then when the apostles were killed and the church started dying down the church died in the age of and we find out that that whe of corn was buried but we find that he started coming out again he came out in the times of Luther and Luther said that just shall by faith that wasn't all the light that was part of the L when Wesley came out to the Methodist not that they were the Methodist he called him that because of his method of teaching but as Wesley came out he brought out the second part which was sanctification then when Pentecost came in the year 1906 the restoration of the gifts came out that was the third part that wasn't all the light there was a gate There Was An Open Door was by God that would bring light that would bring light to the people why let go back to a verse back to back to to Mali amen chapter 4 and verse two it says again but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings now let us go to Zarah toter 14 verse 6 and S it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light there was a man by the name of said if I knew God's secret place I would go to his house I would knock on the door he would open me the door I would come in with him I would worship with him I would worship him there if I only knew that secret hallah come on hallelujah hallelujah that secret place that secret place though we come to that man the hidden place of God oh could we worship God we could really worship God I wouldn't expect for you to bring God to the church because I would bring him here in my heart oh in the secret place that is where God Mi the worshiper hallu oh but wait a minute before we get to secret how am I going to find it I don't see the light I got to get me a light bulb amen amarah it that it shall be a day that will neither be day nor night oh my what a day it is day it is a night the sun is was made by God to be the light in the daytime the moon was made by God to be the light at night but this day is neither day nor night it is a very dismal day it is a very cloudy day oh there's C confusion oh we got 969 different denominations oh we have so many groups oh but no one can see but the Bible says that in the evening time there was going to be light the was going to come from God how was it going to come to come from the cloud because over the cloud is the Sun have you ever gone up in aane and you go up over those clouds the sun is shining but you can see it oh you can see that sun oh there's a cloud covering the whole and the people see nothing but a dismal cloudy day they see a lot of Shadows they see a lot of negatives but there had to come an evening light the same light that came to the Jews the same night that would come to the gentille civilization has traveled from the East to the West all that light was up there but one said one thing another one said oh praise be to God but there was a man born in Kent he was not the light but he also came bearing witness of that light he started growing up he started going into the apostolic church he started going to the assem of God he started going into the Church of God he went around the world seven times oh how do people love that man because the churches started filling up because when he saw a blind man he would Open the Eyes of the blind man when they would bring him a dead person and that was a perfect plan of God for that man to raise up that man would raise up oh the people would see a light they would see life because Jesus Christ said I am the way the truth and the life I am the way back to the father but the only way that he was going to do it was by men oh hallelujah hallelujah has this man Open the Eyes of he picked up the the the man that were with without lims and or that were paralyzed and so forth and all this thing would come to this man the healings oh praise be to God how the people love that the churches were ped but then the people started coming out of the churches we were coming out of Babylon oh we're making an exit then the the minister started saying oh that William Ren he's got a doct of the devil they started blaspheming they started contradicting him and what were they doing they wanted to walk in darkness they would not receive the light because the light came from God but God only shines through a reflector which is a prophet and the people love more Darkness than the light oh Hallelujah they said where is God what is God all these questions all these Mysteries the Bible says that in the evening time there was going to be light I want you to open the scripture with me in first John chapter 5 and verse S and eight oh praise God there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are three different ones that's not the way the Bible reads they say that these three are one these three are one they bear record in heaven and they're one oh but look look at the Bible now in verse eight there are three that bear witness on Earth in Earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one we see here that there is three bearing record on or witness in this earth we see it from the natural births and we take it to the spiritual birth that is the reason that a lot of people have water which is justification they have blood which is sanctification and they have holy spirit that is fine and a lot of people say they receive the holy spirit all right that is fine but that holy spirit that you receive will guide you to that one because that one is the one that had that that brings the light from God so that if you never see the B that is bringing the light you will never understand God you will never receive the son of righteousness you will never receive healing in your wings until you learn fear God first because the word of God say to those that fear my name that what's wrong with the people it's so easy to walk with the world and it is easy to do anything we want to do but when we fear God all the son of righteous will arise with healing in it wings that wings of an bring healing to the people the people say I don't need to do that you'll never get it because he takes the ball he needs a man that may contact with God where God came down and he Abed in in his heart he went into that secret place and he abided there with him when that man was speaking he wasn't the flesh speaking it was it was God to open your eyes to open my eyes ano us with it was taken away the flesh that's what's wrong we like to do many things of the flesh pardon me for what I got to say but we should love to sit down and watch television always we like to sit down and do many different things I'm not a hypocrite I like it my flesh like that I told you I didn't like it the biggest Li behind this pit there came a prophet he said get the hell vision and kick it out of your house who was the one that said it it was theiving story it was bringing life to you I want your eyes to see now I want you to see God now I want you to see with his eyes oh because you you got eyes they say I got eyes I can see I got ears I can hear what do you hear what do you see the Bible says they have eyes they can't see they got ears they can hear why it is still a dismal day it is still covered with clouds oh praise God but when this man from Kentucky oh he was picked up he went to that cloud who formed the cloud the cloud was formed by seven angels they were bringing up light from the son of righteousness when this Prophet came down from the cloud oh he unveiled God he took away the clouds he brought back to us 20th century he showed us the way back he said follow me as I follow Christ I am the way back you say that was Jesus Christ I'll say Amen but the reflection in the reflector hallelujah hallelujah that is the reason that when William SP to the people he told that man this man came out of a meeting he said I don't believe in Divine brother says why don't you I can't see it he said oh I'm going to get it now he said do you believe in God he says I sure do says you don't see him he says oh said where do you live he said on the other side of the mountain oh I know a man that went beyond that brother to the other side of the mountain that man said oh praise God he said I live on the other side of the mountain brother said how do you know it's over there how do you get there he said by a path he said but what you do at night he said I carry a lantern amen he carried a lantern with he said but the lantern doesn't shine all the pth he said but it only shines part of the pth that's it that's the way we follow Jesus one step at a time but the is shining is taking us to the other side of the mountain will be fulfilled the are six purpose of Gabriel's Vis to Daniel the anointing of the most holy how do we get there we get there by following that path oh when we follow those footprints on the sense of time we will get there now here we go into another scripture Revelations 3 17 and 18 now notice when Jesus Christ spoke in Chapter 13 of St Matthew in verse 10 he said having eyes they see and having not heav ears they cannot hear notice Revelations 3:17 this is the last book of the Bible this is the revelation of Jesus Christ oh he says Thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have of nothing and know is not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I consel the to buy a me gold in the fire th mayest be rich and white r that th may be closed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with th sou that thou may see brother and sister the devil will rub you up every blessing that God has put forth if you let you yourself are equipped to fight that devil only way you can do it just look at that light and when you look at that light no matter what saying does you say to him it is written it is in the book I don't fear no evil for the light is with me my step they comfort me they my head of oil oh my eyes are full of I I can see but what am I seeing I am seeing what the light was sh shining that's what I'm seeing light the light is a path is a light unto my Matthew 5 hallelujah oh h when we can get the people when we put forth this light oh my what a people we will be nature is crying for the manifestation of the sons of God it's with pain waiting people say I'm waiting for I'm waiting for the Lord Jesus Christ that's fine so am I but I got to be worthy to stand before him he provided a way for you and I all you have to do is accept that walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another the blood of Jesus covers us then we see that people don't see this is a great thing here H A lot of people don't understand when the Bible speaks that we are setting in Heavenly places in Christ the people want to see those heavenly place in Christ with but let me tell you one thing when we were in the myy clay and when we were in sin when we used to like to do the things of the world we were deep in sin but when that that light came to us it lifted us up from those sinful things and we are now setting in Heavenly places in Christ that is the reason when you see a picture of people like this in Flames they are burning with a torment because of the things that are going on around the world looking for an escape so that they can be liberated many of them run to church that is fine run to church love him give your heart to him and if you don't see the light bulb sooner or later you will if you believe him and don't enter into a contradiction and to blashe God there's what God is doing these people that raise their hands those are souls in prison they are still down here in sin taking a stick of marijuana taking a bottle of whiskey taking another man's wife run around in divorces living around with common-law wives and all the fields of the world that is the darkness oh but God has placed the light so that you will not walk in those dark things you will walk in light as he is in the light Hallelujah why do you want to be stuck down there in sin why don't you want to come up and sit in Heavenly places so that there will be healing all around you there will be healing in your families there will be healing in your house there will be a peace in your heart there will you will be so confident that your children are guarded by the angel of the Lord I have a right to call on God for that because I don't abide in sin even though sin comes to me but the has shown around us it takes away the sin and it overshadows the sin and the Darkness and Light cannot walk together one has to die for the other one to live oh and when the light is shining watch what kind of people we should be Matthew 5 verse 13 or 14 514 of St Matthew ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be here neither do men light a candle put it under a denominational gate that's what the prophet says I'm just quoting the prophet when he placed the bush he said there was a denominational gate denomination will do this will separate you it'll separate you from God because they have their own [Music] ways their systems oh Hallelujah but when you come to this word you see the B you see the reflector you see the reflector that is getting the Reflection from Zoe So then if we are children of light then we should walk as children of light I want to say as more testimony the other day I say this for God's glory how I feel about it all how I feel about the whole thing I don't like to be a hypocrite I don't like to say one thing and do another because that is not what we have been taught the Bible doesn't teach that the word don't teach that I was having a little rough time at home and I went to my oldest son I'm not shaming him in front of you because if you were sincere you would admit that you have the same problems but I told him I told my wife I told my children if you if you don't straighten out with me I won't stand behind a pulit because the Bible says that we are children of the light what kind of light are we are we putting forth are we putting forth God's light or are we putting on a show like Hollywood with all its glamor all those big lights oh my how they attract the eyes I told him this my my oldest son he came to me he said daddy pray for me that these demons leave me I said I'm going to pray for you well I guess I guess the Lord heard our prayer he's been a mighty fine boy since then I think he's going to preach to us thday he even invited his grandma to come I went to my father and mother's house I told him that he was going to preach Thursday my mother and father I think will be here Thursday if that isn't a victory I don't know what a victory is but see the promises of God are yours today for you we heard this young man he
