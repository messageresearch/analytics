through all those bad times did you hold on to your religion he said no My Religion held on to me then he went on to say it's not whether I can hold on to Jesus it's Jesus holding on to me amen how many would you stand with me thank you for doing that it kind of sets a president for where we're going tonight if the Lord is willing amen amen how many believes and and not only believes it but knows beyond the shadow of a doubt that we are in the last days if you don't believe we're in the last days it's simply because you don't want to believe we're in the last days amen amen signs are all over the place and there's no way uh to ignore it and I'm not going to ignore it and I want to just talk to you just for a few moments in having the confidence where it doesn't even it's not necessarily Faith because when you know something it doesn't take Faith to believe it if you already know it you understand what I'm saying I don't have to have faith to believe that brother Caleb PES is my friend or that he's my brother I know he is how many of you know that so I don't have to have faith to believe it because I know it and I'll explain as we get closer turn with me in your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 verse one and thank you very much to the ministry brother K PES see before I would have said perezz you all right boy no okay you nervous Holy Spirit came in you dropped that happen all right well that's a good thing I'm good and I also want to thank uh brother Tommy thank you all for having me having the confidence to invite me again um I have confidence in him but he's so busy next time we can just Jam you all in the room come on down and brother Caleb brother Tommy come and bring the holy spirit with you amen Hebrews 11 verse1 say now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen Heavenly Father we ask you lord to bless your word not just your word but the people who hear it and become doers of such we are under great anticipation for just not another Revival or church service but father we are under great anticipation for the resurrection amen not only Lord in the flesh but tonight in the spirit granted father we pray and help Lord to just be completely out of the way for your honor and For Your Glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because there is none greater amen amen you may be seated so to to get a little uh into this I need to explain I want to help you understand the word hope and I just I don't want to I I want to just am I right am I right just let it flow that okay all right okay because I don't want to miss anything and I don't want you to miss anything now in the English translation the word hope is completely misused how many of you knew that there's a few scholars in here so let me explain the way the English in the English translation you're doing great uh we use it as a weak hope and because of the way we use it when brother brandham said things like faith hope charity the greatest of these was charity we sort of put in second place Faith uh subconsciously now and we definitely make hope kind of a weakling because of the way we use it you see because in the English it is it means to cherish a desire it means to want want or wish okay to want something to happen or to want something to be true are you with me so far so when I say I hope eler doesn't mess up that was funny yes yeah that was planned okay when I say that that that's like expressing that I don't have too much confidence are you with me now if I say I hope Johnny shows up to work today it's probably because I'm used to him not ever calling in and I mean not ever calling and just not showing up in other words I hope I wish I I I want this person to show up how many how many understands what I'm saying I hope they like me I hope they love me oh I got one for I hope it's not a long service I hope brother Caleb don't take too much time now you're getting it all right but in the Greek that almost sounds like gecko don't say that all right the word hope in the New Testament it uh from the word elpus it it it it means a high expectation trust uh and confidence all right it it means to anticipate with pleasure oh come on now right with pleasure I am anticipating this great move of God got me now and to welcome that which you're in anticipation for it is an expectation my favorite part with a guarantee all right come on SO in the New Testament when it says faith is the substance of things HED for see you see how we're doing that we have faith and I wish it's like I wish it happened we have faith but I'm not sure I know I can be healed I have faith but I'll go see the doctor Anyway come on come on now the way I'm showing it to you faith is the substance of things hoped for in other words that are [Applause] guaranteed faith is the substance of things that I am anticipating with pleasure with great anticipation and expectation in another words faith is the substance of things I know are going to happen or you can do better than that give God I'll praise it a light bul comes on we struggle over with Faith and Hope how they mix together but if we read it right and understand it then faith is now stronger with that kind of hope you understand what I'm saying before Faith was still kind of weak right we've come this far right but with a strong guarantee hope we have come we have come this far by faith and I have a hope that means I'm guaranteed make it all the way huh huh see so now I got to read you more hope scriptures because I wanted to just change the whole way we look at the word hope go with me to Romans 15 now remember I want you to change not just having faith for the resurrection but to accompany it with this guaranteed hope you understand now I hope I live to see it no I have a hope that I shall never die let's try that I have a hope that I shall never die I shall see the resurrection I shall see the Rapture does that feel better than the way we would have said it before are you foll me now I need you to just bear with me now Romans 15 uh chapter I mean verse six I'm sorry I usually asked but it got a little warm um that you may be oh that that you excuse me that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ see it's an the word's anointed wherefore receive you one another verse seven as Christ also received us to the glory of God now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the fathers it's going to get somewhere just trust me all right how many trust okay look in nine let me just read the whole verse then what you like okay all right and and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his Mercy go ahead read that sorry to pause there just for a second I need us Gentiles to understand the importance glorifying god let's try that again to understand the importance of glorifying God you see when they worship in the temple the the the pillar of fire came in in the scripture says the pillars shook they were giving God the glory so I need us Gentiles to understand the importance of giving God the [Applause] [Music] glory all right I trust by the end of the service you going be doing cartwheels brother the mik all right now look as it is written for this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles and sing unto thy name oh I love it and again he sath Rejoice you gentiles I think I need to stay there for a little while he said again I tell you rejoice you [Applause] Gentiles Rejoice [Applause] Gentiles well we're going to get it so why is that so important because the ones that were once not even allowed to even look at the Tabernacle we couldn't even look at the Tabernacle we couldn't even be near it let alone go into the holies of Hol but what they don't understand is that not only are we allowed in the holies of holies we are the holies of holies [Applause] they're looking for a third Temple and that's important but don't you know I am the Third Temple we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost changed we weren't allowed in but now we're there holding everything that God has revealed to us were rejects reject nobody wanted us but Jesus Christ spilled his blood so that you and I have a right to go in so again I say praise the Lord I I wasn't even allow out in there I was nothing to them not worshipper filthy dirty a [Music] pig they didn't even let the half breeds him half uh half mixed right Samaritan they couldn't even go but Jesus brother said was not just interested in the Jews he was interested in all of us reserved a place in his heart for all of us turn to your neighbor and say weer a spot for you nobody told me though but you know what's beautiful I don't need anybody to tell me because I know amen amen not because I believe by faith I don't know how to explain this to you I know who my father is it started off with faith and I had to believe but then when my spiritual Amnesia released remembered where I came came from and where I'm going back to I no longer have to believe it I know it see it is that beautiful I'm not doing away with faith you I hope so all right I got to hurry um it says Rejoice all you Gentiles and all of you rejoice verse 12 and again Isaiah saith there shall be a root of Jessie and he that shall rise to Reign Over the Gentiles in him shall the Gentiles trust that's why that's why we can sing sing the wondrous of Jesus sing his mercy and his gra because we know he didn't have to do this for [Music] us I don't know why he loves me but I'm so glad he does aren't you glad just for what you did today you thought last night just thought aren't you glad that he loved you enough and he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing oh God have mercy all right here we go now verse 13 now the god of Hope go ahead that means guarantee the god of guaranteed word the god that is guaranteed not lie the god that is guaranteed that if he said it I believe it and I can go to the bank with it if he said that I'm filled then I am filled because he's the god of guarantee I guarantee it are you with me now the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope you see it through the power of the Holy Ghost you give me just a few more minutes let's go to Romans 8 how many is with me so far guaranteed it changes everything where before I was just hoping now I have oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah Romans 8 ROM 22 what happened here oh there it is all right watch this we know the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now until now you said that until now sorry see I'm learning my Spanish I knew he didn't say are you proud of me huh proud yeah you know if you're the only one clapping I'm good you that I'm in a contest with thank you brother J I want you to watch something you see what's happening and I know your pastor talking T to you about it already total solar eclipse that's coming on the 8th of April two days after the prophet's birthday huh huh passing over Seven Cities called Nineveh crossing over the last city called

it has two little horns boom right drop the mic walk away oh Lucifer how you fallen oh Lucifer he's showing us in the Stars what's coming look do do I know that this is it that I don't know but I'm not foolish enough to ignore what might be the last sign that the rest of the world ever seen are you with me and then you see all the wars in US turning on Israel and isra has now turned on us did you know that we passed the bill telling them about their Seas fire and brother Benjamin Netanyahu Benjamin said who are you to tell us that we cannot defend our country we're not coming to Washington

were on this road but now you're on this road are you now all right come on Caleb preach for we are saved by hope now you got to pay attention to this but hope is not hope did he do that in Spanish more ours I think right if it seem you don't have to look you don't have to hope for it I'm trying to tell you you know see but he said not hope if you have to if it's seen for what a man seeth why does he hope for it it doesn't have to you see it that's why Hebrews 11:1 faith is a substance of things hopeful so I may not see it but my faith guarantees guarantee the guarantee has a guarant huh huh you like that real estate people huh you like that car salesman the guarantee has a backup check it out you ready for this the resource has a source got it the resource that's me but I don't get this of myself I have a source I have a hope and that Faith backs up my hope oh man are you getting this at all are you getting this all right he says but if we hope going on but if we hope for what we see not he asked the question do we with patience wait for it let me drink some water that right y'all ain't working I am it's not winter anymore man turn the heater off are you with me y I asked a qu Paul here asked question have in Victory Day brother brandom said don't get discouraged for where you're at he said there's a purpose for it we're too busy going what's the purpose what's the reason why why why why shut upo you love it I'm going to get a hug in a minute be quiet right because there's a reason it it's not for us to know why it's for us to trust him why would he do that to job because God wanted job to see how much job trusted him he wanted job to see God knew how much job loved but needed to realize how much really loved God and job said I know my redeemer lives you know what he said that for the Redeemer ever walk walked on the Earth right before Jesus ever stepped on the earth thousand of years you said I know Lord all right verse 27 uh nope I'm good no no we're good uh but let's read 28 real quick we got to hit that and we know and we know see that's what I'm talking about he say and we believe he didn't say and we have faith for no he said and we know know everybody say we know I know I know say come on man where's my hook I'm getting he's like all kind of impressed I love it I'm two seconds from throwing him off and doing my own interpreting I'm I'm justad no no no no I'm not that confident yet I don't know that much Spanish I tell you a story right quick I was praying a prayer line and I'm not going to say it was like profiling got me but brother Billy Paul Billy Paul was praying for the sick and the Spanish speaking brother comes up and I was the only Mexican up there so he just assumed I could pray for him in Spanish I go I don't know Spanish how embarrassing was that oh that's all right brother pray for any and I always regretted that I should have just opened my mouth anyway that's all right sorry all right let's finish up uh first Peter 3 and I'll try not to I want to get I want to honor the time all right first Peter 3 uh verse 14 oh my hope is in the Lord From This Time on and ever more All My Hope Is In The Lord forever more my guarantee I don't I can't look at me anymore I get too caught up looking at me CU if I'm honest this could never never inherit heaven but then job said though these skin worms eat my fles yet in my flesh I shall see hey uh by the way the word sh in the Greek in also means guaranteed so shall my word go out of my mouth it shall not it is guaranteed not to come back it will it shall accomplish I guarantee it will it will accomplish everything God set it out to do do you believe this say amen amen oh 14 but oh but and if we suffer for righteousness sake happy are you and be not afraid of the terror neither be TR TR but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an an answer to every man that ask you a reason of the hope that is hold on that is in you with meekness and fear go ahead yeah 315 sounds so much prettier in Spanish brother green said when we get to heaven for whatever reason we're all going to speak in German however we're all going to sing in Spanish that's what he would say but do you see this you have to be ready to give an account for the guarantee that is in your heart yeah but sister you've cut your hair yeah but I said I was sorry I said oh sorry I said I was sorry and he forgave me but brother you were out drinking but I said I was sorry and he forgave me and well brother you have this past and sister you got that past but I returned and said I was sorry and I thanked him for his grace and he forgave me how do you know because he placed a guarantee where in my heart he put a stamp on it and it says Satan do not enter Holy Spirit only oh I don't look look look your mind can go crazy your flesh can really mess up but that seed that's been in you all this time can never sin I'm waiting go ahead some of you got it the rest of you not sure you know when I tell you that that you've never sinned do you realize that you're fighting your flesh right now because your flesh is reminding you about the acid trips you've been on or the weed you smoke don't get Qui come on I I'll pick one of you come up here don't act like you can't your flesh is fighting them but your spirit is saying I don't know what you're talking about because Jesus dropped the [Applause] charges he accused the devil of tampering messing around polluting the evidence so now you got to throw it out there's nothing here but Caleb did this this and this and Caleb donon also did this this and this but the Lord said where just put it right there but thank you that's another note for another time Jesus dropped the charges all the witnesses mysteriously disappear all your drug dealers are locked upas or converted or but the mic what happened he's like well yeah he's locked up you know what I mean so I have a reason I don't have to believe in what my flesh says and when I look in the mirror I see nothing but a lying vanity because in the mirror I'm getting uglier older and fatter older but that's a lie because I have another body waiting for [Applause] me my theop is calling me come up a little higher come up are you with me all right praise the Lord last one First Corinthians 15 chapter 15 somebody say praise the Lord somebody say I love you Lord somebody say thank you Lord maybe I should have said somebody saying Thank You Lord oh man you know I love him and I can't explain to you everything but I know that he loves me and that's all I really care about I know he's coming back because he told me he was uh uh 1513 all right but if there be no resurrection of the dead then Christ is not risen and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching vain your faith is also vain uh let's continue uh uh let's go 15 16 and 17 all right yay we are found false Witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so be that the Dead rise not okay 16 for if the Dead uh rise not then is not Christ raised and if Christ be not rais your faith is in vain and are yet in your sins understand what is your sign of the Resurrection I don't have any time for quotes I'm just gonna is that all right is that all right he wants to move and I want to he's already moving then how do you know you're if you should die how do you know you're going to rise up you see because we're talking about a a physical raising mean real people breathing again because once I was dead dead in sin and I was spiritually resurrected other words Born Again In all the scriptures tesy that God is not coming back for your first birth he's coming back for your second birth it's in the Old Testament where does it say that brother real quick I can show you are you ready he told Nicodemus how are you a master of the message and you don't know oh I mean I'm sorry sorry how are you master of Israel and you don't know this nicod was must have been like racking his head what does it say that well he didn't take ish he took Isaac he didn't take Esau he took Jacob he didn't take manasse he blessed eph are you with me he didn't use Adam he used Jesus so God never did take the firstborn he always took the second you see it you must be born again it was there the whole time he didn't take your Stony heart he gave you a heart of Flesh he didn't take a bloody sacrifice he took away the sacrifice that took away the sins of the world are you with me now so you know that you have a hope for the resurrection how many believes it can I read something to you by God's grace I'm finishing up I woke up Monday morning and uh y'all know who Martin Luther King is nobody knows who he is what is he famous for just say the first line and I woke up Monday morning and the Lord heard I heard his Dr King's voice repeat five times I have a dream I have a dream I have a dream I have a dream I have a dream I sat up and I thought is he trying to tell me something and then out of my mouth I heard this I have a hope today that though my sins were as Scarlet they are now white as snow I have a hope today that through that though these skin worms eat my yet in my flesh I will see God I have a hope today that All God's Children of every tongue nation and denomination will walk hand in hand Glory I have a hope today that every faction of the Bride will melt together as one not because of Doctrine or Creed but because of perfect love realizing that we are all daughters and sons fill with the spirit of our father I have a hope today that the Beloved savior of my soul will come and sweep his waiting Bri I have a hope today and I am ready to give an account of the Hope which is inside my heart the hope of glory Christ in me and I in him I have a hope today my hope is in the Lord God bless you God bless you musicians come on somebody give him praise if you have home give him praise I
