[35:01] hall god bless you this morning
[35:04] [Music]
[35:11] revelations chapter 12 and verse 7 says
[35:18] and there was war in heaven
[35:22] michael and his angels fought against
[35:24] the dragon
[35:25] and the dragon fought and his angels
[35:40] and prevailed not
[35:55] and prevailed
[35:59] again they've already lost once
[36:02] they're they they they want to see if
[36:04] they can ever
[36:05] win but they've already
[36:09] lost
[36:25] that that means that we've already won
[36:29] the bible says and prevailed
[36:34] i hope you get that this morning
[36:37] prevailed not neither was their
[36:41] place found anymore in heaven
[36:46] i want to say to you this morning
[36:50] and i have good news this morning
[37:09] [Applause]
[37:19] that old serpent called the devil
[37:30] he was cast out into the earth and his
[37:33] angels were cast
[37:35] out with him
[37:39] now you know why we have so much trouble
[37:44] he was cast out of heaven
[37:48] unto the earth and his angels were cast
[37:51] out with him
[37:54] now the prophet of god mentions to us
[37:59] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[38:02] lord
[38:44] it
[38:57] this is the reason why the apostle paul
[38:59] would tell us
[39:02] i see another law at work in my body
[39:09] warring against the law of my mind
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:25] and he says what a wretched
[40:12] and he keeps on telling us in the book
[40:14] of romans
[40:18] knowing this that our old man
[40:21] is crucified with him
[40:25] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[40:31] that we hence more serve should not
[40:34] serve sin
[40:50] if we live after the flesh we
[40:53] shall die but if we live through but
[40:56] but if ye through the spirit
[41:01] do mortify the deeds of the body
[41:22] [Applause]
[41:31] that's that's why we're here
[42:11] [Music]
[42:18] [Applause]
[42:41] in vain would we be doing
[42:56] we die
[43:10] from amongst
[43:35] the rest of the people are either
[43:38] joining one side or joining the others
[43:44] but there is conflict between two people
[43:50] and at the same time between all this
[43:52] conflict
[44:20] but it's within
[44:34] the
[44:56] [Applause]
[45:01] the one that satisfies our souls
[45:04] the one that hears our cries the one
[45:07] that gives us liberation
[45:09] ah the one that gives us liberation
[45:13] and says this is he says again
[45:16] because
[45:44] that will
[46:24] that also includes death
[46:37] that includes every problem that you
[46:40] have
[46:50] in
[46:54] the great speech that abraham lincoln
[46:57] gave to us
[47:02] this is is by far would be the greatest
[47:05] presidential
[47:06] speech ever given is
[47:22] let me leave it there but this is the
[47:25] great this is the great abraham lincoln
[47:27] this is the grand abraham lincoln this
[47:29] is what brother branham loved so much
[47:30] about about
[47:31] abraham lincoln was his character
[47:50] a new national
[48:03] now he says we are engaged in a great
[48:05] civil war
[48:09] testing whether that nation or any
[48:11] nation
[48:15] so conceived and so dedicated
[48:21] you know very few of us can can endure
[48:24] from one service to another
[48:28] very few people can endure from one day
[48:31] to another
[48:31] which is
[49:00] but this is worth the great abraham
[49:01] lincoln said
[49:04] can this nation endure
[49:09] and can we as a people endure
[49:14] and i
[49:43] we ourselves there are 1183 messages
[49:47] that have been recorded of brother
[49:49] branham
[49:53] that's not all the messages he preached
[49:54] those are just the ones that are
[49:56] recorded
[50:21] have we received have we uncovered
[50:24] enough of
[50:38] and that
[50:52] great revelation
[51:20] can we can we ask ourselves a question
[51:24] who's greater than cancer
[51:31] god is right that the the the
[51:34] the the commission of of of the angel
[51:38] the commission to brother branham was
[51:41] this
[51:43] if you can get the people to believe you
[51:45] just played
[51:50] [Music]
[52:01] not even cancer would stand
[52:27] you know the bible speaks to us in
[52:29] matthew 24 24
[52:46] i believe and i got faith right here
[52:49] all of a sudden a false christ comes and
[52:52] and and and it arises
[52:55] and it arises in my members and then it
[52:57] rides in my mind
[53:23] but there is uh something that
[53:26] that garners my attention
[53:31] and the thing is that that that
[53:34] that a man that is born
[53:39] of the spirit of god he cannot commit
[53:43] sin because the seed
[53:48] remains in him
[53:52] so something something tries to raise up
[53:57] and that seed pushes it back down
[54:01] something wants to say i i can't do this
[54:21] why is it that we that we we say this
[54:26] is we describe god as um omnipresent
[54:31] and we can go into describe and and and
[54:33] all this but i'm telling just just on
[54:35] the basis
[54:36] we
[54:49] but then we are not omnipotent
[55:04] is
[55:18] foreign there was war in heaven
[55:22] and the omnipotent god through michael
[55:26] cast him out there's war on earth
[55:31] omnipotent god through
[55:45] was created for the devil
[56:01] nation survive
[56:04] can we survive and we endure
[56:09] the bible speaks to us that endureth to
[56:13] the end
[56:33] a house divided against itself cannot
[56:36] stand
[56:41] and this is i believe what our pastor
[56:43] spoke to us the other day
[56:47] speaking of abraham lincoln and he says
[56:50] a house divided against itself cannot
[56:53] stand
[56:53] he says
[56:57] this government government cannot endure
[57:00] permanently half slave and half free
[57:02] este
[57:07] i do not expect the union to be
[57:10] dissolved
[57:16] but i do expect it will cease to be
[57:19] divided
[57:25] but i do expect the hospital it will
[57:28] cease to be divided
[57:31] it will either become all of one thing
[57:38] or all the other toyo
[57:41] either the opponents of slavery
[57:46] will arrest the further spread of it
[57:52] and place it where the public mind
[57:58] shall rest in the belief
[58:03] that it is in the course of ultimate
[58:06] extinction
[58:15] shall become lawful in all states old as
[58:18] well as new
[58:28] this was the great the great divided a
[58:31] house divided against itself cannot
[58:33] stand speech
[58:34] is this
[58:48] it cost him his life did did it get
[58:52] did did did slavery get abolished right
[58:54] away
[58:58] no no did part of the of the south get
[59:01] free
[59:02] partelive but still in all the border
[59:06] states there was still plenty of slavery
[59:11] when did this happen what what happens
[59:14] right here this is
[59:15] your car you
[59:27] you can only go 65 miles an hour
[59:32] when you see that sign how many actually
[59:34] go 65 miles an hour
[59:38] god bless you brother how many others
[59:41] others you actually go 65
[59:44] if you
[59:56] but if there's a law that says you have
[59:58] to treat each other well
[1:00:03] that does not diminish what you feel in
[1:00:05] your heart
[1:00:09] you can go and shake the man's hands
[1:00:25] by law you can live anywhere you want
[1:00:30] but inside of the heart
[1:00:33] and you found it in these last years
[1:00:37] a lot of people that live with that
[1:00:40] bitterness
[1:01:00] and the preacher or the pastor or the or
[1:01:03] the song leader will say
[1:01:04] shake your brother's hand
[1:01:22] might my father always said this
[1:01:26] whenever you would hear christians say
[1:01:30] if i wasn't a christian i would beat up
[1:01:32] that person
[1:01:35] no you're you're not a christian no no
[1:01:38] no no no no
[1:01:39] just by saying it you're not a christian
[1:01:42] because you have christianity as a law
[1:01:47] christianity is not a law
[1:02:04] they know not what
[1:02:19] what do i do i didn't have to give grace
[1:02:22] to somebody else
[1:02:25] i haven't actually been rescued
[1:02:30] this is the apostle paul
[1:03:00] i see that me and me two laws bill and
[1:03:03] me those ladies when i want to do good
[1:03:05] when the kiddos the devil is right there
[1:03:08] present right
[1:03:08] right right there right there
[1:03:12] trying to rise up in my membership
[1:03:25] if we would have had cnn or you don't
[1:03:27] want neil saying any
[1:03:32] the civil war probably would not have
[1:03:34] gotten to where it got to
[1:03:36] possible they said if we would have cnn
[1:03:39] in 1945 in the beaches of normandy
[1:04:10] what happened there's some bloodshed
[1:04:13] that was left
[1:04:18] and it left the heritage of grief and
[1:04:20] bitterness
[1:04:23] what is it now let's let's
[1:04:26] let's go and let's rename all the high
[1:04:28] schools
[1:04:33] but but let's not but let everybody do
[1:04:36] whatever they want to in the high school
[1:04:42] and take down all the statues that are
[1:04:44] not right
[1:04:47] all the confederate statues
[1:04:54] and how about the heart let's go and do
[1:04:58] all of these things that make us think
[1:05:00] bad
[1:05:03] what makes you think bad is not a statue
[1:05:06] lo que los
[1:05:06] pensar
[1:05:18] what makes the person act the way they
[1:05:34] answering to the to to the nature that
[1:05:37] is within ourselves
[1:05:42] battle with that am i a son of god
[1:05:46] am i a daughter of god there
[1:06:00] [Applause]
[1:06:02] when you know who lives inside of you
[1:06:06] and when you know what lives inside of
[1:06:08] you can be interested you know it's not
[1:06:11] the second
[1:06:11] or the third person of the trinity
[1:06:15] you know it's the person the omnipotence
[1:06:19] that dwells inside the heart of his
[1:06:21] people
[1:06:24] oh what a change that has been in my
[1:06:27] life
[1:06:28] oh what a change in my life

[1:07:27] the greatest enemy that i have
[1:07:30] not that man outside not anybody in here
[1:07:33] no it's not the greatest enemy that i
[1:07:35] have
[1:07:37] it's me myself i
[1:07:40] i
[1:07:51] nobody calls you on sunday morning and
[1:07:53] tells you don't come now
[1:08:18] for there shall arise false christos
[1:08:25] you know anything that is against the
[1:08:27] word of god
[1:08:33] anything you might you might hear our
[1:08:37] pastor
[1:08:37] say something you say no i don't think
[1:08:41] it's that way
[1:08:44] the spirit of antichrist just hits you
[1:08:48] you can't say it any plainer than that
[1:08:51] oh i don't know
[1:08:52] about that oh you know what is happening
[1:08:55] yes this is a civil war and an
[1:08:58] antichrist just stood up
[1:09:01] here but when will be the time
[1:09:07] that the sons of god can stand up
[1:09:15] someone said brother branham said
[1:09:18] when you was off those eight months
[1:09:19] understand this is what your message
[1:09:23] the time you almost that you are you
[1:09:24] almost to a breakdown
[1:09:33] he said he asked him the question
[1:09:34] question
[1:09:37] did you keep your religion
[1:09:42] brother branham greatly used of the lord
[1:10:00] and i said no sir a religion kept me
[1:10:04] merely
[1:10:09] you know i i have to say this
[1:10:21] i've heard the greatest messages that
[1:10:24] you'll ever hear
[1:10:32] i remember just a few weeks ago
[1:10:36] that a man stood behind this desk on
[1:10:38] wednesday and sunday
[1:10:53] and if god don't stand up for us that
[1:10:55] day we cease to exist
[1:11:11] because we did not know i did not know
[1:11:15] what god was doing in ourselves
[1:11:19] but when i saw god stand upon god
[1:11:26] never forgets his promises
[1:11:30] i gotta say that again god never forgets
[1:11:33] his promises
[1:11:34] you don't know how much i don't know
[1:11:36] jesus never forgets this
[1:11:52] scene it's not isn't whether i hang on
[1:11:56] brother
[1:11:57] says it isn't whether i hold out
[1:12:01] no no it's whether he holds out or not
[1:12:05] whether he held out
[1:12:16] you know i could stop right there let's
[1:12:18] not say one more word
[1:12:33] that was eternal stepped into
[1:12:48] so much that he was nailed to a cross
[1:12:52] and the reason he did that you won't
[1:12:55] have war in your membership
[1:13:06] that's the reason i'm safe tonight
[1:13:07] brother brown says
[1:13:10] not what i could do not by good works
[1:13:14] are we saved but by his mercy god saved
[1:13:18] us in christ
[1:13:19] unconditionally
[1:13:24] he saved us in christ unconditionally
[1:13:30] now
[1:13:42] skip to this but but i'm going to to to
[1:13:45] just do
[1:13:46] say this real quick
[1:13:51] you shall know the truth paragraph 217
[1:13:53] of the seals
[1:13:55] the second seal you shall know the truth
[1:13:57] and the truth shall make you free
[1:14:00] see the truth makes you free god marks
[1:14:04] his
[1:14:04] when they come in god marks his by
[1:14:08] vindicating his promised word through
[1:14:09] them
[1:14:13] that's exactly saint john 14 12.
[1:14:19] and another thing you want to put down
[1:14:23] i.e mark 16
[1:14:26] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[1:14:29] that believe
[1:14:32] ukraine and this is this what got me so
[1:14:34] much yes
[1:14:36] now only brother branham only says these
[1:14:39] these two these two
[1:14:40] this this pair of words these these this
[1:14:43] combination of words
[1:14:44] i've only found it one other time if you
[1:14:46] find it other times god bless you
[1:14:48] i only found it another day
[1:14:52] now let's just take that a minute
[1:14:54] talking about mark 16.
[1:15:00] and then he asked the question was he
[1:15:03] joking establiando

[1:16:15] big war and a civil war

[1:17:42] the seventh chapter
[1:17:57] sitting on the outside of the gate
[1:18:01] of the city of samaria
[1:18:05] it was so bad in samaria
[1:18:10] that they were boiling their children
[1:18:14] and eating them they had become
[1:18:17] cannibals

[1:18:37] much less the head which
[1:19:01] these four lepers this is
[1:19:04] sitting on the outside
[1:19:21] you know people people have a
[1:19:23] misconception of backsliding

[1:20:02] all he does is he just spits back down
[1:20:04] on his hunches
[1:20:06] don't walk back
