and I believe that we all you all know what I'm talking about cuckoo states are in the locale because we're all in this battle together estamos those juntos in this stuff is after one thing and that is for you to give up the noose test the reading I'm gonna tell you tonight that that is not an option yes you listen which is tuna so giving up is not an option in distance when up surrender is not an optical energy in trigger since we are in a battle but we are victorious another put us almost victorious an author by the name of frangipane uno to report an hombre friend he wrote this review is to the primary reason for weariness in the church la primera doesn't the discuss the new necklace yeah it's because instead of moving toward victory lugar the movers in hasta la victoria we settle for temporary relief no centavos por una and remember stand for that again the real weakness the reason that we we become weary at times don't you know discussed emotional cost is because instead of

lucky to the Guerrero has been neutralized by our our passivity a pseudo neutral is nada por nuestro passive it every one of you has an attitude of a warrior Carlos test enacted to dominate again single one of you I know the con ustedes you have the spirit of a warrior a little spirit to them you were born with that spirit of a warrior this is pity Twitter right but there comes a time when that has to be manifested tiempo cuando tenía que money as I see this now we become passive in a lot of things moving order know some of us he was we get a little bit of peace little Paquito pass and we began to beat our swords back into plowshares yep I suppose I will bear moist respiratory I mean I'm gonna slay this and I'm gonna say it again and again whereas you know the rebel a passive spirit it is not the spirit of a warrior what's the spirit to the Guerrero you see it's not about the level of energy in your body certainly well then if he and su cuerpo what is the level of fire in your soul listen even if quick when it is on a lever level of fire in your obedience to the words we're going over the NCL Apollo this is what God is telling us through his word first through your enemy

I'm in telepathic no tremendous church just entre mental is because we have to know that we have been with the creator chemist other we got to know that we have been with God before we can pursue the enemy most all the confusion to the personal enemy who either we will pursue our enemies as being person anymore our enemies and surely will pursue us what a mental enemy gonna pursue you know sort of problem sometimes Church I'm gonna say it again limo muchos vegetable we get very passive at time is this a mood possible you don't have to turn to it latina k.will TR but in second Samuel the
