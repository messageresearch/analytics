[0:01] We're going to be singing this song It
[0:02] matters to the Master because all things
[0:04] Matter to the Master. And we just hope
[0:07] that it's a blessing to you as it has
[0:08] been to us.
[0:14] [Música]
[0:36] When life gets you down and you feel
[0:40] more broken than
[0:45] whole, when The woods go deeper than
[0:50] worse. And you can't tell a
[0:57] soul. I may not know what you're going
[1:02] through. I may not can make that high
[1:06] mountain move.
[1:08] One thing I know that I really want you
[1:13] to
[1:16] know. If it matters to
[1:21] you, it matters to the
[1:27] master. He wants to share the burdens
[1:31] you bear.
[1:33] Whisper peace when your world gets
[1:38] shattered. If it's your greatest joy or
[1:42] your deepest pain or you're really
[1:46] needing an
[1:48] answer, if it matters to
[1:53] you, it matters to the master.
[1:58] [Música]
[2:01] Friend, do you think the maker and giv
[2:06] of
[2:10] life is far too busy to
[2:14] care about your trouble and
[2:21] strive? He sees the sparrow that falls
[2:25] to the ground and he hears the tear.
[2:29] that don't make a
[2:31] sound. If you only knew how mercious you
[2:35] are in his
[2:37] [Aplausos]
[2:40] heart. If it matters to
[2:45] you, it matters to the
[2:50] master. He wants to share the burden you
[2:55] bear.
[2:56] Whisper peace when your world gets
[3:00] shattered. If it's your greatest joy or
[3:05] your deepest pain or you're really
[3:09] needing an answer. If it matters to
[3:15] you, it matters to the master.
[3:21] If it's your greatest joy or your
[3:26] deepest pain or you're really needing an
[3:31] answer, if it matters to
[3:35] you, it doesn't only matter to
[3:41] you. If it matters to
[3:45] you, it matters to the master.

[4:43] Lord, that we may learn new things of
[4:45] your message. Lord, we ask that you bre

[17:14] Amen. At this time we have a few poems.
[17:17] We also have a few specials. So we're
[17:18] going to be asking our sister Hope to be
[17:20] coming forth and give her special her
[17:23] poem. And then after that we'll have the
[17:25] Cloud City Courtech come
[17:29] up. Good afternoon. God bless you. Have
[17:33] a poem to share with you all and I pray
[17:35] it be a
[17:36] blessing. Think about his love.
[17:41] Think about his goodness. Think about
[17:45] his grace that's brought us through. For
[17:49] as high as the heavens above, so great
[17:54] is the measure of our father's love.
[17:59] In the year 2007, a group of deepsea
[18:02] divers discovered a female octopus cling
[18:06] to the jagged ledge of a canyon located
[18:10] 4,600 fet below the ocean surface.
[18:14] She was guarding one hundred and sixty
[18:16] minute milky teardrops cemented to the
[18:19] rock. Her eggs, her
[18:22] children. For the female octopus laying
[18:25] eggs marks the glorious beginning of an
[18:28] inevitable end. She covers them, defends
[18:32] them, wa them so they continuously have
[18:36] fresh oxygenated water. The longer she
[18:39] watches them, the greater chance they
[18:41] have of
[18:43] surviving. In 2011, the deep sea divers
[18:46] returned and found that she remained
[18:49] there for 53 months. For 53 months, she
[18:54] watched over them, guarded them, fed
[18:56] them, protected them. for 53 months
[19:00] remaining, never leaving her side, never
[19:03] even taking a moment to eat, her skin
[19:06] turning pale, her body
[19:09] shrinking. They found that her eggs had
[19:11] successfully hatched, only the husks,
[19:15] the capsules of what they once were
[19:17] remaining behind. Her body was nowhere
[19:19] to be found.
[19:22] that that constance that determination
[19:28] that persistence that sacrifice that is
[19:32] the love of a true mother and as our
[19:35] prophet is said if the love of a mother
[19:38] will do that what will the love of god
[19:42] do the love of god sent his son to
[19:46] unfold to suffer as a sacrifice for me
[19:50] And for you, the love of God saw me at
[19:53] my rock bottom and said, "You, I choose
[19:57] you always, forever." The love of God
[20:00] steadfastly declares, "I have begun
[20:04] something beautiful in you and I will be
[20:07] faithful, so faithful to finish it." The
[20:11] love of God shelters, conceals,
[20:14] protects, sets you upon a rock. The love
[20:18] of God in our hearts makes us his
[20:21] children so much more than conquerors,
[20:25] so much more than able, so much more
[20:29] than alive. The love of God is
[20:34] unfathomable, immeasurable. It is deep.
[20:38] It is wide. It is great. So great. And
[20:44] forever. Forever I will sing great is
[20:49] the measure of our father's love.
[20:55] [Aplausos]

[39:26] me. Yes, they tell me of an
[39:32] uncloudy day.
[39:36] [Música]
[39:38] Oh,
[39:40] they tell me of a
[39:46] home where my loved ones, my loved ones
[39:51] go.
[39:53] Oh,
[39:55] they tell me of a
[39:58] [Música]
[40:00] land. It's not so far away.
[40:05] [Música]
[40:08] Where
[40:10] the tree of
[40:15] life sheds his
[40:17] fragrance through the
[40:21] air.
[40:22] Oh,
[40:24] they tell me of an
[40:29] un cloudy day.
[40:34] [Música]
[40:37] Oh,
[40:38] they tell me of a land of a
[40:43] home where my loved ones, my loved ones
[40:48] go. Thank you,
[40:50] Lord. Oh,
[40:53] they tell me of
[40:58] a it's not so far away.
[41:03] [Música]
[41:06] Where
[41:07] the tree of
[41:12] life shed his
[41:15] fragrance through the
[41:18] air.
[41:20] Oh,
[41:21] they tell me of an
[41:27] un cloudy day.
[41:31] Oh, they tell me of a
[41:35] king in his beauty. In his beauty,
[41:40] beauty there.
[41:45] And they tell me that my
[41:49] heart shall behold where he sits on his
[41:57] ro and is wi than the
[42:02] snow in that
[42:06] city made of
[42:10] gold
[42:12] all day
[42:14] Tell
[42:17] me
[42:19] on cloudy day.
[42:23] Oh, they tell
[42:24] me.
[42:26] Oh,
[42:28] they tell me of a of a
[42:32] home where my loved ones, my loved ones
[42:38] go.
[42:40] Oh,
[42:42] they tell me of a
[42:47] land. It's not so far away.
[42:54] Where
[42:55] the tree of
[43:00] life shed his
[43:03] fragrance through the
[43:06] air.
[43:08] Oh,
[43:10] they tell me. Oh, they tell me.
[43:15] Oh,
[43:17] they tell me. Yes, they tell me.
[43:22] Oh,
[43:24] they tell
[43:29] me
[43:31] cloud
[43:35] day. Allelujah.
[43:38] [Música]
[43:41] Tell me of a
[43:43] [Aplausos]
[43:45] king in his
[43:49] beauty. Beauty
[43:53] there.
[43:55] They tell me that my
[43:59] eyes shall be him sitting on sitting on
[44:03] his
[44:06] throne.
[44:08] Amen. Allelujah.
[44:13] [Aplausos]
[44:28] Estamos contentos por las iglesias que
[44:30] han venido en esta
[44:35] noche con los jóvenes y a la iglesia
[44:37] local.
[44:41] Queremos entrar directamente a la
[44:42] palabra en esta noche, esta
[44:47] tarde. Toman sus biblias, se ponen de
[44:55] pie otra vez en el libro de Génesis,
[44:57] capítulo
[45:02] 24.
[45:12] Esta mañana paramos en el versículo
[45:18] 9. Quisiéramos iniciar con el verso 10.
[45:30] for all the goods of his were in his
[45:32] hand and he arose and went
[45:35] to
[45:48] the hizo arrodillar los camellos fuera
[45:51] de la ciudad junto al pozo de agua a la
[45:53] hora de la tarde, a la hora en que salen
[45:55] las doncellas por agua.
[46:06] dijo, "Oh Jehová, Dios de mi señor
[46:08] Abraham, dame, te ruego de tener hoy
[46:10] buen encuentro. Haz misericordia con mi
[46:12] señor
[46:20] Abraham. Y aquí yo estoy junto a la
[46:22] fuente de agua y las hijas de los
[46:23] varones que están de esta ciudad salen
[46:25] por agua. And let it come to pass that
[46:28] the dancil to whom thou shall say, let
[46:31] down thy picture, I pray thee, that may
[46:34] drink, and she shall say, drink, and I
[46:36] will give
[46:37] thels drink
[46:48] also. Sea pues, clancella a quien yo
[46:51] diere, "Be tu cántaro, te ruego para que
[46:53] yo beba." Y respondier, bebe y también
[46:55] yo daré de beber a tus camellos, que sea
[46:57] esta que tú has destinado para tu siervo
[47:00] Isaac. En esto conoceré que habrás hecho
[47:02] misericordia con mi Señor.
[47:05] Verso 15.
[47:20] Y aconteció que antes de que él acabase
[47:21] de hablar, he aquí Rebeca que había
[47:23] nacido Betuel, hijo de Milka, mujer de
[47:26] Nacor, hermano de Abraham, la cual salía
[47:29] con su cántaro sobre su hombro.
[47:42] Y la doncella era de aspecto muy
[47:43] hermoso, virgen a la que varón no había
[47:46] conocido, la cual descendió a la fuente,
[47:48] llenó su cántaro y se volvía. Oremos.
[47:52] Querido Señor
[47:54] Jesús, pedimos bendigas tu palabra esta
[47:57] mañana, en esta
[47:59] tarde. Bendice a cada
[48:01] uno. Los comiendo en tu
[48:04] mano. Nos cometemos en tu
[48:07] mano. Estamos aquí para
[48:09] servicio en el nombre de Jesús. Amén.
[48:12] Dios les bendiga. Pueden
[48:16] sentarse rápidamente.
[48:23] Tomamos dos escrituras en el libro de
[48:25] Apocalipsis.
[48:27] En Apocalipsis 219.
[48:37] And there came unto me one of the
[48:42] angels of
[48:51] vino entonces a mí uno de los siete
[48:52] ángeles que tenía las siete copas llenas
[48:55] de las siete plagas postreras y habló
[48:56] conmigo diciendo, "Ven acá, yo te
[48:58] mostraré la desposada, la esposa del
[49:00] cordero."
[49:03] Apocalipsis
[49:05] 22 verso
[49:17] 16. Yo, Jesús, he enviado mi ángel para
[49:20] daros testimonio de estas cosas en las
[49:22] iglesias. Yo soy la raíz y el linaje de
[49:24] David, la estrella resplandeciente de la
[49:26] mañana.
[49:30] Y el espíritu y la esposa dicen, "Ven."
[49:32] Amén.
[49:38] Regreso nuestra escritura en Génesis
[49:42] 24. Así un poquito retrocediendo, así
[49:45] como esta
[49:46] mañana nos dimos cuenta quién era
[49:49] Abraham, quién era Isaac,
[49:52] quién era Eliazar
[49:55] y quién era Rebeca.
[49:58] Nos dijo el profeta de
[50:00] Dios que la
[50:04] Biblia fue escrita en el cielo antes de
[50:06] la fundación del mundo. Puede usted
[50:09] decir
[50:10] amén. Fue
[50:12] preplaneada, fue
[50:17] preescrita con una mente eterna en
[50:23] vista. No fue un libro hecho para ser
[50:25] leído una vez y puesto otra vez.
[50:28] Porque es una palabra eterna.
[50:31] Cuando usted se acerca a la
[50:33] palabra es más
[50:36] profunda. El día de
[50:39] hoy una escritura significa esto para
[50:43] usted, pero en 5 años en
[50:47] tiempo la misma escritura significará
[50:49] algo más
[50:53] grande porque tiene una vista eterna y
[50:56] es un libro escrito para el Dios por el
[50:57] Dios todopoderoso, él mismo. Amén.
[51:01] fue
[51:02] preplaneada,
[51:04] preescrita antes de que llegara
[51:07] aquí. Cuando llega
[51:09] aquí, usted la encuentra en sus
[51:14] manos. Usted sabe entonces los tipos y
[51:18] sombras. Hay un tipo y una
[51:23] sombra y tiene que ver cómo se encuentra
[51:26] o se coloca en su vida a través de la
[51:29] palabra escrita.
[51:34] Llevamos esto un poco más lejos con
[51:35] Isaac y
[51:38] Rebeca. Este caballero
[51:43] Eliazar tenía la tremenda tarea de
[51:45] encontrar una novia para
[51:48] Isaac. Él juró a su
[51:51] maestro de que no iba a tomar una
[51:56] novia de las otras escogencias de
[51:58] mujeres mundanas allí.
[52:01] Pero una dama
[52:03] específica nacida en cierta
[52:10] casa y tiene las calificaciones que
[52:12] tiene que cumplir antes de que la tome
[52:14] como
[52:15] novia. Ahora,
[52:18] Eliazar no está escogiendo novia para él
[52:22] mismo. Está escogiendo una novia para
[52:24] Abraham.
[52:27] Ahora, con esta responsabilidad tan
[52:29] tremenda, él va en
[52:32] oración. Es una decisión
[52:37] tremenda y cada tremenda decisión que
[52:39] usted y yo tenemos que
[52:42] hacer, solo se puede hacer propiamente
[52:45] decisión cuando estamos en nuestras
[52:46] rodillas en
[52:49] oración. La oración siempre es
[52:52] apropiada.
[52:55] A veces la predicación no es
[52:57] apropiada, a veces el cantar no es
[53:01] apropiado, a veces hablamos
[53:03] mucho,
[53:05] ayúdeme, pero
[53:08] oración siempre es
[53:12] apropiado. Cuando Nehemías, que era el
[53:14] copero del
[53:16] rey, él estaba en
[53:20] servidumbre y llegó a la presencia del
[53:23] rey con una con un semblante
[53:26] decaído. Le preguntó el rey, "Neemías,
[53:30] ¿cuál es el
[53:33] problema? Yo escuché que las paredes de
[53:36] mi
[53:37] pueblo están todas
[53:39] caídas. Entonces, es una carga sobre él.
[53:45] Y dice el rey, pues, ¿qué pides
[53:48] tú? Dice la
[53:50] escritura. Entonces oré y luego le
[53:53] respondí al
[53:54] rey. En ese
[53:58] momento, tome su Biblia, Nehemías
[54:01] oró antes de darle al rey lo que él
[54:04] pedía. Oré.
[54:06] Entonces luego le respondí al
[54:09] rey y este hombre
[54:13] Eliazar no era una relación de
[54:17] sangre, pero era un siervo a un
[54:20] verdadero hombre de Dios.
[54:24] Y este
[54:25] ter hombre de Dios, está llamando para
[54:28] que él busque una novia para su
[54:31] hijo. Con esta tremenda
[54:34] responsabilidad, él va en
[54:37] oración y lleva 10 camellos, no cinco,
[54:41] no siete, llevó 10.
[54:45] va a esta
[54:48] ciudad, se encuentra allí en la fuente
[54:50] en el
[54:53] pozo y coloca cada camello allí al lado
[54:56] de la
[54:57] fuente y ya está todo puesto en
[55:00] orden. Y luego él hace una
[55:03] oración y en su
[55:06] oración él está llamando a Dios que
[55:11] responda por amor a Abraham.
[55:15] No solo por amor a
[55:18] él, por causa de la necesidad de su
[55:20] siervo
[55:21] Abraham. Y él hace la
[55:24] oración, dice, "Señor, que
[55:27] sea que a la dama a la que le pida de
[55:32] beber, ofrezca darme de beber a mí y no
[55:35] solo a mí, pero a mis camellos."
[55:37] Y mientras él está
[55:40] orando, la respuesta para
[55:42] usted quiere que el Señor
[55:45] responda. En ocasiones
[55:49] oramos y ni dejamos que eso
[55:53] desarrolle. Queremos que algo pase ahora
[55:55] mismo y queremos al Se tiene que orar y
[55:59] luego
[56:01] esperar, luego encontrar lo que usted
[56:03] quiere en la escritura. Y luego ore otra
[56:05] vez. Y luego espere otra vez. Luego ore
[56:09] otra vez. Luego espere otra
[56:15] vez. Esa oración tiene que desarrollarse
[56:17] entre una oración
[56:19] contestada porque la oración tiene dos
[56:23] partes. Es la oración contestada y la
[56:25] que no es contestada.
[56:30] Él ora la
[56:32] oración y mientras está terminando de
[56:35] orar
[56:37] dice,
[56:38] "Amén." Y aquí viene
[56:42] Rebeca. Cuando él empezó a
[56:46] orar, quería decir que ella ya estaba en
[56:49] camino para aparecer al final de la
[56:51] oración.
[56:53] Oh, él lo trabaja para
[56:55] usted. Él va a hacer que las cosas
[56:57] trabajen para usted. El Señor que
[57:03] servimos dice el Bran que Jesús nunca
[57:06] andaba en
[57:07] apenas porque todo estaba bajo control.
[57:12] Si usted es un
[57:13] creyente, usted tiene que
[57:16] creer que todo está bajo
[57:19] control y todo lo que está
[57:21] aconteciendo, lo que tiene que
[57:24] acontecer y todo lo que está
[57:27] aconteciendo antes que yo sabía que iba
[57:29] a pasar. Alabado sea el
[57:32] Señor. En esta
[57:35] oración, aquí viene la amada Rebeca.
[57:38] Ella viene, aquí está el hombre, 10
[57:44] camellos y la Biblia anuncia que ella
[57:46] era una mujer
[57:50] hermosa. Dice la Biblia que era muy
[57:52] hermosa.
[57:56] ¿Correcto? Es el detalle que tenemos que
[58:01] saber. Obviamente está en la
[58:03] palabra, es una una muchacha bonita.
[58:09] La escogencia de la
[58:11] novia, en el mensaje que predicó el
[58:14] hermano
[58:15] BR, dice,
[58:17] "Primero, encuentre
[58:20] carácter y luego si la amas,
[58:24] no que la
[58:26] ames y a ver si si tiene carácter.
[58:30] Pero encuentra el
[58:32] carácter. Luego si la
[58:35] amas, el carácter,
[58:39] belleza es un es un don. Si usted nace
[58:41] bonita, si usted nace
[58:44] bonita o o o apuesto,
[58:50] los apuestos saben que son
[58:54] apuestos, actúan como que
[58:57] no.
[58:59] ¿Saben cómo moverse suficiente? Lo
[59:02] suficiente.
[59:06] Yo sé lo que un canto bueno suena.
[59:11] Yo sé como cuando su piano suena
[59:13] bien, yo no puedo tocar el
[59:16] piano, pero yo sé cómo suena un piano
[59:18] bueno.
[59:21] Entonces, cuánto más
[59:23] que si es malo en el
[59:25] órgano y si es un
[59:27] mal músico, usted no sabe que él sabe
[59:30] que es
[59:34] malo. Las muchachas bonitas saben que
[59:37] son
[59:37] bonitas y en ocasiones es el
[59:41] problema. El hombre que es apuesto sabe
[59:43] que es
[59:45] apuesto y el hombre que tiene un don
[59:47] sabe que tiene don. Aquí está una
[59:49] muchacha
[59:51] bonita, es un don natural para ella.
[59:54] Ella es hermosa, es
[59:56] virgen, pero tiene
[59:59] carácter. Su oración que lo
[1:00:03] oró, si está respondida
[1:00:06] correctamente, le va a mostrar a
[1:00:09] Elías que esta muchacha tiene
[1:00:14] carácter. No dijo cuando ore que le
[1:00:16] Señor, dime el nombre de ella.
[1:00:22] Señor, que ella haga esto, esto y esto y
[1:00:25] ella será aquella.
[1:00:32] Si tiene un
[1:00:34] pañuelo. Oh, sorry.
[1:00:49] Aquí está la prueba para el carácter.
[1:00:51] Ahora sabemos que es
[1:00:54] bonita y cualquiera, cualquier puede
[1:00:56] decirle
[1:00:58] eso. Ella sabe que es hermosa para
[1:01:01] mirar, pero la oración dice esto.
[1:01:05] Señor, que me de
[1:01:12] beber y que ofrezca darle bebida no solo
[1:01:14] a uno de mis camellos, pero a todos mis
[1:01:17] camellos. Regresemos un
[1:01:22] poco. Primero que todo, una muchacha
[1:01:24] bonita no le va a dar agua a un cabello.
[1:01:27] ¿Saben por qué? ¿Saben por qué? Porque
[1:01:31] ella es una muchacha bonita.
[1:01:33] Las muchachas bonitas no le dan agua a
[1:01:35] los
[1:01:41] camellos. Tenemos que encontrar quién
[1:01:42] tiene
[1:01:47] carácter. Y la muchacha que le de un
[1:01:49] camello tiene
[1:01:51] carácter. Pero la que le de a los 10
[1:01:54] camellos, yo quiero que mi hijo la
[1:01:56] conozca a ella.
[1:01:59] Sí, esto esto es esto es serio.
[1:02:05] Una muchacha que le dé agua 10 camellos
[1:02:07] es una muchacha de carácter. Ahora tiene
[1:02:09] que darle
[1:02:10] pago. Ella no se le pidió que lo
[1:02:12] hiciera. Ella
[1:02:15] ofreció. A ver, la escritura
[1:02:17] por tienen biblias. Génesis 24.
[1:02:27] Luego leemos unas citas para ustedes.
[1:02:40] Verso 17.
[1:02:45] Leamos el 16. Me gusta ese detalle.
[1:02:57] La doncella era de aspecto muy hermoso,
[1:02:58] virgen a la que varón no había conocido,
[1:03:00] la cual descendió a la fuente, llenó su
[1:03:02] cántaro y se volvía.
[1:03:10] Entonces el criado corrió hacia ella y
[1:03:11] dijo, "Te ruego que me des de beber un
[1:03:13] poco de agua de tu
[1:03:17] cántaro." Ella respondió, "Bebe, Señor
[1:03:19] mío." Y se dio
[1:03:23] prisa. Y bajó su cántaro sobre su mano y
[1:03:26] le dio a beber.
[1:03:30] Y cuando le dio, acabo de darle de
[1:03:37] beber, dijo también para tus camellos
[1:03:39] sacaré agua hasta que acaben de
[1:03:42] beber. Un
[1:03:46] camello puede tomarse de 20 a 40 galones
[1:03:50] en una vez, de 30 a
[1:03:53] 40 galones de una vez. Está dando agua
[1:03:57] 10 camellos.
[1:03:59] hasta que digan, "Estoy
[1:04:01] lleno." Le está dando agua a 10
[1:04:03] camellos, no a
[1:04:06] uno. Y tampoco le pidió, "¿Puedo darle
[1:04:09] agua a sus
[1:04:10] camellos?" Lo que lo que
[1:04:13] dice, dice, "Yo le daré de beber a tus
[1:04:16] camellos." El
[1:04:18] carácter sabe lo que se necesita que
[1:04:21] hacer y lo hace.
[1:04:25] un un carácter
[1:04:28] bajo. Tiene que pedirles una vez, otra
[1:04:31] vez.
[1:04:33] Fíjese que cuando va a tomar el
[1:04:36] agua dice que se da
[1:04:38] prisa, la hace
[1:04:41] rápidamente. Entonces ve la
[1:04:43] necesidad y cumple la necesidad.
[1:04:49] Hay una necesidad allí que necesita
[1:04:52] ser. Si usted va al hermano y le dice,
[1:04:56] "¿Podría usar unos pocos
[1:04:58] dólares?" Usted ve que él está
[1:05:01] quebrado, que no tiene
[1:05:04] carro. Sabe que él necesita un poco de
[1:05:06] dólares. Por eso hate la
[1:05:09] pregunta. Si ves que lo
[1:05:11] necesita, el carácter no
[1:05:13] pregunta, el carácter simplemente hace.
[1:05:18] Cuando vio que los camellos necesitaban
[1:05:21] agua, dijo, "Yo le daré agua a tus
[1:05:24] camellos."
[1:05:30] Ven la diferencia de carácter. No solo
[1:05:32] es
[1:05:34] hermosa, pero tiene la habilidad ahora
[1:05:37] de humillarse a sí mismo y darle agua a
[1:05:40] los camellos.
[1:05:43] Y ni siquiera
[1:05:45] sabía que esos camellos le pertenecían a
[1:05:48] ella.
[1:05:53] Es
[1:05:55] correcto. Si hubiera leído la parte de
[1:05:57] atrás del libro o el fin de la
[1:06:01] historia, esa muchacha va a montar los
[1:06:04] mismos
[1:06:05] camellos, pero no puede decirle eso
[1:06:07] ahora.
[1:06:09] El carácter tiene que salir
[1:06:11] primero. Cuando encontramos el
[1:06:14] carácter, entonces podemos hablar de
[1:06:16] quién es la novia.
[1:06:22] Vamos un poco más
[1:06:25] adelante. Ella le da agua a los 10
[1:06:28] camellos, le da agua al siervo.
[1:06:39] Dice la Biblia quear solo se echa hacia
[1:06:42] atrás un poquito.
[1:06:46] Si pudiera darle un cinco a alguien, se
[1:06:48] lo daría.
[1:06:50] Porque es una mayor oración respondida
[1:06:53] así de
[1:06:54] rápido. Ni siquiera terminé de orar y mi
[1:06:58] respuesta estaba
[1:06:59] ahí. Oh, me siento como adorando a Dios.
[1:07:03] Me siento como dándole la gloria. Pero
[1:07:05] se esperó un poquito, hizo la
[1:07:09] pregunta, ¿quién eres? ¿Y de qué casa
[1:07:12] naciste? Algo está
[1:07:15] edificando. Ahora se da cuenta quién es
[1:07:17] ella.
[1:07:19] y coincide con su oración. Es
[1:07:22] hermosa, es es
[1:07:24] hermosa. Le dio agua
[1:07:29] los relación directa con mi maestro. Oh,
[1:07:33] esto es
[1:07:37] completo. Momento de celebrar.
[1:07:45] Es un DM5.
[1:07:51] Puedes hacer eso.
[1:07:52] [Aplausos]
[1:07:55] Eso es lo que estaba pasando en su Oh,
[1:07:58] sí. Tengo la respuesta de mi oración.
[1:08:02] Estoy listo para
[1:08:03] irme. Ahora es una muchacha de carácter.
[1:08:06] Si dice eso, digámosle a mi familia lo
[1:08:10] que lo que transfirió.
[1:08:13] va a la casa de su
[1:08:14] familia, le dice este
[1:08:16] hombre, le dice, "¿Quién es
[1:08:19] él? ¿Cuál es su
[1:08:21] misión?" Y ella está de acuerdo en
[1:08:24] ir. Aquí hay una cosa extraña.
[1:08:28] Ahora, si tomas sus
[1:08:32] biblias, el mismo capítulo
[1:08:39] 24, verso 50.
[1:08:51] Entonces yuel respondieron y dijeron,
[1:08:53] "De Jehová ha salido esto, no podemos
[1:08:55] hablar hablarte malo ni bueno."
[1:08:58] 51.
[1:09:08] He aquí, Rebeca, delante de ti, tómala y
[1:09:10] vete. Será mujer del hijo de tu señor
[1:09:12] como lo ha dicho
[1:09:13] Jehová. Todos estuvieron de acuerdo.
[1:09:16] Verso
[1:09:25] 52. Cuando el criado Abraham oyó las
[1:09:28] palabras, se inclinó en la tierra ante
[1:09:30] Jehová.
[1:09:41] Y sacó el criado aljas de plata, alajas
[1:09:44] de oro y vestidos y dio a Rebeca.
[1:09:45] También dio cosas preciosas a su hermano
[1:09:47] y a su
[1:09:55] madre. Y comieron y bebieron él y los
[1:09:57] varones que venían con él y durmieron. Y
[1:10:00] levantándose de mañana dijo, "Envíame a
[1:10:02] mi
[1:10:02] señor." Verso
[1:10:14] 55. Entonces respondieron su hermano y
[1:10:17] su madre, "Espera que la con nosotros a
[1:10:19] lo menos 10 días y después irá."
[1:10:28] Y les dijo, "No me detengas, ya que
[1:10:29] Jehová ha prosperado mi camino. Despách
[1:10:32] para que me vaya a mi
[1:10:34] Señor." Aquí
[1:10:37] entonces la respuesta a la oración ha
[1:10:40] llegado. Es la familia
[1:10:43] correcta. Dios obró en ambos
[1:10:47] lados. Yo hice mi obra como
[1:10:50] Eliaer. Yo vi quién es ella.
[1:10:53] Ahora es tiempo de
[1:10:55] irnos en el tiempo de
[1:10:59] decisión, cuando Dios se revela a sí
[1:11:01] mismo, a
[1:11:02] usted hay un
[1:11:07] dicho que
[1:11:09] dice, "Doble
[1:11:13] el doble el
[1:11:15] metal cuando está
[1:11:17] caliente. No lo puedes doblar cuando
[1:11:19] está
[1:11:20] frío, pero cuando está caliente lo
[1:11:22] puedes
[1:11:23] doblar. Es el tiempo de hacer la movida.
[1:11:27] Ahora su oración está
[1:11:30] respondida. Viene la mamá y el
[1:11:33] hermano.
[1:11:35] Espérense. Ahora es una trampa ahora
[1:11:38] porque un
[1:11:39] día se vuelven 5 días, luego 10
[1:11:44] días se vuelve 20 días.
[1:11:47] La la la oración ha sido respuesta. Yo
[1:11:49] sé quién es ella. Es tiempo de
[1:11:54] ir. Pero la mamá y el hermano le dieron
[1:11:56] un
[1:11:58] problema. En este momento aquí, este
[1:12:01] momento
[1:12:03] aquí dice Branam, un real siervo de
[1:12:07] Dios, él conoce su
[1:12:10] comisión y él lo sostiene a esa
[1:12:12] decisión.
[1:12:15] Ahora él pone la
[1:12:17] presión, dice, "No puedo esperar 10
[1:12:20] días. Es más, no puedo esperar dos
[1:12:22] días. La oración ha sido
[1:12:25] respondida. Es tiempo de
[1:12:28] ir. Mi misión es
[1:12:31] completa. No, no, que espere 10
[1:12:34] días. Ahora me preguntaba, ¿qué es
[1:12:36] esto?"
[1:12:39] Dice, "Hermano Branham en el mensaje,
[1:12:40] tiempo de decisión", dice él. Ah.
[1:12:49] tiempo de
[1:12:58] decisión.
[1:13:00] Fíjese en la en la
[1:13:05] superseñal, fíjese, él tuvo que lidiar
[1:13:07] con dos gentes
[1:13:09] diferentes. Hablando de
[1:13:11] Eliazar, ella tenía familia.
[1:13:15] Pero el único con el que Eliasar tenía
[1:13:17] que
[1:13:18] lidiar fue con la mamá
[1:13:21] y su y el hermano de
[1:13:24] Rebeca, pero él iba tras esa
[1:13:28] novia. Le dijo Abraham, "Ve y toma una
[1:13:32] novia de entre mi pueblo.
[1:13:39] No tome una de estas extranjeras por una
[1:13:41] novia.
[1:13:43] Que si que si la mujer no
[1:13:46] viene, si ella no viene, estás libre de
[1:13:48] este
[1:13:51] juramento. Luego puso su mano en su
[1:13:54] muslo y
[1:13:56] juró que Eliazar, fíjese que él encontró
[1:13:59] la
[1:13:59] mujer. É sabía que era
[1:14:03] ella y fíjese, tuvo que lidiar con dos
[1:14:07] personas, con su
[1:14:09] mamá y con el hermano.
[1:14:13] padre y el
[1:14:14] resto no tenía nada que decir, pero la
[1:14:18] mamá y el
[1:14:21] hermano también el
[1:14:24] mensajero, el Espíritu Santo de Dios, en
[1:14:27] este último
[1:14:29] día tomando una
[1:14:34] novia, tuvo que lidiar con la iglesia
[1:14:36] que se llamao la madre, la
[1:14:39] católica, y el hermano
[1:14:43] El
[1:14:45] predicador es
[1:14:48] exactamente tenía que lidiar con estos
[1:14:51] dos. Entonces, regresemos un
[1:14:54] poco en nuestra escena aquí.
[1:14:58] Abraham era tipo de ¿quién?
[1:15:02] Dios del padre.
[1:15:05] ¿Quién era el hijo? Isaac. tipo
[1:15:08] de Jesucristo.
[1:15:12] Elar es un tipo de
[1:15:16] el hermano Branham
[1:15:18] en el mensaje avergonzado dice
[1:15:21] eso. Tuvo que encontrar
[1:15:25] esto, pero el mensaje le dijo que él era
[1:15:27] el Eliasar.
[1:15:30] Si el hermano Branham es Eliazar,
[1:15:32] entonces, ¿quién es Rebeca?
[1:15:35] Rebeca.
[1:15:39] los que siguen el mensaje de
[1:15:41] Eliazar. Y
[1:15:44] Eliazar tuvo que lidiar con dos
[1:15:46] personas, dos
[1:15:48] personas en llamando una novia. Era la
[1:15:52] mamá y el
[1:15:55] hermano, la madre
[1:15:57] iglesia y el hermano el
[1:16:01] predicador. Y si yo he visto más
[1:16:03] problemas en cualquier cosa, no solo
[1:16:06] predicadores, eso muchas de las
[1:16:11] iglesias. Si usted pone sus ojos en el
[1:16:13] predicador o las
[1:16:15] iglesias, usted definitivamente va a
[1:16:17] estar desanimado. Usted encuentra falta.
[1:16:20] Usted encuentra una razón de
[1:16:23] rendirse de de
[1:16:26] cuitear. Hay hay cualquier tipo de
[1:16:30] fallas. Hay muchas fallas entre los
[1:16:32] hermanos
[1:16:34] predicadores. Pero, ¿hay alguna falla
[1:16:36] con Eliazar?
[1:16:39] No, en el
[1:16:43] mensaje estaba hablando con alguien de
[1:16:45] este mensaje,
[1:16:48] no digo con otra gente del
[1:16:50] mensaje o yo les digo lo que dice el
[1:16:54] mensaje, lo que dijo el mensaje el
[1:16:56] profeta, la
[1:16:58] palabra. Se lleva a alguien a
[1:17:01] Cristo, usted no los lleva a otros
[1:17:04] cristianos, usted lo lleva a Cristo la
[1:17:06] palabra.
[1:17:08] Estaba en una discusión con un
[1:17:10] caballero,
[1:17:12] en un hombre de la del séptimo día
[1:17:13] dentista,
[1:17:16] estaba
[1:17:20] hablando que la Biblia tantos errores y
[1:17:22] cuál es correcto y cuál
[1:17:24] no. Dije, "¿Qué Biblia usas
[1:17:29] tú? Si es un si es un cristiano joven,
[1:17:33] yo le doy este tipo de Biblia.
[1:17:37] Y si es un cristiano mayor, yo le doy
[1:17:39] este tipo de
[1:17:41] Biblia. Eso suena confuso para mí.
[1:17:45] Dije, "¿Qué sigues tú?
[1:17:50] Yo creo que Dios envió un profeta en
[1:17:51] estos días.
[1:17:53] Su nombre es William Branham. ¿Sabe qué
[1:17:55] hizo él?
[1:17:57] se enojó
[1:17:58] conmigo. Dijo, "Usted es
[1:18:01] gente con su
[1:18:03] retrato. Un momento,
[1:18:07] apenas te conocimos en una pelquería.
[1:18:09] Apenas te conocí
[1:18:12] y di usted es gente,
[1:18:14] apenas nos conocimos."
[1:18:18] Dije, "No hablemos de de ustedes
[1:18:21] gente. Yo no lo estoy llevando un grupo
[1:18:23] de
[1:18:24] gente. Yo quiero que me muestre por la
[1:18:27] palabra, donde por la palabra lo llevé a
[1:18:30] la escritura.
[1:18:32] Jesús
[1:18:34] dijo, "Si no puede creer en mis obras,
[1:18:38] si no quiere no cree mis
[1:18:41] palabras, entonces crean en mis
[1:18:44] obras, porque mis obras ellas hacen qué
[1:18:49] dan testimonio de quién soy
[1:18:51] yo." Si usted no cree mi
[1:18:53] doctrina, entonces crea en las obras.
[1:18:58] Y estaba discutiendo con él.
[1:19:01] Él fue al su
[1:19:03] carro y trajo un montón de libros de
[1:19:05] este tamaño,
[1:19:10] lo puso allí en la
[1:19:13] barbería y yo tengo estos libros.
[1:19:16] dijo, "Yo no voy a escutir con la
[1:19:18] escritura, solo muéstrame un
[1:19:21] hombre que tuvo un
[1:19:25] ministerio como el
[1:19:27] ministerio, pero las obras
[1:19:32] solamente cualquier hombre en o fuera
[1:19:35] denominación que tenga esas
[1:19:37] obras, podemos discutir doctrina, lo que
[1:19:42] queramos, pero las obras dan testimonio.
[1:19:46] Las obras dan
[1:19:48] testimonio del tipo de ministerio que
[1:19:51] era. Entonces,
[1:19:53] Eliazar tenía el
[1:19:55] reto de mantener esa
[1:19:58] novia y en en paso con su mensaje y la
[1:20:02] mamá y el
[1:20:04] hermano querían
[1:20:06] impedir, dice el profeta de Dios.
[1:20:09] Entonces, como el
[1:20:12] mensajero, el Espíritu de Dios en este
[1:20:14] último
[1:20:15] día tomando una
[1:20:19] novia, tuvo que llamar lidiar con la
[1:20:22] iglesia que se llama la madre
[1:20:25] católica y el hermano, el
[1:20:28] predicador es
[1:20:30] exactamente, tenía que lidiar con estos
[1:20:33] dos.
[1:20:35] Ellos fueron los que tiraron pataleta al
[1:20:40] respecto. Ahora, si usted es
[1:20:42] Rebeca, aquí está ella.
[1:20:46] está encontrando un hombre por primera
[1:20:49] vez y este hombre le dice a
[1:20:57] ella que ella tiene un
[1:21:01] novio, un un
[1:21:03] novio para que ella se case con
[1:21:07] él y le describe a ella como quién es
[1:21:10] Isaac.
[1:21:13] Ella no podía entrar a Facebook,
[1:21:16] no fue allá al
[1:21:20] match.com. Estamos a ver si sí o no.
[1:21:28] Tantas cualidades a ver si podemos hacer
[1:21:30] esto funcionar
[1:21:34] científicamente. Cuando naciste tú,
[1:21:36] cuando nací
[1:21:37] yo, ¿saben cómo lo hacen hoy?
[1:21:40] Ella no tenía
[1:21:42] esto. Ella solo tenía la palabra de
[1:21:45] Eliazar. Y
[1:21:47] aquí dijo, pregúntale a la muchacha si
[1:21:52] irás con este
[1:21:55] hombre, si estás
[1:21:58] anhelando de dejar la comodidad de tu
[1:22:01] hogar, tu mamá y tu
[1:22:04] papá. Todo lo que amas está
[1:22:06] aquí, todo lo que sabes está aquí.
[1:22:10] y estás
[1:22:12] anhelando irse con este
[1:22:14] hombre. Puede ser un
[1:22:17] fraude. No sabemos quién
[1:22:20] sea. Y pusieron la decisión en en en
[1:22:25] ella y esa
[1:22:28] decisión está puesta en nosotros
[1:22:31] hoy. Ahora, mira quién está
[1:22:33] aquí. ¿Está usted
[1:22:36] anhelando? ¿Está usted dispuesto a
[1:22:38] sacrificar las cosas del mundo para ir a
[1:22:41] otra
[1:22:42] tierra a que ver un hombre que usted
[1:22:44] nunca conocí?
[1:22:47] que usted no sabe nada de él, pero usted
[1:22:49] está
[1:22:50] anhelando y dispuesto a dar su
[1:22:53] vida por este sueño, por este sueño de
[1:22:58] ir al
[1:22:59] cielo. Ahora, no todos pueden hacer
[1:23:02] eso. Y fueron a probarlo. Dio,
[1:23:06] pruébame. Yo nunca he estado en el
[1:23:08] cielo. Yo nunca he visto a Jesús. He
[1:23:11] visto retratos.
[1:23:13] He visto la columna de fuego, pero nunca
[1:23:15] he visto al hombre. Él nunca me ha dado
[1:23:17] la mano. Yo no lo he conocido aún, pero
[1:23:21] algo en mi
[1:23:22] corazón, gloria, pero algo en mi
[1:23:26] alma me
[1:23:28] hace hacer la decisión
[1:23:31] correcta de decir lo que dijo Rebeca.
[1:23:34] Yo iré.
[1:23:39] Irás, irás tú.
[1:23:42] Yo
[1:23:44] iré a un lugar que no he ido antes. Yo
[1:23:49] iré a ver un hombre que nunca has visto
[1:23:51] antes.
[1:23:54] iré y yo pongo mi
[1:23:57] vida y yo pongo mi
[1:24:00] orgullo y pongo mi
[1:24:03] prestigio y vendo
[1:24:05] todo, doy
[1:24:08] todo para ir en este.
[1:24:11] Yo iré.
[1:24:13] irá
[1:24:14] usted parece ridículo
[1:24:17] para
[1:24:18] Rebeca de dejar su hogar para ir a un
[1:24:22] lugar que nunca ha estado antes, nunca
[1:24:25] conoció a este hombre
[1:24:27] antes. Pero es tan
[1:24:30] ridículo como
[1:24:31] usted de decir que va al
[1:24:35] cielo. ¿Ha estado usted en un rapto?
[1:24:39] Su cuerpo ha sido cambiado.
[1:24:43] Es todo un sueño.
[1:24:48] Contrólese, muchacha. Rebeca, ¿para
[1:24:51] dónde vas?
[1:24:53] ¿Quieres entregar todo?
[1:24:56] Parar de
[1:24:57] fumar, parar de beber,
[1:25:01] vas a dejar que tu cabello
[1:25:04] crezca. Vas a lavarle los pies a los
[1:25:06] santos.
[1:25:09] al a la iglesia el domingo en la noche o
[1:25:12] el miércoles de la
[1:25:13] noche. Oh, ¿qué pasa,
[1:25:16] muchacha? Póngase a
[1:25:21] ni siquiera sabes si es una historia
[1:25:23] verdadera. Pero Rebeca
[1:25:27] dijo, cazó el mismo
[1:25:29] carácter, fue el mismo
[1:25:32] carácter de de cuando alimentó los
[1:25:35] camellos.
[1:25:37] Le alimenté a 10
[1:25:39] cabellos, recibí los dones y
[1:25:42] ahora estoy lista para
[1:25:45] irme. Estoy lista para irme con el
[1:25:48] hombre, con el que nunca ha ido
[1:25:51] antes. ¿Puedo o ir poco más?
[1:25:58] Rebeca era la hija del del sobrino de
[1:26:01] Abraham.
[1:26:03] El hermano de Abraham tenía un
[1:26:06] hijo y ese hijo tenía una
[1:26:10] hija y esa hija era
[1:26:14] Rebeca y estaban
[1:26:16] relacionados, relacionados por
[1:26:19] sangre. Y aquí está
[1:26:22] ella, viene y y le da beber a los
[1:26:25] camellos.
[1:26:27] Ahora miremos a darle agua a los
[1:26:29] camellos, porque en darle de beber a los
[1:26:34] camellos habla de un asunto de carácter
[1:26:37] allí. Esta palabra
[1:26:40] carácter es el
[1:26:45] atributos o o las cosas que que lo
[1:26:48] componen a usted, quién es usted, ese es
[1:26:51] su
[1:26:52] carácter.
[1:26:54] Gracia es un don.
[1:26:57] Eso es
[1:26:58] correcto. La gracia es un es un
[1:27:01] don, pero las
[1:27:04] palabras, las
[1:27:07] obras de lo que usted hace en
[1:27:09] apreciación al al
[1:27:11] don. Santiago
[1:27:13] dice, "Muéstrame tus
[1:27:15] obras y muestra tu
[1:27:18] fe." Pablo dijo, "Muéstrame tu fe y
[1:27:22] prueba tus obras."
[1:27:24] Dice hero Branam que
[1:27:27] Pablo estaba hablando como Dios vio a
[1:27:30] Abraham. Dijo que
[1:27:33] Santiago estaba hablando como el hombre
[1:27:35] se ve Abraham.
[1:27:37] Gracia es lo que Dios le da a usted.
[1:27:43] Obras es lo que usted hace en
[1:27:45] apreciación a él.
[1:27:49] obras son asuntos específicos del
[1:27:54] carácter. Si sus obras no son correctas
[1:27:56] es porque su carácter no es correcto, no
[1:27:58] es un
[1:27:59] don. Su
[1:28:01] carácter es lo que usted
[1:28:03] hace cuando usted no tiene que hacer. Su
[1:28:08] carácter las cosas que usted
[1:28:11] hace de las que usted no está obligado a
[1:28:13] hacer, pero usted las hace de todas
[1:28:15] maneras. Usted
[1:28:17] llega, usted va a la milla extra, usted
[1:28:20] hace lo que debe de hacer, son
[1:28:23] obras. Eso no lo
[1:28:25] salvan, salvo por
[1:28:28] gracia, pero de
[1:28:30] apreciación de usted está tan
[1:28:33] apreciado que usted lo hace. ¿Usted
[1:28:37] quiere vivir correcto?
[1:28:50] Obras están en
[1:28:52] usted, no están en
[1:28:55] Dios. La gracia de Dios te dio a
[1:28:59] ustedes. Gracias. Lo que Dios hizo por
[1:29:01] usted, nadie más lo
[1:29:03] hizo. Pero la manera que usted le
[1:29:07] sirve, habla el tipo de carácter que
[1:29:09] usted tiene.
[1:29:11] No todos se quieren quedar, no se
[1:29:14] quieren quedar,
[1:29:15] no quieren
[1:29:17] orar, no todos quieren llegar
[1:29:20] temprano, no todos quieren esta milla
[1:29:23] extra, pero Rebeca con
[1:29:26] carácter no esperaba a que se le
[1:29:29] pidiera. Ella lo
[1:29:31] hacía porque el carácter en ella, ella
[1:29:35] fue levantada correctamente. Su carácter
[1:29:37] era
[1:29:38] correcto cuando vio los cabellos.
[1:29:41] Ella no se movió
[1:29:42] así. Usted le pedí a alguien que haga
[1:29:47] algo. Okay. Oh, está bien.
[1:29:51] Yo lo hago.
[1:29:58] Y así es. Así es. Usted le dice a a un
[1:30:03] adolescente que limpie su cuarto,
[1:30:06] como que es su cuarto,
[1:30:09] como que usted hizo el desorden.
[1:30:14] Saque la
[1:30:17] basura a levantar
[1:30:20] leche. ¿Saben cómo cómo lo hacen?
[1:30:27] Así sirve mucha gente al
[1:30:29] Señor iglesia y
[1:30:34] si me
[1:30:38] mueva que me vas a bendecir esta
[1:30:42] mañana. No puedes decir nada que me haga
[1:30:44] decir amén.
[1:30:46] vienen a la
[1:30:49] iglesia como que están en un cuarto de
[1:30:51] espera en el
[1:30:53] dentista, como que le van a sacar los
[1:30:55] dientes. Pero esta no es Rebeca ahora.
[1:30:58] Rebeca está buscando por los camellos.
[1:31:02] Ella está
[1:31:03] buscando, está buscando.
[1:31:07] [Aplausos]
[1:31:09] El
[1:31:10] carácter hace
[1:31:13] cosas sin tener que le digan todo el
[1:31:15] tiempo el
[1:31:17] carácter. Encuentran los camos. Oh, aquí
[1:31:19] hay un camo. Yo quiero darle
[1:31:22] agua. ¿Quién le dijo que le agua? Nadie
[1:31:25] le dijo. Yo me dije a mí, dale agua a
[1:31:28] los camellos.
[1:31:29] Dale al camello. Dale agua al
[1:31:31] camello. Dale agua al
[1:31:33] camello. 10
[1:31:37] camellos. Eso es carácter.
[1:31:43] Yo lo hago.
[1:31:48] ¿Cuánto me pagas por ahora? ¿Sabes cómo
[1:31:52] es? ¿Y qué hay para mí?
[1:31:57] Rebeca lo hace por lo que quién es
[1:32:00] ella. Ella viene a la casa del
[1:32:04] Señor buscando por una oportunidad para
[1:32:06] decir
[1:32:08] amén,
[1:32:09] buscando para para
[1:32:11] adorar. Ella busca por
[1:32:14] ungimiento para que llegue sobre ella,
[1:32:17] para adorar al
[1:32:18] Señor. El espíritu y en verdad. Esa es
[1:32:22] Rebeca.
[1:32:23] Eso es
[1:32:26] carácter. Los los los directores de Ces
[1:32:28] aman a Rebeca.
[1:32:38] Usted no tiene que decirle a Rebeca que
[1:32:40] levante la mano. Ella va a levantar su
[1:32:43] mano. Ella va a darle la alabanza a
[1:32:45] Dios. Sí.
[1:32:48] El
[1:32:48] carácter lo
[1:32:51] hace porque necesita ser hecho el
[1:32:54] carácter. Lo
[1:32:56] hace porque es una oportunidad de hacer.
[1:33:00] No tiene que es una
[1:33:02] oportunidad. Si vamos un poco más
[1:33:04] adelante.
[1:33:06] Aquí está Rebeca.
[1:33:13] Yo
[1:33:14] pienso que la hermosa
[1:33:17] Rebeca esta
[1:33:18] tarde dándole agua a los
[1:33:21] camellos, dándole agua a lo
[1:33:25] mismo que la iba a llevar.
[1:33:28] Ven, es lo que es el agua y el
[1:33:34] camello. Representan
[1:33:38] poder. La iglesia del Dios viviente
[1:33:42] hoy se
[1:33:45] regocija e dándole agua al poder del
[1:33:47] Espíritu
[1:33:49] Santo, que la levantará un
[1:33:52] día y llevarla al más allá donde está
[1:33:55] Isaac.
[1:33:58] Allí en el aire para las bodas del
[1:34:03] cordero. ¿Cómo es que Dios obra en ambas
[1:34:07] partes? Aquí está vaciando todo lo que
[1:34:09] tiene y dándole agua a los
[1:34:12] camellos. Le da agua uno, le da agua
[1:34:16] dos, le da agua
[1:34:18] tres. ¿Qué hora es? Le da agua
[1:34:21] cuatro. Agua cinco todavía en la
[1:34:24] iglesia.
[1:34:25] Le agua seis, le agua a
[1:34:28] siete. Oh, no está
[1:34:30] acabado. No es que
[1:34:34] yo no he acabado
[1:34:37] todavía. Yo tengo el agua
[1:34:39] [Aplausos]
[1:34:40] aquí. Yo tengo que darle agua a mis
[1:34:43] camellos. Yo tengo que darle honra. Y si
[1:34:46] hay 10
[1:34:47] camellos, voy a estar aquí toda la noche
[1:34:50] dándole agua a los camellos.
[1:34:53] Porque los camellos que les doy agua, un
[1:34:56] día me van a llevar de
[1:34:59] aquí. Una
[1:35:01] mañana entre las 7 y las 6 y las 9 va a
[1:35:07] venir y va a llevarse a la novia y
[1:35:10] llevarla allí.
[1:35:12] [Aplausos]
[1:35:18] Dele
[1:35:19] agua, agua.
[1:35:22] Dele la alabanza,
[1:35:25] dele la adoración.
[1:35:27] Gloria.
[1:35:40] En el libro de la vida.
[1:35:43] Ella en realidad era dueña de los
[1:35:45] camellos.
[1:35:47] le perteneciera a
[1:35:48] ella antes de la fundación del
[1:35:51] mundo, pero tuvo que cumplir esta parte
[1:35:55] y cuando
[1:35:56] volteó y se da cuenta que yo soy la
[1:36:00] novia, yo soy una novia de
[1:36:04] Isaac. ¿Cómo se ve él? ¿Qué tan alto es
[1:36:08] él? Oh, dígame más de él.
[1:36:11] Y luego
[1:36:12] Eliazar empieza a decirle a
[1:36:15] Rebeca lo que de qué se trata Isaac. Y
[1:36:18] en el
[1:36:19] camino de regreso al
[1:36:22] hogar est ella está montando en el
[1:36:25] poder, está montando en el
[1:36:27] poder que la trae en la presencia del
[1:36:31] rey y lo ve a él y ella salta del
[1:36:35] camello y lo encuentra allí en el
[1:36:38] aire. Amor a primera vista.
[1:36:41] Isaac y
[1:36:42] Rebeca vivieron feliz todo el tiempo.
[1:36:47] [Aplausos]
[1:36:51] Adórele, dele adoración a él. Amén.
[1:36:56] [Aplausos]
[1:37:02] Gloria. El profeta de Dios dice esto en
[1:37:04] preguntas y respuestas.
[1:37:07] El mismo
[1:37:08] camello, el mismo
[1:37:11] poder. La bestia en la Biblia representa
[1:37:16] poder. Y el poder al que le damos agua
[1:37:18] de adoración y
[1:37:20] alabanza, agua, vida, alabanza a la
[1:37:24] palabra, es la misma
[1:37:27] cosa que nos van a llevar a la
[1:37:30] gloria, a encontrarnos con el novio.
[1:37:34] Ahora, alguna
[1:37:35] gente no quieren darle agua a los
[1:37:38] camellos, pero quieren irse en el rapto.
[1:37:41] Pero el
[1:37:43] espíritu del que usted adora y y le da
[1:37:46] alabanza, ese es el
[1:37:48] espíritu que lo lleva a usted en el
[1:37:50] rapto. ¿No es eso
[1:37:52] maravilloso? Ahora,
[1:37:55] ¿quién es Rebeca?
[1:37:59] Si usted es
[1:38:02] Rebeca, usted tiene que ser
[1:38:05] profesional que le da agua a los
[1:38:07] camellos
[1:38:09] profesionalmente, porque la
[1:38:11] novia es la única que va en el rapto y
[1:38:16] el poder del rapto era el
[1:38:20] camello. Y ella le dio alabanza al
[1:38:23] camello al darle de beber. ¿Sabe usted
[1:38:26] cómo
[1:38:28] adorar? ¿Usted sabe cómo cómo dar
[1:38:31] adoración? Tenemos que decirles todo el
[1:38:34] tiempo, tenemos que decirles que
[1:38:36] aparezcan
[1:38:37] temprano o que oren todo el
[1:38:41] tiempo. No deberíamos
[1:38:43] de el carácter lo
[1:38:46] hace porque necesita ser
[1:38:50] hecho. Yo hablé esta
[1:38:53] mañana mientras cierro.
[1:39:01] Como en Marcos
[1:39:04] 16, Dios nos dio a todos una gran
[1:39:06] comisión.
[1:39:10] Si en la visión de la
[1:39:14] novia, el hermano Branham se sintió
[1:39:16] responsable por la
[1:39:19] iglesia, que se presentó como el grupo
[1:39:23] mundano. Dijo,
[1:39:27] "Señor, ese es lo mejor que nosotros
[1:39:29] ministros podemos hacer."
[1:39:32] y se sintió
[1:39:35] avergonzado como que si le hubiese
[1:39:37] fallado a Dios, pero no lo hizo.
[1:39:40] la carga que él tenía.
[1:39:45] Cuando usted piensa en el mundo
[1:39:47] morimundo y y
[1:39:50] nosotros que somos parte de este gran
[1:39:52] mensaje de la
[1:39:56] hora, si usted vio a un bebé de estos
[1:40:02] autopistas con una bola en en su en su
[1:40:06] mano, jugando a la orilla del camino de
[1:40:09] la carretera,
[1:40:12] Usted estaría moralmente
[1:40:15] obligado de parar su
[1:40:18] vehículo y ir y salvar ese bebé.
[1:40:22] No importa quién
[1:40:24] era, si era blanco o negro o
[1:40:29] café, que no fuese
[1:40:32] cristiano, solo usted moralmente
[1:40:35] obligado. Si usted está en un
[1:40:37] barco y ve a alguien
[1:40:42] ahogándose, es su obligación moral como
[1:40:45] ser humano de tratar de salvar esa
[1:40:49] persona. Esto es solo siendo seres
[1:40:52] humanos. Ahora, ¿qué qué de ser
[1:40:55] cristianos? ¿Qué ser miembros de la
[1:40:58] novia? El profeta de Dios
[1:41:01] dice que él no fue al
[1:41:05] infierno. Él fue a las regiones de los
[1:41:09] perdidos y
[1:41:11] regresó y nos
[1:41:15] dijo, "Usted no quiere que su peor
[1:41:17] enemigo vaya allí.
[1:41:20] Y usted ha visto esta
[1:41:22] gente que son como un bebé que se está
[1:41:25] ahogando y sabemos cuál es la verdad
[1:41:28] nosotros, pero hemos perdido nuestra
[1:41:33] carga y la novia real de
[1:41:37] Jesucristo
[1:41:39] definitivamente que ella es la novia,
[1:41:42] ella tiene una carga en su corazón por
[1:41:45] los
[1:41:46] perdidos, por el Espíritu Santo.
[1:41:48] por la palabra de
[1:41:50] Dios. Ella no deja que ninguna iglesia
[1:41:52] se interponga, que ningún predicador se
[1:41:56] interponga. Ella es la
[1:41:58] novia, ella tiene
[1:42:00] carácter y su
[1:42:04] carácter lo hace parar su
[1:42:06] vacación para salvar a un hombre si es
[1:42:10] lo que se requiere.
[1:42:14] Oye, no estaba esperando salvarle la
[1:42:15] vida a nadie
[1:42:17] hoy. Voy a divertirme. Es
[1:42:21] vacación. Usted está moralmente
[1:42:23] obligado de parar su
[1:42:25] vacación y salvar a ese hombre, salvar a
[1:42:29] ese
[1:42:30] bebé. ¿Qué usted y yo, novia de Cristo?
[1:42:34] Queremos irnos en el
[1:42:36] rapto. Creemos que nos vamos en el
[1:42:40] rapto. Pero hay hay una carga y una vida
[1:42:43] que tiene que
[1:42:44] encajar. Ustedes
[1:42:46] jóvenes, ¿qué quieren hacer?
[1:42:51] Lo que quieren hacer es dedicar su vida
[1:42:53] al Señor
[1:42:54] Jesucristo y pedirle a
[1:42:58] él que tome no solo los dones que les ha
[1:43:02] dado, pero que moldee un carácter en
[1:43:06] ustedes. Porque el
[1:43:08] carácter no es un don.
[1:43:12] carácter. El carácter es una
[1:43:16] virtud, algo por lo que usted
[1:43:19] pelea, algo por lo que usted
[1:43:22] corrige. Y
[1:43:25] Jesús
[1:43:26] regresa por una
[1:43:29] novia que no solo tiene
[1:43:31] talento, que no solo es
[1:43:34] hermosa, no es solo limpia y
[1:43:37] bonita, pero él
[1:43:41] regresa una novia que tiene
[1:43:43] carácter,
[1:43:50] carácter. Y le pedimos que Dios conceda
[1:43:52] eso a
[1:43:54] ustedes. Algunos de ustedes jóvenes se
[1:43:56] empiezan a ser
[1:43:58] mayores y pueden ir a tener tiempo
[1:44:01] solos y nadie los ve ahora.
[1:44:05] El
[1:44:06] carácter lo hace hacer lo que es
[1:44:08] correcto cuando nadie está vigilando.
[1:44:12] Eso es
[1:44:15] carácter. Pídale a Dios que ponga en
[1:44:17] usted el carácter de
[1:44:20] Jesucristo. Muchos grandes oradores en
[1:44:23] nuestro
[1:44:25] día, pero nunca ha habido un carácter
[1:44:27] como el Señor
[1:44:28] Jesucristo. Y ese es el
[1:44:30] carácter que queremos tener. Amén.
[1:44:34] Dios los
[1:44:35] bendiga. No solo un don, pero carácter.
[1:44:40] Dios los
[1:44:42] [Aplausos]
[1:45:00] [Aplausos]
[1:45:06] bendiga. Alaba a Dios.
[1:45:11] Can you just worship him with me and
[1:45:13] tell him how great he
[1:45:20] [Música]
[1:45:25] is? Dios no
[1:45:28] rechaza oración.
[1:45:32] Oraciones,
[1:45:38] [Música]
[1:45:40] alimento. Nunca vi un justo sin
[1:45:45] respuestas o quedar en sufrimiento.
[1:45:52] [Música]
[1:45:57] solamente esperar lo que Dios irá
[1:46:03] hacer. Levanta tus
[1:46:07] manos. Oh, cuando levanta tus
[1:46:13] manos es hora de vencer.
[1:46:18] Oh,
[1:46:20] alabar. Simplemente alabar.
[1:46:25] Estás llorando.
[1:46:27] Alaba en la prueba.
[1:46:30] Alaba. Estás sufriendo.
[1:46:34] Alaba mi te alaba. Tu alabanza él
[1:46:39] escuchará.
[1:46:42] Escuchará. Dios va al frente y abriendo
[1:46:45] camino, quebrando cadenas, sacando
[1:46:48] espinas. Manda sus ángeles contigo a
[1:46:52] luchar. Él abre puente, nadie puede ser.
[1:46:56] Él trabajar para los que confían
[1:46:59] conmigo, contigo de noche, de día.
[1:47:03] Levanta tus manos, tu victoria llegó.
[1:47:06] Comienzo a cantar y alaba a
[1:47:10] Dios. Alaba a
[1:47:13] Dios. Alaba a Dios.
[1:47:18] Alaba a
[1:47:20] Dios. Alaba a
[1:47:23] Dios. Alaba
[1:47:26] Dios. Alaba a
[1:47:30] Dios. Alaba a Dios.
[1:47:36] [Aplausos]
[1:47:38] La gente
[1:47:41] necesita entender lo que Dios está
[1:47:48] hablando. Oh,
[1:47:50] aleluya. Oh, cuando él da en
[1:47:56] silencio es porque está
[1:48:00] trabajando. Lo
[1:48:03] creer. Oh.
[1:48:05] Basta
[1:48:07] solamente esperar los que Dios irá
[1:48:11] hacer.
[1:48:14] [Aplausos]
[1:48:17] Oh, cuando él extiende sus
[1:48:21] manos es hora de vencer.
[1:48:27] Oh,
[1:48:29] alaba. Simplemente alabar.
[1:48:33] Estás llorando.
[1:48:35] Alaba en la prueba.
[1:48:38] Alaba. Está sufriendo.
[1:48:41] Alaba y porte alaba. Tu escuchará.
[1:48:47] Escuchará.
[1:48:50] Oh, Dios. Para la frente abriendo
[1:48:52] camino, quebrando cadenas, sacando sus
[1:48:56] espinas. Manda a sus ángeles contigo
[1:48:59] luchar. Nadie fuerte nadie puedecer. Oh,
[1:49:03] es trabajar para los que confían. Comino
[1:49:07] contigo de noche día. Levanta tus manos,
[1:49:11] tu victoria llegó. Comienzo a cantar de
[1:49:14] alaba a
[1:49:16] Dios. Alaba a
[1:49:20] Dios. Alaba a
[1:49:23] Dios. Alaba a Dios.

[2:10:19] just want to apologize from the bottom
[2:10:21] of our hearts,

[2:10:29] that you give us, all the blessings that
[2:10:31] you provide to us.

[2:10:37] leave this wonderful sanctuary, Lord,
[2:10:40] let us take that sweet spirit with us.
[2:10:43] Lord, let us take it into our homes. Let
[2:10:46] us never forget that feeling, Lord, of
[2:10:48] your
[2:10:49] presence. Father, we also ask that you
[2:10:52] would take the food that we are about to
[2:10:55] partake of and bless it to our bodies.
[2:10:58] And thank you Lord for these wonderful
[2:11:00] brothers and sisters that we have here
[2:11:03] to be able to sit down in fellowship
[2:11:05] Lord and to worship your name Lord we
