being at home with my family and I I truly well my um I wish I also had my wife and and all our people in Norway with me but um I'm happy to have two sons with me my son brother Marcus and my son-in-law brother Freddie so so that's a great blessing for me so I I want to thank brother Caleb Thomas and all the brothers for such a wonderful reception and make us feel at home and feel relaxed and um I I had a little uh a little bit a very important conversation with with brother your elder brother Abraham conversation right before the service and I appreciate that so much and I told him I'm I'm here just to learn from you I'm you know I'm a young man yeah so I have to learn because this thing will keep happening there and since I I Was Here For the First Time December 2021 you started I will say so many things have happened since I I was walking up in the forest there in Norway Floresta in Norway and asking for God's leading and when he finally answered my my prayers I I got more blessed than I could ever think of because I believe everything was in God's perfect timing and that's an important thing yes because God he has a program and he has a timing for that problem so he puts all the pieces in the right place and the right timing so um so many thing I would like to say but um I will spend all together a couple of weeks here so we will probably have some more time together but I wanted to know that um I see you quite often not just once in a while but uh at least twice a week but you don't see me [Laughter] but um we we feel like like brother Abraham said we we have to speak the same language so that's so important it's not important I I see brother Adolfo Mata here and uh may God bless you brother I met brother Adolfo for the first time in Colombia in 2018 and the year after I had the great privilege of staying in so I have I have a simple message to share with you today and um I call it the second part is because it's the second part of the message I spoke here in December 2021 because well some people they think I'm a little bit slow but I believe it's superb I I tried my best to find something else to preach but those things they came to me again and again so I I better believe that there is a purpose so um so let's read from from The Book of Romans and um it's chapter 8 verse 29 to 30. and I I want to thank brother Caleb and brother Thomas for for the confidence stand behind this uh this puppets so um it's not actually an easy easy thing to do but uh we trust in the Lord that he can bring something to us so let's read Romans 8 29 30. in Jesus name Jesus for whom he did for now he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many bretons moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified I am the father we thank you so much for his mercy and Grace gracias thank you for taking care of us thank you for leading and guiding us and thank you for letting us be a part of this wonderful Revelation for this hour and that you predestinated us before the foundation of the world and as brother Branham once said there is a purpose with every one of us here tonight so father I ask you that you may bless all my brothers and sisters in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you might be seated so the thing I was thinking about was to be confirmed to the image what kind of image it it's the image of his son is so um he says something really interesting here this is that our own life is just a pattern foreign and not the real thing so when we see each other here we actually we we don't see the real thing we see the negative side but the real thing is the picture he took of you and me way back when he said let us make man in our image right so when God created man it was in his image in the image of God created him male and female created so when brother Branham speaks about this picture he says that this is the main thing is importante and then he says in the resurrection those gases and acids and things comes right back into the place and develops this picture again so the the question is when was this picture taken not when you was 16. or 18 or 20 years at your best when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world and it was put in God's Great pile and God's Great Fire de dios and then only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice then then you become a servant of God him for knowing it as we have been through it but there is something when we talk about it a picture must not only be taken but it most must also be developedics all right you know I I used to be a photographer photographer and I took so many pictures muchas photos but pretty often I didn't develop the film bro you know obviously so I I just took the film out of the camera of the camera and put it in a little bag and I took care of that little bag with with films and I still have that little bag with maybe it's like 20 films and we have been moving from place to place during many years and I I have taken that thing back with me to all those places but until this day I don't know what kind of pictures they are on those things because I I never developed a few foreign so what I'm talking about now is old-fashioned photography is this is to put this back in the Tiffany we come from foreign thank you it takes death muerte so listen to this is so he gets the Eternal spiritual eterno his attribute displayed in that body then like any picture in its negative form so this is [Music] there it is developed Aji is it comes out to the perfect picture and we go into the dark rooms but to come out after the negative has been a perfect picture in the image of Christ we go into the dark gray in tamus into the dark room for developing it takes death and then he says just like it takes death to yourself to develop the picture of the image of Christ The Life of Christ in you you have to dump your own up so that Christ can come in you have to die to yourself exactly something very important here now anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if it if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere so we heard that we are living in a negative form here this is that means it must be a positive of you and me somewhere significance but the question is how can I find that that real me because the one I see in the mirror every morning is not the real meaning and and the more I look at him the more happy I am that this is not the real me because I'm living in a dying body so but the question is where is the positive style positivo the only way to find out and have it turned into a positive that cannot be done the digital way exactly Sacramento but this is to be developed is a kind of scary scary process is because Brothers someday that death shall develop the picture from the negative to the person and when we go through that terrible acid of death then we will know as we are known and see face to face aren't we looking forward to that but to get to that experience we have to go through something terrible and we don't like we don't like that herbal acid but I have been a photographer so I know in order to develop pictures I have to go into a dark room and I'm using acid is yeah so we we can't bypass that is but the process is for a purpose and if we could only understand if we could always believe that when we are going through things and find ourselves in a dark room you know there is but it's the test for you and me because when everything go well we are in the light and we have a good time enough money and not too many bills to pay it's easy but we are not here to have an easy life we are here to be our Commerce because the Lord wants to prove something that those key predestinated they are not here just to live a life and put on clothes and go to the word and eat food and and drive cars but they are here to overcome things things because that can only be overcome by faith is that easy and that difficult I see the facilities it depends on how you see it depends if you if you try to understand all those things it will become very different but when you come into the dimension of faith you can rest and God will do it but we must first come into that dimensions [Music] because this word is a Living Word okay so before we can develop a picture we must take the picture and what is the real meaning of Photography the word photography means and the scripture tells us that God is alive and in him is no Darkness but he is so we are not children of Darkness you see because he was drawing by light foreign but then he let us come to this earth is and to be conformed to the image of who it is who is the first born you see so um without light there will be no pictures but the question is do we really want to be developed in I I hear many amen here that kid so the next question is are we willing to die is hooray that's really serious yeah and um the theme for for for those meetings the day I died and I was thinking when did I die yes and I said to brother Caleb I feel like and that's the truth yes we have to die everywhere that's the processo so Glory the the process of death is is pretty painful isn't it we don't like it according to our human flesh we we try to find ways to bypass the sovereign but we have to understand that God he is the same yesterday and if we for example if we go back to Hebrews 11. and read about our brothers and sisters you can easily see that they spent uh a pretty great part of their life in the dark room tomorrow developing pictures you see Ben and the fact is in this momentum they are waiting for us that we May fulfill you know the same blood and mismo processo because they cannot be perfected without you know because they are already developed still not fully developed completely until entiende yeah so just to explain the developing processes and and just to uh not go too much into details but the first thing we do when when we have a potential picture is it it it looks like just a white paper Blanco and and you take the negative and you are projecting light through the negative it's the projector lose into that white paper and they say papel Blanco and you can still see nothing on that paper you have to believe that there is something yeah and in the dark room it is dark but there is it's a little lighter with red light is it's a red color Rojo so wherever you look if you look at yourself pants and whatever in the dark rooms it has a red color because that red color it covers everything you see and it's only under that color that the picture can be developedics and that's the color of the blood is it color de la Sangre only under the blood is we cannot make it by ourselves but just hit ourselves our whole life and everything under the blood because the developing process can start it was so don't try to bypass it is so when you turn on the light and you make an exposure exposition or a certain amount of time and then you take this paper and put it into the acido it's a developing liquidity and when you have put the paper there you you can't do nothing more you can just step back and and just just watch it it's a kind of magic momentum when you see the picture coming forward little by little and and then little ballet you you can understand the picture you are recognizing things but you have to wait until the process is is fulfilled because and don't run right out of the diagram into the light to look at the picture because you you have to go through the whole process so when when the picture has come forward then you take the picture out of the developer and you put it into water Travis you see yeah very important it's more important don't skip the washing by the water no no no because it must be worse under the red color Rojo and the last stage here is when you take the picture out of the water and put it into the preservation liquidity [Music] the preservation preservative that makes the picture last forever understand it must be preserved and then it will last you can look at the pictures and just for a few seconds it looks nice but because it is still not preserved it is completely black Negro [Music] no no exactly right brother and you know what sorry he was the first one El for primero to invent digital technology because he was so smart and he tried to sell this technology to Jesus Jesus he tried to have Jesus skipping the processed [Applause] yeah just skip the death process the pain okay just worship me and you will become a king right away it's not easy you don't have to go to the cross and mess with water and blood and all that stuff going into darkness and Satan he knew is if he would have success with this yes and selling his smart idea to Jesus he knew something we would never ever that's the reason is he tried to sell this smart idea Jesus Jesus aura you see Ben understand yeah so you know seven I have really enjoyed listening to to the sermon here on Sundays about worship is truth and spirits and and I come to the conclusion Bingo you are a conclusion that the only way to to worship the the way that pleases God because I must bring a sacrifice but as sacrifice is not just enough noise [Music] but but can he developed something from his own mind it was his own idea and we it was a good idea yeah so he brought from something really beautiful but that beautiful sacrifice is not my God but Abel also developed something and that was to God's word it was according to a revelation that it had to be blood you see Ben so that sacrifice was not so beautiful this is but it was that sacrifice the Lord accepted and because of that sacrifice you and I we are here today as worshipers because Abel he had the revelation of what happened in the garden and he also had the Revelation that that this sacrifice it was also this this lamb was pointing it I mean perfect is but his brother can he had no Revelations but he was a smart man and he was a very good worship the only thing that God can accept is worth the death must take place but from that death life comes up because it is so why are we so afraid of this terrible assets it's painful yes but it brings from something wonderful that is 100 according to God's will because it's perfect and that's the image of Christ amen amen yeah so here is something okay I'll go really beautiful that brother Branham he says this is and he's praying here and he says Dear God the Great and Mighty God is formed All Things by the power of His spirit and brought Jesus Christ his only begotten son you freely died for these Sinners just for the and yes to reconcile us back to reconciliation of the regression into His Marvelous Fellowship into maraville companies that we have again with God that we have again it means that it had to be something before significance and now it happens again the same thing again oh [Music] like the brothers they're saying now we are going into the nitty-gritty yes or yes COC let me say that again to reconsile us back into this marvelous Fellowship reconciliers that we have again with God as we are taught in the Blessed word that we have fellowship with him before the foundation of the world but we couldn't remember it until this message came and as as a broker I think it was brother Thomas he said the purpose with this message is to make us remember what happened back there and understand by Revelation who we are Revelation you see then and then we are willingly going through the death process foreign how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when God in his great thinking shouting and rejoicing in our ways and tradition s wow that's something really that when we really let that think and start understanding does great plans that Marvel's great plan is [Music] having Fellowship again rejoicing again it's not for the first time and I can tell you something this will never end yes it will last forever processo and the Lord he let me go through a little process here a few days ago and when we find ourselves in that dark room we are getting so self-pity you know in my life I I found myself on a plane but before that moment something happened algo Paso I was on my way to Las Cruces you were at the Camino a Las Cruces but my flight was canceled I was supposed to go to Dallas first but it was canceled and I got a message and I was so happy you can go to uh Phoenix yeah I buy that but then I got another message we are sorry to tell you that your flight to Phoenix is campus and now it starts becoming real serious for me then I got a new message flight to Los Angeles I can tell you I got up half past three in the morning in LA in in hospital and my flight to London was two hours delayed and then and they they let me go from London icelandia and Greenland Greenland and Canada and then to Los Angeles for me it was I felt like I I was on my way to the Moon foreign senor I I think Lord this is the last time I'm going to the Euros yeah I I'm not made for this it's too much for me so when I arrived Los Angeles Los Angeles at the immigration I think it was at least 1 000 people in front of me so I thought I would have plenty of time to have some food I had to go like and when I finally come to the desk the police officer when did you get so mad on me immigration because I was so tired that I could hardly tell my name is foreign I'm not sure I would survive Jonah says so finally I have my departure from Los Angeles Sarco De Los Angeles and I I got to El Paso by midnight and and I had a reserved a place to stay but it was already more than one o'clock until I put my head on the pillow I was completely posted but you guess what three o'clock in the morning the telephone range and it was a lady from Norway and and she wanted to sell me some omega-3s and I felt like Am I Dreaming or what's going on but I have a little bit brother Henry upstairs before the service and he understood something that I didn't understand through the death process he said oh this is easy you had to go to okay reverse to the west and then you have to return and go to the east should bring the gospel in Las Cruces well it makes sense for me hahaha because the gospel had to go that way all the way so finally I came to myself a little bit un poco but when I look back when the mirror well it was not that bad because I could make it and now I feel good I'm through it and every test is like that is a c if it just go through it to being developed and when we look back foreign when you find yourself in that dark room just be sure to have that bread all around [Music] and and I can tell you something You Are Not Alone because there is an angel there all the time if we could only believe that so it would be easier to always believe that God's angel is the only way we can believe it is by faith is is yeah and and that's the thing with the whole process yes with our journey um [Music] we have a desire of understanding of things and especially when when things are going on especially and sometimes we maybe the people are some people are offending us you know because and we try to understand why why did he say that why did he do that is that right this is a correct we so many questions are coming but all those things and easily mess up the whole thing because our calling is not to understand of foreign you say because I I grew up democracy at the countryside and and it was Farms all around and and I I saw farmers who were not Believers still they came to a point where they had to believe that was when they took the seed yes and the kid couldn't see nothing bernada the day after like a week later that they had to believe because from that scene they they they had their income you see men but in order to to get their income that the seeds would bring something and would be multiplied into something big in alcohol think of that you didn't say this only even even an unbelievable What About Us who has a privilege of believing this message so next time my brother and sister I I want to encourage animal that you find yourself in the dark room yes it happened already this day tomorrow morning and you willingly go through the processed so we we don't have to be afraid but we have God's promises and this flesh will never ever believe it yes so what we see is not the believer but the believer is inside us just make sure that you feed the beliefs with the Living Word of God every day you see Ben so what will then happen take the picture I have something wonderful here brother I don't care I mean they will do with you Lucas they cannot destroy that profile that picture in God's Great Gallery up there is because it is in heaven you could burn it up feed it to the Lions do it anyway you want to the culture Manila kicks it will Comfort again just as sure as the two twos is four Dan seguro Como dos mas dos just as sure as God spoke it will come first so no matter where you are no important and I would say no matter what kind of Darkness you are going through important nobody can destroy you not yet nothing can destroyed up whether it is real law because where are you you are in heaven in Heavenly places so you will comfort as the Perfect Image only believe Bendigo amen would you stand to your feet this evening can we give one more to
