am a born-again pirate and I'm searching the Seas of time searching for lost souls for the kingdom and I work for the captain of captains I got a little treat for you all today let us start first with the most important thing let us open our Bibles how many have your Bible today if you have your Bible say ah [Applause] let's go to the Book of Matthew 6 19. hello let us read the book it says hide not yourselves Treasures upon the Earth where moth and rust does corrupt and where thieves break through and still but lay yourselves up Treasures in Heaven or neither moth nor rust doth corrupt for where your treasure is there will your heart be also now today I want to start with a little lesson you see I have this treasure box who wants to open it who really wants to fool I told you out of here you don't come back who wants to help me every time he comes out you fight him for me welcome aboard the ship of Zion and when you see him I want everybody to yell out Thief thief thief thief and we'll help him out does that sound good all righty then where were we or where your treasure is there will your heart be also so we want to look at a treasure box like if it's a heart of a human being we all have a treasure box right here can you feel it this is where God hides his treasure we are the greatest treasure that God could ever have and inside of this box here oh wait I did say I would let somebody do it I am not impressed I don't think you all really want to look into this treasure box you all are very weak much too serious we must say a little joke if that's okay and if you get this right I will let you come up it's more like a riddle what should we ask if I put you in charge I'm Mickey what is a pirate's favorite letter hey why do you say a what do you think are is she right or you think but it is the sea yeah that gets me every time you land lover all right but I'll let you come up or try it let's give her a hand all right go ahead and give it a little flick [Music] you're on your own buddy I've shown you enough that's the problem with having these Earthly possessions is you're gonna have to protect them because the thief comes to steal I'm swordless I can't help you oh oh give me one yeah I I Hungary we've got him way to go okay let me see that storm before you hurt yourself all right all right where were we open it up bro what do you see in here trophy you want a trophy everybody wants a trophy don't ya thank you [Music] I love gold it drives me life anymore she doesn't like it there's a trophy [Music] trophy oh I'll get you one so we can all see that we like trophies right we like the shiny things well so do I that's one thing that never left me but let's let's dig a little deeper in this treasure box here why don't you help all right so this is what I like in my treasure box it's a good quality treasure box these are for when I go to Mickey's land you think that's funny where's Micah I borrowed this from you who likes dinosaurs everybody likes dinosaurs today don't they maybe you need some headphones you guys can't keep this stuff you're just borrowing it well you closed your heart open the heart back up we're searching the heart today we got to see what else is in here we have some water who likes water I have an old foosball who likes foosball I got a Swiss Army knife multi-purpose tool I'm not gonna hand it out who likes Hershey's milk chocolate everybody [Applause] oh damn oh get him somebody take him out yeah give him the one two take off his arm yeah we got a store now and don't you come back I already told you three times all righty then milk chocolate all right [Applause] we have more money but I don't want to give any more out I gotta have a good balance who already has something it's a softball but it's actually hard and at the very bottom which it shouldn't have been is a Bible it should be the most valued possession but if you notice I had it laying at the bottom of my chest what's wrong with that picture anybody it's not right to put this before put everything else before the Bible amen the word of God should be first in our heart and that's what I did not do so I'm going to tell you all a little story I'm still learning to this day how to keep me sales and going but you see unlike you children I didn't grow up with a mother and a father nobody loved me nobody took care of me if I wanted something I had to steal it I had to take it by force if I needed to eat for the day I'd go to the market I would steal I would fight for everything so one day I was walking in a field and I saw a beautiful flower there on the ground so me picked it up and I was looking at this flower and I was looking it was so radiant so beautiful and all of a suddenly the flower sneezed in my face flowers aren't supposed to do that one might think that wasn't in my right mind but I was so hajui he's back onto the flower I said take that flower and all of a sudden the flowers started talking you might think I'm crazy and I am but that flower was the first friend he ever made he's a bluff he's not coming back he's thornless we have the sword so let's get a lesson going so I had this flower and this flower was my best friend the flower would talk to me I got a relationship with the flower and one day the flower tells me you know what Captain Jack I wasn't a captain then ask me anything you want and it's yours and I said well get a new ship I could ask for food whatever me heart desire I could have asked for gold and that's what I asked for you all guessed I asked for gold and I said you know what I felt really inspired and there was a great mountain in front of me and I said you know what flower fill that mountain with gold and when we get to the top I want to walk in and see much gold all the rich and the flower said very well you can have what you wish under one condition you must take me everywhere with you for the moment you leave me behind your riches or nothing so I said fair enough you're my friend I'll never leave here my flower and so we walked up the mountain that day I'll never forget and as we got to the top there was a big mouth of a cave and we walk in and it was so dark put me flower lit away as if it was sunlight and we turned our sharp corner and behold my eyes saw the greatest treasure I'd ever seen mountains of Gold Gems rubies any precious stone your heart could imagine so what I did is I got my beautiful flower and I was so caught up in the gold that I threw my flower on the ground hey and I began to look and I began to stuff my pockets as quick as I could with Ruby's Jewels gold and I thought as soon as I get to town all me mates will know that I'm a rich man and I began to stuff every pocket I had in my pocket for huge full of golden jewels and I was going to run out of the cave to go tell all the people in the village what I had found and I Heard a Voice say wait you're forgetting the most poor thing oh damn I'm forgetting proof that I was here at the Bible I didn't care about the Bible so I grabbed a big piece of stone so I could show the people that I was really there that this place did exist and I put it on me back and I was going out the cave again and once more I heard a little voice so thanks so quiet wait you're forgetful thing and I look back and it was the flower I said I don't need that no more I'll leave it here I'll come back for it later and as soon as I left the cave the mountain crumble and I looked back and it did not exist anymore and I realized I left the most important thing in the cave and it was gone forever I left my flower and that's where the power lied was in my flower so I had all the riches but it did not matter because I could no longer prove that the power I could have gone a million more times back to that mountain been very successful had lost the show but I didn't keep my part of the deal and therefore I was a broke man all these riches mean nothing to me now I want you to ask yourself today what yes she loves gold good all right back on task yeah that's a chair the chair has gold I know I talked to flowers go ahead and you see you've got to ask yourself today what might my flower be what is that little voice that tells me within my heart I shouldn't do this you shouldn't talk back to your parents you shouldn't be mean to other children you shouldn't lie cheat and steal there's a little voice in each one of you at heart that tells you what's right and what's wrong but the moment you silence that voice like I did that's when all the power leaves you that's when you got to find your way back to the Lord and if my friends upstairs would play a little clip I want you to listen very closely to what the prophet has to say there's nobody can try to do anything your kids would never be able to do anything wrong that you're being raised the way you are unless you feel something tell you not to do it I don't never steal that voice that's one and always remember accept that voice it said follow me and you'll always come out right I believe you will I got confidence in you but just always remember and Jesus that voice is alive in the Earth tonight that voice to the life tonight and that's who is speaking tonight he's speaking to your heart don't ever silence that Voice Within your treasure box you see Pirates don't bury their treasure so that they never find it again no we bury our treasure so that's when we need it most we can use the map of God's word and pull out the treasures of his promises if I need healing I can take healing from the treasure box and you might ask how do I put treasure in my box well it's very simple you all recite your Bible verses every week don't you you are adding treasure into your box when you speak to the Lord you are adding treasure into your box when you help all your mates around you you are adding pleasure to your box so that's when you have need of it you simply go in and take what you need well as for me Captain Jack Doe I will continue sailing the Seas working for the captain of capital until the last soul is called to all at once let us give a Great Big R her mateys and I will catch you next time
