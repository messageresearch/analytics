[46:02] together this morning
[46:05] undivided attention for about the next
[46:07] 45 minutes
[46:12] we want everybody to rejoice in the word
[46:14] of god
[46:17] my father used this scripture
[46:26] in the 90s in los angeles
[46:30] and there was a man in a wheelchair
[46:34] aviano
[46:36] i was translating for him
[46:40] there was a man in a wheelchair on his
[46:42] right-hand side
[46:46] and he said these words
[46:49] faith is our victory
[46:54] they started in about five minutes into
[46:56] his message
[47:00] and he turned around and he looked at
[47:01] that man
[47:04] and he said brother do you believe that
[47:06] faith is your victory
[47:10] [Music]
[47:23] is what happened to the people
[47:27] their faith went through the roof
[47:30] now that is where we come from
[47:35] that is what makes us do what we got to
[47:38] do
[47:41] that's what makes us do what we do even
[47:44] in a pandemic
[47:48] because for whatsoever is born of god
[47:54] and you come with me right now
[47:57] and you can you draw to the banister of
[48:00] heaven
[48:02] for whatsoever is born of god
[48:06] again if you have been born of a god he
[48:09] has not seen the lord again if you have
[48:11] been born of god he has not seen the new
[48:13] ability you overcome the world
[48:17] and this is the victory
[48:47] what is it that matters in our life yes
[48:51] what is important
[48:55] and what matters in our life
[48:59] i'm going to ask you again
[49:13] if i gave you three boxes
[49:18] and i would tell you
[49:21] you're gonna move
[49:22] to another house
[49:26] and you only can put
[49:28] whatever you can put in three boxes
[49:33] how many people would be able to do that
[49:39] we got one candidate back there
[49:42] now i don't know about you
[49:45] but i i would have to put
[49:48] what is more important
[49:53] what matters look important again
[49:57] if i was to give you a one box
[50:01] think about it what would you put in
[50:03] that box
[50:06] that would be the only thing that you
[50:08] could take with you
[50:16] your favorite dress substitute
[50:18] your favorite shirt
[50:21] maybe would you take your bible
[50:24] yeah
[50:34] but i got in my house a bunch of junk
[50:38] you think oh man
[51:10] and i and i and i said i don't know what
[51:12] that means but that sounds pretty good
[51:14] a bunch of stuff that you don't even
[51:16] know what it is okay
[51:17] and so we thought no we're not gonna do
[51:20] that no no no
[51:22] why don't we empty out the junk that we
[51:24] already have in our shed
[51:30] has been in there for 10 years
[51:33] and the only one that's using it is the
[51:35] rats and the squirrels
[51:43] so in there we had boxes of things
[51:48] but you know it comes a day
[51:51] where we had uh brother brother julian
[51:54] did our roof
[51:58] and and part of the bottom was filled
[52:01] with whatever he scraped off
[52:03] of part of the roof
[52:12] but that day
[52:13] was
[52:14] junk day for me
[52:16] the
[52:20] so we just started throwing whatever
[52:22] there was
[52:25] if you're not going to use it that week
[52:29] and don't look at me like you are no no
[52:33] if you have stuff that you have not used
[52:35] for one week
[52:38] the possibility of you ever using again
[52:41] is probably never
[52:55] that can say well i wish he would have
[52:57] left me that because one day i'm going
[52:59] to use it
[53:04] and then you're going to pass off the
[53:05] scene
[53:08] and then your great grandkids still had
[53:10] not yet ever used
[53:14] so i always say if we don't use it in a
[53:16] week we're probably not ever going to
[53:18] use it
[53:21] but you say brother it was my great
[53:23] great great great
[53:26] grandfathers and it looks like it was
[53:29] your great great great great grandfather
[53:33] that's fine
[53:34] at one time it had a great use
[53:38] but now
[53:40] you just have it there as a memorial
[53:43] memorial because you're never going to
[53:45] use it
[53:46] because you don't want to break it
[53:49] but i want you to know
[53:51] the scripture tells us in matthew the
[53:54] sixth chapter
[53:57] 19th verse
[53:59] lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
[54:03] earth
[54:06] where moth and rust dot corrupt
[54:23] up for yourselves treasures
[54:27] where
[54:30] somebody tell me
[54:33] where we're gonna lay up treasures now
[55:04] 25 verses
[55:06] take no thought for your life
[55:18] you know
[55:19] i guarantee you this morning
[55:23] that many of us
[55:24] que muchos de nosotros in eating
[55:26] breakfast
[55:30] were already thinking what we were going
[55:32] to have for lunch
[55:37] i appreciate that
[55:41] i'm thinking that by the time lunch

[55:48] going to have for dinner

[55:59] but i also know that tambien
[56:13] you're thinking what you're gonna
[56:43] what shall you put on

[57:04] going from one side to the other ese
[57:10] and this other sparrow came to have a
[57:13] have a talk with him

[1:29:16] fulfill
[1:29:18] jesus
[1:29:22] they were looking to see how many
[1:29:24] promises jesus would fulfill
[1:29:28] jesus
[1:29:29] and they would look hey

[1:29:34] that's not him
[1:29:36] that's not him oh isn't
[1:29:37] until his last last hour after ultima

[1:30:33] this it's already written that you can
[1:30:35] yes
[1:30:37] faith is our victory
[1:30:43] is substance it's the substantial way is
[1:31:03] look
[1:31:05] he's disarmed you when he gets you to
[1:31:07] disbelieve that weapon
[1:31:12] when you lay that down
[1:31:54] what does the back of the book tell us
[1:32:36] amen and when jesus was crucified
[1:32:42] brother hector
[1:32:44] i was with him
[1:32:46] man

[1:34:43] brother bernie says
[1:34:53] it worked in every area of his life
[1:35:12] when you see
[1:35:26] i told my buddy
[1:35:28] amigo
[1:35:30] brother julius emmano julius he calls me
[1:35:32] his br he calls me that i am his brother

[1:41:44] see if there won't be enough room
[1:41:49] and it will overflow
[1:41:56] have you ever had
[1:41:58] a promise that god gave you
[1:42:03] did you get it
[1:42:06] were you scared after you got it
[1:42:12] because it comes with responsibility
[1:42:16] now

[1:42:23] and another problem
