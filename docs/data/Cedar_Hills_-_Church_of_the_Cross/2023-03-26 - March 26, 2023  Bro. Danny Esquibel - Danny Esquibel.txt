Lord Jesus this evening how many are happy to be back in God's house tonight yes amen it's a privilege amen it's a privilege to see each and every one of you and we're gonna read a scripture really quick and so I have a few scriptures but we're going to read this one so you can have a seat so let's just read real quick Revelation 21 9. and it was just part of the scripture that uh our founding Pastor read on on Wednesday and it says and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show you Thee the bride the Lamb's the wife Del Cordero At His blessings to the reading of the word amen so uh we want to be uh I want to make sure we got our time right tonight how many enjoyed that message this morning amen so uh where do we stand and as you can see uh that was my title right so I felt as soon as I heard the the uh the uh title this morning I felt safe all right I believe that the Lord was working amen so I feel good tonight because uh because we were on the same page whether abrahamas good to see each and every one of you God bless you Roxy and Paul God bless you good to see you this evening and all those that are online so where do we stand amen and so the question was asked to us this morning why are we here amen somebody be bold while we're here right so maybe we might say oh there was nothing else to do on a Sunday night right and so like the the man that one once time one time went to church uh he heard the sermon and then uh he he uh when he got back into the car he began to complain he said oh man that was the worst service I've ever been in oh man did you hear them singing Do You Hear did you hear the piano player terrible really and that preacher that's terrible right and then and then his son chimed in from the back seats what were you expecting for a dollar right thank you he had put a dollar in the offering and that's exactly what he got a dollars so why are we here uh how many believe that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ tonight right so I got I got half of us that said amen and maybe another half that raised her hand so I'll give you an another opportunity uh how many are here how many here are the Bride of Jesus Christ so you hear so many times and and we hear this a lot is that the First Defense of people because they say uh you you don't know who the bride is right that's our first line of defense right or you can you can't judge me you don't you know but there is a way to know who the bride is how many know that tonight there is a way to know if you are the bride would you like to know because he told this Angel here let me show you the bride the Lamb's wife right so we're going to find out a little bit about this this bride because everybody claims to be the wife but unless God reveals himself to you he reveals himself personally to you and he ever thought of you in the beginning then you are his wife and it will be revealed to you so how's it going to be revealed you say let's find out amen let's just get a little comfortable Diego always said let's just get comfortable tonight and let's find out how we're going to find out so let's read Malachi 4-5 amen all right so we're just going to read a couple scriptures to to get a foundation amen he says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers last I come and smite the Earth with a curse so he's going to come and do two things right so one thing was going to be that he would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children but he's going to also turn the hearts of the fathers or the children he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers right correct and that was a gentile Prophet yes and he said I will send unto you Elijah the prophet he never said he's going to stand Paul or any other messenger but he said I will send to you Elijah the prophet now if we can go into our scripture now we can turn over to Luke 22 31. now and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat is but I have prayed for thee that thy faith not that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brothers and so let's just go over now to our scripture in Matthew 16. and so you want to keep these scriptures in mind okay we're going to start to build on them then set Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me okay so now we're starting to see a little road map right we're starting to see the instruction page now he's giving us a way to find out who we are right so he he says now take up your cross and follow me but we find out in this last day that we're living here first of all let me make sure everybody's on the same page how many believe me that we are living in the last days right how many believe that we're this is the the last day amen and as you know in the last days we find out that is very hard for people to follow Jesus said take up your cross and follow me now we know that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible and so that's how close it's going to be in this last hour and the reason for that is because God promised that he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh now we heard this morning right as brother Abraham was speaking about the Holy Spirit right and what the Holy Spirit was given foreign right he said that the the rain will fall upon the Justice that's the promise as we heard this morning so now what was the Holy Spirit given foreign well brother Abraham was speaking this morning about his time in the apostolic church right and and they said that the Holy Spirit was given for us to speak in tongues right is that what they said brother Abraham right it was to speak in tongues it was to do all these other things but now the holy spirit will make you could make you speak in tongues right but but that's not what it was given foreign foreign when you don't Harvest when you plant how many knows that is it takes time for this rain or for the former rain to take effect but when the seed reaches maturity God gives it a ladder rain amen which brings a harvest now when that Harvest comes forth now everybody claims the third of the Bride right everybody claims they have the word everybody claims to believe the prophet right everybody believes they have the word but when that latter rain comes that was under the former Reign so whatever that teaching was it's going to give you the fruits whether that teaching was right or wrong it's in the fruit that's why Jesus said if you can't believe me believe the works that I do it's in the works so we see that people say I I I hear the prophet oh I don't need a pastor I have the tapes I have the prophet right and so I don't know if you've seen the movie The Chosen right and so in this Scene It is the sinner Jesus goes into the temple right and they they ask him uh you know they had made preparations for him to be able to read the the reading for that day yeah right and so he reads the scripture that pertains to him right and so when the priest hears him and everybody around him they start looking a little confused they're saying is he saying what I think he's saying is right and so and so in in the movie his friend uh Lazarus he starts to say no no no he's no he's not trying to say that oh and if he says right Jesus you're not you're not saying that right so what they were thinking what he was saying was that he was the Messiah that he was the Christ and so so Jesus responds to responding he says that's what I was saying Lazarus pretty much that's what I'm saying right and so the priest tells Jesus he says if you don't recount what you just said we're gonna have to fulfill the law of Moses on you and Jesus looked him in the face right and he says I am the law of Moses right and that's what it is today yes yes no has got to be a revelation to you and the only way that can be is that you have to have a new birth how many knows what the new birth is but it's time for us to have our own experience because the pastor says he's Christ as many times we're gonna if we like our pastor business we like him uh we're gonna we're gonna say oh you know it's like like brother Lon said oh sometimes we just repeat things that the pastor says if we like him we're gonna we're gonna repeat what he says but when that Revelation that says he's the Christ when that Revelation personally comes to you only by the Holy Spirit you can call him the Christ so don't says now order but in you they don't understand you can never call him the Christ except by the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the only one it's a lunico that can show you things to come how does he show you Israel right we heard it this morning right God has a vessel God has prepared a prepared voices now we know that God has only one voice and God has a voice that's what you have to watch out foreign we're living in a late dangerous hour we're living in dangerous times we're living in Alaska very dangerous hour and the reason you gotta watch out is because we heard this morning right we have inlets to the body and there's inlets so there's inlets to the supernatural so we got to be careful what we're here because our beings have contact with the Supernatural and in the Supernatural world you can beat the state very easily very easily so you gotta watch where you're stepping it's like a Minefield is you step on a land mine blow you apart right and that's what the devil will do people say oh I know the Bible God I know the message front words and backwards the devil knows it better than you and me both right he knows that more than we do and man I was gonna try to I was not gonna try I almost go into the right there's one thing he doesn't know right because God didn't permit it to be written but it was hidden in the heart of a prophet is okay so let's go on you can be deceived very easily now if we don't know the word which is Christ the word we can never be made free now as I said everybody claims to know the word but we know that the gospel didn't come in word only but it came in power and demonstrations now you hear so many people say like I've said and I'll repeat it somebody said the other day or I read directly from the prophet the prophets my guide I lean upon him the prophet right but like Philip said to the eunuch who is reading directly from the scroll he was reading directly from the prophet is do you know what you read a little bit more Revelation than most people nowadays he said how can I know unless just like he said some Apostles unless some man is the Holy Ghost teachers so the word that's why today many people foreign they don't understand it so they start to dismiss things about the message right because they don't have a guide right so because they can't understand the message and they can't put the message together right they start dismissing certain things oh the prophet was wrong the prophet made mistakes before 1963 he wasn't inspired right because they don't know Christ because you can only call him the Christ through the Holy Spirit what is that so you have to have that word right and so it also takes a strong hand of faith it takes a strong hand of Faith how many know what that hand is that I would send you Elijah the prophet and to what's he gonna do to turn the hearts I was a better Christiano hey that I was a better Christian when I was in the apostolic and brother Tommy's response was you were a better Christian in the Apostolic Church you didn't even know how to be a Christian you didn't even know what it was to be a Christian until this Prophets ain't no and so in the message so we're going to read a quote here right so it's uh in the anointed ones at the end time is this how close it's going to be Anointed with the same spirit that was upon Moses all right I got the Holy Spirit brother right Moses what he says was anoint Anointed with the same spirit that was upon Moses what was the difference the teaching of Moses was perfect Moses had the word of God oh I'll hear a denominational preacher oh this guy on YouTube he's awesome what was the difference in his message the message of this this one right here and their message being anointed by The Same Spirit foreign you know you don't run off like a Lone Ranger Jesus said go bring me your husband what are we going to do bring me your husband right and so he was anointed with the same Spirit as Moses was that Moses message was perfect the Bible said here in second Peter is that it was the teaching of Balaam that Israel received that God never did forgive unpardonable not one of them got saved Salvo let us sink in a little bit right they all heard the message they heard the prophet is they heard Moses message they all heard it Salvo though they had come out under the blessings of God okay and sing the hand of God moving by the mighty prophets and because another Prophet is and what what's the New Testament preacher he's a prophet right so another preacher or another Prophet come in with a teaching contrary to dispute with Moses and try to prove to the people that Moses was wrong right correct so they run off with their own message right but it's got to be lying the Bible says it's line yeah right correct what brother Abraham preached this morning yeah precepts right that's why you don't run off these people that are running off opening churches everywhere right correct why I got a message does it line up line up online does it line up with the word so in uh I got five minutes six minutes so so we find out that we must follow as we read the scripture take up your cross and follow me he's seeking me right right as we've just read that that Jesus was telling Peter Jesus he says Satan has asked for you now let's go here it's okay I want to read uh the same scripture you're not you're not going to have it up there so I'm going to read it oh you guys remember the scripture Luke 22 you want to look it in your Bible if they want to put it up but I want to read it to you this way right so this is this is another translation Luke 22 31 and it says you're my friend Pedro me amigo right so just follow along it says Peter my friend Pedro Amigo listen to what I'm about to tell you is Satan has obtained permission permisso to come and sift you all like wheat yeah we right away think and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desire to have you yes okay so then Jesus prayed for him no but he says vehicle Satan has permission he came and he asked Jesus can I have permission to stiff Peter down and Jesus tells Peter Satan has obtained permission and to test your faith but I have prayed for you we heard this morning that God has given us the greatest weapon and that's prayer yes now saying has permission to sift you down right and to test your faith I gave him permission but I have prayed for you that you would stay faithful to me Ami no matter what comes the power of prayer thank Jesus thank Jesus Jesus for praying for US foreign vacations we know sometimes you got to go to work all right Pedro stay faithful to me no matter what comes remember this after you have been turned back to me Ami and have been restored make it your life mission ask it to strengthen the faith of your brother now you cannot do that you have had a full conversion total when you have had a true conversion and the only way that a man can be truly converted is that the holy spirit is like we saw this morning that was a strong and affairs and the Bible says that they were pricked at their hearts they were pricked as we stand to our feet and what happened to the heart it was bleeding when it's pricked it begins to bleed what was happening all those impurities were coming out all that garbage that's why they say a smoking is going to send you to hell everywhere doing this and that's going to send you the house no that doesn't send you to hell no it's not alone just believe in God's word just believe in God's Prophet is all those other things he said just follow me just follow me take up your cross I can't stop doing this well just keep following it's continuous again just keep following all those other things all those ones just slide off the road oh that'll just slide off the road and believe in this evening as we bow our heads Lord we have said what you've asked us to say father Lord I pray for each and every person here tonight Lord that they would receive Lord Jesus that word that'll bring to them life Eternal Father Lord as our elders spoke this morning that he is here for the people our lives are dedicated to you and to your children Lord that's why we're here
