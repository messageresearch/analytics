[42:38] that we live in now
[42:41] so you may have you may hear many things
[42:44] over and over again
[42:46] but it's building up to something
[42:50] today there was war in heaven
[42:53] Lord willing next Sunday
[42:56] there was war on Earth
[43:00] let's build up to next Sunday of the
[43:03] Lord willing
[43:05] today we're going to focus on the war
[43:07] that was in heaven
[43:10] the Bible reads like this Revelations 12
[43:13] 7 and 8 reads and there was war in
[43:17] heaven
[43:19] can you tell your neighbor that make
[43:21] sure that he he knows what what we're
[43:23] talking about today
[43:25] there was war in heaven tell your
[43:28] neighbor say neighbor don't forget this
[43:33] who was fighting in this war
[43:36] the Bible says Michael and his angels
[43:39] Miguel is Los Angeles fought against the
[43:41] Dragon
[43:42] and the dragon fought and his angels
[43:48] and prevailed not
[43:50] neither was their place
[43:53] found any more in heaven is
[43:59] you notice it doesn't say t-h-e-r-e
[44:02] right
[44:03] and neither was their place no neither
[44:06] was it their place
[44:10] bound anymore in heaven
[44:12] they lost their first estate
[44:17] may God add His blessings to the reading
[44:19] of his word you may be seated
[44:22] once again can we all say it together
[44:24] and there was war in heaven
[44:29] we have a real enemy the name is
[44:31] we have to know our enemy is that right
[44:35] we have to know our enemy so that we are
[44:38] not deceived
[44:40] it is the most deceptive age that there
[44:44] has ever been is right now
[44:47] and the only way not to be deceived
[44:51] and the only ones that will not be
[44:54] deceived
[44:55] we know is the word bride
[44:59] amen make sure you you you write that
[45:02] down the word bride
[45:04] are the only ones that will not be
[45:07] deceived
[45:09] she knows the enemies
[45:12] she knows where he comes from
[45:17] she's followed that trail
[45:20] and she knows the way her enemy is
[45:25] brother Sammy was was uh had sent me
[45:28] something the other a couple days ago
[45:31] he asked me if I had ever heard of it's
[45:34] called the Blue beam projects
[45:44] it's like so many other things a a
[45:47] conspiracy theory
[45:50] that states that NASA and the United
[45:53] Nations
[45:54] and along with the
[45:57] antichristo that supposedly they're
[46:00] going to try and simulate question
[46:03] the second coming of the Lord Jesus in
[46:06] the sky
[46:08] they'll be using satellite images or
[46:12] satellites I should say
[46:14] different different instruments
[46:17] in order to deceive the people
[46:20] and uh and this will help them establish
[46:24] they say the New World Order yes
[46:28] so accordingly they're going to have
[46:30] these images coming down from heaven and
[46:32] that's the way they're going to say look
[46:33] Jesus is here and and so forth
[46:39] they don't have to go through all that
[46:41] trouble
[46:43] the Bible says there was war in heaven
[46:47] and like brother Abraham says it wasn't
[46:51] a war with swords and Spears
[46:54] it wasn't a war with guns and bombs
[46:59] somebody help me out what kind of war
[47:01] was it
[47:06] spiritual war he says okay
[47:09] spiritual and what else
[47:14] all right
[47:15] it was a war of words
[47:20] it was a war of messages
[47:23] it was a Lucifer and Michael going at it
[47:27] and if someone had a message
[47:31] now now this is what we want to really
[47:34] focus on
[47:36] through thousands upon thousands uh
[47:39] these years that have passed
[47:42] onions many conspiracy theories and
[47:46] things have Arisen Through The Years
[47:50] rising up many claiming to be the
[47:52] Messiah
[47:55] recently I don't know if you if you if
[47:58] you follow it or not
[48:00] a certain Rabbi has has risen up in in
[48:04] Israel
[48:06] done a few Miracles
[48:09] many are saying he is the Messiah
[48:13] and people throughout the the the years
[48:16] as I said
[48:18] predicted that when the second coming of
[48:21] the Lord would be
[48:23] and have failed miserably
[48:26] many have claimed to be the Elijah
[48:31] many many of them and today many even
[48:35] claimed to be an eighth messenger
[48:39] but we are taught that we should not eat
[48:42] anything
[48:44] if it is not scriptural I know that
[48:48] right is that right if it's not
[48:49] scriptural I don't care how good it
[48:51] sounds we are not going to eat it
[48:55] but the thing about it is that even
[48:58] through all this
[48:59] there are so many people in the world
[49:02] that are deceived today
[49:06] because they don't know how to check it
[49:08] with the words
[49:10] I say it this morning church do not be
[49:13] deceived
[49:16] it's all about the Battle for your soul
[49:19] foreign
[49:28] [Applause]
[49:30] yes it's a battle for the soul of men
[49:34] yes
[49:35] and it didn't just start yesterday or
[49:38] the day you were born
[49:40] I want everybody to understand this it
[49:44] didn't just start last week
[49:47] this swore the Bible says started in
[49:50] heaven
[49:52] now your neighbor neighbor it started in
[49:54] heaven
[49:56] and sometimes we feel like we're some
[49:59] that we're special in this way
[50:03] nobody has had the struggles that I have

[51:28] the characteristics
[51:30] look at what he's trying to accomplish
[51:33] all right so are we ready for this
[51:36] message
[51:37] let's jump in and see what the Lord has
[51:40] for us
[51:41] is characteristics
[51:44] his goals are the same is
[51:48] he Longs and desires to be worshiped
[51:53] and the only ones that will recognize
[51:56] this is
[51:58] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[52:01] everyone else the Bible says everyone
[52:03] whose names were not written on the
[52:06] Lamb's Book of Life
[52:11] it don't matter how religious
[52:14] no matter what church you go it don't
[52:17] matter how long you've been in the
[52:18] message
[52:19] everyone whose names are not written on
[52:22] the Lamb's Book of Life
[52:25] everyone will be deceived
[52:29] notice this this is the message Christ
[52:31] is the mystery of God revealed
[52:34] notice in this last days
[52:37] he's talking about these are the last
[52:40] days right
[52:41] it says Lucifer is doing the same thing
[52:47] so if he's doing the same thing
[52:50] let me go back and see what he was
[52:52] [Music]
[53:04] brother Reuben we talked about this
[53:07] two Sundays ago
[53:09] we're talking about putting our name
[53:11] there right
[53:12] okay so who is he saying can you see it
[53:16] too
[53:21] are you sure
[53:23] yeah
[53:24] sisters hermanitas who is he talking
[53:26] about
[53:29] with the Boaz who's he talking
[53:32] ah good job brother Bo
[53:35] you have to put your name and here he's
[53:38] saying yeah and I put my name Caleb is
[53:41] he said
[53:42] can you see it
[53:45] he's trying to keep us from being
[53:47] deceived
[53:48] and so we have to put our name
[53:53] in the last days
[53:55] Lucifer is doing the same thing
[53:59] Caleb can you see it and I read this and
[54:03] then I say oh I can see it
[54:06] Prophet amen
[54:09] he's asking the question to me
[54:13] and you see it and then he goes on the
[54:17] devil doing the same thing
[54:22] he just repackages it in different ways
[54:27] building up a hybrid Church
[54:34] by hybrid members
[54:39] hybrid by knowledge even if it is
[54:48] instead of born-againment
[54:53] oh this this is
[55:09] he's building an intellectual Kingdom
[55:14] and nowadays that's what people want
[55:16] intellectuals
[55:17] they want someone that has a lot of
[55:20] intellect
[55:22] I can tell them really nice words
[55:26] and the people are looking for that why
[55:29] because it's a day of much knowledge
[55:32] that has increased
[55:35] it's an intellectual Kingdom that
[55:38] they're building
[55:40] that will outshine Christ's little bitty
[55:44] flock
[55:47] imagine that it will outshine Christ's
[55:51] little bitty
[55:59] why have we come to where we're at today
[56:03] and then he says fallen angels
[56:08] okay we're finding who our enemy is
[56:13] because we was done with letting the
[56:16] enemy come in and ruin our lives
[56:22] are sick and tired of getting kicked in
[56:25] the guts
[56:29] it just seemed like the enemy just comes
[56:32] in and boom boom boom
[56:34] but what he says what's going on it's
[56:37] these Fallen names
[56:39] there was war in heaven
[56:42] the Bible said it was Fallen Angels
[56:46] who listen to Lucifer
[56:50] instead of Christ
[56:53] and then he says who they once belong to
[56:58] oh my goodness these Fallen Angels
[57:02] listen to Lucifer
[57:05] surprise who they once belong to
[57:08] Now isn't that the same thing today is
[57:12] that when those Fallen Angels come to
[57:14] anoint someone
[57:16] what do they do they began to listen to
[57:19] Lucifer
[57:21] rather than to Christ who they once were
[57:28] they belong to him is that right let's
[57:32] go back to the beginning then when God
[57:35] created these angels
[57:38] He created them
[57:40] to worship him
[57:43] oh my here we are we're talking about
[57:46] the true worshiper now
[57:48] he created these angels
[57:50] to worship him and he made different
[57:54] kinds of angels
[57:56] He made archangels
[58:00] seraphims different orders of Angels On
[58:04] and On we can go on the different kinds
[58:06] of angels
[58:09] these angels
[58:11] are amazing
[58:14] who worship
[58:17] all right
[58:18] I want you to get this once again these
[58:22] angels estos Angeles are amazing
[58:25] you talk about knowing how to worship
[58:29] they were made for that
[58:33] sometimes we can't even raise our hand
[58:35] in church
[58:39] hello everybody hola sometimes we feel
[58:43] like we've been run over by a
[58:44] steamroller
[58:50] wonderful Wow way to go
[58:56] oh my gosh I do think you
[59:02] that's all they do
[59:04] that's what they do it's Lucas they
[59:06] worship Him watch
[59:09] how tremendous this is
[59:12] those spirits that come from the Throne
[59:16] of God
[59:17] they're around the throne and they come
[59:21] from the Throne of God
[59:23] and they stand Before the Throne of God
[59:27] how many of you could stand Before the
[59:29] Throne of God
[59:31] oh come on now we're Christians we're
[59:35] going in a Rapture can you stand Before
[59:38] the Throne
[59:39] his Angel stood Before the Throne of God
[59:43] this is in the message this is questions
[59:45] and answers on
[59:47] Hebrews
[59:48] and billions and billions
[59:52] and Aeons of time
[59:55] before the world even began
[59:59] they were in the presence of God
[1:00:03] and then he says do you think they don't
[1:00:06] know something about worship
[1:00:09] foreign
[1:00:37] why what have we missed
[1:00:39] come on now what have we missed as true
[1:00:42] worshipers
[1:00:44] we are too Earthbound
[1:00:48] our focus is on
[1:00:51] material things
[1:00:55] yes or yes COC look look we have our
[1:00:59] little habits
[1:01:01] we should no more here people have their
[1:01:04] little habits real things on the side
[1:01:07] blah blah blah at the end of the day let
[1:01:11] me ask you what do you know about
[1:01:13] worship
[1:01:16] let's stop there for a moment because we
[1:01:19] take it for granted that people
[1:01:20] understand
[1:01:22] so ask yourself the question
[1:01:25] what do I really know about worship
[1:01:28] billions and billions of years these
[1:01:31] angels worship
[1:01:34] what do I know about it
[1:01:37] this is what we know about worship yes
[1:01:49] we're back home in the same atmosphere
[1:01:55] aren't we missing something
[1:01:58] you put on a tape every now and then
[1:02:01] we pray every now and then
[1:02:04] but we're worshipers
[1:02:06] everyone whose name is not on that
[1:02:09] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:02:21] how many of you have his Worship in you
[1:02:26] what happened come on think about this
[1:02:29] he's gonna let you go today
[1:02:32] until we have gone to the soul
[1:02:36] we answer that question today
[1:02:39] do I know about worship
[1:02:43] ah
[1:02:45] come on it has nothing to do with
[1:02:48] religion nothing
[1:02:50] hello everybody we think because we're
[1:02:53] religious that we are worshipers
[1:02:57] all these angels worshiped him for
[1:03:00] billions of years
[1:03:02] don't do you think they don't know
[1:03:05] something about worship
[1:03:08] but then they fell and they come down
[1:03:11] and they get right into man
[1:03:15] watch this now they get right into man
[1:03:19] and
[1:03:20] they worship God yes
[1:03:23] oh oh this is gonna get hot that's all I
[1:03:27] know
[1:03:28] I'm gonna say it again they come down
[1:03:31] they get into man
[1:03:35] brother Bradham says Cain was a
[1:03:38] worshiper also
[1:03:40] absolutely
[1:03:43] absolutely they worship God and they
[1:03:47] have a knowledge of God
[1:03:49] because they have been around the throne
[1:03:53] and they're smart
[1:03:57] and educated
[1:03:59] but God rejected them from the beginning
[1:04:06] my goodness this that's that's a that's
[1:04:09] a mouthful I don't know if if you're
[1:04:10] ready for this message
[1:04:15] hear these fallen angels
[1:04:20] and they'll make you worship
[1:04:26] no matter what what condition you're in
[1:04:28] oh yeah they'll make they know something
[1:04:30] about words
[1:04:32] so therefore he says
[1:04:35] friend Amigo membership of a church
[1:04:40] knowledge of some theology
[1:04:44] doesn't have one thing to do with it
[1:04:49] it's got to be the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:56] joins you to him as one person
[1:05:00] he says there you are yeah oh okay oh
[1:05:05] see there are the angels
[1:05:07] and God is yours and the spirit that's
[1:05:11] joined with God
[1:05:13] there's one Spirit
[1:05:15] my question is is your spirit joined to
[1:05:18] him
[1:05:20] if it is it's one Spirit
[1:05:23] now the spirit of God
[1:05:34] that God knew before the foundation
[1:05:39] they rejected the devil's life
[1:05:45] and that Spirit yes take a body of Flesh
[1:05:51] to come and be tested
[1:05:54] he says to take his testing
[1:05:59] hmm
[1:06:01] so now we know we're being tested
[1:06:04] this is ABC's right yes sir see
[1:06:09] in doing this
[1:06:11] watch our founding Pastor here
[1:06:14] but in all things
[1:06:16] we go we go to the to the drama in
[1:06:19] heaven now is
[1:06:21] Lucifer are you ready let's go into
[1:06:24] heaven I love it when brother Brown
[1:06:27] would say
[1:06:28] just go back with me many questions of
[1:06:31] years ago before the world was ever
[1:06:33] formed let's go way back how many want
[1:06:35] to take a trip this morning
[1:06:39] but in all this is
[1:06:42] he made one angel
[1:06:44] that was bigger
[1:06:46] more beautiful than anybody else
[1:06:51] how many think you're beautiful
[1:06:57] never mind I'm gonna I'm gonna get off
[1:06:59] on these on these exits and I can't get
[1:07:01] back on
[1:07:02] don't listen okay he was more beautiful
[1:07:04] than anybody else
[1:07:06] he was the son of the morning
[1:07:09] the one called Lucifer Lucifer best
[1:07:13] looking of all the angels Los Angeles
[1:07:17] Michael was big
[1:07:20] pretty good looking
[1:07:23] but not as good looking out yes
[1:07:28] and he put
[1:07:30] charged
[1:07:33] he put in charge Lucifer and Michael
[1:07:40] a Miguel de Lucifer and God knowing what
[1:07:43] he was doing
[1:07:44] God knew
[1:07:46] what he was doing the whole time
[1:07:50] there was nothing or there was something
[1:07:53] in Lucifer
[1:07:55] that God had put in there
[1:08:00] that I want you to watch this God
[1:08:04] knowing what he was doing
[1:08:07] there was something in Lucifer and
[1:08:10] Lucifer that he didn't put in Michael
[1:08:13] okay no puso and Miguel
[1:08:16] so because of this little thing
[1:08:20] God put in Lucifer Lucifer
[1:08:25] exalted himself
[1:08:28] watch it watch it he says when you ask
[1:08:31] for a gift
[1:08:35] gifts can fail
[1:08:37] but the word cannot failure
[1:08:41] in other words Lucifer had a special
[1:08:44] little gift in him
[1:08:46] while Michael had the word
[1:08:50] like that again Lucifer had a little
[1:08:54] special gift in here
[1:08:56] but Michael had the word in here
[1:09:00] this little bitty thing of Lucifer
[1:09:05] it interfered with Michael
[1:09:08] he would look around
[1:09:10] he would say
[1:09:13] I'm better looking than Michael just to
[1:09:15] imagine
[1:09:16] nobody ever do that
[1:09:19] be careful you know what spirit is
[1:09:26] I'm better looking than Michael
[1:09:28] I'm a little bigger than him
[1:09:35] probably laugh at me
[1:09:37] my spiritual man though
[1:09:43] and there was war in heaven
[1:09:47] the right-hand man of man of God
[1:09:50] Almighty was Lucifer
[1:09:53] son of the morning
[1:09:56] and God granted him almost
[1:09:59] co-workers with him
[1:10:02] he was a co-worker
[1:10:06] partly equal with him because
[1:10:10] now Church you want to know who your
[1:10:13] enemy is
[1:10:16] going into this there was war in heaven
[1:10:19] that war has come down to earth yes
[1:10:23] and if you know him back then you'll
[1:10:26] know him today
[1:10:28] characteristics
[1:10:30] all this Satan could not create
[1:10:34] saying could not create
[1:10:37] God is the only Creator
[1:10:40] but Satan took something
[1:10:44] that God created
[1:10:46] and he perverted it back into something
[1:10:49] else
[1:11:03] to God
[1:11:05] number two is
[1:11:07] but he saw Michael Miguel
[1:11:11] Michael had something in him
[1:11:15] he had the word
[1:11:19] and the first thing that Lucifer does
[1:11:23] oh
[1:11:25] is the same thing we do nowadays
[1:11:30] we get jealous
[1:11:32] and why do they have
[1:11:36] watch him he was not content with what
[1:11:39] God had given us
[1:11:41] we wanted to be greater than God
[1:11:45] he wanted to be the one that everybody
[1:11:48] revered
[1:11:50] he wanted to be worshiped but he was
[1:11:54] jealous about about Michael
[1:11:58] notice this now oh I like this
[1:12:01] Lucifer's lust for power
[1:12:05] blessed to have more
[1:12:08] it's lost to have what Michael has
[1:12:12] and that began his downfall yes
[1:12:16] there was war in heaven
[1:12:20] and what does he do he cast it he
[1:12:23] betrays Michael
[1:12:25] Miguel and he began to make himself
[1:12:29] brother Branham says
[1:12:31] he begins to make himself a great
[1:12:34] Kingdom in the north
[1:12:37] go back and hear the one that's uh that
[1:12:39] brother Abraham preached on like the
[1:12:42] sides of the north and why he took all
[1:12:43] that
[1:12:46] I'm after something here
[1:12:48] you see it should have only been one
[1:12:51] Kingdom
[1:12:53] but jealousy and betrayal
[1:12:57] caused him to set up his own kingdom
[1:13:02] oh my it's no different in the churches
[1:13:05] today
[1:13:09] jealousy and betrayal
[1:13:12] we can have every excuse why we do what
[1:13:15] we do
[1:13:18] the end of the day you're either
[1:13:21] anointed by Michael or by luciferous
[1:13:27] well this I don't you know what there is
[1:13:30] another anointing
[1:13:36] oh I don't know if that one's set really
[1:13:39] good or not
[1:13:41] jealousy and betrayal
[1:13:44] cause people to go and want to set up
[1:13:47] their own kingdom
[1:13:50] no uh jealousy and betrayal causes
[1:13:54] people yeah
[1:13:56] we're going to want to get rather do
[1:13:58] their own kingdom
[1:14:00] Lucifer doing the same thing today
[1:14:08] do you know what caused the first battle
[1:14:10] in heaven
[1:14:12] come on now all these things you got to
[1:14:14] get all this so that we understand the
[1:14:16] end
[1:14:18] you know what caused the first battle in
[1:14:21] heaven
[1:14:22] this is the message let your light so
[1:14:25] shine before men
[1:14:29] was when Lucifer Lucifer set up a
[1:14:33] greater class of people Grande
[1:14:39] he got a better class of angels
[1:14:47] or so he thought huh
[1:14:50] big Grande bigger Kingdom
[1:14:55] a more brighter
[1:14:58] shinier Kingdom than Michael had okay
[1:15:02] yes Lucifer the son of the morning
[1:15:06] exalted himself in Beauty
[1:15:09] and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than
[1:15:13] that of Michaels
[1:15:16] because he thought that God dwelt in
[1:15:19] Beauty
[1:15:22] Lucifer had a beautiful kingdom
[1:15:26] when he came in everyone
[1:15:30] all the Angels began to look at him and
[1:15:33] say wow episode wow he's impressive
[1:15:41] check him out El Impressions
[1:15:52] this is a battle of war going on in
[1:15:55] heaven
[1:15:56] so he looks at this all these angels
[1:16:00] these angels that were that were under
[1:16:02] in his
[1:16:03] kingdomeness
[1:16:08] Lucifer Lucifer they'd see him and they
[1:16:11] would say he's awesome
[1:16:14] this man this creature
[1:16:16] whatever they would call him he's so
[1:16:20] beautiful
[1:16:22] that's the way a lot of preachers
[1:16:26] a lot of churches think today muchas
[1:16:30] Iglesias they think that they're the
[1:16:33] greatest
[1:16:35] where did that Spirit come from
[1:16:43] sorry I don't laugh I'm not laughing at
[1:16:45] you I'm laughing at the Devil Diablo
[1:16:49] we're the greatest
[1:16:51] no one likes us
[1:16:57] where did that filthy dirty Spirit come
[1:17:00] from
[1:17:02] there is nothing great
[1:17:05] except that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:08] he is the great one he has come to dwell
[1:17:12] in his church
[1:17:14] the holy church
[1:17:17] the holy God in the church
[1:17:20] it's the holy God in the church
[1:17:22] it's not the Holy Mountain it's the holy
[1:17:25] God that comes down to the mountains
[1:17:31] your holy ghost that comes to the heart
[1:17:34] of them
[1:17:36] where are these Spirits
[1:17:41] fallen angels
[1:17:47] everybody okay with me so far we're
[1:17:50] going through a drama here
[1:17:53] yes
[1:17:55] Lucifer at the beginning
[1:17:58] his purpose
[1:18:02] was to achieve a brighter
[1:18:06] and greater thing in heaven than Christ
[1:18:12] then Christ happened
[1:18:14] is that right by seemingly a more
[1:18:18] cultured
[1:18:20] more beautiful more splendors
[1:18:28] yeah
[1:18:29] wow
[1:18:31] the Bible says in Ezekiel 38 full of
[1:18:34] wisdom
[1:18:37] perfect in Beauty perfect
[1:18:41] that's
[1:18:42] our enemy is
[1:18:49] tell your neighbor neighbor
[1:18:51] yeah
[1:18:53] wow full of wisdom and perfect and
[1:18:56] Beauty
[1:18:58] now Lucifer means
[1:19:07] he was the most beautiful of any being
[1:19:09] that God had created
[1:19:13] only I think it Lucifer's I think it's
[1:19:16] only mentioned one time in the Bible
[1:19:19] talked about in different places
[1:19:22] but in Isaiah chapter 14.
[1:19:28] this prophet Isaiah
[1:19:30] it says how are thou fallen from Heaven
[1:19:33] oh Lucifer son of the morning
[1:19:36] how art thou cut down to the ground
[1:19:39] which did weaken the Nations
[1:19:50] were taught in English
[1:19:52] most of the time
[1:19:55] when a a sentence starts with how well
[1:20:00] it's usually a question
[1:20:04] but if you notice here
[1:20:07] there is
[1:20:09] no question mark
[1:20:14] because these are not two questions that
[1:20:17] the prophet is asking
[1:20:19] he's not asking how art thou fallen from
[1:20:22] Heaven
[1:20:24] he's not saying that we already know how
[1:20:27] he fell from him he was cast down from
[1:20:30] him
[1:20:30] but he's there's an exclamation mark
[1:20:35] in both of these sentences
[1:20:40] he says how art thou fallen from Heaven
[1:20:44] oh Lucifer son of the morning
[1:20:50] but he's making an exclamation
[1:20:54] at an exclamation mark or point
[1:20:58] it always denotes a strong emotions
[1:21:03] this Prophet is
[1:21:06] saying this is a strong emotions
[1:21:14] something that has rocked his world
[1:21:17] that it's hard to understand
[1:21:20] how such a creature of such beauty
[1:21:27] how could you fall down from heaven
[1:21:31] you are number two with God
[1:21:34] you could do everything except create
[1:21:39] Isaiah can't capture
[1:21:45] how is it possible that you would fall
[1:21:50] what an emotion is going on here
[1:21:54] the same thing when brother Bradham
[1:21:57] preaches the message
[1:22:00] there's an emotion there
[1:22:02] when he's giving you the Holy Ghost
[1:22:08] paid the price on the cross
[1:22:13] why would you turn it down
[1:22:18] I'm here with me are you getting what
[1:22:19] Isaiah is talking about because he said
[1:22:22] he said yes you had everything you had
[1:22:25] Beauty again you had Charisma you have
[1:22:30] the respect of the Angels you had a
[1:22:33] position
[1:22:36] you had everything
[1:22:39] how are thou fallen from him
[1:22:45] what emotion he's using to describe this
[1:22:49] and he uses two words to describe
[1:22:52] Lucifer's descent
[1:22:58] his descent
[1:23:01] Fallen okay he's this and cut down if it
[1:23:05] is cortado
[1:23:07] read it again say that again
[1:23:12] from Heaven yes
[1:23:20] it's weak in the nation
[1:23:23] if that happened to him
[1:23:26] what about us
[1:23:30] he continues with this strong emotion
[1:23:35] describing why the demise or the death
[1:23:39] of Lucifer as the right hand of God is
[1:23:45] describing why this happened
[1:23:50] there's such an emotion behind this as a
[1:23:52] prophet
[1:23:54] and now he's going to tell you the
[1:23:57] reason
[1:24:00] you ready listos verse 13. this is why
[1:24:04] you were cut down and you have followed
[1:24:06] foreign I
[1:24:12] will
[1:24:14] stop right there
[1:24:17] I will
[1:24:20] watch now because those angels must have
[1:24:24] had
[1:24:25] the ability to choose
[1:24:31] come on now this is important church it
[1:24:33] was important
[1:24:35] because sometimes we we we we're it's
[1:24:38] like we're fighting the air is we don't
[1:24:41] know how to fight the good fight
[1:24:44] he's telling us today how to fight this
[1:24:48] he said because thou has said in thine
[1:24:50] Hearts
[1:24:52] I will Ascend into heaven
[1:24:57] this that we're reading there are five
[1:25:00] Wills of Lucifer
[1:25:03] follow these things because when you
[1:25:06] find yourself dealing with these wheels
[1:25:10] I know exactly where what's going on
[1:25:13] here
[1:25:15] I will Ascend into heaven number one
[1:25:18] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:25:22] of God
[1:25:25] I will
[1:25:27] sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:25:29] congregation in the sides of the north
[1:25:33] I will Ascend above the height of the
[1:25:36] clouds
[1:25:38] and I will be like the most highest
[1:25:42] five wheels of Lucifer
[1:25:44] Lucifer that will yes shows once again
[1:25:48] that he could choose
[1:25:52] it expresses his will
[1:25:55] and that was the sin is yellow
[1:26:07] he figured out in control I can choose
[1:26:11] and I can have
[1:26:13] what I want well
[1:26:16] I'm going to say it again I can choose
[1:26:19] and I can do what I want
[1:26:21] the Brown says yeah you can do whatever
[1:26:23] you want yeah
[1:26:25] don't you think for a moment that
[1:26:36] when you think that you're making the
[1:26:38] choice on my own and I'm doing my own
[1:26:40] thing in life
[1:26:42] here we go on chop all my hair off oh
[1:26:48] where did you get that Spirit
[1:26:50] Michael never taught that Miguel
[1:26:59] then
[1:27:01] iniquity was founded foreign
[1:27:08] this
[1:27:10] is Satan's plan is
[1:27:15] these are the steps estas the stages of
[1:27:21] someone who wants to be worshiped
[1:27:24] I will I will I will I will I will be
[1:27:29] careful when you say I will I want kids
[1:27:34] what Spirit do you have okay
[1:27:37] but Michael on the other hand
[1:27:41] is never Associated
[1:27:44] we're speaking about his will
[1:27:49] yo
[1:28:01] it's always been God's perfect will um
[1:28:05] this is the war this is the battle in
[1:28:08] heaven
[1:28:09] Michael is always known as the one who
[1:28:12] stands
[1:28:17] oh come on now what's the difference in
[1:28:20] these Spirits
[1:28:22] the Bible says on that day Michael shall
[1:28:25] stand
[1:28:27] he said Michael is Christ Miguel es
[1:28:31] Cristo and while Lucifer was intent
[1:28:33] Lucifer
[1:28:35] he was intent elinto was being like the
[1:28:40] most highest
[1:28:41] the meaning of the name of Michael El
[1:28:45] Lombre significado de Miguel is not only
[1:28:47] a question but a declaration
[1:28:51] you think God named him Michael just to
[1:28:53] name him Michaels
[1:28:56] I have heard Minister say this
[1:28:59] I'm not throwing I'm just a statement
[1:29:02] here I've heard different ones that have
[1:29:04] said
[1:29:06] who is like God
[1:29:10] hmm
[1:29:11] and so we can preach a message
[1:29:14] that's not what Michael means
[1:29:22] come on now come on now I'm telling you
[1:29:25] here I want you to get this Captain
[1:29:27] there was war in heaven
[1:29:29] and the war was words
[1:29:40] what is my name
[1:29:43] what do you mean
[1:29:46] oh you know my name yeah
[1:29:50] the word Michael means
[1:29:54] who is like God question mark
[1:30:00] did you get that I'm gonna say it again
[1:30:03] the very name is a question
[1:30:06] it is the meaning of his name is
[1:30:11] like God no no no no no it's Lucifer
[1:30:14] wanted to be like
[1:30:16] God's name means
[1:30:18] question who is like God
[1:30:23] and it also means
[1:30:27] there is none like God
[1:30:31] think of that for a moment
[1:30:36] there's a war in heaven
[1:30:39] I'm gonna be like the most high God
[1:30:43] and Michael said no immigration no no
[1:30:46] one who is like God you know
[1:30:49] nobody like him no you don't want a
[1:30:51] battle of words
[1:31:31] Thou Art the anointed cherub that is
[1:31:36] portento
[1:31:39] and I I'm just going to read it in
[1:31:40] English to save some time here totally I
[1:31:42] have set these soul
[1:31:44] thou wasst upon the holy mountain of God
[1:31:47] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[1:31:49] of the stones of fire
[1:31:51] thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[1:31:54] day that thou was created
[1:31:57] till iniquity was found in thee
[1:32:01] iniquity knowing to do right
[1:32:09] right or knowing what's wrong
[1:32:14] still doing it yes
[1:32:18] now when we see this we see how this all
[1:32:21] started in heaven
[1:32:23] and the question is is this and this is
[1:32:27] the part that I just I can't wrap my
[1:32:29] mind around
[1:32:32] says sin started in heaven
[1:32:44] and there's some sin around the throne
[1:32:49] oh
[1:32:50] that's blowed my mind
[1:32:54] I can't put my mind around that no
[1:32:57] purpose
[1:33:02] so now
[1:33:05] it starts to get heated now
[1:33:09] now the battle is getting heated now
[1:33:13] ain't nobody like God
[1:33:15] but Lucifer thought he could do things a
[1:33:18] little better than God
[1:33:23] because you have to disbelieve first
[1:33:27] when you and your life understands to be
[1:33:30] there we think we can bring this message
[1:33:32] better than brother Brown
[1:33:36] watch it we just say
[1:33:40] do ya
[1:33:43] people think they don't need a profit no
[1:33:45] more
[1:33:46] like I said before how many years has it
[1:33:49] been Israel with with Moses
[1:33:53] 3000 3700. 3 500 years ago
[1:33:59] and that's still their profit
[1:34:03] 57 years after he's passed away
[1:34:06] I don't know if he's a prophetess no
[1:34:12] I just say wow really wow
[1:34:19] God began to unveil his plan
[1:34:24] his Plan of Redemption here we go
[1:34:27] he's gonna Place Mana Lombre on free
[1:34:31] moral agencies
[1:34:33] here's the battle now come on because we
[1:34:36] all deal with this we all deal with free
[1:34:39] moral ages
[1:34:40] we all have free moral ladies
[1:34:44] all right
[1:34:45] yeah is there somebody here that doesn't
[1:34:48] I know what you're going to say
[1:34:50] once I chose the Lord I don't have three
[1:34:54] moral agencies
[1:34:55] but until we get to that place
[1:34:59] we are still three moral agents
[1:35:01] okay so now here's the battle now
[1:35:07] it's not just about them too
[1:35:11] but now it's time for these angels that
[1:35:15] are listening
[1:35:17] let's see who's got a better message
[1:35:19] don't forget Lucifer had Charisma
[1:35:23] oh he could preach
[1:35:28] I don't know what else he could do
[1:35:31] but man he was scared he was charismatic
[1:35:34] charismatic and he could sway a person
[1:35:37] or an angel
[1:35:41] so here it starts inside plan me plan
[1:35:45] free moral agents and through that plan
[1:35:49] I want man
[1:35:54] I want Isaiah Isaiah I want them
[1:35:59] to choose
[1:36:03] okay
[1:36:04] how many here have free moral agency to
[1:36:06] choose
[1:36:10] maybe not some of you don't think you
[1:36:13] don't no much they made me come to
[1:36:15] church today
[1:36:16] I didn't want to come to church well
[1:36:27] yeah sometimes it's sometimes it seems
[1:36:31] pretty rough
[1:36:33] it's better for what's best for you
[1:36:37] young people
[1:36:38] old people
[1:36:40] he wanted man to choose to serve him
[1:36:48] get it close get it young people
[1:36:50] especially now
[1:36:52] Satan offers many things
[1:36:57] but God just simply wanted Bo
[1:37:00] I want Bo to choose
[1:37:06] put your name there put your name there
[1:37:09] I just want Lily to serve me
[1:37:15] she's coming at a rough time
[1:37:18] oh brother Noah you're coming at a rough
[1:37:21] time that's the hardest age there is no
[1:37:25] I've made Provisions for them but I want
[1:37:28] them to choose
[1:37:32] oh here's the fighting the one Angel
[1:37:36] angels over here
[1:37:41] they're wanting to know which side
[1:37:44] should I choose
[1:37:46] God begins to continues to unravel his
[1:37:49] plans to plan or open up his plan
[1:37:52] he then would go down
[1:37:55] he said and I'll go and I'll redeem man
[1:37:58] he says
[1:37:59] who return him back to me
[1:38:02] he would do the work of redemption
[1:38:07] therefore would fulfill the requirements
[1:38:11] of a kinsman redeemer to the human race
[1:38:15] and then after Redemption what would be
[1:38:19] fulfilled he would bring a message of
[1:38:22] restoration
[1:38:24] back to their original condition
[1:38:28] the redeemed man would be entitled to
[1:38:31] the claiming rights
[1:38:35] as a redeemed restored Son of God
[1:38:39] and all this would be done
[1:39:12] me gusta how many of you like that plan
[1:39:16] a way to get you back to him
[1:39:20] but what did Lucifer do but okay
[1:39:24] he gathered his angels and then said
[1:39:27] Michael come on bring your angels let's
[1:39:30] have a little debate
[1:39:32] Michael said I don't like debates
[1:39:34] well you preached the message first then
[1:39:37] and then I'll preach after years
[1:39:39] gather them together and then Lucifer's
[1:39:43] time came
[1:39:44] I want to show you all a better plan
[1:39:48] oh my God here we go here's the battle
[1:39:52] here's the war in heaven better plan
[1:39:55] than what God has
[1:39:58] why go through all the trouble
[1:40:01] problema why give them free moral agency
[1:40:06] just force them to do it
[1:40:09] force them to love you foreign
[1:40:17] are you why are you seeing this battle
[1:40:19] what's going on here in heaven
[1:40:23] moral agencies
[1:40:29] come on don't tell me that the same
[1:40:31] thing don't happen in the church
[1:40:33] don't tell me it's not the same thing
[1:40:34] that happens in the homes okay
[1:40:38] forced religion
[1:40:40] and we are very good at knowing about
[1:40:43] that is
[1:40:49] so they began to hear this
[1:40:52] he said a better plan
[1:40:54] the message adoption brother Brown says
[1:40:58] and Lucifer was the first one to take
[1:41:01] the wrong road
[1:41:05] he began to draw after him
[1:41:10] trying to take all for himself
[1:41:16] is Mio my
[1:41:24] um
[1:41:30] forget it
[1:41:33] watch this now quizzes here he goes and
[1:41:36] he began becomes hoggish by the random
[1:41:38] says
[1:41:42] taking all for himself
[1:41:44] and trying to override everyone else he
[1:42:09] thank you
[1:42:13] once again
[1:42:15] explain yourself Lucifer a little bit
[1:42:16] more
[1:42:18] why give them free moral agency
[1:42:24] why the cross
[1:42:28] wow
[1:42:30] why the suffering
[1:42:33] why the pain and the Lord the Lord and
[1:42:37] you want them your children to go
[1:42:39] through that
[1:42:41] we can skip the cross
[1:42:44] give them a better this is a better idea
[1:42:47] and nobody has to suffer
[1:42:56] what a battle going on
[1:42:59] I go down why would God have to go down
[1:43:02] and become a man
[1:43:04] one of the most asked questions today
[1:43:08] how can all powerful holy God
[1:43:12] stand there with his arms crossed
[1:43:15] watching all these men women and
[1:43:18] children suffer meaning
[1:43:23] how can he let bad things happen to good
[1:43:26] people
[1:43:29] everybody
[1:43:31] possible
[1:43:34] we don't need to do that
[1:43:37] don't let them suffering
[1:43:41] let's go my way
[1:43:43] just force Emma say Emma You're Gonna
[1:43:46] Love the Lord that's all there is to it
[1:43:49] on your mind
[1:43:51] I've made up your my mind your mind for
[1:43:53] you
[1:43:55] really
[1:43:58] and and Christ oh Michael Miguel
[1:44:04] and Michael says no no but those other
[1:44:09] Angels
[1:44:10] third of them
[1:44:16] that's a good idea
[1:44:19] erase the cross
[1:44:21] erase the suffering foreign
[1:44:42] don't we as humans many times when we're
[1:44:45] going through something rough
[1:44:49] suffering like this is
[1:44:54] I don't understand
[1:44:57] hard the hardships
[1:45:00] I was I born into this family
[1:45:02] my loved one pass away
[1:45:05] why did these things happen when I was a
[1:45:07] child
[1:45:09] in foster homes
[1:45:12] or whatever it might be foreign
[1:45:24] and what have we lost sight of is the
[1:45:27] chemist that we have lost it is
[1:45:38] sounded his plan sounded good Lucifers
[1:45:42] but they began to be swayed
[1:45:46] and I can hear Michael says the Lord
[1:45:50] rebuked me Brenda
[1:45:55] he knew that Lucifer's plan
[1:45:58] never compared to God's plan
[1:46:02] foreign Lucifer's plan
[1:46:05] there was no manifestation of Love
[1:46:09] Church I'm coming down now to the
[1:46:12] nitty-gritty there was no manifestation
[1:46:15] of love
[1:46:16] under Lucifer's plan there was no talk
[1:46:19] of Mercy
[1:46:22] there was no talk of Grace
[1:46:25] there was no talk of faith it was all
[1:46:29] absent from Lucifers
[1:46:33] do you see what he was trying to do
[1:46:36] setting up a forced religions
[1:46:42] he said you can just make man fallen and
[1:46:47] Michael says in Miguel this day make man
[1:46:49] fall asleep just so he can redeem him
[1:46:53] that's not just
[1:46:55] foreign
[1:48:01] never have come out foreign
[1:48:42] oh my God when I'm sir some of those
[1:48:45] angels with Michael stood up and said
[1:48:49] oh yeah
[1:48:51] we see it
[1:48:54] they go down to earth
[1:48:57] they're willing to even be sick is
[1:49:04] you know if we looked at things the
[1:49:06] right way
[1:49:09] because you agreed to it
[1:49:13] why am I suffering because you agree to
[1:49:17] it
[1:49:19] yeah
[1:49:21] why am I still so lost because you
[1:49:24] agreed to it
[1:49:26] Lord I'll pull those things out of you
[1:49:30] pull the attribution
[1:49:34] complain about it is
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:50:26] who existed of himself
[1:50:34] but they knew nothing about the
[1:50:36] attributes
[1:50:39] you think God didn't know what he was
[1:50:42] doing
[1:50:44] it's something that Satan didn't catch
[1:50:50] when those attributes would be pulled
[1:50:53] out
[1:50:56] mine and your names were attached to it
[1:51:01] I'm going to say it again my name and
[1:51:03] yours was attached to that attribution
[1:51:10] this is why the Seven Seals
[1:51:15] that could not be preached until this
[1:51:17] end time
[1:51:19] God would send a prophet
[1:51:22] he would began to preach
[1:51:25] the same message that they heard from
[1:51:28] the beginning
[1:51:31] here's God what is he doing now
[1:51:34] I think he let Lucifer know all history
[1:51:38] no no no no no all those names who were
[1:51:42] attached to those attributes
[1:51:50] they were hidden Christ
[1:51:53] those names would not be revealed Until
[1:51:56] the End
[1:51:58] battle gets comes to earth now we're
[1:52:00] going to get there
[1:52:02] after next time
[1:52:05] can I have like 10 15 minutes
[1:52:08] there was war in heaven
[1:52:10] under forced religion
[1:52:13] attributes will never be pulled out
[1:52:18] but under free moral ages
[1:52:22] I want them to choose
[1:52:25] I love them
[1:52:28] but I want them to love me back
[1:52:32] and nobody forcing them foreign
[1:52:49] hello everybody
[1:52:53] thank you
[1:52:56] you see
[1:52:58] a forced religion
[1:53:01] right in you now
[1:53:03] to bring all the little groups into one
[1:53:06] great Unity they call it
[1:53:10] there was war in heaven
[1:53:16] he wanted to keep those attributes
[1:53:21] being expressed
[1:53:24] so that God wouldn't be worshiped by his
[1:53:27] family
[1:53:30] as I said in a in a way that he had
[1:53:32] never been worshiped
[1:53:36] no one had ever worshiped him as a
[1:53:38] savior
[1:53:41] no one had ever worshiped him as a
[1:53:43] Healer
[1:53:45] been sick to that point
[1:53:48] oh Michael's desire
[1:53:51] whole desire was for God to receive all
[1:53:55] honor and glory and praise
[1:54:01] that's why on the inside of your spirit
[1:54:04] is a soul
[1:54:06] and it's controlled by controlled by one
[1:54:09] thing is
[1:54:12] Faith or doubts
[1:54:14] you can accept what the devil says
[1:54:18] you can accept What God Says and that'll
[1:54:22] determine yes
[1:54:27] oh
[1:54:33] let me skip some of this
[1:54:40] I'll go
[1:54:42] and this is the message you've heard
[1:54:44] from the beginning
[1:54:48] and if that which you have heard from
[1:54:50] the beginning
[1:54:51] shall remain in you
[1:54:55] you also shall continue in the Sun and
[1:54:58] in the father
[1:55:00] and this is the promise that he have
[1:55:03] promised us yes
[1:55:06] eternal life
[1:55:08] now in adoption he says this
[1:55:10] watch what the battle continues
[1:55:13] you trinitarian Brotherhood I'm not
[1:55:17] wanting to hurt you
[1:55:18] but how in the name of the good word of
[1:55:21] God
[1:55:22] would you ever Place Jesus as being a
[1:55:25] separate person from God himself
[1:55:29] if Jesus could take another person
[1:55:32] make him go and die to redeem this
[1:55:36] person here
[1:55:38] would be an unjust being
[1:55:41] um there's only one way that God could
[1:55:44] ever do it
[1:55:45] would be to take the place himself
[1:55:49] God became flesh
[1:55:55] he's not asking you to do something that
[1:55:57] he didn't do himself
[1:56:00] come on now pinch yourself a little bit
[1:56:02] we're we're all we're almost done for
[1:56:04] the day
[1:56:05] he became flesh that he also might taste
[1:56:10] the Pains of death
[1:56:13] sting and death away from us
[1:56:17] that we might be Redeemed by his own
[1:56:21] and because he tasted of that
[1:56:25] that's why he'll be so worshiped at the
[1:56:29] end
[1:56:30] that's why the worship he'll receive at
[1:56:33] the end foreign
[1:57:17] our Buckler
[1:57:19] yellow
[1:57:48] what do we want to find out today is I'm
[1:57:50] going I'm coming around the corner
[1:57:52] what do we want to find out today
[1:57:55] I want to know what side my angel chose
[1:58:01] nothing else matters
[1:58:04] it doesn't matter how religious you are
[1:58:07] saying don't care about that
[1:58:09] but I want to know how many want to know
[1:58:19] that angel is your representation
[1:58:23] your heavenly representative don't
[1:58:25] forget that representations
[1:58:29] yes the Bible says awaken the gift that
[1:58:32] is
[1:58:35] because by that is the only way you can
[1:58:39] tell is
[1:58:40] there which kingdom you belong
[1:58:51] the only way is to examine the
[1:58:53] characteristic of the gene is
[1:58:59] [Applause]
[1:59:02] what's the characteristic of the gene
[1:59:04] that's inside
[1:59:08] oh
[1:59:13] that Gene can only put forth what it has
[1:59:16] inside of it
[1:59:20] some people can't help doing what they
[1:59:22] do
[1:59:24] they have no representation
[1:59:30] When I See This
[1:59:32] I realize entiendo the Bible says
[1:59:36] blessed is the man
[1:59:39] that sin is not imputed to him
[1:59:43] that's such a big thing churches
[1:59:46] blessed is that man is not impurities
[1:59:49] you see those angels that fell in the
[1:59:52] beginning
[1:59:53] by hearing Lucifer's lies
[2:00:05] because we fall in our flesh
[2:00:07] Oh What A Difference
[2:00:09] he made a way for you
[2:00:13] therefore we can repent
[2:00:16] the sin is not imputed to us
[2:00:20] because the day on Calvary we can handle
[2:00:22] it is
[2:00:28] did your angel sin we must find that out
[2:00:32] and that's why when you answer the sin
[2:00:45] blessed is that man
[2:00:50] years ago
[2:00:51] I'm going to tell you a few stories and
[2:00:53] then I'm gonna then I'm gonna stop
[2:00:56] it was war in heaven
[2:00:58] years ago and maybe some of you may
[2:01:01] remember this is
[2:01:02] a certain lady and I and I don't want to
[2:01:05] of course it's it doesn't matter who it
[2:01:07] is
[2:01:12] when she spoke she spoke not as a not as
[2:01:16] a lady's voice
[2:01:20] but it was a deep manly voice
[2:01:24] and I remember
[2:01:26] that
[2:01:28] that our pastor took a picture of
[2:01:29] brother Branham
[2:01:32] that one right there yes and
[2:01:37] put the picture right in front of it
[2:01:42] right away that demon
[2:01:45] said I'm on your eyes wow
[2:01:48] angry
[2:01:50] mad upset being in a rile that demon up
[2:01:56] and our pastor asked the question says
[2:02:01] why do you hate him so much
[2:02:06] he said because he cast me down
[2:02:12] the sister wouldn't have known that
[2:02:14] noise
[2:02:17] but that demon dude
[2:02:23] and he looks at him he says why do you
[2:02:25] hate me
[2:02:28] because you were with him in the
[2:02:30] beginning
[2:02:33] foreign
[2:02:56] but who are you
[2:02:59] come on now here we are now
[2:03:04] we become hitchhikers
[2:03:10] and then those demons jump on us and we
[2:03:12] we become their transportation
[2:03:16] we need to stop that is
[2:03:20] God's word calls for a total separation
[2:03:26] these Devils with us wherever we go
[2:03:31] and the dragon was cast out
[2:03:34] that old serpenter called The Devil in
[2:03:38] Satan
[2:03:39] who deceived the whole world
[2:03:42] passed out into the Earth his angels
[2:03:45] were cast out with him
[2:03:47] go back and listen to the message
[2:03:50] brother brother Branham preaches
[2:03:53] how the angel came to me
[2:03:57] come on now these are all these are all
[2:03:59] keys for you
[2:04:01] how that angel came to me
[2:04:06] foreign
[2:04:12] we could get into real deep stuff right
[2:04:13] here
[2:04:18] it's important to know where that angel
[2:04:21] came from
[2:04:23] says I don't doubt that Joseph Smith
[2:04:26] saw an angel
[2:04:29] but what that angel told him was not
[2:04:32] scripture
[2:04:36] and when I see that that angel that has
[2:04:38] come that brother Brandon would always
[2:04:39] wait for it
[2:04:42] that was the Heavenly Angels but when it
[2:04:46] would come down and he would say now I'm
[2:04:47] waiting for someone
[2:04:49] you know I'm waiting for him
[2:04:52] he's here right now
[2:04:54] and when he would he would say that now
[2:04:58] I take every Spirit under my control
[2:05:00] what happened
[2:05:05] you say brother have you ever met an
[2:05:08] angel
[2:05:10] I had an angel that it was sent to me
[2:05:14] that was to come at the end of the age
[2:05:20] I don't need to listen to a bunch of
[2:05:22] angels anymore
[2:05:26] messenger of the age
[2:05:28] then to bring what was in the back part
[2:05:31] of God
[2:06:12] if you would but I wanna I wanna end you
[2:06:15] with this
[2:06:17] and I have to just tell you this
[2:06:19] and it's the story of our founding
[2:06:22] pastors
[2:06:23] this is why it means so much to us
[2:06:29] you've heard it many times
[2:06:32] but it goes so well with this message
[2:06:36] he lived in tier C at the time
[2:06:40] when one day a big old angel
[2:06:44] came to Israel
[2:06:47] he said my mother there was Lane next to
[2:06:50] him he said
[2:06:53] and the angel he said was real big
[2:06:57] shoulders big arms
[2:06:59] he crossed them like this looking at me
[2:07:03] I wasn't asleep
[2:07:05] I was looking up at him and I saw this
[2:07:09] Angel
[2:07:10] very handsome he wasn't ugly it was a
[2:07:15] real handsome man
[2:07:16] I noticed that out of his arms
[2:07:20] he would stretch forth his arms
[2:07:24] it was like these feathers these things
[2:07:27] that were over him
[2:07:30] one of his arms he said would stretch
[2:07:34] very wide says
[2:07:41] and he says you will go
[2:07:45] this is
[2:07:50] all about forced religions
[2:07:57] no I will he said no come on church I'm
[2:08:01] showing you this is I want you to see
[2:08:03] I'm done now because I want you to see
[2:08:06] that we all have this struggle
[2:08:09] get back to him
[2:08:12] we've come to this hickey of time
[2:08:17] he made a way back to him
[2:08:20] every demon in hell to get your soul and
[2:08:24] and pull it to the other side
[2:08:27] I'm not the only one we all are going
[2:08:29] through this
[2:08:31] he said I'm ordering you to go
[2:08:35] our Pastor said I will not go
[2:08:38] that's why we loved his characters
[2:08:44] because he wouldn't take it not from the
[2:08:46] devil not from anyone
[2:08:49] he goes like this and he hits me
[2:08:53] this is his words
[2:08:55] foreign
[2:09:45] foreign
[2:10:27] brother Branham says
[2:10:30] he said it I felt so bad when I read the
[2:10:34] scripture no man comes
[2:10:36] the father draws him oh that saddened my
[2:10:41] heart is
[2:10:42] no one will come unless the father draws
[2:10:44] him
[2:10:45] he said but then he gave me a
[2:10:48] consolation
[2:10:50] all that the father has given me
[2:10:54] they will come and not a one will be
[2:10:57] lost
[2:10:58] he's not one of you will be lost you
[2:11:00] wouldn't understand
[2:11:08] didn't want you to do it yeah
[2:11:15] he says it is a perfect will soon
[2:11:20] he says here you come you can't even
[2:11:23] supply for your wife so please
[2:11:29] if you go and do this
[2:11:34] you'll have this and you can still go
[2:11:36] you can go out and preach but you got to
[2:11:40] do this I said no I won't
[2:11:43] no I won't later I found
[2:11:48] these angels watch me closely
[2:11:51] these angels we're spirits that had come
[2:11:56] into these preachers
[2:11:57] they would come and say

[2:12:04] little bitty Dotson you have

[2:12:16] new home

[2:12:36] they would come to me would offer me
[2:12:39] come and we'll fly you anywhere you want
[2:12:42] to go

[2:13:36] that voice alone
[2:13:39] I refuse to hear that angel
[2:13:42] when I refuse
[2:13:44] God showed me the other angels
[2:13:49] I'm gonna say it again when I refuse
[2:13:51] that angel
[2:13:53] God opened his eyes and showed him
[2:13:55] another ring

[2:14:02] I didn't know him but he came to our
[2:14:06] pastors

[2:14:39] call yeah

[2:16:44] chance Church

[2:16:53] Grace

[2:16:59] but through the plan of God
[2:17:02] all these attributes began to pour out
[2:17:05] of here
[2:17:07] what he said what's the purpose of us
[2:17:11] living in this evil age
[2:17:14] says this for one reason

[2:40:29] this morning
[2:40:32] amen we want to give you the report this
[2:40:34] morning for our Sunday School classes
[2:40:37] today's students were 34 students
[2:40:43] um of the 30 34 students
[2:40:49] um 14 of them were missing their Bibles
[2:40:53] so I guess maybe we weren't clear enough
[2:40:56] last week I think the number went even a
[2:40:59] little further down this week
[2:41:04] so if we can parents remember to give
[2:41:07] your children
[2:41:08] all the tools that they need foreign
[2:41:31] and so uh today's uh teachers were
[2:41:34] Sister Margaret
[2:41:46] and today we were in our verse Mark
[2:41:50] chapter three
[2:41:51] Marcos and uh it was when Jesus healed
[2:41:55] the men's with their hand right yes
[2:42:00] and that caused the War right
[2:42:04] right and then so brother Isaac went on
[2:42:08] to speak about how hermano is like they
[2:42:10] begin to blaspheme right
[2:42:14] following Jesus
[2:42:16] Jesus it was war war it was everything
[2:42:21] was timely this morning
[2:42:24] and so sister Margaret's topic was
[2:42:28] when he was calling his disciples
[2:42:32] it was uh and she took from John 13 35
[2:42:38] and by this shall all men know they are
[2:42:41] my disciples
[2:42:45] he'll know what side you were on
[2:42:48] right if you have loved one for the uh
[2:42:52] amen so today's offering was 78 dollars
[2:42:57] so if they would if they would cue me
