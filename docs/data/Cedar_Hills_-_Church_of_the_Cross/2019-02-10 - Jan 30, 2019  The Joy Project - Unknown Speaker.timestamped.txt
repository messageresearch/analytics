[18:54] the years of many generations ask thy
[18:58] father and he will show thee thy elders
[19:02] and they will tell thee and in Spanish a

[19:34] may be seated
[19:37] [Music]
[20:48] [Music]
[20:59] the first question is how did you come
[21:03] to know the Lord Jesus
[21:05] [Music]
[21:12] this is educators phone system is
[21:14] burning and detective Daniels
[21:16] okay because you know you know that
[21:26] message
[21:31] [Music]
[21:33] how did you come to know the Lord Jesus
[21:36] Oh actually I was raised in a religious
[21:40] home there Baptist I was raised Baptist
[21:43] I don't wanna make sure I'll take two
[21:48] I could take a long time but I
[22:21] the first question is how did you come
[22:26] to know the Lord Jesus
[22:27] [Music]
[22:39] okay because you know that message
[22:53] [Music]
[22:56] how did you come to know the Lord Jesus
[22:58] ugh actually uh I was raised in a
[23:02] religious home Baptist I was raised
[23:05] Baptist I don't wanna get on an
[23:09] extremity too low because I could take a
[23:12] long time like that but I couldn't the
[23:15] Lord Jesus says of my personal Savior
[23:18] there are eight years in the Baptist
[23:22] Church and at that time I was baptized
[23:26] in the name of the Father Son and Holy
[23:27] Ghost
[23:31] the key to every
[23:36] [Music]
[23:50] reach for that dimension me
[23:55] [Music]
[24:00] to lie
[24:02] for me to accept myself this Massoni
[24:09] [Music]
[24:12] No
[24:14] [Music]
[24:19] today's subject because it up we all go
[24:23] through complex and we see certain young
[24:25] people that have such a rapport result
[24:28] to us they're so tremendous under when I
[24:30] was an ignorant you know in the youth
[24:32] that course I was in a Baptist Church
[24:34] and there's certain people I would want
[24:38] to be like there but the reason that I
[24:41] wanted to be like dimness I had a
[24:46] complex about me so I was always trying
[24:51] to be like somebody else and I was never
[24:54] happy right now - Vanessa - the absolute
[24:58] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[25:01] [Music]
[25:09] rat's nest Nene has more patience on my
[25:14] gosh this first question is um how did
[25:29] you guys come to know the Lord Jesus and
[25:32] you know like your testimony look like
[25:34] what you're wearing Baptist I was
[25:36] baptized in November 1986 in this in
[25:42] [Music]
[25:55] that was I missing here that you
[25:57] received illegals
[25:58] I have met brother Tommy a year
[26:03] August abate admired and he's the one
[26:11] that made the message come alive for me
[26:13] and so we went to our city
[26:22] [Music]
[26:36] my dad got baptized in 86 so yeah when
[26:42] when I got baptized I just felt like I
[26:47] became a new person I believe that I
[26:49] receive my ghost
[26:53] [Music]
[27:02] [Applause]
[27:06] recognized
[27:07] [Music]
[27:15] your that is just my clothes reduce
[27:19] about away from
[27:29] to me was for the news a question right
[27:36] example
[27:40] if you had a better life
[27:42] [Music]
[28:10] well for me I was raised in a Christian
[28:14] home we went to all different kinds of
[28:18] churches but it was pretty wishy-washy
[28:21] one day they were out one day they were
[28:23] down and so I really didn't see anything
[28:29] in that for me so when I was able to
[28:31] move out of the house I left but when I
[28:35] found the message then I found something
[28:38] that was really real in it just it was
[28:41] like that deep calling to the deep and
[28:44] there isn't anything else and so there's
[28:48] nothing else to go back to and that's
[28:51] what keeps me going because I know that
[28:54] I'm where I'm supposed to be so when did
[28:57] you start like attending serials in
[29:03] [Music]
[29:10] what keeps you going
[29:11] [Music]
[29:13] now violates before I came out here
[29:17] [Music]
[29:21] the city for smell may be severe no
[29:25] question just popped up with my hands
[29:29] we were they'd been I guess my first
[29:33] bath
[29:34] [Music]
[29:42] well I consider myself a Baptist Franzi
[29:47] [Music]
[29:50] you know I had the question why are
[29:53] there so many different churches there's
[29:55] only one Bible why there's so many
[29:57] different churches and that didn't
[30:00] didn't say right with me as writer so do
[30:06] they not both the same thing that
[30:10] question but that statement when I read
[30:13] the maximum profit and I just to me just
[30:20] everything that he said in there by the
[30:23] Browns life
[30:25] [Music]
[30:32] [Music]
[30:43] [Music]
[30:50] [Music]
[31:00] how do you maintain your relationship
[31:04] with order like their brothers
[31:08] [Music]
[31:14] well fellowship is the best
[31:18] [Music]
[31:20] so we're lacking because we don't love
[31:26] our brothers and sisters it's just that
[31:28] it's hard first
[31:31] [Music]
[31:46] every day you get up and you go out
[31:49] there and face the world if you're not
[31:51] grounded then same just gonna swipe that
[31:55] away from you so you have to stay
[31:56] grounded in the word and you have to
[31:59] hear brothers voice it's what is the key
[32:24] to life so grandma grandpa the first
[32:39] question is
[32:41] how did you come in our Lord Jesus and
[32:43] what is you guys his testimony my
[32:47] testimony would be as after I grew up in
[32:51] it
[32:51] Baptist Church I got to know him then
[32:55] but I got to become acquainted and part
[32:59] of him when I met you your grandma and
[33:03] you and what date that was well not
[33:06] exact date but it was 1992 probably
[33:12] after about July August because we knew
[33:19] each other will fall before and then
[33:25] when did you start attending the
[33:28] services that exceeded those probably
[33:32] March March or April of 92 and at that
[33:39] same time did you meet another time you
[33:41] see me
[33:42] no I remember when the taught me and
[33:45] above 80 81 cuz I was delivering package
[33:51] to we lived in Santa Clara I see right
[33:57] you can already see how did you come to
[34:00] know Lord Jesus and or what is your
[34:02] testimony
[34:03] I came to him to the Mexico to stay with
[34:06] aunt Lana when I was 14 and I to church
[34:13] with them I went to resonate Castillo
[34:19] Sam can you go down every Sunday for
[34:23] that summer I was 14 so I would be happy
[34:34] to be at this number has a uncle and Dan
[34:37] your do this working and that was a
[34:46] young girl of course it didn't really
[34:49] quick but it never left me there you
[34:51] know the memories are still really good
[34:53] so that was personality and then but I
[34:58] was actually raised immature extent I
[35:00] knew the message but I didn't know that
[35:02] there was proper so I guess I learned
[35:06] about through the ground
[35:07] you gonna give vividly as a teenager or
[35:11] what that's a wife at those ears and
[35:13] learning about brother branham den then
[35:17] from their own
[35:21] to Lordsburg when my nephew was killed
[35:28] little Jeremy the villagers would and I
[35:32] came to the kingdom and that was when I
[35:35] first met brother Tommy and his ministry
[35:40] there the men that were with him in the
[35:41] ministry and that was my first
[35:44] impression of that God was more than
[35:52] just a story that because I could I felt
[35:56] when brother Tommy was when they were
[35:58] carrying though Jeremy's coffin brother
[36:01] tommy was in the front and the minister
[36:05] was behind them carrying the coffin and
[36:06] they were reciting that the Lord is my
[36:09] shepherd I shall not want
[36:10] and no and then that was a personal
[36:14] merit almost always and that was when I
[36:18] recognized
[36:20] [Music]
[36:21] multiples of bathing we just have a new
[36:24] awakening and I was that was in that was
[36:29] in the eighties like middle eighties or
[36:32] something like that maybe for the night
[36:33] maybe my babies but um anyone else
[36:36] another date on me and I left but I
[36:40] never it's like nothing ever worked
[36:42] after that things just like in touched
[36:45] fell apart
[36:46] I came back with my I didn't really come
[36:59] to church while standing you know and I
[37:01] try to try that and then I met grandpa
[37:04] in 92 and that's when we both started
[37:08] coming through record but it was five
[37:11] years before we were baptized either one
[37:13] of us were baptized on the back end so
[37:14] my thinking was saying good I've got
[37:16] five years thing that's bitter good 223
[37:19] songs
[37:19] uh-huh and so I think that was a 19
[37:23] [Music]
[37:25] ninety-eight that guess is when we got
[37:27] that place huh
[37:29] three plus five is eight seven nine ten
[37:31] nineteen eighties when we both have
[37:33] baptized I'm going on like right at 30
[37:37] years he's a new penis about 20 26 years
[37:41] me Georgie one pony soon that's
[37:44] awesome
[37:47] so we started going to Cedar Hills
[37:49] regular in 90 in muddy - yeah
[37:53] in March of 92 there you guys got
[37:55] baptized do you would you guys say that
[37:58] that's when you receive the Holy Ghost
[37:59] or when was that you receive
[38:02] I tell you what it was a darn good place
[38:06] to start because that was the cleanest
[38:07] feeling in the world wouldn't because
[38:12] that's us that's us everything really to
[38:14] get that prize but it's just like oh man
[38:17] there ain't no turning back here I mean
[38:18] you know it's it's like a public thing
[38:20] in it it's like you're required to that
[38:23] that's the way it was for me I I can't
[38:25] be friendly to me it was I I don't think
[38:28] that was it for me getting baptized to
[38:31] me was something I had to do not to get
[38:35] the Holy Ghost ranking if something I
[38:37] had to do I think I got it more meeting
[38:40] to Camp Thunderbird I actually
[38:43] surrendered myself
[38:47] I think that's when I came in the
[38:49] baptism like I said it was just you have
[38:53] to do it a little bit so then what would
[38:57] be two guys what would be the key of
[38:59] life the misconception about people and
[39:09] their relationships
[39:13] the red said you know marriage is a
[39:16] 50/50 proposition
[39:18] I absolutely disagree marriages are
[39:22] under feet and an opponent and if you're
[39:25] not willing to give that much and then
[39:28] we'll do it it's not a halfway thing
[39:31] you're going to go all the way was your
[39:33] question
[39:34] then the key tip would be to you like
[39:39] the key of life you will not this is one
[39:47] that is the key to life is knowing the
[39:52] life giver knowing here mommy like not
[39:57] being able to live without you no and
[39:59] the key of life is nurturing
[40:03] relationships you know fellowship and
[40:07] you know cuz not the other side act
[40:09] that's the only thing that acts is when
[40:11] we're with believers that are
[40:14] like-minded and do God's will I mean
[40:16] that's the key advice to me see blessing
[40:20] marriage that goes two ways that merge
[40:23] between husband and smiles and marriage
[40:26] between me and God
[40:30] and you've got the gold full built you
[40:32] can it's not a fifty-fifty day if life
[40:37] is taken care of you know others you cut
[40:42] stock takes care of you that way I mean
[40:45] you can't others and that's when you can
[40:48] feel the life flowing we go through
[40:51] still times you know but other than when
[40:53] you reach out and actually try to help
[40:55] other that's like it really is serving
[40:59] [Music]
[41:02] [Applause]
[41:08] that I you know said according to the
[41:11] message Church I started going in Bayard
[41:13] and that's were even even our church was
[41:16] going in Bayard at that time they were
[41:18] in Cuchillo and they go over there once
[41:20] or twice a week no once every two weeks
[41:22] they congregate there and I went for two
[41:26] years before brother was there but I go
[41:31] by myself and after two years here and
[41:35] enough here to start going with me you
[41:38] know but I was in the Apostolic Church
[41:40] and got out for different reasons then
[41:43] went into the message Church but brother
[41:47] Tommy and the church separated from
[41:49] their church and I didn't know the
[41:53] reason why I just I felt like I was by
[41:56] myself because I wasn't married and they
[41:58] get left so finally they started having
[42:01] services in homes they started having
[42:04] prayer meetings in homes and I would ask
[42:09] him when are you guys having a prayer
[42:11] meeting at a house and he said I can't
[42:12] tell you he says you're going to church
[42:15] over there and I'm not going to
[42:16] moonlight or whatever you know
[42:18] we're going but anyhow I kept testing
[42:22] some of our sisters and they would tell
[42:24] me so I'd show up at the prayer meetings
[42:26] and but after two years then brother
[42:30] Russ I'll let him tell his side how he
[42:34] came in you know but I saw I've been in
[42:38] the message it doesn't really a lot of
[42:40] times you think well you've been in the
[42:42] message for 38 years but has iMessage
[42:45] been in you uh-huh you know what I'm
[42:46] saying so so I'll let him tell his site
[42:50] for him he came into the message a very
[42:53] good doctor yeah like you said I came in
[42:57] tears
[42:58] you'd get done two years longer than me
[43:00] I came in two years after you and we
[43:04] were going to bear
[43:07] by every switch
[43:10] was a shortcut remember yeah but tell
[43:13] her how you came in we went to a prayer
[43:17] meeting into your scene mm-hmm to us

[43:25] the line Laden truth booth did I
[43:33] to the prayer meeting and tear fee

[43:40] [Applause]
[43:43] prophecy there
[43:45] [Music]
[43:49] and about that
[43:54] and anyway when we went over there I
[43:57] didn't want to be a hypocrite so I was
[44:00] so smoking
[44:04] directed smoke on the way over there
[44:07] after that pervy the Lord gets all that
[44:11] away from me
[44:12] [Music]
[44:17] I guess
[44:20] the rest you know it's just I continued
[44:23] going to church well we had to go and
[44:27] make things right you know yeah we had
[44:29] to come out of a bear church in the
[44:31] right way brother Tommy told us so we
[44:33] had to go and talk with brother or Nick
[44:34] and we told him that we were going to
[44:36] move to sort every nickel with brother
[44:41] yeah proselyte what we're gonna do
[44:47] change churches would have to do it the
[44:49] right way yes so we did we had a meeting
[44:54] with him and he has but why do you want
[44:57] to go he says I mean I love you guys
[44:58] very much and have I done anything wrong
[45:00] and we said no you just feel like we
[45:02] belong over there and and he started
[45:04] crying and we cried and at least when we
[45:07] left we were in good terms you know and
[45:10] friends and also we did it the right way
[45:13] and so from there nuns which was in
[45:16] nineteen that's he's 71 that's when you
[45:20] know we started going we started of
[45:22] course so tabernacle and then when I
[45:24] need to sit her heels Tabernacle and
[45:27] we've been used to look at you being
[45:31] faithful you know since then with and
[45:34] then of course how do I admit brother
[45:37] Tommy well it's my brother's opinion
[45:40] Rosie nap him and I were you know there
[45:43] was always a family at 13 there was
[45:46] always two and growing up it was him and
[45:49] I that wasn't the closest and then I'll
[45:52] let brother us say his testimony as to
[45:54] how he met brother Tommy
[46:01] we joined the Navy at the same time and
[46:04] I was from mom
[46:06] I left over close to Hobbs New Mexico
[46:11] and then of course he was from Hanover
[46:13] and they took all everyone from you
[46:17] Mexico and and took them to Albuquerque
[46:20] to be sworn in and that's where I bet
[46:26] Tommy I think he was 18 at the hour 17
[46:33] and then and we went to boot camp
[46:36] together and I got out of boot camp we
[46:41] we were stationed aboard to st.
[46:43] [Music]
[46:49] life together see but the funny part
[46:52] about this if you want to call it funny
[46:55] I mean my brother Branham says nothing
[46:58] is a coincidence yes both of them
[47:01] [Music]
[47:03] that's what am I trying to say that test
[47:05] both a and flunked the test in
[47:07] Albuquerque right yeah baby no they
[47:11] didn't know each other and he they both
[47:14] liked it so they had to go and we do it
[47:17] and that's how they got their past
[47:20] yeah yeah yeah yeah and then you know of
[47:28] course you know they were in the same
[47:29] ship they slipped across from each other
[47:31] so you know brother Ross and brother
[47:36] Tommy were you know there for four years
[47:40] heeey
[47:43] when I when I first met brother last
[47:45] night she was just like you know just my
[47:48] brother's friend but never anything any
[47:50] feelings nothing in our
[47:54] [Music]
[47:55] my brother Tommy were telling ya I guess
[47:58] he asked and you take the poverty sister
[48:00] you said there's no way no way I say
[48:03] there's going to open my sister you know
[48:05] you're not good enough but you know it
[48:09] it came to the point that dance I think
[48:13] they had what six months left yeah
[48:16] and he took me to a wedding of a friend
[48:21] of mine my sister asked him that I need
[48:23] told him I needed a day and that was
[48:26] that wasn't so I mean I he didn't want
[48:30] it not something that I was like boy shy
[48:36] yeah but that was behind my back
[48:39] anything about it so anyhow from that
[48:46] day on it took six months we've got
[48:48] engaged after two months without engaged
[48:50] and then four months later were they
[48:52] have just we were going to elope but
[48:55] they said nope say my sister made my
[48:57] dress and they all helped us then in six
[49:00] months were married and in for a week or
[49:03] so we're going to be celebrating
[49:06] Leticia
[49:12] so that's how you guys met them yeah
[49:16] just just so what you wanna wear though
[49:21] so yes my next question would be how do
[49:27] you maintain your relationship with the
[49:28] Lord and with your brothers and sisters
[49:31] in Christ well for me that thing to do
[49:37] is that
[49:41] help your brothers and sisters sometimes
[49:44] they you know if there's problems and
[49:45] they come to you you listen and you try
[49:48] and help them the best way you can you
[49:50] know and counseling for from what we've
[49:52] been through and we just were honest
[49:58] with each other we don't hide nothing
[50:00] from each other we're very open and like
[50:05] I say after 56 years do you think that
[50:08] Roma we're getting old I mean I told him
[50:10] one time I'm getting old and fat and he
[50:12] says to me and not you're just as
[50:14] beautiful as the day I married you and
[50:15] and I told him you're the same way it
[50:18] says I never favorite that I was gonna
[50:20] marry your father because he looks that
[50:22] spitting image of his dad you know and
[50:24] but anyhow our life our love grows
[50:28] deeper and stronger being there worrying
[50:30] the Lord you know instead of being last
[50:33] night it's just more and more
[50:36] and with our brothers and sisters you
[50:38] know we're just there for them and then
[50:44] [Music]
[50:47] the key of life
[50:49] sir the Lord with all my heart and
[50:53] heart and soul and I just love him and
[50:55] just pray you know never forget to pray
[50:58] and never forget to read whether the I'm
[51:00] not much for the Bible I mean maybe I
[51:03] worded it wrong then when I read the
[51:05] Bible I I don't understand sometimes so
[51:09] I rather listen to a message you know
[51:12] because if I read the Bible and then
[51:14] there's things that don't make sense
[51:17] oh yeah I mean it's just so loud until I
[51:19] if I'd read something I don't understand
[51:21] it then I gotta go with brother lon and
[51:25] then daddy and my brother cuz he'll come
[51:27] anytime I call him he'll come and
[51:29] explain you know but just stay in the
[51:35] word he stay in the Ark and just go
[51:37] straight down the middle door
[51:39] the other side you know
[51:42] I always put God first
[51:46] you have hard times
[51:49] knowing that God's servant make
[51:51] something
[51:54] you know cuz if it wasn't for that one
[51:56] of our biggest trial that we had a
[51:59] friend who lost her grandson's life at
[52:02] the age of 19 you know that was one of
[52:04] the hardest things ever and
[52:08] they my daughter still can't get
[52:10] in this like I told her you won't see
[52:13] him again detector you know and I know
[52:15] that God took him up with us scene to
[52:17] save a soul and that's what keeps us
[52:20] going
[52:23] [Music]
[52:31] [Music]
[52:34] okay so how did you come to know the
[52:37] Lord Jesus what is your testimony okay
[52:40] I think I've always known it because I
[52:42] was always in church all the time but I
[52:45] grew up as a Catholic first and then
[52:47] from there I went to another Christian
[52:50] charity me was wrong about ourselves and
[52:52] I just felt that I've always known him
[52:54] but I never knew I could have a personal
[52:57] relationship with him so that makes a
[52:58] big difference and once I went into the
[53:01] potter's house I thought I had that
[53:03] personal relationship
[53:06] it's just that it was in my place so I
[53:08] strongly come to
[53:10] with brother Caleb and that's why I am
[53:12] [Music]
[53:16] this is how did you come to know Jesus
[53:19] what's what's your testimony I well I
[53:26] got it but when she got into but before
[53:29] that they were still my sister wasn't it
[53:32] she's the one that really started first
[53:38] one by one we can follow it to observe
[53:43] them
[53:52] [Music]
[53:57] - in general what's what's the key to
[54:00] life and then we can even throw in
[54:04] [Music]
[54:05] maybe his hoes can answer that first
[54:08] what keeps you keeps you going moving
[54:12] forward
[54:12] subscribing
[54:13] [Music]
[54:18] what keeps me going is that I know that
[54:21] there's some chill garden and maybe God
[54:23] not in this well I really do
[54:28] he's oops
[54:30] it's true
[54:35] [Music]
[54:58] further IRA opted out of doing interview
[55:01] via phone call however he did give me a
[55:03] list of all the answers to the questions
[55:04] that we had for beginning with how
[55:09] the simple answer was by hearing
[55:11] answered when he was baptized was on
[55:13] March of 1982 and he accepted the
[55:16] message in 1989 when he first began to
[55:19] know brother
[55:20] Tomas better senior was in 1975 and what
[55:23] keeps him going is the message of faith
[55:25] in God he maintains a relationship with
[55:27] God by reading his Bible hearing the
[55:29] message to pray the key to life to him
[55:32] his love and
[55:34] and the source of his success is knowing
[55:36] that he is never alone his favorite song
[55:38] is beautiful star Bethlehem that super
[55:40] message where brother branham is the
[55:41] invisible union of the Bride of Christ
[55:44] his favorite color is blue his favorite
[55:46] food is steak and his advice to being a
[55:50] parent or grandparent is to show love to
[55:52] one another
[55:56] so auntie um could you tell us how you
[56:00] came to know the Lord my parents was
[56:27] very special the natural detergency the
[56:30] pastor's wife and the lanes they're
[56:32] innocent Jean they've got something I
[56:34] want so that was beginning of my
[56:36] conversion there and when were you
[56:39] baptized empty I was baptized in
[56:43] February of nineteen sixty one mom who
[56:47] left my brother mine was pastoring and
[56:54] he baptized so what would you say that
[56:59] the key to life is for you like what
[57:02] keeps you going what keeps me going is
[57:07] that I know that my redeemer the
[57:14] redeemer lives and someday I will be
[57:17] holding a face-to-face and I will
[57:21] see my loved ones that had crossed the
[57:23] Jordan River in our overrun okay
[57:35] so Heidi attends you also known as Nana
[57:39] I'll ask you a few questions today and
[57:43] just answer it however you want to so
[57:46] when did you meet my pastor Caleb Caleb
[57:51] 20 years
[57:55] [Music]
[57:57] their aim is to take you out Junior
[58:01] [Music]
[58:03] and I used to drive my mom
[58:07] that's really when I first got to them
[58:10] more
[58:14] first started going out to church at the
[58:18] rest the church was still around Valley
[58:21] nobody Church and I didn't I didn't
[58:27] really do close together Intel when I
[58:32] moved on you
[58:33] when I started me about how you had a
[58:37] blood disorder and how you were healed
[58:39] so can you tell us the story about that
[58:43] and when it started sure it was it just
[58:47] came on suddenly
[58:51] about 18 years ago
[58:54] [Music]
[58:57] eighteen years ago I had gone on a March
[59:00] of Dimes walk you know I got a that
[59:03] evening and didn't really feel good and
[59:06] then the other night I was started
[59:09] throwing up blood and I I couldn't lift
[59:13] my arms I was really sick and ended up
[59:18] the emergency room
[59:20] [Music]
[59:22] I had no platelets there's nothing
[59:26] bleeding out I started getting
[59:31] artificial platelets I was in the
[59:33] intensive care I was really sick and
[59:35] they didn't know what was wrong with me
[59:37] and finally the hematologist that was
[59:42] there instead that I had a blood
[59:44] disorder
[59:45] it's called ITP so then we did some
[59:48] research and come to find out this blood
[59:51] disease residence and my family but it's
[59:53] always been on in the girls not on the
[59:56] boys
[59:57] so I did pretty good and then about six
[59:59] months later just out of the blue this
[1:00:01] came back again and what happens is it's
[1:00:05] like you have leukemia you just start
[1:00:07] bruising everywhere
[1:00:09] it put a blood pressure cuff on your
[1:00:12] lower arm turns black it was awful and
[1:00:16] so I was really sick and I took care of
[1:00:23] you know I really I really need for it
[1:00:26] to be prayed for because they said
[1:00:28] there's no cure for this and I don't
[1:00:33] care
[1:00:35] it
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:38] of course at that time I was not in
[1:00:41] message I've always been a always been a
[1:00:45] believer but I do not come to message
[1:00:48] too recently Caleb left and I went in
[1:00:51] the bedroom and I was laying there and I
[1:00:54] looked up and I said Cameron you know
[1:00:57] come here you have to see this and Camp
[1:01:00] King running into the bedroom and there
[1:01:02] was a white light in an arch that were
[1:01:06] and I am NOT in success so I was healed
[1:01:10] and was healed in that in that time what
[1:01:15] that's pretty neat
[1:01:16] yeah that's nice that was a real turning
[1:01:19] point that was for me and I think it was
[1:01:23] was a phenomenal you know all right well
[1:01:28] I like what faith is is the most
[1:01:32] important thing
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:44] you know
[1:01:48] [Music]
[1:01:57] Walter's for measuring away I
[1:02:01] not message very long but I really
[1:02:05] believe that my faith in Him led me to
[1:02:09] the message into the church and to this
[1:02:13] place with all the brothers and sisters
[1:02:15] that help here
