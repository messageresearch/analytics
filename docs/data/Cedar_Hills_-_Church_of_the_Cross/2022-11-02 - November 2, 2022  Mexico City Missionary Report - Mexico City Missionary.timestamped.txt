[18:08] um let us turn to the scripture
[18:11] Mark 11 12 I mean uh 24. Marcos
[18:18] therefore I say unto you what things so
[18:21] ever ye desire when ye pray believe that
[18:24] you receive them and ye shall have them
[18:35] uh you may be seated
[18:39] first I want to thank the Lord for
[18:40] giving me the opportunity of going on
[18:43] this trip foreign
[19:06] but I prayed and the Lord made a way for
[19:08] me to make a friend amigo
[19:15] he knew Spanish in English
[19:19] so he helped me with things
[19:25] I was able to do everything and have a
[19:28] good time
[19:32] God is so good and he hears us when we
[19:35] pray
[19:38] God bless you
[19:40] [Applause]
[19:54] thank you
[20:00] foreign
[20:05] [Music]
[20:16] I guess one of the main things
[20:19] principales that uh really impacted me
[20:23] on this trip gave me impact
[20:25] was really the reason I went to go
[20:28] foreign
[20:33] I don't know if all of you know but some
[20:35] of you may know I tore my ACL like three
[20:38] weeks before the trip no says
[20:45] and
[20:47] um my surgery could be scheduled for
[20:49] October 24th which would make it
[21:00] and it would basically make me miss my
[21:02] entire trip
[21:06] so I
[21:08] am very stingy because
[21:12] and I was like
[21:14] I don't know maybe I should maybe I
[21:17] shouldn't I don't know
[21:21] but
[21:22] um I don't know I just had this really
[21:24] like tug on my heart to go
[21:29] so I talked to my pastor Uncle Caleb of
[21:33] lake
[21:35] and he kind of he gave me an answer
[21:38] without giving me an answer
[21:42] and we talked it through a little bit
[21:45] and at the end of the day he kind of
[21:48] just you know LED it up to me for me to
[21:51] decide
[21:54] so I I went on the trip
[21:58] and it was it was
[22:01] um it was a really good experience
[22:06] um I throughout the entire Camp I mean
[22:08] they were just amazing people
[22:14] and I think
[22:17] one of the things to me was that it hit
[22:20] more close to home than I thought it was
[22:22] going to
[22:22] um because
[22:28] I thought I was gonna make I guess
[22:31] friendships with other people
[22:36] but really I made just deeper
[22:40] friendships with the people that I went
[22:42] with
[22:48] it was me brother Noah Isaiah and yeah
[22:55] us for a loan in the camp when we knew
[22:59] nothing about anyone else
[23:05] so we kind of used that and we bonded a
[23:09] lot closer than we ever have
[23:13] same with you know the other people who
[23:17] went brother Robert I didn't know he
[23:19] speak Spanish that was very interesting
[23:26] same with um
[23:28] and sister Debbie that was very nice
[23:34] to be able to get to know them a lot
[23:36] better and they were like my second
[23:38] parents
[23:42] but just uh being able to bond with the
[23:45] youth was honestly one of the best
[23:47] things ever
[23:53] and that's all I got God bless you yes
[23:57] [Applause]
[24:10] man God bless you all this evening
[24:13] let us stand and we're gonna read a
[24:16] scripture
[24:18] first Peter 2 9.
[24:23] but ye our chosen generation a royal

[24:52] foreign
[24:56] this this scripture here was the the
[25:00] scripture for the camp yes

[26:29] to be able to meet brother Paco and his
[26:32] wife
[26:35] I got to play the piano while brother

[31:48] permitting me to go
[31:50] you know speak right now at this moment
[31:57] I've been wanting to go to Mexico City
[32:00] since I was abroad 16 or 17 years old
[32:09] and uh that finally happened in God's
[32:11] time
[32:14] for those who win s
[32:19] take five minutes
[32:21] so I like to read the scripture
[32:24] I'm a borrower from Brother Ethan
[32:26] um
[32:31] first Peter
[32:34] foreign
[32:37] generation a royal priesthood
[32:40] holy nation and peculiar people people
[32:43] should shoot forth Praises of him who
[32:46] have called you out of Darkness Into His
[32:49] Marvelous Light

[33:36] 515 I mean people in the greater Mexico
[33:39] City area
[33:46] [Music]
[33:48] and I rounded that up to about 150 youth
[33:52] being there in the camp yeah yeah
[33:57] and that is about point zero zero six
[34:01] eight nine percent is
[34:05] talk about being called The Peculiar
[34:08] people all right
[34:19] getting to know brother will sister Deb
[34:22] yeah
[34:23] um
[34:30] brother Enzo or Lynch says Lynch so I
[34:36] was blessed and I'm moving to see you
[34:40] I can't explain to you you know how
[34:42] blessed I was to be able to interpret no
[34:45] whether it's because
[34:49] it had been 30 years
[34:56] it means a lot is
[35:00] so if I have anything to say to you
[35:05] I was 20 years old
[35:21] when I went through a difficult trauma
[35:22] in my life
[35:32] and I always try to fix it on my ownismo
[35:38] foreign
[36:04] don't ever
[36:07] try to fix them on your own
[36:10] persimismo run to your pastor
[36:13] run to the ministers
[36:15] run to your family
[36:24] don't wake up 30 years later no the
[36:27] spirited
[36:34] doing what you need to do I gotta look
[36:36] at things
[36:38] because God's gonna bring your fear your
[36:39] son the daughter of God
[36:41] will bring you when you're a son or
[36:44] daughter of God so
[36:49] take the better way take the good way
[36:53] take the life don't feel you need to
[36:55] carry the Burger on your own
[36:58] it's not yours to carry noise
[37:02] so God bless each and every one of you
[37:05] it was wonderful to spend that time with
[37:07] you
[37:08] listen to me you yes
[37:11] they say wisdom is an accumulation of
[37:14] Errors
[37:17] I think it's wiser to learn from errors
[37:21] of others
[37:23] if you could take something away
[37:29] don't wake up 30 years later
[37:34] it has been a difficult world but I
[37:36] thank God for it
[37:39] because you have the confidence that one
[37:42] day I'd be able to carry it off
[37:47] and I'm grateful for that and it was a
[37:50] privilege to meet our brothers and
[37:51] sisters in Mexico City they're awesome
[38:00] I know
[38:02] God permits it won't be my last time
[38:04] going
[38:07] I love each and every one of you
[38:10] always turn to God for everything
[38:15] you're not alone
[38:17] foreign
[38:33] [Applause]
[38:50] what a privilege it was to go to Mexico
[38:53] City
[38:55] Mexico I got I gotta say it again what a
[38:58] privilege it was to go to Mexico City
[39:00] Village
[39:02] because I got to follow the path foreign
[39:06] and
[39:30] I just kept thinking what a privilege it
[39:33] was
[39:35] that God in my time
[39:39] would choose me
[39:42] we hear this a lot
[39:45] but for this trip
[39:48] it impacted me in such a way
[39:52] that I realized
[39:55] what other thing what other great thing
[39:58] in this world do I have that I have to
[40:00] do
[40:03] many times we get caught up or I get
[40:06] caught up in the daily life
[40:12] things that I need to accomplish in my
[40:14] life
[40:16] take care taking care of my family and
[40:19] such things
[40:22] but nothing's greater than to serve
[40:25] God's people
[40:28] no nothing's greater than is to serve
[40:32] you notice
[40:35] to serve your young people
[40:39] each and every one of you are very
[40:41] special in my life
[40:46] I try to balance the work
[40:49] and Family Church in my life
[40:53] I have done that all wrong
[40:57] because all I have to do
[41:00] is place the Lord Jesus as number one in
[41:03] my life
[41:05] you gotta replace the Lord Jesus is
[41:08] number one in your life
[41:11] and everything balances out
[41:15] but we get ourselves into trouble when
[41:18] we try to balance it for him
[41:24] but I would like to read a scripture and
[41:27] and that is found in the Book of
[41:28] Revelation
[41:29] apocalypsies
[41:34] 15 3 and 4.
[41:38] and the Bible says and they sing the
[41:41] song of Moses the servant of God
[41:47] and a song of the lamb saying
[41:52] great and marvelous are thy Works
[41:56] Lord God Almighty
[41:59] just and true are thy ways
[42:03] now king of saints Frey de los Santos
[42:06] the theme of this Camp is
[42:09] we are called to be different
[42:14] we are called to be different
[42:17] when I found out the theme this is the
[42:20] the phrase that kept repeating in my
[42:22] mind
[42:26] a declaration to my members
[42:29] a declaration to my problems
[42:33] that I am called to be different
[42:36] that the youth are called to be
[42:38] different
[42:39] people are called to be different
[42:45] we had a good time in the Lord indeed
[42:49] I come back with a good report
[42:53] and a witness
[42:56] I come back with other witnesses that
[42:59] the Lord is still calling
[43:01] calling his children
[43:03] and you can see the impact
[43:06] of the Holy Spirit there with the young
[43:09] people
[43:11] I was just so happy to be a part of it
[43:14] is
[43:16] so happy that I was given the confidence
[43:19] and the opportunity
[43:22] to be able to go on this trip
[43:25] I I believe it impacted Me Maybe maybe
[43:28] more than than them
[43:33] because we were called to be different
[43:37] what a privilege to be called The Chosen
[43:40] generation
[43:42] the royal priesthood who else in the
[43:45] world can say that
[43:48] a revelation not just to read it and say
[43:53] that's a nice scripture
[43:55] take that that inside their heart
[43:59] to know that God has called us
[44:03] we are privileged
[44:05] we were the most important people on
[44:08] this Earth
[44:11] what a good report that
[44:17] I believe it's about five right brother
[44:20] a handful of young people decided to
[44:23] give their hearts to the Lord
[44:28] you know if it was for the five
[44:31] well done
[44:37] they'll get old
[44:39] is
[44:41] it doesn't it Thrills you you're going I
[44:46] can see why our pastor is missionary
[44:48] minded
[44:50] God is still working
[44:53] and he's using us
[44:55] we should be over joyous
[44:58] and I'm so happy to be a part of it is
[45:05] I I was able to hear the testimonies of
[45:07] the youth on the Friday
[45:10] nights
[45:12] and the things that they struggle with
[45:17] and see where they're at now
[45:21] I was happy to be a part of it
[45:24] today you see that they that we could
[45:27] encourage them
[45:32] and that God gave me the strength to
[45:34] encourage them
[45:37] his bottom line is Ultimo
[45:42] Lemma I've had a lot of encouragement yo
[45:46] but I mean every Sunday
[45:50] you've had a lot of encouragement every
[45:53] Sunday uh Domingo every Wednesday
[45:56] by the ministry
[45:59] Pastor what encouragement
[46:03] and I just want to tell you let's get on

[46:25] [Applause]
[46:52] this this evening
[46:55] they're wonderful to hear all the
[46:57] reports
[47:00] and to to see what God is he's still
[47:04] doing
[47:06] in our generation
[47:09] you know what uh
[47:11] uh if we can just turn to uh to our
[47:15] scripture
[47:19] and that was in second Peter yeah excuse
[47:21] me first Peter Primera de Pedro to to uh
[47:25] 210 yes
[47:29] uh verse nine was was read
[47:33] and uh but verse 10 it says which in
[47:37] time past were not a people
[47:43] but are now
[47:45] the people of God
[47:49] which had not obtained Mercy foreign
[48:14] that was that went on this trip foreign
[48:39] sometimes we're
[48:44] sometimes we think uh we're we're a
[48:46] little crazy
[48:50] but uh it was funny when the when the
[48:54] camp started
[48:58] the youth were kind of uh there was
[49:01] there was uh there was about 140 some
[49:05] youth there have you had approximately
[49:08] and as things are kind of everybody's
[49:11] trying to get to know each other a
[49:12] little bit
[49:15] [Music]
[49:16] a little timid um
[49:19] and then uh once the game started going
[49:23] a little bit
[49:26] you know people be like Yay
[49:32] but uh but our group just got right in
[49:35] it
[49:36] they were they were they were chest
[49:39] bumping it says
[49:41] it was going crazy
[49:44] and they were just just screaming
[49:47] yelling
[49:48] and and it and what it did was it made
[49:52] everybody kind of loosen up a little bit
[49:57] and all the other youth were like wow I
[49:59] guess we could do that too
[50:03] so it kind of started a good chain
[50:06] reaction
[50:09] and after that all the all whatever
[50:12] chains they had on them
[50:16] whatever shyness was it was thrown out
[50:19] the windows
[50:23] oh and everybody just had a marvelous
[50:25] marvelous time to
[50:29] when we when we got there on when we got
[50:32] there to the camp on uh on Friday
[50:34] morning
[50:37] you know sometimes we think well we we
[50:40] came from Far uh this is
[50:51] well you know we came from America
[50:57] you know and we got there about 11 30 in
[51:00] the morning
[51:03] there had been uh there had been youth
[51:06] from Saltillo
[51:09] that had traveled all night
[51:13] 12 hours and got there at eight o'clock
[51:16] in the morning
[51:18] we're waiting all day
[51:21] until I think we got into the camp about
[51:23] 12 30 or so
[51:26] media but when people are in expectation
[51:30] of that is
[51:33] you can travel all that time
[51:39] you know we're we're going to have a
[51:41] good time
[51:46] bring greetings from but from Brother
[51:48] Paco yeah
[51:52] he's the pastor there at Virginia
[51:55] is
[52:00] from him and his and his wife sister
[52:02] Olga uh saludos
[52:06] and they just wanted me to tell you that
[52:09] they they love you very very much
[52:13] and I uh I'm thankful for for the uh all
[52:18] the brothers and sisters that that went
[52:22] that gave their time and efforts Italian
[52:27] you see through all I think brother
[52:30] Robert said there was there was 20 some
[52:32] million people there in the greater
[52:34] Mexico City
[52:39] but when you see all that all that's
[52:41] happening
[52:43] and how how this generation is just uh
[52:47] it's just so perverted
[52:53] it's it's so crazy
[52:56] but when you see a group of young people
[52:59] that
[53:02] that are going there for a specific
[53:04] purpose
[53:08] that purpose is to draw closer to God
[53:10] yes a proposito is
[53:13] you see the lives that are changing
[53:16] right in front of you
[53:20] and afterwards on Sundays you see five
[53:23] people five brothers and sisters that
[53:25] have raised their hand in is
[53:31] and say yes I I am different
[53:36] I'm different for a reason
[53:39] I'm different because of what happened
[53:42] on Calvary difference
[53:45] that is why we're different
[53:49] accepted
[53:51] that great sacrifice
[53:54] you see five young people give their
[53:56] hearts to the Lord in such a time as
[53:58] this is
[53:59] [Music]
[54:02] then you understand
[54:04] why our pastor sent us
[54:07] it wasn't because of us
[54:10] but I'm glad and I'm thankful for the
[54:13] story content we can be a part of that
[54:17] and I'm so glad as well
[54:20] as you saw my three boys
[54:23] Muchachos coming up here
