[18:31] man God bless you
[18:34] I just want to give thanks to the Lord
[18:37] um
[18:40] in June I had some blood work done
[18:45] and the doctor called me about a week
[18:48] later saying
[18:51] that I need to to go in and see her
[18:54] because it had come back abnormal
[18:56] normal
[19:00] so when I went to see her she said that
[19:04] um
[19:04] my liver levels were very high
[19:08] regreso medication
[19:13] so she wanted to do an ultrasound
[19:18] I said okay I kind of put it off for
[19:22] eign
[19:30] I guess
[19:32] um last month my aunt passed away from
[19:35] she had liver cancer
[19:42] so I thought oh maybe it runs in the
[19:44] family so maybe I should get it checked
[19:46] so you stop and send it
[19:51] so I made an appointment for the
[19:53] ultrasound and I had it done
[19:55] foreign
[20:07] had my follow-up with the doctor
[20:09] yesterday
[20:14] and after last Wednesday's prayer
[20:17] meeting I told myself and I pray I was
[20:20] praying and
[20:22] brother Diego said you know people
[20:25] having problems in their stomach
[20:27] problems
[20:31] I said it wasn't my stomach but it's in
[20:34] the area I guess
[20:39] so when I went to the doctor on Monday
[20:44] she says I don't know what you've been
[20:46] doing these past three months
[20:51] but your levels are back to normalize
[21:00] she did say that I guess there's
[21:03] different levels in your liver but okay
[21:09] one of them was slightly elevated but
[21:12] she wasn't concerned
[21:18] so she said it had dropped like 60
[21:20] points so she was it was okay
[21:26] she would still keep an eye on it
[21:31] So to that for that I want to give all
[21:33] the honor and glory to our Lord foreign

[29:14] thank you
[29:16] congratulations
[29:19] I'm sorry I'm gonna go in Spanish
[29:27] [Music]
[29:46] and we'll go to some scriptures we'll
[29:49] begin with Daniel 9 24.
[29:55] radios settings
[30:15] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[30:17] and upon thy Holy City to finish the
[30:19] transgression and to make an end of sins
[30:21] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[30:24] and to bring in Everlasting
[30:26] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[30:28] and prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[30:34] now we'll go to Revelation chapter 6
[30:37] verse 12.
[30:44] everyday
[30:57] and I beheld when he had opened the
[30:58] Sixth Seal and low there was a great
[31:00] earthquake and the sun became black a
[31:03] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[31:05] blood
[31:09] and lastly Daniel chapter 12 and verse
[31:12] 1.
[31:15] very well known by by everyone
[31:18] Miguel
[31:21] is
[31:42] stand up the great Prince which
[31:44] standards for the children of thy people
[31:46] and there shall be a time of trouble
[31:48] such as never was since there was a
[31:50] nation even to that time and at that
[31:52] time the people shall be delivered
[31:54] everyone that shall be found written in
[31:56] the book
[32:00] so we see the how delicate this topic is
[32:06] we see that Joe Joe prophesied it
[32:10] we also see Daniel here speaking about
[32:13] it
[32:17] and Jesus also made reference in Matthew
[32:19] which we will see later
[32:22] foreign
[32:52] does anyone know what the name Jacob
[32:54] means
[32:57] a planter thank you brother deceiver is
[33:02] someone taking the place of someone else
[33:05] illegally
[33:07] or a deceiver
[33:10] now how how was Jacob
[33:18] says Jacob was a very Shameless young
[33:20] man uh very close to the or holding on
[33:23] to the apron of his his mother
[33:27] he was a storytelling specified boy
[33:38] to his mom and we know some of them
[33:51] and as the Bible says he would spend his
[33:53] time with his mother
[33:56] and
[33:58] with those highs and lows that he had in
[34:01] in his life
[34:03] he had something that was important
[34:08] which was the respect to his Birthright
[34:14] that made all of the difference
[34:18] is
[34:23] we see he was escaping from his
[34:26] father-in-law labor
[34:28] Ator
[34:31] and from the other side his brother was
[34:33] also seeking him
[34:40] and he said I deceived him and well
[34:43] perhaps he's coming to kill me
[34:47] and in that time is where he finds
[34:50] himself with the Lord
[34:52] where he finds himself trapped
[34:55] where he has no way out
[35:02] and well the name has a lot to do with
[35:04] this
[35:06] as long as his name was Jacob plantador
[35:10] he was a supplanter
[35:12] a deceiver
[35:16] but when he wrestled with the Lord all
[35:19] night long
[35:22] the Lord changed his name from Jacob to
[35:25] Israel
[35:27] Israel and who knows the the meaning of
[35:30] of the name Israel that if anybody knows
[35:39] I heard someone say it means uh Prince
[35:42] of the Lord yes that's what he was
[35:49] Jacob told the Lord
[35:51] I will not leave you
[35:54] you cannot go
[35:56] continue I will stay here with you
[36:00] I want things to change right here
[36:06] if that could be our attitude towards
[36:08] God okay
[36:15] that's where God can respond when we're
[36:17] in that decisive moment in our life
[36:23] them
[36:24] no button
[36:27] s
[36:33] is 144
[36:41] 000 these managers of of the money
[36:45] things of the same style
[36:49] when they see the truth
[36:54] to what they can hold on to is
[36:58] President says there's Moses and Elijah
[37:01] I mean
[37:02] amen they will wrestle with God
[37:09] into 144 000 of the tribes of Israel
[37:12] will be called right there
[37:14] brother Brown says in the six seals
[37:21] and now here is these two prophets
[37:23] standing here with the word of God
[37:28] so that they can do anything to Nature
[37:30] that they want to yes
[37:32] and they can shake the Earth
[37:36] and it shows exactly who does it
[37:39] it's Moses and Elijah
[37:42] personification
[37:44] because there is their ministry
[37:46] re-impersonated again
[37:49] it's both men
[37:52] oh my do you see it now
[37:56] the congregation
[37:59] it's those Prophets
[38:24] they preach like John the Baptist
[38:55] amen so now we find out that Jacob's
[38:58] trouble
[39:00] is the Great Tribulation yes
[39:04] now this subject
[39:06] and I gotta say you know to all the the
[39:10] brothers
[39:12] all the Ministers of the platforms
[39:17] let's give them a round of applause
[39:24] amen amen and the reason why is because
[39:27] these all the subjects
[39:31] they require a lot of time and
[39:33] dedication
[39:36] and they do that for free yeah
[39:39] for your benefits
[39:42] taking time out of their their schedules
[39:46] and it's for our benefit yes
[39:49] so you know a great end of applaud to
[39:52] each Minister and each
[39:55] Persona and so we find out that we just
[39:57] read in in Daniel 12
[40:00] and instead and at that time Michael
[40:03] shall stand up
[40:05] the great Prince was standard for the
[40:07] children of thy people
[40:10] and there shall be a time of trouble
[40:14] such as never was since there was
[40:17] Nations
[40:20] even to that time
[40:23] and at that time thy people shall be
[40:26] delivered
[40:29] So it's talking about the Great
[40:31] Tribulation there yeah
[40:34] and that's a time that this world has
[40:36] never never seen yes
[40:40] so this subject right here is
[40:43] going to be gruesome it was
[40:47] warn you ahead of time
[40:50] there's no church in this one up yeah
[40:56] you can't you can't flower it up
[41:00] no you can take a pig
[41:03] he's filthy he's filthy by Nature
[41:07] I mean I don't know how many have ever
[41:09] been around pigs
[41:11] and they stink all right they're filthy
[41:15] they love to wallow in their own urine
[41:21] they they just soak in that stuff you
[42:05] well we find out that there are the
[42:09] Bible talks about tribulation here
[42:11] um
[42:13] so the Bible if you were to go to
[42:16] Matthew 24.
[42:20] 29 verse
[42:24] and don't don't turn to this I'm just
[42:25] going to reference it real quick and
[42:26] brother Ronnie's pregnant reference it
[42:28] as well
[42:30] but I'm just going to read real quick
[42:32] Jeremiah 37.
[42:38] alas for that day is great
[42:42] the last for that day is great so that
[42:44] none is like it
[42:46] it is even the time of Jacob's trouble
[42:50] but he shall be saved out of it
[42:53] is
[43:02] so if we were going to go to Matthew 24
[43:07] now this subject has been taught to us
[43:16] through our founding pastors
[43:20] right our Elder has
[43:23] most of the material that I have
[43:26] materials I I just heard our Elder
[43:30] preach it is
[43:33] so it would benefit us to go back to
[43:35] those reference those yes
[43:40] but how many have ever gone through
[43:42] tribulation
[43:46] right you have tribulations in your life
[43:49] right and the Bible says that there's a
[43:52] one coming that you've never it is
[43:56] right so think about your worst
[43:59] tribulations
[44:02] and a lot of times we say as ministers
[44:06] we say oh we've been through hell this
[44:09] is
[44:14] you've not seen hell
[44:17] is not a place like anything that you've
[44:20] ever seen
[44:22] so the tribulation that you've gone
[44:24] through
[44:26] some great
[44:28] um
[44:30] now we're going to give you the good
[44:31] news
[44:33] how you can escape
[44:37] because there is a way of Escape
[44:41] but so the Bible talks about
[44:43] tribulations here
[44:46] now we heard our our Elder is
[44:51] preach on these two tribulations
[44:55] so we're going to talk about one
[44:57] tribulation first which is going to be
[44:59] Matthew 24 29 yeah
[45:04] Aaron tell us a little bit about that
[45:06] tribulation what happened there
[45:10] so the tribulation we find here in
[45:12] Matthew 24 29.
[45:17] it reads immediately after the
[45:19] tribulation of those days
[45:22] shall the sun be darkened
[45:24] and the moon shall not give her light
[45:26] and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and
[45:28] the powers of Heaven shall be shaken
[45:31] amen the heavens shall be shaken
[45:33] tribulation is
[45:44] so the question is what tribulation is
[45:46] the Bible speaking about here
[45:50] as we heard this Earth has not even seen
[45:53] the Great Tribulation
[45:57] so it couldn't be that
[46:00] so the next question is what day is the
[46:03] Bible talking about
[46:07] so real quick I'm just going to jump to
[46:09] Luke Chapter 21.
[46:12] Lucas
[46:14] and this is our lord Jesus here
[46:16] prophesying
[46:17] Jesus
[46:19] and when you shall see Jerusalem compass
[46:22] with armies then know that the
[46:24] Desolation thereof is nigh then let them
[46:27] return Judea flee to the mountains and
[46:30] let them which are in the midst of it
[46:31] depart out
[46:33] and let them not that are in the
[46:34] countries enter therein to for these be
[46:37] the days of Vengeance that all things
[46:39] which are written may be fulfilled
[46:44] entrance
[46:47] is
[47:01] amen so
[47:09] well speaking in tongues there
[47:12] [Laughter]
[47:14] even Siri wanted to preach
[47:17] all right so the tribulation that we're
[47:21] reading about here
[47:24] it's going to be a when General Titus
[47:27] The Siege the city of Jerusalem is
[47:33] now how many know which Titans were
[47:36] talking about here
[47:39] how many think it's the Titus that we
[47:42] read of in the book of Titus raise your
[47:44] hands
[47:48] I thought it was
[47:52] how many think it was a Roman conquer
[47:54] puentos
[47:57] raise your hand if you think it was that
[48:01] how many things he was a Spanish
[48:04] conquistador
[48:05] Conquistador Espanol
[48:08] no no all right if you chose B please
[48:13] he was a Roman conqueror
[48:15] Conquistador Romano his name was Titus
[48:19] flavius
[48:20] vespinaceous
[48:25] that was the only decent picture I could
[48:27] find of him the others were statues
[48:33] but he was actually known as a very
[48:36] Peaceable man
[48:39] in his earlier years he was uh
[48:43] he was trained to War by his father who
[48:45] was the previous emperor of Rome at the
[48:48] time uh
[48:52] what you would call a very violent
[48:55] person to start out with
[48:58] he was not enough
[49:02] it just so happened that his father put
[49:04] him on this mission
[49:08] to overtake Jerusalem
[49:12] history actually called it the Jewish
[49:14] War like
[49:18] so when he was assigned to the to the
[49:21] city of Jerusalem
[49:24] he didn't just run up in there and start
[49:27] slaughtering people
[49:32] you see Jerusalem was a very well
[49:35] protected City
[49:38] there were high walls all around it
[49:42] they actually had men in there that were
[49:45] well capable of Defending themselves
[49:49] so you see General Titus had to be
[49:52] smarter than that
[49:55] so what he did is he he turned the
[49:59] people against themselves
[50:05] what's the easiest way to get somebody
[50:07] angry because
[50:10] punch him in the face
[50:13] even easier than that you just take away
[50:15] their food
[50:17] you had a bunch of angry people there in
[50:20] Jerusalem
[50:23] because of all their major life
[50:26] resources
[50:30] principales I was watching an
[50:33] interesting video how he actually was
[50:35] able to attack like the pool of Bethesda
[50:37] Miriam
[50:42] getting rid of their water sources agua
[50:48] and he just let it go on
[50:52] not for a week
[50:54] not for two weeks
[50:57] brother Branham says it went on for
[50:59] about two to three years
[51:03] so just for a minute just imagine how
[51:06] hungry you would be after
[51:07] maybe a week
[51:12] I'm sure we'd start to the dog would
[51:14] look pretty good at that point
[51:17] you know if you have livestock I'm sure
[51:20] you're going to be killing your horses
[51:24] well it was worse than that
[51:27] it got to the point where the mothers
[51:30] would start to kill their children
[51:36] they'd have to eat them
[51:39] they'd be so hungry that they get the
[51:41] bark off of the trees
[51:48] you'd see people going insane on the
[51:50] ground like cows eating the grass
[51:57] you're just a total picture of Chaos
[52:04] but you have people so on edge irritable
[52:08] [Music]
[52:11] committing suicide um
[52:15] and then all the while General Titus was
[52:17] just waiting
[52:21] and finally
[52:22] after about two to three years
[52:26] brother Branham says in 1896
[52:31] hi this is troops finally entered
[52:34] Jerusalem
[52:39] slaughtering the citizens
[52:46] so they thought it was bad just not
[52:48] eating not drinking you know the babies
[52:50] being killed
[52:57] but that probably would have been the
[52:59] easy way to get out of this
[53:03] General Titus was anointed to do this
[53:05] job
[53:08] you see God never sends judgment
[53:13] without first giving away of Escape
[53:17] and you might be asking yourself well
[53:19] what do these people do so wrong
[53:23] these were good people
[53:26] in fact brother Branham says they were
[53:29] Israelites
[53:32] God's Own people church members
[53:38] Santos they knew the word real well
[53:42] but you see they failed to do one thing
[53:46] and that was to believe the true sign
[53:49] that God had sent them yes
[53:53] he sent them the Messiah and
[53:57] what did they do with it on the day of
[53:59] Pentecost is
[54:02] get those drunk people oh I mean is a
[54:05] bunch of Holy Rollers
[54:08] then Jesus is performing these Miracles
[54:10] what do they call them Jesus
[54:13] oh he's a devil that's Beelzebub is
[54:17] the very Messiah was right before their
[54:19] eyes
[54:21] and they couldn't even see it
[54:24] you see so God didn't just strike
[54:26] judgment on these people for no reason
[54:33] this is what they chose to do
[54:37] and it got to the points when General
[54:40] Titus finally entered the city
[54:44] we're not like we said we're just going
[54:46] to say like it is he had no mercy
[54:51] record brother says he they ravaged the
[54:55] women in the streets
[54:59] so let's bring it to today
[55:02] the other way they had all the finest
[55:05] houses
[55:07] living good viviendo muy bien they
[55:11] thought they had no need of god
[55:14] good job
[55:16] then 10 minutes later yes minutes
[55:19] they're being stripped of their clothes
[55:23] their children are being gutted right
[55:25] down the middle of themselves
[55:30] and they're asking themselves
[55:33] what's going on
[55:35] but yet they rejected the Messiah
[55:42] and so let's skip down here
[55:46] so what was interesting about this is
[55:50] that a lot of them took on the mentality
[55:52] muchos
[55:55] oh when General Titus gets here
[55:59] let's just call the the god that that's
[56:02] always been here for us
[56:05] he said let's call on this great Jehovah
[56:08] who's always been there
[56:11] he'll rescue us
[56:13] come on everybody let's go to the church
[56:15] let's pray
[56:17] upstairs
[56:21] because they rejected the sign that was
[56:24] already sent to them
[56:28] but I have good news
[56:31] we just read Luke 20 21 20.
[56:36] where Jesus had already said that these
[56:39] things were going to happen Jesus
[56:43] and all those who believed what Jesus
[56:46] had spoken
[56:48] Jesus they were nowhere to be found
[56:53] as soon as they saw those encounters
[56:55] yeah
[57:26] Hallelujah so let's bring it to tonight
[57:28] if that's okay
[57:30] [Music]
[57:31] so I was thinking how does this apply to
[57:33] me
[57:36] you know we can claim to be Christians
[57:40] they claim to be Israelites
[57:43] to believe Jesus
[57:46] so tonight we might claim to even be
[57:48] message Believers
[57:52] but what do we do sometimes
[57:56] we refuse to do those little small
[57:58] things
[58:00] you know we're all we're instructed by
[58:03] the ministry
[58:05] if you said something wrong about a
[58:07] brother or a sister
[58:11] make it right
[58:14] if you're guilty of planting seeds of
[58:16] Discord go make those things right
[58:26] oh we're just gonna go and we're gonna
[58:27] pray that General Titus will pass right
[58:29] by us and not see us
[58:33] we take on that same mentality
[58:37] oh God will forgive me if I just if I'm
[58:39] more sincere and I just don't do it
[58:41] again
[58:45] no that's not the formula
[58:48] formula these people were religious they
[58:52] were sincere as can be esto is
[58:56] so if it took just being sincere
[59:00] then God should have never allowed this
[59:03] to happen to them
[59:06] but it was more than that
[59:09] it was making sure that they had
[59:11] received Christ
[59:15] that's what it is tonight yes
[59:18] you got to make sure it's Christ that we
[59:20] have received
[59:23] the Bible said many false of Christ
[59:25] shall
[59:37] and make sure that it is Christ that we
[59:39] have received
[59:42] the Bible says when you see these things
[59:45] begin to take place
[59:49] you don't have to be afraid
[59:52] just simply look up
[59:54] and know that your Redemption draws now
[59:57] is
[59:59] he said behold I send unto you Elijah
[1:00:03] the prophet is
[1:00:06] and I just like to remind you tonight
[1:00:08] that you're children of God is
[1:00:11] now come back to your Covenant
[1:00:14] come back into the promised land
[1:00:18] what is the promise yes it was on the
[1:00:21] day of Pentecost it's unto you and to
[1:00:23] your children
[1:00:27] that's what the promise is tonight is
[1:00:31] a great day
[1:00:33] it's also a very terrible day
[1:00:37] but come back
[1:00:41] and that's what this tribulation that we
[1:00:44] read about in Matthew was all about
[1:00:49] so then we just that's that
[1:00:53] you're telling me that there's another
[1:00:54] greater than that
[1:00:58] way greater how many think that was
[1:01:02] pretty pretty bad
[1:01:05] right I didn't even mentioned
[1:01:09] if they were caught trying to leave the
[1:01:11] city
[1:01:16] not only were they captured
[1:01:19] but they were crucified in the most
[1:01:22] weirdest positions
[1:01:27] the Romans felt to crucify them that day
[1:01:32] crucified that's how they were crucified
[1:01:36] and everybody could just look at it to
[1:01:40] know hey I'm not trying to leave
[1:01:47] so then in Matthew 24
[1:01:53] it says for then shall be great
[1:01:56] tribulations such as was not since the
[1:01:59] beginning of the world to this time
[1:02:02] no nor ever shall be revelation
[1:02:07] is
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:12] so as your as you're hearing this is
[1:02:17] don't look at that like as a story
[1:02:22] that just happened
[1:02:25] in those times
[1:02:27] right so tribulation
[1:02:30] is either it's past present or future it
[1:02:34] is
[1:02:37] so the Bible says that there's a
[1:02:39] tribulation coming here
[1:02:43] that's gonna come
[1:02:45] right and so the only one that escapes
[1:02:48] that tribulation is
[1:02:54] a bride right La Novia right and so I
[1:02:58] remember the words of our founding
[1:02:59] pastors
[1:03:01] he said there's no reason
[1:03:05] why anybody here
[1:03:08] should not be brine cannot depends
[1:03:25] we fight ourselves into these things
[1:03:29] we say oh I've gone through so much
[1:03:31] tribulation
[1:03:34] if you look back probably at all the
[1:03:37] tribulations you've been through
[1:03:38] regulations
[1:03:41] they were self-inflicted
[1:03:44] you you did that on your own
[1:03:49] now there's things that come on and so
[1:03:52] the bride she she has tribulations
[1:03:56] but God has taken has made a way for her
[1:04:01] why because she has received Christ the
[1:04:04] word in her day
[1:04:07] she hasn't rejected the word no no
[1:04:11] so we're given this opportunity tonight
[1:04:16] now the saddest thing to me
[1:04:20] is that you hear about these things that
[1:04:23] are that are going to take place
[1:04:28] so you heard about what happened with
[1:04:30] Titus
[1:04:32] that was just a Prelude to what's coming
[1:04:37] that ain't even as horrific as it's
[1:04:39] going to be
[1:04:42] as brother Branham says he says that
[1:04:45] they can do it within five minutes from
[1:04:47] now
[1:04:54] Russia has it's already set against
[1:04:58] Russia can make a call right now
[1:05:02] and say surrender
[1:05:05] the brother Brown says that there's
[1:05:07] nothing that this place used to the
[1:05:08] United States can do it is
[1:05:11] it's already in place
[1:05:14] right and he says they can do it in five
[1:05:16] minutes
[1:05:17] either you surrender now
[1:05:20] or in five minutes we'll turn you into
[1:05:22] dust is
[1:05:25] and brother Brown tells about what's
[1:05:27] going to happen
[1:05:29] he talks about it in handwriting on the
[1:05:31] walls
[1:05:35] invasion of the USA
[1:05:38] says that
[1:05:40] ship load after ship load he said
[1:05:42] barcode trans
[1:05:48] so if you think you're gonna stay here
[1:05:51] let me just tell you what you're looking
[1:05:53] forward to um
[1:05:57] there's going to be ship loads of
[1:05:59] barbaric soldiers
[1:06:05] it's going to be a time of Anguish
[1:06:08] it's going to be a Great Tribulation
[1:06:12] the soldiers man is
[1:06:15] you you think you can fight
[1:06:18] you think you're tough
[1:06:20] what are you going to do when they come
[1:06:22] into your house
[1:06:24] take your wife in front of you
[1:06:28] ravish
[1:06:30] take your children
[1:06:33] bash their head on the walls
[1:06:39] it's not a joke
[1:06:41] right but we live every day like if it's
[1:06:43] nothing that's going to happen to us
[1:06:48] we do that
[1:06:49] it was time to take inventory tonight
[1:06:52] it's night for tonight
[1:06:55] let's start checking off the list and
[1:06:57] see where we're at least
[1:07:00] have we rejected today
[1:07:05] say oh I hear the message all the time
[1:07:08] I'm a good
[1:07:10] Persona I don't do this or that you know
[1:07:14] right but let's start checking off the
[1:07:17] list
[1:07:18] let's take inventory of Our Lives
[1:07:22] the Bible says brother Branham says
[1:07:25] that in the times of General Titus
[1:07:29] that the blood flowed through the
[1:07:31] streets
[1:07:35] there's only one Escape tonight
[1:07:40] and that's to find yourself
[1:07:43] rest in the word of God
[1:07:48] amen amen
[1:07:50] so as I said this can be past present or
[1:07:53] future
[1:07:55] and I'm talking just about the literal
[1:07:57] I'm not going profound or this is just
[1:07:59] the literal tribulation
[1:08:01] is
[1:08:04] right and we can get as deep deep as
[1:08:07] deep as you want to get
[1:08:10] we can give you profound Revelations
[1:08:14] well like I said the saddest thing
[1:08:18] it's like our brother Abraham has said
[1:08:20] before ministers have said
[1:08:24] we want to preach that like if everybody
[1:08:27] hears the bride
[1:08:28] um
[1:08:31] right but realistically
[1:08:34] not everybody's the bride
[1:08:37] right
[1:08:39] correct but remember there's no reason
[1:08:41] why you shouldn't be
[1:08:46] right so it's either time to ship up it
[1:08:49] is
[1:09:02] right so the saddest thing is
[1:09:05] that each and every one of you is myself
[1:09:09] included
[1:09:10] we have loved ones
[1:09:14] family members of Familia people we know
[1:09:19] we'll go through this
[1:09:24] right we know that the foolish virgin
[1:09:26] goes through this
[1:09:28] and it's done for her purification yes
[1:09:32] she has got to go through this
[1:09:34] tribulation
[1:09:36] to be saved
[1:09:40] right bye and we read here in the in uh
[1:09:44] 22
[1:09:47] and except those days be shortened okay
[1:09:51] there should no flesh be saved
[1:09:55] but for the elect's sake those days
[1:09:57] shall be
[1:09:59] shortenedos
[1:10:01] and we understand by by the teachings
[1:10:04] that have been brought to us
[1:10:07] we know that the scripture is compounded
[1:10:10] right
[1:10:13] but we found out that this scripture
[1:10:15] here
[1:10:16] was speaking of the Jews
[1:10:20] right we know that how many of you
[1:10:22] remember that Michael shall stand amen
[1:10:27] how many remember that
[1:10:28] amen okay so now is a good indication
[1:10:32] right now
[1:10:34] you check off the Box
[1:10:39] check it out so if we don't if we don't
[1:10:41] know it or we just don't want to raise
[1:10:42] our hand that we know it yeah
[1:10:47] let's check off the box
[1:10:50] say okay this week
[1:10:52] instead of going to the movies
[1:10:56] instead of going to go do this
[1:11:00] okay I'm gonna go back and hear one of
[1:11:02] the messages
[1:11:04] I can refresh in my memory
[1:11:08] amen amen all right so now
[1:11:11] that we know that that's Israel
[1:11:15] right because uh unless the days be
[1:11:18] shortened
[1:11:19] we find out that this Jacob's trouble
[1:11:23] it's three and a half years of
[1:11:25] tribulation
[1:11:27] so I'm going to turn it to brother
[1:11:28] Ronnie
[1:11:30] we can tell us about this
[1:11:33] natural and
[1:11:34] and present time
[1:11:40] then
[1:11:43] uh brother Danny was saying remember
[1:11:45] Danny this is a rough subject
[1:11:49] you know brother Dan I
[1:11:52] you know I'm not
[1:11:54] you know trying to turn my color around
[1:11:55] or anything like that you know
[1:11:58] but this is the hardest message I've
[1:12:01] ever had
[1:12:03] you know because of the because of the
[1:12:05] things that it goes into okay
[1:12:07] you know brother brother Danny I had the
[1:12:10] exact same thing that you did
[1:12:14] because brother Aaron gave the history
[1:12:16] the
[1:12:18] Pastorius brother Danny gave the future
[1:12:22] but what about the present
[1:12:25] you know you know what Jesus is we know
[1:12:28] what Jesus did in the past
[1:12:31] we know what he's gonna do
[1:12:33] but we're ignore what's going on today
[1:12:36] right
[1:12:37] you know and and I just want to try to
[1:12:40] do the best I can to maybe paint a
[1:12:42] little picture for everyone
[1:12:46] his brother Aaron was saying a minute
[1:12:48] ago to to try to do the best I can to
[1:12:51] uh bring it to our modern times right
[1:12:54] now
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:58] to the individual
[1:13:00] you know as you know brother brother
[1:13:02] Danny if you know uh read the scripture
[1:13:04] here on Jeremiah
[1:13:07] if we can turn to that there we can put
[1:13:10] it up there
[1:13:12] Jeremiah 30 verses 6 7 6 and 7.
[1:13:19] and it says asking now
[1:13:22] and see whether a man does travail with
[1:13:25] child
[1:13:29] wherefore wherefore do I see every man
[1:13:32] with his hands on his loins as a woman
[1:13:35] in travail it is
[1:13:41] and all faces are turned into paleness
[1:13:44] alas
[1:13:49] for that day is great
[1:13:52] so that none is like it
[1:13:56] is even the time of Jacob's trouble
[1:14:03] troubles
[1:14:07] but he shall be saved
[1:14:11] that's the key point right there that I
[1:14:13] hope I can get to right here is
[1:14:16] so he shall be saved out of it
[1:14:20] as we heard brother Julian how we give
[1:14:23] the uh the meaning of Jacob is
[1:14:26] you know how he was a deceiver so
[1:14:29] planter
[1:14:32] you know what is the definition of a
[1:14:34] shyster definition
[1:14:41] a person especially a lawyer or a
[1:14:45] politician
[1:14:47] um
[1:14:48] who uses discreditable discreditable or
[1:14:52] unethical methods
[1:14:59] you know so plant to plant that to take
[1:15:02] the place of another
[1:15:04] it's a little bit different than what
[1:15:06] brother Julian had but in essence it's
[1:15:08] the same friends
[1:15:11] you take the place of another
[1:15:14] as through Force
[1:15:17] scheming or strategy
[1:15:21] to replace one thing by something else
[1:15:27] to trip up or overthrow uh
[1:15:32] and the synonyms for foreign
[1:16:03] might get a little a little hairy here
[1:16:05] okay
[1:16:08] and uh I mean to no offense to not want
[1:16:11] any person you know uh
[1:16:14] but the word must be preached amen
[1:16:18] now now here I just wanna maybe again a
[1:16:21] paint a little picture here of the life
[1:16:23] of Jacob you know
[1:16:25] um
[1:16:27] because we can see how his trials his
[1:16:30] tribulations
[1:16:31] would affect and you know how we go
[1:16:33] through similar things
[1:16:39] now Jacob before before any of his
[1:16:42] troubles began
[1:16:47] let me rephrase
[1:16:50] before he was given the name deceiver
[1:16:56] so planter to plantador
[1:17:03] he was already in trouble
[1:17:06] in trials and tribulations
[1:17:09] well brother Ronnie what do you mean by
[1:17:11] that
[1:17:13] now Jacob's troubles began when he was
[1:17:17] in the wombustia
[1:17:20] okay so so this afternoon here is you're
[1:17:25] gonna have to put your spiritual caps on
[1:17:27] okay
[1:17:28] spiritual we've all been taught what
[1:17:30] symbols are and
[1:17:32] what certain things mean in the
[1:17:35] scripture in the Bible
[1:17:38] okay so you're gonna have to put you're
[1:17:40] gonna have to work a little bit here
[1:17:41] with me and you're gonna have to put
[1:17:42] that cap on okay
[1:17:46] but while he was in his mother's womb
[1:17:50] you know he was fighting you know
[1:17:53] brother Aaron I I can see I can see
[1:17:55] Rebecca already
[1:17:57] you know uh you know you've your wife
[1:18:00] has been pregnant before
[1:18:02] and you know sometimes some women get
[1:18:05] real uneasy
[1:18:08] sisters is that right
[1:18:10] you know sometimes you know with the
[1:18:13] baby in there it's it's rough is well
[1:18:18] that was Rebecca you know
[1:18:20] Rebecca I remember hearing our funny
[1:18:22] Pastor one time brother Danny
[1:18:25] he said oh I can see Rebecca they say
[1:18:29] she was almost at the point of
[1:18:33] because of the tribulations and the
[1:18:36] trials of Jacob that was going on inside
[1:18:38] of her tribulation
[1:18:41] now I can see Rebecca here okay
[1:18:45] oh maybe she was trying to fall asleep
[1:18:48] and then all of a sudden she felt a
[1:18:50] punch
[1:18:52] if she felt a kick
[1:18:54] you know I could see her going crazy
[1:18:59] you know what's going on inside of me is
[1:19:03] this is supposed to be a happy time in
[1:19:05] my life
[1:19:08] I'm going to bring forth a child
[1:19:11] you know but she would try maybe try to
[1:19:14] you know
[1:19:15] lay down on the other side right
[1:19:18] maybe some of my sisters can understand
[1:19:20] what I'm saying right
[1:19:23] they have a hard time on one side they
[1:19:25] try the
[1:19:26] others
[1:19:28] you know but but that was Rebecca there
[1:19:30] yeah she felt a kick a punch
[1:19:34] you know so brother Dennis one day she
[1:19:37] got so fed up brother Dan um
[1:19:41] where she went and she inquired of the
[1:19:44] Lord
[1:19:46] you know she didn't she wasn't there she
[1:19:49] didn't go ask her husband to go pray
[1:19:52] she didn't ask her husband to go into
[1:19:54] Inquirer of the Lord
[1:19:59] the Bible says that she went to the Lord
[1:20:03] and she says Lord what's up it's driving
[1:20:06] me crazy
[1:20:08] what what is this that's inside of me
[1:20:12] now we know a woman is a type of the
[1:20:14] church right
[1:20:28] you know so she you know Lord like
[1:20:30] what's going on with inside of me what's
[1:20:32] what's the problem
[1:20:35] and the Lord says
[1:20:37] it there are two nations in here
[1:20:42] there's two people inside
[1:20:45] the one shall be stronger than the other
[1:20:47] Uno said
[1:20:49] and and the the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:20:51] younger
[1:20:53] so so we see here that that Jacob
[1:20:58] his his
[1:21:00] Destiny was already set to Destino yes
[1:21:04] before he was even given the word
[1:21:07] sheister
[1:21:12] or given that name right
[1:21:16] but before that because Destiny was
[1:21:19] already said
[1:21:22] you know and and and
[1:21:24] and it she's so we know the story that
[1:21:27] she produced she produced the twins
[1:21:29] right
[1:21:32] so now here's the question here is
[1:21:39] who was the Revelation given to against
[1:21:42] Isaac Isaac or to Rebecca of who her
[1:21:46] children were
[1:21:49] think about that for a minute
[1:21:52] in her before before the children were
[1:21:56] even born
[1:21:58] she had a revelation of who Jacob was
[1:22:04] and can you imagine Isaac he said who
[1:22:08] was a prophet yeah
[1:22:10] he loves
[1:22:12] and Rebecca love Jacob Rebecca Jacob
[1:22:17] arguments
[1:22:20] she knew brother Dan what what the
[1:22:22] destiny of that child was going to be
[1:22:27] and again she the church Iglesia you
[1:22:30] know you know the the cheaper Rebecca
[1:22:33] produced the twins
[1:22:36] now how many have ever have heard or
[1:22:39] have said themselves
[1:22:43] you know when somebody says oh you know
[1:22:46] where is the Welsh Revival
[1:22:52] I've said it myself
[1:22:54] but I don't care which Revival it is
[1:22:58] every Revival produces a twin
[1:23:02] produce every Revival produces a Isa
[1:23:06] yeah
[1:23:10] keep that in mind okay
[1:23:12] you know and and okay so I'm gonna try
[1:23:15] to bring this to the individual now okay
[1:23:17] I'm not here to you know contradict what
[1:23:20] you said brother Dan
[1:23:22] you know oh but we have troubles right
[1:23:25] every single one of us here we have
[1:23:27] troubles right
[1:23:29] you know we heard brother Danny said
[1:23:31] that a lot of our troubles are
[1:23:33] self-induced right
[1:23:39] and a lot of Jacob's troubles were it
[1:23:42] appeared to be self-induced
[1:23:46] you know but we have troubles here right
[1:23:50] I'm gonna really hear the way I have it
[1:23:52] here yeah
[1:23:53] what are some of our troubles
[1:23:57] as well as Believers and Christians
[1:24:01] what are our troubles
[1:24:03] maybe one day we feel like we're saved
[1:24:07] maybe the next day we don't know maybe
[1:24:10] one day we know all about the word
[1:24:15] the next day we don't know today we are
[1:24:19] saved
[1:24:20] tomorrow we're not saved
[1:24:23] no today I'm going to heaven
[1:24:26] tomorrow I feel like I'm going to hell
[1:24:29] today today we think good of the brother
[1:24:33] tomorrow we don't think
[1:24:36] no today he loves us
[1:24:39] tomorrow we don't think that he loves us
[1:24:43] today I have a message to preach
[1:24:47] tomorrow I don't Manana no today I'm
[1:24:51] happy
[1:24:52] tomorrow
[1:24:54] today I feel like helping out in the
[1:24:56] church
[1:24:58] tomorrow I don't feel like
[1:25:01] today I'm a son or a daughter of God
[1:25:05] tomorrow I don't think so
[1:25:09] today I am worthy
[1:25:13] tomorrow I I don't think I'm worthy
[1:25:16] today I'm good
[1:25:19] tomorrow I'm bad
[1:25:22] everybody
[1:25:26] have they had those thoughts
[1:25:29] I mean I know that's something that you
[1:25:32] know I believe that some I believe
[1:25:33] that's something that every believer
[1:25:35] Christian struggles with
[1:25:38] and they might seem a little simple
[1:25:40] compared to uh with the gentleman here
[1:25:42] we're talking about
[1:25:46] so but have you ever wondered why that
[1:25:49] you think that those thoughts have come
[1:25:50] to you
[1:25:53] because I I know I ain't alone
[1:25:56] you know but have you ever asked
[1:25:58] yourself and wondered you know ask
[1:26:00] yourself why why do I have those
[1:26:02] thoughts
[1:26:06] Paul Paul in the in the Romans chapter 7
[1:26:09] he gives the answer why Pablo in in
[1:26:12] Romanos
[1:26:14] puesta it's because inside of us that
[1:26:17] there is a twin
[1:26:21] the word the word has come to us
[1:26:24] we've had a Revival because the word has
[1:26:27] come to us
[1:26:30] and because we've had a Revival
[1:26:33] and we don't know it that inside of us
[1:26:36] that there is a twin
[1:26:38] again and every Revival twins are
[1:26:42] produced
[1:26:45] right here Brother Dan
[1:26:48] Brother Aaron Julian right here right
[1:26:53] now there is a Jacob and an Esau sitting
[1:26:56] down right here right now
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:26:59] or you know
[1:27:04] you know I'm not talking about devil
[1:27:06] that with you know a red guy in red with
[1:27:09] horns a pitchfork and a pointy tails
[1:27:16] but both religious little almost really
[1:27:19] kyosu that's why brother Julian
[1:27:23] it is so close
[1:27:26] that it'll deceive the
[1:27:30] burials if it was possible
[1:27:33] so close
[1:27:35] in Malachi 4 5 and malachias cuatro
[1:27:39] cinco
[1:27:40] so on the surface
[1:27:43] you know Esau was a good guy
[1:27:48] he was a gentleman
[1:27:50] oh man brother Brandon says as far as
[1:27:54] his character that he was a good guy
[1:27:58] you know but but and Jacob again was
[1:28:01] like his brother Julian said
[1:28:04] brother Brandon says he was a sissified
[1:28:06] Storyteller is
[1:28:11] a mama's boy uh
[1:28:18] um
[1:28:20] and Esau again was had a better
[1:28:23] character more of a gentleman
[1:28:26] character
[1:28:28] imagine that
[1:28:30] a seat from the devil and yet better
[1:28:33] person than Jacob
[1:28:38] and both from a righteous
[1:28:42] now watch this
[1:28:44] and both came from the promised son
[1:28:50] which was which was Isaac right
[1:28:53] that
[1:28:54] blows my mind as told me they're burning
[1:28:57] up inside
[1:28:59] no no no now watch this right here okay
[1:29:03] we get so caught up that Jacob was a
[1:29:06] deceiver and a sheister
[1:29:12] again remember Jacob's troubles
[1:29:17] we get so caught up that it was Jacob
[1:29:21] but but on the inside
[1:29:24] luckily luckily God looks at us on the
[1:29:26] ends from the inside right
[1:29:29] because you go back to the prophet uh
[1:29:32] and the message
[1:29:36] brother Branham says Esau was a shyster
[1:29:40] in a deceiver is
[1:29:45] we'll get to that here in a second okay
[1:29:47] yeah no no no now imagine this this
[1:29:50] again this this blows me away okay
[1:29:55] Esau was was Isaac's favorite son
[1:29:57] remember
[1:30:02] Isaac was a was a prophet okay
[1:30:05] Esau was his favorite son
[1:30:10] again morally speaking that he would he
[1:30:13] he outshined Jacob in every way yes
[1:30:19] he was more religious are they working
[1:30:24] did more missionary work than Jacob yes
[1:30:27] oh
[1:30:30] oh
[1:30:32] people don't like that one right well no
[1:30:33] no let's let's go stories why porque
[1:30:36] because the Bible says that Esau was a
[1:30:38] man of the field Campo
[1:30:43] come on now this is Jacob's troubles now
[1:30:45] I told you this is going to get a little
[1:30:46] yes
[1:30:47] we think a lot of times we think because
[1:30:50] we go out and do these things
[1:30:53] that we're in the will of God
[1:30:57] I'm a bad dude because I go out and
[1:30:59] preach around the world
[1:31:07] yeah Jacob was a specified
[1:31:15] in other words so we can understand it
[1:31:17] like people say like this put it in
[1:31:19] layman's terms of
[1:31:25] Jacob was a guy that never went out to
[1:31:27] the missionary felt like he stayed in
[1:31:28] church
[1:31:32] swallow that one right yeah
[1:31:36] no amen's there huh
[1:31:39] no Amen on that one it's all right but
[1:31:41] it is that's the word of God right there
[1:31:54] so watch watch this okay again Rebecca
[1:31:58] had a revelation of who Jacob and Esau
[1:32:00] were Rebecca Revelation
[1:32:04] this this again this blows me away yes
[1:32:10] so Rebecca she would look and she would
[1:32:14] study them
[1:32:17] Jacob
[1:32:19] now this is from our founding Pastor
[1:32:21] here is
[1:32:22] and the one that was planning the whole
[1:32:25] thing
[1:32:28] how to get the birthright
[1:32:32] to the one where God had made the
[1:32:35] promise to which was Jacob
[1:32:40] Rebecca where Rebecca
[1:32:43] how much Jacob was given the those
[1:32:46] titles
[1:32:49] now the whole time it was Rebecca
[1:32:52] where Rebecca she had a plan the whole
[1:32:54] time
[1:32:59] blows me away
[1:33:01] now right right here okay so this is
[1:33:03] where it's going to get a little hairy
[1:33:04] here okay
[1:33:05] okay so Jacob's troubles in the church
[1:33:10] so so right here I'm gonna play an audio
[1:33:13] clip of our founding Pastor here
[1:33:18] I know you're interpreting me but
[1:33:20] brother Jimmy has the paper right no I
[1:33:22] didn't give it
[1:33:24] you know I left it
[1:33:27] okay uh
[1:33:29] Sam there's a desk up there there's a
[1:33:32] paper
[1:33:35] there's a paper up there on the desk up
[1:33:37] there can you get it got it got it oh
[1:33:39] he's got it
[1:33:41] okay so there's no interpretation okay
[1:33:44] so I'm gonna play the audio then Brother
[1:33:47] Jimmy's gonna interpret it
[1:33:50] and then I'm gonna play it again and the
[1:33:53] reason why I'm gonna play it twice
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:57] is because on some of this is and I'm
[1:34:00] playing this to emphasize what I'm
[1:34:02] saying a little bit more okay
[1:34:05] and he and he's kind of whispering here
[1:34:08] so it's a little the audio is a little
[1:34:09] low yeah
[1:34:13] if you can play that there please
[1:34:16] you don't want a cool piece c-o-u-p
[1:34:19] oo you can put the words on there hey
[1:34:24] sick for instance sister Elizabeth
[1:34:32] that's a boy
[1:34:35] let's paint the tambourine
[1:34:44] misters get together
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:59] boycott Malacca for if I boycott
[1:35:03] the people are expecting it in the
[1:35:05] outside is in US
[1:35:08] close in the churches
[1:35:10] many churches I can preach they will let
[1:35:13] these
[1:35:14] you don't want a cool piece c-o-u-p
[1:35:19] is
[1:35:33] boycott
[1:35:42] churches
[1:35:45] this is an egg
[1:35:47] is
[1:36:05] there it is
[1:36:23] you don't have to play it okay
[1:36:26] now can you imagine that
[1:36:28] Jacob's troubles
[1:36:30] in the church boycott
[1:36:36] the definition of boycott definition
[1:36:39] to refuse to have dealings with
[1:36:44] now brother Aaron I know Aaron isn't
[1:36:47] that what happened in Jerusalem
[1:36:49] they cut off the resources
[1:36:55] to to refuse to have dealings with a
[1:36:57] person organization
[1:36:59] Etc organization
[1:37:04] Etc or refuse to buy as a protest
[1:37:08] protest to exclude exclude normal social
[1:37:12] or professional activity
[1:37:18] to exclude from normal professional
[1:37:21] activities in the church activities
[1:37:27] now now I read a while ago I read the
[1:37:30] the that the synonym of supplant was
[1:37:37] supersededes now when I read the
[1:37:40] definition of boycott I saw super seed
[1:37:42] and I was like Matt same word definition
[1:37:47] it's the same meaning
[1:37:50] to replace and power uh uh
[1:37:54] Authority
[1:37:58] why another person or thing to
[1:38:04] boycott or cost a voice
[1:38:08] or in other words to set aside or cause
[1:38:10] to cause to be set aside right
[1:38:17] crucified brother crucified crucifying
[1:38:20] the effects of the word today in the
[1:38:22] people because
[1:38:25] brother Isaiah doesn't got it
[1:38:27] brother Noah
[1:38:31] brother brother Isaac don't got it
[1:38:35] brother Yandel has it boycott
[1:38:39] I'm crucifying the crew the effects of
[1:38:42] the word and the people right here right
[1:38:45] now
[1:38:48] and we're expecting it on the economical
[1:38:51] Council of churches
[1:38:55] one man can be a denomination
[1:38:58] and what is a denomination
[1:39:01] Church oh so this denomination gets
[1:39:04] together with this denomination
[1:39:07] and we get together with this
[1:39:09] denomination we get together with this
[1:39:10] one is
[1:39:13] and we crucified the effects of the word
[1:39:15] because
[1:39:17] I'm not calling you guys that you guys
[1:39:19] are denominations just for an example
[1:39:22] that's the spirit of the day today
[1:39:26] if someone doesn't like what you say
[1:39:28] yeah
[1:39:34] cancel him oh we don't like what he
[1:39:38] preaches cancel the guy no sir
[1:39:44] anyways tribulations
[1:39:52] all right
[1:39:57] and I think I'm gonna I'm gonna just say
[1:39:59] this and then and then I'll stop okay we
[1:40:01] had to see this is
[1:40:09] Jacob wrestled with the angel right
[1:40:12] now now watch this this this this this
[1:40:15] again this blows me away
[1:40:18] one of the biggest tribulations
[1:40:22] one of the biggest problems for a
[1:40:24] Believer
[1:40:25] um
[1:40:28] is recognizing who you are recognosis
[1:40:32] recognizing yourself
[1:40:34] that means all we can recognize the
[1:40:36] preachers
[1:40:40] but one of the hardest things is to
[1:40:42] recognize who you are
[1:40:46] right
[1:40:48] easy to see the person behind the pulpit
[1:40:51] is
[1:40:52] but that only gets you the third base
[1:40:54] but then
[1:40:57] now Jacob wrestled with the angel and he
[1:40:59] overcame the angel right
[1:41:03] but watch this brother Branham
[1:41:06] paragraph 100 and the message My
[1:41:09] Redeemer Lives
[1:41:14] one side a great poster
[1:41:19] well what he was really called he was a
[1:41:22] deceiver
[1:41:25] the very word Jacob means deceiver
[1:41:29] and when he was on this side
[1:41:34] a great healthy strong deceiver
[1:41:40] on the other side
[1:41:42] a living Prince
[1:41:45] um
[1:41:46] that had been with God
[1:41:50] was blessed and the Hope was it within
[1:41:53] him
[1:41:56] Jacob again I mean it's a planter
[1:41:58] deceiver right
[1:42:00] watch this and we realized that Jacob's
[1:42:04] life really represented Grace
[1:42:11] so Jacob means Grace
[1:42:14] on the time of Jacob's troubles brother
[1:42:18] it says he shall be saved he said
[1:42:23] it was Grace through Jacob's life the
[1:42:26] whole time
[1:42:29] church we go to trials and tribulations
[1:42:34] we go through troubles
[1:42:36] but Revelations 2 9 says this
[1:42:39] apocalypsies thank you brother Daniel
[1:42:42] he says I know your trouble
[1:42:47] I know your tribulation
[1:42:50] church although we go through these
[1:42:52] trials
[1:42:53] and all these things yes
[1:42:56] you shall be saved out of it
[1:42:59] because it's been the grace of God
[1:43:02] the whole time
[1:43:07] they hand it out back to you
[1:43:13] amen how many enjoy that this evening
[1:43:23] hey man we can
[1:43:25] I feel like preaching now
[1:43:28] I could start preaching yeah
[1:43:31] so in conclusion
[1:43:34] we're giving all the opportunity tonight
[1:43:36] amen
[1:43:38] so it's time for us to make our election
[1:43:40] and calling sure
[1:43:42] election
[1:43:44] time to put away the questions
[1:43:48] like your questions like is this right
[1:43:51] or is this wrong question is
[1:43:56] you're still wondering what our founding
[1:43:58] Apostle priest is
[1:44:02] running Pastor if you're still wondering
[1:44:04] like oh was he right
[1:44:06] correct you know brother Danny I was
[1:44:10] just telling my brother this the other
[1:44:11] day
[1:44:13] you know and it's been said from behind
