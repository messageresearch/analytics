[29:12] amen God bless you Amen brother Julian
[29:15] and the musicians thank you
[29:20] it's a pleasure to be in the house once
[29:21] again
[29:23] an honor to be able to be standing
[29:25] before you soon
[29:28] and while you're on your feet may you
[29:30] would you uh join me with that in
[29:33] Reading Matthew chapter 26 email
[29:37] foreign
[29:43] I asked brother Noah that or told
[29:46] brother Noah that I was gonna just read
[29:47] it in English to save time
[29:50] in English they're gonna put it here in
[29:53] spanish here yeah
[29:58] Matthew 26 and verse 50. okay
[30:03] and it says
[30:06] and Jesus said unto him
[30:09] friend wherefore art thou come
[30:12] then came they and laid hands on Jesus
[30:15] and took him
[30:18] 51.
[30:21] and behold one of them which was
[30:24] which were with Jesus
[30:26] stretched out his hand
[30:30] and Drew his sword
[30:33] and struck a servant of the high priest
[30:36] as smooth off his ear
[30:39] now notice here that he uh he again as I
[30:44] was making episodes as I was reading
[30:48] he took out he stretched out his hand
[30:51] extended sumanu and got his sword
[30:55] he didn't get Jesus's sword
[30:57] Jesus because Jesus never had a sword
[31:00] Jesus because Jesus was the sword Jesus
[31:04] was the word
[31:06] but this gentleman here didn't have that
[31:09] sword
[31:11] he had his own
[31:13] he may be seated
[31:15] we're going to read uh verse 52.
[31:20] Ben said Jesus unto him
[31:23] put up again thy sword
[31:26] into his place
[31:28] for all that take the sword Shall Perish
[31:31] with the sword
[31:34] now if you would join me with uh in Mark
[31:36] chapter 14.
[31:39] verse 46 verse and they laid their hands
[31:44] on him and took him
[31:46] and one of them that stood by Drew a
[31:49] sword
[31:50] and smooth the servant of the high
[31:52] priest and cut off his ear
[31:56] amen if you join me with in Luke chapter
[31:58] 22
[32:01] verse 49.
[32:05] that says
[32:06] when they which were about him saw what
[32:09] would follow
[32:10] they said unto him Lord shall we Smite
[32:14] with the sword
[32:16] and one of them smote the servant of the
[32:19] high priest and cut off his right ear
[32:24] and Jesus said and Jesus answered and
[32:26] said suffer ye thus far
[32:29] and he touched his ear
[32:31] and healed him
[32:33] so I want you to notice here that that
[32:35] Luke is saying something a little bit
[32:37] different than what Matthew and Mark
[32:39] said
[32:42] let me rephrase that not something
[32:44] different he adds a little something
[32:46] little more to it
[32:50] we're seeing the same scene here
[32:52] islamism but but Luke is emphasizing the
[32:56] right ear
[32:59] and he's emphasizing that Jesus touched
[33:02] his ear
[33:05] amen now if you turn with me with the
[33:08] Book of John
[33:09] De Juan yes
[33:16] then said Simon Peter having a sword
[33:19] drew it
[33:22] as smooth the high priest servant and
[33:24] cut off his ear his right ear
[33:27] the servant's name was melchus
[33:30] then said Jesus unto Peter
[33:32] put up thy sword into the sheath
[33:35] the cope which my father hath given me
[33:37] shall I not drink it
[33:40] amen so here here we in the Book of John
[33:44] John takes it just a little bit further
[33:47] than what Luke did
[33:49] not only does he mention the year
[33:53] but John is the only one that mentions
[33:56] the two by name
[33:59] Peter with the sword
[34:02] who's at the receiving end of the sword
[34:07] amen so these four gospels
[34:10] there are these uh they're known as the
[34:12] four gospels right
[34:15] and you might ask well brother Ronnie
[34:17] well why did you read the same story out
[34:19] of the four gospels
[34:23] where can I get to that but before we do
[34:27] I I want to make emphasis on these
[34:29] things here
[34:31] each gospel
[34:33] each writer has a meaning to it it's not
[34:39] just there just by coincidence
[34:41] now to start with the number four is the
[34:45] number of Deliverance
[34:48] now these four gospels
[34:51] they are the framework to the church
[34:55] they are the guards to the temple
[34:59] they are the guards to the Pentecostal
[35:01] blessings
[35:05] without these four gospels
[35:08] there is no Pentecost this so they are
[35:13] they are the
[35:16] four living creatures
[35:19] the Flying Eagle Volante which is John
[35:22] is one look the man which is Luke is
[35:26] Lucas the lion Leon Matthew and the ox
[35:30] is Mark is uh Marcos now they are the
[35:34] guards to the throne Guardians now how
[35:38] many have the Holy Ghost here
[35:44] how many are the Temple of the Holy
[35:47] ghosts so so God moved his throne from
[35:51] Heaven
[35:53] down to earth into the heart of man
[35:57] you have the Holy Ghost
[36:00] you have four guards that protect you
[36:04] why because your heart is the throne
[36:08] we find that in uh you know the temple
[36:11] in the First Corinthians chapter six
[36:16] here in uh here in this scene here with
[36:18] with malcus and Peter against
[36:21] we we uh this isn't the scene of The
[36:24] Garden of Gethsemane when Jesus was
[36:25] praying it's the sinners
[36:29] now this was the last miracle that Jesus
[36:32] did before he was uh crucified
[36:36] Jesus is
[36:43] the Bible says was a servant of the high
[36:46] priest
[36:49] brother Branham calls them that he says
[36:52] that he's a priest
[36:55] you know but as I Googled him and I
[36:57] tried to find out a little bit more
[36:58] about Marcus
[37:01] I found out that there's not a lot of
[37:03] melkes
[37:05] you know the only thing I found was that
[37:08] he was of the tribal Benjamin cooking
[37:10] contest
[37:12] it wasn't until until I went to the
[37:15] Greek Lexicon and I found out what the
[37:17] name melkus means no it is
[37:26] so right away the Holy Spirit catches my
[37:28] attention
[37:30] he was a priest and he means
[37:34] and the Holy Spirit says now did he not
[37:37] make all of us Kings and Priests
[37:42] oh how dare you brother Ronnie how dare
[37:44] you compares to malcus
[37:47] he was assisting in the rest of Jesus
[37:52] we've all betrayed Jesus at one time or
[37:54] another
[37:56] Jesus
[37:58] we are all Gentiles by Nature contrary
[38:01] to God
[38:04] but he paid us Kings and Priests
[38:08] so now who is Peter
[38:11] simple questions right ABCs
[38:14] Peter was an apostle
[38:17] the chief Apostle
[38:20] and Peter was the one that had the great
[38:23] revelation of who Jesus was
[38:27] Jesus Christ the son of the Living God
[38:30] it is
[38:31] the one that had the keys to the kingdom
[38:34] in his hands
[38:36] now Peter means the Pedro significa
[38:39] means Rock significa Roca it means
[38:43] and stone means it's a confession
[38:46] now I want you to notice here okay
[38:49] now Peter had his sword
[38:53] not Jesus
[38:57] and with his confession
[38:59] with his Revelations
[39:06] sometimes that's us right we use our the
[39:09] word Loosely
[39:13] we use our Revelation a little Loosely
[39:17] and we begin to chop people to pieces
[39:24] my Revelation is my Revelation is I
[39:29] don't care who it hurts
[39:31] what a horrible attitude
[39:35] do not care what your Revelation does to
[39:38] a person
[39:40] so go over there and chop them two
[39:42] pieces
[39:43] what a horrible what a horrible
[39:46] condition to be in um
[39:49] what Jesus says Peter Pedro put your
[39:54] sword away
[39:55] put your sword away Peter what is Jesus
[39:58] about to do for Peter said Jesus por
[40:01] Pedro
[40:02] if we go back to our to our uh our
[40:05] pastor brother Calum
[40:07] back in October in the message God
[40:09] remembers and God forgets
[40:15] he says talking about malcus and Peter
[40:19] Pedro he says Jesus said put that away
[40:23] Jesus
[40:24] put the sword away you want to use the
[40:28] sword it's going to be used on you Jesus
[40:34] picks up the ear Jesus
[40:37] and justifies Peter who's defica Pedro
[40:40] remember that yeah everybody remember
[40:42] that and to me I was I was blown away
[40:45] when he said that is
[40:47] justifies Peter like if you have never
[40:49] done it
[40:51] we do sometimes we do something wrong
[40:54] oh Lord forgive me Lord Lord justify me
[40:58] Lord
[41:00] right see we do something wrong we
[41:02] offend somebody
[41:04] [Music]
[41:05] Lord forgive me Lord Lord justify me
[41:10] but in order for the Lord to justify
[41:13] Peter
[41:15] Pedro he had to restore melchized
[41:19] he had to restore the right ear
[41:22] restaurant
[41:24] man if you can follow me here and again
[41:28] melchiz is Kings and Priests
[41:32] which we are
[41:34] the Book of Revelations right he says
[41:36] they made us Kings and Priests
[41:39] now now look or Lucas
[41:44] as I said that
[41:47] all the gospels have a meaning
[41:50] significado Luke 22 50 Lucas ventilo
[41:54] cincuenta again he says he mentions the
[41:56] right year
[41:57] 51 it says that Jesus touched his ear
[42:02] now you ever you know I don't know if
[42:05] you've thought about this or not or
[42:07] known this is
[42:09] but for me I wondered why was it that
[42:13] that Luke is the only one that talks
[42:14] about the healing of of malcols
[42:20] it's the same story but there's only one
[42:22] that mentions the healing islamism
[42:27] and that is again every writer has a
[42:30] meaning
[42:31] significado and Luke was a doctor Lucas
[42:35] and therefore I can I can imagine Luke
[42:37] Luke
[42:39] being a doctor
[42:41] and do everything he can to be able to
[42:43] help or heal people
[42:47] he sees the scene of Jesus
[42:50] and without any kind of medications
[42:54] without any kind of stitches
[42:59] trees
[43:13] imagine that not even a scar so you can
[43:15] imagine how Blown Away Luke is Right
[43:20] Luke sees this and right away he starts
[43:22] begin
[43:24] one goes with Jesus put off the right
[43:27] ear of the servant of the priest
[43:31] oh but Jesus touched it and killed his
[43:34] ear
[43:38] again sometimes we do something that's
[43:39] wrong
[43:41] correct we come to the Altar and we cry
[43:44] Lord forgive me Lord justify me senor
[43:48] and we all want to be justified it's one
[43:51] of the steps right
[43:53] but in being justified
[43:56] the Lord comes to justify you know
[43:59] does he heal your brother
[44:03] to justify you does he heal your brother
[44:05] over here
[44:08] if he's healed and there's still a scar
[44:10] Cielos
[44:14] that's not a that's not a true
[44:16] justification
[44:18] because in Justified it's like if you
[44:21] never did it
[44:24] so there's not even a scarf
[44:33] healing and justification they go
[44:35] together
[44:38] now I went to the Greek word in the
[44:40] where it says touched
[44:45] it means to cling to is uh
[44:50] to attach one's self regards and they
[44:54] took me to the root word which means or
[44:55] which is
[44:58] and this this right here taught me by
[45:01] surprise okay
[45:04] the root word of the of the root word
[45:06] root meaning of the word touched
[45:12] means to to fasten fire to a thing
[45:18] to set on fire and spindle in sender En
[45:21] Fuego
[45:24] what what better way to to heal a person
[45:28] or what better way to set a person on
[45:31] fire
[45:32] in Fuego
[45:35] that when we've done something wrong to
[45:36] them if we're going to heal them
[45:44] we talk about a fire what a better way
[45:47] to do it than to do that
[45:51] now John
[45:53] again every writer has a meaning
[45:56] significado
[46:00] just checking my timer
[46:04] John he's the type of
[46:07] type of the Bride right one is John is
[46:10] also a type of a True Believer one is
[46:14] but he is also a type of love
[46:18] and again every writer has a meaning
[46:22] significant so why is it that John is
[46:24] the only one that mentions the name
[46:27] because it is only God's true love is
[46:32] I can call the name of the bride
[46:36] and there's only love that can do that
[46:40] he was assisting in the arrest of Jesus
[46:43] Jesus
[46:47] How could a person be touched by Jesus
[46:49] and be the same
[46:53] Persona brother Brandon brother Branham
[46:56] in the message what it takes to overcome
[46:58] all unbelief
[47:03] brother Jacob read this the other day
[47:07] but it's worth mentioning again
[47:12] now there is a time that a man can come
[47:16] to a place where he can have a purpose
[47:23] it's something that will change him
[47:26] and that is
[47:28] when a man meets God
[47:32] can never be the same
[47:35] if he ever meets God face to face
[47:39] it will change him in spite of anything
[47:42] you can do about it
[47:47] man can never be the same after he once
[47:50] meets God um
[47:54] I believe that malcus became a Believer
[47:58] and that's why John gives mentions a
[48:01] name
[48:04] imagine what what greater thing
[48:08] when Jesus comes and touches him Jesus
[48:11] now imagine we've all been hit in the
[48:14] air right
[48:17] did a lot of dumb stuff when I was
[48:19] younger I've definitely been hitting the
[48:21] Earth
[48:25] maybe that's my problem now right
[48:29] and
[48:31] [Music]
[48:38] uh
[48:50] John being a type of the Bride calling
[48:52] him by name
[48:54] again because only love can do such a
[48:57] thing
[48:59] now we're going to get that to the year
[49:01] here in a second
[49:04] now this miracle was the last miracle
[49:07] that Jesus did
[49:09] Jesus before he was crucified crucified
[49:13] what was it the restoration the
[49:17] reconciliation
[49:20] right here
[49:22] of the Kings and Priests
[49:28] Peter cut off with Peter with Peter with
[49:31] his sword
[49:32] he cut off the ear like but now here
[49:36] comes the sword
[49:39] Jesus himself he comes over here and
[49:42] restores it
[49:44] not only did he justify Peter
[49:47] Pedro He restored malcus's ability
[49:51] to be able to comprehend the word of God
[49:57] to comprehend El comprende we're going
[50:00] to get to that here in a second
[50:02] now what is the importance of the year
[50:05] you're
[50:10] shouting a lot you're starting too much
[50:13] brother doubting too much
[50:15] we all know that simply simple right one
[50:18] of the five senses of the body
[50:22] to be able to hear
[50:25] right right the little babies know that
[50:29] but what is the other purpose of the
[50:31] year
[50:33] there's another purpose through the year
[50:35] that is very important to the body
[50:42] for balance is
[50:45] without your ear without your
[50:47] equilibrium since
[50:54] now now
[50:58] you know has anybody ever had like
[50:59] vertigo I know brother Isaac right yeah
[51:04] has anyone ever had like you know issues
[51:06] maybe ear infections something like that
[51:08] where your ears just not there
[51:14] and you're you're out of it right
[51:17] you're out of here oh man you can't even
[51:19] think straight he said
[51:20] sometimes you can't even stand to your
[51:22] feet
[51:24] oh by the way I'm continuing with
[51:26] brother Danny and brother Abraham
[51:30] where do you stand
[51:32] the subtitle balance
[51:36] now now watch this
[51:40] science says that's the science okay you
[51:43] can you can go there you can look this
[51:44] up
[51:46] it says that the left here is
[51:50] tuned more for music is
[51:54] although we can hear uh voices and
[51:57] everything with our left here
[52:01] the main function of the of the left
[52:03] here
[52:04] is tuned for music and emotion is uh
[52:16] got us right here cut off right
[52:21] now right here
[52:22] is tuned for speech is
[52:28] and it amplifies and amplifies the
[52:31] speech amplification so does not the
[52:34] bible say that without faith that is
[52:35] impossible to please God
[52:38] and Faith commit by the hearing of the
[52:41] faith comments by hearing
[52:44] and the hearing by the word
[52:47] now again and being able to hear you can
[52:50] comprehend
[52:55] the definition of comprehend the
[52:57] definition
[52:59] to contain container or hold within a
[53:03] scope
[53:06] the significance or amount of something
[53:09] or significance to take in para tomorrow
[53:14] Embrace or to include or include as part
[53:20] of something bigger broader
[53:23] now this is the one that that gets me
[53:26] right here
[53:28] to grasp the meaning of or the
[53:31] significance significado
[53:35] of or the nature of something wow
[53:40] so Jesus restored his comprehension
[53:45] isn't that what Jesus does to us yes
[53:52] we hear the word of God
[53:54] we have faith the name of space now we
[53:57] can comprehend or grasp the nature of
[53:59] God
[54:02] embrace the nature of God
[54:07] here I'm going to be finishing here I
[54:08] don't know what time I got up here
[54:15] a couple more minutes I'm gonna end with
[54:16] this Brother Carlos I'm gonna get ready
[54:20] I'll remember to read this here it says
[54:22] to comprehend
[54:24] is
[54:25] to grasp something's complete nature or
[54:29] meaning is
[54:34] thus uh often a bit stronger than to
[54:38] understand
[54:41] for example for example you may
[54:44] understand the instructions in a
[54:46] handbook
[54:48] without completely comprehending its
[54:51] purpose
[54:53] so my mind goes to something how you
[54:55] know you ever got get like a toy or
[54:57] something for your kids
[54:58] furniture you got to put it together
[55:01] [Music]
[55:03] you have the instructions
[55:05] and you follow the instructions on how
[55:07] to be able to build your things
[55:12] but even there's certain pieces they're
[55:14] like is this for but I said
[55:17] I don't need it
[55:22] they're trying to put something together
[55:23] like I don't need this anymore
[55:30] like oh oh I I now I can comprehend like
[55:33] you know I needed that part
[55:37] and I'm going to be finishing with this
[55:39] Brother Carlos
[55:40] so he cut off melkus's ability to
[55:43] comprehend or to be able to hear or
[55:46] listen to the word of God
[55:51] why does it say hearing and the hearing
[55:55] by the word
[55:58] as I said a minute ago science says your
[56:01] left ear PL is uh tuned for music and
[56:04] tones
[56:09] the right ear process of the speech now
[56:15] it always seems like there's like a lot
[56:17] of it always seems like there's always
[56:19] something throwing up about the tape
[56:20] right
[56:24] so left here the mechanical Parts
[56:30] the mechanical Parts the magnetic tapes
[56:36] by hearing right
[56:38] now again this is this is science it's
[56:42] not this is in brother Ronnie or the
[56:43] message or nothing this is science
[56:47] but the right ear process processes
[56:54] and without one sinuno without the right
[56:57] ear
[56:59] I'm walking to brother Elijah
[57:02] Elijah without my right ear
[57:05] I have my focus on him I'm walking
[57:08] through brother Elijah but
[57:12] um
[57:16] restore the right ear put the left ear
[57:18] off restaurant
[57:24] now without the balance
[57:26] I have my side on the goal
[57:30] I have my site to get to the
[57:34] persona but without the year
[57:36] without the balance
[57:41] I might I'm trying to get over here
[57:47] because where do we stand
[57:51] how can we stand
[57:53] if we don't have a balance of both years
[57:59] never stop listening to the message of
[58:01] the hour
[58:05] the voice of God to us in these last
[58:08] days
[58:10] yes
[58:15] young people always listen to brother
[58:18] Brown don't ever stop that is
[58:28] how can we stand
[58:30] now if we're the spiritual body of the
[58:33] Lord Jesus
[58:35] Christ how can the spiritual body stand
[58:42] cut out listening to the message
[58:45] you can't do it
[58:48] how can the the spiritual body of the
[58:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[58:52] if you cut out the ministry the faithful
[58:55] ministers
[59:07] don't ever stop listening to this to the
[59:09] message
[59:11] don't stop listening to the to the the
[59:13] faithful Ministry
[59:16] both here both and you'll be balanced
[59:20] balenciado
[59:23] amen God bless you
[59:53] well tonight
[59:55] thank you brother Ron for that because
[59:59] man
[1:00:01] thank the Lord for his word tonight amen
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:09] get my timer going here because I always
[1:00:12] get rolling and then and then I forget
[1:00:14] to pay attention
[1:00:16] uh but I do just kind of want to maybe
[1:00:19] talk a little bit tonight uh uh on on on
[1:00:23] the thought of of
[1:00:25] let every man examine himself and maybe
[1:00:28] piggybacking on something that some
[1:00:30] things that brother Ronnie said
[1:00:34] [Music]
[1:00:35] yes
[1:00:37] and and tonight forgive us but but I'm
[1:00:40] gonna I'm gonna pick on the Apostle
[1:00:42] Peter tonight
[1:00:45] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna beat
[1:00:47] him up just a little bit but
[1:00:50] that's all right so what what Ronnie was
[1:00:53] talking about was was when when Peter
[1:00:56] cut off malcus is here right
[1:01:01] and this thought that I've had is
[1:01:03] something that the Lord's been working
[1:01:04] with me on over some time yes
[1:01:10] and and the thought is is that that
[1:01:14] you know we live in an age where
[1:01:21] like never before
[1:01:24] there's a lot of there's a lot of of
[1:01:27] sort of self-help kind of things
[1:01:33] yeah you know I don't know if you've
[1:01:35] noticed like there's a lot of
[1:01:37] motivational speakers and and things
[1:01:40] like that much
[1:01:46] oh yeah just self-help
[1:01:53] something like that right so so but but
[1:01:56] if you notice like a lot of the the
[1:01:58] self-help things
[1:02:01] they're they're there for every thing
[1:02:07] you want to be a better writer
[1:02:09] there's a book for that
[1:02:12] you want to be a better Barber
[1:02:14] there's a book for that you want to be a
[1:02:18] better painter
[1:02:19] there's a book for that you want to run
[1:02:22] faster
[1:02:25] right and and there's all these books
[1:02:28] that have all these answers
[1:02:32] and and there's even a line of books
[1:02:36] that that if maybe you're not really
[1:02:40] super intelligent okay
[1:02:43] it's called accounting for dummies is
[1:02:50] they have a whole series of stuff for
[1:02:52] dummies
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:55] and and yet yet you see all this
[1:02:59] self-help stuff
[1:03:03] and at the end of the day you look out
[1:03:05] in the rest of the world
[1:03:11] and everybody who claims self-help is
[1:03:17] so unbelievably lost
[1:03:22] because they're lacking something right
[1:03:27] they're lacking this self-help book
[1:03:31] right this is the most important
[1:03:33] self-help book ever written
[1:03:38] but but what's so important about about
[1:03:42] this this thought process that that is
[1:03:45] that is rampant in the world right now
[1:03:48] is
[1:03:51] that often times it seems to stop at the
[1:03:55] doors of the church
[1:03:59] and what I mean by that is I want to
[1:04:03] take Peter Peter and and Paul and and
[1:04:05] maybe compare and contrast them a little
[1:04:07] bit
[1:04:10] you see the Apostle Peter Pedro he was a
[1:04:15] tremendous man
[1:04:17] the Apostle Peter he had the keys to the
[1:04:20] kingdom
[1:04:23] he he was side by side with Jesus
[1:04:28] he studied under the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:33] and Peter could very easily
[1:04:38] Peter could look outside of himself
[1:04:42] and and he could see
[1:04:45] maybe things going on in the church he
[1:04:48] says
[1:04:50] Peter saw the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:54] he was the only one who recognized him
[1:04:58] when Jesus said who do men say that I am
[1:05:04] Peter was the only one who could stand
[1:05:07] up and say thou art the Christ
[1:05:11] Peter didn't have a problem
[1:05:18] that the Gentiles didn't live like the
[1:05:21] Jews
[1:05:23] Peter didn't have an issue seeing Marcus
[1:05:31] Peter didn't have a problem
[1:05:34] seeing all these things that were
[1:05:36] happening outside of himself
[1:05:41] Peter when when Jesus came to Peter
[1:05:44] Jesus and Jesus said Peter Pedro Do You
[1:05:49] Love Me Mamas and and Peter said well
[1:05:53] Lord of yes I do
[1:05:56] and Jesus said feed my sheep
[1:06:00] Peter didn't have a problem seeing Jesus
[1:06:05] Jesus but I want you to notice that
[1:06:08] Jesus is constantly working with Peter
[1:06:10] for something
[1:06:11] Jesus
[1:06:16] is constantly trying to get Peter is
[1:06:22] to capture something that Peter just
[1:06:25] can't do
[1:06:29] you see Peter could recognize Jesus
[1:06:34] but what Peter had trouble doing
[1:06:38] was recognizing Peter's position in
[1:06:42] Jesus
[1:06:46] Peter had trouble recognizing Christ's
[1:06:50] position in Peter
[1:06:53] say that again Christ's position in
[1:06:55] Peter
[1:06:58] he could see everything outside of
[1:07:01] himself
[1:07:03] he could see the wars and the rumors of
[1:07:06] wars
[1:07:08] he could see all the issues going on in
[1:07:10] the church
[1:07:13] he could see all the different things
[1:07:15] that were happening around Jesus
[1:07:19] and around himself
[1:07:21] but when it came down to it
[1:07:26] and he had to stand up for Jesus
[1:07:33] why okay
[1:07:36] Peter could recognize Jesus
[1:07:39] the question wasn't do I know who Jesus
[1:07:42] is
[1:07:45] Jesus because Peter knew that
[1:07:50] Peter couldn't grasp Pedro
[1:07:53] the most important question of Peter's
[1:07:56] life
[1:07:59] who was Peter
[1:08:02] he knew who Jesus was Jesus
[1:08:06] but he couldn't recognize Peter
[1:08:09] a Pedro he got on Mount Transfiguration
[1:08:14] he said let's build a let's build a
[1:08:17] temple one for the three the one for the
[1:08:19] three or is it
[1:08:21] and then he struggled and we we know how
[1:08:24] he struggled there
[1:08:26] and he was constantly you see throughout
[1:08:29] Peter's life
[1:08:33] and he's struggling
[1:08:36] to find Peter Pedro
[1:08:40] and and on the on the flip side of Peter
[1:08:45] we we find Paul
[1:08:48] and Paul what what made Paul so
[1:08:51] tremendous
[1:08:54] what was that Paul understood something
[1:08:57] that Peter didn't foreign
[1:09:06] that there's a lesson there's an
[1:09:08] important thing
[1:09:11] that must happen in the life of every
[1:09:14] believer
[1:09:20] Paul understood it
[1:09:23] and Paul grasped it
[1:09:26] just like King David did
[1:09:29] and and what Paul
[1:09:32] I understood
[1:09:34] Paul understood that
[1:09:37] in in the life of a Believer
[1:09:42] the moment that religion enters the
[1:09:46] picture
[1:09:50] the life of a Believer the more the
[1:09:53] moment that that religious aspect enters
[1:09:56] into it
[1:10:00] the first thing that happens
[1:10:03] is the focus is
[1:10:09] immediately changes
[1:10:13] when Peter saw malcus
[1:10:17] the first thing that happened
[1:10:21] his Focus changed foreign
[1:10:53] and that's the thing that happens yes
[1:10:57] in the mind and in the heart of a lot of
[1:11:00] people
[1:11:02] it's our Focus begins to be changed
[1:11:08] our Focus becomes Out There
[1:11:13] Our Focus becomes our brother
[1:11:18] our Focus becomes our sisters
[1:11:22] our Focus becomes the issues of the
[1:11:24] church
[1:11:27] our Focus becomes what the pastor's
[1:11:29] doing or not doing
[1:11:33] our Focus becomes is the ministry right
[1:11:36] or not
[1:11:39] but I want you to notice something
[1:11:42] I want you to notice
[1:11:45] because the Bible
[1:11:48] the Bible tells us
[1:11:50] the Bible speaks to us and it gives us
[1:11:53] the the answer to the problem
[1:11:56] First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:12:02] verse 28 if you turn with me
[1:12:07] foreign
[1:12:14] but let every man
[1:12:19] examine everyone and everything around
[1:12:23] him
[1:12:28] amen amen
[1:12:31] but let a man examine what's going on
[1:12:34] all around and what's happening
[1:12:39] but let a man examine what my neighbor's
[1:12:42] doing wrong
[1:12:45] but let a man examine where I've got it
[1:12:49] right and you've got it wrong
[1:12:55] no
[1:12:58] let him every man examine himself
[1:13:02] he said
[1:13:13] and you see that's what made Paul so
[1:13:17] tremendous
[1:13:19] is because Paul understood
[1:13:24] of examining himself
[1:13:28] you see Peter came to Paul and they had
[1:13:30] a showdown
[1:13:33] and Peter said you know those Gentiles
[1:13:35] that you're talking about
[1:13:39] they're dogs they're not worth you
[1:13:42] giving them this message
[1:13:48] they're not circumcised they don't
[1:13:50] follow the laws
[1:13:53] and Paul turns to Peter
[1:13:56] and he looks at Peter Pedro and all Paul
[1:14:00] can do is shake his head is
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:32] can't comprehend
[1:15:01] and Paul goes into the book of Romans
[1:15:03] chapter seven
[1:15:06] oh and and Paul begins to dig deep
[1:15:11] and I imagine here in this chapter
[1:15:15] that Paul goes by himself somewhere
[1:15:20] because Paul has to examine himself
[1:15:26] he's gotta check himself
[1:15:30] and he begins to look at the law Empire
[1:15:34] and he says is the Lost sin they say
[1:15:39] he said I I didn't know sin you know
[1:15:43] except for the law
[1:15:45] and and and because of the law
[1:15:49] it brought out all these attributes I
[1:15:52] didn't even know were there
[1:15:57] so is the law of sinuses
[1:16:01] and then Paul catches himself
[1:16:04] and he says God forbid oh can you know
[1:16:08] because you can't live without the law
[1:16:13] because the law is what keeps
[1:16:17] the law is what keeps us
[1:16:20] it's like the bumpers you ever played
[1:16:22] bumper bowling
[1:16:25] right
[1:16:26] there's a big wide Lane in the middle
[1:16:29] line
[1:16:30] but the law is what keeps us out of the
[1:16:33] gutter they don't me
[1:17:08] he's just he's grinding at the Mill
[1:17:11] right now
[1:17:15] and then that as Paul begins to reflect
[1:17:18] interest reflection and he begins to
[1:17:21] look deep inside of himself
[1:17:25] he finds the two laws
[1:17:29] the law for the inward man
[1:17:33] the law for the outward man
[1:17:37] but notice in all of Paul's teachings
[1:17:42] Paul is looking inwardly
[1:17:47] his focus is inwardly always
[1:17:51] King David do this
[1:17:54] Psalms 139
[1:17:57] and he says search me oh God
[1:18:01] no my heart I pray
[1:18:05] see if there be some Wicked way in me
[1:18:11] see Lord God if I'm missing it somewhere
[1:18:14] meet us in your seats
[1:18:17] and you can see King David after
[1:18:20] committing all of these sins that he had
[1:18:23] done
[1:18:26] and he begins to notice
[1:18:30] as he looks inside of himself
[1:18:35] and he sees his flaws
[1:18:38] then he writes the Psalms
[1:18:41] and he praises the Lord
[1:18:46] How I Love You
[1:18:48] Lord how I thank you
[1:18:52] but it's a different perspective
[1:18:59] as opposed to an outward Focus
[1:19:03] brother Branham
[1:19:05] makes the statement
[1:19:10] and he says
[1:19:12] the sickest body this is
[1:19:16] the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:23] but I want you to notice something so
[1:19:26] tremendous
[1:19:28] is because
[1:19:30] when we say that
[1:19:33] the first thing that we think
[1:19:36] the sickest body is the body of the lord
[1:19:43] it's the first thing that happened
[1:19:47] but what if we flipped it
[1:19:50] and what have I said is he illegal the
[1:19:53] sickest body
[1:19:57] is
[1:20:00] this body of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:03] Christ right what if I flip that and I
[1:20:06] said my body is the sickest body this is
[1:20:11] and that's what we find Paul here yes
[1:20:16] First Corinthians chapter 15.
[1:20:23] and Paul here we always read the last
[1:20:26] bit of this scripture
[1:20:29] and we never read the whole scripture
[1:20:33] First Corinthians 15 and 31.
[1:20:39] and it reads like this
[1:20:41] the whole scripture
[1:20:45] Paul says I protest
[1:20:50] he opens it up with I protest
[1:20:56] by your rejoicing
[1:20:59] for La Gloria which I have in Christ
[1:21:02] Jesus our lord
[1:21:10] and and and
[1:21:12] we get and we focus on that last part
[1:21:16] and and we'll we'll get that last part
[1:21:19] and we'll say I remember the day that I
[1:21:22] died
[1:21:25] and it's tremendous right there's a
[1:21:28] there's a day that I die yesterday
[1:21:31] and my question to that is
[1:21:39] because we put it out a lot of times
[1:21:43] as though the day I died was the
[1:21:45] summation of all the Death
[1:21:48] where I go the summation of all the
[1:21:51] Death it was it was it was everything
[1:21:56] but Paul understood this Republic and he
[1:22:00] said no no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:22:01] ah no no I protest
[1:22:04] I protest your protest because every day
[1:22:09] if I'm doing this right
[1:22:14] day I'm examining myself
[1:22:18] and I'm discovering something new I have
[1:22:22] to die yes
[1:22:26] he said I protest you rejoicing because
[1:22:30] don't Rejoice because you think I'm
[1:22:33] tremendous
[1:22:36] the secret is simply this is
[1:22:40] each day I examine my life
[1:22:45] and each day when I find an attribute of
[1:22:48] myself
[1:22:51] that is against the word
[1:22:54] I then
[1:22:58] I
[1:23:03] take care of tomorrow
[1:23:10] and when Paul catches that
[1:23:14] he looks at that situation
[1:23:17] and he looks at that thought process
[1:23:20] and then we find brother Branham
[1:23:24] and brother Branham talks about the body
[1:23:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:30] and we are the body of the Lord
[1:23:33] and brother Branham says
[1:23:43] to live in Jesus Christ
[1:23:47] so we can't we all talk about wanting to
[1:23:51] live in Heavenly places
[1:23:55] according to the prophet of the age
[1:23:58] we've got to repentance and Die daily
[1:24:04] before
[1:24:06] antis
[1:24:07] before we can live in Heavenly places
[1:24:12] we can't even get there
[1:24:16] unless every day we're willing
[1:24:21] that's the problem with the microwave
[1:24:24] generation
[1:24:27] that's the problem with the Easy Bake
[1:24:29] Oven generation it says
[1:24:33] that's the problem with this generation
[1:24:37] is that nobody
[1:24:40] wants to do the hard stuff
[1:24:45] nobody wants to do the hard thing
[1:24:50] the easy thing
[1:24:52] it's for me to look at the brother
[1:24:55] I'd say oh I can see where he's missing
[1:24:58] it
[1:25:00] you know why I can see that
[1:25:03] because that's maybe one thing in my
[1:25:06] life I'm doing right because
[1:25:09] that's the easy thing is
[1:25:13] look at the brothers look at they're
[1:25:15] listening to the tapes oh yeah let's get
[1:25:17] on they're this or that or whatever the
[1:25:19] situation is that's the easy thing
[1:25:25] but the hard thing
[1:25:28] the hard thing
[1:25:32] is to examine myself
[1:25:36] because I have to look in the mirror of
[1:25:39] God's word
[1:25:41] and this mirror does not lie
[1:25:46] this mirror does not lie
[1:25:49] this mirror is the truth of the word
[1:25:53] and it will uncover you guys all of my
[1:25:57] junk
[1:25:58] but I gotta be man lady enough
[1:26:03] just stand in front of this mirror
[1:26:07] [Applause]
[1:26:09] and just let it tear me the shreds
[1:26:13] let it tear me up
[1:26:17] but that's the hard thing
[1:26:21] that's the difficult Road
[1:26:25] that's the higher way
[1:26:31] it's easy to point out each other's
[1:26:33] faults and flaws is
[1:26:39] it's easy to look at all the things
[1:26:41] going on in the world and go oh that's
[1:26:42] such a terrible thing is
[1:26:50] it's easy to see maybe somebody doesn't
[1:26:53] get healed or receive something
[1:26:58] and the first question we ask is what's
[1:27:01] going on in the church
[1:27:05] but that's not the question we should be
[1:27:08] asking
[1:27:10] the question we should be asking is
[1:27:17] where am I
[1:27:20] where am I planted
[1:27:23] have I examined my life in the world
[1:27:28] did I die to something I discovered
[1:27:31] today
[1:27:34] have I repented
[1:27:36] and I made things right
[1:27:39] am I living right
[1:27:42] because if we spend more time doing that
[1:27:45] foreign
[1:27:51] to look outside of ourselves
[1:27:56] if we make ourselves
[1:28:01] that piece of the temple temple and that
[1:28:05] peace is so perfect yes
[1:28:07] that not even a razor blade can fit in
[1:28:10] between
[1:28:12] that if God be for us
[1:28:16] if God be for me he uses the comigo then
[1:28:20] where are all my miracles
[1:28:32] you have to repent and Die daily
[1:28:40] let a man examine himself
[1:28:45] let us
[1:28:47] examine ourselves
[1:28:50] on a daily basis
[1:28:53] Moment by momento
[1:28:56] an hour is too long to let it go
[1:29:00] two hours is too long to let it go
[1:29:04] every minute of every day
[1:29:09] the Bible says you'll hear of wars and
[1:29:12] rumors of wars
[1:29:16] my question is why do we care
[1:29:21] why do we care what happens in politics
[1:29:24] important
[1:29:27] why do we care what happens in the stock
[1:29:28] market
[1:29:32] oh there's a recession coming why do I
[1:29:34] care
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:36] because if I've examined myself or
[1:29:39] because
[1:29:40] then every promise in this book
[1:29:44] it don't matter how long it takes to get
[1:29:47] here
[1:29:49] it don't matter what hell I gotta pass
[1:29:52] through no important
[1:29:55] because every promise in this book
[1:29:58] is
[1:30:00] Mia every chapter
[1:30:05] every line Catalina and there's no devil
[1:30:09] in hell no idea that's gonna take it
[1:30:12] away from us
[1:30:16] Glory
[1:30:18] forgive me my phone said it was time
[1:30:25] let's spend our time examining ourselves
[1:30:30] let's spend our time finding out and
[1:30:34] making sure yes
[1:30:37] that we're perfect it's almost
[1:30:39] perfectness because brother Ron Ronnie
[1:30:43] if I'm
[1:30:45] Perfecto if I'm doing it right
[1:30:49] it's gonna heal my brother
[1:30:55] God bless you you live indigo
[1:31:20] amen God bless this word can you please
[1:31:22] stand
