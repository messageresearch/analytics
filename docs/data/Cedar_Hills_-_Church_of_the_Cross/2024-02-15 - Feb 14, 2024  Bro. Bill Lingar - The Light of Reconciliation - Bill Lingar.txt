think my daughter is streaming in and then a dear sister I know uh up in South Carolina invited her to stream in tonight as well so this is my second time to ever preach in New [Music] Mexico I'm 73 years old the first time I was like maybe 25 something like that and this precious brother name Tommy Perez he invited me to New Mexico to Camp Thunderbird to preach so today I had lunch with two of his beloved sons that God has used to bless you he helped you a lot so we're honored and we're privileged to be with you tonight Wednesday night I know school work and everything tomorrow so we'll go right to the scriptures thank you for welcoming me we're glad to be here we've come to meet with the Lord Jesus Christ a scripture that's very familiar Matthew chapter 6 and or Matthew 5 I'm sorry Matthew [Music] 5 I write it down yes Matthew 5:16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven I'm going to set my timer and so I have another scripture to read but this is very familiar and Jesus he's commanding us to let our light shine but there's only one light of the world and that's the Lord Jesus Christ so if we're going to let our light shine we have to reflect him to make this written word live before the people and so my question tonight is if we let our light shine what impact will it have what is the outcome of this life and Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 5 and 16 say 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 16 he describes the impact of the light shining through you so he says in verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh ye though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth we know him no more we knew him by the blood now we know him by the Holy Spirit according to the truth therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old old things are passed away behold all things are become new that's right and all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us the ministry of re he's given us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that means to witness to witness that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their transpress trans PR trespasses unto them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation then Paul says now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us be ye reconciled to By Us in Christ's deed we become his light of reconciliation that's the impact of letting your light shine it becomes a witness that you've been reconciled to Christ by his cross and now it's time to shine your light by your cross Paul gives us a great example of what he means by reconciliation in the third chapter of second Corinthians this is profound I never saw this until about the third time I had preached this message and then I saw this scripture and let's just read it to you and then you can you can savor it in your soul second uh Second Corinthians second chapter verse 10 here's the example of reconciliation to whom ye forgive anything to whom you forgive something huh to whom you forgive anything the messenger said I forgive it also and then he goes on to say for if I forgave anything to whom I forgave it for your sakes I forgave it in the person yeah W I was in leth and the pastor the next day said Why'd You Come here and before I get answer he said to work right I said yes they cut the emotion I love the Lord and I love his people to whom you forgave anything the messenger to the age stood in the Gap in the person of Christ and said I forgive it all is there something you want forgiven tonight is there something you'd like forgiven tonight you know in your heart what it is then take it before the Lord but if there's something you want forgiven is there somebody you also can forgive let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for the grace of God to forgive us of our sins and our trespasses we might stand before you very soon without a spot without a blemish Snow White Lord I have no grudges I may have been hurt I may have suffered but Lord I hold no grudges and I forgive all thank you Lord for forgiving me in Jesus name so we're speaking on the light of reconciliation and it's to witness that God was in Christ reconciling me a hippie that's what I was reconcile me a hippie to the light and now that he's in me he's given me the ministry of reconciliation that I can Shine the Light That Power of the cross to bring reconciliation for those who need it reconciliation means to remove the barrier remove the barrier between two or more persons something caused a separation an attitude a word or a it caused a separation you say well I wasn't wor I didn't do anything for that what did he what did you do that he had to go to the cross for you so it's something that causes a separation it's a barrier that breaks the relationship between God and man and man and man right we know in the old Temple under the old Ministry of the law there was a veil and Paul called it the middle wall of partition it was a barrier it separated the Jews from the light of eternal life and it not only separated the Jews from the light of eternal life but it separated the Gentiles and the Jews from fellowship and the Jews in their eyes they were righteous yes sir they had the law they had circumcision they had the religion they had a shadow of good things to come and when he came they couldn't recognize him am he was in the temple that could make reconciliation between God and man and so because they were blinding him Paul came to this conclusion we've all sinned we've all sin and we've all come short of the light of his sh [Applause] Glory right so let him without sin tonight as the first stone and we know why we were separated from God this message tells us the original sin like no other messenger told us this message tells us it was the life of blood it was Satan's life through the blood that comes from the sexual seed by the LIE he told Eve he opened the door to enter into the human race and that became the old creation and that seed brought forth with what you see today Satan's eeden and so it was the life of the blood that broke our relationship with our father so it had to be the life of his own blood amen the life of his own the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that could make reconciliation that could rent The Veil tear down the middle wall partition veil of Darkness over my heart to let that light shine in and I'm so thankful tonight to say I'm a Child of Light and I'm on my way to a child of the day but that's another message but Paul made the distinction because when the daylight shines there's no more Shadows there's no more anything from the old creation we're shining in the light of his glory body like his own glorious body the complete reconciliation from the old creation to the new creation by that glorious Royal seed of ab amen so Jesus he said if I the son of man be lifted up then you'll know that I am he and the Greek doesn't say you'll know that I am he the Greek says you'll know that I am and I am that light burning bush down and anointed Moses you'll know that I am and someday and it's this day there is a people that know that I am it's going to fulfill the scripture that Jesus said where I am you're going to be Al so the cross is the light of reconciliation you know for years I looked at the the classic uh license plate of New Mexico the one with the sun side and race and I was mystified by it because I know there was Native Indians originally in in in New Mexico and I thought that that was a symbol of something of the the heritage of the natives but today my eyes were open that symbol is the cross it's the light of the Cross is the light of the Son of God shining in New Mexico the light of [Music] reconciliation now before we go any further I want to place this every child that is born of the light every member that's a member of the body of light they have a part in the ministry of reconciliation every Child of Light every member of the body of light you have a part in the ministry of reconciliation you are called by Jesus to shine your light so that they can see the power of the Cross shining to them and brother brandom said it like this the the samna church age and every person in the church has an individual Ministry and that individual Ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Jesus Christ amen amen that's right whether you're a young person middle AG or a senior like me yes if you are born of the light you are called to the ministry of reconciliation now we know that we all don't have the same position in the body of Christ it's brother Caleb's call his position is the pastor and so he's shining the light in a way that you or I may not be called to shine but there's not two or three different lengths there's one light there's one Lord Jesus Christ there's one Holy Ghost and by his blood we are all walking in the light and so I'm I'm coming to this by his cross we become the light can you say Amen by your cross you shine the light that's where we're coming to by his cross we Shine the Light we become the light and by his cross we Shine the Light I shine the light now watch Jesus said when the son of man is lifted up crucified on the cross you'll know that I am now let me just drop this in the son of man is this picture right here okay now why did he have to say the son of man because the pillar of fire could not die the pillar of fire could not [Applause] bleed but when the word became flesh as these son of man then there was a blood produced and MDC The Living Word he became the bleeding word for you and for me you've heard the term the bleeding word Saul said Lord Lord who are you I'm Jesus hallelujah hallelujah Jesus Hallelujah Jehovah became Jehovah Gyra and Paul's eyes became open and the veil of the law fell off and he began to shine the New Testament the grace of God to see how we are made righteous by faith in this light amen so he says when I'm lifted up you'll know that I am and The Great I Am is the light that appeared in the burning bush and it anointed Moses to be the light of reconciliation he was the light of reconciliation to Israel in Egypt to remove the barrier Pharaoh between them and the promised land and when that light of reconciliation begin to shine it begin to shine in the power of The Great I Am it takes power the power of the blood the power of the Holy Ghost to bring a deliverance and remove the barriers in your life word only will not do it right so Pharaoh saw the plagues and Israel saw the token they saw the Lamb's Blood on the door and that was their light of reconciliation where they could pass from Death to life and we know that was in animals blood and that blood was foreshadowing that The Great I Am was going to come down on the Jordan River R amen and incarnate himself in Jesus Christ as the son of man to anoint him as the light of reconciliation amen amen now it's moving from the shadow of good things to come into the positive and whereas Paul had them put Blood on the door when this lamb shed his blood the veil to our heart was rent and the door to the light of the Holy Ghost was open and we pass from the condemnation of the law into the light of eternal life whereby we are judged in the sight of God why because I came through my father's Blood by his seed yes his SE royaly new creation and henceforth I not only know him by the blood but I know him as The Great I Am and just give me a little bit of time for God's plan and someday I also will be able to manifest I am that I am what what is it it's an amateur God Moses went down there as an amateur God right so now here's where we go a little deeper I was preaching in Malawi recently in December and the pastor's son who's a minister he was saying brother we're talking you know you're going deep and I reminded him that brother Branham said in in the 50s the real deep spiritual Revelation the church is still blind to the church is still blind to he said that in the 50s you can find it on tape and then he proceeded to say but God has placed the gifts of the minister into the church like a teacher in that in order to teach you these things and so what age are we living in what message are we preaching Ezekiel Saw the water and it was up to the ankles and then he saw some to the knees and then he saw some to the waste and then he saw a river that only the rainbow trout can swim in why would you you want just that much of the Holy Ghost when this is the age when the fullness is being poured out upon the rainbow trout pcatt fish PC okay don't get excited I'm only in kindergarten no no the rainbow trout they're the ones that can swim in the deep water so we're only bringing out the light of the age and we realize and your pastor knows this he has some that's to the ankles some to the knees some to the waist and that's why we have to be patient with one another like God is patient with me is God patient with you then can you be patient with one another right and so what is this light that's in us he talked about this light very specifically and he said this in Revelations chapter 4 number two that great Jewel what was it it was perfect it was at the age of 33 and A2 years old when God put it through the big bumping machine when he took it over there and he began to shape it up he cut it he mashed it he bruised it he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed what did God do to that perfect man there's only one of them in the world did you hear that there's only one of them in the world only one in the world and that was him let me pause there is only one man that ever was born of a woman that will ever be born of a woman that was perfect picture was right up there man's head of Christ this is important he's the only man that was born perfect sir he was that new creation and what did God do to that perfect man God chiseled him off he was wounded for our transgression because I was a sinner he let the rainbow light of his seven Church ages flash upon me because I was a sinner he let the rainbow light of his seven Church ages flash upon me this is not a symbol this is not a metaphor this is the light that Jesus said he wants us to shine because I was a sinner he let the rainbow light of his seven Church ages flashes upon me to know that he was wounded for my transgression my transgression this hippie this long haired hippie sin didn't have a chance the devil's life was in me and it was controlling me but God fora I would love [Applause] him amen somebody touch me must have been that Angel of the Lord now now I'm I'm getting lost where am I at Lord okay all right so you see it's a let your light shine you have to become the light in that perfect man he was born perfect to live a perfect life to become a perfect sacrifice so he could shine that rainbow light upon my soul so by his cross I became the rainbow light and now by my cross you're going to see the rainbow light the first Exodus Moses was the light of reconciliation amen or amen second but that was the blood of a natural lamb second Exodus the light came down into a man born perfect sh by God's blood to rip the veil and open the door to your heart to let the Life of Christ come in but now we're in the third exod no matter how many denominational barriers through the seven Church ages and Satan put up a lot did he not he put them up and had us Bound in a way that we didn't even know but no matter how many denominational barriers no matter how many Traditions has separated man from God's promise and one another all those Oneness in the trinity they couldn't Fellowship why because the leaders wouldn't let them Fellowship it's the same today because Satan is still here still the prince of the power of the a but Jesus is here also and he wants to prove greater is he that is in me than he that is in them the light of reconciliation I don't don't care what you believe you're my brother you're my S sister and if you're wrong Let Me Shine the Light of reconciliation I could tell you a story of my of a young man that's 16 year old back there say this he fellowships with the brandom Tabernacle he fellowships with the brandom Tabernacle the Youth of his age and he also fellowships at the church of the open door those youth and someone says to him why are you going over there he says have you been there he says no he says have you heard the pastor preach he said no he said then be quiet you don't know what you're talking about I thought that was a good answer that's a denominational spirit that wants to divide and wants to separate Jews amen because of what I believe and where I go to Worship in the temple I'm better than you there's only one mark that distinguishes what you are and what your claims are and it's the new birth and it doesn't come where you Fellowship it comes by the cross and the Holy Ghost and I got it in my room at home the only way you'll stand in this evil age against all the powers that are moving in against us by being born again by the light of reconciliation otherwise reasoning with the message will not cut it that's why they start and go oh look at this well where did Brother BR do this question to me settled I've been calary I've died to myself Holy Ghost came I know in whom I believe right and I won't be judged by where I Fellowship I'll be judged whether I'm walking in the light or not if you're walking in the light as he is in the light that rainbow light it shows that you've come through the blood of Jesus Christ and we can Fellowship one with another because who are we anyway Sinn sa by [Applause] grace so no matter how many denominational Spirits God had a promise that it shall be light in the evening time and the evening light promised the sun was going to come out in the evening time no matter how many denominational barriers and do you know what he said about this light he said it's reflecting the cross it's on tape souls in prison time this light is reflecting the cross through who the messenger of the age I in Christ forgive you it's reflecting through the messenger of the age to bring reconciliation to break down the denominational barriers by breaking open the Seven Seals and letting the total light of reconciliation shine into our heart so that we can see what the token not not a lamb's not an animal blood not the earnest of the spirit but the token the fullness of the life of Jesus Christ shining through a man born perfect made perfect born perfect made to show we're in the age St of perfect man the light of our complete reconciliation preach this one place and they were texting the pastor is he saying brother brandom's flesh I told them that wasn't it he was reflecting faith virtue knowledge Brotherly Love Stone of perfection it wasn't his flesh that was perfect are you with me it wasn't his flesh that was it was the life it was the life that was perfect through the seven Church ages they only saw a half a rainbow the church only had the earnest of their reconciliation amen amen they saw half a rainbow they saw the earnest of reconciliation but in this day we see the complete circle complete rainbow of lightting through a man perfect the token the token to separate you from the world and denominations so that you can not only become the light but walk in the light back to the pillar of fire that where I am you'll be it's deep but it's true and I rejoice in this that I've been chosen to live in this age to see this Marvelous Light well why do you speak of brother random why that man now I'm getting off my text I need to get back I want to say this God has a plan of redemption and it's his it's not mine he chooses his Moses he chooses his Elijah Isaiah he's G the Baptist you have no choice that's his choice the choice is will you accept what I extend to you for your reconciliation and me I'm happy I'm thankful hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallu the Third Exodus Elijah a redeemed man aren't you glad to be living in the age where you see for Amos 37 he won't change his ways he won't change his system he Tak a prophet and he's showing you the light of complete reconciliation when he went into the pillar of fire and came out he was Snow White and that's exactly how the father saw you and me before the foundation the world let us hurry by his cross you are reconciled to the light by my cross I Shine the Light of reconciliation by his cross he suffered my wrongs so he could forgive me and forget about it so I could be right Now by my cross can I suffer your wrongs so that you can see what this rainbow light is I'm going to bring it to you that you might be right that whatever those barriers are whether it be family barriers friend barriers Church barriers whatever the barriers are that's separating relationship or separating Fellowship the blood of Jesus Christ reconciles it all I talked to a sister one time and about the situation she was in with her husband trying to bring reconciliation and she said but brother L there's a there's a heap of of stuff there I said what about your HEAP of stuff that he forgave reconciliation is a process there's seven steps it took seven steps to bring a man back into the pillar of Fire but if you'll listen to your pastor he will help you he will help you make those steps but you can't be listening to this one and this one and that one and that one they'll become barriers yeah I'm off my ground I'm on the pastor's ground all right I'm at 48 minutes repent and sin no more a lot of some people understands all right by his cross I became the rainbow light now by my cross I Shine the rainbow light now young people listen by his cross you die only once to sin one time for all time you die to sin but by my cross I Die daily okay now understand this because Satan will use your ignorance of the scriptures against you I die once to sin and the light of God shines in the rainbow light but where I have to Die daily is in my spirit in my mind in my spirit in my mind the battle comes between light and darkness because you're in the world of Darkness but I'm not of the darkness and my flesh it's still a cocko burl and your flesh is still a cocko burel and your flesh will get you in trouble make you have to apologize I didn't mean to say that brother k I didn't mean to say that brother Tommy I didn't mean it you can hear on tape brother B says I misspoke I said that in the flesh I didn't mean that because he saw the way it was being taken so the inside is light and that light illuminates your spirit your mind your spirit is the wick that has to be trimmed and cleared every day so when I die daily it's not my soul that's dying it's in my spirit I'm fighting this battle and that rainbow light as it looks into the word and hears the message of the hour and I pray and I groan and I travail and sometimes I have to fast Lord I'm serious desate I'm fighting this battle and I want the light to shine in this mind amen and so you'll die daily so if you're born of the light don't let him tell you different because he hit you with the darkness in the mind you can't go anywhere without seeing the darkness you you can't check the news without hearing the darkness yes and we know it's chaos it's confusion it's disillusion Satan has them in fear but we're not being Anointed with fear we're we're being Anointed with the Victorious light reconciliation so that I can cast down the lies he's telling me he's telling me lies the only he wants to talk to me about was my hippie days he wants to talk to me about the old book he wants to bring it to memory he wants to bring the scars and the pain but the truth is the old book is gone amen it was cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness and God does not see me as the old creation he does not see as the old creation he sees me white as snow in my theophany how he sees me and when that light comes into you that's what he wants you to see keep your eyes on that so yes we die daily and that's why your prayer life is so important your quiet time is so important reading your Bible is so important hearing the message God will direct you to hear just what you need to hear but then Hezekiah and Isaiah Satan threatened them Satan threatened them I'm going to do this to you and I'm going to do this to you I did this to them I did this to them and Hezekiah and Isaiah they went to prayer they went to prayer and they did something else they cried to the Lord they cried to the Lord I'm not saying you have to have Bo boohoo maybe you a boohoo there gring and prevailing Lord Do You Hear What that devil said here's what your word say 55 minutes but I can ask for Grace I just thought of that but I will ask let me look when I die daily so the light of reconciliation can shine what is it that actually shines what is it that actually brings down the barrier of those attitudes those words those deeds it's this it's his faith his virtue his knowledge Temperance his patience his godliness and his brotherly kindness that's the light of reconcil how many times have you saw a situation mom and dad you knew a situation in the family there's barriers and it breaks your heart it breaks your heart right and so you're praying and you're crying and you're agonizing yeah Lord I want deliverance and one day the knowledge the knowledge of the Holy Ghost he quickens to you this is the root cause of the situation and she gets up and she says honey honey the Lord revealed it to me I know the answer and the husband says he still be quiet Temperance Temperance you may have the answer the lord gave you the answer but it's not time to say something it's not the right place to say something so you have to have Temperance with your knowledge well when when are we going to say something this is tearing me apart patience patience wait on God wait on his time that demon was was was persecuting and Paul and saying these men are men of God and Paul didn't say nothing one day when you're not even conscious you're going to find yourself in the situation and the Lord's going to say this is the time this is the place now humbly Softly whatever you know I just been thinking of this and just drop it in that's the light of reconciliation that's what I'm talking about so your cross is there causing you pain they causing you a financial loss right they they did you wrong you did them right they did you wrong and and all kinds of things right it creates barriers to Fellowship barriers to relationship and it's painful but in order for you to shine the light of reconciliation the power of the blood of Jesus Christ the power of the Holy Ghost is to express these Seven Virtues amen that's right there 59 minutes I don't have to ask Grace yet but let's come to the close thank you brother Caleb I I enjoyed myself being here God bless you richly we're going to two son for Sunday service pray for me I understand the Pastor's going to Poland tring Grace and God's mercy let's close with this so five minutes past one hour is Grace okay all right here we go what motivates a born again Christian to endure hardness as a good soldier of the cross what motivates you to do that the reason is you are [Applause] anointed for a kingly position now listen Okay the reason is I am anointed for a kingly position I have a promise in Revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh will sit in my Throne amen amen I will sit in his throne as he sat in his father's throne and where did he sit inside the pillar of fire we have a promise the light has struck my heart now I'm walking in faith in virtue in knowledge in Temperance in patience in godliness in brotherly kindness and I want to be caught up like sunset Mountain and enter into that Glory cloud and to be placed in a kingly position where the Prophet said Lord what does this mean and something struck his hand the king's sword Revelations 3:21 being Vindicated before our very eyes because God will do nothing until he first shows it by that man there so you're anointed for a kingly position and and so that's why why we suffer and God foreshadowed it by David David was the Good Shepherd and he put his life on the line for his sheep his father's sheep and God had Samuel the prophet anoint David for a kingly position are you with me he had Samuel the prophet anointed for a kingly position before he could pour the oil on him he had to call David so he sacrificed the blood and he called David and when he sacrifice the blood of Jesus for you he called you to anoint you for your kingly position it's called the spirit of adoption it's called the Peter called it the spirit of Glory if we suffer for him that shows the spirit of Glory is on us and we're predestinated to Glory we're predestinated to adoption we predestinated to the kingly position where you have the kingly authority to speak the word that's what a king position is it's supreme power isn't it there's no greater power than the K and so when God anointed David for his kingly position he did exploits of Faith he conquered the Giants Saul killed his thousands David conquered 10,000 but then what happened did David go to the throne did David become the chief Shepherd of Israel he became a fugitive he became a fugitive he became under severe persecution Saul hated him why did he hate him because the spirit of the devil came on him where does hatred come from it doesn't come from God it's the anointing of the devil and when he hated David he wanted to kill David and so David became a fugitive he became on the run and there's no doubt I'm anointed for a kingly position I'm anointed for a spirit of adoption I'm anointed for that Cloud of Glory and this is happening and that is happening and this is happening and David was flustrated I've been to inti inti in Israel the desert it's hot it's Dr it's Mountain it's red and he's and he's on the run and he's enduring the fiery trials here's Saul a church split and here's the Philistines the world and he's caught between the two that's my life that's your life we're caught between the two and so he's just pursuing him and pursuing him and sa saying Lord what have I done and so one day he had David corner and so the question is in closing why did God permit Saul to persecute David why did God permit it and here's why and here's your answer why you bear your cross to shine the light of reconciliation because kingly power without kingly character is satanic it can't rain kingly power is destructive without the character to control it hmon Amon had the king's signature ring how many knows the story am had the king's signature ring he had the Seal of adoption they call this a high ring of mystery but for me it's not a ring of mystery it's the king's signature ring and he had that ring and what did he do with it he had the character of the devil and he wrote a proclamation to destroy and kill all the Jews but there was a man that was humble his name was Mor and he trained his his like uh Esther to be a queen and not only that but he saved the King's life so he projected the light of reconciliation he projected eternal life so one day when hmon was just about to execute his plan God brought it to the king's mind and he then said what shall be done for the man whom the king Delights to honor and there came the enemy of enemies through the door am amen what shall be done for the man and you know the story oh me and it was Mori he he put the king's ring on Mori now watch The King's word could not be changed the king's word cannot be changed but he took that and he wrote his own declaration amen and he brought Liberty so God permits the trials and the fiery trial so you'll Shine the Light of reconciliation to manifest the character you need enter The Cloud of Glory for the Crown of Glory to Crown the Lord Jesus with a body like his own glorious body and so there it was Saul had David pinned in the cave David had no way out but now the final test was here you'll come to your final test brother and sister and so God steps in and the Spirit of Slumber falls on Saul and his army oh he sleeps like a baby and David's men said David the Lord has delivered your enemy into your hand kill him David here's your chance kill him DAV it was the last test it was The Last Temptation kill him David but David was anointed for a kingly position and David had a kingly character and he said forbid to touch the Lord's anointed prophets no harm no matter whether you agree or not don't touch his anointed His prophets no hard so David takes the the king's sword the king's sword and he cuts a piece of His Garment off and they wake up Lord wakes them up they go out and they start to go and David calls them he says sa sa and he looks and he sees it's David and David waves the king's garment before him and and Saul sees that d David could have killed him and Saul says now I know David you'll be king now I know you'll be king for I rewarded evil for good and you rewarded good for Revelations 3:21 the kingly promise that we see starting to unfold where is it placed in the scriptures at the end of the seven Church ages after Faith virtue knowledge patience godliness kindness then the king of all power perfect love comes down seals it all up that power that ruled in Eden that power that there was no fear in animals there was righteousness there let us [Applause] stand and I ask for [Applause] forgiveness do you know that song open my eyes that I can see Lord if you don't that's okay we can sing another one [Music] okay want to see Jesus and touch him and say that we love you open our ears
