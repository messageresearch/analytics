[58:30] 11th
[58:33] chapter this is just the just the
[58:36] saying I'm not going to go to
[58:38] 11 when you look into the book of he of
[58:41] of Hebrews the 11th
[58:44] chapter and then you you hear the
[58:47] Apostle Paul says what more can I
[58:52] say for the time does not permit me to
[58:57] and then Wednesday and then and then

[59:44] pages I probably could stay an hour in
[59:46] each
[59:48] page but but we're not going to do
[59:51] that Ephesians the 4th chapter and the
[59:54] third verse
[59:57] and I want to entitle the message this
[1:00:02] morning the weight of
[1:00:11] Glory Ephesians the 4th chapter in the
[1:00:14] third verse says
[1:00:17] this endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:00:20] the spirit in the bond of peace

[1:01:22] then God bless you once again
[1:01:28] again I want to entitle our message this
[1:01:31] morning the weight of
[1:01:37] glory and I want to put a subtitle of
[1:01:41] Let Jesus be your
[1:01:47] witness amen uh about two Wednesdays
[1:01:53] ago I had the opportunity to go to to
[1:01:56] hear uh brother brother
[1:02:01] Tim brother
[1:02:03] timis and uh I do want to say he is one
[1:02:08] of the finest teachers that you'll ever
[1:02:10] hear in Malachi
[1:02:14] 4 and I was so grateful to be there with
[1:02:18] with him and and and the
[1:02:21] people God bless them this
[1:02:23] morning and and and this this
[1:02:26] transmission will go around the whole
[1:02:29] world but we're
[1:02:32] grateful that God has given the message
[1:02:35] that he's given us
[1:02:39] today we don't look for another
[1:02:42] message we don't look for another
[1:02:45] messenger we don't we don't look for
[1:02:48] another Doctrine or
[1:02:51] belief we already believe that Elijah
[1:02:53] the prophet Has Come For Us in this day
[1:02:58] and he came to bring us the word of life
[1:03:01] and the message of
[1:03:05] restoration and so upon the basis of
[1:03:08] what we
[1:03:10] believe I am more proud
[1:03:13] today than any day of our
[1:03:17] life because I have accepted the word of
[1:03:22] God and it does not matter what comes
[1:03:25] against us
[1:03:28] the message is the
[1:03:30] truth I don't move from the this
[1:03:34] message the message is the is what will
[1:03:37] take me
[1:03:40] home so while people are out there
[1:03:43] discussing the
[1:03:46] message I want you to live the
[1:03:49] message I want you to be the
[1:03:53] message they're trying to tell you that
[1:03:56] you as the message do not
[1:04:00] exist they're trying to tell you that
[1:04:03] you as the
[1:04:06] message are not
[1:04:08] important they're telling you that your
[1:04:10] existence here this
[1:04:13] morning does not
[1:04:15] matter they're telling
[1:04:18] you that your name does not
[1:04:21] matter and I would have to say maybe my
[1:04:24] name don't matter
[1:04:27] but my name written in the Lamb's Book
[1:04:30] of
[1:04:32] Life and so I take upon the basis of
[1:04:35] what I what I
[1:04:38] believe there are many people that have
[1:04:41] criticized what we
[1:04:43] believe now you know you know the we had
[1:04:47] a dear sister of
[1:04:49] ours that lives in in
[1:04:52] Texas and she called me S it's sister
[1:04:55] Carol Carol and sister Carol and brother
[1:04:59] Ira are one of our great pillars in our
[1:05:01] church
[1:05:04] Carol and we love them with all of our
[1:05:07] hearts but she said that one of her
[1:05:10] brothers had called
[1:05:13] her and told her that brother brandom or
[1:05:17] the message was a
[1:05:21] devil I said thanks be to God
[1:05:26] God for that because they called Jesus
[1:05:30] be all he told
[1:05:33] you was that you what you believe is the
[1:05:37] truth if they called my Lord and
[1:05:42] Savior a devil how much more are they
[1:05:46] going to call
[1:05:48] us well we told
[1:05:51] her we don't
[1:05:53] fight we don't go and and and try to
[1:05:56] change anybody's
[1:05:58] mind but if he ever wanted to come and
[1:06:01] talk to
[1:06:04] somebody we are willing to talk to him
[1:06:06] about anything in this whole message of
[1:06:08] what we
[1:06:11] believe to this day no one's
[1:06:16] called what is this that we
[1:06:20] believe we believe that the Eternal
[1:06:23] thoughts of God
[1:06:27] I want you to get this this
[1:06:29] morning because you you you we we we
[1:06:32] live our
[1:06:34] lives according to what people say about
[1:06:39] us if somebody tells
[1:06:42] us oh you're very
[1:06:45] handsome then you act
[1:06:52] handsome you dress
[1:06:54] better you comb your
[1:06:56] hair you take a
[1:06:59] shower you know why somebody called me
[1:07:03] handsome if somebody calls you
[1:07:06] ugly what do you do well you don't take
[1:07:10] a
[1:07:11] shower you don't brush your
[1:07:13] teeth anyways I'm
[1:07:16] ugly but all of those things is it does
[1:07:20] not matter what people call
[1:07:22] you it matters what God calls you
[1:07:27] and God calls you to be one of his
[1:07:31] elected chosen is
[1:07:35] predestinated he knew you before the
[1:07:37] foundation of the
[1:07:40] world so now we got to act like
[1:07:46] thatall you know for
[1:07:50] years we we've said this and people have
[1:07:54] said this now they they they they they
[1:07:57] have upgraded us from a cult to a
[1:08:04] sect and there's many people around the
[1:08:06] world that will call us a
[1:08:10] cult well that that's their
[1:08:14] opinion you know it's like the man that
[1:08:16] came to my barber shop one
[1:08:20] day and he told me this you know I don't
[1:08:23] believe the Bible
[1:08:27] because scientists have proed have said
[1:08:29] that the Bible was written by
[1:08:34] men my answer to him was
[1:08:37] this you do know that scientists are
[1:08:45] men anybody that tells you what you
[1:08:50] believe is wrong they're also with
[1:08:54] people of opinion
[1:08:57] but I don't care what people's opinions
[1:09:00] are I only care what God has got to tell
[1:09:04] me
[1:09:06] now there's only one
[1:09:09] message that has ever hit the face of
[1:09:12] the
[1:09:14] world that will reveal to you who you
[1:09:17] are in
[1:09:20] Christ they'll tell you what you mean to
[1:09:23] their Church
[1:09:27] so they make you sign a register to your
[1:09:33] church now you are a member of that
[1:09:37] church but I didn't sign my name to be a
[1:09:41] member of a
[1:09:44] church Jesus Christ with his own
[1:09:49] blood T my name into his
[1:09:53] church Hallelujah
[1:09:56] amen praise God all right let's see who
[1:09:58] you believe this
[1:10:00] morning this is the weight of
[1:10:05] Glory I want to say what brother Caleb
[1:10:08] said it's not if we feel the
[1:10:11] responsibility of the
[1:10:15] hour it's how much of that
[1:10:18] responsibility are we willing to take
[1:10:23] on everybody FS the
[1:10:27] responsibility everybody says we must do
[1:10:30] this or
[1:10:32] that but when it comes time for us to do
[1:10:37] it we'll let somebody else do
[1:10:40] it somebody else can preach the
[1:10:44] message somebody else can
[1:10:47] pray somebody else can live the
[1:10:50] life me I'm happy in our
[1:10:53] Pew let me tell you what brother Tim
[1:10:56] told us the other
[1:10:59] day and this really stuck with
[1:11:03] me people that go to
[1:11:06] church hear the
[1:11:09] message and do nothing about
[1:11:13] it are
[1:11:18] idolators where does it come
[1:11:21] from being
[1:11:24] idol being an
[1:11:28] idol this is what this is what has
[1:11:31] happened to the
[1:11:33] message brother brandham lived a
[1:11:36] life he lived a life worthy of the
[1:11:39] Gospel I follow the message I read my
[1:11:44] Bible I'm not taking on any
[1:11:48] responsibility now I listen to brother
[1:11:51] brandham every single
[1:11:54] day I don't don't wait for Sundays or
[1:11:56] Wednesdays to listen to brother
[1:11:59] brand I hear him every
[1:12:02] day that's where we get our Fountain
[1:12:05] that's where we get our
[1:12:07] food that's our Fountain that's our
[1:12:11] life but I am not like people that just
[1:12:14] stay
[1:12:16] home because people that just stay
[1:12:20] home say I don't want to be responsible
[1:12:26] I'm not responsible to
[1:12:29] nobody and in the
[1:12:31] process that nobody is responsible to
[1:12:35] them or for
[1:12:37] them it's easy just
[1:12:41] to I'll uh hear a
[1:12:43] tape and I could be in my
[1:12:47] sweats and I can just just be there and
[1:12:51] and kicking
[1:12:53] back drinking a cup of
[1:12:55] coffee and I'm not making fun of that
[1:12:59] what I'm telling you is this what the
[1:13:02] message makes us
[1:13:04] do it makes us take done the weight of
[1:13:09] Glory oh come on don't make don't make
[1:13:11] me pull it out of you this
[1:13:13] morning it makes you take on a
[1:13:18] responsibility
[1:13:20] now I would rather have thousands
[1:13:25] to say to me at the
[1:13:27] Judgment we heard you
[1:13:30] preach and you heard our
[1:13:35] feelings than to have one lost soul
[1:13:40] say I heard you
[1:13:42] preach but you didn't tell me the
[1:13:47] truth you've heard the truth from behind
[1:13:50] this
[1:13:53] death it has been the whole
[1:13:56] truth and nothing but the
[1:13:59] [Applause]
[1:14:01] truth but when you don't live the life
[1:14:04] of the
[1:14:07] truth it turns us to make us a different
[1:14:13] image than the image of
[1:14:17] God and when we turn into a different
[1:14:20] image than the image of
[1:14:23] God it cuses us to be
[1:14:33] idolators let that just soak in a little
[1:14:38] bit anyways brother brother Tommy senior
[1:14:41] he lived the
[1:14:43] life the ministry lives the
[1:14:46] life I can do anything I want
[1:14:49] to you have not taken on the weight of
[1:14:52] Glory
[1:14:56] it causes us to take
[1:15:00] responsibility we misre represent
[1:15:04] God when we wear his
[1:15:08] name but not his character
[1:15:15] character and let that one soak
[1:15:23] in give me give me the the the the
[1:15:26] stature of a perfect man if you
[1:15:30] would
[1:15:32] okay this is brother brandham
[1:15:35] now and he says
[1:15:37] this and this is a message on
[1:15:42] teaching that ties the man
[1:15:47] in that's going to be Redeemed by the
[1:15:50] blood of the Lord
[1:15:53] Jesus and is going to be in that church
[1:15:58] age that Eternal Church
[1:16:02] age at the end of the
[1:16:05] seals
[1:16:08] okay we had a we had a panel of of uh of
[1:16:12] uh tutors and
[1:16:16] governors and I am so proud of our young
[1:16:20] men that willingly of their own time
[1:16:26] have gone and have gone deep into the
[1:16:31] message they want to make
[1:16:34] sure that they get what they
[1:16:37] need if the Lord perish is
[1:16:41] coming and I I I as we we broach the
[1:16:44] subject this this
[1:16:47] subject of what is the Holy
[1:16:51] Ghost brother brandom and my papa said
[1:16:54] this
[1:16:57] you cannot come and receive the Holy
[1:17:02] Spirit unless you know what it
[1:17:05] is and you cannot receive
[1:17:08] it if you know what it is unless you
[1:17:12] believe it's given to
[1:17:14] you and it's for you and then you cannot
[1:17:18] know if you've got it or
[1:17:21] not unless you know what results
[1:17:27] brings the message will bring results in
[1:17:31] your
[1:17:35] life I told the young lady last
[1:17:39] night quit quit quit listening to the
[1:17:43] devil you know he's

[1:18:06] lying cuz he's the father of
[1:18:11] Lies

[1:18:27] Rock I told the young
[1:18:30] lady you haven't had that episode like

[1:21:09] writer the message was
[1:21:12] lost for want of a
[1:21:15] message the battle was
[1:21:18] lost for want of a
[1:21:22] battle the kingdom was lost
[1:21:26] and
[1:21:26] all for the want of a horse you
[1:21:35] nail I'm brother I'm just an
[1:21:37] insignificant
[1:21:40] nail it doesn't really matter what I
[1:21:44] do take that proverb to
[1:21:47] heart because there is something for
[1:21:50] each and every one of you to do
[1:21:55] but the thing about it is this if I
[1:21:59] can't be the right arm I don't want to
[1:22:01] be
[1:22:05] anything we asked a man one
[1:22:08] time would you would did you do would
[1:22:10] you want to come to
[1:22:13] church his answer to us was
[1:22:16] this and this is a man that's not
[1:22:20] converted he said if I could be the
[1:22:22] pastor I'd go to your
[1:22:23] church
[1:22:25] [Laughter]
[1:22:28] for nobody nobody's interested to be a
[1:22:31] finger
[1:22:34] and do you know what the greatest the
[1:22:37] biggest organ in in your body
[1:22:44] is the
[1:22:46] skin it's the biggest organ in your
[1:22:50] body and nobody wants to be the skin
[1:22:58] if I can't be the
[1:23:00] finger if I can't be an eye if I can't
[1:23:03] be the arm if I can't be the head I
[1:23:07] don't want to be part of
[1:23:11] nothing you still don't know what the
[1:23:14] weight of Glory
[1:23:20] is you see how it's starting
[1:23:22] to but and say
[1:23:26] you start see seeing it come
[1:23:29] down that's what is called the shakina
[1:23:31] glory of
[1:23:33] God and it comes down and it's you you
[1:23:36] feel sometimes a little a
[1:23:40] nered because now you're taking
[1:23:44] responsibility if I believe the
[1:23:46] message I'm responsible to tell
[1:23:51] him but I don't tell him
[1:23:54] because I don't live the
[1:23:56] life and when I don't live the life I
[1:23:59] can't tell him about
[1:24:01] life but if I live the life I will tell
[1:24:05] him what I possess the weight that I
[1:24:10] feel the
[1:24:12] responsibility is mine to transfer you
[1:24:20] life that's the weight of Glory
[1:24:31] now the Jews
[1:24:34] believed that the Tabernacle contained
[1:24:37] the presence of
[1:24:41] God in the
[1:24:44] Torah God is also sometimes described as
[1:24:47] a cloud or a pillar of
[1:24:52] fire this was a symbol of God's presence
[1:24:56] among his
[1:25:00] people some Jews believe that
[1:25:05] shakina refer to the female qualities of
[1:25:12] God there is no
[1:25:16] message there is no leader in this
[1:25:20] world that can prove to you a cloud and
[1:25:23] a pillar of
[1:25:27] fire except us that have received the
[1:25:30] message of

[1:25:39] okay Benny hen don't have that

[1:25:46] that Tommy Osburn doesn't have
[1:25:49] that there is no tell oh I I wish I had
[1:25:53] some message believe here this morning

[1:25:58] television that can even claim that the
[1:26:02] pillar of fire has come to
[1:26:09] them there is nobody that can
[1:26:13] claim that this that they have
[1:26:17] this oh no no no I wish I had some M
[1:26:21] four five Believers I wish I had people
[1:26:24] that really believe the message of the
[1:26:27] hour I wish I had some people that would
[1:26:30] shout and say I am a
[1:26:34] believer
[1:26:36] GL hallelujah praise God oh come on come

[1:26:47] tv nobody has the pillar of
[1:26:50] fire they talk about it but nobody has a
[1:26:55] photograph with the pillar of
[1:26:59] fire nobody has the weight of
[1:27:04] Glory I wish I had
[1:27:07] somebody that would believe the word of
[1:27:10] God and would say I love
[1:27:17] jesusall right here oh people have a lot
[1:27:19] of
[1:27:21] Theology and they'll explain to you
[1:27:23] about all kinds of
[1:27:25] things things that don't
[1:27:29] matter the only thing that should matter
[1:27:32] in your
[1:27:34] life is where my name is written
[1:27:39] at I was chosen in
[1:27:43] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:27:47] world before there was a world before
[1:27:50] there was an atom before there was
[1:27:53] anything
[1:27:55] I existed in the thought of
[1:28:03] God so then when he said let us make
[1:28:09] man he put upon me the
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:18] weight when God said let us make men
[1:28:24] he put upon
[1:28:26] me he put upon
[1:28:28] you the weight the
[1:28:32] responsibility of
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:35] [Applause]

[1:28:40] gotten a good night sleep last
[1:28:43] night You' understood this a little bit
[1:28:47] better but that's all
[1:28:49] right it says this the word says
[1:28:52] this cast your burden on the
[1:28:58] Lord Jesus tells tells his his
[1:29:03] disciples take take my
[1:29:06] yoke take my yoke it's
[1:29:11] easy and my burden is
[1:29:20] light but what do we rather do
[1:29:24] take on the burdens and the cares of the
[1:29:28] world that's what the Apostle Paul
[1:29:31] says seeing that we are
[1:29:35] surrounded by a cloud of
[1:29:38] witnesses let us lay
[1:29:40] aside every weight and the sin that so
[1:29:44] easily besets us and let us run the race
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:55] is this not the fast that I have
[1:30:00] chosen to loose the bonds of
[1:30:05] wickedness to undo the heavy
[1:30:09] burdens to let the oppressed Go
[1:30:13] free and that you break every
[1:30:19] yoke come to
[1:30:21] me all you that labor and are heavy
[1:30:25] lad I will give you
[1:30:29] rest Isaiah
[1:30:32] 41 for I the Lord your God will hold
[1:30:35] your right
[1:30:39] hand saying saying to you fear not I
[1:30:43] will help
[1:30:45] you therefore humble yourselves under
[1:30:48] the mighty hand of
[1:30:52] God that he may exalt you in due
[1:30:57] time casting all your care upon
[1:31:00] him for he cares for
[1:31:03] you bear one another's
[1:31:08] burdens and fulfill the law of
[1:31:12] Christ Deuteronomy the 25th chapter

[1:40:58] [Applause]
[1:41:03] Glory but it still had did not have a

[1:41:09] yet so nobody knew how heavy it
[1:41:14] was nobody knew how much responsibility
[1:41:17] to

[1:42:03] responsibility it was the opening of the
[1:42:07] word it was the third
[1:42:11] pool which was the opening of the
[1:42:16] word it was the responsibility that the

[1:42:40] couch listening to
[1:42:43] something he's out there finding his
[1:42:49] responsibility he's on his
[1:42:51] knees where at
[1:42:54] pit
[1:42:55] Rock when on the pit
[1:42:58] Rock he received the weight of
[1:43:04] majesty it wasn't the sword of a
[1:43:08] king it was the sword of the
[1:43:11] king it was the weight of
[1:43:16] [Applause]
[1:43:19] Glory but nobody knew how heavy it was
[1:43:22] yet not
[1:43:25] because it was just the
[1:43:27] head first
[1:43:31] pool was little
[1:43:33] birds I hope you get it I'm I've got
[1:43:37] about 15
[1:43:38] minutes was little
[1:43:42] birds little
[1:43:44] birds we're happy to see the little
[1:43:46] birds
[1:43:48] right we're
[1:43:50] emotional did you see the birds
[1:43:53] second
[1:43:54] pool was doves were bigger
[1:43:58] Birds was
[1:44:00] doves in other words for you to
[1:44:02] understand
[1:44:03] it they were baptisms of the Holy
[1:44:10] Ghost they were bigger
[1:44:12] Birds they were baptisms of the Holy
[1:44:16] Ghost but the third pool was not little
[1:44:20] birds was not doves it was
[1:44:26] [Applause]
[1:44:34] Angel brother brandham and brother
[1:44:36] brandham this is the eighth
[1:44:41] question why
[1:44:44] hair no why why
[1:44:48] hair why why why why why hair
[1:44:53] ha and it says because of the angels of
[1:44:57] First
[1:45:00] Corinthians and then he tells
[1:45:02] them now I Praise You
[1:45:05] Brethren that you remember me in all
[1:45:09] things and keeping of the ordinances as
[1:45:12] I delivered unto
[1:45:15] you but I would have you to
[1:45:18] know that the head of every man is
[1:45:21] Christ
[1:45:23] and the head of the woman is the man and
[1:45:27] the head of Christ is
[1:45:29] God what he's telling you is the weight
[1:45:33] of
[1:45:34] glory and he says this every man praying
[1:45:39] or
[1:45:41] prophesying having his head
[1:45:44] covered dishonors
[1:45:47] Christ but but every woman
[1:45:51] praying or prophesying with her head
[1:45:57] uncovered dishonors her
[1:46:00] head now then he says it would be rather
[1:46:03] it be be be shaven than than if she cut
[1:46:06] her
[1:46:09] hair for if the woman be not
[1:46:13] covered let her be
[1:46:20] shorn you are the only ones
[1:46:24] that have had the
[1:46:26] privilege to
[1:46:28] see the
[1:46:31] hair come
[1:46:34] down this is the weight of
[1:46:37] glory and it was supposed to
[1:46:40] come upon the
[1:46:43] woman the church the
[1:46:47] responsibility the head is
[1:46:49] Christ but the hair
[1:46:52] is the
[1:46:53] glory that he has given to his
[1:46:57] church it is the way of Glory
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:07] glor up until this
[1:47:11] time you didn't know what it
[1:47:15] was because you were in your
[1:47:18] churches and especially like in the
[1:47:20] Apostolic Church
[1:47:23] they use the
[1:47:24] veil because that was their
[1:47:27] covering but when the message of the
[1:47:29] hour
[1:47:30] came they said now your
[1:47:36] hair is your
[1:47:40] covering now for a
[1:47:43] man indeed ought not to cover his
[1:47:47] head for for as much as he is the glory
[1:47:51] and the image of God
[1:47:54] but the
[1:47:55] woman is the glory and the image of
[1:48:00] man
[1:48:02] so when he
[1:48:04] comes he turns the picture to the
[1:48:09] right this is why this picture has
[1:48:11] caused so much
[1:48:15] controversy there's people that say it
[1:48:17] didn't
[1:48:18] happen well to people that have not
[1:48:20] taken the responsibility yeah it has not
[1:48:22] happened
[1:48:27] but to who them that have taken the
[1:48:30] responsibility don't tell me I was
[1:48:35] there amen me
[1:48:37] too come on anybody else here it's
[1:48:41] called the weight of
[1:48:43] Glory this is why people don't know what
[1:48:45] they believe from one day to
[1:48:48] another because they have no
[1:48:50] identification
[1:48:54] now this is where brother this is
[1:48:55] Brother brand
[1:48:56] now in Germany
[1:48:59] once I saw a picture and it always
[1:49:01] struck with
[1:49:04] me a German
[1:49:07] painter has painted the picture that's
[1:49:09] called the
[1:49:14] Cloudland and when you see it brother
[1:49:16] Brown
[1:49:17] says off at a
[1:49:19] distance it's the horriblest looking
[1:49:23] Gloom you ever
[1:49:28] seen just clouds matted
[1:49:32] together people telling you it has not
[1:49:37] happened it's just clouds matted
[1:49:40] together when you're looking at it from
[1:49:43] a long
[1:49:44] distance in other words you have no
[1:49:49] responsibility and the weight of Glory
[1:49:51] has not rest
[1:49:53] upon
[1:49:59] you but when you get real close to
[1:50:05] it it
[1:50:07] changes it's angel's wings beating
[1:50:13] together that's why when we're here in
[1:50:15] the house of the
[1:50:16] Lord and you're raising up your hand and
[1:50:20] you're singing the songs of Di and you
[1:50:23] say I love the Lord Jesus what are you
[1:50:26] saying I have received the weight of
[1:50:30] Glory it is
[1:50:32] Angels it is
[1:50:34] angels that are beating their wings
[1:50:41] together so that's what Gloom is
[1:50:45] sometimes you look at it long
[1:50:48] distance it's gloomy and dark
[1:50:53] but take God at his
[1:50:55] word be certain that he's
[1:50:58] God move up close to
[1:51:01] it find out it's just Angels
[1:51:10] wings
[1:51:14] now find any Theologian you want in the
[1:51:20] Bible and all you're going to find
[1:51:23] is you're going to find a lot of blah
[1:51:25] blah blah blah blah blah
[1:51:29] blah I'm going to tell you I'm going to
[1:51:32] tell you who who's wrong and why I'm
[1:51:35] right and now he's a French
[1:51:41] model and everybody said did you see
[1:51:43] that French
[1:51:44] model and he's the ugliest person in the
[1:51:48] world and then you see a muscular guy
[1:51:53] that won the Olympics
[1:51:57] 1976 as a man now he says he's a
[1:52:03] chick oh forgive me now he says he's a
[1:52:06] he's a
[1:52:07] woman so now they asked the other
[1:52:11] guys how did you feel getting beat by a
[1:52:16] woman so now you can identify as
[1:52:19] anything you want to identify
[1:52:27] I like in Baton Rouge Louisiana when we
[1:52:31] went and and I'm not I'm not advocating
[1:52:36] guns man
[1:52:39] wrote my AK now he identifies as a
[1:52:47] 22 people can identify themselves as
[1:52:51] anything
[1:52:53] there there people that have married
[1:52:55] their
[1:52:58] cats and everybody says because we're
[1:53:00] now in this woke
[1:53:03] Society woke it's in this stupid Society
[1:53:09] it's how can a man be more than a man
[1:53:12] and then all of a sudden he's a
[1:53:17] woman are you with
[1:53:20] me how can a Christian say I am a
[1:53:24] Christian sit in here and hear the word
[1:53:27] of
[1:53:28] God and don't know from one day to
[1:53:32] another if they're a child of God or
[1:53:35] not the reason is they have not received
[1:53:39] the weight of
[1:53:43] Glory because one time that you receive
[1:53:46] it it makes you
[1:53:51] responsible
[1:53:53] amen it's so sad when you have
[1:53:56] interviews with
[1:53:59] people and you ask them why did you do
[1:54:04] this well everybody in the church is
[1:54:06] doing
[1:54:08] it you know they're doing
[1:54:11] it why can't
[1:54:13] I is that your your your
[1:54:18] compass or or are you saying this should
[1:54:22] you say this I don't do
[1:54:24] it because I've taken on the
[1:54:30] responsibility I have a position in this
[1:54:33] church nobody gave it to me God gave it
[1:54:37] to me and when God gave it to me I
[1:54:41] didn't have to take the weight of
[1:54:49] Glory what am I going to do give what
[1:54:52] I've got to do my
[1:54:54] responsibility brother brandom in the
[1:54:56] message what is the
[1:55:00] vision he says now what is the
[1:55:04] sear what is a
[1:55:07] vision it's another
[1:55:13] dimension I don't want to sound
[1:55:16] sacrilegious I believe in the baptism of
[1:55:18] the Holy
[1:55:20] Ghost I believe in baptis BM after
[1:55:23] baptism after
[1:55:25] baptism but if you never get a new
[1:55:29] birth you can have the baptism of the
[1:55:32] Holy
[1:55:33] Ghost 24 hours a
[1:55:36] day still go to hell you know why you
[1:55:39] haven't taken on the weight of
[1:55:46] Glory that's the
[1:55:49] greatest hardest thing
[1:55:52] in a church is to talk to people that
[1:55:55] have never been born
[1:56:02] again oh they know what brother brandham
[1:56:05] says but when the but when the weight
[1:56:11] comes I can't do
[1:56:14] that no no I can't do that I I I can't
[1:56:18] do that you know why it causes you to
[1:56:21] act different
[1:56:25] Frank doesn't bring the water
[1:56:29] in Joe John doesn't bring the wood
[1:56:33] in guess who's who's who we have to do
[1:56:36] Brother
[1:56:42] Sam yes who has to bring it
[1:56:45] in you got to bring it
[1:56:49] in right
[1:56:56] now it's a higher
[1:57:00] Dimension but everybody would rather see
[1:57:03] a few
[1:57:08] doves what a service we had Holy Ghost
[1:57:12] came in we jumped and we shouted we
[1:57:15] saying oh woo everybody went wo oh
[1:57:19] Hallelujah and everybody cried and they
[1:57:21] did everything and we had a great time
[1:57:24] what a baptism of the Holy
[1:57:26] Ghost and then you go home and you live
[1:57:29] anywhere you
[1:57:30] want because there's no weight of
[1:57:41] Glory but doves could not pick him
[1:57:48] up
[1:57:50] here that's right
[1:57:55] it required
[1:57:58] angels and brother brandom says and they
[1:58:02] picked me
[1:58:09] up oh I heard a great
[1:58:13] message it still
[1:58:15] takes for you to do something about it
[1:58:26] this opens up a whole another can of
[1:58:27] worms
[1:58:29] but you come into the mercy
[1:58:33] seat and there's two two
[1:58:37] cherubin and one is one is
[1:58:40] Michael and the other one is the
[1:58:43] devil and it depends how you come
[1:58:46] in depending on the anointing that you
[1:58:49] have you're going to get the image of
[1:58:53] one or the image of the other you either
[1:58:56] become an image of God or you become an
[1:59:02] idolator you either become the stature
[1:59:04] of the perfect
[1:59:06] man or you become a
[1:59:10] statue that's right and so many Malachi
[1:59:15] 4 five believers they just
[1:59:19] statu oh brother Brandon's going to do
[1:59:21] it oh brother and you know when brother
[1:59:22] Brandon comes
[1:59:24] back and you know what all this and I
[1:59:27] tell people this I'm not going to go
[1:59:29] back and forth with what what what you
[1:59:33] believe of the
[1:59:35] future I'm just telling
[1:59:37] you that I'm living right now in brother
[1:59:41] bram's
[1:59:44] [Applause]
[1:59:46] future so we become
[1:59:49] idolators and we don't know who to serve
[1:59:54] I tell you one
[1:59:55] thing Angels picked him
[1:59:59] up and if angels picked him up into the
[2:00:05] constellation then it's going to require
[2:00:09] angels to take you from the
[2:00:12] Earthly to the
[2:00:14] Heavenly in the waight of
[2:00:20] Glory all right
[2:00:22] I know you didn't get it but that's all
[2:00:24] right that's all right maybe some of you
[2:00:27] got it this is the weight of
[2:00:30] Glory what is the weight of Glory called
[2:00:33] you called for
[2:00:35] you it says this ye have heard it said
[2:00:39] of them of old
[2:00:41] time Thou shalt not kill but I say unto
[2:00:45] you you have said of the them of old
[2:00:49] time Thou shalt not commit adultery
[2:00:53] but I say unto you it has been said but
[2:00:57] I say unto you it has been said but I
[2:01:02] say unto you you have heard it said of
[2:01:06] old
[2:01:07] time an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[2:01:11] truth but I say unto you you have heard
[2:01:15] that it have been
[2:01:17] said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[2:01:19] hate thy enemy
[2:01:23] but I say unto
[2:01:25] you love your
[2:01:30] enemies bless them that curse
[2:01:33] you do good to them that hate
[2:01:37] you pray for them that despitefully use
[2:01:42] you and persecute
[2:01:44] you I didn't say
[2:01:46] that Jesus said
[2:01:50] this but what does it require for you to
[2:01:53] live
[2:01:56] that
[2:01:59] angels have got to pick you
[2:02:02] up have got to put you in the
[2:02:06] constellation and when you're in the
[2:02:09] constellation one of those angels He
[2:02:12] said look to
[2:02:15] me what was that that was his
[2:02:20] angel that was the
[2:02:23] Heavenly that picked up the
[2:02:25] Earthly and put on the weight of
[2:02:33] Glory Hallelujah what does he tell him
[2:02:36] to
[2:02:37] do now you got to go back
[2:02:41] east and you've got to tell the
[2:02:44] people one two 3 four five six seven
[2:02:48] steals what is all of that so the you
[2:02:52] could know more than everybody
[2:02:53] else so that you could be
[2:02:57] endued with power from on high that you
[2:03:01] can be dressed
[2:03:02] upon within upon
[2:03:07] without every way around you would be
[2:03:11] the glory of
[2:03:18] God and when he
[2:03:20] looked God looked he
[2:03:24] said he looked upon him he was so
[2:03:29] inspired to see him the way he
[2:03:33] looked and the
[2:03:37] form of him he was so
[2:03:41] inspired that he would be the perfect
[2:03:44] Masterpiece of a
[2:03:47] redeemer Jesus the
[2:03:50] Redeemer so God in order to be smitten
[2:03:57] himself because to pay his own
[2:04:02] penalty God and
[2:04:05] Christ became
[2:04:10] one so God could be smoked in the
[2:04:18] image and that's why Isaiah said
[2:04:22] we did esteem him smitten and Afflicted
[2:04:28] of yet he was wounded for our
[2:04:32] transgressions bruised for our
[2:04:35] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[2:04:37] was upon
[2:04:39] him and with his stripes we are
[2:04:42] healed then he says this The Perfect
[2:04:47] Image the God
[2:04:49] man God in
[2:04:53] had changed from the supernatural to the
[2:04:57] vision and the
[2:04:59] vision was projected into the
[2:05:03] image and the image was
[2:05:07] smitten so the supernatural could taste
[2:05:10] the feeling of
[2:05:13] death he could not do it in
[2:05:16] Moses he could not do it in any other
[2:05:19] Prophet because he could not
[2:05:23] but in this
[2:05:25] masterpiece he was the
[2:05:27] fullness of the godhead body he could
[2:05:31] not just project
[2:05:33] Moses he could project his entire
[2:05:42] being that's why we have not received a
[2:05:46] message a message just any
[2:05:49] message we've received the Eternal
[2:05:52] thoughts of
[2:05:54] God that have been transferred to the
[2:05:57] hearts of The
[2:05:59] Believer by the Angels lifting us up to
[2:06:02] Heavenly
[2:06:04] places and when he said I saw
[2:06:07] him he looked to me he said then I could
[2:06:12] never be the
[2:06:14] same you know why he had received the
[2:06:20] weight of
[2:06:25] we have been
[2:06:27] so we have been so
[2:06:30] privilege to have two of the greatest
[2:06:34] pastors that this message has ever
[2:06:38] produced if you have another Pastor God
[2:06:40] bless you feel feel the way about your
[2:06:44] pastor I say my wife's the most
[2:06:46] beautiful woman in the
[2:06:49] world man you should feel the same way
[2:06:52] if your wife's not the most beautiful
[2:06:54] woman in the world then then you're
[2:06:55] going to be looking at somebody
[2:07:00] else two of the greatest pastors this
[2:07:02] message has ever
[2:07:05] produced founding Pastor past the
[2:07:10] way but before he
[2:07:12] left he transferred the
[2:07:16] weight of
[2:07:17] Glory to our
[2:07:19] pastor what is our p Pastor trying to do
[2:07:23] for
[2:07:24] us is to give us the
[2:07:26] weight of Glory the
[2:07:30] responsibility so that together we can
[2:07:33] go
[2:07:34] home but it will take for you to live a
[2:07:38] life
[2:07:40] surrendered and let the
[2:07:43] Angels lift you up lift you up to
[2:07:48] another dimension to another plane
[2:07:52] to another
[2:07:53] place where what happens there where you
[2:07:57] receive the
[2:08:00] weight Paul
[2:08:02] says in this
[2:08:04] body I don't know out of this body I
[2:08:09] can't say but I saw
[2:08:12] one whether in this body or outside of
[2:08:15] this body but I saw
