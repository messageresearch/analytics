long trip I'm gonna be excited right now I need y'all to be excited come on all right now that's what I'm talking about so if we can stand this we could read a scripture little prayer beforehand is a playlist so in Matthew chapter 11 Mateo verse 12 verse and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets in the law prophesied until John hasta Juan and if ye will receive it this is Elias which was or to come amen let's our heads Heavenly Father Lord we get started father two say everything that you want us to say and do everything that you want us to do Lord quality we just give you all the honor and Glory La Gloria Lord and we surrender ourselves fully and completely Lord in Jesus Christ you may be seated one session thousand so the just to pick up where they they were talking about that day that day on Calvary the message of brother Branham and the third question that the brothers went over yesterday you know what are we doing today about that day on Calvary question don't get so serious so what are we doing okay each and every one of us has to answer that question for ourselves right now for me follow me that day on Calvary he he did what he did for me and he didn't have to yeah it was it was something God himself coming down and coming to Serve the People and then he tops it off with I'm going to redeem the people also yes you know for me seeing that so I I have no other choice but to give it my own I mean till the day I die I'm gonna give it my own no matter how tired I get important how much I don't want you and I know some of you guys are like oh brother you shouldn't have that attitude well I'm just being honest but that's the difference is realizing hey he did this for me you think he wanted to but I said I mean he did want to but do you think he was just happy to do it so so for me I'm gonna do that brother Levi it's good to see you very good to see you so you know brother Branham talks about a few things in that in that message and he says on that day he said yeah and he types it with that question but he also types it with the baptism of the Holy Spirit now on that day we have the gifts we were given a gift of the holy spirit so what does that mean I mean we're just we're pumped we're happy is a it doesn't mean that it I mean those things come with it but it also comes with a lot of trials and tribulations the thing the scripture the reason I read that scripture it's gonna it's it's battle all the day that you gave your life to him you're gonna have to fight for every inch or he's going to keep knocking you down and keeping you in the same spot he wants to keep you in okay so when we receive that Holy Spirit that means we're no longer living for ourselves at that point it means now God is living through us we we died out to the world we don't care about the things out there we we ignore our flesh and we focus on what God wants us to do you know going into um I'm going to read a couple of ideas so there you go there you go all right all right so so in in that message I could read a few quotes of of that is that day on Calgary is it says on on paragraph starting off on paragraph 94 . brother Branham says notice that brother bran MD said it was so unconsciously done sentimentation not doing things because we should do it that still shot that's still selfish we is sorry I can't help you out nothing at all and a way for me to help you out it was so surprising the sheep that they said Lord because before this he talks about when Jesus says I'm gonna separate the sheep and the goats and he told the goats he didn't do nothing for me I mean he names all these things he didn't do nothing for me he said so now he's talking about the Sheep Lord when were you hungry now this is the Sheep who's the Sheep a man this is us right man Lord when were you hungry when were you hungry and we fed you when did you feed him Joe Elementary right we're the Lambs we're feeding he's talking to us when were you naked and we gave you clothes when when this is the Sheep they don't even what are you talking about and he goes on when were you sick and we minister to you uh foreign just your life lived in them God let the people see that Calvary did for us so automatically and he's saying right there now there there's going to be people that will never come to church there's people that we may come across only once or I can take it but we might that might be the only time that they're going to get served by the Lord and we and then you're serving you're serving the lord but you're also getting served yourself and that's a that's just for me that's a blessing you're going um going to Uganda it's uh it's never it's never um easy it's rough it's hard on the body it's hard on your family um you know you got work it's not cheap you know I'll go but we go with a happy heart because when we get there we we're we're actually we're lining up with another part of us and while they're up there fighting on those grounds we're down here fighting on these grounds when you have two units coming together I mean we're we're happy to see each other we're we're soldiers in God's kingdom and when this trip going up there I mean I could say something about every man that went I mean they're just exceptional senores a man of God and you know it's always it's always awesome to see especially the ones that go for the first time because you all you also are able to see the look on their face of I got it it's you're not you're not just seeing the the people that are getting taught up there you're not just seeing that face on them but you're also seeing it on on some of us yeah and I was uh I was telling brother Aaron it's like um every every time we go for me it's because God's going to equip you for whatever battle he's going to send you I can't I can't equip myself you know a book but I mean nobody can I play he's gotta equip you if he's gonna send you somewhere so for me every time the man up there and and what the Lord has given the pastor and the and and the pastor hands out to the ministers and the men it's not it's not it's not just uh for them up there it's we're also getting for me I level up also but I mean and my spiritual man gets an addition added to me and it's not like oh well we come back and it gets removed it doesn't work that way God doesn't add something to you and take it away not the word not the word he won't do that so so it's it's always it's you you see them they go up there and they're training these men and sometimes I'm like what am I here for but like brother Ben said hey if I'm just here to carry a Bible well then I'm just here to carry a Bible yeah so you you see them they're they're over there training these men and and you know a little bit and here and there and you know yeah and at the same time you're also getting trained so so it was really it was really awesome just to see the way the our pastor who has used by the Lord to to train these men you know like if there's somebody in boxing or MMA Deportes or boxing well there's men that train them differently so brother Jerry and brother Danny Hermanos big MMA fans right you might have a coach that trains them just on hands right then that's uh one that trains them on kicks a grappling coach a defense coach a defensive an offense coach offensa and it was the I was watching brother Caleb do this with the man okay you go do this and all right now you is that's all I could think of in my they're looking at this and they're getting the word but through a spiritual look spiritual here he is getting trained they're getting trained they're getting trained to fight properly go against the enemy without a doubt know what it says love y'all amen God bless you bendiga what a privilege it is to be in the house of the Lord again sure it's good to be back home and see all your beautiful faces you know we get we get it all the time well we we missed you when you were gone well when we're gone we we miss you hey man I'm gonna ask you to stand I think our pastor for this opportunity and we're gonna we're gonna turn into a very a very uh well-known uh scripture probably the most recognized scripture in in the Bible John 3 16 says and it says for God so loved the world that he gave Al Mundo amen may the Lord has blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated [Music] Amen to all our brothers from Uganda who might be watching this uh either now or at a later time I just want to tell them foreign that's what I learned in six years [Applause] you you know it's uh it it it's um the second time we went to to uh to Uganda um it was it was December of 2017.ie right before we left um my father uh he put his arm on my shoulder and he told me something that was uh that that really uh that really impacted me and it really impacted our our pastor brother and brother Tommy and our ministry and all he said let's continue that was six years ago Africa is a very special place for my father Africa is he had such a love for the people and it was it was his joyful and I shouldn't say it was his Joy but it is his Joy there's no idea you know every every time I I I go to Uganda I can always feel the presence of of our founding Pastor there with us I can I can feel how how proud he is of the man that have sacrificed that have given their their all for this message and I know that he's so proud of each and every one of us and that's what brings me to this scripture is in John 3 16. for God so loved the world you know you can't give or you can give without loving you can give without loving Cinema but you can't love without giving that first uh that first part of that verse speaks of God's love for us for God so loved and what a thing that is to give so many so many times in life we're so worried we're so preoccupied with about what we're going to receive okay what we're going to receive from work but we're going to receive from school we're going to receive on our birthday but we're going to receive it after tax season and sometimes we fails to see where what we're going to give what can we give what are we doing with this message that allows us to give you know we can turn into the Book of John again chapter one John 1 10 Uno dias and it speaks on he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not and then he came unto his own and his own received him not and but as many as received him is to freely transfer is the possession of something to someone it's to hand over is the passer but I thought that was that was pretty amazing it's to freely transfer the possession of something to someone they are going so if I have this this note here in my hand and I'm saying to brother Julian he's not going to take it from my hand until I give it to him and once I give it to him freely what I think that is to receive okay but as many as received him he received the gift to them gave he powerless to become the word become is to evolve is to change into or emerge as something to he he uh but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God is even to them that believe on his name is what a wonderful thing that is when we can partake we have received from home and we can part and we can give it to somebody that has never received the message you know it is it's amazing what God can do is in just six years all because of an email from a brother in Northern Uganda Norte de Uganda and what how amazing is the way that God works you know there was a man that was that was building the church and he uh he prayed to God he said Lord I need material for my church I need laborers for my church I just need you for for you to provide well one day he got a knock on the door and he saw a man and the man handed him five acorns five acorns Cinco de Mayas he says what am I supposed to do with five acorns well he heard a voice well you want to build a church right he says yes I do you'll see see but I want you you to provide he says I have provided I've given you acorns what are you going to do with the acorns he scratched his head well I don't know what to do with these and when we went six years ago you know sometimes you ask the Lord for things Lord provide provide for us and sometimes he just hands us a seed you know you start you start planting the seed you don't know you know you don't know when it's going to come up and then one day and this one day was this this past week yesterday that we were there you see the you see many people they they worry or they they look forward to when you're reaping the Harvest but they're they're but they don't realize what the work goes in what the work goes into well planting the seed while this man this past week as we were with with the ministers what a great thing it was for our pastor to go and change it up a little bit and as he called each each pastor and asked him to do a certain thing is you can see these past six years of what God has produced of what God is doing and how that seeds is maturing you don't realize or you sometimes we don't take into effect on what God is doing in our midstation sometimes we just take a look around no we can be in in the message for 10 20 30 40 years and not even realize what our level is at what is not realize that God okay deals he is he is raising us up he's doing something great amongst our amongst our ranks and to see these men as they have matured oh I could see I can see that seed that was deposited six years ago coming to fruition and as brother Julius would say Julio he turned to our pastor pastor and he said these are the first fruits and I said wow wow praise the Lord you know it never gets old going to Uganda Uganda no I am I'm so blessed to to be a part of such a great ministry you know we went as 14. but we went as one man as 14 individuals and that's so important is because when you have 14 people you have 14 different ideas but it wasn't that way at all and it's never been that way you know just to see Warriors Guerreros my brother Jimmy was it Jimmy 69 years old you wouldn't think he was 69 years old you know there are so many examples of of men of of Faith you know I I look at our pastor pastor and what and what he does not only for our local congregation congregation local but for the missions out there it's so it's a word it truly is a worldwide Ministry you know and I've you know what I've learned on this trip takes me back to a to a to a Chinese proverb I thought the other day it says you give a fish to a man feed them for a day but you teach a man how to fish you feed him for a lifetime that's what I saw and and I've been seen in Uganda you teach someone God sent a prophet you teach him that it's not the Trinity but it's one God you teach them that there are three stages of Grace and just because you went through one stage doesn't mean that you're sealed or how the Holy Ghost is our as our pastor and different ministers have have done over the years you know you you've seen and you see the results of what God has done and what God continues to do it's undeniable it's undeniable that God in our last days he is moving says and he is moving very fast he is moving quick you know you see man that that are getting it like that Steven almost that they don't care who is is against them because they know and we appreciate everyone's prayers we appreciate everyone uh you know as as we go out on on the missionary field I want to thank all the ones that's as they're as they stay back home that are calling our families and checking up on them all the brothers and sisters from the bottom of my heart this is so much and may God bless you yes [Applause] contentos no tonight is the internment Jesus when he died he just didn't lay in the Tomb um he did a lot of things fulfilled many scriptures but before we enter into that let's go in our Bibles to acts the second chapter of those verses 25-27 amen amen stand for the reading of the world for David speakett concerning him I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved is therefore did my heart rejoiced and my tongue was glad more all over also my flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thy Holy One to seek corruption may the Lord add your blessing to the reading of his word and you may be seated before I start I think it's time to give out a few flowers to my family I mean Familia [Music] I I want to thank them for for supporting me no this is the second time now that we go to Uganda right after my birthday is you know I need money for Uganda neces Uganda and so I tell my family particularly hear me familiar you know if you just just want some greenbacks that's all I want for my birthday is they have really done a good job yes I hope every time we go to Uganda is right before my birthday yes they've been wonderful I think my wife you know we're not spring chickens anymore it's good I like that the way you said that yeah but by the grace of God you know and I would rather do something for God on my birthday then stay at home to use what God gives me in my birthday for the kingdom of God amen amen thank you my precious family and that's my precious family because you are my family you know as we we think on that day on Calvary and as brother Mark brought out that third question what shall we do for that day and this will probably be the only quote I read because if not I'll go over time amen amen praise the Lord I may have to turn around and look at it let's see if it's here I have it right here this evil age paragraph 69. and when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ in there God made me pay for my sins in him then he rose me entonces and raised me up with him and the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil or if you could only believe what God has given us but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you sit it there and don't believe it is and afraid to move you will never use it but if you are seated there you will use it for your ordained to do what you do because that's what we can do for that day on Calvary yes maybe some of you saw that clip from The Passion of the Christ last night for the first time and as humans we say well that that is so gross so horrible what he went through for you and me when they would beat him and he would cry out is that all you see because if this quote that I just read is the truth is when he cried out I can see myself crying because I I was in him in the genes of his word oh yes the spirit had left him but I was hit him there he was making me pay for my sin and him that's that's incredible when you see the blood come off of his body and each drop of blood you see the ground already represents your portion of the Holy Ghost and one of those drops of blood is you gotta put your name because the life came out of that blood that's what we can do for that day on Calvary yourself in the sacrifice the life of that blood flows to somebody to heal somebody that's why when I go to Uganda people say man you must have transformed Powers the younger guys do you know there's a little compartment in the human heart says or there's not one sale and brother Branham calls it the dwelling place of the Soul he said why have there's a great Center of power in the universe which if we could have contact with that Center of Power contact we could create worlds and not just create worlds but then we could go and live in the world that will be created and that's exactly what we're doing in Uganda yes that's what inspires me universo when that great Center of power is in that little room that's in your heart where from there God can generate life that is thrown in Jesus Christ but now his throne is the human heart that's what we can do for that day on Calaveras amen amen I saw this brother James there on one of the in the video he was that one brother that had this real bright blue suit on yeah it's mine well his name is James my name is Jimmy how many numbers [Music] he was just so getting into the word yesterday is such a tremendous to see these men there was opposition we don't want to go into that position we better work college today brother for the night is coming when no man will work amen amen now aura the Entune elentier can you imagine Abraham Abraham after job had died job was buried in the land of Palestine Palestina and Abraham when Sarah died he bought a plot of land in the same place where job was buried and he buried then Abraham himself died and he was buried in then he says don't leave my bones in Egypt I know one day you guys gonna bring you out and when you go out you take my bones with you also Joseph also said Jose take him and bury them in the same place hand paid the price for that and Jesus Christ paid the price for this land says bury me in Christ in any other s buried in Christ can you give me that one other quote and I'll finish with this is amen praise the Lord Jesus amen what we can do for that yeah tell the guys over there amen amen but when the Son of God died them was none other but God is into the family of God and now we are children of God not by the life we are the children of god let's say together we are it's almost the children of God the life La Vida from his blood that's who Sangre [Applause] la vida from the bloody can you bleed out that life is angry when you see Jesus see the whole movie would be good for you I am part of that blood coming out of that body yes and it's Living God bless you yes [Applause] super Laura God bless you happy to see each and every one of you happy to be back and happy to to know that we have been called by God it's so good again to see each and every one of you especially one of our dearest and greatest friends we're very happy we're very happy to have you here tonight we we've been privileged by God privilege to to to know him and the power of his resurrection we've been privileged by God to read the pages of the Sacred Scriptures we've been privileged by God to hear the words of our beloved Prophet we've been privileged by God be founded in this church under the uh under the doctrine of Apostles and Prophets where is Levi God bless we're been privileged by God to be able to continue the vision that our founder left us he didn't leave us a dead letter he left us a little been a living breathing word and that's the reason that we are here today I was telling brother Caleb Leicester I have never been so tired after a trip like this trip but at the same time satisfied with what God has done the word of God tells us in the Book of Psalms chapter 105. and verse verse 19 until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him I want to say it again until the time that his word came and every one of us has a portion of the word foreign and all the word of God is being made manifested today I believe that each and every one of us has a particular part to play particular in this great drama of God we ourselves Nosotros mismos have been given the great responsibility responsibility and that is to close out the age this is the last day this is the last people well we'll be alive before the coming of the lord we are alive and remains shall not hinder those that have gone before us himself descend from heaven he's the great star five stars came out we see one of them right here with us tonight one of them is [Music] foreign can I tell you what somebody said in the Book of Joel he said it shall come to pass in that last days for my spirit upon All Flesh when Peter gets it he receives the Revelation in Peter's time it was not the last day but it keeps the world when he says this particular word in particular this particular phrase is esto is that is oh yeah we will just serve God a little bit unless we know what our word is it is not a different word that it's a lot to you so when Peter gets it he says this is that and this is which was spoken from The Prophet's Prophet I believe every word that you're the pranam said but I also believe there will be a bride who is that word palabra who's that word are you with me church this is the word in actions of the prophecy of brother Brands brother Branham says maybe then the last time the last one to come in will be a black sheep where then do we go where there's black sheep has negras we can either get on the prophecya we can read the scriptures and think about tomorrow or bring the prophecy to pass [Music] right she wasn't in the she wasn't in the in the in the vision but she pulls the vision and forces the vision for her time the prophet of God speaks about three pools soon I gotta read this just one second Segundo got Emmanuel dios Emmanuel creating around himself a blood cells that brought forth the sun Jesus Christ when he was born here on Earth he lived and was made fun of Isle and they're in the pocket of the heart a cruel Roman Spirit opened it up and broke that blood cells no more house what does the blood cell do it releases a now aura sometimes people says is that would that be your church no that's no that's Jesus's church I'm just proud to be part of his church would that be your ministry no no I'm just proud to be part of that Ministries no no I'm just part proud to believe all that the prophet has spoken again in itself and see Miss has the creative power to bring you to the vision and make it to come to pass what does that day then mean for us is he has
