youth video but before we do we wanted to read a scripture we're already standing if you don't mind bringing out the word we'll be turning in to do to Raman Deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 7 [Music] and I have it here in English of the guys upstairs if you could also put it in Spanish afterwards how many have it amen all right so the scripture reads like this remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will show thee thy elders and they will tell thee and in Spanish a queer da da de los tiempos and TiVo's considerin los años de muchos generaciones pregunta a tu padre y el de de carrera de clarity clarity like that yata stanziano's dias de vere on and with that we're gonna go ahead and get our joy video started I bless you you may be seated [Music] [Music] the first question is how did you come to know the Lord Jesus [Music] this is educators phone system is burning and detective Daniels okay because you know you know that message [Music] how did you come to know the Lord Jesus Oh actually I was raised in a religious home there Baptist I was raised Baptist I don't wanna make sure I'll take two I could take a long time but I the first question is how did you come to know the Lord Jesus [Music] okay because you know that message [Music] how did you come to know the Lord Jesus ugh actually uh I was raised in a religious home Baptist I was raised Baptist I don't wanna get on an extremity too low because I could take a long time like that but I couldn't the Lord Jesus says of my personal Savior there are eight years in the Baptist Church and at that time I was baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost the key to every [Music] reach for that dimension me [Music] to lie for me to accept myself this Massoni [Music] No [Music] today's subject because it up we all go through complex and we see certain young people that have such a rapport result to us they're so tremendous under when I was an ignorant you know in the youth that course I was in a Baptist Church and there's certain people I would want to be like there but the reason that I wanted to be like dimness I had a complex about me so I was always trying to be like somebody else and I was never happy right now - Vanessa - the absolute the revelation of Jesus Christ [Music] rat's nest Nene has more patience on my gosh this first question is um how did you guys come to know the Lord Jesus and you know like your testimony look like what you're wearing Baptist I was baptized in November 1986 in this in [Music] that was I missing here that you received illegals I have met brother Tommy a year August abate admired and he's the one that made the message come alive for me and so we went to our city [Music] my dad got baptized in 86 so yeah when when I got baptized I just felt like I became a new person I believe that I receive my ghost [Music] [Applause] recognized [Music] your that is just my clothes reduce about away from to me was for the news a question right example if you had a better life [Music] well for me I was raised in a Christian home we went to all different kinds of churches but it was pretty wishy-washy one day they were out one day they were down and so I really didn't see anything in that for me so when I was able to move out of the house I left but when I found the message then I found something that was really real in it just it was like that deep calling to the deep and there isn't anything else and so there's nothing else to go back to and that's what keeps me going because I know that I'm where I'm supposed to be so when did you start like attending serials in [Music] what keeps you going [Music] now violates before I came out here [Music] the city for smell may be severe no question just popped up with my hands we were they'd been I guess my first bath [Music] well I consider myself a Baptist Franzi [Music] you know I had the question why are there so many different churches there's only one Bible why there's so many different churches and that didn't didn't say right with me as writer so do they not both the same thing that question but that statement when I read the maximum profit and I just to me just everything that he said in there by the Browns life [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] how do you maintain your relationship with order like their brothers [Music] well fellowship is the best [Music] so we're lacking because we don't love our brothers and sisters it's just that it's hard first [Music] every day you get up and you go out there and face the world if you're not grounded then same just gonna swipe that away from you so you have to stay grounded in the word and you have to hear brothers voice it's what is the key to life so grandma grandpa the first question is how did you come in our Lord Jesus and what is you guys his testimony my testimony would be as after I grew up in it Baptist Church I got to know him then but I got to become acquainted and part of him when I met you your grandma and you and what date that was well not exact date but it was 1992 probably after about July August because we knew each other will fall before and then when did you start attending the services that exceeded those probably March March or April of 92 and at that same time did you meet another time you see me no I remember when the taught me and above 80 81 cuz I was delivering package to we lived in Santa Clara I see right you can already see how did you come to know Lord Jesus and or what is your testimony I came to him to the Mexico to stay with aunt Lana when I was 14 and I to church with them I went to resonate Castillo Sam can you go down every Sunday for that summer I was 14 so I would be happy to be at this number has a uncle and Dan your do this working and that was a young girl of course it didn't really quick but it never left me there you know the memories are still really good so that was personality and then but I was actually raised immature extent I knew the message but I didn't know that there was proper so I guess I learned about through the ground you gonna give vividly as a teenager or what that's a wife at those ears and learning about brother branham den then from their own to Lordsburg when my nephew was killed little Jeremy the villagers would and I came to the kingdom and that was when I first met brother Tommy and his ministry there the men that were with him in the ministry and that was my first impression of that God was more than just a story that because I could I felt when brother Tommy was when they were carrying though Jeremy's coffin brother tommy was in the front and the minister was behind them carrying the coffin and they were reciting that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and no and then that was a personal merit almost always and that was when I recognized [Music] multiples of bathing we just have a new awakening and I was that was in that was in the eighties like middle eighties or something like that maybe for the night maybe my babies but um anyone else another date on me and I left but I never it's like nothing ever worked after that things just like in touched fell apart I came back with my I didn't really come to church while standing you know and I try to try that and then I met grandpa in 92 and that's when we both started coming through record but it was five years before we were baptized either one of us were baptized on the back end so my thinking was saying good I've got five years thing that's bitter good 223 songs uh-huh and so I think that was a 19 [Music] ninety-eight that guess is when we got that place huh three plus five is eight seven nine ten nineteen eighties when we both have baptized I'm going on like right at 30 years he's a new penis about 20 26 years me Georgie one pony soon that's awesome so we started going to Cedar Hills regular in 90 in muddy - yeah in March of 92 there you guys got baptized do you would you guys say that that's when you receive the Holy Ghost or when was that you receive I tell you what it was a darn good place to start because that was the cleanest feeling in the world wouldn't because that's us that's us everything really to get that prize but it's just like oh man there ain't no turning back here I mean you know it's it's like a public thing in it it's like you're required to that that's the way it was for me I I can't be friendly to me it was I I don't think that was it for me getting baptized to me was something I had to do not to get the Holy Ghost ranking if something I had to do I think I got it more meeting to Camp Thunderbird I actually surrendered myself I think that's when I came in the baptism like I said it was just you have to do it a little bit so then what would be two guys what would be the key of life the misconception about people and their relationships the red said you know marriage is a 50/50 proposition I absolutely disagree marriages are under feet and an opponent and if you're not willing to give that much and then we'll do it it's not a halfway thing you're going to go all the way was your question then the key tip would be to you like the key of life you will not this is one that is the key to life is knowing the life giver knowing here mommy like not being able to live without you no and the key of life is nurturing relationships you know fellowship and you know cuz not the other side act that's the only thing that acts is when we're with believers that are like-minded and do God's will I mean that's the key advice to me see blessing marriage that goes two ways that merge between husband and smiles and marriage between me and God and you've got the gold full built you can it's not a fifty-fifty day if life is taken care of you know others you cut stock takes care of you that way I mean you can't others and that's when you can feel the life flowing we go through still times you know but other than when you reach out and actually try to help other that's like it really is serving [Music] [Applause] that I you know said according to the message Church I started going in Bayard and that's were even even our church was going in Bayard at that time they were in Cuchillo and they go over there once or twice a week no once every two weeks they congregate there and I went for two years before brother was there but I go by myself and after two years here and enough here to start going with me you know but I was in the Apostolic Church and got out for different reasons then went into the message Church but brother Tommy and the church separated from their church and I didn't know the reason why I just I felt like I was by myself because I wasn't married and they get left so finally they started having services in homes they started having prayer meetings in homes and I would ask him when are you guys having a prayer meeting at a house and he said I can't tell you he says you're going to church over there and I'm not going to moonlight or whatever you know we're going but anyhow I kept testing some of our sisters and they would tell me so I'd show up at the prayer meetings and but after two years then brother Russ I'll let him tell his side how he came in you know but I saw I've been in the message it doesn't really a lot of times you think well you've been in the message for 38 years but has iMessage been in you uh-huh you know what I'm saying so so I'll let him tell his site for him he came into the message a very good doctor yeah like you said I came in tears you'd get done two years longer than me I came in two years after you and we were going to bear by every switch was a shortcut remember yeah but tell her how you came in we went to a prayer meeting into your scene mm-hmm to us we're all in the same garden time in by the line Laden truth booth did I to the prayer meeting and tear fee [Music] [Applause] prophecy there [Music] and about that and anyway when we went over there I didn't want to be a hypocrite so I was so smoking directed smoke on the way over there after that pervy the Lord gets all that away from me [Music] I guess the rest you know it's just I continued going to church well we had to go and make things right you know yeah we had to come out of a bear church in the right way brother Tommy told us so we had to go and talk with brother or Nick and we told him that we were going to move to sort every nickel with brother yeah proselyte what we're gonna do change churches would have to do it the right way yes so we did we had a meeting with him and he has but why do you want to go he says I mean I love you guys very much and have I done anything wrong and we said no you just feel like we belong over there and and he started crying and we cried and at least when we left we were in good terms you know and friends and also we did it the right way and so from there nuns which was in nineteen that's he's 71 that's when you know we started going we started of course so tabernacle and then when I need to sit her heels Tabernacle and we've been used to look at you being faithful you know since then with and then of course how do I admit brother Tommy well it's my brother's opinion Rosie nap him and I were you know there was always a family at 13 there was always two and growing up it was him and I that wasn't the closest and then I'll let brother us say his testimony as to how he met brother Tommy we joined the Navy at the same time and I was from mom I left over close to Hobbs New Mexico and then of course he was from Hanover and they took all everyone from you Mexico and and took them to Albuquerque to be sworn in and that's where I bet Tommy I think he was 18 at the hour 17 and then and we went to boot camp together and I got out of boot camp we we were stationed aboard to st. [Music] life together see but the funny part about this if you want to call it funny I mean my brother Branham says nothing is a coincidence yes both of them [Music] that's what am I trying to say that test both a and flunked the test in Albuquerque right yeah baby no they didn't know each other and he they both liked it so they had to go and we do it and that's how they got their past yeah yeah yeah yeah and then you know of course you know they were in the same ship they slipped across from each other so you know brother Ross and brother Tommy were you know there for four years heeey when I when I first met brother last night she was just like you know just my brother's friend but never anything any feelings nothing in our [Music] my brother Tommy were telling ya I guess he asked and you take the poverty sister you said there's no way no way I say there's going to open my sister you know you're not good enough but you know it it came to the point that dance I think they had what six months left yeah and he took me to a wedding of a friend of mine my sister asked him that I need told him I needed a day and that was that wasn't so I mean I he didn't want it not something that I was like boy shy yeah but that was behind my back anything about it so anyhow from that day on it took six months we've got engaged after two months without engaged and then four months later were they have just we were going to elope but they said nope say my sister made my dress and they all helped us then in six months were married and in for a week or so we're going to be celebrating Leticia so that's how you guys met them yeah just just so what you wanna wear though so yes my next question would be how do you maintain your relationship with the Lord and with your brothers and sisters in Christ well for me that thing to do is that help your brothers and sisters sometimes they you know if there's problems and they come to you you listen and you try and help them the best way you can you know and counseling for from what we've been through and we just were honest with each other we don't hide nothing from each other we're very open and like I say after 56 years do you think that Roma we're getting old I mean I told him one time I'm getting old and fat and he says to me and not you're just as beautiful as the day I married you and and I told him you're the same way it says I never favorite that I was gonna marry your father because he looks that spitting image of his dad you know and but anyhow our life our love grows deeper and stronger being there worrying the Lord you know instead of being last night it's just more and more and with our brothers and sisters you know we're just there for them and then [Music] the key of life sir the Lord with all my heart and heart and soul and I just love him and just pray you know never forget to pray and never forget to read whether the I'm not much for the Bible I mean maybe I worded it wrong then when I read the Bible I I don't understand sometimes so I rather listen to a message you know because if I read the Bible and then there's things that don't make sense oh yeah I mean it's just so loud until I if I'd read something I don't understand it then I gotta go with brother lon and then daddy and my brother cuz he'll come anytime I call him he'll come and explain you know but just stay in the word he stay in the Ark and just go straight down the middle door the other side you know I always put God first you have hard times knowing that God's servant make something you know cuz if it wasn't for that one of our biggest trial that we had a friend who lost her grandson's life at the age of 19 you know that was one of the hardest things ever and they my daughter still can't get in this like I told her you won't see him again detector you know and I know that God took him up with us scene to save a soul and that's what keeps us going [Music] [Music] okay so how did you come to know the Lord Jesus what is your testimony okay I think I've always known it because I was always in church all the time but I grew up as a Catholic first and then from there I went to another Christian charity me was wrong about ourselves and I just felt that I've always known him but I never knew I could have a personal relationship with him so that makes a big difference and once I went into the potter's house I thought I had that personal relationship it's just that it was in my place so I strongly come to with brother Caleb and that's why I am [Music] this is how did you come to know Jesus what's what's your testimony I well I got it but when she got into but before that they were still my sister wasn't it she's the one that really started first one by one we can follow it to observe them [Music] - in general what's what's the key to life and then we can even throw in [Music] maybe his hoes can answer that first what keeps you keeps you going moving forward subscribing [Music] what keeps me going is that I know that there's some chill garden and maybe God not in this well I really do he's oops it's true [Music] further IRA opted out of doing interview via phone call however he did give me a list of all the answers to the questions that we had for beginning with how the simple answer was by hearing answered when he was baptized was on March of 1982 and he accepted the message in 1989 when he first began to know brother Tomas better senior was in 1975 and what keeps him going is the message of faith in God he maintains a relationship with God by reading his Bible hearing the message to pray the key to life to him his love and and the source of his success is knowing that he is never alone his favorite song is beautiful star Bethlehem that super message where brother branham is the invisible union of the Bride of Christ his favorite color is blue his favorite food is steak and his advice to being a parent or grandparent is to show love to one another so auntie um could you tell us how you came to know the Lord my parents was very special the natural detergency the pastor's wife and the lanes they're innocent Jean they've got something I want so that was beginning of my conversion there and when were you baptized empty I was baptized in February of nineteen sixty one mom who left my brother mine was pastoring and he baptized so what would you say that the key to life is for you like what keeps you going what keeps me going is that I know that my redeemer the redeemer lives and someday I will be holding a face-to-face and I will see my loved ones that had crossed the Jordan River in our overrun okay so Heidi attends you also known as Nana I'll ask you a few questions today and just answer it however you want to so when did you meet my pastor Caleb Caleb 20 years [Music] their aim is to take you out Junior [Music] and I used to drive my mom that's really when I first got to them more first started going out to church at the rest the church was still around Valley nobody Church and I didn't I didn't really do close together Intel when I moved on you when I started me about how you had a blood disorder and how you were healed so can you tell us the story about that and when it started sure it was it just came on suddenly about 18 years ago [Music] eighteen years ago I had gone on a March of Dimes walk you know I got a that evening and didn't really feel good and then the other night I was started throwing up blood and I I couldn't lift my arms I was really sick and ended up the emergency room [Music] I had no platelets there's nothing bleeding out I started getting artificial platelets I was in the intensive care I was really sick and they didn't know what was wrong with me and finally the hematologist that was there instead that I had a blood disorder it's called ITP so then we did some research and come to find out this blood disease residence and my family but it's always been on in the girls not on the boys so I did pretty good and then about six months later just out of the blue this came back again and what happens is it's like you have leukemia you just start bruising everywhere it put a blood pressure cuff on your lower arm turns black it was awful and so I was really sick and I took care of you know I really I really need for it to be prayed for because they said there's no cure for this and I don't care it [Music] of course at that time I was not in message I've always been a always been a believer but I do not come to message too recently Caleb left and I went in the bedroom and I was laying there and I looked up and I said Cameron you know come here you have to see this and Camp King running into the bedroom and there was a white light in an arch that were and I am NOT in success so I was healed and was healed in that in that time what that's pretty neat yeah that's nice that was a real turning point that was for me and I think it was was a phenomenal you know all right well I like what faith is is the most important thing [Music] you know [Music] Walter's for measuring away I not message very long but I really believe that my faith in Him led me to the message into the church and to this place with all the brothers and sisters that help here where I've always intended to be you know always go like this is where I go on so they're stuck with me how did you come to know the Lord Jesus Christ many many things go through brother Tong big big top okay so do you remember what year you were baptized while back when did you accept the message of the hour [Music] [Music] and what's your favorite color boom and when did you meet our founding pastor and when did you start attending Cedar Hills Church of the crafts [Music] what is it that keeps you going away [Music] kids family and the wife [Music] and what is the key to life for another day how do you maintain your relationship with your brothers and sisters in Christ Barry [Music] [Music] [Music]
