day saying that she knew someone who was selling Labradors and well they were selling two yellow Labradors and we we felt that those dogs were our we felt that those those were our dogs and well one of the dogs already sold and only one was left and I believe that do dog was made from the beginning of the Earth for us God made that dog for us and I'm so grateful that the Lord would think so highly of us to give us such a wonderful gifts and I just can't explain how good is his mercy and whenever the dog was coming we prayed and we prayed and we prayed that he would have a good spirit a

to be here let's turn our scripture to First John 5:14 and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this last year I got to go hunting it was really tough we tried really hard but we couldn't do it on our own but every morning we pray and I knew that God would hear my prayer amen and on Thanksgiving Day my dad gets a call from one of his customers he says I found a buck for your son we drive to this spot may show you the picture please guys and that's the proof that God heard my prayer I shot the buck my confident against God was through the roof but I wanted him more in my life than just hunting that's right and I wanted him to be just as conf confident in me as I am in him let's turn to Matthew 7:7 ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you amen I wanted him wanted more to be open to me but in order to do that I had to give him my heart I felt like Psalms 42:1 As the deer panteth after the water bricks so my soul longth after thee oh God I felt like the deer I was thirsty for God I wanted more from him so at the end of last year I decided to give him my heart and this year I got baptized I felt wait he found me and I found him God bless you the Lord hello hello hello are they ready for us yeah let's roll Tommy's

sensitive spot I'm sorry about that all right I guess I forgive you well today we want to do something special for you children thank you well you're welcome we want to tell you another story and it's a very special story of a man in the Bible named Daniel Daniel I just love the story of Daniel does it ring a bell uh I had an interview earlier this week I think it was your uncle's cousin Auntie oh yeah yeah yeah that was my uncles's cousins Auntie sister's boyfriend that was in the D oh my goodness what a lineage yeah I'm related all right well I wonder how many of these kitties know about Daniel oh you see actually Bear since you did it last time I took it upon myself to interview one of the smartest kitties I could find well aren you fancy thank you just trying to be like you bear everybody does all right all right anyways gentlemen could you roll the tape he titties tonight we got an interview with our brother Jonah brother Jonah is going to tell us a little bit about Daniel can you do that for us yes all right so who was Daniel Daniel is a prophet God's true witness perfect can you also tell me what Daniel got in trouble for because he did not about to any Adventures perfect you're just so smart and lastly can you tell me what it was that Daniel got thrown into there was hungry lions in it like what like me yeah perfect perfect all right back to you bear [Applause] I'm here with sister Lena and sistera is you're three oh that's amazing I remember when I was three now I hear you're going to be a big sister is that true mhm awesome well today we want to ask you a couple questions about the Bible can you tell me who Daniel was mhm who was Daniel in the Bible he was a prophet h a prophet wow that's the best answer I've heard and what happened to Daniel he he he was home to the Lion's Dan oh the Lion's Dan how come because he was praying he was praying oh my gosh will that happen to me if I pray no I got an idea what if you you show us how you pray can you do that mhm can you pray for us mhm okay I'll close my eyes help us when we we when you die on the cross for us help us in the name of the father amen wow that's the most beautiful prayer I've heard well and we'll talk to you later okay okay back to you happy well that was just amazing bear you did a fine job yourself well thank you my good man so how about we get into that story now that they have a little background perfect I'm ready all right all right can you all hear me yeah okay cool there once was a king over Bab Bon named Darius one day King Darius decided he need some help ruling the people of Babylon so he asked Daniel along with two other men to help him the king preferred Daniel over everybody else in the Kingdom because he was honest and upright every morning Daniel would open his windows towards Jerusalem get on his knees and pray not once not twice but three times a day Lord I Thank you for this beautiful day thank you for all the blessings on my life help me Lord to serve you with all my heart I give you all the honor and glory amen look at Daniel just thinks he's the big cheese around here everyone knows that I should be the king's right-hand man not Daniel oh please only thing you're good for is cutting the cheese look if we want to get rid of Daniel we're going to have to attack his very belief in God we're going to make a decree yeah for the next 30 days oh no man can pray to anyone no God no man besides King dararius perfect and if they do they're going to be captured and thrown into a Den of Lions I like Ito then we can have King Darius sign the decree and as soon as we catch that little holy roll ER Daniel oh yeah praying to his God it's game over Daniel game over Daniel like Sunday night when it's time to go back to school game over oh yeah that day all the presidents princes counselors Governors and captains got together and presented the decree to King Darius King Darius you know I was thinking you were thinking that's dangerous anyways we were thinking yeah more like me we were thinking that can't even talk shut up let me speak you can't say that word that's a bad word anyways any this morning all right all right anyways some people's kids anyways if I get a chance to speak I'm going to get get rid of you soon wow we were thinking that you should make a new rule that says nobody can pray to any God yeah or any man besides you just for 30 days and if they do they'll be thrown into the lion's den oh yeah perfect perfect when Daniel heard that the law was passed he ran home and began to pray Daniel was not going to let anything get between him and his god wow I don't know why my friend Darius would make such a decree he knows I serve the one true God oh well I'm just going to do what I know to do and pray to God Amen oh lord I Love You Lord thank you for your faithfulness forgive me Lord I don't understand why my friend Darius has made a decree he doesn't want me to pray to anyone but him but I ask that you help my friend Lord to make better decisions amen well well well thought I wouldn't catch you praying huh didn't you you little sneak you little sneak in the grass yeah just wait until King Darius here's about this we should just punish him ourself whoa dudes what's going on here bro what have you guys done to Daniel well we found your Daniel breaking your decree and praying to his God Daniel bro my brother my friend is that true dude you broke my decree tell me it's not true yes King it is true but I cannot take back what I've done I understand well I guess you got to throw him in the Lions then yeah throw him throw throw him throw him throw him all right all right dude bro relax that's enough throw him yes that's true I can't take back what has already been written Daniel I must keep my laws I'm sorry but I got to throw you into the lines then I understand King Darius but I will not take back what I've done you must do what you must do but I've got to do what I've got to do Daniel my friend the god that you serve will deliver you I got a great idea so do I what your idea maybe they're the same maybe they are we want to do something evil how evil real evil so evil that evil things don't look evil I like it that's exactly what I was thinking we're so bad man well every time you think it's dangerous so I think it's going to be evil and dangerous that's great so what if we get a couple of vicious hungry lions from the audience yeah yeah I like that idea and maybe they'll come up and they'll roar like a lion and show just how those Lions tried to scare Daniel perfect perfect and then we'll be called the bad boys of Babylon bad boys of Babylon bad boys of Bon all right where's our lion keeper it's my get the vious ones the hungry on hungriest did we fire him where's he at maybe they ate him too he must be pretty vicious maybe they ate each other and then ate themselves then our plan is failed uhoh then they might eat us oh man whoa that is SC wait that was pretty weak man that was a pretty full- grown kitten if you ask me yeah you ask for Hungry Lions not malnourished oh all right all right come on bring it on let's see what you got oh wow that one was scary oh man this one whoa we're surrounded man hey hey get back get back you mess with my mustache I think that was perfect I think so too I think our plan's a success Daniel's not going to know he's coming no he's not is there still Lions up here someone get these Lions off the stage this is ridiculous you've gone too far come on man okay it's real it's real it's real all right all right it got real real fast oh none of us are Daniel where's the keepers at where's the keepers man they're fired they're done you better get out of here man let's go King Darius was extremely disappointed with himself he did all that he could to save Daniel but it was too late Daniel found himself in the darkest place of his life and surrounded by hungry Lions but Daniel chose to have faith in God dear God you are so mighty and Powerful I know I'm in this Den of Lions for your honor and your glory I know that your angel is here I will fear no lion you will shut their mouths show your power oh Lord and show these people that you are the one true Living God hidden power that was in Daniel it came out and it'll come out when you have need of it and what did the hidden power do clothe him completely all they saw was fire and all they did was say oh they're afraid of fire pretty good H where's those lions at you believe that or not Glory that night King Darius was enabled to sleep worried for Daniel that morning the king went straight to the den to see if God had protected Daniel Daniel bro Daniel servant of the Living God was your God able to save you oh King live forever my God sent his Angel he shut the mouths of the Lions I don't even have a scratch on me praise the god of Daniel take him out of that Dan and clean up now clean him up what do you mean he's still alive oh man we're in trouble as for you too I will have you and your family thrown into the Dan that you Tred to kill Daniel with no wait we can explain that's not what it looks like like that really I make a decree that in every part of my kingdom men will tremble and fear the god of Daniel for he is the the Living God he has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions king Darius was so pleased with the god of Daniel that he made a decree that all men would know that the god of Daniel was the one true God because of Daniel's decision to stand for the Lord he prospered under the reign of Darius and Cyrus the Persian the end [Applause] so I've got an idea what's that I've got an idea can you hear me what if we sing a song ah dude that'd be like perfect I feel a song coming I feel a song coming hold up hold up uh you know I could just take it easy that's my dam yeah let's go bro oh yeah the king told Daniel not to pray to his God anymore I'll lock you in the L stand and throw away the keys to the door the very next day found Daniel down on his Bend and knees the difference is time he open the blind so the whole wide world can see I don't care what you say I'm going to PR anywhere going to lift my hands unto the Lord for the things he's done for me I just got to get away find a place to seek his face I don't care what you say I've got around to pray they tell our children not to pray when they walk through the schoolhouse door according to the Constitution you can't do that anymore I wonder what old Danel would say if he were alive today if the child declar no
