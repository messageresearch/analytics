get started we got a lot of traveling to do today I know it's windy but I think we can make some good time are you all going to sit up here and watch me or I do you want to take a seat I need all this room you got to get down all right let's see here break the ice yeah we did that welcome to the laboratory of God God's laboratory this is where faith without works is dead and I'm gonna make a t-shirt of that I think that'd make a good t-shirt so how many brought your Bibles if you can't you can go home if you didn't bring it why have it if we're not gonna read it right all right let's open Bibles we're going to turn to Matthew 16:25 and the first one to get it will be a okay the first one is a rotten egg but I'm looking for the second one to get it actually all right stand up and you can read it further for whosoever will save his life shall lose it uncle whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it Amen so let's all repeat that because it sounds a little tongue twister like it's almost saying something that it's not but it really does so let's all read it ready you repeat after me for whosoever shall shall save his life shall lose it and whosoever and whosoever will lose his life for my name's sake will find it and that's the key there is for my name's sake because as we heard this morning you can do a lot of things in life well if it's not for his name sake it does not matter at all okay so we're going to learn a little story today how many have heard of Zacchaeus or Zacchaeus anybody oh there we go okay so I got three things that he was he was we he was little and he was a man all right come on if you're in God's laboratory you have to be ready to have some fun and learn some things about God how many are excited or should I rename my lab to Andy's lab you know why I think that's the name of God I think his name's Andy you know I what about that song and the walks with me and he talks to me no okay all right okay so let's get right into our time travel we got to open the scriptures so let's turn to Luke 19 I need some water my teeth are stuck into my lips okay give me a second sword let me get some water and by the way if we're the Julius is watching I got the baby tie on it's an inside joke they were baby ties I were a baby tie okay so I'm going to read this one okay to make better time that's what all the brothers do there when they'd like something they go oh so that's a moment okay and we're going to read this and close your eyes I want you to really imagine this because this happened one week well the week before Jesus was crucified he was going through a town called Jericho and it says and Jesus entered and passed to Jericho and behold there was a man named Zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see Jesus who he was and he could not for the press because he was a little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for we he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and said to him Zacchaeus make haste come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it and when all the other people saw it they murmured saying that he was want to be a guest with a sinner and we're going to stop right there okay so we heard this morning that brother Branham was always searching for God in the mountains and anywhere he would go he was always searching well that's pretty much what Zacchaeus was doing he was searching for God because you see Zacchaeus had a very good wife who wanted Zacchaeus to serve the Lord but Zacchaeus he was a rich man he would go play putt-putt with the priests he'd go play volleyball and he was also a great man you know he'd wave like this when he'd go through town and and he would go and do special things for people and they do things for him and you know he would he just wasn't good with everybody in the city so Zacchaeus kind of built himself up but he was short so he wasn't he was a big man stuck in a little body I think we know a few of those people and so Butler so this man Zacchaeus he started to realize that even though he had all this he had friends he had all the things going for him but yet he had a wife at home who was always praying lord I pray that she would help my Zacchaeus to come to see you to know you and to know him like I know you and and that he would fill that emptiness inside of his heart with with you and so one day Zacchaeus got home and and he just wasn't the same normally Zacchaeus was playing around a real jokester but that night he was serious he went straight to bed sucking his thumb and curled up in his bed and his wife said what's wrong with you Zacchaeus oh nothing I don't want to talk about it but she knew because God answers prayers and brother Branham says the prayer of a wife or even a mother will do more than a preacher on the pulpit and so God will hear you the prayers of your mother I know you don't have wives yet and I know you don't have husbands yet but you'll get there one day thanks to the prayer years of your mother so what goes hand-in-hand so that night Zacchaeus was tossing and turning he took some nyquil didn't do nothing yeah it made him stay up even longer so he got up early that morning he's like you know I'm gonna go to McDonald's give me a McMuffin and I'm just gonna you know because Jesus was gonna be coming through there because he was going on his way through Jerusalem where he was later on he's crucified so he was passing and he said I must stay right here because I can see exactly when Jesus comes so he was sitting there drinking his cosmic coffee in and he was he owned the McDonald's actually come to think of it that was his McDonald's and he was sitting right in front of Burger King just watching it because that was his arrival because I should be the Burger King this guy don't know nothing so he was sitting there and here comes Jesus with his disciples oh I'm gonna see what this guy is all about he comes into my town and he thinks he can just do miracles and read people's minds and I'm gonna see what he's about so you know he sits there and he's drinking his coffee and Jesus goes into Burger King and he says oh that I don't even know I can't believe that slimeball who owns Burger King would invite Jesus into his restaurant why wouldn't he come to mind mine's better and the thing was he never invited Jesus so Jesus will only go where he's invited and you've got to invite him into your place give him all that you got but the Burger King owner he invited Jesus so they were more than happy to go there so he sat there and he was all stood up and he was thinking how he could even get back to see Jesus again so he thought well you know what Jesus will be going down this straight Boulevard right here and I'm gonna go and I'm gonna catch him on the other side so Zacchaeus jumped out and he took off his awful of caffeine and he runs and he's standing there he should be going anymore well all kinds of people started coming like a big parade and he was a kiss in the back trying to look and he couldn't see anything because he was a wee little man exact year was a wee little man we let no man was he okay we'll get the rest in a bit so he started walking over there and he couldn't see anything all these people were oh he thought he was in the Land of Nod all these giants but really they were only about five foot so he must have been smaller so as he was looking for these people or he was waiting for Jesus to come and he thought I'm never going to see him this is he says bogus what am I gonna do so he looked to his right and he saw a big tree kind of like this exactly it looked just like this three and he thought huh you know his wheels started turning in his head and and he thought huh maybe I could hide up here oh and and then Jesus says he's a mind reader and he knows all this stuff maybe I'm feeling this tree and let's see how much he really knows let's see if he really knows I'm hiding in there so what Jackies did is he I need a helper who can climb trees like a monkey no you don't have to climb too high I don't want you to break your neck come here all right so what Jackie is did you only have to come to about the second step here and peek your head right through this little hole just like that and hold this so he was standing there like that and he was waiting for Jesus to come because he knew he was going to come sometime because there was only one way in one way out and so can I get some more helpers I'm going to need some disciples so let me get you gentlemen or you can come and what of the Branham says that Paul was a big man and he was protecting Jesus so you're going to be Jesus and you're going to act really because you've been praying for people all day virtue is pulled out of you and all you want to do is go eat and get some sleep so let me get this big brute here this is your party girl this was poor little wimpy I trained him myself because I'm professor Gamaliel so what he did was he led them up and all the while Zacchaeus was in the tree and they stopped here and out of nowhere where's our little girls there's Ali I have her baby that's who I was thinking of come here don't help me I need some help let her borrow your baby then come on you both King come when all of the sudden a little girl comes to Jesus saying my baby it has a fever can you pray for my baby Jesus well Paul wasn't so kind he said no he's tired he's tired you you surely would say please Jesus pray for my baby it has a fever so at that moment Jesus raised up his head and he said bring the baby to me and all he did was he touched the blanket that's all he had to do and the baby came back to life and she ran home happy so you guys can take your seat so over here it's all good everything is nice and beautiful but over here he is going through a storm in his mind because he just built Jesus up to be some kind of mean evil person well yet he just saw this little baby get her healing so at this point he's thinking man I wish he'd come my way I really didn't want to see him at first but I do now so they came and right under the tree Jesus stops and he says that yes come down from that three seconds come down factory so here comes a kiyose with tears in his eyes and i believe i don't know if you believe this pause the scene but brother Branham says Jesus had a face so powerful that if he would speak the world would just end but yet it was so sweet and kind that it was just beautiful and I believe he's looked into those eyes and his heart just melted like wax and he came through Jesus and he gave him a big hug and he said Lord I want to follow you and if I've ever done wrong please forgive me I will give back to the poor what I have stolen and I want to be a better person and from that day on Zacchaeus served the Lord you guys can have a seat thank you so that's what's so beautiful about this story is that Zacchaeus had climbed up his three of pride he thought he was so great but yet Jesus just simply called him down and Jesus never even knew Zacchaeus or he didn't know or I shouldn't say that he had never met Zacchaeus before but the Spirit of God that was in him lose a kiss from before the foundation of the world and he stopped right there and he called them down by his name and that's what's so beautiful is that the Lord knows each and every one of you and he calls you by name and he makes you one of his disciples to follow him and that's what's so great about this so how many want to sing the song with me we're going to sing Zacchaeus was a wee little man all right but you got to stand up all right ready there's some little are you going to play it for us all right so I'm gonna say Zacchaeus was a wee little man you're gettin get your ring is a wheel the man was he he climbed
