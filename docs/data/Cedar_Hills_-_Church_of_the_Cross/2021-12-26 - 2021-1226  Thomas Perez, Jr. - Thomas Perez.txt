of that sufficient we're thankful that god has permitted us to to do this and all of you have been an equal part of this this effort that we have hey man so we're we're grateful to each and every one of you there was i believe 26 27 pastors that have passed away and you see how excited they got with some rice and some sugar you know when you don't have those things it's a great deal and so on i love when brother brother david starts going glory there is we won't keep you very long this morning and those fridays have been out of this world amen so we're grateful to god there's no reason why you shouldn't eat we've been eating king's food before we forget greetings from brother basil brother julius brother marvin and we're very grateful once again for the confidence this morning that our pastor has shown in us and it reads like this and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity but the greatest of these is love so i would like to entitle my message the greatest of these we're grateful lord jesus to be here this morning happy to be in your house grateful to have heard what we have been hearing and thankful that our our desire is simply to come and serve you and how as the years go by we will be able to do that and so lord in commemoration of that great day of resurrection we stand here as benefactors of that resurrection greatness thankful for all your many blessings precious name we pray amen now i we we we trust in the lord we've we've had many great things happen to us this year we uh many great events have happened and we this is the last sunday of 2021 this next year we we we we come with we should come with fresh vision and we we've already our pastor has already said that this would be the capstone this would be love a baptism to to to to do away with anything that we we know of no yes but this year is just about already gone we pray that that our problems our complexes are hang-ups little foxes that spoil the vine the things that so but i believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and i believe that his words do matter today my wife she she she she came to uh to a a new crossroads this year and she's as beautiful and lovely as ever before and we've had great steps that we have gone my revelation hasn't changed now i do believe that in revelation but i believe that revelation is progressive i believe that there is a firm foundation upon revelation but i believe that that revelation should carry you to newness from faith to faith from glory this is the greatest thing that i understand about the scripture that god almighty left his throne i still after all these years of preaching can never get past that that we can have very great grasp of the message of the that is the first action of love we can say that god is many things as much as many adjectives are consuming fires these many of these and that is one characteristic that you can always i'm not talking nobody wants to love them it seems like there's been a disconnect connection between god and man but jesus brother branham says jesus could touch the holy god how many were happy with 2021 2021 was good how many are going to be happier in 2022. you haven't been there yet you know the bible tells us that when joshua commands the people when they were going to cross the uh the jordan but even another door opens and it can bring a lot of promise along the first step towards getting somewhere is to decide you're not going to stay where you are can i say it again the first step for getting somewhere is to decide you're not going to stay where you are now if i struggle because if we could stay in 2021 for the next 100 years everybody would be happy it'll cause you to love your enemy you're not my enemy cause you to love those that despitefully used you it'll cause you to speak of those that persecute you and to speak of them well it's a new season it's a new challenge it's a new time what but it'll put you in the track that there will come a time when you believe everything is finished that will be the beginning henry ford said this failure is the opportunity is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently do you know that that the great sam walton which is the founder of of uh walmart and grandstand welcome to california club a walmart sam's club they said he went bankrupt i don't know three four times but he never gave up now they're the richest family in america if that when you come to the basis of the scripture an understanding to go and hang around people that might not like you it might cause you to love somebody that you might not like but one thing it will cause you to do this is a new dispensation and habakkuk tells us as we know for the vision is yet for an appointed time in six months we are going to step on the shores of norway for the first time in statesmen this year by the help of almighty god to choose me just forget me i cannot go back in time and say why did you choose me by this time the vision has already provided the provision when you come to the basis and i i need to things don't happen just to happen there was any foundation now those itself it it causes you when when you start understanding the scripture every place the commission is the same here as it is here every place have you ever walked where you're supposed to be have you ever walked your territory of where you're supposed to be every place that the soul of your when you look to the promise of god it puts you in your future when you walk into it is the revelation you have to have good seed time and i'll tell you in this church we had good seed time we had a man that planted a lot of seeds god speaks to moses right before the passover shall be unto you the beginning of months foster that principle it shall be the first month of the year to you but i don't want to be the same person in 2022 that i wasn't twenty-one god in his rich mercy has given us great things but for sure it'll bring you to another condition have not i commanded thee be of good courage this is the wind balloon if i can tell you this this this morning we are cells nosotros mismo are encountering great challenges estamos encontrandos en controndo grandes retos again in june we will step into norway for the first time but we won't be the first to stand in norway norway will be the second one the third however in order we come in but let me tell you who's already there jesus christ who is the same yesterday today and forever it's already in your tomorrow and as he is today he'll wait for you tomorrow and he is in 2021 thomas and it continues the cycle but when we come here under what god wants us to do today covers sometimes our our church or maybe our minds are divided and and maybe he he knows nothing of the world but the world is inside of him then you get another person and maybe has become had gone into the world and done all kinds of mess how do you bring these two people into a reconciliation with god does this person deserve more love than this he brings the forgiven [Applause] covering it's just to say brother it's just i i me and you are the only ones that know her so i i'm going to cover you but you you better hope that this brother never uncovers because it is you brings us then into a unity you know when you hear brother branham say yesterday god called me to unite the body of christ yesterday i was wondering if we belong in that message see those potentials didn't throw this demonstrated somebody told me a while ago there's a difference between being a follower and being a believer i'm not just a follower i am a believer yes i don't just follow the signs follow me i am the message of brother branham so the unity and those that's the hardest thing to do the passenger will tell you pastor will tell him he'll tell you how do you bring these two factions together the same amount of denominations in the pentecostals you're coming to the message there is everybody's got a better better way to do things this is the challenge it is for brethren to dwell in unity when is we get happy because we got a tingle in our back uh it but it is like the precious ointment upon the head here let me let me tell you how much you have to get what is how much oil was that question that's not going to bring you to the challenge of the new day it is like the anointing oil that was on his head get this induced in other words they kept on pouring it i used to get on the remainder that's what gives you possession it's not just your foot it's the anointing that is on the right foot whatever he did wherever he walked holiness to the lord holiness now we read a little bit can't oh no no no why because the other foot hasn't been anointed and the other eye hasn't been and the other ear hasn't been there but when the is [Applause] and i got my own ideas how do i think of these properties and i got my own way to go but as the due of hermann and as the do that descended upon the mountains of zion why would he call the zion because zion was the gathering place okay i gotta do it again every time all of this the israelis talked about gathering getting together talked about zion what is it that is coming into our time the bible speaks to us about dispensations in which a particular that what does god want to happen in your life in 2022 the bible talks about that in the dispensation of the fullness united union now before we can be united in christ he's got to unite our body spirit and soul because our body our soul and our spirit on sunday morning says hallelujah the comes and each one gets a little harder he comes to the lion defeats the lion from the lion he comes to the bear alley from the bear he comes to the giant but if he would have ran away from the lion he would have never bastard the giant and when he comes did he have anything did he have a robe not yet but he was already being clothed within without and upon and they were speaking about this and they said don't listen to brother branham no economic because his tapes will confuse you he said but a friend of mine [Applause] but the challenge fell upon a man's ears that had experience he was not 56 years old nothing is in context he was 15 years old but the lion and the bear leon had already looked inside of a 15 year old boy when he heard the challenge bring a guy over here bring one guy and i'll feed him to the birds of the air but in his time he said it don't happen today because it's my time and i'd say this as the church of the living god they don't happen in your time it don't happen now how then can it be and touches come up what he said brother branham preaches and you know this and i gotta i gotta say it's the second song real quick but he preaches one two three four five six and he says now this is the last age now it's the rights of the people i got you have a right legal right in new mexico to go and smoke marijuana if you wanted to know this he comes here's the attorney now in the church age and like that not in the laodicean churches but in the last church age in order in other words if there are some of you thinking that you're going to be the eighth especially let me open this this open door for you and let you know that this urge is already open now i wonder how many of us in that room setting back their little dust bonnet unlike the country woman wear there and here's my bible as a servant of god raise your hands i know your belief she wasn't there when the squirrel came into existence but she was there when he spoke and when he spoke it it took her back to the occasion that it happened and she steps into the vision and when she i watched my papa said this don't forget africa they have a great part to do with the resurrection i did not have that vision no i didn't have that baby god didn't give me that vision of me but as he spoken we stepped into the vision and trauma no because hope can't even can't even you can't even place it with with faith it's just like an enemy of faith but what brings faith gets tailored to today loved us in the moral of us when when when when when when nothing else could help but my mother must be on you that i'm going to tell you again when nothing else could help uplift so brother branham hey the spoken word of god he says where do you want those squirrels right there right there right there right there and that didn't happen one time it happened six times how concealed but they weren't visions but she's got to go back to the happening she goes back to the happening dispensation that was for her you know you know you know when when you say when people say did did the february 28th 1963 happen i say yes sir i was there yesterday yes you tell me did it happen physically if to you it's up to you it's up to you yes australis can i say this again you ask it and thus saith the lord i'll speak it behind you and you have it she said the salvation of my two boys and those two little modern teenage nickel fritz boys and scream the blessings of god yo nunca in all my life and ptolemy had felt such anointing the first time it was ever performed on a human being i believe that the church of the living god now god's called us to go around the world how grandma you haven't it's gonna it's not if you think i'm right and you're wrong upon the clothing but he's calling you into a new dispensary that's going to shake the whole world it's been since the days of jesus of nazareth to a human being don't let nobody tell you no if i have offended anyone which i i i you you we say if i know that i've offended your resume you already know what you've done when you hear it those challenging words but united
