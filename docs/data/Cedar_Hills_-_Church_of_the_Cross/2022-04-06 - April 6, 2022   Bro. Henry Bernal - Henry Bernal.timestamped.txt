[36:05] me
[36:06] [Applause]
[36:18] [Music]
[36:33] [Music]
[36:37] [Applause]
[36:43] [Music]
[36:51] [Music]
[37:04] every one of you this this
[37:06] evening
[37:20] that
[37:33] let's start with
[37:34] that it's simple a simple thing but uh
[37:38] means a lot
[37:42] no i don't believe that
[37:44] coming to church is not coming to church
[37:45] is going to save you or not
[37:50] but if you have a place to congregate
[37:52] yes join it you go
[37:53] [Music]
[37:55] it's uh you you we get strength we get
[37:58] food
[38:02] and uh
[38:03] it's is a good thing
[38:05] and we need it more now than ever before
[38:11] the day will come that we cannot
[38:13] congregate
[38:16] and uh it's getting
[38:18] like that
[38:21] very very fast
[38:23] uh i really don't know where i'm gonna
[38:26] start here no no
[38:28] uh
[38:43] and if you knew
[38:50] [Music]
[39:26] is
[39:31] [Music]
[39:40] maybe for many of you
[39:45] you see oh more colombians are
[39:47] they're coming
[39:50] it's more than that
[39:54] it's not
[40:09] because those are the consequences
[40:11] of his work
[40:14] and his friendship with brother fabian
[40:18] and that is that says a lot uh
[40:22] for the brothers that have come it's a
[40:24] blessing
[40:26] colombia the brothers that have come
[40:28] from colombia
[40:29] not just
[40:31] today's past
[40:34] sisters
[41:17] and i think the benefits of that event
[41:20] it blesses me
[41:27] so one day you can hear the testimony of
[41:28] these tremendous families
[41:31] just as many of you love
[42:00] sister
[42:04] what we see
[42:06] simply magnifies the lord yes in
[42:08] testimonial and it's a testimony
[42:11] of the faith that we believe is
[42:17] [Applause]
[42:41] but he was going to give us a lot more
[42:42] time when he got here
[42:46] in general
[42:49] each one of us has a story
[42:52] and we have a journey
[42:55] we all have a testimony
[43:02] also another gentleman
[43:05] that we a gentleman we've known for some
[43:06] time now
[43:08] um welcome back
[43:10] i'm gonna switch to english
[43:12] the reason why
[43:15] i
[43:16] am spanish-speaking person
[43:19] but i preach in english
[43:22] because i learned to study the message
[43:24] and the bible in english
[43:38] i don't like the middle man when i
[43:39] cannot access brother brandon myself
[43:45] so that's why i had effort and i had
[43:47] learned obedience
[43:50] brother tommy always said just study and
[43:52] learn it in english
[43:56] so i thank god for him
[44:00] uh i don't want to keep you standing so
[44:02] long forgive me
[44:05] i just want to take a scripture from
[44:06] brotherland
[44:09] domingo you're so kind
[44:12] and turn to the book of hebrews
[44:17] chapter 12
[44:26] you simply reach like this
[44:29] we're for seeing we also are compatible
[44:32] with so great cloud of witnesses
[44:35] let us lay aside every weight and the
[44:37] sin which does so easily beset us and
[44:39] let us run with patience the race that
[44:41] is set before us
[44:43] [Music]
[44:48] this
[45:03] to the reading of his word you may be
[45:04] seated
[45:06] [Music]
[45:09] we read the letters lay aside every week
[45:30] of it
[45:33] as far as you can throw it
[45:35] and as soon as you can do it
[45:38] yeah it's uh it's uh it's like if you've
[45:40] got a spider on you you don't like
[45:42] spiders
[45:58] the message is that we have to
[46:00] go back and listen and just really get
[46:02] every detail
[46:08] capture my attention
[46:10] because it says let aside every weight
[46:14] [Music]
[46:27] that's not the way we're talking about
[46:29] it
[46:31] because i've said it before and i i
[46:33] used to say like a joke but it started
[46:35] to be kind of reality
[46:39] i used to say that to lose weight
[46:43] or yeah to lose weight it was it was
[46:45] like uh when someone
[46:48] gets free from demons
[47:04] [Music]
[47:22] special
[47:24] it's uh it's such a serious word
[47:28] because uh
[47:29] how we deal with it
[47:33] which is very lightly yes
[47:36] and it's
[47:47] what would that mean yes significant
[47:52] most people say william branham
[47:55] uh within branham but no it simply means
[47:58] weight and balance
[47:59] significa
[48:01] it's a it's a very simple thing
[48:04] that kills a lot of people
[48:10] in a very simple way
[48:14] i want to to maybe approach this
[48:18] approximately
[48:21] i had
[48:22] i was able to visit with brother caleb
[48:24] just for a little bit before he left
[48:28] and somebody somewhat we got in this
[48:30] subject for about five minutes
[48:46] but the scripture says let us lay aside
[48:48] or get rid of the weight
[48:58] it actually says that so easily
[49:37] so
[49:38] are we as strong as we claim to be
[49:43] or is this weight really stronger than
[49:46] than we are or is the peso
[49:48] nosotros
[49:50] well let's see with the help of the lord
[49:55] he'll he'll we can get through it uh
[49:58] maybe it'll help someone here
[50:01] but this weight rest
[50:03] what we need to get rid of
[50:07] the bible gives us gives us uh clues or
[50:10] what to do or
[50:21] says
[50:23] we're for laying aside
[50:43] and as newborn babes
[50:45] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[50:48] you may grow thereby is so we have
[50:51] tasted that the lord is gracious
[51:07] i understand it in a simple way
[51:11] that
[51:12] to get rid of this
[51:15] maybe
[51:17] some of you
[51:20] that are already in a condition that are
[51:22] waiting for the rest of us
[51:25] you don't have no
[51:26] malice or hypocrisy or envies or evil
[51:29] speaking
[51:32] maybe this is not for you
[51:59] so
[52:00] as we go in the scriptures
[52:02] in the
[52:18] says that
[52:20] proverbs 16 11 proverbial
[52:23] onsen
[52:24] says that a just weight and balance are
[52:27] the lords
[52:30] it is
[52:41] the book of proverbs 20 23 proverbial
[52:45] 23s says diver's weights are obama an
[52:48] abomination unto the lord
[52:54] and a false balance is not good
[53:12] as a
[53:13] carrying all this weight
[53:17] it's it's very hard
[53:19] as much as we try
[53:22] you hear people say
[53:24] oh i've been in this message for 40
[53:26] years
[53:31] and then you meet people that grew up
[53:32] with them
[53:36] and they said oh he's been like that all
[53:38] his life
[53:41] she's is she's done that all since i've
[53:43] known her
[53:46] so so young people openness don't ever
[53:49] let anybody
[53:50] here and i
[53:52] try to pull seniority on you because
[53:54] because they've been in the message
[53:56] longer than you
[53:58] said
[54:02] it doesn't work like that
[54:06] society names families time in the
[54:09] message that that means absolutely
[54:11] nothing
[54:17] it can actually mislead people
[54:21] but christ
[54:23] dealing through people
[54:24] [Music]
[54:28] he's got families he's got men he's got
[54:30] sisters
[54:33] to bring forth what he promised the same
[54:35] yesterday today and forever
[54:45] if that was the case the 11 hours worker
[54:47] that scripture would have to get rid of
[55:42] but i don't mean
[55:44] uh in a way to be misunderstood no no no
[56:41] because i'm a man
[57:22] the problem is that we like to hide
[57:24] behind things
[57:28] and when things don't go as we planned
[57:30] it
[57:33] then we also said where brother lance
[57:34] said
[57:38] and
[57:58] there were some years ago
[58:00] that uh brother branham gave some
[58:02] measurements for certain
[58:04] um
[58:06] crack in the ocean
[58:12] they said the san andreas fault is going
[58:13] to go this way it's going to go down
[58:15] under the
[58:16] the fault
[58:19] why is
[58:26] i mean that goes thousands of miles
[58:28] longer than that yeah so while a meal
[58:30] the
[58:31] meal is the
[58:32] uh the mia is muscular and he doesn't
[58:34] cut what he said he cuts
[58:37] that's the san francisco
[58:40] san francisco the false prophet
[58:43] good man but the false prophet
[58:46] about seven years ago
[58:58] and it was in a very strong earthquake
[59:02] but it was strong enough to wake up
[59:04] science
[59:08] because through the years they said
[59:09] these two faults have nothing to do with
[59:11] each other
[59:16] no function
[59:30] um this fault actually is a continuation
[59:33] of the san andreas fault
[59:38] and if this was to break through here
[59:42] it's gonna make a crack of this
[59:44] measurement
[1:00:10] then we need to be more cautious how we
[1:00:13] say that
[1:00:17] because it is it's not fair to put
[1:00:20] in men that have such gifts and such
[1:00:22] ministries
[1:00:26] ministerial
[1:00:44] so all these things really
[1:00:47] bring weight on us
[1:00:51] let's let's go through the meaning of
[1:00:53] weight
[1:00:53] more significantly the peso
[1:00:56] weight vessel
[1:00:58] they say that is the amount that things
[1:01:01] weigh yes
[1:01:08] it's uh
[1:01:10] it's uh how they classify contestants in
[1:01:13] a sport
[1:01:19] like boxing
[1:01:21] it is the pondage required to
[1:01:33] is also
[1:01:35] is usually specified a certain amount
[1:01:40] specifically it's a heavy object
[1:01:44] it's a unit of weight or mass
[1:01:49] it's a piece of material
[1:01:51] material
[1:01:53] that is used to balance things
[1:01:57] it's uh something heavy
[1:02:00] weight is also a burden
[1:02:03] or a pressure
[1:02:19] you know how it is you see somebody
[1:02:20] weighs 400 pounds
[1:02:23] just totally
[1:02:26] no shape whatsoever
[1:02:29] but because he weighs 400 pounds
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:51] there's a lot of this is the this is the
[1:02:53] definitions of the dictionary
[1:02:57] uh something oppressed
[1:03:00] a burden
[1:03:02] the increase of heaviness
[1:03:10] balance balance is known as physical
[1:03:13] equilibrium this is
[1:03:31] we say the right balance on a diet and
[1:03:33] exercise
[1:03:37] in accounting is is to be equal in the
[1:03:39] totals in numbers
[1:03:56] [Music]
[1:04:07] to equalize
[1:04:09] [Music]
[1:04:12] uh
[1:04:13] to have a balance between good times and
[1:04:14] bad times
[1:04:17] and if you go to the dictionary there is
[1:04:19] 100 definitions of weight and balance
[1:04:24] definition
[1:04:47] the meaning of weight and balance the
[1:04:49] significance of the peso
[1:04:52] on solid ground in in
[1:04:55] solidarity while you're on the ground
[1:05:00] now an airplane
[1:05:04] a bird flies
[1:05:20] it has weight in a peso
[1:05:23] but the meaning of weight on the ground
[1:05:25] is significant of the peso el piso it's
[1:05:27] one thing
[1:05:29] that's when you're flying yes
[1:05:33] all these meanings those
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:49] is simplest by intellect the intel uh
[1:05:52] intelligencia uh in helping somebody
[1:05:55] understand the meaning
[1:05:59] of significant when you take weight and
[1:06:01] balance
[1:06:17] or we stand around
[1:06:21] well the line was preaching
[1:06:24] when we go on the trip
[1:06:26] we just load as much as we can
[1:06:40] and baskets and cylinders
[1:06:44] and anything that could be defined as a
[1:06:47] container
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:50] and we still whenever we get to where we
[1:06:52] go
[1:06:54] on the vamos we still go to the store
[1:06:55] and gotta get more
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:26] three days
[1:07:29] that's how we travel yes
[1:07:32] and if we go for longer than that
[1:07:35] yeah
[1:07:35] see
[1:07:37] but the scripture said to get rid of
[1:07:40] stuff
[1:07:52] it actually unloads to take flight
[1:08:08] and has prey
[1:08:11] and he's taking it to the nest
[1:08:14] or drag it out where he can eat it
[1:08:18] but when he's when he's going to take
[1:08:20] the height
[1:08:21] he's going to fly high but
[1:08:25] it requires as
[1:08:27] little weight as possible
[1:08:31] an eagle or birds in general they even
[1:08:33] pluck some of the feathers if they
[1:08:35] become an obstacle our
[1:09:06] i don't know if you've been at the
[1:09:07] airport
[1:09:10] when customers are fighting with the
[1:09:12] airlines
[1:09:13] [Music]
[1:09:17] because of the weight because of the bag
[1:09:20] because they thing is a
[1:09:22] f-350 with a trailer
[1:09:29] it's very it's a limited thing
[1:09:33] if an airplane has too much cargo too
[1:09:35] much too much people and too many bags
[1:09:39] he has to get rid of a lot of fuel
[1:09:45] yeah he can bring a lot of fuel if he
[1:09:47] has a lot of bags
[1:09:51] so what i want to where i want to get to
[1:09:53] this
[1:09:55] i really want to really get to one point
[1:09:59] and all this that i'm saying is for a
[1:10:00] reason and i'll say it at the end
[1:10:04] it's it's it's that this weight is the
[1:10:07] peso what we deal with
[1:10:10] uh we say well we're humans we've got to
[1:10:12] deal with the things of a human
[1:10:26] and we take that as a priority
[1:10:46] and but we still talk about things like
[1:10:48] we know it you know
[1:10:53] and and but then we live our lives
[1:11:10] and he says let's compare something it
[1:11:12] is
[1:11:14] in the god in the message is your life
[1:11:16] worthy of the gospel
[1:11:20] he said let's compare something
[1:11:23] said one time
[1:11:29] let's compare the life of saint paul and
[1:11:31] the rich young rulers
[1:11:36] the same light stroke struck both men
[1:11:42] both had the same invitation from jesus
[1:11:44] christ
[1:11:47] is that right
[1:11:49] they both
[1:11:50] was well trained in the scriptures
[1:11:52] established
[1:11:58] remember jesus told the rich young ruler
[1:12:00] keep my commandments
[1:12:05] he said i've done this for my youth
[1:12:09] there's a coven he was a trained man
[1:12:12] so was saint paul
[1:12:15] both well trained in the scriptures
[1:12:19] but both of them had the words
[1:12:22] when had it from knowledge
[1:12:25] the other one had it
[1:12:26] had the germ alive in it
[1:12:31] and when the light flashed across in
[1:12:33] front of paul when
[1:12:59] this is where i want you to keep this in
[1:13:01] mind or or just take this for yourself
[1:13:06] church spiritual
[1:13:08] spiritual church natural iglesias
[1:13:11] the rich man
[1:13:13] rico had his excuse
[1:13:16] he couldn't do it
[1:13:28] going to jump to paul now he says but
[1:13:30] paul
[1:13:31] pablo when the light struck him
[1:13:35] let's compare his life and see whether
[1:13:37] he's worthy what happened
[1:13:41] when paul when the pablo when light
[1:13:43] strokes struck him
[1:13:53] he walked in the spirit of jesus christ
[1:13:56] and the spirit glory to god
[1:14:00] and that is something
[1:14:02] that as simple as it is
[1:14:05] we need to bring it to our day
[1:14:08] we're not living in times no
[1:14:11] of things to come
[1:14:14] all the things that were to come
[1:14:17] are here
[1:14:19] am i
[1:14:20] they're already here
[1:14:22] because the protection that we have the
[1:14:23] protection
[1:14:25] we don't see what other people is having
[1:14:26] to face
[1:14:30] and this scripture of lay aside all this
[1:14:33] weight is so important
[1:14:37] because we talked about
[1:14:40] going away
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:32] he's already
[1:17:42] whoa
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:44] these are some big chicken wings
[1:17:48] and she
[1:17:49] used them and and all of a sudden she's
[1:17:51] up in the air
[1:17:54] and then the nature took over
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:10] that's not what i'm
[1:18:52] comes
[1:18:55] you know those wings and salas are just
[1:18:58] as good as the buffalo sauce and the
[1:18:59] ranch dressing
[1:19:06] because they cannot
[1:19:08] help the chicken take flight
[1:19:11] it doesn't matter how much a chicken can
[1:19:13] talk
[1:19:17] there is a difference
[1:19:20] and
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:52] [Music]
[1:20:02] just throw them up in the air as high as
[1:20:04] we could
[1:20:08] and then we were trying to catch him
[1:20:11] i don't think we lost one
[1:20:14] but we learned that chickens don't fly
[1:20:16] demons
[1:20:31] is not to go up into higher air
[1:20:38] all this is that i'm saying
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:40] it's because
[1:20:43] the seriousness of the time that we live
[1:20:45] in
[1:20:45] like
[1:20:49] the events that we anticipate
[1:20:53] are serious
[1:20:56] all this already taking place
[1:21:00] and we know that the ending of the
[1:21:02] gentiles is coming to an end
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:09] and we are aware of the events that
[1:21:11] already started to take place
[1:21:26] but we are closing that well
[1:21:30] we know that when the
[1:21:32] door closes to the gentiles
[1:21:37] we are very familiar with these terms
[1:21:45] as well as resurrection and rapture
[1:21:49] and we hear these words
[1:21:52] and we know what they refer to
[1:21:54] look as significant
[1:21:56] but
[1:21:57] through the years especially through
[1:21:58] these last couple of years
[1:22:03] and in some of these recent
[1:22:05] conversations with different brothers
[1:22:06] and sisters
[1:22:08] sentiment
[1:22:10] i find that people especially christians
[1:22:14] especially
[1:22:15] are more prepared for judgment and
[1:22:17] tribulation
[1:22:21] because it's easy to understand
[1:22:30] if you are a person that lives already
[1:22:33] at higher levels
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:56] so we identify with those
[1:22:58] natural events
[1:23:02] so a lot of people as you hear them
[1:23:04] scucha their conversation
[1:23:07] is like yeah we're going to rapture but
[1:23:09] just in case it's a conversation
[1:23:13] i'm buying some extra food
[1:23:19] and then and then and then you know you
[1:23:20] never know it gets bad i mean i
[1:23:22] as much bullets as i can buy i'm i'm
[1:23:26] i'm collecting them
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:32] and and if i make enough money i'm gonna
[1:23:33] i'm gonna turn my truck into one of
[1:23:35] those apocalypse trucks
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:43] for the apocalypse
[1:23:46] and always there's this plan b in the
[1:23:48] back of the head
[1:23:52] or in the front of the head because a
[1:23:53] lot of times he's just wide open
[1:23:58] oh praise the lord resurrection and the
[1:24:00] rapture is coming
[1:24:04] but let's keep this just in case
[1:24:07] we're not bribed
[1:24:12] and
[1:24:13] really
[1:24:15] do we have those questions in our mind
[1:24:19] but if i ask who's bride the whole
[1:24:20] congregation is going to raise both
[1:24:22] hands
[1:24:26] we're going to just scream as loud as we
[1:24:27] can
[1:24:45] this gives us a little more extra
[1:24:47] attitude
[1:24:51] because we think that we're more than
[1:24:53] others
[1:24:56] we judge
[1:25:23] i
[1:25:24] heard this from brother branham
[1:25:27] branham the pastor told me
[1:25:29] all these things
[1:25:31] they're fine
[1:25:33] as long as your feet are on the ground
[1:25:38] i'll tell you that's why the sheep
[1:25:40] why don't you take weight and balance to
[1:25:42] the air
[1:25:45] there's no room for mistake no i can't
[1:25:48] err
[1:25:49] most people die getting off the ground
[1:25:52] much agent
[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:20] is what they tell gravity
[1:26:24] that's what science calls gravity
[1:26:27] which is the way that will hold you to
[1:26:29] the earth
[1:26:32] that's all there is
[1:26:34] all these
[1:26:48] because
[1:27:17] is nothing but a condition
[1:27:18] is a condition that can keep you
[1:27:20] centered
[1:27:22] in the center
[1:27:24] and in this condition
[1:27:26] condition you can't lean too much to the
[1:27:28] right
[1:27:30] too
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:28:12] do not count when your feet lift the
[1:28:14] ground
[1:28:17] you know you only need to be about 10
[1:28:19] feet off the ground to die
[1:28:55] then weight means something else
[1:28:59] here on earth
[1:29:00] your feet
[1:29:02] yes or if you sit down
[1:29:04] if you lay down
[1:29:06] or if you do a handstand
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:22] it out you know that way you don't push
[1:29:24] through through the earth
[1:29:28] that's that's what keeps it the floor is
[1:29:29] the floor is what's keeping you from
[1:29:31] sinking
[1:29:35] so yeah so we're pretty brave
[1:29:40] but
[1:29:41] when that floor comes from under you
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:46] and you don't want to fall you know
[1:29:48] what do you do yes
[1:29:51] the same thing the eagle did
[1:29:53] he know it wasn't a chicken
[1:29:58] your wings
[1:30:00] something else need to develop
[1:30:04] something else
[1:30:18] all the new testament testament the
[1:30:20] bible told us
[1:30:22] it was going to give us wings
[1:30:27] the events that we are facing
[1:30:32] and the reason why i said all this
[1:30:35] is just simply to make this statement
[1:30:37] implemented
[1:30:39] most christians
[1:30:40] christians are more realistically
[1:30:43] preparing
[1:30:46] for
[1:30:47] judgment and tribulation
[1:30:50] then
[1:30:51] for resurrection and rapture
[1:30:55] because those events
[1:30:57] judgment and tribulation
[1:31:00] are natural
[1:31:38] to have visions to have dreams to have
[1:31:40] all these things is true they're there
[1:31:42] for a good purpose
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:50] is your body ready
[1:31:53] to see with your eyes
[1:31:56] someone
[1:32:24] how much more the transformation
[1:32:27] all this is going to take place on this
[1:32:29] body
[1:32:31] until this body cannot tolerate it
[1:32:33] anymore
[1:32:36] brandon says it's going to be an
[1:32:37] excruciating fast
[1:32:52] how is your body going to handle come on
[1:32:56] all this all these pressure of events
[1:32:58] are coming on the squeeze
[1:33:02] not only the physical but the spiritual
[1:33:04] no no no
[1:33:25] we're talking about that that we cannot
[1:33:27] play with things like this
[1:33:31] and i think it behooves us
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:34:16] are you ready don't talk to me with your
[1:34:19] feet on the ground
[1:34:23] let's take this conversation at 18 000
[1:34:25] feet
[1:34:29] where the density of the air is so
[1:34:31] difficult that you can just flip upside
[1:34:33] down and fall when we say
[1:34:37] that
[1:34:39] momentum where the temperature
[1:34:43] where the where the pressure of the
[1:34:45] atmosphere is not like the pressures of
[1:34:47] the earth
[1:34:50] the pressure of an ego
[1:34:52] it's not like oh my gosh
[1:34:54] how am i going to pay that bill i need
[1:34:55] to get another job
[1:35:25] we all got one foot in the world and one
[1:35:27] in church
[1:35:31] because comes monday morning
[1:35:33] after prayer
[1:35:35] you gotta go put your foot on the on
[1:35:37] on the grind
[1:35:55] i don't find anywhere in the scripture
[1:35:59] where unless you get to a total
[1:36:02] consecration
[1:36:06] and total surrender to the lord
[1:36:13] that's what i would like to hear for you
[1:36:15] to hear the testimony of the brothers
[1:36:16] that came bro
[1:36:20] and it will be good for you to listen to
[1:36:22] each other's testimonies
[1:36:23] [Music]
[1:36:36] we
[1:37:04] or looking for prey at 10 000 feet
[1:37:09] uh
[1:37:15] you stand on your feet
[1:37:18] i believe it's a serious thing
[1:37:24] that we check ourselves
[1:37:28] no i don't need to check brother jerry
[1:37:31] let's see what you do
[1:37:47] then the most sufficient person that is
[1:37:49] totally unnecessary yes
[1:37:51] necessarily
[1:37:52] so the scriptures that we read
[1:37:55] so they applied to us
[1:37:58] that they bring to us
[1:38:06] i pray that this this this
[1:38:09] that you take it the best way possible
[1:38:13] is
[1:38:16] i'm not
[1:38:17] saying that i am better than somebody
[1:38:21] neither i'm saying that there's somebody
[1:38:22] else better than me
[1:38:25] we all have a journey
[1:38:29] some of these journeys are have a lot of
[1:38:30] grief in it
[1:38:34] and and and sadness
[1:38:41] and and in this journey there are
[1:38:43] brothers that have gotten tired
[1:38:45] of her
[1:38:47] what do we do
[1:38:49] we talk about them
[1:38:52] like that's going to solve the problem
[1:38:56] we as ministers make so many mistakes
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:00] the thing because we let our
[1:39:01] frustrations out in the pulpit
[1:39:05] [Music]
[1:39:07] in our opinions
[1:39:09] that that is somewhat uh
[1:39:12] the anointing
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:21] he grieves the holy holy spirit
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:38] we have a resurrection and a rapture
[1:39:41] that is not promised to no one else
[1:39:45] but to us
[1:39:46] those that will believe the word
[1:39:50] those that will take the message
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:06] out of it
[1:40:09] except amenos you can lay aside where
[1:40:12] the heart was all the way
[1:40:15] all of it although that's so easily be
[1:40:17] sensitive
[1:40:19] because weight means something
[1:40:34] and he keeps
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:44] let's get used to not having
[1:40:46] the ground under your feet
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:41:02] uh
[1:41:04] somebody have to call it through free
[1:41:05] fall
[1:41:10] and and and and it's something something
[1:41:12] that you experience
[1:41:15] when when there is nothing to support
[1:41:17] you under your feet
[1:41:20] and you have no wings
[1:41:23] you want to go up yes
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:30] well as we get used to it
[1:41:33] not to be so earthbound
[1:41:36] then you start you're going to notice
[1:41:38] that you do have wings
[1:41:41] and and you let them let them extend
[1:41:44] them out
[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:48] those wings make you do things that
[1:41:49] you're not used to
[1:41:54] those those wings takes you places that
[1:41:56] you haven't been to la salazar
[1:42:02] that
[1:42:03] the rapture
[1:42:06] it's for a bunch of inexperienced people
[1:42:08] yes
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:35] [Music]
[1:42:44] [Music]
[1:42:46] but if you were to just let off up in
[1:42:49] the air but i'll see you soon
[1:42:51] and sort of like in the light you have
[1:42:53] what it takes to prove that you're not a
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:43:05] god has given us the supernatural he's
[1:43:07] all around us all the time
[1:43:20] [Music]
[1:43:22] and it's always
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:36] if
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:44:04] would you raise your hand
[1:44:06] would you raise your heart
[1:44:09] would you pray right there with your
[1:44:10] eyes
[1:44:11] on the understand if you need help
[1:44:15] if you need to come to the front the
[1:44:16] front is always open
[1:44:18] is
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:44] there is now a person here that is an
[1:44:47] exception
[1:44:50] because in this journey that we have
[1:44:54] we all have things to deal with
[1:44:58] but while he's still in the throne
[1:45:10] [Music]
[1:45:15] don't spend it
[1:45:16] search it within your heart
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] make sure you have what you think you
[1:45:21] have yes
[1:45:24] make sure that that your heart can match
[1:45:26] what your mouth expresses
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:54] remember that the meeting with the lord
[1:45:59] [Music]
[1:46:11] person that's what the weight needs to
[1:46:12] get rid of
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:16] perfect balance by the word perfect
[1:46:20] what brings us
[1:46:24] that it
[1:46:25] [Music]
[1:46:35] [Music]
[1:46:51] but we have to exercise
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:06] live the natural things aside
[1:47:09] they take care of them
[1:47:13] while we're on this earth
[1:47:15] those things will deal with themselves
[1:47:19] we don't bring none of that
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:34] along with the character
[1:47:36] that we have developed here in these
[1:47:38] victories
[1:47:39] victorious oh if you believe so
[1:47:42] the lord can give you anything you want
[1:47:46] to look i'm your fault
[1:47:48] so look i don't look at your weaknesses
[1:47:51] but search deep and look at your nature
[1:47:54] and if it's super easy
[1:47:56] it comes from god
[1:47:58] and there is nothing that that that can
[1:48:00] stop
[1:48:30] [Music]
[1:48:32] maybe not placed correctly
[1:48:37] father but you see the hearts of your
[1:48:39] children
[1:48:41] i pray lord that you look at the
[1:48:43] sincerity in their hearts
[1:48:47] [Music]
