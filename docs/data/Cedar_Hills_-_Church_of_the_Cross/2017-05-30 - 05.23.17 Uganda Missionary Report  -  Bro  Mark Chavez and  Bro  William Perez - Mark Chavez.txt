old at the NAD Asano's and he gets put out he watchin perfora he's on his own el esta solito that point he's an orphan and I so Punto as well for now he came from the village it'll be no the the pit double yeah into in Entebbe like Entebbe Kampala salut garden TBS home arena and how he got there those soldiers that that they talked about on Sunday had raided that village Kemal gigolos Soldado's ie in Tirana Sevilla and he he watched his sister get raped year like this soldiers el vos woman answered by Allah for so Soldado's and when he tried to do something about it he shot him Cano turtle
