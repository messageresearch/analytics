[5:50] [Music]
[5:52] videos we are brother Mike Herold Mike
[5:56] Herold our brother Freddy contas Freddy
[5:59] contas and our brother Marcus
[6:03] Christopherson
[6:06] marus and we
[6:09] apologize we won't be interpreting these
[6:14] videos due to
[6:19] time and right after the videos we'll
[6:21] have our ministers come
[6:25] up amen God bless
[6:28] you for
[7:00] good morning and God bless you everyone
[7:02] my name is brother Mike Harrell from
[7:05] Phoenix and this is my Africa report um
[7:09] I'd like to start by uh sending uh
[7:11] greetings from brother Tim Perez and the
[7:14] rest of the Phoenix group and then I'd
[7:16] also like to thank uh Pastor Caleb and
[7:20] of course brother Tommy and the rest of
[7:22] the the missionary team that uh that I
[7:25] travel with to Uganda um some of the
[7:28] most amazing guys that I've ever known
[7:30] in my life and then also to
[7:34] um our team there in Uganda uh led by
[7:38] one of the most humble most
[7:41] beautiful uh men that I've ever met in
[7:43] my life uh brother Julius um I'd also
[7:48] like to just State the obvious to me
[7:52] which is we
[7:55] serve a wonderful God that we serve a
[7:59] Living God and I think sometimes we lose
[8:03] sight of that uh with things that we go
[8:06] through and things that we're dealing
[8:08] with I think sometimes we forget who we
[8:11] are and and the the simple fact that our
[8:15] God is
[8:16] real and that our God is always there
[8:18] for us and our God will always take care
[8:20] of us we just have to look for him we
[8:22] have to call on him and and he will be
[8:26] there so if if we could uh I'd like to
[8:30] read a scripture um
[8:33] Claus uh
[8:35] 49-12 and I'm sorry but I'm going to
[8:37] have to read this I wish I could be
[8:39] there in person but unfortunately I
[8:41] wasn't able to make it this weekend so
[8:44] if you would just please kind of bear
[8:45] with me and I kind of jotted down some
[8:47] notes so I wouldn't forget to say some
[8:49] things it's kind of hard to have the
[8:51] Holy Spirit move you when when you're
[8:54] doing everything on video like this
[8:56] but uh Ecclesiastes 4 4 9-12 simply
[9:01] reads two are better than one because
[9:04] they have a good reward for their labor
[9:07] for if they fall the one will lift up
[9:10] his fellow but woe to him that is alone
[9:13] when he
[9:14] falleth for he hath not another to help
[9:17] him up again if two lie together then
[9:21] they have heat but how can one be warm
[9:25] alone and if one Prevail against him two
[9:29] shall withstand him and a three-fold
[9:32] cord is not quickly
[9:35] broken and in this case uh I believe
[9:39] this missionary team that traveled to
[9:41] Africa was a three-fold court if not a
[9:43] 22-fold court if that does exist uh
[9:48] because our first meeting in
[9:51] Uganda which is typically what we do
[9:54] after we arrive in country uh we sit
[9:56] down as a team uh led by Pastor Caleb
[9:59] and he informed us of the vision that
[10:03] that brother Diego had had of the four
[10:05] demons being
[10:07] released and that they would uh commit
[10:11] themselves to being obstacles for us
[10:13] during that missionary trip and for a
[10:17] lot of us those obstacles be and I think
[10:20] some of the brothers have already
[10:21] mentioned it those obstacles began
[10:23] before some of us even bought our
[10:25] tickets as soon as we begin to talk
[10:28] about this trip and the fact that the
[10:31] Lord had placed it on our hearts to
[10:33] go a lot of us began having issues
[10:37] whether it was financially personally
[10:39] whatever a lot of us began having
[10:43] issues
[10:44] um once we arrived in country we had our
[10:48] meeting we started doing our thing um of
[10:52] course as soon as we we connect with the
[10:56] the people of Uganda we go and we go do
[10:58] our our first uh meeting with brother
[11:01] James and his village there and and then
[11:03] we have the first
[11:05] conferences uh I thought last year when
[11:08] I had the opportunity to travel to
[11:10] Uganda that man these people are on fire
[11:12] for the lord well this time was even
[11:15] more so and and I don't think it was
[11:17] just simple fact that it was a you know
[11:20] uh a lot of different people on the team
[11:22] this year uh I don't think that had
[11:25] anything to do with it although you know
[11:27] that was motivation for me
[11:29] uh more motivation but the people there
[11:33] are still hungry for the word the people
[11:35] there are still hungry for the Lord and
[11:38] they make it so easy for us to feel that
[11:43] anointing and to want to be there and to
[11:46] want to work with them and to want to
[11:49] help them uh receive that Revelation
[11:52] that they're looking
[11:54] for um I I love
[11:59] the opportunities that I get to travel
[12:02] like this um one of the things that I
[12:06] that really moved me this time was the
[12:09] simple fact that several Brothers on the
[12:12] team were able to travel and experien
[12:15] this with their sons um I know prior to
[12:18] me leaving and a few times while I was
[12:20] in Uganda my seven-year-old son MJ asked
[12:24] if he could be there with me and I
[12:27] promised him by the time that he turns
[12:30] 15 or 16 years old if the Lord prevails
[12:33] that we will make that trip
[12:36] together
[12:38] um forgive me if the Lord terries that
[12:41] we will make that trip together and
[12:43] after seeing these brothers there with
[12:45] their sons I'm even more motivated to
[12:47] make sure that we're in the position
[12:49] that we need to be in to make that
[12:51] happen when he's old enough to travel um
[12:54] I that's just something that moved my
[12:56] heart and I love seeing
[12:58] it uh um one of the things that
[13:02] that uh
[13:05] also moved me during this trip was the
[13:10] fact that once again I got to get to
[13:13] know brothers that I truly didn't know
[13:16] uh that I've seen at church that I've
[13:19] maybe even had a a brief conversation
[13:22] with shared a hug with shook a hand with
[13:25] I got to know them even better and that
[13:28] makes once again that makes this this
[13:30] type of trip when you're away from your
[13:32] family it makes it even easier to deal
[13:35] with um and I'm going to start with and
[13:37] and please forgive me
[13:39] but
[13:42] uh there's a lot of things that take
[13:44] place on these trips that you know as
[13:46] we're getting to know each other we
[13:47] learn different personalities so forgive
[13:51] me if I humor you just a little bit but
[13:53] it's just something that I really wanted
[13:55] to share with everyone and I'm going to
[13:56] start with young brother Adan I
[13:59] I love that kid I i' seen him a few
[14:01] times on camera I've seen him at church
[14:04] uh didn't know he was brother Mar chabz
[14:06] a son um or at least I didn't remember
[14:09] but one of the things that I loved about
[14:11] Young Brother Adon is is what I started
[14:13] calling him is that kid had the most
[14:17] delicious food on his plate every time
[14:19] we sat down to have a meal now I got to
[14:22] a point to where I I couldn't eat very
[14:24] much towards you know the halfway
[14:26] through the trip but to sit next to that
[14:29] kid or be in an an I view of what he was
[14:32] eating on this plate made me hungry
[14:35] every single time that we had a
[14:38] meal then there was uh Young Brother
[14:42] Paul and you know I've seen uh brother
[14:46] Paul up on the platform before uh during
[14:49] some of the youth services where you
[14:51] know you just see um you kind of see his
[14:56] personality a little bit but to be there
[14:58] and experiences personality in person he
[15:01] is such a dynamic
[15:03] personality and he loves to say Yeah Boy
[15:06] a lot so during this trip Paul had
[15:11] me in laughter pretty much every time I
[15:14] was around him whether we're on the bus
[15:16] traveling or in the hotel just listening
[15:19] to him talking being engaged in
[15:20] conversation with him was just
[15:22] completely humorous to me I love that
[15:25] kid then there's young Ethan who uh
[15:29] course I've been around Ethan several
[15:31] times uh but usually with Ethan he's
[15:34] very stoic when he's around me um and
[15:38] maybe others um you see him he's so
[15:41] professional when he's up on the
[15:42] platform he's going from instrument to
[15:44] instrument or he's lead singing and I
[15:47] I'm honestly really inspired by that kid
[15:50] but to be around Ethan and actually see
[15:53] him crack jokes and laugh and have fun
[15:57] uh was something that I really ired and
[15:59] I love that about him so young Ethan I
[16:02] really really got to know a lot better
[16:05] and then there's my my 5% African
[16:08] brother uh Brother Carlos who uh I will
[16:13] forever
[16:15] uh uh well forever he will be known to
[16:19] me as uh Dr
[16:24] Carlos in the orange vest of safety
[16:29] um because if it hadn't been for Dr
[16:32] Carlos uh my last couple days in Uganda
[16:36] would have been a lot harder uh my
[16:39] travel back would have been close to
[16:43] Impossible uh but Dr Carlos had exactly
[16:46] what I needed to to get my body under
[16:49] control the last two days that we were
[16:51] in country and I thank you brother
[16:53] Carlos God bless you brother I love you
[16:56] uh and I really do appreciate you and
[16:59] then there's uh brother Jerry
[17:03] Delo who will be affectionately known
[17:06] from now on as a wild man because under
[17:11] the
[17:13] anointing of the missionary field I saw
[17:16] aside of brother Jerry that I've never
[17:18] seen before and I absolutely loved it
[17:21] and it was great to get to know brother
[17:23] Jerry uh once again I think the first
[17:27] conversation I ever had with him was
[17:28] that after I gave my testimony uh the
[17:31] first time I see their Hills and he came
[17:33] up and he met me in the pastor's office
[17:35] and gave me a hug and said thank you and
[17:38] after that I don't think we ever really
[17:40] had a
[17:41] conversation uh but on this trip I
[17:43] really got to know him and I love me
[17:45] some brother
[17:47] Jerry and then there's brother Robert
[17:49] and brother Marcos uh from now on to me
[17:52] will be known as The Wrecking Crew
[17:54] because there was not one dinner table
[17:56] that dinner table that those two didn't
[17:59] wreck um those guys can
[18:02] eat uh brother Robert probably had more
[18:06] snacks than any person I've ever met in
[18:07] my life uh and and hopefully I'm not
[18:11] getting anyone in trouble but to see
[18:13] someone sit down and try every dessert
[18:15] on the menu just absolutely blew my mind
[18:18] especially when I was in a situation
[18:20] where I really couldn't eat anymore uh
[18:22] but those guys were great I love their
[18:25] testimonies especially brother Robert I
[18:27] got to talk to him a little bit the back
[18:29] of the bus I love his testimony um I
[18:31] love the fact that the Lord placed it on
[18:34] his heart to go to the radio station and
[18:37] to share that with the people of
[18:40] Africa then there's brother uh Freddy
[18:42] from Norway who probably had the the
[18:47] best protein bars that I've ever had in
[18:49] my life an abundance of protein bars
[18:52] that he shareed with us um but what I
[18:55] really loved about brother Freddy was
[18:57] his spirit uh the simple fact that with
[19:01] everything that we went through in
[19:03] Uganda all of the obstacles we
[19:06] faced we had a moment at the airport
[19:08] coming home where he said to me what
[19:12] brother what what obstacles did we face
[19:15] and to
[19:17] me uh it touched my heart and when I say
[19:20] this I don't mean to be rude or crude
[19:22] but he was totally oblivious
[19:25] to some of the things that we faced
[19:27] while we were there I believe believe
[19:29] and and I don't mean that in a bad way
[19:31] but to me it just shows me his it showed
[19:34] me his Spirit and the fact that he's a
[19:37] kind and loving person and that
[19:39] obviously one that that's not easily
[19:42] agitated or um disturbed by things that
[19:45] are happening and then also to see him
[19:48] interact with the people it didn't
[19:49] matter where we
[19:51] were he found a way and he found time to
[19:54] go and interact with the people and you
[19:57] and I love that about him because you
[19:58] can tell he loved people that he loves
[20:00] people and he's a very caring
[20:03] person and then there's the person that
[20:07] will probably be affectionately known as
[20:12] Dora the Explorer and I mean that out of
[20:15] the kindness of my heart for brother
[20:17] Titus from Fort Collins uh he and I and
[20:21] brother Tim uh were stranded in Doha we
[20:24] had to stay Theon night and if it hadn't
[20:26] been for brother Titus I'm sure brother
[20:28] Tim Garcia and I would have gone
[20:30] straight to the hotel grabbed dinner and
[20:32] gone to bed but brother Titus convinced
[20:34] us to uh tra driver and see the city and
[20:40] have a great uh Bangladesh meal and
[20:43] there something that we probably would
[20:45] not have experienced if it hadn't been
[20:46] for brother Titus so brother Titus my
[20:48] brother I it was great to get to know
[20:50] you I love you God bless you can't wait
[20:53] until we can experience another new town
[20:56] or New City together
[20:59] and then my Primo brother
[21:02] Omar uh I love you brother and once
[21:06] again Primo I forgive you for last year
[21:10] um but I also thank you because if it
[21:13] hadn't been for you last
[21:14] year um really
[21:17] expressing what that type of trip can do
[21:21] to a person I never would have ventured
[21:25] out and and and followed my heart I
[21:29] believe it was the Lord's will for me to
[21:30] go last year as well and I did it but I
[21:33] did it with your help and I really
[21:35] appreciate it it was great to have you
[21:37] there this year hopefully next year we
[21:40] will be there again together um my
[21:43] mother thinks I'm crazy for wanting to
[21:45] go again I I I know she was joking when
[21:48] she said it um but when I told her next
[21:51] year this is what I'm expecting to
[21:53] happen she thought I had lost my mind
[21:56] but uh God willing uh if there's a trip
[21:59] next year I will definitely be
[22:02] there and then
[22:04] um
[22:06] uh I want to just hit on a few things
[22:08] really serious real quick um excuse me
[22:11] and let's start
[22:13] with what I had the opportunity to learn
[22:16] in Uganda um and I don't know for for
[22:20] some that are wavering about going um I
[22:24] would say if the Lord places us on your
[22:25] heart to go to Uganda or any missionary
[22:28] trip
[22:29] that you do it because I learned so
[22:33] much on these the last two trips that
[22:36] I've taken there these are things that
[22:37] I'll carry with me
[22:39] forever uh but as the the brothers there
[22:42] are learning I'm also learning I'm
[22:44] taking notes and I'm learning about
[22:46] church order and I'm I got to hear about
[22:49] the the dimensions again and things like
[22:51] that and to hear the brothers from Gulu
[22:54] uh some of the questions that they posed
[22:56] to the missionary team that we we we we
[22:59] grouped up we we separated into groups
[23:01] and we addressed some of the questions
[23:03] that they had um with the help of of uh
[23:07] brother Jimmy who we also missed and
[23:09] brother Abraham um a Elder um it was
[23:14] awesome to be able to to see the
[23:18] questions that they had and to seek the
[23:21] answers uh for them to help them receive
[23:24] that Revelation was very rewarding for
[23:26] us and that's something that I will
[23:28] always cherish as
[23:30] well and then
[23:34] um to be a part of
[23:38] the the placing of the Bible in the
[23:41] Cornerstone to experience what that
[23:43] meant to the people of manafa um to
[23:46] experience what that meant to the people
[23:49] that are part of our team that
[23:51] participated in that to have one of the
[23:54] customade pens that my wife made uh for
[23:59] the for brother Caleb for pastor Caleb
[24:01] uh to hand out to the church two years
[24:03] ago to have one of those pens placed in
[24:05] that Bible and placed in the Cornerstone
[24:07] uh is something that I'll always
[24:09] remember and always cherish um I I I've
[24:12] never imagined myself being a part of
[24:14] something so special um and something
[24:17] that that means so much to someone else
[24:21] to be a part of that for me is
[24:23] lifechanging um and I I think everyone
[24:27] should have an opportunity to experience
[24:29] that so if the Lord places it on your
[24:31] heart to make that trip please
[24:35] do and then uh last but not least um for
[24:41] brother
[24:43] will uh you said something very profound
[24:47] uh when you spoke the other night um and
[24:50] I'm just going to read this because I
[24:52] don't want to mess it up um but you
[24:54] spoke about the finding the founding
[24:57] Pastor Le a
[25:00] Heritage and and I simply wrote sadly
[25:02] for me I didn't have the honor of
[25:04] knowing him however I did have the the
[25:07] honor of knowing his brother uh who's
[25:10] also my wife's grandfather brother
[25:11] Michael Perez
[25:14] and the amazing sons that he has Pastor
[25:18] Caleb brother Tommy and brother will the
[25:22] opportunity to be
[25:23] around uh these men and the ministry
[25:28] that the founding Pastor has formed at
[25:30] Cedar
[25:32] Hills um and having the opportunity to
[25:35] learn from each and every one of them um

[26:28] [Applause]
[26:36] good morning friends God bless
[26:39] you a week before traveling to Uganda I
[26:42] spoke with brother Tommy Jr I wanted to
[26:46] ask some questions about the food about
[26:50] uh certain practical things and
[26:53] something that uh couch uh couch my
[26:56] attention was what uh that brother Tommy
[26:59] told me that when you return from Africa
[27:03] you return a better person a better
[27:07] father a better
[27:09] son a better husband a better neighbor
[27:13] it makes an impact having that
[27:16] experience of being in
[27:18] Uganda to see and witness how God is
[27:22] working through this ministry in Uganda
[27:25] in a special and particular way and the
[27:29] fruit that is
[27:32] giving I do not take things
[27:35] lightly the privilege of having been a
[27:38] witness and reading our names in the
[27:40] Bible that was placed as a
[27:44] Cornerstone uh for the construction of
[27:47] the
[27:49] church something that CAU my attention
[27:53] and I really like it about the Beautiful
[27:56] People of Uganda is is the way and the
[27:59] freedom they have in their singing in
[28:03] their dancing
[28:06] worshiping and I saw even to the service
[28:10] hasn't
[28:11] started they are rejoicing and
[28:17] celebrating I can also say I remember
[28:20] the service in in Manawa was a really
[28:23] something tremendous for
[28:24] me the preaching of the war of the
[28:27] brothers
[28:29] the atmosphere the spirit of the Lord
[28:31] was there I heard it was it were around
[28:36] about 600 people gathering in total 200
[28:40] of them
[28:41] children there was not there wasn't
[28:44] enough room for everyone in the church
[28:47] it was full of adults and children
[28:49] sitting on the floor and many others
[28:52] with mothers with the with their
[28:54] children sitting on the ground outside
[28:56] the church I was next to the window and
[29:00] I could see many childrens and adults
[29:03] who came to the
[29:04] window to be able to listen and see and
[29:08] participate in the
[29:10] services in the
[29:12] service they also raise their hands and
[29:16] I saw them praying as
[29:19] well they make me appreciate what we
[29:22] really have both in the church during
[29:25] the
[29:26] service and uh it make me also a
[29:29] impact when I saw so many childrens
[29:33] outside quing up just to receive at a
[29:37] small
[29:38] candy seeing the Beautiful People of
[29:41] Uganda the Simplicity in which they live
[29:44] the needs they have seen so many
[29:47] childrens without shoes with old clothes
[29:50] but still smiling they are happy people
[29:54] they play with very humble things they
[29:57] express what they have inside they are
[30:01] they are very very happy
[30:03] people it made me remember the words
[30:06] that brother Brandon said brother bran
[30:09] said in question questions and
[30:11] answers well look the color
[30:17] man he has he has got a disposition
[30:21] about
[30:22] him that the white man never does
[30:26] have he has got a happy go lucky and
[30:30] trust God and just let the rest of it Go
[30:35] whether he has got it or whether he
[30:38] hasn't he's happy anyhow and brother
[30:41] says I'd like to have a whole lot of
[30:44] that tonight I sure would well he has
[30:49] got it and that's his position they
[30:53] don't want to mix up with some other
[30:56] race and break it out either that's
[31:00] exactly
[31:01] right with so many dangers on the road
[31:04] with so many children and people walking
[31:07] on the roads so many motorcycles and
[31:11] crazy traffic in Uganda we could really
[31:14] see the hand of God protecting us
[31:18] through the
[31:19] Journey I could see so many
[31:22] motorcycles that they
[31:25] almost CED with with the
[31:28] bus on another occasion the bus was
[31:32] going to enter a gas station and I saw a
[31:36] car that was coming at full speed and it
[31:40] stopped just a few centimeters before
[31:43] hitting the bus things like that were
[31:47] something we uh could see but we were
[31:50] always protected from any
[31:54] accident when um when we we're on the
[31:58] way to
[31:59] Gulu and we had two buses for the team
[32:04] and a car for the sweet cases and before
[32:08] crossing a bridge the police wouldn't
[32:10] let uh the police wouldn't let us cross
[32:13] because they said it was too heavy and
[32:17] we were there for a long time and the
[32:19] drivers tried to talked to the police
[32:23] and they decided already that the car
[32:26] couldn't cross
[32:28] so I heard that the car had to stay
[32:31] there and that we had to carry our suitc
[32:35] cases
[32:39] inside carry our suitcases inside the
[32:42] buses with
[32:44] us so we we were all carrying our bags
[32:49] and our driver brother Godfrey was
[32:52] inside the bus lifting the bags and
[32:55] putting them on the seat
[32:59] this was an obstacle for us having to
[33:01] place all the sweet cases inside the bus
[33:05] with us when we had already when we had
[33:08] already loaded our bags onto the buses
[33:12] we suddenly heard that uh we could put
[33:15] our bags back into the car the police
[33:20] the police had changed their mind I
[33:24] heard that brother Benjamin the pastor
[33:26] from bugiri had spoken to the police and
[33:30] said this he said the Servants of the
[33:34] Lord are
[33:36] here we need all our things and we
[33:40] cannot leave anything here the car is
[33:44] part of the trip and suddenly they
[33:47] change their mind and allow us to cross
[33:51] the bridge and continue on our way to
[33:56] Guru that was madebe an impact for me to
[34:01] see that to see so many preachers and
[34:04] pastors gathering together all hungry
[34:07] for the word of God to learn more and to
[34:11] receive what God had for them in these
[34:14] conferences to see the spirit of God
[34:17] present the team that was presenting the
[34:21] different offices in the church and the
[34:24] special anointing in the teachings and
[34:28] preaching by Brother
[34:31] Caleb I heard um I heard several times
[34:35] from the brothers in
[34:37] Uganda I thank you thank you for loving
[34:41] the people of Uganda thank you for your
[34:44] your support thank you for your love
[34:47] thank you for being here I heard these
[34:50] testimonies from the people I was able
[34:53] to speak to in Uganda
[34:58] so now I can also testify as brother
[35:01] Tommy told me before that this trip
[35:04] changed our lives and for me it's still
[35:09] an
[35:12] impact and now I
[35:15] want to share my personal testimony
[35:18] Brothers something that shows that God
[35:23] is bigger than we can imagine sometimes
[35:26] people have the tendency to limit God
[35:30] when we
[35:31] pray little did I know that I had to
[35:34] travel thousands of miles to Africa to
[35:38] be able to tell this testimony to
[35:41] you for a long time ago I have prayed to
[35:47] God to be able to see an angel to see
[35:51] something
[35:52] Supernatural not because I have any
[35:55] doubts I believe in that but the
[35:58] privilege of being able to
[36:01] see in nanga the first place we visit
[36:06] outside the
[36:07] church cat my attention a group of small
[36:10] children and I asked them to gather
[36:13] around so I could take a
[36:16] picture the next day while reviewing uh
[36:20] I was watching the the the photos I
[36:22] could see a brighter light that stood
[36:26] out in the photo
[36:28] and in a special way I could clearly
[36:31] clearly see at the face of a young man
[36:33] there I show it into my show it to my
[36:36] pastor brother Morton and he told me to
[36:39] show to brother Caleb and he confirmed
[36:43] that it was an Angel and even to I had
[36:47] to travel thousands of miles to Uganda
[36:50] God answer my prayer in a bigger way
[36:55] than I expect expected no not when I
[36:58] expected but in his time and this is not
[37:01] just a testimony for me alone but I
[37:04] believe this is the testimony for many
[37:07] others as
[37:11] well I can
[37:13] testify of the great things that God has
[37:17] done and is still doing that the
[37:20] supernatural was present on this trip
[37:24] that the angels of God were present
[37:26] confirming that the vision that was
[37:29] given continues even
[37:32] today and from the bottom of my heart I
[37:36] want to thank my
[37:38] wife who has always supported me and
[37:41] prayed for
[37:44] us I also want to thank my pastor
[37:47] brother Morton for allowing me to travel
[37:51] together and a special thanks to our
[37:54] brother Pastor kalef for uh allowing me

[39:41] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[39:44] the strength of my life of whom shall I

[40:13] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[40:16] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[40:19] of the Lord and to
[40:21] inquire in his
[40:23] Temple for in the time of trouble he
[40:25] shall hide me in in his Pavilion in the
[40:29] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[40:31] me he shall set up upon a
[40:38] rock may the Lord richly add a blessing
[40:41] to the reading of the scripture
[40:47] and to be able to to join a trip like
[40:51] this it's it's just amazing it's it's
[40:55] God's grace uh
[40:58] all true
[41:01] and I I also need to to thank my my my
[41:05] family for for allowing me to travel
[41:09] because
[41:10] when when when we traveling on a trip
[41:14] like this
[41:15] it's it's not the only the men that
[41:18] travels is also all the the wies that's
[41:23] uh that's being back home they they go
[41:28] through the same
[41:30] fight and the
[41:33] trials so so so so a big thank to them
[41:39] for for what they do and for for for all
[41:43] of their
[41:46] prayers
[41:48] so I had
[41:50] uh one intention of going on this trip
[41:54] and that was to become a true witness
[41:56] instead of of telling that oh we do
[41:58] missionary Works in in Uganda and and
[42:04] this and this are are happening and it's
[42:06] a revival going on and we can see now
[42:09] the Revival is is is happening other
[42:13] places in the world I I wanted to go
[42:16] down to Uganda where the Revival
[42:20] started uh back uh some years ago and to
[42:26] become to become that true witness to
[42:28] see it with my own eyes and now I have
[42:32] been there and I'm a true witness and I
[42:35] can say thank you Lord and everything I
[42:39] have heard in all the reports that has
[42:42] been that has been given uh on on
[42:46] earlier trips I can say that it's it's
[42:50] true and what's being said are are
[42:53] really happening in Uganda and you can
[42:56] see more and more people are being
[42:59] added uh to the body of
[43:02] Christ and and people are are are are
[43:06] eager to to get a hold of what Jesus
[43:10] Christ wants to give to his his his
[43:15] bride
[43:17] so uh the reason I I read this scripture
[43:21] was because of the the vision that was
[43:25] was given us the second second day on
[43:27] the trip brother Caleb was explaining
[43:31] that that brother Diego had received a
[43:34] vision and the vision showed that it was
[43:37] fear amongst the
[43:40] Brethren uh in the team and and also
[43:44] that that four big demons was was let
[43:50] out of the four fourth uh Dimension to
[43:54] attack us and to to give us obstacles on
[43:59] the trip
[44:01] and we know that that that God uh he
[44:07] gives us
[44:09] strength and as we read that the Lord is
[44:13] my light and my
[44:15] salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[44:18] so so we were given we were given this
[44:22] this vision and and and brother Caleb
[44:26] said that the only way we can overcome
[44:29] this obstacles and we can we can
[44:33] overcome this fear amongst us was to
[44:37] pray when when we saw the obstacles
[44:42] coming
[44:45] and after this we we we we traveled to
[44:50] manafa we met Pastor
[44:53] Rogers and that is the the place where
[44:55] the first church church is is being
[44:59] built to
[45:01] and and we also placed the the
[45:04] Cornerstone there we we took a Bible and
[45:08] everybody in the team wrote their name
[45:10] in in in that Bible and we we sealed it
[45:14] into a
[45:16] brick uh and U and as we know the
[45:21] scripture says
[45:22] that Jesus Christ himself being the
[45:26] chief corner
[45:27] Stone so so this this
[45:33] church that uh that Jesus Christ is is
[45:38] talking about
[45:41] is is placed upon the foundation of the
[45:44] Apostles and Prophets and Jesus Christ
[45:48] himself being the Chief
[45:50] Cornerstone so we had to make sure that
[45:54] that this was the way that this church
[45:57] church was
[45:59] established and it was amazing to to
[46:03] take part in that and to to pray and to
[46:07] see all the people that that were
[46:10] working there and and to see how they
[46:15] they
[46:16] were were were building this church and
[46:19] we were able to to to join and help to
[46:22] build build
[46:24] this uh some walls
[46:27] we we're placing
[46:29] bricks and and that was amazing to see
[46:32] the the
[46:34] manifestation of of of our
[46:37] vision so what's what really impacted me
[46:42] on this trip was
[46:44] that that we have heard about uh signs
[46:48] and miracles happening uh that people
[46:51] are being healed and miracles happening
[46:55] in in the services
[46:57] but on this trip it it was something
[47:00] something different that was happening
[47:03] it was Supernatural things that that was
[47:06] going
[47:07] on and we had several conferences with
[47:12] with pastors on
[47:14] only
[47:17] and on on every conference we had
[47:21] brother Caleb started off by by
[47:25] preaching
[47:27] and um I would say that wow that was
[47:32] amazing to hear what
[47:36] what the Lord had in store for us
[47:39] through brother Caleb and those sermons
[47:44] that he held it was in
[47:47] itself
[47:49] it it it was life
[47:53] changing uh I I have heard
[47:57] uh preaching on these subjects before
[48:02] but to be down in Uganda and to
[48:05] hear these subjects being being
[48:09] preached it it was totally different
[48:13] different so so the first thing that was
[48:15] preached was the the wind from the
[48:19] north and and then it was it was
[48:24] preaching on Tidings and offerings and
[48:27] uh and last out it was uh preaching on
[48:33] the
[48:35] dimensions and the super Supernatural
[48:38] things that that we saw taking place
[48:41] down in
[48:42] Uganda U I want to explain those
[48:45] Supernatural things by reading a quote
[48:47] from the prophet from from the sermon
[48:49] Moses in
[48:51] 1950 now get these close friends the
[48:54] hardest thing that God has ever had to
[48:56] deal with his people is to get one
[48:58] mortal to believe and H that's the
[49:02] hardest thing God has ever done and we
[49:06] could see down in Uganda that that the
[49:09] hardest thing that God has ever had to
[49:12] deal with was was being D it was
[49:18] pastors that they had traveled far to
[49:22] come and to listen what the team had
[49:27] had in store to to bring to them
[49:33] and and it was it was especially
[49:38] one thing that that took place in in the
[49:42] conference in Gulu I I want to to talk
[49:46] about and that was a a precious brother
[49:50] I will see if I can find a I can find a
[49:53] picture of
[49:54] him uh
[49:57] he was he was after after the conference
[50:02] he he he came over to us and and and he
[50:07] said it's it's this
[50:10] brother he said
[50:13] today I have I have seen God in
[50:18] flesh and oh my that is that is
[50:22] Supernatural the hardest thing for that
[50:25] God has ever done deal with is is to get
[50:28] one mortal to believe another mortal and
[50:31] and here we could see that
[50:36] that the hardest
[50:39] thing
[50:41] was was
[50:44] being
[50:46] happened uh and this this brother he was
[50:50] he was so happy and he said that this
[50:53] this is a total change for me and and
[50:57] and we gave this brother and a tablet
[51:01] where he could have all the messages of
[51:03] of the prophet and he could see pictures
[51:06] he could take
[51:09] pictures
[51:12] and and also to see that during these
[51:16] conferences uh we had teaching on on on
[51:21] how to run the offices in the church the
[51:24] seven offices that operates in the in
[51:28] the church it's the the office of an
[51:32] Pastor the associate pastor the the
[51:35] Deacon the the trustee the treasure the
[51:40] Sunday School attendant and the The
[51:43] Sound and Music
[51:45] Department and all the pastors they they
[51:48] were so happy and they they wanted to
[51:51] learn and to understand how to how to
[51:54] run these things
[51:57] and that really impacted me to see that
[52:01] what's what was going
[52:04] on and and happening on on on this trip
[52:08] was
[52:10] that
[52:11] that God he he wants his his bride to to
[52:18] be
[52:18] hid in his in his Temple and for that to
[52:23] happen his his Temple must be
[52:27] established and we know that the the the
[52:30] bride is the Temple of of Jesus Christ
[52:34] that is supposed to be established and
[52:37] that is go what's going on and and I
[52:39] could see it really
[52:42] happening that this Temple is is being
[52:47] built and the people in Uganda the bride
[52:50] in
[52:51] Uganda they are
[52:53] accepting the the order of God they are
[52:58] accepting ER how to run a
[53:01] church and and and they
[53:05] want they want more
[53:07] teaching of how to operate the church in
[53:11] the right way and as it as psalms 27
[53:17] reads for in the time of trouble he
[53:21] shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[53:24] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[53:27] me
[53:29] and brothers and sister I I want to say
[53:35] that this was what I experienced down in
[53:38] Uganda that the church was being is
[53:43] established the the order in the church
[53:46] was being established and and this is
[53:49] making a way for God to to hide his
[53:53] bride when when the times of trouble
[53:56] comes
[53:57] he can hide us and that was also what
[53:59] the vision showed that these demons from
[54:02] the fourth dimension they were let loose
[54:06] to to attack the whole team and and we
[54:08] have heard about all the obstacles that
[54:10] that was on the on on this trip but God
[54:14] has has placed an order God has placed
[54:17] in Temple there for for us to
[54:20] enter
[54:22] and I want to say that if you

[59:36] saw I did not look onto Jesus 2,000

[1:13:05] me to every one of
[1:13:09] us amen is given Grace according to the
[1:13:13] measure of the gift of
[1:13:19] Christ wherefore he saith when he
[1:13:21] ascended on high he let captivity
[1:13:23] captive gave gifts un to
[1:13:30] men now that he ascended what is it but
[1:13:33] he also descended first to the lower
[1:13:35] parts of the
[1:13:41] earth I I want to stop right
[1:13:44] there just have a word of prayer Lord
[1:13:48] Jesus we just thank you for this night
[1:13:51] Lord for the privilege of your mercy
[1:13:56] and the breath of life to be able to
[1:13:59] serve you
[1:14:02] Lord we thank you now bless your
[1:14:06] children in the precious name of our
[1:14:08] Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:14:12] Christ amen amen you notice
[1:14:16] here for many many years I I've known
[1:14:19] Brother David
[1:14:23] Deon actually over 35
[1:14:26] years and and I remember when I first
[1:14:29] started to go to
[1:14:33] Sal this is way before I even knew there
[1:14:35] was a brother Tommy
[1:14:38] Pettis Church of the Cross HS Church of
[1:14:41] the cross I was going to church
[1:14:45] Ines with Brother Juan Francisco fio
[1:14:49] Franc as brother mis's
[1:14:53] father the Lord rested his Gallant
[1:14:58] soul in the very beginning when that
[1:15:01] church started there in
[1:15:05] Salo
[1:15:06] why they came out of a Church of Christ
[1:15:10] of all
[1:15:13] things and you know what brother B says
[1:15:16] about the Church of
[1:15:19] Christ he says socalled Church of Christ
[1:15:25] and I I I remember brother Ramon
[1:15:29] Deon RAM and at that time Brother David
[1:15:34] during that time was the associate
[1:15:37] pastor brother Ramon there
[1:15:41] in you know and as as I read this verse
[1:15:44] where it said that he he ascended on
[1:15:47] high gave gifts to man but then it said
[1:15:50] but he first descended to the lower
[1:15:53] parts of the earth so then
[1:16:00] as I look back through the
[1:16:04] years the
[1:16:07] ministry the bride God's people God's
[1:16:13] purpose it looks like it went through
[1:16:15] the lowest parts of the
[1:16:19] earth if you can understand what I'm
[1:16:21] talking about
[1:16:25] and I remember in mil lowest
[1:16:28] times you remember Brother
[1:16:31] David he said why brother Jimmy you were
[1:16:33] one of my first teachers that I ever had
[1:16:37] confidence in he told me one
[1:16:40] time me a
[1:16:43] teacher back then I would have I would
[1:16:45] have just said well brother I'm just to
[1:16:50] help but he considered me
[1:16:53] that and then from that time all the way
[1:16:55] to this current day uh because of things
[1:16:58] that have happened in the low times and
[1:17:00] how the enemy tried to
[1:17:02] destroy God's Heritage as we heard
[1:17:12] about yeah and Brother David kind of
[1:17:14] disclosed himself into a little
[1:17:21] shell he enclosed himself
[1:17:25] not because he didn't want to have
[1:17:29] Fellowship because there were so many
[1:17:31] things that had gone
[1:17:34] on so many things that had had done
[1:17:38] damage among the people of the
[1:17:43] message and do you see brother David now
[1:17:45] as he expressed to
[1:17:48] me he says tell brother Caleb I want to
[1:17:51] continue this now
[1:17:55] I've never seen Brother David like
[1:17:58] this since 35 years
[1:18:02] ago just to see
[1:18:05] that and the people were so
[1:18:08] happy the preaching machine he he he
[1:18:11] ministered Saturday
[1:18:13] night brother Salvador I
[1:18:17] me oh man it was
[1:18:20] awesome we didn't even have to make an
[1:18:22] altar call with people just started
[1:18:24] coming
[1:18:28] there were healings there was
[1:18:31] Deliverance people receiving the baptism
[1:18:34] of the Holy
[1:18:35] Ghost gifts of God being made
[1:18:41] manifest right even in the office before
[1:18:43] we went
[1:18:46] out God speaking things and then it
[1:18:48] happens right in front of our
[1:18:52] eyes we're just grateful to be part of
[1:18:57] this that was an awesome
[1:19:00] service Friday I had ministered to the
[1:19:03] young married
[1:19:07] couples
[1:19:08] and reminds me of something brother
[1:19:11] Tommy
[1:19:12] said and I know my time will be up here
[1:19:15] CU 10 15 minutes for me is
[1:19:19] like eating the last piece of ice in my
[1:19:22] water cup where there where there's no
[1:19:24] water in
[1:19:25] it you know but anyhow ministered to
[1:19:30] those young couples
[1:19:32] and and then that service on Saturday
[1:19:35] then Sunday morning brother Salvador he
[1:19:38] got to minister to the young
[1:19:41] people and uh then Sunday well I got
[1:19:45] that regular service I got to
[1:19:48] minister a little message entitled The
[1:19:51] Complex of humanity speaking basically
[1:19:54] what been speaking
[1:19:57] here we had two
[1:20:00] baptisms that so we had a wonderful
[1:20:05] time
[1:20:06] but as I as I finish this up I I I want
[1:20:10] to go to the part of the scripture that
[1:20:12] I feel the Imp of course we know verse
[1:20:14] 11 I gave some Apostles some prophets
[1:20:18] some evangelist pastors teachers we've
[1:20:20] heard of so much
[1:20:27] but verses 13 to 16 is what I see
[1:20:31] happening right now in this
[1:20:39] moment not
[1:20:42] minute not hour not day not month not
[1:20:48] year moment and
[1:20:51] time till we all come to the the unity
[1:20:55] of the
[1:20:58] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:21:02] God unto a perfect
[1:21:05] man unto the measure of the stature of
[1:21:08] the fullness of
[1:21:12] Christ that we henceforth be no more
[1:21:14] children tossed to and
[1:21:18] fro and carried about with every wind of
[1:21:21] Doctrine that's what happened all those
[1:21:23] years that caused all the damage
[1:21:28] by the slight of men and cunning crack
[1:21:31] whereby they lie wait to
[1:21:36] deceive but speaking the truth in
[1:21:41] love may grow up into
[1:21:47] him in all
[1:21:50] things which is the head even Christ
[1:21:56] we're growing up into
[1:22:00] him we're growing up into the
[1:22:06] headstone is divine
[1:22:09] love from whom the whole body fitly
[1:22:12] joined
[1:22:15] together compacted by that which every
[1:22:19] joint
[1:22:23] supplier I saw a joint in
[1:22:26] Salo part of the body a
[1:22:30] connection and there's a supply of God's
[1:22:35] grace coming through every
[1:22:39] joint every
[1:22:41] nerve every
[1:22:43] cell it's the body is coming
[1:22:48] together I have desired to see this for
[1:22:51] over 35 years
[1:22:55] and I've never lost the vision of
[1:22:58] this that there's a lot more of the
[1:23:01] bride of Christ all around
[1:23:06] us and with us here
[1:23:09] included may God never let us think
[1:23:14] that that we're the only
[1:23:16] ones I'm not saying we do but but I know
[1:23:20] I I know that Spirit attacks you know
[1:23:22] why because God attacked
[1:23:27] me and I almost did what Brother David
[1:23:31] did for many years but now brother
[1:23:35] David's coming
[1:23:36] out I'm coming
[1:23:38] out go up into him speaking the truth
[1:23:41] and
[1:23:44] love as we stand to our
[1:23:49] feet when Divine love is projected
[1:23:52] Sovereign Grace takes its place
[1:24:01] the and when his love projected his
[1:24:08] feeling Christ stepped out to take his
[1:24:14] place it required something to take the
[1:24:21] place his love alone went for for
[1:24:26] you his love alone went for those two
[1:24:30] Souls that got
[1:24:34] baptized and Grace provided a sacrifice
[1:24:37] for
[1:24:40] you next paragraph Love is one of the
[1:24:43] greatest instruments that there is in
[1:24:45] God's Great
[1:24:49] economy God is love the Bible said he is
[1:24:53] love
[1:24:55] and when you become one of his
[1:24:57] children you become a part of that
[1:25:01] love you are a part of God's
[1:25:06] economy you become subject of his
[1:25:11] domain and when you do that become a son
[1:25:15] and daughter of
[1:25:18] God he said he would give you
[1:25:21] everlasting
[1:25:23] life one last thing and we will
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:29] pray paragraph 36 I call it
[1:25:36] B what is
[1:25:39] it Divine love
[1:25:43] projected resulted in Sovereign Grace
[1:25:45] taking its
[1:25:49] place Divine love can only go so far
[1:25:55] but when it is held true to the
[1:25:59] end Sovereign Grace takes its
[1:26:04] place and produces that which love could
[1:26:07] not carry
[1:26:10] out Lord
[1:26:14] Jesus we're such a privileged people
[1:26:21] Lord that we would grow up into you and

[1:26:48] healed the people would be
[1:26:51] delivered we wouldn't have to lay hands
[1:26:54] on on the
[1:26:55] people but your love would come
[1:26:59] down or we would grow up into that
[1:27:03] love to unite the body of
[1:27:08] Christ thank you
