[25:08] say a testimony
[25:11] i had to get up here and
[25:13] and testify to you guys what god has
[25:16] done for me
[25:18] [Music]
[25:27] take some six months ago i was
[25:30] not the person i am today
[25:36] you know i was on the road doing
[25:39] things that i shouldn't be doing you
[25:41] know just
[25:43] going through life
[25:44] with the devil telling me that i wasn't
[25:46] good enough to go to church
[25:54] no
[25:57] and
[25:59] it it took me to
[26:02] i was in jail
[26:03] laying on my bed established
[26:08] pouring my heart out to the lord rigando
[26:10] mi corazon al senora
[26:13] saying you know lord if you get me out
[26:15] of this i will dedicate my life to you
[26:23] i've never been so sincere in my life
[26:26] than i was that day
[26:33] in those six months
[26:36] when i got out of jail
[26:37] they released me
[26:39] i had a bunch of court dates
[26:47] i didn't understand why they
[26:49] let me out
[26:54] because with my priors i i knew i was
[26:56] looking at at least 10 to 15 years in
[26:59] prison
[27:06] and
[27:08] when i got out
[27:10] i had a bunch of court dates
[27:15] and
[27:17] i started dedicating my
[27:19] devoting myself to to the lord
[27:22] every day i quit doing social media
[27:25] and just
[27:26] really
[27:27] focusing on god
[27:36] and
[27:37] right when i thought that that things
[27:39] were going to get worse
[27:41] god intervened
[27:49] a day of
[27:50] one of my court dates i
[27:52] i was having trouble because i had a
[27:54] call in
[27:56] and undiagnosed
[28:03] and i was having trouble just getting
[28:04] into the courtroom
[28:10] so i uh
[28:12] i kept on calling and i
[28:14] and i was just so worked up and i was
[28:16] just like ready to give up
[28:25] and all of a sudden just like
[28:27] the presence of the presence of the lord
[28:29] just came and
[28:32] just changed the whole atmosphere
[28:36] atmosphere
[28:38] and i thought you know if if the devil
[28:40] is fighting me
[28:42] hello mr i must be doing something right
[28:45] or god must be working
[28:52] so a long story short
[28:56] they wind up dismissing all my cases
[29:03] de cortes
[29:12] not only that but
[29:14] you know
[29:15] there's more
[29:17] i have to testify about no solo
[29:23] i
[29:25] i was just going through through life
[29:27] and all this was just so amazing and
[29:29] just
[29:30] and i i couldn't
[29:32] thank god enough and then god bless me
[29:35] more
[29:48] working at one of the brother's houses
[29:50] he was helping me out with
[29:52] some work and i had i've been having
[29:55] trouble finding you know an income or
[29:57] steady income
[30:07] and i would
[30:08] i've just been praying to the lord lord
[30:11] that i need to
[30:12] be able to support my family and
[30:15] and could you help me out some way or
[30:17] send me a sign or something
[30:24] so i was at my storage and then all of a
[30:26] sudden my uh i went to go open my door
[30:28] and i couldn't open it up all the way it
[30:31] just like
[30:32] got stuck
[30:33] almost
[30:38] a long story short
[30:41] the guy didn't know what he was doing
[30:43] when we were trying to fix the door and
[30:46] i winded up giving him a hand and large
[30:48] story
[30:52] [Music]

[31:00] maintenance man

[31:05] [Music]
[31:11] and i knew it was god working

[40:17] i'm going to pray that my voice holds up
[40:19] long enough to get through this sermon
[40:25] because i kept screaming come on team
[40:26] 10.
[40:30] all right guys let's get started tonight
[40:34] first corinthians chapter 13.
[40:48] when i was a child
[40:50] i spake as a child
[40:52] i understood as a child
[40:55] i thought as a child
[40:57] but when i became a man i put away
[40:59] childish things
[41:01] for now go ahead i'm sorry
[41:03] cuando nino alla
[41:12] for now we see through a glass darkly
[41:15] but then face to face
[41:17] now i know in part but then
[41:21] shall i know
[41:23] even as also i am known
[41:30] as
[41:36] and now abideth faith hope charity
[41:40] these three
[41:42] but the greatest of these is
[42:00] so i was i was watching you guys today
[42:04] and and
[42:05] believe it or not
[42:08] i learned an incredible amount from you
[42:10] guys
[42:15] as i watched
[42:17] this group of young people today
[42:22] i saw something amazing happening
[42:27] and i watched a group of a hundred
[42:28] individuals
[42:30] the
[42:31] cn individuals become groups
[42:35] of ten
[42:36] singulars
[42:39] singularis and then those ten singulars
[42:41] enes dies in gold
[42:49] and i've had this thought in my mind
[42:51] over the last few months
[43:02] as i study that word and i look into
[43:04] that word
[43:08] that word is always prefaced with
[43:10] another word
[43:25] they're always in harmony
[43:28] in one accord and unaccurate and and i
[43:31] wonder to myself
[43:34] what where is this in donde esta este en
[43:37] you know we hear many times escuchamos
[43:40] munchas vesses that the bride of jesus
[43:42] christ will be in such a harmony
[43:46] but yet day to day
[43:49] we have trouble getting along one with
[43:51] another
[43:59] how do i get along with my brother in
[44:01] this flash
[44:04] i don't always see eye to eye with
[44:06] brother noah
[44:14] so how can it be that we're supposed to
[44:16] be in harmony
[44:20] what what do we have to do get the nemos
[44:24] and i watched you guys today
[44:27] and i watched you guys start off as
[44:30] different teams
[44:34] and you started off this morning as
[44:36] individuals
[44:39] but by the time you made it to the top
[44:42] of the mountain
[44:46] there was one group
[45:04] lord
[45:04] what is this place
[45:07] and i and i started to to to think about
[45:10] this
[45:13] and i realized
[45:15] that this harmony
[45:18] that we have to find
[45:21] is not a harmony of flesh
[45:25] so when you look at one another
[45:28] you're going to have petty differences
[45:30] then
[45:33] you're going to have i don't like your
[45:35] shoes no my gustanto zapatos i don't
[45:37] like your shirt
[45:39] gusta you called me smelly me
[45:43] i called you harry you're
[45:49] [Music]
[46:04] and that secret lies in god's word
[46:08] because you find out
[46:11] that god provided a certain place
[46:16] and that place is nothing more es
[46:20] than the holy spirit of god
[46:23] that comforter that he left behind
[46:45] mean absolutely nothing no significant
[46:48] it's a place where if you like the
[46:51] cowboys and i like the rams it doesn't
[46:53] matter
[47:08] in one
[47:19] it is something that you have never
[47:21] experienced before
[47:34] [Music]
[47:36] but that's many times what we lack guys
[47:41] we lack the ability to get to that place
[47:47] and we think that coming to church is
[47:50] the one place
[48:05] but that doesn't matter because that one
[48:08] place that's provided
[48:12] god's provided place of worship
[48:16] and it's not four walls of a building
[48:27] where he chose to dwell
[48:30] where he chose to come and meet each and
[48:33] every one of you
[48:37] you came to camp this weekend
[48:42] and this weekend estefinda semana you
[48:45] have had an opportunity
[48:48] for a one-on-one appointment
[48:53] with nothing more than the lord jesus
[48:55] christ
[48:57] so if you ever wanted to meet him si en
[49:00] cualquier
[49:13] come into this place with the people
[49:14] that are here
[49:18] and meet the person of the lord jesus
[49:20] christ
[49:23] because he waits for you there
[49:28] i'm reminded of a story that my pastor
[49:30] said a few months ago
[49:35] and in this story
[49:37] it went over my head i'll be honest at
[49:39] first
[49:44] because it seemed like such a simple
[49:45] story
[49:49] and the pastor simply said this
[49:53] he said you know it's okay
[49:56] it's okay for us to a lot of times
[49:58] listen to tapes of brother branham
[50:03] and it's okay for us to a lot of times
[50:05] listen to the bible in audiobook form
[50:10] in form of the audio but there is
[50:12] nothing like
[50:13] nada
[50:14] when you read
[50:16] the words
[50:18] on the page
[50:22] and i didn't understand it
[50:24] i didn't get it no no no
[50:27] but i had an experience
[50:31] and one day
[50:33] i had a choice
[50:36] i was going to listen to brother
[50:37] branham's message
[50:47] and i said you know what i'm gonna i'm
[50:48] gonna take my pastor's advice
[51:06] and i began to read and i began to hear
[51:08] my own voice in my head
[51:13] how many hears your voice in your head
[51:15] when you read cuantro cuantos escuchas
[51:17] centro de si cuando len but all of a
[51:20] sudden but
[51:35] and the finisher
[51:38] and it wasn't my voice anymore
[51:41] because i found harmony
[51:44] harmony i found that place and contrast
[51:48] and all of the sudden me and him were
[51:50] having a meeting
[51:53] and he's speaking to me
[51:56] and i'm speaking to him
[51:58] and i'm in harmony
[52:01] but it's not my voice
[52:13] a man fully surrendered to god
[52:15] unbreakable
[52:30] authority
[52:47] [Music]
[52:58] he continues on
[53:01] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[53:04] he says
[53:06] omnipotence
[53:12] come together
[54:07] but we can't
[54:08] do
[54:20] there's a way to destroy the
[54:26] and a lot of times we approach mountain
[54:28] killing and giant killing munchas
[54:35] from a mental standpoint the una
[54:37] perspectiva mental we think that if we
[54:40] just say to my mountain
[54:44] removed
[54:46] and cast into the sea
[54:48] uh
[54:49] that it's just like magic entonces
[54:52] but god's word is not magic
[54:55] god's word is purposeful
[54:59] and every word that we utter from our
[55:02] mouths
[55:04] must
[55:17] you must be in his spirit
[55:21] and when you get in his spirit when the
[55:23] entrance
[55:24] you're gonna find a place encontra lugar
[55:27] where he waits there
[55:30] and when you and him unite us
[55:35] it will then produce the power
[55:38] produced
[55:39] to move your mountain
[55:44] but i want you to know
[55:45] your question
[55:48] that god's word doesn't stop there
[55:52] god's word covers all the bases
[55:57] it covers all the ends
[56:00] uh calafine
[56:02] first corinthians 13 2 tells us
[56:07] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[56:12] and i understand all the mysteries
[56:28] los montes
[56:30] but if i have not charity i no tengo
[56:34] amor
[56:35] i must say that again
[56:37] but if i have not loved hinotengo
[56:41] that's why when you capped your pyramid
[56:43] today
[56:47] we said the greatest of these
[56:51] is love
[56:54] it's the divine love of the lord
[56:56] christ
[57:23] and instead of a hundred individuals
[57:27] we find a group in the body of the lord
[57:30] jesus christ
[57:36] in one place
[57:52] is to
[58:04] where two omnipotents can meet under
[58:06] those
[58:17] it's as real as the person sitting next
[58:33] i don't care if satan tells you
[58:37] i don't care if satan tells you well you
[58:40] have no value
[58:42] i don't care if satan tells you kill
[58:44] yourself
[58:46] i don't care
[58:48] tells you you have depression
[58:51] tells you you've got anxiety
[58:56] can you find that place
[58:59] when you find it
[59:01] none of those things will matter anymore
[59:06] because you will come face to face
[59:09] with your creator
[59:11] who made you beautiful
[59:31] the talmud that he came from glory el we
[59:34] know the gloria he died on a cross
[59:40] he said i'd die for each and every one
[59:56] who else wants it
[1:00:12] and when two omnipotents meet juan dos
[1:00:14] encuentan dos omnipotentes
[1:00:17] it produces a power bro
[1:00:21] but that's why we don't get the results
[1:00:23] that we look for many times
[1:00:26] results because we don't
[1:00:30] get
[1:00:31] in god's provided place of worship
[1:00:36] we don't spend enough time there no no
[1:01:05] you gotta put away the girlfriend
[1:01:08] you gotta put aside the boyfriend
[1:01:11] why because you really don't have any
[1:01:13] business going for a boy or a girl
[1:01:17] if you haven't figured out how to love
[1:01:19] the lord jesus christ
[1:01:33] then you don't have love
[1:01:35] [Applause]
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:45] put it away
[1:01:48] you met the challenge of the mountain
[1:01:50] today in control
[1:02:17] can you meet the challenge that was
[1:02:19] given to you
[1:02:22] and i'm here to tell you young people
[1:02:26] you are more than capable each and every
[1:02:29] one of you
[1:02:31] you are more than able to take your
[1:02:34] mountains
[1:02:36] there is no devil in hell no diablo
[1:02:40] that can stop you from taking this
[1:02:42] mountain
[1:02:45] you just have to take
[1:02:59] it's not there to be mean and put a
[1:03:01] hardship in your life
[1:03:04] it's there for you to take the mountains
[1:03:09] so that you will know beyond the shadow
[1:03:11] of a doubt
[1:03:22] that's what made caleb so tremendous
[1:03:26] he wasn't afraid of any mountains
[1:03:42] we are able to go
[1:03:45] come on who can stand up
[1:03:48] who could say we are able
[1:03:51] to we are able
[1:03:53] we are able to

[1:06:15] drive them out as the lord said

[1:06:50] violence
[1:06:52] and the violet take it by force
[1:06:58] supreme

[1:11:42] but you know the christian walk it
[1:11:43] shouldn't be that way
[1:11:46] you know that's why many times
[1:11:48] you know where we're so we're so we're
[1:11:51] it's like we're statues
[1:12:06] one time
[1:12:08] he said the holy ghost
[1:12:11] it's not a monument
[1:12:13] oh the holy ghost
[1:12:15] oh it's a movement
[1:12:18] you know and he's taking us

[1:12:33] uh
[1:12:42] [Applause]
[1:12:49] amen amen
[1:12:53] i want to read a quote from brother
[1:12:55] branham
[1:12:58] he says
[1:13:00] he says now the one principle of us
[1:13:03] being here
[1:13:05] jesus is trying to help you
[1:13:09] he says and the only way that i know
[1:13:10] christian friends
[1:13:13] christian to help you is to get your
[1:13:15] faith
[1:13:26] amen amen he says if you can only see
[1:13:29] that it's god's will to do these things
[1:13:42] and he will certainly lead you into
[1:13:43] deeper depths and higher heights
[1:13:49] if you just trust him
[1:13:52] and he says this
[1:13:54] he says don't be satisfied with your
[1:13:56] fire built here
[1:14:03] he says let's build it a little further
[1:14:06] up the road tonight
[1:14:11] he says never build it in the same
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:26] what we don't understand
[1:14:38] we gotta move forward
[1:15:08] yes this was the same place where moses
[1:15:12] had his experiences
[1:15:15] it was mount rebel mountain rap and
[1:15:16] mount sinai are the same era
[1:15:21] so you know
[1:15:22] you may have had experience you know a
[1:15:24] while back
[1:15:27] and that's okay
[1:15:30] but you know after you know after he
[1:15:32] delivers the people of israel
[1:15:35] israel he wants he wants to take him
[1:15:38] even further
[1:15:40] he wants to take him higher
[1:15:43] so he takes him to the foot of mount
[1:15:45] sinai
[1:15:49] and he's gonna reveal himself
[1:16:03] he's going to show him the fire
[1:16:07] that's that's what he and he descends
[1:16:10] you know
[1:16:11] and we know
[1:16:13] if you read exodus 19 verse 9.
[1:16:17] [Music]
[1:16:19] he says he would reveal himself in a
[1:16:20] cloud of smoke
[1:16:26] that's that's what he does
[1:16:29] believe he did that in this in our time
[1:16:45] and the bible tells us
[1:16:59] the foundation
[1:17:13] he wants to tighten up the
[1:17:22] [Music]
[1:18:13] now you may be like well what's what's
[1:18:15] what was that all about
[1:18:20] that's what the bible says though
[1:18:23] i'm going to read it again
[1:18:24] here
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:52] [Music]
[1:19:04] that's what it is it's a holy
[1:19:20] that's
[1:19:47] because we're not gonna win this
[1:20:02] foreign i i i just want to read a quote
[1:20:06] from brother branagh
[1:20:08] because we see
[1:20:10] that in exodus 19.
[1:20:13] at the bottom of mount sinai
[1:20:16] that
[1:20:17] the lord wants to reveal himself
[1:20:21] wants to give him a revelation
[1:20:23] [Music]
[1:20:24] hey man i'm in
[1:20:26] brother branham says this is though
[1:20:30] he says now the power of revelation
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:35] it brings stimulation
[1:20:39] to the believer
[1:20:42] this is for the power of wine
[1:20:58] oh two simulations
[1:21:12] it's a stimulation of satisfaction
[1:21:15] satisfaction the stimulation that it's
[1:21:17] vindicated
[1:21:23] it's called in the scripture
[1:21:26] as we want
[1:21:40] wise
[1:21:42] you see the i believe
[1:21:45] that that's what the lord
[1:21:47] said he wants to do this evening
[1:21:51] he wants to reveal himself
[1:21:54] and when
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:21] i saw this young man back there
[1:22:22] yesterday
[1:22:25] you know the man he was stimulating
[1:22:28] he was going yeah
[1:22:30] he was praising god
[1:22:32] it didn't matter what they said
[1:22:34] he was just loose
[1:22:41] [Music]
