[0:00] I picked up my Bible and I guess I held
[0:02] that Bible for 10 minutes without
[0:03] anybody anymore word coming I'll wait
[0:06] just a few minutes I heard him say again
[0:08] turn to Hebrews 6 and start reading and
[0:11] I did and it'll come down there where it
[0:15] said the rain come assault upon the
[0:16] earth to water it and prepare it dress
[0:19] it for witches but the thorns and
[0:20] thistles which is 9 to rejection whose
[0:22] end is to be burned and I caught it
[0:24] right there I thought there it is
[0:26] thanks be to God there it is see now
[0:29] jesus said a store went for storing
[0:31] seeds Sydney huh
[0:33] you're all Christian sure everyone held
[0:36] up their hands anyhow
[0:37] Pentecostals born-again Christians
[0:38] aren't they and he said of store wine
[0:41] for storing seeds and while he slept his
[0:44] residence team and while he slept on
[0:47] enemy coming so Terriers than that would
[0:49] heal what is Terriers wheeze rah Rose
[0:52] knee now and when the husbandmen the
[0:56] preacher saw these terrors going to let
[0:58] me go pull him up he's a no no you put
[1:00] up the wheat also let them both grow
[1:02] together there's a weak deal on earth
[1:05] there's creepers metal balls stinkweed
[1:09] everything else in it is that right but
[1:12] now in there they're sweet now the rain
[1:14] come off upon the earth to water it and
[1:17] what serene far not to water the nettle
[1:20] ball i watch to pay attention not the
[1:23] water the creeper the rain set for the
[1:26] week but the nettle ball and the weed is
[1:30] just as thirsty as the weed is and the
[1:33] same rain that falls on the wheat falls
[1:36] on the weed and the little old wheedle
[1:39] things are straight up like that and
[1:40] happy and rejoicing just as much as the
[1:42] little weak or stand up and stand
[1:44] yourself up but by their fruits you
[1:47] shall know them
[1:48] there you see now the same holy spirit
[1:52] can bless the hypocrite that knocks
[1:55] telling you Armenians out but that's the
[1:57] truth that's the truth
[1:59] then told holiness which I believe in
[2:01] holiness - but if the same spirit the
[2:04] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[2:07] but by their fruits you shall know them
[2:10] by look out you're going to get wheat
[2:11] get we but the weeds is all bound up and
[2:14] they live on the same rain that fell for
[2:17] the wheat and the rain was not sent far
[2:18] the weeds it was sent for the week but
[2:22] the rain being in the feet of the sweet
[2:24] scent weeds being in the wheat fields
[2:26] got just as much benefit out of the rain
[2:28] as the rest of a bit and the same rain
[2:30] that made the weak lift made that we
[2:32] live all things in the natural types of
[2:35] spiritualists we're teaching there it is
[2:38] demonology demons impersonating
[2:41] christianity yet with the blessings
[2:45] that's not skim milk rather than if you
[2:48] can take a see see it's true so I'm not
[2:53] saved today because I can shout I'm
[2:57] saved not because i feel like i'm saved
[2:59] i'm saved because I met God's conditions
[3:03] to this Bible Jesus said either heareth
[3:06] my word and believeth on him that sent
[3:08] me has everlasting life and shall not
[3:09] come into condemnation but it's past and
[3:11] that's the life I believe that that's
[3:14] right now in them conditions I am saved
[3:17] they called God said so if you told me
[3:19] you're saved because somebody said a
[3:20] rushing mighty wind hit me in the face
[3:21] that's wonderful well I wanted or that
[3:24] rushing mighty wind comes from or hit me
[3:26] in the face see now what kind of a life
[3:29] is you go to Leah base that rushing
[3:30] mighty wind pitch you see see it's by
[3:33] your fruits your knowing
[3:34] so demons can work right amongst
[3:36] Christians you believe that look at Paul
[3:41] Paul said now here's where the
[3:44] latter-day rain if there's any of you
[3:45] here forgive me if I'm saying anything
[3:47] against you I wouldn't say the Morgan
[3:48] shooter with the similes or any of the
[3:50] Baptist or anybody else it's truth is
[3:52] what's truth where you got off was this
[3:55] you're making profits out of them man
[3:57] and things that's not profits profits
[3:59] are not laid on the hands and sent out
[4:00] profits are borned me in the bible
[4:05] there's a gift of prophecy there's where
[4:07] your mistake was between the gift of
[4:09] prophecy and a prophet the gift daughter
[4:13] and sundry times and divers matter spoke
[4:15] to the father's to the prophets in this
[4:16] way States through son Christ Jesus the
[4:18] body of Christ has nine spiritual gifts
[4:21] operating in it
[4:22] and it might be on this woman tonight
[4:24] prophecy may never be the rest of her
[4:27] life it may be on this woman the next
[4:29] night may be on this man the next time
[4:30] maybe on that one back there the next
[4:32] time that doesn't make her a prophet
[4:34] doesn't make no one a prophet it's the
[4:37] gift of prophecy in yin and before that
[4:40] man or that prophecy can be given to the
[4:43] church it has to be judged before two or
[4:45] three spiritual judges that Rider Court
[4:47] now Paul said you all may prophesy one
[4:50] by one there's something be revealed to
[4:52] this and let that hold his peace
[4:54] well that would make the whole bunch
[4:55] prophet saying according to the teaching
[4:57] of the days no Pentecostal church we've
[5:00] got things all scrupled up and that's
[5:02] reason God can't come in till we get the
[5:03] thing straightened out and on the Bible
[5:05] Ryan you got to rig up the right path I
[5:08] go to build a house without looking to
[5:10] blueprint thing you got to start right
[5:13] now in there a prophet you never seen
[5:16] anybody stand before Isaiah Moses one
[5:19] ditch then Korah one day and try to
[5:21] dispute with him and God said separate
[5:23] yourself we'll open up your ass and a
[5:24] prophet is born gifts and callings out
[5:28] repentance that's the foreordination of
[5:30] God from the baby up everything was
[5:33] perfectly right along exactly what he
[5:35] said was the truth and vindicated and
[5:37] brought out it's a Word of God comes to
[5:39] the Prophet but a gift of prophecy is in
[5:42] the church
[5:43] now you said well the prophets of the
[5:44] Old Testament all know the New Testament
[5:46] had prophets activist was a was a New
[5:48] Testament prophet look at the spirit of
[5:50] prophecy falling down and telling Paul
[5:52] about then here come activist down from
[5:55] Jerusalem and found Paul and tied up his
[5:58] girl around him and turned over he said
[6:00] thus saith the Lord
[6:01] a man at war this will be bound and
[6:04] changed when he gets to Jerusalem
[6:06] activist who stood up and told her
[6:07] foretold what would take place he was a
[6:10] prophet not a man with the gift of
[6:13] prophecy and the gift of healing and all
[6:16] those gifts my Pentecostal friends she
[6:18] got it mixed up the gifts are in the
[6:21] church subject to any persons in the
[6:24] church anybody that's baptized into the
[6:25] body by one spirit we're all baptized in
[6:28] and the Bible said well I got the gift
[6:30] of healing while the Bible said confess
[6:32] your faults one to another and pray one
[6:34] the other every person pray one for the
[6:36] other we're not a divided group we're a
[6:39] collective gathered guru the now and
[6:43] there's how demons sometimes working now
[6:46] watch what Paul said if one speaks with
[6:48] tongues and the other an interpreter and
[6:51] whatever it said let it be judge force
[6:52] for the church can receive it now won't
[6:54] be a quoting of Scripture something
[6:56] other like that God don't repeat himself
[6:58] but it'll be a warning to the church
[7:00] then if good judges says let's receive
[7:02] that all right I was of the Lord second
[7:05] one says let's receive it the mouth of
[7:07] two three witnesses that ever word the
[7:08] established then the church receive it
[7:10] and go make ready for it if that doesn't
[7:12] come to pass what that said then you got
[7:14] an evil spirit among you that's right if
[7:18] it does come to pass then thank God
[7:20] the Spirit of God is among you see now
[7:23] that's where you have to watch and be
[7:25] careful so don't try to press I couldn't
[7:27] make myself have brown eyes when I got
[7:29] blue see I have to be satisfied with
[7:32] blue eyes now there's where demons work
[7:35] in the realm of spiritual people now we
[7:38] got a deep something coming here and I
[7:40] hope it's not too deep now over in 1st
[7:44] Samuel 28 I want to read some scripture
[7:48] here right at this time I want you to
[7:51] listen closely and I don't want to bring
[7:53] demons show you how they work right in
[7:56] the church and how Satan has a
[7:57] counterfeit forever real there is now
[8:00] you can see according to the Bible that
[8:02] demons come among Christians and they
[8:06] impersonate and many times we have
[8:09] declared people to be Christian one day
[8:13] that I believe in Jesus Christ while the
[8:17] devil's believe the same thing and
[8:20] tremble that's the sign you're saved one
[8:26] of these nights I want to get on the
[8:27] election and then you'll see what
[8:28] salvation means see there's nothing you
[8:31] had to do with it in the first place or
[8:33] the last place are nothing you can do
[8:35] about it
[8:36] God saves the man unconditionally for
[8:39] that sunk deep didn't as might as well
[8:43] get that out of your system while we're
[8:44] at it alright
[8:46] Abraham was the beginning of our faith
[8:48] is that right
[8:49] or Abraham had the promise and God
[8:53] called Abraham because he was a great
[8:55] man I guess no sir
[8:57] he come down out of Babylon in the land
[8:59] of shall Deanna's city of era and God
[9:02] called him and made his covenant with
[9:04] him unconditionally I'm going to save
[9:08] you and not only you Abraham but your
[9:10] seed unconditionally God made a covenant
[9:13] with man and man breaks his covenant
[9:14] every time man never didn't keep his
[9:17] covenant with God the law was never
[9:19] attempt it couldn't keep the law
[9:22] Christ was come and broke the law
[9:24] himself calls grace had already provided
[9:29] Savior Moses providing a way of escape
[9:32] and then the escaped brother and then
[9:35] the people after that they still wanted
[9:37] something to do man's always trying to
[9:39] do something to save himself when you
[9:41] can't do it it's his nature as soon as
[9:44] he found out he was naked in the Garden
[9:45] of Eden he made some fig leaf aprons is
[9:47] that right
[9:48] but he found out they wouldn't work
[9:51] nothing a man can do can save yourself
[9:54] God saves you unconditionally all down
[9:58] to the age and then when you're saved
[9:59] you're saved look at Abraham there that
[10:03] fella once went over God give him the
[10:05] land of Palestine and told him not to
[10:07] leave there any Jews at least Palestine
[10:09] was back slid God told him to stay there
[10:11] if God tells you to do something and you
[10:13] don't do it then you're evacuated that
[10:15] right all right a drought
[10:17] come on the tribe or him fading and
[10:20] instead of Abraham staying there no he
[10:23] couldn't stay there
[10:24] he'd run off and touched Aaron one about
[10:26] 300 miles wish they had time to get old
[10:28] man down to another land and when he got
[10:33] down there and then he got this great
[10:37] King down there of emilich he was a
[10:41] young fellow and he was looking for a
[10:43] sweetheart so he found Abraham's wife
[10:45] Sarah and fell in love with her and
[10:49] Abraham said are you telling that you
[10:51] are my sister I'm your brother's soul
[10:55] that please ammok so he said all right
[10:57] we'll just take her over to castling
[10:59] I guess the women fixture up his go to
[11:01] marry the next day and ambach was a good
[11:03] man a righteous man and that night while
[11:07] he was asleep and the Lord appeared to
[11:09] him and said you're as good as a dead
[11:10] man he said the man's the woman that you
[11:15] got out there to marry is another man's
[11:16] wife I watch another man's wife why he
[11:22] said Lord you know the integrity my mark
[11:24] a righteous holy man you know the
[11:27] integrity in my heart that man told me
[11:30] that was his sister and didn't she tell
[11:33] me herself as that was my brother he
[11:36] said that God said I know of integrity
[11:38] art that's reason I kept you from
[11:39] sinning against me but that's my prophet
[11:42] how are you
[11:43] what was he back slid and a little wine
[11:48] shyster that right or doily no little
[11:53] white lives are either a black lives or
[11:54] they're not lies at all the man sitting
[11:57] out there telling a pine blank line
[11:59] saying that was his sister when it was
[12:02] his wife beating around the bush and
[12:05] back slid and there was a righteous man
[12:09] standing before God and said Lord you
[12:11] know my heart but I'll not hear your
[12:14] prayer emilich but take him take her
[12:16] back and let him play for you he's my
[12:18] prophet I'll hear him yes a backslider
[12:22] liar but that's the prophet that's rude
[12:30] that's survival I don't go plump too far
[12:34] over your Calvinistic sidewalks and
[12:36] grades always in grease cause you're
[12:37] getting discouraged see just a moment
[12:41] we'll get time this week to bring that
[12:43] up and show you how to level it is but
[12:46] don't think it's because you've done
[12:47] something wrong you're gone forever your
[12:50] child or God you're born the Spirit of
[12:52] God your sons and daughters of God and
[12:55] the fruits will bear record of itself
[12:57] there you are now here we are sitting in
[13:00] the land now I want to read here the six
[13:05] first and when Saul inquired of the Lord
[13:07] the Lord answered him not neither by
[13:10] dream are above the Urim nor by profit
[13:13] and then said Saul unto his servant
[13:18] speak native woman with a familiar
[13:20] spirit that I may go to her and acquire
[13:23] of her I could lay something to the rod
[13:26] right here fidgety seek me a woman with
[13:33] a familiar spirit any server said unto
[13:37] Him behold there is the woman that has a
[13:40] familiar spirit in indra and saul
[13:44] disguised himself and put on raymond
[13:47] other arena and he went - and two men
[13:51] with him and it came to the woman by
[13:54] night and they said I pray thee vitam to
[13:59] me by thy familiar spirit and bring me
[14:02] up whom I shall name unto thee and the
[14:04] woman said unto him behold thou knowest
[14:07] that Saul has done does know has cut off
[14:11] all goals that have familiar spirits and
[14:13] wizards out of the lane
[14:16] therefore Leah saw sneer for my life and
[14:19] caused me to die and Saul answered I
[14:22] swear to her by the Lord seen as the
[14:26] Lord liveth there shall be no punishment
[14:28] happen unto thee then said the woman
[14:31] whom shall I bring up thee and he said
[14:35] bring me up Samuel and when the woman
[14:38] saw Samuel she cried with a loud voice
[14:40] and the woman's spacious
[14:43] Oh Saint why has thou deceived me for
[14:45] thou our soul and the King said unto her
[14:49] be not afraid for what sayest thou and
[14:53] the woman said us on to soul I stole
[14:57] gobs of sinning out of the earth and he
[15:00] said unto her what form was he off and
[15:03] she said an old man cometh up and he is
[15:07] covered with the mantle and sent as a
[15:09] prophets mantle of course he perceived
[15:11] that it was Samuel and he stood with it
[15:15] and it his face to the ground and bowed
[15:19] himself and Samuel said unto Saul why
[15:22] has thou disquieted me and bring me up
[15:24] and Saul answered and said I am sore
[15:27] distressed because of the flesh teens
[15:30] make war against me and God has departed
[15:32] from me and answers me not neither by
[15:35] prophet needed by dream

[48:28] there are three Exodus right there can
[48:31] you all help me this morning the first
[48:32] Exodus was to do what L primatech
[48:34] straight up and I said okay it's to come
[48:40] out of something to go into something
[48:41] right it is a little loop at an angle so
[48:44] the first Exodus yes was too
[48:47] take them from a natural land they were
[48:49] in Egypt it premiered externa per second
[48:52] losing that tiara natural and take them
[48:53] to a spiritual and I'm carried to a
[48:55] natural land which was the promise that
[48:57] the land that God had given oh yeah get
[48:59] it up Rometty that not too Randy man I'm
[49:01] in the second Exodus and still go into X
[49:04] somebody help me here
[49:05] see I'll get make you that anybody it's
[49:13] here nobody
[49:27] either again
[49:31] it was to take the people from a
[49:33] spiritual condition my way latina
[49:36] condiciones PT to I into the baptism of
[49:38] the Holy Ghost is my a man Santo I
[49:40] understand that he went from one
[49:43] covenant to another covenant where they
[49:44] won't back to al otro and through seven
[49:46] churches he brought us all the wave like
[49:49] I said from a spiritual condition into
[49:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:53] it was urine which we understand came to
[49:56] lady saya the ending of the of the
[49:59] Gentile about these moisture changes
[50:01] Peter said many know that what to say
[50:03] yes I how do I even go any further
[50:07] como si Giri okay once again the second
[50:11] one was to take the people from a
[50:13] spiritual condition yeah my payload in a
[50:15] condition it is probably into a
[50:17] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:19] Onision del vallès - Peter Ianto once
[50:22] again this mass is paralleling way that
[50:26] he took them out naturally Elmo can use
[50:28] to monitor and maintain from one natural
[50:31] place to another do look at natural look
[50:33] he's taking us spiritually from one
[50:35] condition to another no Sierra Dina
[50:37] condition is pro2 the baptism of the
[50:39] Holy Ghost
[50:40] how about this Melissa p2 son and the
[50:42] last Exodus or the third Exodus if
[50:44] they're saying somebody help me a whole
[50:45] team o CI give me a you them it was to
[50:51] take us from the baptism of the Holy
[50:53] Ghost am I not the least bit but is well
[50:55] spit to Santos he says into the eternal
[50:57] millennium and the land beyond L
[51:00] millennia turn as a man now now if we
[51:03] have already heard the messages come up
[51:06] higher is to be that kind and those that
[51:08] are still down here don't suppose que
[51:10] una Stella struggling with the first or
[51:12] with the second Exodus your lieutenant
[51:14] couldn't say but there is a third Exodus
[51:17] that is going on right intersects with
[51:18] okay secure account and that would be
[51:20] come out of her my people that's right
[51:23] yes but we'll get to that in a moment
[51:25] are you thinking I'm saying but in
[51:26] understanding these things in Nintendo's
[51:28] course we understand as I said it has
[51:31] two parts
[51:32] and the most case one dose we've got to
[51:33] come out of something to go into
[51:35] something else do not party and there's
[51:38] such a parallel in all these things
[51:40] Antonio for we understand that
[51:43] Egypt demos Kiptyn it represents there's
[51:46] a couple of things that brother Branham
[51:48] says Egypt represents this in America by
[51:50] discusses K representation can you tell
[51:52] me what what they it represents telling
[51:54] me player and okay represent a hippo
[51:58] each up represents the world hip to
[52:01] represent and fry it also represents
[52:04] tambien representa the denominations
[52:07] amen and with just those two we can we
[52:10] can approach this message so once again
[52:12] equally gypped represents the world hit
[52:15] the represent el mundo it also
[52:16] represents the denomination represented
[52:19] as they don't mean now before the
[52:20] children of Israel left Egypt can't
[52:23] escape it will Israel day he brought
[52:24] showed himself in a mighty way Justin
[52:27] was thrown on mall yesterday you saw
[52:29] must say before any Exodus can happen
[52:33] but given entity called connect cito
[52:34] Gaston Pisgah God shows himself in a
[52:38] mighty mighty way just a Western remote
[52:40] Madhavi tremendo Amen we know this then
[52:44] as the ten plagues Cosimo's esto como
[52:47] las Plagas and we are all familiar
[52:49] because we learn that in Sunday school
[52:51] right there's no severe moral and
[52:53] emotionless robot the ten plagues what
[52:55] the seven de las Plagas I this should be
[52:57] ABC's it's to video say that we say but
[53:00] let's go into this for a moment
[53:02] you know what was internalized oh
[53:03] because I want it I want you to hear
[53:05] what brother branham has to say about
[53:06] these ten plagues kid okay we got Kelly
[53:09] marentina Casey this does he has plans
[53:10] in a message awakening Jesus in a mincer
[53:13] hey this pertinacious he says just like
[53:15] Israel this SE como Israel when he done
[53:18] all the plagues in Egypt and is the
[53:21] tallest like I said egipto and done the
[53:23] great things that he did he still has
[53:26] got this matter yes man when they got to
[53:28] the Red Sea what do they do
[53:31] Casey Aaron after all that God had done
[53:33] this and they began to cry yes ma you're
[53:38] they began to fear if these are not to
[53:40] marry they know we're gonna die here the
[53:42] sound I see a key vamos a morir this is
[53:44] what this is what Moses told them I keep
[53:46] your camera says he said that Moses had
[53:48] to scream out he's a Moses - ok Katara
[53:51] you've seen the 10 miracle sister lost
[53:54] Milagros and still you doubt God ie as
[53:59] he do the nasty house this is what's
[54:00] tremendous to me
[54:02] it's the Lukas tremendous because it
[54:03] depends on what side you're on
[54:05] but can you pin to the cat now Saint
[54:06] Quentin so whether it is a plague yes
[54:08] there was there on a pillow or if it's a
[54:10] miracle or I soon realized that all
[54:11] right to those that receive the plague
[54:13] let's get a severe on the plaque it was
[54:15] a playground I don't know plug up and
[54:17] what do those that believe God at all

[56:21] whenever we speak about about gods it
[56:24] cuando la voz de Dios they speak about
[56:26] pagan gods Alamos the doses per can

[56:30] la primero que pensamos I can't hear
[56:36] very well Pearson no you go be honest a
[56:37] man you're gonna get it you gotta say it

[56:50] oh that calves and all these things and
[56:52] different yes we think of those things
[56:54] what do you think about about about

[57:07] you know Honda is that right no that
[57:11] maybe I'm the only one that think that
[57:14] way he says Leone co-captains Alice II
[57:16] and and when you think about idols kind
[57:19] of peers I know they either Lewis we
[57:21] understand that that that an idol is
[57:23] simply an image neither let's implement
[57:27] any market or a material object who know
[57:30] hetero the materia represents a deity
[57:33] can represent oh nothing that in which
[57:35] religious word worship is a dress this
[57:38] is you don't really hear so once again

[58:05] was Kent in there that though the idol
[58:07] is representing something okay leave the
[58:09] Lord opposite time there is a devil or
[58:12] Devils I in Diablo or the motor are
