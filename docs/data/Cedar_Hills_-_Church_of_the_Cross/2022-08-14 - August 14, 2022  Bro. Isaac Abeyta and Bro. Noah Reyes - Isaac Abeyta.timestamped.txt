[26:10] [Music]
[26:20] amen not to have you standing much let's
[26:23] let's turn in our scriptures to matthew
[26:24] verse 10. matteo verso diaz but not
[26:42] matthew chapter 10
[26:45] verse 8-10
[26:49] yes
[26:50] now this was the first commission jesus
[26:52] gave to the disciples
[26:55] jesus
[26:58] he tells them heal the sick
[27:18] freely give the gracia
[27:21] but then he tells them
[27:24] provide neither gold nor silver
[27:27] nor brass in your purses
[27:47] neither bordon for the workman is worthy
[27:50] of his me
[27:54] amen may the lord add his blessings to
[27:55] the reading of his word you may be
[27:57] seated
[27:59] thank our pastor for for the opportunity
[28:08] now in another portion of scripture
[28:12] he also told about about 70 others
[28:18] to go out and do the same
[28:20] i said
[28:22] and he sent him out by twos
[28:26] and he gave him power and authority
[28:29] poder
[28:31] over all devils
[28:34] now
[28:35] imagine this
[28:38] all these years
[28:41] science
[28:43] doctors doctors have been searching for
[28:45] a cure honestly
[28:48] for sicknesses and diseases
[28:52] and he tells his disciples
[28:54] disciples go out and be the cure
[28:57] isaiah
[28:59] because why because they had power and
[29:01] authority over all devils
[29:06] now imagine what a son and daughter can
[29:08] do imagine
[30:07] you 11 22.
[30:10] whatsoever things you say and don't
[30:12] doubt in your heart it'll come to pass
[30:17] you can have what you've said
[30:20] received
[30:25] okay
[30:26] this is this first row in front of me
[30:28] stand up
[30:29] don't be embarrassed to stand up
[30:36] now imagine pastor caleb telling you
[30:37] this
[30:41] right now
[30:43] he's giving you power over all devils
[30:48] all
[30:48] diseases
[30:50] but he's going to come to you and he's
[30:51] going to say okay
[30:54] i'm sending to mexico
[30:57] you ministers
[30:59] you too i'm sending to south america
[31:02] usted
[31:06] you guys are going across the uh to the
[31:09] east coast
[31:13] but when you go
[31:15] you're going without money
[31:34] remember the scripture do not worry in
[31:35] that very hour what you shall see
[31:40] because in that very hour it will be
[31:42] given unto you
[31:44] that's why you hear the preachers say
[31:45] get the word inside you
[31:51] and
[31:51] at its appointed time
[31:55] he's going to bring it out as you have
[31:57] needed
[32:22] but my god shall supply all your need
[32:24] according to his riches and glory by
[32:27] christ jesus
[32:37] jesus why because he's jehovah gyra
[32:40] porque porque
[32:57] don't even take a changing of clothes
[33:01] don't take a jacket
[33:03] psalms 914.
[33:07] why
[33:09] because he shall cover you
[33:12] with his feathers and under his wings
[33:14] shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy
[33:16] shield and buckler
[33:22] allah
[33:46] so you see our pastor just went to
[33:48] mexico
[33:50] mexico
[34:45] that the holy spirit is leading you
[34:47] though
[34:49] don't get me wrong
[34:52] i i feel for these people
[34:55] you see them when they lost everything
[34:58] but is god calling you there but
[35:10] and whosoever shall not receive you
[35:14] nor hear your words when you depart out
[35:16] of the house of the city shake off the
[35:18] dust of your feet
[35:28] without
[35:30] in another portion of scripture it says
[35:32] shake off the the dust of your feet for
[35:34] a testimony against him
[35:41] he tells them if they don't receive
[36:01] it's no different than when god sends a
[36:03] prophet you know is different
[36:07] he says believe who i send
[36:55] no
[36:57] no
[36:59] you got to raise your hand but just
[37:00] think about this you want to be used by
[37:01] god
[37:04] i never understood the scripture when i
[37:06] was your age
[37:10] it says present your body a living
[37:12] sacrifice present
[37:16] holy and acceptable
[37:19] i didn't understand it no no
[37:32] you don't understand present your body a
[37:34] living sacrifice until this flesh starts
[37:36] to go through hell on earth
[37:43] i didn't understand it until i started
[37:45] would would be used and then i would get
[37:47] sick
[38:29] so when god calls you to something
[38:42] much is going to be required
[38:52] those who believe the message you're
[38:53] adding to the scripture
[38:55] those who believe the messages are
[38:56] adding to the scriptures
[39:24] you can't do it
[39:28] so brother brother i remember brother
[39:29] tommy saying this
[39:33] you might not agree with it
[39:35] but don't say you you you disbelieve it
[39:40] because if you say you don't believe it
[39:43] you don't give god a chance to work
[39:44] inside you know
[39:49] difference between jesus then
[39:52] jesus
[39:54] and jesus now jesus
[39:56] the prophet says he's just got a
[39:57] different color of sudan
[40:02] and brother gets challenged on surface
[40:08] there's anybody new here or or online
[40:10] maybe
[40:13] there's there's these mysteries to this
[40:16] mysterious what really happened in the
[40:17] garden of eden
[40:21] you eat an apple or a prime organic
[40:35] so he's speaking to this man
[40:39] you see a prophet does not know
[40:40] everything
[40:44] that's right
[40:47] he is the very mouthpiece of god
[41:04] when the cases would come when the
[41:05] legend
[41:07] he would say boom i'll go into a vision
[41:10] of town past events
[41:14] things that happened in their lives
[41:17] and then he would say
[41:22] i'd have to go back and hear the
[41:23] recording because
[41:24] i don't know what i said
[41:29] why
[41:30] because it was not a man
[41:32] it was the lord
[41:48] and uh
[41:50] he uh
[41:51] he he tells brother brown you're wrong
[41:53] on that lisa
[41:56] he says i may be but tell me about it
[42:13] now whereas the species you said was
[42:15] between man and beast
[42:22] was it a chimpanzee
[42:25] he says no it won't mix
[42:28] [Music]
[42:29] and the man says if the original sin is
[42:32] here it ought to be here also
[42:36] now
[42:37] again our prophet doesn't know anything
[42:42] this is when brother branham was
[42:43] receiving the revelation to serpents
[42:50] then he says where's it at
[42:52] brother brown i'm saying lord
[42:55] he said
[42:56] romano
[43:23] you see before that beat that beast
[43:27] it was the closest thing to a man
[43:31] he was upright
[43:33] then after the fall
[43:35] he was cursed on his belly
[43:38] into
[43:52] skip some of this here
[43:58] now without a prophet
[44:00] or i see in prophet i've seen it many
[44:02] times i know a lot of ministers and
[44:04] muchas versus
[44:06] ministers
[44:11] and they try to probe it these things
[44:12] and you try to figure them out
[44:16] but they get all mixed up
[44:19] because those mysteries porque estos
[44:21] mysterios were only given to one
[44:25] now
[44:27] what was one of the one of the main
[44:28] things was lost in the beginning
[44:33] of the spoken word el poder de
[44:49] [Music]
[45:16] you start to see
[45:30] or in other words they won't be fully
[45:31] manifest
[45:35] you'll see it here and there
[45:38] he says
[45:40] until
[45:41] these pencils get so tight
[46:41] the air oblah it's just as good if jesus
[46:44] christ himself
[46:48] because she is him
[46:51] and he is her el essaya i am bone of my
[46:53] bone west of the
[47:08] these
[47:49] i want to see these miracles taking
[47:52] a contestant i know i was baptized a
[47:54] certain way
[47:56] might not have been 100 on scripture
[48:00] but as long as i know in my heart
[48:06] you want to see original results
[48:10] you got to do original requirements
[48:14] that's brother tommy jr
[48:17] why because there is a correct way to
[48:19] receive the holy ghost
[48:23] there's a correct way to receive the new
[48:25] birth
[48:28] yes it does matter what church you go to
[48:32] it matters who you choose to be your
[48:34] pastor
[48:36] just about every church
[48:40] will speak about the supernatural
[48:43] they believe that god does miracles
[49:04] is not producing that
[49:09] but if a church follows
[49:12] more of what the church says
[49:53] god would not back all these miracles
[49:55] all these supernatural things
[49:57] he wouldn't back up
[50:01] if i wasn't preaching the truth
[50:05] so all these all these brothers out
[50:07] there they're they're wanting to see
[50:09] something
[50:22] scriptures say faith without works is
[50:23] dead
[50:36] just just to finish here let me skip
[50:38] over
[50:47] there's just something about
[50:49] when a confession comes from your mouth
[51:20] if what was in the mind of god in the
[51:22] beginning would have just stayed a
[51:23] thought
[51:30] we wouldn't even be here today
[51:34] but the power of the spoken word
[51:38] scripture says that he maketh
[51:40] intercession on your confession
[51:46] you young people i know it's like a
[51:48] roller coaster who says
[52:03] instead of just hearing the word
[52:07] i would take the word
[52:10] and i would start to dress myself up
[52:14] what does that mean i begin to apply it
[52:16] to me yes
[52:21] go from service to service and you don't
[52:22] feel changed you don't feel nothing
[52:27] we have the greatest revelation
[52:43] all the time
[53:27] he literally says para
[53:31] what's next
[53:40] but when you begin to exercise
[53:46] when you say
[53:48] enough's enough
[53:51] that's a garbage stop
[54:17] one day jesus
[54:18] got his finger and he drew a line in the
[54:20] sand
[54:34] you've got to draw your own line in the
[54:35] center
[54:36] as
[55:05] second corinthians 10
[55:07] second corinthians yes
[55:11] verse 4
[55:16] anything that stands between you and god
[55:32] i don't care if it's your friends no
[55:34] important
[55:36] amigos or if it's your family
[55:38] familia anything that stands before you
[55:40] and god
[55:44] it's gotta be torn down
[55:54] for the weapons of our warfare
[55:57] are not carnal but mighty through god to
[55:59] the pulling down of strongholds
[56:11] this is what you got to do now
[56:14] casting down imaginations
[56:17] arguments in every high thing
[56:21] that exalted itself against the
[56:23] knowledge of god
[56:27] and bringing into captivity
[56:32] every thought
[56:34] to the obedience of christ
[56:36] you've got to destroy every obstacle
[56:38] that stands between
[56:42] not
[56:55] give yourself to christ every single day
[57:00] you gotta make sure
[57:02] that nothing is standing between you and
[57:04] god
[57:19] throw it in the trash tonight
[57:24] [Applause]
[57:33] man god bless you this evening
[57:38] give our hand to our lord jesus christ
[57:40] and our servants
[57:45] and we don't we don't want to take too
[57:47] much of your time
[57:50] we'll get going if you'll stand for the
[57:52] reading of the scripture
[57:56] if you open your bibles in matthew 7.
[58:05] and it reads this
[58:06] way asking it shall be given you
[58:10] seek and ye shall find
[58:12] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[58:15] for everyone that seeketh receiveth and
[58:17] he that seeketh findeth into him that
[58:19] knocketh it shall be
[58:33] reading of the word you may take your
[58:47] so we see the scripture here
[59:17] your mental health
[59:20] it's in the book
[59:22] it's all right here
[59:24] and there's many times that we struggle
[59:26] to believe that
[59:29] you
[59:30] truly believe
[59:44] but you have to believe it
[59:48] there's many things that we go through
[59:54] we have our battles
[59:58] but who are we to deny his glory
[1:00:02] but if he chose to make something out of
[1:00:04] you
[1:00:06] who are you to deny his glory gloria
[1:00:15] right many times muchos misses
[1:00:19] we we think that we're too far gone
[1:00:23] we think that we've uh
[1:00:26] expensed all his all his grace
[1:00:31] but when he pleased the lord
[1:00:34] to separate me from my mother's womb
[1:00:38] to call me by his grace
[1:00:54] i believe
[1:01:09] when god takes a step towards you
[1:01:13] and you have to take a step next
[1:01:16] tomorrow
[1:01:17] we hear this many times
[1:01:20] god is a gentleman
[1:01:22] he's not to force you
[1:01:24] for
[1:01:24] he'll take a step towards you
[1:01:27] he'll make advances towards you
[1:01:30] but you have to take a step next
[1:01:32] tomorrow
[1:01:33] he's going to wait for you
[1:01:36] right many times we we think you
[1:01:38] pensamos muchas versus well brother
[1:01:42] i go to church
[1:01:44] i pray
[1:01:45] now i'm doing my part
[1:01:48] where where did god come in i i'm the
[1:01:50] one that's that's going to church
[1:01:56] brother if only you knew how far down
[1:01:58] you would be
[1:02:01] if he hadn't taken a step towards you
[1:02:03] first
[1:02:16] glory to god it was done before the
[1:02:18] foundation of the world
[1:02:21] again i say amen
[1:02:23] but it takes someone in this present
[1:02:25] time
[1:02:28] to be able to receive it
[1:02:31] i like something brother branham says
[1:02:46] when love has met its fail
[1:02:51] love has met its bill
[1:02:57] when love has met its failure
[1:03:07] and you can't have you can't have faith
[1:03:09] without love
[1:03:11] it's what i see in this quote right here
[1:03:14] we we find
[1:03:16] uh god extending his grace to us
[1:03:20] but love has to find its fill
[1:03:25] it has to find its place
[1:03:28] and what is because that is faith
[1:03:30] drawing
[1:03:33] it is pulling from that group
[1:03:37] we see jesus
[1:03:40] when when that woman touched the border
[1:03:42] of his garment
[1:03:50] and the disciples said
[1:03:52] jesus they they depress against you
[1:04:10] when love has met its fill
[1:04:12] amore
[1:04:13] right love has to be put into something
[1:04:16] it requires a dispenser
[1:04:20] right a dispenser
[1:04:23] it has to be able to hold something
[1:04:39] in africa
[1:04:41] in africa in uganda there to the man we
[1:04:43] were at the restaurant
[1:04:47] and he took the scripture
[1:04:50] matthew 6 verse 9 and 10. matteo says
[1:04:54] and here he is explaining this to to the
[1:04:56] man
[1:04:59] and it reads this way after this manner
[1:05:01] therefore pray ye
[1:05:03] our fathers that are in heaven hallowed
[1:05:05] be thy name
[1:05:06] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:05:08] earth as as it is in heaven
[1:05:19] so there he is telling this man to you
[1:05:22] know you know the lord's prayer you know
[1:05:23] the scripture
[1:05:27] and he tells them how does it read
[1:05:30] and he begins to say say
[1:05:32] hallowed be thy name
[1:05:48] you know they're kind of thinking trying
[1:05:50] to remember
[1:05:53] the recorder and brother caleb turns to
[1:05:55] them
[1:05:57] does it say on earth
[1:06:01] no it doesn't this is see it says in
[1:06:04] earth
[1:06:06] in earth
[1:06:08] and the in this vessel right here
[1:06:11] of clay the the the varroa it's where
[1:06:14] that will has to take place
[1:06:31] but it has to be dispensed right now
[1:06:36] yes it was all done before the
[1:06:38] foundation
[1:06:40] but there has to be someone to receive
[1:06:42] it right now
[1:07:00] but what sayeth the answer of god unto
[1:07:03] him
[1:07:04] i have reserved to myself seven thousand
[1:07:06] men
[1:07:07] who have not bowed the knee to the image
[1:07:09] of baal but okay led
[1:07:19] even so then
[1:07:20] at this present time
[1:07:22] also there is
[1:07:23] a remnant according to the election of
[1:07:26] grace
[1:07:41] there is a remnant
[1:07:44] that is called according to the election
[1:07:46] of greece
[1:07:49] i like something brother will told me
[1:07:51] one time algo comedy hermano williams
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:23] you know there's so much we have to do
[1:08:26] in one day we're going to do these great
[1:08:28] things

[1:08:35] transfer has to take place
[1:08:51] was made unto them i use and now i see
[1:08:54] evaluator that are transfers made unto
[1:08:56] us
[1:08:59] you say brother well you weren't here
[1:09:00] when our founding pastor was here
[1:09:04] understanding
[1:09:14] receive the father
[1:09:16] i like that brother
[1:09:20] you know many times we look at our past
[1:09:24] say brother i don't understand
[1:09:27] i've done so many things that are wrong
[1:09:32] that's good good for you
[1:09:36] but i have a god that is rich in mercy
[1:09:40] he's waiting on you
[1:09:42] because he's already made that step
[1:09:45] he took that step towards you
[1:09:48] now it just takes you
[1:09:51] to take a step back towards him
[1:09:54] to be able to look at this word
[1:09:57] to be able to say
[1:09:59] i will stand for you lord
[1:10:14] she had gone medic after medic
[1:10:19] just spent all her money
[1:10:21] trying to find a fix for her issues
[1:10:26] she had reached her end avial cansalo
[1:10:29] finn but once she did
[1:10:31] so she said if i can only touch the
[1:10:33] border
[1:10:37] you heard news of a little man coming to
[1:10:39] the city
[1:11:24] so she she was now all left all alone
[1:11:28] and she had this reproach that was
[1:11:30] following yesterday
[1:11:33] and perhaps you may feel the same way
[1:11:36] hey brother i i feel unclean
[1:11:40] i've done so many things that are wrong
[1:11:44] but if you only understood
[1:11:47] that it only takes for you
[1:11:50] to extend your hands
[1:11:58] you know many times we complicate it so
[1:11:59] much
[1:12:01] but it takes a simple act of faith
[1:12:05] to be able to reach your hand out but
[1:12:07] i'll cancer
[1:12:08] and say lord i accept you
[1:12:11] i accept my healing
[1:12:14] i accept my deliverance
[1:12:19] you know there's so much needless pain
[1:12:21] that we go through
[1:12:26] but did you know there's a pain that is
[1:12:28] needed
[1:12:30] how many know that

[1:12:47] he did job well
[1:13:03] frustration
[1:13:05] and not of peace
[1:13:08] his purpose to proposito is that after
[1:13:10] we have suffered
[1:13:14] a while we would be made perfect

[1:13:39] morning

[1:13:43] out even for a moment is
[1:14:09] it can be so hard to believe that

[1:14:12] faith
[1:14:27] so that you may have a long life but i
[1:14:28] could think uh yes
