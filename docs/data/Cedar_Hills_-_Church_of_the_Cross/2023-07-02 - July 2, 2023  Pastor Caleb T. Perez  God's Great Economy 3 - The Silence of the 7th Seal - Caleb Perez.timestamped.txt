[27:19] [Music]
[27:28] amen amen you may be seated we have a
[27:32] testimony by our sister Faith Gonzalez
[27:34] at this time testimonial also good to
[27:36] see our sister Naomi and her family
[27:38] there in the back bless you familiar no
[27:41] brother Brian was here or not I don't
[27:42] see him but God bless you good to have
[27:44] you with us Elizabeth
[27:53] India
[27:56] bear with me I'm a little bit nervous
[28:01] first of all I have to give God thanks
[28:04] uh for his grace and his Mercy remember
[28:11] back in may we had found out that we
[28:13] were pregnant
[28:18] and in June when we went for our
[28:20] ultrasound
[28:23] we found out that there was going to be
[28:25] two
[28:27] so our hearts are overjoyed and
[28:30] we're just so grateful to the Lord for
[28:32] his grace and his mercy
[28:36] and as I look back through all these
[28:38] years
[28:39] all I can see is God's grace and mercy
[28:45] and he he is the one that has brought me
[28:48] to this point
[28:50] so all honor and Glory goes to God and I
[28:53] just I want to thank him and I tell him
[28:54] that I love him so much
[28:59] uh we were gonna actually wait um until
[29:01] after my
[29:03] oyster to let everyone knows
[29:11] but as many of you know last weekend I
[29:14] had to go to the ER a few times
[29:19] and on Monday when they had did the
[29:22] ultrasound
[29:25] they had found that there was I had had
[29:27] a hemorrhage
[29:30] which is just they said that there was
[29:32] bleeding outside of the sack of the
[29:34] babies
[29:39] uh but both babies at the time they both
[29:42] had heartbeats and they were both doing
[29:44] fine
[29:46] um but they always tell you the worst
[29:48] when you're there I guess just to make
[29:50] you get nervous
[29:54] and they had told me with my history of
[29:57] miscarriages
[30:04] uh that it didn't look very good
[30:09] so the thoughts always come
[30:14] but as I went home I I had laid down and
[30:16] I was listening to a message
[30:20] from Brother Branham and it's called he
[30:22] that is in you
[30:25] and I just want to read this last part
[30:27] that was that was on there when I had
[30:30] heard it
[30:31] and brother Branham had said and now in
[30:34] the name of Jesus Christ
[30:39] the son of God
[30:41] renounce your Affliction
[30:45] your your sickness
[30:49] and say to it you have to go
[30:53] because you have your faith
[30:57] plus my faith
[30:59] with the power of Jesus Christ whose
[31:02] omnipresence is
[31:05] here to vindicate it and prove that he
[31:08] is here
[31:11] we'll make you well at this time
[31:14] and at that moment I had claimed my
[31:17] healing and I had claimed the promise
[31:19] that God had given me
[31:23] and a prayer request had went out
[31:26] um asking for prayer that they would
[31:28] pray for us for the situation
[31:32] and on Tuesday I went to see my doctor
[31:36] and we had another ultrasound
[31:40] and I want to give all glory to God
[31:43] because they did not find that
[31:44] Hemorrhage anymore
[31:46] it was completely gone there was no
[31:48] evidence of it at all
[31:52] and I just want to give him all glory
[31:56] and I want to thank each and every one
[31:58] of you
[32:00] that has prayed with us over the years
[32:02] who has given us encouragement
[32:05] I want to thank our pastor and sister
[32:07] Lorena
[32:09] Lorena it seems to never fail even when
[32:12] our pastor is gone he always reaches out
[32:14] and he wants to make sure that we're
[32:15] okay
[32:18] and I want to thank our brother Tommy Jr
[32:21] has been there with us this last week
[32:24] and he's called and he's checked on us
[32:26] and I just want to tell him that I
[32:28] appreciate him so much
[32:30] and I just asked for your continued
[32:32] prayers throughout this journey that

[37:44] and uh we have uh you probably have seen
[37:47] him already brother Salvador
[37:50] his wife and daughter
[37:53] and uh or you maybe some of you that
[37:55] don't know brother brother Caleb that's
[37:57] that's his dad all right
[38:00] Caleb so we're gonna ask if they would
[38:02] come
[38:04] we just want to extend our hand of
[38:07] Fellowship to them
[38:10] they moved from from Juarez
[38:14] we live here now and yeah even handing
[38:18] services and
[38:20] Fellowship
[38:22] he's been he's been waiting a long time
[38:26] to get here
[38:34] 2003 is uh I think the first time that
[38:38] that our pastor uh told him
[38:42] come over but I want you to come over
[38:44] the right way right I want you I want
[38:47] you to come over the right way so he
[38:49] waited this this many years and since
[38:52] we we want to give a more hand to
[38:55] Fellowship welcome them
[38:59] invite them to your house
[39:03] amen amen so God bless you it's a
[39:06] pleasure to have you here
[39:15] it just down to your feet and and uh
[39:18] and that's kind of funny how we say
[39:19] extend to your feet what other ways
[39:21] there to stand I guess
[39:27] amen we have with us uh
[39:31] uh the next
[39:33] uh message on the God's Great economy
[39:39] and I want to put a subtitle The Silence
[39:42] of the seventh seal is
[39:45] I don't know how far I'll make uh go
[39:48] today
[39:49] but we'll go as far as he allows us to
[39:54] and uh we want to of course keep in
[39:57] prayer brother brother Danny brother
[39:59] Julian and brother Jimmy who are there
[40:01] in Colombia ministering
[40:06] Colombia amen God bless them and bring
[40:08] them safely
[40:11] something that's very hard to understand
[40:13] in so many ways
[40:18] but I believe that for the day that we
[40:21] live in
[40:22] I believe and as I've always said and we
[40:26] always stand here in this church is
[40:29] The Book of Revelations is our books
[40:34] it's for this time
[40:36] and so as the Lord leads and as he opens
[40:40] a little at a time we'll take it
[40:42] whatever he gives us whenever he gives
[40:43] it to him
[40:47] so Revelations the eighth chapter in the
[40:50] first verse
[40:53] what a scripture
[40:57] how many know in Revelations chapter 6
[41:00] and you find the six seals right
[41:03] yes
[41:08] that's right and then and then you have
[41:11] this break in chapter seven and then and
[41:13] then you have one verse
[41:19] just one verse is all you get no symbols
[41:23] no living creatures
[41:27] there's like nothing going on
[41:33] this is what he says and when he had
[41:36] opened the seventh seal
[41:38] there was silence in heaven about the
[41:42] space of half an hour
[41:47] amen may God add His blessings to the
[41:49] reading of his word
[41:52] you may be seated I wonder if they can
[41:56] put up that this the the quote there
[41:58] that we're going to start with the
[42:00] message the seven seal
[42:03] God bless brother Jerry and sister Faith
[42:06] that was sure a wonderful testimony God
[42:09] is doing testimonials
[42:14] amen
[42:16] it starts off like this
[42:18] there's no service tonight so we're
[42:21] going to be relaxed okay
[42:24] and I haven't spoken to you in a little
[42:26] while
[42:28] can I get your undivided attention for
[42:31] eign amen I believe God has something
[42:35] for us today
[42:37] it is the secret
[42:40] that no one knows about
[42:43] John was forbidding
[42:46] to write about it
[42:48] even write a symbol about it
[42:54] this is why there was no activity
[43:02] amen now it doesn't say there's no
[43:05] activity on Earth no this is
[43:07] it says there's no activity in heaven is
[43:11] what he says
[43:13] it might give away the secret
[43:17] do you see it now
[43:20] now here he is preaching the seventh
[43:24] seal
[43:25] and we've always been taught in by our
[43:28] founding Pastor knowing that the seal is
[43:31] the heart the heart of a man
[43:35] yes amen once again the seal is the
[43:39] heart of a man being opened
[43:44] okay so so here we go as we as we as we
[43:47] read this together now
[43:49] he says he's asking you and I the
[43:53] question
[43:54] do you see it now
[43:58] it had been here there's nothing written
[44:02] about it and now he's asking the
[44:05] question do you see it now
[44:08] my question to you is that how many of
[44:12] you can say I see it now
[44:14] you have to have studied the seals and
[44:17] know where we're going with this
[44:20] but here is seven straight Thunders
[44:25] right in a row I
[44:28] one two one two three four five six
[44:31] seven that perfect number is
[44:39] now we have to we have to notice all
[44:42] these things okay
[44:44] it doesn't say Earth it says once again
[44:47] Heavens couldn't write that
[44:52] because it had to do with the Earth
[44:58] well I want to make sure I get this
[45:00] Foundation right for you
[45:03] Heavens could not write that
[45:06] because the book that had been closed
[45:10] in Revelations
[45:14] is the same book that is now open in
[45:17] Revelations chapter 10.
[45:21] yes is that right
[45:23] amen
[45:26] maybe some of you need a vacation
[45:31] but once again
[45:33] same book in Revelations 5 and mismo
[45:36] Libra Revelation is the same book in
[45:39] Revelations 10.
[45:40] now it's open and we understand what the
[45:44] book is
[45:46] the book is the title deed book of
[45:49] redemption
[45:52] it's the title deed to the Earth
[45:56] the Earth was made for man
[45:59] that's why heaven couldn't write nothing
[46:04] it had to do with the Earth
[46:07] it had to do with you and I yeah
[46:11] man's inheritance
[46:14] okay Heavens can't know about it
[46:18] not only couldn't Heavens write about it
[46:22] Kevin's can't know about it
[46:25] nothing else
[46:28] because there's nothing to go on
[46:35] there was silence in heaven
[46:38] can somebody tell me where Satan was
[46:45] was he on Earth or was he in heaven
[46:58] where was Saiyan
[47:03] in heaven
[47:05] or on Earth
[47:09] well here we go akivamos there was
[47:12] silence in heaven
[47:14] because it would give away the secret if
[47:16] anything moves
[47:19] and Satan was looking at this is
[47:23] not cast down from heaven until
[47:26] Revelations chapter 12.
[47:31] keep that in mind watch now
[47:36] Satan is watching closely
[47:40] any movement anything that will give
[47:43] away a secret
[47:46] he's looking for something that he can
[47:49] because he wants to cause Havoc
[47:53] he wants to keep you and I from this
[47:57] great promise
[48:00] but we understand that he's not able to
[48:04] God is in control
[48:06] this is God's Great economy
[48:28] it was
[48:32] so great
[48:36] till it was Kept Secret from the Angels
[48:41] imagine this morning there are things
[48:44] that are and have been revealed to us
[48:48] but Angels know nothing about Los
[48:51] Angeles
[48:52] how do you feel about yourself today
[49:20] he might do great damage
[49:24] there's one thing that he don't know
[49:27] now he can interpret anything he wants
[49:31] to when interpretation and he can
[49:34] impersonate any kind of gifts
[49:38] but he can't know this
[49:42] it's not even written in the word
[49:46] it's a total secret is
[49:49] and the angels everything shut up
[49:55] they were playing their Harps yes
[50:00] everything brother Ram says shut up
[50:05] if they made one move it might give
[50:09] something away
[50:12] so they just shut up
[50:15] they quit harping
[50:18] everything stopped seven
[50:22] accept him God's perfect number
[50:25] seven just right down the road
[50:30] seven Thunders uttered straight together
[50:35] like they were spelling something out
[50:40] notice at that time
[50:42] John started to write it
[50:46] and he said don't write it that's what
[50:50] the voice from Heaven told him
[50:52] don't ride him no let's don't write it
[50:55] no let's give us those online God bless
[50:57] you
[50:58] guys
[51:01] when the seven Thunders
[51:05] it wasn't something foreign
[51:22] was something that he he understood and
[51:24] then I'll go
[51:26] he could understand what had been
[51:29] released
[51:31] because the Bible said he was about to
[51:34] write it
[51:35] you don't write something that you don't
[51:38] understand
[51:40] he was about to rise
[51:42] but what was released by those Thunders
[51:47] was something that John
[51:50] as a type of the Bride
[51:52] he understood he got it but the voice
[51:57] says don't ride it no no you gotta hold
[52:01] that seal it up
[52:03] now watch it was as if it was spelling
[52:06] out something
[52:08] and then when as we see this progress
[52:12] this this story or this this this
[52:14] picture
[52:17] he was a commanded to seal these things
[52:20] up till future time
[52:24] it's not future time no more
[52:30] hello everybody again it's not future
[52:32] time no more
[52:35] it's present it's present it has come to
[52:38] our time we are living in this time
[52:43] Jesus never spoke of it Jesus
[52:47] John Couldn't Write it
[52:50] Angels know nothing about it
[52:53] what is it yes it's the thing that Jesus
[52:57] said
[52:58] even the angels of heaven didn't know
[53:01] nothing about it
[53:03] he didn't know it himself he said only
[53:07] God would know it so the opening of the
[53:11] seventh seals
[53:13] the seven Founders they're tied together
[53:15] right
[53:17] that's easy to understand
[53:19] because those seven Thunders were the
[53:21] third part of the Seven Seals
[53:24] how many remember that that the seven
[53:27] seal opened up in a three-fold manner
[53:29] right
[53:30] something happened yesterday
[53:33] didn't happen today
[53:38] now notice this now because there was
[53:42] silence in heaven
[53:44] because the activity was going on here
[53:48] on Earth
[53:50] all the seven still does is show you the
[53:53] scenes
[53:56] but the action or the activity is not in
[53:59] heaven
[54:01] reaction the activity is going on here
[54:04] on Earth
[54:05] now notice this now but he told us when
[54:10] we begin seeing these signs coming up
[54:15] now you're getting somewhere
[54:18] start to see these signs coming up
[54:21] you know you're getting somewhere
[54:25] watch how the holy spirit is showing
[54:29] even though there is silence in heaven
[54:33] there's activity go
[54:46] all right there's there's a reason we've
[54:48] heard many messages on this
[54:51] and his message is calling and
[54:55] manifesting other redeemed Sons
[54:59] if you want something to happen and we
[55:02] continue on that same message
[55:07] watch as the seventh seal has been
[55:10] opened
[55:12] and it is
[55:17] that that most people don't catch it
[55:21] they'll read through the Seven Seals and
[55:24] they'll say oh wow I didn't get much out
[55:26] of it
[55:27] I didn't understand this or that or this
[55:30] but watch as as the heart of this
[55:34] messenger is a
[55:42] how many of you want something to happen
[55:45] if you are looking for something to
[55:47] happen in your life
[55:49] he said if you want something to happen
[55:54] now you have to take my word for this
[55:59] he's not saying you have to take God's
[56:02] word
[56:04] we've already seen that through six
[56:07] Hills
[56:08] we've seen the Plan of Redemption
[56:12] but if you want to see something happen
[56:15] you have to take my word for this
[56:22] that's the hardest thing for God to do
[56:24] yes
[56:30] you'll have to take my word for this
[56:35] notice this now now how many are with me
[56:40] if I'm planning on doing something
[56:43] I know better than to tell anybody about
[56:45] it
[56:47] anybody ever been burnt
[56:51] if this has broke many relations right
[56:57] well they were my friend but then I told
[56:59] them something
[57:01] you put a lock on their mouth
[57:04] gave them a key to it
[57:07] but don't tell nobody okay
[57:12] itching ears all the time
[57:16] all the time huh never mind let me get
[57:19] it let me not get off
[57:21] Focus stay focused
[57:25] I know better than to tell anybody about
[57:27] it
[57:28] not that that person would tell it but
[57:32] you will hear it see
[57:36] he can't get it
[57:51] but only those that will receive it
[57:55] but they're going to receive it a
[57:57] certain way
[58:00] this is what I'm trying what I'm getting
[58:02] at today
[58:03] there's a certain way we receive the
[58:06] message
[58:08] because the whole world that has ears
[58:12] they can hear the message
[58:15] but only the bride
[58:18] knows what's between the lines
[58:21] because it happens in silence
[58:29] The Silence of the seventh seals
[58:32] there's a purpose for it
[58:35] all right we're getting to that now
[58:37] notice this now as we continue reading
[58:39] here you can get it in my heart
[58:44] as long as God has it closed up with the
[58:48] Holy Spirit
[58:50] that's between me and God
[58:54] he don't know nothing about it until you
[58:57] speak it
[58:59] then he hears it
[59:02] here we go now he's gotta he lest we
[59:06] speak it
[59:07] then he hears it
[59:09] he said remember Sam will try to
[59:12] impersonate
[59:15] personification everything that the
[59:17] church will do
[59:21] I'm not say it again
[59:24] will try to impersonate
[59:27] everything that the church will do
[59:30] he's tried to do it
[59:33] we notice it through the Antichrist but
[59:38] this one thing he cannot impersonate
[59:42] there'll be no mimics of this
[59:45] because he don't know it
[59:48] and that makes him madder than anything
[59:51] else
[59:52] that even Satan is upset
[59:56] because you and I know something
[1:00:01] I don't know if that excites you with an
[1:00:03] excitement
[1:00:05] can you imagine Saiyans upset at you
[1:00:09] no wonder he fights us so much
[1:00:12] he's trying to get into the promised
[1:00:15] land
[1:00:17] where is that promised land
[1:00:20] point to yourself
[1:00:22] see
[1:00:23] the promised land is the holy ghost that
[1:00:25] dwells inside of you
[1:00:28] it's the Holy Ghost
[1:00:30] Inside of You now watch this now no
[1:00:33] mimics no way of him to know this
[1:00:37] it's the third pool
[1:00:41] he just knows nothing about it
[1:00:45] and that third pool we we went over it
[1:00:48] already there's three parts of it
[1:00:53] what part are we in
[1:00:55] what part has been revealed
[1:00:58] depends what part you're talking about
[1:01:04] he knows nothing about it
[1:01:07] he doesn't understand it
[1:01:10] but there's a secret that lays beneath
[1:01:16] and then that's why brother Branham says
[1:01:21] it'll take you and I is
[1:01:25] to do something for God
[1:01:29] under that third pool
[1:01:32] oh
[1:01:59] there's so much here that I'm that I
[1:02:00] gotta you gotta just kind of control
[1:02:02] yourself
[1:02:03] but watch this now watch I I just love
[1:02:07] this easy and because Sam knows nothing
[1:02:10] about it
[1:02:12] there's only one way that he can do
[1:02:15] something about it
[1:02:21] Satan
[1:02:23] his greatest weaponas
[1:02:29] connect to a lot of things
[1:02:32] but his greatest weapon
[1:02:35] for you and I or against you and I and
[1:02:39] Contra Nuestra
[1:02:41] is called distraction is distraction
[1:02:48] okay we're gonna get to something here
[1:02:51] so you make sure that you follow me
[1:02:52] closely
[1:02:54] he knows nothing about it
[1:02:57] so he'll try to distract us
[1:03:01] from the Revelation ah
[1:03:05] he tries to distract us
[1:03:08] from knowing what has been sealed in our
[1:03:11] hearts
[1:03:14] what part of the groom we are
[1:03:18] going to try to keep you from
[1:03:20] understanding these things
[1:03:23] he's good at distraction
[1:03:26] get into this watch has this how this
[1:03:28] unfolds
[1:03:30] we know that this book once again
[1:03:33] the title deed book of all creation
[1:03:37] and he's revealing the lamb is revealing
[1:03:40] the Mysteries
[1:03:42] through the ministry of that Angels
[1:03:49] he's revealing his Secrets
[1:03:52] he's revealing these Mysteries
[1:03:55] through that Ministry
[1:03:59] notice once again in the message seven
[1:04:01] the seventh seal and then this 8th
[1:04:04] chapter only reveals the scene this is
[1:04:08] where nothing else is revealed now
[1:04:13] nothing else is revealed now nothing
[1:04:19] he goes on to say this it's
[1:04:23] revealing it says this is the word that
[1:04:26] as I've said many times that our pastor
[1:04:28] would always use
[1:04:32] brother Tommy has has a has this the
[1:04:35] Thunder's been revealed
[1:04:38] the seven seal completely been revealed
[1:04:43] it's revealing
[1:04:46] because it's a continual process
[1:04:50] it's the revealing
[1:04:53] now here's the key of what I want to get
[1:04:56] to now
[1:04:58] it's revealing
[1:05:00] of the seventh seals
[1:05:03] is perfectly mute is
[1:05:07] how can you reveal something when it's
[1:05:10] perfectly mute
[1:05:13] this is the Silence of the Seven Seals
[1:05:17] revealing and it's perfectly mute is
[1:05:22] silencio how can it be revealed and mute
[1:05:26] at the same time
[1:05:30] answer me the question on this is going
[1:05:32] to be revealing and be mute
[1:05:37] behold I send you Elijah the prophets
[1:05:43] it's revealingo
[1:05:46] but to those that don't understand
[1:05:52] it's mute
[1:05:55] because that means nothing to them
[1:06:01] is
[1:06:03] but in that silence you this is what
[1:06:08] we're trying to get across
[1:06:12] all the way back remember brother
[1:06:15] Abraham preaching on this
[1:06:18] it's perfectly mute
[1:06:21] but all the way back from Genesis you
[1:06:25] know there's the Genesis this seven seal
[1:06:27] is spoke of is
[1:06:33] you sound like a
[1:06:35] like a group that is excited
[1:06:41] you cannot you can't talk when your
[1:06:43] mouth is full huh
[1:06:45] all right let me give you that one
[1:06:49] notice this now
[1:06:51] all the way back from Genesis there's
[1:06:54] the Genesis the seventh seal is spoken
[1:06:56] of is
[1:06:59] how do you think he did creation
[1:07:01] six days and stay see us
[1:07:08] come on
[1:07:10] it's very good esta muy bueno all right
[1:07:14] well he he he he he made man in during
[1:07:17] the six days is that right
[1:07:19] but in the seventh day
[1:07:21] he rested where was he resting come on
[1:07:26] now he was resting in his sons
[1:07:30] in other words God was silence
[1:07:34] so that his son could speak
[1:07:37] this is my beloved Son this is
[1:07:46] how many are with me now come on now
[1:07:49] this is the this is the seventh seal
[1:07:51] from Genesis
[1:07:53] and if you don't catch the type
[1:07:57] you'll never understand the antetite
[1:08:02] the people say ah we don't need the Old
[1:08:04] Testament
[1:08:06] get the symbols
[1:08:10] you're lost over here
[1:08:13] watch as we continue reading this
[1:08:16] all the way back from Genesis there's
[1:08:18] the Genesis from the very beginning
[1:08:20] there's a principle and that's the
[1:08:22] reason now this is the message Christ is
[1:08:24] the mystery of God revealed
[1:08:27] and that's the reason there was silence
[1:08:29] in heaven
[1:08:31] base of half an hour
[1:08:35] and seven Thunders uttered their voice
[1:08:39] John was forbidden to write Ben
[1:08:45] what was he forbidden to write
[1:08:49] the coming of the Lord
[1:08:53] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[1:08:59] and when he says
[1:09:01] that means at some point he's going to
[1:09:04] reveal it's okay
[1:09:07] he hasn't revealed yet
[1:09:11] of how he will come and when he will
[1:09:15] come it's a good thing he doesn't
[1:09:19] know but but here's the key to that
[1:09:23] he has showed or revealed it
[1:09:28] in every type that's in the Bible
[1:09:32] so if you say we know nothing about it
[1:09:36] there was nothing else written
[1:09:40] but if you can go and see it through the
[1:09:43] whole scripture
[1:09:45] you'll find the type of it through the
[1:09:48] whole Bible
[1:09:52] amen
[1:09:54] how many are getting what I'm what I'm
[1:09:56] after today
[1:10:00] watch this figure things we continue on
[1:10:06] he showed it or rebuild it in every type
[1:10:09] that's in the Bible
[1:10:11] therefore the entire Bible is the
[1:10:13] revelation
[1:10:15] of God's mystery in Christ
[1:10:20] he says
[1:10:23] the entire Bible
[1:10:25] is an expression of one goal is that
[1:10:30] God has
[1:10:33] beginning
[1:10:34] that one purpose
[1:10:37] he wanted to to achieve in the entire
[1:10:41] Bible
[1:10:43] and all the acts of the Believers
[1:10:48] in the Bible has been in type
[1:10:52] and expressing what God's goal is
[1:10:59] I like that word
[1:11:04] in this last day
[1:11:07] he has revealed it and shows it
[1:11:12] and God's help
[1:11:14] we'll see it right here this morning
[1:11:18] and with God's help
[1:11:21] we'll see it here this morning
[1:11:26] why he doesn't leave it like it's that
[1:11:28] there's nothing left to it
[1:11:30] okay
[1:11:33] he got a message to preach
[1:11:36] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:11:39] Angels
[1:11:41] he would begin to sound
[1:11:44] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:11:48] he has declared to his servants
[1:11:52] but in order for him to reveal it to us
[1:11:57] we have to stop being so distracted
[1:12:04] we're gonna I'm turning a corner here
[1:12:09] most people say muchachente are not
[1:12:13] comfortable with silence
[1:12:20] The Silence of the seventh seals
[1:12:23] most people are not comfortable with
[1:12:25] science
[1:12:30] and yet you won't get the revelation of
[1:12:32] that any other way
[1:12:36] Spurgeon said this
[1:12:39] few men truly know themselves as they
[1:12:43] really are
[1:12:48] few men
[1:12:50] truly know themselves
[1:12:54] as they really are
[1:12:57] Solitude
[1:13:01] means being alone with yourself
[1:13:06] long enough to learn who you are
[1:13:11] wow I want to know
[1:13:14] how many of you know who you really are
[1:13:19] I believe that if we really knew who we
[1:13:22] are okay
[1:13:24] we wouldn't do a lot of the things that
[1:13:26] we do
[1:13:27] we wouldn't go to a lot of places that
[1:13:30] we go
[1:13:34] Plato said this
[1:13:37] an unexamined life is not worth living
[1:13:43] and that's why Satan fears one of the
[1:13:46] things he fears the most yes
[1:14:02] this one slapped me across the face
[1:14:06] once again
[1:14:08] Satan fear seeing us sit in silence
[1:14:12] because he don't know what's going on
[1:14:15] inside
[1:14:18] he doesn't know if God is revealing
[1:14:20] something
[1:14:24] islands is powerful Church
[1:14:30] silence is powerful
[1:14:36] ah you didn't tell your neighbor very
[1:14:37] well not your neighbor again like you
[1:14:40] mean it is powerful
[1:14:48] for you don't know what one is thinking
[1:14:53] two couples a couple fighting
[1:14:59] I know everything they're thinking
[1:15:02] do you know what really hurts
[1:15:05] when your spouse says something
[1:15:08] somebody tells you something
[1:15:11] then you just stay quiet
[1:15:14] you have no idea
[1:15:18] okay
[1:15:25] what's really going on
[1:15:27] it works in the other person
[1:15:31] and silencio the Silence of the seventh
[1:15:35] seal is
[1:15:36] what makes Satan crazy is
[1:15:44] silence is powerful
[1:15:47] Ecclesiastes 3 7 says
[1:15:51] a time to keep silence
[1:15:56] and the time to speak
[1:16:02] I'm gonna say it again
[1:16:04] time to keep silence
[1:16:07] and there's a time to speak
[1:16:09] we think that it's always a time to
[1:16:12] speak
[1:16:17] everybody knows everything
[1:16:19] we live in a day and age where everybody
[1:16:21] knows everything
[1:16:26] it's it that's the generation
[1:16:31] back when I was growing up in the 70s
[1:16:34] if you didn't know something
[1:16:37] you just didn't know it
[1:16:40] what do you think I don't know
[1:16:42] saying you would leave it at that yeah
[1:16:45] not today I Wanna Know
[1:16:51] all we know is that people fact check
[1:16:53] each other all the time
[1:16:56] watch they're saying is
[1:17:03] that's the day and age
[1:17:07] doesn't know what it's like to not know
[1:17:11] they don't like to not know that's
[1:17:16] there's a lot of good things but a lot
[1:17:17] of bad things
[1:17:19] amen I mean these young people can pick
[1:17:22] up an instrument and
[1:17:24] a couple days later they're playing it
[1:17:26] you're like
[1:17:28] here we are in the 70s
[1:17:32] like no no
[1:17:34] no no but now there's techniques and
[1:17:35] everybody learns from each other
[1:17:38] knowledge has increased
[1:17:43] I want to ask you this question
[1:17:46] because silence is very uncomfortable
[1:17:51] we did this I believe brother brother
[1:17:53] brother brother Diego brother Tommy did
[1:17:55] this in one of the
[1:17:57] uh
[1:17:59] couple seminars that we had
[1:18:02] um
[1:18:05] how many of you have you couples have
[1:18:08] sat there what does this
[1:18:10] and looked at each other for five
[1:18:12] straight men he said
[1:18:18] yeah how many of you have ever done it
[1:18:19] for four minutes
[1:18:26] two minutes
[1:18:29] two minutes
[1:18:32] one minute
[1:18:39] 30 seconds
[1:18:43] anybody
[1:18:44] alien geez no wonder
[1:18:47] we're in their condition women
[1:18:53] say hombre a man
[1:18:57] how many of you can actually look at
[1:18:59] each other for that long cartoons
[1:19:04] when you're looking into the windows of
[1:19:07] the souls
[1:19:08] and you look into that person
[1:19:11] and there's so many things that start to
[1:19:13] come up
[1:19:15] especially when we're mad we're not
[1:19:16] going to do that is
[1:19:18] counsel you to do that
[1:19:21] even for two three minutes
[1:19:25] don't say a word though
[1:19:28] silence is powerful
[1:19:31] the Bible says we see through a glass
[1:19:34] Darkly
[1:19:36] but then face to face
[1:19:39] what will we do if we can't even see our
[1:19:43] spouse face to face
[1:19:46] how will we ever see God
[1:19:52] some years back
[1:19:55] NBC they aired this project
[1:20:00] and they showed the powerful emotions
[1:20:05] that Rose to the surface
[1:20:09] simply because the space provided was
[1:20:13] silence
[1:20:16] a mother looking at her son
[1:20:19] and they did it for four minutes
[1:20:26] how many of you parents have ever looked
[1:20:28] at your children
[1:20:29] or four minutes foreign
[1:21:15] and silencio the son told of how
[1:21:19] grateful he felt
[1:21:22] thinking about how much his mother had
[1:21:25] sacrificed
[1:21:28] a father told how much potential he saw
[1:21:32] in his daughter's future
[1:21:36] truly silence is not comfortable
[1:21:40] but it's so powerful
[1:21:43] that it's so scarce
[1:21:48] all because Satan knows nothing of the
[1:21:52] seventh seals
[1:21:54] and all he can do is use his favorite
[1:21:58] weapon distractions
[1:22:02] if you can put it up there
[1:22:06] what's this now this all goes together
[1:22:09] and is it okay if I hit the two-hour
[1:22:12] Mark today
[1:22:14] relax the rest of the day
[1:22:17] no this is now proverbs 4 25. let thine
[1:22:21] eyes look right on
[1:22:23] and let thine eyelids look straight
[1:22:26] before D is
[1:22:32] here's another version
[1:22:35] keep your eyes straight ahead
[1:22:38] and ignore all the sideshow distractions
[1:22:45] that's hard to do is
[1:22:49] there are distractions like we have like
[1:22:51] there has never been in the history
[1:22:54] and all these sideshows keep us from
[1:22:58] hearing the Lord
[1:23:02] all these side shows
[1:23:04] and our minds are going a million miles
[1:23:07] an hour
[1:23:13] how many of you ever get exhausted by
[1:23:15] thinking too much
[1:23:21] got some deep
[1:23:24] deep
[1:23:25] the Lord had told me twice
[1:23:39] you think that I'd get
[1:23:41] that I understand what he was getting it
[1:23:44] what did that mean that was my question
[1:23:49] what do you mean by too fast
[1:23:52] was I going on too many trips
[1:23:57] was I giving too much attention to
[1:23:59] things that don't matter
[1:24:02] was I too distracted
[1:24:05] or maybe I was trying to get ahead of
[1:24:08] God's plan
[1:24:10] I needed to know what it meant
[1:24:13] the day that me and my wife left
[1:24:17] we were at the airport in El Paso
[1:24:21] I I we were waiting for the plane we
[1:24:23] entered into this little store
[1:24:27] I wasn't looking for nothing
[1:24:30] just waiting she was buying some snacks
[1:24:33] and I walked by this place where they
[1:24:36] had some books
[1:24:40] and now it jumps the word distress
[1:24:44] distraction
[1:24:47] and I picked it up distraction
[1:24:51] I don't know who he is
[1:25:00] people ask many times is it okay to read
[1:25:03] other books or this is
[1:25:05] no you have to have enough discernment
[1:25:08] yeah
[1:25:09] every time I read a book
[1:25:13] I always pass it through my filter
[1:25:18] the word of God the bible
[1:25:21] message of the hours
[1:25:23] and if it doesn't go line up with that
[1:25:26] I toss it
[1:25:29] but there are things many times that'll
[1:25:31] stand out
[1:25:33] such as brother Branham picking up that
[1:25:36] that package of of cigarettes
[1:25:46] but as I began to read this
[1:25:50] I felt the Lord speaking to me
[1:25:54] distractions
[1:25:56] once again keep your eyes straight ahead
[1:26:01] and ignore all the sideshow distractions
[1:26:05] how many can do that
[1:26:10] and there was silence in heaven yeah
[1:26:13] about the space of half an hour
[1:26:16] We're living at the end time
[1:26:19] there are more distractions than there
[1:26:23] has ever been yeah
[1:26:28] and they're for free
[1:26:31] you don't have to pay to go to the show
[1:26:33] anymore wow
[1:26:38] what is
[1:26:42] a woman
[1:26:44] that's a sideshow it's a sideshow right
[1:26:47] you got all this wherever you turn
[1:26:49] wherever you go
[1:26:50] buy Flags everywhere I
[1:26:53] mean
[1:26:57] we get into these things and we hear and
[1:26:59] we look you know what oh my goodness all
[1:27:03] this stuff is
[1:27:15] I don't think they like this this
[1:27:17] message
[1:27:19] well I'm gonna preach it anyways
[1:27:23] watch this now he can say
[1:27:26] we are called to be Overcomers
[1:27:31] in this time of Sideshow
[1:27:37] we're called to be Overcomers
[1:27:40] but when it's all said I'm not talking
[1:27:42] about the sideshows out there
[1:27:46] I'm talking about the drama that's in
[1:27:49] the church
[1:27:50] I'm talking about the drama inside me
[1:27:56] Hallelujah
[1:27:57] forget the unbeliever
[1:28:00] I'm worried about their side shows
[1:28:06] why is there drama all the time in US
[1:28:17] everything turn in your face
[1:28:21] that you do not walk in that line with
[1:28:24] him
[1:28:27] what's distractions distractions we're
[1:28:31] distracted by our feelings
[1:28:34] I don't feel like that right
[1:28:38] we're distracted by what we think
[1:28:41] we're distracted by what we want foreign
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:56] to bring it closer to home
[1:28:59] what becomes the cost of our
[1:29:02] distractions
[1:29:08] I can stay a long time on this or a
[1:29:10] little bit of time
[1:29:13] distractions distractions
[1:29:16] cost has to be paid
[1:29:21] if I'm with my wife and I'm not paying
[1:29:23] attention to her
[1:29:27] there's a cost
[1:29:29] to pay sooner or later
[1:29:32] yes or yes
[1:29:34] we don't pay attention to the children
[1:29:38] there's a cost you're going to pay
[1:29:42] oh now you want me to go to church
[1:29:46] now you want me to do things right
[1:29:51] because we were distracted
[1:29:56] hello everybody
[1:29:58] and there was silence in Heaven
[1:30:01] Help Us this day
[1:30:06] what has it cost us
[1:30:09] by not paying attention to what God is
[1:30:12] trying to help foreign
[1:30:25] foreign
[1:30:56] and I go on yeah
[1:30:58] all right
[1:31:01] why will a man go with another woman or
[1:31:03] a woman go with another man that's not
[1:31:04] their spouse
[1:31:08] why will a man look at another man
[1:31:11] why will a woman look at another woman
[1:31:16] what's up with these distractions
[1:31:21] what would cause a human being to want
[1:31:23] to change their sex foreign
[1:31:49] they're everywhere
[1:31:51] they're on our phones on our tablets
[1:31:55] games and programs
[1:31:59] apps and pictures and movies
[1:32:02] and they're all there to stimulate you
[1:32:06] and shape your mind
[1:32:10] shape your desires
[1:32:13] into a bottomless pit
[1:32:16] where you can never get enough
[1:32:20] you look at one woman that's that's
[1:32:23] naked
[1:32:24] and you can't get enough
[1:32:28] a bottomless pit has been opened
[1:32:35] spirit that has come from the bottomless
[1:32:39] we become a pit ourselves
[1:32:43] bill of every filthy and foul bird that
[1:32:46] there is
[1:32:53] but I come to the realization
[1:32:57] because we can always say ah
[1:32:59] this is a distraction
[1:33:02] you got your phone on you
[1:33:11] the phone is a distraction
[1:33:14] the tablet
[1:33:17] when I really looked at that I come to
[1:33:20] understand
[1:33:22] the tablet in the phone
[1:33:25] are you just a conduit
[1:33:28] to get information from here to there
[1:33:33] the real distraction is not the phone or
[1:33:37] the tablets
[1:33:39] attraction is the sin inside your heart
[1:33:44] come on now it's not a problem with
[1:33:47] phones or tablets
[1:33:54] yes or yes COC why do we do that there's
[1:33:58] a sin problems
[1:34:04] I hope that hit good
[1:34:24] and keep it alive
[1:34:26] by these distractions foreign
[1:34:32] I just can't seem to get the new birth
[1:34:39] great message brother Henry thank you
[1:34:41] Sacramento Henry I can't get it no
[1:34:44] you're feeding that no nature this is
[1:35:07] I'm challenging everyone today
[1:35:15] every time we're distracted
[1:35:19] an opportunity is lost
[1:35:23] when I sit there in my study and I'm
[1:35:25] distracted by problems or whatever's
[1:35:27] going on foreign
[1:35:46] distract
[1:35:47] Ed
[1:35:49] comes from you break it down this is
[1:35:52] away from Latin
[1:36:00] so to distract is to draw
[1:36:03] away from
[1:36:06] oh get into something good here
[1:36:10] it literally means
[1:36:13] to draw away from
[1:36:17] where we talk about three pools how many
[1:36:20] of you know that Satan also has three
[1:36:22] people
[1:36:26] yeah
[1:36:28] we're going to get to that in a momentum
[1:36:32] then if distract means to draw away from
[1:36:35] some things
[1:36:38] then distraction
[1:36:41] means to lose momentum
[1:36:44] or to lose traction
[1:36:47] isn't that what happens many times
[1:36:50] we heard that we come to the to church
[1:36:54] we come to the altars
[1:36:57] and we got a little traction
[1:37:00] you got a little momentum
[1:37:05] we lose
[1:37:07] one because we're distracted
[1:37:12] distractions in our life
[1:37:15] to lose
[1:37:20] traction
[1:37:21] watch this now we've all I think been
[1:37:24] all been stuck before right
[1:37:58] you've been distracted
[1:38:05] distract means to disturb or trouble
[1:38:08] greatly in the mind
[1:38:13] it's to be said
[1:38:15] no wonder the Bible says in Hebrews 12.
[1:38:18] foreign
[1:38:49] in all actuality it's all the unbelief
[1:38:52] in us that's causing the distractions
[1:38:58] never deal with it
[1:39:05] we cover up the distractions by noise
[1:39:13] and there was Silence
[1:39:16] about the space of foreign
[1:39:20] we cover it up
[1:39:22] with noise
[1:39:23] conrito with musica
[1:39:28] who always has music playing in their
[1:39:30] car when they get in music
[1:39:36] not saying it's wrong to listen to music
[1:39:38] when that's all there is and there is no
[1:39:41] reflection
[1:39:43] something's wrong reflection we cover it
[1:39:46] up by movies and talking and laughing
[1:39:48] and noise everywhere
[1:39:51] because that's just the way we deal with
[1:39:58] there's a place in Minneapolis Minnesota
[1:40:01] Minneapolis Minnesota I ever go back to
[1:40:04] Minnesota I would like to go to this
[1:40:06] place
[1:40:08] called the orfield labs
[1:40:11] the orfield labs orphan lamps
[1:40:15] Laboratories it is the quietest room in
[1:40:19] the world
[1:40:23] it is an anechoic chamber the camera
[1:40:32] it is so quiet this room
[1:40:36] that the longest anyone has ever stayed
[1:40:39] in it is 45 minutes
[1:40:43] humans cannot handle that kind of
[1:40:45] silence
[1:40:49] and all you can hear in that room is
[1:40:53] your heart beating
[1:40:56] and your lungs breathing is
[1:40:59] all you hear is
[1:41:03] in only 45 minutes
[1:41:07] staying too long causes you to
[1:41:09] hallucinate
[1:41:13] there was silence in heaven about this
[1:41:20] I don't know you you that are spiritual
[1:41:22] get your stinking caps on those
[1:41:24] questions
[1:41:27] silence in heaven silencio but on Earth
[1:41:30] there was a heart beating
[1:41:33] why not could hear anything else
[1:41:37] but a heart was beating
[1:41:40] silence in heaven
[1:41:42] but on Earth
[1:41:45] your heart is beating
[1:41:48] and the Breath of Life is blowing
[1:41:51] nobody is in action
[1:41:53] there's work being done here on Earth
[1:41:57] oh my Lord I pray we can get this
[1:42:01] oh what is this now I just want I want
[1:42:03] to teach this more than just preach this
[1:42:08] what we have to do then
[1:42:11] is that real distraction is
[1:42:15] not what we see in here
[1:42:18] all those those things are just foreign
[1:42:30] silence is powerful
[1:42:33] and it forces you to look inside
[1:42:40] okay
[1:42:41] how many of you have looked for one
[1:42:44] minute at yourself in your eyes in the
[1:42:46] mirror
[1:42:49] and ask yourself who are you is
[1:42:53] where did you come from what are you
[1:42:55] doing look at yourself in the eyes
[1:43:00] you'll get uncomfortable with yourself
[1:43:03] after a while
[1:43:07] you ever talk to somebody they're like
[1:43:09] that's usually when you know somebody's
[1:43:11] been talking about you
[1:43:16] look in the eyes
[1:43:19] yeah you're good to go
[1:43:24] let me not get off
[1:43:27] preach about 100 messages after this
[1:43:30] it forces you look foreign
[1:43:50] and to most people
[1:43:52] and all the noise has stopped and they
[1:43:54] sit in silence
[1:43:57] they find themselves themselves alone
[1:43:59] with a strain translated
[1:44:06] they have no idea who they are
[1:44:10] why okay because we automatically turn
[1:44:13] up the noise
[1:44:16] gotta hear something
[1:44:18] turn the noise
[1:44:25] you got to deal with all the choices
[1:44:26] you've made
[1:44:28] and if you've never dealt with them the
[1:44:32] holy spirit will tell you deal with them
[1:44:36] do what's right
[1:44:40] and quit being distracted
[1:44:45] David David was a man after God's Own
[1:44:48] Heart
[1:44:50] how many of you talk to yourself
[1:44:56] I know that's weird
[1:44:59] you've heard the expression right it
[1:45:02] says not if you talk to yourself
[1:45:09] Reno
[1:45:21] okay how many of you want to start
[1:45:23] talking to yourself
[1:45:26] um
[1:45:34] loud it can be it can be within yourself
[1:45:39] but David gave us a key
[1:45:42] man after God's Own Heart
[1:45:46] that he would talk to himself in Psalms
[1:45:49] 42 5.
[1:45:51] he he was in a not a very good place
[1:45:54] down and depressed
[1:45:58] instead of sitting there bummed out
[1:46:01] you know what he did started talking to
[1:46:04] himself
[1:46:05] and he asked his own soul
[1:46:08] why art thou cast down on my soul
[1:46:12] oh why can't we do that
[1:46:15] we don't feel good we feel down
[1:46:18] I'm not asking your soul why are you you
[1:46:22] dead why are you cast down and feeling
[1:46:24] that way
[1:46:26] come on I challenge you to look at
[1:46:28] yourself in the mirror
[1:46:29] look through your eyes into your soul
[1:46:35] oh my soul
[1:46:37] and why are you disquieted in me
[1:46:45] why are you in a rage
[1:46:48] why are you mourning
[1:46:51] why are you troubled
[1:46:54] hope thou in God
[1:46:56] or I shall yet praise him for the help
[1:47:00] of his countenance
[1:47:02] his first address was to his own soul
[1:47:06] and the condition it was in
[1:47:10] he questions his soul
[1:47:15] and now that he's made his soul aware
[1:47:21] that there is only hope that is in God
[1:47:25] now he turns to God
[1:47:29] do you see how backwards we are
[1:47:32] we always go to God I don't know why
[1:47:35] this is happening why this is
[1:47:38] to do something for us we're doing it
[1:47:41] backwards
[1:47:44] when you when you've got got the answer
[1:47:49] so why are you acting like
[1:47:54] why are you down in the dumps
[1:47:59] no that God is my help no service
[1:48:03] you know these things
[1:48:10] then he turns to God
[1:48:14] foreign
[1:48:48] more noise that there ever has been
[1:48:51] many voices muchas versus music music
[1:48:55] ideas
[1:48:56] Expressions entertainment
[1:48:59] so little self-reflection
[1:49:04] yeah we don't seem to catch the enemy in
[1:49:07] his tactics
[1:49:15] somebody know that Satan has three pools
[1:49:20] no
[1:49:24] not even Savvy Mr Naomi God bless you
[1:49:29] know anybody
[1:49:32] uh if you don't know your enemy how you
[1:49:35] know
[1:49:35] you gotta know your enemies
[1:49:38] you gotta know he's got three pools too
[1:49:42] let's go into that just for a moment
[1:49:44] minuto
[1:49:47] a pool is a stage of ministry
[1:49:51] and he's got three stages of his
[1:49:53] ministry
[1:49:54] and under each pool or stage
[1:49:58] he has something to do
[1:50:01] and his job is to distract
[1:50:05] but where he used to distract at the
[1:50:08] early churches
[1:50:13] so his ministry had to continue climbing
[1:50:17] he could distract you and I
[1:50:20] mean
[1:50:24] so his ministry keeps continues he
[1:50:27] continues to learn
[1:50:29] he knows exactly how we are
[1:50:32] who knows what turns us on and what
[1:50:34] turns us off
[1:50:36] notice this now
[1:50:38] under this
[1:50:40] is how God unfolds his great economy
[1:50:45] Satan's trying to distract us from this
[1:50:48] great plans
[1:50:50] and it's through these pools that God is
[1:50:53] manifesting himself
[1:50:58] and is drawing us to himself
[1:51:02] but Satan is also drawing
[1:51:08] to draw away from
[1:51:11] God is pulling you to himself
[1:51:15] say it is drawing you away from God
[1:51:20] all right we got that let's see then how
[1:51:24] he does this
[1:51:26] how many knows then as his ministry what
[1:51:29] his three his three pools are what is
[1:51:40] nobody
[1:51:47] his three pools brother random says
[1:51:50] he says he doesn't use the word pulls he
[1:51:53] used his ministry
[1:51:57] of hell is
[1:52:00] the Antichrist elante Cristo the false
[1:52:04] prophet is
[1:52:07] and it's all the self-same spirit
[1:52:11] you got it the Trinity of Hell
[1:52:16] watch how he distracts
[1:52:19] what is he trying to do
[1:52:22] discredit the Trinity of Heaven
[1:52:26] Father Son and Holy Spirit
[1:52:29] oh not three gods or three persons but
[1:52:33] the real Trinity is one God in three
[1:52:36] offices
[1:52:37] now watch what brother Ram says in the
[1:52:40] first seal please
[1:52:44] it's three stages
[1:52:48] three stages of the same devil power
[1:53:18] but one of these days saying is himself
[1:53:21] is kicked out
[1:53:23] and he calms down and takes over the
[1:53:28] place where the demon was
[1:53:31] and then the devil is Incarnate in a man
[1:53:35] just repeating him itself

[1:55:17] because he's trying to stop God's Great
[1:55:19] economy impossible
[1:55:23] impossibly
[1:55:28] for this is the full expression
[1:55:33] is the full expression of what God had
[1:55:37] in his mind
[1:55:41] still wraps it all up
[1:55:48] and only his bride can receive this
[1:55:52] Revelation
[1:55:55] this book is already open
[1:55:58] right just waiting for the seventh seal
[1:56:02] to be identified
[1:56:05] of the coming of Christ
[1:56:08] I'm going to say it again the seven just
[1:56:11] waiting for the seventh seals to be
[1:56:16] identified
[1:56:18] of the coming of Christ
[1:56:21] after the seals brother Brown preaches
[1:56:23] the message
[1:56:26] that are in prison now
[1:56:32] how many of you have heard that message
[1:56:39] wow
[1:56:42] that's amazing
[1:56:44] you know what that shows distractions
[1:56:56] no wonder sometimes I've heard people
[1:56:58] well we should just put on the tapes
[1:57:05] well if you don't listen to them at home
[1:57:07] we're gonna have you listen them
[1:57:08] somewhere
[1:57:12] and we're Malachi for believers
[1:57:16] and we've never heard the message Souls
[1:57:20] that are imprisoned
[1:57:21] what are you doing with your time
[1:57:26] man
[1:57:27] but I bet you you can say every movie
[1:57:30] that Disney has put out
[1:57:33] you can see every Disney song
[1:57:36] and we know everything about that is
[1:57:43] Eggman that breaks God's heart
[1:57:47] gives us the very message
[1:57:50] how will we ever be ready
[1:57:53] how will we even know when there's a
[1:57:55] Rapture
[1:57:59] we're distracted no wonder that the lord
[1:58:03] gave me this message
[1:58:05] people they're distracted
[1:58:10] there's too much out there that gets
[1:58:12] your attention
[1:58:21] you could stop preaching and just ask
[1:58:23] God for Mercy this morning
[1:58:27] exactly what brother Branham was feeling
[1:58:30] is
[1:58:32] when he preached Souls that are in
[1:58:35] prison
[1:58:36] he preached it after the seals
[1:58:41] and he was struggling listen to that
[1:58:43] message
[1:58:44] you'll hear the prophet of God
[1:58:46] struggling
[1:58:48] because in that message
[1:58:50] he knows the lamb has already opened the
[1:58:53] cells
[1:58:55] and what he's struggling with
[1:58:58] there's still Mercy or not
[1:59:01] he's preaching the message
[1:59:03] he's struggling I don't know but could
[1:59:06] it be could it be
[1:59:09] if he wanted to find out
[1:59:22] then he found out
[1:59:24] that there was Mercy but the only Mercy
[1:59:28] there was
[1:59:30] in Christ the word
[1:59:33] that had been revealed by the Lambs
[1:59:39] that was it that's the only Mercy that
[1:59:41] there is
[1:59:43] you'll find that Mercy nowhere else but
[1:59:46] in his bride
[1:59:50] if hearing the message is not the most
[1:59:53] important thing to you
[1:59:56] you're distracted
[1:59:59] well Rouse you're just not called
[2:00:02] maybe we're called to just be church
[2:00:04] members

[2:01:13] but we know when the next movie's coming

[2:01:57] people Revelation from heart to heart
[2:02:05] Sangre
[2:02:09] en a hen
[2:02:14] that's the heartbeat
[2:02:17] the predestinated
[2:02:19] for the word of the Lord comes to them
[2:02:23] and they are the word to the people
[2:02:27] written Epistles

[2:03:05] and those that seek Him from a willing
[2:03:13] I say this
[2:03:16] what if it is but I'm asking all these
[2:03:18] questions
[2:03:20] look at the scriptures piled in here
[2:03:24] could it be is the third pool to preach
[2:03:28] to the Eternal Dooms
