and objectives are i just want to thank the lord i want to give a real quick testimony i just want to say thanks to the lord first of all [Music] but i said i'm gonna leave silver city on this date [Music] [Music] [Music] mail carrier in the lifetime of ever contracts [Music] in silver city made over 60 60 000. so it was ridiculous and they told me well you're going to have to have brand new cars you have to have four brand new cars to come you know for this contract and the lady called me as soon as she received it and she said uh we are going to award you the contract [Music] okay lydia let me think about it right so i i hung up and then i thought about it for a few seconds or a minute and i said no you know i promised the lord i was gonna move i said i know and it sounds crazy and so don't think that i came over here real victorious right oh i just did something for the lord he was able to get me a job [Music] they're at the satellite shop with for the wheel manual and so i remember telling him and i don't know if he remembers this i was telling him about that contract and he said you know what so at the time actually i was going to actually i was in the position where i could actually force though so i was going to buy some land in a house in silver city in silver city and so while that went out the door right i think i came here with i think i had maybe and this would be pushing it all right so so i was you know i was telling brother caleb this one day at brother emilio's house [Music] the lord has been faithful amen and he's never slack concerning his promises [Music] but in all those years that was um what 14 years ago and i thank him for all that he's done i wanted to give up many times but i had to just stay focused and if there's anything i can tell you tonight [Music] as we stand to our feet to read our scriptures there's many things that a christian must do but i want to name three of them you gotta stay humble [Music] right and it's found first in in acts 236 236. i got to get my glasses on grandpa right all right let's see where we're at you're 236. they say therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that the pastor hath made the same jesus no the bishop has made this same jesus the minister no no that god hath made that same jesus jesus whom he have crucified both lord and christ may the lord add his blessings to the word of reading of the word [Music] now we see here you can be seated we see here that god hath made now many times we say now how many here tonight believe in jesus and jesus right now how many here tonight believe green that jesus christ that jesus fair how many believe that god sent us a prophet ryan as we heard on sunday domingo when the word of the lord comes to that prophet or that prophecy comes to him oh it's a prophet how many in every detail in every single detail i got to repeat it again yesterday today and forever in every detail except he's the same yesterday now if a preacher says that the days of miracles is passed that's a seed of discrepancies when a man stands and says that he's a minister a pastor of a church somewhere and does not believe that jesus christ is is when they say there's no such thing as divine healing [Music] let's right that they have a leader which is the holy spirit now the holy spirit can guide you but christ is always going to point you back to the same christ he's going to never point you to something else he's going to always that is not the same in i want to go back to a little story about salt we find out that when saul when god has spoken to samuel and he told samuel he said that saul was lost right so i'm kind of like kind of dramatic or dreamy right so when i hear backslide i automatically think automatically or a picture like a hill you know because i like to be in the mountains right so i picture this hill and i'm climbing up this hill or this person's climbing up especially and they get to a like a slippery slope right and they and they and they slip and they slide down the hill i'll admit that he backslid he brought up all them sacrifices and things sacrificially when samuel through the word of god told him to destroy everything right [Music] and so sometimes when the pastor tells us to do something the word of the lord came through samuel and brought [Music] otherwise you're going to be chasing the word of god when god hath made the same jesus both lord and christ and you're over here focusing on the word of god [Music] instead of following the word of god just exactly like it says you put now now he was talking about saul and then all of a sudden now he's talking to us he there's where you backslid oh i thought drinking was backsliding i thought you were smoking doing all these things no he put your own opinion in it that's where you backslid when god has an anointed man to guide you now david was a pastor everybody nowadays wants to be a pastor and then they self-proclaim that they're not pastors and then they proclaim that they're not pastors was talking about how these sheep land they get these bots or worms does uh worms or bots right so now what happens to coos deer [Music] especially in the desert in like in arizona they get these worms that go into their nose and then they they um [Music] can you imagine he's full of these bots inside his throat [Music] right when that sheep gets infected like that he starts getting closer to the other sheep and to relieve those that is don't matter how strong he is don't matter if he's a strong sheep it just happens and then guess who has to go and take care of the problem [Music] does in his little bag and the only thing that relieves those insects is when the pastor throws puts that oil on to be a pastor man over there where i keep my horses and i was gonna bring you guys the video um the guy who owns a bunch of sheep [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's even one that he just even loses his voice and i'm like man and the lord tells me that's exactly what the pastor deals with right back to back to the backslide right so samuel was commissioned to go down there or excuse me and destroy everything utterly everything i have a [Music] because he had formed his own opinions of christ of his day jesus christ being the same yesterday right and on the sabbath day in in itself and here's the pharisees and described they come to him and they say hey what are you doing picking jesus have you not ever read the scripture where david was in hungary they ate the shoe bread but as long as you don't recognize the now aorta we must stay focused now i don't know a lot of things but i do know [Music] [Music] [Music] right and just because you ride a bull doesn't make you a cowboy or a horseman right [Music] [Music] is [Music] some people like mules right brother says [Music] wait his whole life to kick you [Music] you can't get that thing when he when he he's so stubborn okay and so when i thought about that as brother caleb was preaching there how long will you hold between two opinions um because he formed his own opinion and when a horse forms his own opinion the instinct inside of him is not the new birth now we're not talking about mules and horses we're talking about us [Music] he stops gonna stay there like a dummy and he'll just stand there until a mountain lion comes and eats them so we must stay focused on joshua fought the battle of jericho leader now god's army or electricity close up your mind and just don't stop for nothing brother says don't don't stop for nothing don't think of anything the devil has got to offer you through your senses don't use your senses and the word of god [Music] what [Applause] as we heard you know what stay together means [Music] and you know [Music] but you do it's packed with revelations [Music] if we can just really just close our eyes just meditate on that what a gracious what grace gracia nothing material he does many things for each of us but that he gave us his word and in his word [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we know that that first step is baptism the bible says repent and be baptized [Music] for the remissions of your sins [Music] say lord i want to make that step towards you yes [Music] as the lord moves upon your heart [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hospital [Music] we don't know from one day to the next whether we're going to be here or not [Music] sure lord we come before you father as this petition has been placed before us lord and in your word it says that lord the days of miracles have not passed but lord we know you have a will and a purpose in everyone's life and fathers this petition has made its way here lord as a body of believers and as a minister of this end time i stand with this petition lord i pray that the peace of god would come into the lives of this sister lupita and sister jasmine father whatever you would want to do lord [Music] whatever it would be in your pleasure [Music] [Music] spare her father and heal her body [Music] and lord that maybe these two people father would receive you as well lord i can do nothing but place it into your hands [Music]
