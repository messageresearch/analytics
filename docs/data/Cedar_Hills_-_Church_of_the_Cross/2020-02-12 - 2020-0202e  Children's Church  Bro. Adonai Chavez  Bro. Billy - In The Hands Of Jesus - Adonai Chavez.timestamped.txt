[26:43] old-time religion give me that
[26:47] I'm RELIGIOUS give me that old time
[26:55] it was good and the fiery furnace he was
[27:00] fiery furnace it was good
[27:05] [Music]
[27:10] [Music]
[27:30] how many are excited to be here today
[27:36] we're gonna talk about two rich young
[27:39] ruler z-- that's right
[27:41] brother branham brother branham mentions
[27:45] two rich young ruler z-- so let us read
[27:50] Matthew 19 23 through 24
[28:07] when you have it you can say man then
[28:16] said Jesus unto his disciples fairly I
[28:19] say unto you that a rich man shall Holly
[28:22] entered the kingdom of heaven and again
[28:25] I say unto you it is easier for a camel
[28:29] to go through the eye of the needle for
[28:34] then for a rich man to enter into the
[28:37] kingdom of God you lured me please bow
[28:48] your heads
[28:51] Lord thing thank you for choosing me and
[28:55] not let me talk but let you talk
[29:00] guide your angels around this church -
[29:04] and what and Jesus name Amen
[29:12] you may be seated
[29:15] [Applause]
[29:24] so Jesus tells his disciples twice that
[29:29] it is hard for for rich man to enter the
[29:33] kingdom of heaven Jesus says this after
[29:36] his an encounter with the rich that was
[29:40] the rich young ruler so the rich young
[29:45] ruler is approaching Jesus and he asked
[29:47] and he asked him Jesus how do I obtain
[29:51] eternal life now this rich young ruler
[29:55] he had all the Xbox's and tablets iPads
[30:03] all that stuff sir and so Jesus tells
[30:13] him to sell all his things but the but
[30:18] the rich but this rich young ruler he
[30:22] liked he liked his TVs games and a bunch
[30:25] of other things too much to follow God
[30:32] but there was another rich young ruler
[30:38] anybody might know who that is raise
[30:42] your hand
[30:50] [Applause]
[30:52] Moses Moses Moses was taken in to be the
[31:01] son of Pharaoh's daughter right
[31:07] he lived in Pharaoh's Palace which was
[31:10] way bigger than this way bigger and he
[31:18] was going to be the next Pharaoh fair of
[31:20] all Egypt but it came to the point where
[31:27] he had a decision to make
[31:30] he he he would either follow God or stay
[31:35] here on earth Turner
[31:43] like the rich young ruler and like all
[31:45] of us to turn our Bibles to Hebrews 11
[31:52] 24 through 26
[32:11] when you have it you can't a man by
[32:17] faith Moses when he when he come to
[32:20] years refused to be called the son of
[32:22] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[32:25] suffer affliction with the people
[32:29] it's choosing rather to suffer
[32:34] affliction of the people of God than to
[32:37] enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
[32:39] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[32:43] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[32:47] he had respect unto the unto the
[32:52] recompense of the reward so we see Moses
[33:04] was willing to leave everything behind
[33:07] and follow God but the other young ruler
[33:14] wasn't willing to do so even though he
[33:20] had religious teaching and and he knew
[33:26] he lacked internal life he chose to let
[33:31] his riches lead him rather rather than
[33:34] Jesus eternal life is to choose Jesus
[33:41] and he missed it in life he he he was he
[33:48] was rich but in a rich man but in death
[33:52] he became the beggar as he sat and how
[33:58] he begged the beggar but since Moses
[34:06] chose God the Angels carried him up to
[34:10] heaven where he had internal life we all
[34:15] have a choice to make
[34:17] stay stay with with the world or follow
[34:22] God rich
[34:24] which rich young ruler are you going to
[34:27] be that's kind of short mm-hmm less you

[57:15] that
[57:17] now what told that possum to run out of
[57:22] the woods down the street and running to
[57:25] that gated fence into that certain house
[57:27] oh yeah it sure was God and by that time
[57:33] Billy said hold on a second Who am I
[57:35] talking to

[57:39] and forth to somebody didn't even he
[57:41] click he said Oh Lord is that you you're
[57:46] talking to me
[57:47] he got down on his knees and he said

[58:02] die Billy says Oh Lord forgive me who's
[58:05] a pianist would you call me playing a
[58:08] piano so he knelt down saying Laura

[58:19] little possible you know what happened
[58:23] that possum jump up she got our baby
[58:28] scooped her in the patch and I started

[58:35] that time Rebecca said daddy is that
[58:38] that old possum he said it sure is Jesus
[58:40] just healed
[58:43] [Music]
[58:44] so that that possum it gets to the end
[58:48] of the fence you think creation don't
[58:49] pay attention to you but all creation
[58:53] obeys God when that possums running down
[58:58] the pathway it stops turns back and
[59:01] looks at Billy as if it said thank you
[59:05] kind sir and it went out about its way
[59:09] what am i telling you I'm telling you
[59:14] that you might not think you have a lot
[59:16] because you're young children you might
[59:18] not think you got a lot to offer but put
[59:22] what you got in the hands of Jesus and
