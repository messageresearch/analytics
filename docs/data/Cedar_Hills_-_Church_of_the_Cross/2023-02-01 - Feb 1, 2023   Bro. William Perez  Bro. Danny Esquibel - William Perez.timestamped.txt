[27:33] testimonies
[27:38] we have our sister Charla escabel who
[27:40] will be coming first
[27:42] and then following immediately after we
[27:43] have our brother Nathan Medina
[27:56] um God bless bless you all so
[28:01] um about
[28:02] three months ago
[28:04] October the 25th be exactly
[28:08] how does that work and
[28:13] came in
[28:14] through he was looking very sickly
[28:18] um Gray
[28:21] s
[28:23] so he came in and sat down and I started
[28:26] talking to him
[28:30] um he told me that he had been diagnosed
[28:32] with cancer
[28:33] foreign
[28:36] and he was feeling really sick
[28:40] and he asked me he turned and he asked
[28:43] me can you please pray for me and have
[28:46] your church pray for me
[28:52] so the following day was Wednesday so I
[28:55] put the request up
[28:59] and I believe it was brother Ben that
[29:01] had made the prayer
[29:05] and he was supposed to be online but for
[29:07] whatever reason he wasn't able to be
[29:10] online
[29:16] so we really didn't hear from him
[29:18] anymore after that
[29:20] um
[29:23] I was actually thinking about him during
[29:25] the week-long services if you know I
[29:28] thought maybe he had passed or something
[29:34] well Monday he walked in the door
[29:38] and he had the biggest smile on his face
[29:44] he looked good
[29:46] and he came right up to my chair and he
[29:49] says will you cut my hair
[29:56] um he said well first of all I just want
[29:58] to tell you that I am cancer-free
[30:07] you said that he had um he went to
[30:10] Dallas to see a doctor
[30:14] and they gave him one treatment of a
[30:18] chemo witch
[30:19] he said it was just like uh some kind of
[30:22] beads they put in him
[30:26] and while he was there
[30:28] anyway in Dallas they found a tumor in
[30:32] his pancreas tumor
[30:36] pancreas pancreas
[30:39] and they told him he was he more than
[30:41] likely had pancreatic cancer as well
[30:46] he came home to Cruces and they started
[30:49] doing his blood work to test it
[30:52] is
[30:56] and his white and red blood cells kept
[30:59] getting higher and higher and higher
[31:03] so they said well you know what we're
[31:06] going to send you back to Dallas so they
[31:07] can to check you again
[31:12] and they told him there that he was
[31:15] cancer-free that he had no sign of
[31:16] cancer in his body
[31:20] and he wanted to thank that's him and he
[31:23] just wanted to thank everybody for the
[31:26] prayers
[31:29] and I would like to thank the ministry

[39:12] amen but let's get into the word tonight
[39:17] many are uh how many uh came expecting
[39:21] from the Lord
[39:25] amen so this uh this evening it's um uh
[39:30] it's a it's a thought I I've been having
[39:32] for for a few months
[39:36] and it's called the hiss or the python
[39:41] amen amen we're going to go into the
[39:44] book of Isaiah
[39:46] chapter 47.
[39:48] they start with the 12th verse
[39:53] and it reads like this yes
[39:57] stand now with thine enchantments
[40:01] and with the multitude of thy sorceries
[40:07] wherein thou has labored from the youth
[40:10] less
[40:13] if so be thou shalt be able to profit
[40:20] if so be thou mayest prevail
[40:23] Mental Health
[40:25] Thou Art wearied in the multitude of thy
[40:28] councils
[40:31] let now the astrologers the stargazers
[40:35] the monthly prognosticators stand up
[40:40] foreign
[41:21] thus shall they be unto thee with whom
[41:25] thou has labored
[41:29] even thy Merchants from the youth
[41:33] loss
[41:35] they shall Wonder everyone to his
[41:38] quarter None Shall save
[41:44] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[41:46] reading of the word and you may be
[41:47] seated
[41:51] well you might ask brother what what
[41:54] does that uh what does this verse have
[41:56] to do with uh python
[42:02] we'll get into that in just in just a
[42:05] few minutes
[42:08] but how many have uh have ever gone into
[42:11] the newspaper
[42:12] foreign
[42:20] [Music]
[42:30] what's my
[42:32] Fortune for today
[42:35] and say Well it always gives something
[42:40] pretty vague right
[42:44] thou shall you're you're going to be
[42:47] prosperous uh in in
[42:50] a while
[42:53] what you've been working for is going to
[42:56] come to pass
[42:58] right so we always we're always looking
[43:01] at what what is our fortune
[43:06] and sometimes the way we act this is
[43:10] sometimes uh somebody will say well
[43:12] you're you're this way because you're a
[43:14] Virgo
[43:19] Pisces
[43:21] that's why that's why you have an
[43:24] attitude like that
[43:25] but the Bible talks about something a
[43:28] little bit different
[43:30] he says it says None of these things
[43:33] these are not none of this does course
[43:36] us shall save you yes amen amen so no
[43:40] matter what you do
[43:43] no matter how many horoscopes you look
[43:45] at
[43:48] none of it
[43:52] none of it will save you
[43:56] we have all that in uh
[44:02] so when you go to someone
[44:05] who is uh who may who was talking about
[44:09] maybe reading your fortune
[44:12] they read your future
[44:16] they bring out uh tarot cards
[44:22] and many times we look at that says and
[44:27] as a as a society
[44:29] I remember when I was young and I was a
[44:33] kid
[44:34] anything like that well that I that I
[44:38] even talked about this my mom would be
[44:41] so upset
[44:43] do not bring that witchcraft into my
[44:45] house
[44:49] we see it so it's so prevalent in our in
[44:53] our daily life
[44:57] exactly it's so common now
[44:59] it's infiltrated our Our lives
[45:05] our everyday occurrences
[45:09] and where does it start at it
[45:12] you see cartoons nowadays
[45:16] and it's a bunch of Witchcraft yes
[45:20] but when we see it
[45:23] the way that Society has portrayed it
[45:28] they have portrayed it in a way
[45:33] where witchcraft
[45:36] sorcery
[45:38] they they try and make it look pretty
[45:43] they try and make it look as it's good
[45:49] they try and make it look cute
[45:53] and believe me they have succeeded in
[45:56] doing that
[45:58] because no matter where we turned
[46:02] no matter what we see on TV
[46:05] on social media
[46:09] in in everyday life
[46:12] we see that
[46:15] it doesn't do anything to us
[46:20] we have become so
[46:23] desensitized to it
[46:28] we even say that is harmless
[46:33] we see that so many times in cartoons
[46:36] Disney cartoons we must not question
[46:38] those cartoons the Disney my my children
[46:41] have watched it yes
[46:43] I'm not I'm not uh I'm not uh I'm not
[46:48] saying that nothing has happened in my
[46:49] home like that you know
[46:53] but as you get older and as you as you
[46:56] look at things more and more um
[46:59] [Music]
[47:01] you really find out how slice Satan is
[47:07] he's made what the scripture is telling
[47:09] us that it shall not save you
[47:13] and he's made it as something that is
[47:16] adorable
[47:20] but it wasn't so that I see enough way
[47:23] in the time of Paul De Pablo and Silas
[47:28] amen amen it wasn't so back then
[47:33] we're going to turn into the book of
[47:35] Acts
[47:40] chapter 16.
[47:43] I'm going to start with the verse 16.
[47:51] and it came to pass
[47:53] as we went to prayer
[47:57] there's always it seems like there's
[48:00] always something happening when we're
[48:01] doing something for the Lord right
[48:05] when we're going out clubbing
[48:09] when we're going out doing doing our
[48:12] doing our things
[48:15] it seems like we're having a good time
[48:19] but Paul says as we went to prayer
[48:26] I'm high a certain damsel
[48:29] possessed with a spirit of divinations
[48:40] in control
[48:42] which brought her Masters much gain by
[48:46] sooths saying
[48:51] now if she wasn't good at her profession
[48:58] this would not be a big deal yes
[49:01] would not be a big story
[49:05] but she was excellent in what she did
[49:11] now the word the Divination
[49:16] if you look in the Greek see the best
[49:20] griego you find the word python
[49:25] now if you look at Python
[49:28] and if you're familiar with Greek or
[49:31] Roman mythology
[49:36] and by the way Paul and Silas were in
[49:40] Philippi
[49:42] inglesia
[49:46] so the python was a it was a mythical
[49:50] serpent or dragon
[49:56] and this Dragon it guarded the temple
[50:00] yes
[50:01] in the Oracle of Apollo
[50:06] the Apollo now it was located on the
[50:10] Southern Slope of Mount Parnassus
[50:15] it was to the north of the Gulf of
[50:17] corintho
[50:20] recording the current yes the
[50:22] Corinthians
[50:24] now what's interesting about this
[50:28] if you look at what at uh at who Apollo
[50:31] was so you send me that Apollo as many
[50:34] of you know he he is a Greek god who
[50:36] says
[50:38] but he was the god of poetry
[50:42] he was a god of musica
[50:46] he was the god of healing
[50:49] but he was also a god of
[50:54] prophecya so as you see this young lady
[50:59] she had this Spirit
[51:03] of the Python Del piton all right
[51:09] she had a spirit then he owned Espiritu
[51:12] that if you looked at her she said
[51:15] if you met with her I should say
[51:19] she could tell you the past the future
[51:23] the presence
[51:28] and like I said she was excellent at it
[51:33] when she saw Paul and Silas
[51:37] there was something that caught my
[51:39] attention on this scripture
[51:43] she cried out in verse 17.
[51:47] she didn't cry out
[51:49] oh my gosh these are these are these are
[51:52] men
[51:55] that are not right
[51:59] these are men that are foolish
[52:02] but she cried out
[52:05] that's these men
[52:07] are the Servants
[52:10] of the most high God
[52:14] when a man of God
[52:16] or someone that is filled with the Holy
[52:19] Ghost
[52:21] comes into contact with the spirit like
[52:23] this
[52:26] people this spirit is can't do anything
[52:30] else
[52:32] but declare what the truth
[52:38] isn't in the truth that she was
[52:40] proclaiming
[52:42] she was still in the wrong so yes
[52:46] what she was trying to do
[52:49] is that spirit that was inside of her
[52:53] then through the area spirit that
[52:56] possessed her
[52:57] I did not want to come out
[53:01] it did not want to come out of this
[53:03] woman
[53:04] so what he was trying to do
[53:07] it it was trying to say nice things
[53:12] it was trying to take the attack
[53:20] was that it continued
[53:23] for many days the Bible says
[53:28] finally
[53:30] or Pablo he got tired of it
[53:35] after someone is proclaiming these truly
[53:38] these men are are men of God
[53:43] he even went as far as saying
[53:47] which show us
[53:52] a way of salvation
[53:57] well you say well well how can that be
[54:01] bad
[54:02] I mean what she's speaking is is the
[54:06] truth
[54:07] what she's speaking is right
[54:11] so why should why should she uh why
[54:15] should she be uh called out for this
[54:19] you know many times
[54:22] business the devil El Diablo is full of
[54:25] flatteries the
[54:28] oh there's no word for it
[54:33] labios
[54:34] Lagos he's full of flatteries it's like
[54:37] you know they are Lagos he will tell you
[54:40] it's the nicest things
[54:43] to tell you how great of a Christian you
[54:47] are
[54:48] oh you're doing great
[54:52] look what happened on the on the
[54:54] week-long uh service
[54:57] how the spirit of the Lord fell on you
[55:02] oh wow I'm so proud
[55:21] did you see me jump up and down
[55:25] oh did you hear me say amen
[55:28] amen oh did you hear me do this and that
[55:31] is
[55:32] and what happens
[55:35] we have listened to the hiss of the
[55:39] pieces
[55:46] we have listened to it
[55:49] and where has it brought us
[55:54] it has brought us to a place
[55:59] we don't even know what the difference
[56:02] is
[56:06] of what the message is
[56:09] and what the what the preacher on
[56:12] YouTube is saying YouTube
[56:16] oh it's just as good as the message
[56:19] oh they're they're preaching so well
[56:23] oh and these and these uh these these
[56:26] ministers on YouTube in YouTube
[56:30] my goodness oh yeah
[56:33] can we tell the difference
[56:36] or are we so caught up in just hearing
[56:39] the good things
[56:45] finally Paul got sick and tired
[56:48] because he knew he could tell what type
[56:54] of spirit she had yeah
[56:58] amen amen you know it's something
[57:02] Satan works a lot in in Bright Lights
[57:08] it works a lot like I said in flatteries
[57:11] he works a lot and he wants he wants
[57:13] everything to be a spectacle
[57:15] spectacular
[57:17] but you know how
[57:19] Jesus Cameo Jesus
[57:26] sister uh sister Ruth you know how Jesus
[57:28] came here
[57:31] they come in Bright Lights
[57:34] he didn't come the way that they thought
[57:37] that he was going to come
[57:39] and eat but he came in a very very
[57:42] humble way
[57:45] and here is p here is uh Paul and Silas
[57:52] and this did she many days Verse 18
[57:55] vessels
[57:58] but Paul being grieved must this
[58:03] turned and said to the spirit as they
[58:06] said
[58:10] he he wasn't turning to the the
[58:14] damselves
[58:16] because he knew it wasn't the damn Soul
[58:18] he knew he knew it wasn't the girl
[58:21] but he turned to the spirit
[58:25] that I command thee in the name of Jesus
[58:28] Christ to come out of her
[58:33] and he came out the same hour
[58:38] isn't that amazing
[58:41] but what does it take it takes an ear
[58:47] it takes sight
[58:53] what that Spirit was
[58:56] we get so drawn in
[59:00] by spirits around us
[59:03] at our enticing spirits
[59:09] and when her master saw that the hope of
[59:12] their gains was gone they caught Paul
[59:14] and Silas and Drew them unto the
[59:17] marketplace unto the rulers
[59:30] you see the devil people don't mind it
[59:34] but you do things for the Lord
[59:37] don't mind what you're doing
[59:40] but many times
[59:44] you take any profit from him
[59:48] you take anything from him
[59:50] there's going to be a fight
[59:53] yes anytime
[59:56] there's somebody that's true that is
[59:59] standing up
[1:00:01] what Satan is trying to say
[1:00:05] where Satan has the problem
[1:00:11] and we're gonna go down to uh verse 20
[1:00:15] to almost
[1:00:19] and the multitude rose up together
[1:00:21] against them and the magistrates rent
[1:00:24] off their clothes and commanded to beat
[1:00:27] them
[1:00:28] is
[1:00:37] and when they had laid many stripes upon
[1:00:40] them they cast them into prison charging
[1:00:42] the Jailer to keep them safely
[1:00:51] now I want you to see a difference
[1:00:55] between what this woman or what this
[1:00:59] girl
[1:01:00] was doing establaciendo and what another
[1:01:04] man was about to do is
[1:01:09] who having received such a charge thrust
[1:01:13] them into the inner prison and made
[1:01:15] their feet fast in the stocks in
[1:01:27] El sepo now here's the Jailer
[1:01:30] he has seen everything that had gone on
[1:01:35] seeing what what went down
[1:01:42] I don't even know what they did he said
[1:01:47] really didn't seem anything different to
[1:01:50] me
[1:01:52] and he even put them in in the Deep part
[1:01:56] of the prison
[1:01:58] and he made their feet fast in the stock
[1:02:01] again
[1:02:03] but I want you to notice something
[1:02:06] as bad as it was for Paul and Silas
[1:02:11] they still sing and they praised God
[1:02:15] even when they were in prison
[1:02:18] when they had cast out a demon
[1:02:22] and we're stuck in prison
[1:02:25] they were beaten you
[1:02:40] and suddenly there was a great
[1:02:42] earthquake so that the foundations of
[1:02:44] the prison were shaken and immediately
[1:02:46] all the doors were open and everyone's
[1:02:49] bands were loosed
[1:02:51] remote
[1:03:02] and The Keeper of the prison awakened
[1:03:05] out of his sleep and seeing the prison
[1:03:07] doors open he drew out his sword and
[1:03:10] would have killed himself supposing that
[1:03:12] the prisoners had been
[1:03:14] the prisoners had been fled isos
[1:03:24] so notice something else
[1:03:29] he understood
[1:03:31] that if something happened to these
[1:03:33] prisoners
[1:03:35] was responsible
[1:03:38] but I want you to know on verse 30.
[1:03:42] after all this is happening
[1:03:46] earthquake
[1:03:47] and all these walls falling down
[1:03:51] he wakes up out of his sleep
[1:03:55] first thing he says
[1:04:00] what must I do to be saved
[1:04:06] what must I do to be saved
[1:04:11] what must I do
[1:04:13] to tell the difference
[1:04:22] he said
[1:04:24] believe
[1:04:26] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall
[1:04:29] be saved in thy house
[1:04:34] to me that that is amazing
[1:04:38] because here's a man
[1:04:41] of of Greek
[1:04:44] knowing what could happen
[1:04:47] he's asking at that moment
[1:04:51] what must I do
[1:04:54] to be saved
[1:04:58] that is the question is
[1:05:03] what must I do to be saved
[1:05:08] here's brother Branham
[1:05:11] now notice
[1:05:13] these gifts and callings are without
[1:05:15] repentance
[1:05:20] it's your subconscious in connection
[1:05:23] with God is
[1:05:26] that force shows you things that was and
[1:05:28] will beings
[1:05:32] you get what I mean
[1:05:35] Jesus of Nazareth Jesus if he was here
[1:05:38] on Earth
[1:05:39] he looked over his audiences
[1:05:42] he could see people
[1:05:45] and he'd tell them just what they done
[1:05:50] and what was wrong
[1:05:54] what was wrong with them
[1:05:56] he talked to a woman at the well and
[1:05:59] told her
[1:06:01] he said to Philip he knowed where he had
[1:06:04] been
[1:06:06] many places where a fish was
[1:06:13] foreign
[1:06:55] one thing here in finishing
[1:06:58] terminal we are going to be Zechariah 10

[1:07:37] house of Judah and I will save the house
[1:07:39] of Joseph and I will bring them upon
[1:07:42] bring them again to place them for I
[1:07:44] have mercy upon them and they shall be
[1:07:46] as though I had not cast them off for I
[1:07:49] am the Lord their God and will hear them
[1:08:08] and they of Ephraim shall be like a
[1:08:11] mighty man and their heart shall rejoice

[1:08:54] and gather them
[1:08:57] for I have redeemed them
[1:09:00] and they shall increase as they have
[1:09:04] increased
[1:09:07] so brother and sister
[1:09:10] we know the devil has his hair
[1:09:14] he has his way of dealing with our young
[1:09:18] people
[1:09:19] dealing with us with us people
[1:09:23] he has things he wants to tell us
[1:09:26] oh but if we can notice the difference
[1:09:30] if we can understand
[1:09:33] that God almost Mighty also has a
[1:09:36] history
[1:09:39] and his his is not to divide us is
[1:09:45] to gather us and to redeem us God bless

[1:10:21] said did they call us up already and
[1:10:23] pray for the offering or yeah
[1:10:26] I'm under a lot of great pressure today
[1:10:30] brother Abraham said it better be good
[1:10:35] I'm under a lot of pressure
[1:10:39] and uh
[1:10:40] so today I get the call right
[1:10:45] and
[1:10:46] I was telling my wife the other day
[1:10:49] I was thinking about how
[1:10:51] I had been suffering for about probably
[1:10:53] about 26 years
[1:10:56] [Music]
[1:10:58] and suffering with back conditions
[1:11:03] it wasn't uh you know like you get a
[1:11:06] sore back
[1:11:09] it was uh
[1:11:11] disabling I mean it would put me out
[1:11:14] like exactly what sister Tabitha was
[1:11:16] talking about that that's my testimony
[1:11:21] and so I was thinking the other day I
[1:11:23] said you know God it's been about a year
[1:11:26] since I've had not even one back pain
[1:11:28] yeah
[1:11:33] I mean not even one I'm talking I've
[1:11:37] been I've been good I mean
[1:11:40] and so
[1:11:42] I guess maybe the devil thought he was
[1:11:44] going to do something to me right yes
[1:11:48] so last night I couldn't even I couldn't
[1:11:51] even hardly walk I mean you should see
[1:11:53] me
[1:11:56] I came home from work I was walking like
[1:11:59] this
[1:12:00] I want to sit down
[1:12:05] and so today well last night I ended up
[1:12:08] taking a pain pill uh
[1:12:12] and so
[1:12:14] well my daughter says you better just
[1:12:16] take half of it because you know you're
[1:12:18] not a drug addict though me
[1:12:20] me
[1:12:24] so she said you better take half so then
[1:12:28] so I took half and I felt all right this
[1:12:30] morning
[1:12:32] I was a little sore right so then the
[1:12:35] phone rings
[1:12:37] and I look at my phone and says
[1:12:40] and I had picture there in that night to
[1:12:43] ask him if I could take a whole pill you
[1:12:44] know
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:50] and so
[1:12:52] so I get the call right and I let's see
[1:12:54] and I think Oh Aaron must have told
[1:12:57] Brother Caleb that my back was out oh I
[1:12:59] don't basically
[1:13:01] he's probably calling to check on me you
[1:13:03] know
[1:13:04] see how I'm doing
[1:13:08] and so I say hello hello how you doing
[1:13:11] oh good you yeah
[1:13:13] oh good good yeah yeah you think you got
[1:13:16] one in the chamber for tonight
[1:13:19] all right
[1:13:21] so uh I pulled out my revolver
[1:13:24] foreign
[1:13:41] [Applause]
[1:14:41] foreign
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:55] host there was two I think they were
[1:15:58] pallets right
[1:16:00] Charlotte said it was like uh uh wood
[1:16:03] fence
[1:16:05] [Music]
[1:16:09] and so I I opened my eyes and I I just
[1:16:12] saw this thing in front of us
[1:16:17] and I went
[1:16:19] what
[1:16:22] are you awake
[1:16:25] right did I did I do that sir all right
[1:16:28] and and
[1:16:30] she kind of swear there was two of them
[1:16:32] so she swerved to the right and the
[1:16:34] other one was gonna hit us head-on
[1:16:39] I don't know if I was still like still
[1:16:42] half asleep or what the deal was
[1:16:44] okay but
[1:16:47] that palette or whatever it was in front
[1:16:50] of us but it is
[1:16:53] should have hit the grill head on
[1:16:57] the vehicle and I'm telling you God is
[1:17:00] my witness
[1:17:03] I don't know where that palette went
[1:17:10] it didn't hit the car
[1:17:12] it didn't hit under the car
[1:17:15] they hit over the car I don't know where
[1:17:19] it went no sleep on discipline so I I
[1:17:21] think it just went through the car I'm
[1:17:23] not sure
[1:17:26] but all praise and glory to the Lord
[1:17:29] Jesus
[1:17:31] and so as brother William was talking
[1:17:34] about
[1:17:35] Orlando how Jesus came right Jesus and
[1:17:39] so the Bible says that he came lowly and
[1:17:41] humbly right
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:45] so in Zechariah 9 9 and they don't have
[1:17:48] these scriptures but I just want to
[1:17:49] bring this to your remembrance
[1:17:54] and it says Rejoice greatly o Daughter
[1:17:57] of Zion shout oh daughter of Jerusalem
[1:18:00] Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is
[1:18:03] just and having salvation and lowly and
[1:18:05] riding upon an ass and upon the cult and
[1:18:08] upon a cult the full of an earth
[1:18:13] is
[1:18:23] right and so he came lowly and humbly
[1:18:26] amen you know um
[1:18:28] well all of a sudden well can you
[1:18:30] imagine like I've told you the story
[1:18:32] before
[1:18:35] that uh every Donkey
[1:18:39] from the time that this prophecy was
[1:18:42] made
[1:18:44] like you know you know how women how
[1:18:46] I've told you a story how some ladies
[1:18:48] like it says uh you know
[1:18:52] he's going to choose a lady right so
[1:18:54] every lady starts to prepare herself and
[1:18:56] a virgin shall conceive right
[1:19:21] right and so oh man right right away all
[1:19:24] the donkey started you know buffing
[1:19:26] themselves up
[1:19:30] and they they began to uh prance around
[1:19:34] and they'd go to the horses and the
[1:19:36] stallions
[1:19:41] stallions
[1:19:43] stud whatever you want to call them I
[1:19:45] just
[1:19:49] no okay
[1:19:51] but they would say uh did you hear what
[1:19:55] they said
[1:19:57] that the king is going to come riding on
[1:19:59] a donkey
[1:20:02] right and so every donkey was like
[1:20:05] preparing themselves
[1:20:08] but it wasn't until they don't know so
[1:20:12] there's one donkey he just so happened
[1:20:13] to be thinking himself is this is
[1:20:18] he said I I know that's me oh you're
[1:20:21] sick that's gonna be me
[1:20:24] I'm going to be the one that's going to
[1:20:26] carry the king
[1:20:27] well as he started getting up in age
[1:20:30] he began to think uh well I mean maybe
[1:20:33] it's next year
[1:20:36] right and so they they would put stuff
[1:20:39] on his back
[1:20:41] they would put them loads of wood
[1:20:44] and he would take a step and he'd be oh
[1:20:46] oh
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:57] right and so another day another year
[1:21:00] went by
[1:21:01] and he said
[1:21:03] man I'm wondering if that's gonna be me
[1:21:05] man
[1:21:07] I think it's going to be me
[1:21:09] right and so he they put something on
[1:21:12] him
[1:21:13] and he just couldn't do it he got tired
[1:21:16] right
[1:21:18] but a lot of times we get tired right
[1:21:21] we get tired and on our walk with the
[1:21:23] Lord
[1:21:25] right and so then this donkey yesterday
[1:21:28] the Bible says so this donkey he he
[1:21:32] started the next day is
[1:21:36] he just closed his eyes and he died
[1:21:39] right and he died in shame
[1:21:42] he died telling everybody oh I'm going
[1:21:45] to be the one to carry the king
[1:21:49] but then we find out over in judges
[1:21:52] that one day there was a man that was
[1:21:55] walking around
[1:21:57] and he heard the footsteps of about a
[1:21:59] thousand soldiers
[1:22:05] um
[1:22:11] he went over to a newly fresh dead
[1:22:14] donkey foreign
[1:23:06] I am quick everything's going good right
[1:23:09] but like we heard brother William says
[1:23:13] the devil's very shrewd
[1:23:17] right and so he knows exactly he knows
[1:23:20] you better than you know yourself
[1:23:23] right and so all of a sudden we say oh
[1:23:27] we're gonna go do this
[1:23:29] we're going to go do that but the Bible
[1:23:32] says that we need to exercise ourselves
[1:23:35] into godliness
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:40] right but we forget to do our exercises
[1:23:45] right we we don't forget to do the
[1:23:48] worldly exercises
[1:23:50] or the physical exercise
[1:23:53] right we say oh I'm gonna I'm gonna go
[1:23:55] walk a mile today
[1:23:57] I'm going to start walking every day
[1:24:00] you know like I've always said
[1:24:03] diets just don't work
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:48] but you have to do it with uh you have
[1:24:51] to make a decision
[1:24:53] now we're talking about the day that I
[1:24:55] died
[1:24:58] right and so like we've heard many
[1:25:00] testimonies testimonials
[1:25:03] mainly brother Jerry
[1:25:06] right his testimony is though I used to
[1:25:08] want to go hang out with friends out in
[1:25:10] the world
[1:25:12] and we would do this
[1:25:16] well I didn't I didn't do that my
[1:25:20] friends weren't in the world
[1:25:22] my friends were in church
[1:25:24] and so we did some bad things
[1:25:27] right not to throw anybody under the bus
[1:25:31] but you remember brother Matthew we used
[1:25:33] to do some bad stuff right
[1:25:37] install
[1:25:40] my friends weren't out in the world
[1:25:43] we were in church
[1:25:45] but we thought we were good
[1:25:48] because we came to church
[1:25:51] and then we would look at guys like
[1:25:53] brother Jerry
[1:25:55] he's hanging all the guys down in the
[1:25:57] world
[1:25:58] and here we were inside the church
[1:26:01] right and so
[1:26:04] that's the way it went
[1:26:07] and so you know as a young teenager
[1:26:11] right we I started to make wrong
[1:26:14] decisions
[1:26:15] right and I started going down roads
[1:26:18] probably well not probably but roads
[1:26:21] that I shouldn't have gone down
[1:26:24] right and but one day I remember
[1:26:27] I was 17 years old
[1:26:29] right and I was sitting in the Pew
[1:26:33] and if we were back in Cedar Hills I was
[1:26:35] sitting on this side of the church
[1:26:39] and I didn't I wasn't going to go to
[1:26:41] church that day in fact
[1:26:43] yeah you know because I I got real smart
[1:26:47] because at my house like you didn't tell
[1:26:51] my dad that hey you're not I'm not going
[1:26:53] to church
[1:26:55] right so if anybody knows my dad he
[1:26:58] wasn't the kind that says okay you know
[1:26:59] for you oh
[1:27:04] foreign
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:39] you know not to throw nobody under the
[1:27:41] bus
[1:27:44] oh but Gene's going to come pick me up
[1:27:48] um
[1:27:51] right and so
[1:27:54] sometimes I didn't make it to church
[1:27:57] and then my dad would say were you were
[1:28:01] you at church
[1:28:12] and so I I started so that that one
[1:28:15] Sunday night
[1:28:17] I wasn't going to go to church
[1:28:19] but something compelled me to go
[1:28:23] and it was a youth service
[1:28:27] right and so I had already had my mind
[1:28:30] all made up
[1:28:33] I was going to go to Colorado Rivera
[1:28:36] Colorado and I was going to go ranching
[1:28:38] out in Colorado
[1:28:40] right I had been up to Colorado Springs
[1:28:42] I was like oh man this is this is where
[1:28:44] I want to live right here Colorado
[1:28:46] Springs
[1:28:47] right and so there I was in the corner
[1:28:50] over there
[1:28:51] and it was a youth service
[1:28:54] and uh the speaker for the night
[1:28:57] was the speaker from the morning
[1:29:00] and so we get to use service
[1:29:04] I said okay we're gonna ask brother
[1:29:06] Tommy to come and
[1:29:08] come up to the platform yo okay
[1:29:13] we heard him this morning
[1:29:15] going to be a long service
[1:29:18] right and so there I was in the corner
[1:29:22] and so I remember when he was talking
[1:29:26] right after the service he called up the
[1:29:29] youth to the front this position
[1:29:33] and he called me to come to the front
[1:29:35] image
[1:29:37] and so I came up
[1:29:39] and I was just standing there like
[1:29:42] everybody else you know
[1:29:44] and all of a sudden he came over to me
[1:29:48] and he just like like put his hands on
[1:29:51] me
[1:29:53] well I don't know what happened I I
[1:29:56] can't tell you you know
[1:29:58] but like brother Jacob was giving his
[1:30:00] testimony
[1:30:02] something just started shaking inside of
[1:30:05] me
[1:30:07] well then I I like I just just grabbed
[1:30:10] him
[1:30:11] I just was holding on to him like for
[1:30:14] dear life
[1:30:20] and I don't know what it was but I just
[1:30:22] said save me
[1:30:26] but from that day forward
[1:30:29] I had never been the same
[1:30:33] the world died out it just completely
[1:30:37] died out to me
[1:30:39] and so that was the day that I died
[1:30:43] and so you like I said you know I had
[1:30:45] these big plans
[1:30:47] and so I remember one day I said
[1:30:51] a friend of mine
[1:30:53] he owned a a horse ranch there in Silver
[1:30:57] City
[1:30:58] Rancho in Silver City he was a doctor of
[1:31:01] mine I used to go visit him
[1:31:02] and I was gonna buy a horse from him
[1:31:06] and he says hey look at my facility I
[1:31:08] said what do you he rents out all these
[1:31:10] stalls
[1:31:12] and so I said uh he said you know Danny
[1:31:15] I'll sell this to you
[1:31:20] um he said on our owner financed it for
[1:31:22] you
[1:31:25] and it makes this amount of money
[1:31:28] and uh so you you know you can just take
[1:31:31] it over and I'll help you out
[1:31:34] and so I said oh that sounds good
[1:31:37] and so I remember uh brother Tommy
[1:31:40] happened to come to my house
[1:31:43] and uh he he one day I just came home
[1:31:48] from work and his car was there
[1:31:51] and I said uh I said uh you know we he
[1:31:55] came into the house and we visited
[1:31:59] and so when he was getting ready to
[1:32:01] leave
[1:32:03] I said uh brother Tommy yeah
[1:32:06] I was young I mean I was I just got
[1:32:09] married I must have been what I got
[1:32:10] married at 18 so I must have been like
[1:32:12] 1920 around there the whole engine
[1:32:15] because
[1:32:17] maybe a little older Skype was living in
[1:32:19] Tyrone so nice so anyways I said brother
[1:32:21] tell me there's this guy you know I told
[1:32:23] him the whole story
[1:32:25] and he says uh oh okay yeah let me let
[1:32:28] me let me pray about it and I'll get
[1:32:30] back to you
[1:32:33] and so
[1:32:35] a couple weeks
[1:32:37] he didn't say nothing
[1:32:39] and uh so I thought well I'm gonna go
[1:32:42] and ask him he's been saying I said uh
[1:32:45] so uh brother Tommy had you had any time
[1:32:47] to pray about what I asked you all right
[1:32:52] and he said uh
[1:32:55] he just like looked at me like if I had
[1:32:57] fallen out of a tree
[1:33:00] oh man he forgot what I asked him
[1:33:08] and then he just stay quiet like you
[1:33:10] know that awkward silence yeah
[1:33:20] and so he turns and looks at me
[1:33:24] and he says follow me
[1:33:33] I go to church and
[1:33:36] so he said uh
[1:33:39] why don't you get a passport
[1:33:42] and gold me to Colombia Colombia
[1:33:47] no no no sorry it was to Mexico City
[1:33:49] Mexico
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:56] and I didn't know what I was getting
[1:33:57] myself
[1:34:01] and so I said
[1:34:03] yes I will
[1:34:05] I forgot all about the horse
[1:34:10] right and so I said yeah I'll follow you
[1:34:14] see this eagle and I've never been the
[1:34:17] same
[1:34:19] now have I gotten tired
[1:34:33] be like the eagle that renews its
[1:34:36] strengths
[1:34:38] right because we're living in a time
[1:34:41] where this is Showtime
[1:34:45] this is this is what we've all worked up
[1:34:47] to
[1:34:49] this is what we're this is our our Super
[1:34:51] Bowl it's the initial Super Bowl right
[1:34:54] it's not time to get tired right now
[1:34:56] it's not time to be thinking that we're
[1:34:58] going to be leaving church
[1:35:01] it's time to be thinking that we have a
[1:35:03] better idea
[1:35:06] this is Showtime
[1:35:08] because the Bible says
[1:35:15] I saw the Lord high and lift it up
[1:35:20] it was the year
[1:36:19] if he's flying at us
[1:36:57] and fight
[1:37:55] this joke
[1:37:56] they say tell us this joke
[1:37:59] that man died
[1:38:04] don't be trying to resurrect me
[1:38:07] right let's just go on
[1:38:10] fight forward
[1:38:12] let's love one another
[1:38:16] one another
[1:38:20] it's time to unite ourselves
[1:38:35] I want to read to you
[1:38:39] two quotes here
[1:38:41] now brother Brown was reading out of the
[1:38:43] book of Exodus
[1:38:46] and he said now so now the book of
[1:38:49] Exodus is one of my favorite books
[1:38:53] of the Old Testament the very word
[1:38:56] accident this means the called out
[1:39:01] in other words it means the church
[1:39:03] itself
[1:39:05] they were called out the people of God
[1:39:07] while they were down in Egypt
[1:39:10] so they were called the people of God
[1:39:12] how many people of God
[1:39:15] right they were called out they were
[1:39:17] called the people of God down in Egypt
[1:39:20] and then when they were called out
[1:39:23] they were then the Church of God foreign
[1:39:54] there's only one Church
[1:39:57] and that's the Church of those who are
[1:40:00] born again
[1:40:02] and that's the only church yes
[1:40:05] you're you're never joining God's Church
[1:40:09] there's no way of doing it at all
[1:40:11] and you're born in God's Church
[1:40:15] Jesus says except a man be born again
[1:40:20] he cannot understand the Kingdom of
[1:40:22] Heaven
[1:40:23] there's no way of understanding until
[1:40:25] you've been born again
[1:40:28] and then God reveals himself to you
[1:40:34] and then you know that you've passed
[1:40:36] from Death onto life
[1:40:39] because no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:40:44] Jesus Christ only by the Holy Spirit
[1:40:48] the only way that you'll ever know that
[1:40:50] Jesus is the Christ
[1:40:53] Jesus Christ is when the Holy Spirit
[1:40:58] personally witnesses to you personally
[1:41:00] test difficult state that he is the
[1:41:03] resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:41:05] no matter what he would do
[1:41:08] what kind of signs
[1:41:11] what kind of Miracles
[1:41:13] you'll never know it until your personal
[1:41:16] experience with God
[1:41:20] you say well I believe it you look real
[1:41:23] because the Bible says
[1:41:25] well that's good is the Bible is true
[1:41:31] well the preacher said so
[1:41:35] perhaps he knows
[1:41:41] but what do you know about it
[1:41:44] you'll never know it until it's revealed
[1:41:46] to you
[1:41:49] individually by the Holy Spirit
[1:41:51] individuals
[1:41:53] and then by accepting it
[1:41:56] you become a new creature and Christ
[1:41:59] Jesus Christ
[1:42:01] Jesus born the second time now
[1:42:05] you can't live
[1:42:08] and twice
[1:42:11] you have to die once in order to be born
[1:42:15] again
[1:42:17] so when you die out to yourself
[1:42:20] when you are born the new of the Holy
[1:42:22] Spirit you say is
[1:42:25] there's no reasoning the word of God
[1:42:29] you just take it for what it says
[1:42:35] that proves it so the last scripture as
[1:42:40] we've been taught
[1:42:41] that we need to include ourselves in the
[1:42:44] scripture right
[1:42:47] so I'll leave you with second
[1:42:49] Corinthians 5 17.
[1:42:54] therefore if Danny be in Christ
[1:42:58] let's repeat it so you just say your
[1:43:01] name therefore
[1:43:05] he is a new creature
[1:43:09] all things are passed away
[1:43:12] behold all things are become new amen
[1:43:17] God bless you tonight
[1:43:20] [Applause]
