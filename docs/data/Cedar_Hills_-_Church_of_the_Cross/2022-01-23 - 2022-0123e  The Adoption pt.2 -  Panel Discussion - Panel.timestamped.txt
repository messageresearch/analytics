[13:04] of adoption amen god bless you
[13:13] let me before we go any further go back
[13:16] genesis 1 26 i'll pick it up
[13:18] wednesday when god made man before he
[13:22] made man he called himself
[13:24] l e l l e l h l l elohim
[13:30] the word means in the hebrew the
[13:33] self-existence
[13:37] all by himself
[13:40] nothing existed before him he was all
[13:42] the existence he ever was
[13:45] self-existence was
[13:57] mighty
[13:59] self-existence
[14:04] but in genesis 2 when he made man he
[14:07] said i am
[14:10] y a h u j u b u h
[14:14] yahuwah jehovah
[14:17] what did it mean i am the all existence
[14:21] one who has created something all for
[14:24] myself to be a son of mine are a
[14:28] temporary are an amateur little one of
[14:31] mine
[14:37] why
[14:38] he gave man
[14:41] jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[14:44] amateur god
[14:47] because he is father god
[14:50] and he made a man an amateur god so he
[14:52] isn't self existence anymore he exists
[14:55] with his family
[15:02] [Music]
[15:04] now
[15:05] now he is jehovah
[15:08] jehovah meaning the one who exists with
[15:11] his family
[15:13] now god made man to be
[15:16] the predominant over all the earth he
[15:19] had dominion
[15:21] and the earth was man's dominion is that
[15:24] scripture
[15:26] then if that's his domain he was god
[15:28] over the earth
[15:31] he could speak and it would be so he
[15:33] could speak this and he would be so
[15:38] there he is god jehovah
[15:42] the one who once existed
[15:45] in self-existence but now exists with
[15:48] his family and his little ones with him
[15:52] amen there you are hallelujah
[15:56] all right brother neville you got first
[15:58] peter
[15:59] 120
[16:00] but read 119 and 120. but with the
[16:04] precious blood of christ as of a lamb
[16:07] without blemish and without spot
[16:10] who verily was foreign before the
[16:13] foundation of the world
[16:16] but was manifest in these last times for
[16:19] you
[16:20] when was he for ordained
[16:24] before the foundation of the world
[16:27] brother pat read revelation 17 8 for me
[16:32] this the thou son was
[16:36] [Music]
[16:41] they that dwell on the earth shall
[16:43] wonder
[16:44] whose names were not written in the book
[16:47] of life from the foundation
[16:55] who's going to be deceived
[16:57] who's going to be received by this
[16:59] religious person like saul was
[17:03] that was just so cunning and so perfect
[17:06] to it would deceive the white very e
[17:10] if
[17:12] if possible
[17:13] all right revelations 13 8 let me read
[17:16] it for you
[17:17] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[17:20] all
[17:21] that dwell upon the earth
[17:23] shall worship him
[17:25] whose names were not written in the book
[17:28] of life of the lamb's slaying before the
[17:32] foundation of the world
[17:35] when was our names put in the lamb's
[17:37] book of life
[17:38] when the lamb was slain before the
[17:40] foundation of the world when god was
[17:43] jehovah el
[17:45] ely elohim
[17:47] the self-existence one
[17:49] just like one great big diamond
[17:52] and he could not be nothing else but
[17:54] inside of this diamond
[17:57] his attributes was a savior
[18:01] amen in this attributes on the inside of
[18:04] him was a healer
[18:08] well there was nothing to save and
[18:09] nothing to heal
[18:12] but his attributes produced it
[18:16] election looks back to foreknowledge
[18:19] and predestination looks the destiny
[18:23] don't forget that
[18:25] that election
[18:27] looks back here here it is but all of a
[18:29] sudden i become a wheat grain
[18:33] how did it happen
[18:34] uh that what is that election
[18:37] god before the foundation of the world
[18:40] elected that the cocker bird was to
[18:42] become a reign of wheat now i know i'm a
[18:45] grain of wheat because i'm saved how do
[18:47] i do it now let's read just a little
[18:50] farther
[18:51] and then we'll have to close pretty
[18:52] sharp
[18:54] according as he chose us and him before
[18:57] the foundation of the world that we
[18:59] should be holy without blame before him
[19:01] in love
[19:02] having
[19:03] [Music]
[19:06] predestinated us
[19:09] unto the adoption
[19:12] predestinated unto the adoption of
[19:14] children by jesus christ to himself
[19:18] according to the good pleasure of his
[19:21] will
[19:22] what did he do he by ford knowledge
[19:27] foresaw us
[19:30] knowing that he was a savior
[19:34] self-existence
[19:36] but in him was
[19:40] a savior
[19:42] amen well what's he going to say there's
[19:44] nothing lost
[19:47] knowing that
[19:48] that he know that this great attribute
[19:51] in him would project something out on
[19:53] her
[19:54] that he could save
[19:56] then when he did that by four knowledge
[19:59] he looked down he saw everyone that
[20:02] would accept it
[20:05] and while he did that he did that that
[20:08] he
[20:09] might save you who wants to be saved
[20:16] do you see what i mean
[20:18] by
[20:19] for knowledge amen the infinite god who
[20:23] wrote all things
[20:24] saw the lamb
[20:26] and he slayed the land before the
[20:29] foundation of the world and he put your
[20:31] name on the lamb's book of life and he's
[20:34] seen the deceitfulness of satan what he
[20:36] would do so he put your name on there by
[20:39] election he chose them and by
[20:42] predestination they know where they are
[20:45] go in
[20:46] amen
[20:49] now who could doubt that that's what
[20:51] paul said
[20:53] that's paul's
[20:55] scripture
[20:56] that's paul's writing
[20:58] that's what he taught his church
[21:01] the church
[21:02] positioned
[21:03] before the foundation of the world
[21:06] when god and his labor pain
[21:09] was bringing forth
[21:11] bringing forth you knowing what you
[21:13] would do
[21:14] he positionally placed you into his own
[21:18] body
[21:19] amen
[21:20] to be a housewife
[21:23] to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a
[21:26] prophet to beat this or to be that and
[21:29] then on next sunday morning we're going
[21:32] into the physician league placing the
[21:35] church
[21:37] positionally placing the church where
[21:41] they belong
[21:43] each one
[21:44] how we're called by the adoption
[21:47] god has adopted us unto the sons we're
[21:51] sons by birth adopted and positionally
[21:54] placed by the holy spirit
[21:58] [Applause]
[22:09] good evening
[22:10] everybody what a what a time we had this
[22:13] morning
[22:17] and uh grateful to be again here in the
[22:20] house of the lord
[22:23] and uh we could we could we could just
[22:25] about just after that just go home
[22:29] but we got a job to do tonight
[22:34] and we're grateful
[22:35] to the lord for what he's done for us
[22:41] this is that we are going into tonight
[22:47] the whole series is called the adoption
[22:50] the series
[22:52] and this is uh part two
[22:55] of
[22:56] the adoption the adoption if you would
[22:59] ever look it up in the old books it
[23:01] would be the manifestation of the sons
[23:02] of god
[23:06] manifestation
[23:08] but in the new in the new books is they
[23:10] just call it the adoption part 2.
[23:17] we're grateful to to the lord that he
[23:19] has given us what he
[23:31] in the book of joshua the first chapter
[23:33] of josue
[23:36] [Music]
[23:40] we will be
[23:44] and i i just want to go really quick
[23:46] into that
[23:49] as the first part was the ephesians
[23:51] parallels joshua
[23:55] josue let's take the book of joshua
[23:59] after the death of moses the servant of
[24:01] the lord
[24:02] it came to pass that the lord spake unto
[24:04] joshua the son of nun
[24:06] moses is minister saying
[24:15] moses my servant is dead
[24:18] now therefore arise go over this jordan
[24:22] thou and all this people unto the land
[24:24] which i do give them
[24:26] even to the children of israel
[24:29] our
[24:38] your foot shall tread upon that have i
[24:40] given unto you as i said unto moses
[24:59] and he says preaching usually
[25:01] catches the sinner
[25:06] brings him under condemnation by the
[25:08] word
[25:11] but teaching places the man positionally
[25:14] what he is
[25:21] and we can never rightly be able to have
[25:23] faith no podemos correctamente nerfe
[25:26] until
[25:40] [Music]
[25:55] in the dispensation of the adoption of
[25:57] children
[26:00] and you that are writing this down
[26:04] the word dispensation
[26:07] is a period of time in history
[26:11] in which a particular divine revelation
[26:16] has predominated in the affairs of
[26:18] mankind
[26:23] so then right away we we will go into
[26:25] into just that opening
[26:27] that openly opening uh declaration
[26:34] so there is then no outpouring of the
[26:36] holy ghost
[26:40] since we live in a different
[26:42] dispensation
[26:45] because it's very important to
[26:47] understand when we're saved
[26:51] and this bible study this this panel is
[26:54] not is not so much to discuss even
[26:56] though it goes all together yes
[27:02] it's not too it's we're not speaking
[27:04] about being saved
[27:08] or being filled with the holy ghost
[27:12] or being a son of god
[27:14] what we're doing what we're dealing with
[27:17] tonight
[27:33] to be positionally placed in the body of
[27:35] jesus christ
[27:39] so then we are living in the
[27:41] dispensation
[27:46] notice
[28:01] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[28:03] of times he might gather together in one
[28:07] all things in christ both which are in
[28:09] heaven and that's what you're on earth
[28:12] even in him
[28:22] and each one of these dispensations that
[28:24] my brother just mentioned
[28:27] hermano the mosaic
[28:30] [Music]
[28:40] the dispensation of grace
[28:57] in crystal but in the
[29:00] dispensation of adoption in the
[29:02] dispensation
[29:03] he is taking all of that that was was
[29:06] poured throughout all those times
[29:44] so but in order to get the value of what
[29:47] we're doing
[29:51] in the dispensation of adoption now in
[29:53] the dispensation
[29:55] as it all comes together
[29:58] junto
[29:59] it's
[30:00] the spirit of god being poured into one
[30:02] vessel
[30:21] persimismo thank you brother jim
[30:24] brother jerry you have something to tell
[30:26] me gary amen
[30:29] amen god bless you
[30:30] jesus
[30:31] yeah
[30:32] this is kind of new to me because
[30:49] and i didn't get very far until
[30:51] something caught my attention
[30:55] and if i
[30:56] i'll read a scripture and it's in
[30:58] ephesians one
[31:01] when you have it you can say amen
[31:07] it says paul an apostle of jesus christ
[31:12] by the will of god
[31:17] to the saints which are at ephesus
[31:22] and to the faithful
[31:23] in christ jesus
[31:26] and christo jesus and and that caught me
[31:29] right there faithful in christ jesus
[31:31] christ
[31:34] and christo jesus because if you look at
[31:35] the word in right there the way it's
[31:37] used
[31:42] it means position
[31:43] significa
[31:58] but also when you go in there you're
[32:00] also in your position
[32:04] so that that caught my my attention
[32:06] there because it says faithful in christ
[32:09] jesus
[32:12] jesus and who is he speaking to there
[32:14] lando do you find yourself there
[32:18] because he's not speaking to the outside
[32:20] world right there
[32:24] he's speaking to the church
[32:26] if you're in christ jesus christ
[32:29] jesus then you're part of the church
[32:32] then you're in your position
[32:36] but then it also goes in if you read
[32:38] verse two in verse
[32:40] it says grace be unto grace be to you
[32:43] and peace from god our father and from
[32:46] the lord jesus christ
[32:52] and he said bless bless be the god and
[32:54] father of our lord jesus christ
[32:57] who had blessed us with all spiritual
[32:59] blessings
[33:00] in heavenly places
[33:03] in christian
[33:12] so so the question maybe some of you
[33:14] might have is how do we get in christ
[33:19] well if you read it in second
[33:21] corinthians 12 second
[33:34] first corinthians 12 and
[33:36] verse 13
[33:39] for by two spirits now
[33:43] for
[33:44] by my spirit for me no it says for by
[33:48] one spirit
[33:49] of the spirit
[33:52] again how many spirits church
[33:55] are some of us baptized
[33:59] by one spirit are we all
[34:03] how many how many belong to the all
[34:05] right
[34:07] it didn't it didn't exclude anybody it
[34:09] says all.
[34:13] says it could be methodist presbyterians
[34:15] it means all by one spirit
[34:32] or gentiles
[34:34] whether we be bond or free escalators
[34:38] and
[34:39] have all
[34:40] and have been all made to drink into one
[34:43] spirit
[34:47] so how are we how do we get into christ
[34:50] we are baptized by one spirit
[34:54] so again here as it says
[34:57] blessings in heavenly places again it
[35:00] means position
[35:03] significant position yes
[35:06] what
[35:08] is that position
[35:11] who does that position pertain to
[35:14] esta position i believe
[35:19] if it's i believe it would be me
[35:21] positioned by the holy ghost
[35:24] the position of the believer of the
[35:26] believer
[35:30] so
[35:32] so as we look at here
[35:35] but but but once we're in christ
[35:38] and cristo it's not a revolving door no
[35:42] una puerto i believe you can't you can't
[35:45] decide one day you're in christ and the
[35:46] next day you're going to be out
[35:50] if you're going to be in christ you got
[35:52] to be in fully
[35:55] you got to give your whole heart to
[35:56] christ
[35:59] we we we can't walk with with with one
[36:02] foot in one foot out nope
[36:06] we got to be we got to be right now
[36:10] because what does the scripture
[36:24] so if you're going to be in christ then
[36:26] you got to be all in
[36:27] christ
[36:32] but you got to be all-in
[36:36] you can't decide one day i'm going to be
[36:37] in christ so one day i'm going to be out
[36:39] nope
[36:42] because once you're in christ
[36:45] and you found your position in control
[36:48] in heavenly places
[36:51] then
[36:52] all the promises
[36:55] pertaining to you and i le partners
[36:58] like the things that you you you can
[37:00] have your healing
[37:03] every single promise is yours
[37:06] your children are yours
[37:10] every blessing is yours
[37:12] but you gotta find your position
[37:16] in christ
[37:18] not in a church no no no iglesia because
[37:21] because when we get baptized
[37:23] cedar hills church of the cross doesn't
[37:25] baptize you
[37:27] cedar hills uh church of the cross not
[37:29] about yes you get baptized by the church
[37:32] in by a minister it is
[37:36] but you're baptized by one spirit
[37:40] by one holy spirit
[37:43] and that
[37:43] places you positionally yes
[37:48] brother
[37:48] says
[37:50] paul an apostle by the will of god
[37:53] pablo apostles
[37:56] says not his will
[37:59] to the saints which have been faithful
[38:01] hello
[38:04] and what are they faithful in
[38:05] question
[38:07] brother branham says they're faithful in
[38:08] the word
[38:09] [Music]
[38:11] blessed us in heavenly places
[38:15] what is heavenly places question here it
[38:18] is brother jimmy
[38:19] it is a believer's position
[38:21] in christ
[38:25] and when you have climbed that ladder
[38:29] it'll quicken your mortal body
[38:41] you won't say the things you used to
[38:43] say amen
[39:26] we always say this in a ministerial
[39:28] meeting
[39:31] back to what brother brother jerry just
[39:33] got through saying okay
[39:35] you cannot teach faithful how to be
[39:37] faithful
[39:40] and teach
[39:45] faithful faithfulness is something that
[39:47] is a quality that that that that is not
[39:51] thought
[39:53] of
[39:55] and can you be faithful yes you can be a
[39:57] faithful to a certain cause
[40:01] but when you're faithful to god
[40:05] there are some there's a reason why
[40:07] you're faithful
[40:34] when they sing the plan of salvation
[40:38] that's what keeps you in faithful that's
[40:40] what keeps you coming back to church
[40:46] putting your name on the book
[41:05] when he
[41:06] thought of christ dying for you when
[41:08] pence
[41:11] he counted your name with his contoso
[41:14] he associated your name with his
[41:17] associates
[41:25] he didn't write it in his book because
[41:26] we no no our name was written in the
[41:28] book before it was written he spoke our
[41:32] name
[41:36] somebody got to tell your neighbor god
[41:38] spoke my name tell your neighbor
[41:42] oh somebody tell you tell your neighbor
[41:44] shout it to them
[41:46] that's what we did in the beginning when
[41:48] the sons of god shouted for joy you see
[41:51] the plan of salvation you see him wrote
[41:53] your name on the book
[42:00] okay brother
[42:02] calm me down
[42:08] god bless you brothers
[42:15] said it's also my my first time
[42:19] not my style but
[42:23] i like to be running
[42:51] something i'd like to add
[43:08] [Music]
[43:22] the sin of the world
[43:38] whether you want to live there that's a
[43:39] different story
[43:47] or something i i meditate a lot
[43:55] and i was asking myself god said let us
[43:58] make man
[44:00] to our image
[44:02] [Music]
[44:03] according to our likeness
[44:10] where does it say whether god did it
[44:14] for that he was ready already ready
[44:22] to understand a little bit better i read
[44:24] the message
[44:28] and the prophet of god says here is the
[44:30] true manager
[45:16] oh
[45:30] so seeing the whole process
[45:34] the prophet of god says
[45:37] god knowing
[45:39] that you would be a drunk
[46:11] this morning we heard about wisdom
[46:15] knowledge
[46:23] but here the word says or knowledge
[46:49] [Music]
[46:53] no one will interfere there
[47:24] the holy spirit is the promise
[47:28] it is the promised land
[47:30] when you enter there
[47:34] into that promised land
[47:40] the prophet says the first thing the
[47:41] holy spirit does
[47:45] he places the church in order
[47:50] he says he corrects her
[47:55] so the first thing that we need entering
[48:00] it is to be corrected
[48:18] they don't like me
[48:22] but if you read the message
[48:26] the prophet of god teaches us
[48:28] that love
[48:31] is correct
[48:45] uh
[48:59] how many of you read that
[49:02] you know
[49:05] one of the things the prophet says
[49:09] the first thing that god does
[49:13] he places an apostle
[49:42] foreign
[49:56] when we see him when we appoint one
[49:59] person
[50:02] and we don't appoint him according to
[50:04] the scripture
[50:07] that's where we're gonna miss it
[50:10] the scripture says he himself
[50:14] has hath placed
[50:18] he wasn't placed by any other person but
[50:20] he himself
[50:24] to enter into the promised land
[50:28] you need to be corrected
[50:31] established
[50:37] we'll go to a scripture
[51:06] dclc
[51:47] of god
[52:05] they have heard the father how many have
[52:07] heard of the father
[52:08] juan
[52:09] when
[52:11] he's the aunties before
[52:15] the foundation of the world
[52:30] and
[52:58] romans chapter 1 verse 21
[53:10] is
[53:31] they glorified him not as god neither
[53:33] were thankful but became vain in their
[53:35] imaginations
[53:41] the scripture tells us everything came
[53:43] out of him
[53:45] whether the good
[53:47] and the bad
[53:49] okay
[53:50] but one the the bad part belonged to him
[54:40] the reason they can take possession of
[54:42] that land
[54:44] because it belongs to them
[54:47] yes
[54:48] god bless you brother
[54:59] [Music]
[55:18] not sure how it says it in english
[55:26] we know it was wisdom and knowledge
[55:32] in spanish at least
[55:36] you shall be like god
[55:41] good and evil
[55:44] because they knew good luck
[56:06] [Music]
[56:10] amen amen
[56:17] for as much as you know that you were
[56:19] not redeemed with corruptible things as
[56:21] silver
[56:26] and gold
[56:28] from your vain conversation jesus
[56:30] conversations
[56:32] receive by tradition from your father
[56:36] but with the precious blood of christ
[56:42] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[56:45] spot como un corderos in mancha who
[56:47] verily was for ordained before the
[56:50] foundation of the world
[56:55] but was manifest in these last times
[56:57] where are you manifest
[56:59] right all right
[57:01] brother jerry
[57:02] right brother jerry god bless you
[57:04] tonight god bless you um
[57:06] so this um the subject of adoption
[57:10] tremendous i know my brother jimmy likes
[57:12] it now
[57:16] because it is uh it's showing us who we
[57:18] are where we are
[57:21] you know positionally placing of sons
[57:24] positions
[57:30] [Music]
[57:39] it speaks on
[57:40] [Music]
[57:42] having pre-destinated us in the adoption
[57:44] of children by jesus christ
[57:48] according to the good pleasure of his
[57:50] will
[57:53] but look at verse 6 and lots of
[57:54] paraphrase so i don't read so much
[57:59] the next one it says
[58:00] to praise to the praise of the glory of
[58:03] his grace
[58:04] [Music]
[58:06] wherein he has made us accepted
[58:10] so i see the way brother branham the way
[58:12] he explains adoption here in part two
[58:15] [Music]
[58:18] we know what the scripture says
[58:20] obviously an adoption of sons
[58:24] but the way he uses it
[58:27] like we've been hearing is positionally
[58:29] placing of the believer
[58:33] [Music]
[58:36] so right away i went like i said i like
[58:37] to define words to help me understand it
[58:40] better
[58:44] so so look at some of the definitions
[58:46] okay
[58:51] [Music]
[58:59] [Music]
[59:04] or to use something
[59:06] the third one says to accept formally
[59:08] and put into effect
[59:10] [Music]
[59:13] this is it's a change in a result of an
[59:16] action essentially
[59:31] this is to take up and practice or use
[59:33] essentials
[59:36] to take or accept formally and put into
[59:38] effect
[59:44] and then i also saw some of the synonyms
[59:48] and what that means is words that are
[59:50] very similar to the to the word being
[59:52] defined
[59:57] and just to name some of them it's an
[59:58] endorsement
[1:00:02] and this is another message
[1:00:08] it's a promotion
[1:00:09] it's a validation
[1:00:11] it's choosing and a choice
[1:00:16] it's election
[1:00:18] it's a selection
[1:00:20] it's a nomination
[1:00:22] and it's an acceptance yes
[1:00:25] so in ephesians 1 6 we saw about being
[1:00:28] accepted
[1:00:31] so we read we heard in part one where it
[1:00:33] says ephesians parallels joshua
[1:00:38] just a little bit of like i said just
[1:00:40] so i can get my point across here
[1:00:43] so we know that he parallels that
[1:00:45] because he joshua plays he divided the
[1:00:47] land
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:52] i began to look at ephesians now empire
[1:01:20] he gave some apostles prophets teachers
[1:01:22] evangelists and pastors
[1:01:30] so we see that this is a formula like we
[1:01:32] heard this morning
[1:01:35] the formula of creation
[1:01:38] so the only way the perfection can come
[1:01:41] from to the saints
[1:01:47] perfection and the edification of the
[1:01:49] spirit
[1:01:52] the way it comes and brings it
[1:01:54] positionally placed together brother
[1:01:55] jimmy
[1:01:59] the infilling because we know it's the
[1:02:00] holy ghost it's god in all things
[1:02:04] remember
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:16] because it is
[1:02:17] because god has your the only hands you
[1:02:19] could use is your hand
[1:02:23] is your hands in my hands
[1:02:26] so without that or seen
[1:02:29] they said there's there's no the
[1:02:31] adoption cannot come and i'll explain
[1:02:32] more
[1:02:40] so how do we know that we're sons and
[1:02:42] daughters of god how do we become
[1:02:44] and bring this manifestation out come on
[1:02:58] there's no way we can do any type of
[1:02:59] justice in 10 minutes
[1:03:40] and no doubt what great theologians have
[1:03:42] struck
[1:04:11] that knows who he is
[1:04:13] has adopted this process
[1:04:16] that has adopted the formula
[1:04:19] so in other words has adopted what we
[1:04:20] heard this morning
[1:04:24] that we adopted
[1:04:39] and does this process here
[1:04:42] here's the formula
[1:04:43] formula he can bear with the man when
[1:04:45] he's wrong
[1:04:48] he lost suffers
[1:04:51] again let's start over
[1:05:19] and an attribute is not separate from
[1:05:21] the person
[1:05:27] so he's faithful
[1:05:29] he's filled with the spirit
[1:05:32] he's never negative
[1:05:34] negative
[1:05:48] the process
[1:06:48] [Applause]
[1:06:59] the fruit of the tree
[1:07:02] is it seen on the inside of the tree or
[1:07:05] the outside of the tree
[1:07:08] enlighten me
[1:07:09] okay so so we're sons of god
[1:07:12] jose dios
[1:08:35] he's already seen all this video
[1:09:04] where the sons of god were to be
[1:09:06] manifested outside of this time
[1:09:10] they couldn't be manifested any other
[1:09:12] time
[1:09:14] outside of this time
[1:09:15] is that true
[1:09:16] yeah why
[1:10:00] until
[1:10:14] those that would deliver all nature
[1:10:24] this time
[1:10:26] you couldn't have delivered on
[1:10:27] everything and the other time
[1:10:45] and then he says this statement i'm
[1:10:47] quoting i'm quoting the old adoption
[1:10:49] book
[1:10:53] yeah it's pretty messed up
[1:10:59] [Applause]
[1:11:05] he says
[1:11:07] the ministry of
[1:11:09] these
[1:11:10] plural man
[1:11:12] singular
[1:11:13] el ministerio de estos plural hombre
[1:11:17] singular
[1:11:19] so close like his tan circus como
[1:11:24] el singular singular
[1:11:28] that it will unite him and the church
[1:11:32] together plural um
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:50] the ministry of these man and a and
[1:11:54] singular in the version
[1:11:58] they just changed
[1:12:02] because they can see in the context
[1:12:04] there has to be a plurality context
[1:12:11] is that the ministry must be like one
[1:12:15] man a ministerio tiene
[1:12:18] [Applause]
[1:12:33] even unto the great river al grand rio
[1:12:36] the river euphrates
[1:12:39] all the land of the hittites
[1:12:43] and to the great sea
[1:12:46] to toward the going down of the sun
[1:12:52] shall be your host
[1:12:56] there shall not be any man
[1:13:00] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:13:04] of your life
[1:13:08] as i was with moses
[1:13:12] so i will be with thee
[1:13:15] i will not fail thee
[1:13:19] i will not forsake thee
[1:13:22] be strong and of good courage yes
[1:13:27] foreign
[1:13:57] you might just be the
[1:14:14] that's what the adoption of god and
[1:14:16] children come to give us
[1:14:19] jesus christ never gave us our
[1:14:21] inheritance
[1:14:25] to receive the inheritance of god
[1:14:30] just before the foundation of the world
[1:14:37] what we don't understand at times
[1:14:54] have a i don't wouldn't know what it is
[1:14:56] to fly an airplane
[1:15:00] that's brother henry
[1:15:02] brother henry could tell you hey henry i
[1:15:04] would be a fool to tell a doctor or a
[1:15:07] pilot what to do
[1:15:48] where he tells you your
[1:15:50] position and the adoption of child of
[1:15:54] son in that own adoption
[1:15:56] but this is where christianity failed
[1:16:00] because we think that adoption is the
[1:16:03] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:28] it is a public ceremony
[1:16:32] it is
[1:16:46] is
[1:16:48] you are the most privileged people on
[1:16:50] the face of the world
[1:16:53] don't ever give up your crown
[1:16:56] don't ever give up
[1:16:58] where you're at
[1:16:59] because adoption is not an old testament
[1:17:03] word
[1:17:11] this is the new covenant
[1:17:13] this is the new testament in my blood
[1:17:17] and me the adoption of children
[1:17:20] in my mind
[1:17:23] when god said
[1:17:27] this was my son yesterday
[1:17:43] it's simple it's simple
[1:17:46] he's saying you know what he said 7k
[1:17:49] my boy is so much like me me me
[1:17:51] muchachos
[1:17:54] i have no doubt no tengo ningunaduda
[1:18:00] that not even one word that comes out of
[1:18:02] his mouth
[1:18:05] will be from another god
[1:18:10] brother jimmy you're telling me that the
[1:18:11] sun's signature was as good as the
[1:18:13] father absolutely
[1:18:15] yes
[1:18:19] jimmy so you're telling me it's amazing
[1:18:21] no that the son's signature was as good
[1:18:23] as the father's signature absolutely
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:52] watch this
[1:18:54] adoption part two paragraph 132.
[1:19:00] oh papa got sitting back there in the
[1:19:02] beginning
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:58] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:04] so they want to beat us all up kill us
[1:20:07] we have to resurrect 20 times
[1:20:13] playing with him before the foundation
[1:20:30] jesus
[1:20:39] god
[1:20:46] all right
[1:20:47] well you this is not to conclude because
[1:20:50] you can't conclude
[1:20:53] it would be
[1:20:56] it would be forever to
[1:20:57] try to do justice
[1:21:02] but we have a question from the audience
[1:21:06] and it says this when brother branham
[1:21:08] refers to joseph dismissing his bride
[1:21:10] and his children is
[1:21:28] and
[1:21:29] the the the the simple
[1:21:32] answer
[1:21:33] even though it's it's a profound
[1:21:35] response it's found in paragraph 74.
[1:21:39] i'm sorry 70 72
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:08] and joseph brings in ifrian and manassa
[1:22:11] entrance
[1:22:13] joseph brings him to his father jose
[1:22:17] and the custom is to give the blessing
[1:22:18] to the elder la costumbres
[1:22:22] which
[1:22:31] so he goes to bless them here's my
[1:22:33] here's manasseh

[1:23:02] isn't in the book of revelation
[1:23:28] when joseph dismisses
[1:23:31] his pride jose the
