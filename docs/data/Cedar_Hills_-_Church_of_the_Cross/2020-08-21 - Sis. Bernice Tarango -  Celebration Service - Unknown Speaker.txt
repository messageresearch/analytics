she's all she said sing for me and uh i didn't know what to sing and then i began to sing victory in jesus it was it it still is one of her favorite songs and and we're gonna we're gonna sing it right now and when i began to sing it to her she threw all her pain through whatever she was going through she she began to sing it with me and that was special i'm going to ask you to stand and we'll sing victory in jesus i heard an old old story how a savior came from glory how he gave his life on calvary to save a wretch like me i heard about his groaning of his precious blood toning then i repented of my sin and won the victory [Applause] o victory in jesus my savior forever he saw me and he bombed me with his redeeming blood he loved me air i knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me to victory beneath [Music] i heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing how he made the lame [Applause] oh and then i cried dear jesus come and heal my broken spirit and somehow jesus came and brought to me the victory o victory jesus my savior [Applause] [Music] he loved me i knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me to victory beneath love [Music] i heard about a mansion he has built for me in glory and i heard about the streets of gold [Music] about the angels singing and the old redemption [Applause] i will sing up there a song of victory victory in jesus my savior forever

jesus is is glorious day [Music] days [Music] some just see someone [Music] down on their knees talking to the air words lost on a breeze some just see tear drop falling to the floor just a waste of time not anything more but it's a direct line to the throne room where you can find someone who cares if you need some room i can tell you there is i can tell you about the time the lord gave me peace with trouble all around he calmed the storm in me and i remember when i cried out he saved my soul yet some have doubts but i know that i know that i know there is a direct line to the throne room where you can find someone who cares [Music] he's always listening and i don't change don't miss this moment [Music] where you can find someone who cares and if you need some proof i can tell you there is there is a direct line to the throne room where you can find someone who cares there is there is power power in prayer [Music] amen i'm going to ask you to stand god bless you tonight we want to turn to the second chapter or the second book of corinthians second corinthians the fifth chapter and the first verse i do want to say that it is an honor that they have asked us to speak tonight for on behalf of the family of of uh sister bernice and uh we want to read the scripture as it is written second corinthians the fifth chapter and the first verse for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens another translation says for we know that when this earthly tent we live in is taken down that is when we die and leave this earthly body we will have a house in heaven an eternal body made for us by god himself and not by human hands i want us to buy our heads in prayer as we approach the author of this scripture that he give us our daily potion we thank you lord jesus for the bottom of our heart for the opportunity to come to address your children tonight on behalf of sister bernice and father we trust that the words that will be spoken tonight may they bring comfort may they bring faith and may they bring power to the hearts of those that will be receiving them lord we ask that as we surrender to you may you receive the words that have been spoken tonight and may the words of our mouth be acceptable in thy sight oh lord today is what we ask in jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated first of all we would like to explain express our condolences to sister debbie and sister dar and to brother joey and uh to the grandchildren to the tarango and the de la garcia family and to the friends and the loved ones and and all the the church family that has united here tonight uh to to honor sister bernice we're grateful that in life that we got to know her between me and her i i would call her bernie and it was we we're we're trusting in the lord that what he brings to to us at this time he brings to us his word the bible says that heavens and earth would pass away but that his word would never pass away his word is eternal if it wasn't for this pandemic that we are envisioning today this place would be jam-packed there wouldn't be enough room to fit here because that's the way we all felt about sister bernice and a great great lady in life and always a great christian in life she might not have preached the message from behind this desk but her life did preach volumes of what she believed and where she stood at and to all you that have come to to honor her her her life and and honor her memory and to to to to see the type of person that she not was but is we we understand then we get our trust and our faith from the sacred scriptures i like to at times try to figure out or try to find out what each person's name means and in the biblical names the meaning of the name bernice is one that brings victory we trust that tonight it won't be words that will be vain or repetitious or words that that will bring you just emotion but something that will anchor in your heart that her life will bring you a victory in your life we trust the sacred scriptures that are the the sufficient strength that we need tonight the bible speaks to us for we know and i trust that everybody here knows this we we are here tonight not in a funeral service we are in a going-home celebration i i prayed to the lord that night that they they said that she might be going or didn't look very well but i prayed and i said lord may her mama and me my mama meet her at the gate we do know that when we get go out of this presence we go into another place we do know that for the christian there is no death i don't know how many christians we have here tonight and i know that that that it's difficult to say amen through our masks but i'll say amen for you and with you so that we could understanding and know the the the simplicity of the gospel there is no death to christians the bible says that he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and brother branham uses the scripture in the message believeth thou this many many times and i i look into the word of god or or sometimes you would would use this the word of god says for we know i i know that many times we sometimes don't know and but we should know the questions to these three questions where do i come from what am i doing here where am i going we should know if we know where we come from we should know where we're going if we know where we come from and we know what we're doing where we're going we should know what we're doing here it is a purpose for us to be here today is not a day to even though it's a sad day even though there will be days that we cry even though there will be days that it seems like there will be no let up in and days that will bring you to a place that you say oh i can't go on any further but once the seed of god that remains inside of our soul kicks in it starts off for we know now i know that right now what god has been doing and has done in your life that whatever he started in your life he is faithful to finish it i do i do understand that where sister bernice is going i do understand where what we should be doing here i don't believe that the word of god was given for us so that we could sit down and take it easy i believe that the word of god comes with purpose i believe it comes with power i believe it comes with authority it comes with responsibility it comes so that the word of god will make a difference from my life to your life we know we know that if our earthly house or this tent were dissolved we have another one waiting for us can you imagine that uh on that day that that she passed on that that they tell me that she her eyes got real big and the biggest smile went across her face knowing that if this body be dissolved we have another one waiting can you imagine a person that's sick and that that that is has suffered for so long looking for what awaits her what awaits us on the other side brother branham would tell us and would describe to us the scene of what was happening on the other side brother branham would tell us about the people the reaction when they would see him on the other side brother branham would tell would would tell us about the testimony that they had about him how he preached to them on this side that propelled them to the other side is a way to god jesus christ spoke speaks to us and says i am the way the truth and the life and no man can come to the father but by me sister bernice found that way she found that path she found that life she found the truth and the truth made her free they said that as she was going days before she was already planning this trip she told our pastor you want to go with me on this trip i'm going to go see my mama they say that she recognized and was talking to people on the other side as she's on this side there is a place and i want everybody to understand this tonight there is a place that is more real than this place there is a place that is eternal there is a place that awaits us there is a glory that we have never experienced before even as tremendous as we say we are but that glory wants to come like a a coat or wants to come like a body and wants to dress us within without and upon that we might know what we are we see ourselves here today and i i see myself many times and as we get older and we get we get more wrinkles that just shows us that that we're going someplace but we know that if this building if this tent you can't even imagine the joy we can't even imagine the joy when god starts calling you me not till my time but me is it my time and when she could no longer walk no more all of a sudden on that side a foot stepped over into the glory land we know that if this body be dissolved we have another one waiting for us that's the joy of the christian that's the joy of the people that have understood what we have received in this last time what we received in our time was the eternal thoughts of god translated through the mouth of a prophet believed in the hearts of believer and acted upon here on this earth what a wonderful thing it is to know where i come from brother branham speaks to us many many things and i do want you to know that every time we have a great service we get a little bit of jubilation in our heart you know what that jubilation is it's where our our representation is just getting getting started you just started every time you raise up your hands every time you glorify you god there is your representation there's your angel on the other side doing the same thing you know why because he knows that there it this is just a little bit of time that we're going to stay here we we ourselves understand and i was talking to my my wife one day and i i said you know it's been 24 years that my mama passed away and i i said it seems like a long time but but for them it's not long it's just like oh there you are sometimes we get get afraid of death and we say this virus might get us and we might die we are all going to die of something the question is is what condition are we going to be in when we die in understanding this then you understand the word of god and brother branham would speak to us but you've got to use faith in god to make it work see so you got your own resurrection inside of you now now this is enough to make the dead raise do you know that jesus never attended a funeral i'm going to say it again you know that jesus never attended a funeral you know why he is the resurrection and the life that's why today we don't celebrate a funeral it's we celebrate a going-home time this is a time when we dismiss ourselves and she dismisses herself from us and enters into that place where she was destined to be so you got your own resurrection inside of you your resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit now when jesus died on the cross his soul descended into hell and preached to the souls that were imprisoned that repented not in the long-suffering days of noah his body went to the grave but before he died he committed his spirit into the hands of god into thy hands command my spirit so you see his spirit went to god his soul went to hell his body went to the grave now that spirit that was in him was the spirit of god the bible says if the same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised christ from the dead will also quicken your mortal bodies now christ could not come back until three days was fulfilled you know there was scriptures as you have heard our pastor say that kept him in the grave there were scriptures that kept him in the grave until everything would be fulfilled there are things that have to still be fulfilled until we see our sister bernice again but again it won't be long brother joey it'll be like oh hi nice to see you there must have been a great announcement that day she died that she went to be with the lord we don't know but if i were to say this i would say the angels started gathering around and and they started harmonizing and i would say that the trumpeteer started playing and i would say that the band started making music and i believe that a strong angel stood up and said sister bernice is coming home why do we believe such a thing because we've had a prophet go to the other side and tell us children we can now go over it is safe to go over [Music] for the nominal believer that believes in their church they don't have that assuredness for a per person that that reads but does nothing about what they read they don't have that assuredness for a preacher like myself that might believe god in one thing but maybe not in the other does not have that assurance but when you have the assurance like i have and like you have we can say but we know but we know but we know but we know if sister bernice was hearing body i'd say but we know that if this earthly body be dissolved we have another one waiting why do we believe such a thing because our soul has had contact with the other side and when our soul gets contacted to the other side it anoints us it inspires us and it gives us something in our heart that is a guarantee gives us as our pastor says the title deed when you got a title d to a piece of property that property is yours when you have the abstract title deed of it that has been checked on it to make sure there's no liens that property is yours and that's what we've done tonight we've checked on this property of god this piece of ground that god had let us have for 52 years and during this time the abstract title deed of her life was taken all the way back and when it was taken all the way back they found out there was no liens on her you know why one day i was guilty of all the charges doomed with sin and disgrace but then a man by his grace stood up and he said i dropped the charges you can't imagine what it is when a man or a woman get a hold of god and you find out that what you did it's not counted to you no more your life before over here might have been a mess i'm talking about hours not hers hours might have been a mess over here but jesus dropped the charges over here i was guilty i was guilty i was gonna go to hell i didn't have a hope i didn't have a resurrection but all of a sudden i received the life of god the seed of god inside of me now resurrection lays within me that's eternal life he said i have power to lay my life down i have power to take it back up again i got power to lay my life down i have power to take it back up again again i have power to lay my life down that's what jesus said i also have power to resurrect myself out of the grave now the prophet of god says this to us now each one of you have power the same way i'm going to tell you again this is a going home celebration again this is a going home celebration this is not a time to mourn even though we will mourn and have already mourned and we'll mourn every every time ours but the bible says that we don't suffer or we don't grieve as people that have no hope we know whom we have believed in we will cry as humans but as people of god and people of promise we say grave where is your sting oh death where is your sting all grave where is your victory you know why each one of us has the same power you know i saw something one day and the lady told the man if there's nothing outside out in the solar system that's a whole lot of wasted space i'd like to say tonight that if brother branham came to bring this message which he did and it came from the back part of the mind of god the eternal thoughts transmitted to us and we don't do nothing about it what a waste of a message but i do not believe that god wastes anything i believe that the word has got to produce the effect and the effect of it is what paul speaks to us that i may know him in the power of his resurrection why is it he understood this scripture if christ be preached that he rose not or that he rose from the dead i'll say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching in vain and your faith is also vain yea you are foul false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then it's then is not christ race this is where we put ourselves today sister bernice is right here if she doesn't raise up christ didn't raise up again if she doesn't raise up christ didn't raise up but the only reason that she's going to raise is because christ raised up from the dead but how is it that many people say that he rose not from the dead why because they don't understand the understanding of the scriptures and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are falling asleep in christ are perished but then he says but now is christ risen this is this this is what the apostle paul tells us all the all the time and he says this and this is the way i always read it that christ raised the third day according to my gospel he would say this how is it that in understanding the power of the resurrection that you must understand where we must understand where we are at in that resurrection when i look at myself and things that i might i might do things that i might not be pleasing to god i shake my head i get disappointed and i think about what he did for me the greatest thing that he did and this is something that i can never ever take out of my mind and about my spirit and out of my soul is how that the god of glory descended to my estate and the spirit that had no flesh took on flesh and he stepped the eternal step into time and when he stepped into time he started suffering like you and i in understanding those things he said yet a little while and the world will see me no more but you shall see me for i will be with you even in you until the end of the age what had happened eternity now steps inside of the believer again eternity now steps inside of the believer how is that for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting or eternal life that eternal life is deposited into the heart and the soul of the person that believes god's word and when it does it anchors there when i want to do something bad it pulls me now if you can go ahead and do it there's nothing that's holding you there's no representation but when i want to do good paul says evil is present and it keeps on pulling me and it keeps on pulling me you know why there is something that makes you rise up from your condition do you know that the word of god and the spirit of god inside of the believer will make you rise above sin you don't have to sin the word of god picks you up into another level picks you up into another place and it takes you into heavenly places in christ jesus and when it does then death becomes just a vehicle to take me to take you to the presence of god and when death comes around and it's your time to go home you hitch him up and you say come on death take me to where i gotta go to now you know why because death to a believer doesn't mean nothing it's just a vehicle to take us where we should be i look at myself and i look at people around us and i say each one of you have the same power the same way because you are sons and daughters of god and the very spirit that's in you this morning the holy spirit that's in you this morning that same holy spirit will raise you up we think it's going to be a different thing than what we possess there is enough power when we are born again inside of you to go and create a new world you say how is it listen there are people over here that are going to be drinking and they're going to be doing drugs and they're going to be doing all kinds of immoral things i don't do that i live in another world i don't belong to this cosmos i don't belong to this place i live here i'm passing through why is it that so many of us christians get stuck and we think we're going to be here forever when the bible says that we're pilgrims and strangers we're just what is a pilgrim and a stranger he's just passing through now i know we need to live i know we need to make a living i know we need to do this or that but in in ourselves we're just passing through here you find the richest man in the bible abraham and he was still passing through you find a man that had need of nothing and he was still passing through he was still looking for a city what was the city going to be he said the city was going to be whose builder and maker was god and he started looking for it started looking it seemed like he didn't find what he was looking for but the promise was that in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed where is the promise then it's in your seed where is your healing at it's in your seed where is your deliverance is in your seed where is your restoration of your family it's in your seed where is the resurrection that'll pick you up one of these days it's in your seed it's got the power in itself to pick you up and present you alive before him what happens abraham had a son named isaac and according to the flesh that was the promise according to the spirit that was not the promise so he was still looking until a man until a man named jesus christ said i'm the son of abraham i am the royal seed of abraham now you and i being counted dead to sin we become abraham's seed and then are now heirs according to the promise and what is the promise we know sister bernice she's around here she's around here it's just been her body just was let let loose that spirit just just let loose release that body but she's around here sister bernice for we know you that maybe we have come to church i'm about ready to to to finish now then we come to church time and in time out and nothing ever changes and we might come and we might read something and we might feel good for a moment but nothing really ever changes you get to the point of understanding of we know it's the same thing in the beginning when god said let us make man and when your representative meets you face to face and you see him you so you say we know again again again let us make man in the in in our image and when you're represented if your angel comes to you and you see him we know we know without a shadow of a doubt that if this earthly tabernacle this tent where we dwell in be dissolved we have another one you know death to a christian is not death death to a christian is the vehicle to take you into the presence of god come on take me that's where i need to be one of these days one of these days brother branham would speak to us you have the power in you now to do that but that power that you have in you now could make a new world imagine children screaming wife screaming husband screaming everybody out of control you know when the devil messes with me at night i said so now you want to hear him don't you and i put on the tape of brother branham he runs for his life you know why that's the voice of god so he runs for his life but i want you to notice that when any time you get into a bind just look to see what's inside of you and when you look to see what's inside of you that's the greatest treasure that has been hidden it's now hidden in earthen vessels those people that have believed and have taken god at his word and say to the dust i will not surrender to the dust they may take my body but they'll never take my spirit they might take my body to the grave but they'll never take my soul they'll never take that part of god that he has placed inside of me by the baptism of the holy ghost assuredness let me tell you very few people can say this let us say this tonight indeed indeed the abstract title deed was traced back and today sister bernice going to your brand new home tomorrow after we place you down in the ground you'll be taking that flight what a day of liberation if you could see where she's going you wouldn't be sad i know you're going to be sad because you're her family and your friend and you're the loved ones but if you could see with your spiritual eyes where she's going you would feel sad for yourself oh she's there no no more wheelchair no more cancer this is a day of sweet release this is a day that i've been waiting for my whole life is when the title deed has been cleared and when it's cleared oh praise his name glory to the land of lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world for we know we know this is the difference between religion and relationship this is different between church and knowing god and the power of his resurrection this is the difference between knowing a creed and a dogma and knowing him and to know him as life so as we're in our bodies sad to see her go i know a few people that are happy to welcome her home and the angels lined up and the choir started singing and the announcement says sister bernice is coming home and everyone in heaven stood up welcome home this is a going-home celebration you know why brother branham and i will finish i am sure lord if this little church this morning could look past the curtain not an affliction among them mr dyer brother joey mr debbie brothers and sisters not an affliction among them there never could be not a sickness nothing but perfection and it's just one breath between here and there from old age to youth from time to eternity from a weary of tomorrow and a sorrow of yesterday till the present time of eternity in perfection sister bernice if i could echo the words of our lord jesus christ welcome home welcome home thou good and faithful servant welcome into the glories of the lord prepared for you since the foundation of the world will miss you sister bernice but as our pastor always says please say hi to our mama tell her we're fighting a good fight we haven't finished our course yet we're not ready to go home yet there's still a lot of work to do but tell her we're doing all right and we'll continue to fight because we know that if our earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have another one waiting for us god bless you amen would you all please stand and we

pictures amen we uh we uh had offered um uh everyone who felt it in their heart to say something uh there was a few of you that uh a few of us that sent out a recording so we want to play those at this time this is brother william ellis i'd just like to first offer my condolences to the tarango de la carsa perez family for their loss that they have had and she was a very special young lady as i can remember she was always wanting to sing in church and she loved church she loved to help with the choir and i remember when they lost their their father at such a very young age and through that they still held on strong a word that they believed and then we went and accepted the message and since then she's been a message believer she's embraced it with all of her heart and i know that she's had a hard time in life i know she suffered the last two years but she was left as a single mom and even like that she raised her kids in the admonition of god she loved the lord with all her heart and the children should be very proud of their mother for being such a lady and bringing them to this message and uh just to let you know that soon and very soon we're going to be able to to meet up with her again either will be taken up in the rapture or we'll have to go by way of the grave but don't fear the grave because it's just a stepping stone to go to a different dimension and she's there and she's no longer in pain and we're just so happy that we had a chance to know sister bernice such a special special lady thank you auntie bernie i love you so much and i miss you and i'll miss you

became good friends sitting at her house till two in the morning drinking coffee she always made you feel so loved and at home one time david and i were there pretty late it ended in us spending the night she insisted we just stayed it was so late and that in the morning she would make us breakfast so she threw joey out of his bed and no doubt in the morning she was there making breakfast no matter what she always made you feel like that she would try and serve you even in her wheelchair she would try and get you something to drink and that's just who she was she always made you feel like you were one of her own another time when i was before i got married she had invited my parents over for dinner and doodle and i had gotten in an argument before we got there and i knew i didn't want to get down because bernice was going to joke and laugh about it so i stayed in the car for a little bit well within two minutes there she was calling my phone saying girl are you gonna get down are you gonna make me roll down the stairs and get you so i got down and of course they were joking but she always had a way of just making you feel better and making you laugh and feel happy and i loved that about her she was always the same she's gonna be missed so much here but i can't even imagine the joy she has being on the other side in a new body no pain at rest and i just can't wait to see her that morning hi bernie just want to say i love you and miss you i know you're in a better place that we all can't wait for our graduation day to to sh uh shake your hand and and all the hands of

tommy for wow an amazing amazing message a message of comfort message of uh um that just brings us peace and um you know there's uh there's a an amazing thing that happened on wednesday and it um something that really uh really inspired me immensely um we were there at the um at the funeral home there in deming and um it was a deb and dar joey and i and we were talking with edgar and he asked us what what day would you like it on he goes uh we have thursday night friday morning friday night saturday saturday morning and the days went on and i thought to myself well i know it's not going to be friday that's uh that's joey's birthday so i switched so i thought to myself well i think it's uh it it's it's probably going to be maybe monday night and joey without any any hesitation he said the greatest gifts i can have on my birthday would be a memorial service for my mother so i tell you what to send off joy [Applause] you know mom never wanted anything fancy those two words were never in the same sentence together she always kept it simple everything she did was just simple i remember meeting her for the first time and getting to know her i was 16 years old and and she had the same part down her middle of her head and 24 years later she still had the same part when she saw something good she didn't want to change it she always wanted to be happy she always she said make sure make sure that in my funeral she said i don't want to have anybody crying please don't play those slow songs i don't want depressing songs in my funeral i want fast songs i want songs of joy i want i want people to be happy i want people to know that that where i'm going it's not a sad depressing place but a place of just happiness you know in in life we are blessed if we have one great mother so blessed but god saw it fit in my life to bless me with two beautiful mothers she wasn't my mother-in-law not for a minute she was my mom she was my mom is what i would call her and she she made three beautiful children that i love so dearly and i'm thankful for the decision the choice she made years ago to leave a place in phoenix and to follow a man that she barely knew and that was my father to have enough revelation to go to a place where god would bless her knowing the hardships that she had in life did she have it easy not not even close did she have a lot of things on this earth as far as material wise nothing but what she had was something so much greater she had a love for people and every everyone i talked to they say the same thing over and over when they made bernie when god made burning he sure broke the mold and i i say that is that is for sure he sure did but i'm so appreciative of what stan she has made for the gospel a stand where it doesn't matter who was against her whether it was family whether it was anybody whoever it might have been but she made a stand for the gospel and my what a stand that was and seeing the last few days of her life you know it was something when when my brother tommy said what her name meant victory we were at the bedside before she passed away my wife was on the right hand side i was on the left hand side joey was on near the feet dar was on the other side of her feet and as she gave her last breaths you know in in life you don't get to see you don't get to see this i might not ever see this ever again in my life but from someone who was battling with everything that she had someone who was fighting fighting to get to heaven i tell you the look of her for the last couple days after she got out of the hospital was she was just fighting over and over and to see her face her body turn from fighting to eyes that were were shut most of the day but that opened so wide i tell you it wasn't it wasn't something that i that i uh that i just thought of or or made up but the room just filled with light as she opened her eyes they got so large and the lady that was fighting finally gave a smile that oh my goodness talking about lighting it it didn't light up a room it lit up your life it lit up your soul to see someone so so sure of where she was going of where she was at of who she saw i remember her saying oh it looks i see people everywhere they're so beautiful they're so young and she said i said i just saw brother branham i was like mom are you are you serious you saw brother branham yeah it's so many people what a life what a life and i'm thankful for my my family i'm thankful for my sister dar my brother joey happy birthday my friend i love you man and i thank god he put it on your heart to have
