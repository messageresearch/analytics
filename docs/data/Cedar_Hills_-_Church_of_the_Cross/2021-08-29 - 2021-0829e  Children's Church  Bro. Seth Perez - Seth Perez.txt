already did mine they can do hers is that anybody here maybe any of the big kids too i don't want to go to church i've already been there like since i was a kid no but like for me that was me too but when jesus says hey just listen for my still small voice hear my words right he said love thy neighbor honor thy father and mother but when you do them and put into action look at your house one day your house was just sitting on the seas of time and now your house is so strong nothing can take you down no devil no big bad wolf can blow it down or thunder right you have a lightning bolt in your
