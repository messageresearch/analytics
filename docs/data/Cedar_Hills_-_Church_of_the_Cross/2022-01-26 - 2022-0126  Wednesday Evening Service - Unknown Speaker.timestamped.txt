[29:30] god bless the musicians and the song
[29:37] we'd like to thank our pastor for the
[29:39] opportunity
[29:43] for his his confidence
[29:48] how many happy to be here
[29:51] hey man we'll take any more time if we
[29:53] can turn in our bibles
[30:00] you first john chapter 3
[30:05] verse 19.
[30:19] and hereby we know that
[30:21] we are of the truth
[30:23] and shall assure our hearts before him
[30:34] a for if our heart condemn us
[30:38] god is greater than our heart and know
[30:40] with all things
[30:50] beloved
[30:52] if our heart condemn us not then we have
[30:55] confidence toward god
[30:57] amados
[30:58] si nuestro corazon no nos reprende con
[31:01] fianca tenemos en
[31:02] dios and whatsoever we ask we receive of
[31:06] him
[31:07] because we keep his commandments
[31:09] and do those things that are pleasing in
[31:11] his sight
[31:16] received
[31:26] and this is his commandment
[31:28] that we should believe on the name of
[31:30] his son jesus christ and love one
[31:32] another as he gave us commandments
[31:44] come on
[31:47] and he that keeps his commandments
[31:49] dwelleth in him
[31:50] and he in him
[31:52] and hereby we know that he abideth in us
[31:56] by the spirit which he hath given up
[32:11] amen may the lord continue to bless his
[32:13] word and you may be seated
[32:21] amen we're always always taught to be
[32:23] ready in season and out of seasons
[32:41] didn't i didn't use any of them
[32:45] that's that's usually the way it works
[32:48] the lord knows what we need and when we
[32:49] need it
[32:54] i was hearing a man the other day
[32:59] and he was he was talking about where
[33:01] people
[33:03] uh stash cash in their house they have
[33:05] their little stash places
[33:13] he was referring it to you you don't
[33:15] always
[33:16] just hide uh your money there but your
[33:18] heart with it
[33:21] is
[33:26] because of course the scripture where
[33:27] where your treasure is there your heart
[33:29] will be also
[33:31] done
[33:34] you got my attention when you said have
[33:36] you ever felt the lord
[33:52] he says
[33:54] it's not
[33:55] to give you less to live on
[34:01] but it's to give you more to live for
[34:06] and
[34:07] you know when the lord's trying to get
[34:08] your attention about something
[34:14] so we're just not here to try and get
[34:16] rich
[34:28] so then
[34:30] i was listening i was as i was taking my
[34:32] kids to school
[34:41] and then
[34:42] the other people get on it it was on the
[34:44] radio and
[34:45] and they said wow that would that was a
[34:47] good lesson
[34:53] and then uh
[34:55] the radio broadcaster says i got a
[34:57] question
[35:00] he said if you
[35:03] could know if god
[35:04] would reveal to you
[35:09] how long you're going to live
[35:12] what you want to know
[35:16] and i only heard for a short time but a
[35:18] hundred percent of the people that
[35:19] called in said no yes
[35:28] so i asked myself and i said well yes
[35:34] you know because people
[35:37] get high and mighty and say i live every
[35:39] day like it's the last thing
[35:42] is
[35:53] so i said i'd like to know in one sense
[35:55] because
[35:56] i know i had a short time to get done
[35:58] what i needed to get done
[36:05] so if you knew it it would probably get
[36:08] you to fulfill your purpose to see
[36:10] supermost
[36:37] and
[36:39] so it brought me to this question
[36:44] if you knew jesus was going to be here
[36:46] in bodily form
[36:51] and you knew ahead of time
[36:59] is
[37:08] would you prepare yourself
[37:12] maybe fast
[37:20] would you
[37:32] christian
[37:41] when i was young it was always dress to
[37:43] impress
[38:02] should always be god's word
[38:07] we don't dictate how you should do
[38:09] things no no
[38:11] no
[38:12] but the pattern is laid out
[38:15] and it's really up to us it's the free
[38:17] moral agency if we're going to follow it
[38:19] yes
[38:22] now don't look to your neighbor take
[38:24] inventory on yourself
[38:29] he's trying to get something tonight
[38:39] this is just me yes
[38:41] yo
[38:45] would you come as holy as you possibly
[38:47] could
[38:53] hold as holy as you could possibly
[38:55] display yourself
[38:58] my question is who are you coming to see
[39:00] when you come to church
[39:04] are you coming to see a man
[39:08] because you might be disappointed
[39:12] that's the whole problem i i have seen
[39:15] esos
[39:17] is too much getting caught up with the
[39:19] flesh
[39:23] that's one of the main things that
[39:24] people encounter when they come to the
[39:26] message yes
[40:07] majority of percentage of time that's
[40:09] how it comes
[40:12] they don't always come in a
[40:14] supernatural lightning bolt
[40:20] it comes from each other
[40:50] now i'm not exempt from this okay
[40:54] instead of following every iota of the
[40:56] scripture and invest
[41:02] we tend to make excuses of doing what we
[41:04] do and why we do it
[41:11] and i know i'm not the only one that's
[41:13] maybe heard it you know
[41:17] well i do it because uh the minister's
[41:20] wife does it
[41:24] the deacon's wife or husband
[41:26] [Music]
[41:30] let them try and tell me
[41:32] they keep
[41:43] hello
[41:51] god will cause a man to fall
[41:56] or
[41:58] cause him to make a minor slip up
[42:15] in my life i've had some of the great
[42:17] examples in this church
[42:21] but when you want to pattern yourself
[42:23] after them more than cry
[42:28] what's the pattern
[42:50] as the scripture says your folly will
[42:51] will be
[42:52] made manifest
[42:58] your folly is is simply your foolishness
[43:05] or your lack of good sense
[43:11] but the moment we look more to
[43:14] to
[43:15] to uh uh just the flesh
[43:21] more than the example of christ
[43:26] when christ is not your focal point
[43:31] or your absolute absolute
[43:33] be careful
[43:36] because you're in danger of causing your
[43:38] brother to
[44:07] so
[44:08] this is this is just my mind
[44:14] we tend to
[44:16] say our reason was really an excuse
[44:27] it allows us to turn an excuse into a
[44:29] good enough reason
[44:46] so you'll feel like you no longer have a
[44:49] guilty conscience
[44:53] so you'll you'll feel like you no longer
[44:55] have a guilty conscience
[45:00] because to you it's not an excuse it's a
[45:02] good reason
[45:09] so as i said take inventory on yourself
[45:19] the brother was talking to brother brano
[45:22] hermanos
[45:24] and he said brother branham i don't
[45:26] preach a clothesline religion
[45:39] this is god's only provided place of
[45:40] worship
[45:44] blessed are the
[45:46] blessed are they that do all the
[45:47] commandments of god
[45:52] that they might have a right to enter in
[45:56] do all god said
[46:01] to carry themselves a certain way
[46:02] dressed a certain way
[46:09] that's what you should do
[46:12] i'm just
[46:25] he said what to do either you do it or
[46:27] you don't
[46:30] know that's your natural reasonable
[46:32] thing sos to uh
[46:35] to
[46:36] your natural reasonable thing to
[46:39] cause um
[46:55] teach us the great things oh and
[46:58] of course as we heard how can i teach
[47:00] you the great things when when you won't
[47:01] do the little thing
[47:07] it's a simple comment thing yes
[48:05] or when the word comes does it correct
[48:06] the error if there is one
[48:12] christ is not something that you just
[48:14] add to your lifestyle
[48:18] he
[48:23] when you choose christ it's not a picnic
[48:27] we've got to be cut we got to be home
[48:32] he has called every believer to live
[48:34] a certain life
[48:41] it's a higher lifestyle
[48:44] like like the angel john come up a
[48:46] little bit higher
[48:49] how many believe they're the bride of
[48:51] christ
[48:53] you really really believe that realm
[48:57] the bride doesn't have to be told
[49:00] no syria
[49:11] but the trouble is we know what the
[49:13] scripture already says
[49:22] i ain't going to go to hell for doing
[49:23] this one little thing
[49:28] it might
[49:47] he says it's not becoming for a
[49:49] christian to do this
[49:53] but it becomes me
[49:56] it becomes
[50:24] the prophet would say the more i preach
[50:26] about it the worse it gets
[50:34] but as long as there's sin
[50:38] the voice of god will cry out against it
[50:43] do you have to be told
[50:48] i refuse
[50:51] to be the reason
[50:52] el
[51:19] because i'm not following the word
[51:20] inside and out
[51:25] but i want to be a christian
[51:27] christian it's so full of the love of
[51:28] god
[51:31] when he looks down at you
[51:34] he could say that's my son whether they
[51:35] said oh it says that's my god
[51:39] in whom i am well pleased and dwelling
[51:45] you might not be the most perfect
[51:47] christian
[52:16] i had something more of a of a study
[52:18] prepared yo
[52:22] studio but he said just say it like this
[52:26] and if they could be reminded
[52:29] you have to be told are you the bride it
[52:33] is
[52:34] the bride don't have to be told
[52:37] i believe we've heard enough
[52:41] to prepare us for his coming
[52:43] preparations
[52:46] the trouble is
[52:47] the problem is in that day we won't have
[52:49] an excuse
[52:52] because we've heard enough
[52:55] god bless
[52:57] [Applause]
[53:21] honor the reading of the word
[53:28] we'll turn take our text from ii timothy
[53:35] chapter 1 verse 6
[53:39] verses
[53:43] wherefore
[53:44] i put thee in remembrance
[53:51] that i'll stir up the gift of god
[54:09] while it's a privilege to preach to the
[54:12] bride of jesus christ
[54:17] i'm here tonight to encourage your faith
[54:20] you already heard from one of god's
[54:22] servants yes
[54:36] will bring
[54:37] any promise of god to pass
[54:43] so as creatures of time
[54:48] i have noticed that we use the word
[54:50] remembrance quite frequently
[54:52] us
[54:56] the pastor gave the youth leadership
[55:02] this scripture that we just read is
[55:17] means the action of remembering
[55:19] something
[55:20] recorded
[55:21] it is a memory or recollection una
[55:24] memoria or recollection to be drawn to
[55:26] the forefront of your mind
[55:28] alfredo
[55:30] all this week
[55:32] today from the beginning of the year is
[55:35] the principle delano the lord kept
[55:37] asking me the question
[55:41] you remember the agueros
[55:44] do you remember who you are
[55:49] do you know where you come from
[55:52] do you know where you're going
[55:55] well remember
[55:57] record
[55:58] is used to emphasize the important
[56:35] well that's pretty simple right this is
[56:37] simply well when i when two people want
[56:40] to have communication to each other when
[56:42] those people together
[56:45] i find there is a simple model that can
[56:47] describe the message that wants to be
[56:49] sent
[56:50] modelos
[56:54] the first person
[56:57] known as the sender
[57:00] and he simply sends a message to the
[57:02] second person
[57:08] he asked the question
[57:10] unless
[57:38] but when the question do you remember is
[57:40] asked
[57:47] already knows what the answer is
[57:52] he wants the receiver to say out loud
[57:57] what is being called to memory
[58:02] so here we find paul
[58:05] pablo he's standing he's writing an
[58:07] important message
[58:20] paul identifies him as the himself as
[58:22] the apostle of the lord jesus christ
[58:27] this message he wants to send to timothy
[58:29] is very important
[58:34] paul is asking timothy to remember pablo
[58:37] ladies
[58:39] remember what record
[58:42] the unfeigned faith that you have left
[58:46] paul is not asking timothy just
[59:16] even though paul sees the faith
[59:21] he wants timothy
[59:24] to recognize that the faith that he has
[59:27] already
[59:44] has already been raised
[59:47] by a faithful grandma
[59:51] and a faithful mama
[59:54] so it's already inside of him
[59:58] it just has to come out
[1:00:00] sometimes we forget who we are
[1:00:04] your grandma might tell you who you are
[1:00:09] and really if we were young
[1:00:26] he
[1:00:26] is asking to receive that information
[1:00:33] so that you are made aware
[1:00:36] from the forefront of your mind alfredo
[1:00:39] who you truly
[1:00:42] it is that seed that god has already
[1:00:45] planted inside of you
[1:00:49] this word is very important
[1:00:52] do you remember
[1:00:54] do you remember who you truly are
[1:00:58] or do you have a fragmented memory
[1:01:01] fragment
[1:01:02] as you look in the bible
[1:01:05] i find that remembrance ties with stir
[1:01:09] up
[1:01:16] in another portion of scripture
[1:01:19] second peter 1 12 segunda de pedro uno
[1:01:50] pablo
[1:01:58] and he's confined to himself
[1:02:01] many of us
[1:02:03] nosotros are told to
[1:02:12] but paul has the right mental attitude
[1:02:14] here
[1:02:17] he knows who he is
[1:02:26] that it has already been in the grandma
[1:02:29] and the mom yes
[1:02:47] no prison
[1:02:48] but in a prison of your own mind
[1:02:53] by the cares of the world
[1:02:56] by the junk that we always put in
[1:03:00] it messes with the memory sometimes
[1:03:05] is what's way way deep inside
[1:03:10] paul had to be reminded in his life
[1:03:14] in his former life he was saul
[1:03:16] into
[1:03:17] vida
[1:03:19] and he consented to the persecution of
[1:03:21] all the christians
[1:03:23] persecution
[1:03:25] he thought this was the right thing to
[1:03:26] do
[1:03:29] but something happened on the road to
[1:03:31] damascus
[1:03:34] special happened to him
[1:03:36] where god had to interject himself
[1:03:41] through the lord jesus christ
[1:03:49] pablo why are you persecuting a
[1:03:51] christian
[1:03:53] christians
[1:03:55] why por que
[1:04:10] and after that this pues de esta had to
[1:04:13] be verified
[1:04:16] through anonymize the prophet
[1:04:19] so everybody knows who paul is
[1:04:23] those who were with him persecuting the
[1:04:26] christians
[1:04:28] christians and the disciples that were
[1:04:29] aware that this was happening
[1:04:34] and though paul was converted
[1:04:38] finally realized who he was
[1:04:41] everybody else los demas
[1:04:44] would see him
[1:04:46] preaching
[1:04:49] preaching to lead each other to christ
[1:04:57] wasn't this the man that was persecuting
[1:04:59] christians a few years ago
[1:05:03] the disciples those disciples were a
[1:05:06] little confused
[1:05:20] so
[1:05:49] but maybe your brother
[1:05:51] maybe your brother
[1:05:53] hermano he still sees you as torah
[1:06:00] maybe some of the other brothers he says
[1:06:16] oh
[1:06:31] sin
[1:06:32] the problem is not
[1:06:34] in his memory
[1:06:36] he's already reminded
[1:06:39] the problem isn't everybody else that
[1:06:41] sees him a problem
[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:57] he wants to win that battle that's in
[1:06:59] your mind
[1:07:01] he wants to defeat you
[1:07:04] even when you're commissioned by god
[1:07:07] he wants to get there first
[1:07:10] do you remember what you used to do
[1:07:51] through his precious blood of jesus
[1:07:52] christ
[1:08:37] and the lord allowed satan to test it
[1:08:47] god already knew
[1:08:49] he already foreign
[1:08:56] and satan said well lord he made a hedge
[1:08:58] around him
[1:09:03] will i give you the permission
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:54] i will make sure he's going to curse you
[1:09:56] to hit your face
[1:09:59] all right go ahead what else
[1:10:16] and he sacrificed offerings into the
[1:10:18] lord
[1:10:21] he wasn't a sinner el nueron pecador he
[1:10:24] was an upright man
[1:10:26] and even though his friends came against
[1:10:28] him
[1:10:43] doubts
[1:10:46] but the faith that was already inside of
[1:10:47] him
[1:10:49] even though he was at a low moment
[1:10:54] wouldn't allow the devil to get in no
[1:10:57] they haven't diablo
[1:10:59] naked i came out of the womb
[1:11:05] the lord gave el senor
[1:11:08] the lord gave el senor and the
[1:11:25] that sometimes you're conditioned
[1:11:27] to condition is not where you want to be
[1:11:30] you may be going through a rough time
[1:11:32] tonight
[1:11:34] but remember remind the devil
[1:11:38] who you

[1:12:15] i'm sorry sometimes this flesh needs a
[1:12:17] little help

[1:13:33] have been in the message
