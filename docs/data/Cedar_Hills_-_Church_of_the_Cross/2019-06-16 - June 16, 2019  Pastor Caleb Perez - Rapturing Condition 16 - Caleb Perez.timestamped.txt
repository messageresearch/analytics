[51:34] what image will they have my baby hairs
[51:36] on the influences defend their late
[51:38] friend yeah it depends on the atmosphere
[51:41] unless most fit on it depends on the
[51:43] seed whether it's in them or not yes
[51:47] remember once again we are all sons of
[51:49] God just in a fallen condition so muster
[51:53] than that on this young guy now
[51:55] we can approach this subject from many
[51:57] angles but watch as we come in from a
[52:01] few different angles they're physically
[52:03] fit this Angulo somebody know that Eve
[52:05] was bone of his bone of Adam's bone
[52:07] flesh of his flesh police whistles he
[52:11] cut her she was not the image Ian
[52:13] literally Martin is that right I mean
[52:16] she was the likeness of that man at all
[52:19] SME Hansa is the hombre amen amen
[52:22] she was to be the glory of that man
[52:25] glorious nobody made in his image he was
[52:28] to be made in the image of God he was
[52:30] suddenly my fundació she was to be his
[52:33] likeness that was made in His image
[52:37] you gotta get that for him very
[52:40] important to understand that as we
[52:42] important think of she was the bride or
[52:45] as the Bride of Christ hey come on I
[52:47] know ya the Keystone we are bone of his
[52:49] bone almost weightless we are the last
[52:51] of his flesh is that in the spirit of
[52:53] his spirit
[52:54] we are ISA samosa teacher and Isha is
[52:58] not the image Church it's a noise like
[53:01] mahisha is the likeness is less than my
[53:03] hands that he got that so far what does
[53:06] look up you gotta get you if you don't
[53:07] get these parts you will you'll lose you
[53:10] or lose whatever later on
[53:12] it's disparities there is one image of
[53:15] the invisible God I only imagine they'll
[53:17] go Simba simply right and then and who
[53:20] was that somebody tell me here in this
[53:21] morning yeah give me that
[53:23] who was the image of the invisible God
[53:25] generally mark indigo Simba Steve Lee
[53:27] the Express image was and is Jesus
[53:30] Christ like any system Oh
[53:34] making sure you know that mosquito say
[53:36] good at minutes we are made in the image
[53:38] of God I'm essentially Martin de Dios
[53:40] but we are not the image there are no
[53:42] somos Lima we are the likeness of that
[53:45] image so more less than my hands are
[53:46] they say nothing for the likeness is the
[53:49] female part working as an aperitif a
[53:51] mini that's why he made both male and
[53:54] female whiskey so I am both Boronia this
[53:57] is why many people do not understand
[53:59] this the Ministry of the son of man and
[54:02] let me tell you anyway because he was
[54:03] called the Son of Man in femal really
[54:06] long because he had to take on the
[54:08] likeness let me handle hombre yes sir
[54:12] yeah that's that's very easy
[54:13] it was fast once again Jesus was called
[54:16] the Son of Man it's just where mother
[54:17] could because it took on the likeness of
[54:20] this of man look at the Melissa my hands
[54:22] are they long do the work of redemption
[54:24] but I said other words you know we when
[54:27] we look at this cuando me Ramos says we
[54:29] understand that the son of man was to be
[54:31] revealed in the last days he was a oh
[54:34] man I know that I know sweetie most yes
[54:36] has he been revealed a story bolado or
[54:39] is he going to be revealed

[54:45] pentacon cannot leave huh it's revealed
[54:49] to you or not since a wheel of stairs
[54:50] and you gotta answer that question
[54:53] people say although brother branham was
[54:55] the son of man oh well oh no he was not
[54:59] no no era he was not the image in no era
[55:02] Leymah him are you with me
[55:05] esta conmigo come on that's why he's not
[55:07] the son of man what does this kid noise
[55:08] but he's in the likeness of man son of
[55:12] man that was to reveal these son of man
[55:17] knowing that the very image of the
[55:19] invisible God camis mother that from
