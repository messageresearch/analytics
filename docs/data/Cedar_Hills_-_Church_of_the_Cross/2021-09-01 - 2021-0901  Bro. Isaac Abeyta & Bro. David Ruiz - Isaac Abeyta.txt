and immediately falling after my brother david [Music] you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] amen you may be seated amen i'd like to of course think thank the lord for the visitation to our pastor and for or like i always say not something i say but we what we've been taught that things don't happen by coincidence but by visitation before i get started i gotta i got a few sets of [Music] yes all right well this this uh this august that just passed it was uh my wife and your anniversary and i'd just like to thank her for for standing with me i put her through a i just uh i got her a new ring in it and it didn't fit her so we gotta get it sized but uh can we give them to my wife [Applause] like we've always been taught that glory and honor always goes to the lord jesus christ but also also this summer it marks 19 years since me and my family have lived here in los angeles a lot a lot of rough times at a good time but as our prophet has taught us some through the waters some to the waters [Music] some to the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood and i'd just like to thank him and his his family for being such a great friend he saved me from a lot of a lot of people i met a lot of ministers a lot of pastors in my years not just because he's our pastor but i've never met a pastor like as he's always taught us and i've always taught my family that we don't take a step unless we feel light of the holy spirit [Music] [Music] so we are the same age we were born in the same year in the same month i think the only difference is one of us was born in the evening and one of us in the morning [Music] he's a little bit taller than i am and he's a little bit better looking but that's uh that's brother brother hammy really abraham is he already told you how old we are the other day so i don't think i got it [Music] how young we are okay it's almost but uh you know where the [Music] man [Applause] uh your time don't start right [Music] let's turn in our scriptures to james chapter one starting with the 22nd verse but be ye doers of the word and not ears only deceiving your own selves he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass break [Music] or he behold it himself and go with his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was illegal amendment may the lord have the blessing to be in your word and you you may be seated [Music] is because it uh it belonged to our founding pastor and when i see our founding pastor preach with it i mean i love blue i mean i don't know if you can tell no brother he told me pick anyone thank you brother who's who's been seeing these these little little creatures migrating or investing whatever you want to call who's been seeing it we're wrong do you have a message going on because if you do i'm not going he gave me the green light okay for those who didn't see put up that first picture those are them and i mean i'm talking by the hundreds and when i know i noticed them after children's first on sunday we took the back road through through by eight mountain camino [Music] i i started to i think i was the only car that was dodging him and i i told i told the family i said we gotta pull over i said we gotta check this out then all [Music] and then a car would come in and the kids would start screaming and say no no [Music] they were going for their lives and a car would come and they'd roll up into a little ball and roll and then keep going and then i heard the lord tell me the journey's got to be completed on its own they gotta do it on their own uh so we we left and me and my wife begin to talk about it and then we started talking about how brother branham would go into nature a lot and then she looked at me and she said man you could preach a message i just kind of looked at her and i was like yeah see so i uh i left it alone and i thought it brother will i really will that's that's his wheelhouse and as and then uh they they transform they don't transform into a butterfly they transform into a bot no no no you know but that that just ain't any moth it's it's it's called the hummingbird park the german is the hummingbird or or the hawkman and then you don't need uh you don't need your clothes in your closet nectar so me and uh and my wife go get some ice cream and we look out the window at these these powers but the last known of of this this i'll just give you a little backstory this this migration or this infestation whatever you want to call it conditions and you might not see him again for another 20 or 30 years i should say it happens only once every 20 to 30 years and the last last time this happened was about 15 to 20 years ago and then it took me to a flower that's called the oregon mountain bros [Music] now there's a lot of prim roses but there is only one oregon mountain that that specific one only grows in the oregon mountains yes and the one that pollinates it the most is the hummingbird mall it says the hummingbird and as i began to see these caterpillars it was something amazing to see you know nature has a sense that god put in it [Music] and they don't waver on it they don't waver on it but they trust the instinct and regardless of what things happen they have they have one mission get to the destination even if it costs them their life they're going to do whatever it takes to get there [Music] and their mission is to get to the to the softest the most fertile ground that they can find now it may seem a little insignificant this is but i've seen some caterpillars go with everything they had i mean with everything they had i've seen some that went and they they were on their journey and they gave up and they were just rolled up in a little ball and i mean they tried and they tried and they tried it and they gave up but you know what happens when they got their wings they became life-giving and they go pollinate the primrose ivan being a true genuine christian christian it means to be contagious it means to be contagious [Music] being contagious means to spread life from one to the other for you to give life when they were getting to the destination they didn't help each other but whoever taught us to leave your brother in the dark who taught us to to kick your brother to the curb [Music] i want to show you what it's like when you're when you are a influence killer understood do you know this this mo only lives from about 10 to 30 days that's its lifespan [Music] what but you cannot get to the destination yes sir it's an [Music] giving up i don't know how to do that as a true christian you're only supposed to do what you're taught we are supposed to be life-givers no you know what you're supposed to do when he's when he can't make it put your hands on his back get behind [Music] but if i want him to get to that place i've got to be the one that pulls get behind your brother i've got to be the one that pulls he's not going to be the one that pushes yeah you can't be afraid to get yourself lost to go out and find the one that's lost you've got yours yourself so that he can increase [Music] so if you are the one that ain't afraid you're the one that gets back here to push you're the one that gets back here because that sets this this train in a perpetual motion meaning that it's a motion that can that won't stop thank you guys [Applause] it reminds me of an african proverb that i that i once heard you got to rely learn to rely on each other because that's really the only way you're going to make it i remember as a young person the pastor i was i was about about your age about a sophomore in high school in high school and he preached a message on a wednesday [Music] i was on a wednesday thursday morning i go to school and if anybody remembers how i used to dress back then you you understand and i went to make sure i was and i have nothing on my face and you [Music] i had on a shirt that was large or extra large wasn't my size i had on ants that were about two three times my size [Music] that was the baggy era that was the baggy era back then [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it is the living christ inside of you and he's looking through your eyes and he's looking at his own reflection so do you see christ when you look in the mirror that changed my life forever what they do guessing by having a taste and knowing it's the truth and then turn around and deny it you might say well i go to church that's what this whole nation has done that's what the churches have done they've turned it down and they crucified the message [Music] they cast him out because they had no use for him and by my life [Music] i claimed to be something that i wasn't even though i was in church every service i knew the message and yet i didn't know the message because it was not yet revealed to me but it wasn't revealed to me who he was when you made that step to become a christian christian it comes with a responsibility it's not just all my life changed [Music] [Music] [Music] but now you don't got an excuse but understand this it comes with a responsibility if the lord puts somebody in your path you're accountable who now there was a time when tiempo when a friend of mine from high school came to get a haircut [Music] and she he was down he said the baby is going to be born without an arm and my first thought was let's get a handkerchief and we'll pray for it and i believe that that baby will receive it but then i said what if it don't take place [Music] and i within myself i went back and forth back and forth [Music] long story short i didn't i didn't do what i felt until i see a little boy walk into the shop [Music] across [Music] if the lord puts somebody in your path he'll never call you to do something without equipping you the lord comes to solomon yes but he and he said lord give me a hearing heart that i may be able to discern the good from the bad [Music] you didn't ask for all these things [Music] we all know the story of when brother branham was was baptizing the in the ohio river [Music] ohio the reason i love this message so much because of all the visions not because of all the miracles but because it's scriptural it's 100 scriptures and it came three times look up i was scared to look up when he did that's when you know the story that some had different different according to the life story there was close to about 10 000 people on the banks i was just a boy i was scared some heard a thunder some heard a voice somehow have different experiences and then the clergy asks what does this mean brother he says this thing this didn't come for me that was the message to forerun the coming the second coming absolutely but when the message put on flesh we become the forerunner similar similar thing happened in the scriptures jesus is speaking here he's saying father glorify thy name and make [Music] and the people that stood there stood by there some heard and said it thundered an angel speaking orlando it was it was the same experience that people had experienced but jesus said this voice came not because of me for your sakes so you know you would know that i'm telling you the truth [Music] to spread life from one to the other [Applause] hey man can you hear me thank you brother isaac for that if we give him a round of applause as we stand to our feet let's go straight into the scripture proverbs 3 5. and can you all hear the interpreter as well hey amen is it up there glory proverbs 3 5 reason this matter trust in the lord stop there probe very similar to brother isaac i had something different that i thought i would come up with initially the title was going to be i hit a rock or a rock hit me uh for those who can see it's still on my ipad i'm not lying but then the next part of that title was going to be but the rock caught me la piedra not a rock caught me no um how is it that my knee feels better today than it did 71 days ago when i had my accident i can't tell you why and and because of this it the title that i initially had right the rock it drew me to look for a message that had the rock in it and on february 24th of 1955 brother brandon preached the message entitled water from the rock and then there paragraph three he says this part i saw adam leave the garden of eden willfully because dot dot dot mi de again and it stopped me because i had already listened to the tape one two three times already but he pauses adam i saw adam leave the garden of eden wilfully because he went out because he loved his wife the very next sentence reads i seen jesus come out and go out with fully he said you'll be a jesusa we hear that the lord did bless and fill with the holy spirit and save the lost eske santos after all that's the main thing we're here for now speaking with brother noah up top we kind of talked about proverbs 3 5. and if they could put it back up there please as you can see it says trust in the lord with all thine heart i i literally looked up what to lean on means and it literally means trust significa so trust in the lord with all thine heart and trust not in thine own understanding [Music] for those who have gone to school there's this awesome thing called the dictionary you can find it on your phone the definitions from merriam webster one of the definitions of medium webster is a mental grasp a comprehension and understanding comes from the root word understand understand means again from the dictionary means to interpret in one of a number of possible ways intended [Music] and depending on the life you've lived how you feel you'll understand it one way uh [Music] and the way you understand it maybe is a million miles away from what i meant is the scripture still up there and i've always had this mental conception that we don't trust with our heart [Music] we trust with her with her head with her mind that's what i've always thought is because that's where the decisions are made on the vienna where my understanding comes from comes from my mind but the scriptures are perfect from a to z and if we go into the greatest battle ever fought preached in 1962 on march 11th when this great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head is decisions because the battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice and i never realized this till i copied it into my tablet the very next sentence is it meets you and from there we're gonna go to first john chapter four verses one through three primera de juan capitulo quatro versus remember the battle is in the mind okay [Music] [Music] and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god how on earth are you supposed to trust in the lord and you but you have to make your now in that same message lean not unto your until that unto thy own understanding preached in 1965 brother branham says this and they say was saying it yeah the word of god is not altogether true la palabras i don't know about you but but when i heard him say it when i read it it don't sit well with me how can part of something that has holy in the title praise god that brother brown doesn't now brother brown then follows up with this how can you have faith in the bible if part of it is inspired and a part of it it's not no if one see you if one quotation is wrong then the whole thing might be wrong and it's all got to be right exactly right [Music] luke 24 25 through 27. and i and it reads in this manner then he said unto them all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken entonces ought not christ who have suffered these things and to enter into his glory necessarily and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself i love that verse 27 beginning at moses and just the old testament prophets no old testament prophets only no no how about just the new testament prophets yes or no no no no no all the prophets prophet he expounded unto them in all the scriptures all the scriptures criticized the prophets now we're going to skip to 1965. brother brown preaches the message entitled if that's made clear by prophecy paragraph 14. now the bible is a different book from all other sacred books so right there you know it's in that category of a sacred book but there's more to it it's not a book of prophecy foretelling future events and it's also the revelation of jesus christ all the way from genesis to revelation apocalypses brings him out in his fullness in soup lenny tooth and what he was and is okay hold on so so luke 24 25 through 27 oh flu falls of heart uh oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken 27 and beginning of moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself it's mine it's meal if it's yours it's yours yes you said that's your stead if it's not and you want it it's free whoa i'm sorry i don't mean to yell but i get excited the prophet that was sent to me tells me that from genesis to revelation it brings out in fullness and plenty to who jesus christ is jesus the new testament hadn't finished being written yet wow the new testament had not been finished written yet and yet he expounded to them beginning of moses and all the prophets all the scriptures the things concerning himself now continue reading and the whole complete book revelation one one two three said the book is a book of the revelation of jesus christ the revelation of jesus christ the word of god i'm serious look at your bible he's not coming back for a book libro he's not coming back for a book if he was coming back for a book why would we be here it's already written john 1 14. and the word was made flesh but when i see that title when yo velvet i think yo pienso and i trust he can feel the yes the lord is not slack concerning his promise how many have been given a promise how many have had to wait 1 2 5 10 15 20 years for the promises does that change the fact that it's still promised to you no no no no no as some men count slackness but is long suffering to us words but that all should come to repentance because he is not willing that any of us should perish you know very very few people know my entire testimony testimonial um my wife does a
