TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] this morning we're speaking on Daniel in captivity and Gabriel flying into instruct him about the future while Daniel was in prayer the Gabriel the Angel come into instruct him no matter how complicated it is God can break it down make it simple now we're going to get into that this morning Israel was redeemed but it was not applied to them because they rejected him but the church received their Redemption amen and he is our kinsman redeemer but in our lesson now in these 70 weeks we find they've come back and received their pardon now let's turn to Daniel and the ninth chapter and the first to the third verses and then we're going to take the 20 to the 27th because this is just Daniel's prayer I want you to read this over and over through the week now until you get it in the first year of dries the Sun seed of the needs which was made King over the rim of the dialed in in the first year of the Arena Daniel stood understood by books that the number of years were all the word of God came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem now the next I set my face unto the Lord God to seek in prayer and supplications and fasting in sacramentation I prayed unto the Lord God and made my confession yet while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in a vision at the beginning begin calls to fly swiftly touch me about the time of the evening of you Annie inform me and talk with me and said oh Daniel I am now calm forth to give thee still and understanding what if we could have only been there how did he find him in prayer the angel the man you know what she calling the man and being all in the beginning of my supplications the Commandment came forth and came forth for him to go and I have come to show thee for a Thou Art greatly beloved before therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city or thy City to finish the transgression to make an end of sin and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision in Prophecy and to anoint the most holy there's the sixthful reason of his coming I know it now therefore know therefore and understand now listen that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks three score and two weeks and the streets shall be built again and the walls even in trouble is time after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come the prince that shall come destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the Covenant listen with many for one week one of these 70 weeks and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and Avalon to cease and for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it destined even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate now the 70 weeks begins now I get this after the church is taken out now everybody understands that say Amen am I Revelation 6 1 2 Revelations 19 20 1 is connected with the 70 weeks therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must stop and explain why are these 70 weeks cause if you don't you'll miss or see you you'll miss those trumpets you'll miss old foul those plagues those three unclean spirits like frogs those three woes the casting out of the red dragon the woman and the sun you miss it all if you don't cause it takes place right here in the 70th week all right that's where it takes place now the Prophet Daniel had been in Babylon for 68 years 68 years he went into captivity in BC 606 and when the vision came to him was was BC 538 538 from 606 leads 68 68 years he had been in Babylon amongst Eden and still had the victory amen amen we can't stay out but Daniel's standing alone with God Amen help the victory for 68 years think of it I don't want to start preaching because this is supposed to be a teaching lesson not Daniel oh my God he had begun to see that the time was getting close just as we are today Daniel began to understand he said by the reading of books and in the first year [Music] all the reign of Daniel and the rain as Daniel understood by books the number of years therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that should be accomplished 70 years in Desolation of Jerusalem Jeremiah and BC 606 prophesied because of their sins and ungodliness that they would be 70 years and I want you to notice how Daniel get an alien yet ousted from his people ousted from his church without one church service without any church to go to without any hymns to be saved but what he's saying himself in the midst of all this still help all the what that's common sense amen amen and if Daniel the Prophet of the Lord could consult Jeremiah's books and bring him to such a place that even Israel coming out all of them alive was coming out of the bathroom to go back to the Homeland will cause him to fast with cycles and Ashes how much more are to do to the Church of the Living God to know that time is fading out in shall be

uh I guess the the roads were flooded God bless them and be with them amen amen so we are happy to be here brother Henry thank you God bless you for helping me this morning amen good to be in the house of the Lord and as we continue this subject of where do you stand number five and we want to put a subtitle to this I was going to put the abomination of desolation but I ended up putting out how is your peace and I'll still deal with a little bit with the other subjects but I want you to ask your neighbor this morning how is your peace that's important this morning once again [Music] amen amen and so as we said last Sunday we have always tried uh with our Western mentality we've tried to understand and an Eastern book and so let's get right into the word this morning and that we won't have service this afternoon but so just just give me your undivided attention and let's just see what the Holy Spirit has to say to us amen amen Mark the 13th chapter and the 14th verse and it says this when you have it you can say Amen they came expecting something we don't want to just sit here in the Pew through their conscience that we came to church open our hearts and let the Lord do with us this morning amen amen reads like this Mark 13 14. but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet standing there or standing where it ought not um I want to really just focus this is our subject right where do you stand so when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not is there is so much there right right there if you're standing where you ought not just you have to check yourself let him that readeth understand then let them that be in Judea flee to the mountains may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated the Lord would bless his word this morning let me be clear this morning as I said and I'm going to say it again if you are standing where you where do you stand this morning it is an Abomination to stand where you ought not to stand and by standing there and it being an Abomination soon or later it will make you desolate how many can how many understand that you stand where you ought not to know will sooner or later make you desolate if you put anything before God for you have put something or someone in the place ought not to be let's let's make this Foundation this morning let's understand these words what is abomination the word Abomination it means something that is detestable something disgusting it is something that is filthy something that is idolatry idolatria but he got that I think they have it they don't have it up there what is Desolation it's to lay waste it's to come to not devastate Devastator to destroy the stream now we know that that's what the enemy comes to do right it's doing coming for one thing to kill and to destroy and so this filthy dirty disgusting idolatry spirit is now this is important where we're going this morning once again when you put something before God sooner or later it will destroy you you might think you get away with it you might think you're okay for a little while soon or later the word Abomination when you take it from the it's something that deserves deserves abhorrence yes it stems from the Latin abominary which means deplor such as an evil Omen significa is is the plural and something abominable is from the Latin AB Homen the Latin meaning away from man meaning that it is something beastly significant they get it ah there you go okay it's something peaceless now take it because we're going to break that down here anything that is a beast as we see in the Book of Revelation it is the Greek word therion it's a Savage Ferocious Beast and where Abomination is there is no peace okay we're gonna join all this together pinch yourself this morning I know maybe it's been a long morning for some of you but you made it to church give your give your neighbor a high five say neighbor you made it this morning good job yeah sometimes I mean you you gotta say hey this this is this is good this is great I'm glad to see you all here once again and where Abomination is there is no peace so the question arises how is your peace you'll understand why I'm asking that if I build something even in me where that should not be there no for certain that there will be no peace if I permit something to come into me that's not God's word there will be no peace if I listen to gossip just put your location I will have no peace how many are with me every time we open ourselves up to those Spirits we're simply saying I have no peace if I open myself up to you false doctrines there is no peace for once our spirit is Disturbed we have no peace let's go to Luke 21 24. we're making this Foundation how many are on the ball this morning ready to see what God has let me see your hands I want to make sure Luke 21 24 says Fall by the edge of the Soul and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem I'm going to say it again Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled and until the Gentile dispensation is fulfilled there will be no peace in Jerusalem I'm going to say it again there will be no peace in Jerusalem one of the things that impacted me the most was probably that seeing Jerusalem trodden down of the Gentiles it is a as I said last Sunday to stand in Jerusalem experience we to know that our Lord and savior walk there Salvador better to see it trodden down by the Gentiles I think the brothers did a wonderful job on Wednesday for the pictures and showing us the videos my that was a wonderful videos so Brother Carlos there's about 950 000 people that live in Jerusalem I didn't know that but I had to look it up and there is that live in the old city of Jerusalem now if you can I don't know if it's working but can you put the first picture up there this is this is this is is what you're looking at it is Jerusalem trodden down you have the old city of Jerusalem it's cut into four quarters you have the Christian quarter El Cristiano The Armenian the Jewish quarters and then the Muslim and then up on the Temple mount that whole area is Al-Aqsa that we heard about and there is the Dome of the Rock as I said when you look at this and you can see the diagram and you can see a lot of things but when you start walking through all the streets here it is show that other picture the next one it's mile after mile of of nothing but vendors just like that I mean all through the city and you want to enjoy that and just just what happened there Kim carrying the cross with all that is because it's trotting down by the church and you're looking at that and you're like wow no wonder the prophet would say the tables are full of them every table everywhere you turn you look at that then we came to the Abomination that is made desolate that was that was standing there and looking up at it was like if you were on an emotional roller coaster you look up there and it is the epitome it's the perfect example of the Abomination made decimals right towards standing is where the holy of holies once stood it is where the Shekinah Glory would come down and he wouldn't come down to meet his people and then to look up there and you say God your stomach turns and so stomach it really is hard to look at yes there is such a a spirit there um which most people should cover up I agree but the spirit that's there the Holy Spirit and and you can see the enemy as quarters they're squatterswaji that they sit there thinking and claiming that it's theirs is and you look at that and and and it comes back to you they will Trot down Jesus the Abomination make desolation they'll Trot Down the Walls of Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation be finished he says and then when that's finished then the Jews will return back into Jerusalem re-establish the temples and the temple worship when I saw this to you and to see with your own eyes the Prophet Daniel was looking at 2600 years that's the beauty about a prophets he can look in the past he's looking 2600 years down the road and he's seeing this the Abomination made Tesla I will mean then you're like no wonder these prophets would cry this was no wonder they would have nervous breaks down there's something standing where it ought not how much more are the prophets when they look through time people standing where they are not how much that causes a breakdown no wonder the the the Earth shook Christ was on the cross the sun didn't want to shine anymore why because that's not okay the way that they envisioned it the prophets all were looking for something greater than that I knew it was coming so when you stand upon this is there is only one thing when I stood looking at it there's only one thing that foreign [Music] that's an abomination and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength shouldn't your Sanctuary be a sanctuary of strength that people can draw from and they shall take away the daily sacrifice is there no more sacrifice in your life no no I must sacrifices come on it doesn't do us no good just to leave it in the scripture bring it closer to home and they shall place the Abomination that maketh desolate now now here's what I'm what I'm I'm trying to get to is because this is very important to understand the message we think that the Abomination that maketh desolate is is just to see those those masks the Dome of the Rock you see that standing where it ought not too but I'm here to tell you that when our Prophet pulled back the curtain this is why I love the the ministry of the Seven Things takes the current remember we preached on that he pulls it back so that we can see because if if that's all we see is that that building the Abomination make desolate let's see where we're going where the Holy Spirit takes us this message is perfect the more places I go to people the more I just say wow I don't care who says it already captured my heart it's already sitting yeah oh church I'm going to say that it's already sitting in this yes I was checking into our hotel I spoke sparked a conversation with uh with the man that was checking us in person and we began to talk about Jesus Jesus of course he didn't want to go anywhere near there well Jesus was just a man that they tried to make him a God Jesus I said no they didn't try to make him a God he is not a God he is I believe that even more than I ever be on any Shadows oh church I'm sorry I'm trying to supposed to be Sunday school I'm supposed to be nice and calm right well um so sick of sick of devil just pushing us around all week long it's time to fight let's let's see what he has here so I said he was God I began to explain to him I said one God in three offices three dispensations he looked at me and said I have never heard that before he says I guess there's a lot more out there than we even know I thought for a momentum oh if I could just be there I don't know but I'm thinking this if I could just be there when the Messiah reveals himself when they're like it was him the whole time oh I wish I just pray I could go there notice this now he reveals himself and they recognize the Messiah really is she showed the sign of the Messiah to the Jews how many know that when did he show the sign of the Messiah when he's told Nathaniel before Philip called you 30 miles away on the other side of a mountain then he turns to the Samaritans chose the sign of the Messiah to the woman at the well go get your husband I don't have a husband one you have now isn't yours what was he doing showing the sign of the Messiah and now in this year he showed is what I told that young Catholic boy there there in Spain said who could know those things show me any Pope any Minister pastor Pastor who have shown the sign of the Messiah it's for real it's reality I believe it I am so convinced you say you weren't convinced before oh I was just almost but there's levels [Music] if you ever want to see the grace of God it was on perfect display Israel what a setup if you could go to Israel right now and gather all those rabbis all those leaders of the Jews he says if I were to go and I would show on the sign of the message a nation would be born in one day and he got all oh that's God's grace his Mercy holding back this is a twinkle in a twinkle of a twinkle of my dad's eye yet foreign because when the Jew s receives the gospel the Gentiles dispensation Allah believe me I'm not running over there so that it can finish but if the Holy Spirit leads us to God there's something that's preparing something I don't try to put something more on ourselves let the Lord use us as you would yes watch this God not permitting his Prophet to go on to Israel for our sake now think about when the hour arrives and the gospel is transferred to the two witnesses not only will Israel accept it now not all of Israel we know that you know that right it's not for all of Israel Israel but there is a hundred and forty four thousands the elect that will receive D stop for a moment because all these things they just make so much sense now we just heard not long ago our our Elder he spoke about when Michael shall stands if you ever see a time that Michael foreign [Music] [Music] right I'll tell you where we're gonna stand that's where we've been standing right next to Michael de Miguel what's the problem it's a problem well it's a problem I don't know if you believe me or not where are you standing we're standing next to our church this is wonderful the devil laughs at that you don't care where you go to church but when he sees something when he sees the Life of Christ why Michael is the Christ Miguel is Christo I didn't say that the prophet of God so now I'm saying it Michael is Christo and at that time the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and the words no matter what happened he continues Christ continues to stand continue and the enemy wants to run us down who is Michael Yes Miguel the Archangel he's the great Prince he is Christ he is the anointed one he is the anointed word of the hour is Revelations 10 1. apocalypse is and I saw another Mighty Angels come down from heaven glow with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head is pillars of fire who is this Mighty angel poderoso and at that day and I killedia John Michael Stan Miguel I saw another mighty name brother says Revelations 10 1. it's Christ is where is he coming to a small little man from Kentucky he's gonna stand where nothing else ought to stand nothing else but Christ pero Cristo comes to this heart and he says this is watch how tremendous this is this Mighty Angel which is Christ and we've heard this time and time again standing with one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth he has jurisdiction over the Beast and the image of the Beast what is he doing he's Bridging the Gap from the Gentile dispensations Revelation 10. Revelations 11. watch him come down you gotta see this image you gotta see this drama it's the finishing up of the Gentile dispensations to Revelations 11. apocalypse the two witnesses now we're getting into something here we have heard all these things but watch it become alive to you why do you think brother Branham preaches the message standing in the gap why does he preach the message something's going on he stands in the Gap while the two prophets of Revelations 11. are called on the scene come on down amen you believe that or you don't believe uh I think I lost you already let's just say God bless you well no no come on you can't be sitting there thinking about tortillas I better stop doing that for myself watch this number Jude 1 9. the healing order who does but if there's a connection with all this and yet Michael the Archangel Miguel who's Michael again is Miguel Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses does not bringing against him a real in accusation but said the Lord rebuked now now this is something so tremendous here I want you to get this why didn't Satan care so much about the body of Moses there is such a type I don't even know if I'm ready for this one there there there's such a typing Shadow here there's something that has that has he's telling us for years and years was it so that he could cause that body to seek corruption and possibly try to keep it from being used again you don't find anywhere else in the scriptures contended for any other body but Moses there's something there I mean I'd like to know what's there I might not understand it fully something is there why would Christ hide it from satanas why would the Angels be his pallbearers you don't see the resurrection what's going on here watch this now some say that Satan wanted to use that body so that the people would idolize him and make him a god there's much more than something like that for the next time that we see Moses come on now where Dundee mountains that's right now this is this is uh something so good what is he representing on Mount Transfiguration he represents the Law representative now this this just got me this morning he represents and he represents those that have died that's right and the only way that we will ever resurrect is that we have been here in Christ there's something here watch this I want I want you to get this Elijah was representing those that will not see death Elias so then why was Michael it says standing there is protecting the body of Moses come here you want to be Michael no no no no no you've got you you want to be Michael get up get up yeah you can't be you can't Michael Michael's a warrior Guerrero okay who you know you're not the devil but you're after this guy's this is Moses body you're wanting to answer this and take it you want corruption to set in so he's going to try to take it now try to lay your head wait wait wait wait you're not paying attention over there if you're going to protect something come here we need to have a little talk before yeah you're over here don't be afraid I love you so if you're gonna protect me right here and you say I'll protect you pastors and you say I'll take a bullet for you imagine this guy has a gun over there horny at me and you're like what do you do oh and there you go I knew you had okay he's trying to get the body of Moses oh there you go look him right in the eyes there now now we're getting somewhere he wants the body of Moses but Christ come on tell him something else liking this now yeah but keep doing that I'm not here back off back off tell him back up you ain't gonna get this body because Christo Michael is Christ Miguel is and I saw another mighty name what is he is transferring the message to the seven things oh church I hope you can see this thank you thank you brother I hope you see this he was protecting it because he knew that the day that Moses would return to his people the Jews the message of Grace oh you got to get this one the message of Grace for the first time would be put into the hands of the Lord that almost don't make sense how could the law handle Grace and everyone saw him and you go to Israel and what are they but Jesus said if you would have known Moses because Moses I'm getting I'm getting here some people we're coming around this corner Moses spoke of him but the law could not produce the Persona and all they know is the law said I don't think you want to be converted to judoism we have 800 laws we got to live by everything foreign [Music] because it's not just him amen Christ with two Prophets God will make the law Giver speak Grace do you see the struggle below that the Apostle Paul trying to get them from law to Grace it was a constant fight after fighting don't do this and don't do that you can't do that and you can't do this again and after a while they're like well the Gentiles have to do the same thing you know I I was not born into my parents being a apostolics or whatnot mean I was born and then they they came out into the message I don't know anything else hearing our founding pastors and he said you see where people miss it today is because they're trying to to take what they what they learned and what they knew in their denominations and they're trying to view the message through the lens of the apostolic church so that's why you have a lot of Pentecostal Apostolic ideas they act the same they do the same thing what happens after a while it's just a Reformation imagine this and those are passion would say you go to the movies for six months you you get put in prayer you've got to sit there and you can't help in the churches I'm thinking everybody will be sitting down and then they come into the message and then they read a quote Oh you get a chance that movie Ten Commandments I got a quote right here the ram said I can go see the Ten Commandments yeah and then from there it went on and on and it went on and on and then there was never a stop anymore no no every new movie comes out what happened the devil slipped in where was Michael Miguel oh they had so many things and he went on and on and if you did this and if you did that and you couldn't you couldn't help and you you know and people would look down on you the young girls would go to the restroom in church would go and follow them and be a chaperone so make sure what are you doing and then well there was no texting on their phones back then nowadays I gotta go to the restroom I I'm not checking there's there one of my universe what's the point that I'm getting there is that we bring those things into the message well let's see what happens here now still with me no idea when I started but who cares why I see this Village though there's so much struggle so much contention within ourselves what is it kids it's the struggle to take us from law is now even in the message there comes a point when the Holy Ghost dwells in your soul yeah the struggle is real la lucha is real there's never been a day like today listen closely this is why I read this there's never been a day like today yeah Satan is contending for your body and I'm not saying for everybody and that's the body of Christo right I'm gonna say it again there is no other body that Satan is content and for the bodies of the members of that body get that I'm gonna say it again he's contending for the body of the members make up the body of Christ he's contending every day your mind I think this week I counted over six seven people that I talked to say their minds they can't stop it struggle in there they're invoices why is there such a struggle come on now check your life is there something standing weird ought not to stop that they shall Michael but what Grace provided was the persona they never could find the body of Moses for it was what the Bible says that that he was buried somewhere in the valley there will be peace there will be peace peace in the valley oh for me O Lord I pray when the end came Moses climbed to the top of Mount Nebo Del Monte into the promised land death came whirl into the air I knew it was all around him Moses looked around laying there by his side they're laid the Rocka I didn't I didn't say this brother so what did he do he's doing he stepped onto the rocks that rock is Jesus Jesus or he's the one that rock is Jesus Jesus so be very sure be very sure cause your Anchor Holds it's the solids he followed it all the way through the Wilderness and then he stops or it followed him he stepped off onto the rock he said and God sent the pallbearers Angels Angels down that rock that fed him when he was hungry water when he was thirsty and at that day yeah amen say that's just for the for the Jews let me get to something a little bit then you'll see Christ through a gentile Prophet will hand over this message to Moses and in life and that's why Michael told Luther what is the Lord let's see what these prophets will be preaching how many know what the prophets will be preaching is it easy foreign they'll be preaching because there is no peace without the king of peace and they are baptizing the same way I don't know that don't excite you yes you were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he promised to give you the gift of the Holy Ghost why can't they receive that too they're baptizing the same way they're doing the same thing that the first Pentecostal fathers and many are following them but that who that Confederation is again that organization moved right on down and even the power of these prophets didn't break it not this confederation of churches as much as Powers they have it does not break we'll make it all one organization and he brings in what is it okay now here we go here here's the Here's the the the curtain being pulled back what is it the Abomination you see that no no watch what the ram says he brings in the Abomination Roman is romanismo it's more than just a building there is because everywhere you look it is a church there is Catholic church every day and they're all like if they're getting along you're standing where you are not even Christ already put one foot on the land and one of the Seas I hope you can put this all together puts it all together for you that Abomination overspreads the whole thing is what makes it the Desolation romanism spread over everywhere it makes desolation because it takes in every filthy thing come on Church don't leave it out there because within ourselves the things that we watch things what are we doing we're taking everything should be Sanctified he can stand there remember the old mother prostitute has ten horns best yeah she had a cup in her hand filthiness of her Abominations oh can you give me 15 minutes oh come on I gotta get this romanismo we got there on the 15 and I'm not trying to make something I'm just giving you some dates we got there on the 15th of September and those of you that were aware of it country of Kazakhstan the pope met Papa it was the seventh congress not by coincidence it was the seventh Congress of the leaders of world and traditional religions September 14th and 15th delegates from over 50 countries met in peace and unity from all of the religions Hinduism Hinduism other religions Pope Francis says the church believes yeah that all Humanity forms but one community and wishes to continue to do so the path of inter-religious dialogue is a shared path to peace he went on to recall his motto his motto for the for the for this visit messengers of peace amen you see how romanism will rule the world so how can they achieve peace without the king of peace I'm gonna change the message a little bit I want you to come here to get something but let's see let's see how the Hebrews Hebrews view peace for a little bit more yeah now watch they use the word Shalom and I think we've all have used it at one time and to us it's like how are you this book that I was reading listening to the language of the Bible to us westerners we understand peace as the absence of War absence or as the calmness of our spirit impasse there's no war going on then go pass careful we don't say peace and security and those these I though these ideas are included in the word peace there is so much more it carries a greater connotation of well-being salute safety Prosperity Prosperity wholeness so when they say shalom shalom they mean the whole thing in modern Hebrew common Greek greeting would be how are you normal they say I'm Grace is going to get me for this she said dad you better go too you hear Hebrew you hear the little it was not too hard so it's better okay this little this literally means is Shalom how is your peace just just give me your attention just for the next 15 minutes how I'm asking each one of you this morning how is your peace nobody can answer that but you not yet how is your peace when we when we see this too sometimes we think of that if our relationship with God Is Right with God our relationship with each other doesn't matter is important yes I have a good relationship with God can't stand my sister how is your peace now now this is what what you get at is that how can God even receive your worship if you are not at peace you still understand past and not now think about this because because it all makes sense now if you come to the altar to offer your gift there you remember that that your brother has ought against you don't give your gift yet leave it at the altar but go and make it right if you're trying to to worship give your gift to God you're not at peace with your brothers say it again in vain do we worship who are we trying to fool well we're ready to go to heaven no we know we're not no no no no let's quit quit with the foolishness go and make it right make your peace how is your peace I don't know ask your neighbors come on now think about it what have you done to your neighbors what have you spoken against oh hmm this qualifies to be a peace offering the most sacrificial offerings were given entirely to God so foreign amen a peace offering friend of the past part was given to God's part was eaten by them familiar the Bible tells us follow peace with all answers without which no man shall see the Lord he wants our worship our offerings come from a heart that is at peace how was your peace this morning I don't know how I'm asking you I was your peace no matter if the whole world is falling apart as long as your soul is at rest and at peace a lot of turmoil but you can't get away from yourself I'm coming around this corner like never before interior there's something standing there in your life not foreign that's why he would send Elijah foreign behold I send you a key Elijah Elias El profeta what was it going to do build the temple he's building it is do not you know that you are the temple I stood there at that Temple Mount where that holy of holies but in the midst of it I hear it again maybe you're going through some hard times there's things that we carry around That's Heavy while listening these things mess with our minds our emotions till it leaves us no self-esteem restaurant [Music] Jamar amen what a purpose church not just to condemn this to call us out as many as I love I rebuke and chasing Jesus see this and I say thank you Lord you feel pretty bad sometimes oh those Jews they really are discipline this is the prophet Christ standing where it ought to he went to the temple and he beat him out of there but those priests were gentle and meek and understanding they come to the fruits of the spirit because they could show more fruits of the spirit than Jesus ever could because when it comes to theology but then when he began to speak they said when's cometh this man where did he come from what Fellowship what organization organization they had a right to do what they did but what they failed to understand they failed to see that he was that the promised word of the hour he was the word all the other were prophets of God but he was the god Prophet not the prophet of God was God the problem and the Pharisees in those days lived a lot Holier life any of us here in America but they were Sinners because they disbelief Christ God wanted to decide what kind of church he wanted it was a Spirit-filled church and if you haven't met that conference yet then raise your hand they knew the scriptures they knew the word that's hard to grasp sometimes but I want to tell you young people you should know the Bible yes but it's not how much Bruno that's the relationship you can't stand over here and say I know Christ remember what we talked about I got a lot of facts about Christ I know what he's supposed to do but have you become one with him all that matters to know the Persona I just want to end with brother William come just so that I can finish this okay it has been trodden down but I want to tell you that he promised to restore Jerusalem Jerusalem is a combination of two names yeah means the Abiding Place the place of Peace there should be once again Jerusalem restored Jerusalem Restaurant it must be the Abiding Place of Peace Jerusalem is the Abiding Place of Peace you want to look for peace everywhere in the wrong place who is this Jerusalem I'll put on him the New Jerusalem right La Novia the church like Listia is the news how many knows itself is the New Jerusalem and in the time of the Millennium it's Israel that's a nation the 12 tribes as a nation but the bride is in the palace he is the queen he is married and shall bring the glory of it she is the Abiding Place of Peace has already for you and foreign I ask you a simple question are you ready for

only going to be foolish virgins done too many wrong things how's your peace super because when the struggle don't stop because something has not been dealt with okay it hasn't been placed under the blood once a worshiper has been no more desires God don't even remember but you don't fight him with the word that's the problem you're fighting him with the church hiding him on somebody else's ideas
