[37:37] ever been in all of humanity that was

[37:56] to work but all my all of heaven parity
[37:59] mental and still has now prepared now

[38:04] event that will let that there will ever
[38:05] be parallel into Muslim de cabrito
[38:08] and that is the return of Jesus Christ
[38:10] to catch away his bride that regressors
[38:12] in your case ooh Cristo para tomar su
[38:14] because of this time that we are living
[38:16] in yes at least attempt linking we must
[38:18] constantly be trying the spirit
[38:20] comentate spiritus
[38:23] it is such a dark time that that you
[38:26] don't realize many times where the
[38:28] spirits come from a school of Isis
[38:30] cannot say that Quentin has we preached
[38:32] last Sunday
[38:33] como pre-cum who seldom restore in the
[38:35] laity mr. Brando Allah it has a believer

[38:42] aim was the player this little is peter
[38:44] las personas we must be able to discern
[38:46] the spirit in us in his people noonim
[38:49] and we must be able to discern the
[38:51] spirit that influences us los the
[38:54] speaker cannot seem flew in because many
[38:56] times we're always looking at the spirit
[38:58] that that if that that is in our brother
[39:00] or sister must be to kiss time that's
[39:03] why we must discern those things also
[39:04] yes thank you no promises there but it
[39:07] always must begin at the house of God
[39:09] and you are the house later on I want to
[39:13] tell you this morning that each one of
[39:15] you is fearfully and wonderfully made
[39:17] this heedless care how many believe that
[39:19] each one of you has been given a gift
[39:23] you know sighs I don't don't to help the
[39:25] body of Christ how did you that what if
[39:27] Pleiades and I said once again every one
[39:29] of you here Caillou no you stay Sachi
[39:31] how many believe me what was McCain
[39:33] every one of you has something to to
[39:35] edify and help the body of Christ I
[39:37] don't know
[39:38] very difficult yet she says I can like
[39:42] yellow and maybe you're embarrassed
[39:44] about your gift just independent is
[39:46] maybe you've been hiding your gift she
[39:48] said little tusks on the end maybe
[39:49] somebody told me told you that you would
[39:51] amount to nothing but let me tell you
[39:54] that every one of you is important to
[39:56] the body of Christ I don't find el
[39:58] puerto Christos we're asked as important
[40:00] as the other one I see como la trobe but
[40:02] the question is are you using what you
[40:04] have been given penile apprentices
[40:06] Dowson the location is do to benefit the
[40:09] body of Christ beneficial quit playing
[40:11] the question is la pregunta and you
[40:14] submit your gift to the gift
[40:16] well yes Amaterasu don't I don't that's
[40:18] where many people fail eyes on them
[40:20] which identified is that many people we
[40:21] are as I said have a gift but we are not
[40:24] willing to submit it to the gift they
[40:26] don't look at em so make they're loyal
[40:28] because of that yeah those are this we
[40:30] go back to it - just a moment of last
[40:34] Sun from last Sunday
[40:35] vamos I'm in second Domingo pasa because
[40:37] we have to understand that that in the
[40:39] church and it was kept in their killing
[40:41] list there is an order that has been
[40:43] established by the Holy Ghost I in order
[40:45] than Estella sido for list and if we
[40:46] work outside of the realm of those of
[40:49] what he has already placed is he
[40:51] grandma's wear that is his plan then we
[40:53] are out of his will and does the most of
[40:55] what I assume once again remember that
[40:57] the highest authority in the local
[40:59] church is the pastor what is the killer
[41:01] Tony that myself and only less yell is
[41:04] Laurel and that's what brother BAM calls
[41:05] the past or the elderly man around your
[41:09] Bible you know what I'm talking about
[41:10] she's telling us where we look at that
[41:12] Wendell me Thomas and we realize you
[41:15] know that most weather there's where
[41:17] people get their funny ideas I use them
[41:19] they like him personally consciously
[41:21] that's where they go off thinking that
[41:22] their unit all by themselves Olympus and
[41:25] okay so not only that they use and that
[41:26] they don't need anyone else he can no
[41:28] necesitan and I'm here to tell you that
[41:30] though gifts and callings are without
[41:32] repentance okay your mellows now you
[41:33] doing this one scene that all they can
[41:35] work when Oh Brad but let me tell you if
[41:38] they are not in the perfect will of God
[41:41] see no Stan and I will hold up perfect
[41:42] and you're out of the of the perfect
[41:45] wheel it's the federal and that God has
[41:47] placed in the church they leveled up
[41:49] they'll Plunkett use DNA / that's when
[41:51] we began to think that we don't need no
[41:53] one else because we have it all
[41:54] ourselves it's something but someone's
[41:56] up in second no necesitamos nothing I'll
[41:58] tell you from me they can best utilize
[41:59] their me without you seen Estella it's
[42:02] out the Holy Spirit is on why because
[42:05] I'm part of the same body orchestra
[42:07] parte del mismo and are my whole
[42:09] mentality in me mentally their whole
[42:11] mentality mentally that should simply be
[42:13] they what am i doing to edify that body
[42:16] that I'm a part of history haciendo
[42:17] pattern if you can see cuerpo del cual
[42:19] sweet but our duty then is to discern
[42:21] the spirits and Cosa Nostra where is the
[42:23] middle quarter we don't just take
[42:25] someone's word for it just because
[42:27] they're a Reverend so-and-so no sort of
[42:29] almost pull up a lot of the alien
[42:30] gravity or because they're older than us
[42:32] or focus on my illness or because one
[42:34] seems more spiritual than us so for
[42:36] goodness I mean I'm a City know we must
[42:38] try the spirits no one knows his spirit
[42:41] watches brother branham begins to show
[42:43] us he is a common laminar anyhow that we
[42:46] must discern the spirits of all is there
[42:48] any law says in the message to sermon a
[42:50] spirit in a second now remember this PDT
[42:52] we are talking about the former and the
[42:54] latter rain that was a blunder like you
[42:56] know if a man comes you know Bolivian
[42:58] and he has a great gift Atheneum grant
[43:00] no matter if he belongs to our to a
[43:03] denomination or another denomination no
[43:05] participant in this he says don't judge
[43:08] him by what denomination he comes from
[43:11] whose get purple diminish unity how he
[43:13] dresses of almost every state but what
[43:15] you want to see is what he's trying to
[43:17] do with that gift
[43:18] look it's tequila various cannot pretend
[43:20] receptionist what purpose he has a
[43:23] propósito tea if he's trying to take his
[43:25] influence
[43:26] seto mile that must be in flames and
[43:28] build himself a great name out of it TCK
[43:31] si quieres aroun grande nombre de I
[43:33] would have discernment of spirit enough
[43:36] your tent Els Taunton is gonna be music
[43:37] know that that's wrong no matter how
[43:40] great a teacher he is they put the
[43:42] kitten grandma wanna share watch how
[43:44] great a teacher he is he's a kitten when
[43:47] maestro say that's what former rain is
[43:49] looking rain this when a you've no
[43:52] matter how great a teaching here is
[43:53] input that getting and maestro's how
[43:55] powerful he is
[43:56] ok Tampa later how intellectual he
[43:59] listened intellect or how
[44:00] gift operates he isn't trying to achieve
[44:05] something for the benefit of the body of
[44:07] Christ sees Ruth in tumors looking at a
[44:09] group identify your spiritual
[44:12] discernment' will tell you that that's
[44:14] wrong please sentiment appropriately
[44:16] that cases that don't matter how
[44:17] accurate or how perfectly protected on
[44:20] perfecto it's wrong if it is not used
[44:23] for the body of Christ Amalia
[44:25] necessarily it is to achieve something
[44:28] but I look at that maybe he's got a
[44:30] great gift that he could draw people
[44:32] together with great instance
[44:35] intellectual or spiritual power openness
[44:38] intellect while they could draw people
[44:40] together Helana looking maybe he's
[44:42] trying to take that gift and make
[44:43] himself famous so that he'll have a big
[44:45] name is that the metaphor mostly know
[44:49] that other brother will look at him as
[44:51] some big person but I cannot remember
[44:52] Lumira and communal and person that's
[44:54] then that's wrong s tamale what is it's
[44:57] it's not hard to discern how easy it is
[45:01] to discern the Lord's necessary to
[45:03] discern the spirit of a man listening
[45:06] what if he has a gift of God is trying
[45:09] to edify the body of Christ such as if
[45:12] you couldn't work but I don't care what
[45:14] he belongs to Newport Anandapur to Niska
[45:16] because you're not discerning the man
[45:18] porque no studies in the end all your
[45:20] discerning the spirit Tyson in doing the
[45:22] lies that is in the man let me like a
[45:24] standalone but and that's what God told
[45:26] us to do not one time was we ever
[45:30] commissioned to discern the man's group
[45:32] and he won't give wasn't as coincidence
[45:34] you know group but we were constrained
[45:37] and commanded of God medicine as a
[45:39] manned or by God to discern the spirit
[45:42] in the man for those things what he's
[45:44] trying to do and what the spirit in his
[45:47] life is trying to lead him to look at
[45:50] his business would be that now we're
[45:52] starting to hit the target okay that's
[45:56] what we're trying to do this morning and
[45:58] look if we're trying to focus in and and
[46:00] see and hit the target the bull's eye
[46:02] and it was apparently that Lancome if we
[46:03] go and we're hitting everywhere íbamos
[46:06] it that much because we need to focus in
[46:08] a little bit Jenna most
[46:09] we need to adjust here a little bit to
[46:12] the right or left and up or down boost
[46:14] and this will pocket the lady show up
[46:15] and so it is with us yes if we're going
[46:19] to Africa si vamos a tonic you try to
[46:22] make a name for ourselves instead of
[46:24] just didn't know but it but also that we
[46:25] can be puffed up when I stand around in
[46:27] flower I'm against they all look what
[46:29] we've done
[46:29] you mean I look cameras hey Cho we are
[46:31] totally wrong estamos totalmente malli
[46:34] you with me church it's not why we go
[46:37] but it's not noise can we go to edify
[46:39] the body of Christ over there vamos eyes
[46:41] if you can't work play Chris play and
[46:43] when we look at this we realize then as
[46:46] we read the book of Joanne Bemis Kelly
[46:48] mustn't leave that he promised to pour
[46:50] out of his spirit upon all flesh
[46:53] Oh mr. master speed to Soviet Academy
[46:55] and we realize though that was the rain
[46:58] falls on the just and the unjust Castle
[47:01] Houska we all know we've heard many
[47:03] messages on that yeah I mean so when we
[47:06] speak about rain but mostly do we speak
[47:09] about the spirit that's falling along as
[47:11] LSP to kiss and there's so many people
[47:14] throughout the years in which they talk
[47:16] about the former latter rain island
[47:19] alike you get them prom night this day
[47:20] they really pushed the latter rain
[47:22] movement Emporia how many I've ever
[47:27] heard on the of the latter rain movement
[47:29] what does I know either like you yet
[47:30] yeah yeah big it's it's a big movement
[47:32] it's a momento grande and it's called
[47:34] the latter rain movement isn't moving
[47:36] into like you yet the bottom line is
[47:37] that people in general they want to be
[47:42] part of something bigger than themselves
[47:44] Gundam they want to be part of some
[47:47] great movement so what do they do it
[47:50] Duchess can see they joined themselves
[47:52] into different movements say only naam
[47:54] which is moving me and the movements
[47:56] that maybe have the same ideas or
[47:58] viewpoints as them mementos que tienen
[48:00] los mismos i it is he that mo came in as
[48:03] course and those of you that go into
[48:05] into to social network you know nowadays
[48:11] it's called the hash tag every time
[48:15] there's a movement going on how this can
[48:17] hashtag and whatever the movement is has
[48:19] taken moving into every but oh I'm part
[48:21] of this hashtag movement
[48:23] testimonial and what it does then that
[48:25] then it brings people supposedly you
[48:28] look at together trailer hit their own
[48:30] ear as well because it is a tree of
[48:33] knowledge of good and evil but cuz you
[48:35] never will they they cannot see me again
[48:36] in this these social media outlets it's
[48:39] the lowest they use it as a way of
[48:42] showing their support for a certain
[48:44] cause let's assemble a panel responders
[48:46] whose progress countless the point is to
[48:48] share certain issues el punto de
[48:50] compartir steatosis with a friend or if
[48:53] you have followers soon amigo city nice
[48:55] Aikido raised in hopes that they will
[48:56] share the same information as parents
[48:59] are given a compartir la misma and what
[49:01] they're trying to do is they're trying
[49:02] to activate you look at that the active
[49:05] at or get a discussion going or
[49:07] concerning that matter
[49:08] oh come on Sarah because I want you to
[49:11] realize once again that it's a tree of
[49:13] knowledge of good and evil you may see
[49:14] the little kissing let go till the end
[49:15] that in one way it brings people
[49:17] together
[49:19] like emptiness but in another sense it
[49:21] incites good or I'm sorry it incites
[49:24] evil you know motivate losing your mind
[49:27] because the mind or the purpose or or or
[49:29] what what what is produced from this I
[49:32] should say but que lo que si producer
[49:34] holidays though is that if someone does
[49:37] not share my point of view you know
[49:39] compared to me Punto at least then they
[49:41] are the enemy
[49:41] and this one is that right then and we
[49:43] have that is just dividing not just the
[49:46] nation it divides the world
[49:47] oh the villainous you hashtag this oh
[49:50] you're not part of that hashtag you're
[49:54] the enemy then the way that we look at
[49:57] things as they look a bit more less but

[58:27] seriously the word was to produce the
[58:29] word Eva pros it was induce a word bride
[58:33] he wound up no yeah
[58:35] now this is is tremendous to me it's

[1:19:20] hitting class so that the masses are led
[1:19:22] by a holy priesthood Achilles muscles
[1:19:24] best and guess what it is true it's
[1:19:26] better that the leadership must be holy

[1:19:34] me right between the eyes me para me in
[1:19:37] Thailand Oh keep on reading it is true
[1:19:40] that the leadership must be holy
[1:19:41] let's go say Santo but then so much the
[1:19:44] whole congregation Camila congregatio
[1:19:47] hey none of us like you wiggle out of it
[1:19:50] nothing that there are some far days
[1:19:52] though oh yes she says further there is
[1:19:56] no place no I you lugar in the world
[1:19:59] where priests or ministers mediate
[1:20:03] between God and the people nor with you
[1:20:07] nor is there a place where they are
[1:20:09] separated in their worship of the Lord
[1:20:11] zip analysis now that I understand you
[1:20:13] God wants all to love and serve Him
[1:20:15] together and what nikolay anism does he
[1:20:19] look at nikolay it destroys those
[1:20:21] precepts and instead separates the
[1:20:26] ministers from the people's the perilous
[1:20:28] ministers l well that makes the leaders
[1:20:30] overlords the instead of servants yes
[1:20:33] yellow status of Moscow del signore else
[1:20:35] this doctrine actually started as a deed
[1:20:37] in the first church in Athena comenzó
[1:20:39] como a chosen and it appears is that the
[1:20:43] problem lay in two words jealous
[1:20:45] palabras can send those palabra Hauser's
[1:20:47] which is press preachers and overseers
[1:20:51] which is Bishop then though the
[1:20:54] scripture shows a look at that there are
[1:20:58] several elders in each church pasensya
[1:21:01] knows and emigration began Uno's MPs the
[1:21:04] Ignatius among them English isn't to
[1:21:06] teach that the idea of a bishop and
[1:21:09] circulate there they obese was one of
[1:21:11] preeminence or authority the preeminence
[1:21:14] territory that control over elders
[1:21:17] control so little since he knows now the
[1:21:19] truth of the matter is the word elder
[1:21:23] lalala signifies the person significant
[1:21:25] a person ah it signifies who the person
[1:21:28] is in his lap and once again alder and
[1:21:31] signifies who the person is akin is that
[1:21:35] while the word bishop the pilar adobe
[1:21:37] signifies the office of the same man
[1:21:39] significant official emizner purse the
[1:21:41] elder is the man the bishop is the
[1:21:45] office of that man
[1:21:46] yellow bees buzzing official elder
[1:21:48] always has and always will refers simply
[1:21:52] to a man's chronological age in the lord
[1:21:55] alcaman tennyson your he is an elder
[1:21:58] it's not because he is elected or
[1:22:01] ordained no but Casilla he ordered a not
[1:22:03] because he is older for kissing he is
[1:22:06] more seasoned brain not a novice noise
[1:22:10] know what he's reliable and dependent
[1:22:13] because of its experience across the
[1:22:15] experience and long-standing proof of
[1:22:18] his christian experience is in the
[1:22:20] premise that paralysis piano connect
[1:22:22] spanish that's why of all of the elders
[1:22:24] here the tone of the older one is the
[1:22:26] elder here that's right because of his
[1:22:28] experience to experience not a novice
[1:22:30] please one that teaches but he does not
[1:22:34] teach his own better new thing yellow
[1:22:36] the end is what we got to understand I
[1:22:38] don't teach my own man understand you me
[1:22:40] procurement I've gotta take what was
[1:22:42] originally planted October local
[1:22:45] authority now maintain what's what's
