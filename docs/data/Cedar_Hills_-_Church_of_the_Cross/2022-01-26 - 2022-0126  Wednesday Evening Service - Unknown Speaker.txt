one of them one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them hallelujah [Music] god bless you this evening god bless the musicians and the song we'd like to thank our pastor for the opportunity for his his confidence how many happy to be here hey man we'll take any more time if we can turn in our bibles you first john chapter 3 verse 19. and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him a for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and know with all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward god amados si nuestro corazon no nos reprende con fianca tenemos en dios and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight received and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandments come on and he that keeps his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given up amen may the lord continue to bless his word and you may be seated amen we're always always taught to be ready in season and out of seasons didn't i didn't use any of them that's that's usually the way it works the lord knows what we need and when we need it i was hearing a man the other day and he was he was talking about where people uh stash cash in their house they have their little stash places he was referring it to you you don't always just hide uh your money there but your heart with it is because of course the scripture where where your treasure is there your heart will be also done you got my attention when you said have you ever felt the lord he says it's not to give you less to live on but it's to give you more to live for and you know when the lord's trying to get your attention about something so we're just not here to try and get rich so then i was listening i was as i was taking my kids to school and then the other people get on it it was on the radio and and they said wow that would that was a good lesson and then uh the radio broadcaster says i got a question he said if you could know if god would reveal to you how long you're going to live what you want to know and i only heard for a short time but a hundred percent of the people that called in said no yes so i asked myself and i said well yes you know because people get high and mighty and say i live every day like it's the last thing is so i said i'd like to know in one sense because i know i had a short time to get done what i needed to get done so if you knew it it would probably get you to fulfill your purpose to see supermost and so it brought me to this question if you knew jesus was going to be here in bodily form and you knew ahead of time is would you prepare yourself maybe fast would you christian when i was young it was always dress to impress should always be god's word we don't dictate how you should do things no no no but the pattern is laid out and it's really up to us it's the free moral agency if we're going to follow it yes now don't look to your neighbor take inventory on yourself he's trying to get something tonight this is just me yes yo would you come as holy as you possibly could hold as holy as you could possibly display yourself my question is who are you coming to see when you come to church are you coming to see a man because you might be disappointed that's the whole problem i i have seen esos is too much getting caught up with the flesh that's one of the main things that people encounter when they come to the message yes majority of percentage of time that's how it comes they don't always come in a supernatural lightning bolt it comes from each other now i'm not exempt from this okay instead of following every iota of the scripture and invest we tend to make excuses of doing what we do and why we do it and i know i'm not the only one that's maybe heard it you know well i do it because uh the minister's wife does it the deacon's wife or husband [Music] let them try and tell me they keep hello god will cause a man to fall or cause him to make a minor slip up in my life i've had some of the great examples in this church but when you want to pattern yourself after them more than cry what's the pattern as the scripture says your folly will will be made manifest your folly is is simply your foolishness or your lack of good sense but the moment we look more to to to uh uh just the flesh more than the example of christ when christ is not your focal point or your absolute absolute be careful because you're in danger of causing your brother to so this is this is just my mind we tend to say our reason was really an excuse it allows us to turn an excuse into a good enough reason so you'll feel like you no longer have a guilty conscience so you'll you'll feel like you no longer have a guilty conscience because to you it's not an excuse it's a good reason so as i said take inventory on yourself the brother was talking to brother brano hermanos and he said brother branham i don't preach a clothesline religion this is god's only provided place of worship blessed are the blessed are they that do all the commandments of god that they might have a right to enter in do all god said to carry themselves a certain way dressed a certain way that's what you should do i'm just he said what to do either you do it or you don't know that's your natural reasonable thing sos to uh to your natural reasonable thing to cause um teach us the great things oh and of course as we heard how can i teach you the great things when when you won't do the little thing it's a simple comment thing yes or when the word comes does it correct the error if there is one christ is not something that you just add to your lifestyle he when you choose christ it's not a picnic we've got to be cut we got to be home he has called every believer to live a certain life it's a higher lifestyle like like the angel john come up a little bit higher how many believe they're the bride of christ you really really believe that realm the bride doesn't have to be told no syria but the trouble is we know what the scripture already says i ain't going to go to hell for doing this one little thing it might he says it's not becoming for a christian to do this but it becomes me it becomes the prophet would say the more i preach about it the worse it gets but as long as there's sin the voice of god will cry out against it do you have to be told i refuse to be the reason el because i'm not following the word inside and out but i want to be a christian christian it's so full of the love of god when he looks down at you he could say that's my son whether they said oh it says that's my god in whom i am well pleased and dwelling you might not be the most perfect christian i had something more of a of a study prepared yo studio but he said just say it like this and if they could be reminded you have to be told are you the bride it is the bride don't have to be told i believe we've heard enough to prepare us for his coming preparations the trouble is the problem is in that day we won't have an excuse because we've heard enough god bless [Applause] honor the reading of the word we'll turn take our text from ii timothy chapter 1 verse 6 verses wherefore i put thee in remembrance that i'll stir up the gift of god while it's a privilege to preach to the bride of jesus christ i'm here tonight to encourage your faith you already heard from one of god's servants yes will bring any promise of god to pass so as creatures of time i have noticed that we use the word remembrance quite frequently us the pastor gave the youth leadership this scripture that we just read is means the action of remembering something recorded it is a memory or recollection una memoria or recollection to be drawn to the forefront of your mind alfredo all this week today from the beginning of the year is the principle delano the lord kept asking me the question you remember the agueros do you remember who you are do you know where you come from do you know where you're going well remember record is used to emphasize the important well that's pretty simple right this is simply well when i when two people want to have communication to each other when those people together i find there is a simple model that can describe the message that wants to be sent modelos the first person known as the sender and he simply sends a message to the second person he asked the question unless but when the question do you remember is asked already knows what the answer is he wants the receiver to say out loud what is being called to memory so here we find paul pablo he's standing he's writing an important message paul identifies him as the himself as the apostle of the lord jesus christ this message he wants to send to timothy is very important paul is asking timothy to remember pablo ladies remember what record the unfeigned faith that you have left paul is not asking timothy just even though paul sees the faith he wants timothy to recognize that the faith that he has already has already been raised by a faithful grandma and a faithful mama so it's already inside of him it just has to come out sometimes we forget who we are your grandma might tell you who you are and really if we were young he is asking to receive that information so that you are made aware from the forefront of your mind alfredo who you truly it is that seed that god has already planted inside of you this word is very important do you remember do you remember who you truly are or do you have a fragmented memory fragment as you look in the bible i find that remembrance ties with stir up in another portion of scripture second peter 1 12 segunda de pedro uno pablo and he's confined to himself many of us nosotros are told to but paul has the right mental attitude here he knows who he is that it has already been in the grandma and the mom yes no prison but in a prison of your own mind by the cares of the world by the junk that we always put in it messes with the memory sometimes is what's way way deep inside paul had to be reminded in his life in his former life he was saul into vida and he consented to the persecution of all the christians persecution he thought this was the right thing to do but something happened on the road to damascus special happened to him where god had to interject himself through the lord jesus christ pablo why are you persecuting a christian christians why por que and after that this pues de esta had to be verified through anonymize the prophet so everybody knows who paul is those who were with him persecuting the christians christians and the disciples that were aware that this was happening and though paul was converted finally realized who he was everybody else los demas would see him preaching preaching to lead each other to christ wasn't this the man that was persecuting christians a few years ago the disciples those disciples were a little confused so but maybe your brother maybe your brother hermano he still sees you as torah maybe some of the other brothers he says oh sin the problem is not in his memory he's already reminded the problem isn't everybody else that sees him a problem [Music] he wants to win that battle that's in your mind he wants to defeat you even when you're commissioned by god he wants to get there first do you remember what you used to do through his precious blood of jesus christ and the lord allowed satan to test it god already knew he already foreign and satan said well lord he made a hedge around him will i give you the permission [Music] i will make sure he's going to curse you to hit your face all right go ahead what else and he sacrificed offerings into the lord he wasn't a sinner el nueron pecador he was an upright man and even though his friends came against him doubts but the faith that was already inside of him even though he was at a low moment wouldn't allow the devil to get in no they haven't diablo naked i came out of the womb the lord gave el senor the lord gave el senor and the that sometimes you're conditioned to condition is not where you want to be you may be going through a rough time tonight but remember remind the devil who you and if your channels aren't clean sometimes this flesh needs a little help i'm sorry sometimes this flesh needs a little help necessity who you truly bless the lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name don't forget all the benefits don't forget all his benefits tonight he is the one who forgiveth all thine iniquity he has healed your diseases if you have a problem in your mind is problematic and it's fragmented the healer is here tonight yes maybe you have to convince yourself maybe it has to be revealed to you and many of those that their parents have been in the message that you were born in the message you already know that god sent a prophet yes you are his bride but remind yourself waking yourself up come on you got to stir it up wake in yourself this beautiful flesh vegas come on and i am reminded every time i come to the house of the lord you i am meant to be quien my purpose my proposition is to help each and every one of you where are your gifts to tell you you are more they seem like yourself you're more than able to overcome they've been said greater mass greater mass is he mayor that lives within me that is in the world things you spend your time too much time with tv with your phone and it causes you to distort your memory it actually is proven it is that you you decrease your cognitivity your verbal memory decreases verbal is [Music] do you remember [Applause] now you have a hard time memory [Music] but through the inspiration of the holy ghost he wants you tonight that's what he's done he wants to get your attention he wants to tell you that you're important maybe when you're more concerned about work and he knows who you are if he wants to restore your memory yes thank you lord for this day gracias thank you for being mindful of us
