your neighbor there's good to be here tonight man tonight we've we've come for the second part of the second party the king of the north and el rey del norte king of the south i think we got your your vines we've been doing a pretty good job to get to our youth and our children and especially to you adults here that is let's start off with the word of prayer as we approach the author gracious most heavenly father lord father celestial or truly it's a pleasure to be here in your presence nor we don't take lightly what you've put upon our shoulders tonight lord let us speak of your goodness amongst one another take us out of the way lord and just let your holy spirit take over my name and we give you all honor and praise we talked about the king of the of the north quite a bit last last wednesday and so we want to dig and and our focal point to tonight is going to be the king of the south and with the help of the lord i believe we're going to get somewhere tonight and try to understand god's word a little bit better amen we want to try to relax a little bit don't don't go by you know our emotions up here because it's this is a good one you start we start digging into it and and you you really sometimes we take for granted the life of the prophet the life of our pastor you know we things that our prophet brought to us i know he he was a major prophet but he had to dig into it just like we have to okay the revelation that god gave to him he had to dig into the scriptures you know just because something came to him he didn't just run with it he had to dig into history and so we you know just want to thank god can you give one to the lord tonight just for the work that they put into it forgive me brother henry if i if i go too fast so let's turn to psalms 83. i read this last wednesday three years but we're going to get to the meats and potatoes why we read this last wednesday psalms 83 and they that hate thee have lifted up the head they have taken crafty council against the people and consulted against thy hidden ones you know now today we're really going to get into to daniel 11 here but it's real tremendous on how here in in the psalms how it prophesied what's going to happen and then daniel prophesies about the same thing you know how that that it's when we get to to the nitty-gritty of it you know it's spirits that control son you know we talk about the king of the north we talk about russia but it was all spirits that we're controlling we could say gorbachev we just go all the way to putin but it's a spirit that was going and it was moving across and when we talk and we bring out who the king of the south was have that mind frame spirits that have gotten a hold espirito santomalo company began to control this was the perfect scripture here that showed how they all come against god's chosen people they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation which we saw this take place when israel first became a nation that the name of israel may no more be in remembrance of israel they wanted to take that completely out for they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against the case you could really you could really see that taking place in the world today because the prophet of god said he says when you talk about how catholicism goes and begins this was in his day he says it's already in effect here yes how much more now than it was back then now verse 6 the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the the philistines with the inhabitants of tyra so if we if we just go and just see those identify each one of those names and those two verses we just read is and i'm trying to hand this over to to our brother abram as fast as we can here too [Music] i'm just trying to lay a foundation for him fundamental so remember the six day war how all these arabic countries came and they went against israel israel we read in chapter 83 of psalms all these arabic countries how that they the scripture prophesied on how they would go against israel it's israel because you know you you look white why the king of the north why was he so adamant about going against israel he was rounding up all these countries to do this and i believe through the spirit brother jimmy is is going to kind of break the history down on that part but this really when we're digging into this and we see the history this scripture these next two verses is what brought light to me on on on when we go and what we see look at what it looks to be hey and the king of the south shall be strong okay you you look at all those out all those countries when you put them together they're small countries or countries that you can't compete with countries like russia the united but don't forget st part that brother carlos had brought up carlos about saudi arabia now that they have control of the united little st points start to come out the king of the south shall be strong it says and one of his princes and he shall be strong above him and have dominion his dominion shall be a great dominion so you can see scripture thomas he he he could be a a big player here and in the end of years they shall join themselves and and with that i'm going to ask ask our brother abram you know because you know how that they're uniting the scripture shows us how they join together so brother abram when when we talk about the king how he starts to come down to the south you wanna about the north king of the north and the king of the south northeast but something had to anoint the king of the north to come down to the south i'll go let me have revelation 16 12. an apocalypse and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water therefore was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared in another message the prophet said the euphrates river dried up so the king of the north could could pass there were two hundred thousand thousand demons spiritual charges they had their cross over also those and notice that the euphrates is passes through egypt israel so how is that your faith is going to dry up isaiah 11 15. and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea and that egyptian sea is the red sea and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river which is the euphrates and shall smite it in seven streams and make the men go over dry shots um and anybody you used answer me who was the first one to cross the euphrates river said that abraham everybody was afraid to cross over nobody had crossed past there and he said that abraham crossed it but we leave that alone notice the king of the north which is russia what is the emblem emblem on the flag of russia can you show it up there question so what is the king daniel 7 three daniel uno aldress in the first year of bell's chaser king of babylon daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters daniel speaking said i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds which will hit later of the heavens stove above upon the great sea daniel and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another vestis grandest and behold another beast a second light to a bear and he raised up itself on one side and had three ribs on his mouth between his teeth and they set us into it arise and devour much flesh they a revelation 13 2 apocalypses and the beast whose eye saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him the power and he sit in great authority quebec el so we know the scripture is compound but what we're trying to get this night okay and which in of all the vicious animals which is one of the strongest there is animals we know there is a bear so that's russia and he comes eviene and he's going to conquer vienna okay i was going to say something but i'll hold it because some of your brothers wouldn't like if i would see it look at the grizzly and the kodiak revelation 7 apocalypse and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree angles and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth industry is saying heard not the earth neither the seeing nor the trees kill we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads [Music] until the angels let the wind with the dead wind blow and they then could come down los angeles and we know that it's going to happen during the great tribulation daniel 11 40. [Music] la and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over peru shall enter also into the glorious land and many countries shall over peace be overthrown but he shall escape out of his hand even edom moab and the chief of the children of aemon enteral tierra gloriosa edom emoab the king of the north is coming where el rey there no the north vienna he's coming against the king of the south vienna country but he says he'll gonna enter into the the mighty god even the lord has spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun onto the going the perfection of beauty god has shined decion perfection so who is the beautiful land glorioso lamentations chapter two and lamentations verse 15. all that passed by clapped their hands at the the hiss and wag their head at the slaughter at the daughter of jerusalem saying is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty the joy so we're ready in verse 41 about edom moab and the sons of amen when the king of the north got there who is amon it is the country of jordan es el pais de jordan why is jordan on this porque esta jordana there have been many wars in the history of israel visto munchas guerras the four angels let loose one wind los cuatro angeles viento that was world war one it was a horrible war on uh [Music] they the battlefield looked like a desert because everything died november the 11th 1919 11 minutes to 11 o'clock has would have started right there but it wasn't time the king of the north head to come north because in the time of their first war the turks ruled jerusalem jerusalem so as the british forces advanced all the way to so the commander of the british forces wired the king of england and he said what shall i do because he didn't want to fire into a sacred city and the king said pray so general ellenbee general ellenby the commander-in-chief of the british forces britannicas he got in a small plane pequeno and as they were flying over jerusalem the people who were not turks or mohammedans they said l b is coming lmb is coming vienna but the turks and the mohammedans they heard something else the allies are coming the airlines are coming they got scared and right away they hosted the white flag sustain when he entered the city because a conquering generals entered on horseback going into the conquered city paying tribute to this sacred city he was the first christian in many years to control jerusalem each year they went by as they went by i'm sorry the nations build more weapons and got more wicked is entrepreneurs malicia but in 1941 the angels let loose another wind and that war ended in 1945. and in may 14 1948 israel declared its independence irrele declare independencia and right away the following day el diante syria syria iraq iraq and jordan entered palestine and right away they took control of many areas entrance attack the forces of israel who were not prepared and i take a lot of settlements in israel yeah in israel and one of them they call it the jewish quarter you know they us of the old city and there was east jerusalem jerusalem and when they came in they destroyed almost everything in east jerusalem destroyed casito and all the residents of jerusalem were expelled 58 synagogues were destroyed some of them were hundreds of years old and they were looted and it is what on the sagrados if we're on guitars this was the total some jewish religions religious sites were turned into chicken coops algunos the jewish cemetery on the mount of olives where the jews had been burying their dead for 2 500 years [Music] can you imagine the desecration that they did in my the tombstones were smashed and used as building material material and many more uh prosthetics that they did and next these territories and they are next is jerusalem after 10 months of fighting israel to control also of certain areas proposed by the united nations and of course jordan took control of east jerusalem jerusalem occidental also known as the west bank or east jerusalem was known as judea occidental judea strip then in 1967 and from egypt the west bank occidental and israel god is jerusalem again israel jerusalem oriental took it away from jordan and the golden heights they took it away from syria and heights i mean because the united nations negotiated a ceasefire an estimated twenty thousand arabs were killed unestimated many conflicts continued munches conflicts continua israel returned the sinai peninsula to egypt [Music] and then they withdrew from the gaza strip in 2005. how many believe his word is this phrase king of the north and king of the south speaking on the king of the south of london and we just heard about the part that jordan played and how is it today as you as you look at jordan at israel and egypt you see how the pope of rome papa the roma is embracing islam islam they are trying to unionize everything so all these different religions can coexist in the last couple of years the pope met the king of jordan at the wailing wall el papa time goes by and he meets with the prime minister of israel minister of israel at the same place now what does that have to do with the king of the south we know as brother ben read in psalms 83 and started to name all those countries that were the arabian countries we know then that these people these leaders leaders jordan is islam is islam israel is jewish israelis the pope claims to represent both catholicism and christianity just as the scripture says of all these arabian countries there is no spices out of it now with all the religions of the world are beginning to unite now through that i want to go back into history just a little bit to show you where these powers originated in the natural natural because the spiritual is always going to type the nazis young people what does that mean what you see happen in history repeat again and again in the spiritual spiritual and as we get into this a little bit we will see what we're talking about now and daniel 11 and daniel god begins it's the angel that's reciting all of this and if you go back to chapter 10 this angel gabriel is the angel gabriel he asked daniel do you understand what's going to happen i have come to make you understand what is going to happen even [Music] for for example brother mike what's north from here in new mexico santa fe albuquerque so if you just say king of the south king of the north del oro north or south from where there's depending on where you're at but when the angel declares this to daniel that it's in reference what will happen to his people in the last days he's talking about israel israel amen man so the king of the south would be south of israel israel and the king of the north of temple would be north of business israel being sandwiched in between israelis and what i want to go to now is when daniel's interpreted the vision of kim nebuchadnezzar he said oh king you are the head of gold you are the king of the babylonian kingdom so then we understand in the history that the babylonian kingdom came to its end and i would like you guys to put up that quote uh that same quote that we read last week out of the beginning and the ending of the gentile dispensation where we talked about how the king of the north is going to come down and go through and lead all the way to armageddon but now i'm down about three paragraphs in paragraph 103. what is it all those prophecies are fulfilled everything right down to this time today notice what the prophet just said okay the prophecies that happen to have to happen afterwards or the prophecies that are happening 105 succeeding that he [Music] and the romans broke up to brings in the alexandria the great with the christian empire alexander so we see in daniel 11 and then when you get to verse 3 let's go to verse 3 and daniel 11. it's going to start talk about the rise of a king and let's read and the it king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will and when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven notice from where he's speaking at he is his kingdom would be divided [Music] now we heard from the children asking or the youth asking who is the king of the east and who is the king of the west if we can get to this part it explains itself by itself based on what happened so this kingdom would be divided not to his posterity the four winds of heaven and not to his posterity did you notice how in spanish it said to his descendants english it uses the word posterity or lineage in other words these that will take over his kingdom okay so going into history entrance historia we find out that alexander the great encounter alexander is grande that in his first 15 years of his reign many years later this place now remember he's a young man it says he started his kingdom when he was 18 years old a little bit into his [Music] sight they got married a few months after his death roxanne gave birth to alexander iv roxanne and at that time alexander he had studied many different religions such a point with the religious anointing that was on him that he called himself the son of zeus now alexander's death was a mystery alexander mysterio remember he's a young man he dies when he's 31 years old his wife roxanne roxanne is pregnant at this point when he dies with alexander the fourth alexander and he dies then alexander iv is born alexander but his death was a mystery for mysterio after dr downing a whole bowl of wine in a party fiesta two weeks later he was dead at the ripe old age of 33 years old and as you see these spirits you may not be able to correlate this with what we're talking about but remember the ones that we're but when alexander died alexander his son was born alexander died the suspicion fell on general and antipater this is cassandra later would order the murders of alexander's widow and son now you can would not be his amen did you get that for me up there the four generals if you can put it up there i don't know if you're able to get it see these were the four generals that took each wanted to take or take a part of the empire or kingdom of alexandria tomorrow alexander and i may not be pronouncing these words right but it's seleucia follow me and this here's why there's no king of the east and king of the west when these these generals started to take over certain areas of the kingdom of alexander could you put that back up there for me celukas ended up taking the part of both simulators and cassandra so the kingdom of solicious was much greater than the kingdom of ptolemy what does this have to do with the king of the north and king of the south the kingdom was divided among these generals ended up with both the part of cassandra and chest that's why there is only king of the north especially he had all three of those and king of the south del sur now as they came down in to the middle east what we know is the middle east today [Music] now what's really interesting is you studied the history on this story history states that the kingdom of the son or or the king of the south queen del rey del sur started with ptolemy in peso and ptolemy in egypt and hypto and all the historians will say egypt was the king of the south history states that from there began the seleucian empire history to the north all the historians will say the king of the north is would then begin to extend to the generations of all the arabian countries and i had a map up there but i i don't think they were able to get it i know josh i had it for last week and we just never never got to it it shows the ptolemy kingdom to the south starting in egypt but it didn't stay in egypt but it extended all the way across into lower russia and china so when the prophet stands up under the anointing and and says but what the holy spirit is saying to the prophets now god knows exactly where all these kingdoms have come to yes and now these spirits are being incarnated and you've seen the same characteristics as being a murderer if you didn't agree with his politics you were a dead guy one religious one ecumenical wanting to gather and unite everything even though they don't agree on nothing and the other one that would kill anybody that disagreed with him that was the beginning of the king of the south this is the principle but where is the king of the south today what coalition does that have with jordan do you see the pope going and talking to putin no you see the princess principes of the king of the south the lost is the yeah and makes an agreement with them a little over 15 minutes but i want to get to a park here that shows something so tremendous and it's the ben read it i'm going to skip verse 5 because he or he already went over there but i want to go to verse 6. and in the end of years they shall join themselves together did you notice how it said in spanish alliance in english it says agreement or they'll come together another word is covenant they would make a covenant and the king's daughter of the south shall come to the kings of the north to make an agreement this is something that is so tremendous the the grandson of celusius is [Music] but the reason they had to make an agreement or an alliance is that his grandson no longer wanted her for wife and he had to make an alliance because he wanted to marry the king of the south's daughter and the reason they had to make an agreement or an alliance is because this the children are sons of late ladies the ladies if he put her away he marries another casa it had to be a marriage alliance had to be a marriage according to the government and what does this take us to i cannot just take us to the spiritual application of how church and state are but guess what happens after a while he gets tired of her and he wants to take back his original wife so here they go again here the king of the north and the king of the south in history where this began they begin to go at it in peace because of a marriage alliance to not go any further than that into the spirit when brother branham said branham yet the early church in the system of the church put away christ and married the papal system that's in the spiritual spiritual and where is that work going to come now it's happening right before us because the alliances are are covenants that are being made right now are not only against israel israel the ones over there in the middle east but against us here as the bride of christ so this is just a little basic history on these four generals and you can see how as the solution empire grew como este imperio all the way into russia esta russia and all those generations all those spirits this is a small way over yes we've heard how that russia rejected the revival of the holy spirit but guess of confederation that ben read about in chapter 83 and who is this confederation that's coming from the south that are gathering everybody together and guess what of the religious people that are in russia right now three or four percent are catholic very small percentage of what we would we would call christian when a [Music] and the king of the south making alliances together to coexist something happens that causes them to break that alliance exactly the way this grandson of um celsius i always forget that name and i personally believe this is me now of unity of confederating everything together including russia yes one in the great tribulation rome roma and israel israel make a covenant in the midst of all this alliance and that is going to cause repercussions in the homemade release all through the europe will affect russia it will affect everything and then we'll see what happens after that covenants broke 30 minutes i better stop right there pretty good will you be in there so i i i hope it painted a good picture you know just just how these because a lot of times we it's easy to lose track on on we start talking about history start talking about what this general did because you know when we started first started we kept on running into dead ends but when we look at the whole picture why did why does everything leading to [Music] and that's what the prophet tells us is when this covenant is broke because one thing that we didn't cover and i know our time is just about up is when the scripture in chapter 11 talks about how that these there would be a lot of flatteries and these covenants that are joined together and the scripture actually tells you that they sit at the same table and they began to talk mischief and speak lies one to the other because that's what it is if you read real quick verse 27 chapter 11. this is talking both of the king of the north and the south london because they all have their own agendas you that's one thing we got to look at they have their agendas they're all looking for the same thing when you talk about the king of the north and the south island both these king's hearts you gotta look right let's try to just think of it realistic you know when rome comes in roma entra the russian people government all the arabics los arabis ain't going to take their agenda because what is their agenda religion and to take all the money from the people so both the muslims and the communists are not going to buy it so that's why the scripture says they'll begin to sit at the same table and they'll begin to speak lies why just to get and it the scripture says with flatteries they began to make this bond one you know so at the end of the day we look at it what is it it's the spirits that are controlling each region fernando pueblo and it begins to govern it that's why i like what our our our elders said how why why are they coming to the that euphrates river abram you know we got about five minutes you know we're here i don't know if you all want to throw some questions at us regarding the king of the north where we we've been studying this for quite some time i'm sure i got i got both the atomic bombs on each side any questions out there yeah no questions yes sister you know i know we talked about that part with the laptop jim you want to hit hit that part of it or tomorrow but when this comes to what the prophet calls comes to the head to give you an example it happening and forming right now the same with the king of the south which started in egypt but it went up in arabia saudi arabia all those different arabian countries so when this really goes down and the king of the north goes in to the city of jerusalem he goes the bride will be gone just remember the great tribulation we know is three and a half years so there's that's a lot of events that are going to be taking place especially when you look at daniel 11. so we see that on how the king of the north starts to come down so there's you know it it's a process that he's going to do to come down but you gotta take take the years that that when the bride's gone of all these events that will be taking place uh one thing that i had asked i had asked the elder if he could just bring down a little bit lower to us just because the questions when because on chapter 11 one of the the greatest parts that really impacted this was when he starts talking about the abomination that make it desolation and he had talked about the mosque of omar you know a lot of people don't really see the concept of of what all took place there nobel concept i had asked him because he when me and him were talking about he brought it down to earth he's got a gift he's got a gift you know and what i say i say it in short you know i know our time is up but the mosque of and the question was why did the muslims and and uh they build a mosque of omar because there was a most sacred place and when they built the mosque of omar la mesquita del mar they didn't let the jews come to the uh enter to that place it started right there because that was they said the center is the most sacred place and that god started there but the mosque is history we have a prophet who brought him out of history so the question is what is the obama nation of desolation because he said he will continue unto the consummation and it will be the over spreading of desolation what is the opposition spreading of desolation because we see it as a battle but when you go there to the to the mosque of omar here you have israel and and the jordan fighting over rights who who's going to protect it who's going to get to worship it's a battle just like it is with us with that confederation god's word and i believe that um there's many more that are coming now you guys have got the good news but we're continuing on [Applause] amen how many enjoyed that tonight man let's give them another applause they stand to your feet [Applause] [Music] you deserve the glory [Music] and the honor lord we lift our hands in worship as we lift your holy
