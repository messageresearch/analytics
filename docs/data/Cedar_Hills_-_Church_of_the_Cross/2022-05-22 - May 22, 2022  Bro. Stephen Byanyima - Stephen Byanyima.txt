that came and they had spent like 20 years without talking to each other and instead of joining the bride you are separating that's why you think that brothers we are not working together but when a brother came to los hermanos we are broken i remember when when when the brothers were preaching there was a girl who had to come and hear the demonic spirits they are the holy spirit at their home and because of the world the demons started seeing fires singing angels [Music] i will say the other spirits calling calling she shows us if she has gone mad but through prayer at the end of the

and wonders the sign the brothers were able to come que los hermanos put here on the benign and uh uh after that i'm i'm just looking at my time so that i mean i'm able to so uh there is a mighty revival going on in uganda in uganda because of what the what the brother left behind her baptism over hundreds and hundreds of personas being baptized we have never seen that before because [Music] continuing to and i believe this revival is going to continue so and i'm so happy that they are they have they have been doing the translation work and we are so much blessed in uganda because now there is a seven church book in actuaries [Applause] when you go to uganda the actually is part of the country that has suffered the most when where many people were killed when the is yeah so that's my testimony sos me testimonial yes which i wanted to pass before you yeah we can stand up for the reading of the words my father may hear from you bless the reading of the word in jesus name amen amen yeah so we are going to open your bibles says i'm going to reach from verse 26 to verse 29. even the mystery which had been hidden from ages and from generation but now is made manifest with saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory gloria is whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus i according to his working which works in me mightily potentially in me you can also read ephesians chapter 3 verse 14. for this cause i bow my knees unto the father follow jesus christ that he will do grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the mighty by his spirit by the inner man that christ may drill in your heart by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all things what is the breathe and the rains and the deeps and the heights says and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of god now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundance above all that we ask we ask for things according to the be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages or without end gloria jesus amen in that hour jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said i thank thee oh father lord of heaven and earth that thou has hidden these things from the wise and breeding and has revealed them and to babies even so father for so it seems good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knows the who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son that he to whom they serve reveal him in and he turned in him into his disciple and said privacy blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have noticed and my inspiration is christ is the mystery of god revealed it means spiracion viene del mensah [Applause] that the prophet said that god had a purpose and the self existence but because of that nature is his attributes attributes he started to speak out hallelujah let there be lights he created the heavens and begin to create the things of the earth existed but where was creating those things he had an idea pero quantity oh and everything was passing through before adam and adam was naming them but after naming all those things still he remained lonely then god put him to sleep and doctor then he made him a help man and when adam stood equando he looked as a being that looked like him because he was like a god commodity he had the mind of god in him he said this is born of my body is west and when god created them and god gave them his word lesbian super lover to protect them from evil but he left them on uh uh on a free will pero los vejo and libre al del rio because told him that if you if you eat on the tree of life you you you live pasta if you eat on the tree of knowledge of good and evil then you you die but god knew that they will fall peru because he knew that they would not what they would not be able to stand he wanted to reveal himself oh great to god or gloria when when when he gave them they from three moto uh agents they are free to choose hallelujah hallelujah of course adam could not fall okay adam nope famous layering conscious genesis you love him they are man you say there yes chapter 1 yes and god says let us make man in our image after all likeness and let them have dominion over his the fish of the sea and over the floors of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every crippling things that people are upon the earth created a man in his own image in the image of god created in him may and fear created in them and and god bless them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and ravish the earth and seduce it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the floors of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth is so we see that god had a family on the earth which was in a fellowship in harmony with him and was no problem at all he not be another program man and he started his campaign in heaven he commenced comments to companies and was kicked out of heaven and you see him creeping down into eden yeah discovered how we are going to bring children that was not god's way hallelujah hallelujah you've never waited enough because god already told him that he are going to multiply upon the earth but the woman was deceived and he came running to adam adam knowing that the woman is deceived he had the right to reject she agreed to join her in disobedience so adam was not deceived adam knew what he was doing was fear came in his heart [Music] pain pain fear automates you brings pain to you did you eat on the tree come mr delarvol that i told you not to eat us and he certainly now bringing excuse he excused he comments so so god goes again to the woman now because before god brings judgment if i see how to investigate primarily [Music] is going to crush your head hallelujah oh great to god oh glory to the woman i said because of what you have done this is por causa que lo que as echo man is going to rule over hombre and in in pain you are going to produce a producer and afterwards he came to the man it is passing judgment hallelujah and wish you i said because of what you are done you are going to uh cast is the ground they say a percussion entonces el diablo escuchando that's why he tried to kill abel thinking that he has he is going to kill that seed is but when the enemy came in and brought that separation came to work again adam adam where are you your good works without jesus blood is the first iran troops to escape no more god is a holy god this year christ holy god that even angel fear to look upon his face los angeles the only relationship we have with the god now is the blood of jesus christ is chased away i chased them away from heaven hallelujah hallelujah our own relationship we are with god hallelujah so you see that the entire bible vermont bibliontera is the relation of the mystery of god in christ the mysterious hallelujah oh great god oh glory adios that's why jesus said that blessed are your eyes christ blesses your eyes blessed are your ears i want to tell you there's one still this is the best age to be in horizontal when the seven seals are open when all measures are open that's why we are here with us [Applause] i felt hallelujah it's the bride who has eyes who knows what's going on is sleeping latin fat why is that your brain's awakening [Applause] is that's when they are going to embrace this message that's when they are going to believe jesus christ by their prophets of christ that we preach the most sunday give up elijah elias hallelujah hallelujah oh great to god oh glory to you and we can see all these things happening foreign oh great to god oh glory of yours god's purpose are being are being are being manifested now they are unfolding this morning he says the mystery of god revealed now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak to you to the church this morning the the hidden mystery of god that you had and how it's unfolding itself right down to this present hour separated hallelujah so you see that god wants to reveal myself he had to create himself a body because it could not come as god in his glory or is the express image so when when he came in his son was so perfect like to him that was between jesus and the father the roman brand this who jesus christ is the queerness jesus christ to you hallelujah hallelujah a new path is a revelation so he began to reveal himself in christ came to try him comments oh great god oh gloria dios he thought that he was like like others who he has been killed foreign because he knew that the word of god is able to overcome the devil put the people in any place at any time he's defeating the devil and if you take that word of god and put it on your mouth speaking yes hallelujah hallelujah so you see him calling disciples ben lopen preaching to them they are so happy but one day decide to check whether the world has entered that's a personal question jesus christ is healing yes is the hope of glory gloria hallelujah hallelujah is everything to me then peter entonces nobody knew nadi and sevilla they were just imagining a stubborn number imagine but there are no confidence to speak what they whether they are convinced [Applause] and told him jesus now what are you preaching they say our jesus christ i don't deko i attract because jesus knew that's not peter speaking pedro oblando but he could go beyond the peter's screen traffic el padre and he told me that if it was the grace of god era la gracia de dios that the preacher never cut in the throat he was going for the throat by the grace of god made him to cut the ear el ella but down that was where the understanding of peter stopped camera in order to redeem us him what the devil stole from us hallelujah hallelujah so he said that god revealed himself fully in christ completamente increasing in him was the fullness of the goddess all the fullness in christ and the grace of god [Applause] word of god hallelujah so you must be born again in others under the kingdom of god because the new bar the the the autobahn porque oh glory adios oh you see then it's a grace to be born in the message to be born when your parents are in the message and bring you i'm going to follow jesus i'm going to know this god whom my father's talking about i'm going to know this god whom my father is talking about your boy is because god does hallelujah you look at jacob look at jacob mira jacob he had to meet god by himself he had he had to wrestle hallelujah if we say that we don't have a see the symbols can not enable speculation that's why if you you do all the law enforcement who came to jesus i said what can i do i have done that since i was a baby that means he was brought up in a christian family is one of the sisters and at the end he ended up in hell hallelujah hallelujah so when you when we come pero cuando venemos and the word of god comes to us was created never came with the sin wait created the sin in him he never had seen in him so adam could speak to his wife and thought that was the problem of god for these that would put it that's why that god has not changed my wife esposa i want a baby boy quiero un nino and this baby boy is going to be called thomas yes hallelujah and that boy will be born but you see why you see why then you and why did god uh produce and made a man with a with a with a male organ and the other female organs god made you very mad like that because man was made different from women woman was made with a nature la mujer con la natura is so much emotional mass emotional and a man is masonic a lombre is mass and it's not it's not so much move there's no emotion creature it's it's it's not so much emotion emotional that's why the women are so much touched is the word of god touched them so much the presence of god because of this nature they are made they are free to release themselves the weakness in them is the nature that they are made la fragile because they have left their position or the because of the nature that we have made the way he made him alone no more but something pressure should be loud a man has and that which you produce you're located life the name will be the eterna we are born by the incorruptible seed of the word of god then you have another nature hallelujah ultra clear of god is in you hallelujah hallelujah drop you can be dropped and make his mistakes that's what the bible says that look at this if we say we don't sin then we obey god a liar and it says that a child of god does not see because the seed of god is by the seed of god but you can be you can make a mistake and when you make a mistake you need to download most of his disciples had run away when we look at men we can see our type maria el tipo hallelujah because the bible talks about jesus and the bride jesus illinois that's why you have to go to disciples if you have faith you can do all things yes but most time we are in the five senses and they make us to not see afar but the works i do shall rule also alligator works than this and they met a man who looked at them in contrary because they had an oil joy in their heart this must be millionaires but i said that i have what you need look at this satan i have the word of god if you need the word of god then that i'll give you that jesus christ is believe that christ dressed in you by faith i rather have intellectual faith the holy spirit will come and anoint that intellectual faith it becomes perfect faith i was talking about a woman who was not
