[20:47] such an honor yes
[20:50] and tonight
[20:53] I'm gonna try to get you to use your
[20:55] thinking caps a little bit
[21:03] and I would like to start off in the
[21:07] scripture by going to Colossians chapter
[21:10] one
[21:13] and I'm sure you saw the title of the
[21:16] message
[21:21] the firstborn from
[21:26] and we know that our our pastor puts on
[21:30] the firstborn among many brothers
[21:35] but I would like this little over help
[21:38] us tie those two things together tonight
[21:48] and we start with verse 15 actually yeah
[21:53] many of us have read this over and over
[21:56] videos
[21:59] it's good to see all the Bibles open is
[22:04] who is the image of the invisible God
[22:07] the firstborn of every creature it is
[22:15] amen next verse please for by him were
[22:19] all things created that are in heaven
[22:21] that are in the earth visible and
[22:24] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[22:26] dominions or principalities or Powers
[22:28] all things were created by Him and
[22:32] foreign
[22:41] [Music]
[22:52] foreign
[22:56] and she is before all things
[22:58] and by him all things consist yes
[23:07] now how about verse 18.
[23:10] and here's the head of the body
[23:16] the church like Iglesia the four walls
[23:19] us
[23:25] who is the beginning of the firstborn
[23:29] from the dead
[23:33] that in all things he might have the
[23:37] preeminence
[23:41] amen amen let us pray Lord Jesus
[23:45] we thank you Lord for your word tonight
[23:48] we
[23:53] so humbly approach it Lord
[23:56] I feel a little nervous tonight
[24:01] because I know your children hang on to
[24:03] every word
[24:06] that has been spoken by our Prophet yes
[24:11] and written in Europe where the Holy
[24:14] Bible yes
[24:17] and Lord we just waited you with this
[24:21] anoint us to speak only your words
[24:26] in the precious name of our Lord and
[24:29] Savior Jesus Christ
[24:33] amen and amen amen you may be seated
[24:36] now we're going to turn to Colossians
[24:39] chapter three
[24:43] amen amen verses 10 and 11 verses yes
[24:49] and have put on the new man
[24:53] which is renewed in the knowledge after
[24:56] the image of him that created
[25:00] plan
[25:10] where there is neither Greek nor Jew
[25:13] circumcision or uncircumcision
[25:16] Barbarian I don't know if I say this
[25:19] word right
[25:20] Guardian Bond nor free but Christ watch
[25:24] this Christ is all
[25:28] and in all
[25:29] right
[25:34] [Music]
[25:44] God's perfect family tree
[25:47] our world familiar Perfecto how many
[25:51] believe you're a part of that perfect
[25:53] family tree part
[25:58] and as we get into it we're going to
[26:00] find out
[26:01] how is it that we can truly love one
[26:04] another
[26:08] and why many times we really don't love
[26:11] one another correctly
[26:15] correct my hand first
[26:19] so I'm not throwing this there's nobody
[26:22] it's because we don't understand is
[26:27] God's family tree
[26:30] familiar de dios should have been
[26:33] established the other videos
[26:38] in the Book of Genesis
[26:42] according to the plan of God acuerdo God
[26:47] had in his mind how this family tree
[26:50] would come
[26:54] and how that each person in this family
[26:57] tree is
[27:02] eternal life
[27:03] would never die
[27:07] can you imagine say mahina if your
[27:10] family
[27:11] would never die
[27:14] just think about it now before I go a
[27:18] little more into that I want to go to
[27:20] one final scripture
[27:26] in Revelation 1 5 apocalypses Uno Cinco
[27:31] man
[27:32] as you can see I'm doing a turtle walk
[27:35] tonight
[27:37] because
[27:41] to me this is delicate very delicate to
[27:44] what we're going into
[27:46] is
[27:55] there how many will pray for me
[28:02] amen praise the Lord man and from Jesus
[28:05] Christ who is the faithful Witness
[28:08] and the first begotten of the Dead
[28:12] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[28:15] unto him that loved us and washed us
[28:18] from our sins and his own blood
[28:23] either has a crystal test
[28:34] now notice here it uses not the
[28:37] expression born from the dead
[28:43] Muertos
[28:48] born from the dead
[28:50] first born from the dead
[28:54] it uses the expression the firstborn of
[28:59] the dead he said
[29:02] how could he be dead
[29:06] what death is it talking about right
[29:08] here
[29:10] it's not talking just about a natural
[29:13] death
[29:15] but he was the firstborn of the dead
[29:20] because he took our penalty
[29:25] upon himself
[29:28] and the death that was dominating our
[29:32] life
[29:34] the spiritual death la muerte so he had
[29:38] to take upon him the death of
[29:42] our Disobedience
[29:45] just to start but
[29:48] now
[29:50] I want to ask you a few questions
[29:54] I want to see if you can follow me in
[29:57] this okay
[30:00] what was one of the most important New
[30:03] Year's messages that brother Brennan
[30:06] ever preached
[30:08] important
[30:11] that's a very general statement he
[30:14] preached a lot of them right declaration
[30:18] well I'll give you a hint
[30:21] that's what she said
[30:24] and I always wanted to be loved
[30:32] huh no well
[30:36] one more hint um
[30:40] it was a message that he used the
[30:43] opening scripture of Ephesians 4
[30:47] 11-13 that is that helps
[30:54] it was just opening scripture huh
[31:00] you must be born again
[31:04] could you put up that quote from you
[31:06] must be born again
[31:09] because if we're going to talk about
[31:11] God's family God's family tree
[31:16] it's got to be a family that's so in
[31:19] love with God
[31:25] and one another
[31:33] amen that's why I'm doing what I'm doing
[31:38] let's read it here
[31:40] and I've always wanted to be loved
[31:44] when I was a little boy
[31:46] I wasn't locked by nobody in my career
[31:49] nobody had use for me
[31:53] here in Indiana born in Kentucky in
[31:56] Indiana in Kentucky I'm gonna skip down
[32:00] a little bit
[32:01] and I was in Off cast in the family
[32:06] an offcast in school
[32:11] at work I was in Off cast
[32:18] and then finally when I found somebody
[32:22] that really loved me it is
[32:27] Jesus Jesus he said I'll give you
[32:32] fathers
[32:34] and brothers and
[32:38] Friends The Amigos
[32:41] well we're talking about God's family
[32:42] tree right
[32:46] because he is the first born
[32:49] from the dead Entre los Muertos
[32:53] and as we read there in Colossians why
[32:54] was he the first born from the dead
[32:58] that he might have the preeminence
[33:05] amen amen
[33:07] now
[33:09] I remember how many remember Sunday
[33:13] the quote where brother Brennan said
[33:17] that cane should have been the first
[33:20] born
[33:24] amen see
[33:26] amen also Esau should have been the
[33:29] firstborn the man is
[33:32] and I'm sure the majority of you heard
[33:35] what I said
[33:37] because Caleb said you're scared
[33:41] not me but you don't know amigo no I
[33:44] disagree
[33:46] and it's not that I disagreed
[33:50] but I was seeing what I'm bringing
[33:53] tonight
[33:55] but he preached last
[33:59] first and I said no wait
[34:25] but according to the place
[34:30] you know this
[34:32] they should have been the firstborn
[34:35] to open the womb
[34:38] you know I think Satan was kind of
[34:41] surprised
[34:44] why did God Institute this law of the
[34:48] birthright and the firstborn is
[34:55] and the birth rate is
[34:59] why would he Institute that after what I
[35:02] did in the Garden of Eden for Kansas
[35:05] City
[35:09] notice that law was not instituted
[35:14] after what happened after this
[35:27] his first born
[35:29] but not the first born
[35:36] amen oh
[35:39] so who was or who should have been the
[35:43] firstborn
[35:46] uh
[35:48] in the Book of Genesis in the liberal of
[35:51] the Hennessy
[35:52] yeah I'll see if I get any
[35:56] versier everybody okay
[35:59] how many would like to know
[36:03] it's it's in the word it's in the
[36:06] message
[36:07] but before we do that let's do this and
[36:10] this is talking about our families and
[36:13] how much we love our families of London
[36:15] Familia
[36:17] you men you love your wives like
[36:21] esposas you would do anything
[36:25] why you love her so much you would never
[36:28] hurt her
[36:32] you would do anything for your children
[36:36] and maybe if you're the father that just
[36:39] has one son
[36:43] and you're so interested that that son
[36:47] grows up to be the right kind of a man
[36:54] that he comes to find out that he's a
[36:57] Son of God
[36:59] and your daughters you love them so much
[37:03] because expression
[37:14] we love them so much
[37:16] and that father that has only one son
[37:19] yes
[37:20] he knows that the only way
[37:23] tree will contain ERS
[37:31] chooses the right
[37:33] woman or a wife
[37:38] and then his family tree will continue
[37:46] now how many of you then would consider
[37:48] how do you think that God feels then
[37:55] about his family they're so familiar
[37:59] doesn't he want the very best for us
[38:02] I know just as simple I wanted to stay
[38:05] simple because it's gonna yeah use your
[38:09] goggles and you we might have to jump in
[38:11] a little bit
[38:15] how many how many would like to to take
[38:18] a dive in the ocean God's love amen
[38:25] so God's family tree
[38:29] now let's go to Ephesians chapter three
[38:38] verses 17 through 21.
[38:43] and we all are say Amen to this with
[38:46] everything with God
[38:51] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[38:53] faith
[38:56] how is Christ gonna dwell in Your Heart
[39:00] by Revelation
[39:03] it's not just going to visit there
[39:07] he's going to dwell there
[39:09] if you have faith or revelation amen
[39:22] yes
[39:25] the same scripture that
[39:28] ye being rooted and grounded in love
[39:32] it says
[39:42] may be able to comprehend what All
[39:45] Saints what is the breadth the length
[39:48] and depth and height
[39:51] is
[39:58] oh my oh yeah this is not just anything
[40:02] and to know the love of Christ
[40:10] what
[40:14] is
[40:15] that you might be filled with all the
[40:18] fullness of God
[40:23] now unto him that is able to do
[40:26] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[40:28] ask or think according to the power
[40:31] that's out in the universe somewhere
[40:34] yeah
[40:42] can you give me the diverse back
[40:44] Brothers
[40:46] now to him that is able to exceedingly
[40:49] abundantly
[40:51] above all give all that we ask or think
[40:54] according to the power that worketh in
[40:57] us
[41:06] and to him be glory in the church by
[41:10] Christ Jesus throughout all ages
[41:17] world without endos amen amen oh we see
[41:23] here then Paul catches a glimpse
[41:27] and it's not just seeing the church of
[41:30] his time he knows
[41:33] he's not seeing the sons of butter Sons
[41:36] and Daughters of God of only the Church
[41:37] of Baptists
[41:41] the Church of God
[41:47] and what he sees this church of all ages
[41:57] in pain
[41:59] wow I believe he was seeing
[42:04] what should have happened
[42:07] in the Book of Genesis
[42:10] and now we're going to start getting in
[42:13] a little bit are you ready ready pins
[42:15] ready
[42:17] this was not us message ready
[42:21] God spoken word is the Original Seed
[42:24] paragraph 188
[42:27] Regional
[42:28] amen
[42:33] now watch this
[42:35] now notice now in this God foresaw
[42:41] it's cutting it off
[42:44] a predestinated world full of Sons and
[42:47] Daughters of God
[42:51] he predestinated them to be there
[42:55] but because of hybriding
[43:00] just believe in God's word is
[43:06] God has to put it right back again
[43:12] that you don't have to be a hybrid
[43:14] anymore
[43:18] you can come right back
[43:21] to the original word and be a Son of God
[43:24] just the way you were supposed to be at
[43:28] the beginning
[43:36] studied this yet this is a little greek
[43:39] for you
[43:42] but if you go study the message God's
[43:45] spoken word is the original series
[43:50] he did that in his first setting when he
[43:53] said you see the message
[43:57] when he barely accepted the message
[44:00] he saw that book in my little shelf
[44:03] there that I had in the garage
[44:06] well could I have that
[44:11] why sure brother
[44:14] well if you don't like it make sure you
[44:15] bring it back but if you like it you can
[44:17] keep it you know
[44:21] six hours a message at one time
[44:26] I guess he was a little bit hungry
[44:29] are you hungry for the word of God
[44:32] or has the word of God become a common
[44:34] thing
[44:36] we're so used to seeing God do so many
[44:39] things
[44:41] foreign
[44:57] amen amen
[45:00] so see God saw this world full of Sons
[45:03] and Daughters of God yes
[45:09] but because of the hybriding of his word
[45:12] the disbelieving of his words
[45:18] that perfect family tree never formed
[45:23] and Genesis
[45:29] Satan interrupted the program
[45:33] brother
[45:38] he said the whole thing Shattered
[45:42] by disbelieving foreign
[45:48] he goes now what happened
[45:50] God had a perfect law yes
[45:54] in the beginning he said the way you
[45:57] should have been here in the beginning
[46:01] but why you should have been here
[46:05] why was that beginning
[46:08] in the beginning
[46:15] that would bring the birth
[46:18] but the truth Sons and Daughters of God
[46:22] and now we can see Moses
[46:25] and all the prophets
[46:28] they're looking back to Genesis true
[46:36] and they can see what happened there
[46:39] they can see how the enemy deceived Eve
[46:42] foreign
[47:16] would not destroy him
[47:18] but he knew that God could
[47:21] hurt
[47:23] oh he entered
[47:28] the blame himself
[47:30] how many of us are willing to take the
[47:33] blame
[47:34] what our ugly family situation arises
[47:41] I'm right and you're wrong
[47:47] I'm right and you're wrong
[47:56] you know
[47:58] I would rather be wrong
[48:01] don't want to be wrong necessarily
[48:05] but I would rather be wrong but
[48:08] the opportunity
[48:22] yeah we're talking about God's family
[48:26] trees
[48:30] I can remember when I first married my
[48:32] wife
[48:36] one day I told her
[48:38] I've always been a weird guy
[48:43] I don't know how to say weird in Spanish
[48:46] and
[48:51] I told her you know one of these days
[48:53] honey
[48:58] you're gonna realize that God's family
[49:01] was uh
[49:04] is more family is Mas Familia than
[49:08] family okay Familia
[49:12] no I'm not saying no if your family is
[49:14] in the message in the word but man you
[49:17] are blessed is
[49:26] I have my parents Padres I have cousins
[49:29] single Primos just like all of you
[49:32] and I've shared the message with many of
[49:35] them
[49:37] and I'm the only one that believes
[49:41] so I was kind of like I'm not cast in my
[49:45] own family um
[49:48] when I accepted this message and stood
[49:50] for it
[49:53] I lost everything that was dear to me in
[49:57] this life
[49:59] I was down
[50:08] like nobody
[50:10] is
[50:13] had such an inferiority complexion
[50:22] anybody think that you're inferior too
[50:28] well you know what a lot of people have
[50:29] a superiority complex Superior
[50:35] anybody
[50:37] oh no response no no I can't not
[50:40] consistent
[50:41] amen man I don't really think in our
[50:45] heart we feel that way
[50:47] but sometimes when we turn our backs on
[50:50] one another
[50:52] and sometimes maybe we see a brother or
[50:55] sister make a mistake
[51:01] I don't want to get dirty
[51:07] that's not the love that's in God's
[51:10] family noises
[51:15] are you ready I got you on suspenders
[51:21] suspenders penguin suspense so who
[51:24] should have been that firstborn son
[51:30] let's go to god-spoken word the original
[51:32] see original
[51:36] paragraph 134.
[51:43] and now there's some rock language here
[51:45] Hospital
[51:51] but it's God speaking through His
[51:53] prophets
[51:55] in no way any disrespect to any of our
[51:58] sisters
[52:03] you remember there's a difference
[52:05] between a lady and just a plain wolf
[52:11] and you my precious sisters
[52:17] so as we read this foreign
[52:31] is this paragraph 134 or 34.
[52:42] and that's not even
[52:46] okay let's see if they can get this
[52:47] straightened out yeah
[52:51] so you weren't ahead at Market
[52:55] you want the 188
[52:58] paragraph 134 yes
[53:03] can you go down further
[53:05] well if I got the wrong one for them I'm
[53:08] sorry guys
[53:10] I'm just gonna quote to you do you have
[53:12] it which one is it
[53:15] oh yeah that's this is this paragraph
[53:18] here is not 134 gentlemen
[53:20] thank you brother
[53:24] paragraph 134 you see what I mean
[53:30] it is the germ that comes from the sea
[53:33] is
[53:35] he is he is the word of God made
[53:39] perfectly manifest is
[53:45] that's the reason that in him was
[53:49] okay that was the thing that is
[53:53] now listen
[53:55] he is correctly the son from the first
[53:59] Adam
[54:02] was the son that was promised through
[54:05] Adam
[54:08] continue on the human race
[54:14] Jesus
[54:17] was the son of the first Adam Jesus
[54:22] Promised through Adam
[54:25] so that tells me this is
[54:27] Adam as the Son of God as
[54:31] a little God on Earth
[54:34] he had already spoken the word
[54:38] that would have produced the word child
[54:41] he even proceed
[54:46] so Jesus then in Princess Jesus truly
[54:49] what a band of yellow
[54:51] the firstborn El primogenito of the
[54:55] human race De La Raza Salman it could
[54:57] not been able because Abel came under a
[55:01] pervasive Covenant after the fall well
[55:06] God's plan for his family
[55:15] was gonna be born
[55:18] now let's continue
[55:23] he continue on the human race
[55:35] and brought forth a generation I know
[55:38] these words were up a bastard children
[55:45] without life
[55:48] and Jesus comes
[55:50] and what's that see if he proved it
[55:55] everything that Adam lost
[55:58] Jesus was estaban Jesus
[56:01] he is the correct
[56:03] now watch this
[56:06] Eve what a funny brought that child
[56:10] forth Eva finalment
[56:14] but she hybrided it
[56:20] the serpent
[56:22] listening to wisdom understanding enough
[56:28] no wonder
[56:30] Lucifer was so interested in the
[56:33] firstborn
[56:36] let me ask you some more questions
[56:41] almost 30 minutes I'm doing good so far
[56:45] if Jesus would have been the first son
[56:48] born
[56:52] would that our blood in stained
[56:58] what a deaf interlins by the blood
[57:05] would there ever have been a family
[57:08] fight
[57:11] would there ever been an argument
[57:13] between the husband and wife and the
[57:15] children arguments
[57:18] everything would have been perfect
[57:21] everything would have been in harmony
[57:24] that would be such a love oh yeah we are
[57:27] una more and notice it was to continue
[57:31] on the human race
[57:38] look you're insulting our intelligence
[57:41] my name is
[57:46] I'm trying to get you to think
[57:48] if he was to continue on the human race
[57:52] the blood that flowed in his veins
[58:04] Familia
[58:10] but we can't see it that way
[58:16] you say in Spanish
[58:23] oh my family is better than yours
[58:32] somebody's in the God's family is better
[58:34] than somebody else
[58:38] maybe I'm just too simple
[58:41] we would literally be belated
[58:46] and I've always said this is and I'll
[58:50] say it again because the Holy Spirit
[58:54] baptize me into the bodies
[58:58] and placed me exactly where I should
[59:01] have been in the beginning
[59:05] so I feel right at home
[59:08] you're my brother and sisters
[59:11] Blood Brothers
[59:17] well they dance up a storm
[59:22] come on
[59:25] they are literally related
[59:29] I'm not related to you know I'm not a
[59:33] German I'm not Dutch I'm not polish
[59:37] polish I'm not French
[59:41] nothing a Cherokee Indian In Me
[59:48] what race are your brothers
[59:51] Heinz 57 varieties
[59:56] 57.
[59:58] but inside of me
[1:00:01] there is a seed
[1:00:03] from the beginning
[1:00:08] so when I see you I see myself
[1:00:12] you don't make it
[1:00:16] if I believe I can make it
[1:00:19] you can believe
[1:00:22] and if I can't believe that is
[1:00:29] getting a little
[1:00:43] whatever happened to that word
[1:00:46] paragraphs 177.
[1:00:52] go back to 177 please it was this 178
[1:00:56] well yeah that's 178 is fine
[1:01:00] finally this word
[1:01:03] cut into the womb of our words
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:38] that it didn't find no place to land no
[1:01:43] in control
[1:01:44] when I got to eat what's her name was it
[1:01:49] yet
[1:01:51] she wasn't the mother of all living yeah
[1:02:04] no place to dwell no in control
[1:02:07] they have to travel for 2000 years
[1:02:19] yeah and what you see happen with Mary
[1:02:22] and Joseph
[1:02:25] only shows you what would have happened
[1:02:28] in the Book of Genesis
[1:02:37] and the good tidies came to her it was
[1:02:41] when us
[1:02:43] you are very greatly favored it is
[1:02:54] oh how am I gonna have this son
[1:02:58] oh the spirit of almighty God
[1:03:05] what will be born foreign
[1:04:51] he was born through the womb of a woman
[1:04:56] because his Spirit had to come be a
[1:04:59] witness
[1:05:02] what was he witnessed
[1:05:05] he would witness the Virgin birth
[1:05:10] he wouldn't witness the Immaculate
[1:05:13] Conception this uh immaculada
[1:05:19] he was witness to the stegos of the
[1:05:23] birth
[1:05:24] that he should have had well
[1:05:27] penis
[1:05:32] what about you and me yeah you steady me
[1:05:35] are we the Virgin Bride of the Lord
[1:05:37] Jesus
[1:05:40] do we believe God's words
[1:05:44] Corazon
[1:05:49] Satan was really compounding
[1:05:55] because he finally realized
[1:05:59] all these people that are so full of the
[1:06:03] devil a lot of them were first born
[1:06:09] they were born first and their whole
[1:06:12] family is
[1:06:18] so you were gonna Ascend upon the high
[1:06:21] uh you would have sent to the Mountain
[1:06:24] of God
[1:06:31] now you'll be cast down
[1:06:34] here now you will be cast down to the
[1:06:37] Earth
[1:06:38] because God's had something else going
[1:06:41] I'll go for this we've got to go to the
[1:06:46] world preeminence foreign
[1:07:01] amen Colossians 1.
[1:07:09] in English verse verse 15.
[1:07:15] who is the image of the invisible God is
[1:07:19] invisible
[1:07:21] the firstborn a very creature
[1:07:23] I'm not going to even touch that I kind
[1:07:27] of got a feeling our pastor still might
[1:07:29] have something on that yeah
[1:07:37] I think I'll just leave that one alone
[1:07:45] look yes
[1:07:47] foreign
[1:07:51] I'm just being your brother I'm not
[1:07:53] trying to be no
[1:07:54] um
[1:07:58] no no for by him were all things created
[1:08:02] that are in heaven that are in the Earth
[1:08:11] visible invisible whether they be
[1:08:12] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:08:15] or Powers all things were created by Him
[1:08:18] and for him
[1:08:24] and he is before all things
[1:08:27] that should tell you right there that
[1:08:31] he's the first of all creatures
[1:08:34] and by him all things consistent
[1:08:39] next verse and he is the head of the
[1:08:42] body
[1:08:45] people say well he's my head
[1:08:48] nobody to tell me what to do
[1:08:53] no you don't understand the body is
[1:08:57] you know well I can just receive
[1:09:01] so-and-so but I can't receive this other
[1:09:03] brother the place
[1:09:06] and then it comes time to the Lord's
[1:09:08] supper and in First Corinthians 11 says
[1:09:17] that many
[1:09:19] are asleep
[1:09:22] which means they've actually gone on
[1:09:27] there is
[1:09:32] because they discern not the head
[1:09:37] they don't discern the body
[1:09:43] but the reason we're going to come to
[1:09:45] partake of the Lord's Supper
[1:09:46] participants
[1:09:52] is because we are participating of the
[1:09:55] revelation of this world
[1:09:59] the revelation of the blood
[1:10:02] the Holy Spirit
[1:10:04] came out of that blood yes
[1:10:09] death that bread made by Christian hands
[1:10:13] is
[1:10:21] that I can discern
[1:10:24] that my brother my sister
[1:10:27] of the body is
[1:10:31] I can discern that this is part of God's
[1:10:35] family tree well this is
[1:10:39] the first born from the dead
[1:10:43] that in all things he might have the
[1:10:46] preeminence
[1:10:48] Give me the definition of three minutes
[1:10:50] again real quick and we're going to be
[1:10:52] done definition
[1:10:54] Supremo
[1:11:07] dignity or importance
[1:11:11] Supreme
[1:11:13] outstanding sobre saliente and do you
[1:11:16] have the word Paramount there it is
[1:11:19] Superior to all others
[1:11:24] as we heard Sunday
[1:11:27] that firstborn wasn't just talking about
[1:11:30] the first one that opened the womb is
[1:11:35] he was talking about a
[1:11:38] ranko but I wasn't just talking about
[1:11:40] any brain
[1:11:42] it was the Lord himself
[1:11:53] the one that's most outstanding
[1:11:57] give me that last quote out of Christ is
[1:12:00] the mystery of God revealed
[1:12:03] and Christianity
[1:12:10] there's much more that can be said
[1:12:13] he have understood a little bit
[1:12:16] how many know that through Redemption
[1:12:18] and restoration
[1:12:21] restoration because you're predestinated
[1:12:26] it takes you back
[1:12:29] to where you would be destinated
[1:12:36] that you can find out
[1:12:38] what part of God's family tree
[1:12:45] and the only way he could have their
[1:12:47] preeminence
[1:12:49] it would have to be the first born from
[1:13:05] and
[1:13:14] say this together
[1:13:17] and make it personal personal
[1:13:20] and through that purpose
[1:13:25] foreign
[1:13:28] Church
[1:13:30] yo
[1:13:33] that he the fullness of God
[1:13:37] might bring to pass every promised word

[1:13:44] when he gets the preeminances
[1:13:50] preeminence in the church
