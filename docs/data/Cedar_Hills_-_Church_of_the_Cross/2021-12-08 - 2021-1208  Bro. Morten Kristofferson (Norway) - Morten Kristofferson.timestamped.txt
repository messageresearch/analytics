[46:33] so
[46:35] and i also want to thank my brother
[46:38] henry hello aggressive
[46:40] henry who
[46:43] you know
[46:46] a preacher without a good interpreter
[46:49] he's like
[46:50] [Music]
[46:53] so as you heard my my
[46:56] english
[46:58] is not my modern language
[47:03] so please uh
[47:05] bear over with me consider me thinking
[47:08] i try my best
[47:19] so
[47:21] please turn with me
[47:28] to
[47:32] the book of genesis chapter 12. the
[47:34] liberal of the hennessey's
[47:52] we will read from from verse 1
[47:58] rewards verse 4 and verse 2
[48:03] jesus name
[48:17] now
[48:18] the lord has said
[48:20] had said unto abraham
[48:23] get the oath of thy country and from thy
[48:26] kingdom and from my father's house
[48:30] and to a land that i will
[48:42] and i will make of thee a great nation
[48:46] and i will bless thee
[48:48] and make thy name great
[48:50] and though shall be a blessing
[49:00] and i will bless them that bless thee
[49:03] and curse him that cursed thee and
[49:06] indeed shall all families of the earth
[49:08] be blessed
[49:14] familiar
[49:16] so abram departed as the lord had spoken
[49:20] unto him
[49:21] and not went with him and abraham was
[49:24] 75 years old when he departed out of
[49:27] haran
[49:54] [Music]
[50:23] well
[50:25] it must have been a really special
[50:28] experience
[50:32] when the lord starts speaking to abraham
[50:37] and he tells abraham to to leave his
[50:41] country
[50:46] and he
[50:48] he said that he would make
[50:51] him a great nation
[51:00] i believe
[51:02] that abraham he had a great expectation
[51:20] and i have great expectations
[51:23] grand expectations
[51:26] and expectation
[51:28] expectativa is very important
[51:34] because in
[51:38] for the lord to be able
[51:40] to give something
[51:43] to me
[51:46] we must have expectations
[51:57] but the question is
[52:31] actually everything
[52:34] and that
[52:36] that's very often
[52:38] very difficult for you and me yes
[52:44] when we have
[53:06] and that's the reality
[53:08] is
[53:09] in the walk with the lord in the caminar
[53:12] el senor if we want something from the
[53:14] lord
[53:16] there is a prize to pay i impress you
[53:19] okay
[53:20] and the question is
[53:22] am i willing
[53:25] to
[53:41] and that was the greatest prize ever
[53:43] yeah
[53:46] and he had to pay that price in order to
[53:50] redeem you and me
[54:08] so the lord he called abraham
[54:11] but he also called you and me
[54:16] to get out of our
[54:18] country
[54:21] and our own things then
[54:26] to get out of our own kind of kingdom
[54:32] in order to enter god's kingdom
[54:42] let's go to genesis chapter 15.
[54:47] verse 1 through 3 verse
[54:57] this is some time later
[55:01] day
[55:06] after these things the word of the lord
[55:08] came unto abraham in a vision saying
[55:12] hear not abraham
[55:14] i am thy shield and thy
[55:18] exceeding great reward
[55:30] grande
[55:50] and abraham said
[55:53] lord god
[55:54] what will thou give me
[55:58] seeing i go silence
[56:00] and the steward of my house
[56:03] is this eliezer of damascus
[56:14] yes and
[56:17] abraham said
[56:19] behold
[56:20] to me though has given no seed
[56:24] and lo
[56:26] one
[56:27] born in my house
[56:50] that
[56:52] and to ask the lord in the padilla senor
[56:55] what will you give me
[57:10] possible
[57:14] when he received that great promise
[57:24] it seems like
[57:27] abraham kind of
[57:30] was losing his wisdom
[57:37] to
[57:39] his reason yeah
[57:41] because without a wisdom the people will
[57:44] perish you know
[57:53] so he started
[57:56] with a kind of uh
[57:59] confession
[58:03] that you haven't given me any see
[58:39] and in that condition
[58:41] condition it's so easy to
[58:44] get influenced by other kinds of spirits
[58:53] because the satan himself
[58:57] he can make himself like an angel
[59:03] that's the reason
[59:05] we must keep the vision fresh
[59:12] but the question is how to do that
[59:17] it is by leaving our own kingdom
[59:22] it's by leaving the handle
[59:26] and stay in god's kingdom
[59:30] be a heavenly places
[59:35] not once a week no now
[59:39] not that every con winston
[59:42] but no not at every convention
[59:57] we must hit ourselves
[1:00:12] you see abraham he still had some kind
[1:00:16] of
[1:00:18] some kind of expectation
[1:00:24] but it was
[1:00:26] on the wrong basis
[1:00:29] because he started
[1:00:31] forgetting about the promise episode
[1:00:35] and if we forget the promise he says
[1:00:40] our expectations will be on the wrong
[1:00:43] basis
[1:00:49] we will have wrong kind of
[1:00:52] expectations of each other then that
[1:01:09] um
[1:01:11] my brother also
[1:01:13] or the brothers
[1:01:15] and uh sister was nice to pick me up at
[1:01:17] the airports
[1:01:32] have a little house
[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:38] so they brought me there
[1:01:43] or actually i i stayed there but the
[1:01:46] first night i stayed at the hotel
[1:01:50] in the morning in la manana
[1:01:52] about half past six
[1:01:55] media i was so hungry
[1:01:58] so i went down to find some breakfast
[1:02:01] but you know the breakfast was a little
[1:02:03] bit too light for
[1:02:23] and
[1:02:24] there it popped up
[1:02:27] it was called cracker barrel cracker
[1:02:29] barrel
[1:02:31] 90 meters away
[1:02:46] and um what do you call this stuff
[1:02:50] that's probably brandon my grave
[1:02:52] biscuits and gravy gravy gravy
[1:02:54] caribbean biscuits there you go orange
[1:02:57] juice
[1:03:00] and three cups of hot coffee
[1:03:05] black coffee
[1:03:06] negro no sugar tina sucker no cream
[1:03:09] crema
[1:03:11] i enjoyed my time
[1:03:29] have a phone call for from the brothers
[1:03:35] because we need to talk
[1:03:37] so i'm i i can't wait
[1:03:41] i want to talk to the brothers
[1:03:51] well the day after i
[1:03:54] i went i
[1:03:56] i moved from the hotel
[1:04:02] with the hotel a la casita
[1:04:05] well i spent some time
[1:04:08] in the casita
[1:04:10] and i was
[1:04:49] in the afternoon i
[1:04:52] i made my way to a hamburger restaurant
[1:04:58] and as a champion
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:04] i started praying
[1:05:07] and then the lord started
[1:05:09] speaking to me
[1:05:12] he told me
[1:05:16] you have the right kind of expectation
[1:05:19] in his life
[1:05:27] because you are putting the expectation
[1:05:31] on the brothers
[1:05:35] but we are all humans
[1:05:39] and there is a
[1:05:41] limitation
[1:05:44] you know
[1:05:45] then
[1:05:47] and he told me
[1:06:12] because
[1:06:13] maybe some brothers some sisters
[1:06:25] that was a good lesson for me
[1:06:28] because the lord taught me
[1:06:40] because that's the only way is
[1:06:44] i
[1:07:17] so
[1:07:19] now aura
[1:07:21] we've been enjoying great time together
[1:07:25] young
[1:07:41] so
[1:07:44] as long as our expectation is based on
[1:07:46] human flesh
[1:07:50] we will be disappointed every day
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:09] wow but he was not aware one very
[1:08:12] important thing
[1:08:15] he had a seed inside
[1:08:20] and that seed was
[1:08:49] because the seed is there
[1:09:03] in the sermon
[1:09:05] the patriarch
[1:09:07] abraham
[1:09:08] patriarch abraham from 1964.
[1:09:12] he says then one day
[1:09:16] alone came the royal seed of abraham
[1:09:21] jesus christ jesus christ the son of god
[1:09:25] abraham's seed that's meant to be
[1:09:27] abraham
[1:09:29] not through isaac not religious
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:41] he you know
[1:10:42] he is the aiming corner
[1:10:48] yeah
[1:10:50] when when watching on youtube
[1:10:53] i i heard it
[1:11:08] amen amen
[1:11:12] so
[1:11:13] let's go to genesis
[1:11:15] 18 vamos a genesis dieseocho times go by
[1:11:19] you know
[1:11:22] where's one
[1:11:24] person
[1:11:31] and the lord
[1:11:32] appeared unto him in the plains of
[1:11:34] memory and he sat in the tent
[1:11:38] in the tenth door
[1:11:39] in the heat of the day
[1:11:49] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[1:11:52] low three men stood by him
[1:11:55] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[1:11:59] from the tenth door
[1:12:01] and bowed himself toward the ground
[1:12:13] and said my lord
[1:12:16] if now i have found favor in thy sight
[1:12:21] pass not the way i pray thee
[1:12:24] from vice servants
[1:12:33] that was something different
[1:12:37] it was
[1:12:38] not about you haven't given me any seeds
[1:12:46] you don't hear my prayers
[1:13:02] hey
[1:13:16] what was he looking at okay
[1:13:22] because
[1:13:23] porky
[1:13:24] wherever we sit
[1:13:27] we are looking at something
[1:13:30] wherever
[1:13:43] and this is very important
[1:13:45] it's very important because
[1:13:48] abraham he was
[1:13:49] up in the mountains
[1:13:56] he was also sitting
[1:13:58] in
[1:14:13] by
[1:14:14] keeping up with the life in the city
[1:14:20] because he was the major in the city
[1:14:24] he was a judge
[1:14:46] so he had to
[1:14:47] update himself all the time about things
[1:14:51] happening
[1:14:55] exactly that most people are doing it
[1:15:01] they are spending hours and hours and
[1:15:04] hours just
[1:15:06] looking at miranda
[1:15:23] it is endless
[1:15:24] it's infeeding of opportunities
[1:15:28] and the devil keeps people busy
[1:15:31] around the clock
[1:15:36] and even
[1:15:38] believers
[1:15:41] because there there's so many
[1:15:43] interesting things
[1:15:46] and we are receiving messages and we
[1:15:48] have to send messages
[1:16:04] faster and
[1:16:16] i don't think
[1:16:18] abraham had
[1:16:31] he was busy with that all the time
[1:16:35] but you may
[1:16:36] you may say that well i saw you brother
[1:16:39] martin you also had an ipad oh
[1:16:41] man
[1:16:43] that's right
[1:16:46] this is the tree of knowledge
[1:16:54] so i could throw away
[1:16:56] my ipad
[1:17:00] and sometimes
[1:17:30] that we can use them for the kids
[1:17:36] that i could sit in my kitchen in norway
[1:17:41] and receiving living water from a desert
[1:17:44] in mexico
[1:17:50] [Applause]
[1:17:57] if you told me that some few years ago
[1:18:03] i would rather call for those people
[1:18:05] with those
[1:18:06] white dresses you know
[1:18:24] i'm so blessed
[1:18:27] that i take my dog
[1:18:32] and bring him with me up in the forest
[1:18:35] and i lose my dog
[1:18:37] so he can run as
[1:18:51] what god has blessed me with that
[1:18:54] morning
[1:18:58] and i'm busy with that for maybe the
[1:19:01] next two hours
[1:19:05] and the first thing i tell the lord
[1:19:08] every morning when i
[1:19:10] go to the forest
[1:19:14] thank you lord gracias for your mercy
[1:19:17] and grace
[1:19:19] that
[1:19:20] you are taking care of me
[1:19:23] in such a wonderful way
[1:19:27] that i can sit in my little house
[1:19:32] and receive a recipe
[1:19:36] naming water agua de vida from that
[1:19:40] desert in new mexico
[1:19:44] because there are brothers and sisters
[1:19:48] there are
[1:20:17] okay
[1:20:20] abraham
[1:20:21] abraham when he received the promise
[1:20:26] he was 75 years old
[1:20:45] on the right kind of basis
[1:20:50] for a while he tried very hard himself
[1:20:55] to fulfill god's promise for a complete
[1:20:58] promise
[1:21:07] he produced something according to the
[1:21:12] flesh you see ben
[1:21:17] and even up to this day there are
[1:21:21] great consequences
[1:21:24] consequences
[1:21:28] abraham he had a good intention
[1:21:32] but he came to a certain point
[1:21:37] where he got
[1:21:39] kind of impatient
[1:22:16] it's producing
[1:22:17] jesus christ within you and me
[1:22:23] and it's more power in this message
[1:22:31] you see
[1:22:33] brother branham said this is
[1:22:35] by that power
[1:22:42] amen amen
[1:22:48] abraham had to grow abram took christ
[1:23:18] and the day he was 100
[1:23:23] he was sitting there in the same tent
[1:23:30] [Applause]
[1:23:44] so three men were appearing
[1:24:07] amen amen
[1:24:10] in a fraction of a second
[1:24:13] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:24:17] he reacted to what he saw
[1:24:23] and he confessed
[1:24:25] my lord miss senor
[1:24:43] faith and building up our faith
[1:24:47] by the word of faith
[1:24:50] you see then
[1:24:51] every day
[1:24:53] if we put attention
[1:24:56] to other things
[1:25:03] [Music]
[1:25:09] so don't let that earthly kingdom
[1:25:12] disturb you
[1:25:16] don't feed yourself by this earthly
[1:25:19] kingdom
[1:25:22] feed yourself by the word of alimentary
[1:25:39] what is the rapture
[1:25:44] well
[1:25:46] we
[1:25:46] are expecting maybe the rapture
[1:25:50] being something that
[1:25:52] suddenly takes us
[1:26:20] i
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:48] closer
[1:27:22] and
[1:27:24] we are so easily getting
[1:27:27] conformed to
[1:27:29] all those past happening
[1:27:41] and that was the old-fashioned kind of
[1:27:44] photography
[1:27:59] a via a via ora pelicula i can tell you
[1:28:02] something
[1:28:07] one day
[1:28:09] the lord
[1:28:33] you see man
[1:28:35] when i took that picture
[1:28:38] i had to remove the film
[1:28:53] you know
[1:28:54] when
[1:29:08] foreign
[1:29:22] is
[1:29:24] potential free es
[1:29:27] potential with all the fruits
[1:29:31] and
[1:29:31] a lot of other trees
[1:29:34] the tons of fruit
[1:29:36] but in order
[1:29:38] to
[1:29:39] have all those
[1:29:41] trees with all that fruit manifested
[1:29:47] the seed must be put into darkness in
[1:29:50] the earth
[1:30:05] you know
[1:30:06] what we see here
[1:30:09] it's actually the negative
[1:30:11] negative
[1:30:18] that there when you see a shadow
[1:30:21] it tells you that there is something
[1:30:24] real
[1:30:27] that's right
[1:30:28] okay
[1:30:29] so when i take that film
[1:30:33] i go into a dark room
[1:30:38] i
[1:30:39] put the film into
[1:30:42] some
[1:30:45] chemistry yes
[1:30:50] and that chemistry is a chemical must
[1:30:53] hold a certain level of temperature
[1:30:59] and you have to keep it there for a
[1:31:00] certain
[1:31:14] but now you have to
[1:31:16] put the film into a certain kind of
[1:31:19] camera or a tire capacitor camera and
[1:31:22] you put the white
[1:31:24] paper
[1:31:25] under it
[1:31:28] and you turn on the lights
[1:31:32] and you are projecting light
[1:31:37] through the negative
[1:31:38] negative and through the white paper
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:57] but you must believe
[1:32:00] how many times brothers and sisters what
[1:32:03] does this mean
[1:32:04] when we don't see things
[1:32:10] we
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:37] and then you must watch it
[1:32:50] and when you finish that process
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:48] things
[1:34:14] what was he looking at a camera
[1:34:26] he was in the same process
[1:34:29] the lord
[1:34:30] had
[1:34:44] it actually took 25 years
[1:34:51] we are doing things faster and faster
[1:34:53] and faster and faster
[1:34:56] but there is one thing
[1:35:08] and the food is getting inside you la
[1:35:10] comida entrance
[1:35:13] it has to go through a process
[1:35:19] in order to to give you strength and
[1:35:22] power in order
[1:35:26] that no matter how
[1:35:28] fast this world goes
[1:35:32] that process takes exactly the same time
[1:35:35] when you eat your dinner
[1:35:40] that's when abraham had his dinner
[1:35:46] it doesn't go any faster
[1:35:52] this is god's time
[1:36:11] we
[1:36:12] must not skip the process
[1:36:17] we must not go digital not the vermouth
[1:36:22] it must
[1:37:15] we should be able
[1:37:17] to lift our
[1:37:31] yes
[1:38:26] and satan can see that there is a
[1:38:28] process
[1:38:40] which is jesus christ yes
[1:38:43] god bless you brother
