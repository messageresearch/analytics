his word without further ado let's get into the word this morning and we greet each one of you that are on hookup this morning and those that are also that will see it later on god bless you hello amen we wanna that this will be all that the prophets have spoken number seven they don't like no confrontation people people will talk a lot right when they're by themselves or with their families they get in front of the person scriptures that's all we see is showdown after showdown let's get into the word now luke 24 25. can you get one of those one of those is there one that that is the wireless or no no amen we want one of the youth to to read that elijah you want to try to read it for me and then one of the sisters whichever it is you can just pass it to the back there uh we're gonna if one of the sisters can get first kings chapter 18 verse 21. go ahead then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken holes and flow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken first kings 18 21 look at it go ahead and read it and elijah came unto all the people and said how long helped be between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and that people answered not a word amen may the lord add his blessings to the reading i want you to put up the definition of the word showdown if you would a showdown is a a conclusive settlement of an issue or a difference once again a conclusive settlement yes once again a settlement a conclusive settlement of an issue or difference in which all resources power or the like are used a decisive confrontation amen now as we read the scriptures once again we find very many showdowns that occurred in the bible as children we always remember the showdown of david and goliath is that just the story or did it really happen the real really happened brothers okay we want to make sure that we we know it really happened and when we read this and through the scriptures we want to make mention this morning of of three uh three main or major showdown and i want to start by reading in the message the spoken word is the original seed and brother brahm says this so it's at this time in this country that that person will appear for it's in the scripture fulfilled to the letter um wow i'm gonna say i gotta say that because i want these things to really as part of our foundation the mount carmel showdown and then he says the bible fulfilled to the letter biblia completa hasta la letra john the baptist his messenger before his face in malachi 3 in malacca and was rejected by the churches and by the denomination the pharisees and the sadducees of his days when he comes a showdown and then he says the rapture of his bride huh and then he goes you see the first was mount carmel el primero monte carlo the second was mount transfiguration third showdown will be somebody help me yeah i want a young person too is proud of me on that one hey man anybody want to answer the last one will be anybody mount zion okay so we got three showdowns here the mount carmel showdown write that down if you're writing notes and i'm going to say it again these three showdowns is to settle an issue or difference i i start then with this first showdown and and i'm just i'm not going to go into a lot of depth about you you all know the stories no we have and we find that uh the the prophet which we know is uh was elijah during that time and he's standing against 450 profits of bill when we try to transport ourselves there and kind of see what's going on you see the people's minds had been perverted and it was perverted by what was permitted to come into the country perverts we become perverted by many times what's permitted into the church so there is then always a showdown because we many times we are not holding up the standard of the word we know the story andrea had married an unbeliever named jezebel she had brought in with her the worship of of of all these strange gods and he had permitted this idolatry to come into israel and the condition of the people was a divided mind that was producing two opinions i want to say that again because there is something that is so good here the condition of the people was a divided mind reducing our minds are quickly this oh i says oh well let me show you a different way let me show you something different let me show you something better how many of you young people you you ever experienced that with with someone out there oh no okay yeah there's a lot now how about you your parents and ikelos everywhere you go there's a showdown right now nowadays there's a showdown just to find a parking space but it doesn't matter where you go there's a confrontation and there's a struggle all the time and here is what elijah is telling me or is telling them and description i want you to get this because this scripture it it didn't make too much sense to me i believe it you're like but it didn't make a whole lot of sense to me nothing's wrong with the scripture but what is wrong is my perception or understanding of the scriptures but many times we don't we read something we don't we don't get it i didn't get this first kings that we read in 1821 it comes unto all the people and says how long halt ye between brother what what do you mean you don't get it easy it's fascinating you have two opinions those opinions the people's minds were divided but but watch what elijah is telling them and i'm going to give you six different versions of of of bibles you can really understand what's going on here the king james version says how long go ye limping between the next one how long will ye hesitate between two opinions the next one is how much longer will you try to have things both ways how long are you going to be paralyzed by indecision and i don't know what to do i don't know what to do and i read this scripture and i said lord i don't i i i understand what it's saying here but because as i read it it sounds like this sounds like the scripture is saying that there are two opinions for you to choose from if the lord be god then follow him that's one yes then follow him use you this day which opinion you're going to go with and that don't make sense to me yes it between god being that the lord being god has simply been an opinion to them so why are you going back and forth with these two opinions stop choosing or trying to choose between these two we're trying to to put this as an opinion almost an opinion don't do that no i got it how many are with me and this is what elijah's telling them and now he's saying if god be god then follow him watch watch as this unfolds because an opinion this is very important to understand the messages is that when you are wavering between two opinions why is the lord being god still an opinion just an opinion indecisive why are you halting between two opinions he's a prophet he's not a problem when somebody comes and tells you something and shows you something that they found on the internet as long is the beliefs yes or views of this of a large number or majority of people it's the belief how many believe that the bible is right there's a song that says i know the bible is right somebody is wrong i know the bible is right and somebody's wrong i don't told you once he has told you twice can't make it to heaven with a sweetheart and a wife i know the bible is right and somebody's wrong what has this an opinion is a belief an opinion or the views of a large or majority of people [Music] why aren't we basing our whole lives your opinions so opinions and our beliefs that are not based on god's word based on fact or knowledge you've seen me follow the majority of the people and not god how many have ever used that that phrase i always had everybody who seemed to be older than me you do it i'll do it i'm not talking oh nobody ever does that here the lord we don't have nobody i'm dealing with this with my family and it's like don't you don't you go and approach the lord about this pregnant and that's what elijah is saying why ho chi between two opinions show asking the whole world yeah here we go here we go now this is what we're we're getting to something hell why hold g between two opinions now he brings the word to the forefront and he says if the lord be god then follow him because if you see he says again now say that this morning if god be god then follow him this morning don't look to the right don't look to the left stay focused on the word comes for this the word is your belief based upon opinions or upon the eternal immovable infallible word of god imagine god of all creations imagine saying oh i wonder sometimes what he thinks look at all this oh the word is my absolutely why are we halting between two opinions that's right mayor with me this morning man come on now why are we halting between sometimes not two sometimes 10 or 12 or 20 years why are we stopping between those why are we paralyzed i don't know why no but nothing goes my way brother you don't know i'll tell you why you got too many opinions why don't you throw them all away and get serious when you halt between opinions you show that the word is not your absolute opinion and you're basing your whole life on opinions and opinions instead of on the word that's right i'm going to say it again until it becomes a revelation to you just an opinion and i go to that church your way i see listen yeah we believe this but it's so just your opinion of it you read the bible and you say i believe that yo it's just your opinion you read the message i believe that you're i don't know if brother branham is a prophet anymore opinions are things that have not been settled in you opinions they are not the ultimate and they can be changed or altered in a moment's time come on now i'm going to say this again church because i got to get you in this foundation [Music] how is it that we can be so on fire for the lord and we get out of service we don't see that we don't see eye to eye we don't lie and then we're sitting like this it's not each other are they following me by an opinion by revelation and i want to ask you that this morning you're going to follow just as long as you like the way things are in church we're always going to find things we just dislike and don't agree with and you're entitled to your opinion when it comes then the showdown begins he says now i'm coming to each one of you opinions of everybody else there's going to be a showdown whoever told you that you should deal with it this way it's against the word and then let's really see what's going on here [Music] let him and then it'll never be up for debate ever again behold i send you when somebody wants to come and tell me it's not so you're too late up against the concrete wonder we can't bring god on the scene who he is watch as we get into the message all right now we're now we're turning the corner into our message now the mount carmel showdown once again that god above us is it proves if something is an opinion it is an actual revolution when you come to a real showdown i'm going to say it again i think i'm part of the bride of jesus christ i think i'm going to make the rapture another opinion i think i think i think and that's the problem you have an opinion about it you're going to make it because it has been revealed to you through the word you'll be there the resurrection of the saints the bible is not a book of opinions word of god [Applause] now now watch this now the thing we're trying to drive home today is this just because we say the word is our absolute absolute doesn't necessarily mean it's true we can have a belief that is formed by our opinions rather than by revelation how many are with me all that i've said because we're gonna we're building up to something now okay real quick forward fast forward to the second showdown [Music] emmanuel god with us it's a showdown to prove what once again that it's god with us now no longer is god above that jesus was truly the virgin born son of god matthew 16 13. and we the last time we spoke everybody remember okay let let me have a quick quick question you ready you ready i'm watching you all right what city was known as the gates of hello what was that again that's right caesarea philippi that's right all right so good i'm glad you remembered that now he's here and we went over this and we this is so well known but watch as he's trying to get these disciples to you need to serve him by revelation so the first thing he does is say okay i know you've been hearing everybody else the lord knows these things i know you've been on over there here in tbn you see so many things i know you've been watching every preacher that's on youtube so answer me the question whom do men say that i the son of man i want to know what all the opinions are and so they start they give themselves away that they have been listening to everybody some say that thou art john the baptist jeremiah that's awesome i'll give you the keys for that one this rock confession was spoken at the gates of hell we see jesus and on you have moses the law there you have elijah after the translators you have a rehearsal of the resurrection going on what a showdown it's a preview of what's coming oh while he had spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son that's not an opinion why are we still trying to live back there why don't we live here right now this is my beloved son who i am pleased to i'm whom i am well please brother ram says please to dwell in yesterday you can you can as as they say we can repeat all that is the law and the prophets but watching in matthew 22 41 when the pharisees were gathered and jesus asked them what they think about something they were gathered um they said we got some we so you think because you read it you got it did you understand it okay how then does david in spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord and no man was able to answer there absolutely absolutely and we many times can we can repeat what the prophet says that doesn't make it or absolutely absolutely that's right we can have an opinion about it doesn't make it our absolutely no no no no we can fight it till we're blue in the face why because we like to pick and choose what is easy to live of the scriptures and they become our opinions in this form the bible is absolute it is the truth but the letter kills this is where we get into little nitty-gritty there huh because now everybody's like whoa how many have ever used that phrase the word is my absolutely everything i've said is to bring you and draw you into this now look at is are any of the prophets back there jesus fulfilled it all testament oh it's the word oh that's my absolutely we don't live in a past this dispensation that's the dispensation we are talking about watch as this those things are all right and you should do those things but the word doesn't become our absolute because of that as long as the word stays in letter form i'm going to say it again as long as the word stays in book form [Music] be your what is written is absolutely yes but the manifestation of this word is the producing of a person [Music] the logos and logos that's who is our god lord who art paul says i am jesus whoa what how can it be jesus when but he was living and looking in a past dispensation but when that person came on the scene showed himself his redemptive work he goes back to logos this is not an opinion anymore but he was persecuting the christians watch now if the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us the word now is a person when the person of the lord jesus comes yes but as long as it stays in letter form how many are with me now what is fine though you've had a lot of work this week i know there is there tend to preach a little length but i ain't even let close go on let me know now watch this now what is written is absolute once again but the manifestation of the word is the producing of the person is foreign it changed paul forever he would never be the same though his ambitions were high his goals and ambitions had changed separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me and no longer is an opinion and there's so many things you can talk about of these showdowns but like i said i was just going to hit the highlights what did this showdown produce the revealing of the sun the word to his agenda so much [Applause] [Music] think why do we want to just come to church we don't like about it missed the whole thing wow i'm gonna say it again the showdown [Applause] where actually does he live let's see if we stay too long on our youtube channels on saturday nights wow what is your absolutely he has he has no mouth but mine in yours and as long as we're halting between two opinions and we sing i've anchored in jesus christ i'm coming to this now i'm coming around the corner this is this is my whole message that i'm coming to you in just like 15 minutes can you and then i'm coming to the to the main part of it of the message of life all brave jesus how many believe that he is [Applause] the word ties itself back but if you don't believe me i'm going to shout i'm going to show you here put that put that quote on an absolute fantasy ultimate that's but i met something and since that came into me in that day you'll know that i am in the father he just told your father and then god separating his life watch this now it don't make any difference what others want to believe that's their opinion your ultimate sso what's your right that's your ultimate ultimate that's the last word and then if he is the word then this must be the last word this must it that's what we want to know what this word says for i am tied to christ and christ is the word you get that is allotted for this day the holy spirit is here to manifest that portion of the word that is gonna go on he was the end and then at fiend it was the end of the prophecy he fulfilled that the history they stole the songs everything in the old testament spoke of him it was fulfilled right there of the word of god i'm going to say it again he was the fulfillment of the all the old testament prophecies jesus fulfilling the old testament jesus but there is a group of people that fulfill all the new testaments and the real born-again people of this age okay who is he talking to how many people are born again the real born-again people of this age that's filled with the holy ghost is the thai post of the scripture got to be fulfilled in this last days they [Applause] [Applause] because that holds you i'll go i heard all the testimonies of your hard times that you had did you hold on to your religion during those times no no by religion [Applause] i want to say it again i'm going to say it again i can hold on a hard time but the scripture that pertained to me held on to me i can't go on i feel so condemned because of what i used to do and what i did the scripture is not tied to you yet it's just an opinion to you but when the scripture comes upon the waters and it comes now it's looking for a place he's looking for a type and when it reminds the person those that [Music] and that is what that is the showdown today when we see this i say wow the bible says mendo love your enemies i want to know if that word has attached itself to anybody come [Applause] the world the more you become the word i want to end with this and there's so much more i got to just skip a lot of this but my time is gone [Music] what people have missed in that in in when they speak about the absolutely absolutely the word as a person not a doctrine it is the person the new birth that's what it is it is the person he said that it's been the holy ghost this whole time that has been leading what he recognizes the part that pertains to this just so you can say that recognizing the absolute absolutely recognizing what i need you recognize what you need it is the showdown i end with this other world would you come to the piano this musician all that the prophets have spoken was not just about words but all they spoke of was the person and the same lord jesus it's hard for me to leave a lot these some of these things out because it really solidifies everything says in the exposition page the last day messenger pointed out because we cannot get to that point the showdown has to have already happened and i want to just end with this and in this dream i was i don't remember it was night time i remember going to the door and and i opened the door and i opened it i looked up and i stopped because as i look up i see the same light that i saw in the dream these lights started coming down will release the spirits and coming forth then and i knew the resurrection was on all i could do was turn around and yell in the house and i said it's time he's the father together with the body this is the holy spirit in me that's telling you today hear my voice and a stranger's voice they will not know as you stand to your feet play something i'm gonna invite you i'm gonna invite you this morning do we live too long under opinions and the lord says not no more [Music] [Music] when you think it's late it's even later than that this [Music] [Music] [Music] church i'm trying to get you to the other side you don't belong to me you belong to him i'm this morning [Music] as the holy spirit just starts to move amongst the altars you don't have to make up something you don't have to try to get some emotions all you got to do is reach out that's all you got to do this
