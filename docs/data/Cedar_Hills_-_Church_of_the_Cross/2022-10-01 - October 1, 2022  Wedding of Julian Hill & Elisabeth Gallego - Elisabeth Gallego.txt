foreign [Music] to this man who had holy bonds of natural thank you well guys here we are want to start off by saying how proud of you I am you girls you've grown up to be amazing young man I'm so very proud of you but I don't want to start crying so so you guys have reached this this stage of your relationship and here and getting ready to do the wedding vow arguably the most important part of this ceremony but the wedding vow is something that I don't think a lot of people really understand or pay a lot of attention too because it seems like something that you just repeat and is just done and it's just part of a ceremony and you go on with life but you see a wedding vow can be taken in two ways the first way that you can take a wedding vow is you can take a wedding vow as a contract and when you take a wedding vow as a contract it it brings a lot of things with it one of the one of the things that it brings is is a wedding vow taken as a contract falls under the law right and it brings with it something called an if then statement and a wedding vow taken as a contract with the if then statement says that if he does this then you'll do that or if she does that then you'll do this but that's not the way that God intended things to be a wedding vows should never be taken as a contract because that falls under the law a contract sets boundaries a contract sets terms and conditions and you never want a marriage and a wedding vow taken with terms and conditions that's not how God intended but the second way that you can take a wedding vow guys is as a covenant that's the way that God intended because a covenant is not based in the law the Covenant is between you and her two Souls two living people and you make a covenant and when you make that Covenant that Covenant is made under something different than the law it's made under love and it's made under grace and that Covenant that's why you find in the wedding vow until death do us part because a covenant is something that's made for Generations it's not something that's made for a period of time it's for a lifetime it's for an eternity covenants are made for long periods of time they're not made for short terms covenants don't set boundaries they don't do those things so how do you know what boundaries to respect to one another well it's simple when you enter into your marriage vows under a covenant love and grace take control of your relationship and you love her so much that you would never do anything to hurt her you love him so much that you would never want to do anything to hurt him so there's no need to put boundaries and terms and conditions on your marriage let the love of each other establish what is good and right in your household let that be your guiding force let that create your boundaries within your marriage always love each other always see each other through the eyes of Grace never lose that my dad I used to have a saying my saying I used to like to say was Lord willing and the creek don't rise and my dad used to always look at me and say oh it'll rise and that's true sometimes things happen life is not always the bed of roses sometimes they'll be hard times sometimes there'll be times you don't agree but if you remember that the value you gave was under a covenant and not a contract and you remember the love and the grace that binds you two together then no matter what happens no matter what comes you'll always be able to make it through together then there's a final part of The Vow and that's the bond that's the bond that's the thing that locks the two of you together and that's nothing more than almighty God because what he will join here today will be joined by him and through him and if you remember that it doesn't matter what this life will throw at you guys whatever happens in life come back to the thing that locks you two together which is the Holy Spirit come back to that thing that binds the two of you you've found Grace in her eyes she's found Grace in your eyes and together the holy spirit will bind the two of you and the Bible tells us what God has joined together let no man put asunder so no matter what happens in your life remember your covenant not your contract you're bound together and you're bound together by a force that is stronger than any that you could ever come across in this world and that is under the Holy Spirit and as long as you remember that and you come back to that you can face any challenge together and you will win so what I say to you guys is what God will join today let no man put us under God bless you [Applause] hello thank you you all look handsome you look handsome and you look beautiful you got the giggles very happy to be here and honored to be able to give the vows this afternoon I want to say before I start a man wrote one day in my journey through life I came across a wise man and I asked him this question what is more important to love or to be loved the wise man smiled and said which Wing is the most important for you to fly the left the right I think that speaks to all of us today one of the greatest things that you can ever find in your marriage the life of balance and it takes two wings to accomplish that so to love and to be loved brings quite a balance in a home you both have come today to join your hearts together you've opened your hearts one to another and now it's time to to let each other in and as you walk through our Prophet once told us we live in a three-room house and it doesn't matter how many more rooms that you have basically you live in those three rooms that is we are made up of a body spirit and a soul we want to type it to a house it's a kitchen a living room and a bedroom I want to tell both of you that one is just as important as the other the kitchen is where one eats in order to sustain life the living room is where you have Fellowship in order to help each other through life and the bedroom is where life is produced in order to keep those things always remember as I said one is just as important as the other keep this in mind that when you walk into each other's open heart into each other's home don't forget to take your shoes off because there are places in our hearts that are very sacred that teaches us to always respect each other because if there's no respect in a marriage then you do not have nothing you have no love there is nothing to live for but when you have the respect one for another as husband and wife it's because we realize and you all have realized that before your husband and wife you were Brothers and Sisters in Christ they'll respect each other at all times one of the greatest things you would ever have in your marriage so in these words I ask both of you to stand as we enter into the vows are you ready all right are all the witnesses ready yeah all right dearly beloved we are gathered here together in the sight of God and the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony which is commanded by Saint Paul to be honorable among all men it is therefore not by any to be entered into unadvisedly advisably or lightly reverently disgracefully soberly and in the fear of God and into this holy State these two persons present come to be joined if there's anyone here that can show it just cause why they should not be lawfully joined together this holy matrimony to speak now or from Hereafter forever hold your peace No Object I will require and will charge you both as you'll surely answer at the day of judgment when the secrets of All Hearts shall be disclosed that if there's either of you that know any impediment why you should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony do you now confess it or be it assured unto you that any couples that are not joined otherwise than God's word doth allow their marriage is not lawful but duly believing you have considered this solemn obligation you're about to assume and that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently discreetfully soberly and in the fear of God I shall propose to you the marriage covenant and you will witness the same as you join your right hands together right I forgot it Julian Hill will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife you live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love and honor and cherish and support in sickness or health riches or poverty and will forsake all others as long as you both shall live I do oh I was you sure huh all right Elizabeth Gallegos will you have this man to be your lawful wedded husband to live together in this holy state of matrimony you promise to love honor and cherish and support in sickness or health riches or poverty and cleave thee only unto him as long as you both shall live I do he sounds pretty sure all right I think we're doing okay then I will require a token as we place these rings upon the immovable perfect word of God I'm going to ask each one of you to take the ring that corresponds to your spouse and will you rejoin your right hands go ahead Amen Let Us bow our heads almighty God the great creator of all things the author of everlasting life and The Giver of all good gifts and thou did see fit to give man a present you gave him a wife it is written that he that has found a wife has found a good thing as we stand this afternoon after many thousands of years our mind is brought back to the time that the the first ceremony was ever performed it was performed by you father in the Garden of Eden when you married our father and mother Adam and Eve and to this day man has taken him a wife father we pray that you will bless this young man and this young woman who has found love in their hearts one to the other and in this Reckless age that we are now living so many divorces breakups in homes may it not be with this couple may they remember this vow as long as they live May there be no powers to ever separate them I pray thee father as you did bless Isaac and Rebecca and made them ever happy in their lives and they were fruitful we pray that you do likewise to this young man and this young lady who have agreed upon this they've talked it over and with each other in secret and now it has come they have come to the church and the front of this company they offer their trough their loyalty their faithfulness to one another and has did and declared it in this public place now father by the power of my commission given me by almighty God to be his servant in this sacred office by this Authority I Now pronounce this man and this woman husband and wife in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you you are married you may kiss your bride and whatsoever God has joined together let no
