[40:53] follow the Holy Spirit he'll tie
[40:54] everything in um
[40:56] second
[40:58] chronicles
[41:05] 25 so 2 Chronicles 25 verse
[41:10] 2 and he did that which was right in the
[41:15] sight of the Lord but not with a perfect
[41:24] heart we can do the right thing
[41:28] and still not have a perfect
[41:32] heart I'll let that sink in for a little
[41:35] bit today's going to be a little bit
[41:37] different
[41:39] brother I know it's youth
[41:41] service and I I know you have tremendous
[41:44] preachers
[41:46] here and I don't want to preach your ear
[41:49] off but I just wanted to open my heart
[41:51] to
[41:53] you you know brother Caleb you preached
[41:55] a a trend tremendous message in your
[41:57] series of I believe is Israel and the
[42:00] church and one thing that you said that
[42:02] really impacted
[42:07] me that the blood of Jesus
[42:11] Christ the bride is the doormat to
[42:15] Divine
[42:19] Fellowship it's the entrance
[42:22] mat and in order to enter into a Divine
[42:25] Fellowship
[42:29] we got to get past this veil of
[42:32] Flesh see God go he pulled back the
[42:34] curtain of
[42:36] time and he entered into a veil of
[42:41] Flesh so that we can have fellowship
[42:44] with
[42:45] him and his provided way for us to have
[42:48] Divine
[42:52] Fellowship to have a deeper
[42:55] relationship
[42:57] was to get past this
[42:59] Veil and enter into the
[43:02] blood so today I just want to help get
[43:05] past my
[43:09] flesh I'm gonna cut open my chest and

[43:28] better and that the Holy Spirit could
[43:31] come and reveal to you what it is that

[1:15:22] Lords
[1:15:33] um how many know the Lord in the power
[1:15:36] of his
[1:15:39] resurrection what a gift to a troubled
[1:15:45] world and it all depends on our attitude
[1:15:49] towards that
[1:15:52] gift you know the angel came to Mary and
[1:15:55] he gave her a
[1:15:57] message you're going to give birth to a
[1:16:01] child that the holy spirit will put
[1:16:04] inside your
[1:16:08] stomach scripture says she was
[1:16:16] troubled so it's not about avoiding the
[1:16:21] trouble it's about how we respond when
[1:16:25] we're
[1:16:29] troubled now King Herod got a message
[1:16:31] from the Magi from the three wise
[1:16:38] men where is this that should be born
[1:16:40] King of the
[1:16:43] Jews we saw the sign in the heavens we
[1:16:46] follow the star and we have come to
[1:16:51] worship and here Herod was
[1:16:57] troubled and all of
[1:17:00] Israel with
[1:17:03] him but how did he respond to that
[1:17:08] trouble it was the same message that the
[1:17:10] savior of the world has
[1:17:14] come Mary troubled had one
[1:17:18] attitude Herod troubled had another
[1:17:22] attitude
[1:17:24] and if you don't make the right choice
[1:17:26] when you're
[1:17:29] troubled when you're standing in the
[1:17:31] valley of
[1:17:33] decision in the Valley of the shadow of
[1:17:37] death oh how many are afraid of the
[1:17:39] Valley of the shadow of
[1:17:42] death let me give you a secret about a
[1:17:46] shadow a shadow never hurt
[1:17:50] nobody you would never been slapped by
[1:17:53] my
[1:17:55] shadow a shadow never stab a shadow of a
[1:17:58] sword never stabbed
[1:18:03] anybody a shadow of a gun never shot
[1:18:06] anybody
[1:18:09] either the shadow of Co never got
[1:18:11] anybody
[1:18:13] sick that's why the psalmist said
[1:18:18] yay though I walk through the valley of
[1:18:21] the shadow of death
[1:18:25] come at me
[1:18:27] bro what I shall fear no

[1:18:34] me th rod and th staff they comfort
[1:18:39] me when you're standing in the valley of
[1:18:43] decision and you're
[1:18:45] troubled what is our attitude in that
[1:18:49] trouble the Virgin
[1:18:51] Mary said o how can this be it's okay to
[1:18:56] have
[1:18:58] questions how can this be what am I
[1:19:02] going to do how can you go tell

[1:19:19] word be it unto me say me
[1:19:23] according to your
[1:19:26] word she didn't even ask for a letter of

[1:19:45] advice she heard the
[1:19:48] word though it troubled
[1:19:50] her be it unto
[1:19:53] me according to your
[1:19:56] word and King Herod in his
[1:20:00] trouble he had such a a panic
[1:20:05] spell he entered into such a state of
[1:20:10] anxiety oh my
[1:20:13] goodness that he caused all the young
[1:20:16] children two years and younger to be
[1:20:21] slaughtered
[1:20:23] so depending on how you react to your
[1:20:28] trouble you can bring
[1:20:32] life just like Mary brought
[1:20:36] life or you can produce
[1:20:39] death and it depends on your

[1:29:34] that I
[1:29:36] love that he received a gift from his
[1:29:40] father that's the the message today
[1:29:42] God's wrapped
[1:29:46] gift so as I'm
[1:29:50] speaking you're going to have to unrap
[1:29:53] it as I'm
[1:29:56] singing you're going to have to unwrap
[1:29:59] it that's how the gift
[1:30:02] Works how many appreciated the son of
[1:30:05] man revealed this
[1:30:15] morning you know this this certain
[1:30:19] son he had this great
[1:30:23] accomplishment and they were going to
[1:30:25] throw a celebration party cuz he had
[1:30:30] graduated and he had mentioned a need
[1:30:33] for a
[1:30:35] car so he built up this
[1:30:40] expectation he was going to get a car as
[1:30:42] a gift from his
[1:30:45] father his father was a wealthy
[1:30:49] man and so he expected a a generous
[1:30:54] gift and when it came time for the
[1:31:00] celebration he got handed a
[1:31:05] gift and it was about the size of my
[1:31:10] Bible wrapped up and anybody who held
[1:31:15] that
[1:31:17] gift knew that it was a
[1:31:20] Bible it obviously wasn't a
[1:31:23] car and that
[1:31:25] son in his
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:29] disappointment and in his
[1:31:32] trouble he
[1:31:35] just so
[1:31:38] offended I I know my dad makes this much
[1:31:42] money he gave my other brother such and
[1:31:45] such a
[1:31:47] gift he sent my sister on vacation to
[1:31:50] such and such a place
[1:31:54] he knows I already have a
[1:31:56] Bible he gives me a
[1:32:00] Bible he was so
[1:32:04] upset that he broke the relationship
[1:32:07] with his
[1:32:08] father years went by he didn't speak to
[1:32:10] his
[1:32:12] father Christmas Thanksgiving birthdays
[1:32:15] he never went back to visit his
[1:32:20] father until his father got sick and and
[1:32:23] eventually passed
[1:32:27] away and while Mom was doing the cleanup
[1:32:31] of Dad's things after the
[1:32:33] [Music]
[1:32:36] funeral she handed a box to the
[1:32:41] son which in the contents it included
[1:32:44] that gift that he never
[1:32:47] opened and in his Despair and his
[1:32:50] regret
[1:32:54] he opened up that
[1:32:57] gift and started flipping through the
[1:33:00] pages of the Bible that his father had
[1:33:03] got gave gifted to
[1:33:06] him and it opened up to a
[1:33:09] page and it was
[1:33:15] highlighted if you being a wicked
[1:33:20] father
[1:33:22] knows how to give good gifts to your
[1:33:27] children how much more our heavenly
[1:33:31] father gives to those who
[1:33:34] ask you you you know that scripture more
[1:33:37] or
[1:33:38] less and on that page where that
[1:33:40] scripture was
[1:33:43] highlighted was a
[1:33:45] check for the exact amount of money that
[1:33:48] that boy needed for his
[1:33:50] car
[1:33:53] it was in here all
[1:33:56] along but he never bothered to open the
[1:34:02] gift now every single Divine
[1:34:07] promise front
[1:34:11] row every single thing you desire that
[1:34:15] you
[1:34:17] need God has already wrapped it
[1:34:22] and gifted it to
[1:34:25] you and all we have to do is open
[1:34:29] it every single
[1:34:32] trial every single
[1:34:34] question does it pass the word
[1:34:39] test it's right here for us young
[1:34:42] people the good thing about this gift is
[1:34:45] it's the gift that keeps on
[1:34:50] giving and once you've received this
[1:34:55] gift I'm I'm holding the Bible as a
[1:34:57] visual this is the
[1:35:00] word but we know that John tells us that
[1:35:03] in the beginning was the
[1:35:06] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:35:10] Word was God and the word became
[1:35:13] fles and dwelt among us and then
[1:35:17] everything that God was he poured it
[1:35:19] into Jesus Christ
[1:35:22] and everything that Jesus
[1:35:25] was he poured it into his
[1:35:28] church so he was that wrapped
[1:35:31] gift and he poured himself in
[1:35:35] you then
[1:35:36] you are God's wrapped gift in human
[1:35:41] flesh for a troubled
[1:35:44] world that is the message of the
[1:35:47] Gospel it's Messiah present tent
[1:35:52] it's
[1:35:53] Messiah the Messianic
[1:35:57] Empire King
[1:35:59] Jesus doing the same
[1:36:01] work that he did in the book of
[1:36:04] Acts today with
[1:36:08] you with you through you using your
[1:36:12] hands using your feet using your mouth
[1:36:17] to heal this
[1:36:20] world am for those that would
[1:36:24] believe and accept
[1:36:27] it that's the
[1:36:30] gospel you know one time I was in barber
[1:36:35] school and I lost track of time brother
[1:36:37] Caleb just flagged me down I don't know
[1:36:39] how much time I have
[1:36:41] left but I I'll I'll wrap it
[1:36:44] up I was in barber school I'm a a barber
[1:36:50] instructor
[1:36:52] and there was a young guy in there
[1:36:53] getting a
[1:36:57] haircut and he got so upset at the
[1:37:02] student bro you messed up my Edge up

[1:37:48] and petrified this guy got a gun crazy
[1:37:53] and the spirit of the Lord came down
[1:37:55] upon
[1:37:56] me and the reason I know it was the
[1:37:58] spirit of the
[1:38:00] Lord is because I didn't feel
[1:38:03] it because sometimes when I feel
[1:38:06] it it's not the
[1:38:09] Lord when I think I'm
[1:38:12] inspired I'm not that's just my
[1:38:17] imagination I got a good
[1:38:20] imagination I've messed up a lot of
[1:38:22] things thinking that it was the spirit
[1:38:23] of the
[1:38:25] Lord but I didn't realize what was going
[1:38:29] on and only looking back can I see wow

[1:39:45] world that he gave his only begotten
[1:39:49] son thato believeth in him shall not
[1:39:54] perish but have everlasting life I said
[1:39:58] young man that gun might do something
[1:40:00] for you here in this
[1:40:03] world but one day you're going to stand
[1:40:05] before almighty God in
[1:40:09] judgment and that gun won't do anything

[1:40:19] car
[1:40:21] and I said thank you now sit down and
[1:40:24] I'll fix your
[1:40:27] haircut and for the next 30 minutes I
[1:40:29] talked to him about the
[1:40:32] gospel and about how his choices had led
[1:40:35] him down the wrong
[1:40:39] path but that God is so rich in Mercy
[1:40:41] that if he would give his life to the
[1:40:43] Lord Jesus
[1:40:47] Christ he would change his life
[1:40:52] got up shook my hand gave me a hug and
[1:40:54] said thank you for those words of wisdom
[1:40:59] sir now he left only God knows what
[1:41:02] happened to
[1:41:04] him but the lives of those Barber
[1:41:06] students were never the
[1:41:09] same and a couple weeks afterwards I
[1:41:12] baptized one of them in the name of the
[1:41:13] Lord Jesus
[1:41:17] Christ tattoos all the way up to his
[1:41:20] chin
[1:41:23] he was a a drug
[1:41:26] Smuggler he had a order that he was
[1:41:28] going to pick up that day to make
[1:41:31] money when he gave his life to the Lord
[1:41:33] right there in the barber in barber
[1:41:36] school he made a phone call he said hey
[1:41:40] bro I'm not going to pick up that order
[1:41:42] because I'm going to change my life
[1:41:45] today and his life was
[1:41:49] transformed that's same day he called me
[1:41:53] up and he said you know what
[1:41:54] Bernie I was on my way to the strip club
[1:41:57] after
[1:41:59] school and I said re what about your
[1:42:03] wife he said that's the thing for the
[1:42:06] first time I thought about
[1:42:08] her and I said I wouldn't want her to
[1:42:12] go even though she doesn't complain
[1:42:15] about it I want to consider
[1:42:18] her so I turned around and I went home
[1:42:20] and spent time with my
[1:42:23] wife and I told her that I was going to
[1:42:26] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:42:27] Jesus
[1:42:29] Christ and she looked at me like I was
[1:42:32] crazy but she said okay okay brought her
[1:42:36] to
[1:42:37] church baptized him his dad came to
[1:42:42] church we had lunch at my dad's
[1:42:46] house because
[1:42:49] God when he started start
[1:42:52] something he finishes it and you might
[1:42:55] look at your life and think that you're
[1:42:57] a
[1:42:59] wreck you might look at your life and
[1:43:01] you might think there's so many
[1:43:04] imperfections but one day there was a
[1:43:07] master sculptor and he was sculpting a
[1:43:12] masterpiece and this beautiful statue of
[1:43:14] Moses was
[1:43:16] there and the the the the the the
[1:43:19] sculpture got so inspired
[1:43:22] brother brandham says he took his hammer
[1:43:24] and he struck
[1:43:27] it
[1:43:29] speak but then he chipped
[1:43:32] it but that
[1:43:34] imperfection and the inspiration behind
[1:43:38] it is what made it a
[1:43:41] masterpiece so don't look at your
[1:43:44] weaknesses when the Devil comes and
[1:43:46] tells you you're weak
[1:43:49] Christian
[1:43:51] yes but it is
[1:43:53] written in my weakness he is made
[1:43:58] strong oh Hallelujah when he said you
[1:44:00] can't
[1:44:01] overcome yes but it is
[1:44:04] written he made us more than
[1:44:08] conquerors cuz it was
[1:44:10] written that's the only defense we
[1:44:13] have that's the gift today is God's
[1:44:19] word written on the tablets of your
[1:44:22] heart living out the gospel for
[1:44:24] everybody to
[1:44:28] see so that they can
[1:44:31] have the hope to
[1:44:34] receive and know Jesus
