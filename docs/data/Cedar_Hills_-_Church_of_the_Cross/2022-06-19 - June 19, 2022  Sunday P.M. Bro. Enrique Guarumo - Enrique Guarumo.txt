one that helped me to form my character and the ones who lead me to the father of fathers the amazing loving rock of ages the great i am the lord jesus christ god bless you amen god bless our sister believe we have come to the most important part of the service that is to hear straight from the throne of god this evening amen our minister tonight is our brother enrique guarumo we have come expecting great things from the lord and let us all stand let's sing that song fuego celeste [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is the lord jesus christ bless you this evening first one oh that the scripture says remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not no nor the years nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them let us pray beloved heavenly father we can thank you this evening at this time we present ourselves before you for your service beneficial and for the benefit of thy people [Music] may you open up our understanding so that we can comprehend what thy word says blessed in the name of the lord jesus our lord amen when we take these scriptures simply first of all what we try to do is try to be a help help in the scriptures pastor local as we heard our pastor say because of the lack of knowledge for many people perish established and here solomon is speaking to us and the first thing he says is remember thy creator in the days i'm going to speak a little bit on what is a friendship the bond doesn't tie them just unite them and we can see like as in a couple they can be a a good couple and today i want to focus on our the bonds that we have with god there is a bond towards our children i being socialists there are there are social bonds classes and different kinds of bonds but we are going to focus on the bonds of god [Music] and with that i'd like to take another scripture in daniel in daniel chapter one so that we can comprehend a little bit more daniel [Music] daniel chapter one and here i'm going to stay here a little bit because when we have friendships out in the world muchas personas and mainly here in the christian world and here we're gonna find three young men oh these pages they got stuck together and it is very important to see which bond we have with god and it says and the king spake unto ashpinaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring certain of the children of israel and of the king's seed and of the princes and skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science palacio del rey and such as had ability in them to stand in the kings palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaladins versus verse six entrees now among these were of of the children of judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah verse eight is but daniel purposed in his heart no contaminarce that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat and says and us when we get to the place as the christians that we are momentos there are times there are moments situations [Music] not to contaminate himself now the king had placed certain young men with abilities with the ability to be able to be in the palace of the king persona that's why many people many many young people they say they desire a lot of things for their life the question is are we ready are we prepared because how beautiful it is i want to get married to your daughter but the question is are we prepared that's the problem that's why i use him as an example this young man came in to present himself with with his girlfriend and he said i want to get married okay congratulations but this man that doesn't matter to me you you say ludico i'm telling you antis i'm letting you know beforehand i'm letting you beforehand because you know sooner or later you might repent from that because that's why here the king was was requiring these men intelligentes to be intelligent and she says oh no that doesn't matter to me i want to get married okay and i said to myself well why does this man do that i i i thought that and i was ridiculing him but i was saying the truth the time passed why did this man tell this young lady that perron but in those three years [Music] [Laughter] but then there comes a time where you can say oh my daughter is ready to get married is she prepared because god is coming for a people question that are prepared that the bible says that he will come to them that are waiting for him because daniel although he was there he purposed in his heart no contaminants that he will not defile himself with the things of those the king that's why when when the young people when they go to school here we are going to re rehearse or go over the the bonds that we have with god and god and his immense wisdom he left us ten commandments cinco para con that we should love the lord our god above all things and if you fulfill that yes everything else comes on its own you've already overcome and here is where we enter into our personal bond with god not to defile thyself and god gave us the free moral agency so that you can decide whether you want to do it or not i want to read it so that we can be confirmed with the scripture the scripture says in verse 16. wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom seeing he has no heart to it here i'm going to say something because the people think quela felicidad consists that that that a happiness consists i'll give an example better uh a lot of people say oh when i when i get married i want to be happy the bible says that it is an affliction of the flesh do not have so many problems you have a free moral agency it says here because wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom he has no heart to it because many people think kevalen that they are worth they are they're worth a lot because of what they have they think because if they have a new vehicle and i hope that's not the the problem here the issue here but but if i buy a new vehicle i can think to myself oh well that's that's my worth oh they can put a nice watch of gold thinking that that's what that's what's going to give him his worth and that's not the way it is so then the scripture says yes a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity it is so important that the bible says that we should have friends and i like this because because the bonds of friendship they are broken when they are broken it is very hard to restore them that's why the bible says then it speaks to us that we should have a bond in the flesh but when we break those bonds that's why we must be born again because that is the bond that is going to unite you with god in tonses a man that has friends must show himself friendly in tons so then it is it's really easy to have friends but how hard it is to be able to to be friendly to to be a friend we can regardless we can have a bunch but when we try to go and be a friend and because when you have a certain viewpoint in life of of a wise man he said that you don't have to have you don't have to have war with with bombs and a missiles all you have to do is is express your position and then you would you'll have enemies and you don't you don't need bombs that's friendships are wonderful you're going to or it doesn't say that they don't get to the to the success that they like because bonds are broken jesus jesus jesus said these words by your fruits we see it by our fruits and according to that sometimes we think to ourselves oh i am very successful but in order for that to happen you need and the first bond that god demands of us is faith because without that faith you are not going to be able to move we the prophet preached a message called perseverant and we cannot get nowhere first of all you can't don't believe in yourself because it is impossible to please god without faith and says gonna go to ecclesiastes11 and verse nine okay the youth don't have a sense of life and i don't know why there's there's there's youth that are there like if they're sucking on lemons and greet them and we're kind of scared sometimes but for for a youth living rejoicefully when we go outside we should say god bless you and with a smile [Music] the other day i was observing somebody that was smoking marijuana and i was observing him oh and this guy he began to sing and he began to shout okay because because i was going through a hard time i don't know if you've ever seen someone that's been in drugs he doesn't care about anything in sometimes it looks like we don't like anything brother or sister and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes here uh solomon is you know i see him he's tremendous tremendous to give this uh to give us advice to the young ones take rejoice and what you see god but know one thing that above everything that you do is going to judge you [Applause] one more scripture these and it says jose can me for i know that in me that is in my flesh no more dwelleth no good thing is and it says is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find that the church should be filled well but it's not easy to do it and it says for the good that i would i do not. but the evil which i would not that i do that's why the first thing that we should do is know ourselves because paul says i i know myself and i know that sometimes the brothers we we we leave them we're tired you say oh like glacia and we say oh the the church oh church and we i am up to here and sometimes we're a little bit a little bit up to here pero romanos but brothers that i want to do that i don't do this and it says now if i do that i will not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me the apostle paul is saying that i have sinned he says i find then allah that when i would do good evil is present for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members and bringing me into captivity he is telling me to the law of sin which is in my members and god knows and he's he even knows the way you sit down and the way you get up he knows everything i have one more scripture go 3 3 therefore your members which are upon the earth who who wants to die so the the problem isn't that we're that we we're going to die and ask you so that's why the prophet recommends us that we should die to the things of the world i have a little boy back there we see how the lord how he teaches us because the prophet says that time is the best discerner and if we want to measure ourselves in our spiritual level so that we see that when we are we're little called me and i say it because i see my little boy and just to be able to put a shirt on it was we struggle cambiar to change him we struggle and i say oh well i'm sure he's gonna get to the to the point where he's going to be able to do it himself so then so then i understood on on your the stage of your spirituality you're going to do some things that are easy an adult where it says that it's a day of service and and the road or the way is a little easier and it says therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil conspicuous and covetedness which is idolatry and who is god telling this to to his people es esta el this is between the people or this is for the people yes sir but this is here is where we should know how to measure ourselves and say you know and say where am i let us stand to our feet there are many more scriptures but when you break those bonds we we have we have done we have rehearsed it we have rehearsed this and we had and at our homes if we let something small that enter and before we know it we have a big problem because the bond familiaris we're not talking about the family bond because there it's delicate but we ourselves may you be are it is a time where there is a lot of profession but very little very few vocations help us lord yes and give us strength and this walk look [Applause] god bless you brothers hallelujah praise the lord [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh oh [Music] the can you tell the lord jesus let you love him
