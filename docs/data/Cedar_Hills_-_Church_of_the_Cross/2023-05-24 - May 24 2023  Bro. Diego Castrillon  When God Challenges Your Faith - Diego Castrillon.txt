lot more difficult than I expected I Was Defeated I went to work the next day yes was moping around wondering if I'd be eating in three months you see and I started talking to a co-teacher that I have in the room and she's a Christian La Cristiana and I'm telling you all these things and she looks at me and she pauses and she goes aren't you a Christian yeah Cristiano and immediately I knew exactly where I was getting checked I just knew I was the Lord was talking to me he is and she goes then just speak it and I was like you're right because speak it and don't worry about it so I said okay then

when my wife tells me that she loves me I love it I would like to invite you Minister healing unto her Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and want you to open your Bible there in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 37. we are thankful that you are watching uh online and I'd like to title this thought when God challenges your faith we'll say it again when God challenges your face and now you can put your name there is the word says it came from verse one all the way to verse four the first verse and the Hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones now capture the next verse the prophet gives some details here he's very specific when he speaks about these bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and low they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and and I answered O Lord God thou knowest Prophet is again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them all ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord let us pray Lord very good evening or our vessels surrendered we we submit them unto youth the Lord speak to us Inspire us give us the strength give us a double portion of thy spirit and Lord Quicken these words Lord once again our prayer in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ take your seat thank you [Applause] to beginner we like to read what brother Branham says the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever as we'd like to take the church to the place that we can truly Apostolic see Apostolic times moving in our midst ate doesn't that affirmation seem so tremendous to you we want to take the church now how many wants to go there I am a Christian because I believe this word and because I believe I read what the Holy Spirit when it fella when he fell over 120 individuals in the upper room brother Grandma speaks about time yeah you can all stick apart where brother Brown says yes yes if that same tree produces a brand it would have to pray the same time I want to know what kind they produced in the beginning when we read The Acts of the Apostles then I begin to see the work of the works of God foreign who he is in his church that's what it Purdue now I asked brother uh Thomas said one time is being preached show me where show me where is now look at the title when God challenges your faith let me corner you a little bit by the throat foreign [Applause] it is not a business of men even your own foreign I want you to capture this right now we the church [Music] now listen has to rise up in the power of God I believe the church is in the conditions to be able to teach deeper things and strip away s now capture this is time is close it's now time to learn but also it is the time to strip away manufacturing you know the word strip away etiquette is to strip away challenges your faith I can see the Seer Ezekiel nothing that frustrates a minister a man of God what then when he sees like Iglesia the church or when he sees the people divided foreign don't think it was just like a parking lot out there no it was a valley that's the size of New Mexico that's how the valley was it is and this Vision impacted the prophet so much he says Ezekiel will these bones live and the prophet could not believe that they could get done if the possibility exists come here can these bones live and Ezekiel said of course oh I believe it speak it the word doesn't say that the prophet stayed silent Señor but hear me prophesy speak to those bones the faith of the Prophet that was the condition of Israel after this Vision you can see the prophet Ezekiel although the people were divided hear the word of the Lord and Ezekiel speaks when God challenges your faith case everyone that is sick hear me listen to this I haven't seen a more difficult case in the Bible with the woman with the blood issue I don't find anything more complicated or more difficult this woman this lady she was in Israelite she was a Jewish woman she was part of the Covenant she had a blessing but because of her condition the very blessing condemned her I've never seen anything like that the very blessing that covers the very blessing condemned her now this woman is never took no foreign evil because she had heard that God the one she served had done Miracles she'd go to the other positions I'm sorry her condition was worse but she would not take notes she still took ahold what the most miserable life without having Fellowship all these years without being too good Fellowship for love what are the most Miserables what a suffering is [Music] the circumstances but she never took no for an answer Hallelujah when Jesus arrived on the scene she had heard all the great things he had done but you know what the worst thing was she did not even have the rights to go into a prayer line she did not even have that right forbid her to do that when God challenges your faith she said what do I do kill me they'll kill me but she never took no for an answer the Bible says she said she believed if I can only touch when God challenges this woman said foreign Peter says when God challenges your faith foreign one of the most tremendous things brother Brown says let us rise up in the power of God that's why we come to church that went over and touch God here comes Jesus here comes the faith was so strong that is when God challenges your faith it is the testimony of Cornelius the first Gentiles fortunately he was a military man yeah well who has served Cornelius he was a centurion the scriptures yes in verse 10. you can read it at home it was around the ninth hour look how the salvation of Cornelius begins began in a supernatural way the Bible says an angel and turn into the house of Cornelius entering into the house I'm worthy to enter into this into this house [Music] I don't see anything dirty here I come listen to the words that he says said your prayers there's no need to pay for the ties in the New Testament ality may the Lord rebuke the devil friendas your your arms your prayers they have come to the presence of God now listen it was the first time that an angel visits Sent From Heaven or salvation Here Comes Cornelius is that you may proceed how it will be indicated to you and he tells him about Peter he tells them and what house he will be in Manda and he sends for him the conversion of a gentile Cornelio Manda this is one of his servants of confidence he sends for Peter in the instances men enter into the house the Bible says holy spirit spoke to Peter yeah he said he said go with them I have sentences [Applause] and how we should fix things I'll tell you something Brothers all this that I have just told you it was it was the easiest part but here comes the difficult part is the most complicated remember when God challenges your faith the scripture says that when Peter arrived to Cornelius house Cornelius had prepared his house to receive him to receive him Cornelius would have never received the Holy Spirit if he had not received whom God had sent that's the most difficult part John chapter 6 13 20. teacher what can we do to do the works of God receive whom he has sent right the Bible says that when Peter began to speak there was so much respect I can imagine Cornelius must have called out his men of confidence to the presence of the Lord he sent for his people chapter 10 of the book of Acts and I can imagine Familia listen family foreign now well Remus we can eat this this piece of bread when God challenges your faith listen the last 12 years brother Branham says Jesus Jesus perfect perfect because he believed who he was he was the word that made him have perfect faith brother Bradham says no now let me make a turn for the last 12 years it has been so outstanding now let me help your faith and I say this to help your faith for the last 12 years it has been outstanding that the Holy Spirit has given me the privilege to be able to go the missionary trips in the spirit to be able to bring a portion of information can have success a bit of information the last 12 years that produce that has produced Faith because I believe what is my position speaks of my position that gives me Faith to the Believers what the word believers them that believe why does it cost us to believe why does it cost us to believe how many Believers are here this word is and God challenges your face now the most tremendous thing it's not that Historia that's that's history the tremendous is what I see what I saw last week but let me tell you that I can see that Revival I can see that revised I was prophesied up in the scripture I was spoken by the prophet I can see that Revival I was in that Revival I put my hand in that flame when God challenges let me tell you I can see yes the people divided I want nothing to do with it listen church I saw foreign you're waiting or another minister to pray sure of course we'll pray not everyone is at the same level of course we'll lay hands that is I can take the church no I'll take the church to a condition where they can speak the word the conditions are perfect when I was in the vision I could see so much Darkness but that is the requirement [Applause] [Applause] Daniel chapter 11 says the people that knows their God exploits I'm sorry if the musicians can come up Daniel Daniel a Jewish Prophet a prophet is prophesied unto the Gentiles and he said the people that knows their God will make exploits it does not say evangelist make exploit Ed God told the prophet speaks when nothing could happen is foreign [Music] manifest I believe and the ministers believe but the question is do you believe do you believe I asked when Amigo what is your enemy I'm not speaking of you I'm speaking of the sickness of the depression of your failures everything I do goes wrong Amigo what's your enemy and I I'm still the same we can't do anything it is God who does the work but if you can have faith when God challenges your face you have a cancer overcome your enemy when will you do it tomorrow [Music] what do I need to do to receive believe and receive
