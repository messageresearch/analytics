Eternity what is time Tiempo after ten thousand years Milanos there's no marking of time we've just begun as you can see I've gotten beyond the prime of life I've hit retirement age as far as working but you know in the Lord's army I don't see any retirement but I told the brothers Hermanos I'm getting ready for the biggest youth meeting that anybody has ever seen they ain't gonna be no wheelchairs amen amen I'm getting ready to leave this world see this world it's not a fit place it's not a proper place for us to live here but we've got a place prepared that we will fit right in because it is being custom made up and brother Caleb's office he pointed to a big chair Grande it would bid a man twice as big as me there was plenty of room but the home that we've got prepared for us everything's gonna fit perfectamente the chair will be just the right size the worship will be just right perfecta but preach and it'll be just right perfect the music will be just right perfect oh won't we have a Time amen amen God bless bendiga let's just bow our heads for a second dear Lord Senor I find it such an honor of feedback among your people in Las Cruces once again in Las Cruces that we could worship you and Lord I have nothing new to say but I just want to put the Brethren and remember of what you have already said in the written word and through the mouth of your prophets in the name of the Lord Jesus we believe in him we trust amen God bless you you could be seated I bring greetings from the church at home a faith of the Apostles my pastor Brother David Moore David Morris who wanted me to extend greetings to you all and I told the brothers today that I would tell you all tonight don't ever think that you're stuck down here in the corner of New Mexico by yourself solos because the Bride of Jesus Christ the body of Christ is we are not divided but when you hurt but when you glory brother Caleb was telling us here about all of these ministers that had just been ordained in Africa when you glory Gloria we Glory off because we are not building our kingdom and you are not building your kings are helping to build the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ anything beyond that is and I believe that we should let for the glory of the king but I like Gloria Del Rey amen amen I had wanted to come last year and I came down with the flu and could not make the trip and uh we are on our way out to Harmony in the desert is but I called brother Caleb and told him I wanted to come by and see you all again see when I first met brother Caleb and brother Tom when the Primera best we were all together at a meeting up in Northern Illinois in Illinois and usually in that meeting they only give a minister just a few minutes but gospel preachers we can't say it in just a couple of minutes so they took a little bit more time praise God the sons of God by the spirit of God and when I I after the meeting we did not have a lot of time to Fellowship would you shake hands hey I enjoyed I enjoyed what you had to say okay okay but I purposed in my heart I want to spend some more time around those Spirits you know I love it when you can get around people but you've never met them before and in just a few minutes it's like we've known each other all of our Lives I believe that it's because that when the sons of God shouted we knew each other and what we see in this life is just a reflection of where we have come from and we have the same testimony as the Lord Jesus had that we have come from God and we're going back amen amen God Bless you that's why we can have fellowships it's not around the Creed it's not around some kind of a fellowship card that we would carry in our pockets but it's because that we have been washed in the blood baptized in the holy spirit amen into amen Body of Christ God bless you again I say it's an honor then and a privilege to be here with you but if you turn with me in the scriptures I don't know if I should read in English also yes if you turn with me in second Corinthians 5 Second Chronicles and I'd like to start it verse 10. yes there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at aura when the Lord made a commandment with the children a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the Holy place for all the priests that were present and did not then wait by course also the Levites which were the singers all of them of Asia of amen amen of Jonathan with their sons and their brothers being a raid in White linenofino having symbols and sultry is stood at the East End of the altar all oriente and with them 120 priests found him with trumpet and it came to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one when to make one sound to be heard and praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to ministers by reason of the clouds for the glory of the Lord build the house of the Lord I want you to get this picture of course we're speaking here of Solomon's temples it had been years and being built and anyone and we know the story of how that David had it on his heart and he went to Nathan the prophet if we if Nathan told him said do all this in your heart because David was under conviction he said it's not right that I live in a house of Cedars but the Ark of God is dwelling in a tent but then the spirit of the Lord spoke to His prophets and that Prophet came back to David and he said you're not the man to do it because there's blood on your hands you're a man of war but God's Gonna raise the son to you and he'll do it let me stop here for just a second moment I hear people say brother farmer I can't preach God hasn't called me to preacher but if you're Desiring to do something for God there's always something for you to do David could not build the Tabernacles but he said I'll go out and get gold you're El Cedro and he laid them up in store and David dedicated the cups that would be used in the service of the Lord and then in the building of the temple you know when I came by the church earlier today a brother had a saw on the back of his truck but in the building of that Temple the scripture tells us there was not the sound striking Stones right construction job and they said and yet it was done so reverently as we could imagine the brothers getting together they wouldn't even talk inside the temple but they would talk on the outside they built the entire temple with such a holy hush and riverencia because it was dedicated to the Lord so when it come time to dedicate it the construction was all done yesterday now they're going to dedicated and the glory of this Temple La Gloria Este it was the most glorious thing that had ever taken place in Israel they never had a structure like and all of the priests they had their dedication service ready they had all their notes ready and the singers had all of their songs ready and the singers the scripture said had dedicated theirself priest had dedicated they were dressed in white linens what type of the Bride of Jesus oh they made sure that their prayer claws evenly over their heads no doubt they were showing their self to each other because they wanted to make sure everything was right they had went by and dedicated Los instrumentos that's nice because they wanted everything perfecto amen because they never had a service and they thought that they had everything perfectly ready and they was ready to come out and preach their dedication sir dedication but when the power of God came down and that Smoky prison yes you know what I'm talking about it just looks like a mistake when and that cloud comes down oh let me tell you something we don't just have a picture of the clouds I could tell you of a service and a house bill Kentucky and are you in Kentucky when my daughter got the Holy Ghost Santo we had family Alder family and we knelt down in the living room and prayed in La Sala but when we got done praying my daughter wasn't done and mama said honey are you still wanting something and she said yeah I want the Holy Ghost and our family Alder had just started this is that little girl ain't never been the same since amen amen and we had the lights off in the living room but there was a light on in the kitchen towards the kitchen they looked like there was smoke all three oh that's the presence of God and it changes everything I want you to know tonight while the presence of the Lord is in the building be content to leave here without no security we've got wonderful ministers thank God foreign [Applause] hey amen the scripture if we turn to the second chronicles chapter 3. and we're starting at verse 5. I want you to listen at how the Apostle Paul um not that we are sufficient of ourselves versus now if you could say this and the prophet of God brother Branham could say that same thing but I am nothing but he's here then where does that leave room for anybody just start thinking themselves as being something let me tell you something the only way that I can help you tonight as if I become small so that he can become greater the less that you see a forest Farm the forest farmer so that the more you can see of the Lord Jesus Jesus amen amen let's read on but our sufficiency the only thing that makes us capable is God is you know I've heard good preachers and sometimes I've heard them preach the best messages hello hola you know I heard one time of a a man that was a music critic is that he went to a concert and well uh and he said that he wrote the shortest appraisal of that concert that he had ever written it said Immaculate but no conception but on my conception I've heard some sermons about like that yes they were letter perfect perfect preacher stood just perfect but there was no life there couldn't be a life because there had been a death before that the life could come from that the people aren't looking at a big name preacher okay but we're looking at the only great one amongstros that's when God can come on this thing is make himself manifest yes amen amen who also [Music] because remember the spirit makes the world live the devil is not scared of your Bible the devil is not scared Mr Church age book or your seal books they are scared of your Cod books and the life of a human Hallelujah then he gets down and he tremble Anton says y'all don't mind me taking off a coat do you then Anton says the enemy gets upset I believe that we have been called nervous Devil's nervous but I said Los Los de monos to make thick Devils sick I said lost these Minister Brothers can tell you we can come to the platform not feeling well um but by the time services we're feeling real good because the power of God comes on the same and that sick devil just doesn't have dominion over us anymore that is not hell for a few preachers that is not for just a few priests that is for each and everyone that we claim every promise of God hold on to it amen amen this word has not been delivered it's all the few individuals but this word has come is that the veil was taken off at one time they Lord help there was such a glory Gloria on the face of Moses that they could not look on him that would blind them but instead they had to take a veil and they'd put that Veil over Moses's face you couldn't see him plainly it was shielded and it was the same way with the Lord Jesus Christ that he was fail from us but in this day there's never been a day like this Angel begins yesterday the mystery of God and the veil was taken I can tell you I've got something in my hand but it's bail from you don't know what it is but if I take the veil off of it everyone in here can see brother Farmer's got his pocket knife finished why do you know that because it's been unveiled to you it's no longer got the veil of my hand over it that's what has happened in this day off of the Lord Jesus Christ let's go on and read on down but if the ministration of death SI administered Moses Moises had Administration he had a Ministry in the young mini studio that it was chiseled in stone oh it was Permanente but yet the glory that was there but I went like Gloria Glory that's shown on Moses's face there was going to be an end to that but if the administration of death was glorious so that the children of Israel could not stand fastly the whole the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away with how shall not the ministration of the spirits be rather glorious Gloria for if the ministration ministerio that's another word for Ministry in English of condemnation be glory welcome Gloria then how much more munchamas does the ministration administerio of righteousness exceeding glory and Gloria for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory Gloria that Excel yes I don't know if y'all have been out for the last two or three nights we've had a full moon and man you could just stick your head out the door put that point out and say it is so bright outside you see this is that you could almost drive without your headlights since but when the sun came up you couldn't even see the light of the Moon because the glory of the Sun so much more glorious rather gloriosa then what the light of the moon was De La Luna that's the reason why is that when people have been caught in denominationalism let me stop right here I'm not just talking about baptist and methodists that had a one-man denomination your pastor try and tell them something no no won't take Corrections we know what kind of a character that that is according to the scriptures one man denomination brother don't you think you need to consider what was preached last week oh that's her brother I wasn't for me one man's denomination I'm right pasture ain't right God didn't say I'll give you one man denomination amen amen I don't know how I got on that but there you go amen amen the Lord knows what he's doing if if the ministry a dedicating Solomon's temples which was made by hand was that glorious that the house was filled with smoke before the preacher ever said oh come on come on you say brother farmer you're talking about a different day yesterday and I guess I'm just living in a different day amen amen do I have to remind you that the prophet of God told about being an Angelus Temple out in California I've loaded start in and in a temple Angeles in California that they kept hearing something I said what is that is that brother Branham they hear that often here and the problem that God said it sounded like angels singing hello or under what nobody there we could do the same thing right here tonight where the spirit of God is how many times have we heard on tape even if you watch the film of the prophet of God where he just started talking and finally he said you know I'm waiting on something I'm waiting on him because until he cameo brother Branham couldn't do anything but then a little bit later he said bring him up he's here amen amen if the glory see like Gloria of the dedication dedication of Solomon's temples was glorious Glorioso then what about a temple that is not made by him you know or cause this bride of Jesus Christ for the service of God foreign instructions to the disciples he told them you go up to Jerusalem he said not to go in the temple but you tarry there and the holy spirit's gonna come and it's going to feel a bunch of temples until you're in dude with power and then starting at Jerusalem they've told them Terry in Jerusalem and then starting in Jerusalem then I put this in 21st century terms write down on your knees [Applause] whether it's in Church San Iglesia whether it's in your house or if it's out in the woods make any difference where you meet God but don't just meet him let him stay away amen amen wherever you get filled with the Holy Ghost all right starting right there I'm just going to ask a question where's your Jerusalem donde esta when you get the Holy Ghost you've already got everything that you need for a rap god amen amen you know what we'll get a new rifle deer hunting or else you know what's the first thing we'll do oh brother you gotta come see my ride you need to go out to the range at 400 yards they'll shoot in a teacup oh come and see and when you get the holy ghosts oh you gotta get a finger on what I got yeah oh brother it feels good you've got to see what it can do I said I'll put up Target for you amen amen amen a man what made a little church with 12 people call the church of Epic yeah the power house that it was if we hello hola it wasn't the amount of people look at brother Brian I'm in church order uh when he told me he said you know it's the quality of spirit because it wasn't the quantity it was the quality yes amen amen let me tell you something what the spirit of God does is it hits the target every time you have a whole bucket full of ammunitions but you can take boring back when I was a boy I went out hunting out in Colorado and there was a an Old Gentleman came out on the rifle ring he had a rifle that looked like it had been used for a boat uh uh para mobile and he's setting up a targeted 500 yards the Legos Anna somebody got to laughing at his gun yeah and one of the boys that I was with got to laughing at it you know that Los Muchachos he thought that 700 Remington 300 Mag that he had was just to catch me out but I seen something sitting on top of that rifle that it was a German Zeiss rifles and you don't put a piece of glass like that on a BB gun nope and I said I'd be careful how I talked about that man's rifle hombre and a little bit later he called Down the Line does anybody have a range fine somebody hollered back yeah and he said how far is that White Rock up there and they called out 800 yards and he pulled a little piece of paper out of his pocket with a pencil I thought oh boy he sat down with that rifle and dusted a little old rock up there on the side of them because he knew what he had oh let me tell you something church I know what we've got whom I have believed you're saying help take the strong hand of faith when he laid that rifle across the stand back he wasn't shaken and quivered you couldn't see one movement out of it but when he pulled the triggered amen amen and if we sinosotros we'll just forget about put more emotion into it God do what he foreign vessels dedicated vasos dedicados to the work of the Lord why are we here nobody's paying us to come tonight but we've come for one reason we want to get a little bit closer to God we want to have fellowships oh yes we have Fellowship one with another company it's worth fellowshipping God in our brother and our sisters and God in his word see if it was just to come see sort of what I uh and to tell you of a couple quotes oh they're strength I've worsen at you but when God quickens that word that it causes us to go out differently are you here we don't walk the same way that we use that's the power of the Holy Ghost we don't think the way that we used to think why what is it the quickening power of the Holy ghosts don't worry that we can't even think those preachers when they came out their knees just went to wobbling they got under that power and they couldn't say nuts I love it when a man comes out and he don't even know what he's going to say but just the vessel that gets yielded to the Holy Spirit he's talking over the dinner table today that you can have a man come in from four or five states away go through conversations that you and your pastor has had it goes through people's minds oh brother Caleb told him it happens at home too I've seen Brother David throw up his hands in the air giant instead of word amen amen what is it yes it's that same Smokey press this that just takes over a human being what is it that makes us behave the way that we do you know would it be okay just to remind you of something else one time there was a cyst that was going to get her little baby prayed for Eva uh and she went in looking for a seat and there was no seats but there was a mama that had compassion and seen this mama had a prayer card in her hands she said honey why don't you take my seat and I'll just find another state and she said I see you've got a prayer card but would it be okay if I just prayed for your baby and the mama laid hands on the baby and that night brother Brian I'm called that lady's number and she got it when she came up on the platform the Lord showed him said you want prayer for this baby but there's a woman setting up in the balcony that the Lord laid it on her heart to give you her seat could she pray for you and when she did God's already healed it just go your way oh it's not just for preachers it's for each and every one of them dinosaurs people tells me all the time said Oh Brother Farms those things are just coincidence and I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ lives the most coincidence [Applause] I challenge you pray usted that God would put somebody in your life that you could be a witness too and see if God won't do it amen amen amen amen of course I may not be preaching as hard as what you think I should be he says in February of last year I survived what they called the Widow make her heart attack yes my heart got down to 40 beats the minute in the back of the ambulance because people can say whatever that they want to play but when you have stared death in the face it is that Stinger was pulled out on cows so I said if the Lord didn't take me off the scene I have not fulfilled no I completed God wants me to do on this Earth until I do see I've been a contractor most of my life you know we did on a paint job we'd write down what I'm gonna do and what the price was going to be following me nobody paid me for just going on the job I had to get the job done so I've kindly got a contractor's mentality even now let's get the job done and go to the house I'm ready to go yesterday [Applause] you know when they wheeled me into the heart cath laboratory they didn't take me to the emergency room they give me an EKG in my living room I had a little box on the ambulance the pyramid took a picture of it with his phone send it to the hospital when the ambulance rolled up at the hospital who nurses was waiting at the door is Mr farmer I said yeah I said just follow up Laboratory shot a little bit of dying uh so what we're about to do could cause stroke could even cause death do we have your permission to proceed I said let's do it over here they shot the dying they've seen where the problem was I felt a little Thug pants and I guess I grunted the doctor said you felt that is he he said we got it pull the blood clot out I said you called off some numbers that you asked for a three by Twenty Eight yeah he said I can't believe you remembered that he said we got a stenta that was three millimeters about 28 millimeter long foreign um they give me some medicine I was awake all through that but then when they got done I guess I relaxed enough but I was asking for about 15 minutes I don't respond real well to pets and I didn't even have my eyes open here and I said ma'am are you from the Philippines I said I thought I I recognized the accent uh and I started talking to her about when I went on a mission trip into the Philippines and I see you about three hours later and my son took a picture of me laying propped up in the bed with my finger stuck up in the air the York reaching to a nurse and Clifford sent that picture to a bunch of the brothers and foreign [Applause] I was just telling them they only had me in ICU or a little bit over one day at 10 o'clock at night after I'd been in one full day this place is they moved me to another room they brought a nurse in yeah and about five o'clock the following morning when she opened the door I sleep kind of like so I woke up and she said they told me you had a heart attack the day before yesterday she said you don't look like you had a heart attack I said ma'am that's because I served the most high God yes he takes care of the other people amen amen she said he must well I I don't have to have a Pulpit free you know give me an empty five gallon bucket on a job site give me a hospital bed um McDonald's Dodgers start testifying a little bit she looked over at my wife and said your husband sure has some interesting stories foreign brother Branham said y'all ain't gonna get mad at me are you see that's the reason we don't want our young kids hugging around and kissing on each other brother Brandon said when you Embrace a woman that friend I'm sorry brother Caleb if I'm getting out of line just pull on my cocktail if we were made in God's image that tells me is that I've got the authority to tell people what I told that nurse if there's a desire in your heart to be where you once was with the Lord there's a place in the arms of the Lord she started crying I said we sing a song at home that says With Arms Wide Open he'll welcome you it is my wife had already seen that I've went into preaching mode so she went to get me a cup of coffee just as I was saying that and this little black nurse was in there crying do you want us to pray with you and she said yes I do yeah we joined Hands Across that hospital bed young lady back into the presence of the amen when she left to go she said I hate to live I've got other people I've got to take care of yesterday when she left the room I looked up at the clock it was 555 I asked my wife I said what greater testimony from the time even on the wall I said in what a way to start the day if a heart patience what's our excuse tonight amen amen she come by just before she went off her and she said I'm gonna pray yeah that they don't let you go home so that we can start these conversations foreign I said you know yesterday was kind of like your shop that brought you back to life I said but you know the doctor told me that they didn't want a blood clot to form inmates foreign just as soon as you remember you take it right then and then you get back on the skin I said because that doctor was looking long term for my help for me salute I said now we gotta look long I said if we're gonna keep you alive I said you've got to get back into the word of God I showed her an app that I had on my phone I said they've got a Verse of the Day applications like just reading that verse I

nurse on contract 809 809 and her time was almost run out yeah you know it seems like that I'd learned to follow the voice of God so that I wouldn't have to have a heart attack but the Lord would just stay forced I want you to walk the floors of that hospital as a nurse I want you to talk to you God help me but be more receptive to heal that every step that I take is where he wants me to go isn't
