me the opportunity to minister to you and I hope that the word will feed all of us amen I'm going to throw an atomic bomb pretty soon so you your seat belts this morning this will be my third message and Michael will stand with a subtitle the two tribulations Revelation 6 1 apyp I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard a SE word the noise I'm sorry not 61 forgive me 6 12 that's what me and you were talking about to the people yeah six and when he had opened the six seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sack cloth of hair and the moon became his blood Daniel 121 and at that time shall Michael stand up Hallelujah the great Prince with standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was the nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everywh one that shall be found written in the book notice that the word shell is mentioned three times on that verse because the word shall means into the future in the future the Lord add His blessings to read the word you may be seated it is this is very delicate and what uh he was talking here in Daniel that it was going to be a time of trouble as we're going to find out it is such a big event that even Joel prophesied about the six Hill it was Isaiah that prophesied about the six and Jesus if you read on Matthew he prophesied of about this time so we see Daniel speak saying this in the Book of Daniel about the end time we see in Daniel chapter 9 verse 21 yay while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening of oblation verse 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring an in Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy to seal up the vision and prophecy verse 2 see Daniel had prophesied these things he saw it in a vision and then they told him to seal it until the end time which the end time is the end of the 70th week why was it sealed this vision and prophecy was for the end time and in that time Michael will stand for the children of thy people which the children of the people was Daniel's people which were the Jews and Jacob's trouble was the Great Tribulation but there is another tribulation St Matthew M 24 21 don't get scared what I'm going to tell you for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be Matthew 2421 I'm sorry 22 and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened the Lord corrected me on this verse remember years ago me and you there were talking there in the cins house we said what does he mean that the days will be short of course somebody said well the that a clock won't have 20 2 4 hours remember we won't mention names and that's why brother Brenham he said don't misplace or dislocate scripture so we said there'll be Great Tribulation and except those days be shortened for the elect sake and know that scripture is compound he was not talking about us our days have not been shorted if you take it by the time he's talking about the Jew here our days have not been T our our days have been l these Rapture should have happened already brother says we're living in borrow time he has given us more days because he's God rich in Mercy and he has given us many days not willing that nobody should perish but that everybody have everlasting life we thought the the end was going to be in 1977 and not dispensation less more than 2,000 years and here we are in 2,000 20 God rich in Mercy amen he's given us time he has given us even though we don't Merit but it says if the days were not shortened no flesh should be saved It's the Great Tribulation the Great Tribulation last three and a half years that's why he shortened those days 144,000 could be saved we used we used to apply that to us but God is revealing the last days amen there shall be Great Tribulation now now give me same Matthew 24:29 immediately after the tribulation of those days now there's another tribulation after the tribulation of those days notice the sicks heal again shall the sun be darkened and the Moon moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heaven should be shaken but notice that tribulation was in the time when General Titus put an army around Jerusalem you're on that rooftop don't go down and get you know and notice he's talking about that tribulation that scripture was a local tribulation it was a tribulation for the Jew but the other one is a worldwide tribulation but noce it affects the Jew both amen notice tribulation what is tribulation tribulation is notice something that causes sorrow suffering distress trouble the Great Tribulation Jacob's trouble it is a tri how many of you in here and in the in the lines in social media how many of you are suffering tribulation you have never seen such l or it's in the whole world so much tribulation the people are scared and it's sadly to say it but I'm going to say it because the Lord told me to say it and if the Lord tells me to say it I'm going to say it I'm not going to hold back even in this church a lot of you are in Tribulation th this Corona virus has put the people in a panic mode they you you go to the stores I'm glad my daughter goes to the store but I heard that the the check checking points were packed with people somebody told me that they went to one of the stores and the line to check out was even to the outside on the sidewalk oh what are we going to do I feel I don't know what that some people in our church are already panicked oh they say we go we cannot find any toilet paper well don't need some much and you have to use so much toilet paper but the the tribulation has hit so many in this church when they're all troubled they eat more the Lord let this happen so you could fast how how many of you fast don't don't you know don't you know that's why they use so much toilet paper I'm so nervous no wonder you use so much toilet paper toilet paper and you isn't correct me Tommy if I'm wrong is fear a demon an evil spirit how many fear in here oh no you I can see down so good he does not move me I I walk every day like you know why I'm sealed with the Holy Spirit and those things don't bother me because I am not a v child I have a father and my father takes care of me yes Corona virus Corona virus Corona virus is a too take what's going to happen in that tribulation it's a toake but we got people this church that are afraid and panic some are so afraid that they won't even come and congregate with us in whom have you believed in whom I have no fear whatsoever but we we have to use caution like our pastor has told us I hope this message wakes you up some of you you know what Caleb I walk each day like it was any other day just doesn't the Bible say that the diseases that he brought on the Egyptians will not H you but in whom have you believed no the great the tribulation that you're troubled maybe some of you you you have gotten Corona virus and the Lord lets it happen as a trial to see what you do as we're going to find out later didn't try to scare you but let's go a little further word is so rich God help us so then it says that the days will be shorten on account of the elect you see brother and elect I am the bride he's talking about the elect which are the 144,000 that's the elect that he's talking about the days will be shortened so they can be saved amen notice St Matthew 243 and he he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world would you like to know would you like to know that's why you come to church for so you can learn Sunday morning is Sunday school you go to school to learn notice when shall this things be where have been where have you been all this time it's here already notice how about the sign of his coming he already came he already came didn't the Bible says that Elijah must first come he already came and you didn't know but he's talking L about his coming he already came the scripture is compound he already came I I got I got you people thinking on that he already came I thought he was coming for us in the Raptor my God help us you then notice remember the scripture is compound first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout let me read it again so you can understand the Lord himself shall descend with a wedding dress is then we're supposed to be the word bright and AR you supposed to dress with the word so he had to come down because he he came for a bride brother says all here in Brom Tabernacle I see a lot of sisters here but only one gets to go home with me so there's many people in the world but the Lord came only for you he only came for you why did he come with a dress and he says notice those that are in Christ will God bring with him and you cannot go to the wedding supper without the wedding dress so he'll descend with a shout a message to get you ready a message to dress you he says and he came with a voice of Archangel which is a voice of Resurrection then the trumpet of God you together the people so they they say brother benam has to come in the tent Ministry in order to do all these three these two because he came with a shout but he still has to do the voice of Archangel and the trumpet of God I know we've taught you this but many times you forget because you are in Tribulation you are in distress you hear too much on the TV you hear too much about Donald Trump and Joe Biden it worries you so much you know what you know who I voted for I voted for Jesus Christ that's who I voted for I was telling the brother Caleb that I have voted only once in my lifetime when I was 21 years old well I'm going to vote I'm 21 years old I voted the same time that brother Brenham voted in 1960 brother Brenham did not vote for JFK for JFK he voted for Nixon foron and me a green horn they didn't know the difference between a bean or a l I voted for Nixon too and so me and brother vam the we voted for the same man and that was the last time I voted you see so who so who do you V for and and the people are in such tribulation they they they even killed you know they they they pay them millions of dollars and they fix the machines and this and that that's how John Kennedy beat Nixon the FBI founded FBI in the state of California every time you pull the lever and voted for Nixon automatically you were voting for JFK so you see how rotten because Satan is aead of all [Music] politics so why does brother B I have to come to give the voice of Archangel come in a tent Ministry you know what I am the tth ministry I am the tth ministry the voice of Archangel The Voice arang brother Brandon when he was here he did all three of them he brought the message to the child remember voice of Archangel is a voice of Resurrection when you all and myself not dead in denomination and voice woke us up come out of her my people it was a spiritual resurrection and he sounded the trumpet what was a trumpet for to gather the people look at you from different walks of life and you're right here the trumpet gathered all of us amen notice but you know what the glory of God let's read s Matthew 24 30 and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then and all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory the glory is coming in great Glory he already came in great Glory he did well where in the Old Testament where was The Glory it was hidden that of Glory was hid behind V so where is the glory now it is right here it is right here is it is right here there it is a glory in our pastor there's a glory in this brother tell you people hidden behind human skin now the glory that's why they don't believe us it used to be to go into the holy of holy it had to be a veil that only the high priest could go in and the veil of a king you know what the veil is human flesh that's a veil now human flesh is ail now amen the glory of God and that is what blinds the people I noticed when I officiated the funeral of my wife's niece you they had the service there at the Catholic Church here in Las when four days before she died she says I love you Uncle and I would like for you to officiate my funeral they didn't want me there the the sons and the the family they took her to the Catholic church and disobeyed her orders and one of the relatives you know says L I'm going to let you speak at the over there the cemetery well when we got to the cemetery here comes another PRI not the one that officiated on that holy church that they call the holy they had another one a big heavy with a big cross and a big robe and once he was through with all his mumbo jumbo they he was going to start to so they could put the remains there in the in the where they made the burial and the mor teach and they came and and and and and the nephew one nephew said wait a minute wait a minute we want this man to speak oh so there were nothing but Catholics all around there was no nobody from church yeah there only from the church was I don't even know if my yeah my daughter was there and so here I was and I saw demons left and right and they look me up and down the flesh yeah blinds the people they to let let him speak in this funeral we know L when he was a drunker and a I never did drugs I smoke regular cigarettes and I drank a lot of beers I didn't like K is still it was SE I was out in the world that's what they were seeing I could feel the spirit oh but the Catholic priest with a big robe and he walk go like he was 's Mother you know like he was a multimillion gantic cross on him see theyre holy and that's why the people follow that he must be a man of God But Here Comes an next here comes a an ex drunker whatever you want to call them but they had to hear the gospel yeah I got in front of those people you people might say what is he doing here and I said you know why I'm here you people I was telling them that way because the one that was dead I said she told me four days before she died that she wanted me to officiate for funeral and the two sons and other relatives just B their head they went against her orders or desires you know but I'm going to tell you one thing you people that are here you you you drive nice cars and Liv in nice homes and buy insurance good insurance for your cars and your houses and then you buy insurance so they can bury you I said how many of you and I raised up the Bible how many of you have insurance not to go into the grave I have insurance that will take you out of and I looked at all of them I says I give unto you this in insurance without price or money do you think they took the advice they never invited me to their house again birds of the the same feather they flock together I see nothing but Eagles here so we fly together but there's a bunch of road runners also I didn't say here yeah no you're you're Eagles because you're here where the cus is the Eagles will gather notice it blinds the people he blinded those people notice that this me message could not come until now because it was never in the condition that it's now the Bible says as it was in the days of lot brother Brenham said lot was a type of America and where was Lot in [Music] Sodom yet in lot there was righteousness and the problem was he was mixing with those people even though he had righteous I ask you people especially you youth there is rightous in you but a lot of you are mixing with some thus say the [Music] Lord and everybody has to search their life you know there is righteousness no so we better watch out abah never went to Sodom not here maybe he's maybe he if you're hearing me Diego during the fellowship home I'm going to give you flowers now I don't believe in giving flowers to a dead person how many many times have I said that behind the ppus in silver and here what is a dead person going to do with flowers you put them on top of the grave and one day or two days later they're dry brother says give them flowers while they're still alive so Sogo I'm going to give you your flowers to me to me that message Wednesday was the best message you've ever preached what a beautiful message God bless you and give you more my brother cuz you are my brother Diego and I love you and your wife and your family notice in the times of lot Abraham never went into Sodom but you say but you still live in Sodom you say if lot is a type of Sodom or of of America which America is s so we live here you're also mixing with them no no no no I'm not mixing with them I live in Heavenly places I'm not mixing with them those the foolish virgin and them are mixing with them not the bride we are in Heavenly places Omar amen we are in Heavenly places God wants separators and Moses told Aaron take me a heer which is a female cow that's red and no spots has never been yolked and this heer had to be killed by the priest before the whole Congregation of Israel and all of it had to be burned outside the camp to make what Waters of Separation are you people Waters of Separation does it Waters pertain to people and you must separate that's why my body might be here in Sodom I don't mix with them I have separated I am Waters of separation and in notice and in the fire they put three things Scarlet that ship's wool died with blood they put CER wood Cedar Cedro is in this Church Cedar Hills Cedar Hills notice Cedar speaks of the cross the C CU it it is white with red streaks and white speaks of righteousness of the Cross how can that be when the cross was a curse but red streaks it speaks of the blood that made it righteous and then come and with hup then they would burn it together and they got the Ashes to make water of Separation it watched the unbeliever for purification and he was sprinkled with the edges that's why the Apostle Paul said that he might sanctify and clean us with the washing of the Water by the word he CHS that something died that the ashes of this heer it died for his sins the Lord told Moses even all the heers throughout history are lost yours will remain forever the priest who was to burn a new heer was sprinkled with the ashes of the first he they would before it ran out they got the ashes a little of the ashes of the first C and put and leave it there and then they got the ashes of the new C of that's why the old was mixed with the new so why a heer to remind them of the golden C that they worshiped in the desert and the heer the mother C was cleaning the field of her of her child notice from the time of Moses to the destruction of the second temple there have been nine heers they said that in the days of the 10th heerah will come so they pray that's why they pray and cry at the Wailing Wall so then they say that Jesus Christ has to come and do these three things that we talked about acts 319 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blooded out when the times are refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord you know Caleb all through the years that I have studied Tommy I would see this even when I was a pastor of the apostolic church I couldn't make heads or tails of that verse or that word oh yeah refreshing was a cold beer refresh yeah or you get a soda and especially during the summer it's real refreshing but in the apostolic church we never preached in English only in Spanish my mother my my mother and and all and everyone there what they know about English but you know what Jonathan Jonathan in the Spanish Bible it's says in in in the Spanish Bible it says time of refreshing or I I see two meanings there something can be refreshing ref William I mean it's probably put in the freezer or refrigerated so you know what I would do it would go over my head but I had a good tutor my T first tutor was Bernie Garcia you brothers and sisters are hearing me in Phoenix Pho the two great Apostles amen were my tutors ber Garcia and Tomas Bernie Garcia Manas perz so I went and put it on the screen refreshing in the Greek an anoi that's Greek oh an Rachel last night what does he have to do with refreshing Hallelujah so refreshing is what do you have the you don't have it the okay refreshing let's you know what let's finish uh that verse in in the book of Acts in chapter 3 so we can see what that word [Music] means verse 20 he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God had spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets in the world begin refreshing Ori means patience he he what was taught to them and what he was saying here I hope it doesn't happen to any of you there will be times the refriger of refreshing there will be times of refreshing and if you're not standing in the word of God you're going to fall by the right side because the word this word notice what it means to have patience to endure to hold up against things and to be longsuffering from behind this Pulpit treasure it in your heart in your soul so when the times of Corona virus come and the trials and tribulations you can endure cuz there will be times refreshing there'll be time you're not all the time going 100 miles an hour or whatever and you don't have to raise your hands how many times a week do you feel down in the Dum I don't feel too good I don't know how bills we're down in the D don't you have a father that will provide I've never seen the righteous forsaken they even putting the money in the coins God We Trust oh no I trust in Benjamin Franklin or Alexander Hamilton or I've heard that many times noce ah long suffering so I'm going to my time is going fast and I'm going to skip a lot of this best me you have to skip but notice there's a part here that I okay I'm going to skip all this here the son of man okay the church had to go through justification Luther through sanctification Wesley baptism of the Holy Spirit the Pentecostal go right into the Perfection of the son of man that's when husband and wife will be the self-same person God will be so manifested into his bride because both of them will be the same so then Jesus when he returns back to his church in physical form in the people as in the way of of being a prophet brother Bram in the message Jehovah believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and believe me to be his Prophet will
