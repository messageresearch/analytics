[25:18] so very
[25:24] [Music]
[25:27] soon
[25:45] how's everybody doing this evening
[25:50] nice
[25:54] now
[25:57] I would like to thank the pastor for
[25:58] giving me the opportunity
[26:01] for letting me preacher
[26:05] and just to share with you guys this
[26:07] thought that I had on Wednesdays
[26:13] now what my thought is about Redemption
[26:19] and what it is
[26:21] so now I would like to ask you guys a
[26:24] question yeah
[26:27] what is redemption is redemption
[26:32] anybody again
[26:35] you may be seated too
[26:40] well
[26:41] guess I'm here to help
[26:44] well
[26:46] Redemption if you search it up
[26:53] it means to regain a possession
[26:57] or an object
[26:59] o
[27:03] through a price for impression
[27:06] now aura
[27:09] if we split the word redemption in half
[27:15] we get redeemed
[27:19] foreign now I would like you guys to
[27:23] imagine that day on Calvary
[27:27] when I save your diet
[27:31] now I would like you guys to just paint
[27:33] that picture of him getting nailed on
[27:35] the cross
[27:39] when he was bruised
[27:43] when he was whipped
[27:45] it was love who drove him to do that is
[27:51] and when he did that he knew that he was
[27:54] paying the price for all of our
[27:56] redemptions
[28:02] now
[28:03] now that we know that it took Jesus's
[28:06] death to purchase our Redemption
[28:15] now brother banham also does say that if
[28:18] there's no death there is no Redemption
[28:25] so
[28:27] now if we sink in a little bit deeper
[28:32] profundo this also means that we need to
[28:36] die in order to get our redempt to claim
[28:38] our redemptions
[28:44] now
[28:45] I want you guys to think about
[28:48] that you guys are redeemed
[28:53] I want you guys to notice how lucky you
[28:56] are to be redeemed
[28:59] because Angels don't know what it's like
[29:02] to be redeemed hasta Los Angeles
[29:06] now I would like to tell you guys about
[29:09] this little story now about
[29:14] um the violin in the Poncho the violina
[29:18] now one day there was this violin in a
[29:21] poncho is
[29:25] now no one wanted to buy it it was
[29:28] worthless
[29:31] in this case it didn't have God it is
[29:37] now until one day
[29:39] a violin master came into the shop
[29:43] um
[29:45] now
[29:47] when the violin Master played this
[29:49] violini
[29:52] now he played this beautifully and
[29:55] people wanted to buy it
[29:59] and I believe that that violin master
[30:02] was God
[30:05] because he gave us value because
[30:09] without him we are nothing
[30:14] now I would like to talk to the youth a
[30:16] little here
[30:19] now what colors or what is the color of
[30:23] redemption
[30:37] red okay
[30:38] so correct
[30:40] now
[30:45] now
[30:46] I have another question
[30:50] we know red and red is in God's eyes is
[30:53] white
[30:56] we already know that Redemption is one
[30:59] red yes
[31:02] what is the other end
[31:12] the youth anybody
[31:20] the sin now it's not the blood of the
[31:25] sin
[31:27] the sinner's blood is it it doesn't have
[31:30] any power
[31:35] now
[31:37] what I found very interesting location
[31:41] is that salvation is also red too
[31:45] that's another red is
[31:48] and we know that the sin is red
[31:54] so I'll be finishing with this now how
[31:57] many here believe that they have been
[31:58] redeemed by God
[32:03] how many feel like if it wasn't a
[32:06] coincidence that you guys have been
[32:07] redeemed
[32:13] would like to thank God
[32:16] yeah

[32:29] praise the Lord

[33:53] thank you for having me and I am a
[33:57] Storyteller
[34:02] what he said but okay we have another
[34:05] Storyteller
[34:06] his brother Boaz here
[34:10] Boaz Boaz has a story for us would you
[34:12] mind coming up Boaz telling us your
[34:14] story about
[34:21] all right so why not I went into my
[34:25] dad's office one day
[34:27] and I said dad you're probably gonna get
[34:30] a note home sent from school
[34:39] and he's like why what happened
[34:42] so I was standing in line to get my food
[34:45] from the cafeteria
[34:48] and I looked to my left and I see a big
[34:51] bowl of apples
[34:54] well Manzana
[34:57] and there was a no that said
[35:00] only take one God is watching
[35:05] so I go further down the line
[35:08] and I see a big bowl of cookies
[35:14] so I decided
[35:18] and it said it is here
[35:21] take all you want God's watching the
[35:23] apples
[35:32] huh
[35:35] that was awesome brother Bo thank you
[35:40] we have the
[35:41] talento we have got the talent yeah
[35:45] [Laughter]
[35:47] oh man I love that thank you brother
[35:50] well let's get started we got 20 minutes
[35:53] starting now I learned that from you
[35:56] guys
[35:57] I'm just kidding I was like oh
[36:00] I got quiet in it
[36:04] you are the light of the world
[36:06] that's the that's the message title I
[36:09] have
[36:10] and if there was a subtitle
[36:13] it would be how to deal with bullies
[36:19] everybody has a bully
[36:24] yeah yeah that's good
[36:36] or they might be just generally out in
[36:39] the world
[36:39] right it might be a church yeah I hope
[36:43] not
[36:44] it's better okay no but they might be
[36:47] and they might even be at home
[36:50] what are you talking about
[36:53] well it's okay don't panic don't freak
[36:55] out yet
[36:57] that comes later
[37:00] right now we relax with the story
[37:03] there's a lot of bullies out there
[37:06] right I even experienced the bully a
[37:09] couple of weeks ago
[37:12] and I hadn't even left my house for two
[37:14] minutes
[37:16] it had been exactly 45 seconds
[37:20] and I backed out of my driveway
[37:23] and I went down to the stop sign at the
[37:25] end of my street well uh a La Parada yes
[37:30] and this car came zooming by yes
[37:33] but before they hit me and Liz
[37:37] they slammed on their brakes
[37:43] and they got mad at me
[37:45] I was stopped what did I do Yahoo I
[37:50] don't know but they were mad at me for
[37:51] it
[37:52] I know what they were saying I'm glad I
[37:55] don't but
[37:58] she did not look happy
[38:00] she was very wordy with what she was
[38:03] saying
[38:04] all right he's very wordy
[38:09] so we all face a bully at some point
[38:13] even sometimes it's ourselves
[38:16] I think that's the most common boy
[38:21] but the important thing is
[38:23] to identify who the real bully is
[38:28] the biggest goalie of them all who can
[38:31] tell me
[38:34] it's a hard pick okay I'm gonna pick
[38:36] whoever raised their hands right now
[38:37] later for something else we'll go with
[38:39] you buddy because you were first
[38:43] it says Satan I agree
[38:47] he's a big bully right
[38:49] he likes to tell us things
[38:52] and that's why when we our biggest
[38:54] enemies
[38:56] not really
[38:59] but he likes to put thoughts in her head
[39:03] you can't do that
[39:06] you can't do this
[39:13] lady
[39:16] right that's how it sounds it's just ugh
[39:19] right sometimes it comes to people that
[39:22] we thought were friends
[39:24] family and so on Familia Etc but here's
[39:28] the important thing
[39:30] devil can't do anything to you
[39:33] unless God says
[39:37] so if you think about it like that
[39:40] takes us to our second story
[39:44] where this is a common story that
[39:46] happens all the time
[39:47] the devil walks up to God
[39:51] and he says hey can I pick on that one
[39:57] and God says yeah see go for it let's
[40:03] see what you got
[40:04] because I know that guy
[40:08] he is awesome
[40:11] so you can try to bully them all you
[40:13] want
[40:16] you can hate them all you want
[40:19] but he's gonna hit you right back with
[40:22] love
[40:25] boy boy
[40:28] you guys might not know that reference
[40:30] but it was good this one this morning
[40:32] right so that's important I want to read
[40:35] you guys these scriptures
[40:38] Matthew 5 10-16
[40:43] and I went through and I simplified it
[40:45] for you okay
[40:47] so I took the big words made them small
[40:52] so you can read it with me but it's
[40:54] going to sound a little different for me
[40:55] okay
[40:58] so we're going to start with 5 10.
[41:02] blessed are those who suffer to be
[41:04] justified
[41:08] for their justification
[41:11] is the Kingdom of Heaven
[41:14] blessed are you who are defamed
[41:18] or taunted
[41:24] and have people be mean to you
[41:28] and say evil things
[41:30] Jesus
[41:40] be cheerful
[41:43] and jump for joy yeah
[41:47] you have a big reward for you in heaven
[41:50] is
[41:51] for they were mean to the prophets
[41:54] before you
[41:56] Isn't that cool
[41:58] did you know that when when people are
[42:01] mean to you that means that they are
[42:03] doing what they did to the prophets
[42:05] years ago
[42:09] so you're right there with them
[42:11] imagine those prophets
[42:16] and you're standing right there getting
[42:18] the same treatment
[42:20] but that's okay because we're together
[42:24] I think it's cool I thought that was
[42:26] cool
[42:29] you are the salt of the earth
[42:33] kind of a strange saying is
[42:37] but it's basically
[42:39] you guys are the flavor
[42:43] [Music]
[42:44] you know that you know salt when you put
[42:46] it on meat
[42:48] it brings out the flavor
[42:50] that's you guys you guys make the world
[42:54] great El Mundo
[42:58] if you were to lose your saltiness
[43:03] then how would the Earth be salted
[43:07] imagine for a second a world without you
[43:10] in it
[43:12] I'm gonna be honest I don't like it no I
[43:15] don't like it I like you here
[43:17] I really like you here
[43:20] you all are great
[43:23] you are welcome
[43:25] than uh if one of you isn't here I don't
[43:28] like it
[43:29] one of them isn't here I don't like it
[43:33] and even if you do have to go this is
[43:36] the Dennis gate there's going to be more
[43:38] salt to take your place
[43:39] because we all
[43:42] through all times
[43:44] are the salt of the earth
[43:46] so it's a good thing
[43:49] salt that isn't salty is worthless
[43:57] under the foot of men
[44:03] ye are the light of the world
[44:08] you live in a dark time right
[44:11] you ever walked outside when the moon
[44:13] isn't out
[44:15] in the middle of the forest
[44:19] it's scary
[44:22] our pastor knows he's a hunter he knows
[44:26] all you see is nothing
[44:29] but sometimes you got a little
[44:31] Candlelight
[44:34] yeah or flashlight
[44:38] interna
[44:44] we have a light right
[44:47] and
[44:49] it's important to have that it's
[44:50] important but it can be scary in these
[44:52] dark times right
[44:55] but that's okay
[44:57] because the city on a hill can't hide
[45:03] it's very obvious
[45:05] men don't light a candle and hide it
[45:10] [Music]
[45:11] is
[45:19] they put it on a Candlestick
[45:22] and it gives light to everyone in the
[45:24] house
[45:26] let your light shine like that before
[45:30] men
[45:33] so they can see good works
[45:36] and glorify your father God
[45:42] okay
[45:46] gotten through the scriptures you can
[45:48] wake back up again
[45:51] no not that one okay we'll move on to
[45:53] the next joke it's
[45:56] it's really important because it's
[46:01] if you understand what the light is
[46:04] it's Jesus right it's Jesus Jesus is the
[46:07] light as who says you are a little Jesus
[46:11] and when God allows the bully to come
[46:14] your way
[46:17] trying to do one of two things
[46:20] either a justify you ah justification
[46:26] show them that your God is alive
[46:29] both are really good
[46:33] that light or that City on a Hill
[46:37] Monte we have our next story is very
[46:41] short but my whole life I noticed
[46:45] when I'd walk around
[46:48] people would stare
[46:52] you may have noticed this happened to
[46:54] you too
[46:55] if you have
[46:57] you're not alone
[46:59] because it's very weird but it happens
[47:02] right and it's very obvious yes because
[47:06] if you see a light
[47:07] on a hill
[47:10] on a hill
[47:12] in the middle of the night people are
[47:16] going to go wow
[47:17] that is the city and it is on a hill
[47:21] in the middle of the night
[47:24] that I can make very clear
[47:26] that's the exact reaction I used to hear
[47:28] is
[47:31] yeah walking through the store someone
[47:33] goes
[47:34] foreign
[48:17] [Music]
[48:28] and that's okay let's dive in that's
[48:31] good that's when I would say it's even
[48:33] healthy
[48:35] we might be bullied the most
[48:42] you might wonder why
[48:45] but just remember that it's because God
[48:49] said
[48:50] go right ahead
[48:52] they know exactly how to beat
[48:56] in case you don't know though I'm going
[49:00] to tell you how it's very very simple
[49:02] are you ready
[49:09] okay one last time if I hit the brakes
[49:12] and you guys fly out this is on you okay
[49:13] so buckle up let's go
[49:15] all right there we go we're buckled in
[49:17] okay now we hit the gas all right so how
[49:19] do we do it let's go to Matthew 5 44.
[49:27] I'll just read it but I say unto you
[49:31] love your enemies
[49:34] bless them that curse you and this is
[49:37] do good to them that hate you I said
[49:42] and pray for them which despitefully is
[49:52] so
[49:54] that's how you let your light shine
[49:59] If someone becomes your enemy yeah
[50:02] and they say I don't like you because of
[50:05] reasons
[50:09] and you say that's okay
[50:12] I love you because my God said too
[50:17] and that's enough for me yes
[50:20] you'd be surprised how well that works
[50:28] it's so rare these days
[50:31] that one act of kindness
[50:34] is enough to make people stop in their
[50:36] tracks
[50:38] I've seen it happen
[50:41] someone was mad at me
[50:47] and I looked at them and I went
[50:50] and they were
[50:55] and it was like their whole life got
[50:56] changed for a second they said what
[50:58] happened
[50:59] yes
[51:00] the programmed reaction is
[51:06] and this one goes
[51:09] and then they both just scream loud
[51:11] enough until nobody can hear each other
[51:14] don't do that smile Adam give him a hug
[51:19] or don't if they're being really scared
[51:24] and love them
[51:27] to close I'll tell you a story
[51:30] about a light that I keep on from now on
[51:33] about a light I keep on
[51:37] kind of a scary story
[51:41] scarier because it's true but
[51:45] uh about two weeks ago
[51:48] I was at home
[51:50] I was asleep
[51:52] it's about two in the morning
[51:55] and my doorbell goes
[51:58] [Music]
[51:59] in me
[52:04] he's awesome
[52:06] he is good at his job
[52:09] so the doorbell goes
[52:13] and I went as stiff as a board yes even
[52:17] yes so yeah I I thought it was a ghost
[52:20] it's okay but in reality I was paler
[52:23] than whatever ghost it would have been
[52:25] fantasma I was scared
[52:29] I saw cam the man of the house
[52:34] gotta get it together okay
[52:37] whatever's happening right now okay I am
[52:40] here to handle it is
[52:43] I pull out my baton I have a baton by my
[52:46] bed it's like give me
[52:49] like a police patrol it's like yeah
[52:54] and I'm like
[52:55] yes please text your mom and see if it's
[52:58] hurt right
[53:02] I opened the door
[53:05] pitch black
[53:06] my whole house is dark there is not a
[53:10] light on inside or out
[53:12] and suddenly
[53:16] a calm comes over me
[53:18] and I go you know it's okay the eagle I
[53:22] don't know why but I think it's okay
[53:26] I'm glad here we go if there's anybody
[53:30] in here
[53:31] I tell you what
[53:33] we'll learn today right
[53:37] walk out stand in my kitchen ready
[53:43] what's funny is this isn't how you hold
[53:45] the Baton
[53:46] but this is
[53:51] don't know what I'm doing but I walk out
[53:53] and it's nothing
[53:59] million thoughts are running through my
[54:01] head
[54:02] but I relax
[54:05] turn on the lights
[54:07] okay then I go check out the doors
[54:12] so I think that's really strange
[54:16] because if there was someone in here
[54:19] I don't think they would have rang the
[54:21] doorbell
[54:22] but also I would have found them by now
[54:25] so I go to the front door
[54:29] and this is the scary part is
[54:40] about as silent as this
[54:42] and I look back and I look at the clock
[54:49] and it's wide open the door wasn't
[54:52] locked
[54:53] yeah the front door
[54:56] to my castle
[54:58] was completely compromised
[55:03] and I locked it immediately
[55:07] and I said Thank You Lord
[55:11] because nothing bad was there
[55:14] it was dark and it was scary
[55:17] but I turned the lights on
[55:19] and the door that I had
[55:23] was compromised
[55:25] but it was brought to my attention that
[55:27] that was the case
[55:32] and I fixed it
[55:35] so I've determined that
[55:38] the Holy Spirit came and rang my
[55:40] doorbell
[55:42] mostly because
[55:44] after I thought about it
[55:47] if it was a criminal
[55:50] it wouldn't have given me a friendly
[55:53] they wouldn't have given me a friendly
[55:56] hello
[55:58] [Music]
[56:01] so I keep the light on in the front of
[56:03] my house from now on so thank God
[56:06] because I trust in the Lord
[56:10] but I also want my lights on in case
[56:12] someone wants to try to test me
[56:18] and that's physical
[56:20] and spiritual yes thank you all so much

[56:26] fantasticos and God blessed
