========================================

now the first church age was the church of ephesus now the first church age started about 1853 when paul established the church in in ephesus the angel of the first church was saint paul he founded it god's messenger the first church the ephesian church the works of the church what god condemned them for was worse without love the reward was a tree of life a the city of ephesus one of the three great cities of asia often called the third city of christian faith first was jerusalem second antioch and third episode c a city of great commerce and trade e the government was roman [Music] as the language was greek [Music] and ephesus was known for its beauty ephesus means the very name ephesus means let go relax backslid called by god the backslidden church god god acknowledge first their works their labor and their patience god rebuked their living leaving their first love for backsliding and for no longer bearing life [Music] ephesus was not a deceived church it failed itself but not continuing in perfect love summary of ephesus fruits without love led to apostasy the promises [Applause] paradise promise to the overcomers of the saints of ephesus in the church age given to the tree of life now we see this at the beginning pentecost walking around the same great god the same great signs were to take place all down through these ages because he walked amongst each age blessing one his people that's the symbol in his name i want you to watch this as we go through the church this church had jesus name and this church lost it now the first verse what's he doing he's saluting them [Music] haunted on to the angel of the church of ephesus the john write these things said he that holds seven stars in his right hand who walk up in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks it's a salute now the second verse and the third verse he commands them i know thy works and our labors and uh patience how the thou cannot bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and have found them liars amen see that apostasy had already begun to set in this first age false teachers rise up people who are teaching wrong contrary to the scripture trying to bring in something or add something just don't meddle with god's word just no matter who it hurts or what it hurts just say it anyhow just the way it's rolled there that's the way man we don't need any great something else we don't need any priest or anything to interpret it to us god the holy spirit is the interpreter he gives interpretation see how the church began to get formal during that time they began to kind of break down the people under the inspiration of the holy ghost begin to cause people to come and make fun of them well i have people to make fun of you because you love the lord jesus is a blessing just to have the says they're only when they're cursing you they're bringing god's blessings down on you it backfires on and so is the new person there amen it'll make you do things that you didn't think you'd do stand on the corner be the tambourine or say glory to the god hallelujah praise god well you act like a maniac that's what it done to the apostles that's what i've done to the virgin mary she act like she was drunk she was a mess in society but it takes a mess for life to come out of hey man unless anything dies in rocks life can't come from it unless a man dies and rocks than his own thoughts christ can't get into his heart that's the way the church was born first man how many believes that god is infinite then he cannot change if that was his idea of the church at the beginning that's the kind of church you'll have at the end he cannot change how you go to substitute shaking a hand or sprinkling or or some other things that didn't happen right there paul went over and found people shouting having a big time bunch of badness glorifying god he said that's 19. he said have you received the holy ghost that you believe they said we don't want to be in the holy ghost said how was your time he said we've been baptized for the same man baptized jesus john the baptist said it won't work anymore he got to be baptized over again so he baptized them over again in the name of the lord jesus christ laid his hands upon him and they had the same kind of results that they had at the beginning the holy ghost fell on him they began to speak in tongues and prophesied now as i said to begin before we start off on this again every revival produces a pair of twins one is a spiritual man the other is the natural man of the earth i know thy works and i labor and i'm patient how that cannot bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say that they are apostles and are not and has found them liars he found them to be liars how they know that they work with the word now if a man says that this bible says in hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and for every man said all the days the miracles just passed then that man's a liar now the third first noun all right second and third first now the third verse and is born and had patience and for my namesake has labored and has not fainted or my name did you know what they had patience labored for what [Music] his name if you have to do something you can't do in jesus name let alone i'm going to talk about the complaint now in the fourth chapter the fourth verse brothers nevertheless i am somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love you left that love that you once had for them good old-fashioned holy ghost needing and you're beginning to kind of slide backwards into that farm won't come in with a father and a nonsense see if god had that against this church he's got it against sacrifice yeah amen because you left your first love i've got it against you but where's that first love you want to have where's that joy i used to have because david once cried oh lord restore to me the joy of my salvation words i'm all night prayer meetings and tears on your cheeks my goodness the bible is even justine young cockwebs on it the fifth first warning remember and repent see remember therefore from witch tower and fall and where did you come from from pentecost you fell down to where you are now backsliding and repent and do thy first words go back to pentecost again or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove the candlestick out of h.i.s see who it is don't you his please accept our repent you got a pastor that really tells you the truth of your honor worship god realizing that you're going to be lost if you don't see you bring a reproach up upon the cause of christ isn't that right don't we do it the bootleggers ain't hurt in the church [Music] isn't that it is the prostitutes hurting the church it's the people who profess to be christians who hurt the church but this thou has they had something in it now what could they have that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelodeons which i also hate nickelodeon come from the word in our cko nikko which means to conquer or to overthrow nickel ladies overthrow or conquer the laity what caused that then the nickelodeon bring in a bunch of man to twist up the scripture make a denomination can't let god move in right there we want to be right oh my it's a serious saying brother we've got to get this thing right we'll never be able to have a church until god gets a foundation laying on he'll never build his church upon a bunch of nonsense and he has to come on his word or he won't come at all amen right on his word now let's see if [Music] [Music] god hates an organization people say i see them speaking down that still don't mean they got the holy ghost all right i hear him shout that still don't mean they got the holy ghost the holy ghost is alive amen he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth unto the churches to him that overcometh i will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god now look friends here's the way you overcome first you have to overcome then you can eat the fruit amen he was a tree of life what did he say how did he fix it repeat every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the release of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost an eternal prescription it's for you and your children this will last all down to every churches give it to everyone that's where you got so many dead churches so there any good members you're an antidote and taking so much away from it so the prescription itself at all it won't even heal nothing shaking hands and joining churches and sprinkles that's not the description that's dead if you want life won't the holy ghost follow what god said do you take the prescription that's exactly what he said don't add to it or take away from it then here comes the revelation right over he said whoever will take away or add to the same will be taking his part out of the book of mines oh my that's the main doctor oh i'm loving don't you
