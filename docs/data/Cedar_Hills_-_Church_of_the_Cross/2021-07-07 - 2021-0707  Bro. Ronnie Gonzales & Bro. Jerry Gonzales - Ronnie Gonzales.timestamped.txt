[38:30] here
[38:40] james chapter 3 verse 5 even so
[38:45] the tongue is a little member and
[38:48] posted great thinks behold how
[38:52] great a little matter a little
[38:55] fire candle is
[39:02] revelations 12 10
[39:05] and he heard a loud voice saying in
[39:07] heaven
[39:08] that was from salvation and strength
[39:12] and the kingdom of our god and the power
[39:15] of his christ
[39:16] for the accuser of our brethren is
[39:20] cast down which accuses them before our
[39:23] god
[39:23] day and night
[39:27] [Applause]
[40:14] um it was you know i
[40:17] i'd like to have my little boys come up
[40:19] here
[40:22] you know because as a parent you want to
[40:23] you want your kids and especially you
[40:25] know
[40:25] especially the young men
[40:31] you want to see them voicing the word of
[40:33] god
[40:36] so many things that they could be
[40:37] voicing
[40:40] so many things that they could say
[40:43] you know but we want them voicing the
[40:45] word of god
[40:49] my little boy my oldest one nathan
[40:51] nathan
[40:53] yeah i'll tell you what that little guy
[40:54] when he asked some questions about the
[40:56] word that little guy asked questions
[41:02] things i wouldn't even never even have
[41:03] thought about asking hey
[41:17] like i said the other day when i was
[41:19] baptizing nathan
[41:23] you know as a parent at least at the
[41:26] stage of the journey where i'm at now
[41:27] with my children
[41:31] i don't think there's a greater thing
[41:32] that you can hear your child saying
[41:37] you know there's nothing greater to hear
[41:39] than
[41:40] you know that they want to give their
[41:41] hearts to the lord
[41:46] again so my kids are still little so i
[41:47] don't know if there's something greater
[41:53] i don't think so but but you know
[41:56] they're not nonetheless
[41:58] they've seen embargo you know it's a
[42:00] great great blessing
[42:03] i said this when uh my daughter zoe got
[42:05] baptized
[42:08] and i'll say it again what would this be
[42:10] slightly different
[42:13] two down
[42:30] do the best you can to live a life
[42:32] worthy of the gospel
[42:36] you can talk to them about the word you
[42:37] instead of playing this
[42:40] this is what they should do it's just
[42:42] looking different they said but
[42:44] i never try to force it upon them
[42:48] you know because i don't believe in the
[42:49] first religion
[42:52] i believe it's god that does the calling
[42:55] you know and i and i think i thank him
[42:59] you know that so far he's called two of
[43:01] my children
[43:04] and and to the lord jesus christ be all
[43:06] honor and glory
[43:10] i pray the same thing happens for each
[43:12] and every one of you
[43:15] we're such a great privileged people
[43:17] amen
[43:21] are you privileged
[43:25] man you know how many how many had a
[43:27] good
[43:28] independence day good for them
[43:33] you know you know i to all respect to
[43:36] all those that are from other countries
[43:38] can respond you know to maybe those are
[43:42] listening online
[43:45] and i i believe you probably feel the
[43:46] same way about your country
[43:49] you know but i believe that we live in
[43:51] the greatest country in the world
[44:22] are you from a better country this
[44:24] afternoon
[44:28] amen
[44:34] are you convinced that they're convinced
[44:36] i'm going to say that by faith yes
[44:39] [Music]
[44:43] you know but we again we come from a
[44:45] better country
[44:48] we don't look so much to what's going on
[44:49] here
[44:52] but we look we look to our our prize we
[44:54] look to
[44:55] what is coming for us
[45:00] you know we've been getting a lot of
[45:01] blessings from the lord
[45:44] and we rejoice when the youth come up to
[45:46] the front to the altar
[45:50] it's such a refreshing to be able to see
[45:52] you guys do that
[45:55] you know i've said this before and i'm
[45:56] going to say it again
[45:59] you know i'm kind of a guy that kind of
[46:00] talks a little bit like slang
[46:04] my brother jerry that's going to come up
[46:05] here in a minute now he's more proper
[46:07] more
[46:07] women
[46:11] i see my mom says hi
[46:26] myself to the people i don't want to put
[46:28] a put on right
[46:30] now
[46:37] i'm trying to be myself no matter where
[46:38] i'm at
[46:40] no important
[47:01] you know but youth it's been such such
[47:02] so refreshing to see you guys up here
[47:07] you see you up here and everybody here
[47:09] you know crying
[47:12] wanting to receive of the lord
[47:16] and receiving from the lord
[47:19] youth us as us us ministers nosotros
[47:22] ministers
[47:25] [Music]
[47:50] you know don't don't be don't be don't
[47:53] don't get offended with this
[47:56] but don't stop just because you're in
[47:57] his presence
[48:01] being in his presence isn't good enough
[48:04] to present
[48:17] have you been in the presence of
[48:18] almighty god
[48:30] does it still throw your heart back when
[48:31] you're in this presence
[48:44] [Laughter]
[48:46] they don't believe because bombings
[48:47] aren't very good right now
[48:50] but i guarantee you since it's been such
[48:52] a long time
[48:55] they're gonna the cowboy fans are gonna
[48:56] be going crazy
[48:57] [Music]
[49:00] it's gonna do you rejoice being in his
[49:04] presence
[49:08] amen but again
[49:11] being in his presence isn't good enough
[49:13] church solomon is
[49:47] so it means if there's if there's some
[49:49] if something in the natural
[49:53] god's going to typify that in the
[49:55] spiritual somehow
[50:10] different animals
[50:36] probably part of the reason why the
[50:37] pastor put you in the front
[50:41] because when you're sitting in the back
[50:43] or in the middle
[50:46] there's a lot of distractions that go on
[50:48] so that's just almost
[50:49] distracting so a lot of times there's a
[50:51] lot of movement that goes on
[50:54] and parents let's do the best we can to
[50:55] keep the getting up during the preaching
[50:57] to a minimum
[51:02] let's reference the sanctuary a little
[51:03] bit
[51:06] sometimes the parents are worse than the
[51:08] kids
[51:10] but you have the best seat in the house
[51:15] and what do you get to see without
[51:18] distractions
[51:20] other
[51:33] sunday morning
[51:44] and wednesday afternoon
[51:51] so when the holy spirit is here and the
[51:54] word is being brought forth
[51:59] because the natural absolutely types of
[52:00] spiritual absolutely
[52:30] i've been a person i've always loved to
[52:32] see the rain gust
[52:34] i love to see the lightning my wife
[52:37] thinks i'm kind of boring
[52:38] sometimes yeah i like to drive
[52:42] it to a dark place and just watch the
[52:43] lightning when it's
[53:13] the lady to the back of me
[53:17] she's standing outside it's just coming
[53:19] down and she's just being rained upon it
[53:25] what you doing
[53:45] amen so so you know i
[53:48] i i have a pretty nice backyard
[53:53] i think my grass is really nice i have
[53:54] really nice flowers you think of those
[53:56] flores
[53:57] you know i go every night and i water my
[53:59] flowers
[54:02] they get green and the flowers come out
[54:06] the grass grows
[54:11] but there ain't nothing that beats
[54:13] rainwater
[54:16] you can get out there with the water
[54:17] hose and you can water it you step past
[54:20] and it grows
[54:42] nothing will make you flower like the
[54:43] holy ghost
[55:52] if marvel is planted inside of it marvel
[55:55] marvel marvel
[56:40] what kind of life are we harboring
[56:41] inside of this earth
[56:56] and the
[57:25] when the rain begins to fall youth
[57:29] don't be happy just because you turn
[57:30] green
[57:34] because it looks like there's life okay
[57:37] because the earth will also produce
[57:39] farms and thistles
[57:42] yes
[57:46] and you gotta pull them out quick in
[57:47] tennis
[57:50] in my house on
[58:06] is
[58:33] i'm walking inside my house and my it's
[58:35] like ah
[58:39] what happened to all these they're
[58:40] crying because they got a sticker in
[58:41] their foot
[58:46] it takes a specialist to get rid of
[58:48] those things
[58:51] it takes a certain chemical to spray on
[58:53] them so it can kill them
[58:59] all these little things is goat heads
[59:17] amen that they're a little brown
[59:21] so there are the little cracks where you
[59:23] don't see estonians
[59:27] the rain falls that little goat is a
[59:30] tiny little crack that you don't see
[59:34] a place where you think it's taken care
[59:35] of don't need two pieces
[59:38] and all of a sudden little go ahead
[59:40] comes up
[59:43] i used to hate to pour weeds when i was
[59:44] a kid
[59:50] but you have to do it if not you get an
[59:52] infestation
[59:57] and although it's green it looks like it
[59:58] has life
[1:00:02] all you do is cause harm to people say
[1:00:05] that again all you do is cause harm to
[1:00:06] people
[1:00:10] what else comes after the rain kemos
[1:00:12] benedict
[1:00:14] after it rains we live in a place where
[1:00:16] there's a lot of mosquitoes right
[1:00:21] and these it's spiritually speaking
[1:00:25] there's these little demons that come
[1:00:26] around you want to suck your victory
[1:00:28] from you
[1:00:31] they want to suck the very life from you
[1:00:36] and you don't even know it's there it

[1:07:55] sudden you're there driving in your
[1:07:56] vehicle and you're
[1:07:57] in the midst of the rain
[1:08:00] well the holy spirit is falling

[1:08:11] be in the presence of god
[1:08:16] did you know satan is in the is in the
[1:08:18] presence of god day and night

[1:15:24] tradition of your fathers
[1:15:32] [Music]

[1:16:20] obeying the truth

[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:28] yes
[1:17:43] unto them that call evil good and good
[1:17:46] evil
[1:17:47] and put darkness for light and light for
[1:17:49] darkness
[1:17:50] that put bitter for sweet and sweet for
[1:17:56] better
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:38] you trust me you're gonna
[1:18:52] you gotta do it
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:19:07] i'm assistant come in okay so the
[1:19:08] scripture in isaiah 520.
[1:19:12] it really it struck something with me
[1:19:16] because you look at the world today
[1:19:20] and you can say the united states
[1:19:24] but you look at the world and
[1:19:27] it looks like the whole world is in
[1:19:28] turmoil
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:33] well it doesn't look like it isn't
[1:19:34] turmoil
[1:19:44] pandemic is just the curtain that's
[1:19:46] hiding something behind
[1:19:59] i mean i don't know if there's something
[1:20:00] else but male 1 yes
[1:20:15] our pastor and he said one thing
[1:20:18] he says we're living in the time
[1:20:22] where history is being rewritten
[1:20:27] where every everything that that's that
[1:20:29] that we see in that maybe heroes of the
[1:20:31] past
[1:20:34] people that had a great influence in in
[1:20:36] history
[1:20:39] we see that all those things are being
[1:20:42] they're being attacked they're being
[1:20:44] changed
[1:20:58] but a lot of it is the youth
[1:21:03] because we see a lot of people they we
[1:21:05] see racism in the past
[1:21:10] right a lot of african americans went
[1:21:11] through horrible times
[1:21:40] but you speak to a lot of them or hear a
[1:21:41] lot of them speak
[1:21:45] and they say that there's no such thing
[1:21:47] as this systemic racism that they talk
[1:21:49] about
[1:21:54] and like i said so you have these all
[1:21:55] these young people
[1:21:59] that are causing all this uprising
[1:22:02] so we see they want to defund the police
[1:22:08] this movement of defending the police
[1:22:12] they say they want to take the funds
[1:22:14] that go into the police force
[1:22:18] and they want to put them into different
[1:22:20] programs to help the neighborhoods
[1:22:28] they want to take the authority away
[1:22:29] from the police the ones that hold the
[1:22:31] law
[1:22:35] and they want to put them into the
[1:22:36] neighborhoods
[1:22:39] so that they police themselves
[1:22:42] and i'm not here pushing an agenda
[1:22:46] i'm not here to push an ideology i'm not
[1:22:49] here to preach right or left
[1:23:00] so i don't care what happens out there
[1:23:03] but it's when it tries to seep into the
[1:23:05] church
[1:23:08] that's what as as a ministry we are
[1:23:11] obligated to say
[1:23:14] that's why you see the pastor do what he
[1:23:15] does foreign
[1:23:35] he cares about you that much he cares
[1:23:38] about you that much is important
[1:23:40] that his priority right now
[1:23:43] is to make sure that you get a hold of
[1:23:45] it
[1:24:00] can't serve god and mammon at the same
[1:24:02] time
[1:24:05] so that's why he's doing what he's doing
[1:24:10] so you see all these movements
[1:24:13] everything is upside down from gender
[1:24:18] to i mean just people don't want to work
[1:24:21] i mean it's
[1:24:21] it's crazy
[1:24:24] it's a time that's never been seen
[1:24:26] before
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:56] and that oh it's it's easy on certain
[1:25:00] parts
[1:25:01] it's fascinating but those little cracks
[1:25:03] there like my
[1:25:04] like ronnie was saying
[1:25:20] so you see why why are people why do
[1:25:22] they want to exit the message
[1:26:06] but he wants the little movements to
[1:26:08] rise up
[1:26:11] he wants to see the defunding of the
[1:26:12] ministry
[1:26:18] satan wants to make all of you what's
[1:26:20] called woke
[1:26:34] it makes you aware
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:27:03] so
[1:27:17] but you see that there's a certain
[1:27:18] political party
[1:27:23] politico and they're trying to pass a
[1:27:25] certain pill right now
[1:27:30] and it's to improve infrastructure in
[1:27:31] the united states
[1:27:34] but to pass their hidden agendas
[1:27:39] to pass the other project that they're
[1:27:41] not talking about
[1:27:44] they'll
[1:27:59] infrastructure to include things in the
[1:28:04] bill
[1:28:07] so that way they can pass them
[1:28:11] satan's very smart
[1:28:25] so that's what happens inside the church
[1:28:28] so we try to redefine what you're
[1:28:30] interested in
[1:28:33] oh the message doesn't it doesn't mean
[1:28:34] that
[1:28:37] it really says this
[1:28:40] it's like brotherland preached once why
[1:28:43] do you have to fit the dress
[1:28:47] the word is the dress the dress doesn't
[1:28:50] fit us
[1:29:08] we think we
[1:30:10] let me ask you a question
[1:30:14] god forbid i ever get to that point
[1:30:15] where i'm unteachable
[1:30:18] is
[1:30:32] number one because that's
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:57] there's many things that i wish i could
[1:30:58] take back which is
[1:31:15] okay if he can get you to make a mistake
[1:31:21] he knows it's going to be twice as hard
[1:31:22] for you to get back
[1:31:28] double
[1:32:38] one
[1:33:06] so they want to defund cancel culture
[1:33:12] cancer they want to they want to defund
[1:33:14] the police they want to cancel culture
[1:33:17] you know they want to so really really
[1:33:19] what they want to do is they want to
[1:33:20] take the authority away
[1:33:21] of whoever is in charge
[1:33:25] and put it on themselves
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:32] that way when the word of god comes
[1:34:03] very difficult very deficient but we
[1:34:05] want to push the boundaries
[1:34:08] people want to push the boundaries of
[1:34:10] what the message says
[1:34:15] and one foreign
[1:34:29] but he wants you to be in church with
[1:34:32] all these little uprisings
[1:34:35] in your own mind thinking
[1:34:38] i'm right i know more do they want to
[1:34:42] cancel culture of the message
[1:35:13] you're taking a vital portion out
[1:35:18] the scripture in the message cannot
[1:35:20] contradict
[1:35:22] the scripture and the message
[1:35:26] has the same author
[1:35:30] [Applause]
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:22] that's his worship
[1:37:04] amen amen
[1:37:07] the scripture and the message cannot
[1:37:09] contradict remember that
[1:37:12] it's the same thing i mean because it is
[1:37:15] the word of god
[1:37:17] but what about well then you wonder why
[1:37:20] you get things like
[1:37:21] well god's in certain ones only
[1:37:25] god is only in certain personas
[1:37:30] why are you redefining that
[1:37:38] i promise you that it gets a little bit
[1:37:40] easier okay
[1:37:43] watch this i only need to love certain
[1:37:46] people
[1:37:59] i can have roots of bitterness in my
[1:38:00] heart and still have the holy ghost
[1:38:06] what a farce right then why do we do it
[1:38:09] i have to put my software why do we do
[1:38:12] it
[1:38:13] if we know that it is not right
[1:38:17] why do we do it i can hurt people and
[1:38:19] expect the blessings of god in my life
[1:38:26] and for you maybe my dad is a deacon or
[1:38:28] a minister
[1:38:42] maybe we have our little groups and we
[1:38:43] alienate others
[1:38:47] do we bully in this church do we bully
[1:38:51] in this church and then we wonder why we
[1:38:54] deal with depression
[1:38:56] if
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:10] do we
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:27] we can have all the talent in the world
[1:39:31] but it has to be genuine i can listen to
[1:39:35] precious words
[1:39:38] i can listen to the message all day long
[1:39:42] but dismiss the goal that is telling me
[1:39:47] we must hear and apply the word for the
[1:39:49] right reasons
[1:40:33] but if you're doing it
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:41:16] [Applause]
[1:41:30] you have the revelation
[1:41:44] all the ministries
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:12] so what is it that we have to do what
[1:42:13] are we striving for
[1:42:17] your seatbelts are still off right
[1:42:22] it's simple we have to be born again
[1:42:26] well
[1:42:31] is different it processes differently
[1:42:33] and it's it's sometimes it it's
[1:42:34] it feels like sometimes i'm in and it
[1:42:36] feels like sometimes
[1:42:40] there's just
[1:42:54] i struggle
[1:43:06] like i said it's not we can we
[1:43:22] it's from
[1:43:35] and hold something against our brother
[1:43:37] when i'm when i'm at home
[1:43:47] so what do we have to do we have to be
[1:43:51] born again
[1:43:52] our nature has to change
[1:43:56] our mind nature has to change
[1:43:59] if our nature does not change then we go
[1:44:02] through what's called
[1:44:03] a germination regulatory
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:41] [Applause]
[1:44:56] the dictionary
[1:45:09] um the one with the ize
[1:45:12] what was the link on it i don't know if
[1:45:14] they were able to get it
[1:45:16] if not i'll just have to paraphrase okay
[1:45:24] let's go time is going so what watch
[1:45:26] this okay
[1:45:28] only in the english language
[1:45:31] by no means am i a grammar great grammar
[1:45:34] person
[1:45:35] or a big grammar buff
[1:45:37] [Music]
[1:45:42] when you add i i-z-e to a word at the
[1:45:44] end
[1:45:47] it's a verb forming suffix
[1:45:52] occurring originally in lone words from
[1:45:54] the greek
[1:46:06] within english or in english ize is
[1:46:09] added to rejected the nouns
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:21] this is the part here pay attention to
[1:46:23] this part two
[1:47:34] or
[1:48:32] when a magnet magnetizes a piece of iron
[1:48:34] when the only man magnet
[1:48:36] is the piece of iron becomes a magnet
[1:48:42] makes sense if you can read in between
[1:48:44] the lines it dermatizes
[1:48:58] magnus the magnet now has the same
[1:49:02] properties
[1:49:04] not that piece of iron or as it passes
[1:49:07] and magnetize another piece of iron
[1:49:09] magnetic magnetic field has power to
[1:49:12] become
[1:49:26] we have
[1:49:54] it's possible for you young people
[1:49:58] it's not just for the adults
[1:50:01] for you this message is for you
[1:50:08] watch this observable what does the
[1:50:10] scripture say
[1:50:12] maybe i'll just read it in english
[1:50:17] i don't know let's see the the
[1:50:19] dramatized the magnetized
[1:50:22] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:50:23] word is with god and the word was god
[1:50:25] and the word and the word was god
[1:50:29] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:50:32] but as many as received him to them he
