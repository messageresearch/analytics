amen god bless each one of you that has made the effort to come in we have a dual purpose this morning and there is a convention that will be going on in in lima peru peru and so if you can get this camera over here if you can put it on the people and this is brother brother castro from peru he asked us to minister in his convention me and brother tommy okay we want to get right into the word and if you have your bibles you can open them up to the book of first timothy and this would be the first chapter and the 17th verse this will be the message this is the end number three with the subtitled the immortal realms immortalis pray that it will bless you amen it reads like this now unto the king eternal now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honor and glory forever and ever amen can we all say amen it means so be it amen okay god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated we pray that this would bless you this morning especially greet everyone that's online god bless you wherever you are he's your king as well when we talk about the end point we know now that it's not just about the termination of something but rather the completion the fulfillment and because we're creatures of time immortality seems many times so far-fetched it sounds like a good superhero movie tell you i believe that that's even what they call superheroes they call them the immortals right supposedly they cannot die and if they happen to die then they somehow raise them up again but when we look at this the very word immortality is the ability to live forever it means eternal life and you cannot begin to even comprehend immortality without first comprehending infinity infinity that's pretty much infinity and immortality go hand in hand jewish commentary says this commentary there would be no manifestation of god's attributes he never would have been a healer no one was ever sick he never would have been a savior if there was no one lost and make them or bring them into immortality and that is what we would call the end yes that's what we are looking at today and that's why the savior el salvador the immortal one immortal so as mortals we see this that we have a few problems mortal people do we have here this morning how many got a few problems and one of the problems that we have is the limitations as mortal people i want to tell you that the moment we open our eyes whether from birth yesterday we wake up every morning our eyes are opened up to a world of limitations yet without limitations there is no limitations are there for us mortals limitations limitations in order to get us to seek something that is greater than those limits because as mortal or finite people mortality eternal something let me see if at one point in your life or another you've ever said that made that statement [Music] if i only had a better job or a nicer house since we don't win and play una casa bonito by only and what is it nothing but limitations why is it that most everything that us human beings think about this that we need necessity mostly materialistic things yes or yes everything is material thing oh lord give me this and lord give me that yet even in those things there are people that find success in those things i was hearing a man by the most you know a man by the name of elon musk you know he's the owner there of tesla and so forth and a few other things they asked him with all his ideas and everything that he plans on doing he said where are you getting all the money to do all that basically this is what he said money does not limit me he said well he's the richest man in the world well of course not in other words he did not see limitations or put limitations notice as we as we understand this then that as believers we you would think that because we serve an infinite god we would be able to overcome any limitations right away you know you hear people would say you you would think people would say or talk like this i sure could use more faith backwards because that's not what the scripture teaches us of god and it's righteous and why do i continue having these limitations because your character has not been developed enough power without character is satanic when you come to a place in your life where you are an overcomer what happens oh you begin to come to a place of dominion a place where you can rightfully rule over those things not let them rule over you our founding pastor i've said this many times he would always say this is why i hope that you follow me in this as we as we give this foundation that's why the hardest thing for and that is to get one mortal to believe another we can only as i said believe each other to a certain point we're good at that so from that point on too many mortals have disappointed or maybe the way we see our brother supported by all that we permitted us but i want you to notice what the the concept of infinity to ju or through judaism and please get with that please listen closely in this in judaism [Music] on behind the voice there would be no limitations [Applause] yeah and then you can go off singing and shouting and da da da da da da da do you even do it in a car in your car you go down the road and man you just hear them going to town and man just doing whatever they do there's no limitations to it no i limit you i don't care who's around no listen shut off the limitations and now it's open they're free yes and our eyes deceive us tell me that's not true what happens the moment we see who's around us we see limitations now our hand doesn't go up as high anymore resistance i don't know because of limitations your eyes showed you limitations and therefore we found ourselves lacking doing what we failed to do amen when we when we feel like hallelujah when when those limitations are still in place but when we close our eyes to the limitations then we begin to hear the voice of god and it's not until you hear the voice of god once again infinity war no limitations no i limit first of all you got to close your eyes now let's go to exodus the 20th chapter in the verse 18. i want to drive this home and this is tremendous to me because it makes you it it makes you think outside of the box it makes you realize how many limitations we actually have in our life notice this verse 18 perez mortal man that makes no sense to me how do you see a thunder comes you can see the lightning but to see a thunder perovera did i miss something somewhere read it again and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings but look at things god's provided once again how do you see thunderings i'll let you think about that for a moment a good question because when i see the scriptures i know one thing for sure that thunders and trumpets are always the voice of god yes or yes coc okay and when you close your eyes to any limitations you didn't get it gotta let it come out good now once again when you close your eyes to limitations but [Music] and what is it when you see the thunder quest it tells you why the lightning came did you get that come on now i want you to get the thunder hearing the voice of the thunder you actually see the thunder ah because it's enlightening when you do one telling you listen to the watch it'll make more sense as we go on here it opens your eyes and that's how you can see or understand the thunder yes which in turn reveals the purpose of the lightning they had put limitations this is where we want to get now they had put limitations on believing moses god had used him to take them out of egypt and yet they still doubted moses [Music] why because he was a mortal just like them or mortality but as long as moses had the word to give them he was god that was immortality they murmured against god and against moses but when they saw the thunders out that there was nothing but judgment waiting for them they did not hear the voice of that mortal man you with me yes this is important this is what god is showing them there was judgment coming for not believing the one that he had sent verse now you want to hear the mortal man you speak with us we'll hear it now god speak with us lest we die what happened on the immortal realms were opened and moses said unto the people fear not not the mice for god has come to prove stop disbelieving what i'm telling you remember remember the bible is an eastern book and it's the exact same thing that happened in the book of revelations and i turned to see the voice here we go again i turned but the only way is that for him to he was in the spirit on the lord's day and therefore his eyes were they were shut to limitations listen closely to this i i love his word his eyes if he would not have been in the spirit you know foreign come on church i'm gonna say it again he saw the immortal bride we saw that it was jesus christ in all things he heard the same it was jesus christ through seven church ages [Music] mortality are you getting it church lost you hear the voice first but then when you recognize who the one talking to you is [Music] faith cometh put your hand we are open to the immortal let them put it up there and when he was demanded of the pharisees watch this now here comes the pharisees the religious leaders foreign he was demanded when the kingdom of god should come when is it coming he answered them and said elizabeth god put the word if you have it up there observation i don't know if i gave it to you or not probably not but the word observation means the kingdom of god doesn't come with ocular evidence or perception by the eye or perception why listen closely the kingdom of god doesn't come that way by our human mortal finite eyeballs praise god sorry i'm going to say it again it don't come that way yeah we want to see it that way neither shall they say low here or low there will i grant to sit with me that everything that you and i go through nosotros is not by some coincidence or by some chance nothing you go through is by coincidence yes when you're unconscious of something you're not you're not aware of it why are we unconscious of so many things because we bypassed our theophany then the story would vanish there was no more story but you know everything but the story is because of the overcoming the problems look immortal mortal beings and made them and brought them to immortality took the finite and brought them to infinites or to infinity there you go amen that's what it's all about and this is the end yes [Music] my goodness you're still with me all right let's let's keep keep on going here see where we where else we go to see something we are unconscious of those things that's why god's will and purpose in every one of our lives is a mystery but how does god keep it from unfolding all at once we as human beings we're anxious to be lord show me lord show me lord i want to see what else next what's going to happen i'm infinite i'm not in time time is in me how does visible the storyline has to continue la and you think your life means nothing is how does he get us to look past our limitations by little he asks you questions where were you understand ah lord i've been through so many things such a hardship my trials and my tribulations and problems stop crying where were you on this dude come on now this gospel that we preach is so great this message that has been brought to us by the seventh angel is so powerful established god's not answering asking the question for himself he wants him to see the voice where were you and the morning stars they they all sang together he's wanting job to be to identify himself identification [Applause] when the sons of god shouted for joy there were no limitations there no via limitations so they were identified identification by their worship they were identified by their voice versus that when they shouted for joy i said glory be to the lambs everyone heard them the immortal realm but now he's come down to the mortals there where's the promise of his coming promise you we're not looking just to become real religious not looking for that i want to know where i came forth i want to be conscious of the word of god listen closely church oh my god the only way for that seed to ever grow it must be quickened by the eternal immortal invisible god and how does he do it come on now how does he do it by getting one mortal to believe another mortal man once again to believe that the immortal invisible god is speaking to us in not just any mortal man that have given him preeminence that's how he does it by the preaching hello everybody i ain't going to say what i just thought no way i said by the preaching of the gospel and if the whole world stops preaching we'll continue to preach here did you get me church said we don't need to preach no more yes we do maybe you don't know i do you'll see and man never gave me my calling god gave us our calling which means royal power and then it says in parentheses not to be confused with an actual kingdom no so when the gospel of the kingdom so there is a gospel that has being preached here at the end that gives you the authority to rule over a kingdom this gospel not only gives you power [Music] luke 12 32 real quick lucas those fear not little flock not the mice it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom what kingdom it's within you estadent it's the royal power the dominion mortals have no power or dominion over the kingdom but i think they do have this one the fundamental foundation for faith now god when he made man in the beginning he made him superior to anything on earth he gave him the jurisdiction over everything on earth there's no limitations he controlled the winds he controlled the plant life he controlled everything man was made as a secondary god on earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was adam adam was given these great powers but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he felt he got ahead of god's plan adam could speak to the winds that's what god give him power over is okay everything on earth but now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact now what adam anything is to bring it back to its origin again he was unconscious of that but now let's see how he's going to make you and i consciousness wow do you really really you had to do that but now the same two trees are before every one of you let's see how he's making us conscious of it again timothy 1 9-10 who have saved us and called us with an holy calling amen not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world before by the appearing of our savior jesus christ and has brought life is life visa and immortality immortalization we understand the purpose of the lightning now when we no in here what does it do come on church what does it do it gets us remembering that's all god wants to do with you right now get off on that one because that'll take me a while it gets us remembering finite beans finitos remembering [Music] [Music] [Music] remembering who they are remembering where they came from remembering or knowing where they're going is that's what this gospel the message has done for us message spiritual amnesia spiritual he says we were identified thomas identificados in the immortal realms immortalis with god 10 million years before the world was even formed we were identified in the immortal realms with god don't ever let the enemy tell identified in the immortal realms with god tell your neighbor again neighbor we were identified immortal realms with god in the immortal realm and we question these things you'll never question it again when you start to remember nobody's going to tell you anything different because i was back there with him if i've got eternal life because i was back there with them i was identified in the morning stars they sang together and when the sons of god shouted for joy was identified [Applause] i'm going to say it again i was identified by my shelf that's why when god stands a prophet what does he bring the show it produces a bribe it produces a bride that was there with him he is now becoming this immortal bride to god with an immortal god that's the rapture he says every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth that are in them that was pretty loud in heaven somebody turned and said did you hear that i heard that before the foundation of the world was your place i remember hearing that voice because john juan is your voice is already known when did it become known here when you accepted the lord jesus christ as your personal savior notice this now oh my goodness my time has gone oh come on let me just let me finish a little bit more every creature in the realms of the immortal immortal and in the we were conscious we were unconscious of this but when the gospel of the kingdom came to us enlightened us and something happened brother branham says when you meet god happens immortally i'm going to say the moment that moses met god with that burning becomes your personal savior personal it changes you lo cambia throws your views right straight into calvary and to his word something has happened algo a contest you know you know the story he says can anything good come out nothing anything good come out of come out of nazareth we found the messiah come and see me and your name shall become immortal when you make your decision for jesus christ son of god king of israel israel then when he told the woman at the well about her sins to her for a while and he says go get your husband that was it that i want this to really get get and settle inside of you you have so many limits we have put limits on god in our lives well i can't do this or that because i i've been divorced i haven't been in church very long limits her whole life was limited she had five husbands living with the sixth one but when she saw the voice i'm going to say it again oh the voice of her real husband that's what this was possible that the well became immortal [Applause] that that was one of the most referred to scriptures in the ministry of the seventh angels he used that scripture probably more than any other remember our king is eternal immortal immortal visible omnipotence the beginning from the end about ten minutes can i have like ten minutes what god has had imagined in his mind oh brother you don't know my background brother hermanos he's talking about the disciples they had no background nothing at all he just picked them up as jewels out of the dirt and then he made isaiah 46 9. you say yes coming around this corner it's a big corner but we're coming around now watch what god is telling israel remember what a thing when god tells you remember remember what that was remember the former things of old las cosas for i am god and there is none else i am god there is none like me what is the former things he was telling them to remember who they were in the what are these things of old question it's time out of your mind it's the word that's what it says the hebrew word is it's the time out of your mind everything is what i think and one eye out of your mind and this is what old means eternity of god watch end este was the beginning is the end listen listen to this now as i'm wrapping it up now from the beginning and from ancient times he knows the beginning from the end knew you when you were in thought foreign immortals in the immortal realms with god and immortalis then we have an immortal body waiting tenemos this holy spirit that's in us now este santo castano we'll see to it oh blessed be the name of the lord same holy spirit that's in you will see that the gray hairs will fade away can you imagine the kingdom of god within you but even he's blessed be the name of the lord of your immortal bodies it is the evidence that you have i love the lord so much where we find ourselves [Music] hebrews 11 i'm gonna end here because we have a tremendous message that will come forth this evening it's the faith chapter it is the heroes it's the halls of the immortals they are in the immortal realm right now hallelujah they cannot be made perfect why because it's only until was until this end time adam one day he'll pick up all these atoms and the body will be formed again somebody that says let us pray as we approach the throne this morning god almighty lord i raise my hands with your people lord i pray lord that what has been spoken or that they can hear the voice behind the voice that they can see the voice lord and father as you go around the building at this moment every uplifted handheld holy spirit would go through the crowd if one would receive lord what you have given them and what you have for them as their hearts are opening up who we are in you how we love you lord and all the people of god can sing the lord has done uh see what the lord has done what we waited for [Music] see what the lord has done or what

though i laughed and said my life was fine without you i was covering up the secret tears i cried then one day someone told me of your mercies and the love you showed on a hill called calvary or there you died and you purchased my redemption when you broke sin's power and set my spirit free [Applause] i'm amazed the immortal god with his immortal bride blessed be the name of the lord through your precious [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] us [Music] in moments like this i sing out a song i sing out a love song to jesus in moments like this i lift up my head [Music] to the lord singing love you
