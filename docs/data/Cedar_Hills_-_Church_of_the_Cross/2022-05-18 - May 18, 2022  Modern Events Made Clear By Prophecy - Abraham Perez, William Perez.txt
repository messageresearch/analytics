he says if nobody has tackled it i want you [Music] i always like to help the young ministers and uh we know that god is revealing in the last days so you pray for us that god will keep on revealing so this is going to be a two-part question and the days will be shortened and my friend over here and the work your big cut shows like two things and not to keep you standing spring precious and heavenly father father celestial we're so thankful for this day some of these questions are real hard but the prophet said the prophet the last days they will be revealed and we thank you for it we ask everything in the precious name of the lord jesus christ you may be seated and i leave the place to my sidekick william it certainly is wonderful to be in the house of the lord again just want to tell them [Applause] steven amen i got to spend a little bit of time with him today took him to take him to up to the up to the organs and it's uh i told them it's a special place that's where my father always said that's only this year that's where the angel of the lord like to like to be yes so we have our uh our study this evening and the work shall be cut short amen let's turn into the book of matthew uh we're going to start with the had the hardest time just figuring out where we're where we're going to start and i pray the lord helps us so matthew 24. and um we're going to start with uh start with the with the fourth uh actually the third verse 24 3 2 and it says and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of the coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you responding we're going to jump up to verse 23. then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect verse 25 says behold i have told you before vinta amen may the lord have blessings to the reading of the word as we were uh as we were discussing this uh let me thank my i think brother brother abraham for for the time he's he's he's uh he's spent um we we unders we understand as we have listened to to these uh panels the last couple of weeks there's so much as you have seen in in the scriptures there is so much deception out there we all understand that correct society and we we uh we sometimes think that wow that that sounds that sounds pretty good we might we might listen to a song and the song might have a great rhythm the song might might have nice words but look at the deception even in what we call christian music christiana and it could be we could be uh we could be uh singing a song there's a there's a song that says holy holy question lord god almighty beautiful song then at the end of it we sing god and we don't realize the deception even in songs so the book of i i was uh the lord led me to this scripture in the book of habakkuk and i had really never studied or read much about habakkuk but have a cook in this in this book he is he is he is speaking about what feels like right now and it starts out in habakkuk 1-1 it says the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see oh lord how long shall i cry and thou will not hear even cry out unto thee of violence violence how many have have have been in that situation or oh lord how long shall i cry verse 3 why does thou show me iniquity and cause me to behold grievance for spoiling and violence are before me and there are that raise up strife and contention and here's and here is a point that we get to sometimes so many times when we're looking for for judgment for other people like wow lord why why are you showing them mercy why are you giving them mercy shouldn't your shouldn't your judgment be upon them therefore the law is slacked and judgment doth never go forth for the wicked doth compass about the righteous therefore wrong judgment proceedeth verse 5 says behold ye among the heathen and regard and wonder marvelously for i will work a work in your days which ye will not be which you will not believe though it be told you yes that he will work in our day let's go to chapter two and here is here is habakkuk after he's after he's after he's saying these things about judgment he understands now now he says i will stand upon my watch set me upon the tower and we'll watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved and the lord said excuse me and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it is for the vision is yet for an appointed time do you understand what what the appointed time means it's an appointed time it's a specific time but here here's here's the thing that we that we as humans we i was asking my uncle yesterday i said i've been i've been hearing about the coming of the lord for 41 years that the lord is coming i've heard that my entire life and i asked him when did you start hearing that well he said i learned that from my father i said wow so so so so how old are you again theo i don't want to say your age but you're you're you're 83 right i'm uh almost 25 3 [Laughter] so so i asked him okay so for over 80 years master center anos you've been hearing the same thing that i've been hearing that christ is coming christopher and yet it hasn't happened so what happens if something algo doesn't come get no vienna and the time that we think it's going to come in tempo what do we end up doing we end up getting lazy we end up getting relaxed you understand we i hear the story of my uncle telling my dad it was 1976. they were out on a deer hunt this is going to be the last hunt we'll ever have does it seem like time is just flying by you know it's just fast it's just so quick i remember when my wife and i got engaged [Music] it was the the it was in november of 1999 in november of 1999 in november best buy was selling a y2k compatible vcr uh best buy stock a lot of kids like what they what's a vcr muchos what's y2k yes y2k so so at that time we're thinking oh my goodness the event of the year 2000 the event oh my gosh oh my computer is going to stop working i got to buy a new computer vcr buy all these new things something is going to happen in the year 2000. 2 000 comes along i get married in the year 2000. nothing happened a year later i had i had noah we had noah and 21 years later we're still here and it seems like that it has happened we ask ourselves as we get a little bit older and there has to come an end to the work brother branham says and this is the reason why this work must be cut short yes it says and jesus spoke of this jesus not as communism but in matthew the 24th chapter the 21st to the 26th verse he predicted that the spirit in this system and this is why the work has to be cut short at this time is that the spirit in this system el espiritu would be so much like the real thing till it would deceive the very elected it was possible whose names are put on the land's book of life until he said if he didn't cut the work short you know of course for their sake for beneficial today there would be no flesh saved upon the earth you know i was talking to brother stephen today around the corner steven and we were discussing the great work established that has into gulu and gulu in in the in the year of 2017. there was no message books and today there's over 15 message books five years later how has that happened fast god has moved in our day is doing a quick work if it keeps going on continuously the doctrines we don't even realize not really we're not even talking about uh the the uh the the denominational doctrines have if it goes on how much deception there would be deception the book of habakkuk again i want you to notice something here uh three one and two a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon us until oh lord i have heard thy speech and was afraid oh lord revive thy works and i want you to notice these uh this this phrase here in the midst of the years when we talk and we see in the midst of the years sometimes we think well it's the middle of the middle of the year june july it's actually a a hebrew a saying revive thy works between now and the end okay and and in wrath remember mercy so when you see between now and then it is a plea of habakkuk he is seeing all these things transpire he's seen but now you are revealing to me such terrible times lord there is no way we can go through this it is a plea of mercy and salvation salvation to cut your work short paracord hebrews 4 1 and squattrona and we'll go with verse verse 12. i was i was going to read a little bit more but we'll we'll we'll we'll just we'll just start with verse 12. and i want us and i want you to know why this word is so powerful for the word of god it says for the word of god many times when we look at cut shorts our our our mentality will think of maybe you were on vacation one time it was well that's not what it means yes or no let's look at significant so the so so the cardinal mind is saying and it means that he's not going to finish anything significant he's not going to he's not going to he's not going to finish what he started completely but what the bible says for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper you must oh piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart for the word is quick and it it's cutting us at this moment so the lord says in closing here in revelations apocalypse actually let's go to before we do that we want to go to romans 9 28. yes and it says for he will finish the work and cut it short will the lord make upon the earth revelations 22 apocalypse and before we read 22 i i just want to read just one last quote here is how close are we brother branham says maybe later than we think he says see at any time maybe it's already happened oh my goodness all right for all we know i spoke the last sunday being here the last name might have been on that book when it is there is no more coming in the world will move on just as it was the world moves on el mundo it just keeps on going and going see you see but the church i want you to look at your neighbor and tell them can you give one to the lord for that and notice as we go on here their names now he will not deceive those whose names are written on what is it yes it's got to be a system and just think you know to belong to that denomination in that system where have you done yeah you're sealed away thereof it is the mark of the beast he says take some of these old movie actors they get up here and marry four or five times living with three or four different husbands at the same time some of these magazines exposing and telling them taking their pictures naked out here and you little girls set that as your example because your mommy before you perhaps your grandma may be before you say you see where that seat of the serpent works in certainly it is what and what's it done if iniquity is to visit to when the seed of the righteous is about worked out and god said there would come a time if he didn't cut the work short i want you to notice something he says this three times in the last in the last book and the last chapter of the bible behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be verse 20 that's what habakkuk would was saying right surely come quickly and why okay because if he doesn't do it quickly there's no seed shall be saved and that's why the work has to be done [Music] and thank you william william the word cut short goes with what we're gonna speak now uh [Music] foreign well i guess i'm over 25. [Music] don't let one of these days you'll be uh yeah you know what you're gonna be my reader i'll give you the scriptures and you read them okay in english say in matthew 24 verses 21 and 22 go ahead for then shall be great tribulation such as what as was not since the beginning of the world to this time and except those days should be shortened there there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened ah they will be shortened but i'm going to hit first the scientific way then the scriptural way is the earthquake in chile may have shortened the it was the seventh strongest quake ever recorded in history it may have shifted the earth axis the massive can you imagine 8.8 in the similar magnitude the earthquake that stuck struck chile may have changed the entire rotation of the earth and shorten the length of days on our planet [Music] the seven strongest in recorded history el ceptimo gravado mas fuerte in historia and should have shortened the length of an earth day elaboration perhaps more impressive is how much the quake shifted the excess of the earth they have that it should have moved earth figure excess by about three inches the earth figure excess which spins around once every day at a speed of a thousand miles per hour much more i could say mucho mas pouriales but i want you to learn the spiritual way pero quiero que even for our father abraham mr father abraham he waited 25 years for so i could answer this question to you people respond to this like i told caleb we don't know the answer he said you they call we have probed and presumed so much on this question but let us go a little further it's talking about the it says on the on those days the great tribulation and i can use diaz now in that time when he was speaking there on matthew 24. read saint matthew 24 16 then let them which be in judea flee into the mountains why do they want to flee to the mountains let's go a little further tomorrow and woe unto them that are with child and welcome and to them that give suck in those days why okay there was a tribulation but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath the prophet had already prophesied you i do studies fine because they especially they had to run in the wintertime well brother run says in judea sometimes he gets five feet deep in snow this on the sabbath in jerusalem they would close the doors nobody could go in and out was a tribulation when general titus came and put us offense of soldiers around jerusalem so it it says and the scripture that we read that the days had to be shown on account of the elect these people that were caught inside were not the elections and their days were not shortened they stayed there until they ran out of food brother venom said he said mother branham god will not reveal until he sees fear that you need it in its season in 1962 five planets aligned themselves and brother brethren says this is i predict this has a spiritual application application spiritual i believe there is the coming of the issue of god the great revelations of the world will be opened during this time and that's what you're hearing on sunday morning and on the penalties the rev those deep revelations oh that word is so rich right heidi you're rich you like that don't you director i'm glad they will be open during this time i slaughter ruthie over when i get the revelation of this rich word we have to put up around me um yeah not this no your spiritual strength spiritual no except those days they would not be shortened one and two apocalypse and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of god and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass can you see the wrath of god what is the wrath of god it is the great tribulation when john saw this sea of glass when the juan vio este marde crystal it was clear as crystal oh you know why because we weren't there anymore we had raptured the church age was over termina but we see here in chapter 15. standing in the sea of glass or the sea of breaths which means judgment significa that was filled with fire and blood establish the fire of god but now they have gone the victory over the beast victorious his name the image which is the confederation of churches watch that time here vigil we see jacob he had to pass through our tribulation [Music] he left the family and everything on this side of the river familiar because he was afraid of his brother that was coming after him and that night he wrestled with an angel he struggled with him until the breaking of days and because of the victory his name was changed from jacob to illinois and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble the time of travel is called jacob's problem such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book yeah michael was standing for the 144 thousands they see the genuine thing there stands moses and elijah paramount then they will wrestle with god until a hundred and forty four thousand are called isaiah sixty six seven two nineteen before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a manchild who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth at once excuse me shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children there has to be a reason why those 144 000 had to be chosen right away i [Applause] was the first writer the white horse rider el genete del caballo blanco and notice that the first when this revelation six one and two apocalypses says unidos and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer him notice two things psa in those matthew 24 23 and 24. mateo antiquatron then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect the indebted white horse rider deceived many because he was riding a white horse because we all thought even brother brandon thought that that was christ he was deceiving the people established how does he deceive come in verse 27 for as a lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even into the west so shall also the coming of the son of man becomes yes and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven i'd like to give you scriptures so that you can study at home second corinthians 11 14. and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light there he is an angel of light well carlos was in that his name lucifer lucifer significa that he carried the line he therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time and the days were shortened with great breath because he's got such a short period so when he fell like lightning he made his headquarters in the bottomless pit full of locusts and scorpions what's here jerry they have er a king over them exactly what the white house writer came from except and they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon [Applause] the first world war [Applause] it was on the 11th 11 minutes to 11 o'clock on the 11th month on the 11th day in el dia in el misonse november the 11th and 11th month that's why they were the 11th hour workers stop the wins foreign something had to happen because they were scattered in china in

same baptism of the holy ghost the spirit the second war was passed and behold the third woe cometh quickly the second was the second world war but the last one is coming quickly so the days have to be short it's coming quickly last and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men who are these four angels we see the six angels again revelation 16 12 in apocalypse yes and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared in sixth one preparatory i'll tell you who they were one of them was hitler hitler other one was stalin stanley the other one was mussolini mussolini and the fourth one was hirohito from japan that they almost killed all the jews and now you guys can sit down i'm going to stand for a minute because i'm gonna finish with this and it is so tremendous uh ben and brother jerry were in my office and then they they left and i was by myself in the office i was soloing officina and i wasn't even praying to god to give me the answer because caleb has not talked to me about this i was engulfed in this spirit completely the revelation of this question just started to come up i wanted to run in the office my brother that's a creation of god so he ran around the trees and then he heard the bugle of an elk he said oh then he started running around the trees is this tribulation is the tribulation is it the same tribulation read 24-29 islamism immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory allah and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one if the days were not joined so these angels went to get the elect so we read in verse 21 because of the elect that days will be i want to tell you that you have nothing to do with this talking is not you or me and we always say that well i'm one of the let me break it down so you
