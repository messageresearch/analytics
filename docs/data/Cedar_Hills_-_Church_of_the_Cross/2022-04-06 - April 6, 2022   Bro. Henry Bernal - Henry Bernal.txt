[Music] [Music] me [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] every one of you this this evening that let's start with that it's simple a simple thing but uh means a lot no i don't believe that coming to church is not coming to church is going to save you or not but if you have a place to congregate yes join it you go [Music] it's uh you you we get strength we get food and uh it's is a good thing and we need it more now than ever before the day will come that we cannot congregate and uh it's getting like that very very fast uh i really don't know where i'm gonna start here no no uh and if you knew [Music] is [Music] maybe for many of you you see oh more colombians are they're coming it's more than that it's not because those are the consequences of his work and his friendship with brother fabian and that is that says a lot uh for the brothers that have come it's a blessing colombia the brothers that have come from colombia not just today's past sisters and i think the benefits of that event it blesses me so one day you can hear the testimony of these tremendous families just as many of you love sister what we see simply magnifies the lord yes in testimonial and it's a testimony of the faith that we believe is [Applause] but he was going to give us a lot more time when he got here in general each one of us has a story and we have a journey we all have a testimony also another gentleman that we a gentleman we've known for some time now um welcome back i'm gonna switch to english the reason why i am spanish-speaking person but i preach in english because i learned to study the message and the bible in english i don't like the middle man when i cannot access brother brandon myself so that's why i had effort and i had learned obedience brother tommy always said just study and learn it in english so i thank god for him uh i don't want to keep you standing so long forgive me i just want to take a scripture from brotherland domingo you're so kind and turn to the book of hebrews chapter 12 you simply reach like this we're for seeing we also are compatible with so great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us [Music] this to the reading of his word you may be seated [Music] we read the letters lay aside every week of it as far as you can throw it and as soon as you can do it yeah it's uh it's uh it's like if you've got a spider on you you don't like spiders the message is that we have to go back and listen and just really get every detail capture my attention because it says let aside every weight [Music] that's not the way we're talking about it because i've said it before and i i used to say like a joke but it started to be kind of reality i used to say that to lose weight or yeah to lose weight it was it was like uh when someone gets free from demons [Music] special it's uh it's such a serious word because uh how we deal with it which is very lightly yes and it's what would that mean yes significant most people say william branham uh within branham but no it simply means weight and balance significa it's a it's a very simple thing that kills a lot of people in a very simple way i want to to maybe approach this approximately i had i was able to visit with brother caleb just for a little bit before he left and somebody somewhat we got in this subject for about five minutes but the scripture says let us lay aside or get rid of the weight it actually says that so easily so are we as strong as we claim to be or is this weight really stronger than than we are or is the peso nosotros well let's see with the help of the lord he'll he'll we can get through it uh maybe it'll help someone here but this weight rest what we need to get rid of the bible gives us gives us uh clues or what to do or says we're for laying aside and as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby is so we have tasted that the lord is gracious i understand it in a simple way that to get rid of this maybe some of you that are already in a condition that are waiting for the rest of us you don't have no malice or hypocrisy or envies or evil speaking maybe this is not for you so as we go in the scriptures in the says that proverbs 16 11 proverbial onsen says that a just weight and balance are the lords it is the book of proverbs 20 23 proverbial 23s says diver's weights are obama an abomination unto the lord and a false balance is not good as a carrying all this weight it's it's very hard as much as we try you hear people say oh i've been in this message for 40 years and then you meet people that grew up with them and they said oh he's been like that all his life she's is she's done that all since i've known her so so young people openness don't ever let anybody here and i try to pull seniority on you because because they've been in the message longer than you said it doesn't work like that society names families time in the message that that means absolutely nothing it can actually mislead people but christ dealing through people [Music] he's got families he's got men he's got sisters to bring forth what he promised the same yesterday today and forever if that was the case the 11 hours worker that scripture would have to get rid of but i don't mean uh in a way to be misunderstood no no no because i'm a man the problem is that we like to hide behind things and when things don't go as we planned it then we also said where brother lance said and there were some years ago that uh brother branham gave some measurements for certain um crack in the ocean they said the san andreas fault is going to go this way it's going to go down under the the fault why is i mean that goes thousands of miles longer than that yeah so while a meal the meal is the uh the mia is muscular and he doesn't cut what he said he cuts that's the san francisco san francisco the false prophet good man but the false prophet about seven years ago and it was in a very strong earthquake but it was strong enough to wake up science because through the years they said these two faults have nothing to do with each other no function um this fault actually is a continuation of the san andreas fault and if this was to break through here it's gonna make a crack of this measurement then we need to be more cautious how we say that because it is it's not fair to put in men that have such gifts and such ministries ministerial so all these things really bring weight on us let's let's go through the meaning of weight more significantly the peso weight vessel they say that is the amount that things weigh yes it's uh it's uh how they classify contestants in a sport like boxing it is the pondage required to is also is usually specified a certain amount specifically it's a heavy object it's a unit of weight or mass it's a piece of material material that is used to balance things it's uh something heavy weight is also a burden or a pressure you know how it is you see somebody weighs 400 pounds just totally no shape whatsoever but because he weighs 400 pounds [Music] there's a lot of this is the this is the definitions of the dictionary uh something oppressed a burden the increase of heaviness balance balance is known as physical equilibrium this is we say the right balance on a diet and exercise in accounting is is to be equal in the totals in numbers [Music] to equalize [Music] uh to have a balance between good times and bad times and if you go to the dictionary there is 100 definitions of weight and balance definition the meaning of weight and balance the significance of the peso on solid ground in in solidarity while you're on the ground now an airplane a bird flies it has weight in a peso but the meaning of weight on the ground is significant of the peso el piso it's one thing that's when you're flying yes all these meanings those [Music] is simplest by intellect the intel uh intelligencia uh in helping somebody understand the meaning of significant when you take weight and balance or we stand around well the line was preaching when we go on the trip we just load as much as we can and baskets and cylinders and anything that could be defined as a container [Music] and we still whenever we get to where we go on the vamos we still go to the store and gotta get more [Music] three days that's how we travel yes and if we go for longer than that yeah see but the scripture said to get rid of stuff it actually unloads to take flight and has prey and he's taking it to the nest or drag it out where he can eat it but when he's when he's going to take the height he's going to fly high but it requires as little weight as possible an eagle or birds in general they even pluck some of the feathers if they become an obstacle our i don't know if you've been at the airport when customers are fighting with the airlines [Music] because of the weight because of the bag because they thing is a f-350 with a trailer it's very it's a limited thing if an airplane has too much cargo too much too much people and too many bags he has to get rid of a lot of fuel yeah he can bring a lot of fuel if he has a lot of bags so what i want to where i want to get to this i really want to really get to one point and all this that i'm saying is for a reason and i'll say it at the end it's it's it's that this weight is the peso what we deal with uh we say well we're humans we've got to deal with the things of a human and we take that as a priority and but we still talk about things like we know it you know and and but then we live our lives and he says let's compare something it is in the god in the message is your life worthy of the gospel he said let's compare something said one time let's compare the life of saint paul and the rich young rulers the same light stroke struck both men both had the same invitation from jesus christ is that right they both was well trained in the scriptures established remember jesus told the rich young ruler keep my commandments he said i've done this for my youth there's a coven he was a trained man so was saint paul both well trained in the scriptures but both of them had the words when had it from knowledge the other one had it had the germ alive in it and when the light flashed across in front of paul when this is where i want you to keep this in mind or or just take this for yourself church spiritual spiritual church natural iglesias the rich man rico had his excuse he couldn't do it going to jump to paul now he says but paul pablo when the light struck him let's compare his life and see whether he's worthy what happened when paul when the pablo when light strokes struck him he walked in the spirit of jesus christ and the spirit glory to god and that is something that as simple as it is we need to bring it to our day we're not living in times no of things to come all the things that were to come are here am i they're already here because the protection that we have the protection we don't see what other people is having to face and this scripture of lay aside all this weight is so important because we talked about going away [Music] he's already whoa [Music] these are some big chicken wings and she used them and and all of a sudden she's up in the air and then the nature took over [Music] that's not what i'm comes you know those wings and salas are just as good as the buffalo sauce and the ranch dressing because they cannot help the chicken take flight it doesn't matter how much a chicken can talk there is a difference and [Music] [Music] just throw them up in the air as high as we could and then we were trying to catch him i don't think we lost one but we learned that chickens don't fly demons is not to go up into higher air all this is that i'm saying [Music] it's because the seriousness of the time that we live in like the events that we anticipate are serious all this already taking place and we know that the ending of the gentiles is coming to an end [Music] and we are aware of the events that already started to take place but we are closing that well we know that when the door closes to the gentiles we are very familiar with these terms as well as resurrection and rapture and we hear these words and we know what they refer to look as significant but through the years especially through these last couple of years and in some of these recent conversations with different brothers and sisters sentiment i find that people especially christians especially are more prepared for judgment and tribulation because it's easy to understand if you are a person that lives already at higher levels [Music] [Music] so we identify with those natural events so a lot of people as you hear them scucha their conversation is like yeah we're going to rapture but just in case it's a conversation i'm buying some extra food and then and then and then you know you never know it gets bad i mean i as much bullets as i can buy i'm i'm i'm collecting them [Music] and and if i make enough money i'm gonna i'm gonna turn my truck into one of those apocalypse trucks [Music] for the apocalypse and always there's this plan b in the back of the head or in the front of the head because a lot of times he's just wide open oh praise the lord resurrection and the rapture is coming but let's keep this just in case we're not bribed and really do we have those questions in our mind but if i ask who's bride the whole congregation is going to raise both hands we're going to just scream as loud as we can this gives us a little more extra attitude because we think that we're more than others we judge i heard this from brother branham branham the pastor told me all these things they're fine as long as your feet are on the ground i'll tell you that's why the sheep why don't you take weight and balance to the air there's no room for mistake no i can't err most people die getting off the ground much agent [Music] is what they tell gravity that's what science calls gravity which is the way that will hold you to the earth that's all there is all these because is nothing but a condition is a condition that can keep you centered in the center and in this condition condition you can't lean too much to the right too [Music] do not count when your feet lift the ground you know you only need to be about 10 feet off the ground to die then weight means something else here on earth your feet yes or if you sit down if you lay down or if you do a handstand [Music] it out you know that way you don't push through through the earth that's that's what keeps it the floor is the floor is what's keeping you from sinking so yeah so we're pretty brave but when that floor comes from under you [Music] and you don't want to fall you know what do you do yes the same thing the eagle did he know it wasn't a chicken your wings something else need to develop something else all the new testament testament the bible told us it was going to give us wings the events that we are facing and the reason why i said all this is just simply to make this statement implemented most christians christians are more realistically preparing for judgment and tribulation then for resurrection and rapture because those events judgment and tribulation are natural to have visions to have dreams to have all these things is true they're there for a good purpose [Music] is your body ready to see with your eyes someone how much more the transformation all this is going to take place on this body until this body cannot tolerate it anymore brandon says it's going to be an excruciating fast how is your body going to handle come on all this all these pressure of events are coming on the squeeze not only the physical but the spiritual no no no we're talking about that that we cannot play with things like this and i think it behooves us [Music] are you ready don't talk to me with your feet on the ground let's take this conversation at 18 000 feet where the density of the air is so difficult that you can just flip upside down and fall when we say that momentum where the temperature where the where the pressure of the atmosphere is not like the pressures of the earth the pressure of an ego it's not like oh my gosh how am i going to pay that bill i need to get another job we all got one foot in the world and one in church because comes monday morning after prayer you gotta go put your foot on the on on the grind i don't find anywhere in the scripture where unless you get to a total consecration and total surrender to the lord that's what i would like to hear for you to hear the testimony of the brothers that came bro and it will be good for you to listen to each other's testimonies [Music] we or looking for prey at 10 000 feet uh you stand on your feet i believe it's a serious thing that we check ourselves no i don't need to check brother jerry let's see what you do then the most sufficient person that is totally unnecessary yes necessarily so the scriptures that we read so they applied to us that they bring to us i pray that this this this that you take it the best way possible is i'm not saying that i am better than somebody neither i'm saying that there's somebody else better than me we all have a journey some of these journeys are have a lot of grief in it and and and sadness and and in this journey there are brothers that have gotten tired of her what do we do we talk about them like that's going to solve the problem we as ministers make so many mistakes [Music] the thing because we let our frustrations out in the pulpit [Music] in our opinions that that is somewhat uh the anointing [Music] he grieves the holy holy spirit [Music] [Music] we have a resurrection and a rapture that is not promised to no one else but to us those that will believe the word those that will take the message [Music] [Music] out of it except amenos you can lay aside where the heart was all the way all of it although that's so easily be sensitive because weight means something and he keeps [Music] let's get used to not having the ground under your feet [Music] uh somebody have to call it through free fall and and and and it's something something that you experience when when there is nothing to support you under your feet and you have no wings you want to go up yes [Music] well as we get used to it not to be so earthbound then you start you're going to notice that you do have wings and and you let them let them extend them out [Music] those wings make you do things that you're not used to those those wings takes you places that you haven't been to la salazar that the rapture it's for a bunch of inexperienced people yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but if you were to just let off up in the air but i'll see you soon and sort of like in the light you have what it takes to prove that you're not a [Music] god has given us the supernatural he's all around us all the time [Music] and it's always [Music] if [Music] would you raise your hand would you raise your heart would you pray right there with your eyes on the understand if you need help if you need to come to the front the front is always open is [Music] there is now a person here that is an exception because in this journey that we have we all have things to deal with but while he's still in the throne [Music] don't spend it search it within your heart [Music] make sure you have what you think you have yes make sure that that your heart can match what your mouth expresses [Music] remember that the meeting with the lord [Music] person that's what the weight needs to get rid of [Music] perfect balance by the word perfect what brings us that it [Music] [Music] but we have to exercise [Music] live the natural things aside they take care of them while we're on this earth those things will deal with themselves we don't bring none of that [Music] [Music] along with the character that we have developed here in these victories victorious oh if you believe so the lord can give you anything you want to look i'm your fault so look i don't look at your weaknesses but search deep and look at your nature and if it's super easy it comes from god and there is nothing that that that can stop [Music] maybe not placed correctly father but you see the hearts of your children i pray lord that you look at the sincerity in their hearts [Music] [Music] the creams and even at times when we feel we can't go no more something within us will bring us forth [Music] it's that portion of your nature [Music] [Music] but we just surrender ourselves to you completely indeed until we are totally [Music] we completely emerge in that presence [Music] let us take your father as serious as he wants us to take you yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i pray lord that you answer everyone in their prayer lord go to each and every one of them jesus christ's name amen amen [Applause] in that song jesus something about that name solitude and reverence as the holy spirit continues to move in the hearts of the
