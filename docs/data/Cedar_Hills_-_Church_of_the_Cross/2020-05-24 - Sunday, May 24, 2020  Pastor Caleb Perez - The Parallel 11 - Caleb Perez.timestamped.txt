[11:23] word is the father the word is golf and
[11:27] the word made manifest is God himself
[11:30] taking his own work and manifesting
[11:32] among believers nothing can make it live
[11:35] but believers just believers it's not
[11:38] everyone you can take wheat and plant it
[11:40] in a different kind of a soil in liver
[11:44] drill but what it's got to have certain
[11:46] fertilize in the ground to raise wheat
[11:48] and if there is no if there is if the
[11:51] fertilize in the ground isn't isn't a
[11:54] wheat isn't Germa ties to that
[11:55] fertilized it'll never grow so no matter
[11:58] where the word falls if it doesn't fall
[12:00] in the right kind of a heart jesus said
[12:02] so son fell by the wayside on stony
[12:05] grounds and the fowls of the air come
[12:07] and fed on it and then you said son fell
[12:10] into thorns and thistles which raised up
[12:12] and choked out right away
[12:13] traditions denomination scares the world
[12:17] children but said some went over into
[12:19] good ground and brought forth a
[12:20] hundredfold so that's the kingdom of God
[12:22] it's the same thing some will not
[12:26] believe it all some will bleed for a
[12:27] little while like the disciples they
[12:29] followed him many of them the seventy
[12:32] followed him for years to find out about
[12:34] a year and a half or two years just to
[12:36] find out that they could find something
[12:37] any some like somebody had some power to
[12:41] do these things I like a rabbit foot a
[12:44] magician of some sort what he could do
[12:46] to produce these things I could know
[12:48] what was in the people's heart and what
[12:49] they were thinking and they finally
[12:51] found out that he said that he come down
[12:53] from heaven he was the word himself and
[12:56] when they did that that was too much
[12:58] farther than they said no man can
[12:59] understand this and they walked away
[13:01] from him that's those who fell among
[13:03] thorns it brings back to the same thing
[13:05] in every congregation you have make
[13:07] believers unbelievers and believers it's
[13:10] been in every congregation you find them
[13:12] all the time some of them make out like
[13:14] they're believers that's the worst of
[13:16] time and then they have those who are
[13:18] actually unbelievers he won't bother you
[13:21] just walk away and shake his head but
[13:23] those who make believe say they're
[13:24] believers that's the time that's the
[13:26] kind yet to watch as always make
[13:28] believers and then there's some genuine
[13:29] believers see them three there there was
[13:32] the unbelievers as soon as he said
[13:33] eat the flesh the son of man cold man
[13:35] that was it the others was make
[13:37] believers they stayed told it's like
[13:39] Judas did right up to the end but then
[13:41] the real believers they couldn't explain
[13:43] it
[13:43] but they believed it anything the veil
[13:47] tradition of unbelievers taken away you
[13:50] see God when the veil of traditions has
[13:54] been removed you can see that God is
[13:56] still God of his work he still keeps his
[13:59] word
[14:00] he's the is the God author of his word
[14:04] that is hid behind skin veils to others
[14:08] yes that's right to those who cannot go
[14:10] behind the veil he's still behind skin
[14:13] veils notice then we then we become part
[14:20] of him as you are the fail that fails
[14:24] him you are part of him as long as
[14:29] Christ is in you as Christ was of God
[14:32] because God was in him made him God and
[14:35] His Christ is in you the hope of glory
[14:38] you become part of Christ he that
[14:41] believeth on me the works that I do
[14:42] shall he also you become part of Christ
[14:45] as long as Christ is hidden you that is
[14:48] fatal to the unbeliever but you know he
[14:51] is in you your Templin Christ that's
[14:54] behind the veil of skin then we become
[14:57] the hot because of this Veil the veil
[14:59] again in human flesh hides God the word
[15:04] from the unbeliever as it is written see
[15:08] written you are written epistles of ival
[15:11] said and what is epistle is a written
[15:14] word and you are the written other words
[15:18] you read like this you say you are
[15:19] written epistles are you are the word
[15:22] that has been written made manifest
[15:25] nothing can be added to it you can't say
[15:27] I'm a written epistle and I'll leave you
[15:29] some other kind of something what this
[15:30] is already robocalls nothing to be added
[15:32] or taken away
[15:34] if dr. Raphael was right this famous
[15:36] book I want you to see it after while
[15:37] brother Bao's here selling the ground
[15:38] somewhere I see him outside I don't
[15:40] think you can get in but he's writing a
[15:41] book there it's very astounding of the
[15:43] Lady of seeing age now I want you to be
[15:45] off oppresses pretty soon so we're
[15:47] taking a last reading of it now and was
[15:49] writing who is discussing it in there
[15:51] see about everyone has always come to
[15:53] you said brother Ram them seven thunders
[15:56] that the voice stutter is he said write
[15:59] it not see but close it up said that'll
[16:02] be seven thunders that will be revealed
[16:05] in the last days seen seven thunders
[16:07] that'll tell us a tone that sounds real
[16:09] good
[16:09] see but watch what you're talking about
[16:11] what do you say that he said see that
[16:13] you're I did not see these seven
[16:16] thunders uttered their voices see and he
[16:18] said don't write that see but it's be
[16:21] sealed up in the book until the last
[16:24] days now someone has been he's been
[16:27] Semyon theologian said brother bear if
[16:29] the Lord God said if with your
[16:32] experience that the Lord has given you
[16:34] for his people humbly seeing this said
[16:36] you'd be eligible to write up a Bible
[16:39] yourself your word if God is manifested
[16:41] I said that might be true see he's
[16:43] trying to catch me hey I said but you
[16:46] see I couldn't do that he said why
[16:47] couldn't you have all the qualifications
[16:48] I said but you look one word cannot be
[16:52] added or taken away any said well then
[16:54] then seven thunders you see said what
[16:56] them seven thunders blasting out will
[16:58] there be a revelation be given to
[16:59] something I said no sir it would be
[17:00] adding something to it or taking some
[17:02] from it's all revealed in there and the
[17:03] seven seals opened up the revelation
[17:05] what that one there's still word you see
[17:09] you can't get out of that word it won't
[17:11] leave the word and God's Spirit ever
[17:13] leave that word it'll stay right with
[17:15] the word blinding some and open the eyes
[17:17] of others it'll always do that you are
[17:20] ripping epistles
[17:22] random old man or you are I translate
[17:26] that turn around this way see just turn
[17:28] it around
[17:28] you are a Pistols that has been written
[17:30] course you can't add nothing to it
[17:32] that's rid of all men manifested Word of
[17:35] God in other words that Peter John does
[17:38] short when they went up there they
[17:39] proceeded they were ignorant and I
[17:40] learned
[17:40] they had no education but they take a
[17:42] notice had been with Jesus see they were
[17:45] ignorant and unlearned but they were
[17:47] written epistles read that they had been
[17:50] with Jesus course Jesus was manifesting
[17:52] himself through them Christ
[17:54] veiled in their flesh manifested made
[17:57] alive like he was in Moses when the word
[18:00] was in Moses he was God in flesh when it
[18:05] was in Jesus it was God in flesh the
[18:08] only thing he done was changed his mess
[18:11] not his word not his nature he's the
[18:14] same yesterday today and forever he only
[18:16] changed his farm he changed from Noah to
[18:19] Moses he changed from Moses to David and
[18:22] David Joseph hold-downs they come into
[18:24] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[18:26] he is still the same god I hope that
[18:32] gets through see it is the same God but
[18:36] he has takes on another veil see he puts
[18:39] on another veil he did their farmers
[18:41] take it on a veil take it on a bail
[18:43] until finally they come down through the
[18:45] Lutheran Age don't do the other age then
[18:48] finally comes out into the complete just
[18:50] before it comes a prophet arises again
[18:51] but it does it foreshadows the word
[18:53] short back Herod dealing what's been
[18:55] done what's been left off that the
[18:57] church would be without not without
[18:59] understanding then when this fades out
[19:01] man like John said I must decrease he
[19:03] must increase then all in all comes into
[19:06] him he's fully manifested to Luther
[19:09] Wesley and Pentecostal age know him down
[19:11] all that he's fully manifested is he
[19:13] come down just a manifestation God
[19:14] unfolding see non orders Paul foiled in
[19:19] his promises for this day as they had
[19:23] now Moses was the word that day because
[19:26] the word was given to him for that day
[19:29] Moses Joseph was the word in his days
[19:32] poetry in Christ exactly see each one
[19:36] I'm wants to work and what Jesus came he
[19:38] was the word and its fullness because
[19:40] the whole plan of redemption laid in him
[19:43] the whole planetary redemption in layin
[19:45] Moses dead laying Joseph didn't land
[19:47] well I just see they were only part of
[19:50] the work partner to it see I noticed
[19:54] keep your thought here it comes I say
[19:58] the whole plan wasn't in them they were
[20:01] pointing to it
[20:02] therefore after him the fullness we
[20:04] cannot part to something else it ports
[20:06] back to you the word this is a complete
[20:10] revelation nothing can be added or taken
[20:12] away from there's the complete
[20:14] revelation all that a shadow of him to
[20:17] cover when he come he was a perfect
[20:19] Hebrews 1 God in sundry times spoke to
[20:22] the fathers to the prophets God spoke to
[20:24] vales the prophets but in this last days
[20:28] through His Son Jesus Christ
[20:31] there you unveil out their own Calvary
[20:35] is son of God unbale notice made alive
[20:39] and today when the word is manifested in
[20:41] human vessels veils it's absolutely the
[20:45] word fulfilled in that day which comes
[20:47] back to God being baptized into him
[20:50] according to first Corinthians 12 we
[20:52] become identified with him hey I said

[24:07] hey man that's right the word is self
[24:11] reveal reveals herself think the
[24:15] mysteries of God made known to us in
[24:20] this day by the same heavenly messenger
[24:24] that was made known to them in that
[24:26] day's notice the same pillar of fire
[24:30] that sent Moses the same pillar of fire
[24:34] that was on Moses that wrote the Bible
[24:37] the same pillar fire the pole men on his
[24:40] road down to Damascus and Paul wrote the
[24:42] New Testament remember Matthew Mark Luke
[24:45] and John they only wrote what they seen
[24:48] but Paul had there at all and roll what
[24:51] went on everyone wrote back in that day
[24:53] but when Moses came on the scene he had
[24:56] the revelation he met the pillar fire
[24:59] and it was revealed to Moses how Genesis
[25:02] he wrote the first four books of the
[25:03] Bible Moses did that right four he met
[25:08] God in the form of the pillar of fire
[25:10] bailed in the pillar of fire when Paul
[25:13] met him on the road the disciple jestro
[25:15] what they'd seen him do but Moses had
[25:17] the revelation went out in Egypt for
[25:19] three years of studying and seeing that
[25:20] God of the Old Testament for Jesus at
[25:23] the new the revelation I was not
[25:25] disobedient to the heavenly vision
[25:27] that's right right and thank God the
[25:30] same pillar of fire that come upon those
[25:33] man that wrote the Bible is the same
[25:35] pillar of fire here today interpreting
[25:37] the Bible
[25:38] [Applause]
[25:42] he-man how we thanking for that saying
[25:46] what a comfort what identification I'm
[25:49] so glad to be identified in that I don't
[25:51] know what to do I'd rather be identified
[25:54] that and all the Baptist Methodist
[25:55] Presbyterian all identified in that word
[26:01] were that's Shekinah glory in Revelation
[26:03] lays the pillar for appearing visible in
[26:07] among us identifying that the message is
[26:09] right like you did it mount sunny I
[26:11] remember before the true message come
[26:13] for Moses preached and he let him out of
[26:16] Egypt but there before the real
[26:19] commandment says lay down the seals was
[26:21] brought in God come down before the
[26:26] people and prove that Moses was sent
[26:29] from him that right a pillar of fire
[26:34] that Moses said he had seen in the bush
[26:36] and talked to him all in this last days
[26:41] let's see that same pillar of fire right
[26:46] on longer speaking the same word not
[26:49] only that but interpreting if I'm making
[26:51] it manifested proving it it's the truth
[26:55] so the people has not one way to
[26:57] disbelieve let's say just willfully want
[27:01] to and then he does since wilfully after
[27:03] having a knowledge of the truth there
[27:04] remaineth no more sacrifice for see
[27:07] notice saying pillar of fire sent to
[27:10] Moses and to Paul that wrote the Bible
[27:13] now sent to reveal it the grace of God
[27:18] the unchanging God fulfilling the
[27:22] promises of Matthew 28 lo I am with you
[27:27] always
[27:29] thoughtfully st. John 14:12 the work
[27:32] should I do you also hopefully st. Luke

[27:40] man will be reviewing Malachi for behold
[27:44] I send to you Elijah the Prophet that
[27:46] will restore the faith of the people
[27:47] back to their original
[27:49] [Applause]
[27:51] oh he died to reveal himself to us now
[27:56] let us die to self to reveal him to
[27:58] others let us die to their traditions
[28:01] and things too revealing to other die -
[28:03] the denomination's - revealing to others
[28:05] notice the old temple had in it the
[28:09] Shekinah glory and the light of the
[28:11] Shekinah over the word the word is the
[28:15] seed it brought forth the shewbread to
[28:19] believers only the blood also was up on
[28:23] the covenant and the blood is the water
[28:25] the water that life ins the green the
[28:29] wheat the seed which is a word like
[28:32] jesus said as Moses that's up the brass
[28:34] serpent in it again he said God so loved
[28:36] the world he gave His only begotten Son
[28:37] whosoever breeze I should not perish
[28:39] Moses smoked the rock in the wilderness
[28:42] to save a perishing people to bring
[28:44] water God smoked Jesus to bring forth
[28:47] the spirit out of him for a perishing
[28:49] people the blood came from him which is
[28:53] the water of the washing by the word
[28:55] which the water brings life to the seed
[28:57] and it brought forth the Shekinah glory
[28:59] shined up on the word which brought
[29:02] forth the shewbread and the shewbread
[29:06] was just for our chosen people
[29:10] all right now breaking into the veil

[30:18] which believes it hey man what a
[30:23] wonderful hour or living in tea the
[30:27] Shekinah was over the word and under
[30:30] there was the bread and there was the

[31:53] later but she brought forth the pass
[31:57] away but my words shall not pass away
[31:59] and shall come to pass in the last days
[32:03] if God here we are this is the light
[32:07] over the word as the light of the Sun
[32:11] changes the seed from glory to glory
[32:14] we also become more like him as we live
[32:19] in his presence I can't being conformed
[32:23] to his blessed image as we walk with Him
[32:27] watch what the Sun does you plant a seed
[32:29] what happens that seed runs inside the
[32:33] seed is alive the life comes forth the
[32:35] brakes for the stalk now that don't look
[32:37] like the first there's Luther it was a
[32:40] stall
[32:41] alright the stock went on the first
[32:43] thing you know it brought forth the
[32:44] tassel see that was a West End revival
[32:48] but like the other then along come the
[32:51] Pentecostal revival the brought forth
[32:53] the baptism the Holy Ghost
[32:54] alright what happened we get fungus on
[32:57] the ear if it gets to look wrong this
[32:59] thing that thing you don't look like the
[33:01] word is not like the rest of it it's not
[33:03] like the original green money but God is
[33:05] still there to make that's that we're
[33:07] just the same
[33:08] notice what does it do it finally
[33:09] returns back to the original seed again
[33:12] when he come in the form of Martin
[33:14] Luther when he come in the form of John
[33:15] Wesley when he come in the form of the
[33:16] Pentecost so he's supposed to reveal
[33:18] himself again like the same seed one in
[33:20] the Son of Man he revealed his self his
[33:23] son of gods through the stock age and so
[33:25] forth but in this last age he's really
[33:27] selfish son of man again
