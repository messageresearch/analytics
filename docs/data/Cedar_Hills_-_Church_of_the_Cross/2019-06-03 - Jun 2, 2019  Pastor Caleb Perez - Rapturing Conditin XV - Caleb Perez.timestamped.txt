[2:20:09] half a century ago five decades ago or
[2:20:13] as we say 50 years ago God fulfilled a
[2:20:17] plan he thought before the world was
[2:20:19] formed he formed a love he knew would
[2:20:21] stand a bond so sweet yet so strong
[2:20:25] rewarding victorious and this loyal and
[2:20:29] unique all because he couldn't bear the
[2:20:31] thought of having you both apart when
[2:20:34] God had already seen storms of life
[2:20:36] trials struggles coming
[2:20:39] he also seen that your love and faith in
[2:20:42] him and each other never wavered one by
[2:20:46] one each year flew by since the day you

[2:21:02] advice your answer was simply this seek
[2:21:07] the Lord leave it in his hands or pray
[2:21:10] about it to some it may sound short and
[2:21:13] simple but how you both live that
[2:21:15] example every day proves that God dwells
[2:21:17] in this unity with every step
[2:21:21] stepping stone or stumbling block but
[2:21:24] also with God's amazing grace and love
[2:21:26] between you both as we try to put this
[2:21:29] letter or poem in towards such others
