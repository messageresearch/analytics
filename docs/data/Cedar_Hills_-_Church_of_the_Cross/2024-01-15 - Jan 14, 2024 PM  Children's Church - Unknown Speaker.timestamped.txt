[40:09] scriptures go ahead James it to
[40:12] him I was thinking about what you were
[40:15] saying that it's uninspired but so I got
[40:19] Mark 16:18 here and it says uh they
[40:22] shall take serpents and if they drink
[40:24] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[40:27] Hallelujah Glory they shall lay hands on
[40:30] the sick and they shall recover woo
[40:33] that's right tell them another
[40:36] one well you see last time I laid hands
[40:41] on someone they did not
[40:44] recover so it's very foolish son that
[40:48] you say something like that I don't
[40:51] believe it I don't believe you can lay
[40:54] hands and they all of a sudden they're
[40:55] recovering
[40:57] we have Evolution
[40:59] Evolution we have doctors we have
[41:03] science we have
[41:07] monkeys so how can you prove me wrong
[41:09] James tell them James tell them testify
[41:13] to this man all right come on
[41:15] boy well it was actually not too long
[41:18] ago I ended up tearing some tendons in
[41:20] my foot and I thought I broke it and I
[41:22] was pretty worried about it but uh I
[41:25] went to the doctor they said I tore some
[41:27] tendons on my foot couldn't walk on it
[41:29] for a little bit then uh one day I came
[41:33] to church and I got prayed for and the
[41:35] ministry told me he was like everything
[41:37] will be good is new and so I went on
[41:40] went back to the doctor and they did
[41:42] more X-rays and stuff and uh while the
[41:45] doctor said I was very lucky and uh we
[41:47] don't believe in luck but he said
[41:50] everything healed perfectly fine I don't
[41:52] need therapy I don't need a cast or
[41:54] nothing that everything was perfect
[41:56] perfect sit down yes sir what do you
[42:00] have to say about that Professor okay Mr
[42:03] Gramps let's there's this word and it's
[42:06] called
[42:08] coin ah
[42:11] coincidence however you spell
[42:16] that we believe in coincidence when the
[42:19] doctor tells you that you're okay and
[42:22] you happen to be okay that's a
[42:25] coincidence
[42:26] and then the minister prays for you and
[42:29] you're healed it's a
[42:31] coincidence that's not real
[42:34] boy that's where I'm going to have to
[42:36] draw the line there buddy which line
[42:40] boy in the sand
[42:43] buddy you have a seat I
[42:48] guess you
[42:50] see James was just brought up a good
[42:53] point the Bible says they shall lay
[42:55] their hands on the sick
[42:56] and they shall
[42:58] recover now three weeks ago I was laying
[43:02] in my
[43:03] deathbed and I didn't let James know
[43:05] because I didn't want to scare him but I
[43:07] was very sick the doctor says I have two
[43:10] options I can either go home and die or
[43:13] stay there and die and well I said I'm
[43:17] not doing either of them so you know
[43:18] what I did I packed up my bed and I left
[43:23] that hospital against medical advice
[43:26] watch your step now and I began to walk
[43:30] I said you know what can't do me no good
[43:32] laying at home dying might as well get
[43:35] moving so I began to to pray to the Lord
[43:38] and by golly guess what I stumbled
[43:41] upon
[43:44] anybody I stumbled upon an old country
[43:47] church and when I walked by that church
[43:50] I could just hear the singing it was so
[43:53] beautiful and I said Lord Is this where
[43:55] my healings coming from and I walked in
[43:58] that church and they were having a
[44:00] prayer line and I walked up in the
[44:03] prayer line and the minister said what
[44:04] can I do for you I said well the doctor
[44:08] said I'm going to die with
[44:09] pneumonia and he says well I can pray
[44:12] for you so he put his hands upon me and
[44:16] he says do you believe Mark
[44:18] 16 Verse 18 and he says they will lay
[44:22] hands on the sick and they will recover
[44:25] and I said believe it and by golly if I
[44:28] didn't feel better that next day I don't
[44:30] know what else to tell you but
[44:32] scriptures un
[44:35] inspired
[44:37] Hallelujah did you just say what did you
[44:40] say I said the scripture is
[44:43] uninspired one more time make sure I get
[44:47] this right I
[44:48] said the
[44:50] scripture is on inspired glory be to God
[44:54] this crazy old man
[44:57] right if God could heal me with
[44:59] uninspired word what could he do with
[45:02] word that is inspired
[45:05] huh what could God do with word that is
[45:08] inspired so tell me
[45:11] Doc that same God is here
[45:14] today and I know you believe we came
[45:16] from these hairy monkeys but no God is
[45:19] interested in the details he knows you
