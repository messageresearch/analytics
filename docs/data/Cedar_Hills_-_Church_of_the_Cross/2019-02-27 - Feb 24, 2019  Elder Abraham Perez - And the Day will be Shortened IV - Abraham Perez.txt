Caleb to but God is here you know how I know cuz I see it inside of all of you I see your pretty faces and that means that God is still living in your heart amen amen we uh this will be lesson number four and the days will be shortened and uh uh I have a lot of scriptures there's no minister in this church that reads more scriptures than I do it's because I take you into deep territory and I'd like to make certain that it's scriptural because what I think ain't ain't worth five cents but what he says is life eternal amen so be so kind and and open your Bibles Book of Romans r chapter 9 27 Isaiah also crith concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea our Remnant shall be saved for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth St Mark 13 for in those days shall be Affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created un this time neither shall [Music] be and except that the Lord had CH those days no flesh should be saved but for the elect sake whom he ha chosen he has shortened the days amen Penny how do you like my ti you like it you got a good taste thank you CH gave me this for my birthday so I says I better word or else re will get upset thank you oh for you that gave me gifts God bless you and God en reached you brother Bram said I preached once to two 2 or 3:00 in the morning people were walking down the aisle just praising God a dozen or so receive the holy ghost at 3:00 in the morning and brother brandham said God have mercy I wish I could see that again but we can't that day is gone she is far spent the night is here all we used to have all night prayer meetings preaching in the Parks Revival fires so why are the days going to be shorten a man came to my house once and said brother Brenham I want to get rid of my sins and be a Christian so I went to Billy Graham's meeting bil and he said hold up your right hand and accept Christ as your personal savior it didn't do me any good then I went to Oral Roberts meeting Roberts he told me you stay in that inquiry room and stay there until you're so happy you speak with Tong I did but it didn't do me any good then I went to another meeting they told me that I had to get Sanctified get happy and Shout yet enough Joy I prayed and I prayed till I shouted but yet it did not do me any good so I went so then he he went to Brother Brenham brother Brenham said brother all those things are good I believe in those things but yet that is not the thing it is accepting the person of Christ Jesus shouting speaking in tongues running crying what where are those attributes that follow I've seen people cry crocodile tears crocod they're just goats but they CED like a sheep shout Sinners shout speaking in tongues Sinners speak in Tong and the man says then you don't believe in tongues brother brenon he said how can you say that the tongue is part of my body sure I believe in tongues a tree is known by the fruited Bears I'll give you my evidence of what a Christian should be it's true veiling of Soul a person who is always hungering and thirsting for God they got to have something of God inside of them so they can travail all the time The Book of Psalms 126 verse five and six they that sow in tears shall rap in Joy he that goeth forth and whth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing in the Sheep shs with him you hunger for God if you hunger for God that crying the shouting the praising speaking in tongues will take its place if I would tell you people and you don't have to do it if I would tell you people how many of you have the Holy Ghost well the majority of you would raise your hand then if I would read give me Ezekiel 93 and the glory of the of God of Israel was gone up from the Cherub where upon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the riders in Horn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the Abominations that are done in the midst thereof now if I would ask again how many of you have the Holy Ghost after reading that scripture so if the sealing Angel would come to Las crues whom would he seal the doors are closing people do not have that burden anymore that's why the Bible says he that is filthy let him be filthy but he that is righteous let him be righteous and he that is Holy let him be holy that day we know that the door to the Gentiles is closing the day the time the season is just about over you don't find that burden anymore the spirit of God is being withdraw the love of many has wxed cold their worship has become just a form when the music is playing real life many of they're worshiping God but as soon as the Music Stops they stop and brother bam said this I'm not talking to you people I'm not talking to Bram Tabernacle I'm talking to all the churches I've G I'm going through the United States so he's not talking to you people see cuz he went to almost every state amen the burden for for people that are lost the Song of Solomon Chapter 2 I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys in order for you and I to understand this message and be a candidate for the supernatural we must be bold enough to to enter into the holy of holies Hebrews 10 10 19 and 20 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he has consecrated to for us through the veil that is to say his flesh Aaron had to go Beyond the Veil once a year and he had to be Anointed with a rose of shering The Rose had to be crushed to produce of that perfume and at Calvary Jesus was crushed to squeeze the perfume out of him because he was wounded for your transgression we could never approach God why couldn't we approach God because we were all stinky we had bad old ERS we were full of sin and we stunk with the habits of and sins that when we were out in the world so he took your stink took my stink when he became a man to take the stink out of him and that's why he was crushed at calary to give you that perfume of the rose of Cher so you could go into the presence of God Amen there was not the only attribute notice we were Anointed with the rose of Sharon Psalms 133 verse one behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the the head that read down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of His Garment as the Dew of Herman and is the DW that descendeth upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commandeth a blessing even life forever more why does he talk about the DU of Herman why was that D like the rose of Sharon because in the slopes of Mount Herman that's where the Jesus the Mount of transfiguration that that happened that was the Mount of transfiguration and the slopes of Mount Herman so you can imagine why the the the perfume that was there but notice when we what we read in Song of Solomon he was not only the rose of Sher he also was the lily of the valley not only a perfume from the rose but what does a liily produce oh it produce opium op op can you imagine oh some of these Dr attics knew about it they'll probably look for lies all over the place what does all op do it eases the pain that's what doctors give a patient in the natural he gives them opium to ease the pain but in the spiritual and you have a pain you have a pain for a loved one you have a pain to get rid of your habits you have a pain to get a things from the world let me this morning give you a shot of opium amen that's what the lily of the valley does amen amen that's but there's was another kind of liily there was a lily of the pond brother bam in 1933 in a mighty Pond he says I dedicated this ground to Jesus Christ it was all P nothing but lies grew there and I dedicated to the Lord and you know that the Lily is born in mud and he has to pass through all the mud to get to the top to show its beauty and then it reflects the lily of the valley and there in that ground that he dedicated they built Bram Tabernacle ah but there's another Lily notice St Matthew chapter 628 and why take you thought for rainmen consider the lies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin the L of the valley was Jesus Christ and the lily of the valley produced The Lily of the pond because Brandon Tabernacle was built in by on that pond and from the lily of the pond that's where the message came from and when the message came out from the L of the pond It produced The Lily of the field which is you amen that's where Isaac MRE Rebeca in the field so why are the days shortening and the word will be cut short Genesis 3 verse 23 therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to teal the ground from when he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the we of the Tree of Life so he placed cherubim and I already I already taught you of those cherubin the living creatures two guard not the tree to guard the way Jesus said I am the way to guard the way so there was more more than one cherubim but notice that was not the only thing that guarded in the middle of the cherubim there was a sword and notice I asked the question which of that of those cherubims held the sword none of them the sword was by but notice that that sword that sword was taken out of the ship it was unshield the sword no there was that sword when a sword is taken out of the sheath or the quiver it means judgment judgment had taken place in the Garden of Eden notice let's go a little further the door was closed to the tree of the way to the Tree of Life and to open a closed door you need a key and Adam had lost the key to Satan remember when Jesus on the cross even brother said even when he was dead he was still working because his Spirit went to God but his soul went to to the the prison where Satan was and he took the keys away from him Satan had the keys but notice here I don't want to get ahead of my you know to open a closed door you need a key that's why the they had the chuban were there guarding that place let's go to Revelation 3:7 now it's going to get good not because I'm ministering I saw KB last time that he ministered I told I mean you're like a lion trying to bring out the message and you want to bring it just like God gave it to you oh if you know why I had a shot of opium this morning that's why I mean it it it makes me feel young cuz I got that opium inside of me it makes me do things that guys that take different drug drug and I don't know cuz I never took drugs oh they and I feel so good take a this I would hear them I never did but I would hear them you but you know I got a different drug in me I saw Fel this morning leading song and there he was dancing here brother Fel because he took a good hit also that's why we're twins you and I brother Fel amen I like to see a brother and sister like that so then notice and the angel of the the church in Philadelphia write these things he that is Holy he that is true he that has the Key of David he that open and no man shth and shth and no man open I not hit David this morning maybe next time I Know Thy works behold I have said before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and kept my word and has not denied my name the Key of David you need to open the closed door what is the Key of David Isaiah 2222 and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open notice I will lay it upon his shoulder so where did he put it Isaiah 96 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace that's where the Key of David was put the that the government was upon his shoulder so notice every church every denomination they claim to have the key oh they got the Methodist key they have the Pentecostal key every every church has the key but what do they open with that key they cannot open what was shut in the Garden of Eden their sword was there and none of the cherubim had the sword so who have the sword notice the notice the key is the key the message of the hour no the key is the message of the hour and what holds the key you can only know God God by faith which faith is revelation so Faith holds the key and what does the key need to turn the key he needs a hand he needs a hand to get a hold of the key the key is there but it needs a strong hand of Faith to turn the king amen hallelujah amen St Matthew 22:41 we're going into deep territory you need to keep up with a revelation I can cannot give Revelation to no one you know that is the word of God you either believe or you die in your sins notice St Matthew 22 41 while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked saying what think you of Christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of David who had the where was the Key of David he says unto them how then does David in spirit call him Lord the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foot stool David call him Lord how is he his son and no man was able to answer him a word neither does any man from that day forth ask him any more question so it was someone that had the authority notice the Lord said unto my Lord oh I wish I could get to where I want to get uh it would shake you on your boot but we'll see how far the Lord takes us this is good like I said not because I'm bringing it I know no man after the flesh it is the word of God and I'm giving you scriptures to back up the word of God notice Revelation 1 1 10 I was on the spirit and the Lord day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet I was in the spirit on the Lord's day the Lord said unto my Lord so who who's which Lord is he speaking here in Revelation one I told you you're going to have to keep up with a revelation how many lords are there verse 12 and I turned to see the voice that SP with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man closed with a garment down to the foot and G above the peps with a golden girdle he was clothed with a garment who clothed him who gave him the Garment they were naked in the Garden of Eden so they they in order to cover their nakedness they s fig lipes that's why it says learn a par of the Fig Tree because is was naked when they were in the other countries Israel could never be clothed until they came to the Homeland cuz why did they return back they returned because they say we want to see the Messiah you cannot go to the presence of God until you clothed how are you clothed with the same garment you got to be clothed with that garment that's so Israel was naked and they had to be clothed and there was zakus Z was just a little guy and he wanted to see the message and how could he see him because when you are grounded you only see physical things if you want to see the Lord you got to go higher to Heavenly places so zus he went up the tree because he was high up there zus was still under the law you know what he did he did what his fathers did he hid behind the Fig he went up a tree the tree is a fig tree that's where Z was hiding the Lord said get take C your fake Lea and come here and I will clothe you amen amen so the first Adam was naked but what about the second Adam St Matthew 26 61 H and as they did it he said ver you know what I think didn't did I I wanted um 61 yeah okay verely I say unto you that one of you shall betray me no it was I it was Matthew 26 okay that's fine I'm sorry I gave you the wrong scripture you're you're you guys are right I'm wrong I need certain St Mark 15:13 is that what we got yeah okay and they cried out again crucify him then pilate said unto them why what evil has he done what evil has he done and they cre out the more exceedingly crucify him and so pilate willing to contend the people released Barabas unto them and delivered Jesus when he had scored him to be crucified and the soldiers L him into the Hall called pretorium and they called together the whole band and they clothed him with purple he was naked the same as the first Adam was naked he was naked and they clothed him with purple what is purple it is a Roman Church they are called the purple curtain so they dressed him with their Doctrine but God had another garment for him and they took off that garment notice close with a garment where did he get the Garment St John 20 one give you scripture so you can study the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the Seer and see the stone taken away from the then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and sayith unto them they have taken away the Lord out of the Seer and we know not where they have laid him Peter therefore went forth and then our disciple and came to the Seer then they ran both together and the other disciple did all run Peter and came first to The Seer and he stood down and looking in saw the lining cloth lying yet when he not in the Jesus resurrected and the garments were there notice that Mary Magdalene there did not enterd she saw the stone removed she did not go into the the tomb she ran and told Peter and Peter and John when they got to the tomb there was nobody there but the laning clothes St Mark 16 Mar and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salom had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him verse five and entering into the the sep they saw a young man sitting on the right side closed in a long white garment and they were afed ah there somebody got the Lord left left that Ling close and only somebody who was Worthy could be clothed with the same linen clothes and I already gave you the scripture in Ezekiel that the man clothed with white linen put a Mark or the seal on those that cried and S for the Abomination so John there in Revelation one he saw one like the son of man clothed with a garment you see where he got the Garment the Lord said unto my Lord we're going into something good and he was G around the peps and didn't says that the government was upon his shoulder with with the Key of David so this one like the son of man the GLE not around the waist but on the shoulder why oh keep stay with me notice the government shall be upon his shoulder when did John saw this the SC moved from the aisle of pmos to Heaven that's where John saw this one like the son of man with a girle around the shoulder it means that he was no not a priest because he says that this man had his feet like breast and breast means judgment the Lord th the SW in the Garden of Eden was a sword of judgment and like I said here he was no not in service because if he had had the girdle around the waist he would be serving the people he would be a priest but the GLE was not around the way the government shall be upon his shoulder The Sword in the Garin was a sword of judgment here he was a judge notice what it was not the son of man he was one like the son of man brother Bram Bram was in the office of priest from 1933 to February the 27 1963 brother Brandon was in the office of priest that he was picked up on that cloud in February the 28th 1963 was in the office of Judge he was judgment was coming during the time when he was a priest and when around the world he was a priest he was ministering to the people he was praying for them he was Discerning them because he was ad ministered to the people but the time came that he changed his ministry he said he told M I must go to see what the will of the Lord is and the time before he was lifted to the cloud he went up to the mountain and when his hands were up a sword a sword to his hand it was the sword that was in the praise the Lord amen there was a man who could handle the sword all the time when the when the sword was taken from the Garden of Eden and and is T was taken to heaven and when Jesus resurrected he went to the right hand but when he was there there was someone when he saw the open door and the right hand means the authority and who gave the the brother Brenham The Authority Daniel 7 no nothing notice nothing first uh give me St John 5 one single leave it there anyway St John 522 says God judges no man look here it is for the father judg no man but has committed all judgment unto the son so did he have the authority Daniel Daniel saw the same thing that John saw Daniel 7 79 I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool then we read that in Revelation one that he hair was white as wool is the same thing that Daniel saw here he was taken to the Ancient of Days Daniel 713 I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man and he came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they B him before him when did this happen it happened in January 28th 1963 he was lifted up to meet the Ancient of Days whose hair was white as W the Ancient of Days how can if God is eternal God does not age the white hair not because he was old it was the wisdom it was the experience and he came he was brought before the ancient of day and the cloud where brother benen was lifted up it was the wig it was the wig the English judges put a wig in England before they judge that was where notice verse 14 and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom see wasn't he given Authority wasn't he given power cuz he got it from the Ancient of Days he was given all the Authority all the authority you want a squirrel oh if you if you want a squirrel ask for it Am I Dreaming squirrels do not go up poon Oak I want a squirrel on that poison oak notice Moses when he wanted a a miracle they had to do something they had to use something or get sand and thrown up in the air but this one had all the authority he said speak the word that's all he had to do is speak the word all the authority was given to the amen hallelujah so judgment was coming he was given The Sword and the sword was not in the Shi the sword when brother get it was taken out of the Shi and it came to the hand cuz he was on the right hand during the that little kid that was in the Tomb with the little clothes matured when John saw him and they gave him the sword judgment was coming judgment when Noah was in the ark who shut the door and when God shuts the door nobody can open the door and here the door was shut in the garden of so you needed a key and the key is the sword which is the message of the and it takes a strong hand of Faith hold the sword amen amen time flies when you're having fun the door was shut someone had to open the door why Revelation 311 there behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou H that no man take away your crown take your crown what is a crown hold fast that what you have what do you have this morning what is a crown I have fought the good fight I have kept the revelation of the hour we're almost finishing our course but there's a crown that's waiting me is a crown and somebody has a crown he's got to have a kingdom he got to have a domain what is a domain it is the Earth because the Earth belong to the first and Satan took it away from him what is the earth you are the Earth we are made out of the earth body is a crown the crown that you will receive is a crown of eternal life that's the crown cuz you going to have a domain and in the Millennium you'll build houses you plant Gardens you plant trees and that's your dominion and nobody can take it away from you there will be no devil to take it away amen this is the you know why the days will be shorted because this is the age behold I come quickly lady o is the shortest age the the age that was shortest before lady OA was Ephesus Ephesus only lasted 117 years but lady it started in 1906 do the meth do the math we're in two 9 and Lady started in 1906 we've been gone almost uh 113 years and this generation shall not pass in other words we cannot go to the same time as Ephesus we got four more years to go so it's between now and those four years I come quickly and the days will be Chen you have little strength why do they have little strength I Know Thy works you know why they have little strength all the ages overlap the other ages this is the age of the overlap what happened that they had to cut the days short because this the seventh Church age is the carryon of the sixth Church age and that's why it's a short age together itself for one short quick work I Know Thy works that are neither hot nor cold you have nothing but little strength you know why he has to cut the days short because all the filth all the evil of the other Church it hit the last AG it was D into lady o the last age very short age so he has to cut the work short or no flesh will be saved the open door the missionary age the you know the this the open door was in the door the Philadelphia age go to all the world and preach the gospel so Philadelphia did goph they preached all over the the world the greatest missionary age there was but they only preached the word God said do go preach the gospel because the word the letter kill they only preach the word but you got to make the word alive preaching with a power of the [Applause] Resurrection oh notice you have made the Word of Life the woman at the well said our fathers worshiped in the Apostolic Church they worship in the Catholic church but the Lord said the hour is coming and now is when neither in the Pentecostal Church in the Catholic church but you'll worship Him in spirit and in truth what is truth the message amen cuz it was somebody that was clothed that brought us the message because you and I were naked somebody had to clothe us and he says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout is a shout it is to close you it is to put the wedding garment on you oh I wish I could go deeper into that but I had take me Noti as we turn the corner Caleb has given me the green light for me stay as long as I want to but because of that privilege I don't want to abuse I want to leave you in suspender Stony Tony and Lena I love those people not only them I love all of you I'll never forget Lena when you were living in Lordsburg let me give some flowers this morning I've preached all the time since I was in silver there a silver people give flowers to somebody who dies so you see their grave site full of flowers two days after that they're dry and welted why do a dead person want flowers give them flowers while they're still alive let me give flowers to two couples in this church you see M andik I love that Nika was real close with my wife and me and Mike were real good friends they moved to Dem and they would drive during the week and on Sunday they would never miss a service and during the week they came first and people that had the church in their backyard now was here Tony and Lena they lived in Lordsburg Lord they would go to church during the week they would drive on Sundays they were there all the time and there people that had the church in their backyard and their little teeny finger hurt they wouldn't want they wouldn't go to church but they would drive through the wind and the rain and the snow to be in church you know what Mike Anda Tony and L all that is in is written in the book God knows everything that you do and the love that you had for the word of God you don't know you know how much Tommy the founding Pastor love you people and some of us like I've said before if the shoe fits put it on and if it hurts it's for us to repent so we could live a life that's worthy of the gospel because these two couples have set an example I take my head off to them amen amen let me finish with this the word c notice the the woman at the well what is the open door it was in the midst of Philadelphia and Lady oia he said an Open Door the open door was somebody says well what kind of door was it you know what the open door was the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ and you have not denied my name they had lost the name Luther came out with a name that we was alive but he only came out with Father Son and Holy Ghost that was not the name cuz the the Holy Ghost age was the Ephesus age and God built his church upon the revelation of himself you know what I feel checked to stop there there's so much I have so much and I don't want to open anything else I will continue from where I left off CU it's got so much you thought I went a little deep you haven't heard anything yet my next message it's going to go deeper but don't you just enjoy the word of God Amen so we're going to go into the Lord said to my Lord and people say John went from pmos and he went to heaven when in the
