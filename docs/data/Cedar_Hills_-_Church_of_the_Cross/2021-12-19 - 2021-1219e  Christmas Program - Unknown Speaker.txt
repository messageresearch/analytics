well looks like i lost them i'm going a bit happy all righty sitting this one out you kiddies really did a number on him sticking your hands in his brains poking his eyes out that was awful so let me think three little beans three stooges the three what i think it says up here now i can't read trees oh yeah yeah i think i know this one the three little trees well let me tell you what happened long long long long long ago on a high hilltop overlooking the city of bethlehem was three trees not one not two but three trees how many trees do you see okay very well then let's continue with our story no interruptions please now these trees weren't just ordinary trees they were planted for a purpose far beyond their understanding there was a greater purpose for these trees god had these trees planted in this exact spot for a special reason but of course just like human beings they sometimes spend way too much time dreaming about the things that they wanted to be and where they thought they wanted their life to go they just like my dreams oh i know exactly what i want to be at us atlas what do you want to be i want to be cut down be made into a treasure box just like this one right here it's nice on where i hold all the gold and jewels and shiny stuff and all the riches of the king be filled with diamonds so many rubies and tons of gold i hold the most priceless treasures ever it will be the greatest treasure box any human will lay its eyes on oh that's that's good that's some good stuff very fancy i'll be the most beautiful treasure chest in the world you know that that sounds all grand and great but you know me i'm better than you so i have a bigger dream oh really once i get cut down i'll be turned into the greatest ship the world has ever seen kings and queens across the ocean imagine me as a mighty large ship all the other ships from all the coasts will be so jealous of my beauty and to think only the finest of fine will ride on my ship the best whoa that is a dream what a dream well i mean your dreams are all great and all but i'm just sitting here thinking to myself why would you want to be cut down i mean the purpose of a tree is to not be cut down my dream is way better than both of yours put together you see all never be cut down i'll be the highest tree in the land and i'll grow and grow and i'll tower all the other trees that ever existed all the people will always look to me as the years and generations go by i'll stand on this mountain right here and when people see these big huge branches they'll raise their eyes towards heaven and they'll think of god so one day a woodcutter climbed a high mountain as the woodcutter looked for a tree he found tree number one this tree is perfect for me said the woodcutter so with a swoosh of his axe the first tree fell to the ground then the next day as the woodcutter was looking for another tree he found tree number two this looks like a strong tree he thought it's perfect for me and with one swoosh of his axe oh oh i'm finally getting cut down but it kind of hurts the second tumbling down and it rolled down the cliff then the next day the third woodcutter looked again for another tree i don't need anything special today he thought any tree will do and with a swing of his axe the third tree hit the ground oh man about the third tree what's gonna be of my dreams now my goal is to never be cut down let's get going come on boy no i didn't want to be cut down that wasn't my dream and there the three trees got taken away so the first tree was cut up and made into a feed box for animals the once beautiful tree was not covered with gold and with no treasure was it placed but instead put in a stable and filled with hay now the second tree was taken down to a seashore but no mighty ship was made that day instead the once mighty tree was made into a simple fishing boat and the third tree was cut into two large beams with no real use for it yet and was just left in a lumber yard wow so the years went by but the trees had not forgotten their dreams and god's plan for them was about to unfold one night a golden star from the heavens above shined into a stable and there a young girl placed her baby boy to be born in the manger wow into that feed box that was made of the first tree her husband joseph wished he could have made a for the newborn child but this box would do just fine suddenly the first tree realized something important he was now holding the greatest treasure of all time far beyond anyone had ever seen the first tree's heart was so full of joy for the savior of the world had come down as a little baby and he was chosen to hold jesus years later a group of men climbed into a fishing boat that was made from the second tree one of the men got very tired that night and he fell asleep while they were out on the water a great storm arose some of the men were so afraid that the ship would sink they went and woke the sleeping man the man stood up on the boat stretched forth his little hand and he said peace be still and the storm stopped as quickly as it began suddenly the second tree realized it was carrying the king of heaven in earth he rejoiced when he realized he was made to carry the king of glory across the sea not long after that some men came to a lumber yard and took the beams made from the third tree those beams were carried through the streets as an angry crowd mocked the man who was carrying these beams his blood and tears were stained on those beams as they continued to a top of a hill called golgotha this man's hands and feet were nailed to the beams and there in the form of a cross and he raised up high for the world to see and left to die but three days later everything changed the man who once hung on the third tree had risen from the dead the third tree realized that it had become some such a great symbol of god's great love for all of eternity that all through the ages everyone who looked to that cross would remember the love and sacrifice that jesus had made for them and that tree was never forgotten you see go ahead and give the lord my mama wasn't that great kiddos you enjoy that wait for me no bear i'm starting to think you're not a bear at all i'm barely a bear that was a good story happy i sure did enjoy it a lot of times we don't know what we want with our own lives but god always knows what to do with us that's right and he gave us the greatest gift of all his son jesus christ yes sir and it also taught me to always be happy with what we're given that's right you know a lot of times we want one thing but god wants another it kind of reminds me of that white elephant gift exchange last night oh yeah sorry for all y'all youth that got your feelings hurt but i guess god had a different plan for you didn't he yeah i guess so like toilet bowl nightlights yes sir maybe they need them well as always children it's been good to be here with you and why don't you all stand as we get ready to receive our children's play tonight well i just can't wait i can't wait either i'm in great expectation so with that let the story begin [Music] [Music] let's sing that song do you hear what i hear said the night went to the little land do you see what i see [Music] way up in the sky little lamb do you see what i see [Music] a star a star dancing in the night with a tail as big as a kite with a tail said the king to the people everywhere oh listen to what i say pray for peace people everywhere [Music] oh listen to what i say the child the child sleeping in the night he will bring us goodness and light he will bring us goodness down [Music] amen you all may be seated at this time [Music] you go tell it on the mountain they continue to get ready amen how many love the lord i saw maybe five hands go up one more time how many love the lord [Music] kept their watching or silent blocks by night behold throughout the heavens [Music] [Applause] [Music] on the [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] blocks by night behold throughout the [Music] heavens on the mountain [Music] [Applause] everywhere [Music] every [Music] and every way [Music] and everywhere [Music] everywhere [Music] jesus christ [Music] today the church has soup suppers pie suppers see who can dress the best going to the church for glory who's got the best church the besties who can play this who can do that and the old room all times he got something else to do besides perhaps they can't pray anymore they got something else to do they can't pray anymore they just can't learn to serve god like he used to no room for him in the end and this has been the end times no room for me of course i know what that is but i've been referring to the sin but the bible said in that day one of the almond tree shall flourish the desire of man shall fail because he goes to his own home and the word is going out the street are the silver card be broken this picture broke of the fountain oh mercy my friends but the prophet has come to a place now that the people realizing that the deity and their power almighty god is living in the human beings welcome to our christmas program and thank you all for coming before we get started what you're about to see does include some timeline inaccuracies don't worry we are aware that wi-fi and iphones did not exist at the time of jesus's birth but these were included in the part for your entertainment value but mostly in attempts to bring this closer to home and provide us just a hint of what joseph's and mary's journey might have looked like in some ways today at this time the roman emperor caesar augustus augustus ordered a census this had everybody scrambling and traveling to their birthplaces to be counted in the senses i say it's going to take a miracle to keep everyone happy i mean look at all those people it's like a holiday around here that's it we call ourselves holiday inn we'll not catch you our sec our final group are siblings true manny short for emmanuel who they have recently inherited the inn from their grandfather as it's very important to him also very important to him are his grandchildren in fact he named it in after his first grandchild true yes yes fresh milk right away you'll be right up with batteries for the remote i'm sorry what do you mean you have the door to your room but it doesn't have hinges you know this is the business we've ever been not even grandfather has this place as packed as we do and he owned it and you're out here dusting a manger news flash man they're animals they don't care if it's messy and i could really use your help in there i'm gonna need those hinges back milk i wasn't clean this time true i was praying hey when grandpa lets us left us this place the major was a part of it this is where he was his favorite part this is where he came to be at peace and pray i know that you might not get it but i get it let me explain something to wait in that way that you might get it if the end is not a success there's no money to feed the animal okay i get it i'll be there in a second hand over those hinges yeah i can't do that let me explain something in a way that you might get it if i don't fix the skate then betty might get out eventually [Applause] [Music] that means no i bet hey [Applause] if betsy gets out that means no freshman for a guest besides we're the only game with manger if we fix this gate may repaint the wood put up some lights it could be a real hit it could be a tourist spot the manger that people talk about for ages i want people to talk about this old dusty manger it's gonna take a real miracle as most of us know shortly after young mary was betrothed to joseph she was visited by the angel gabriel gabriel tells mary that she that the holy ghost shall come upon her and she shall bear a son of god and his name shall be jesus close to jesus birth murray finds herself traveling to her husband's hometown bethlehem for the senses my positive is definitely gonna happen tonight i'm just saying the angel gave us a prophecy and even a name but he never gave us a date i just don't think anybody can surely tell the day or time of his comic when i stand up for this job now to be nobody told me that belonged to the traveling vlog i better get paid mileage i should do this i should have listened to my mother and god don't get university in medicine dumb it's not that much yeah well i should have listened to my mother and spent the extra shekels for a cold well i hope this little guy listens to his mother better than the two excuse me sir i hate to interrupt but it's an emergency there's no vacancy didn't see the sign outside well no it's just pretty dark again and what i'm supposed to leave the lights on for you here at motel 6. [Applause] well no you see it's mary my wife she's a child and a king you don't believe me i unbelieve you i mean don't you have any kids a five-year-old son nemocis if you knew malcus was going to be something great wouldn't you do anything he is born to be something great a roman soldier what you know he have the guts for it i just hope he has the ear for it i'm telling you it's raining shackles in here i was even able to bring in a little profit with valet camel parking speaking of a little prophet mary ow no not you this guy keeps talking about his wife marry this and marry that as of the whole sentence about her they should rename it mary census hi i'm joseph and hi joseph i'm sue super as you might have seen out on the hotel sign oh so you named the hotel after yourself so then what's date for is there eight of you no we're just the ethan on this road we're thinking of a new name we keep telling sue that super 8 sounds ridiculous well maybe the new name can include you guys what's your name everybody calls me raw and this is mata bra that has a ring to it like i was saying all we can offer is census card as there is no room at the end sorry wait if the last guy was the sixth in and you guys are the eighth well there's gotta be a separate one right yeah it's at the crossing of the hill you mean next to the cute major huh i never noticed the manger still at it i don't suppose ever many guests will be handy with tools i'm not asking any of our guests to come work on a manger manny at this rate i'm just going to sleep at the i think i broke even more at this rate i'm just going to sleep at the drawer and make sure the animals don't escape well that's an idea but here's another since you're out here why don't you just pray about it that's not a bad idea [Music] hi i am a carpenter and you look like you could use some help do i ever uh it's happening what's happening that night there were shepherds in the field with their sheep and and the angel came to tell them that the savior has been born which is christ the lord the angel even told them that they could find a baby wrapped in soil and swaddling cloth lying in a manger oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] you new need a baby have you seen one we were with our sheep on the field and they were like and then uh angel came and then like he was like don't be afraid and then good what's man all right all right calm down start from the beginning well in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and that's word just a little more so moses and the people were in the desert and the rock full of the group man i found him you started with moses what was i supposed to start with hey we just saw a whole a whole host of angels out on the field yeah sounds like a movie angels in the outfield sorry for the interruption i just got a group of shepherds in here i'm not sure what they wanted i think they said something about starting a rock group they sure like to talk about their moses though i mean i could be like moses i grew a white beard put on a red outfit and instead of plagues i could give gifts i would have their kind follow me like a cloud by day forget about old traditions after a long trip and i'm finding a room he's actually here something tells me that was the easy part i'm sure you're gonna be a great model actually he's going to be mine he seems so peaceful you think he's cold i have this i'm sorry we can give you some more comfortable no this was great it was so comfortable inside you can rename the place comfort in or since mary or since mary loves this place so much you could call it the merry art don't get him started he already thinks this place is a tourist attraction especially since we have the only under the manger on this road i don't know who he thinks he's going to attract especially especially since people usually tie their camels and donkeys to places you'll find anywhere well i don't know true sheep but about sheep can't type them to oppose so shepherds could use the field here's the manger right ever to sleep in the fields cramp how do you keep doing that where is he is it him it's him there he is he is here the messiah has come prophecy fulfilled right they forgot their cane it's called a staffer cook i haven't i have an idea we can sell these the k exactly again guy is not a cane we can make little candy canes every year around every year for the locals around the senses what locals are shepherds and the romans yep yep we will make them white since shepherds like sheep and red since romans wear red where do you come up with these ideas i can't believe you lost a star it's not like i have google maps i'm telling you came over here somewhere well i don't think we'll find him over here i mean it this place has a zero star review didn't you see the sign we're closed well actually that's why we're here because we saw the sign we've been following a heavenly sign looking for the one born king of the jews whoa you guys look loaded i mean looks like you take a load off if you need a place to stay we don't you know your sign is misleading it says when we tell six but judging by the sizing condition it's clearly an in yeah well in sick sounds a lot like insects and i didn't want people to think this place was crawling around with locusts well it is so again your sign is misleading what a bunch of wise guys it's him the king hey sue look at this it seems like the star has attracted more people rich ones hopefully that star plans on sticking around since we have the best view of the star we could charge we could bring in extra people and charge higher prices we could charge higher prices and bring in some extra bucks that's it we could call ourselves starbucks do you even hear yourself herod wants to do what yeah i know malcus is under two still me mention a baby dollar uh i think i think my battery's night something about this doesn't seem right joseph shepherds and the wise guys all said the same thing is this possible i think i need to go find out where have you been all day i've been talking to mary and will think about all that's happened remember the the book of isaiah and micah do you know what this means we're going to have to call mom and dad and tell them they were right uh how about just a text message a text is good we have mary a baby shower you think they're you think they're registered somewhere i mean what kind of gifts that we can get that's going to be with those rich guys i'm pretty sure one of them brought up straight up gold [Music] [Applause] it'll come [Music] oh [Music] jesus oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him christ the lord amen i believe we can do a little better than that and man give a
