them that he was going to have to send me to a specialist somewhere else for surgery so the next step was to do a cat scan it's again deposited instead of examining cat skin so we did that and my follow-up was monday so i went back to the surgeon lunas i began to pray out loud you come and say so the surgeon comes in yes sits down and he looks at me and he is significant he said your ribs are together that there is the um cartilage and the muscle tissue between the ribs are still healing and i just want to thank the lord jesus so much for this healing and i want to thank everyone who was

[Music] we wanted to give a little uh report on how it went and uh i wanted to start off if we could yes by reading a scripture in the scripture is matthew 11 28. and it reads like this is this yasi come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest you know oh you may be seated you know everyone had a had a reason for going on this trip i i did two and and i knew it the uh i was pretty tired um i was pretty tired of uh like the hebrew children going in a circle a circle of my own sin and i remember that scripture that says come unto me all ye that labor and i'm heavy laden and i will give you rest and uh there i realized that there remaineth rest for my soul it would cost me everything that i was as brother danny said a total separation [Music] you know meeting the brothers there seeing how much they love just how much they love you all viendo viendo los hermanos como los amanos how much they love the pastor but moreover how how much they love the lord it really uh it really encouraged me to see [Music] i had got up there and i said that they were they were bold like lions and i actually got a picture of brother tommy we could show it and uh this is what i saw in each one of those men over there yes you know from the first service going there this is it was pastor matthias's church and how brother tommy junior says it ruins you and they ruined me and you know i go in and you hear the the way they worship and you hurt me is that was a you know i feel like in a sense i i wasn't ready it uh it kind of it shook me it made me question me down to my core my my challenge was a little different from others this was the first missionary trip i ever went on i had a my challenge was you know for a long time i've been plagued with you know being a coward i've been scared of getting up here and giving a testimony and uh as i was there i remember i was so shocked that brother caleb was introducing us and the only thing i remember from that service anything that the brother said actually brother caleb it was uh he said he sets the captive free he was reminding me everything he set me free from it i began to realize that you know my job up there was to give a testimony testimonial i began to realize that i wasn't given a testimony but i was making a confession i began to realize that i wasn't even in africa in africa but i was in caesarea philippi de filippo it was the it was a place known as the gates of hell a place known of people eagerly knocking at that door of the gate to hell he presented a clear challenge to them he didn't want his his disciples and running from evil but he wanted them to storm those gates in the bible caesarea philippi is is known for something greater caesarea philippi is and we let the enemy know whose side we were on you know there on the trip i learned the word what what it truly means you know sometimes over here we we overuse it and under appreciate what the word brother means over there they uh i really learned that whenever i was i questioned myself i was in doubt there were my brothers there too to talk me through it to identify with me [Music] there they were to minister to me to pray with me word says that his light will guide us there i saw that light that i saw that light in each one of my brothers not only did it guide those people of africa in africa but when my darkness was trying to set it and it uh not only guided me but it lit a light that i had no idea i had no solo brother danny said on sunday no matter how how long they've been dead how long they've been in darkness you know for 29 years i've been shackled lord the bible says come and see her god bless each and every one of you um i i try to i try i try to search in this whole trip intentions try to search one thing that that really was a great experience and really changed my life and i couldn't find it i it was not one part it was the whole trip that changed my life i am so grateful for my pastor for him i wouldn't be here today for my wife she's her prayers and supporting me it really helped me forgive me i could get very emotional i'd like to thank my parents as well for supporting me it was a wonderful experience that monday when we we weren't able to fly what we were supposed to lunas after we left el paso airport it already felt we were on the trip we were already in the missionary field right left el diablo us individually in category what really was beautiful was brother caleb had said in the beginning he he said on that he said on tuesday then it was the next day we had a meeting here at the church and he was just like sitting he was sitting right he was just talking you know what we're going to have a quick meeting and once he got in the pulpit you could feel the presence of the lord just come down in each and every one of us and the amazing thing about this experience experience like we're going into battle and our general was preparing each and every one of us he chose you he chose you for a reason and a purpose my tears just came out of my mouth i said lord you could have chose anybody else we went to the trip and and it and you see the people and like our brother justin says it ruins you it makes you see the things that you take for granted the desperation of the brothers i i had to pass out the bibles we had some bibles to pass out to every brother yes and they didn't sit they didn't wait on their seats every day we take that for granted and at the end of the the preaching um the brother asked um is anybody sick and this mother she raised up her son yonah and you could feel the presence of the lord right there and as they prayed for the boy after the prayer was finished on she did not have no disappointment but she had faith sometimes we expect things right away when we ask lord for something we sometimes we think for some reason the lord works for us and he doesn't see and just seeing her faith and her desperation for that boy to be healed i see that boy and i i think i thought of my my son my son what if i were in that position son it was just that desperation that faith that pool that they have it was it was supernatural one of the one of the other um greatest moments i had was at the end of whether and at the end at the end of his preaching he told every minister every pastor to grab like a chain and there was such unity and he said he had said that a chain is it strongest at its weakest link and i remember that moment brother jimmy was on my left side recorded and my brother aaron was in my right side and he said let the breeze of the holy spirit dwell upon you desperate brother jim we both felt the holy spirit come to all upon us and it was a calming breeze a joy um one thing one thing is to experience it individually experimental individual but another thing is to experience together as unity experiments i've learned so much in this trip from every young man every man that went aprendi especially for my pastor especially you know us you know sometimes in our in our minds we you know there there was this brother he was wearing this shirt you know it was very you know it was very halloween and you know it caught brother caleb's attention i was walking right by [Music] in the meetings in your mind you know you think these things well i have a video if the brother seth could could you show that video [Music] out of the teeth diamonds it didn't have teeth so they couldn't eat this and that's why it was there but when the gems began to come as the teeth [Music] started to eat and as it ate skin began to cover a body came um because now it's eating yeah so that's when when i saw your shoulder the lord reminded me of that thing that's what it is i told myself i should be ashamed of myself that's probably his now favorite go-to shirt i learned so much and i appreciate each and every one of the brothers that went aprenditanto yeah and i encourage the youth instead of saving for that sports car or a new iphone or algomas safe for that trip next trip god bless my brother amen god bless you amen this evening uh if we could all stand for the reading of scripture foreign [Music] [Music] but the lord gave me two scriptures isaiah 43. verse and the second scripture the lord gave me was job 42-5 we're all amen you guys could all be seated uh before i start with with my report i'd like to thank my my pastor reported he's always been there for me el siempre and before this trip i actually didn't really feel worthy to go on this trip but my pastor was there to encourage me i'd we had made plans to go on another trip before this uh and at that very moment she looks at me and she says you're going to africa africa and all the rest of my family the tremendous support that you guys have all given me familia now getting back uh i'm a barber of trade regression and i have many people come sit in my chair every day then go they must and i didn't tell many people where i was going to eva i honestly didn't even tell anybody that i was leaving work for a while so getting back to work everyone was like where have you been like what were you doing and i told them why i went on a mission trip to africa and everybody's response was wow what a great vacation i didn't have nothing to say to them at that point yes um no this this wasn't a vacation at all if anything it was probably one of the most tiring things that i've ever done in my life but if there's one thing for sure but that we went with the [Music] um as soon as two days or the day that we were supposed to leave [Music] a couple days before our trip both of my sons got really sick to the point where the night before we were supposed to leave i was up in the bathroom for about three or four hours with my son josh with the with the shower running on hot saudis and he wasn't able to breathe that night nope and that was a bit of a nightmare for us my copa test came back positive me me positiva the day before we were supposed to leave that night i was actually at justin's house and we were talking yes i noticed having a casa del mano justin establish platincondo we were sharing the notes and all the studying that we've been doing before before this trip compartment that night we were talking about how we have to have faith and who have to be able to speak things yes [Music] and i remember i started getting text messages everyone's saying oh i got my test it's negative negative so at that moment i checked mine and as soon as i opened it it was positive and if i've ever felt my heart sunk to the bottom of my stomach it was that moment that that at that point satan started telling me you're not going on this trip he was telling me that i was undeserving or unworthy to go on a trip like this brother justin was there to keep me up keep my spirit up i called my pastor and i let him know. and he told me something so assuring him [Music] [Music] you know nothing was going to stop the hand of god moving the preview had already been shown yeah and just like the pastor said all those that were in the preview with live action now i want to share with you a dream that the lord gave me [Music] in my dream we were on a big hot air balloon and it was the whole the whole team all 16 of us this is and at the moment he says all right give me give me uh give me the suitcase and he he looks at me and tells me open the door to the basket so i'm here standing and i open the door to the basket and there's a giant suitcase in front of him he was waiting for the right time esperando perfecto and when the right time came he grabbed the suitcase and he dumped all the gold over the next part of the dream i jump off of the basket and i'm looking for the gold because i want to put it in my pocket yes but where i'm looking is really dry it's real dry land but then i stumble across a big body of water [Music] you guys can't hear the sound but no now from the moment uh we drive up to the first service when we get there it was brother matthias's church we're inside the bus and we're a few hundred feet away from the church itself and you can hear them going to town worshiping is something that i had never experienced or heard before experimental everyone thought the same thought as soon as we drove up i said wow you can feel the spirit of the lord moving already so i start to fill my pockets with all this gold and i put in as much as i can carry my pockets and i turn and i start to climb up he asked me how was this trip i pulled all the gold out of my pocket and i gave him a piece emphasis brother henry romano henry i started giving everybody a piece of gold [Music] but i know that all your work here as a church as part of the body of christ all your work that you do here for the people of uganda it does not go unnoticed no no no no i don't know when this would happen or how no but all i can say is that god is the interpreter of his own word [Music] jesus bendigo good evening that was for you my buddy amigo uh and if you want to hear the story you can ask brother justin outside of services is everyone okay all right so this is how the story goes and let's stretch a little bit let's it's okay you can stretch this seminar we did head shoulders knees and toes do that here but the day prior el good morning buenos dias good morning buenos dias and i stood up in bed i said tell me good morning one more time and i'm going to launch this pillow at your leisure please stand disappointed and turn to the scriptures hebrews 13 8. how uh it sounds to be able to hear the scriptures you know brother philippe wasn't didn't miss it when he said we take a lot of things and it simply says jesus christ the same yesterday today no excuse me jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever jesus is and the scripture reads like this yes but jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible in miranda los jesus para brother seth if you could put the second picture please of the the church so this here is brother dan's church is you know there's there's not much more you can say than what the men have before may have said does it ruin you yes it does see was it a great vacation no it wasn't was it a vacation no no but where is my brother diego donas diego but i will tell you one thing my friend when i initially got in touch with brother caleb that i wanted to go in they they had made the call you know if anyone wanted to go either they wanted to eat after service [Music] and i you know i talked to my wife you should go and so i got in contact with with brother caleb one of the things that that really got me though was that i i told my wife the year to help serve but and that would be to and in my in my mind yes you know i'd carry brother kale's backpack carry books and i want to thank each and every one of you but without without your guys's prayers it wouldn't have been as successful and so from the bottom of my heart i want to thank each and every one of you you know we sit here and and we sing we clap we sit next to each other and there was one brother and so far this is all i know about you and i and i said you're the treasurer so we all know i'm talking about brother mark questions i go you got a really sick maroon suit and i know your boys love me and and i'll tell you this iguesto brother mark adamano mark it was an absolute pleasure to get to know you better if anyone has ever spoken to brother meyer but to have an opportunity to speak with that man to hang around him you'll realize that that is the one of the sweetest men you will ever meet you've heard of of the struggles and the hard times the different ministers and the different brothers have had to just get over there and it's true it was a witness i saw the the the airline workers say oh no you can't go because your test has to be within 24 hours and so finally we we get on the plane you know we fly to dallas and then another thing you have to fill out this form to be granted permission you land in qatar qatar and just so many different things well we get into into qatar or which is in uganda and uganda and we've already we thought okay finally we're done [Music] now most people will use the expression that man will give you the shirt off his back not only will brother sam give you the shirt off his back but he'll give you the pants off his legs and the socks but by the by brother sam's generosity me and brother jim for two days that was there at brother dan's church obviously you can't see me because i'm behind the camera but you know the chief says hey these are the men that are going to preach [Music] i had blue jeans on bartolones i had a white t-shirt on you and not a button-up not one you would go take outside you know and it was just absolutely phenomenal excellent to be a part to be a little part to be able to see the way the lord moved throughout the ministry to see how the people were so ready to receive but and to really be able to just take a step back and give god if you could go to the first picture that i had sent you it should be a picture of brother tommy during the conference conference when you saw the ministry move when you see the ministry speaking the way that they would venmos or better yet you would see the holy spirit speak through the ministry and you wouldn't even see the brothers anymore you wouldn't see like if brother ronnie was speaking foreign we didn't recognize as the brother speaking no no no and we were we were able to capture one of these photos of brother tommy junior tomasito and brother and you can see the brother in the background just taking notes hunting for souls for christ god bless you god bless you this evening well please stand and i'll just read one short scripture it is found in the book of psalms chapter 38 chapter 34 verse 8 it says oh taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him amen you may be seated i mean i just want to say that i'm so it's such an honor to be identified with people such as yourselves i'm so grateful that the lord opened a door for me to go back to africa he never ceases to amaze me you know i made the decision that i was going to go avi and that next day we haven't had any covet cases through the whole pandemic and i'm the one who's in charge of doing all the testing and reporting that stuff to the state but i had already made the decision i was going and anytime you're going to do something for the lord and when you have the the plans in your hands you can bet you can be assured that there's going to be a fight on your hands there will be a fight on your hands you know before i went on this trip i was looking at some land establish and so i called a realtor that was listed on this land and she was giving me some information on it and at the end of our conversation i was giving her my email and my email reads pillar of fire 65 at gmail electronic fuego and so you know after i gave her the email address she said are you a christian cristiano and i said yes ma'am i sure am there is a there's an anointing behind that email address and so we begin talking about the lord and consequence and i told her that we'd i'd be coming on a on a trip to africa and without hesitation this lady said i want to give you whatever money you need to get to africa you told me that you'd be praying for me and that for me is good enough for me she said if we could be there tomorrow we would go yes and she said so i want to write you a check for eighteen hundred dollars and she said and you use it however you feel that to use it [Music] [Music] my boss calls me in the office who's my grandpa and he said hey i have some good news for you he said they finally approved your raise and he but you're going to get back paid from six months back when you started that position so what's amazing about that is i didn't even have the pto the paid time off to go and i really didn't need it at that point so i want to thank the lord for doing that for me as you heard we weren't able to leave on that first monday because our we weren't able to get through with our covet tests and so on our way back from the airport we're coming back to las cruces and we're going to exit right there off to get on trans mountain is so she starts to veer into the lane and as soon as she gets in the lane to get off on the exit there is a semi in front of us and he puts his brakes on and so my reaction is to look in the rearview mirror and i see this man picking up a little boy off the road and it turns out he was riding a motorcycle he was riding a motorcycle and he had the little boy on the front of his bike so when he hit us all he could do is grab his son and the bike at 65 miles an hour the bike just slides on its side and just comes to a stop yes and it just so happened i had all my nursing gear because i had a first aid kit for the helios so we got the kid cleaned up he had busted his head pretty good but they were both okay and so you know we just got back on the road and us and you know some people might have said well maybe that's a sign you probably shouldn't be going but once you see yourself in the vision it don't matter what happens the actors are still the same amen i have testimony after testimony testimonial testimony one that really stood out to me was brother diego had shared a vision el hermano diego compartio the holy spirit was going to come down and fall upon these ministers it was going to sweep across the country so i was thinking it was going to come down in such a way that these people were going to be jumping and shouting and and what i would think the holy spirit would what you do you know that these people they didn't even know what to do with it they were trying to fight it someone tried to get out of hand but they just couldn't say that and there wasn't much emotion going on you could tell these people were eating and you know as we were getting to uh on another note we were getting to uh qatar and another part of the vision that was shared with us is that we were going into uganda and in uganda that country is ruled by a spirit of like a bull uganda so when somebody comes on their territory they get very violent and so we're on the but you know the vision said don't fear because i see you all coming in on a and our pastor said just as eliezer went and pulled out a bride on a camel come on so will you all be coming in on a camel to take the bride out of africa portion of the prize and i'm just taking back to the vision of what was told to us and he said as this bull wants to get you all and tear you apart and kill you he can't do it he knows you're there he's aware of you all yes but the holy spirit covered you from this bull perro and so if he could put the picture of the money up and so on top here we have some uh they're called the pitarian riles and that's their currency it has a picture of a camel and i was looking at this these uh this currency and it started to just preach to me and you're going to the pearl of africa which is uganda and in this middle photo here you see a a pearl inside of an oyster shell and he said you're coming on a camel to search out that pearl of great price and you see this ship here a camel is actually known as the ship of the desert it's because of the way they walk they move both legs on one side at the same time so if they're going forward here you see they're so poor in fact the vision even said that we haven't even seen the dark side of uganda every time we go i know the last part that was really outstanding to me was as brother felipe had shared that vision of the skull felipe he showed the video and the part that was amazing is how the lord had already shown brother diego that that was going to take place and that these people would now have teeth to be able to eat and nurture themselves and you know as we were sitting in that uh pastor's conference the highlight of my trip was just watching these brothers eat the highlight of my trip was watching these brothers it was a great joy and honor to be there with my brothers and grand and i'm just so grateful for the opportunity to speak to you all this evening amen would you please stand hear the lord jesus hand clap of praise for keeping our brothers safe and bringing them back may god bless you my brothers for sure didn't enjoy that report would you just close your eyes just worship the lord
