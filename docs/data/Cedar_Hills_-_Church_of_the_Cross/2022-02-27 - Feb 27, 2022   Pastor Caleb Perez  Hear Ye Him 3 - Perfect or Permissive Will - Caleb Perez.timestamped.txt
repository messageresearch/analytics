[1:04:18] san juan capital
[1:04:20] and the 38th through the 40th verse
[1:04:36] and it reads like this for i came down
[1:04:39] from heaven
[1:04:41] not to do my own will
[1:04:43] but the will of him that sent me
[1:04:46] this
[1:04:47] lord
[1:04:51] i'm gonna hear this morning can say
[1:05:03] not to do my own will not to do my own
[1:05:05] will but to do the will of him that sent
[1:05:08] me
[1:05:10] and this is the will of the father or
[1:05:13] the father's will
[1:05:15] which hath sent me yesterday
[1:05:18] that of all which he hath given me i
[1:05:20] should lose nothing
[1:05:27] but should raise it up again
[1:05:30] at the last day
[1:05:34] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:05:36] yesterday
[1:05:38] that everyone that seeth the son and
[1:05:41] believeth on him
[1:05:43] may have everlasting life
[1:05:46] and i will raise him up
[1:05:48] at the last
[1:06:02] give you a moment to find it
[1:06:10] and it says while he yet spake behold a
[1:06:12] bright cloud overshadowed them
[1:06:19] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:06:22] which said this is my beloved son in
[1:06:26] whom
[1:06:26] i am well pleased
[1:06:28] hear
[1:06:29] ye
[1:06:40] [Music]
[1:06:42] one more time neighbor
[1:06:44] here
[1:06:59] and the interpreter
[1:07:00] or the i'm sorry the song leader and
[1:07:02] and for all the specials god bless you
[1:07:04] for your efforts
[1:07:08] especially
[1:07:14] i'll start by saying
[1:07:17] what a time we're living in
[1:07:22] one more time what a time
[1:07:24] that we are living in
[1:07:26] a
[1:07:56] and we're all sitting on the front row
[1:07:59] watching it all come to pass
[1:08:03] what a time we are living in
[1:08:07] the gospel of the kingdom being preached
[1:08:12] that's how sometimes it's all
[1:08:15] doom and gloom
[1:08:19] but but what a time we're living in
[1:08:34] am i talking about anyone here
[1:09:03] and it behooves us to know where we are
[1:09:06] standing
[1:09:09] first corinthians 10 12 tells us
[1:09:14] therefore let him that thinketh he
[1:09:16] standeth take heed lest he fall
[1:09:43] where the complete full perfect will of
[1:09:46] god is unfolding as it is right now
[1:09:51] it's sad to say this is
[1:09:54] but so many people have lived for so
[1:09:56] long
[1:09:59] under god's permissive
[1:10:26] one more time we have been so
[1:10:28] comfortable living under god's
[1:10:30] permissive will
[1:10:35] think just because god blesses us
[1:10:39] that it automatically means we are in
[1:10:41] his perfect will automatically
[1:11:04] acts the 17th chapter and i want to get
[1:11:06] these scriptures and make sure that we
[1:11:08] that we we put them in this foundation
[1:11:27] i want to know here this morning how
[1:11:29] many of you has god ever winked at your
[1:11:31] ignorance
[1:11:36] anybody here
[1:11:38] a few of you god has i'm grateful to god
[1:11:41] that he has winked at my ignorance
[1:11:46] it says but now commandeth all men
[1:11:51] everywhere to repent
[1:11:55] yes god has winked at our ignorance and
[1:11:58] that means wink means time past
[1:12:03] but when the light of the blessed gospel
[1:12:06] has shone upon
[1:12:34] we think it's okay
[1:12:47] continues to keep us
[1:13:03] it means that you're tolerant of
[1:13:05] something
[1:13:08] when we're talking about god's perfect
[1:13:10] or his permissive will
[1:13:14] means that he's tolerant of something
[1:13:30] but it might not be what is the perfect
[1:13:32] will
[1:13:35] think of this as just something simple
[1:13:39] being born into this world
[1:13:43] through sex between the mother and the
[1:13:45] father
[1:13:47] was not god's perfect will
[1:13:50] you only know that
[1:13:52] god tells us
[1:13:55] but it's god's permissive will
[1:13:58] in other words he permits
[1:14:12] we were all
[1:14:53] but through a new
[1:15:05] and we come to find out what his perfect
[1:15:08] will is
[1:15:20] is that the majority of people
[1:15:41] and then the children think that that's
[1:15:43] the way really to serve the lord
[1:15:48] we can hide a lot of things
[1:16:03] oh
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:17] he said i was at home so i'm going to
[1:16:18] appreciate
[1:16:23] and we think that because god has
[1:16:26] tolerated certain things
[1:16:29] that he approves of us
[1:16:32] and once again i'm here to tell you
[1:16:34] that's not so
[1:16:36] casino to tolerate something doesn't
[1:16:38] mean you approve of it
[1:16:43] god
[1:16:44] is a holy god
[1:16:46] how many
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:17:00] and god does not work in number two or
[1:17:03] number five spot
[1:17:07] god will only work in the number one
[1:17:09] spot
[1:17:12] let me tell you something
[1:17:14] so that we can get this clear the
[1:17:16] picture clear
[1:17:19] god has never and will ever never ever
[1:17:23] ever
[1:17:26] hamas god will never no
[1:17:42] never
[1:17:56] hello
[1:18:09] the blood of jesus christ
[1:18:24] he knows that we need a little bit of
[1:18:26] time
[1:18:29] to where we need to get it
[1:18:32] so he is tolerant
[1:18:35] but it doesn't mean it's his perfect
[1:18:37] will but
[1:18:51] the coming of the lord is so close
[1:18:55] to yourself every day
[1:18:58] not just when you come to church
[1:19:00] check yourself every single day
[1:19:04] are you serving god under his perfect
[1:19:06] will yes
[1:19:19] it's the difference between the pride
[1:20:02] it was oscillating right in front of me
[1:20:06] in front of the bed
[1:20:08] and out of that light ides
[1:20:11] came forth an angel
[1:20:13] now to many people
[1:20:16] praise
[1:20:59] with mangoes
[1:21:00] do it like that in front of my bed
[1:21:04] and he said
[1:21:07] what i tell you
[1:21:11] most people was like whoa yes
[1:21:20] but my father said i kept looking at him
[1:21:22] and he said
[1:21:23] you do exactly what i tell you
[1:21:37] it was not scriptural
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:54] and i will tell you this
[1:22:09] in this church
[1:22:11] you better watch it
[1:22:14] let them be a curse
[1:22:16] whether it's angels or preachers
[1:22:21] how many have that much confidence in
[1:22:22] your past
[1:22:34] i said i will never do what you tell me
[1:23:04] you will
[1:23:59] and i said i will never preach
[1:24:01] permissiveness
[1:24:03] i will always preach god's perfect word
[1:24:09] what it cost me
[1:24:11] i want to know how many of you ministers
[1:24:13] could say that this is
[1:24:42] i
[1:24:48] [Applause]
[1:24:55] but the moment that a little bit of of
[1:24:58] pressure comes on us
[1:25:01] the first thing we do is our guy guess
[1:25:03] jesus lord don't love me
[1:25:10] he said i'll preach god's perfect
[1:25:13] will his perfect word
[1:25:17] no matter what it costs
[1:25:20] you know some of our life story
[1:25:24] much
[1:26:07] i'll still preach the perfect word
[1:26:12] now we're getting into something else
[1:26:16] watch where we're going
[1:26:18] i kicked him so hard he says
[1:26:48] because
[1:26:58] wait till we have to answer for every
[1:27:00] word that comes out of our mouths
[1:27:15] they've gotten away from the very
[1:27:17] foundation
[1:27:20] and they tolerate sin in church
[1:27:23] they tolerate unbelief
[1:27:27] and now
[1:27:29] people don't people think they don't
[1:27:30] need a pastor anymore
[1:27:39] i said people think they don't need a
[1:27:40] pastor
[1:27:43] necessity
[1:27:44] i think they can make it on their own
[1:27:49] that's not part of the foundation
[1:27:51] of the fundamentals
[1:27:54] hola
[1:27:55] does god ever change his mind about his
[1:27:58] words
[1:28:22] i won't even go into that because that's
[1:28:24] a whole
[1:28:26] another subject
[1:28:41] you know when brother branham talks
[1:28:42] about the cinematic woman
[1:28:45] he says this shooting my woman
[1:28:48] died
[1:28:51] she goes to where where the prophet is
[1:29:21] brown says he was her representative
[1:29:35] the resurrection of lazarus
[1:29:39] let me because my time is already going
[1:29:41] away from me and i haven't even started
[1:29:45] but listen to this
[1:29:47] when we think that we don't need a part
[1:29:49] of god's word anymore
[1:30:17] then how will you ever know god's
[1:30:19] perfect will
[1:30:21] without the mystery that he's placed in
[1:30:23] the church
[1:30:26] to bring you an eye to perfection
[1:30:30] doesn't matter that doesn't make sense
[1:30:31] the way that we think many times
[1:30:35] you'll never know god's mind
[1:30:38] you'll never know his perfect will
[1:30:44] and the ministry that he placed in the
[1:30:46] church
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:31:12] on that one
[1:31:41] how many believe that prayer can change
[1:31:43] the mind of god
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:50] some of you are you're pretty sure we
[1:31:52] should stand right now before i answer i
[1:31:54] want to see where he's going with this
[1:31:56] contest
[1:31:58] how many believe that that prayer can
[1:32:00] change the mind of god
[1:32:04] there's about one two three four five
[1:32:06] six okay well there's about maybe
[1:32:09] twenty thirty
[1:32:12] but i thought you just said that when
[1:32:14] you said a man a while ago
[1:32:17] i thought you said that god never
[1:32:19] changes his mind about it
[1:32:24] okay let me stop because i want i i'm
[1:32:26] not interested in running someone i want
[1:32:28] i want to get you this morning
[1:32:33] that god never changes his mind
[1:32:38] about his word
[1:32:40] ah that's right okay now we're you got
[1:32:43] to put it in there in the right place
[1:32:44] right
[1:32:46] god never changes his mind
[1:32:50] that's why brother branham would say
[1:32:52] this is
[1:32:59] when god was going to wipe out the
[1:33:00] children of israel
[1:33:03] and then here comes because moses says
[1:33:05] lord in the lord lord of lords
[1:33:28] [Applause]
[1:33:35] can his mind be changed about his word
[1:33:39] we're getting on a good track
[1:33:42] so how many believe that prayer can
[1:33:44] change god's program what is
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:34:01] i'm going to read to you from the
[1:34:02] message the works that i do bear witness
[1:34:04] of me well
[1:34:06] i got a testimonial of me brother
[1:34:08] branham says he says
[1:34:10] i know
[1:34:11] jose prayer changes things
[1:34:14] it even changes
[1:34:16] god's
[1:34:28] changes god's mind about
[1:34:44] and here we are as human beings that go
[1:34:47] to church
[1:34:50] we know a little bit about god now
[1:34:54] and when we hear this
[1:34:57] crazy oh praise god
[1:35:27] and prayer will change his mind about
[1:35:30] that
[1:35:32] it has been done he says
[1:35:35] and then he says remember hezekiah
[1:36:22] because
[1:37:16] without understanding what the
[1:38:00] end
[1:38:02] because then
[1:38:04] we get an attitude
[1:38:07] every time we pray we got to get the
[1:38:09] same results
[1:38:12] anybody here guilty of that argument
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:41] what's the matter que pasa
[1:38:55] is that anybody here
[1:38:58] we're on top of the world when he
[1:39:00] answers what do we pray for
[1:39:04] but when he doesn't
[1:39:06] contest oh my goodness oh this meal this
[1:39:09] is why it's so important to find the
[1:39:11] perfect will of yours
[1:39:15] though god will allow
[1:39:18] permissiveness
[1:39:22] you still are gonna have to deal with
[1:39:37] permissible
[1:39:52] there's always a price you got to pay
[1:39:54] for that
[1:39:57] i'm not seeking the perfect will of god
[1:40:05] that's
[1:40:06] why we complain all the time
[1:40:10] because we get comfortable living under
[1:40:12] god's permissive will
[1:40:17] we don't like the results
[1:40:20] of
[1:40:31] as my father
[1:40:32] had that experience
[1:40:57] that was 1951 when brother branham said
[1:41:00] that about prayers
[1:41:13] but watch 1965
[1:41:31] we are here on this earth
[1:41:34] and you know
[1:41:36] the only way we know or we say that
[1:41:37] we're saved by some jewish fable called
[1:41:40] the bible
[1:41:52] will take care of that
[1:41:53] watch this now i said now sir i don't
[1:41:56] know how you can say that
[1:42:11] he said i asked for so
[1:42:34] how many are honest how many how many
[1:42:36] prayed and you didn't get what you what
[1:42:37] you're praying for we all should
[1:42:42] watch what he says here
[1:42:44] and i didn't get it he said
[1:42:47] and then
[1:42:47] i said this is brother brad i'm saying
[1:42:50] i said
[1:42:51] because you prayed wrong
[1:42:55] watch him balance this out physical
[1:42:57] prayer changes the mind
[1:43:00] changes the program
[1:43:02] watch him balance everything else in
[1:43:04] 1965.
[1:43:07] you pray wrong
[1:43:19] because god's mind don't need change
[1:43:33] because we're always praying lord lord
[1:43:35] do this lord and do this foreign
[1:43:48] come on church i'm going to say it again
[1:43:51] god is perfect
[1:43:54] it is omniscient
[1:43:56] it knows all things
[1:43:58] the mind of god knows the beginning from
[1:44:00] the end
[1:44:03] god is infinite eternal
[1:44:07] it's pure
[1:44:09] perfect it's perfect why would me as a
[1:44:12] human being
[1:44:14] pray to change god's mind
[1:44:17] what do i want him to change
[1:44:26] do i wanted to change it to my finite
[1:44:29] mind
[1:44:31] do i want him to change it to my
[1:44:33] imperfect mind
[1:44:40] how many are with me
[1:44:44] and that's why the holy ghost is telling
[1:44:46] you this
[1:45:12] it's because we take the wrong attitude
[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:26] and i don't need an amen for that one
[1:45:37] we are creatures that always want to be
[1:45:39] in control
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:54] really
[1:45:58] absurd after a while
[1:46:01] it's absurd to think that we would want
[1:46:03] to change his mind
[1:46:07] it's because we're the ones that always
[1:46:09] want to be telling god what to do
[1:46:35] let me change your mind that's not the
[1:46:37] way it should be no this is
[1:47:06] then i'll believe
[1:47:20] them that love the
[1:48:02] let me make sure that you understand
[1:48:04] that
[1:48:05] there is a difference between god's
[1:48:06] permissive and his perfect will
[1:48:12] let me stop here for a moment
[1:48:14] because after years in the message
[1:48:43] let me tell you this now
[1:48:58] it is not god's perfect will
[1:49:02] in the message so long
[1:49:04] but why do we have
[1:49:06] prayer lines then
[1:49:09] we got to balance things because if not
[1:49:12] then we go
[1:49:37] wait a minute the bible says lay your
[1:49:38] hands upon the sick they shall recover
[1:50:01] well i'm not going to invite you no more
[1:50:03] to my church
[1:50:05] and this was well i don't care i'm not
[1:50:06] going to invite you for your time
[1:50:36] don't matter who it is but certain
[1:50:37] american brothers hermano americano
[1:50:40] we're preaching that was just speak the
[1:50:42] word
[1:50:43] that's the perfect faith
[1:50:45] i say amen to that because the word says
[1:50:50] the problem
[1:50:51] problem is is that not everybody has
[1:50:53] arrived to that level
[1:50:57] right amen here come a a a drug addict
[1:51:04] when he comes
[1:51:17] and they still won't believe the
[1:51:18] ministers
[1:51:21] we don't believe that
[1:51:23] no no because it wasn't them
[1:51:27] but the thing about it is this
[1:51:29] is that as he put his hands
[1:51:31] punished
[1:51:32] it was not
[1:51:47] [Applause]
[1:52:00] that are not at that level yet i think
[1:52:02] they cannot last anywhere but god
[1:52:04] tolerates that
[1:52:06] until that person gets to that level
[1:52:09] that's when they get to that level
[1:52:12] it's no more permissive will
[1:52:28] oh now we're finding a balance to all
[1:52:29] things
[1:52:31] watch what he says
[1:52:33] have god change your mind to his mind
[1:52:37] this is brother branham watching the
[1:52:39] children that message children of israel
[1:52:40] and then
[1:52:41] is
[1:53:08] because
[1:53:08] you're supposed to take my word
[1:53:37] but if you just speak the word
[1:53:52] why he was a gentile in that perfect
[1:53:54] faith
[1:53:56] but i'm going to come to the gentiles
[1:53:59] that when the gentile dispensation is
[1:54:01] over
[1:54:03] he'll turn and take the same faith
[1:54:22] okay all right
[1:54:24] now notice this now figure
[1:54:26] it's not about
[1:54:28] how much we
[1:54:30] forgive me but i'm going to be honest
[1:54:31] with you what i said you want god's
[1:54:32] perfect will
[1:54:34] to understand
[1:54:48] oh
[1:55:02] many times we come to the front
[1:55:05] and people will start to shake and move
[1:55:11] there's a time for that that's okay
[1:55:13] i have nothing against that you're not
[1:55:14] going to know all this can make one
[1:55:16] shout and one cry and the other one
[1:55:18] you know laughs
[1:55:22] speak in tongues one prophet
[1:55:26] praise god there's nothing wrong with it
[1:55:29] but the thing about it is that sometimes
[1:55:31] we come and we try to work ourselves up
[1:55:34] to it
[1:55:40] sorry sorry it's not come on
[1:55:43] and i have to keep saying come on
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:58] it's nothing
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:11] we're not seeing people do cartwheels
[1:56:13] and all of a sudden it wasn't a good
[1:56:14] service
[1:56:17] and we're like really
[1:56:19] maybe 30 40 years ago
[1:56:23] it's still there
[1:56:26] it's no excitement
[1:56:28] i noticed people coming through the line
[1:56:30] he says and just shaking themselves and
[1:56:31] oh god hallelujah amen glory to god
[1:56:39] don't do that noah
[1:56:55] hallelujah
[1:56:56] wait a minute he's not done yet if it is
[1:56:58] a narcissist you interfere with god
[1:57:05] come up but reverently
[1:57:21] wow
[1:57:22] every time the word comes forth
[1:57:25] it is doing a work in us
[1:57:28] we are blind to that this is
[1:57:31] looking for something to excite this guy
[1:57:33] namaste
[1:57:43] faith is something that's already in
[1:57:45] your heart
[1:57:47] you just come and believe it
[1:57:52] now there's nothing wrong after the
[1:57:53] lord's giving you and the blessings fall
[1:57:54] and you jump and shout oh yeah
[1:57:57] have a good time
[1:58:03] we're understanding the will of god
[1:58:17] he says
[1:58:18] show me a scripture where jesus ever
[1:58:20] jumped and shouted
[1:58:24] there's not one no no
[1:58:26] but i'll show you a bunch of scriptures
[1:58:28] that everybody jesus touched
[1:58:59] divine healing is not
[1:59:28] yes
[1:59:32] that's one of the great mysteries that
[1:59:34] the prophet came to unfold
[1:59:39] history of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:59:41] oh i got the baptism
[1:59:54] we know when it's moving
[2:00:10] even though
[2:00:22] there is no sensation
[2:00:38] we want god's permissive or perfect will
[2:00:40] perfect
[2:00:42] how many one is perfect
[2:00:44] i want his perfect will
[2:00:48] there's a perfect way
[2:00:51] and there's a permissive way
[2:00:54] and that's why paul would say
[2:00:58] a more excellent way
[2:01:04] how many want to know a more excellent
[2:01:06] ways
[2:01:47] god permitted israel to take the law
[2:01:52] when grace had already given them a
[2:01:54] prophet
[2:01:58] come on now
[2:01:59] grace already provided a prophet
[2:02:28] when we pray it's not god's perfect
[2:02:36] because that's what's in your heart
[2:02:40] no wonder david would say
[2:02:44] creating miami
[2:02:56] that's why jesus when they said teach us
[2:02:58] to pray
[2:03:12] i will be done
[2:03:21] [Applause]
[2:03:26] temptation
[2:03:54] go ahead
[2:04:22] the light of
[2:04:50] frequency is so tremendous
[2:04:53] there's things that you've heard before
[2:04:55] i'm not telling you nothing new
[2:04:58] but he'll grant you permission
[2:05:04] he
[2:05:26] okay brother aj tell us what you said
[2:05:28] about sometimes god cancels our plans or
[2:05:31] or or what did you say
[2:05:42] right that's what he said did you hear
[2:05:43] that
[2:05:44] sometimes god ruins our plans
[2:06:00] thank you brother aj
[2:06:03] when i look at this cuando esto
[2:06:07] as long as you live
[2:06:09] i'll never forget this
[2:06:12] god doesn't change his mind because
[2:06:13] there's no canvas amenti
