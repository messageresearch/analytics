[25:40] el rastro many of us get to see the
[25:42] inside of four walls of our home
[25:44] muchos de nos vemos Solomon Telus cuatro
[25:46] Perez de nuestra casa maybe if we're
[25:48] lucky a trip to Walmart to buy some
[25:50] groceries it gives us eternal most worth
[25:52] de viaje a Walmart but a comparable
[25:54] mandala and it's it's very similar to
[25:58] what John was experiencing its moist
[26:00] amulet a low key experiment Abba won and
[26:03] John starts off and he says welcome
[26:06] inside agenda I'm a brother and
[26:08] companion in tribulation so hermano y
[26:11] companion in the tribulation he
[26:14] identifies himself with all of the other
[26:16] people of that day that were being being
[26:19] tried in and and being beat up and and
[26:21] killed as the identity cover control of
[26:24] the mask antic estaban siendo probe
[26:25] ellos
[26:26] but gallows humor tonight allison aquel
[26:28] tiempo he said I'm your brother and your
[26:30] companion in the tribulation is that yo
[26:32] soy su hermano y company era in a
[26:34] tribulation but I find something so
[26:37] tremendous here in Connecticut on
[26:39] tremendo a key because John instead of
[26:41] focusing on the tribulation Juan and
[26:44] lugar de in focusing in the tribulation
[26:46] John says when this day even though I
[26:49] was in tribulation I don't get gusto in
[26:52] the tribulus year even though I was in
[26:54] isolation
[26:55] Uncas doing his lover even though they
[26:58] boiled me in a in a vat of oil don't get
[27:01] Mary beard on and
[27:03] Moya granted their say TR the end oh you
[27:06] see the reason they sent John to the
[27:08] Isle of Patmos where a song can be or
[27:10] not want Elijah the Patmos was because
[27:12] when they boiled him in the oil from the
[27:14] letter B Aaron SAT Caliente he didn't
[27:17] burn and who knows that came off so they
[27:19] accused him of witchcraft
[27:21] Hales lactose around Esterbrook or w la
[27:23] Brujeria they said you gotta be the
[27:25] devil himself it's a technical said in
[27:26] Diablo mismo so go to the island of
[27:28] Patmos where you can't possess anybody
[27:30] else with the problems induced and no
[27:32] purpose or not nadie NOS they said he he
[27:36] cast a spell on the oil they say el
[27:39] Pasto Pomona Madison sobre el aceite
[27:42] para que no la cámara but John's sitting
[27:44] here on the Isle of Patmos they don't
[27:46] want Santa lo que ayuda de Patmos John
[27:49] begins to to do something one commencer
[27:53] acid a logo and he begins to do
[27:55] something that is the key
[27:57] el camino hacer algo que es el agave or
[28:00] elk larvae to a Christian life to the
[28:04] Christian walk Allah Allah Allah Vida
[28:07] Kristiana and as miserable as John's
[28:10] circumstances were it's a miserable
[28:12] chimera no circumstances at one John
[28:15] begins to meditate one commence a MIDI
[28:19] Dart
[28:19] and he begins to focus on the things of
[28:23] the Lord it commenced in focus the
[28:25] endless poses in sanur when all of the
[28:27] sudden wonder they repented John finds
[28:31] himself once in Quintessa mismo
[28:34] in a place maybe he had never been
[28:36] before and in Liberec under hamas a via
[28:38] estado and he found himself else in
[28:41] control in the spirit analyst pity too
[28:45] on the lord's day in el dia del signore
[28:48] you see John began to meditate and
[28:51] throne says one commence Rama DDoS and
[28:53] maybe he began to have his own little
[28:55] revival there on Padma he's a published
[28:57] author is to appropriately memento
[28:59] pequeña Annihilator but but maybe all
[29:01] the sudden as he was meditating he meant
[29:03] estate repented como el estaba medicine
[29:05] though maybe the wind began to blow his
[29:07] rail viento comments also plan and maybe
[29:10] the rocks began to shake because our as
[29:12] Paris comments are an extremist and
[29:14] before you
[29:15] at this place opened up to John he antes
[29:18] que usted no puede ver este lugar CRE oh
[29:21] uh Juan and he found himself in the
[29:23] presence of Almighty God is in control
[29:26] entonces and representative es todo put
[29:28] it also and he began to look around el
[29:31] common saw me that I really Lord and
[29:32] before you know it he wasn't on Patmos
[29:35] anymore
[29:36] there are Pentagon Turkish the Paris

[29:46] operculum Contreras but he was
[29:48] surrounded in this place realist about

[29:53] times have I saluted me de muchos meses
[29:55] we as Christians nosotros como

[30:54] is one of the most vital parts of the
[30:57] Christian walk as rulers but this must
[30:59] be done as a community at Christiana
