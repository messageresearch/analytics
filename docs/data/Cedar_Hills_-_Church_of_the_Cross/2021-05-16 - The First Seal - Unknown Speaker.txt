========================================

and tonight we're starting on the sixth chapter of revelation now as we study at this chapter we're referring different places even to old and new testament alike because the entire book is the revelation of jesus christ that's all together the revelation of the lord jesus the revelation of jesus christ it's god revealing himself in the book revealing himself through christ in the book and christ is the revelation of god he come to reveal god because he and god were the same god was in christ reconciling the world to himself you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world amen this book the bible was really written before the foundation of the world and christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the lamb's book of life before the foundational world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it what a great thing and there about 12 o'clock in the date the holy spirit just swept right down into the room and the whole thing is opened up to me so of this of this first seal being over i'm as positive as i'm standing here tonight as this is the gospel truth that i am now we find the lamb with the book now and now in the sixth chapter we read and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of a thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw him behold a white horse and he set on him had a bull and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer but it isn't this kind of a book it's a scroll and then when the scroll is unwound that's one that land right in the scroll is number two and right here says what it is but it's a mystery so a revelation is something that's made known of something something that's been revealed and now notice so you won't forget it it is closed up until the latter time the whole mystery of it is closed up until the latter times we find that in the scripture here now the mystery of the book are revealed when the seals are broken and when the seals completely are broken the time of redemption is over because the land left the intercession boat to walk out to take his claim he was a mediator between that but when the real revelation happens on the seals as they begin to break the lamb is coming forth from the sanctuary now he said there is a white horse rider but what the mystery of it is there's a mystery that goes with that rider now what it was they didn't know but it's to be revealed and i saw when the lamb opened one of the sea wonder what their thunder was saint john 12 chapters and just hoarded saint john the 12th chancellor was thunder remember a loud laughing noise of asunder is the voice of god the first seal when it was opened in the symbol form is thundered now what about my openness reality bomb as soon as the lamb cut back the seal and what did it reveal not all of itself burst it to the god yes that's it assembled then it's revealed three things and only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken the who not the christ but in the church oh my that just makes me tremble i wanna thunderclap go down john my jumped up in the air on a thunder roar and then one of the four beasts said now come and see what it is what's reveal beneath here [Music] john wright what you see so john goes to see what it was john goes to see what the thunder said it's then that this creature told john hum and see what the mystery is under the first seal the thunder the voice of the creator has uttered it now what does this white horse mean and he that set on him had a bowl and a crown was given him he didn't have it then unto him and he went forth conquering at the conqueror now what does a white horse mean now here's where the revelation comes but my revelation by the holy spirit is not that way my revelation by the holy spirit is christ and the holy spirit is the self-sane only person a different form so here stands christ the lamb we know he was the lamb he's standing here at the books his hand and there towards the white horse rider so it wasn't the holy spirit and so how could christ be out there the white horse conquering and standing here with a book in his hand it isn't though it isn't christ notice now the holy spirit in the revelation and christ is the holy spirit is christ in another form right notice it is the lamb that opens the books and the lamb is christ and christ is not seen anymore from that but he is seen in the book of revelations the 19th chapter coming on a white horse and he that set on him was called faithful true righteousness does he judge and make walk his eyes were flames of bob and all his head was many crown look at him died him and he had a name written that no man knows but himself i noticed no man nobody said and he was clothed with the bastard dipped in blood and his name was called the word of god notice and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he tread the winepress of the fiercest the wrath of almighty god and he had on his gestures and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords there comes the messiah there he is nothing still on this horse back here notice the rider on the white horse don't have any name you might use two of three titles but he hasn't got any name but christ has a name what is it the word of god in the beginning was the word the word is with god and the word was god the word made flesh the writer has no name but christ is called the word of god who is this mysterious writer of the first church agent you only tell you who he is he's the antichrist exactly what he is now because you see if an antichrist jesus said that the two would be so close together and so it would deceive the very elected the bride antichrist it's the antichrist spirit glory amen notice i am in this holy spirit that we have becomes incarnate to us the one that's in our midst now the form of the holy ghost becomes incarnate to us in the person of jesus christ what are we saying who is this rider this horse rider you know what it is it's satan's super educated this is a satan superman with education with wisdom with church theology of his own word of his own nation and he rides his white denominational horse to deceive the people and the antichrist takes it all and the bible says that he deceived paul ain't allowed all upon the base of the earth whose names were upright [Music] now notice he'll conquer and almost happen in his script right now while he's still antichrist before he can become peace there'll be one thing you can conquer those that's got their names written in the land book of life from the foundation of the world i notice and the same time this is going on just before this takes place rather on the earth god has promised while all that scruples of denominations argue their difference about their creed god promised that he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to return to the original word of god and the faith of the fathers to bring down the power of the holy ghost amongst the people with a power that will razor above these things and take her in don't forget it friends don't forget it take it home with you stay with us hold it on your pillar don't forget it stay with us
