left thinking we're going to heaven in some documents and there will be a million miles away from its are only on the me as the left and through this message we find out yet revisited a second or something you cannot restore something stay no playlist unless it is first redeemed and menos que primero cell ready middle yes or yes Theo see he said I will restore the year she says your Estela de los años but I cannot see how he can restore the years pero no puedo ver como estan los angelos redeemed the time Atika primero I got ready middle Jim I want you to I'm going to say it again because I

restoration before redemption crystal cement is already feels like putting the cart before the horse Eskimo poniendo Loretta everybody waiting by you how can then he restore the years so for our restaurant lasagna unless once again that he redeems the time and Venice can redeem we're ready meters temple Colossians the fourth chapter you can have your Bibles and ready to to to to turn to them Galit are capital of Quattro Colossians so consensus Colossians 4 verse 5 when traversing it tells us walk in wisdom and thumb doing sorry to hear no word them that are without paralysis Perico knows extraneous redeeming the time the Nando lo Cascio well that is that big yes to tell us how we have to start redeeming the time it's an awesome piece Isis como se ready minute number one you cannot be sitting down uno no play the steps instead of walk is an action and then though is that when it says walk not just to walk no solo a nun you got a walk in wisdom there and I'm doing that we do here and you have to then walk toward those that are outside of the body and on toshiaki okay Consuela el cuerpo and when you do that then you can begin to redeem the time one question so pueden pasar admitted him but the phrase redeeming the time the press a ready minute it probably means to buy up the opportunity that is in front of you is a request low gratis kill opportunity a custom printed got that I'm going to say it again so you get it no we are let is you redeem the time ready ministry means that you are buying up the opportunity that is presentation comprendo Allah granted a

condición Azul ready medium company here once again have buying power to tienen poder de comprar you gotta have have the ability to buy something unique availability play compare very were redeemed up

nail I put the self where comprar now now listen to this now oh you guys dough to redeem me that you have purchased something that immediately second brother why you can't purchase without having the power to buy it you know no compression no tiene el poder para ser now now the question would be asked this morning la pregunta es esta do you have funds given Stefan those who buy every opportunity that is in front of you but up where comprar KO / - nyalam frente I'm totally bringing this to another angle right now to tie into otro Angulo de a day goes by but Sandia and I wish that we could really understand how many opportunities that are presented to us you see the puente de Valence of course mas que son presented by all of us to redeem the time now you may say can redeem um and when you see somebody you can spare the idea that doesn't know the Lord okay no canossian sinner because what one's lost I can be run into them with a nose ring and your conversation is to convince us you know always about what what's going on in the world so look at the bottom in the sports world in el mundo a deport what's happening in the hunting world and al mundo a like I said there's always our conversation it supposed to point us to a company however the question is related with that is you redeem the time or the opportunity that was in front of you reduces your focus on imprinted you stated you having a buying power and yes they were some people there para aprender and look at someone that's lawful absolutely I'll get me right in their soul that needs saving not making intercession rather and purchase that soul you compare this Alma you say brother Jesus did that and wonder if it is su sitio hate the price of redemption but what but now there has to be a price paid at all I will press your kappa nah make that redemption to the lost your letter several additional loss perdido they are with me one source is that there are so many opportunities that presented day in and day out I tend to support Anelka to present and the idea and I'm wondering how many checks that we write bounced equal to the logic is case que vemos that because there's not enough funds to take or to purchase that opportunity can i us enters one those particles chicken how many wonder what what want to purchase or buy or redeem the time Ponte skinny pants are already minute we always look at it at ourselves so simple miramos come on over little do we realize that we have the buying power or not endemic attend another one Jesus did on Calvary okay so seasonal come again what's the power to buy your prayer para comprar and seek that which was long it was kind of kick it up and you bring those people those souls to the feet of Christ it's a recess all muscle experience in your sin my question is how many souls have you won for Christ means three would say if one tells elements like another how many people have you brought to cry once again to separate or creeps all week might even bring a lot of people to church is that them which I hastily list but have we brought them to Christ cetera semifreddo a threesome I want this to sink in this morning get okay still a cicada eaten here you have the funds to buy the opportunities given you every day here is Telos one dose para compiler support to Nanette and you always hear people say he told them for him I was

time or the lemon is a resilient or simple is everything that is associated or connected with time esta noche esta so CLO iconic a lacuna tiempo even this time body that we live in honest acquit for

dedicate the merit our because our minds are always somewhere else working with cement - siempre is that liquor and it's so hard to redeem the time in that condition if we do all the immediate p.m. points redeeming the time because the days are evil sentimental tiempo perkiness yes woman wherefore be not unwise for tanto Macias imprudent but understanding what the will of the Lord is seen attendee knows the local level in tiles in your the word redeem la palabra venir when you take it to the Greek ontology my alkie echo exactly exact arezzo ik Segura eggs agarrado mr.

saliendo de algo and Alvarado meaning to purchase agora so quick receipt comprendo it is to purchase something out of eskimo compare algo is a college as slavery model ask Larry to to purchase someone out of slavery they comprehend la escalera to to pay the price to take them out of their present condition pagano's Preciosa Carlos de su condición presente and eggs a garage o e^x Agora so appears four times in the Bible parisa cuatro veces Univision we've looked at two which is divisions five in Colossians 4 miramos adores n officios Ecola census but it also says in Galatians 3 written in Louisa Engel attract Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law a Christian a cellular medicine delay in Galatians 4 eagle at us Quattro that he might redeem those who were under the law but academia chaos Catalan bajo la ley to redeem the time then and Pontius Pilate ready minute p.m. for time the word time in Greek is Kairos la palabra tiempo in Diego is title but that word is in about hours and minutes and seconds finis empanada no secretary orders minutos is no reason about watches or calendars need a calendar voz de los Kairos is not about a specific measurement of time I don't know as the one Malo specifically parameter that p.m. Kairos carries with it the idea of the right time Kyocera laser a tiempo correcto it is the idea of a predetermined time it is appropriate better me now there's a more an opportune time or they came for the important it is the appointed time isn't important at a proper time can fulfill the slice of time not the challah tiem where you have an opportunity hondo genuine opportunity no different even in this in church today no I difference in iglesia many of you are here which is the specialist and again each one is given an opportunity till is an opportunity healing scene it's the other analogy is here now Fortuna is tacky yes sir yes see you if you need salvation Tina speak Italian it's the right opportunity for you to receive salvation and opportunity for a Turkish to receive a that's not this timing is okay so case is this an opportune time assume temple a oportunidad that has been a opportunity for you and i but a me first and you receive something rather severe ali gonna watch as this unfolds visa como se Davila but Kairos pero casual time case Ian can eventually slip away every tormentas abuela is Lisa if today you hear his voice the Bible says joy oh yes it's what on heart of your heart not to discuss what is an opportunity as an opportunity when you hear his voice and always who wants to receive something from him but I receive it I'll go at that time you will not always have Paris example not those important hey you are hearing his voice for you who say all you suppose it's up to you to take advantage of the time someone says the logarithm thing the time every minute Liam but if not Pharaohs you know the opportunity is not always going to be opportunity I'm not told tiempos represent out the Roman poet Horace and for L put a poet ar Rahman Oh Horace or ass was quoted as using the phrase carpe diem where and enter see la palabra carpe diem everybody knows what that is right oh sorry kick it if everybody can somebody tell me what that means it's Latin for what to seize the day it sits right in opera for a challenge and it seems like it would all be the same if política toes as he was but Paul is not talking about just seizing the day or seizing the time the moment para parar mr. numbers are approaching p.m. because to see something por que para approach Analia we take a hold of it of it forcibly is it tomorrow I'll go forth versus it is to take control of it is a tomar control such as even a piece of rock demote ambien una una propiedad you can seize control of it with the preparation approved and does not mean that you have possession or legal rights to an okay ticket in a position or duration Denali and this is where what Paul said was totally different ya que su cara cara cara
