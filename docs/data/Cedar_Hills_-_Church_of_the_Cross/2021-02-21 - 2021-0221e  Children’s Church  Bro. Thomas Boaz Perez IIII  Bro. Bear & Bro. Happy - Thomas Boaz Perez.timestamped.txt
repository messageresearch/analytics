[21:19] thinking like getting a puppy I asked my
[21:22] mom and my dad and they said no
[21:26] no I started to play and they said yes
[21:30] next and this one my first miracle
[21:34] started and the second miracle was that
[21:36] once my parents were in accordance to
[21:38] getting our puppy we went everywhere any
[21:42] shops that were pet related be sure that
[21:45] we were there we went to PCO we went
[21:49] everywhere and well we found nothing
[21:52] that we felt was
[21:54] good so we prayed and there is no Co
[21:59] that 3 days after we prayed he was
[22:03] born and well time went on and my mom
[22:07] sent a text message to Sister Marissa

[22:37] and I believe that do dog was made from
[22:40] the beginning of the Earth for us God
[22:43] made that dog for us and I'm so grateful
[22:46] that the Lord would think so highly of
[22:49] us to give us such a wonderful gifts and
[22:52] I just can't explain how good is his
[22:55] mercy and whenever the dog was coming we
[22:58] prayed and we prayed and we prayed that
[23:01] he would have a good spirit a good
[23:03] nature and whenever he came he started

[26:57] [Music]
[27:24] how many are happy to be here
[27:30] let's turn our scripture to First John
[27:48] 5:14 and this is the confidence that we
[27:52] have in him that if we ask anything
[27:55] according to his will he heareth us
[27:59] God bless the reading of his word you
[28:00] may be
[28:04] seated this last year I got to go
[28:07] hunting it was really tough we tried
[28:10] really hard but we couldn't do it on our
[28:12] own but every morning we pray and I knew
[28:15] that God would hear my prayer
[28:18] amen and on Thanksgiving Day my dad gets
[28:21] a call from one of his customers he says
[28:24] I found a buck for your son we drive to
[28:27] this spot
[28:28] may show you the picture please
[28:43] guys and that's the proof that God heard
[28:46] my
[28:47] prayer I shot the buck my confident
[28:49] against God was through the roof but I
[28:51] wanted him more in my life than just
[28:54] hunting that's
[28:56] right and I wanted him to be just as
[28:59] conf confident in me as I am in
[29:02] him let's turn to Matthew
[29:23] 7:7 ask and it shall be given you seek
[29:27] and you shall find knock and it shall be
[29:30] open unto you amen I wanted him wanted
[29:34] more to be open to
[29:36] me but in order to do that I had to give
[29:40] him my heart I felt like Psalms
[29:45] 42:1 As the deer panteth after the water
[29:49] bricks so my soul longth after thee oh
[29:53] God I felt like the deer I was thirsty
[29:57] for God I wanted more from him so at the
[30:00] end of last year I decided to give him
[30:04] my heart and this year I got
[30:16] baptized I felt
[30:21] wait he found me and I found him God
[30:24] bless you
[30:36] the Lord

[36:05] Babylon so he asked Daniel along with
[36:08] two other men to help
[36:10] him the king preferred Daniel over
[36:14] everybody
[36:16] else in the Kingdom because he was
[36:18] honest and upright every morning Daniel
[36:21] would open his windows towards Jerusalem
[36:24] get on his knees and pray not once not
[36:29] twice but three times a

[36:58] big cheese around
[37:00] here everyone knows that I should be the
[37:04] king's right-hand man not
[37:07] Daniel oh please only thing you're good
[37:11] for is cutting the
[37:14] cheese look if we want to get rid of
[37:17] Daniel we're going to have to attack his
[37:20] very belief in
[37:22] God we're going to make a decree yeah
[37:26] for the next 30 days oh no man can pray
[37:30] to anyone no God no man besides King
[37:36] dararius perfect and if they do they're
[37:40] going to be captured and thrown into a
[37:43] Den of
[37:47] Lions I like
[37:49] Ito then we can have King Darius sign
[37:53] the decree and as soon as we catch that
[37:56] little holy roll ER Daniel oh yeah
[37:59] praying to his God it's game over Daniel
[38:03] game over Daniel like Sunday night when
[38:06] it's time to go back to school game over
[38:09] oh
[38:15] yeah that day all the presidents princes
[38:19] counselors Governors and captains got
[38:22] together and presented the decree to
[38:24] King
[38:25] Darius King Darius
[38:28] you know I was thinking you were
[38:31] thinking that's
[38:33] dangerous anyways we were thinking yeah

[38:38] like me we were thinking that can't even
[38:42] talk shut up let me speak you can't say
[38:45] that word that's a bad word anyways any
[38:48] this morning all right all
[38:50] right anyways some people's kids anyways
[38:55] if I get a chance to speak I'm going to
[38:57] get get rid of you
[38:58] soon wow we were thinking that you
[39:01] should make a new rule that says nobody
[39:05] can pray to any God yeah or any man
[39:09] besides you just for 30 days and if they
[39:13] do they'll be thrown into the lion's den
[39:16] oh yeah perfect perfect when Daniel
[39:20] heard that the law was passed he ran
[39:22] home and began to pray Daniel was not
[39:25] going to let anything get between him
[39:28] and his
[39:31] god
[39:32] wow I don't know why my friend Darius
[39:35] would make such a decree he knows I

[42:15] dangerous that's great so what if we get
[42:19] a couple of vicious hungry lions from
[42:23] the audience yeah yeah I like that idea
[42:27] and maybe they'll come up and they'll
[42:29] roar like a lion and show just how those
[42:33] Lions tried to scare Daniel perfect
[42:36] perfect and then we'll be called the bad
[42:39] boys of Babylon bad boys of Babylon bad
[42:42] boys of
[42:45] Bon all
[42:46] right where's our lion
[42:50] keeper it's my get the vious ones the
[42:54] hungry on hungriest
[42:58] did we fire him where's he at maybe they
[43:01] ate him
[43:02] too he must be pretty vicious maybe they
[43:05] ate each other and then ate
[43:08] themselves then our plan is failed uhoh
[43:11] then they might eat us oh
[43:20] man whoa that is SC wait that was pretty
[43:23] weak man that was a pretty full- grown
[43:26] kitten if you ask me yeah you ask for
[43:29] Hungry Lions not

[44:54] keepers at where's the keepers man
[44:58] they're fired they're
[45:01] done you better get out of here
[45:04] man let's
[45:13] go King Darius was extremely
[45:16] disappointed with himself he did all
[45:19] that he could to save Daniel but it was
[45:21] too late Daniel found himself in the
[45:25] darkest place of his life
[45:27] and surrounded by hungry Lions but
[45:30] Daniel chose to have faith in
[45:36] God dear God you are so mighty and
[45:42] Powerful I know I'm in this Den of Lions
[45:44] for your honor and your
[45:46] glory I know that your angel is here I
[45:50] will fear no
[45:52] lion you will shut their mouths show
[45:55] your power oh Lord
[45:57] and show these people that you are the
[46:00] one true Living
[46:09] God hidden power that was in
[46:13] Daniel it came out and it'll come out
[46:17] when you have need of
[46:18] it and what did the hidden power
[46:22] do clothe him completely
[46:28] all they saw was
[46:30] fire and all they did was say oh they're
[46:32] afraid of
[46:35] fire pretty good H where's those lions
[46:38] at you believe that or
[46:41] not
[46:47] Glory that night King Darius was enabled
[46:50] to sleep worried for
[46:53] Daniel that morning the king went
[46:55] straight to the den to see if God had
[46:58] protected
[46:59] Daniel Daniel bro Daniel servant of the
[47:03] Living God was your God able to save you
[47:08] oh King live
[47:11] forever my God sent his
[47:14] Angel he shut the mouths of the
[47:17] Lions I don't even have a scratch on
[47:20] me praise the god of
[47:24] Daniel take him out of that Dan and
[47:26] clean up now clean him up what do you
[47:30] mean he's still alive oh man we're in
[47:35] trouble as for you too I will have you
[47:39] and your family thrown into the Dan that
[47:40] you Tred to kill Daniel with no wait we
[47:43] can explain that's not what it looks
[47:45] like like that really I make a decree
[47:50] that in every part of my kingdom men
[47:53] will tremble and fear the god of Daniel
[47:56] for he is the the Living God he has
[47:58] rescued Daniel from the power of the
[48:04] lions king Darius was so pleased with
[48:07] the god of Daniel that he made a decree
[48:09] that all men would know that the god of
[48:12] Daniel was the one true God because of
[48:15] Daniel's decision to stand for the Lord
[48:17] he prospered under the reign of Darius
[48:20] and Cyrus the Persian the end
[48:24] [Applause]
[48:40] so I've got an idea what's
[48:45] that I've got an
[48:48] idea can you hear

[49:05] could just take it easy that's my dam
[49:09] yeah let's go bro oh
[49:15] yeah the king told Daniel not to pray to
[49:18] his God
[49:20] anymore I'll lock you in the L stand and
[49:24] throw away the keys to the door the very
[49:27] next day found Daniel down on his Bend
[49:30] and knees the difference is time he open
[49:33] the blind so the whole wide world can
