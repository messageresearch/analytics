favorite hymn the song down from his glory was W was written by William BL uh Booth cliborne who was born on August 3rd of 1893 and passed away of August 27th 1969 now in 1908 at the ripe age of 15 years old his father took him to a growing group of Pentecostals holding meetings in London England the family had roots in the UK so he was able to persuade his son William to join him on the trip to the Revival arriving at the meetings both the father and the son were immediately attracted to what they were both seeing and hearing now it was there that they heard people speaking in [Music] tongues arriving at the meetings both Arthur the father and William the [Music] son were immediately attracted to what they were hearing and seeing for it was there that they first heard people speaking in tongues Arthur spoke eight languages Arthur and William already spoke five at the age of 15 [Music] Willi but none of the languages that were being spoken that day were recognizable by either of them and on one of those nights in the continuous meetings William went to the Altar and there something happened and in his own words he said I found myself singing in a beautiful language entirely [Music] foreign its charm and surprising sounds saturated me with an Indescribable [Music] easy every sweet sentence fully and adequate adequately expressed the pent up feelings of my inflamed heart direct from the altar of my heart rising and surging burning Billows the most pleasing pleasing incense was reaching the throne a few years later in 1921 William was 28 years old and had held a successful Tent Revival meeting south of Sacramento in a town called Loi California enthused by the results he decided he'd have more tent meetings a little more south in a place called Holtville [Music] in Holtville unfortunately heavy rains and low attendant literally quenched his Services being unable to pay for the cost of the field meetings William and his helpers found themselves working in a cornfield harvesting it to help settle their unpaid debts and it was there that he hit rock bottom but it was in the middle of those corn fields overtaken with self-pity the Lord began to deal with him and little did he know that the spirit of God would give him the words to one of the greatest hymns ever written a prophet our prophet in the message what think he of Christ preached in 1954 he says as you stand to your feet if you only knew the backgrounds for that song my friend composed that song boo cbor boo cbor in a cornfield one night with his elbows and on his knees out there in prayer God gave him this song I think it's one of the it's matchless for this day when the deity of Jesus Christ is denied by so many formal Believers that he was no more a man

special place in my heart and it was uh one of my Grandma's favorite songs Victory in Jesus vict J amen it was written by Eugene M Bartlet Eugene M Bartlet amen it's and as I began to read on the author he began his career as a publisher and later formed the Hartford Music Company in 1918 he wrote songs such as everybody will be happy over there and just a little while he felt his calling to write hymns and to teach site reading he he would hold singing schools and uh singing conventions at the age of 53 he suffered a massive stroke that left him unable to speak and unable to walk many throughout many thought his ministry was over but in those times in those dark times that the Lord took him through he took him back to a time when he was born again and rich in life he begins to write this hymn realizing that the love of [Music] God had brought him to where he was at that moment as he wrote the last verse he says he could see the story of redeeming power from start to finish he would go on to complete it with the melody of happiness and enthusiasm I never had the opportunity to ask my grandmother why this song was so special to her but as I begin to to read this story the life of this author and began to see the life of my my grandma I understood that uh no matter what we're going through in life there's Victory in Jesus let's all stand and let's let's sing that song
