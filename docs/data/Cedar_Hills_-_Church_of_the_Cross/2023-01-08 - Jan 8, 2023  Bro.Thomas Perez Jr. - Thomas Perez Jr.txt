world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but it's of the world and the world passes away and the lust thereof is but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever Lord Jesus we're very happy to be in your house tonight that you've called us to this

Josh give us the video or the sound or whatever it is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you gracias now the prophet of God says this is when he's talking about Matthew 28 19. he talks about it and tells us it's not a three persons three manifestations of that same God don't tell us and he says that's enough to hit the devil in the ribs every day and make him squeal like a pig I'm going to tell you again by you being here tonight made the devil squeal like a pig it's time that somebody else should be afraid I ain't afraid no more if there's anybody that should be afraid it's the devil what we did this morning you magnify and glorify God enough to hit the devil in the ribs every day now hold on this is all in in what we've understood about the word of God this is the day that I died this is a good day to die don't don't wait don't don't wait for me no we won't we won't stay very long for me I want you to already get what you got this morning with you right now why did you received this morning is what we need to make it to the other other side I was wondering if there's somebody here this morning this evening it's the Saturday that's tired of the devil pushing them around that the devil is afraid tonight because greater is he that is these are the things that if any men love the world of love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life but it is of the world and the world passes away and the lust thereof is their sales but he that doeth of the will of God forever I love the parents this morning I took God in his words look their children with them and brought them through the prayers it is time that somebody else be afraid this is the Commendation this is to one of the churches is that they were beating Satan in his own Thrones and they only had half away foreign [Applause] [Applause] leave God in his words they asked me last night if I would give a testimony through what God has done today they were talking about blind Bartimaeus in the Sunday school class and that happened 2 000 years ago they were talking about brother bran I'm about 70 50 years ago but I brought them to today in 1999. when the the service was just about over and when the service was just about over they brought a little girl that was blind when they brought this little girl that was blind foreign for the devil to be afraid I was looking in there as as I I saw the little girl with her eyes open we were alive to 16 countries and the announcer was looking he was announcing the next service eyes locked into the eyes of the little girls I remember brother Fabio Bernal cross the the running across the stage and he took the microphone he said I want you to know that God just opened up the eyes who else was there Michael and the world that God created we say we say oh God wants he wants to destroy this world God don't want to destroy this world he created this world you can go out and see the trees you see the mountains you see the organs where the angel of the Lord lives you say how brother the angel of the Lord lives there the other day he waved at me as I passed by you bro you say brother how can that be I just believe God's words beyond the word of God is the truth for to my generation but it cost us questions not a sacrifice it cost us death no What a Wonderful World God has created he's not coming to today immorality that happens upon the Earth because he loves the God he loves the world the Bible speaks to us God so loved the world but man decided they knew what love was when you go and smoke a cigarette that's not God's love because when you go and drink Thomas alcohol that's not God's love when you go with the woman that's not your wife when you do things that are against the word of God that's not the love of God Mundo but there was no place found for him [Applause] that looked like the like this man bro I have my way to go in and when it came to to this man he couldn't he couldn't touch at him but he entered into the serpenter Lucifer enters into the Surplus and when he enters into the circle says now I've got him trapped how did he do it traps the the devil Diablo in this in this man that was a serpenter that looked like a man yeah but without no soul can you imagine when God comes he pronounces judgment upon the serpenter and he says this it is he says now that serpent will bruise your heels but you'll bruise can you reach him Adam said I can't reach it is okay I'm gonna let you reach him on thy belly serpenter drag yourself imagine the crunching of the bones can you imagine the serpent coming and making and and the crunching of the bones and the veins and the muscles yes see [Music] what did Adam do okay he portrayed the part of Christ of what in the future Generations himself would do for us and he crushes his head all through these sacrifices of bringing whatever they wanted to bring to the house after a while it didn't matter if the if the heifer or the turtle doves were were did not have no stains on them sacrifice it was just to appease God knew that that couldn't work for all times people so when they cut the lamb and they killed the Lambs Adam and Eve in the skins and those skins would hit their legs yes that in the future it would also come alive he was not going to just give us an angel he was going to come himself in flesh was gonna die for Humanity we look into the times of Moses and all of a sudden the people started talking against Moses fiery serpents started biting people then what did they do they were dying but all of a sudden they repented Moses the Lord told Moses make you a serpent and wrap it around a pole as the universe brass signified sin already trapped him again but let me tell you the greatest the greatest place the devil says I got you and Jesus he Jesus in the garden brother Branham says died more there than he did on Calvin Harris that came down he died of a broken heart completely ruptured but he knew that unless that seed or forget and he would hold it it was not his sin it was our sins there's a there's a story just in a few more minutes there's a story I only study of a man that saw this man cry coming up the hill and as he sees him he sees him with a big old bag as he gets closer he finds out that it's the Lord Jesus and he says he's saying Lord Jesus are you carrying the sins of the whole world he says I'm just carrying yours he took upon our sins he said let that be bite me where they are me once and for all to settled the sin questions the day I died because I died in him every day I died in here went to Calvary I died man Paul says died with him and when I died that was the greatest day of my life I shall be your death no more can sin govern me no more will it rain over me I am an adopted son of God and when I recognized him he looks at me and he says you see that serpent right there is he low enough all you have to do is he already did it on California I challenge you tonight finishing right now I challenge you tonight that whatever is bothering you look at the stumble is thunder whoever is holding you back look at the promises in the name of your Jesus crush your enemies he has nothing to do but to die love not the world it doesn't matter what television shows you name one important location to everybody in particular I'm not the world that's the day I died today is a good day to die yes tomorrow is a good day today no wonder the Apostle Paul would say foreign let it be against now that I die because when I ask you to stay something from God just if you need something from the Lord we're not going to stay very long tonight we just want to anyone that needs something from God here we are Manos yeah precious Lord Jesus news there's right where you're at I mean you need anything from him just stand up right and we'll be will be will be yes not gonna beg you know we we heard the word
