[52:54] those that are thirsty El problema the
[52:58] problem
[53:00] he said there's no one thirsty
[53:03] is that our thirsty
[53:07] the drink from is not important it
[53:10] doesn't matter the price
[53:12] you're talking about a price
[53:19] the price he's had to pay to stand
[53:24] to
[53:26] other places
[53:28] foreign
[54:11] amigo I ask is he your enemy
[54:15] he is
[54:20] healed and to destroy but
[54:22] sometimes we Act
[54:26] as if we have a covenant
[54:30] or some sort of association with him
[54:35] if someone in the natural
[54:39] breaks into our home
[54:44] if your arm you'll take your arm out and
[54:46] you'll defend
[54:48] but Satan comes he gets us sick
[54:52] he takes her children
[54:56] takes her wives
[54:58] takes here and there
[55:01] we act as if it didn't matter
[55:11] to destroy he's our enemy
[55:14] I said Lord I want to drink from your
[55:16] cup
[55:17] you have to pay a price
[55:20] glory to God
[55:22] whatever it is Lord
[56:05] the enemy's doing
[56:10] he is an enemy
[56:13] when I entered to pray
[56:17] the first thing I do I take the armor
[56:20] and I begin
[56:23] in the name of Jesus Christ
[56:28] all of your weapons
[56:30] I say Satan
[57:12] to heal
[57:14] the scriptures say
[57:18] look at look at this picture
[57:22] now I'll enter into the message
[57:26] is five minutes
[57:31] but I wanted you to get to this level
[57:35] you can now understand the scripture he
[57:38] say
[57:39] and Lucas capitulo
[58:32] and doctors of the law
[58:41] was there
[58:44] the scribes
[58:49] hearing the teachings about Jesus
[58:52] now the Bible says it was a teaching
[58:54] no I don't believe okay
[58:58] this teaching was
[59:01] for two hours
[59:07] for six hours
[59:10] because the Pharisees were there
[59:13] asking Jesus
[59:15] challenging questions
[59:21] Moses says this Jesus
[59:25] but the prophet say this is
[59:28] Moses also says this
[59:30] that's what they were doing
[59:35] in a teaching
[59:36] when the scriptures
[59:52] where they're listening
[59:56] what a waste of time
[1:00:00] and the power of God was there to heal
[1:00:02] them
[1:00:05] a four or five
[1:00:10] four four or five nobodies
[1:00:15] for five crazy young people
[1:00:21] that knew that Jesus
[1:00:29] they're seeing what Jesus had done
[1:00:33] they took their paralyzed
[1:00:36] and they were going to take him to his
[1:00:39] presence
