[17:23] [Music]
[17:56] [Music]
[18:06] god bless you our first I would like to
[18:11] thank my pastor for letting me be here
[18:13] today in this place so I could talk to
[18:17] you a little bit about the story of
[18:19] David and Goliath and so if you at all
[18:23] please turn into your scriptures First
[18:26] Samuel chapter 17 verse 36 and 37 when
[18:32] you have it can you please say Amen
[18:37] thy servants through both the lion and
[18:40] the bear and the uncircumcised
[18:43] philistine shall be as one of them
[18:45] seeing he has defied the armies of the
[18:48] Living God david says moreover the Lord
[18:52] that delivered me are the paw of the
[18:54] lion and out of the paw of the bear he
[18:57] will deliver me out of the hand of the
[18:59] hand of the Philistine and saw said unto
[19:02] David go and the Lord be with thee can
[19:07] you please bow your heads in a word of
[19:08] Prayer gracious Heavenly Father we come
[19:11] before you lured asking you Lord that
[19:13] you you put you bless us all to Daler
[19:17] and Lord please that I asked with that
[19:19] that this message will help someone
[19:23] mirth lord please a we love you learn in
[19:25] English Christ you pray amen you may be
[19:28] seated
[19:29] so when and at this time there was a
[19:36] battle between the Philistines and the
[19:38] Israelites and and on the Philistines
[19:41] they had a huge giant they had he his
[19:46] name was Goliath he had a helmet of
[19:51] brass
[19:52] he had a coat of mail he had armor that
[19:56] covered his entire body and he also had
[20:01] a huge spear and in the Bible it says
[20:04] that he was six cubed span and
[20:09] I'm assuming I'm assuming that that must
[20:12] be as tall as a bookshelf and so and he
[20:18] was always taunting at the Israelite
[20:22] saying that you guys are just little I
[20:25] can squash you like a bug or or just
[20:30] like taunting everybody like let's say
[20:32] in a game or something and so what he
[20:36] said he challenged the Israelites that
[20:39] you he wanted to fight someone and he
[20:42] who if he wins that he if the Israelite
[20:47] wins the Philistine shall beat their
[20:50] slaves
[20:51] but if Goliath wins that the Israelites
[20:55] have to be the Philistine slaves so on
[20:59] and the Israelites try they had these
[21:02] three men and they were all they were
[21:05] brothers and their father's name was
[21:08] Jesse and he had eight sons and David he
[21:13] was a youngest and so just to explain
[21:17] David he was a keeper of a sheep the
[21:22] Sheep and he would help his father in
[21:24] different places and so one day his home
[21:30] his father told him to go take his
[21:33] brother some food and David was very
[21:37] obedient he would listen to what his
[21:39] father would say and so when he told him
[21:44] that he gathered up his food and started
[21:46] heading to the camp and when he arrived
[21:49] at the camp he was wondering where his
[21:51] brothers were because he wanted to make
[21:53] sure they were okay and they would
[21:57] afraid David was pretty young so he was
[22:00] kind of nosy and so and so whenever he
[22:07] went to go find it he wanted to go find
[22:08] his brothers to just go make sure
[22:09] they're okay and so whenever he was
[22:12] looking for his brothers it was the
[22:16] first time he ever heard Goliath's voice
[22:18] and people were saying
[22:22] how have you guys heard of this man
[22:24] named Goliath he's been he's been
[22:27] whining to challenges and trying to beat
[22:30] us up and so David he he wasn't even a
[22:36] part of this war and he says I'll fight
[22:38] him and so everybody just starts looking
[22:42] at him and saying like what you're just
[22:45] a little kid what you're talking about
[22:47] and so when Saul he heard David and he
[22:53] he was saying like what makes you think
[22:56] you can defeat him they're just yeah you
[22:58] you can't you can't do you can't fight
[23:01] him
[23:01] and so David told him a story and he
[23:07] told him a story when he was with his
[23:11] his sheep and there was these two beasts
[23:14] the lion and a bear and they both
[23:17] attacked the Sheep and so whenever they
[23:22] attacked the Sheep but they took one of
[23:23] them and David went straight to the
[23:26] Beast and took him straight from their
[23:28] mouth and whenever the Beast they went
[23:32] to go attack him David just he was he
[23:36] had the grace of God protected him and
[23:39] he grabbed him by he grabbed him by
[23:42] their beard and slaughtered them meaning
[23:44] that he killed them and so and so Saul
[23:48] he he started to gain faith and David
[23:53] and so he says well by all means go
[23:58] ahead fight him and made the Lord be
[24:00] with thee and so so thought that David
[24:04] was just because he's small that he was
[24:08] just gonna be like basically just
[24:12] squashed and so uh saw him his best
[24:19] armor and he gave him a sword and David
[24:23] was looking at all like what are you
[24:27] trying to do to me I I can't fight like
[24:29] this
[24:30] I haven't proved it and so David just
[24:33] stripped away the armor
[24:35] and what he took instead was he took a
[24:38] slingshot five stones and his staff and
[24:42] so he just went like that to Goliath and
[24:46] Goliath took one look at him just he
[24:50] just started laughing at him and I'm a I
[24:54] can see he says I can squash you with my
[24:56] bare hands and David David says you come
[25:01] in armor and a spear but I come in the
[25:06] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so he
[25:11] took one of his stones and putting in
[25:13] his slingshot and threw it straight to
[25:16] his foot him in the middle of his
[25:17] forehead and the stones don't straighten
[25:20] into his head and Goliath fell - into
[25:25] the face of the earth and David he he
[25:30] didn't have a sword so he took a lie its
[25:32] own sword and sliced his head off and
[25:35] and the Israelites they they were young
[25:40] and victorious they they were yelling
[25:44] with joy and the Philistines they just
[25:46] ran us for their entire life so after
[25:54] telling you this story after giving you
[25:56] some knowledge I I want to relate how it
[26:00] can help us today in this world because
[26:03] a giant today is and this time it's like
[26:08] it can be a problem a situation a
[26:11] sickness anything and so and so I I
[26:17] can't I have a problem myself
[26:19] I like watching my tablet for too long
[26:24] but I'm pretty sure everybody I I'm
[26:29] pretty sure most of people might have a
[26:31] problem in the life in right now and so
[26:34] if you have the faith like David where
[26:37] you can believe that you can take down a
[26:39] giant then it shall be done in the name
[26:42] of Lord Jesus Christ
[26:46] I hope this I'll help you all and God
[26:49] bless you
[26:50] [Applause]
[27:17] [Music]
[27:39] I did see some warriors earlier where
[27:46] they are ah there's one right there
[27:51] what's your name stun Malachi you know
[27:54] who I am I am Joshua you're in the Bible

[28:17] are you doing great to me all of you god
[28:21] bless you brother
[28:22] gentlemen sisters how are you you doing
[28:28] okay don't be afraid I'm on your side
[28:36] well you see it's about that time it's
[28:42] about time to go into the land of
[28:44] promise we've been wandering this desert
[28:48] long enough you know like I said me and
[28:51] brother Caleb you know we went a while
[28:54] back in man we just wish we could have
[28:57] went right then but you know God has a
[29:01] purpose for everything but he's kept us
[29:04] around all these years 40 years we've
[29:07] been wandering the desert you know so
[29:10] sad to see Moses great servant of the
[29:13] Lord pass on to see the angels come and
[29:16] carry that man to a place to hide him
[29:20] away I was with that man every day I was
[29:24] his minister we've gone through a lot
[29:28] together in 40 years hearing people's
[29:31] murmurings and complainings hearing how
[29:34] much that they just didn't think God
[29:37] could do it but not me and brother Caleb
[29:41] we didn't believe that at all we know
[29:45] our God was able to do whatever he
[29:49] wanted to do through us
[29:51] we knew the promise that he didn't just
[29:54] give to us he gave to our
[29:56] great-great-great grandparents and told
[29:59] us about this land flowing with milk and
[30:02] honey
[30:02] while we are the generation that's here
[30:05] that's going to go take that promise now
[30:08] I'm looking for an army I can't go over
[30:11] there by myself so I need an army so I
[30:15] need a bunch of this new generation
[30:18] I need the generation of the true
[30:20] believers how many of you believe we can
[30:23] go conquer Canaan do you think we can do
[30:26] it we can do it right easy
[30:29] me and Kayla birdie went and saw some of
[30:31] those giants if they're just big that's
[30:34] it we can take them they're not that big
[30:36] guys I'm bigger than half of them and I
[30:39] eat way more than they do so we're it
[30:41] will be alright alright alright don't be
[30:44] scared Malachi we got this we're in the
[30:46] Bible okay so here we go and we know the
[30:53] story but I want to relate this for you
[30:56] a little bit closer because you see when
[31:00] God commissioned me to go over he said
[31:03] it's time to go take it you know it's
[31:05] not something easy that you feel on your
[31:07] shoulders it doesn't mean that we just
[31:10] run in there with our heads not on and
[31:12] just start going crazy waving our swords
[31:15] no we got to follow the very plan of God
[31:18] because if we don't a lot of you guys
[31:21] might be missing I don't want nobody
[31:24] missing over there I need all of you
[31:26] guys okay all right so here we go and
[31:30] God give him gives me the promise he
[31:34] said it's time to go over while Jordan
[31:37] the hard thing is Jordan is running at
[31:39] full force right now you know I saw the
[31:42] little rio grande outside hey while we
[31:46] would have done that one easy we would
[31:48] have just jumped across it and just been
[31:51] on our merry way
[31:52] that's not the way Jordan was Jordans
[31:56] River was rushing hard it was rushing
[31:59] fast the only way a person could get
[32:02] over there is if a man was superstore
[32:05] now I'm talking about really really
[32:08] strong maybe like brother mark brother
[32:12] mark I think could swing across maybe we
[32:15] find another man really strong could
[32:17] make it across so we're gonna send those
[32:20] two men to go spy out this land okay
[32:22] because the first city we have to take
[32:25] is Jericho now Jericho is one of the
[32:28] major cities of this land of Canaan the
[32:32] walls are high I want you to look up at
[32:34] the ceiling that's not high enough we
[32:38] could get some of those ladders out of
[32:39] but the back of brother been struck and
[32:41] climb right over they these walls are
[32:45] big I'm telling you high walls so high
[32:48] that you if you have the if you're
[32:51] scared of heights yeah you'll get scared
[32:53] you're gonna be able to climb that wall
[32:54] it's high okay the only way we're gonna
[32:58] take down these walls I still don't even
[33:02] know how well we're gonna home man
[33:05] some of my arm is falling off here hold
[33:08] on to that for me I might need that

[38:22] these armies that are squatting in our
[38:24] houses these people that are just being
[38:27] a bunch of squatters on our promises I
[38:30] know you're gonna give it to us Lord and
[38:32] as the story goes on
[38:35] he moves off to himself in the wood
[38:38] there and Canaan and all of a sudden
[38:42] he's by himself and he begins to hear
[38:45] footsteps
[39:07] [Music]

[39:26] strong and of good courage well - oh God

[39:57] scabbard
[39:58] that's the same captain of the Lord of
[40:01] Hosts that is going to be in our midst
[40:04] but I don't believe he's only gonna be
[40:07] in our midst
[40:08] I believe he's gonna be in this place to
[40:11] reign in your heart forever if you just
[40:14] let him into your life
[40:15] young young kids one day just let the
[40:18] Lord Jesus Christ come into your heart

[40:38] this is God's Word

[40:48] the battle plans to take out Jericho
[40:55] that's what we came here for boys now
[40:59] we're gonna get them this is what we're
[41:03] gonna do
[41:04] he just told me a secret we're gonna
[41:07] march around the walls of Jericho for
[41:10] the next seven days for the six of the
[41:13] days we're gonna march around one time
[41:16] but nobody is to make a battle cry
[41:20] nobody can make a sound can you guys
[41:25] keep a secret did you say nope
[41:30] oh you said yep okay I'll make you sure
[41:33] we got a little serious there for a
[41:35] little bit I little go crazy all right
[41:38] guys so first pert for six days they
[41:43] marched around the walls of Jericho not
[41:46] making a sound they followed the Ark of
[41:49] the Covenant and the whole time the king
[41:51] of Jericho was getting mad because it
[41:55] was warring on his mind
[41:57] you know the devil likes to mess with
[41:59] our minds a lot that's his battleground
[42:01] yeah but isn't it funny when we mess
[42:04] with him he gets mad
[42:07] so we started worrying on his mind and
[42:11] when the king of Jericho saws marching
[42:14] without making a sound no battle cry he
[42:17] said what manner of army is this they
[42:22] crossed a part of the seal they parted
[42:24] the Red Sea then they go and wander the
[42:27] desert for forty years and then they
[42:29] turn around and they break through the
[42:32] the waters of Jordan and then they make
[42:35] cakes where in the world did they get
[42:40] the frosting over here they make these
[42:45] cakes and now they're walking around my
[42:47] walls and they haven't made a sound that
[42:50] they want to fight what kind of warriors
[42:53] are these guys what kind of warriors are
[42:56] these ladies and he wondered and he
