[9:04] [Music]
[9:59] Rayo it's 11 and we took a trip to
[10:02] Pennsylvania so it was a long road trip
[10:04] as actually to my niece's wedding I
[10:07] believe I was with this and I was with
[10:09] my sister Sharon and my sister Ruth so
[10:13] it was just you know either in a car and
[10:15] traveling to Pennsylvania and back and
[10:17] so that was I mean Matthew had stayed
[10:21] home and it was just a quick weekend
[10:23] trip up there and so we were in the car
[10:27] a lot so she was in my life a lot and so
[10:29] you know I guess that's when I first
[10:33] noticed it it was hidden at first like
[10:35] it just was two spots on the side of her
[10:37] head that were about the size of a
[10:39] quarter like one on each side and it was
[10:44] just odd in fact when I first realized
[10:46] that she was laying in my lap it was
[10:47] sleeping and I was just you know playing
[10:50] with her hair and rubbing her head and
[10:54] she ran I was in the backseat my sister
[10:56] Sharon was in the front seat and when I
[11:01] first noticed it it just took my breath
[11:02] away because I just knew that something
[11:04] was serious but Sharon just looked at me
[11:11] and said it's gonna be okay
[11:12] it's okay um because I don't know you
[11:16] already as a mom you know that there's
[11:19] issues going on and you wish that you
[11:21] could do something for them but when
[11:23] something like that happens like you
[11:25] just know exactly how serious like you
[11:27] just know there's something big going on
[11:30] and sharing asleep I mean I'll just
[11:33] remember her looking at me in the
[11:34] rearview mirror and saying it's gonna be
[11:36] okay like I just cuz it just took my
[11:39] breath away so much when I first saw
[11:40] that okay so I don't know you don't lose
[11:44] your hair for just anything that's
[11:45] called me when when they were on the
[11:48] trip on my on her way home called man
[11:52] said you know it's kind of well kind of
[11:55] a panicked voice and you know just
[11:58] telling me that she found two spots on
[12:01] her hair on her head and it was you know
[12:06] I was like wow what's what's going on
[12:10] Mackey and I had talked about taking her
[12:14] to the doctor and so I took her which is
[12:19] what we usually do is you know he's up
[12:21] on everything but I'm usually Glen who
[12:23] takes him to the doctor um and so they
[12:27] just told us you know she just basically
[12:29] told us what it was and sent us to a
[12:32] dermatologist she was kind of nonchalant
[12:34] about it which was shocking to me
[12:36] because to us that hair is an important
[12:39] thing and she was just like you know I
[12:41] have a couple patients with this and
[12:42] they wear wigs but at that point it
[12:45] didn't sink in at all oh you know how
[12:48] far it would go or how much it would
[12:50] actually take her hair the doctor
[12:52] prescribed a steroid cream of some sort
[12:56] I couldn't even tell you what it was
[12:58] exactly but you're Puss opposed to put
[13:01] it on every day
[13:03] and we did for a while but it really did
[13:06] what's it doing anything and we actually
[13:08] never went back to the dermatologist at
[13:10] all because he had basically said that
[13:12] there was nothing that he could do for
[13:17] it besides that cream he could give you
[13:19] that but other than that he didn't
[13:21] prescribe or do anything else well that
[13:24] was um the beginning of March and
[13:28] Mariah's hair like even in June we had
[13:31] her our church putana family camp and
[13:33] even then like it the spots on both
[13:37] sides of her head were just getting
[13:38] bigger and you know we just put a
[13:41] headband on or something
[13:43] at that point it was just a small Lakes
[13:45] headband or just to kind of cover up
[13:47] spots because they just seemed to grow
[13:49] and so that was June and we you know we
[13:57] just we were just believing that god
[13:58] that's gonna heal her then and like ever
[14:01] since even from the beginning when we
[14:03] first found found it in the doctor had
[14:05] told us what it was he we just believe
[14:11] that God said he would heal and that was
[14:15] what our faith was in and but at that
[14:18] point even in June it was just spots
[14:21] were getting larger probably in July and
[14:25] August even they were just getting
[14:28] bigger spots and more spots started
[14:30] showing up and for the most part like
[14:33] people around us couldn't even see that
[14:36] it was going on really unless they you
[14:38] know would ask or we would talk about it
[14:40] or something you really couldn't see you
[14:42] know she just wore headbands all the
[14:43] time to cover up the spots that were
[14:47] just getting larger I'm thinking like
[14:52] even September October it probably
[14:55] started getting a whole lot worse like
[14:58] from that day it just you know another
[15:02] spot would show up and then another spot
[15:05] would show up and then those spots would
[15:07] get they would come together and then
[15:09] the whole part of the head you know this
[15:11] side of the head was was totally gone
[15:13] and so they had to bring the hair and
[15:16] wrap it around the head just to cover up
[15:19] and then put a band on top you know one
[15:23] day you know they were getting ready for
[15:25] Sunday morning and this is when it hit
[15:28] me
[15:29] just because they were being there in
[15:33] the bathroom just in front of the mirror
[15:36] trying to do this do that pull this hair
[15:38] over that no that didn't work we got to
[15:41] do something different something we got
[15:42] to pull it from this side or wrap it and
[15:45] then it did it hit me real hard when I
[15:48] seen him just trying and it wasn't
[15:50] working there was nothing
[15:53] that they could do and that's when it
[15:57] really hit home that there's nothing
[16:00] more that we could do we have to buy a
[16:03] wig we have to get a hat there's let's
[16:08] when it hurt she actually started
[16:12] wearing a hat the beginning of December
[16:15] it was actually in it was Friday October
[16:21] she was we show at a local County Fair
[16:24] we go we have coats and they have do 4h
[16:26] projects and she was showing at a local
[16:29] County Fair and by that point it was
[16:32] really hard to cover up the bald spots
[16:35] on her head and I couldn't either braid
[16:38] her hair anymore
[16:42] and so that was really hard but at that
[16:45] point I was still I was so proud of her
[16:48] because she didn't let that hold her
[16:51] back from showing her goat or you know
[16:54] doing her 4-h project or anything it
[16:56] didn't she just carried on no matter
[17:01] what
[17:05] [Music]
[17:07] um at that point was the end of November
[17:10] I believe that we're at church and that
[17:14] particular time was just a hard time
[17:17] because her hair was getting really
[17:19] really thin and in fact probably that
[17:21] day or another Sunday around that time I
[17:24] was actually at home on Sunday morning
[17:26] trying to sew a bigger headband because
[17:30] it just any headband we could buy wasn't
[17:32] covering so probably the one that she
[17:35] had on that day was probably like a four
[17:37] inch headband that I could third that
[17:39] morning just in trying to find her
[17:44] something that she would be comfortable
[17:45] in and she just had enough maybe to put
[17:48] into a little ponytail at that point and
[17:53] it was just I don't know at that point
[17:56] it was it was getting pretty devastating
[17:58] to see how much of it was gone and so
[18:00] like that Sunday that we had come to
[18:03] church it was just a difficult Sunday
[18:05] you know I just remember sitting in the
[18:06] pew that day and crying because there
[18:11] was nothing I could do you come against
[18:13] something like that that there's nothing
[18:16] as a parent there's nothing that you can
[18:19] do you just do your best to support them
[18:21] and what they're going through and just
[18:22] know that you had to where to put your
[18:25] trust in your faith so I mean that was
[18:28] difficult but I just remember sitting
[18:29] there crying and Matthew was actually
[18:31] sitting with me that day and
[18:34] I don't know I was really thankful for
[18:36] him being there cuz I just couldn't stop
[18:38] crying that day and we had gone to
[18:43] church and as actually just during his
[18:46] for the Tim sermon that he was talking
[18:48] about I'm talking about hair and it's
[18:53] the glory of the woman he was talking
[18:54] about how you shouldn't cut your hair
[18:58] and you know he had spoken about that
[19:00] and his sermon and he had actually win
[19:02] that back Dale and after the sermon we
[19:05] were just in worship after the service
[19:07] and when the Lord just moved on him and
[19:11] he felt very inspired to pray for her
[19:13] letting now today I preach the word I
[19:21] preach them the Apostle Paul that hair
[19:24] is the glory of the woman and the devil
[19:30] has struck down one of our children come
[19:34] on now with an illness this robbing her
[19:37] of her hair calling man today and taking
[19:43] God at His Word if he made that for his
[19:46] glory
[19:47] then I God is greater than this day
[19:49] we'll bring that child down here
[19:52] [Applause]

[25:08] God has brought it you know from from
[25:12] youth camp to family camp to where we
[25:15] are today and the different prayer lines
[25:18] that was she was in you know just the
[25:24] each day has been a step you know has
[25:29] been an awesome experience it just
[25:32] seemed like that her hair just it just
[25:37] started growing I get it just like one
[25:41] day it was there and then all sudden
[25:42] it's kind of like the like a man has a
[25:46] bald spot or a bald head and it's real
[25:50] smooth no hair follicles and that's why
[25:53] it looked on most of her head and then
[25:58] all sudden it seemed like you know the
[26:02] head as far as the skin of her head it
[26:06] looked like it was putting in hair
[26:08] follicles because it would start getting
[26:10] those little dots everywhere and it's
[26:13] like wow something's about to happen
[26:14] because before is smooth and that's when
[26:19] it kind of just kind of gave you an idea
[26:21] that something was going on you know
[26:26] just the the feeling I'm just seeing it
[26:28] growing it was just amazing just to
[26:33] watch it cuz it just it wasn't like it
[26:35] coming over here and it was just like a
[26:38] in like a little flock if you see like
[26:41] those videos of the flower and how they
[26:43] going it's kind of like what it and you
[26:47] look back on it that's kind of like what
[26:48] it reminds me up is that you know a
[26:52] fast-forward video of a flower when it
[26:55] comes into full bloom you know just I
[26:58] talked to her about you know are you
[27:00] ready to take it off and chill brother
[27:03] on your hair just like I guess so
[27:06] you know so like even before you don't
[27:10] have to enter the service I'd walked out
[27:12] and then Mariah was in the Vacation
[27:14] Bible School and I walked out and I seen
[27:18] her there and then I seen brother on and
[27:20] brother Tim walking out the service and
[27:22] I was like that was a good time so I
[27:24] grabbed my ax take her over there and
[27:27] he's like let's see your hair baby doll
[27:29] and she just pulls our hair off her hat
[27:33] off and you know you know like brother
[27:36] Tim started crying you know different
[27:39] ones and was like I asked brother Tim
[27:42] was like is that the first time you've
[27:44] seen her hair he's like yeah this you
[27:49] know is just also feeling I'm just of
[27:52] just showing showing her hair you know
[27:57] to me it was just
[27:59] you know this is what I got you know
[28:01] it's like a trophy the Saturday night
[28:05] service
[28:05] you know just awesome the way brother on
[28:09] just started talking about the different
[28:11] healings and you had the feeling that he
[28:16] was gonna start talking about her as far
[28:18] as what he'd seen that morning seeing
[28:23] her hair you had the feeling that he was
