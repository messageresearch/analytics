[Music] gonna have my little buddies here help me out with the scripture musicians give them an opportunity to go sit down here james chapter 3 verse 5 even so the tongue is a little member and posted great thinks behold how great a little matter a little fire candle is revelations 12 10 and he heard a loud voice saying in heaven that was from salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuses them before our god day and night [Applause] um it was you know i i'd like to have my little boys come up here you know because as a parent you want to you want your kids and especially you know especially the young men you want to see them voicing the word of god so many things that they could be voicing so many things that they could say you know but we want them voicing the word of god my little boy my oldest one nathan nathan yeah i'll tell you what that little guy when he asked some questions about the word that little guy asked questions things i wouldn't even never even have thought about asking hey like i said the other day when i was baptizing nathan you know as a parent at least at the stage of the journey where i'm at now with my children i don't think there's a greater thing that you can hear your child saying you know there's nothing greater to hear than you know that they want to give their hearts to the lord again so my kids are still little so i don't know if there's something greater i don't think so but but you know they're not nonetheless they've seen embargo you know it's a great great blessing i said this when uh my daughter zoe got baptized and i'll say it again what would this be slightly different two down do the best you can to live a life worthy of the gospel you can talk to them about the word you instead of playing this this is what they should do it's just looking different they said but i never try to force it upon them you know because i don't believe in the first religion i believe it's god that does the calling you know and i and i think i thank him you know that so far he's called two of my children and and to the lord jesus christ be all honor and glory i pray the same thing happens for each and every one of you we're such a great privileged people amen are you privileged man you know how many how many had a good independence day good for them you know you know i to all respect to all those that are from other countries can respond you know to maybe those are listening online and i i believe you probably feel the same way about your country you know but i believe that we live in the greatest country in the world are you from a better country this afternoon amen are you convinced that they're convinced i'm going to say that by faith yes [Music] you know but we again we come from a better country we don't look so much to what's going on here but we look we look to our our prize we look to what is coming for us you know we've been getting a lot of blessings from the lord and we rejoice when the youth come up to the front to the altar it's such a refreshing to be able to see you guys do that you know i've said this before and i'm going to say it again you know i'm kind of a guy that kind of talks a little bit like slang my brother jerry that's going to come up here in a minute now he's more proper more women i see my mom says hi myself to the people i don't want to put a put on right now i'm trying to be myself no matter where i'm at no important you know but youth it's been such such so refreshing to see you guys up here you see you up here and everybody here you know crying wanting to receive of the lord and receiving from the lord youth us as us us ministers nosotros ministers [Music] you know don't don't be don't be don't don't get offended with this but don't stop just because you're in his presence being in his presence isn't good enough to present have you been in the presence of almighty god does it still throw your heart back when you're in this presence [Laughter] they don't believe because bombings aren't very good right now but i guarantee you since it's been such a long time they're gonna the cowboy fans are gonna be going crazy [Music] it's gonna do you rejoice being in his presence amen but again being in his presence isn't good enough church solomon is so it means if there's if there's some if something in the natural god's going to typify that in the spiritual somehow different animals probably part of the reason why the pastor put you in the front because when you're sitting in the back or in the middle there's a lot of distractions that go on so that's just almost distracting so a lot of times there's a lot of movement that goes on and parents let's do the best we can to keep the getting up during the preaching to a minimum let's reference the sanctuary a little bit sometimes the parents are worse than the kids but you have the best seat in the house and what do you get to see without distractions other sunday morning and wednesday afternoon so when the holy spirit is here and the word is being brought forth because the natural absolutely types of spiritual absolutely i've been a person i've always loved to see the rain gust i love to see the lightning my wife thinks i'm kind of boring sometimes yeah i like to drive it to a dark place and just watch the lightning when it's the lady to the back of me she's standing outside it's just coming down and she's just being rained upon it what you doing amen so so you know i i i have a pretty nice backyard i think my grass is really nice i have really nice flowers you think of those flores you know i go every night and i water my flowers they get green and the flowers come out the grass grows but there ain't nothing that beats rainwater you can get out there with the water hose and you can water it you step past and it grows nothing will make you flower like the holy ghost if marvel is planted inside of it marvel marvel marvel what kind of life are we harboring inside of this earth and the when the rain begins to fall youth don't be happy just because you turn green because it looks like there's life okay because the earth will also produce farms and thistles yes and you gotta pull them out quick in tennis in my house on is i'm walking inside my house and my it's like ah what happened to all these they're crying because they got a sticker in their foot it takes a specialist to get rid of those things it takes a certain chemical to spray on them so it can kill them all these little things is goat heads amen that they're a little brown so there are the little cracks where you don't see estonians the rain falls that little goat is a tiny little crack that you don't see a place where you think it's taken care of don't need two pieces and all of a sudden little go ahead comes up i used to hate to pour weeds when i was a kid but you have to do it if not you get an infestation and although it's green it looks like it has life all you do is cause harm to people say that again all you do is cause harm to people what else comes after the rain kemos benedict after it rains we live in a place where there's a lot of mosquitoes right and these it's spiritually speaking there's these little demons that come around you want to suck your victory from you they want to suck the very life from you and you don't even know it's there it best it's is silent one it's doing insulin all of a sudden you're there and all of a sudden you have a little painting like what the heck was that smashing you have blood all over your arms when you come to church on sunday morning you get blessed sunday afternoon you come and you get blessed tell me this tell me am i the only person that's happened to you am i the only person am i that far bad off that i'm the only one but you need a repellent you need off right and the thing about off is this when you think you when you think you can do it all by yourself you come get your right arm your left arm your right leg your left leg and you think you're good to go right are you good to go you need your brother to watch your back you need my if you if you want to stay alone you're only half covered what about your back and those mosquitoes they come and again they're very very silent oh the other day i was going to work i forgot the outside garage lights on you said wings wings mosquitoes the termites come out turmeric they need the humidity and what are they trying to do get trapped on this thing what does the termite do they actually have termites oh they're attracted to the light estonia did you hear me mel yeno i said those ants and those termites are attracted to the light and what do the termites do questions is animality the very get quiet on me now youth no no it's good it's good to receive the blessings it's good to receive the rain but it's also good to be aware of what's going to happen you don't want to and those insects they're working they're looking for a weak spot in your life it doesn't matter if your daddy if your dad is a minister no but this is begins to break down what else comes out after the rain keep on starting especially after the rain disposed on yuvia frogs come out right now sure not true i hate frogs that's one of the creatures i despise yes [Music] don't get mad at me but whenever i see a frog in my house i i smash that thing i get a rock what do they represent youth get represented what do you think they represent julian what do you think always looking back that's the right answer that's exactly right brother jimmy that's not all the frog represents they represent an unclean spirit representing i'm there driving in my car i'm sorry if this offends anybody i see a frog in the road i run over the thing again because i hate what they represent okay oh you look at representatives and the thing about it is this is well the holy spirit is raining it's raining it can be a small little drizzle it can be a great downpour and all of a sudden you're there driving in your vehicle and you're in the midst of the rain well the holy spirit is falling there's little frogs there jumping around all over the place that's why i say it's not good enough to be in the presence of god did you know satan is in the is in the presence of god day and night and he uses those little messengers those little insects to look for the cracks in your life they're looking for something to accuse you of [Music] the thunder's rolling the fronts are croaking at the same time it's not good enough to be in the presence of god you want to be in him dental then you want to be sealed inside of him say hello gentlemen don't be happy because you came in your boogers came out your tears came out day in your name i've preached behind the pulpit in your name i sang it in your name i sang later in your name i played instruments in your name lord i did everything in your name surrounded a little bit in your name and in his presence he will say depart from your workers if you never care is like nikki that something that you know that you want to do and brother branham says and will not do it not something that you know how to do it not not only something that you know better and you don't do it it's something that you know better you know you will not do it oh i read this the other day gossips are worse than thieves because they steal another person's dignity honor honor reputation reputation credibility which are almost impossible to restore but when your tongue slips you can never recover your words god bless you bless you tonight are you guys still happy everyone for the furtherment of everybody [Music] i'm gonna pass the buck okay do they give me 30 minutes if i go over 30 minute minutes it's uh brother jerry the last ball for not flagging me down or so much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition of your fathers [Music] parents but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot is in contamination it was foreign before the foundation of the world but was manifest manifest in these last times for you [Music] do believe in god and raised him up from the dead and give him glory that your father and hope might be in god [Music] seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth [Music] through the spirit unto one thing love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure with pure heart burden [Music] by the word of god but you guys are going to have to engage with me a little bit tonight [Music] [Music] yes unto them that call evil good and good evil and put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for better [Music] [Music] [Music] you trust me you're gonna you gotta do it [Music] i'm assistant come in okay so the scripture in isaiah 520. it really it struck something with me because you look at the world today and you can say the united states but you look at the world and it looks like the whole world is in turmoil [Music] well it doesn't look like it isn't turmoil pandemic is just the curtain that's hiding something behind i mean i don't know if there's something else but male 1 yes our pastor and he said one thing he says we're living in the time where history is being rewritten where every everything that that's that that we see in that maybe heroes of the past people that had a great influence in in history we see that all those things are being they're being attacked they're being changed but a lot of it is the youth because we see a lot of people they we see racism in the past right a lot of african americans went through horrible times but you speak to a lot of them or hear a lot of them speak and they say that there's no such thing as this systemic racism that they talk about and like i said so you have these all these young people that are causing all this uprising so we see they want to defund the police this movement of defending the police they say they want to take the funds that go into the police force and they want to put them into different programs to help the neighborhoods they want to take the authority away from the police the ones that hold the law and they want to put them into the neighborhoods so that they police themselves and i'm not here pushing an agenda i'm not here to push an ideology i'm not here to preach right or left so i don't care what happens out there but it's when it tries to seep into the church that's what as as a ministry we are obligated to say that's why you see the pastor do what he does foreign he cares about you that much he cares about you that much is important that his priority right now is to make sure that you get a hold of it can't serve god and mammon at the same time so that's why he's doing what he's doing so you see all these movements everything is upside down from gender to i mean just people don't want to work i mean it's it's crazy it's a time that's never been seen before [Music] and that oh it's it's easy on certain parts it's fascinating but those little cracks there like my like ronnie was saying so you see why why are people why do they want to exit the message but he wants the little movements to rise up he wants to see the defunding of the ministry satan wants to make all of you what's called woke it makes you aware [Music] so but you see that there's a certain political party politico and they're trying to pass a certain pill right now and it's to improve infrastructure in the united states but to pass their hidden agendas to pass the other project that they're not talking about they'll infrastructure to include things in the bill so that way they can pass them satan's very smart so that's what happens inside the church so we try to redefine what you're interested in oh the message doesn't it doesn't mean that it really says this it's like brotherland preached once why do you have to fit the dress the word is the dress the dress doesn't fit us we think we let me ask you a question god forbid i ever get to that point where i'm unteachable is number one because that's [Applause] there's many things that i wish i could take back which is okay if he can get you to make a mistake he knows it's going to be twice as hard for you to get back double one so they want to defund cancel culture cancer they want to they want to defund the police they want to cancel culture you know they want to so really really what they want to do is they want to take the authority away of whoever is in charge and put it on themselves [Music] that way when the word of god comes very difficult very deficient but we want to push the boundaries people want to push the boundaries of what the message says and one foreign but he wants you to be in church with all these little uprisings in your own mind thinking i'm right i know more do they want to cancel culture of the message you're taking a vital portion out the scripture in the message cannot contradict the scripture and the message has the same author [Applause] [Music] that's his worship amen amen the scripture and the message cannot contradict remember that it's the same thing i mean because it is the word of god but what about well then you wonder why you get things like well god's in certain ones only god is only in certain personas why are you redefining that i promise you that it gets a little bit easier okay watch this i only need to love certain people i can have roots of bitterness in my heart and still have the holy ghost what a farce right then why do we do it i have to put my software why do we do it if we know that it is not right why do we do it i can hurt people and expect the blessings of god in my life and for you maybe my dad is a deacon or a minister maybe we have our little groups and we alienate others do we bully in this church do we bully in this church and then we wonder why we deal with depression if [Music] do we [Music] we can have all the talent in the world but it has to be genuine i can listen to precious words i can listen to the message all day long but dismiss the goal that is telling me we must hear and apply the word for the right reasons but if you're doing it [Music] [Applause] you have the revelation all the ministries [Music] so what is it that we have to do what are we striving for your seatbelts are still off right it's simple we have to be born again well is different it processes differently and it's it's sometimes it it's it feels like sometimes i'm in and it feels like sometimes there's just i struggle like i said it's not we can we it's from and hold something against our brother when i'm when i'm at home so what do we have to do we have to be born again our nature has to change our mind nature has to change if our nature does not change then we go through what's called a germination regulatory [Music] [Music] [Applause] the dictionary um the one with the ize what was the link on it i don't know if they were able to get it if not i'll just have to paraphrase okay let's go time is going so what watch this okay only in the english language by no means am i a grammar great grammar person or a big grammar buff [Music] when you add i i-z-e to a word at the end it's a verb forming suffix occurring originally in lone words from the greek within english or in english ize is added to rejected the nouns [Music] this is the part here pay attention to this part two or when a magnet magnetizes a piece of iron when the only man magnet is the piece of iron becomes a magnet makes sense if you can read in between the lines it dermatizes magnus the magnet now has the same properties not that piece of iron or as it passes and magnetize another piece of iron magnetic magnetic field has power to become we have it's possible for you young people it's not just for the adults for you this message is for you watch this observable what does the scripture say maybe i'll just read it in english i don't know let's see the the dramatized the magnetized in the beginning was the word and the word is with god and the word was god and the word and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood remember it's spiritual now nor will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god any and the word was made flesh oh what's going on right there dramatized magnetized and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace but it doesn't stop there first john 4 4 1 watch beloved believers spirit believe not every spirit but try the spirits with their of god because many false prophets are gotten out into the world watch this hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is coming yeah god came in the flesh of jesus the scripture doesn't read that way it says jesus now has come in flesh any spirit that does not confess that he's not of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is coming the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist where we have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of god little children [Applause] ye are of god because greater [Music] for you to transfer to you daughters of god i'm going to skip here my time is gone um but i gotta hit this last part here oh my goodness got my nose all messed up here so sorry sorry for yelling [Music] so this here i want to do something i'm going to do a little drama i want to see if the and the musicians could come please the pastor asked me to do a little drama with magnets but we're going to find out why found out why find out why is that what i mean this can be the night for you this is the knife for you go and tell my disciples this is kind of long i'm going to read it brother branham go tell my disciples this is a long long folk brothers [Music] standing some time ago i was standing at gary indiana were they taking me through the big gray steel mills and i was very much alarmed when i was watching that miranda the superintendent intended picking me up and you showed me all around the place every man taking his apron off and laying it up on the machine right through there around his legs and thing he was sweeping out into the aisle into the aisle and he said i'll show you something here all right then he walked back to a little place after the main whistleblower [Music] [Music] [Music] i began to notice those little shavings [Music] [Music] and that magnet went on back over into that cupola and mel and dropped all the stuff down into the cupola yes [Music] [Music] [Music] and he said all those aluminum pieces are not magnetized to that magnet is i was he said you must have been i've been i said brother way back yonder somewhere in the eternity hallelujah there's a great magnet the son of god is going to be turned loose one of these mornings or one of these evenings he's sweeping down over this earth [Music] be in the resurrection [Music] you know before the final resurrection there's got to be a resurrection of the dead now [Music] [Music] [Music] remember there will be a resurrection one of these only for those that are dead in christ [Music] but these are dead in christ then what this will god bring with him now hold up you want to be magnetized it is a magnet you want that great magnet to pass by i'll ask if the pastor in the ministry do me do me a favor brother says the little shavings are on the aisle if the ministry in the pasture just do my favorite walk up down the aisle and back up youth and church [Music] you can be magnetized right now the main magnet of the church if you would just go up and down the aisle magnus people dramatize the people just one time [Music] [Music] those circumstances [Music] [Music] [Music] receive it receive it if you believe it then receive it there's no one here that's too far gone i don't believe that as long as it's breath inside of you you have a chance [Music] receive a church yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] can you cry save yourself [Music] say [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] my [Music] oh [Music] me on earth and you just stand to your feet and just praise the lord where you're at and cry unto him all day [Music]
