first of all we want to say we we love you with all our hearts we ask that you put me to your side you speak to the people Lord May nothing come out of my mouth maybe contrary Lord maybe you speaking the right word we thank you we love you Lord we thank you we love you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen let's turn to our Bibles Romans 6 6 says first of all I want to thank the Lord for the confidence should you speak the word tonight I want to thank the pastor pastor and each and every one of you yeah knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that's a body of sin might be destroyed foreign knowing that what is going on with us what's going on in our lives we're not the right kind of people it's it's it's not me no soyo this is not the real me so you cannot receive the new birth without dying out first the day I died I understood my true identity before the foundation of the world the more I die to myself now I understand why I needed to go through this trials and tribulation to see that transformation when you die out of you will recognize who you really are now I understand now I understand we need a profit um now I understand why we needed now I understand why why the Lord blessed me with a good wife and a good family now I understand why we need a pastor that we have right now why we need each and every one of us so it's it's very important it's very important to be born again so we have to die out of ourselves in our own will is you say well I want God's perfect will yokirola I'm gonna say something you say well we all want God's perfect will and God's perfect will is not not always a better roses it hurts sometimes but you got to take it it's for our own good is you see the three Hebrew children in in the when they were in the furnace they wouldn't have never had an experience so they had to have an experience so sometimes when uh you see an illegitimate tree that's already there yes you can't prune that tree so the only way you can prune a tree when it's giving fruit is so my question is this is how many perfect trees do we have here tonight God can only prove you know only when you're producing something it's already giving it's already giving something yes I'll go so why does God prune the tree for him if you cut that sickness away be forced to start before it starts spreading out why do we go through these trials and tribulations so you say trials and tribulations you go through depression depression you say well I did something wrong maybe I did a mistake I I failed it's not always the case if you look at the prophet uh you look at Job Prophet I hope he had trials he was a perfect and upright man perfect man perfect God asked the devil told the devil devil the devil's minding his own business so what did God do it's okay he made the devil think a little bit and he goes it might sound like Garza he's an instigator he says but he's not I don't know is and he goes yeah well you gave him everything but don't touch your soul so you look at this how much confidence did God have in job and Hope does he have confidence in me and me does he have confidence in you devil will make you feel like you're a nobody if that's the case why is he always after you yes because he's just lying to you the devil says you're weak you are nobody but it's not that all right let's go to second Samuel um 339 foreign foreign so whatever you're going through it doesn't matter what you're going through you're still anointed you're still going to prayer yes and that's what drives a double crazy and what drives the devil crazy even more he is when you ask God for something and God doesn't give it to you and God and you can still serve the Lord with all your heart and David made the statement I am this day devil was still anointed did you know that it is possible you can be weak but still you're you're anointing the Bible says that we're a royal priesthood is weakness and anointed they stand together foreign to overcome we are people of victory Victoria and and tonight we have the devil going so why why do we do the things that we do you know sometimes we we go through through life you see something and you put it in God's hands and and the word says that the Lord shall fight for you and he shall hold your peace now we have to lift our banners way higher tonight he can hold his peace you can hold your peace bad thoughts amientos you can hold your peace Trials of life he can't hold your peace how can God trust us with this message because we have call us before the foundation of the world well I've never met brother you don't have to foreign because that's your light shine be foreign so this message and the word and they will shake the kingdom of hell de limpierno the same holy ghost that was with brother banham it's on the bright tonight and the bride will have a double portion is so the Greater Works they speak eternal life I've learned live for your brother will be possible live for your brother if you want healing tonight if you want your son and daughter back tonight if you want your family back if you want your healing back if you want to join back if you want your Victory back it is all you have to do yes Bossier in John 14 14. if you ask anything in my name is I might do it I will do it so this message is a person yes it's a person of Jesus Christ it has to become tangible but you can touch them this message has to produce the holy ghost in your life is deceived so the weakest Christian tonight can defeat the Devil any place anytime anywhere of the Lord so another thing I want to remind the devil is one of the things that the angel specified nothing will stand anger well Elisha if God is God and that's his Prophet yes I got to take this place and I need a spirit to do it now if God is God and brother was a prophet lemon we got to check that prophecya now this message we gotta gotta have to tailor us foreign there's nothing that can defeat right now and God has called us to be a confirmation and I believe that with all my heart there were more than Overcomers tonight we will not be defeated there's not an invincible Army coming Adventure invincible there's not a uh it's already here tonight yes and it's right here's been sitting down in front of us the the generation of David would have loved gustado to have these people here tonight is well God has you here tonight for another reason you are the final voice for the final for the final age as long as you're in God's will nothing can stop you because for I am persuaded another death death or nor life the mark of the High Calling Jesus so we are more than able and we will fight don't give up because God is with us because the holy spirit will rise up a standard against them and you young people you have the power to create atmospheres around you foreign well it's too late for him now yes we are the manifestations of sons of God doesn't even have his own vocabulary he uses God's word and tries to twist it around so he's powerless tonight we are predestinated should be here tonight before you say let there be light you knew you were going to be blessed before he said she said you were already healed before he said letter b see ya you are people of victory Victoria Branham Brenham I made a mistake last week or last month I don't care how many mistakes you made we've all sail and come short of the glory is if you're a child of Abraham you're ready to recognize that as him and come back to God again still hangs foreign when Elisha Jordan as we know that was death separation separation I like the way he said it when you cross over Jordan he says this it wasn't that bad see death it's really bad you're going to recognize it wasn't that bad we're here for Elisha says here right quick yeah see you and he knows yes they are foreign don't worry when I died out Leo Marie when I died to myself I gave up everything I was the happiest man on the face of the year because God transforms you okay he'll make a way for you and you'll send a Revival in your soul is [Applause] foreign God bless his word God bless this word can you bless the Lord this evening come on come on Church Ramos Iglesia can you bless the Lord this evening because one day yeah does it still thrill your soul to see that cross in front of you as uh that crossed his death it's a cruise so let us stand we'll be speaking on the day I died First Corinthians 15 31 remember and this is our scripture that our pastor has given us the Lord has given us this year yes Paul says I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily amen you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the words the day I died why is this statement so important why do we even need to hear it today it's something that nobody likes to talk about nobody likes to talk about death maybe it makes me feel funny even I when you hear someone that's passed away I don't know how to deal with it uh and I don't have I don't know how to comprehend it but Jesus has said Jesus that if any one would come after me okay let him deny himself why why would you want to take up a cross the cross means death wouldn't I just look like a dead person all the time so black and gloomy this cross means something is that's what the Romans instructed to be put in place they wanted to put a statement out to the Jews humiliation that when you are seen died that when you are dead on the cross it's the notice to the rest of them to bring fear into their lives and you deny yourself the day I died this phrase has impacted me because I start thinking about questions it gets personality should get personal in you can you say the day that I died can you repeat it again it's got to get personal it causes you to examine yourself this is our thing for the year not just something you that you just think of once so what happened on the day that I died this question is also in a processo because we live in time this question this statement points me to a milestone is can you think of the last day that you died but I'm breathing right now brother Seth you know it's the day that I died is when I died to this old sinful nature when I die to the sinful flesh I was born with this I didn't really want it it was the sin that I was given yeah I was born in this I inherited this yes we come to this world speaking lives we come with a lot of bad habits habits that we don't even choose ourselves maybe something that we inherit from family members but most of all we come alienated from God we come with a lot of unbelief so this is foreign better this year maybe I can take some classes and learn how to sing better it's a resolution a resolution supposed to mean something significant that's a firm decision to do something only about 46 of the people make a resolution actually keep it the day that I died can you ask yourself so we want to upgrade our habits all right so I want to I want you to imagine something we're going to look at two characters all right these two people are smokers so a full man I'm not gonna just pick on the smokers but if you want to parallel it is these two people are Christians as well and they're trying to resist a cigarette someone is dangling a cigarette in front of you every day something of sin in front of you every day and when you're offered this is when you're offered doubt brother Ronnie the first person says no thanks no gracias I'm trying to quit you see I made a New Year's resolution to quit I'm trying pretty hard every day all right I'm trying very hard sounds like a regional response but this person the problem with this mentality it's very subtle as we uh we as we begin this person still believes they are a smoker you still believe that you are a sinner you haven't died out fully all right you know you still think you're that old guy from last year and your hopes being that you can try and change your life but you still carry that baggage of of Doubt or sin upon it is the second person says he says no thanks he said no when you offer something to him no I'm not a sinner no more you can can find yourself in this is myself and I'd rather say that I'm trying to go to church stop trying tonight tonight it's hard every day there has to be something that's every day that's the resolution vamos you see the Apostle Paul tells you yeah I died daily um it's a choice he made he got a little right he got Revelation the Lord himself changed his course one way it is now another yeah identified with Christo I Paul a prisoner of Christ you know he went from Saul for this persecuting all the Christians to maybe the cheese whistle Sinners all the Christians to come back to Christo this theme has kept kept telling me yes what have I done in my life how many times last year did I die die and said Lord I don't want to do what I want to do you know you know I have dreams and aspirations the Lord Lord senor I want to die for you you died for me can I die for you the day that I died and I'm not done because there's a lot of more Brothers Seth that needs to die but this year let's start it today for I am crucified with Christ nevertheless but Christ Living in Christ and the life which I now live yeah I live by faith can you believe on God's word today and gave me for himself that's the day that I died when I heard a preacher God call me I was dead and sins and trespassed foreign I said you yourself I'm a prisoner of Christ can you put your name in there it's a good day to die he wants you to die because when you die to sin foreign a milestone to look at yeah because when someone dangles some sin in front of them it's not I'm trying to quit no that's the day that I died I know what that looks like it's over there it's on the tree it's crucified with Christ the day that I died is the day we become a new creature to Die daily that's the day that I died is the day I chose to go back to God is especially in the morning especially in Las mananas got to make sure he's dead let this be the day you died as brother will comes forward second Corinthians 5 14. for the love of Christ constraineth us because with us judge that if one died for all then we were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth no we know man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more yeah therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new then will be the day you die don't be scared I was scared but the day you die you're going to become a new creature and you will fulfill the purpose that God has meant for everyone who is not a negative thing we look at the positive eternal life God bless you [Applause] thank you amen God bless you this evening Daniel that's brother Seth Seth there was some good stuff I think we're done already right amen I'm going to ask you to stand yeah amen I thank our pastor for this opportunity this evening to uh to share what I what I have on my heart amen and uh we're gonna turn into the book of Galatians and uh we're gonna start with uh thank you we'll start with verse 18. foreign or if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor is for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God verse 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Who Loved Me and gave himself for me crucified [Music] you know it's uh it's something uh that the theme of this year was the day that I died uh um as I was uh as I was thinking about this it uh brought me to a couple of stories and you hear this all the time especially during the time of Easter is people just doing insane things to be crucified said crucified literallymente there's a story of a man um his name was Patrice de Mao is he was a man of uh of the Dominican Republic Dominicana and he wanted to be crucified crucified and he set up this uh this event I was televised and it was viewed by thousands and thousands of people this man had three six inch stainless steel nails driven through his hands uh and intended to stay on the cross for 48 hours is however after just 20 hours he requested to be taken down because he developed an infection this man was taking I am crucified with Christ literally another Kenyan man also wanted to be crucified crucified but he wanted to he sought to be crucified crucified to show his Devotion to Jesus he wanted to secure forgiveness for his country yes what he did one day was he asked his wife Esposa wife esposa would you crucify me crucifix now man don't don't go home after after the servant says don't try this at home okay I'm serious the inside you he was compelled to be crucified after reluct after reluctantly obeying is posa crucified him low crucifico after she did this she immediately she immediately collapsed and died from shock this man was rescued by his neighbors but later was he he died from infections and what does this say it's easy especil to say I want to be crucified with Christ when we're in what we what we would say are elements when we're here in church the spirit is moving it feels good it feels right correct we say I want to be crucified I can do it but many times even as soon as we leave service what we felt just minutes ago seemed like an eternity and now being crucified with Christ is no longer a priority in our lives we've taken what we've heard and we've thought about it we've felt it we had an emotion about it but we are never we never implemented when we look at the crucifixion when we look at what God has done for us when we look at the three crosses we can say well Christ was in the middle Christos you the thieves were on the side and there I was crucified with Christ and it sounds great it sounds uplifting but when it really comes down to it it seems like it's impossible but but it's impossible now I'm not here I'm not here no estoyaki to put a downer on this in any way but uh I'm not here to make it at all gloomy but I'm here to make you think I don't want to give you an emotion it has an emotion just lasts a little bit but when we can be really crucified with Christ I really understand what that means is that I am crucified with Christ because he died in my stead if we turn into the book of Romans we're going to go to Romans 6 6. Romano says ah it says knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin is for he that is dead [Music] is freed from sin what a paradox that is that Paul would say I Die daily I say oh my goodness so what does that mean yes well we heard it from Brother uh brother Seth everything that we do all that we have done and what we're going to do in the future it does every single day or is that just me what we did last year we look back and have regrets and have things that oh I got man I I just I just wish I would have done this better choice I wish I would have been a better father a better husband and it starts to torment us what we could have done differently all the mistakes we're making oh but there is something when we can leave to all the things that we have gone through and place them on the cross but it's the daily thing but sometimes it's just a Sunday thing I basically says sometimes it's just a Wednesday thing you know I was thinking of all the things that I did last year is it I was saying Lord because I said I know that you are the ultimate sacrifice you paid the price and I said Lord I did I did some pretty good sacrifices last year yeah I did see I think I did pretty good okay trying to justify myself a little bit I went on a quite a few missionary trips good for me um I think I served the Lord pretty good last year and he says I didn't call you to sacrifice when I when I heard that for myself I said Lord what do you mean I'm I'm doing what you're what you're what you've called me to do and it takes me to email I'm gonna skip a few things here take me to Luke 22 42. you have a uh uh Lucas Italian when I was a young preacher 20 minutes felt like an eternity as you get older 20 minutes feels like seconds we're going to skip a few things here 22 42. he says father say Padre if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless we don't know not my will but thine be done here is the sacrifice Lord what what do you want what do you want me to to get out of this is Philippians 2 5 through 8. it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Christ so being in the form of God started not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon Him Commando the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men he says you want to sacrifice you want to die out yeah but there's two things you got to do before that I said oh my goodness what do I have to do isn't isn't being dead enough isn't dying out to myself enough no he says this is what Jesus did verse 8 verse and being being found in fashion as a man standing condition number one numerono he humbled himself oh my goodness to get somebody to be humble to have humility to take away their pride I said Lord this year Lord I know that I have sacrificed but that's not but that's not it is he humbled himself and became so obedient oh my God so you got humility before death antes you've got obedience before death two things before you can even Die daily you gotta humble yourself so this this brought me to to a very something that might be insignificant I would say Lord all right I've I've got I've got I think I've got it he goes you're not even serving me in the smallest things you're doing terrible at this I said Lord what is it they're at service all the time I do all of this he says well take a look at something he says what about your time because are you there 30 minutes before the service starts I'm I'm here thinking that it's going to be some some huge thing in my life I look and I said well I Lord I try my best I got a job you know I I can work hard you know get out of work late sometimes but there you are sacrificing sacrification but you're sacrificing for the wrong thing I'm not calling you to sacrifice I'm calling you to be obedient I'm calling you to humble yourself and you haven't done it in the list of things so my question how crucified are we estamos crucified how crucified are our ears how crucified is our tongue how crucified are our eyes how crucified is our minds if he's gonna reign in us and we're gonna die out daily then we gotta real life that we have that God is going to use them to further his plan is yeah if see if C we can humble ourselves and be obedient I said Lord I said die now is a lot harder than what I thought he says but really it's not how hard is it to how hard is it to obey get done deficiness of what they said it's easy to obey is when the thing that you're being obedient obedient about is what you're comfortable with right the pastor told me to do this yeah well when I found myself Pastor said to be here 30 minutes early and I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing that's some that's me so yo so I said Lord I want to serve you in the big things but I gotta start with those small things I gotta get right I've got to see how I'm being crucified daily oh I'm dying daily Lord if it doesn't conform to your word Lord I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing you know this this year estano as we as we see it is it going to be a tough year I tell you every year that I've gone through has been a tough year every year is like that but I want to I want to close with this with this quote here from the message the token it says the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted it is now you can't get the token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it is I'm a Brother David isn't is that this is that easy the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it that's right a CS what como believe it accept it accepted full obedience complete obedience through the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token full obedience not the part of it as far as your as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word is Christo brings you into Christ now what if you was just all in our case is but your feet hanging out what if you was all in yes with your hands hanging out most most all of us but the heart hanging out the hearts in the world foreign [Music] so that I can die God bless you [Applause] man God bless his word this evening there is coming a day when no heartaches shall come no more clouds in the sky No More Tears is to dim the eye and

location of your device and it will search for foreign and so whenever you've I'm sorry you should play the Jeopardy we'll give you some time and so when you find our church you basically join it is there's just a few steps and then then you're basically attached to our account another important step after you do that is if you can go to your profile yes and please complete that because it doesn't automatically fill all that in it through this app we're also going to be posting all the events that are going on on at the church not only services but seminars youth meetings Etc anything like that is and also as well moving forward we're also going to start posting all our service information such as our YouTube videos in here as well all in one place so that you can have easy access to it yes um so after you join through the app it we will then assign you to certain groups that you pertain to depending on it is yes brother Mike how about you come over if anyone has any issues you can contact me or it's not that difficult I can definitely help anyone that needs yeah if there's anyone else yes brother Sammy no it comes up under Cedar Hills Church of the cross I believe you can search for either key term and it should come up Cedar Hills Church of the Cross there is a dash in there but I believe it comes up either way yes I think we can try to come up with a QR code if someone's having issues now amen yeah and we need it we need everyone to sign up not just one person for a household but if you have a device especially youth because like I said we're going to have different groups Youth and adults um like I said if you just search for it based upon your device location it'll give you a list of churches in the area it is in that list okay okay I guess that's it God bless you [Applause] so if the young people downloaded the app you would know there's youth meeting this Saturday at tap is remember our service on on Sunday will be continue the great many
