sister rachel and immediately following her sister elizabeth gallego amen published i don't get up here as often as i should and come on but i have so much to be grateful for if i can get through this without crying it's really rare to get that sick from a gallbladder it happened and he almost died he knew it he felt it i saw it and we just cried out to the lord he seemed lamented he gave me a message to give to his children because he truly didn't believe that he was going to make it out of the emergency room yes and we couldn't take it anymore either we called our pastor our house our pastor happened to be at the same hospital at the same time as we were i promise you the spirit of the lord came down into that emergency room that piece came down like a blanket and it literally rocked my husband to sleep is they couldn't figure out his issue here so he was transferred to el paso and his liver was really congested and all the toxins and bile had backed up and spilled into his bloodstream he turned orange and he was so jaundiced his eyes were yellow his pancreas was so inflamed you could just see it out the top of his stomach the bilirubin was high his white blood cells were high his liver his pancreatic enzymes they were critical one of his enzymes just to give you an idea that they climbed from 6 000 to 9 000 and the normal range is 110. he was in so much pain the pain was just crippling there's nothing i could do to help him strangle a couple of nurses i'm just kidding because even though i couldn't do anything i knew that our lord could not i just cry and say lord increase my faith you've given me this mountain you have to give me the strength to get through it is not just by his word but he gave me friends he gave us family our church family foreign your phone calls your text messages your prayers visiting looking out for our son miranda he's come after our family in a lot of ways but we didn't get lost in the details we never let the doctors voices be louder in our minds and that still small voice inside seems like the devil turned the temperature up seven times with words like liver failure cancer he's gonna die el but that just made me smile because i knew jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and i remembered what he did back then when the heat got turned up on those three boys in the fiery furnace so that must mean nothing less than the fourth man is about to step in significantly [Music] his blood values started to improve and he was stable enough to get the surgery that he needed he's here he's healing and he's ready to serve another day i'm so great it's the greatest weapon it is love let me fight every day you gave me strength i love each and every one of you thank you just gracias [Applause] [Music] eternity as the soldiers drove the nails will we learn from what they've done or make the [Music] which one will you take i'll take jesus when you see the gates of heaven you hear [Music] which one will you take [Music] the greatest things that i have ever done they're not gonna matter on that day of my earthly treasures that i have laid away they're gonna be to me just a memory this you'll hear me say i'll [Music] i'll take jesus [Music] of heaven you hear the master which one will you take [Music] me [Music] which one will [Music] [Applause] god bless you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] then [Music] now [Music] [Applause] hey man we would like to welcome brother andy molina with brother justin grant may god bless you may you feel at home today [Applause] oh sometimes the day seems long our trial's hard to bear we're tempted [Music] despair but christ dwells [Music] is forever [Music] [Applause] worth [Music] us life's trials will seem so small [Music] [Applause] [Music] till [Music] amen at this time we're gonna sing the last verse if you would all stand this time we'll be introducing our ministers our brother jonathan abatha and our brother jerry dallo how many are ready for the word amen i believe we have all come an expectation for what the lord has for us amen let's receive it tonight's day will soon all storms [Music] of heaven on the ground [Applause] [Music] and [Applause] when we [Music] one [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] glory [Music] that's our goal right in life i can tell you right now he's not going to get you yo we're not going to let him get you and no no this service is we always uh we have the youth upfront [Music] is not if you guys stray you guys uh you stay this forwardness pray if you guys stray we're going to come get you i'm telling you right follow jesus that's my uh my title tonight follow me yes you're not following me amen amen real quick before i read the scripture um that can tell me the seventh step of courtship is you oh you know one of them at least one of the steps isaiah knows i think isaiah tell me him friendship courtship engagement married supper honeymoon home life wow give me my hand that's awesome [Applause] every you should have known that amen how many youth have a job six seven eight eight of you have jobs that's pretty neat how many of you are eighteen or older how many have you paid tight do you know that we are supposed to tithe our time we're supposed to give the lord 2 hours and 40 minutes a day this goes for all of us just something food for the thought yes okay not to get you keep you standing let's go to the scripture uh wow these letters are getting smaller and smaller this this is a bible it's a brand new bible given to me by my brother justin thank you brother justin yes justin gracias so 418 what is like this yeah see and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a ned into the sea or they were fishers and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men amen may the lord add his blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated we know that the apostles they were they were just ordinary men they were about their daily duties yes and jesus asked them to follow him did they just stop what they were doing and follow him [Music] what do we do when jesus asked us to follow him you know the hardest thing today for our youth is [Music] my mother used to tell me when i was your ages 16 yes he says she's to say son you hope you have to separate from the world i would say growing up i was a pretty popular guy i had a lot of friends a lot of friends amigos turn and look now if each and every one of my friends was in this building and each and every one of you if your friends jesus amigos which were so-called friends were in this building espacio we would not even come close to having room espacio somebody you can show [Music] uh [Music] can we go and show this message somebody we hardly know youth can we do that to go and talk to someone about jesus is it hard it's difficult it is hard but us as christians claiming to be christians cristiano and believe in this message if we can't speak to one person foreign the other day i was i was doing some work around the church and all of a sudden brother fidel walked up and he tells me this he says how is that water in my garden [Music] and the lord told me to come say hi to you yes it's okay i'll see you man uh he says no no drop what you're doing and go greet your brother ebay look to the right look to the left do you really know the person sitting next to your again look to the right look to the left [Music] yes so was it five seconds later me and brother fidel are crying like babies that's what we were no shouldn't we know these things shouldn't we know these things half of the half of you and here i don't know where you live we need to change we need to do something about this you need to do something about this necessity he says and we expect to spend eternity [Music] something's very wrong there right brothers carlos was my neighbor growing up [Music] then we look at you youth you know when you guys were tank yeah grace was my neighbor growing up where brother caleb was my neighbor i love you honey an acquaintance is a person that you know slightly an acquaintance is a person is that you know slightly but who is not a close friend are we close friends remember jesus says follow me you know when you when us hunters go out into the woods you hunters know this somebody always leave against but there's times we know hunters that we separate [Music] what happens when you're out in the woods and you're all by yourself but we have to learn to follow before we can leave follow jesus i'm telling you youth if you on sundays and wednesdays el domingo el mircoles we have to make our call in short make i had a young friend that died of this pandemic i mean like two three days older uh and it really hit me hard just just to think this this individual never smoke never right yesterday jesus don't [Music] we try reasoning with god yes you are you you are yourself when my mother was on her dying bed that was probably the hardest thing i ever had to go through i wasn't serving the lord at the time i wasn't a bad person but i wasn't serving the lord what do i say to her what do i say to her so in her in her hospital room i was singing church him everyone i could think and that's the only thing that would comfort and right before she passed away you know if you just let my mother live i will serve you all the days of my life why didn't i serve the lord before my mother got sick why didn't i serve the lord why didn't i say oh lord before she got sick if you save her now were the disciples good men were they good men they were preaching right he has jesus says go out and preach the gospel preach repentance so we're so were the apostles good man one of them betrayed jesus are you serious you're not jesus [Music] you know what that's equivalent to today valencia foreign [Music] how many [Music] with him talk with him they ate with him and yet the things they did so we find out can you tell me youth which of the apostles had a natural death by herod by aron aron i'm sorry and how did peter die come on i heard someone say he was crucified upside down he wasn't aware being crucified like christ andrew was said to have been crucified andrew andres was said to have been crucified bartholomew was a martyr so they died some horrible deaths i'm going to cut through some of these these notes here so much that can be said but the devil we know always works in beauty he's going to make his road more beautiful than jesus's road camino more beautiful than the jesus's road [Music] so if this is jesus's so can we be following jesus and then step on over [Music] jesus i'll share a little something humor with you in a little bit here real quick well we can't do that we can't follow jesus one day and then follow satan the next jesus we get off the path with jesus [Music] and catch him where we left i just want to read a poem real quick i'll be finishing and asking brother jerry to come up remember youth is do you use have a credit card i had a debit card debit card is your own money credit card elijah has a credit card you have a credit card oh you have a credit card can i borrow it sometimes do you have enough credit to land he then will ask my dear child [Music] your card is all maxed out you know life is like a credit card why do we always doubt remember remember that jesus is always in charge why do we only pay the minimum after everything he does remember life is always very hard until we follow jesus each and every day and you god and god bless my brother jonathan yeah i didn't do anything i didn't want to do and a lot of it wasn't good you know i uh forgive me my mom passed away in january but me and jonathan were friends for many years we did a lot of things a lot of it wasn't good but i thank god that he never he introduced this word to me and for that i will always be grateful you know because because in a way in strong influence in my life [Music] and a lot of it wasn't good right many young people have had influences in influences or being influenced once you influence yourself one way or the other i my mom didn't like brother jonathan i mean i don't want to say she hated him that's a strong word but she didn't like him and every time he would call me she would wouldn't let me know [Music] because half the things we did weren't very good and i'm not doing this to shame brother jonathan but like i said i i a lot of things i did because i wanted to no no no but it goes i'm saying it for for a reason how many of us know friends from the world i may have friends that aren't christians and those friends that aren't christians sometimes aren't going to be a good influence i'm going to visit no one is was when he became king 16 years old that that at 16 years old that is a lot of responsibility right responsibility he had a lot of responsibility and we'll start with uh with first second kings 15. and we'll just start with verse one i'm like brother jonathan the words are getting smaller but i got some help and it reads like this in the 20th and 7th year 70th year of jeroboam king of israel be of israel began as a raya son of amaziah king of judea to reign 16 year old 16 years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned 2 and 50 years in jerusalem his mother's name was of jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father amaziah had done because he was a he was a great king right usia was a great king right he did a lot of good things for the lord and he obeyed the lord the best he could you know and that's why i say there there there's a lot of influences out there yeah but sometimes we ourselves [Music] but i can influence myself my own thoughts can influence me you know and that's why when i first came to the lord i i was i i didn't understand it you know you know i didn't i i didn't grow up you know coming to church i didn't grow up in this message that's why i say you you young people foreign my children included me you're very privileged to grow up in this world you know you have a beautiful word in front of you you have a road map in mapa that leads you that's leading you a certain way i had a road map but but the road is straight right i was born in los angeles you know in los angeles and uh i wouldn't say i had a a rough life [Music] we struggle like like normal people do i guess you could say you know but i was i never knew there was a god i never knew jesus died on the cross i never knew all the things that he could do for you or he could do for me for me you know and we lived in in los angeles still till i was about 11 12 years old and we had to leave very quickly this is just a short testimony but we had to leave very quickly because my dad wasn't a very good guy you know he never knew the word he was uh he was a heroin addict he was addicted to drugs and i saw as a as a as a young kid i saw a lot many things people your age shouldn't see much you know just i mean they seem funny now but you should never have to see those things you know an example was my my dad was always wanted by the police and it's it's not on fact it's not like new mexico no mexico yes you have a warrant [Music] on your door in los angeles they they they wanted you so my dad was always he was like i said he was in trouble i'm not trying to shame the guy but but but it's just just an example police department open the door well my dad would jump out of bed and he would jump out the window and my mom would be like no hold on hold on i'll be right there by the time she opened the door he was gone and this happened many times yesterday you know and here i'm like what is he doing you know there's a front door you know but uh there was there was one time where they they caught on to him they knew he was stalling [Music] he and the next thing you know all i heard was a big old crash so they kicked the door in front so he didn't have time to get very far so he gets me out of bed puts me in the shower tells me to undress [Music] so he says when you hear them come stick your head out the the [Music] you know i guess they didn't want to go you know little kid in the shower you know those are some of the things i saw as a young kid [Music] and it's not good you know i was even in the bathroom [Music] when he was injecting him i saw him so drugged up that that they took him out in a straight jacket [Music] things that we shouldn't see that's [Music] they would have hurt pretty much the whole family [Music] because he mixed up he did something well i don't know if anybody's heard of the mexican mafia mexicana if you look it up they're pretty rough so anyway we had to we had to move i mean when we're in house one day and a week later we're in new mexico [Music] central of all places central and mexico of all places and i hated it i i was miserable could you imagine los angeles to where i where i lived in central dundee in central and i don't know if you know if anybody remembers central if they lived there in in about 1981-82 okay there was a car wash right right into town [Music] right when you turn in there's a car wash right there on the corner [Music] i believe it'd be to the right and then across the street there was a house [Music] and then there was like some log cabins and a gas station my back door when i walk out my back door because if you go down to the back of the house there was a creek right that ran through there [Music] [Music] [Music] you know and i say that as a story because because as like i said as i grew up it wasn't i i didn't you know my mom and dad separated when i was in junior high school [Music] and it wasn't it wasn't good you know so that's when i started doing the things that i wanted to do in business [Music] but then i met the lord [Music] [Music] i still have friends like jonathan's they're not friends they were acquaintances these are my friends right here these are your friends in life these are your friends that will stick by you through thick got to that point right i mean he did a lot of good for the lord he was a good man but he got to a point and he felt in his heart that he could do whatever he wanted right he thought he could do a certain thing he thought he could do a certain thing he got so mad at them for them trying to stop it and the lord gave him leprosy and that's the way i i felt one at one point in my life he brought me from this situation to this [Music] so here comes the friends achieving los amigos the influences las influences they say hey jerry remember hey how you doing i haven't seen you in a while hey let's go hang out over here where the young people struggle and not just young people but everybody in general is but the lord is after the future of the church i mean the devil is after the future of the church because he knows if he can put a stop to it [Music] plan he cannot stop god's plan in your life he cannot stop god plan in your life [Music] because the devil is a roaring actually if he wants to do anything to any of you guys the power he had over me i gave it to him because i had influences that wanted me to make the enemy to start doing the things that i used to do okay but we have to do away with the influences now we're going to have to deal with this world yes we are we're going to need to deal with people we're going to have friends of this world but they only want to do one the devil only wants to do one thing to everybody and the young people he wants to shame your testimony testimonial because right what is it what does the word say we are written epistles of all men basically [Music] people saw my life the crazy thing is i told him i was going to church but there i was drinking with him i was a stumbling block for that person because i was saying one thing [Music] but my life portrayed another thing [Music] so i'm responsible for that life you want to live the best life you can we want to live the best godly life we got to do away with the influence influences because one day the day you're born your book starts right well we all have a book the day we're born our book starts one day i could leave here after service [Music] you know and god forbid i can get in an accident i don't know but one day your book's gonna close so what are we doing right now in this moment what are we doing right now that when our book closes you're going to say we know where we're going we and my own thoughts proposed started to betray me [Music] because there was times where i didn't need anybody to go do what i was going to do but i said there's only one is not true [Music] that's what gets the devil out of bed he's not out of bed because you're sitting here and coming to church because he's the first one here he's the first one here but when he gets out of bed is and who their [Music] [Music] but with the lord jesus christ on our side with the lord jesus christ fighting for us we can make it we don't have to to and that's how king josiah got he was he was boasting he says i'm this great man oh you say brittany and he was but he let it set in his heart that he was this great man but that he could do whatever he wanted we have in closing as the musicians come i want to read something here brother [Music] uncensored where they curse not the maltesen and use god's name in vain and that ain't going on today because i was watching a tv program on regular tv and they were dropping f-bombs like crazy [Music] and it used to be wrong for the children in the holiness churches to go to to bioscopes or picture shows um and now saying gotta jump one jump ahead by bringing it right in the house in the form of television and then uncensored you know and and that and so forth you see and that's satan's way of gradually entering in yes that's why i say you gotta put on the whole armor of god of salvation so you don't let that get in but brother says [Music] [Music] it used to be used to have entertainment for the children and you sat down on your toboggan and just move around and around there was a hole a and before you you knew it down you went i used to aha and that's the way sin is yes don't trifle with it don't see how close you can get to it see how far you can stay away from it don't take no chance if you're going to take a chance you i don't want a chance that's how easy sin is [Music] like like that stay away from the bad influences in your life stay with the family of god stick with the family of god stick with the friends you have here take one for another question pray one for another amen god bless you yo please stand amen amen how many enjoyed that can we give one to god's servants amen can we give one to god our lord jesus christ oh how i love jesus with all your heart now how [Music] oh yes how i love oh how i love him how i love jesus and oh lift your voice [Music] love jesus and oh yes how i love [Music] love me and to me he is so wonderful and to me yes peace [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] momentos [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music]

you amen amen let us sing that last i sing that song brother will it took a miracle as we call our brother jerry then oh let's just sing that while our hearts before we go home if you could just raise your hands to him and worship him with all of your heart because it took a miracle to save my soul amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] is but when he saved my soul [Music] [Applause] oh it took a miracle once again with all your heart now [Music] [Applause] hang [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] once again with all your heart now oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] god is good amen thank god for his word this evening [Applause] god bless you brother jonathan thank you for that amen let's keep on keeping on amen i think we've come too far to turn back [Music] [Music] i believe some fireworks are going to be set off [Music] amen just of course remember to pray one for another amen and pray for our pastor and his wife [Music] on you lord all things are possible where
