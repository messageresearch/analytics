on your feet may you would you uh join me with that in Reading Matthew chapter 26 email foreign I asked brother Noah that or told brother Noah that I was gonna just read it in English to save time in English they're gonna put it here in spanish here yeah Matthew 26 and verse 50. okay and it says and Jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him 51. and behold one of them which was which were with Jesus stretched out his hand and Drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest as smooth off his ear now notice here that he uh he again as I was making episodes as I was reading he took out he stretched out his hand extended sumanu and got his sword he didn't get Jesus's sword Jesus because Jesus never had a sword Jesus because Jesus was the sword Jesus was the word but this gentleman here didn't have that sword he had his own he may be seated we're going to read uh verse 52. Ben said Jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all that take the sword Shall Perish with the sword now if you would join me with uh in Mark chapter 14. verse 46 verse and they laid their hands on him and took him and one of them that stood by Drew a sword and smooth the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear amen if you join me with in Luke chapter 22 verse 49. that says when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him Lord shall we Smite with the sword and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear and Jesus said and Jesus answered and said suffer ye thus far and he touched his ear and healed him so I want you to notice here that that Luke is saying something a little bit different than what Matthew and Mark said let me rephrase that not something different he adds a little something little more to it we're seeing the same scene here islamism but but Luke is emphasizing the right ear and he's emphasizing that Jesus touched his ear amen now if you turn with me with the Book of John De Juan yes then said Simon Peter having a sword drew it as smooth the high priest servant and cut off his ear his right ear the servant's name was melchus then said Jesus unto Peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cope which my father hath given me shall I not drink it amen so here here we in the Book of John John takes it just a little bit further than what Luke did not only does he mention the year but John is the only one that mentions the two by name Peter with the sword who's at the receiving end of the sword amen so these four gospels there are these uh they're known as the four gospels right and you might ask well brother Ronnie well why did you read the same story out of the four gospels where can I get to that but before we do I I want to make emphasis on these things here each gospel each writer has a meaning to it it's not just there just by coincidence now to start with the number four is the number of Deliverance now these four gospels they are the framework to the church they are the guards to the temple they are the guards to the Pentecostal blessings without these four gospels there is no Pentecost this so they are they are the four living creatures the Flying Eagle Volante which is John is one look the man which is Luke is Lucas the lion Leon Matthew and the ox is Mark is uh Marcos now they are the guards to the throne Guardians now how many have the Holy Ghost here how many are the Temple of the Holy ghosts so so God moved his throne from Heaven down to earth into the heart of man you have the Holy Ghost you have four guards that protect you why because your heart is the throne we find that in uh you know the temple in the First Corinthians chapter six here in uh here in this scene here with with malcus and Peter against we we uh this isn't the scene of The Garden of Gethsemane when Jesus was praying it's the sinners now this was the last miracle that Jesus did before he was uh crucified Jesus is the Bible says was a servant of the high priest brother Branham calls them that he says that he's a priest you know but as I Googled him and I tried to find out a little bit more about Marcus I found out that there's not a lot of melkes you know the only thing I found was that he was of the tribal Benjamin cooking contest it wasn't until until I went to the Greek Lexicon and I found out what the name melkus means no it is so right away the Holy Spirit catches my attention he was a priest and he means and the Holy Spirit says now did he not make all of us Kings and Priests oh how dare you brother Ronnie how dare you compares to malcus he was assisting in the rest of Jesus we've all betrayed Jesus at one time or another Jesus we are all Gentiles by Nature contrary to God but he paid us Kings and Priests so now who is Peter simple questions right ABCs Peter was an apostle the chief Apostle and Peter was the one that had the great revelation of who Jesus was Jesus Christ the son of the Living God it is the one that had the keys to the kingdom in his hands now Peter means the Pedro significa means Rock significa Roca it means and stone means it's a confession now I want you to notice here okay now Peter had his sword not Jesus and with his confession with his Revelations sometimes that's us right we use our the word Loosely we use our Revelation a little Loosely and we begin to chop people to pieces my Revelation is my Revelation is I don't care who it hurts what a horrible attitude do not care what your Revelation does to a person so go over there and chop them two pieces what a horrible what a horrible condition to be in um what Jesus says Peter Pedro put your sword away put your sword away Peter what is Jesus about to do for Peter said Jesus por Pedro if we go back to our to our uh our pastor brother Calum back in October in the message God remembers and God forgets he says talking about malcus and Peter Pedro he says Jesus said put that away Jesus put the sword away you want to use the sword it's going to be used on you Jesus picks up the ear Jesus and justifies Peter who's defica Pedro remember that yeah everybody remember that and to me I was I was blown away when he said that is justifies Peter like if you have never done it we do sometimes we do something wrong oh Lord forgive me Lord Lord justify me Lord right see we do something wrong we offend somebody [Music] Lord forgive me Lord Lord justify me but in order for the Lord to justify Peter Pedro he had to restore melchized he had to restore the right ear restaurant man if you can follow me here and again melchiz is Kings and Priests which we are the Book of Revelations right he says they made us Kings and Priests now now look or Lucas as I said that all the gospels have a meaning significado Luke 22 50 Lucas ventilo cincuenta again he says he mentions the right year 51 it says that Jesus touched his ear now you ever you know I don't know if you've thought about this or not or known this is but for me I wondered why was it that that Luke is the only one that talks about the healing of of malcols it's the same story but there's only one that mentions the healing islamism and that is again every writer has a meaning significado and Luke was a doctor Lucas and therefore I can I can imagine Luke Luke being a doctor and do everything he can to be able to help or heal people he sees the scene of Jesus and without any kind of medications without any kind of stitches trees imagine that not even a scar so you can imagine how Blown Away Luke is Right Luke sees this and right away he starts begin one goes with Jesus put off the right ear of the servant of the priest oh but Jesus touched it and killed his ear again sometimes we do something that's wrong correct we come to the Altar and we cry Lord forgive me Lord justify me senor and we all want to be justified it's one of the steps right but in being justified the Lord comes to justify you know does he heal your brother to justify you does he heal your brother over here if he's healed and there's still a scar Cielos that's not a that's not a true justification because in Justified it's like if you never did it so there's not even a scarf healing and justification they go together now I went to the Greek word in the where it says touched it means to cling to is uh to attach one's self regards and they took me to the root word which means or which is and this this right here taught me by surprise okay the root word of the of the root word root meaning of the word touched means to to fasten fire to a thing to set on fire and spindle in sender En Fuego what what better way to to heal a person or what better way to set a person on fire in Fuego that when we've done something wrong to them if we're going to heal them we talk about a fire what a better way to do it than to do that now John again every writer has a meaning significado just checking my timer John he's the type of type of the Bride right one is John is also a type of a True Believer one is but he is also a type of love and again every writer has a meaning significant so why is it that John is the only one that mentions the name because it is only God's true love is I can call the name of the bride and there's only love that can do that he was assisting in the arrest of Jesus Jesus How could a person be touched by Jesus and be the same Persona brother Brandon brother Branham in the message what it takes to overcome all unbelief brother Jacob read this the other day but it's worth mentioning again now there is a time that a man can come to a place where he can have a purpose it's something that will change him and that is when a man meets God can never be the same if he ever meets God face to face it will change him in spite of anything you can do about it man can never be the same after he once meets God um I believe that malcus became a Believer and that's why John gives mentions a name imagine what what greater thing when Jesus comes and touches him Jesus now imagine we've all been hit in the air right did a lot of dumb stuff when I was younger I've definitely been hitting the Earth maybe that's my problem now right and [Music] uh John being a type of the Bride calling him by name again because only love can do such a thing now we're going to get that to the year here in a second now this miracle was the last miracle that Jesus did Jesus before he was crucified crucified what was it the restoration the reconciliation right here of the Kings and Priests Peter cut off with Peter with Peter with his sword he cut off the ear like but now here comes the sword Jesus himself he comes over here and restores it not only did he justify Peter Pedro He restored malcus's ability to be able to comprehend the word of God to comprehend El comprende we're going to get to that here in a second now what is the importance of the year you're shouting a lot you're starting too much brother doubting too much we all know that simply simple right one of the five senses of the body to be able to hear right right the little babies know that but what is the other purpose of the year there's another purpose through the year that is very important to the body for balance is without your ear without your equilibrium since now now you know has anybody ever had like vertigo I know brother Isaac right yeah has anyone ever had like you know issues maybe ear infections something like that where your ears just not there and you're you're out of it right you're out of here oh man you can't even think straight he said sometimes you can't even stand to your feet oh by the way I'm continuing with brother Danny and brother Abraham where do you stand the subtitle balance now now watch this science says that's the science okay you can you can go there you can look this up it says that the left here is tuned more for music is although we can hear uh voices and everything with our left here the main function of the of the left here is tuned for music and emotion is uh got us right here cut off right now right here is tuned for speech is and it amplifies and amplifies the speech amplification so does not the bible say that without faith that is impossible to please God and Faith commit by the hearing of the faith comments by hearing and the hearing by the word now again and being able to hear you can comprehend the definition of comprehend the definition to contain container or hold within a scope the significance or amount of something or significance to take in para tomorrow Embrace or to include or include as part of something bigger broader now this is the one that that gets me right here to grasp the meaning of or the significance significado of or the nature of something wow so Jesus restored his comprehension isn't that what Jesus does to us yes we hear the word of God we have faith the name of space now we can comprehend or grasp the nature of God embrace the nature of God here I'm going to be finishing here I don't know what time I got up here a couple more minutes I'm gonna end with this Brother Carlos I'm gonna get ready I'll remember to read this here it says to comprehend is to grasp something's complete nature or meaning is thus uh often a bit stronger than to understand for example for example you may understand the instructions in a handbook without completely comprehending its purpose so my mind goes to something how you know you ever got get like a toy or something for your kids furniture you got to put it together [Music] you have the instructions and you follow the instructions on how to be able to build your things but even there's certain pieces they're like is this for but I said I don't need it they're trying to put something together like I don't need this anymore like oh oh I I now I can comprehend like you know I needed that part and I'm going to be finishing with this Brother Carlos so he cut off melkus's ability to comprehend or to be able to hear or listen to the word of God why does it say hearing and the hearing by the word as I said a minute ago science says your left ear PL is uh tuned for music and tones the right ear process of the speech now it always seems like there's like a lot of it always seems like there's always something throwing up about the tape right so left here the mechanical Parts the mechanical Parts the magnetic tapes by hearing right now again this is this is science it's not this is in brother Ronnie or the message or nothing this is science but the right ear process processes and without one sinuno without the right ear I'm walking to brother Elijah Elijah without my right ear I have my focus on him I'm walking through brother Elijah but um restore the right ear put the left ear off restaurant now without the balance I have my side on the goal I have my site to get to the persona but without the year without the balance I might I'm trying to get over here because where do we stand how can we stand if we don't have a balance of both years never stop listening to the message of the hour the voice of God to us in these last days yes young people always listen to brother Brown don't ever stop that is how can we stand now if we're the spiritual body of the Lord Jesus Christ how can the spiritual body stand cut out listening to the message you can't do it how can the the spiritual body of the Lord Jesus Christ if you cut out the ministry the faithful ministers don't ever stop listening to this to the message don't stop listening to the to the the faithful Ministry both here both and you'll be balanced balenciado amen God bless you well tonight thank you brother Ron for that because man thank the Lord for his word tonight amen amen get my timer going here because I always get rolling and then and then I forget to pay attention uh but I do just kind of want to maybe talk a little bit tonight uh uh on on on the thought of of let every man examine himself and maybe piggybacking on something that some things that brother Ronnie said [Music] yes and and tonight forgive us but but I'm gonna I'm gonna pick on the Apostle Peter tonight we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna beat him up just a little bit but that's all right so what what Ronnie was talking about was was when when Peter cut off malcus is here right and this thought that I've had is something that the Lord's been working with me on over some time yes and and the thought is is that that you know we live in an age where like never before there's a lot of there's a lot of of sort of self-help kind of things yeah you know I don't know if you've noticed like there's a lot of motivational speakers and and things like that much oh yeah just self-help something like that right so so but but if you notice like a lot of the the self-help things they're they're there for every thing you want to be a better writer there's a book for that you want to be a better Barber there's a book for that you want to be a better painter there's a book for that you want to run faster right and and there's all these books that have all these answers and and there's even a line of books that that if maybe you're not really super intelligent okay it's called accounting for dummies is they have a whole series of stuff for dummies [Music] and and yet yet you see all this self-help stuff and at the end of the day you look out in the rest of the world and everybody who claims self-help is so unbelievably lost because they're lacking something right they're lacking this self-help book right this is the most important self-help book ever written but but what's so important about about this this thought process that that is that is rampant in the world right now is that often times it seems to stop at the doors of the church and what I mean by that is I want to take Peter Peter and and Paul and and maybe compare and contrast them a little bit you see the Apostle Peter Pedro he was a tremendous man the Apostle Peter he had the keys to the kingdom he he was side by side with Jesus he studied under the Lord Jesus Christ and Peter could very easily Peter could look outside of himself and and he could see maybe things going on in the church he says Peter saw the Lord Jesus Christ he was the only one who recognized him when Jesus said who do men say that I am Peter was the only one who could stand up and say thou art the Christ Peter didn't have a problem that the Gentiles didn't live like the Jews Peter didn't have an issue seeing Marcus Peter didn't have a problem seeing all these things that were happening outside of himself Peter when when Jesus came to Peter Jesus and Jesus said Peter Pedro Do You Love Me Mamas and and Peter said well Lord of yes I do and Jesus said feed my sheep Peter didn't have a problem seeing Jesus Jesus but I want you to notice that Jesus is constantly working with Peter for something Jesus is constantly trying to get Peter is to capture something that Peter just can't do you see Peter could recognize Jesus but what Peter had trouble doing was recognizing Peter's position in Jesus Peter had trouble recognizing Christ's position in Peter say that again Christ's position in Peter he could see everything outside of himself he could see the wars and the rumors of wars he could see all the issues going on in the church he could see all the different things that were happening around Jesus and around himself but when it came down to it and he had to stand up for Jesus why okay Peter could recognize Jesus the question wasn't do I know who Jesus is Jesus because Peter knew that Peter couldn't grasp Pedro the most important question of Peter's life who was Peter he knew who Jesus was Jesus but he couldn't recognize Peter a Pedro he got on Mount Transfiguration he said let's build a let's build a temple one for the three the one for the three or is it and then he struggled and we we know how he struggled there and he was constantly you see throughout Peter's life and he's struggling to find Peter Pedro and and on the on the flip side of Peter we we find Paul and Paul what what made Paul so tremendous what was that Paul understood something that Peter didn't foreign that there's a lesson there's an important thing that must happen in the life of every believer Paul understood it and Paul grasped it just like King David did and and what Paul I understood Paul understood that in in the life of a Believer the moment that religion enters the picture the life of a Believer the more the moment that that religious aspect enters into it the first thing that happens is the focus is immediately changes when Peter saw malcus the first thing that happened his Focus changed foreign and that's the thing that happens yes in the mind and in the heart of a lot of people it's our Focus begins to be changed our Focus becomes Out There Our Focus becomes our brother our Focus becomes our sisters our Focus becomes the issues of the church our Focus becomes what the pastor's doing or not doing our Focus becomes is the ministry right or not but I want you to notice something I want you to notice because the Bible the Bible tells us the Bible speaks to us and it gives us the the answer to the problem First Corinthians chapter 11. verse 28 if you turn with me foreign but let every man examine everyone and everything around him amen amen but let a man examine what's going on all around and what's happening but let a man examine what my neighbor's doing wrong but let a man examine where I've got it right and you've got it wrong no let him every man examine himself he said and you see that's what made Paul so tremendous is because Paul understood of examining himself you see Peter came to Paul and they had a showdown and Peter said you know those Gentiles that you're talking about they're dogs they're not worth you giving them this message they're not circumcised they don't follow the laws and Paul turns to Peter and he looks at Peter Pedro and all Paul can do is shake his head is [Music] can't comprehend and Paul goes into the book of Romans chapter seven oh and and Paul begins to dig deep and I imagine here in this chapter that Paul goes by himself somewhere because Paul has to examine himself he's gotta check himself and he begins to look at the law Empire and he says is the Lost sin they say he said I I didn't know sin you know except for the law and and and because of the law it brought out all these attributes I didn't even know were there so is the law of sinuses and then Paul catches himself and he says God forbid oh can you know because you can't live without the law because the law is what keeps the law is what keeps us it's like the bumpers you ever played bumper bowling right there's a big wide Lane in the middle line but the law is what keeps us out of the gutter they don't me he's just he's grinding at the Mill right now and then that as Paul begins to reflect interest reflection and he begins to look deep inside of himself he finds the two laws the law for the inward man the law for the outward man but notice in all of Paul's teachings Paul is looking inwardly his focus is inwardly always King David do this Psalms 139 and he says search me oh God no my heart I pray see if there be some Wicked way in me see Lord God if I'm missing it somewhere meet us in your seats and you can see King David after committing all of these sins that he had done and he begins to notice as he looks inside of himself and he sees his flaws then he writes the Psalms and he praises the Lord How I Love You Lord how I thank you but it's a different perspective as opposed to an outward Focus brother Branham makes the statement and he says the sickest body this is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ but I want you to notice something so tremendous is because when we say that the first thing that we think the sickest body is the body of the lord it's the first thing that happened but what if we flipped it and what have I said is he illegal the sickest body is this body of the Lord Jesus Christ right what if I flip that and I said my body is the sickest body this is and that's what we find Paul here yes First Corinthians chapter 15. and Paul here we always read the last bit of this scripture and we never read the whole scripture First Corinthians 15 and 31. and it reads like this the whole scripture Paul says I protest he opens it up with I protest by your rejoicing for La Gloria which I have in Christ Jesus our lord and and and we get and we focus on that last part and and we'll we'll get that last part and we'll say I remember the day that I died and it's tremendous right there's a there's a day that I die yesterday and my question to that is because we put it out a lot of times as though the day I died was the summation of all the Death where I go the summation of all the Death it was it was it was everything but Paul understood this Republic and he said no no no no no no no no no no no no ah no no I protest I protest your protest because every day if I'm doing this right day I'm examining myself and I'm discovering something new I have to die yes he said I protest you rejoicing because don't Rejoice because you think I'm tremendous the secret is simply this is each day I examine my life and each day when I find an attribute of myself that is against the word I then I take care of tomorrow and when Paul catches that he looks at that situation and he looks at that thought process and then we find brother Branham and brother Branham talks about the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and we are the body of the Lord and brother Branham says to live in Jesus Christ so we can't we all talk about wanting to live in Heavenly places according to the prophet of the age we've got to repentance and Die daily before antis before we can live in Heavenly places we can't even get there unless every day we're willing that's the problem with the microwave generation that's the problem with the Easy Bake Oven generation it says that's the problem with this generation is that nobody wants to do the hard stuff nobody wants to do the hard thing the easy thing it's for me to look at the brother I'd say oh I can see where he's missing it you know why I can see that because that's maybe one thing in my life I'm doing right because that's the easy thing is look at the brothers look at they're listening to the tapes oh yeah let's get on they're this or that or whatever the situation is that's the easy thing but the hard thing the hard thing is to examine myself because I have to look in the mirror of God's word and this mirror does not lie this mirror does not lie this mirror is the truth of the word and it will uncover you guys all of my junk but I gotta be man lady enough just stand in front of this mirror [Applause] and just let it tear me the shreds let it tear me up but that's the hard thing that's the difficult Road that's the higher way it's easy to point out each other's faults and flaws is it's easy to look at all the things going on in the world and go oh that's such a terrible thing is it's easy to see maybe somebody doesn't get healed or receive something and the first question we ask is what's going on in the church but that's not the question we should be asking the question we should be asking is where am I where am I planted have I examined my life in the world did I die to something I discovered today have I repented and I made things right am I living right because if we spend more time doing that foreign to look outside of ourselves if we make ourselves that piece of the temple temple and that peace is so perfect yes that not even a razor blade can fit in between that if God be for us if God be for me he uses the comigo then where are all my miracles you have to repent and Die daily let a man examine himself let us examine ourselves on a daily basis Moment by momento an hour is too long to let it go two hours is too long to let it go every minute of every day the Bible says you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars my question is why do we care why do we care what happens in politics important why do we care what happens in the stock market oh there's a recession coming why do I care [Music] because if I've examined myself or because then every promise in this book it don't matter how long it takes to get here it don't matter what hell I gotta pass through no important because every promise in this book
