little report with the opportunity that he's given me to fulfill a desire in my heart to know and to see the mountain with it was written the william brangham the name of reset william branham and the three stages of his ministry yellowstone park biblical sign for the cleansing of the earth for the millennium olympia that the volcano will cleanse but don't don't worry it's not now but it's best to line up and and to straight up because then we'll be affected by that we must be in then we we went to the place where in the map where he shows the position montana you can see that on the west side you can see the profile of the prophet looking down towards california is on the but in the lower part of his face that's where that mountain range is it says now that kind of spooks people it's almost fanaticos the word fanatics and jumps and dances because he likes it wouldn't you like to go to the glory of god don't wait for it up there yeah yes he has descended many are waiting for the glory of god when the glory of god is already here all that was in heaven uh and years do bring very wonderful things yes and experience it's a little individual it is an individual that is marked by the years that's what the old timers would say but the house of prayer is here there's people that don't like to go to church is when someone is afraid of something it's because you owe something if i don't know why would i worry but when you know that there is prince against you you're trying to jump around so they don't catch your prince it is a pleasure to be with you [Applause] by [Applause] and we want to speak a little bit today about the day that we live in while the events jesus said me and my father but jesus has not said that you are his there are things that are near that goes our common distance oh there's things that bring us closer to the things that bring us apart to the same journey of faith so it is necessary problem says to know the day and the hour that we're living in in god's time is revealed to the bride foreign by the prophet of god and if you have a petition in your soul that you are inviting us to your house this morning to give us the well-being and the eternal security okay where there is a joy in the heart of the believers [Music] bring us to your in the book of matthew finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might vestigo de toda put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wilds of the devil contrast for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world and spiritual weakness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand hold on again the devil taken him up into exceedingly high mountain and showed of him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and he saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou will fall down and worship me there's a little too much they don't know but he didn't know the answer had for him one of the things that catches my attention is that a certain word is used too much system and i ask do people know what a system is what system are you in why do you look for a system what does the system mean means i have a system politico politico religious economic economic or financial importance and jesus as you said i don't care about the system or my system is not of this world so many originally they said brother where are you going to go to school for i'm going to go learn our system should learn how to lie do you know that god has a computer called william branham and what you put there he comes up what you search for to get accustomed to the system of a prophet the system of a pastor the system of the holy spirit it's not easy because that system does not agree with your system for the system of god it's not of this world of satan does that the subject that i want to speak on but world is a system a matter is is related within itself so any movement anything is to be intertwined also means a compilation of things that related within themselves are they not i mean orderly he wanted the first thing that he looked for was allies because a system does not work without allies nothing can move the first thing the saint wanted to do was to find alliances with the most important that god had miguel which was michael then a prophet is the mind of christ and a pastor is the mind and the church is the mind of his pastor so when someone says the prophet me no your pastor will present you prophet said the order is that the the messenger and christ presents them to the father he says this you gave me and no one ever was lost because the system of god now didn't permit okay that nothing will come out but that will go from here that's what he needed because they have a lot of allies what's happening right now with the world the g20 organization because you have enough water at home and you have enough with that oh and then we write where we wrote that and those that are around a pastor if they're not born again they're the worst politicians the ones that change that give opinions [Music] there is an assembly to to fix the damage it and after the heat goes through then you're in worse condition but if you eat slow you're still gonna look enough whether you eat at home or in a restaurant you pay more in the restaurant that's why i like to eat at home because it's cheaper a different future than the one you have in your in your brain take that trash out and show you reality that was shown to us by a prophet the world is a tangle and the devil dances and you end up drunk in hell [Music] if you say something that makes sense you know where you're going the greatest mystery i have discovered that's why when jesus knew who he was because he jesus came and suffered until he learned who he was then he fulfilled his purpose when you discover who you are you also fulfill your purpose there are people with purpose with our goals el zero is satan and discernment wrapped money and poverty on a serpent so the world is is a system that is moved by the police but the religious the economic and financial dominion call the cosmos dominato so this world is dominating you are in one of those three the church [Applause] because you without money you don't even get robbed because the ones that are wrong they know who has it where they where they where they put their money and the one that has it is always worried that somebody's going to take it from him that's why god calls he called us out of this system and he took us to heavenly places in christ jesus our lord and he said let's become partners what matthew 4 how many know that satan is actually friendly because the people don't know you're walking uh with him just holding him by his arms m keep talking no no there's three attacks fuertes god why your son that did this this and that and and the parents said well he told me he didn't do it is that the children has become more shrewd than you that are el diablo [Music] not in what he has to do the first thing you have to do is place your house in order so it works if it doesn't work then there's someone to blame because the the boss is is worried because she doesn't it doesn't know if it's in the home or but all those lower time for the family there is no time for family video how to make money money money to go and buy dumb stuff so you can't have you have to go my daughter and my wife they go look around and i go somewhere else so they pick one because you see all these trash that people get tangled up with los angeles now the years teaches i remember my parents now that when you think at all today they don't even stay for their haircut because they leave this long hair sticking out here this way is well i guess if he has extra hairs because he needs it this type of preacher i like to hit the wood so it'll cure control says the devil controls all world systems get control of his but this political religion and this this uh two-point tongue control the devil controls all world systems and the nations he controls him until until god sets his kingdom he got my attention the god doesn't interfere or gets in any of satan's systems he has to take your problem because he programmed me to cry out to me and i will answer it he said to let loose of that system but i don't want you seeing me i need the baptism of the holy spirit the systems of satan amen to run to the front what can i do so why is there not a change you don't come repented it just became a accustom orlando oh of how you came in through those doors messed their hair up and they live worse repentance is to be honest with yourself you know your condition and say lord here i am and burden having heavy laden and i will give you rest when you have the holy spirit that you are not preoccupied of your eternal life colombia in europe europe in canada in canada el diablo universal he is universal el nacional many people think there's gonna be way out there somewhere god's gonna do tremendous things you are working for satan drink or or or or smoke or i didn't go out with older or younger women i was always studying a day i had an experience at times he will test his students in the office where we work when i got there to the podium my titans officina then the magistrate was and the students were here in the four years and i was praying and reading the message no i don't remember only god knows what happened i looking at they told them what they saw and they said this man is convinced of what he believes and he was a denominational preacher and he said i know you believe in william branham and he said and what if he no seriously bill's in about 77 wouldn't he be a false prophet and i said neither he is a false prophet or neither will this fail he was predicting events not the coming of jesus that's right the reason why i want to talk to you is because you are are truly a servant of god and i asked him how do you know this he said because this morning when you came out of the elevator and you went on the hallway to your office was following you through the hallway [Applause] and he said no don't don't get all swollen up in your shirt here with what i'm going to tell you but that helped me to be more humble from that day many more experiences that i had is in the world and the nations until god sets his kingdom the most sublime thing is this message is the seal of the kingdom of god diablo so the devil no puerto rico [Music] so how many are now in the kingdom no not in the kingdom of god but it isn't the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of god and he doesn't share that with nobody if you do an upright job i work in one of the most corrupt uh judicial systems 48 years ago to release a drug dealer was worth 500 million pesos at that time dollar was 200 pesos now it's about 4 000 pesos so at that time was a lot of money one sentence just to give him room to escape the country and to see a lot of unrighteousness so the kingdom of satan is politics religion e echo because the lord says here that are co dressed with the code of righteousness [Music] which is doing what is right they used to call me and i could be in and i have to say well i'm sorry but i cannot and the president was part of the uncovered for them and then he offered this office where a lot of money comes in he offered this position to my boss if you love me you don't take this offer and give this to somebody he went and talked to his wife but my assistant told me this and the wife said do what he you know if you don't want to end up in jail or dead so i know what moves within that system as the god of this perverse age and sweden in his eating domina he dominates conestas especially with this specialties if you want to be a doctor especially you have to do certain specialties specialists is not just to examine everything but only those things that he becomes becomes because it's all you they are dumber than we are and they were right in the garage instead of becoming psychologists they became they became ecologists i finished with this i have a lot to say just changed my style of preaching because he has a dominion and he has a structure to handle this the dominion was staying with his politics the first thing he uses is politics for assad and politics is to disguise the truth with the lie have you ever gone to to to place the custom parties or someone [Music] who who's their own question takes the mask off and you know it's such and such son el domino he doesn't present himself less than what he wants to be as a but here is as the lord orders he said get rid of that because no you're going to die if you remember the story of neyman the the queen with neyman us with this message we're going to hang saying because i would like to see him hang him and see that how he's sticking that tongue out don't you want to see that the person is so nervous to to to be try to find the what's known as the queen and they don't find it so what they they they plant and where there's the outdoors everything can be in favor or wasn't that what satan do he didn't deceive her but she put her in and took her to the deceit we as pastors shepherds themselves not of gossipers [Applause] [Applause] and forgive me i wasn't going to go in there but i'm talking about politics oh tell me if it's not politics i talked to about the five years he didn't tell me what i want i want and if the other minister who tells him the same thing then they said i'm going to look for another church satan's eating is full of churches that offer the holy spirit but this message is the truth and he offers eternal life with all the wishy-washy here do you know where you go when you said you go to church brother branham said this is your your judgment uh tribunal for your eternal distress there's a call today two or three come usually the same and the other ones oh they're not right now but the first thing that parents think of their children is not to be born again but to you're going to go to you're going to study i want you to see a doctor to be able to they won't have a specialist class make it a little easier so i said well what do you become a specialist if you're doing the same thing so what they really need is just to pick up dummies because the universities but first confess your sin and you you'll be healed you don't need specialists for that no but sincerity they don't go to church because their children have to go to school because whatever she learned at the beginning 60 years later she doesn't remember where it was learn to live with what god gives us and i've been telling you this for a while but i'll finish with this education just the even the teacher had to go birth put it because he didn't have enough to buy shoes but they all taught us more respect honor now go see if you find that in school today we came out better educated and with better diplomacy because the the the best uh uh certificate is your life not a paper hanging on the wall many times you get professions to be specialized in something hospitality take a nurse that's been working for 20 years and they will know more about the dead and living [Music] and and if someone uh dies a patient dies or to on a nurse he did something else and he killed them the person says i need someone that speaks to me more theologically only the true experience with god will give you a change in your life what the scripture says wants to make you a scientist investigator search god see if he exists yes it's the gospel of a farmer that i learned of brother william branham scientific scientist he has activated specialization and the scientists they want to become the the doctor in your town will charge you ten dollars now that he took another class now he charges 50. he becomes a specialist of something else said how much did it cost you just to boil some water and put this little earth scientist scientific that's why everything is unique and a scientist goes so high up that he loses his behavior [Music] forgot the principles what happens if you talk to me too loud i'm going to sue you [Music] in the run to the pastor i said only have one advice of the word of god or respect anymore now what closes the cycle is corruption oh yes it's the time of corruption like never before if you borrow something don't forget brothers that i've loaned you this money but at this percentage and they take advantage of the needs of others they ask him a favor nothing i don't have if i ask for a favor because i know you have [Music] like that las comades they will stick with them until seeing them stand up from that bed and the father is exposed to my husband would stay you're still in intensive care i'm gonna pray for you now and corruption god bless you brother and the values of the word of god wasting time but i'm not advancing but if you have removed these things this morning i desire lord that you love me and see my desire to do what's up right that's correct many things hurt us settlement and to settle the accounts to their rights this morning surrender in the alternative world that you would examine that you proved olympia and clinton bless you and if i got an opportunity in the future i'll bring another colombian way to you [Music] hey man i'm gonna ask sister virginia if if she would come she asked for prayer i'm
