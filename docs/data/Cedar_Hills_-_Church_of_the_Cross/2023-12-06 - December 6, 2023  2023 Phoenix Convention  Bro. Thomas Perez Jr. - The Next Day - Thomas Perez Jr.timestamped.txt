[24:00] same
[24:04] yesterday do you believe
[24:07] that and I want to give you a word of
[24:09] encouragement
[24:11] today and if I could tell you what would
[24:14] it
[24:16] be it would be
[24:18] simply the next
[24:22] day tell your
[24:24] neighbor look at your neighbor and tell
[24:26] them the next day
[24:35] now maybe give him a high five if you
[24:37] want
[24:46] to tell your neighbor again the next
[24:53] day
[24:55] hallu Hallelujah might have been a day
[24:59] just like
[25:02] today but it was the next
[25:05] day the day before they were
[25:09] working Elijah was
[25:14] baptizing you said uh who was Elijah
[25:17] well that was John the
[25:20] Baptist it was baptizing the day
[25:25] before but this was the next day
[25:29] now we've all received the message of
[25:31] the
[25:33] hour we all know that brother
[25:36] brand is the seventh
[25:39] messenger there ain't no one after
[25:43] him God had 1 2 3 4 5 six seven
[25:48] stars and he was the last
[25:50] one what he spoke to us
[25:54] about he spoke to us about a day
[25:58] even the Bible tells
[26:00] us but in the days of the voice of the
[26:05] seventh angel so we're talking about
[26:08] days
[26:10] now and one day speaks to another
[26:16] day day one
[26:21] day voice to another day one day speaks
[26:25] about the next day
[26:28] now I want to talk to you about the next
[26:32] day now we we've all have uh have uh
[26:36] have lived in a
[26:38] time that that we all have
[26:47] problems even if you don't and it's not
[26:50] going to be very deep today so you don't
[26:52] you don't have to to to to you can you
[26:55] can you can go on YouTube again and hear
[26:57] the
[26:59] message it's not going to it's not going
[27:01] to take you out and you're don't don't
[27:03] don't write don't but don't miss if you
[27:04] want to write write but don't
[27:07] miss because I want you to get the
[27:09] essence of the
[27:12] message now I want you to understand
[27:14] what brother
[27:17] Bram and he says when the day that John
[27:21] baptized
[27:24] Jesus the lamb John
[27:28] said there comes the meekness of
[27:33] God Behold the Lamb of
[27:36] God that take it that takes away the sin
[27:40] of the
[27:41] world and when John baptized
[27:45] him he went out of the
[27:48] water God the holy
[27:51] spirit in the form of a
[27:54] dove come down on him and abod in
[27:59] him amen amen abod in
[28:03] him that was the greatest
[28:08] event this world has ever
[28:13] seen and we'll
[28:18] see
[28:25] until I'm going to say it again
[28:29] that was the greatest
[28:31] event that this world has ever
[28:35] seen
[28:38] [Applause]
[28:40] until did I get off on the wrong
[28:44] exit
[28:46] until Christ and his
[28:49] church United
[28:56] together yeah this is what what what's
[28:59] wrong in the Simplicity of the
[29:04] Gospel there's nothing wrong with the
[29:07] gospel it's the understanding of
[29:11] it we always
[29:13] believe that something's
[29:17] coming and that's all right let it come
[29:21] until you until it meets
[29:24] you but one day the word meets the
[29:27] prophet in the middle of the
[29:32] water now now when he
[29:35] does I want you to
[29:37] know the attraction was always on the
[29:42] prophet
[29:44] 712
[29:46] years a virgin shall
[29:49] conceive a virgin shall
[29:52] conceive and 712 years
[29:56] later
[29:58] a virgin and her espouse to
[30:02] be had just come back from
[30:06] church or from the
[30:09] synagogue and when
[30:12] Mary and Joseph sit
[30:15] down they started
[30:17] reading behold the Virgin shall
[30:21] conceive Mary looks at
[30:25] Joseph and says could that be
[30:31] us God will have a
[30:33] bride could that be
[30:41] me there cannot be until there is the
[30:44] next
[30:47] day and brother says
[30:50] this then the
[30:53] attraction changed from the
[30:55] prophet to his
[31:00] [Music]
[31:05] prophecy brother Bram says
[31:08] this the
[31:10] attraction changed from the prophet to
[31:13] his
[31:16] prophecy
[31:17] okay but it happens the next
[31:22] day sometimes we want to believe what we
[31:26] believe
[31:27] and that's all right but you got to let
[31:30] the next day come
[31:35] forward every major
[31:38] prophet went
[31:41] down thinking my prophecy didn't come to
[31:47] pass can you imagine 712
[31:52] years I love what my our Pastor
[31:56] said
[31:57] 3500 years
[32:01] later the Jews hold on to their Prophet
[32:09] Moses 50 years later we don't even know
[32:12] if brother Brandon was our
[32:17] Prophet can you imagine 712
[32:21] years must be off his
[32:26] rocker but one
[32:28] day the word of
[32:31] God the word that God
[32:34] thought was expressed through the mouth
[32:36] of the
[32:38] Prophet came to
[32:40] pass now in our day we didn't receive
[32:44] just any
[32:46] word brother Bernie used to say like
[32:49] this brother ber would say like
[32:56] this in the mind the part behind part of
[32:59] the mind
[33:00] of God Tau
[33:03] it brother is
[33:06] spoken
[33:07] now what did he speak
[33:10] about he spoke about the next
[33:17] [Applause]
[33:18] day you are people of
[33:22] rapture you are people of
[33:25] restoration you are people of the
[33:29] Resurrection you are the
[33:32] Temple of the Dynamics of
[33:40] God but it happens the next
[33:45] day well I'm going to believe yes Keep
[33:48] On
[33:50] Believing until your day comes
[33:53] around
[33:55] now I want to do do this for
[33:58] you and I hope that you are with
[34:02] me I know you
[34:07] are there is
[34:10] uh there there is a a type of
[34:15] horse and it's the Belgian draft
[34:22] horse this Belgian draft course is the
[34:29] can pull 8,000 lb by
[34:38] himself if you got two
[34:42] together how many could they
[34:46] pull you would say as I would
[34:54] said, but if take that same Belgian
[34:58] draft
[35:00] horse and you pair him up with another
[35:04] Belgian
[35:08] horse again you say
[35:12] 16,000 but if they've been raised
[35:16] together and they've trained
[35:19] together and they've learned how to pull
[35:23] together one can haul 8,000
[35:28] pound two 16
[35:32] 32,000
[35:37] lb no wonder when the scripture says
[35:41] this one can put 1,000 to
[35:46] flight but
[35:51] two but two 10,000 to
[35:55] flight the mathematics of God's
[36:01] word now if you want to go
[36:05] fast go by
[36:08] yourself go by
[36:10] yourself if you want to go
[36:17] far you got to go
[36:21] together we have seen the miraculous of
[36:25] God we have seen God In
[36:29] Action now now I got to say
[36:34] this we we we by the grace of
[36:39] God we went to a country this year
[36:42] called
[36:45] Poland there was a few people there
[36:48] maybe about 70
[36:51] people you know of of the countries that
[36:54] we have
[36:55] visited Africa is crazy Africa
[37:02] ISC to worship God nobody even come
[37:08] close I I I love seeing Sister Sister
[37:11] Lizzy with her baby there in front and
[37:13] she was dancing and help do that's the
[37:15] way they do it over
[37:17] there you know why they don't have cell
[37:22] phones they don't have
[37:24] iPhones iones don't have i i
[37:28] tablets they don't have the big old
[37:30] screen
[37:33] TV most people worship God the way they
[37:37] have a
[37:41] TV right you ever seen this people have
[37:44] a small TV they do
[37:47] this they get a little bit bigger and
[37:49] they do
[37:50] this and a little bit more you can tell
[37:53] who's got a big screen at home because
[37:55] like
[38:00] right and we our worship is the
[38:05] same God did a little bit for
[38:09] me it is so sad I I pray for our worship
[38:13] leaders all the time always say somebody
[38:17] raise their hands somebody say
[38:20] glory and and and you won't
[38:24] understand until it's the next day
[38:31] you won't raise up your hands until God
[38:38] something there's always a crisis at
[38:42] home there's always a reason not to
[38:44] Worship the
[38:46] Lord I got Co I didn't get
[38:51] Co I'm sick I'm not sick I got money got
[38:56] a lot of money there's always a crisis

[39:04] have a word for
[39:11] crisis they don't teach
[39:14] crisis they don't teach their people
[39:18] crisis they don't even have a word to
[39:21] describe what a crisis could
[39:24] be the closest
[39:27] word that they use to us in the English
[39:32] language is
[39:40] opportunity
[39:41] again this is the next
[39:45] day
[39:46] opportunity OPP opportunity is
[39:51] tremendous there's a problem in my
[39:54] house there's a problem in my
[39:58] church There's an
[40:06] opportunity Israel is in a crisis isra

[40:29] church and you bring it inside your
[40:32] body and then you try to Worship the
[40:36] Lord but it's in the day
[40:43] before the Middle East is on
[40:47] fire
[40:49] church and I'm talking about all of
[40:52] Malachi

[41:04] mirror one day I
[41:06] believe one day I think I'll go to
[41:09] church the next day I don't know one day
[41:13] I believe God sent a
[41:15] prophet the next day I don't know but if
[41:18] there ever comes a next day to your
[41:23] life you will understand that in that
[41:28] day the Lamb of God shows
[41:31] up and he takes away the sin of the
[41:39] world the next
[41:41] day tell your neighbor the next
[41:46] day yell it to him if you

[46:29] do they're waiting on you and
[46:32] I because they without you cannot be
[46:37] made
[46:41] perfect because they've always they've
[46:44] always
[46:47] desired the next
[46:54] day
[46:58] so the brother writes
[47:01] me
[47:03] yesterday
[47:05] says he said while you were preaching
[47:07] the other
[47:09] day and this all honor goes to the Lord
[47:12] Jesus
[47:13] chist but he said you were preaching the
[47:15] other day you prophesied that there was
[47:18] two people that that had breathing
[47:24] problems
[47:26] he says one raised
[47:30] up one raised up and you still said in
[47:35] so many words
[47:37] said both of you are
[47:40] he and I did not know who you were
[47:42] talking
[47:43] about until a few weeks
[47:47] back and I said I had sleep
[47:52] at and I could not
[47:54] breathe and I found out that I was the
[47:56] second
[47:59] person now now you might not you might
[48:01] not get anything right
[48:03] now and you might feel sorry for
[48:06] yourself and say oh nobody's been as bad
[48:09] as me nobody has gone through where I've
[48:12] gone
[48:14] through you either transform your
[48:18] pain or you will transmit your
[48:24] pain
[48:28] you might say nobody has ever felt like
[48:31] this
[48:33] before don't feel
[48:39] privileged the book of Hebrews
[48:42] said they were
[48:44] stoned they were son
[48:46] us they were
[48:49] son they
[48:51] were they were
[48:54] despised of whom the world was not
[48:56] worthy of them they wandered
[49:01] about in sheep
[49:04] skins in caves looking for what they
[49:09] were looking for the next
[49:16] day again they were looking for the next
[49:20] day because in the next
[49:23] day the sacri
[49:27] the symbol was going to be
[49:30] finished and the
[49:32] reality was going to come to the
[49:40] Forefront in the old
[49:42] times they sacrificed the
[49:53] offerings the one showed up
[50:02] many people says that Jesus was our
[50:09] lamb
[50:11] that's but that's not all the
[50:14] truth Jesus was God's
[50:22] lamb Jesus was God's lamb
[50:27] what he had to do to settle the sin
[50:33] question that was his
[50:40] L we don't have not paid the
[50:44] price the maximum
[50:47] price for what calvary or what the world
[50:51] needed but we
[50:53] also to pray a
[50:56] price to bring
[50:59] Redemption to God's
[51:01] people
[51:03] now I want I I want to I want to do this
[51:05] real
[51:06] quick
[51:08] now in the 20th
[51:11] chapter of the book of St
[51:14] John the Bible speaks to
[51:18] us this was the resurrection of
[51:22] Jesus when they had buried Jesus
[51:27] the Bible
[51:28] says that they put a
[51:31] napkin on his face and buried
[51:36] him but when you go to the seventh
[51:41] verse when they look into the
[51:45] tomb they see the
[51:50] napkin and now it was neatly
[51:54] folded
[51:58] and
[51:59] placed in a place by
[52:05] itself now hold on to your
[52:08] seats hold on put your seat belts
[52:11] on or un unbuckle them whatever you
[52:19] want in Jewish
[52:23] tradition when the master of the
[52:26] house was finished with his
[52:30] food he would do this and he throw it to
[52:33] the side and the
[52:36] servant he knew when he had it was
[52:40] wrinkled and thrown to the
[52:44] side that he was done you can pick up
[52:47] the plate and go wash
[52:49] it but in the
[52:52] Jesus when he goes and he raises up from
[52:56] amongst the
[52:58] dead he takes off this
[53:01] Veil he takes off this
[53:04] napkin and he folds
[53:06] it because in the Jewish
[53:09] tradition when the master would fold his
[53:15] napkin it meant
[53:17] this I'm
[53:21] not I'll be back very
[53:24] soon
[53:25] I don't know what your condition is this
[53:28] morning but I believe that Jesus is not
[53:31] done yet I'll be back very
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:45] soon they should have killed us when
[53:47] they had the
[53:53] chance because he not done
[54:00] yet this is the
[54:08] [Applause]
[54:18] next I challenged a man one
[54:21] day I challenged a man by radio and he
[54:24] said this
[54:26] brother brandham he said died a
[54:30] drunker and I called him up not on my
[54:37] watch it's time for malakiah 45 to stand
[54:40] up and believe what they said they
[54:43] believe and if you have not had a next
[54:45] day experience today is your
[54:51] [Applause]
[54:53] day I said sir
[54:56] brother brandham did not die a
[54:58] drunker he was killed by a drunk
[55:04] driver he said well you know people
[55:06] think that you that you guys are a cult
[55:08] or
[55:11] heresy come on sir we're Heretics to
[55:15] somebody the is Islamic people think
[55:18] we're
[55:19] Heretics the Jews think were
[55:21] Heretics I told them but you know what
[55:24] sir anytime anywhere any

[55:59] experience anybody without the Holy
[56:01] Ghost is an insane

[56:08] experience the next
[56:13] day well needless to say the man hasn't
[56:16] called
[56:20] me Jesus knew nothing about the seven
[56:24] four glory of
[56:29] God while he was
[56:35] here because everything was going to
[56:38] come in the
[56:43] folds in the
[56:45] revelation of how he had folded
[56:49] it for seven Church
[56:53] ages and each one
[56:56] got their
[56:58] revelation of what was in the
[57:02] fold how is it I knew nothing about the
[57:05] Seven Seals the prophet of God
[57:09] says but each each day an angel would
[57:15] open up a
[57:18] [Music]
[57:21] fold he would open up his
[57:23] heart
[57:25] when you hear Brother Bernie's
[57:31] messages when you see yourself in the
[57:34] mirror you are his
[57:37] heart you are his message you are the
[57:41] revelation God has set in this
[57:49] place the
[57:51] word went away and he said this
[57:55] but yet a little while in the world
[57:59] more but
[58:03] you look at your
[58:05] neighbor don't look at him with the eyes
[58:07] of
