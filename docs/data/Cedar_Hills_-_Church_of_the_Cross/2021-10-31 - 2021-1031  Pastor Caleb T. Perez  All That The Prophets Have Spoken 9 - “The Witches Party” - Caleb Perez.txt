are the way [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] god [Music] you say [Music] you say it is [Music] [Applause] genesis 1 26 i'll pick it up wednesday when god made man before he made man he called himself l-e-l-l-e-l-h-l-o elohim the word means in the hebrew the self exists all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence he ever was self-existence one elohim means all sufficient all-powerful almighty self-existence one ah but in genesis 2 when he made man he said i am y-a-h-u-j-u-v-u-h yahuwah jehovah what did it mean i am the all existence one who has created something all for myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur [Music] why he gave man jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur god because he is father god and he made a man an amateur god so he isn't self existence anymore he exists with his family [Music] now now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family now god made man to be the predominant over all the earth he had dominion and the earth was man's dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was god over the earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and he would be soul there he is god jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him amen there you are hallelujah all right brother neville you got first peter 120 but read 119 and 120. but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you when was he for ordained before the foundation of the world brother pat read revelation 17 8 for me these that thou shalt [Music] shall sin now and go into tradition they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world who's going to be deceived who's going to be received by this religious person like saul [Music] that was just so cunning and so perfect to it would deceive the white very e if if possible all right redwater says 13 8 let me read it for you and all that dwell upon the earth shall all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names were not written in the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world [Music] when was our names put in the lamb's book of life when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world when god was jehovah l eli elohim the self-existence one just like one great big diamond and he could not be nothing else but inside of this diamond his attributes was a savior amen in this attributes on the inside of him was a healer [Music] saving nothing to heal [Music] but his attributes produced it election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks the destiny don't forget that that election looks back here here it is but all of a sudden i become a wheat grain how did it happen uh that what is that election god before the foundation of the world elected that the cockaburr was to become a grain of wheat now i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm saved how do i do it now let's read just a little farther and then we'll have to close pretty sharp according as he chose us and him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what did he do he by ford knowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a savior self-existence but in him was a savior well what's he going to say there's nothing lost knowing that that he know that this great attribute in him would project something out under that he could save then when he did that by four knowledge he looked down and he saw everyone that would accept it and while he did that he did that that he might save you who wants to be saved do you see what i mean by for knowledge amen the infinite god who wrote all things saw the lamb and he slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world and he put your name on the lamb's book of life and he seen the deceitfulness of satan what he would do so he put your name on there by election he chose them and by predestination they know where they are go in amen now who could doubt that that's what paul said that's paul's scripture that's paul's writing that's what he taught his church the church position before the foundation of the world when god and his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body amen to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to beat this or to be there and then on next sunday morning we're going into the position placing the church positionally placing the church where they belong each one how we're called by the adoption god has adopted us

thankful to the lord for that it is certainly privileged to have you online as you can see this morning we are all that the prophets have spoken number nine and i got this from my our founding pastor how many of you remember if you were there if not how many of you have ever heard his message on the witch's party it's a good day to preach the witches party as the world celebrates this day this as we know as halloween halloween or also known as the day of the witches right but we don't celebrate halloween we celebrate something greater that is that a didn't have to stay in this condition that we are born into the condition move on to a greater and higher life i heard an ex-witch say this october 31st is as important as easter and christmas is to a christian estan important christian this is this is what they said even if it's just for one day a year amen we've been reading this scripture luke 24 25. you have it you can say amen we'll wait for you yes i would rather you slip your bibles open those that sing a special also wonderful we sure love to uh we sure love to hear the gifts that god has placed in the church have [Music] [Applause] amen it reads like this then he said unto them oh fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken may god add his blessings to the ring of his word you may be seated amen i want you to keep this in mind as we enter into the message this morning that i think we all should know this that the witch is one who is impersonating a real true prophet of you god this message i'm going to say it again because i want you to if you have to write that down is one who is impersonating a real true prophet of god then if the witch is the impersonator why is it easier to believe them than the prophets that they are impersonating why is it easier to believe an impersonator than the real thing one person in person if you can notice what the lord jesus is telling them oh fools and slow of hearts you believe all that the prophets have spoken fools is one that is unintelligent it is one who doesn't comprehend perceive or understand i want you to notice that paul in the writing to the galatians he uses the same exact word that jesus used in luke 24. and lucas amen let's go to galatians the third chapter once again paul is using this exact same word when it comes to fools and paul starts off and says all foolish galatians i don't know about you but i do not want to be included when it says fools i don't want to be a foolish virgin i want to be a wise virgin so whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you and what he's telling us here ilocano is the foolish part was that they let themselves be bewitched when you look at the word bewitched and the word malign means as an adjective it means evil in nature or effect but as a verb it means to speak about someone in a spitefully critical manner that's why he's saying all foolish galatians who does this bewitched in a critical manner i want to know is there anyone here that is guilty of that you don't have to raise your hand but have we have we ever been critical about someone uh i want you to get this because it's very important we wanted to we want to overcome that how many want to be better than what you are today and brother he is asking the people to pray for him he said because i have become very critical about people and i don't know how many this morning can be that that have that much humility when i look at this and i realize what paul is telling the galatians and by doing so they were falsely representing the gospel i want to tell you this morning as the holy spirit teaches us and leads us whether they go to church here or whether they don't yes but when they are critical about the church critical about the ministry critical about the brothers and sisters be careful because you're about to get bewitched come on now this is what is known as the witch's party right now you're with me we've got to be careful what we permit a spell on you what's paul's telling them you know because because in our minds many times the only thing we know about witches is a woman with a pointed nose around the cauldron but it spells on people that's about all we know let me tell you i'm going to say the same thing that brother branham said doesn't come in horns and a pitchfork neither do animals come like that they can come in a different form a more subtle when jesus you permit yourself to be bewitched i'm going to say it again anytime the gospel is not properly represented there is a bewitching going on and when we say we are christians [Music] please i'm going to tell you if you want to get that message you let us know and we'll get it for you notice what is going on with the galatians paul started the church in galatia during his first missionary trip long after he started it there was a group of judaizers which were a faction of the jewish christians that began to teach these new converts to christians that the mosaic laws of the old testament that they were still binding on all christians now that might not sound like something so bad huh that i'm trying to take you from one system to another system but instead you're wanting to go back to the old system instead of going forward in the news system i am taking the law was simply they were trying to perfect themselves under the flesh perfection the law could not perfect us paul is telling them i'll show you a more excellent way we are no longer under the you'll see where we're going here in a moment they've they told them that they were still bound to the mosaic law what they were doing was falsely representing the gospel preach to you today how many of you have received the holy ghost and he's asking them receive thee the holy ghost by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith how did you receive the spirit come on are you so foolish that you being you have begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh a time here you started in the spirit and now you want to go back to an old covenant system i'm trying to live the lord is it not the same thing today we've come out of egypt we've come out our denomination out of a certain lifestyle we've come out of a certain system and after so many years we want to go back come on check yourselves this morning why do we even look back want you to get this church you gotta you gotta get there come with me this morning watch this now people come out of a system but the system never comes out of them think about this now we can leave wherever we were at but what is in already inside of us continues to bewitch us there is more bewitching that goes on in a church than most people even even know there's more witchcraft in a church [Music] come on now we're going somewhere this morning you're going to go along with me all right you got to put your thoughts to one side we're going on a trip this morning now watch this as they continue as we continue to go forward parents are constantly trying to undermine the very foundation of the church of apostles and prophets jesus christ being the chief cornerstone ministry i undermine the validity of the word and undermine each other why did they put this one to preach and not me i mean come on you know what i'm talking about orlando that's right hello why does this one get to sungleed more than me and why is this one put put to interpret instead of going to where you need to oh to whom you need to speak adidas [Music] and it ain't nobody's business if he decides to do that it's on if you were up here and you could feel the you could feel the spirits coming in that's enough go to the next thing is we must do things the right way what they say is i i just don't like the system in the church that's what the judies these judaizers were getting the galatians to believe that the new system of the new covenant of grace that the holy spirit through paul was implementing was not good enough on its own put a system now there's many churches all right wait till you hear that message of our founding pastor it is but not everybody can go through samuel which is the prophet what system are you going through system have you implemented in your life this system implements everybody has a system in their life let's find out where we're at how many want to find out where we're at be careful when you look at this be careful that because you don't want to give an account to god for for bewitching someone said you have an issue about something talk to me absolutely absolutely this is not a dictatorship this is the right system it's the system that god implemented how many are with me let's go on now i wanna i really wanna would go on and is going on in a church it's not easy brother braham says lord don't let me be critical lord did you know that every time you speak about somebody else you're guilty of trying to bewitch them come on witchcraft in the church you talk about a hard week this week it doesn't matter yeah we didn't want this one to come out today and you still got those little old spirits that talk to you somebody told me the other day and i'm not going to go into details but he said somebody dialed me on on accident they were going to town talking about me either is i said brother what did you do he said as soon as i heard my name i hung it up i said god bless you for that instead of hearing and hearing oh wow oh my god you know what they call me your hero bitterness and then there's all these things towards one another and then we wonder why the spirit can't move because we hold too many things it was a perfect system this is not an easy message for me to preach by any means don't do that that'll finally keep you out of the promised land i'll tell you what if i stop right there we should have a a a a a time right now or guilty of those things watch what he says it'll finally keep you out of the promised land and the moment we go from a spiritual system it is i hope you get this okay i gotta trying to get all these things ironed out who has taken you from a spiritual system brought you back to a carnal system he's asking these questions i say we should ask ourselves those questions this day angry these are spirits that anoint the people trying to bewitch them what a party these witches are having huh why is it that we don't recognize these spirits though i want you young people to understand this every one of you that's here why it's so important to guard guard your minds there's an all-out war right now homosexuals and lesbians and and all these things right and i'm wondering are our children are we watching them we just give them and say be quiet is to control your minds because be behind every spirit you got to capture the spirit behind it all system that wants to control you and depending on what system you choose to determine most likely controls the heart control what is the purpose of bewitching to control by establishing a system when we've been through this time and time again we understand that politics and religions coming out of the earth it's what is known as the image of the beast and we know that this is speaking about the united states it is in the that's what manipulates or moves these horns or powers there's a system there ion system what kind of a system a class is a system a system of witches must do you know that have you understand yeah see and jezebel he says is a type of the catholic church therefore it is a jezebel system that's or that came forth from the beast and watch it use scripture if it is he says in the philadelphia church that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principles [Music] and everybody's like wow we're tired of fighting oh let's just be one and be at peace you're about to get bewitched all he's got to do is grab your attention or through so that no people will be recognized as actual churches under direct or indirect domination of this council denomination he says the churches are being bewitched by this ecumenical council economical what's the bewitching going on the bewitching once again is the implementation of a system august 23rd 1948. of churches for what purpose to implement but a stir of the foolish virgins to be left here on earth for a picking for the antichrist enjoy that on wednesday why did the did the wise virgins have oil and the foolish didn't or not because the wise were willing to be pressed on praise god and lord bless me and keep on bringing the blessings lord your allowance and yourself we don't want to suffer about nothing no no they don't want to be pressed but it's only through pressure and she was not willing to do image of the beast it's like people that smoke cigarettes but now they vape it's the same nicotine and just repackaged so that it's not oh no it's different namaste what's their message i believe we do fulfill that scripture but not one our way not one in that system one in christ stop and think about this i was trying to help a couple the other day and i was explaining to them yes i said now when you get married you you there should be three in your marriage yeah okay who's supposed to be the three questions god husband and wife and i said so so what watch this how simple it is here's the here's christ here's the wife on this side and because that's the system in the home come on come on there's a system set up in your home and unless you break down that system and put it in the right system you're not going to get nowhere now here's the wife he's pulling this way hey i'm right this is what i want to look at very selfish right yeah it's all about what i want no and if you want anything you're going to have to come to my side the husband is on this side yeah that's what their system tells them but the system of god tells us you think you're right and i think i'm right but there's a meeting place i'll meet yes [Applause] in christ that's why you just yell at each other what is this going to must take fight each other what you haven't found your meeting place your system is wrong in the home system unless show us that picture if you got it this is what they're they're planning it should be done next year i think this is in in the united arab emirates isn't it they know how to be that over here is that over here is a synagogue that over there is a church it was the pope and the leader there of the emirates that the curtains but all they see is oh yes let's be one brother what a false unity i want you to get it because this this is so important just goes so so fast watch this now this we're just going to keep on going because we don't have service this afternoon watch us down the process of breaking you down of breaking you down watch this now this this fascinated me i don't know how many of you have ever heard of the of of of this um it's a system of conquering one nation or one idea conquering another nation or an idea of ideological subversion yeah it's real the inspiration of that line came from somewhere some man just came up with it no no no no no a man was anointed and that that idea essay there it became it was manifest now i i i i'm going to go slow here because i want you to get this remember don't just take the natural what i'm saying apply it to the spirit because you got to know your enemies this there was an interview done in 1984. on this subject of ideological subversion it was an ex-kgb agent what is this ideological subversion it's a slow brainwashing process to change your perception of reality now take it in the spiritual because this is tremendous to me watch as there are four stages of this subversion number one number one i don't know if i gave it to you all or not maybe i didn't maybe not number one the first stage is demoralization write this down this is the way the enemy will attack you he'll get watch watch how tremendous demoralizes two things it's to cause someone to lose confidence or esperanza the spirit them i have nothing to live for no i don't want to go to church nothing will happen the crazy thing is that it happens at such a slow pace and it happens right between our eyes right in front of our eyes and we don't even recognize it the next thing you know this all the time this is tremendous watch watch this we're going to get to something so tremendous like i still got into a bit of time watch this now he said this is what he said yesterday the demoralization 1984. the demoralization process of the united states is basically complete established and has been for the last 25 years take 1984 and take away 25 years 1959. okay now watch he says it has been completed for the past 25 years think of this now brother branham preaches the message 1954 the invasion of the united states and he's watching this demoralization happen right before his eyes 1956. america has turned it was accomplished and if you can get the ones in power converted they're the ones that do the work for the enemy the problem problem is what they don't know is that behind the scenes there is a system that's been implemented now think of this americans los americans it doesn't matter how much truth you tell them [Music] another ideology another system has taken over and the person didn't even know when it happened maybe it started with one of those little conversations with somebody he says i don't think that's right wow watch it we're going to say foolish galatians the next stage does he get that stabilization yes and i'm not going to go through a lot of this because it's my time is already leaving destabilization is to create a situation which reduces the power or influence of a government or person when people would love to hear the pastor what do you have to say after they've been demoralized watch this now it's to upset the stability or equilibrium of the system that is this second stage only takes about two to five years i've ever preached to you something in the name of the lord take it this morning which is a crisis then you're gonna find yourself in a crisis and this only it only takes about six weeks at this point it then brings on this is what a crisis does it brings on a violent change of power structure and economy you have been demoralized you have been destabilized yes you've been to the crisis and now you're in normalization oh that doesn't normally and this may last indefinitely it makes everything normal to you normally um some of you are getting it some of you are not going to go back and hear it again that's why the bible says be not conformed to this world be not conformed to this world no it's confirmed transform of your mind and bring on a new system paul is trying and struggling we must know our enemy at every trick and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent put that up there if you would i know i did give you this one because as the great dragon come on he's a persecutor am i being accused when we look at this we see that all hell is against us brother brown tells us that when he was out in in germany i believe it was he said there was 15 witches because they wanted to disrupt the services you may believe me or not it says one of the last times not last time but before when we were in uganda brother diego were there were there witches that were sitting in the congregation it was full of nothing but pastors and there were witches there inside there yeah we don't go it's not a vacation which is there [Applause] pastors received the message it was another system oh church i want you to get there you don't get a great system he's the one with his feet and let's look at one feet on the sea and one foot on the earth meaning he's got control over it they have their time they have their parties when their work is done how many are with me that's the easy thing but what's the solution don't come and tell me there's a problem let's find what the solution is when i look at this it says we've applied in the healing services but what about demons in the spiritual and that and that's okay and there wasn't a temper sickness that's going on has happened unless we get that fix we'll get sick this is so tremendous to me they say oh if i could only quit lying now we're going to the soul if i could only quit lusting if i could only quit this or that that's someone said brother you think it's wrong to do a certain thing yes by you asking that shows that there's something wrong there or you wouldn't be asking oh no yes or yes coc why why don't we use that all the time every time we before we get into trouble use that right the moment you ask yourself leave it alone i'm coming around the corner a little bit big corner but it's we're coming around if a man or woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony what would if the children could line up with the mama and the mama could line up with the daddy the daddy could line up with the word you would have one of the greatest homes that ever existed nobody tells me you know not under your system not amazing no no no no one's going to take you watch this can i have like 10 minutes look what happens is that we don't deal with the soul we confess we must confess necessary but there's something wrong somewhere that's because you've got an intellectual faith and not a faith from your heart i love that gusta when you say it could be so but i don't believe it intellectual faith on the inside get it outside you say yes but inside your conscience you say no no are you afraid of this no i know you're not in cyber shaking there's a weakness somewhere and the weakness is because we go after man's doctrine and enticing spirits instead of coming back to the word so many people are listening to enticing i'm a minister i have a right to talk about whatever i want to whoever i want these demons go into places and they get amongst men they get amongst church members they get amongst good people and they cause them to come into illusion and they say things and do things it is serious teach things practice things under disguise they're good at hiding oh pastor i love you so much [Music] oh we're a quiet bunch you say well brother i'm not a witch i don't do witchcraft i don't partake in those things praise god let me ask you a question when the lord this is what i'm talking about putting a little another disguise and look at the orlando what's halloween's all about halloween right doctrines of devils diablo fighting and behind the skies do you rebel or are you obedient to the world an idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord and because thou has rejected he told him i also have rejected from binky who has bewitched you is what the question is there's no peace no i passed there's just fighting everywhere in the home and the church in the country second kings 9 22 and it came to pass when joram saw jehu he said is it peace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many i pass it was a system that was controlling i'm going to i'm just going to hit this real quick and then i'll and then i'll i'll stop it's the system think about it our bodies are full of systems there's like 10 12 systems in the body muscular system and the nervous system cardiovascular and the respiratory and the digestive and all these things one of the systems is not functioning right that's what satan did he disrupted the system people bound is the plan of redemption and then we wonder why the little boys and little girls don't even know today if they're boys or girls sex and wondering what it's all about the wrong system thank god for a godly father and mother you know i i i hear the different i hear the different testimonies when i hear them in hell these how the lord brought people from different walks of life i cried and i said thank you lord gracias thank you for bringing them there are people that have said not everybody was blessed to have a uncle tommy and antiviola authentication foreign maybe i just don't know a lot of things about life but then he comes back and tells me for a reason so that you could show people that it is impossible to live a greater life that's why i kept you but it's just getting worse that's the system like you grew up in your home father and your mother they put forth a system in your home oh i don't have the other testimony where god brought you from where he has brought us to uh is [Music] he begins [Applause] what we're talking about it sat there and i just cried and cried because i could see where we're going as brother brown describes it thousands and i'm remembering what he said the crown that was put upon the heads of the people he said it fits so perfect church when the saying comes to dispirit you battle a long time don't you let him understand we're almost home nothing take it away from us like this and man it felt so good i sat down this he laid it at the at the feet of the one that was on the throne i never did anything to deserve this never about me about the lord jesus christ your honor doesn't belong to me all honor belongs to him he took his crown off and laid it at the feet of jesus turned around and walked away he said brother peterson says at all the whole time because there maybe it's time that our system it says this time that our system is changed there will only be one system as he is the king on his throne as son of david in the millennium there's a system already in place not going to happen it's already happening hearts of the bride of christ but now i ask you with every headboat how many of you say the system i'm under don't let me do a lot of things if there's somebody

bless you all [Music] i just want to thank all of you for the calls the messages and i just want to give thanks to my pastor for always being there and i'm sure all of you heard about what happened last night on on thursday i i got a concussion from my football game it is and all i remember is that i was just diving for attack on and i blackout [Music] and i'm sensitive to light and loud my head just started pounding i lost a vision in my left eye my whole left side was tingling [Music] so i went outside and sat down we have what i miss mesenter just in pain in the lord i didn't tell anyone and then brother aaron came and prayed for me vinod hermano he prayed for me and then uh me and marty left for me and it just got like i just felt so bad in the mien and um in the lobby um my dad just prayed for me el salon desperate and i just felt a presence there yo they took me in and they told me that i have post-concussion syndrome [Music] and while i was just laying in the hospital bed [Music] hospital my mom was there and just humming hymns christian hymns cristianos and i look up i just see your light there you'll be and all i could do is cry and i should be in el paso right now and i couldn't find the what scripture it was but it says lay your hands upon the sick and they shall recover i just want to thank the lord for that gracious [Applause] uh good morning and god bless you all this past summer in june we took my dad to the doctor and discovered that he had a very large aneurysm in his aorta [Music] basically the length of his abdomen and twice the normal width of your aorta established abdomen there were no local doctors that could operate on him so we had to take him to a specialist in albuquerque on in albuquerque the specialist that saw my dad said that he had never seen an aneurysm of that size before because they typically burst before they get that big specialist [Music] [Music] when we went to the youth camp in july um we had a service with testimonies and specials and julia specialist testimonials and i gave a pre-testimony the testimonial at that time my dad's surgery wasn't scheduled until september but i wanted to claim the victory then and as auntie laura said sometimes you just have to force the vision. after i got done with my testimony brother seth prayed for my dad and there was something very special in that prayer testimonial that really helped me in the months to come and especially during the surgery it was really simple he didn't ask for the surgery to go well he just simply complained he simply claimed um i believe that that was under the inspiration of the holy spirit and it stayed with me throughout the month on september the 17th my dad had his surgery the doctor had said it would be a three to four hour surgery with povid protocols we were not allowed to be in the hospital so we just had to wait by the phone when regulars at four hours um the call never came so i called the hospital to see how he was doing yeah they said just a little bit longer he's almost done at six hours the call didn't come inside about the hospital same same answer says at that time we knew that something just wasn't quite right and we began to put the call out for prayers but for me brother seth's prayer stuck in my head i just kept hearing complete healing they had to completely open his abdomen because one of the major arteries in his intestines had ruptured and they had to repair it in the course of that time we went through several surgeries several operations um but we went for his follow-up appointment um on this past monday nuevo there were several times they said he was going to have lasting after effects but when we talked to the doctor on monday he is healed so i just have one more ask for everyone a petition thank you all for your prayers we thank the lord for those wonderful testimonies and are grateful to the lord for his uh this great presence and thank you pastor once again for the word of god happy to have our pops with us this morning just uh just a few announcements you appreciated the word of god this morning it comes but i do want to tell you that to minister and what we
