[9:52] happened
[9:54] I want to share with you just how great
[9:56] our God has been

[10:03] sick for the past Manas
[10:11] got the flu
[10:16] Sunday night
[10:18] Domingo natarde
[10:19] my my middle child Joshua me Nino Joshua
[10:26] I took him out of the bathtub because he
[10:27] was running a high fever and the
[10:29] medication wasn't doing anything for him
[10:38] um and as soon as I I took him to his
[10:39] bedroom to dress him his body got really
[10:41] cold
[10:46] the color of his skin got really gray
[10:52] and the only place where he was warm is
[10:54] right on his Temple
[11:01] I'm not a doctor so I don't know exactly
[11:03] what was going on
[11:07] but I knew one thing
[11:10] that the Lord God is mighty
[11:13] and he's more than capable to help us in
[11:16] time of need yes
[11:21] so out of inspiration my wife asked
[11:24] asked me to call Brother Diego
[11:30] and he gives a very simple prayer
[11:34] and he mentioned something to me
[11:37] he says when we get together and pray
[11:40] together
[11:43] the prayer is that much stronger
[11:48] and after the prayer he he tells me the
[11:51] Lord let him feel what was wrong with
[11:52] Josh is
[11:58] said there was something wrong with one
[12:00] of his lungs
[12:03] and immediately after he had told me
[12:05] that
[12:08] it seemed like Josh's breath started to
[12:11] come back
[12:15] the color of his skin started to get
[12:17] pink

[27:44] bless you
[27:50] feel safe well
[27:53] well Jesus
[27:57] it wasn't your sacrifice
[28:05] that's
[28:09] why when when that life went out foreign
[28:18] to the its original owners
[28:41] that's why the phone moves
[28:43] because the light moves
[28:50] and what foreign
[29:35] I get so burned out at home
[29:40] and when I go to churches and I hear
[29:42] them well
[29:51] which blood are you gonna apply
[29:54] to this church
[29:57] has to be a
[29:59] sacrificial lamb
[30:01] um
[30:14] oh yes we'll see where does it come from
[30:19] the one that was in his body went to the
[30:21] elements
[30:22] where is this one going to come from
[30:25] oh my I shouldn't bring this to the
[30:27] church
[30:30] even foreign I
[30:57] can't get close to somebody
[31:09] I am partial in the church I take sides
[31:13] with certain families
[31:37] Islam
[31:50] which we know is in the veins
[31:56] it's your life
[32:02] it's your life
[32:05] and he says apply it is
[32:13] what does the door pose do okay
[32:16] go to the scriptures
[32:19] the shepherd IL Pastor he's the door
[32:23] Elizabeth yes or no see oh no if if he's
[32:28] the doors
[32:31] has braces
[32:34] that keeps the building up
[32:37] all the weight of the building is upon
[32:41] the linto and the North Poles
[32:44] that's why Jesus said
[32:47] my burn is easy
[32:51] and he says put put the Lord upon me or
[32:56] put your Burns upon me
[32:59] well then when you have a burden
[33:03] don't you pray and put him to Jesus
[33:08] you come and put them shoulders
[33:17] and what does that man become
[33:20] Prophet says it's a burden carrier it is
[33:30] for the burden of the people amen
[33:36] now
[33:37] if you'll understand it
[33:40] that was
[33:44] something that died
[33:47] and to become a linto
[33:51] that tree had to die to make the lentils
[33:59] a man
[34:00] so you take something dead
[34:04] and apply it to something dead yes
[34:17] they say well he required the blood of
[34:20] Jesus
[34:22] absolutely absolutely for Redemption
[34:26] amen nobody else could do it Lord Jesus
[34:31] Christ
[34:33] is it still the Lord yes
[34:37] see when the person dies
[34:40] he becomes self-sacrificial
[34:45] so that that blood can be applied
[34:53] if you think I'm crazy leave me alone
[34:57] I'm not crazy local exactly what I'm
[35:00] talking about
[35:05] a man
[35:07] in the Millennium in millennium all
[35:10] right I'm gonna leave that token for a
[35:12] while
[35:14] and we come back
[35:16] and uh
[35:18] the the the on the six-fold purpose and
[35:21] it's proposito
[35:27] Gabriel's visit today and
[35:32] in the sixth one in the sexto is to
[35:36] anoint the most holy isanto
[35:39] and right away the Mind goes to Jesus
[35:43] it is Jesus
[35:47] he's the Holy One I know
[35:50] but in this case
[35:53] there's something that is most holy
[35:58] foreign
[36:16] and the outer cord was a place outside a
[36:21] warning to the Gentiles
[36:29] yes so
[36:32] and then you find that there was the
[36:34] labor
[36:38] and you find
[36:41] places or
[36:43] here on this side there was the station
[36:46] of the men
[36:50] and then there there was places for
[36:54] where they where they had the animals
[36:57] that were to be sacrificed
[37:00] and then they had places where the the
[37:04] skin and the and the meat the different
[37:07] parts of the animal were taken
[37:10] is
[37:12] and then of course you pass from that
[37:15] into the holy place
[37:18] now we're speaking about the most holy
[37:22] and inside this uh holy place
[37:27] there was a curtain that separated the
[37:30] holy place from the outer Court of yeah
[37:34] [Music]
[37:37] but inside the holy place
[37:41] it had its Dimensions I believe they
[37:43] were about 30 by 40.
[37:47] and this is what this this
[37:50] was the place of the Levites yesterday
[37:54] no one else could enter that place
[37:59] but after that place
[38:02] there was another curtain
[38:05] and that's that's the curtain that was
[38:08] ripped at the crucifixion of Jesus
[38:11] Christ yes yes
[38:19] was a place called the holy of holies
[38:25] that's where a god Abode
[38:29] and and you know
[38:32] forgive me if I don't if I can explain
[38:35] it right to you but but God knows my
[38:38] heart
[38:40] but how could God
[38:44] just dwell in that little cloud in by
[38:48] that little building called the holy of
[38:51] holies
[39:01] this is where the pillar of fire would
[39:04] come
[39:07] that purifier never came to the outer
[39:10] court
[39:12] or to the holy place
[39:15] the whole the the pillar fire came only
[39:19] on
[39:20] on the holy of holies
[39:28] I want to stay with the
[39:31] place
[39:32] but the other is the holy of Holy Spirit
[39:36] like if I would say Lord
[39:40] but if I would tell you Lord of lords
[39:44] if I would say Kings but if I would say
[39:48] king of kings
[39:50] so then it's like saying
[39:53] holy place but holy of holies
[40:01] so then Israel
[40:04] they they believe in their Temple
[40:06] Worship
[40:11] in the temple worship
[40:15] they got problems
[40:17] according to the Book of Daniel and
[40:20] according to Saint Matthew
[40:22] it's an Abomination that's going on
[40:25] right there is
[40:36] and it's supposed to house the rock
[40:46] Isaac
[40:49] it's upon a little mountain
[40:53] called Mount Moriah or Mount Moriah
[40:58] and to the Muslims it's called foreign
[41:37] because Abraham was also also the father
[41:41] of the Muslims
[41:48] so they they said our Father Abraham
[41:52] but they don't believe that that he was
[41:55] Isaac or the blessing was upon Isaac
[42:02] they believe that the blessing was upon
[42:04] Ishmael
[42:07] are you with me they believe the
[42:11] blessing was for this for Ishmael
[42:16] and you cannot deny you know that God
[42:20] gave a special blessing to agar with
[42:23] Ishmael
[42:25] is
[42:31] shall be counted in Isaac
[42:37] man
[42:41] received a blessing
[42:43] the greatest blessings
[42:47] foreign
[43:16] directions
[43:28] why somebody came and kicked you out of
[43:30] your home
[43:33] when you fight for your home
[43:35] absolutely absolutely
[43:37] but you gotta fire a clean fight
[43:41] for a good fight
[43:46] all right you're still with me
[43:49] so then you come into the holy of holies
[43:53] and then you come into the holy place
[43:57] and my goodness
[43:59] foreign
[44:09] that's where God is came down
[44:14] and mad
[44:16] with Abraham
[44:18] even though the ishmaelites say that
[44:22] well the the Arabs saying Ishmael
[44:28] and they that's why they have in another
[44:31] Shrine
[44:34] they have another rock it's called a
[44:37] black rock yes
[44:41] but they claim this Blessings of Abraham
[44:45] and all Christians churches claim the
[44:48] blessings of Jesus Christ
[44:50] and they all say Jesus in Jesus but the
[44:54] blessings
[45:05] you're not going to get this blessings
[45:08] amen amen all right I I was searching
[45:13] and I just thought it was Scandal and I
[45:15] have to go to the First Kings
[45:17] chapter 8
[45:20] and verse 22 verse we're going to read
[45:24] and here's the the prayer of Solomon in
[45:28] the temple
[45:30] see they they have their Temple worship
[45:35] all right let's find out what Abraham
[45:38] prayed
[45:40] Solomon stood before the altar of the
[45:44] Lord at the presence of all the
[45:46] congregation of Israel Israel and spread
[45:49] forth his hands toward Heaven
[45:54] Israeli extended and he said
[45:59] loyal there is no God like thee in
[46:02] Heaven above or on Earth beneath who
[46:05] keep his Covenant and mercy with thy
[46:08] servants that walk before thee with all
[46:11] their hearts
[46:12] Israel no ideas
[46:21] who has kept with thy servant David my
[46:24] father that thou promised him that those
[46:30] spakest also with thy mouth and has
[46:33] fulfilled it with thine hand as it is
[46:36] this day see Solomon here is living in
[46:40] his day not in tomorrow so it's not him
[46:42] yesterday
[46:43] he was talking about what he promised
[46:47] his father David but now he's bringing
[46:49] it to the presence
[46:59] therefore now Lord God of Israel keep
[47:02] with thy servant David my father that
[47:04] thou promised him saying there shall not
[47:07] fail thee a a man in my side to sit on
[47:12] the throne of Israel so that thy
[47:14] children take heed to their way that
[47:17] they walk before me as thou has walked
[47:20] before me
[47:24] videos
[47:36] watch his prayer and now
[47:39] of Israel let thy Work I pray thee be
[47:42] verified which thou spokest unto thy
[47:45] servant David My Father Allah
[47:52] watch his prayers
[47:54] but will God indeed dwell on the earth
[47:59] behold the heaven and Heaven of Heavens
[48:04] cannot contain thee how much less this
[48:09] house that I have built it is
[48:35] saved in his prayer
[48:38] how much less will you come to this
[48:42] house that I build cuantos
[48:48] foreign
[48:59] how
[49:00] God so great
[49:04] could form a little blood cells
[49:09] um
[49:11] pour himself in that is
[49:16] figure it out
[49:20] that's why Solomon's saying here
[49:23] you feel Heaven Heavens Heaven
[49:28] how could you come
[49:30] to this house well
[49:34] I don't want to read more that's how I'm
[49:36] finished
[49:38] go ahead and read it at home
[49:41] that when everything was ready foreign
[50:05] glory of God was sick
[50:09] inside the temple
[50:11] a man
[50:13] all right
[50:16] now let me go to the prophet a
[50:21] annoyed the most holy
[50:24] these are awesome messages
[50:30] I'm placing you the word
[50:33] this is heavy duty stuff
[50:35] all right anoint the most holy
[50:41] this may be a little strange for just a
[50:44] minute as many of you teachers
[50:52] this is not the anointing
[50:56] not available
[51:05] see he here's
[51:08] here's people
[51:10] and they say Jesus was anointed Jesus
[51:13] yes the Bible says that God anointed
[51:15] Jesus with the Holy Spirit
[51:19] and then we you come to the message
[51:22] and they said well God anointed William
[51:24] Branham
[51:26] so Jesus Christ and William Branham
[51:30] pardon me I don't aim to sound
[51:33] sacrilegious
[51:36] but here's Jesus and here's William
[51:39] Brown
[51:40] and the anointing is upon both of them
[51:47] what about us
[51:49] well what good does it do me if I know
[51:52] that William Branham is a prophet and
[51:53] I'm gonna go to hell
[51:56] but goodness do me if I know that Jesus
[51:59] Christ is God and Lord and he's going to
[52:00] send me to hell yeah
[52:17] he's giving us a choice
[52:20] okay the anointing is not Upon A man or
[52:25] one man m-a-n not m e nombre
[52:34] foreign
[52:42] hombres
[52:44] you know
[52:46] foreign
[53:01] [Music]
[53:16] who lives if you claim that Jesus Lives
[53:18] in Your Heart
[53:20] then you are also anointed
[53:24] because you got the anointing inside of
[53:27] you
[53:30] and that beautiful
[53:31] let's keep reading here
[53:34] Jesus is already Anointed
[53:37] The Book of Acts of Acts that God
[53:39] anointed Jesus with the Holy ghosts
[53:43] and he went around doing good and
[53:45] Healing The Sick and so forth Jesus is
[53:48] already he is Messiah
[53:54] what if I would tell you
[53:56] that Jesus is the Messiah and I am all
[54:00] for a messiah
[54:04] amen what if I was to tell you that you
[54:07] are little Messiah
[54:10] when you cannot be a messiah if you're
[54:12] not anointed
[54:14] so people are waiting for for the
[54:18] Millennium to be annoyed
[54:24] open your Bibles
[54:28] oh this is good
[54:30] Matthew the 25th chapter
[54:35] amen let's see how this anointing comes
[54:38] and
[54:43] six twenty five six
[54:46] there was a crime made behold the bright
[54:49] groom colors go ye out to meet him how
[54:53] many have gone out too many
[54:56] what do you mean
[54:58] I meet him under the evening time
[55:02] message
[55:11] and then the message
[55:29] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[55:33] their lamps
[55:36] and the foolish said unto the wise
[55:39] you give us of your oil
[55:42] oh there's the anointing
[55:47] of your oil for our Lambs are gone out
[55:54] they were not under
[56:00] they were like those people that were
[56:03] not Balaam that were not with the
[56:06] children of Israel
[56:08] Israel the difference between Balaam and
[56:12] Moses
[56:15] in Moses Camp they had the shot of the
[56:18] Kings
[56:24] they had the blessings of God
[56:28] every house
[56:31] that's why children must recognize we
[56:35] are in the hands
[56:47] of the message
[56:51] of the evening time
[56:55] that's the anointing
[56:58] now does everybody get it
[57:01] or is a bride waiting to receive it
[57:05] now the bride
[57:08] is receiving it
[57:11] and has received the anointing oil
[57:16] that's why if you take olive oil to pray
[57:20] for the sake questions
[57:23] that's fine but that's not perfect Faith
[57:26] perfect perfect
[57:31] and who's gonna believe
[57:38] it because they believe God
[57:45] you don't have to anoint him
[57:49] [Applause]
[57:50] and from your word
[58:00] [Music]
[58:08] of me
[58:11] man
[58:12] yes sorry
[58:14] amen yeah
[58:25] not making fun
[58:27] no but that's not the face
[58:32] why cry
[58:36] all you gotta do is speak the words
[58:39] why can't people speak the words
[58:42] apparently because Jesus don't dwell in
[58:44] there
[58:48] foreign
[58:53] [Applause]
[59:25] oh man when you're sick well this
[59:28] doesn't fermo and you call me brother
[59:30] Mike again Tony brother Jimmy brother
[59:33] Tommy Jr
[59:36] you don't have to tell them to anoint
[59:38] you
[59:39] sometimes you just saying
[59:58] that has Jesus
[1:00:05] let's finish this to the 10th verse
[1:00:10] but the wise answered saying
[1:00:13] not so
[1:00:15] lest there be not enough for us and you
[1:00:18] but go you rather to them that sell and
[1:00:21] buy
[1:00:22] for yourselves
[1:00:33] and while they went to buy
[1:00:36] the bridegroom came
[1:00:38] and they that were ready
[1:00:41] they were ready they were anointed
[1:00:44] he ain't going if you're not anointed
[1:00:47] when in with him
[1:00:50] to the marriage and I can prove to you
[1:00:52] that the marriage happens in the
[1:00:54] Millennium it doesn't happen in the
[1:00:56] Rapture people say well in the Rapture
[1:00:58] we're going to get married
[1:01:00] we're going to be married
[1:01:09] this is my beloved wife
[1:01:13] here you
[1:01:15] oh
[1:01:19] but since that wife is
[1:01:28] in that day there won't be two pastors
[1:01:32] pastores there will only be one person
[1:01:36] and we're going to see in a few minutes
[1:01:39] I know my time is gone see if I can
[1:01:43] finish it
[1:01:44] all right the door was shut
[1:01:47] and the door is your Shepherd is
[1:01:52] the shot it ain't shot right now
[1:01:58] it's gonna be shot yes
[1:02:04] Ezekiel 43 is if we can hurry a little
[1:02:09] bit here to get
[1:02:11] 43. I want to read it in in English only
[1:02:14] to save time
[1:02:17] in English
[1:02:26] and afterward he brought me to the gate
[1:02:29] even the gate that looks Lucas toward
[1:02:32] the East if you look toward the East
[1:02:34] you're going to be standing at the West
[1:02:35] sibilities
[1:02:37] it's the gate that looks to the east
[1:02:40] that's why if you you gotta be standing
[1:02:43] at the west but look at this
[1:02:50] and behold the glory of the god of
[1:02:53] Israel came from the way of the East
[1:02:57] and that's where brother run said that
[1:02:59] Jesus comes from the Easter
[1:03:02] is that right but his glory was coming
[1:03:05] from nowhere there is
[1:03:12] watch carefully
[1:03:15] and the voice was like a noise of many
[1:03:18] Waters and the Earth shine with his
[1:03:21] glory and he was according it was
[1:03:24] according to the appearance of the
[1:03:26] vision which I saw even according to the
[1:03:28] vision which I saw when I came to
[1:03:30] destroy the city and the vision even
[1:03:33] like the vision that I saw by the river
[1:03:35] keyboard and I fell upon my face and the
[1:03:39] glory of the Lord came into the house
[1:03:42] watch carefully
[1:03:44] by the way of the gate whose Prospect is
[1:03:48] toward the East if he's got to be at the
[1:03:51] West he's coming to the house he's
[1:03:54] heading to this
[1:03:55] who is this that's going to this
[1:03:59] carefully versus Cinco so the spirit
[1:04:02] took me up and brought me into the inner
[1:04:05] cord and behold the glory of the Lord
[1:04:08] filled the house the house all right and
[1:04:11] I heard him speaking and unto why
[1:04:15] unto me out of the house and the man
[1:04:19] stood by me there the glory is coming
[1:04:22] like this but there's a man but are you
[1:04:24] ready
[1:04:34] he's coming to the temple but only to
[1:04:37] one man that's why that's why I'm says
[1:04:52] he said one of these days
[1:05:11] if you don't believe who this man is
[1:05:14] never be in the resurrection
[1:05:16] but believe it correctly because because
[1:05:19] people throw the return Ministry real
[1:05:21] Loosely you know like Brian Brown's
[1:05:23] coming brother that's gonna do this he's
[1:05:24] not the only one he's going to do
[1:05:27] but I know that when the glory comes it
[1:05:31] comes upon the man why the man because
[1:05:35] this man is the head is
[1:05:41] Gloria
[1:05:54] can you see that
[1:05:57] quickly quickly
[1:06:00] I I'm I I live in it because they ten
[1:06:03] Leviticus amen

[1:06:27] and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar
[1:06:30] seven times and Anointed The Altar and
[1:06:34] all his vessels see everybody was
[1:06:36] anointed not just the altar everything
[1:06:39] the labor and his foot to sanctify them

[1:11:01] it's very close foreign
[1:11:52] yes I do have
[1:11:55] just two more scriptures and then let's
[1:11:58] go to the Book of Revelation chapter 19.
[1:12:00] remember
[1:12:02] when brother Brown says Revelations 1-3
[1:12:06] speaks of the church they said but you
[1:12:07] don't see the bride anymore or the
[1:12:09] church anymore until Revelations 19.
[1:12:16] I may remember him
[1:12:22] the church isn't say no more
[1:12:26] you see other things
[1:12:29] but but but if I be bold
[1:12:36] yeah
[1:12:38] I would
[1:12:40] I would tell you I see the bride from 4
[1:12:45] through 19.
[1:12:47] but I don't see the church
[1:12:51] come on people yeah I see the bride he
[1:12:55] never said nothing about the bride
[1:12:57] the church you're like listen it's not
[1:12:59] seen anymore
[1:13:01] until Revelation 19.
[1:13:03] but then what is it that we see between
[1:13:06] 3 and 19. hi
[1:13:10] I've been contradictory
[1:13:12] yeah no all right Revelation 19
[1:13:15] apocalypse is
[1:13:17] after these things I heard a great voice
[1:13:19] of much people
[1:13:21] they were in heaven
[1:13:34] salvation and glory and honor and power
[1:13:38] unto the Lord our God
[1:13:41] nuestro
[1:13:49] and you keep breathing then continually
[1:13:52] and then and then verse seven
[1:13:55] let us be glad now now the great
[1:13:58] has been judged
[1:14:03] him again
[1:14:06] she's been judged she's been bombed

[1:14:15] saying that I'm I'm a terrorist or
[1:14:17] something yeah
[1:14:21] I just believe God
[1:14:23] so the Judgment has come because they
[1:14:26] said who is okay so then for three and a
[1:14:29] half years
[1:14:30] I know that you can find places where he
[1:14:33] said Jose
[1:14:34] it looks like he says
[1:14:37] that we go to the marriage supper of the
[1:14:40] Lamb Allah
[1:14:43] okay hi that's fine you want to believe
[1:14:47] that that's fine
[1:14:52] because I know we meet him in the air

[1:14:57] but then verse 7. and then it changes in
[1:15:01] verse 11.
[1:15:02] you gotta watch your sequences here
[1:15:05] it's changing it from from one scene is
[1:15:08] to another
[1:15:09] I find three sins in Revelation 19.
[1:15:14] let us be glad and rejoice
[1:15:17] and give honor to him
[1:15:20] for the marriage of the Lamb is
[1:15:24] his wife had made herself ready

[1:16:37] Peridot you know how to read
[1:16:40] brother Branham said that when you get
[1:16:42] engaged to a girl
[1:16:46] he said she's as good as your wife
[1:16:49] already yeah
[1:16:50] he said the only difference is
[1:16:53] the marriage hasn't been consumed
[1:16:59] and then they say well
[1:17:05] all right
[1:17:08] and to her was granted
[1:17:11] that she should be arraigned in fine
[1:17:13] linen clean and white for the fine linen

[1:17:21] and he said unto me right blessed are
[1:17:25] they which are called unto the marriage
[1:17:28] supper of the lamb and he says unto me
