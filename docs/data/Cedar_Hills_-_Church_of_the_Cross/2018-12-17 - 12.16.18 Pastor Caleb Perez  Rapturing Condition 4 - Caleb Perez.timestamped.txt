[1:10:47] voice okay okay so you know know what's
[1:10:49] the subject is acted upon by something
[1:10:52] or someone
[1:10:53] it's active else were aliens so the

[1:10:57] Activa is when you wish to emphasize the
[1:11:00] doer of the action is come to stick in
[1:11:02] act 1 and the passive voice in a palo de

[1:11:28] Paris areas in its passive voice it does
[1:11:32] to us but not it's active or annoyance
