brother Brennan said that word friend amigo will maybe someday help you to be a friend Amigo amen so we say good morning friends if you would open in your scriptures to the gospel of Saint Matthew 27 and 27. can you read it with me let's just read it like it's in the board then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hole and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers next verse and they stripped him and put on him a Scarlet room yes next verse and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and they read in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail King of the Jews next verse and they spit upon him and took the Reed and smote him on the head yes let's read that again and they spit on him and took the Reed and smote him on the head yes next verse and after they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own Raymond on him and led him away to crucify him yes next verse and as they came out they found a man of sereni Simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross next verse and when they were come into a place called Golgotha that is to say a place of a skull because next verse they gave him vinegar to drink mingle with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink next verse and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they pardoned my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots let us pray foreign we've read one of the most tremendous if not the most tremendous scriptures in the Bible where you paid for our sins Lord may we never forget that day on Calvary is we pray Lord Jesus Jesus that you help us today as we try to help each other with the word that you have spoken thank you Lord Jesus gracias Jesus you receive honor and Glory La Gloria for the honor and Glory it belongs to you we thank you Father yeah in the first place I hope I can hear myself I don't know what's happening to my ears I can hardly hear it so if I hollerito forgive me now my intention to do that it's it's just something it's solo album we have a a privilege the name is how many know that we have a great privilege you know what the Privileges sounds the quality privilege you to come to the house of the Lord it's a great privilege I remember years ago for me but I mean I was passing through that road could you stop us and it was impressed upon me by the holy ghosts to build this church Iglesia my brother Abraham was with me but it's been a few years back and uh when Billy Paul was here we were in the tape room and he told me these words he said brother Tommy hermano Tomas you have a nice church he said you know what the beauty of it is he says that you provide a place for that all of Silver City Silver City will not have an excuse in that day you have opened a place where you bring the eternal life to all this County he said if you have nothing to offered you can offer this to Jesus that you build him a place for people to come and hear the words I thought those were nice words I rejoice and lately or the last week or so there's been a lot of things being said according to Calvary avido muchas cosas especially with the new movie that came out I'm sure most of you have seen it I have not seen it myself but I would like to see it it won't change anything in me than me uh I already know this part but but that doesn't mean that because we know Calvary there is prophet of God says Calvary should be remembered every day I don't think we remember it every day for if we would we would be some type of people we would hardly do anything wrong we will need to be entertained by the world because we remember it every day so it should mean a lot to us what a day that was um the movie they made is called The Passion of the Christo I did hear the interview that Mel Gibson had with Diane Sawyer Mel Gibson and uh um he said he was inspired by the Holy Ghost foreign somebody had to show it there's movies that have been made I peliculas probably the latest movie they made was that Drew the most people was The Lord of the Rings that's based on Bible but a lot of fiction but this certain movie was the 12 hours of Jesus Christ many many strange things happened during the filming of this movie actually happened while they were filming it the the man that was supposed to be Simon asirini El Hombres they were carrying the cross and they fell ikayo and his shoulder was yeah I don't know if it was broken but it was busted pretty good when that happened when they crucified Jesus actual lightning hit the top of the Cross there was fire all around the cross at times Mel Gibson felt like not filming it anymore even felt like suicide ounces and as he describes it in contrast to people or critics that he was against the Jews and so on and so on continue omitted a scripture and there was this scripture on Matthew 27 in Mateo it's not in the movie that's scripture but he had it one of the things that they uh uh theologians were so much against him in Contra was that he didn't portray a Christo that was passionate that's why the movie is called The Passion of the Christ is that he he made him look terrible so then how can you present Jesus Christ on the cross to little children because there's people for caihente that have seen this movie and said they never see it the second time it's too graphic it's my grafica it's it's too terrible they had Bill Mel Gibson about it and he's made this remark is declaration how I portrayed Christ o does not do justice to what they did to him see a lot of people Christians called so-called Christians christianos he went to the cross and they hit him a little bit you know slapped him a little bit they just spit on him like that because Manos I don't think we could describe calories so they they they they asked him so many questions I like the answer to this question is who really killed him the Romans the Romanos or the Jews he said well it was under Roman room but he said but the Jews they are the ones that really crucified him and that's why they call him anti-seminist or whatever and Diana you and I are really the ones that crucified crucified and I was watching the report and I said I said that is the truth is I wanted this morning uh I don't know if you have it Anthony but the three questions I gave him to Anthony this morning I I want to take it tomorrow and and I'm bringing out what the prophet brought I have nothing else to say but what our Prophet says I'm not here trying to be a great man I am not sorry but Jesus is Calvary should be remembered every day can you imagine if every day you got up you remember Calvary is I mean the people go to the movie and they see these Graphics of this movie and they come out crying he's telling yorando and really disgusted with himself but I wonder in a week's time in in what they will be lo que sera they'll go back to the same routine because that day in Calgary didn't mean that much to them knowledge significance if you see it you are you're gonna cry and you're going to cry and you're going to say what a movie but what after that is I don't have time this morning because he gets so rich this thing about Calvary is that I I wanted to take maybe one tomorrow three things that they meant to us how many know that brother Branham uh said that we should carry a cross in our car okay and when you see something that is not right he said always look to the Cross okay that's one point is in another place he says you got to look beyond the cross man that's another thing I mean but there's no way to look to the Cross to look to the other side of the Cross because you don't know what's on the other side we don't want to get too high-minded to say that we have this we are possessors of this is before we get to the other side never go to the other side until you see this side then you enter in with reverence you're not what you think you are amen but it was that day number one numerono we should seek what that day Meant For Us everybody would you repeat number one then number two would you read it oh and nobody knows how to read nobody went to school here what foreign again the Nuevo we should seek what that day Meant For Us what what was said that he got crucified crucified what is it okay it settled terminal the same question terminal no same question see I have an advantage over your dad you think that I know what you're saying in two languages so I can help him God bless Brothers we had off tremendous meetings amen God bless him now that's my friend amen how many get tired see if you get tired raise your hands you get tired I'm answering the first one is attention if that day meant something to you it's yesterday you know it's almost every day we say I'm so tired I heard right oh what a drag today okay we all do that and nobody works more than me yo I'm so tired amen now let's see what that day meant for us you know we we go to funerals and uh we see like gramita mother-in-laws how she she just went to sleep she was laying in bed and she just went to sleep she didn't struggle I just started to lecture yourself and she probably in her says I'm so tired but she's not tired no more she's resting right correct but the Bible speaks I'm going to take it real slow I'm not trying to be as simple as I can because I can get into this but the Bible speaks about arrest because we we are tired because we live in a world of routine how many people are tired of their life is let's see raise your hands if you I won't say your promise you're tired but would you do anything about it you're tired all right we bien cansado can you imagine the people that have gone on before us are they tired are they happy people listen just as simple as it is very happy content do you think that is are we gonna squirrel hunt in the millennium he said no sir no senor he says why would you want to do that he says because I like to squirrel hunt he said oh in this life is apply the pleasure that you get out of squirrel hunting it's the multiplication and multiply it by a million you see it's it's it's a it's another it's another life it's it's otra Vida happy Felicia foreign Nuevo [Music] we go fishing and we're happy and then we're bored because it's too hot we go hunting then we get mad because it rains all the time we're hunting and then the constant word that comes from our mouths it's so boring I am just so important so we flip on the television and we look at the television find the same movie five ten times and then we don't like that so we got a little control that we can change it then we see Sports and our team loses and we get tired of seeing them loose you know wait till next year everything is next year everything is tomorrow so you you cannot it doesn't satisfied satisfaction so they serve your steaks and then after you eat it and your stomach is this you as yourself why did I eat so much and then the wife comes what do you want to eat today I wanna I want this and this better be cooked right or I won't I don't want it then you eat it and then the next day the wife says I'm going to make you some of this again I don't like that I'm tired of that when you change your menu a little bit and it goes well if I could just take a vacation so you go on a vacation and you spend all your money and when you come back you say why did I do that because the same question has not been said yesterday the same question hasn't been settled now in all the things I mentioned it's not wrong to have another house or to take a little vacation but remember one thing you're going to be tired until you find out what that day meant for you what Calvary meant for me we worry about our children do you know that we worry more for children that are married than for those that are not married we worry about them we worry about everything we're a nervous wreck we got a bunch of nerves because we're always worried and as long as that happens doesn't mean that much for us what that they meant for us we hear preachers like you hear me and we hear them preach about Calvary you want to see my notes I want you to watch how many notes say all these notes I'm going in the same thing but I'm preaching them now how do you how do you get this are you very smart but I do believe that Calvary meant something to me everybody knows I'm a preachers what is a preacher yes he is simply a public servant supplementation services to see what he can preacher to help foreign that's all now if he preaches for any other reason are you with me I'm just talking I'm preaching do you understand I'm just talking to you I said good morning friends I'm trying to help you I pray that I'm trying to help you but maybe I preach because I get good times maybe I preach because it's for different reasons but but if I don't preacher what that day meant for me I wanna and if I preach this is your predico on the third part look what we ought to do for that day then we have to answer Modis and objectives amen you see he gets serious he said you amen amen that day meant a lot to us what did it did why did that day have to happen you ever think about things that you do is you'll go back and you say why did I do that how many of you have done something that you wish you never had done I don't know because if you all of you don't answer your hands you're you're lying because has done things that we are ashamed of get them and we we don't want to remember but there's something in us that makes us remember how would you like to forget it is it possible to forget it yes see if the sin question is answered then you don't have to carry that load as long as you still remember it that means that day on Calvary significant El calvario hasn't really happened to you you see where the movie you're saying that the people can see these little things I'm telling you know most of them can some can't see tired cancel oppressed tired and oppressed same thing same body but every day the body takes a little different change is that right I looked in the mirror the other day and I said you used to be handsome particles there's a lot of changes and there will be more yeah what do you do it I'm sick of myself sometimes we're not so sick of other people we're sick of ourselves and as long as something points us to that we are feeling that way we believe it that way the sin question has not been answered ah why do we go to church ask the question why am I in church because I want to sing to the Lord that's good but that does not answer the sin question we go to church we want to hear the preaching that's good it'll help you but that still doesn't answer the thing amen preachers preach singers singers and the prophet says I differ with you my Pentecostal Brothers it's not just going to church I'm hitting banging on a tambourine and singing songs can you see people doing that in the church and praising God yeah and raise their hands and one year later you go to the church and they're not there no more they stop going to church because they were seeking something they never found that's where I want to get to I is never answered and they go to church Ivana Iglesia oh yes and everybody goes to it for everybody follows something they can find the rest are you with me they can't find it amen amen but when you find it what it is what that day Meant For Us what did that day do for you because if that day meant something foreign is to settle is the terminal the same question all right how many is tired of this life well let's get a new life let's start a new life the only way if we recognize for that day meant for us if not you know we can be looking for a city we can be looking for eternal life and we can seek so many things in ourselves individuals know what Calvary did for me we will always have sin in our lives because amen amen if not she know you'll go to church Iglesia how do you like this Foundation pretty good foundation because I've preached at least five messages I'm gonna get to the actual Calvary that Calvary is Jesus Christ amen and I'm gonna explain a little bit that they did to him but do you know that each one of us must have our calories we don't pay the price but we're gonna see there what did they did for us and then we're gonna see what we should do for that day it'll get really warm in here not to use the word heart no foreign amen Glory what is all about Sin okay yeah what is it yes what is sin okay speaker and believe incredulillah the only Cinder is yeah so people this is in the churches in Las Iglesias they teach people that they should dress a certain way that's all right but they don't settle the same questions that they should abstain from certain things because that's fine but they don't sell it every church every Persona is seeking God is but there's a difference where it settles the things that I might have this wrong I don't think so but if you think I'm wrong you come and tell me I don't believe that people can find God I don't believe it I don't believe that anybody has the capacity to find God they look for him they dress a certain way they do certain things so one says that a woman can wear high heels the other one says she cannot work they don't settle the same questions one says that you can should go to church on Saturday one says you can should go to church on Sundays they're missing the same questions I don't believe that men will find God like that I don't believe it but I do believe foreign back to God the regress to adios and unless God puts that man on this Earth not just any roads it's one rose that leads back to God Amen back to God the regressors it's back to him it's the regression that he won't come and you can get on the road there's no way you can get on that road unless anuser something strikes you like Vegas on that road back to God the regress values you don't have God you're going back to God you have received something that will take you back together you understand that I don't think you do you know remember I think you understand you don't have God no what you have you have something in your hands something in your hands that puts you on a roll back together at any time think about it just a little bit amen it's a sin question is and the reason I'm speaking the way I'm speaking last morning because it's very delicate but we're going to settlement the same question amen amen when they hacked him you know you saw like I said I haven't seen the movie but one day I'm gonna give you brother Brown's description not Mel Gibson's description I sincerely believe that Mel Gibson red brother branham's books and if he didn't he got it from the church in Colorado one of the largest Pentecostal churches in the world because he comfort with them before he made this movie amen he was in Colorado Denver Colorado making this movie and this was one of the things that critics threw the most yes well when when they hacked him and they they smear him the I'm describing brother Brandon the leather strings I'll call them they had big spikes on the end centennials every time they hit him and these spikes would go into his body it is when they pulled it actual flash came out when they when they hit him here on the side this part of this body it didn't just it didn't bleach the whole flesh came out and you could actually see his wrists brother Branham describes him element he would look like a bunch of hamburgers When They Crucified him you see some crosses that he had a little thing on the middle part of his body well there was nothing there was no clothes one mistake that Mel Gibson did he put a nice young handsome guy portraying Jesus Jesus and Jesus was not a handsome man in fact Bible says there was no Beauty in him this man that played the part of Jesus said green eyes I believe and and he was kind of tall is Jesus Jesus Christ was five foot four inches tall yes the beauty of Jesus foreign [Music] Los Angeles man and he made Michael and Michael was a big Grande Grande pretty good looking um that's good look at this but he was very humble humility and God is yours walk with them and he put charge and two and to Michael yeah Miguel and God is yours knowing what he was doing God put it in there that he didn't put in Michael okay Miguel so in so because of this little thing that God put in luciferation Lucifer exalted himself watch it when you ask for a gifts can failure amen had a little special foreign [Music] a question simpatico a question okay yeah that's that's what they use we don't use it but it's good for Henry that he has me for that to help him but he can help me too because Henry knows a lot of words I don't know I'm not smarter than him but but if you say if he says these words here [Applause] see he had something well in his in his way in sumanera God yours what you call God I'm gonna describe him watch carefully see if you can understand me I'm gonna describe him as Elohim now I'm gonna go into the other part okay so Elohim foreign well it was the same kingdomeno but it was divided but it never should have been it had to be once but one had control of one part and the other one had control of it today we have churches or we have kingdoms or we have a different things like voice of restoration yeah see divided who is Joseph Guinness Jose I don't believe in Joseph I don't believe in the fightful movies I I'm not dealing with the Pentecostals I'm dealing with a message I believe brother Bernie I believe brothers and then Paul says is Christ divided terminal the question has not been said and then the prophet says many times sin did not first begin on the Earth sin began in heaven amen amen was did God make a man's sinful I don't know which way I'm going to go right now I'm waiting on the Holy Ghost to see which Rod I'm going to take because when they put the man here they say man was born of sinful flesh of course not everybody a lot of people know that man was not born of that the flesh it was more sinful up close to where God lived are you with me is in what God made when God put the man on the edge the man was without sins not with God no condos but they you you're going to a question and I don't want to go into too many of these questions concerning the Heaven and the same country and one question would be who made the devil sin is who made the devil devil okay Diablo who is the one that put this little thing in Satan yes and I'll tell you who did it God himself put that otherwise what was it insane that he had let's call him for this moment he wasn't safe and say he was Lucifer son of the morning do you know that he walked where the volcanoes were erupting do you know that in those hard rocks hot Stones he stepped on us do you know that his kingdom that he has a beautiful kingdom when he came here every one of the Angels Lucifer hola Lucifer a they see him over here they say he's awesome man this creature whatever they call him he's so beautiful he's so great a man and that's the way that a lot of preachers and a lot of churches think they're the greatest yes well muy bien I'd like to cut in on that but I feel checked on it yes and I I I leave that a little bit God but God gave him that party now I want you to think one thing every one of us there has to be a place where God give find their appropriate place we receive it's a tree is is [Music] some people can't help it but be Devils Diablos you know why they don't have a representation because they said the same thing happened here the angel Sin is Sin was imputed to them but probably see but Peru the Bible says blessed is the man that's sin quebeca is not imputed to him it's not imputed because if if this Angel sin purchase that sin is important to them but if this was yesterday because who it was Guinness and the sin was not imputed I know you had never heard did my Angels Sing I don't know you want to say did your angel sin because if my angel didn't sin Simeone my angel have no sin no tiene but when God made us from this Earth there was two aviendos Abel and James one from Satan who knows and the other one from the state of God is that right that's what we call serpency as we were made bar takers we were manifested in trash we were manifested in French God didn't make Adam down here first he made him a spirit then when he breathed into his Naturals amen foreign but we know that we know the story then he got to that rib Costilla and he deceived her yeah when he deceived him no no he didn't have nothing Africa not a bit of sin and God still was with him you know you know everything's okay uh-huh see what sins look at PECO was when he took his wife and committed for he did with her the committed was what he did that foreign I don't know if I can answer this was that the sin what he did with her foreign except except that Lucifer Lucifer thought that he could do things a little bit better than God then circuits and that's the same yes when you in your life think that you can preach this better than brother a lot of problems and that was a that he believes he believed that he could do could do it better than guys well he's gonna try it to do it better than God yes he's going to try to do it so he couldn't handle it he already happened in his kingdom so then he saw God yes forming a man or another civilization he's forming it down here and he found a way to get into that garden and to make it he had to first look at what was down there and he said Adam Adam I can take him if ever fussy fussy I just need somebody to work here so he saw Aaron's friend the serpent was his friend Adam and the serpent were friends the Bible says and you know the story I'm trying to just get to this little park I got about 20 minutes so you can settle the scene well we know how Satan that little gift is he said this so God has said he never should have said God has said just leave it alone oh that's a good part here oh just going around me right now watch what see what I see so God has said
