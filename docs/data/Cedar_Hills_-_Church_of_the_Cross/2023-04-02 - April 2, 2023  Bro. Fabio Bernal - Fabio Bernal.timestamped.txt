[36:53] the world begins to remember
[37:14] a day of residence
[37:17] he's no longer dead
[37:20] he lives
[37:22] no longer in Jerusalem
[37:25] but in each one of us foreign
[37:57] that is not sick
[38:05] foreign
[38:09] We are continuing
[38:11] we'll enter
[38:14] into the word of the Lord
[38:17] beforehand will direct ourselves
[38:19] in prayer
[38:22] and if you have a petition a need
[38:27] some answers that you're seeking from

[38:35] take my need into account
[38:38] beloved father
[38:41] Lord we come before
[38:46] standing in our post of Duty as a
[38:48] Believer
[38:50] not as an assistant of a church
[38:55] but as a witness of your great residence
[38:59] seeing you work in your people
[39:03] that's the same yesterday today and
[39:06] foreign
[39:09] bless your word that we will voice this
[39:11] morning
[39:12] that it may run and they may be
[39:14] glorified
[39:15] Healing The Sick
[39:21] delivering the unbelievers
[39:24] and increasing the faith in The Believer
[39:27] we report ourselves to service
[39:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Our
[39:33] Lord amen
[39:37] we will be using two scriptures
[39:43] beginning with the first one Romans
[39:46] chapter 8 verse
[39:50] in John 5 24 is
[39:55] very well-known scriptures by all of us
[39:59] I'll go a bit slow okay
[40:04] I'm entering into 80s
[40:10] we're going too fast we have to slow
[40:12] down to 40s
[40:14] we have to go a bit slower
[40:18] but Abraham yes
[40:22] we're twins there going the same speed
[40:31] it's what gives us the assurance and
[40:34] things
[40:52] and we know that all things work
[40:54] together for good to them that love God
[40:56] to them who are the called according to
[40:58] his purpose
[41:08] [Music]
[41:12] for whom he did for no he also did
[41:15] predestinate to be conformed to the
[41:17] image of his son that he might be the
[41:19] firstborn among many Brethren
[41:21] verse 30.
[41:32] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[41:35] he also called in whom he called them he
[41:38] also justified in whom he justified them
[41:40] he also glorified
[41:49] what shall we say there what then say to
[41:53] these things of God before us who can be
[41:56] against us
[41:58] and go to John chapter 5 verse 24.
[42:14] fairly verily I say unto you he that
[42:17] heareth my word and believeth on him
[42:19] that sent me as everlasting life and
[42:21] shall not come into condemnation but is
[42:23] passed from Death unto life
[42:26] foreign
[43:06] and when you have an assurance of
[43:09] something
[43:10] we only wait for the time
[43:14] where the results May Come
[43:17] so that the Fulfillment of the scripture
[43:22] can be realized completely
[43:27] I believe that is what gives us the
[43:29] Assurance
[43:30] we are not here just to be here
[43:34] we don't come just
[43:37] we come because we know who we are is
[43:47] so here's a representation of the faith
[43:49] without faith it's impossible it is
[43:53] impossible
[43:54] to please God
[43:57] but to please the Lord
[44:00] to see the children of faith that we are
[44:04] sitting this in
[44:18] to be able to say Amen
[44:22] to all of the word of the Lord
[44:30] scripture in John 5 24 makes a very
[44:33] clear affirmation this is
[44:41] my word not he that reads
[44:47] there's many people that are very good
[44:49] readers
[44:51] but we were not very good hearers
[44:58] but God wants us to have more faith than
[45:00] knowledge
[45:02] a reading it gives us knowledge
[45:05] but Faith
[45:07] gives us Revelation
[45:10] and that's why we must come to here
[45:17] and hearing
[45:19] by the word of God
[45:22] brother Branham says
[45:27] Israel and the Red Sea
[46:15] himself the same yesterday today and
[46:18] forever
[46:21] and it is why we know that we are
[46:24] serving God
[46:26] brother Branham says
[46:30] when you serve your brother
[46:33] you are serving God
[47:08] you don't visit them but when you see
[47:11] him
[47:12] oh my brother
[47:16] the prophet said if I've seen a
[47:18] Pharisees it is that person
[47:22] you have to love and the goodness
[47:33] before God we're all the same
[47:35] person and God is no respecter of person
[47:41] sure
[47:46] you have to do what he tells you to do
[47:49] foreign
[48:12] and now we are grateful
[48:15] foreign
[48:17] by the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[48:22] the greatest thing God has done today is
[48:26] that the Holy Spirit
[48:28] took the leadership with man
[48:35] today the Holy Spirit cannot guide
[48:39] if he does not have the best
[48:42] by which he can act
[48:44] in bringing the word
[48:47] he used the prophet
[48:50] a prophet comes the word
[48:54] to feed the people
[48:57] he uses a pastor non-profit not a
[49:00] prophet
[49:03] a pastor is one who feeds
[49:07] and to govern the home he is
[49:12] the governor of the home
[49:18] but now Satan he put women to govern
[49:21] president a women to be president
[49:26] in the home they are the boss
[49:45] but I'll let him know that you came to
[49:47] visit
[49:49] they recognize their position
[49:53] today everyone believes
[49:57] and they're like an automatic car
[50:00] you just press the gas and you go
[50:05] mechanical but in the old times they use
[50:07] a manual yeah
[50:11] foreign
[50:25] and with a new car you run so fast
[50:28] but you don't get to where you need to
[50:30] go
[50:41] [Music]
[50:48] we are grateful for the leadership of
[50:51] the Holy Spirit
[50:54] but the holy spirit is not a little dove
[50:56] flying around
[50:58] the holy spirit is a person
[51:03] that identifies with his words
[51:06] giving known to us is
[51:09] through the ministry Glory
[51:14] it's amazing
[51:16] brother the Holy Spirit
[51:19] I felt a little noise happen
[51:23] ing
[51:24] no the holy spirit is a person
[51:29] outside of that it cannot be this
[51:33] the holy the Holy Ghost will speak see
[51:36] in and hear
[51:40] the past is representing the Holy Spirit
[51:44] what form does the Holy Spirit
[51:49] when the man is the man of the house
[51:53] what form does the Holy Spirit
[51:57] and when the children know their
[51:59] positions
[52:01] what form does the Holy Spirit
[52:07] the people believe
[52:10] that they know the Holy Spirit
[52:14] but they do not know who he is
[52:17] the holy spirit
[52:20] is the word of God
[52:22] and the Heart of the believer outside of
[52:26] that it cannot be yes the Holy Spirit
[52:32] good night
[52:43] to know that it is the truth and the
[52:46] Holy Spirit
[52:48] everything must be scriptural
[52:53] or it is not legal it is
[52:56] we can speak a lot of things
[52:59] but if we don't speak accordingly
[53:05] is
[53:13] his word
[53:17] we know Jesus Christ is the Seed of
[53:20] Abraham you know
[53:24] and we being dead in Christ
[53:29] we take of the seed of abrahamas
[53:34] and we are heirs according to the
[53:37] promise
[53:40] the first thing we must know is that we
[53:42] are heirs
[53:48] to have the right to the promise
[53:51] no one is an heir but the child
[53:55] or adopted but
[54:01] how many know we all fell short from the
[54:04] glory of God
[54:05] but through Jesus Christ
[54:08] the only son of God
[54:11] we were adopted
[54:14] with the same rights
[54:17] that the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:20] Our older brother
[54:59] you'll be a young man a young lady once
[55:01] again
[55:05] you shall live forever with Christ Jesus
[55:10] only we have that promise
[55:15] here in a condition uh by a condition of
[55:18] sex
[55:21] but potentially we have eternal life
[55:24] this since you believe
[55:27] you were sealed
[55:29] foreign
[55:49] it looks uglier every day
[55:53] so take advantage of your youth
[55:59] nosotross
[56:01] as people as
[56:04] much we're absolutely men and women
[56:09] when we return
[56:11] to this earth
[56:15] will be as a man and as women
[56:20] but I asked how many men are left how
[56:23] many women are left
[56:25] the world is
[56:27] you don't know what side they're on
[56:29] anymore
[56:33] foreign
[57:23] the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:30] we have to see the stages
[57:33] that this message brings us through
[57:37] this message brings us to grace
[57:42] and grace has five parts
[57:45] for five stages
[57:51] it is the process is
[57:57] but be perfect as your father who is in
[58:00] heaven is perfect
[58:02] when that which is perfect
[58:04] now which is in part will be taken away
[58:09] at a time we were perfect
[58:16] but the promise
[58:21] to the original position
[58:25] so this message
[58:28] this message of the words
[58:31] restores all things
[58:35] well the whole world is in the
[58:38] evangelicals
[58:39] they call themselves
[58:42] but the bride does not live
[58:45] she is the word
[58:47] taken from the gospel so I think
[58:52] in the process of perfection
[58:57] first this justification
[59:12] first you have to go through
[59:14] justification by faith
[59:19] on Wednesday we had a wonderful
[59:22] wonderful message
[59:25] the justification
[59:27] it is what declares
[59:30] you never sinned
[59:32] you never did it
[59:46] you are not guilty
[59:54] Les
[59:56] guilty is when you know to do the right
[1:00:01] not because you were born
[1:00:05] so you know to do the right things
[1:00:08] and you don't do them
[1:00:11] God justifies
[1:00:14] where you did not know
[1:00:18] but when you came to know
[1:00:21] that's when you are responsible
[1:00:27] olympios when Adam and Eve were clean
[1:00:30] Justified
[1:00:33] there is no wickedness there was nothing
[1:00:38] but the moment they obtained knowledge
[1:00:43] they could not be justified
[1:00:45] because
[1:00:52] and he does not do it
[1:00:56] Adam and Eve could not they they did not
[1:00:59] know
[1:01:00] but when they did it
[1:01:03] that is
[1:01:08] a answer for all of the words
[1:01:13] so the first thing is
[1:01:17] sanctification
[1:01:21] sanctification produced by the blood of
[1:01:24] God you cannot be justified
[1:01:54] sanctification was by the blood
[1:02:08] the origin of sincre
[1:02:12] Julia which is unbelievable
[1:02:16] unbelief has proofs
[1:02:22] spoke to be an adulterer to cheat that
[1:02:26] is attributes
[1:02:28] but when you are born again
[1:02:31] you cease to do those things
[1:02:35] you then came to receive the nature you
[1:02:38] had
[1:02:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:02:45] you had the nature of God
[1:02:47] because we are his children
[1:02:50] and in this message
[1:02:54] it's when we came to know the genetics
[1:03:00] when had you heard about predestinations
[1:03:04] just known as children of God Children
[1:03:06] of the devil and this
[1:03:08] but we didn't know that before
[1:03:12] only in this message the Lord where we
[1:03:16] are where we come from where we are
[1:03:19] going
[1:03:20] where we go back to
[1:03:26] and the new birth is by the baptism of
[1:03:29] the Holy Ghost
[1:03:32] that changes our nature
[1:03:35] from sex to the word
[1:03:40] our first born birth
[1:03:46] our second birth was by the word
[1:03:49] how many have been born by the word
[1:03:53] it's why we can distinguish it we can
[1:03:57] recognize it
[1:04:16] a change of nature is our next step
[1:04:19] Perfection
[1:04:23] Perfection through the Seven Virtues of
[1:04:26] Faith to love
[1:04:29] that Perfection could not have come
[1:04:32] but only in this age
[1:04:36] after the seven Church ages
[1:04:40] and now which is perfect
[1:04:42] that which is in part will be taken away
[1:04:47] prophecies
[1:04:53] all but the word of the Lord
[1:05:19] and what crowns your process of your
[1:05:21] spiritual growth more love is
[1:05:26] Amor because God is love see in espanol
[1:05:31] in Spanish
[1:05:36] you are of Rome
[1:05:40] it is
[1:05:42] in Spanish you you switch the words
[1:05:45] around and in Reverse it spells Rome
[1:05:49] have you seen that
[1:05:51] is
[1:05:53] right down love in Spanish
[1:06:02] or one of its daughters
[1:06:14] and faith is the glorification
[1:06:18] the Seal of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:22] to be able to have resurrection and
[1:06:25] Rapture
[1:06:27] so then the bride it is
[1:06:31] the perfect work of Godly Untouchable
[1:06:37] she who is from Genesis
[1:06:44] that came from the mouth of God
[1:06:52] the Bible says whom he justified
[1:06:58] these are for those who have a spiritual
[1:07:01] mind is maintain
[1:07:07] okay
[1:07:08] there's a difference between the Mind
[1:07:11] spiritual mind
[1:07:13] to knowledge
[1:07:17] knowledge it vanishes
[1:07:21] when a person becomes foreign
[1:08:09] because they're they're embarrassed that
[1:08:11] they'll consider them a Evangelical
[1:08:15] but a Son of God
[1:08:18] they are a son of the king they are a
[1:08:21] son of the world what is that teacher
[1:08:27] in a way to refer ourselves to the
[1:08:30] people
[1:08:34] I tell you I was in a high atmosphere in
[1:08:37] society I was there as a judge
[1:08:43] would someone call you a doctor and
[1:08:45] you'd get inflated
[1:08:50] you like like you look like a toad when
[1:08:53] it inflates itself
[1:08:57] but when God takes you to the altar yes
[1:09:00] it takes the wind out of you yeah
[1:09:04] you realize
[1:09:07] you're a miserable sinner
[1:09:11] when God had mercy of
[1:09:33] we are nobody
[1:09:37] is
[1:09:42] the Bible says
[1:09:50] damn he also glorified
[1:09:53] is that correct
[1:09:55] we have our we are already typical we're
[1:09:58] Justified
[1:09:59] we are glorified potential potentially
[1:10:03] yes
[1:10:06] God is glorified
[1:10:10] foreign
[1:10:16] for him to come for us
[1:10:21] but we won't leave with these coats that
[1:10:23] we have on
[1:10:26] this has to be left here is
[1:10:33] saying hurry up hurry up
[1:10:48] the transformed body
[1:10:53] is
[1:11:00] if we justify them we are already
[1:11:03] glorified
[1:11:04] in his State
[1:11:06] not that he will do it
[1:11:09] he has already glorious
[1:11:12] listen to this
[1:11:14] isn't it
[1:11:18] that is
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:30] potentially we are already there there's
[1:11:34] no devil nothing no no nothing that can
[1:11:36] take it
[1:11:37] what do we wait for people waiting for
[1:11:41] the last one to enter it has been
[1:11:44] predestinated for us I want to go
[1:11:52] who's holding back here if I come here
[1:11:55] you're not comfortable in any place
[1:12:01] this Earth is no longer for us
[1:12:06] we have to yearn the correct and the
[1:12:09] that which is perfect
[1:12:16] you have made you a father
[1:12:19] no I will do it is already done it
[1:12:24] is
[1:12:27] I've done it in in your old age
[1:12:33] you're saved
[1:12:35] I have already done it
[1:12:37] I have said it
[1:12:41] you have nothing to do with it it is
[1:12:45] unconditional
[1:12:46] got determined to have his church
[1:12:50] each time
[1:13:02] can I break with his Covenant with men
[1:13:06] those have been called to this message
[1:13:09] it is because they are Bride of the Lamb
[1:13:14] within that college
[1:13:16] classes there are three kinds of
[1:13:19] Believers
[1:13:20] God needs
[1:13:23] to put the unbelievers
[1:13:29] to prove our love
[1:13:31] to prove our patience
[1:14:05] it all has a purpose
[1:14:11] When God says he's done something
[1:14:15] cannot wait
[1:14:16] for it to be done
[1:14:21] when man says he will do it no
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:26] is
[1:14:28] it is not being done well anymore
[1:14:33] because God fulfills what he says
[1:14:38] well he promises
[1:14:47] I'll see you at 8 in the morning at the
[1:14:49] bank to give you a blessing
[1:14:53] you wait for him all day brother what
[1:14:55] happened I forgot
[1:14:59] God does not do that
[1:15:03] before you get there God is already
[1:15:05] there
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:11] I told Abraham I will say
[1:15:14] and Abraham
[1:15:17] not only Abraham
[1:15:22] unconditionally foreign
[1:15:58] foreign
[1:16:46] the confidence of God towards his
[1:16:48] children
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:18] you say this is what the word says this
[1:17:21] is what the prophet says
[1:17:22] and you you don't change
[1:17:28] and you always say thus saith the Lord
[1:17:39] knows where he stands he knows where the
[1:17:42] end of it is
[1:18:34] but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:19:05] I had the opportunity to forgive him in
[1:19:08] time
[1:19:13] so God had glorified whom he had
[1:19:16] Justified
[1:19:22] glorification that fills me with joy
[1:19:25] that I'm glorious
[1:19:27] that is a step to be a Christian
[1:19:32] and you are Justified of all of your
[1:19:34] future
[1:19:37] he glorified the church increased in
[1:19:40] Christ
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:51] you are glorified in Christ in Christ
[1:19:54] but what by what God is
[1:19:56] he already paid for history
[1:19:58] he dressed his bride
[1:20:01] he determined again
[1:20:06] he doesn't have to be worried to see
[1:20:08] who's missing yes
[1:20:10] we are already Justified
[1:20:13] we are already glorified
[1:20:16] we are now the church
[1:20:19] ready for the Rapture that we await
[1:20:33] you have to have your own convictions
[1:20:36] now the pastor will remind you who you
[1:20:39] are but you have to know who you are
[1:20:45] Corinthians so that we can be close
[1:20:55] perfecto
[1:20:58] entrance
[1:21:03] but when that which is perfect has come
[1:21:05] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:21:07] away
[1:21:08] brother says
[1:21:10] by the grace of God
[1:21:13] what we have now is it is perfect
[1:21:20] don't wait for another person the
[1:21:23] message is the perfect
[1:21:26] Nino
[1:21:33] when I was a child I spake as a child
[1:21:36] understood
[1:21:42] when I became a man
[1:21:45] I put away each other things
[1:21:56] but then face to face
[1:22:00] now I know in Parts foreign
[1:22:20] and where we are going back to
[1:22:23] foreign
[1:22:40] they said we ever investigations
[1:22:45] her pastor told her don't worry you're a
[1:22:48] church member you're fine don't don't
[1:22:50] worry about it
[1:22:52] but when death came uh
[1:22:56] she began to tell the shout
[1:23:00] you did not tell me the truth
[1:23:02] you deceive me
[1:23:06] and now I am going to hell
[1:23:09] because you did not conduct to the
[1:23:12] correct way
[1:23:14] but we think universe that the bride has
[1:23:18] a pastor she has a prophet she has Jesus
[1:23:23] Christ she has eternal life she has all
[1:23:27] of the word amen amen
[1:23:41] as your father who is in heaven is
[1:23:43] perfect
[1:23:46] how could you at one time be perfect
[1:23:50] before the eyes of Christ
[1:23:52] in this moment
[1:23:57] as perfect
[1:23:59] as Christ is
[1:24:02] God only sees Christ
[1:24:05] he says
[1:24:07] the
[1:24:09] firstborn is Perfecto he is perfect
[1:24:15] his brothers are perfect
[1:24:20] they receive the same blood as my son
[1:24:25] and that's what has the devil's surprise
[1:24:30] because when when Jesus came Jesus
[1:24:35] Jesus he rebuked Satan
[1:24:38] but William Branham
[1:24:41] he curse Satan
[1:24:47] in turn says
[1:24:53] someone that is
[1:24:55] as much authority
[1:24:58] of God
[1:25:01] and you and all believers
[1:25:04] you have the same Authority as Jesus
[1:25:15] Christ
[1:25:22] I am in him I am perfect
[1:25:27] before the eyes of God
[1:25:31] I don't want any more complaints
[1:25:35] I don't have any money
[1:25:39] I'm not from here from there I'm not
[1:25:41] that
[1:25:45] much
[1:25:48] but now that you're a man recognize your
[1:25:50] position
[1:26:00] my brother and my friend
[1:26:03] Ultimo
[1:26:06] hey
[1:26:08] we'll read uh one more extract yes
[1:26:12] and we'll be closing by the grace of the
[1:26:14] Lord
[1:26:20] be reading Revelation chapter 10.
[1:26:24] verse 10 and 11.
[1:26:35] um
[1:26:40] flew by we had to let go of some
[1:26:42] scriptures
[1:26:46] de lang
[1:26:48] and I took the little book out of the
[1:26:50] Angel's hand
[1:26:54] eat it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:26:57] as honey
[1:27:00] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[1:27:03] was bitter
[1:27:06] when you get the little book from the
[1:27:08] age of Tomah and you eat it
[1:27:12] and you begin to obey it
[1:27:15] it is sweet to hear it
[1:27:21] oh how good
[1:27:24] but on Monday try to live it see if you
[1:27:27] can
[1:27:30] bitter
[1:27:32] again to the belly
[1:27:44] he said unto me thou must prophecy again
[1:27:47] before many peoples
[1:27:53] repeating and hearing constantly the
[1:27:55] word of the prophets
[1:27:59] it is the only way that you can digest
[1:28:03] well you have not been able to live
[1:28:06] how can you digest something you haven't
[1:28:09] eaten
[1:28:12] you see on the table it has no effect on
[1:28:15] you
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:34] and those were that's where birth pains
[1:28:37] begin to happen
[1:28:40] now we are the children of God
[1:28:45] when are we the children of God
[1:28:47] now
[1:28:50] means present time
[1:28:54] now we are seated in Heavenly places I
[1:28:58] believe it is
[1:29:04] and the service is not to hear things of
[1:29:06] the world but it's it's to hear these
[1:29:08] things
[1:29:09] now the holy spirit is here
[1:29:13] I don't see him oh I see him
[1:29:29] and now he used me today to be able to
[1:29:32] speak to you
[1:29:34] now we are the children now
[1:29:38] we are seated
[1:29:43] now the holy spirit is here
[1:30:02] but he uses your mouth
[1:30:05] foreign
[1:30:33] to all of his word
[1:31:14] thus saith the Lord
[1:31:17] is that
[1:31:22] Psalms 1 6.
[1:31:27] for the Lord knows the way of the
[1:31:29] righteousness
[1:31:31] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[1:31:35] he knows who we are
[1:31:39] and those that are wrong
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:47] and we'll prepare to close
[1:31:50] Romans chapter 8.
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:13] all of the word
[1:32:18] now emotions
[1:32:23] you hear things and you have to shout
[1:32:27] and there's times they send you to the
[1:32:29] altareness
[1:32:30] and there's times it makes you think
[1:32:36] that is the diet that the Lord gives us
[1:32:38] daily
[1:32:42] whose shall separate us from the love of
[1:32:45] Christ
[1:32:46] and the Lord gives us options
[1:32:50] shall tribulation
[1:32:52] or distress
[1:32:55] or persecution
[1:33:00] nakedness
[1:33:07] what will separate when this comes
[1:33:12] what can separate you from the Lord
[1:33:15] if by God I have it all
[1:33:19] possible
[1:34:07] his faith
[1:35:01] oh you're doing it right
[1:35:04] and as as the toad you you get inflated
[1:35:10] but it's better for them to tell you
[1:35:13] something that will make yourself and
[1:35:16] remind you who you are and what you
[1:35:20] represent
[1:35:22] ative verse 37.
[1:35:29] now in all these things we are more than
[1:35:31] conquerors
[1:35:33] through him that loved us
[1:35:37] it's not you who overcomes
[1:35:40] he is the overcomer
[1:36:08] or any other creature
[1:36:10] griada
[1:36:13] nor any other creatures
[1:36:18] from the love of God
[1:36:23] and your voice which is in Christ Jesus
[1:36:26] our lord and if we may stand
[1:36:31] we thank the Lord
[1:36:33] to be able to remember these things
[1:36:36] and we've heard them
[1:36:39] and although Peter said although we know
[1:36:43] it doesn't hurt us to cure them again
[1:36:48] what it makes our spiritual life grow
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:52] and once again if you have a petition
[1:36:58] something that you need help from the
[1:37:00] Lord
[1:37:02] simply follow the prayers
[1:37:05] and God will give us that right
[1:37:09] loving Heavenly Father
[1:37:16] or your blessed word that we have spoken
[1:37:19] today
[1:37:22] for your sons and daughters gathered in
[1:37:25] the sanctuary

[1:37:40] of this privilege from us here once
[1:37:46] again your Eternal Word
[1:37:50] or nothing can harm us
[1:37:53] and the Apostle Paul said
[1:37:57] that our present things that are to come
[1:38:00] sickness
[1:38:03] nothing can separate all the youth is
[1:38:07] increased from the love of God which is
[1:38:10] nothing hinders
[1:38:22] there's not enough
[1:38:25] there's not enough Devils
[1:38:29] that can hinder the resurrection
