[34:44] nor yet in jerusalem worship the
[34:58] we know what we worship for salvation is

[37:48] you didn't know that
[37:52] he said and those that are in the grave
[37:55] shall hear the voice
[38:00] when did you hear the voice of the
[38:02] messiah
[38:05] you heard the voice when you were in the

[38:41] jesus said i who speak to you am
[38:49] not even in this mountain or in
[38:51] jerusalem will you worship the father
[38:54] in jerusalem
[38:57] but the hour is coming
[39:00] when jesus was here one of jesus
[39:03] he prophesied the prophet he preached
[39:08] he did miracles
[39:10] and the scriptures identified him
[39:15] and the people rejected him
[39:20] so he preached then after they rejected
[39:22] him
[39:26] because he when he was preaching there
[39:28] was a possibility of anybody being saved
[39:36] but after the days of his preaching
[39:40] his
[40:05] [Applause]
[40:08] now judgment isn't going on right now
[40:13] because there is no burning hell okay
[40:16] [Music]
[40:18] now either you wait through hell here
[40:22] espera a
[40:36] don't you live in hell here no vive
[40:40] it's nothing but hell out there
[40:45] fires have seen are all around us
[40:50] and the natural times the spiritual
[40:53] natural typical spiritual you have never
[40:56] seen so many forest fires in your life
[41:02] the fires in new mexico los and nova
[41:05] mexico they say they are as big as the
[41:08] whole state of rhode island
[41:12] rhode island
[41:13] so why are there so many forest fires
[41:16] porque tantos incendios
[41:19] i went i called my daughter in phoenix
[41:23] in phoenix i said i don't go i don't
[41:25] have to go to phoenix to stand all that
[41:28] hit like you have in phoenix
[41:30] but
[41:32] support
[41:47] go to phoenix and i'm already in there
[41:52] the heat there was a man in phoenix
[41:55] and phoenix he said i'm not gonna waste
[41:57] electricity or natural gas to do my
[42:00] cooking
[42:15] his eggs and he's sausage and he cooked
[42:17] his nose
[42:25] very wise man
[42:26] amen
[42:27] so then
[42:30] that is a place of torment
[42:35] and since the devil rules all the world
[42:41] so it's hell up here
[42:56] but sometimes we act so holy and pious
[43:00] actor
[43:02] you said i have the holy ghost
[43:06] well let me ask you the question
[43:09] did the apostle
[43:17] do you have the spirit of the father
[43:23] because an hour is coming
[43:38] i wish i had the time to go into what
[43:40] i'm going to say here
[43:45] but i don't have that time today
[43:48] you know but hopefully next time i can
[43:49] go into it
[43:52] do you know that the law is spiritual
[43:57] spiritual paul said
[44:00] i find the law encuentro
[44:03] that when i will do good evil is
[44:19] everyone sitting here
[44:21] every day you have an evil thought
[44:29] you don't plan it
[44:31] is satan putting obstacles in front of
[44:34] you
[44:46] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[44:51] amen amen that's the job of saying
[44:55] is the job of satan
[44:58] and brother says
[45:01] this late hour it is
[45:27] you are going to be troubled by a carnal
[45:31] nature
[45:33] in problems
[45:37] that is going to bother you every day
[45:40] until you die
[45:44] so there's a carnal nature in you are
[45:46] you ayuna naturalessa de carne
[45:49] you know why there is a carnal nature in
[45:51] you
[45:54] because when the serpent came out of
[45:56] that
[45:58] of their water
[46:41] a wounded serpent is the most dangerous
[46:44] animal
[46:48] he's all around us
[46:50] he's here when we come to church
[46:54] and because that's what gives the carnal
[46:56] nature
[47:00] i ask the question
[47:03] do all of you have a guardian angel to
[47:07] guard you those who stand
[47:20] how can you have a guardian angel
[47:36] a sinner does not have a guardian angel
[47:41] because the angels of god los angeles
[47:45] around those that fear him
[47:50] so if you don't have a guardian angel
[47:53] i
[47:54] beg you to repent the speedo
[47:59] how many times were on the road
[48:04] and if it wasn't for a guardian angel
[48:05] republic
[48:06] hit somebody head-on
[48:18] i gotta confess something
[48:20] a confession you know
[48:23] years ago
[48:25] maybe about seven eight years ago
[48:29] you know what ronnie i was going up a
[48:31] one-way street
[48:47] there was a red light
[48:49] coming on a one-way street you know
[48:52] there one way this way and one way the
[48:54] other way
[48:58] you know i was going yo eva
[49:00] and
[49:14] thank god there was a
[49:17] the little the sidewalk i would turn
[49:19] around on the sidewalk and up there too
[49:21] for there was an office of i don't know
[49:23] what graciasmus
[49:27] god
[49:28] taking care of my ignorance
[49:32] ignorance you know i guess i had must
[49:34] have blacked out something you know
[49:40] i was working in the open pit
[49:42] in
[49:57] el camino and you know you many
[50:00] drivers on the holly trucks have gone
[50:02] down those berms and killed themselves
[50:08] i it was in the dead of
[50:11] it was so hard
[50:14] and the motors of those trucks are so
[50:17] big
[50:19] and those trucks didn't have
[50:21] ac
[50:36] i was about this close to the burn out
[50:38] of hidden
[51:40] [Music]
[51:47] you
[51:58] [Music]
[52:02] turn the tv on maybe change the channels
[52:10] when i sing at home even the cockroaches
[52:12] get scared
[52:14] god bless you yes
[52:16] but the lord gave me something greater
[52:20] the lord gave me something greater than
[52:21] any instrument
[52:26] you pray for me
[52:29] amen
[52:31] let's amen on going
[52:34] you know that
[52:36] your body is seen
[52:40] don't try to perfect your body no
[52:43] perfection
[52:44] so when you're born you are a sinner by
[52:46] nature
[52:49] and the sinner has to stand judgmental
[52:55] and christ stood god's judgment
[53:12] or not
[53:26] you are free from judgment esta libre de
[53:28] juicio because if god will look down on
[53:31] this earth
[53:34] in his condition now
[53:37] or any other way
[53:40] then
[53:42] [Applause]
[53:54] i don't care in what condition some of
[53:57] you are no important condition
[54:01] if you are doing your thing
[54:05] if you are in drugs
[54:07] if you like liquor it is and you only
[54:10] come to church whenever you feel like it
[54:13] is

[54:27] your sins
[54:31] hope
[54:33] i hope that you give your life to christ
[54:36] today
[54:50] you will have to give an account
[54:53] some of you
[54:54] know baby you have to give an account
[54:57] today
[55:02] search i'm not saying that god said that
[55:07] maybe if it be so
[55:10] that today
[55:12] is your day of reckoning
[55:17] how do you know that you'll be here on
[55:19] this earth tomorrow
[55:23] you don't know about tomorrow
[55:27] we only know who holds tomorrow
[55:34] but the minute your soul leaves your
[55:37] body
[55:40] you have passed over mercy into judgment
[55:45] first timothy 3
[55:50] and without controversy great is the
[55:53] mystery of godliness
[55:55] god was manifest in the flesh justified
[55:58] in the spirit scene of angels preached
[56:01] unto the gentiles believed on in the
[56:04] world received off into glory in
[56:06] description
[56:19] can you see that godliness is a mystery
[56:26] revelation 10 7.
[56:28] apocalypse siete
[56:30] but in the days of the voice of the
[56:32] seven angel
[56:34] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[56:38] of god should be finished as he had
[56:42] declared to his servants of prophets
[56:55] should there be any mysteries amongst
[56:58] this congregation
[57:03] you had the best
[57:05] teacher of this message
[57:10] where would you hit the founding pastor
[57:12] was
[57:13] hitting on all eight cylinders
[57:21] and you hear the teachings that come
[57:23] behind here
[57:26] you'll see these young ministers on the
[57:29] panel the way they minister estus
[57:31] ministers
[57:35] what mysteries let me tell you
[57:40] romans 16 25. romano's he says
[57:44] benticinco
[57:45] not to him there is a power to establish
[57:48] you according to my gospel
[57:51] and the preaching of jesus christ
[57:54] according to the revelation of the
[57:56] mystery which was kept secret since the
[58:00] world begins
[58:16] there is no excuse
[58:18] but now is made manifest and by the
[58:21] scriptures of the prophets according to
[58:24] the commandments on the everlasting god
[58:27] made known to all of you for the
[58:29] obedience of the revelation of faith
[58:49] it's a previous previously hidden truth
[58:54] now divinely revealed
[58:58] with a supernatural element
[59:08] [Music]
[59:16] in christ so that he could clean the
[59:18] church
[59:21] in order to get it into for fellowship
[59:28] because he dwelt along along with the
[59:30] cherubim's cherubims
[59:33] you and i were in his thinking in the
[59:35] beginning
[59:38] and the only thing we are is an
[59:41] expression word
[59:58] you become a son or daughter
[1:00:02] notice in the beginning was the word
[1:00:07] but before it was word it was attributed
[1:00:18] in the beginning was the expression in
[1:00:21] the principle expression the word
[1:00:24] so those that worship god must worship
[1:00:26] him
[1:00:53] this was a state when abraham met
[1:00:57] melchizedek
[1:01:02] he was in the form of theophany in the
[1:01:04] form of
[1:01:05] something that you could not see
[1:01:37] the angels of god are here los angeles
[1:01:42] he is here in the form of spirit
[1:01:45] in the form of the spirit and then he
[1:01:47] comes in the form of
[1:01:49] morphine
[1:02:05] he will tell us all things declaration
[1:02:10] i am he who talks to you
[1:02:15] if this earthly body be dissolved
[1:02:55] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[1:02:59] will do in the final end
[1:03:13] will absolutely do the same thing
[1:03:16] absolutely
[1:03:18] now we see the air tributes
[1:03:21] the sons of his spirit
[1:03:25] have not yet entered into the word
[1:03:42] waiting for the earnest change of the
[1:03:45] body esperando por las arras el cambio
[1:03:48] del cuerpo now the difference between
[1:03:50] him and you as a son the difference
[1:03:55] he was at the beginning the word el
[1:03:58] estaban el principio la palabra
[1:04:04] in morphe he came and lived
[1:04:06] in the person of melchizedek
[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:24] because in that form it is a form he
[1:04:27] knowed all things elsa
[1:04:30] and you have never been able to know
[1:04:32] that yet
[1:04:35] because you come just like adam
[1:05:19] [Applause]
[1:05:33] but you see in order to stem temptation
[1:05:45] we have not yet the bodies
[1:05:48] but when this body receives the spirit
[1:05:51] of god
[1:05:52] receiving the spiritual the immortal
[1:05:55] life inside of you
[1:05:59] it throws this body in subjection to god
[1:06:06] first john 3 9.
[1:06:10] whosoever is born of god does not commit
[1:06:13] sin
[1:06:14] for his seed remaineth in him
[1:06:17] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:06:20] god
[1:06:29] how can you sing
[1:06:43] i plant the seed in you
[1:06:49] and then we see these wonderful
[1:06:51] preachers that we have
[1:06:55] which i could preach like them
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:12] romans 8 1 romanos ocho uno
[1:07:16] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:07:19] to them which are in christ jesus
[1:07:22] who will walk as not after the flesh but
[1:07:24] after the spirit
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:55] all ready started
[1:07:58] the people are waiting for the rapture
[1:08:01] el pueblos
[1:08:04] i've been in the rapture
[1:08:07] since i accepted this message
[1:08:34] and they say well that's jesus christ
[1:09:04] to the souls
[1:09:15] those that are in the grave are not the
[1:09:17] ones that are dead
[1:09:32] the ones that are there that are walking
[1:09:34] and when you go to walmart or to target
[1:09:36] you walk among them those are the deaths
[1:09:44] but the hour comes
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:10:00] i heard
[1:10:13] foreign
[1:10:26] and you know what the voice of archangel
[1:10:27] is
[1:10:40] they first used to say that it was jesus
[1:10:42] christ
[1:10:45] i mean you people are not so nice
[1:10:52] you know you cannot
[1:10:54] take jesus christ off
[1:10:56] the
[1:11:10] it was jesus
[1:11:24] william branham and then in the
[1:11:26] condensation
[1:11:32] again
[1:11:34] because brother venom did not come to
[1:11:36] you
[1:11:52] so you never can take jesus christ
[1:11:56] especially if he lives in your heart
[1:12:01] a place aaron for my father
[1:12:05] happy father's day
[1:12:12] jimmy you
[1:12:13] you started like that and and all of a
[1:12:15] sudden you wanna go that way
[1:12:20] the world is so rich
[1:12:24] and what god gives me i love to give to
[1:12:27] you people
[1:12:31] so then the rapture is here
[1:12:35] do you know that when elijah was picked
[1:12:38] up in the chariot
[1:12:42] elisha said
[1:12:46] because elijah said what do you want
[1:13:29] elijah fell
[1:13:33] he took that cloak
[1:13:36] went to the river jordan
[1:13:42] and he took it and he threw it on the
[1:13:44] water
[1:13:59] of thomas perez
[1:14:01] man
[1:14:04] god was not only god of william branham
[1:14:06] god was not only god
[1:14:08] william branham god was not the only
[1:14:12] the
[1:14:23] amen amen
[1:14:28] the earnest of the resurrection
[1:14:31] resurrection what is it yes
[1:14:34] this body will be raised again
[1:14:38] because it already started
[1:15:22] in the flesh
[1:15:29] first corinthians 15 45.
[1:15:35] and we'll turn the corner here
[1:15:41] so it is written the first man adam was
[1:15:44] made a living soul the last adam was
[1:15:47] made of quickening spirit
[1:15:50] acetaminophen
[1:16:00] which is spiritual but that which is
[1:16:03] natural and after that that which is
[1:16:06] spiritual maslow spiritual es primeros
[1:16:11] spiritual
[1:16:13] the first man is of the earth earthly
[1:16:16] the second man is the lord from heaven
[1:16:29] is the heavenly such are they also there
[1:16:32] are heavenly
[1:16:38] and as we have borne the image of the
[1:16:41] earth we shall also bear the image of
[1:16:44] the heavenly yes
[1:17:00] let's find out
[1:17:02] so aaron became a living soul
[1:17:08] so what happened
[1:17:11] god who formed the heavens and the earth
[1:17:22] [Music]
[1:17:27] and everything took its right position
[1:17:35] what do you think
[1:17:36] when the pastor gets behind here
[1:17:42] sufficiently
[1:18:24] everything came in its right position
[1:18:28] the earth
[1:18:30] the moon the luna the stars
[1:18:33] planets
[1:18:35] all swung into their place
[1:18:50] because your spirit is in your heart
[1:18:55] and you had your spirit before you ever
[1:18:58] came to this world
[1:19:02] and they they take the scripture from
[1:19:04] genesis too you know
[1:19:10] what kind of breath was he breathing
[1:19:15] respirato
[1:19:16] before that god breathed
[1:19:19] this breath of life into him
[1:19:34] if that be so see
[1:19:37] then every animal is a living soul
[1:19:41] animal
[1:19:42] because they breathe a human soul
[1:19:47] then jesus would not have to die jesus
[1:19:51] because the animal sacrifice would have
[1:19:53] been sufficient
[1:19:57] now animals breathe the wind los angeles
[1:20:02] which
[1:20:18] still love the things of the world
[1:20:24] then you are not a living soul
[1:20:28] you are breathing what the devil
[1:20:44] is
[1:21:40] the breath of eternal life
[1:21:44] and he became a living soul
[1:21:49] a soul that cannot die
[1:21:52] well you see
[1:21:54] if
[1:22:07] god had provided a lamb
[1:22:12] to redeem him
[1:22:14] god had to provide the lamb
[1:22:19] because already in his nostrils
[1:22:49] jesus never preached a funeral jesus
[1:22:54] but an hour is coming
[1:23:00] on this mountain
[1:23:02] or this city
[1:23:18] well you say that was for them
[1:23:23] and i said it was for you
[1:23:24] foreign
[1:23:34] the
[1:23:36] the man that was possessed by legion the
[1:23:39] gathering
[1:23:45] says
[1:23:48] he would hide behind the tombstones the
[1:23:50] tombstones
[1:23:56] so don't exo holy empires
[1:24:00] all of you
[1:24:14] and you blame only the man with the head
[1:24:16] the legion
[1:24:20] oh
[1:24:20] when i was a young guy
[1:24:24] and i like
[1:24:25] i'm confessing
[1:24:28] and i liked a girl gustavo muchacha
[1:24:31] and most girls were catholic
[1:24:36] so they invited me to church
[1:24:42] i wouldn't go to see jesus i go to see
[1:24:45] mary
[1:24:51] untruthful
[1:24:54] so then
[1:24:56] as then you you you i start going to the
[1:25:00] tombstone
[1:25:03] that said baptist
[1:25:08] bautista
[1:25:10] i would hide behind the baptist
[1:25:12] tombstone
[1:25:18] and finally
[1:25:21] i went and hid
[1:25:24] behind the apostolic tombstone
[1:25:30] apostolica the invaluable says all those
[1:25:32] denominations are dead
[1:25:37] and should be buried then when the
[1:25:39] ceremonies
[1:25:40] and the is nothing but blasphemous names
[1:25:44] he says
[1:25:46] they are churches with
[1:25:48] their
[1:25:49] their doctrines are without foundation
[1:25:54] amen
[1:25:55] now
[1:25:57] why seek the living amongst the dead
[1:26:02] now the breath of life and respiratory
[1:26:06] that adam received
[1:26:09] is different it's different than when a
[1:26:13] baby is born
[1:26:17] let's see which one are you a young girl
[1:26:22] why did the spirit of adam was different
[1:26:25] to when a baby is born
[1:26:32] when a baby is born is he not a living
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:47] and then he breathed the breath
[1:26:50] the and he became a living song
[1:26:56] have you ever thought why a baby that is
[1:26:59] born
[1:27:00] he is not a living soul yeah
[1:27:29] only the sin of his father
[1:27:58] because when
[1:28:20] when the baby's in the womb of the
[1:28:22] mother
[1:28:25] it's only begotten
[1:28:28] it's only begun
[1:28:36] so as as a christian as we get older
[1:28:39] christians
[1:28:54] they say that you are what you eat
[1:28:59] but it should be you supposed to eat
[1:29:01] what you are
[1:29:02] saying
[1:29:08] so you to eat a diet
[1:29:12] comparable with your blood type
[1:29:18] so you can see that the animals are more
[1:29:20] intelligent than us
[1:29:22] animals
[1:29:35] how many lions do we have in this
[1:29:37] congregation
[1:29:39] congregation don't raise your hand chuck
[1:29:42] no levantes
[1:29:45] don't raise your hand roster carlos
[1:29:50] carlos
[1:29:52] i know in my house my daughter there's
[1:29:54] no meat there's no food in the house you
[1:29:56] say in me
[1:29:58] in la casa she takes after my mother
[1:30:04] and how many you you gotta have meet uh
[1:30:10] so i can see we have a lot of lions and
[1:30:12] lionesses
[1:30:13] in this congregation
[1:30:28] there's me that's fine if there's not
[1:30:29] that's fine i'll eat what there is
[1:30:32] that's my what my wife used to say to
[1:30:34] some of these sisters
[1:30:39] that's why i love my husband
[1:30:42] whatever i put on the table
[1:30:46] i
[1:30:58] if i was your wife i left you silly
[1:31:27] you tried to fit an apple or a carrot
[1:31:32] to the lion
[1:31:34] a leon he won't need it
[1:31:36] other animals buying sting otros animals
[1:31:39] for instinct will not eat meat no comedy
[1:31:58] humans including los humanos the problem
[1:32:01] is the problem is he is a problem you
[1:32:04] humans
[1:32:06] said humans are so domesticated
[1:32:10] domesticated
[1:32:25] it solo comment what is instantly
[1:32:29] good for them
[1:32:36] listen to me
[1:32:38] is a result
[1:32:41] the animals don't go to the hospital for
[1:32:44] diabetes or heart problems or
[1:32:47] or whatever
[1:32:49] hospital
[1:32:52] humans
[1:33:17] heart disease diabetes and other
[1:33:20] diseases problems diabetes
[1:33:23] is virtually non-existent in animals
[1:33:26] virtually non-existent in los angeles
[1:33:28] and notice nothing most animals die
[1:33:31] around the same age
[1:33:45] and allow them to live to the potential
[1:33:47] of the species
[1:33:52] another thing most animals not killed by
[1:33:54] predators
[1:33:59] they die of old age or natural causes
[1:34:02] wherein
[1:34:47] raise your hands
[1:34:50] you would not raise your hands
[1:34:54] i've hit that road jack
[1:34:56] before
[1:35:12] too i'm i'm turning the corner but i
[1:35:14] gotta give a testimony
[1:35:19] and uh
[1:35:21] give me about
[1:35:22] seven eight minutes and half
[1:35:28] first danny martinez here danny martin
[1:35:31] martinez
[1:35:33] oh just leave him alone i don't need him
[1:35:35] no no necesito
[1:35:37] there was this young couple
[1:35:40] hoben
[1:35:45] and they had come from california
[1:35:48] california and they were this a little
[1:35:52] they were in their 30s he and his wife
[1:36:08] they would go to the parking hatch
[1:36:12] and uh
[1:36:14] they he would take his guitar in a
[1:36:16] little amplifier
[1:36:20] and they would sing he and his wife
[1:36:24] and then he would preach to them
[1:36:27] so then he told him once when he was
[1:36:29] giving him in her catering head
[1:36:34] he said i have a brother church that
[1:36:37] would like to talk to you
[1:36:42] no i never i didn't know who they were
[1:36:44] you know
[1:36:46] so they lived in rincon
[1:36:49] in rincon so
[1:36:51] we went to their house
[1:36:54] they received us real well
[1:36:57] but i noticed
[1:37:00] we were around the table
[1:37:04] and i was answering their questions
[1:37:07] they took turns
[1:37:10] one would leave the kitchen and go into
[1:37:12] the garage
[1:37:16] then he would come back
[1:37:18] and then the
[1:37:32] so when the husband went to the garage
[1:37:35] the wife said they're between me and
[1:37:38] danny
[1:37:43] he said uh
[1:37:45] is it wrong to smoke
[1:37:49] and then is it wrong to smoke marijuana
[1:37:52] esta fumar marijuana oh
[1:37:57] in her face
[1:38:00] that means her
[1:38:28] her she looked at us like this
[1:38:33] and she would look at danny
[1:38:36] she would look at me
[1:38:38] and she it was not her voice
[1:38:41] a voice came from inside
[1:39:27] as a result of our improper diets
[1:39:33] so our immune system fails to operate
[1:39:36] properly
[1:39:41] and we become susceptible to diseases
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:39:47] so the inspiration of the holy ghost is
[1:39:49] here the inspiration of spirit
[1:39:52] to
[1:40:06] sin you know
[1:40:08] or if they want to sin
[1:40:11] that's what you are
[1:40:13] but use if you say you're a christian
[1:40:16] christian and you believe it
[1:40:19] god will make your body obey your
[1:40:21] confession
[1:40:24] so when a man is inspired
[1:40:28] and here is the inspired word
[1:40:33] the two
[1:40:34] inspirations together as those
[1:40:36] inspirations
[1:40:37] gives a result
[1:40:40] so no matter how well you study the
[1:40:43] words
[1:40:46] it will never do you no good
[1:41:13] and then the word being brought into the
[1:41:16] spirit of inspiration
[1:41:21] then miracles will happen
[1:41:25] when the two inspirations come together
[1:41:28] when those inspirations
[1:41:55] especially which was the material we got
[1:41:58] here
[1:42:23] go ahead and play something
[1:42:30] is there anybody here ayali naki
[1:42:36] they they need a touch from the lord
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:55] [Music]

[1:43:08] the world is inspired
[1:43:11] it's been preached
[1:43:13] now it's in your hands
[1:43:19] cause the hour is coming
[1:43:22] and now
