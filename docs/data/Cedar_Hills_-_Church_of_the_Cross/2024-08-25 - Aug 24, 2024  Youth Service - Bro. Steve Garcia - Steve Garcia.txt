many are ready for the word tonight this afternoon the reason and we've all come amen it's a privilege and an honor to introduce our brother Steven Garcia to bring us Words of Life how many are excited [Applause] tonight and I just feel like something good is about to happen oh I just feel like something good is on its way oh he I promised that he'd open all of Heaven oh and brother it could be this very day oh when God's people humble themselves and call on Jesus oh when they look to Heaven expecting as they pray I just feel like something good is about to H happen and brother it could be this very [Music] day God bless you hear me my name is uh brother Steven Garcia or brother Steve you call me either way um I come from Phoenix Arizona I never thought that I would be here in this uh position that I find myself in today but um the call came here we are and so I just ask that you bear with me um let's go straight into the Scripture it is Deuteronomy 30: 15-6 when you have it please say Amen and it reads like this see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whether thou goest to possess it you could bow your heads let's pray Lord heavenly father I thank you Lord God for the opp opportunity to be here and the trust that you put in me Lord God to be standing before your children you know how I feel about being up here Lord you know what I think of myself Lord God but as your word says father it's time to die to self it's not about what I think it's about what you think it's not what I say it's what you say and so I place myself aside father help me to get out of the way help me to put myself out of the way and to impart whatever you would have for your children tonight Lord I Thank You and I necess that your children can open their hearts to receive whatever you have for them we love you Lord and we thank you for all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be seated so as it reads in uh verse 16 it says he's he set before us different options he says there's life and good and there's death and Evil and so today you have to make choice of whom you're going to serve right who shall you serve this day it's your choice today are you going to choose life and good or you going to choose death and evil and if you choose the life and you choose the good there's things that come along with it but the Lord says that here that he will bless thee in the land whether thou goest to possess it and so how are we going to possess this land well let's read here in Luke 22 ver 24-27 and it says now a dispute also arose among them as to which of them was regarded to be the greatest Jesus said to them the kings of the Gentiles have absolute power and Lord it over them and those in authority over them are called benefactors but it is not to be this way with you on the contrary the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest and the leader like the servant for who is the greater the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves is it not the one who reclines at the table but I am among you the Lord Jesus Christ is among you as the one who serves so he's setting the example for us right there where Jesus Christ the God God himself come down in human flesh God of all glory the creator of Heaven and Earth the creator of everything that we can see and he's saying that he comes as the one who serves how much more should we as human beings be willing to put ourselves in the place of a servant and to give ourselves to serve others and so in Matthew 18: 1-5 I don't have this um I didn't give this to them up there but it says at that time the disciples came to Jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and calling to him a child he put him in the midst of them and said truly I say it to you unless you turn and become like children you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven whoever receives one such child in my name receives me so what he's saying here is that what the world calls great is actually the opposite in the Kingdom of Heaven A lot of times we think well who who's great oh the the the guy who's you know standing in front of millions of people maybe the president or maybe uh Jeff Bezos or some billionaire who they they have all these things that you could ever think of anything that we desire in our flesh that we would ever want these people have it and that's what a lot of people in the the world they think of as great well he's a great speaker he knows how to articulate himself and he's so intelligent and he has all this money and he has all these things that I only wish that I could have but what greatness is in the Kingdom of Heaven is making yourself as low as you can be it says to make yourself as a child and it's not to put children down saying that they're beneath us but it's trying to get us to to see a point here that children in nature they're free from in nature children are humble they're willing to learn and most of all they're willing to be dependent on their parents but as we grow the problem is that we get bad habits because we we grow up and as as part of becoming part of this world we realize that we have to go to school we have to go to work to be able to make a living these are things that we are unavoidable and in doing so we come in contact with things that we don't want to see we come in contact things with things that are not beneficial to us and we start picking up little bits and pieces here and there well look at this guy he has this and maybe uh if it's okay for him to do this well maybe I can do it too maybe I should uh be a little more uh Arrogant with my my chest out you know because you know that guy he gets all the ladies or something but what Jesus is telling us here is that we have to be humble and he showed us how we should become by being the example he didn't just say it he lived the life and ultimately what he's saying is we have to Humble self and I like to make a distinction that I there's there's to me there's a difference between self and what I like to call or what my pastor has taught me to call selfie where self is the person who wants to do good self is the one inside of you making the decisions trying to do what's right but selfie which is this guy right here which is the nature the old nature he wants to do what he wants to do he wants to be selfish he wants to take control of the situation he wants to take the steering wheel he wants to drive he doesn't want to submit to anybody he doesn't want to listen to what you have to say because he thinks he knows better and as sometimes it feels like we Peak when we're getting into adolescence all of a sudden we know better than our parents all of all of a sudden we know better than the people who are trying to help us grow as Christians and we think well they don't know what it's like they don't know where we're going through well as a witness I can tell you that I used to think that way I did I used to think that way my dad would try to help me he would try to give me advice and and I didn't want to take it because I thought I knew better well he you know my dad he doesn't know much he how does he know what I'm going through he doesn't know the thoughts that I have he doesn't know that I've contemplated taking my life he doesn't know the things that have happened in secret to me how does he how could he possibly know what I'm going through to give me the words that I need to be able to make it and live a a life of victory and so what happens is we become arrogant and we're not willing to Humble ourselves to be able to receive the word of God that we need to in order to grow as Christians but when we do allow ourselves to become humble when we do find the way to put self down then that's when God brings his quickening power to us and he begins to unite us with him and if you are taking uh notes that scripture would be John 663 and in verse 26 that we just read it says but is not to be this way with you on the contrary the one who is greatest among you must become like the youngest and the leader like the servant so there's two requirements that he's saying that are required to follow Jesus Jesus and number one is that you must humble yourself before God and others which means that you must take the low rank you must become Meek because to humble yourself it's synonymous with weak uh meekness and number two is you must be like a servant you must be one who serves a bond servant and to further understand what it means to Humble ourselves let's go to James 4:6 and it reads like this but he gives more grace therefore it says and it is referring to he's referring to a scripture back in Proverbs 3:34 he's saying he says therefore it says God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble and so when we begin to Humble ourselves it brings the God's quickening power to us and it begins to bring life to the seed that he has already planted in us and it begins to bring more Gra to us not just a little bit of Grace it begins to bring more grace and grace is unmerited favor Grace is joy and Delight it is God's affection to us and it is strength to keep going on in this journey and so when we take the lowly road instead of trying to take the high road and you know it sounds kind of backwards because people are always saying take the high road well what it's saying here is to take the lowly road is to humble yourself and not to think more highly of yourself than you are and then when you do that God will extend his holy influence upon you in your life and when that happens that is when you start to see the acceleration of the maturity of the word that you have received in your heart so we must humble ourselves daily and as we do so God is slowly bit by bit Drip by drip positioning us Within the body and whose body is that does anybody know what body is that anybody the bride amen so as we are humbling ourselves we are slowly Drip by drip bit by bit becoming more a part of that bride and where as where before we would have doubted ourselves we didn't think that we should be anything you we think these people around me they don't know the things that I have done they don't realize how sinful I am and how I've treated others they don't know the things that I even did yesterday the way that I treated my family the way that I talk to so and so I I don't deserve to be here but when we begin to Humble ourselves and say Lord it is not what I think Lord it is what you think what do you say that I am then that is when the doubt begins to leave and God's holy influence over us helps us to Humble ourselves even more Glory so it is based on our submission to God when we humble ourselves basically what we're doing and what we need to do in order to Humble ourselves is we need to repent of selfie okay who is selfie you guys that's a weird word that's a weird way to describe yourself who is selfie selfie is oh look at me oh let's take pictures of myself oh look look this is selfie right I am self I'm amazing you know you don't know what I can do well why don't they put me up there and I'll show what I can do that's what selfie is selfie is self-interest I well I want to do what I want to do I want to do I want to go and I want to be able to drive a Lamborghini because look look at so and so if he can do it why can't I do it I self-reliance how many times have we gotten in trouble and we instead of running to the Lord asking him for help we just oh let me just swipe it on the credit card because you know I have money I could pay for it maybe the Lord had a blessing for you if you would have just gone to him and asked him and he would have given it to you without you having to pay your own money he might have had a friend nearby that that was going to call you and and give you whatever it was that you had need of but we're so quick to just think well uh I'll just swipe the credit card because I have it I don't I don't I don't need anybody else I can do it myself we need to what we need to do is we need to repent of wanting to defend ourselves every time somebody lashes out at us or treats us unfairly and uh to understand this better let's go to First Peter chapter 2: 20- 2 and it reads like this for what credit is there if when you sin and are harshly treated you endure it with patience but if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it this finds favor with God for you have been called for this purpose since Christ also suffered for you leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps who committed no sin nor was any deceit found in his mouth and while be being reviled he did not revile in return amen so can you imagine he's over here getting lashed getting whipped getting taken from this leader to that leader because they were trying to find something to convict him of trying to find him guilty for something they were spitting in his face they were cursing him out calling him beab and every name in the book book and he could have opened up his mouth and he chose not to the very God Of Heaven chose to keep his mouth shut when all these Sinners the one person who was innocent in this world and he chose to keep his mouth shut and while suffering he uttered no threats but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously he was on the cross and in his suffering he didn't say well just wait till I get down from here and you're going to see you're definitely going to get it wait until I raise up 3 days from now and you're going to see what's going to happen to you he didn't do any of that but we when our brother whether it's Brother In the Flesh or brother in the spirit they say why didn't you do this you were supposed to do this you were supposed to get it done why didn't you take care of it and then immediately were what about you where were you I'm over here working working my tail off and where you been why'd you show up late blah blah blah we're so quick to defend ourselves instead of keeping our mouths shut and humbling ourselves and saying you're right it was my job and I should have done it and he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness for by his wounds you were healed for you were continually straying like sheep but now you have returned turn to the shepherd and guardian of your souls and so when we begin to Humble ourselves we have more grace at us laded to us and he's saying here that we were straying like sheep and he came and he found us the shepherd the great Shepherd came and he found us and as sheep we're not supposed to drift off and do whatever we want as sheep we are called to be led by the shepherd and how do we do this how do we go and how do we take this attitude of humility that we're supposed to have what we're supposed to do is we're supposed to have an attitude of gratitude that is praising God for every situation that we find ourselves in no matter what it is and it is so hard especially this day and age with all the Temptations all the things that we have we have a a supercomputer right here at our fingertips everywhere we go and it gives us access to anything that you could possibly think of it is right there and to be able to have that and to not allow ourselves to get caught up in those things of the world it is very hard but we are called to praise God no matter what situation we find ourselves in it says in Romans 8:28 and we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God to those who are called according to his purpose so it is not just the good things it is not just Lord thank you for this house thank you Lord God for this car thank you for healing my leg Lord God thank you for for giving me my my beautiful wife and my children father it is not just that it is also Lord God thank you Father for the flat tire and I had to wait there 20 minutes for somebody to come help me fix it Lord God thank you Lord God for my brother who cursed me out Lord God outside because he was having a bad day and he didn't know how to handle himself Lord God thank you why not not because we want our brother to do those things not because we want to have to deal with a flat tire but because we know that when we endure it with patience he is there and he's willing to help us get through those days he's willing to help us through those moments of suffering and it it causes us to just fall more and more in love with him but the problem is is that when we find ourselves there when we find ourselves in the furnace of affliction as humans selfie all selfie wants to do is get out Lord why am I here Lord why why why do I have to deal with this flat tire I just dealt with the AC going out two weeks ago that's Lord God why why why why me Lord why we're in the furnace of Affliction and the enemy is throwing more and more coal in there trying to make it hotter and hotter and all we want to do is take the steering wheel and drive right out of there we want to get right out from where we are because it hurts hurts and nobody wants to deal with pain nobody wants to but part of the the trouble that we have is that we need to learn to deal with the pain and not just deal with it but praise the Lord in those times of pain because that is when he comes down on the scene and he brings you a peace that you never knew that you could have when we come with this kind of approach that's when you start to realize that you're beginning to to lead a Victorious Life and brother brandom says when you start leading that type of Victorious life there's nothing that can stand in your way can sickness stand in your way can your your job stand in your way can your spouse stand in your way your children stand in your way no the only thing that can stand in your way in those moments is self self is the one that begins to get in the way and and and starts complaining and murmuring about all the things that we have to deal with when we don't humble and submit what we're basically doing is we're removing God from being able to have his influence over our lives wow we're taking control of the steering wheel and we're basically telling God I know what I'm doing even though I'm in this pain I'm struggling I'm going to trust myself to get me out of this because I don't want to have to deal with this anymore I don't want to I don't want to learn the lesson that you have for me in this pain I want to just get out wow and so to understand this a little bit better what it means to be submissive and to be humble let's go to Matthew 11 verse 28-30 I believe they're going to have it this one up there and it reads like this come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light and one of the things that we we struggle to to realize I feel at least I did anyway I don't know about anybody else but a lot of times I feel like when we think of being submissive and humble we think that we that means we have to bow down to other people and that we have to cower away when uh we're put into a confrontation but being Meek being submissive being humble it doesn't mean that we have to be silent and passive people because if we're going to take the kingdom we have to take it by force and if we're going to submit ourselves to God it says submit yourselves to God therefore resist the devil and he will flee from you how are you going to resist the devil if you're like oh no you know I'm I'm humble and I'm Meek just sleep leave me alone and uh you know everything will be good that's not resisting resisting means that you have to use God's word and you have to be able to use the word and tell him no that is not what God says you're sick I am not sick I'm going to resist you because the word says by his stripes I was healed and when we begin to do so then that's when he begins to flee and so in verse 29 I want to break it down just a little bit it says take my yoke upon you and yoke is it is um it is a tool that they use I don't know if any of you have ever seen one it is Yol that they put on ox and it is a tool that they use to plow the fields it is a tool that is used to do very strenuous work and they put it on Ox because they're very strong and you know I don't think anybody wants to see a human out there in the fields using a yoke and trying to plow the fields and that's why they do it to animals but the Lord here is telling us put my yoke upon you and he's saying the word yoke is synonymous with burden bondage and slavery so the Lord is calling us he's saying take my yoke take my burden take my yoke take my bondage take my slavery upon you and we think that's kind of strange you know the Lord is asking me to be a Slave yes he's asking you to be a love slave for him that's what he's calling us to do the yoke is put on us to bring selfie our self our fallen nature under subjection our fallen nature under bondage and it is a tool that is used for carrying heavy loads and burdens but the problem that we find ourselves in is that we're here plowing the fields we have the Yoke we have our heads down and then before you know it we start feeling a little pain and we're like ah and we're the 11th Hour workers right and so we're here and we're not alone there's other people here plowing the fields alongside of us but we look over and we see why why does brother so and so have it easier than me oh man this this this is super heavy and I'm getting so tired and I feel so weak why is his load so light why doesn't he have to carry the things that I have to why am why is God giving me this why do I have to keep struggling while it looks like so and so has such has it so easy well one of the reasons why it might seem like they have it so easy is because they have learned to submit themselves to god wow why they why it seems like it their load is so light and it's not as heavy as yours is because they've humbled themselves and they said Lord even though this is heavy even though it's hard i g i i Place myself in your hands you take control Lord and I will surrender to you and I will praise you no matter what and when we begin to do that then all of a sudden that heavy load which we which was so burdensome all of a sudden it starts to feel a little lighter because it's not you that is carrying it alone anymore the Lord Jesus Christ is there lifting it up off your shoulders and one of the things that we don't realize is that when we're here in the furnace of Affliction what God is doing is that he is testing us he's testing us to see what our attitude is going to be in those times of Affliction are we going to praise him are we going to thank him no matter what or are we going to murmur and complain and ask why why me why me why do I have to go through this and one of the things that I realized and it it it came to a breaking point for me was about a month ago July 13th on on a Friday Friday the 13th funny enough um one of the most um hard struggles that I ever had to go through happened to me and my my wife and my family um we uh we received some emergency news that my wife she was pregnant at the time and she wasn't doing too good and we went to see the doctor and the doctor doctor said based on some of the images that we're seeing and uh and the the way that the symptoms that you're presenting we want you to go see this specialist in in Colorado and I'm from Arizona and so you know it's not just it's not like I can just upend my life and just drive to Colorado and uh and we're like okay like okay so so what's the plan he's like you know yeah we want you to go see him tomorrow tomorrow like what do you mean tomorrow I have to work you know what I mean I have a life what do you mean you you want going to just go he's like but what you don't realize is that this is this is BAS potentially life and death and if you want your baby to have a chance to survive we need you to go to Colorado and so I'm very grateful that there are programs out there to help people who may or may not be in the most strong of financial situations and they had programs to help us and they flew us out there free of charge they put us up in a hotel and we were able to go over there and see the specialist that they had there and a long story short I don't want to take up too much time on the story but we get there and they run all the new test themselves to see how she my wife is progressing how the baby's progressing and they tell us that this is a case like they had never seen before and it it was a one in a million cases and um they said your baby isn't doing too well they started see swelling around her brain they thought that she might have um she might have some permanent brain damage and her organs and her lungs were getting pushed up against her rib cage and so her heart wasn't able to pump like it should and so um there was she wasn't getting enough blood to all her extremities and her brain and that's why there was swelling everywhere and my wife ended up presenting symptoms that were similar because it was her body trying to counteract what the baby was going through and so she started feeling those symptoms herself she started getting swollen and they said based on the baby's condition and based on your condition we're recommending that we do an emergency delivery and we want to prepare you ahead of time that we don't think the baby is going to make it they they said with the baby symptoms alone I think they gave they gave the baby about a 133% chance of living and they said but with your symptoms included they said we just want to prepare you for the worst and so we we called upon the Lord and we said Lord we know that you are a miracle worker we know that you can take control of any situation there's nothing that is impossible for you so we place it in his hands and we talked to our pastor and he said whatever they recommend if this is how the baby is supposed to come then this is how she's going to come and for those who don't know I have three beautiful boys over there and I had been asking for a girl and so to me this was God he uh we prayed about it we asked our pastor can you please pray that we would have a girl and when we finally got the results of of the gender of the baby it was she was a girl and so I was so excited to finally have a girl and I kept thinking in my mind Lord like there's no way that you would give me this girl just take her away like it just doesn't make sense like I don't see how you would grant me my my desire just to take it away just to take her away but as they went through the process of the delivery my wife began having more and more complications and they went and they took her to the uh the ER and I was in the waiting room just waiting the results waiting for them to come and tell me what happened because they didn't allow me to go see her and in those times when when the heat in the furnace is turned up all the way that's when you find out what you're really made of and I I must admit that there were times where I broke down and I I just kept telling the Lord Lord like I I trust you and and I love you but I'm here Lord God and I'm stressing Lord God because they said that my wife was having having complications let alone my baby please don't take my my child away please don't take my wife away from me and I was stressed out because she was losing a lot of blood but I ultimately I said Lord I said it's in your hands I said you give and you take away if it is your desire that I have to go through this that you have to take my baby then that's what I'll have to do if you have to take my wife I don't know how I'm going to make it I have three boys that she takes care of all day every day I don't know how I'm going to do it but if that's what you want for me then I know that you'll make a way and the baby ended up not making it I don't know what happened I don't know the exact reason they told us that we could do an autopsy but I didn't I didn't want to I didn't want to know it wasn't going to change anything my baby was gone but what brought me consolation was that people called me he people who had already been in the furnace of Affliction people who had been there they called me and said brother we know what you're going through because we've been through the same thing and so sometimes we think that we don't understand why we're going through something we don't understand why we're going through this this pain and this suffering but a lot of times it's so that we can help somebody else when they get there where we're at amen and so I just said Lord God I thank you Lord God all I can do is thank you for bringing my wife out safe she had no issues the surgery went perfectly according to plan on her end and if this if all you had to do was have me go to this so that I can help somebody further on down the road Lord and so be it and I don't say this to bring any praise Or Glory to myself because like I said I stro so much and I still have questions of why I don't completely understand but regardless of the why regardless of how I feel about it I must tell the Lord you are sovereign you make the choices that you want to make whether I understand it or not whether I would do the same in your position or not not that we can be in his position but a lot of times we think well if you know if it was up to me I would have done it this way well it's not up to us God can do whatever he wants and so I just have to thank him and praise him that I do have three healthy boys there that I do have a wife that I do have this beautiful life that he's given me that I am healthy that my family is healthy and that he has saved me from my sins am so Christ's yoke it's a way of life of a servant totally yielded before God and others and his way of life is a yoke of servanthood so we're called to be servants and it requires that we yield and ourselves yield ourselves and humble ourselves before God and now we go to the word meekness where he says I am meek and lo in heart and what he beans means by meekness we find here in the Greek Lexicon strongs number 4239 and it says meekness towards God is that disposition of spirit in we in which we accept his dealings with us as good Romans 8:28 again regardless of what his dealings are with us we must regard them as good and therefore without disputing or resisting without complaining without murmuring in the Old Testament the meek are those wholly relying on God rather than their own strength to defend themselves against Injustice because what happens when we when we go through an injustice where we didn't deserve to be treated a certain way selfie wants to immediately outrage like how dare you treat me like this when I did nothing wrong imagine you're at home imagine you're at home and you took it upon yourself to take the Yoke of Christ upon you and so you said what what can be done around here what work can be done I'm going to help my brother my sister I'm going to help my mom I'm going to help my dad I'm going to clean the dishes and I'm going to clean this whole kitchen and then afterwards then I'm going to reward myself with a bowl of cereal okay I don't anybody like cereal yeah okay so you're I'm going to reward myself with a bowl of cereal after I do all this work so you go you do all this work you clean up the kitchen you make yourself a bowl of cereal you sit down and you put the milk back like you're supposed to right I don't know about any of you but we don't like milk being left out outside in our house okay because then it can go bad and then comes along your sibling or whoever else somebody else comes along you've already cleaned the kitchen they were nowhere to be found but once it's clean all of a sudden people come out of the woodwor they come into the kitchen and they go and like oh they see you eating a bowl of cereal I'm going to get some too they go they pour themselves a bowl of cereal they grab the milk they they pour the milk and they leave it there on the counter they walk away and they go to their room okay has that happened to anybody maybe maybe not okay then all of a sudden mom and dad comes home from work because it's a Saturday you're you're there sitting at the table not on the couch like you're told not to you're on the table because that's where they want you to eat and you're watching cartoons whatever you do on Saturday I don't know what you do and then your mom and dad comes home they see you eating the cereal and they see the milk right there on the counter and they go and they go how many times have I told you to put the milk in the fridge after you're done using it who is there who is going to sit there and just take it how many of us is just going to sit there and say you're right I'm sorry I'll take care of the milk next time how many of us would be the first one to be like what are you talking about Joseph left that out there on the counter how dare you obviously we wouldn't talk to our parents like that but inside right that is what but that's how we would be feeling that's what we would want to say what do you mean Joseph let that that wasn't me and immediately it's we want to jump to defend ourselves but here is saying meekness towards evil people means knowing god is permitting the injuries they inflict and that he is using them to purify his elect and that he will deliver his elect in his time so what you could have done is you could have just sat there said yes okay I'll take care of it because if Johnny doesn't bring in the wood what are we supposed to do we're supposed to bring in the wood so if your brother and sister left maybe you could have said hey can you put the milk away and they whatever and they just walk away and they leave it there because they know what type of Christian you are and they know that you're going to take care of it no matter what you go over there humbly as a servant of the Lord you go you grab the milk and you put it away even after your parents already scolded you because you know that in due time the truth will come out or maybe it won't come out but God is going to deliver you from the Affliction and the pain that you're feeling and we know that all things work together for the good and what we don't realize is that a lot of times the pain and the suffering is going to come from our very own loved ones it's not it's not yes every so often we'll be driving around and somebody will give you the bird or whatever it is and yeah you're they're just treating you like trash when you're driving down the street but most of the time it's going to be the ones that it would hurt from the most the people who you love the most your brother who treats you like you're the scum of the earth for doing nothing but being a good boy a good girl because all you want to do is serve the Lord like man dude you're so lame dude like like you can't just give it a rest like we're here at home D you don't got to put on that fake face anymore you don't got to put on that fake attitude like what are you what are you trying to prove we're here at home dude just relax chill out and it's in those times of Affliction that we need to lean on the Lord even more and say Lord God thank you Lord God I thank you Father and I trust in you and I'm going to put all my pain Lord God everything that I'm going through Lord God I'm going to put it on your shoulders Lord because I know Lord God that you're going to help me raise this yoke Lord God and you're going to make my burden just a little bit easier and what we're doing when we're carrying that yoke when we're carrying that burden willingly humbly what we're doing is we're taking steps and each footsteps is possession yes we're possessing the land that the Lord God has promised us you want to be filled with the Holy Ghost we have to Humble ourselves and take step by step through the furnace of Affliction through the oil press we have to take step by step and it's going to be painful it is going to hurt but let me tell you the Lord God right here says in verse 28 that we just read come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest and so if you are feeling heavy laden today if you feel like the Lord like like the Lord isn't hearing you he hasn't heard your prayer in I don't know how long maybe we haven't even prayed in so long because we don't feel like the Lord hears our prayer maybe the Lord God is just waiting for you maybe he's waiting for for us to Humble ourselves so that he can answer our prayers humble yourself and say Lord God I don't know why I'm going through this Lord God but I'm going to trust you no matter what Lord I'm going to put myself in your in your hands Lord God and I'm going to stop taking control of the steering wheel Lord God because it has left me to nothing but death and Chaos pain and destruction and misery and I'm here now Lord God and all I want to do is have my life end Lord God because of all this struggles that I'm going through nobody seems to understand my brother he doesn't even know my parents they don't know what I'm going through Lord God but in my misery Lord I come to you Lord God because your word says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest so father I will surrender myself to you now Lord and I will give my heart to you Lord and I know Lord God that in due time if I humble myself enough to you that you are going to give me the rest that i s so long for Lord Jesus and so I'm going to read this quote to close it is a a prisoner 1963 July 17th and brother brandham says I wonder tonight with our heads bowed and if you could bow your heads and just listen to this quote if that ambition that we have of being something else or maybe of something that we might think be a selfish thing wonder if we couldn't just lay that aside I wonder if some young boy here tonight look around and say I'm going to be this and I'm going to when I get big I'm going to be a certain certain thing I wonder if you could feel the will of God move in your life and say no no uh-uh my ambitions are lost now for the last few days maybe the last few weeks maybe the last few months you've been feeling so much pain and Agony but you've been feeling that the Lord and the Holy Spirit has been speaking to you you're just going to say Lord I want to yield myself to God to be a thrashing instrument in this last day some young girl that might have Ambitions of a fine lady character or maybe a pretty little M maybe someday make Hollywood your career I wonder if you're not willing now to submit your ambition in the presence of God and his word to hear the call of God in your own life life God knows who you are and this afternoon God knows who you are that is struggling he knows who you are whether you think that he knows you or not he knows what you're going through and whether you think so or not he's reaching out to you and he's saying come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest and if you've never felt that rest if you've never felt the peace that passes all understanding Just Surrender yourself and humble yourself before him and say Lord I'm going to stop doing things the way that I think I'm going to stop doing things my way I'm going to follow the leading of my shepherd I'm going to follow the leading of my pastor and I'm going to start to take the things that he says then I'm going to start to apply them into my lifej and I'm going to start to come to service Lord God With a Purpose to serve you Lord God regardless of the circumstances that I'm going through I'm going to start to praise you Lord God no matter what pain I'm going through whether you take my baby girl or whether you don't Lord I'm going to serve you with all my heart and I'm going to give you Lord God a life Lord God that would be worthy of the Gospel as best as I can knowing that I'm So Unworthy Lord but it is not me Lord God it is you working in me because I am surrendering to you allowing you to do the work that you've called me to do so tonight Lord God we present ourselves father as Christians in your hands Lord and we just ask that you come down lord and whatever each person had have need of Lord God whatever they're going through Lord God may they just humble themselves to you Lord God so that you can help them Lord God with their Affliction you could help them Lord God with the Yoke that they've taken upon themselves to serve you father and that you would just make the load a little lighter father we thank you Lord God for all that you've done for us father and I thank you Lord God for taking away my girl Lord God because I know that you're just holding my character Lord Jesus I know Lord I know that you're just preparing me for the resurrection morning Lord God when I'm going to see her again Lord and I thank you Lord
