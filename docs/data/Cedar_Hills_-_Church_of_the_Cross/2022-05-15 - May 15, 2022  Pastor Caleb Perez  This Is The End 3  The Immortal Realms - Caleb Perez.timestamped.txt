[28:54] a lady that has been so good to me it's
[28:59] she has always i've been her seamstress
[29:01] for about 30 years
[29:06] and
[29:07] she's always very generous
[29:11] anyway she's a cpa there in silver city
[29:14] and is as mcpie in silver city and she
[29:18] had she had a granddaughter that

[29:36] the motorcycle driver i don't know how
[29:49] and
[29:50] so she lost nearly all the
[29:52] the flesh on her
[29:54] i think it's her right leg i'm not sure
[30:00] so they thought they were not going to
[30:01] be able to save her leg
[30:06] anyway i had gone to deliver some skirts
[30:08] to her and
[30:12] say yeah and
[30:14] uh you know she was telling me about it
[30:16] and i told her um

[30:32] about this

[30:47] i
[30:49] i called caleb and let him know about it
[30:51] and he
[30:53] didn't
[30:54] and i think he put their requests to
[30:56] pray for her
[31:01] anyway the
[31:02] next the next
[31:05] thing i knew was that
[31:08] yo

[31:11] caleb had gone to her office
[31:13] [Music]
[31:15] and

[31:18] or she asked him or he told her that
[31:21] that the whole church had been praying
[31:23] for her
[31:27] and then she she asked
[31:30] what time did you pray for her

[45:27] this morning
[45:32] amen god bless each one of you that has
[45:34] made the effort to come
[45:37] in
[45:43] we have a
[45:44] dual purpose this morning
[45:48] and there is a convention that will be
[45:51] going on in in
[45:53] lima peru
[45:57] peru and so if you can get this camera
[45:58] over here if you can put it on the
[46:00] people
[46:02] and this is brother brother castro
[46:05] from peru
[46:08] he asked us to minister in his
[46:09] convention me and brother tommy
[46:11] okay
[46:40] we want to get right into the word
[46:44] and if you have your bibles you can open
[46:46] them up to the book of first timothy
[46:51] and this would be the first chapter and
[46:54] the 17th verse
[47:01] this will be the message this is the end
[47:03] number three
[47:07] with the subtitled the immortal realms
[47:12] immortalis
[47:14] pray that it will bless you
[47:18] amen
[47:20] it reads like this now unto the king
[47:22] eternal
[47:46] now unto the king eternal immortal
[47:49] invisible
[47:51] the only wise god
[47:53] be honor and glory forever and ever
[47:58] amen
[48:04] can we all say amen
[48:06] it means so be it amen
[48:09] okay god add his blessings to the
[48:10] reading of his word you may be seated
[48:16] we pray that this would bless you this
[48:18] morning
[48:19] especially
[48:21] greet everyone that's online god bless
[48:23] you wherever you are
[48:26] he's your king as well
[48:32] when we talk about the end point
[48:35] we know now that it's not just about the
[48:37] termination of something
[48:43] but rather the completion
[48:46] the fulfillment
[49:01] and because we're creatures of time
[49:05] immortality seems many times so
[49:08] far-fetched
[49:11] it sounds like a good superhero movie
[49:14] tell you
[49:20] i believe that that's even what they
[49:21] call superheroes they call them the
[49:23] immortals right
[49:27] supposedly they cannot die
[49:30] and if they happen to die then they
[49:32] somehow raise them up again
[49:36] but when we look at this
[49:38] the very word immortality
[49:42] is the ability to live forever
[49:46] it means eternal life
[49:49] and you cannot begin to even comprehend
[49:52] immortality
[49:55] without first comprehending infinity
[49:59] infinity that's pretty much infinity and
[50:01] immortality
[50:03] go hand in hand
[50:07] jewish commentary says this commentary
[50:50] there would be no manifestation of god's
[50:53] attributes
[50:56] he never would have been a healer
[50:59] no one was ever sick
[51:02] he never would have been a savior if
[51:04] there was no one lost
[51:32] and make them or bring them into
[51:34] immortality
[51:48] and that is what we would call the end
[51:50] yes
[51:53] that's what we are looking at today
[51:56] and that's why the savior
[51:59] el salvador the immortal one immortal
[52:22] so as mortals we see this that we have a
[52:25] few problems
[52:29] mortal people do we have here this
[52:30] morning
[52:32] how many got a few problems
[52:36] and one of the problems that we have is
[52:38] the limitations as
[52:40] mortal people
[52:43] i want to tell you that the moment we
[52:45] open our eyes
[52:48] whether from birth yesterday
[52:51] we wake up every morning
[52:53] our eyes are opened up to a world of
[52:56] limitations
[53:10] yet without limitations there is no
[53:24] limitations are there for us mortals
[53:26] limitations
[53:40] limitations
[53:43] in order to get us to seek something
[53:47] that is greater than those limits
[53:51] because as mortal or finite people
[53:54] mortality
[54:08] eternal
[54:22] something
[54:29] let me see if at one point in your life
[54:30] or another you've ever said that made
[54:33] that statement
[54:44] [Music]
[54:52] if i only had a better job or a nicer
[54:55] house since we don't win and play una
[54:56] casa bonito by only and what is it
[54:59] nothing but limitations
[55:02] why is it that most everything that us
[55:04] human beings think about
[55:07] this
[55:09] that we need
[55:10] necessity mostly
[55:12] materialistic things
[55:16] yes or yes
[55:18] everything is material thing oh lord
[55:20] give me this and lord give me that
[55:23] yet even in those things
[55:26] there are people that find success in
[55:28] those things
[55:30] i was hearing a man by the most you know
[55:33] a man by the name of elon musk
[55:37] you know he's the owner there of tesla
[55:39] and
[55:40] so forth and a few other things
[55:43] they asked him with all his ideas and
[55:45] everything that he plans on doing
[55:50] he said where are you getting all the
[55:51] money to do all that
[55:55] basically this is what he said
[55:58] money does not limit me he said
[56:12] well he's the richest man in the world
[56:13] well of course not
[56:22] in other words he did not see
[56:24] limitations or put limitations
[56:27] notice as we as we understand this then
[56:31] that as believers we you would think
[56:34] that because we serve an infinite god
[56:39] we would be able to overcome any
[56:41] limitations right away
[56:45] you know you hear people would say you
[56:47] you would think people would say or talk
[56:49] like this
[56:52] i sure could use more faith
[57:10] backwards
[57:13] because that's not what the scripture
[57:14] teaches us
[57:21] of god and it's righteous
[57:24] and
[59:00] why do i continue having these
[59:02] limitations
[59:04] because your character has not been
[59:07] developed enough
[59:10] power without character is satanic
[59:14] when you come to a place in your life
[59:18] where you are an overcomer
[59:21] what happens
[59:23] oh you begin to come to a place of
[59:26] dominion
[59:28] a place where you can rightfully
[59:32] rule over those things
[59:35] not let them rule over you
[59:39] our founding pastor i've said this many
[59:41] times
[59:43] he would always say
[1:00:02] this is why
[1:00:04] i hope that you follow me in this as we
[1:00:05] as we give this foundation
[1:00:09] that's why the hardest thing
[1:00:12] for
[1:00:23] and that is to get one mortal
[1:00:26] to believe another
[1:01:30] we can only as i said
[1:01:32] believe each other to a certain point
[1:01:50] we're good at that
[1:02:03] so from that point on
[1:02:31] too many mortals have
[1:02:32] disappointed
[1:03:02] or maybe the way we see our brother
[1:03:07] supported by all that we permitted us
[1:03:12] but i want you to notice what the the
[1:03:15] concept of infinity
[1:03:17] to ju or through judaism
[1:03:23] and please get with that please listen
[1:03:25] closely in this
[1:03:27] in judaism
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:04:10] on
[1:04:24] behind the voice
[1:04:36] there would be no limitations
[1:05:03] [Applause]
[1:05:06] yeah and then you can go off singing and
[1:05:08] shouting and da da da da da da
[1:05:11] da do you even do it in a car in your
[1:05:13] car
[1:05:16] you go down the road
[1:05:18] and man you just hear them going to town
[1:05:20] and man just doing whatever they do
[1:05:24] there's no limitations to it no i limit
[1:05:26] you i don't care who's around no listen
[1:05:29] shut off the limitations
[1:05:32] and now it's open they're free yes
[1:05:45] and our eyes deceive us
[1:06:02] tell me that's not true
[1:06:05] what happens
[1:06:07] the moment we see who's around us
[1:06:10] we
[1:06:11] see limitations
[1:06:14] now our hand doesn't go up as high
[1:06:16] anymore
[1:06:31] resistance i don't know
[1:06:35] because of limitations
[1:06:37] your eyes showed you limitations
[1:06:42] and therefore
[1:06:44] we found ourselves lacking
[1:06:48] doing what we failed to do
[1:06:52] amen when we when we feel like
[1:06:56] hallelujah
[1:06:58] when
[1:07:25] when those limitations are still in
[1:07:27] place
[1:07:30] but when we close our eyes to the
[1:07:32] limitations
[1:07:35] then we begin to hear the voice of god
[1:07:40] and it's not until you hear the voice of
[1:07:42] god
[1:07:48] once again
[1:07:50] infinity war
[1:07:53] no limitations no i limit first of all
[1:07:56] you got to close your eyes
[1:07:59] now let's go to exodus the 20th chapter
[1:08:01] in the verse 18.
[1:08:04] i want to drive this home and this is
[1:08:06] tremendous to me
[1:08:08] because it makes you it it makes you
[1:08:10] think outside of the box
[1:08:13] it makes you realize how many
[1:08:15] limitations we actually have in our life
[1:08:20] notice this verse 18 perez
[1:08:36] mortal man
[1:08:38] that makes no sense to me
[1:08:41] how do you see a thunder comes
[1:08:44] you can see the lightning
[1:08:46] but to see a thunder perovera
[1:08:50] did i miss something somewhere
[1:08:54] read it again and all the people saw the
[1:08:56] thunderings
[1:09:02] and the lightnings
[1:09:18] but
[1:09:31] look at things god's provided
[1:10:01] once again how do you see
[1:10:04] thunderings
[1:10:09] i'll let you think about that for a
[1:10:10] moment
[1:10:12] a good question
[1:10:30] because when i see the scriptures
[1:10:34] i know one thing for sure
[1:10:37] that thunders
[1:10:39] and trumpets
[1:10:41] are
[1:10:42] always the voice of god
[1:10:47] yes or yes coc
[1:10:49] okay
[1:10:51] and when you close your eyes
[1:10:54] to any limitations
[1:11:10] you didn't get it
[1:11:14] gotta let it come out good now
[1:11:17] once again
[1:11:21] when you close your eyes to limitations
[1:11:52] but
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:12:08] and what is it when you see the thunder
[1:12:10] quest
[1:12:11] it tells you why the lightning came
[1:12:16] did you get that come on now
[1:12:18] i want you to get
[1:12:19] the thunder hearing the voice of the
[1:12:21] thunder
[1:12:24] you actually see the thunder ah
[1:12:28] because it's enlightening
[1:12:30] when you do one
[1:12:32] telling you
[1:12:33] listen
[1:12:34] to the
[1:12:41] watch it'll make more sense as we go on
[1:12:43] here
[1:12:45] it opens your eyes
[1:12:47] and that's how you can see or understand
[1:12:49] the thunder yes
[1:12:52] which in turn reveals the purpose of the
[1:12:54] lightning
[1:12:57] they had put limitations this is where
[1:13:00] we want to get now
[1:13:02] they had put limitations on believing
[1:13:05] moses
[1:13:09] god had used him to take them out of
[1:13:11] egypt
[1:13:13] and yet they still doubted moses
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:23] why
[1:13:25] because he was a mortal just like them
[1:13:27] or
[1:13:28] mortality
[1:13:32] but as long as moses had the word to
[1:13:36] give them
[1:13:39] he was god
[1:13:43] that was immortality
[1:13:49] they murmured against god and against
[1:13:52] moses
[1:13:55] but when they saw the thunders
[1:14:13] out
[1:14:14] that there was nothing but judgment
[1:14:16] waiting for them
[1:14:20] they did not hear the voice of that
[1:14:22] mortal
[1:14:26] man you with me yes
[1:14:29] this is important this is what god is
[1:14:30] showing them
[1:14:33] there was judgment coming for not
[1:14:35] believing the one that he had sent
[1:14:40] verse
[1:14:53] now you want to hear the mortal man
[1:14:56] you speak with us
[1:14:59] we'll hear it now
[1:15:02] god speak with us lest we die
[1:15:08] what happened
[1:15:09] on the immortal realms were opened
[1:15:14] and moses said unto the people
[1:15:18] fear not not the mice for god has come
[1:15:21] to prove
[1:15:36] stop disbelieving what i'm telling you
[1:15:42] remember remember the bible is an
[1:15:44] eastern book
[1:15:48] and it's the exact same thing that
[1:15:50] happened in the book of revelations
[1:15:57] and i turned
[1:16:00] to see the voice
[1:16:02] here we go again
[1:16:04] i turned
[1:16:15] but the only way is that for him to he
[1:16:18] was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:16:22] and therefore his eyes were they were
[1:16:25] shut to limitations
[1:16:28] listen closely to this i i love his word
[1:16:32] his eyes
[1:16:52] if he would not have been in the spirit
[1:16:54] you know foreign
[1:17:39] come on church i'm gonna say it again he
[1:17:41] saw the immortal bride
[1:17:53] we saw that it was jesus christ in all
[1:17:56] things
[1:18:10] he heard the same
[1:18:18] it was jesus christ
[1:18:21] through seven church ages
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:51] mortality
[1:18:54] are you getting it church lost
[1:18:57] you hear the voice first
[1:19:00] but then when you recognize
[1:19:02] who the one talking to you is
[1:19:08] [Music]
[1:19:20] faith cometh
[1:19:48] put your hand
[1:20:00] we are open to the immortal
[1:20:22] let them put it up there and when he was
[1:20:24] demanded of the pharisees watch this now
[1:20:27] here comes the pharisees the religious
[1:20:29] leaders
[1:20:30] foreign
[1:20:32] he was demanded when the kingdom of god
[1:20:34] should come
[1:20:38] when is it coming
[1:20:41] he answered them and said
[1:20:43] elizabeth
[1:20:44] god
[1:20:49] put the word if you have it up there
[1:20:51] observation i don't know if i gave it to
[1:20:53] you or not
[1:20:54] probably not
[1:20:55] but the word observation means
[1:21:05] the kingdom of god doesn't come with
[1:21:07] ocular evidence
[1:21:10] or
[1:21:11] perception by the eye or perception
[1:21:14] why listen closely
[1:21:16] the kingdom of god doesn't come that way
[1:21:20] by our human mortal finite eyeballs
[1:21:26] praise god sorry i'm going to say it
[1:21:28] again it don't come that way
[1:21:34] yeah we want to see it that way
[1:21:38] neither shall they say low here or low
[1:21:40] there
[1:22:49] will i grant to sit with me
[1:23:05] that everything that you and i go
[1:23:07] through
[1:23:08] nosotros is not by some coincidence
[1:23:13] or by some chance
[1:23:16] nothing you go through is by coincidence
[1:23:32] yes
[1:23:34] when you're unconscious of something
[1:23:36] you're not you're not aware of it
[1:23:39] why are we unconscious of so many things
[1:23:44] because we bypassed our theophany
[1:24:00] then the story would vanish
[1:24:03] there was no more story
[1:24:06] but you know everything
[1:24:08] but the story is because of the
[1:24:10] overcoming
[1:24:12] the problems look immortal mortal beings
[1:24:17] and made them and brought them to
[1:24:19] immortality
[1:24:21] took the finite and brought them to
[1:24:23] infinites
[1:24:25] or to infinity
[1:24:34] there you go amen
[1:24:36] that's what it's all about
[1:24:39] and this is the end yes
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:45] my goodness you're still with me
[1:24:48] all right let's let's keep keep on going
[1:24:50] here see where we where else we go
[1:24:54] to see something
[1:24:57] we are unconscious of those things
[1:25:01] that's why god's will and purpose in
[1:25:03] every one of our lives is a mystery
[1:25:09] but how does god keep it
[1:25:13] from unfolding all at once
[1:25:19] we as human beings
[1:25:22] we're anxious
[1:25:24] to be lord show me lord show me lord i
[1:25:25] want to see what else next what's going
[1:25:27] to happen
[1:25:33] i'm infinite
[1:25:36] i'm not in time time is in me
[1:25:52] how does
[1:26:06] visible
[1:26:18] the storyline has to continue la
[1:26:31] and you think your life means nothing is
[1:26:48] how does he get us to look past our
[1:26:50] limitations
[1:26:53] by little he asks you questions
[1:26:59] where were you understand
[1:27:02] ah lord i've been through so many things
[1:27:06] such a hardship
[1:27:08] my trials and my tribulations and
[1:27:10] problems stop crying
[1:27:15] where were you on this dude
[1:27:18] come on now this gospel that we preach
[1:27:20] is so great
[1:27:23] this message that has been brought to us
[1:27:27] by the seventh angel
[1:27:29] is so powerful
[1:27:59] established
[1:28:02] god's not answering asking the question
[1:28:04] for himself
[1:28:07] he wants him to see the voice
[1:28:11] where were
[1:28:12] you and the morning stars they they all
[1:28:17] sang together
[1:28:20] he's wanting job to be to identify
[1:28:23] himself
[1:28:25] identification
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:35] when the sons
[1:28:37] of god
[1:28:39] shouted for joy
[1:29:05] there were no limitations there no via
[1:29:08] limitations
[1:29:10] so they were identified identification
[1:29:13] by their worship
[1:29:15] they were identified by their voice
[1:29:17] versus that when they shouted for joy
[1:29:21] i said glory be to the lambs
[1:29:27] everyone heard them
[1:29:30] the immortal realm
[1:29:33] but now he's come down to the mortals
[1:30:18] there
[1:30:29] where's the promise of his coming
[1:30:32] promise
[1:30:46] you
[1:30:59] we're not looking just to become real
[1:31:02] religious
[1:31:08] not looking for that
[1:31:10] i want to know where i came forth
[1:31:14] i want to be conscious
[1:31:28] of the word of god
[1:31:59] listen closely church oh my god
[1:32:02] the only way for that seed to ever grow
[1:32:06] it must be quickened
[1:32:09] by the eternal immortal invisible god
[1:32:14] and how does he do it
[1:32:16] come on now how does he do it
[1:32:19] by getting one mortal to believe
[1:32:22] another mortal man
[1:32:44] once again
[1:32:47] to believe that the immortal invisible
[1:32:50] god is speaking to us
[1:33:07] in
[1:33:11] not just any mortal man
[1:33:14] that have given him preeminence
[1:33:18] that's how he does it
[1:33:20] by the preaching
[1:33:26] hello everybody
[1:33:30] i ain't going to say what i just thought
[1:33:32] no way
[1:33:33] i said by the preaching of the gospel
[1:33:38] and if the whole world stops preaching
[1:33:42] we'll continue to preach here
[1:33:47] did you get me church
[1:33:49] said we don't need to preach no more yes
[1:33:51] we do
[1:33:54] maybe you don't
[1:33:56] know i do you'll see and man never gave
[1:33:58] me my calling
[1:34:01] god gave us our calling
[1:34:43] which means royal power
[1:34:52] and then it says in parentheses
[1:34:55] not to be confused with an actual
[1:34:57] kingdom no
[1:35:10] so when the gospel of the kingdom
[1:35:24] so there is a gospel that has being
[1:35:27] preached here at the end
[1:35:31] that gives you the authority to rule
[1:35:34] over a kingdom
[1:35:37] this gospel not only gives you power
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:47] luke 12 32 real quick lucas
[1:35:49] those fear not little flock
[1:35:51] not the mice
[1:35:53] it is your father's good pleasure
[1:35:58] to give you the kingdom
[1:36:01] what kingdom
[1:36:03] it's within you estadent
[1:36:05] it's the royal power
[1:36:08] the dominion
[1:36:16] mortals have no power or dominion over
[1:36:19] the kingdom
[1:36:22] but
[1:36:41] i think they do have this one the
[1:36:42] fundamental foundation for faith
[1:36:46] now god when he made man in the
[1:36:48] beginning
[1:36:51] he made him superior to anything on
[1:36:53] earth
[1:36:55] he gave him the jurisdiction over
[1:36:57] everything on earth
[1:37:02] there's no limitations
[1:37:18] he controlled the winds
[1:37:21] he controlled the plant life
[1:37:24] he controlled everything
[1:37:26] man was made as a secondary god on earth
[1:37:30] he was given the power to control all
[1:37:33] things
[1:37:35] all elements of the earth
[1:37:38] that was adam
[1:37:40] adam was given these great powers
[1:37:43] but then
[1:37:45] the power that he was given
[1:37:48] to make himself
[1:37:51] is where he felt
[1:37:54] he got ahead of god's plan
[1:37:58] adam could speak to the winds
[1:38:27] that's what god give him power over is
[1:38:30] okay
[1:38:32] everything on earth
[1:38:34] but now through the fall he lost that
[1:38:36] power
[1:38:39] then he becomes unconscious of the fact
[1:39:10] now what adam
[1:39:23] anything is to bring it back to its
[1:39:25] origin again
[1:39:30] he was unconscious of that
[1:39:33] but now let's see how he's going to make
[1:39:35] you and i consciousness
[1:39:51] wow do you really really you had to do
[1:39:53] that
[1:39:57] but now
[1:39:58] the same two trees are before every one
[1:40:00] of you
[1:40:06] let's see how he's making us conscious
[1:40:09] of it again
[1:40:12] timothy 1 9-10
[1:40:16] who have saved us
[1:40:18] and called us with an holy calling amen
[1:40:22] not according to our works
[1:40:25] but according to
[1:40:26] his own purpose
[1:40:28] and grace
[1:40:29] which was given us
[1:40:31] in christ jesus
[1:40:32] before the world
[1:40:48] before
[1:41:01] by the appearing of our savior jesus
[1:41:04] christ
[1:41:10] and has brought
[1:41:11] life is
[1:41:15] life
[1:41:16] visa and immortality immortalization
[1:41:25] we understand the purpose of the
[1:41:27] lightning now
[1:41:30] when we
[1:41:56] no in here
[1:42:01] what does it do
[1:42:03] come on church what does it do
[1:42:06] it gets us remembering
[1:42:10] that's all god wants to do with you
[1:42:12] right now
[1:42:28] get off on that one because that'll take
[1:42:30] me a while
[1:42:32] it gets us remembering
[1:42:37] finite beans
[1:42:39] finitos remembering
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:08] remembering who they are
[1:43:14] remembering where they came from
[1:43:17] remembering or knowing where they're
[1:43:19] going is
[1:43:33] that's what this gospel the message has
[1:43:36] done for us
[1:43:50] message spiritual amnesia
[1:43:53] spiritual he says we were identified
[1:43:57] thomas identificados in the immortal
[1:44:00] realms
[1:44:01] immortalis with god
[1:44:04] 10 million years before the world was
[1:44:07] even formed
[1:44:11] we were identified in the immortal
[1:44:13] realms with god
[1:44:17] don't ever let the enemy tell
[1:44:32] identified
[1:44:34] in the immortal realms with god
[1:44:38] tell your neighbor again neighbor we
[1:44:40] were identified
[1:44:44] immortal realms with god
[1:45:00] in the immortal realm
[1:45:06] and we question these things
[1:45:11] you'll never question it again when you
[1:45:12] start to remember
[1:45:18] nobody's going to tell you anything
[1:45:19] different
[1:45:22] because i was back there with him
[1:45:26] if i've got eternal life because i was
[1:45:28] back there with them
[1:45:31] i was identified
[1:45:34] in the morning stars
[1:45:36] they sang together
[1:45:38] and when the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:45:42] was identified
[1:45:48] [Applause]
[1:45:50] i'm going to say it again i was
[1:45:51] identified by my shelf
[1:45:55] that's why when god stands a prophet
[1:46:00] what does he bring
[1:46:02] the show
[1:46:06] it produces a bribe
[1:46:09] it produces a bride that was there with
[1:46:11] him
[1:46:13] he is now becoming this immortal bride
[1:46:18] to god
[1:46:20] with an immortal god
[1:46:23] that's the rapture he says
[1:46:42] every creature which is in heaven
[1:46:45] and on earth
[1:46:46] and under the earth
[1:46:50] that are in them
[1:47:05] that was pretty loud
[1:47:19] in heaven somebody turned and said did
[1:47:20] you hear that
[1:47:23] i heard that before the foundation of
[1:47:25] the world was your place
[1:47:29] i remember hearing that voice
[1:47:32] because john
[1:47:33] juan is
[1:47:36] your voice is already known
[1:47:40] when did it become known here
[1:47:43] when you accepted the lord jesus christ
[1:47:45] as your personal savior
[1:48:01] notice this now
[1:48:03] oh my goodness my time has
[1:48:05] gone
[1:48:07] oh come on let me just let me finish a
[1:48:09] little bit more
[1:48:12] every creature in the realms of the
[1:48:14] immortal
[1:48:16] immortal and in the
[1:48:48] we were conscious we were unconscious of
[1:48:50] this
[1:48:52] but when the gospel of the kingdom came
[1:48:54] to us
[1:48:56] enlightened us
[1:48:58] and something happened
[1:49:02] brother branham says when you meet god
[1:49:07] happens
[1:49:09] immortally
[1:49:12] i'm going to say
[1:49:24] the moment that moses met god with that
[1:49:26] burning
[1:49:39] becomes your personal savior
[1:49:42] personal it changes you lo cambia throws
[1:49:45] your views right straight into calvary
[1:49:50] and to his word
[1:49:52] something has happened algo a contest
[1:50:09] you know you know the story
[1:50:12] he says can anything good come out
[1:50:13] nothing anything good come out of come
[1:50:15] out of nazareth
[1:50:20] we found the messiah come and see
[1:50:22] me
[1:50:37] and your name shall become immortal
[1:50:41] when you make your decision for jesus
[1:50:43] christ
[1:50:46] son of god king of israel
[1:50:49] israel then when he told the woman at
[1:50:51] the well about her sins
[1:50:55] to her for a while
[1:50:58] and he says go get your husband
[1:51:02] that was it
[1:51:04] that
[1:51:13] i want this to really get get and settle
[1:51:15] inside of you
[1:51:17] you have so many limits
[1:51:21] we have put limits on god in our lives
[1:51:26] well i can't do this or that because i
[1:51:28] i've been divorced
[1:51:46] i haven't been in church very long
[1:51:48] limits
[1:51:50] her whole life was limited
[1:51:54] she had five husbands
[1:51:57] living with the sixth one
[1:51:59] but when she saw the voice
[1:52:04] i'm going to say it again
[1:52:07] oh the voice
[1:52:09] of her real husband that's what this was
[1:52:11] possible
[1:52:12] that the well became immortal
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:42] that that was one of the most referred
[1:52:44] to scriptures
[1:52:48] in the ministry of the seventh angels
[1:52:51] he used that scripture probably more
[1:52:53] than any other
[1:53:10] remember our king is eternal
[1:53:14] immortal immortal visible
[1:53:18] omnipotence
[1:53:22] the beginning
[1:53:23] from the end

[1:54:41] as jewels out of the dirt
