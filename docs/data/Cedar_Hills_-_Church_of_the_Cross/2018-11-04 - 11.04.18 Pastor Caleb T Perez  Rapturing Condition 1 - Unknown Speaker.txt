gonna say it again heaven it's yellow it's not a place made up of a bunch of buildings or someone in the feast you heaven is a condition is very lowest when that quantities how many understand that this morning was in the night I want you to repeat after me ghetto killer repeat heaven is a condition we think of heaven as a place estamos del cielo c'mon lugar and it is a place in one sense Andrew Santino still away but it's a place of condition but this one got a dick condition that's where many people miss it eyes on them which was there because they look at their condition here on earth what case the miren ilos in Slough condition a kid and they wonder how could we ever get to that place of that condition come on I stuck on this you see sir it's a place of condition it's a look at the condition that we move out of this dimension we live in - kano salimos esta dimension que vivimos and we go into another dimension no contra Messiah it's a house a tabernacle a dwelling place that's when I cast eyes when Amerada we are simply doing what Paul said that we should do estamos haciendo simplemente lo que Pablo he said let us go on unto perfection descendant Ramos a leper fix you know

once again can I repeat after me but I repeated conmigo perfection better fix t on is a condition ah but the Bram says and be certain of God in a manner under this day and this body that we dwell in is to quit opponent quite more parishes that is he we're regardless of how taken care of the important como lock with a but it's the soul that's in man there is a lot much that I love your heart those in here is a soul I guess that's what he said and that's all that's in man yes I'll macca stanley in el hombre it's a condition of the spirit isn't a condition that a spirit that moves into the presence of the Living God in try la presencia then this guy out here does not like being in the presence of God it's the only kind only we know that yes that's why you have a hard time praying and getting into the spirit this is Kevin Randy no no because this guy doesn't like being in the presence I don't Adelaide Ian why he's uncomfortable ok think about the soul on the inside is the condition of the spirit is that what he assumed that is heavy that why John said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day people just analysts what it what is telling us is that he was in a condition look II know this is kiss time and I could he have gone from a condition here on earth into a spiritual condition on a conditional spirit and when he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day it's done dwelling in the spirit Lord we are able to reveal things to him and they pull reveal our closeness while Peter yet spake these words the Bible says let me LASIK you mean test Pedro holy gold as well on them in the world Kol Apollo and they were ready yes I like that part may boost I stop because you gotta be ready but académica started they were ready it's time on listo because it's a condition of the heart as soon upon these feudal chorus it's a condition of the people the liquidity and for us to receive anything this morning but I cannot believe we have to be ready Deena Kaster listo now I want to ask the question how many of you are willing to get into that condition to this day certainly saucepan remember once again it's a condition accordance in Esmond a condition think about this Peter Brown says in balm of Gilead eliminar and building up we're building this up this morning estamos scientific undo esto I have 15 pages of notes then go Kinsey packing as the notice and I'm on print page two away unless I wound up a kena but the good thing is like I said when is not good that I can't see very well noise when okay Cassie no Paul there but me and brother brother me talking back there that was like yeah I can see this now yeah we started unless font 11 from the sample and it responds there we have to go to font 12 you know what an hour is 14 right yeah I mostly know the letters are bigger so it gets more pit needs more pages but this one which is packing that's all I think mostly several years we probably be at 4:18 huh fish it's terrible to get old older I should say some of you were some of you that are older will say oh love yes Java lon you that are already saying let's watch this now how many are with me what this is that one thing that we have to move up to now is supreme faith own a las cosas que tenemos calcium there is on a fair Suprema supreme faith to what we have had to this point i lo que hemos tenido hasta este punto you cannot have faith who stay no puede tener face until you know perfectly what you're doing I stuck it aside perfect I meant they can that's gonna know what you're doing this morning what does I think at are you here porque esta aqui because you're trying to get into another condition is you do not have supreme faith in the pay 10 s defense until you do exactly perfectly what you're doing the Costello zip up perfect I mean you say well I'm going home stays day yeah I'm going out and I'm gonna start the car boy but I'm accustomed with mother Bramson and that's all act of faith versus an act with a thing tomorrow I will I will meet you at a certain plane don't wreck understand an act of faith has missed an act or the fee because you've just done it so much for killer a show Tonto that it becomes a regular routine with you so once again you have to have or know what you're doing to have faith in a que sera que está siendo para tener but our face has become a routine thing on the fair you got a routine recover the urge many Muslim is back the same thing believe Church knows mosey respect the same result Thomas Paine good work in that your brother Bram says we need us a supreme faith this is that motion offense to present then that'll take us out of the routine I book in a second a little something that'll take us into the right condition you know Jerry I second this uniform I came so he says on see now that's the way things things of God are as his Co most analyst process after you have trusted him this particular come feeling you've watched him do so many things he uh cuidado that polo Casas does killed it becomes just or like a regular routine I Stuckey I guess they were a terrible condition Church condition talent fan well I'm sick I'll go to the front well lord I know you've healed me before you hear a lot of people just heal me Lord it's doing firmly perforin typical maintain to you now better community heals you in Astana and it's still a routine why not because we act and we live the same way okay at one was Eve you must see that's what shows that it's a routine change in the condition that we live in poor cannot come down the conditioning K we're trying to get from one condition to another condition a god do not condition our house now this is why we're we're hitting on this this morning what is this K Thomas Orlando this system that's the condition it says look I don't think that the church will be in cruel killer could like Lester on just before the coming of the Lord there's a collision and facility though the rapture will just go right on that way but I can rub those through yah see what it'll just be heating up here he's talking about the routine Londo it'll just be a regular routine Buster I'll go to routine are you are following the scriptures and the plan of God yes again de las que todas el plan de Dios that was what the condition of the church will be in the last day necessarily kinesiologist to remain routine to come to church daily list all of the scripture is here let's ask you to follow the plans of God he said give those plan is that we need a more supreme faith in that this is that was in effect to przemek a that's not good enough no more mr. Endres must enter we may have got us to this point but to put the Moroccan Italian this morning church it ain't good enough this Morris the many ways he can do we wanna wink at home and it was you guys gonna take a greater supreme faith that we've ever had you let it go if I don't get emotional face with prima it's gonna take a greater condition that we've never lived in that condition mas grande esta la caja I don't know about you but I'm ready and I'm willing you're know since this video you wanna follow me to another condition but let's get in the other con is you know we we know Alex season hunting is coming sorry I'm asking like I say there are things we know we better get in shape then I must kiss tank on this we gotta be in condition to climb those mountains why when I when I finally shot at that out quizzes bundle your lip big yeah I say I'll say we searched for him for eight hours Louis come on come on Pablo Johnson's down mountains I'd leave me behind Alana's thinking in my head you start up in Sun though when is this all gonna fall bundle what I hate is TLC and I could hear the out thinking you're this guy is ever gonna stop chasing me wonder man I tell me nothing doesn't miss again well when you when you when you go out there you understand and you still be in shape already there is that in condition think on this you are instead I don't know where there is I'm taking baby steps up this mountain I can't breathe that moment I'm thinking and they said woman why didn't I get ready what can the melis why didn't I get myself in condition gonna train you for this you know and that is the way the church is today time to get into condition what's the little dimple but then we've used our time for everything you know who someone is to get out we gotta get in condition now there's a time Church oh yeah you're still an opportunity to let us use our time wisely now mr. dimples - not to go from one condition into another condition is you know why on because the rapture what killed up though is a condition is enough on this unit the rapture is a revelation brother Branham says it's another ablest it is the condition of the church is let that brings on the rapture they'll iglesia kit right out up don't think about this for a moment in Santa Paula minuto God changed Sarah and Abraham yours cambio Sarah Abraham and he made them or took them from one condition to another come it was your burden upon this year of a sour track on this Union they could not receive the promised son nobody under severe Elijo promise even in this condition estando neste condition though they believed it uncle okay yeah they were not prepared to receive the Sun yet understand preparados para until the the supernatural came as the king ago Sabrina took them from creatures of time you know japonica to Rosetta you change them their bodies to where they were young again Tom uses quite a PUD sister came and then they were able to receive the Sun revenues is progress apparently ho think about it for a moment Vincent how many know what age we live in what the sign in Cara's vivimos we are at the finality the capstone of it all it's some of that a lot cool yeah we have a stone coming down they send anyone tell me what the capstone is I'll give me a basic case it's a periodic corner it's love right it's not more perfect love it's not more perfect yes it is now we live in this time maybe most unless the temple so there should be a condition that goes with perfect love David everyone upon this York Eric went a lot more perfect I say that for this in the u.s. topo isto brother branham calls it this and I'm gonna run on like yeah my see this is the phrase he uses a telepathic Colusa this astronaut condition of God's grace to go in the rapture is that when you Sunday astronaut aggressive if you would put that up there just type it out and put it up there this astronaut condition is that when you don't have to Renata of God's grace they like go in the rapture once again this astronaut condition of God's grace for the condition Esther condition they they they have turn after they like rescue the dose John 5:24 says this one thing oh you have your Bibles handy barreling barely ice and to you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life this here - here - Zico Gaeko mi palabra cray al Khaimah miedo t na Vida aterna Ino Ino vendrick wondrously own masa pasado de muerte of it I like that megusta because it's telling us here por que nos dicen if you be if you hear his words cos tuple and believe on him that he is sending chris'll que se llama you'll not come into the condemnation of the judgment on a second anus you're not wish but you have passed from a condition of death there are political issue to a condition of life after this yonder Vida now that's what is worth tells us it's a look at super la gran disease now one condition into another condition they would have condition out record then let's find out and this is demos problem you know if you have passed from death unto life for most artists a cap a solid about ask you the question this morning your lee sang-hoon how many of you have passed from death unto life what does up a solid a margarita my question then how do you know you've passed from death unto life me promote entonces es como sagusti because our young people are following after porque ellos equals nothing in them and if they do not know how he stares no something else like you're telling me you're telling your children I've passed from death unto life let's go Melissa through your personal matter then their children are wonderful how do I do that because it gave me any come with that that's the problem is that we don't know how to tell our children how to get from here to here which I said the same as come I see tell us well it just happened one day I was praying no must personally in stunned oh come on now we gotta be more specific than that they the most kissing muscles our children are young people they need a map to follow the sequence women in this then we we can't just say oh well just pray and you'll get it not almost my sake order they have to believe on him that was sent first of all details I'm gonna hear the word believe on him that is Santana for then you pass from death to line and closes up a solid matter how do you know when you actually have passed fed upon the service that Kettleman -
