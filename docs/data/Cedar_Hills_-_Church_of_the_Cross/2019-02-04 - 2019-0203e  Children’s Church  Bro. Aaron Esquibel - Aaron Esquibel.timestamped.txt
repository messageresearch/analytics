[7:47] this man's name is Ry you may be seated
[7:51] he had a rough life he he wants uh says
[7:55] he wants to say a few words to the
[7:57] church is that okay
[7:59] all
[8:01] right God bless
[8:04] you I would just like to
[8:06] say that this is the most loving place
[8:10] I've ever been in my
[8:13] life you
[8:15] know I know you may not want me here by
[8:18] the way I look and the way I'm
[8:24] dressed but I believe God sent me here
[8:27] today
[8:31] I wasn't going to walk down this
[8:35] way but some guys I was with kicked me
[8:38] out of the
[8:39] car and I
[8:42] just I had a dream last
[8:45] night and it was about this world and
[8:51] the condition it's
[8:53] in
[8:56] and the word came to me and it said
[9:00] said respect has been
[9:04] lost nobody respects anybody
[9:08] anymore from the
[9:11] children to the leader of this
[9:15] country respect has been
[9:19] lost and I just would like to share a
[9:23] few things that I believe I
[9:27] know and
[9:30] first thing
[9:31] is you can never have
[9:34] respect unless first you have
[9:39] fear and I'm not talking
[9:41] about being afraid of
[9:44] anything God knows I'm not afraid of
[9:47] anything I sleep in
[9:50] ditches I'm talking about the fear of
[9:55] God when he comes into your heart
[9:59] and you realize that you never want to
[10:01] do
[10:02] anything to grieve the Holy Spirit and
[10:06] different
[10:08] people and if I could just say my
[10:13] testimony as a young
[10:17] man I was like you
[10:20] all I didn't want to be a bum what most
[10:24] would call
[10:27] homeless you know I had a father and a
[10:30] mother who loved
[10:32] me took care of me we had a nice
[10:38] house clothes on our back never in need
[10:41] of
[10:42] anything and I had two older brothers
[10:46] they never picked on me they took care
[10:49] of
[10:50] me and they proved that there was there
[10:55] was love and they they always took care
[10:58] of me through everything they never
[11:00] picked on
[11:01] me and my father was a
[11:04] doctor and I always wanted to be a
[11:08] doctor I went to school I had lots of
[11:12] friends I made great Straight
[11:16] A's and I went to high school went to
[11:20] college and I became a
[11:23] doctor a
[11:26] cardiologist and I met the of my
[11:30] life her name was
[11:35] Florida and I went through
[11:39] school and when I started to become a
[11:42] doctor I started to hang out with the
[11:45] wrong
[11:47] people I would go to
[11:50] work get
[11:52] out and I started hanging around with
[11:54] other people who made a lot of
[11:57] money and I'd go to have a a social
[12:00] drink started as just a sip of
[12:03] wine one sip turned into two sips then a
[12:08] glass then it just was
[12:11] bottles and it got to the point where I
[12:13] just lost
[12:15] control it came to the point where I
[12:18] gave up my right to choose if I was
[12:22] going to drink or
[12:23] not because I just had no choice that's
[12:26] all I could do
[12:29] well every day was a party at my house I
[12:32] stopped going to
[12:34] work my wife she left me my kids
[12:38] left all my so-called friends were
[12:41] nowhere to be
[12:43] found and I was all
[12:45] alone in
[12:48] California and it came to the point
[12:50] where I looked back and started to
[12:54] replay My Life as a child and i'
[12:59] vividly remember my mother teaching me
[13:02] not to drink not to smoke and as the
[13:05] Bible says defile my
[13:08] body and that's all I had ever
[13:11] done and instead of stopping right there
[13:15] I
[13:16] continued so much that I would do it
[13:19] just to drown out that voice of my
[13:21] mother and my
[13:23] father and I would just drink to numb
[13:26] all the feelings that I was feeling
[13:31] but I do believe that God is
[13:35] alive
[13:37] and the reason I know is because I see
[13:40] such loving people as you
[13:42] are in the midst of all
[13:45] this and I know you might think I'm here
[13:48] just for
[13:49] money but I'm putting that in your
[13:53] offering I believe I should give that
[13:56] back cuz I came for one
[14:00] purpose and that was to show that there
[14:02] still is people who
[14:05] respect and who love the
[14:08] Lord and you know Jesus became homeless
[14:11] so that a homeless man like me could
[14:14] find a
[14:16] way and that's what he's
[14:19] done and I would just like to share a
[14:21] little scripture with
[14:24] you it's found in Matthew
[14:30] I had to write it down I don't have a
[14:37] Bible
[14:41] 2535 and it
[14:44] says for I was
[14:46] hungered and you gave me meat Glory I
[14:51] was
[14:52] thirsty and you gave me drink amen I was
[14:56] a stranger and you took me in
[15:00] naked and you clothed me I was sick and
[15:05] you visited
[15:06] me I was in
[15:09] prison and you came unto
[15:12] me now if you know your
[15:15] Bible Jesus is talking to his
[15:18] disciples and as he says these words
[15:21] they begin to question
[15:23] him and they say Jesus when did we ever
[15:27] do that for you we didn't do such a
[15:30] thing and he gives them such an
[15:33] answer and he tells them in so much as
[15:37] you have done it unto the least of
[15:41] these brothers you have done it unto me
[15:45] amen and if I did not see this today in
[15:49] this church I don't know what it
[15:53] is and lastly I would like to leave you
[15:56] with Hebrews 13
[16:02] 2 be not forgetful to entertain
[16:07] strangers for there for thereby some
[16:10] have entertained angels unaware Glory
