our scriptures into John 145. yo this evening I want to I want to tell you Jesus I want to tell you the words that Jesus said and you will find rest Brothers okay foreign is now do you believe man I I believe also because and greater things we will see the Lord [Applause] you know it's we're happy that sister silver can have her her parents with us thank you we're going to read in the Gospel of John chapter 1. verse 45. this is the scriptures say is Pedro hello 44. verse 44. now Philip was Bethesda the city of Andrew and Peter 45 Felipe is Jesus 45 45 we have found him who who Moses and Allah and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph Felipe and Nathaniel said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth behold in Israelite indeed in whom there is no goal Jesus thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee respond where the where are the Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel Lord good evening we report for service testifying Lord that we believe your word and we believe the message we hunger and thirst for righteousness lift our faith this evening so that we can receive healing liberations and all good uh Redemptive blessings we send a blessing to our pastor and those who their men that are with them name of the Lord Jesus amen make yourselves comfortable now for a second here I want to open up this picture here now here is Nathaniel is the scripture says that this is a man that there is no no Felipe now I want you to notice how Philip comes to Nathaniel means now look at the message that Philip brings to Nathaniel verse 45. we will find it Nathaniel and saith unto him we have found him who Moses in Allah and the prophets are Jesus did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph is now these four things here is now this was too much for Nathaniel they all were dressed the same and they all had beards but when Nathaniel comes to Jesus now notice what Jesus says Behold a true Israelites who in their heart there is no deceit Jesus Jesus being the word identified identifies a predestinated seed now Nathaniel he is surprised Jesus no hold on how do you know me from where no it's not me and before Philip called you when you were praying underneath the Fig Tree I saw you that proved that Jesus was manifesting the signs for the people of Israel the words of Nathaniel Ravi they are they're Rabbi tueres the Son of God the king of Israel that confession that what Jesus declared of Nathaniel And he was a genuine Israelite it was the truth because when he saw this in his heart now if Jesus was here oh it would be something fantastic will be something great that it will reap that she will repeat itself [Music] being made the king of Israel Glory Lafayette faith seem very simple without faith it is impossible to please God this is the scripture says that we can even approach god without faith but what kind of Faith are you speaking of Brothers when I read the message of brother Branham I can see the desperation that brother Branham same words now that is where I'm going to speak of the faith foreign I'm going to say this with all respect I can see so many things that are absurd that look us crazy because it doesn't have limits you might say oh brother Diego I have a serious problem nobody can help me oh brother I'm sick the doctors cannot help me Hermano oh brother only God can help me in this situation the only thing that you need is is Faith because you cannot burn it you can't uh imprison it Lafayette you cannot just put it in one small spot it is now for a second here I I asked a question how is it a seraphenician woman here in the Bible is she came from uh the area of Tyrion and uh silence now this place was such a low and wicked place at the time that the Israelites were called the people that live their dogs that's how bad it was and the story says that even Jezebel came out of there and it has has a reason when this woman approaches Jesus the Bible tells me that the whole world ignores her while this woman is a woman that doesn't have a problem son of David and I give it to the dogs do you understand that you understand says [Music] that she overcame God you know listen Jesus never prayed for this woman now if you go to the scriptures Jesus never even gave her a word he just said woman as thou has believed let it be done Jesus didn't do nothing Jesus didn't heal the woman healing yes that's the faith of the Gentiles that would you confess in your heart he didn't even pray for her but she received what she what she believed there's another woman here in the Bible this woman lived in hell for 10 years she had a blood issue she had wasted all her money the doctors told her we cannot help you anymore we're such a miserable life of this woman I believe that this woman she was even separated from the fellowship because it was part of the law she was she was unclean and everything that she would touch would be honest now if you talk about desperation depression is [Music] I already said like you are in the same experience this woman she had reason pero is now but she knew something better she believed in her heart can only Touch the Hem of His Garment now listen we have read this many times but I want to shake you where did this woman where does women get that inspiration of Jesus he was going to receive the healing I don't read that in the Bible now here comes Jesus and his disciples when all of a sudden Jesus they have to hold them they have to lift them up who touched me is His Garment she can be healed when Jesus finds her he says great is thy faith as the second you touch it it left you Jesus never prayed for this woman you see that Jesus never prayed she received what she believed yeah hola foreign [Applause] [Applause] now let me take you to this in this picture here the scene I believe that the apostles they were here they were busy maybe they were somewhere I'm able to see this [Applause] when the service was over that's Faith the Bible says Paul Thomas that they took of his body is they took it to the sick and they were healed we've read it many times Let Us return because there was one there was one crazy that was out of his mind maybe he said Paul my mom is really sick would you let me borrow your handkerchief what do you want to do with my handkerchief I believe that's the same anointing that is going to be upon this this handkerchief I believe that Paul says she got better when this man goes and testifies it worked for him it can also work for me that's right that's right he says these words when a man is Guided by the Holy Spirit he is a messenger of God e ustaceans if you're a messenger of God you are an angel of God brother Brandon says that you can't separate these two words he says who has more Authority an angel from heaven or an angel from behind the pulpit says to the angel behind the pulpit because Jesus said all power in heaven first so much Jesus Jesus that overcame before he ascended now go brother Branham says that when he sends you he goes with you oh Brothers oh that makes me feel good but brother Brandon says the church this great church what can only comprehend has power to be able to do these things pero estan but they are trying to deny to doubt more they have beer is and they asked themselves the question is it really going to happen brother Branham says as long as the church exists in this way she can never stand to her feet the musicians will come [Applause] I have all these problems on a we suffer too much you only have two options you have a miserable life or take a step of Faith [Applause] Lord this message Daniel chapter 12 El Pueblo the the people that know their God so it now comes a challenge the authorities he gave it to the church and when We Gather in our harmonia and Harmony hell is going to shake porque because today there is a church that is on her feet it's for your neighbors and for me God can do it there hello that's Faith let us pray Lord good evening gracias thank you because your word continues being the same it is an honor to be able to see the works that you promised that would be done the works that the church is doing in thy name foreign Lord help us and give us strength strengthen our faith so that we can recognize that it is no longer us that we have to produce this to produce that what you promised that would be done Lord we have faith to look at Satan in the face and tell them that he's a liar and that I am a predestinator a predestinated seed help me Lord Heal Me [Music] Lord touch me [Music] I can pray by faith and I know that God will honor our prayer [Music] I would like that the Lord this evening that if it is his will and that if you have faith can reveal to us where your problem is oh just so we can help your faith no if this doesn't happen it doesn't matter we believe it that by his stripes we are already healed I invite you there where you are that you speak to the Lord and tell him Lord I declared that I am healed [Music] let me say these words there's a person here that they have an issue with the lungs you cannot you can't breathe well but if you believe is God that is revealing so that you can believe that he is simply raise your hand and tell them I will serve you more Lord I believe I feel that somebody has a a pain in their back that is so strong I I feel like that you're limping it's because I can feel your pain [Music] tell him Lord thank you like Nathaniel implemented this is a gift of healing let us pray there's a pro a person with a problem in their foot that when you flex your foot is where your pain is the Lord Jesus I believe it let us pray Lord good evening thank you for
