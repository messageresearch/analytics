[33:02] [Music]
[33:12] [Music]
[33:18] [Music]
[33:26] mail carrier in the lifetime of ever
[33:28] contracts
[33:30] [Music]
[33:33] in silver city
[33:35] made over 60 60 000.

[33:44] have to have brand new cars you have to
[33:45] have four brand new cars to come you
[33:47] know for this contract
[34:03] and the lady called me as soon as she
[34:04] received it
[34:07] and she said uh we are going to award
[34:09] you the contract
[34:10] [Music]
[34:14] okay
[34:15] lydia
[34:20] let me think about it
[34:23] right so i i hung up and then i
[34:25] thought about it for a few seconds or a
[34:27] minute
[34:29] and i said no you know i promised the
[34:31] lord i was gonna move
[35:23] i said i know and it sounds crazy
[35:35] and so don't think that i came over here
[35:37] real victorious right oh i
[35:39] just did something for the lord
[35:55] he was able to get me a job
[35:57] [Music]
[35:59] they're at the satellite shop with for
[36:01] the wheel
[36:02] manual
[36:04] and so i remember telling him
[36:07] and i don't know if he remembers this
[36:10] i was telling him about that contract
[36:14] and he said you know what
[36:16] so at the time actually i was going to
[36:17] actually i was in the position where i
[36:18] could actually force though
[36:24] so i was going to buy some land in a
[36:25] house in silver city
[36:28] in silver city and so while that went
[36:30] out the door right
[36:32] i think i came here with i think i had
[36:36] maybe and this would be pushing it
[36:59] all right so
[37:00] so i was you know i was telling brother
[37:02] caleb this one day at brother emilio's
[37:04] house
[37:11] [Music]
[37:26] the lord has been faithful amen
[37:36] and he's never slack concerning his
[37:38] promises
[37:40] [Music]
[37:44] but in all those years that was um what
[37:46] 14 years ago
[38:02] and i thank him for all that he's done
[38:05] i wanted to give up many times
[38:10] but i had to just stay focused
[38:15] and if there's anything i can tell you
[38:16] tonight
[38:22] [Music]
[38:27] as we stand to our feet to read our
[38:28] scriptures
[38:32] there's many things that a christian
[38:33] must do
[38:37] but i want to
[38:38] name three of them
[38:41] you gotta stay humble
[38:56] [Music]
[38:58] right
[39:23] and it's found first in
[39:25] in acts 236
[39:33] 236.
[39:35] i got to get my glasses
[39:39] on grandpa right all right let's see
[39:42] where we're at you're 236.
[39:44] they say therefore let all the house of
[39:46] israel know assuredly
[39:54] that the pastor hath made the same jesus
[39:59] no the bishop has made this same jesus
[40:04] the minister
[40:07] no no that god hath made that same jesus
[40:13] jesus whom he have crucified
[40:18] both lord and christ
[40:21] may the lord add his blessings to the
[40:22] word of reading of the word
[40:24] [Music]
[40:26] now we see here you can be seated
[40:30] we see here that god hath made
[40:34] now many times we say
[41:04] now how many here tonight
[41:07] believe
[41:08] in jesus and jesus
[41:12] right
[41:13] now how many here tonight
[41:15] believe green that jesus christ
[41:32] that jesus
[41:46] fair
[42:00] how many believe that god sent us a
[42:02] prophet
[42:05] ryan as we heard on sunday
[42:07] domingo when the word of the lord comes
[42:09] to that prophet
[42:12] or that prophecy comes to him oh it's a
[42:14] prophet
[42:42] how many
[42:54] in every
[42:56] detail in every single detail
[43:01] i got to repeat it again
[43:03] yesterday
[43:05] today
[43:06] and forever
[43:08] in every detail
[43:10] except
[44:18] he's the same yesterday
[45:23] now if a preacher says that the days of
[45:25] miracles is passed
[45:29] that's a seed of discrepancies
[45:33] when a man stands and says
[45:37] that he's a minister
[45:39] a pastor of a church somewhere
[45:42] and does not believe that jesus christ
[45:44] is
[45:58] is
[46:09] when they say there's no such thing as
[46:10] divine healing
[46:29] [Music]
[46:40] let's
[47:20] right that they have a leader which is
[47:22] the holy spirit
[47:37] now the holy spirit can guide you
[47:40] but christ is always going to point you
[47:42] back to the same christ
[47:47] he's going to never point you to
[47:48] something else
[47:50] he's going to always
[48:03] that is not the same in
[48:45] i want to go back to a little story
[48:47] about salt
[48:51] we find out that when saul
[48:55] when god has spoken to samuel
[48:58] and he told samuel
[50:09] he said that saul was lost
[50:38] right
[50:40] so i'm kind of like kind of
[50:43] dramatic or dreamy right
[50:48] so when i hear backslide
[50:51] i automatically think automatically
[50:54] or a picture
[50:56] like a hill you know because i like to
[50:58] be in the mountains right
[51:01] so i picture this hill
[51:04] and i'm climbing up this hill or this
[51:06] person's climbing up especially
[51:08] and they get to a like a
[51:11] slippery slope
[51:15] right and they and they and they slip
[51:17] and they
[51:18] slide down the hill
[51:47] i'll admit that he backslid
[52:17] he brought up all them sacrifices and
[52:20] things
[52:22] sacrificially
[52:23] when samuel through the word of god
[52:27] told him to destroy everything
[52:44] right
[52:48] [Music]
[52:49] and so sometimes when the pastor tells
[52:52] us to do something
[52:56] the word of the lord came through samuel
[53:12] and brought
[53:21] [Music]
[53:25] otherwise you're going to be chasing the
[53:27] word of god
[53:31] when god hath made the same jesus
[53:35] both lord and christ
[53:37] and you're over here focusing on the
[53:38] word of god
[53:57] [Music]
[54:49] instead of following the word of god
[54:51] just exactly like it says
[54:56] you put now now he was talking about
[54:58] saul
[55:00] and then all of a sudden now he's
[55:01] talking to us
[55:04] he
[55:18] there's where you backslid
[55:22] oh i thought drinking was backsliding
[55:26] i thought you were smoking doing all
[55:27] these things
[55:31] no he put your own opinion in it
[55:36] that's where you backslid
[55:40] when god has an anointed man
[55:44] to guide you
[55:46] now
[55:48] david was a pastor
[55:51] everybody nowadays wants to be a pastor
[55:55] and then they self-proclaim that they're
[55:56] not pastors
[55:58] and then they proclaim that they're not
[55:59] pastors
[56:14] was talking about how these sheep
[56:17] land
[56:19] they get these bots or worms
[56:22] does uh worms or bots
[56:26] right so
[56:28] now what happens to coos deer
[56:31] [Music]
[56:33] especially in the desert in like in
[56:34] arizona
[56:37] they get these worms that go into their
[56:39] nose
[56:41] and then they they um
[56:49] [Music]
[56:52] can you imagine he's full of these bots
[56:54] inside his throat
[57:08] [Music]
[57:12] right
[57:13] when that sheep gets infected like that
[57:18] he starts getting closer to the other
[57:20] sheep
[57:22] and to relieve those that is
[57:38] don't matter how strong he is
[57:41] don't matter if he's a
[57:43] strong
[57:44] sheep
[57:46] it just happens
[57:49] and then guess who has to go and take
[57:50] care of the problem
[58:07] [Music]
[58:21] does
[58:22] in his little bag
[58:28] and the only thing that relieves those
[58:30] insects
[58:32] is when the pastor throws puts that oil
[58:34] on
[58:48] to be a pastor
[58:54] man over there where i keep my horses
[58:57] and i was gonna bring you guys the video
[59:00] um the guy who owns a bunch of sheep
[59:03] [Music]
[59:13] [Music]
[59:19] [Applause]
[59:20] [Music]
[59:23] there's even one that he just even loses
[59:25] his voice
[59:31] and i'm like man
[59:33] and the lord tells me that's exactly
[59:35] what the pastor deals with
[59:43] right back to
[59:45] back to the backslide
[59:48] right
[59:49] so samuel was commissioned to go down
[59:51] there
[59:53] or excuse me
[59:55] and destroy everything utterly
[59:58] everything
[1:00:40] i have a
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:02:17] because he had formed his own opinions
[1:02:27] of christ of his day
[1:02:30] jesus christ being the same yesterday
[1:02:46] right
[1:02:50] and on the sabbath day in in itself and
[1:02:52] here's the pharisees and described they
[1:02:54] come to him
[1:02:57] and they say hey
[1:03:00] what are you doing picking
[1:03:57] jesus have you not ever read the
[1:03:59] scripture
[1:04:02] where david was in hungary
[1:04:07] they ate the shoe bread
[1:04:50] but as long as you don't recognize the
[1:05:07] now aorta
[1:05:10] we must stay focused
[1:05:14] now i don't know a lot of things
[1:05:18] but i do know
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:49] right and just because you ride a bull
[1:06:50] doesn't make you a cowboy or a horseman
[1:06:58] right
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:07] is
[1:08:20] [Music]
