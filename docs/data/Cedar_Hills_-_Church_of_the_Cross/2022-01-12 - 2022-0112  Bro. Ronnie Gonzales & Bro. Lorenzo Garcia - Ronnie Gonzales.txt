the house of the lord this evening amen wait for the musicians to sit down amen if you would turn into your bibles to a very well known scripture [Music] ephesians chapter four and we're going to start with verse three endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace [Music] there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all through all and in you all [Music] with above all through you all poor and annual but unto every one of us is given the grace according given is of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all things and one of our known scripture here or verse are you part of the sam for the perfecting of the saints [Music] unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ you may be seated [Music] we because the lord preached to me all weekend you know a lot of times we don't know when the lord's going to speak to us or by whom he's going to speak we uh a lot of times we are speaking for myself we don't catch when the lord's going to speak to us on that friday afternoon [Music] it was kind of it was it was real real basic you know i was i was working i think i was like one of the last ones there to the concert i had to walk in front of about about a thousand people so i was kind of a little embarrassed but it's all right so so so the teacher the band teacher he gets up el maestro and so he he began to um you know just talk to us the different things that they have done there were some kids out there was their first year playing instruments some had been [Music] you know and uh so so he began to i don't know much about music okay i've always wanted to learn how to play it but probably not but um those who play music instruments maybe they'll know a little bit of what i'm talking about here so my boy nathan hip again he plays the trumpet he says he want to play the trumpet because tommy played the trumpet but um so at first and what i'm going to say is there's nothing nothing new we've heard this before so first the the the teacher gets out there he says first of all they have to learn to play the trumpet they have to learn how to put their mouths in a certain you know a certain way [Music] first of all you have to put your hand like this to using the mouthpiece now this evening now where i believe we're i'm amongst eagles take the take the types take the symbols okay so so my so my little boy again you know before he can learn to play the trumpet he had to use the mouthpiece and then he used the trumpet all right i want you guys to play the way the way you guys first played the trumpets were blowing the violins were going on the percussions were going it's it's you know it was just a bunch of racket then he says okay now let's show them what you've learned so they started playing jingle bells jingle bells it was a big difference between the racket from they first started to playing jingle bells jingle bells so that was on a friday and i didn't think much of it until saturday you know again zoe plays the violin and they went with sister emma she also plays the violin [Music] so we were there and as we were walking in we could hear the music playing we walk into the place we were supposed to and trauma brother diego and sister margaret we're there margaret and we went to go sit with them that was just their you know the the um the professional orchestra for you know for the areas and something caught my attention and i was like oh man that's when the lord began to speak to me and then i was like oh i was like and then the lord like he shows and speaks to himself in mysterious ways now now in this symphony india in this orchestra so so in my boy's class i don't know if you've ever been to an orchestra you know they're they're always dressed the same the standstills always dressed in black you know and uh and uh so i i wondered why and zoe says he says well it's because they don't want you to focus on them they want you to focus on the music man so i began to i began to think i was like there now it doesn't matter where you are and you walk with the lord maybe you just started started your walk with the lord maybe we've been coming to church for 50 years you know we must all be dressed the same thing we must all be dressed with the word again it doesn't matter if you you're just starting off or maybe you could take a slide by because you've been coming to church for 50 years or in in south america and america we must all be dressed the stage the word doesn't change from from region to region from different countries about different spices it's all the same another thing that i noticed and the people in the orchestra they're all in their place when they're all in their place it's like a fan like an arc like a like like uh like a rainbow right and uh i began to see that but i was like man that's all aren't we like a covenant people are we a covenant people almost enter are you a covenant people are seeding and it was all it's like like a rainbow or a fan in informatica and then the thing this thing kind of this thing hit me i know i'm going a little bit slow but just because the musicians had their their their instruments [Music] they were in their post of duty doesn't mean that they were plain that's right yes sir hey man we think we're in our post of duty many times even had this in my notes but they had they had the wooden beams lined with gold um [Music] and you get the person that plays the drums to try to play the guitar now you try to get that same person that plays the guitar or the violin and you try to put them with their same sheet music to play the drums it's going to be a mess it's going to be a racket and many that and that's how we we must be sometimes we're gonna make a mess another thing that i noticed and this is the biggest thing that caught my attention right here i turned around i looked at brother diego diego this this buddy doesn't know that he's preaching to me in the amateur level in the professional level he was there and before they were going to play antos he would do this i kind of think follow me why is this kid snapping at my kid and then i was like okay that's kind of kind of a little weird again i don't know nothing about the music but then on the professional level you know before this conductor let me read a little bit here what the conductor doesn't the conductor not only directs they are teachers ensuring that everyone is taught how to play their own part okay now now the guy that plays the drums and the guitar he's got a specific sheet of music for himself specifically now the conductor now he can tell you he can you know by looking at this sheet of paper or this book he can control the bass the guitar [Music] how many are happy for a guide of music to which they make a certain adjustments such as in tempo articulation phrasing repetitions relay their vision to the performers take it and type the conductor keeps an orchestra or to all of the messages of our founding pastor that brother caleb doesn't teach any different different amen so what would the conductor say stay together that's that's what the message of the con that's the message that the conductor is relaying to the to the to the orchestra [Music] is brother ronnie the holy ghost does that [Music] that's right amen amen but where is the holy ghost and you'll see here in a minute i'm like just keep on reading i know it's a little slow today a conductor serves as a messenger for the composer right it is their responsibility to understand the music the sport the book all the notes and convey through it and convey through gestures so transparently that the musicians in the orchestra understand perfectly about your leader you know but here but he's he's he's uh he's relaying this message through gestures and everything perfectly to the people i was like okay but then the professional now so it's getting good for me messages are all this is good stuff amen i wish your password get up here and continue on yes amen i'd like to give them my spot right i tell brother kaleb all the time don't call me to preach put yourself or put somebody else that likes to [Laughter] now now now this this uh this conductor again he is the messenger for the composer and i thought to myself and they say we don't need a fightful ministry you know my my daughter zoe me me kazooie she'll be there in the house and she'll be playing the violin she'll be in the room in the garage [Music] she's got to report how she sounds for the teacher come on and even though it sounds beautiful it doesn't have the same as if it's when the rest of the orchestra and orchestra but she's practicing at home she gets we're supposed to get our sheet music we get the conductor is one of the most recognizable figures in the musical world [Music] waving their mysterious ones but it's more accurate to think as conductors as silent musicians whose instrument is made of people so how do they make music while the musicians are sitting in their post of duty okay so this is how it happened so the the orchestra was ready to go [Music] he you talked is what does he raise he raises the wand what did brother caleb he was talking about this the menorah right it was the changing of the beat this beginning of this year peter and the wolf he raises the raises first of all because it has to be to our leader to the guy to the messenger first of all has to come to the head of the house is that right man that's correct heads of the house was it the word had to come to you first doesn't it's an awakening for the musicians they're there take your breath if you got an instrument then you need to blow so what does he do guessing through the sweeping and the waving of his hands his body gestures over here he's controlling the flu with his hands everything you move is controlling over here [Music] the brothers the conductor is simply doing what the composer said the conductor is a messenger he gets a message from the composer [Music] it's not the same when you listen to it on the youtube or whatever youtube when you hear it live yeah it's it's moving what do people say they made the music come to life resurrecting or awakening but the musicians make it alive well they press play because they don't want the responsibility for themselves right but wait a minute are we waiting for just brother caleb to uh to make it alive that wouldn't that be the same thing in a smaller scale as long as as long as brother caleb makes it alive no no no no no [Music] now to you adults only the composer knows what it really and means it to those who are listening are you interested in knowing what the drama is but you'd have to know about the symphony first of the music it throws it something is going it's some sometimes it's going
