[30:36] house for the lord
[30:38] i can't hear you how many are truly
[30:41] happy to be in the house
[30:45] you know brother branham says this is
[30:48] the quietest place you're ever going to
[30:50] live in
[30:51] lugar you go to hell
[30:55] it's going to be loud there you go
[30:58] there's going to be a lot of weeping
[31:01] a lot of crying
[31:39] and it reads like this see i see and he
[31:42] said a certain man
[31:43] had two sons this is jesus speaking
[31:50] luke 15 11.
[31:57] and the younger of them said to his
[31:58] father father
[32:00] give me the portion of goods that
[32:02] falleth to me
[32:11] and he divided unto them his living and
[32:13] not many days after the younger son
[32:16] gathered all together and took his
[32:18] journey into a far
[32:19] country
[32:22] party
[32:31] and their wasted substance with
[32:33] righteous living
[32:41] and when he spent all there arose a
[32:42] mighty famine in that land and he began
[32:44] to be in wand
[32:51] and he went and joined himself to a
[32:53] citizen in that of that country
[32:55] and he sent him into the fields to feed
[32:57] swine
[33:07] and he would feign have filled his belly
[33:08] with the husk that the swine did eat
[33:11] and no man gave unto him
[33:25] amen you may be seated i mean
[33:28] so i want to just share a little
[33:29] testimony
[33:32] you know our pastor was saying this
[33:33] morning how satan would love to just do
[33:35] away with the ministry
[33:46] the other day my wife was going to the
[33:48] dry cleaners to pick up some of my or
[33:50] drop
[33:50] off some of my suits
[33:56] and she took a route that she normally
[33:58] don't take it
[34:03] and she was sitting at a red
[34:16] well just seconds later a car came
[34:18] flying through ran a red light
[34:21] she had our children with her orlando it
[34:24] was just
[34:26] who knows what would have happened but
[34:28] god's hand was there
[34:32] and that situation was avoided
[34:36] so you know just we got to be ready
[34:40] we never know when god would call one of
[34:42] us home
[34:45] we gotta love each other take care of
[34:48] each other
[34:50] now i want to ask you tonight what are
[34:51] you expecting
[34:54] are you expecting just to come sit here
[34:56] and and just hear another
[34:58] sermon and go off and keep living the
[35:00] same way we're living
[35:04] ceremonies
[35:07] i want to read you something out of the
[35:08] message desperations
[35:14] brother branham says the signs of his
[35:16] coming should throw every member of
[35:17] christ
[35:18] into desperation now
[35:26] about our souls our
[35:35] well what are we going to amount to if
[35:36] we gain the whole world
[35:40] what are we living for de que estamos
[36:11] and so desperate for god is so desperate
[36:15] for that journal of life like we heard
[36:17] this morning
[36:21] to just drop down in our soul
[36:37] that we just read in luke chapter 15 in
[36:41] san lucas capitulo cinco and maybe just
[36:43] dramatize it a little bit and bring it
[36:45] to today
[36:48] so we find out that jesus is telling his
[36:50] disciples
[36:55] a parable of a certain man who had two
[36:57] sons
[37:02] and the younger son you know he gets
[37:03] this bright idea one day
[37:08] because in those days the sun always
[37:10] fell air to the inheritance
[37:17] and he gets this idea he says you know
[37:20] what
[37:21] is high school this message that my
[37:23] parents follow
[37:24] este mensaji mis padres segen this whole
[37:27] religion thing
[37:30] is it's not for me
[37:32] no espara me it's too strict
[37:35] who can live this message that the
[37:37] prophet talked about
[37:38] [Music]
[37:41] this ain't real so he said you know what
[37:47] dad why don't you just give me what
[37:48] pertains to me
[37:52] all that you've worked for all these
[37:53] years
[37:56] and it's my inheritance why don't you
[37:57] just give it to me and i'll just be on
[37:58] my way i don't
[37:59] i don't want nothing to do with this
[38:00] life jasmino porquino melo azami
[38:05] and you know the father he invested time
[38:07] in his sons
[38:12] he was heartbroken to hear this
[38:16] so what do you mean son why do you what
[38:17] do you want to leave for yeah
[38:20] there's nothing out there for a
[38:22] christian man like you no no
[38:25] christianity the father knew that once
[38:27] he got out from under the blood of his
[38:30] home
[38:38] every trap that satan had set out for
[38:40] him he was he was going to get him and
[38:42] the father knew that
[38:44] satan
[39:00] you have everything here you have a
[39:01] mother that loves you
[39:04] we have servants that feed you every day
[39:08] wash your clothes your mom stays home
[39:12] since you were little and takes care of
[39:13] you
[39:16] what do you have to what do you why do
[39:17] you want to leave us
[39:19] he says you know what dad i i just don't
[39:21] want this i'm i'm out of here and i
[39:23] i just want what pertains to me and i
[39:24] want to go
[39:26] illio
[39:34] he says well if there's nothing i can do
[39:36] to change your mind i'll divide the
[39:37] inheritance
[39:38] and you'll take your goods
[39:47] you know isn't that the way a lot of us
[39:49] get as young people i know i got there
[39:54] you turn
[39:58] because that's the age that the world
[40:00] says we can move out right
[40:04] and we've always done things according
[40:05] to what the world tells us
[40:15] you shouldn't leave your house no ideas
[40:18] they had to casa until you know for sure
[40:20] that you have the holy spirit
[40:37] old you have a car
[40:40] in car maybe you have a cell phone
[40:43] you're ready to go right with those two
[40:44] things that's all we need
[40:48] okay well what happens when you have to
[40:49] pay rent que
[40:52] what happens when you have to go buy
[40:53] groceries
[40:57] what happens when you have to put gas in
[40:58] your car
[41:00] gasoline the list goes on you have to
[41:03] estus
[41:04] that's the dumbest idea i've ever heard
[41:06] it is
[41:08] it really comes down to this one thing
[41:11] what is it that you want to do so bad
[41:13] that you can't do under the roof of your
[41:15] parents home
[41:18] why
[41:22] we know we want to get where we can do
[41:23] our little things in private enough to
[41:25] answer to anybody right
[41:30] and that's wrong we should know
[41:34] it be on a shadow of a doubt what we're
[41:35] getting into when we do those things
[41:39] in so you know the young guy decides i'm
[41:41] out of here
[41:45] i don't care what my parents say you
[41:47] know important
[41:49] i've talked to the pastor i don't care
[41:50] what he says
[41:52] i don't even care what my brother says
[41:56] all he did is he wanted his his allotted
[41:58] goods and he was going to just take off
[42:00] solo querias
[42:05] so i want to just tell you guys if you
[42:07] haven't figured it out we're talking
[42:08] about the prodigal son
[42:13] of land
[42:18] and the word prodigal means wasteful
[42:23] significa
[42:28] luxuriant luho hi rolling
[42:32] al alta a altafama or reckless
[42:36] disaster so that word reckless caught my
[42:38] attention
[42:42] disastrous some time ago i was listening
[42:45] to that song i'm sure you all have heard
[42:46] it and probably liked the song
[42:49] the reckless love of god right how many
[42:52] have heard that song
[42:53] how many likes is
[43:04] so i started to think about you know is
[43:06] god reckless
[43:07] coming
[43:11] and so i i wanted to see what the
[43:13] prophet had to say about it
[43:17] so i typed in the word reckless
[43:22] turns out he's mentioned it about 17
[43:24] times
[43:27] and every time he mentions it he's
[43:30] referring to
[43:31] reckless driving
[43:35] reckless living reckless
[43:59] idiotic well-fed self-styled
[44:02] rock and roll gang sorry
[44:07] reckless careless life
[44:10] and reckless holiday i was like man
[44:15] that song's not good like god's love is
[44:17] not reckless
[44:34] knowing that the commandment was great
[44:39] but having assurance
[44:43] he could be fearless
[44:46] he could be as we'd call it reckless we
[44:59] he might break up against a hill that
[45:00] would knock him backwards
[45:11] so can the church of the living god be
[45:14] reckless and fearless
[45:30] oh he
[45:35] [Music]
[45:41] he says it's not easy for a person to go
[45:43] to hell no
[45:56] the first cigarette you ever smoked you
[45:58] knew it was wrong
[46:01] your conscience told you it was wrong
[46:04] but you continually run through the red
[46:06] light
[46:10] run over the barricades pasta
[46:31] his parents told him don't go that way
[46:33] son
[46:35] but his mind was already made up
[46:38] his ambition was to leave his household
[46:41] to ambition
[46:43] and do what he wanted to do yesterday
[46:46] so he leaves home and he gets the idea
[46:48] you know what i'm going to move to the
[46:49] city
[46:54] this town that we live in there's no
[46:55] opportunity
[46:59] the program i want to get into they
[47:01] don't even offer it at this college i'm
[47:02] going to move to the city the program
[47:04] no no no foreign
[47:09] and as soon as he gets there he's living
[47:10] it up he's got a pocket full of cash
[47:16] him and some buddies were going to rent
[47:17] a house
[47:20] they had it all ironed out well things
[47:23] are good for probably the first two
[47:24] three weeks
[47:28] they're having parties every night
[47:32] doing whatever they wanted to do they
[47:35] didn't have a job so they were just
[47:36] living off the inheritance
[47:41] but let's fast forward about three weeks
[47:45] and you find the same young man
[47:47] encuentros
[47:50] from all the friends left dolos amigos
[47:54] fueron
[47:54] stopped paying rent they all had to move
[47:58] out
[47:59] the party was all broken up
[48:03] he found himself in a terrible condition
[48:04] cinco de luca
[48:06] started doing things he never thought he
[48:08] would do haciendo
[48:10] took a little hit of weed smoked a
[48:14] couple cigarettes
[48:16] before you know he was so drunk he
[48:17] didn't even know his own name
[48:26] and all i could think about was his
[48:29] father's voice
[48:32] don't
[48:38] and all these memories started playing
[48:40] back when he was a kid
[48:44] going to church going to sunday school
[48:55] you know it's real fun when we can live
[48:56] under our parents roofs and go out and
[48:58] do what we want to do
[49:00] is
[49:03] maybe just mess around with sin a little
[49:05] bit
[49:07] knowing that we can go home to a nice
[49:09] clean house
[49:11] olympia where our mom maybe makes our
[49:13] bed
[49:18] but once you're actually living in the
[49:20] sin like brother will said some weeks
[49:21] ago
[49:25] you realize it's not so cute
[49:29] because you can't go home to that nice
[49:31] clean house anymore
[49:35] you're stuck in that pig
[49:39] and that's where this young man found
[49:40] himself
[49:43] in control he blew all the inheritance
[49:50] and brother branham says and the portion
[49:52] that he spent was really his father's
[49:56] el gasto
[50:01] so this guy didn't appreciate the
[50:02] inheritance that was given to him
[50:07] just as it is today our parents maybe
[50:10] get us a phone
[50:13] they get us a car what do we do we trash
[50:16] everything
[50:19] because we didn't work hard for it yeah
[50:22] we want it
[50:23] we don't take care of it that's the same
[50:26] thing that happened with this guy here
[50:29] because brother branham says tested
[50:31] faith produces goods
[50:38] his faith hadn't
[50:48] you know our faith must be tested so
[50:50] that we can produce our own goods that
[50:51] our faith can produce our
[50:52] our goods in our life
[50:57] you know this man went solo
[51:01] the bible says he went and joined
[51:02] himself with a citizen of the country
[51:08] and he began feeding his pigs his swine
[51:11] so
[51:14] um
[51:17] and he says and he would feign that word
[51:20] fame means with pleasure
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] with pleasure he would eat the the husks
[51:27] that the pigs were eating
[51:31] he enjoyed what he was doing
[51:36] it's like when we go out and do the
[51:37] things that we know we shouldn't be
[51:38] doing we enjoy doing that
[51:43] why is that because inside each and
[51:46] every one of us there's a nature of a
[51:48] pig
[52:07] maybe you help out in service which is
[52:09] all good
[52:12] but until that nature of a pig that's
[52:14] inside of each and every one of us
[52:16] is
[52:31] where we do the same things that this
[52:32] young man did
[52:36] so you know he came in and he found
[52:38] himself in this condition
[52:41] and the bible says but he came to he
[52:44] came to himself
[52:47] you know he was sitting there estas in
[52:49] tandoyi brother branham says and the
[52:50] angel of god came to him
[52:55] he said wake up
[52:59] he talked to him he said oh why don't
[53:02] you just get back home to them parents
[53:04] of yours
[53:08] you know they've been praying for you
[53:11] why don't you wake up and get on home
[53:16] and the boy you know he began to think
[53:17] of his father
[53:21] he had servants
[53:24] and here he was living like a pig
[53:28] and he said man i can't go home
[53:31] look at the way i i'm living
[53:35] i don't have close fit to walk on the
[53:37] property of the where we live nothing
[53:40] buena
[54:04] they wanted him home more than he wanted
[54:06] to be home hello
[54:20] for all the goodness of heaven belongs
[54:22] to the church
[54:27] so he came to himself he realized you
[54:30] know what i don't want to live this life
[54:33] i've had enough i think i will go home
[54:39] so you know he goes he starts making his
[54:41] way home
[54:45] and the bible says and he arose and he
[54:47] came to his father
[54:51] and when he was a far ways off the
[54:53] father had been waiting there for him
[54:58] maybe every evening the father would go
[54:59] and pray in the window
[55:03] just praying that one day he'd see his
[55:05] son coming home
[55:08] this evening he was he was praying just
[55:10] like every other day
[55:14] and he looks up and here comes his son
[55:18] and the son comes and they embrace each
[55:20] other
[55:23] and he's so ashamed because he knew the
[55:25] life that he'd been living
[55:29] and his father right away says you know
[55:31] what
[55:32] this calls
[55:43] and you know what he did he went and
[55:46] slaughtered a fatted calf
[55:51] the best robe that he had on his son
[55:56] put a ring on his finger who said this
[55:58] one's mine
[56:00] he and it was a glorious time
[56:05] gloriosa and you see the father wanted
[56:08] him home more than he wanted to even be
[56:09] home
[56:14] so i just asked you this evening where
[56:15] do you find yourself
[56:19] maybe you say brother aaron i've never
[56:20] left home
[56:23] i've never done anything near as bad as
[56:24] this product
[56:28] well like i said
[56:41] as long as that nature's still inside of
[56:43] you
[56:44] the wages of sin is death
[56:50] we must come to a true repentance
[56:55] and that's just what this young man did
[56:56] yesterday
[56:58] as soon as he saw his father he said
[57:01] father forgive me
[57:04] i've sinned against heaven
[57:10] and that's the key there yeah we can
[57:13] repent all we want to god for the things
[57:15] we've done
[57:18] but until we repent to our parents
[57:23] confess the things that we've done wrong
[57:26] those things will just stay there
[57:30] i pray that this was a blessing for you
[57:31] this evening
[57:34] god bless you
[57:57] amen may god richly bless you
[58:06] it is surely a privilege to be here uh
[58:08] this evening
[58:12] it is a privilege to be here this
[58:14] evening amen
[58:17] it's an honor for me to uh to greet the
[58:19] bride of jesus christ
[58:20] yes
[58:25] amen would you please stand and let's
[58:27] let's get into right into the scripture
[58:35] to proverbs 18.
[58:40] 24.
[58:45] a man i'll wait till you guys get it
[58:48] you have it can you say man
[58:52] a man that had friends must show himself
[58:55] friendly
[58:56] amigos and there is a friend that stick
[59:01] it closer
[59:02] than a brother
[59:10] and if you could turn to proverbs 27
[59:12] verse 9
[59:16] proverbial
[59:28] the sweetness of a man's friend by
[59:29] hearty counsel
[59:33] amen may god add his blessings to the
[59:35] reading of the word and he may be seated
[59:41] so today we're going to talk about
[59:43] friends vamos avalarde
[59:49] who is friendly today
[59:52] who has a lot of friends juantos amigos
[59:56] so the thing in now right with my young
[59:58] generation
[59:59] entonces la cosa principal con mi
[1:00:01] generation
[1:00:02] is the more friends you have mas amigos
[1:00:05] the better lo i don't think it's better
[1:00:09] but that's what they think
[1:00:10] yes
[1:00:13] and many choose after a lot of friends
[1:00:18] de muchos amigos because on their social
[1:00:19] media page they can prove
[1:00:22] socialism i have a thousand people
[1:00:25] following me
[1:00:40] and maybe you see you make a friend
[1:00:43] amigo you might see him at the store
[1:00:47] your parents are who's that
[1:00:51] oh that's my friend amigo i don't know
[1:00:54] about that i don't think they're going
[1:00:55] to be friend
[1:00:56] for that much longer
[1:01:00] because it's not about quantity
[1:01:05] it's about quality because
[1:01:08] you can have a thousand bet or a
[1:01:12] thousand bad friends
[1:01:16] amigos which is so much less than having
[1:01:19] one
[1:01:20] true friend yes
[1:01:24] so i want to take you on a little
[1:01:26] journey right
[1:01:31] because i'm going to list you all the
[1:01:33] different types of bad friends
[1:01:38] all right and you might find yourself
[1:01:40] where you're like hey i
[1:01:42] think i that guy used to make that
[1:01:43] example used to relate to me
[1:01:50] so a lot of people get misinterpreted or
[1:01:53] or
[1:01:53] use this phrase as an acquaintance they
[1:01:56] think that's their friend
[1:01:57] much
[1:02:00] but a quaintest is peru
[1:02:04] there's a familiarity with someone ayuna
[1:02:06] family
[1:02:08] but it's not a personal relationship
[1:02:13] you might have someone that's an
[1:02:15] appendage
[1:02:18] he's friendly because there's a
[1:02:21] possibility that an individual's success
[1:02:23] will help them
[1:02:28] maybe some of you might have somebody
[1:02:30] like that right
[1:02:38] a requirement placed on a relationship
[1:02:40] that depends on a certain need
[1:02:42] being met in
[1:02:45] a mistake
[1:03:23] someone that drains an individual of
[1:03:25] their energy essence or desire to move
[1:03:27] forward
[1:03:44] maybe somebody's negative right
[1:03:48] amigo negativo considers himself to be a
[1:03:50] friend
[1:03:53] but it's always pessimistic about things
[1:03:57] maybe you
[1:03:58] have a person that's non-committal
[1:04:04] it is always going back and forth on
[1:04:06] their belief
[1:04:30] it gives an impression of providing
[1:04:32] support
[1:04:37] but actively works to undermine
[1:05:05] i've had many of those friends
[1:05:19] if you want some good friends right
[1:05:22] amigos buenos amigos you can get the
[1:05:25] cheerleader right
[1:05:30] that's the type your boy is not the
[1:05:34] actual cheerleader right no
[1:05:37] this is a type okay provides direct
[1:05:39] moral support for someone's
[1:05:41] success
[1:05:48] maybe you want to hang out with good
[1:05:49] time charlie us
[1:05:54] and we're going to go out and release
[1:05:55] some stress and have a good time
[1:06:02] everybody
[1:06:04] usually you choose a friend of kindred
[1:06:06] spirit us
[1:06:11] someone that provides emotion emotional
[1:06:14] and spiritual support
[1:06:53] but there is one true friend that i have
[1:06:56] found um
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:13] but i came to tell you of a mighty great
[1:07:15] friend
[1:07:20] it may be someone who you know right now
[1:07:24] because i don't have to pull a signal
[1:07:27] just to get in touch with him
[1:07:33] sometimes we have friends that way
[1:07:34] embezzles amigos
[1:07:36] we make excuses and we don't get answer
[1:07:40] the phone because we say we had a bad
[1:07:41] signal
[1:07:48] but this friend as we heard this morning
[1:07:54] he is available
[1:07:58] and he's approachable
[1:08:01] you can call him whenever you want us
[1:08:06] it doesn't matter the time of day no del
[1:08:07] important
[1:08:09] he's not closed on the weekends
[1:08:13] but you know he's always waiting
[1:08:17] i hope somebody calls me today
[1:08:21] i hope i can make make myself known to
[1:08:24] them today
[1:08:26] because he wants you he wants to know
[1:08:28] all of your troubles
[1:08:32] maybe he knows who this is
[1:08:56] but let me give you an example of people
[1:08:58] who have been friends
[1:09:19] why he might just call you by your name
[1:09:22] and raise you out of the grave
[1:09:27] well if you've been on a boat
[1:09:31] and maybe your life is rocking around
[1:09:37] i don't know if you believe me right now
[1:09:40] i was on a boat
[1:09:44] and sometime my life seems like it it
[1:09:46] doesn't
[1:10:01] all you had to do is just wake him up
[1:10:05] and he would calm your storm
[1:10:10] if you've been blind
[1:10:14] and this man's your friend yesterday
[1:10:16] hombres to amigo
[1:10:17] why he will just restore your sight
[1:10:21] to vista if you ever felt see us
[1:10:26] like you've been sifted like by like
[1:10:28] wheat
[1:10:38] he prayed that your faith would fail you
[1:10:42] yeah
[1:10:44] if you were found accused by the
[1:10:46] pharisees and sadducees
[1:10:50] or maybe just your brethren
[1:10:55] and they were about to stone you with
[1:10:57] their words
[1:11:03] why this and this man was your friend
[1:11:05] yes
[1:11:06] to amigo he would get down and ride in
[1:11:09] the sand
[1:11:10] is
[1:11:25] yeah amigo if you happen to be born in
[1:11:27] sin
[1:11:30] shaped in iniquity come to this world
[1:11:34] speaking lies
[1:11:38] and this man is your friend
[1:11:41] oh he would just come down from glory to
[1:11:45] gloria to become a man
[1:11:50] die on a cross he would
[1:12:34] [Applause]
[1:13:02] he's been your provider
[1:13:07] if you've been healed if you've been
[1:13:10] saved
[1:13:12] if you've been sanctified and you know
[1:13:15] this man is your friend
[1:13:29] but maybe somebody doesn't know who this
[1:13:31] is
[1:13:33] so tell me who is this friend
[1:13:39] no just tell me who just say who is this
[1:13:41] friend
[1:13:44] thank
[1:13:58] a friend we have in jesus amigo tenemos
[1:14:01] and jesus
[1:14:02] he wants to fellowship with you tonight
[1:14:08] and he said his precious blood for you
[1:14:10] to yes
[1:14:26] somebody knew who their friend was
[1:14:29] to amigo ain't nobody no i'm not yet do
[1:14:32] me like jesus
[1:14:36] is that anybody tonight
[1:14:39] ain't nobody tells me like the
[1:15:07] but you say brother the bible never said
[1:15:11] that jesus was getting crazy like you
[1:15:13] are
[1:15:13] la vivre
[1:15:18] he never acted like you know running
[1:15:20] around doing helicopters
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:49] so jesus he spoke these words jesus
[1:15:53] in john 15.
[1:16:00] this is my commandment
[1:16:03] that ye love one another
[1:16:19] that a man lay down his life for his
[1:16:21] friends
[1:16:23] amigos he said ye are my friends
[1:16:26] vosotros
[1:16:27] miss amigos if you do whatsoever i
[1:16:29] command you
[1:16:34] henceforth we heard this more this
[1:16:36] morning
[1:16:41] i call you not servants for the servant
[1:16:45] knoweth not what his lord doeth
[1:16:54] for all things that i've heard of my
[1:16:56] father i have made known unto you porque
[1:16:59] de las cosas

[1:17:16] are around you
[1:17:20] for a good mom and dad
[1:17:25] the soul desires that they want the holy
[1:17:27] ghost for you
[1:17:43] to our pastor ami pastor who is
[1:17:46] preaching constantly behind his desk
[1:17:54] italian has to have a personal
[1:17:55] relationship with jesus christ
[1:18:04] and that's what we've been instructed to
[1:18:06] do because we believe it
[1:18:10] is
[1:18:20] some people don't want to be intimate or
[1:18:22] have a face-to-face
[1:18:24] conversation
[1:18:54] nothing like a hug
[1:18:59] i know because i'm a hugger
[1:19:03] that's just who i am
[1:19:07] but there's nothing like being in the
[1:19:09] presence of the lord
[1:19:13] that's the key yes you got to be in
[1:19:16] his presence
