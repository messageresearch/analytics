got out i was i was in tears [Music] and the thing about it was is like i i i was still looking at court dates and this last past week i had my court yes and it was over the phone so yeah you know the devil's been coming at me and and throwing obstacles and diablo it was just that day that i had court it was just a battle yes and i i was on the verge of just giving up and just the heck with it but like a piece came over me and that's when i knew that that god had a place for me here yes i was on the phone i i had a pin number that i had to put in and i'd go in and it wasn't working it wasn't working so i i just said you know what you know the devil is fighting me so bad that means god is working significantly so like i didn't even go i winded up not even going to court i called my my uh pre-trial service uh officer in ifuyake and and i called him and he said hey how's it going like what's going on like just the tone in his voice i knew that everything was going to be all right because he was saying like what are you doing calling me so i told them well i'm trying to go to court but the pin number's not working i can't get into the courtroom [Music] all my i just want to give him the honor and glory gloria and thank him for his grace and mercy gracious thank you wow thank you brother for that testimony how many are just in love with jesus amen you should stand to your

[Music] there's no place i'd rather rather be cause there's no place i'd rather rather be i love you lord my [Music] is [Music] i love you lord [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hey [Music] we have come to the most important part of the service we have our ministers brother henry bernal brother danny esquivel and my father brother juliano sorio amen how many are expecting great things tonight from the lord amen see what the lord has done oh see what the lord [Music] let's see what the lord [Music] oh [Music] lord has done [Music] the lord [Music] is [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] uh as we've been talking on modern events made clear by prophecy uh it was our part to talk about the scientific nostoka diablo a natural heavens open the [Music] for the lord says and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth the stress of nations with perspective perplexity the men's heart failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken [Music] [Music] all right god bless each and every one of you so it fell on our lot to speak on these subjects and say is and uh so i i kind of started you know kind of going through it a little bit and i kind of just didn't really understand like you know just talking about nature right so then you start thinking about nature and just the things that are natural things going on and so i really didn't know what or where to start but then the holy spirit came to santo and as he opened it up it's nothing like what you think right so we just read right now in the scripture that uh there would be signs right and so we heard last wednesday uh tremendous by brother abraham is and so um we see here that as the scripture says that men's hearts are failing for fear and we found out sunday in controversy domingo right that fear um what would cause fear right well the bible says as we heard on sunday domingo that my people perish for the lack of knowledge right so for the fact of knowledge right you you become very fearful if you don't have the knowledge of what something's going to be you're you're very fearful in the message the knowledge is there our founding pastor says many people have fear of death they're so fearful they're scared of biting their nails pulling their hair out destroying themselves why okay for the lack of knowledge right and so that's the key is if you go into politics it's a it's a fight between two two opposing um yeah opposing um ideologies or political stances and they accuse the other side of being against science yeah and then so the other side says it's um is propaganda and politically based established in the political scientific science the sense yeah okay so the great debate is whether global warming is true so they're trying to suppress those they're trying to do away with those things when the other site says is this how can this be man-made so the element that they're missing well they they i mean is the earth heating up right is it g oh brother brown says and motherboard how old is uh global warming then it was nothing but a big ball of water went off like that and moved into space the millions below zero immigrants it formed moisture so the heat from the sun began to to melt off or heat the earth so then global warming was from the beginning so it ran in perfect harmony right it was in god's plan but then because of the interruption of nature because of sin well that's natural eso is natural right so what's causing all these fires right so some scientists say algunos decent that just the heat of the earth right and so the earth has gotten so hot right and so what causes natural fires they planned these like some of these fires were prescribed fire yeah but what the scientists or meteorologists didn't realize and couldn't predict was right and so what causes wind right it's it's caused by the barometric heat it is a color barometric right and and it causes more unusual wind than what you normally see abnormalities so that was one thing that they didn't um foresee and then there's also um um natural right and so so i was like well what is having fires what is fires enthusiasm we live in such a watered down society that you can't even speak the truth without them blowing up was did you start it by arson on your own how did this forest fire start inside of you now what are these forest fires what are these fires that have been started so just as a little side note is so these fires not only of these forest fires going on since january of this year i'm not going to go 21 food processing plants in the u.s now how coincidental is i mean is it just and if coincidence went through the list they're meat packing meat packing processing plate facilities poultry las okay so so then now so we start to find out back to the spiritual part what are these fires can you read it brother julian it's going to be in uh ephesians first we'll go to ephesians 1 431 431 it says little bitter bitterness oh bitterness that's a forest fire it says it's in the u.s wrath and anger anger how many here get angry oh okay go ahead and clamor glamour and evil speaking evil speaking wow be put away from you with all melees okay so these fires have ignited inside of us entonces right this is what caused a lot of fires to go on in the in the in the people bitterness anger what we listen okay so let me go ahead and read first corinthians then into first corinthians chapter 7 8 and 9. and i say therefore to the unmarried and widows is good it is good for them if they abide as i as even as i dico los solteros fuera que darse but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn but no but the very word married casado to have a fire burning inside of you and what is this what is this burning passion desire and the sails for the things of the world for the world system what's going on in the world right and those fires begin to burn inside of us and then the wind of doctrine that we listen to logo that's going to determine how big that fire gets inside of it so we have all these fires that are burning and what is it it is there are these these fires that have been burning inside of us because we don't marry ourselves to the word of god because we're not married to him we haven't given ourselves to him he hasn't become our lord these fires are burning with inside of us you begin to become destroyed because of lack of knowledge because of the lack of of joining yourself to the lord right we think that god's going to just wave some kind of wand over us and he's going to put out these fires he's going to be the fire extinguisher but what does he say what does first peter tell us peter 2 1. says where for lane aside all malice oh wait wait laying aside right so that's something that you got to do you got to lay it aside an old guy and hypocrisy and envy and all evil speakings so you got to rid those cell things out of out of yourself you got a work to do god's not going to wave a wand over you the only thing god's going to do is he's going to give you his word and then you gotta conform yourself to that word right so if you have a forest fire of of lust burning in science then the word of god says through a prophet turn your head that's the remedy oh god right if you have a problem in your life women they say oh well this is always following me or this is after me conform yourself to the word the word tells you how you should act and dress because god has placed in the church he has placed a spiritual husband but what happens to people they go around everywhere else the things of the world the natural okay so it signifies these three different things significa so when the world is falling apart what's it talking about the cosmos established cosmos is it talking about the planet or is it talking about the human being that's why in the message that our pastor has been preaching and the message of our founding pastor what are you referring to are you referring to the end time to the end of the world to the times of of of trouble so because they're they're they're all different they're they're different events different so if the world's falling apart right let's find out what falling means to fall down okay so then our pastor our founding pastor gives us illustrations it's him and brother abraham and brother abraham's interpreting him so so say we're walking together me he just fell out of his place his world fell apart right so right away that sends to my mind right and unless you've solely committed yourself to god right these fires that are inside of us are gonna continue to burn wanna continue we think like god's gonna just magically fix our marriage going to sprinkle some magic dust on your waist no you have a job to do right you must read yourself of if you're jealous you gotta rid yourself of them and what is the reason that we don't get ourselves don't rid ourselves of those too much tv television too much concert mucho sometimes we're sick and and and it's it's because of where what the things that we do the places that we we visit and then we imagine we automatically think i expect god to rid off of those sicknesses the fires of depression why is it today we got so much word right so much worship and yes so much depression huh why but it can because there's two forces that work in this world and it's good and evil [Music] right so man this gets really it gets deeper and deeper it says but how many know what the difference is between black magic because we're dealing with we're dealing with demonology all these things that you see going on out here are demons right and brother branham even says that some of these things that are caused these earthquakes and and all these things are caused by what's the difference between black magic and white magic right okay so black magic is used for evil is right it hides itself says right so it uses a lot of christianity it uses a lot of christian words christianos right it uses a lot of christian lyrics if i got up here and said anything contrary to this anything contrary to brother branham anything contrary to our founding pastors anything contrary to what our pastor has said yeah so feet to the a lot of them are our trinity doctors right they're trinity doctrine so what happened to the old song que paso con los or what happened to uh is there's a fountain flowing dripping with blood oh those are old-fashioned then perish in your own knowledge then entrances perez the angel of the lord has loved only rather you get married it's better for you to marry me so marry yourself to the word let's conform ourselves to the words it draws you closer closer to him it draws you to him so in closing yes um we need to find out that okay it's time for us to conform ourselves to god's word right there's no reason to be fearful the things that are going on was that you should not perish you bring to us a message and that message yesterday is the fire extinguisher and i'll turn it over to brother henry [Applause] amen i've been how many love that and whatever you think you got somewhere and they have they're under our command and their purpose is to fulfill the word of god and and that's that's the beauty of it uh talk about fires i had a little fellowship with him and we were talking about this thing that uh for uh for a fire to naturally take place or how they determine how they want to do a prescribed fire it comes which we understand that there's a lot of seeds in the woods that need heat in in bosque to burst there's some kinds of pine tree that if if the seed doesn't get so hot it doesn't come out that doesn't mean see what comes out of me was going to come out just a bad piece of charcoal but naturally there is there is there are some seeds i see me and this uh of certain pine trees that require spinos so nature uh during the during this time of the year what we know as monsoons when the rains come in that's when the fire starts keep this in mind because we haven't had a rainy season we have more fires nationwide worldwide how many it has them so worried that they're seeking the lord now so how they prescribe a fire come on they said okay okay in this region right here we haven't had a natural fire in so long so we need to burn this area right here we're gonna mark it and we're going to come back to allow that seed to burst so naturally there has to be some elements for there to be a fire in the in the in the forest and and that is of course the drought but then there's also there also has to be some humidity that the rain brings right and and a lot of times brings enough uh dude that um uh the dew drops come to us if the same amount if the the right amount of drought and the right amount of of humidity is in the area waiting for the reigning seasons to see how they're going to handle the fire esperanto and then they look behind them where there's none of these elements and then that mountain just burst up in f in flames so what they're looking here how to handle that fire behind them pirates are but they are starting without those but elements and that is because the crust of the earth is so hot yes we we call it as for the only red at the global warming commodity and this harmony was just perfect yes as we know when sin came in he broke the harmony everything was broken but he never lost its relationship with the lord and try to explain one thing or the other okay and brother branham says that in this they think they know better but it's not so the earth knows better he never lost his relationship with his mate and those are things that we we don't consider as much eso no wonder why the scripture says the god will destroy those that destroyed europe so all these things happening when they do fracking they're breaking they're messing with the fountains of the deep stun they get water out of the deep they want to put it back in tell you what if you ever want to know for sure how hot the earth is underneath take a cruise by the yellowstone national park there was a book that we were looking at with my dad yeah i had a documentary a documentary it's called new mexico it is mexico the land of sacred fires because new mexico mexico has one of the youngest volcanic activity in the united states it didn't that i don't know if you how many how many are locals from las cruces all right i would say that everybody because we're here in las cruces how many here know the place called kilburn hall kilburn hall it's a minority but there's some there's i energy suspicion and and and uh volcanic power it will produce that if that was to go off i agree to that you study because the closing statement of that scientist that did that study he said we know it's going to go off and just like that all over the united states and the world yes but this is just the earthly stuff you know rain is born rain is born in a jagged rugged lining stroud la you guys thunder is skies and if we didn't have rain we wouldn't leave isis but you see what it takes to bring rain best location thunder renos that's all this anger yeah that the company is fired and we need it um the scripture says in in in the books that we've been reading the book of luke lucas but also reads in the book of acts right after the pentecostal experience of pentecostal people was wondering what's going on with this bunch of crazies here questions are they drunk so early in the day so in the book of acts chapter two echoes capitals verse 16. mercedes he says but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel foreign the lord i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesied and your young man shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke not only in the new testament it is said during that time as we understand uh they were in in prison they were really uh slavery established incarcerated in and the lord was was talking through brother branham the other day speaking of of those days diaz what the lord had to do look at senor tucker said just to descend and take care of business here on earth i am babylonia and brother branham says i don't want to run on this if you can if you can just if you can read uh just uh this second quote yeah that one i can i can hear him say woodworm you can do it that's right but i can i can't let you i can see him reach over there and say come here to a big thunderhead hanging back yonder venga come on i'm going to drive you like horses i'm going to set you on this thunderhead this morning like a chariot i'm and crack it across the skies we could keep reading but i'm just gonna because of time's sake i'm gonna do you really think he was just trying to illustrate a good drama oh okay yeah there is no making up when it comes to the word of the lord you really can you see that that the heavens obey him when he called that and then there's another place where he's with michael wanting to come down and he told him the same thing he macosa so michael you have obey me since the day i created you miguel i can't let you go because i'm go i'm going myself this is a man-sized job intends no not to learn it takes something natural to manifest the supernatural all they know is the heavenly father but they don't know this part over there in the north i can see great big white thunderhead you know like hear him say come here everything in heaven obeys him chariot reach up get hold of a zigzag lining out of the skies and crack it across the sky was he making that story is established or what he's talking about things that we just don't see you know how much supernatural things take place before us all day long because we're too busy all those useless things that don't bring us anywhere yeah okay no syrian cannot give an immunity i'm talking to the christian estonian i'm not talking to a person that walks in civilization like a blind man i'm talking to christians that believe that we are of the supernatural world conquest see those things are things that we need to take personally it is an ongoing event you're looking at something to happen in the future like you said brother danny coming here you can go ahead and burn in your own forest fire you stepped but the scripture says uh it's not there and we see all this event when it rains and thunders this is what we see let me show you what we don't see if you show me a picture of a sprite how do you say well that's that's what i'm sorry what he's showing there is actually it's called that's called a super jet unsuper jet while thunder and lightning happens underneath they can reach up to 60 miles above the clouds they can reach across 60 miles 100 miles wide but they happen so fast and we're so entertaining the cloud and the thunder estamos that we missed the event above so when brother branham said he took lining off the sky all right that's that's the blue jet it's he actually breaks through the cloud and shoots up about 40 miles and those are greater greater events that even science don't know what to do with them you can turn the light the light on now that's that's just for illustration because the book of genesis genesis genesis 1. in the same verses he says of heaven to divide to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs for days and years we just for a testimony and we can't really enter into the depth of this or what brother daniel was speaking off and every time you see a large thunderstorm all that's happening there are signs in heaven and what brother branham was saying here local man what he had to do it was he was displaying all that just goal bring those children out of the fire in heaven something's got to be happening here on earth there is a miracle taking place somewhere there is the hand of the lord reaching out somewhere the lord is dealing with someone in particular in particular but he's showing it up here in heaven so let us open our eyes where are we oh right here okay so i found something interesting i don't know if it's a misprint no malin primeiro i i don't i don't believe it is but it had the topics which we went through and then on the side here it says ministers did you say ministers henry henry dan dan julian julian caleb nicole all right so i don't think that was a misprint oh there's more to come amen i must give up all right so so something great to look forward to algo bueno porque and as we continue with the uh the subjects it's like brother henry said it all comes together modern events made clear by prophecy so what a privileged people that we are that god sent us a prophet right and that we believe that prophet how many believe the prophet this morning heavenly father we we we beg that these words that were spoken that there may be a fertile ground and there may be life lord what you until we meet again we bless your name and we thank you for everything in the name of the lord jesus amen amen [Applause] amen let us all stand [Music] there is none like [Music] no one else can touch my heart like you do and i can search for all eternity lord and fine there is none
