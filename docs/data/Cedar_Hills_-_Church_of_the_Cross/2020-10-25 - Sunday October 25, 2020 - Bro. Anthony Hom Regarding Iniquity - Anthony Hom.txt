grace i know brother william and brother noah drew a a very cherished um thing in life a treasure an elk tag music william they're out hunting today lord your loving kindness is better than life the word that keeps us in line lord jesus father as we enter into your word we as the holy spirit would come into the word this morning they must get to speak to santovanga and break the bread of life over for us today lord god in the precious name of the lord jesus christ we pray the pressure amen amen amen let's turn in our scriptures very quickly i know you're standing so let's let's get right into the word um if you would if you would say man when you have it oh the brothers got it all right brothers okay matthew 24 12. this is a scripture as we read matthew 24 this is jesus speaking of the end time is jesus and in matthew 24 12 he says and because iniquity shall abound multiplication amen with that may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated and because iniquity shall abound the title this morning might be a little bit strange [Music] might be wondering what we're trying to get to here but the title is regarding iniquity just real quickly so that you understand what regard means it's something that value is given to is it's to acknowledge something it's to make something welcome it's to justify something that is regarding inequity and again because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax we have a lot of notes today it's a mystery um to just so you can understand how i how this inspiration came to me about iniquity last weekend i i drew one of those very cherished treasures uh on either sex bull or cow tag for muzzleloader and uh and boy that is just something that we just love to do yes i said we love going hunting um i know i see a lot of my brothers back there i love hunting as well and uh you know i just really felt i made the comment to several people uh different personas oh i'm coming back with meat either way bengali this this thought came to me something i'd been thinking about for a while but i just didn't really quite get it but i had a good friend with me a good guide brother henry um henry and uh he him and brother elijah and levi went hunting with me el emanuela manolivei you know when a brother offers to go el cunning with you you get one and boy you got your work cut out for you i'm thankful for friends like brother henry that that he was willing to do that with me gracious but uh we were we had hunted pretty hard oh the action that we saw there's no reason why i don't have any meat at all but we every time we went out it was such a good time and uh we we finally got out you know i meant this and and and i finally got the shot that i needed it was it was a we came up on this this bull that had his head in the grass the wind was in our face the lord put this this beautiful animal right in and i was already thanking the lord for the meat and uh there was only one problem his hindquarters was looking right at me and you never take a shot like that you hunters you old hunters casadores you know that very well that is you young hunters don't ever do that this homeless castle is no organization make a big mess is what you'll do so he said lord he's got a turn i can't take this i will not take this so he turned it and i let the bully go he is el tiro and it hit exactly where i am but and the big the bull he goes down brother henry's congratulating me i look up to my scope will tell me around and i see this great beast holding one arm up and crawling up on his other arm the last we saw him he hobbled off into the timberwolves by definition i hit the mark no i did exactly where i aimed but i knew in myself that was a bad decision i knew in myself even though i was able to justify it what i was doing and i had every reason and every backing to me where is we're looking we spent hours looking for him he a couple hours later we realized that he had he got harvested by somebody else but uh henry henry told me um brother anthony you'll just pray 100 anthony i believe that the lord will lead us to this help i believe he'll let let us see him that's so that's that's what the lord brought me to and thinking about iniquity yes the subject's not just deep it's a mystery a mystery is a scripture a previously hidden truth that is now divinely revealed but even though the mystery is revealed a supernatural element still remains the mystery of iniquity is one of the mysteries that the seventh angel's message it reveals brother branham tells us what iniquity is raise their hand and brother diego what is you know how to do good and not do it to know how to do good and not do it that is right that is what brother branham teaches he's located senior mana brandon to know how to do good and not do it brother branham says in the message behold greater than solomon is here he says iniquity is something that you're doing that you know you ought not to do iniquity is something that you know you ought not to do and still won't repent of it so we know the definition of definition it's a scripture that was previously hidden somebody might say well i'll stay with the revelation part of it the word says that the revelation is is god the word teaches that the revelation is one thing it is a part of it without without revelation without faith you cannot please god having the revelation without the supernatural elements paul said in first corinthians 1 13 and though i have the gift of prophecy and i understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all so and that paul summarizes all the mysteries right here pablo resume we could read this explain a little bit explicit make a little comment we'd be done in the end jesus warns us jesus and that opening scripture that we read that because iniquity shall abound the love when the bible speaks of the love it goes above any natural love or affection so agape love is supernatural so because iniquity shall abound is we confuse sin for iniquity they are very different different there are so many things we could go into on this yeah we gotta stick here with god's program but okay and the wages of sin is death the only way to be rid of sin is by the shedding of blood jesus said in matthew 26 28 this is my blood of the new testament for the remission of sins now listen close you don't you or you hear filthy things who doesn't do any of those things but you've never but if you've never received the lord jesus christ as your savior salvador you're still just a sinner and sin is still your nature is that is the apostolic in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that is the remedy it's your pardon from the wages of sin it's your escape from death jesus that's [Music] because we can do something about inequity requires work the blood of jesus christ it destroys the sin it remits the sin it sin cannot be exposed to the blood of the lord jesus christ and remain why because remission sends it back to the devil you don't hold that sin anymore is iniquity already existed we're going to read one of one of our elders one of the outstanding scriptures that he always teaches what did he cover get covered i don't know what it was he was covering and i have certified that was upon the holy mountain of god thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire i just we just leave it that he was cast to the earth down into the world it's easy to blame all the world's uh blame all the world for the world's problems easy to blame the world for our problems it's it's easy to see the world because you got to know what but james is talking about here my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in the world the same is a perfect man that you can be even so how great a matter a little fire kindleth juan grande fire a language a world of iniquity there's an entire world that can live on your little members so is the tongue among our members defile it the whole body it contaminates and set it on fire the course of nature inflammatory and it is set on fire of health my goodness feels me did you know what you got inside here your life jacket's on listen close now we work hard for iniquity iniquity is a fight it's a struggle we've heard our prophet teach that you can be baptized with the holy ghost 24 hours a day and still go to hell why because hell is a battle a battle that you fight we're going to say that again hell is the battle that you fight and you win you have to fight past the cross iniquity takes effort iniquity resulted in war in heaven we know this now we've already established establishments and all the filthy things that we can think want you to pay attention to this next part we go into take advantage i believe that we are living in the last days i believe that we are living at the end time i can't even imagine how the world could get any worse we are at the end time brothers and sisters this like i said this is this is where the road meets the rubber here how does guppy love get cold combos this is where it counts this is the supernatural element this is a supernatural element that each one of us in our lives we gotta take control of what we're doing we've got to take control of what we're saying take control of how we think having the holy ghost is having control of the situation do you have things in you in your life that you have to defend do you say or do things in your life that you have to justify let the holy spirit get into the word this morning permit him to do an inspection i'm going to repeat the last line so it'll last couple lines so they'll sink in ask do i do or say things in my life that i have to defend for my conscience sake ago again we're not talking about the low-hanging fruit attributes of sin dig in deeper into your heart you might say brother i have no idea what you're talking about you might say i don't have to justify or defend anything that i do or say by by saying that you're justifying in just about everything you say and do in your life and i'll say this your little member probably on hellfire right now defending or regarding something that you know you ought not to do takes work it takes effort we become really good become experts we become believers we can justify them and it's just like if we didn't even do it that's inequity that's a characteristic of this dark age that we live in a characteristic give a little example of this you know where are you going to be one of these days there was a story or a dream that a brother gave brother branham one time he was a minister i believe it was and uh he dreamed that he went before the great white throne he had been he really felt he was in good shape and he thought he was okay and there and there was a great light that came from the great white throne and it said and i saw all the things that i had done in my life because in his presence him would you have a representative there my goodness you can't defend puerto rico if you reject christ as your savior there are things in our lives that we know we are not adu but we regard them it's wrong it causes the love of god the wax called you vida you might do great and charitable works many times we do a lot of things for our own conscience we use the works put but what does regarding iniquity do it important to those that come in contact with you let's go back to sin for a second sin is just your problem picado is you can't have anybody else except your pardon foreign because you're only responsible for what your sin is chapter 12. this one who first regarded iniquity importance we know him as lucifer or his [Music] what does regarding iniquity in your life do to your neighbor or to your brother or sister what is it what is your regarding as a young person do to your parents what does it do to your children if you were regarding iniquity in your life how about those that you work with those that you work for okay about those that work for you how does this iniquity in your life affect them again jesus said because iniquity shall wax how can you have a fire and ice in the same elements doesn't make much sense does it not i hope this is going not just up on the on the i'm not advocating what's going on way down deep in my heart what's going on way down deep in my mind what's going on down there that's what i need that's what we need to pay attention jesus said in matthew 7 22 jesus entering works many will say unto me we have done many wonderful works in your name [Music] we have to work on those folks are surprised at the lord's response imagine living your entire life doing wonderful works in the name of the lord senior and somehow because of iniquity in my life someone was pushed away from the love of god lord help me today anybody want to say what his will is does anybody know exactly right that no one would perish his will is that none would be lost wow i know you're getting maybe a little tired i know this is a little heavy we're almost done here his will is that none would be lost how that puts things in our perspective how should we conduct ourselves his wills that none would be lost if you're of him you do his will so that means that every single soul is a significant that we come in contact with their they become our responsibility there's so much can be said on this subject but you know if if we just take note of this there's enough of what we've covered this morning that can change the world it can if any man offends not in word the same as a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body what would happen this morning what if one person in here did that today guess you're a person if one person would leave this place that's what i want to do i want the will of god what would happen if one person in this church would have compassion on every single person persona that they make contact with that's a challenge this morning to bring every single person that we come in contact with into the warmth of god's love can it be done by god's grace it is possible we can do all this is a quote from brother branham it tells us of the severity but if i regard iniquity in my heart then god will not hear my prayers wow can you imagine we think that god he sees and hears all things what a mystery give me studio but if i regard iniquity if i regard is something that you know that you're that you're doing and then look what he says you look what you say that's right brother ministers is correct it's true elijah if you just play [Music] [Music] as i see in his mirror i can see how short i fall so many times [Music] how hard we try you really look in the mirror of god's word today it will show you where we're lacking nobody has to tell you nothing nobody let the light of this gospel shine not just in the church no solo iglesia not just in the mission field but your life every day you walk in that is the mission field [Music] just raise your hands [Music] you don't want to regard iniquity in my life anymore [Music] father i submit everything that i am to you today father give me the strength lord god [Music] brother abraham would you come we have a couple of handkerchiefs here
