[Music] testing has been testing testing okay [Music] testing [Music] god bless you this evening indeed it is a privilege to address the pride of the lord jesus christ it's a privilege and an honor in [Music] so we could have these bible studies i also want to give thanks to my other nephew um sobrino because he gave me the the inspiration to bring this study dracula inspiration [Music] like i said last friday commodity i tossed the internal night i didn't know what subject to bring up and of course tommy junior didn't know this so i was talking to him and then he said he said well like if you were teaching on the book of hebrews when he said hebrews like a russian mighty wind hit me come come so before we go on this will be our second lesson on the book of hebrews let's open with the word of prayer precious and heavenly father celestial indeed it is an honor and a privilege to address your bride lord this i am venturing into this subject it's a a book that's real deep and lord it's a it's a book that hardly nobody goes deep into it and i know lord that if you if it wasn't for divine intervention lord i i wouldn't know what to speak but i want to thank you dear lord that you found favor in myself i've been the list of the ministers in this church and i want to confess to everybody that's online via internet that i am learning just like you guys as we're going to find out so i solicit your prayers in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen so as i greet everybody who is online and we're still on verse 1 and it reads this way god who has sounded right times in in diverse manners taking time passed unto the fathers by the prophets as in this last day spoken to us by his son whom he had opponent heir of all things by whom also he made the world now i'm gonna ask you a question so you can chew on it isn't he using a prophet isn't william branham our prophet prophet noah's william branham i got you thinking already myself myself he spoke to the prophet by by the prophets but brethren says that translation is not correct prophets he spoke by a prophet from prophet my question is which prophet was he talking about prophet and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell but the angel said unto him fear not zechariah for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john elizabeth and thou shalt have joy and gladness and man shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people preferred for the lord [Music] so john got the father's ready entonces juan for jesus to to for jesus to welcome the children in the fold jesus christ behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord notice this scripture i know you've read it a thousand times but did you understand it and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers it's two things right here first turn the heart of the followers to the children but in the last days the children turned the heart of the children to their fathers now this prophet and which the spirit of elijah falls as a prophet of spirit to the least will prepare the children to welcome back jesus jesus so turning the hearts of the fathers to the children convicted and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he hid of four preferred unto glory not of the jews only but also of the gentiles notice that these vessels of mercy are you prepared are you prepared preparado that's why we come to our services amnesty you know we hear we hear those tremendous uh teachings by and this ministry of john had to do with the fathers of those elect ones something and they called it righteousness the the word of god was of no effect to them but john the baptist with the spirit of elijah connelly spirit venom said it is a memorandum that they were stronger than the gates of hell and it cut at the hearts of men was about to that spirit was taken by jesus as a spirit of what tomorrow for jesus because john had to decrease while jesus had to increase essos disciple they later became the apostles and they in turn internal they became the fathers of the church but since the fathers fell asleep the church has drifted once more and paul was a messenger to ephesus and to ask the gentiles but they didn't like him the jew didn't episode has in that spirit heal all the churches people are so relaxed oh because they think that they i was uh talking to the pastor some time well let me read it then i'll explain it but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need there i write unto you why should i get here and keep teaching on the times in the seasons if we don't know about the times that that just keeps on going [Music] and that's the second time because they told the lord will you restore the kingdom at this time and the lord said yes it is not for you to know the times in the season for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night maybe next uh bible study i'll explain that because it'll take a lot of time when they shall save peace and security then sudden destruction come upon them is prevail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape destruction in when all the nations got together and they say russia and united states [Music] they talk about this oh and they pass but there are a bunch of liars they like one to another picture yourself [Music] it was talking about the future that's that's why they didn't need to know about the times in the season in the time of paul when he said it to the people so it wasn't for the thessalonians when they think their peace and safety peace and security that the only security is like a people that is prepared for they lost their first love entonces supreme is is that the churches would be in this condition which was the original pentecostal doctrine until let me stop here for a moment jesus came in four offices jesus and cuatro officios son of abraham son of man son of god son of david now i'm going to give you another question so you can chew on it i is [Music] and she said yeah but the dogs hit the crumbs that fall from those comments she said lord when she said lord brother says that awoke the holy spirit and she got what you wanted and we know of course she appeared as the son it because lord is the son of god revelation 3 20 apocalypse behold i stand at the door and knock if many men hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will stop with him and he with me the son of man or the son of because those mysterious is that is the same holy spirit back into human flesh parallels parallel the lord was there with abraham he was a human being and it has to come again when god was manifest manifested in a human being in lady austria in laodicea they put him out he was in the office of son of god establish and a grief from the church so he had to reveal himself again he listed and thou hears the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh and whether it goes so is everyone that is born of the spirit starting with verse 8. and said unto him how can these things be responded jesus answered unto him are thou a master of israel and no it's not these things respond jesus i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witnesses if i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you of heavenly things not us here they can say aki and i'm gonna give you this so you can chew on it and no man has ascended up to heaven well which is in heaven how could the solomon [Music] or standing on the earth i want you to see how privileged you and i are okay we had to lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened what for but we were just a blade of grass it was green like in the times of luther justification justification but the plan grew bigger to sanctification and by laying in the presence of the s-o-n it and iglesia so what does the sun do it bakes and all the green greenness of us amen and makes you a mature christian christian to the world and mundo the bible is a mysterious book es libro mysterioso the bible is god in word form he can only be interpreted by himself the human mind lamented humana is not capable to interpret the mind of god so if he is the only one who can interpret this book sierra estos is to whom that he could hide himself in the scriptures to the smartest theologians intelligence tied himself to the denominators he hit himself in every age he hit himself in the times of noah no and the world was made by him and his this is the book of god it is not a book of men this book exposes hear me hear me real good all you who are online abraham for instance do you think that he would have wrote a book of himself of his own cowardliness nest and that healy lied to the king already never would have he wrote a book like that how about jacob the deceiver those characters in the bible they would write only the good things then i asked the question who wrote the good the bad and the ugly guinness notice he can say hebrews 1-1 in the in the greek it says god who had long long ago or some sundry times and in different manners spoke in thai past unto the fathers by the prophets i couldn't understand this this this scripture but notice has in this last day spoken unto us by his son so if brother branham is our prophet then how he doesn't say that now he does it doesn't speak by the prophets but by his son oh thank you lord gracias when you gotta know how it is written in the scriptures he spoke by the prophets prophet and the old times antigua no poor but in peru he spoke by the prophets in the old times he could have spoken in novella it's not a man's book it's our book of god is there a scripture for it let's let's turn to second timothy three vamos and thompson's is so then it is not a book of men's writing amen amen wow thank you lord gracias so in this latest last days because you could make a mistake because the picture is clear now there was christ and the devil knew that that from the garden of eden what did the devil hear diablo that first judgment seat is and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shall thou go and thus shall thou eat all the days of thy life [Music] us i always thought that the belly was the stomach like in the belly of an airplane in miracle terms and terminology the medicals you know what the belly is from the breast there's a picture all the way to the womb i hope none in this congregation goes barely wise you might be breathing dust from the sahara what is your cars made of the ques echo sucaro of what is your tablets and your phones made of the question satan is the god of the earth noise and where do the materials to make the planes and the trains and the cars come from they come from the earth [Music] and do you love your car and your phones and your tablets more than the word of god only you can answer that question even the lord told john get away from you never know where the dust that you breathe comes from us constantly washed for that seed constantly he said i'm gonna was appointed to be that seed it was a type of the resurrection so he wandered his side in the last days by his son that he is appointed heir of all things but when it came to be the year my time is passing so i'm gonna meet him so give me a hebrews one for and we'll finish with this there's so much but we'll finish with it being made so much better than the angels as he has by inheritance inheritance of obtain a more excellent name than they echo superior if you keep reading are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation it's talking about the angels establish that though ordinarily we it is evident from the scriptures that the angels are in the company of the children of god much of the time if we realize ministers beat us that they these angels christos angeles they are right beside you in church don't they take care of us nosotros doesn't the bible says that the angels of god in kemp notice they never live hey [Music] when a person is ready to pass away from this world and in the point of death their their physical eyes physical they start dealing they hardly can see commencement oh but the spiritual eyes spiritual they open up see having brother hector if you're listening if it's okay with you to to tell the congregation what you told me is i see the angels all around me your spirit to the presence of god to talk about these things and being sincere i covered your prayers can you put that address
