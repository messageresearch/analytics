end up being a you know when somebody says oh man I was there and you're like ah I missed it but this morning we're not going to miss it it's a great EV this this day and we're happy to be here and be a part of it and so we want to get into the word right away because I got to start my stopwatch not used to doing this but we we have 45 minutes there's so much more to what we are going to say today but we want to just hit what God wants us to hit wherever we stop at at 45 minutes we're going to that's that's where it's at and we'll continue some other time this is my 18th message on the parable and this is quite a story The Law of adoption is quite a story it is an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning and so so we want to put a subtitle the mystery of his will so you ready to go everybody got a good night's rest not going to have nobody fall asleep this is a great event once again Ephesians 1 verse 9-1 when you have it you can sayen having made known unto who who who's us all right now now now you know me I like you talking to your neighbor a lot right so so you got to put your name that's what we heard yesterday you got to put your name there having made known unto Caleb he didn't make this known to everybody put your name one more time having made known unto Caleb the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which Heath purposed in himself verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him verse 11 here in whom also we have obtained an inheritance how many have obtained an an inheritance I have obtained an inheritance three being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will Matthew chap 6 9 through 9 and 10 remember it's the mystery of his will how many of you know that God's will is a mystery how many want the will of God in your life I want tell your neighbor I want the will of God in my life but the will of God is a mystery and after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done it on Earth no no no it is in everybody point to yourself thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven there's your Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated and one of the greatest Earthly stories as I said can be portrayed in understanding the law of adoption the law of ad adoption is more relevant today than it ever has been through time say Amen to that one more time the law of adoption is more relevant today than any other time in the history of mankind when we talk about the will of the father his will was not just to have children we know that that attribute of father he wanted to display it he wanted to become a father but he could not be be a father without having children but that was not the end game that was not the end of his will was just to have children but the greatest part of this law of adoption was for those children to become mature adults hello everybody I want to say it again it wasn't just about having children but it was taking those children so that they could become mature that they could understand his will and that they would want to do his will this is a hard thing because we also have a will it's called self will and we choose many things the problem is with our will is that our will doesn't take nothing else into consideration our will simply looks at what we want it it's it looks at the now and the present but it doesn't take into consideration the past present and future that's our self-will Lord this is what I want Lord do this for me now anybody anybody here guilty of that Lord do this for me and I want this Lord and help me with this let's find out a little bit about this mystery the firstborn of the family son he had great honor and usually received the largest part of the inheritance he was the successor to the patriarch and the other children they respected him and treated him as Soul the word firstborn it simply meant preeminent in status or closest in relationship why even God calls Israel my firstborn he's describing the relationship between him and Israel and any time that he would call somebody my firstborn that's what he's doing he's he's just describing the relationship but it wasn't just the firstborn that God considered as firstborn David was the youngest of all his brothers and yet in the eyes of God he called David my servant I will make him my firstborn you you see because God will is a mystery and not everybody is going to fulfill the the mystery not everybody's going to understand the mystery because not everybody is part of the purpose hello everybody I'm going to say it again not everybody has that purpose so he calls David his firstborn because David was a type of Christ now I'm putting this Foundation real quick because sheesh my time's already wow I'm gonna see if I can pause it every now and then hopefully hopefully brother is not putting it on his too it doesn't match let's go on and that's the way it is with us if we are part of his church and have been born again again who am I talking to okay okay well brother I was not the first born in my family the Bible says that his firstborn watch when we are born again we have been born into this Kingdom we have been born into his church and he calls his church the church of the firstborn all right now we're getting somewhere so when you are part of that church you are part of the firstborn because there's an inheritance that no one else can have no one else receives but you that are part of the Church of the first born we know these things and I'm just going to go through them real quick Galatians the 4th chapter we know about the air right gas you that study the scripture study the message The Heir as long as he is a child he differs nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father what is this time appointed of the father it is the time of adoption are you with me this is the time appointed the father is waiting like the father can't wait the son comes to maturity so that he can take on of the business and so that the word of the son the same as that of the father why is it because the son doesn't go by his own will the mystery has been revealed to the son and therefore the son will only do what the father shows him adoption is the placing of a son this should be ABCs to tell your neighbor adoption is the placing of a son why is it so important to us today brother Bram says because there was a dispensation of church organization there was a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and so many people stay in those dispensations but now tell your neighbor now now turn to the other side and say now but now is the dispensation of adoption oh I like that this morning not tomorrow not yesterday but now is the dispensation of adoption and all the world has been groaning and waiting for this time no I'm sorry I get a little bit little bit the Lord crazy but I I think I'm supposed to be teaching okay so I got to slow down preach teach combo you want the combo combo I'm not sure if you've noticed this now I'm sure many have before I I want to show you something right now that the life of Jesus was written perfectly under the law of adoption yes or yes all right I want you to get this this is important you only find three stages of jesus' life through the whole gospel think about it this is what it's all about when he said this is my beloved Son he's showing us that he had gone through this process the process of the law of adoption okay now now this is why it's so important there are many years of Jesus life we know nothing about my question to you is it was it not important why why are all these years missing from the Gospels you ever ask yourself I think they've tried to put out movies and and how Jesus was as a teenager and how he was as a young person but you don't find that in this in the in the gospels but there are three stages of his life number one his birth because that's the first law in the law of adoption that's the first stage the son has to be born right if there is no birth then there is no father How can there be a father without a son so the very first stage of jesus' life is the birth and through the gospels you find the birth of Jesus the birth of Jesus was on this wise and it goes on and and it even tells you about this is important now it tells you about after 8 Days his circumcision and then you don't hear nothing else about Jesus except after he's about two years old when when when the Lord tells when the angel of the Lord tells Joseph it's okay to return from Egypt back home herod's death but that's it so besides his birth and his circumcision you don't find nothing about Jesus until he's 12 years old now now think about this is the scriptures he's 12 years old and he's sitting in the temple and he's having discussions but the Bible says with doctors wait wait wait when the last time have you seen a 12-year-old having discussion with doctors but he showing us something he did not allow them to write anything else about him except the stages of the law of adoption getting and then after the 12y old story you read nothing about Jesus again for the next 18 years what happened what did he do there it's showing us something that the important part was now coming at 30 years old now we see and we and it talks about his ministry it's a pattern here I want you to see this it it also revealed to us this is the life of an Israelite male that went that that goes through this process the pattern of Jesus's life also amplifies this on a spiritual level for us and shows us how it correlates to us in the life of an Israelite boy there were three major events that we just talked about and it it drew attention to him one number one and this is the three things we just went over the first event was his circumcision now you got to get this so you get the rest of the message the the first event was his circumcision which occurred when he was about eight days old this was the moment that he was marked as a covenant man now you you got to have your spiritual caps on because you have to see that all this correlates to us spiritually how many how many believe that you you've gotten the new birth how many have been circumcised in their heart and all these things cut away there's a circumcision and the circumcision marks you as a covenant people how many Covenant people do we have here this morning praise God it marked him as that and it was celebrated throughout the community we've got another Covenant man he was still a little baby but everybody was so happy we have another Covenant man isn't that what the way we should be this morning when we saw yesterday what God did I don't know there was some 12 people that came to the Lord and we can say hallelujah this morning because more have been added to the Covenant the second major event was his bar mitzvah those of you know what I'm talking about it took place as he was about to enter into puberty the word Bar Mitzvah it actually means a son accountable or son of The Commandments and this signified that not only was he held accountable for keeping the Commandments of God but also he was to become an apprentice under his father and the family business this is usually around 12 years old have you seen the life of Jesus his circumcision 12 years old what does he declare son we've been looking for you looking for me don't you know I must be about my father's business he began to he started his apprenticeship if you would say that that's about the time brother Bram says of accountability right 12 years old when we know right from wrong we should we should know right from wrong and you're accountable for it now he he was about his father's business and he had entered into the apprenticeship under the father and he was under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father and the third event was what was known as quesia or the young man's adoption ceremony that word heia it means the son's placement it was when the male child reached what was considered to be the age of maturity somewhere around 30 years old and at this time the father of the young man would place his hand on the head of his son and openly Proclaim this is my beloved Son I am well pleased with him I bestow upon him all my riches and power and authority so that he can act on my behalf in all of my affairs okay so we come to the Lord young people yeah I don't know we have a hard time trying to understand the will of God is that right when we're young we we we've reached the age of of accountability and then we say is this all there is to it oh no oh no there's much more this 18 years we don't hear of Jesus what is he doing he's learning the father's business he may not be the most popular hello everybody he may not be the most well known you might not see him too much because he's studying he's learning but he knows that there is a time appointed of the father that's coming come on young people there's a Time appointed for every one of you a time appointed of the father when he says you've come to maturity I want to stop here for a moment there I I've told this to people before to help them but my father was was my best friend my father my dad my pops my through his ministry there was something more it wasn't just my dad's the pastor that's wonderful and I could go to hell my dad being the pastor that doesn't I don't make it home because of that I I make it because because I gave my heart to the Lord and and I went through this process and this process from birth then it comes to circumcision it comes then to the accountability but I had to learn the process of this to come to this place of a of of being of being what would we say uh the law of adoption to come here to this point and so through it all I would listen to what he had to say and I would hear him and he would say learn when I'm not here you're going to you and your brothers you're going to have to take over you're going you're going to have to do this but the first thing that I had to do was capture the vision of the father it takes time to capture this and that's what we're doing we're learning the business we're learning what it is really to understand the law of adoption the son realizes it's not my own Vision I've got to capture the vision of the father so that if the father's not here then I must do exactly what the father would have done how are with me that's what we got to do every time we're in a situation we got to understand and say what would the father do in this situation it's not to make and do your own thing that son needs to go back with the tutors and governors no fail I have failed many times and brother Caleb wanted his own will done but I had to throw that away but I I I received another will it was the mystery of his will in my life and so then I would tell them this and I would talk about my father but the greatest time to me now this is me speaking the greatest time to me was the was the day that my father said this he's not just my son he is my fellow labor in the gospel oh come on now come on now now we want to hear that we desire to hear because it shows maturity it shows you've reached a point that the father has decided I can put this in his hands now you understand the three stages then and notice that through the through all the all the uh the uh all the gospels his birth years purpose for it all Romans 8:23 then says this and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body thus this adop is not simply the matter of our coming into the family of God by regeneration of spirit but rather it is something which is the end result of God's fiery dealings with us unto the full and complete surrender of our souls for when the son comes to maturity the enemy loses his place the enemy loses his title he loses his grip on you so how do you like that which simply means disclosure it means to take off the cover therefore it has to do with the exposure of something that has been hidden from view I look at every one of you because as we grow there's a lot of things in our life it has been hidden and held in obscurity it tells us the scripture tells us it tells us the scripture tells us uhoh uh oh and right now here's the devil hanging on your eyelids you're like man why are my eyelids heavier in church I'll tell you what why cuz there's little demonal hanging on your eyelids and every now and then they're like yeah that's what happens in church right that's why when when we're watching movies you ever know that there's there's no there's no devil hanging on your oh come on wait too you're way too serious for me it's the truth about things but here we come to to know about the law of adoption that our Eternal destination has to do with this and what do we do we fall asleep because it's not fun it's not entertaining but it's out of this world if you could realize that our lives it has a Heavenly meaning that go with our Earthly story every one of you has an Earthly story but my question to you is this do you have a Heavenly meaning to your story now the Bible says that Jesus without a parable spake he not what is it that's been hidden from View come on now oh the revelation of the word the revelation of the word is for a purpose it's not to say oh Look What the Lord showed me the revelation of the word is to do one thing to activate the seed in you because what was hidden out of view the apocalypse and has been uncovered is Christ in you that's what is coming into view right now sons of God church I hope you get this through the church age they were simply children children first second third fourth fifth sixth but at the end time these children to go become mature and and all creation all Church Ages were waiting for you and I to show up to show and put into view what a mature son and daughter of God is you get this I'm sorry I get excited but but that's what was in view not even to ourselves I don't know I don't know I don't know but when he comes into view and you begin to look at yourself not just as some Mortal I'm Immortal you're Immortal but when we look at each other but we look at at ourselves not just as Mortals anymore but as redeemed [Music] Eternal wait wait wait a minute wait a minute wait how many of you have ever gone to the mirr and looked and said man I sure look good today nobody oh come on you know what if you're not going to be if you're not going to be honest with me I ain't preaching no more my last 30 minutes is going to be the 30 minute of Silence how many of you look in the mirror you know what not bad as you get older you look and you say I tell my wife I sure I sure clean up good huh how about that okay but have you ever looked in the mirror and looked in your own eyes the Bible says that the that the eyes are the window of the Soul how many have ever looked beyond your your carnal body look into your own soul and say there's an eternal part there is an eternal me inside this body on come on that's the one that's dying to get out he wants to he that's why we this this creature right here is not waiting or groaning for you this creature is groaning for me to manifest God we're always waiting for someone else to Manifest this you've got to manifest God that's why we struggle and struggle and struggle because your creature is wanting to manifest God wants to manifest what's on the inside oh Lord I'm not getting anywhere my message brother adul help me here these matur sons have surrendered fully to the will of the father Romans 121 and 2 says I beseech you therefore Brethren that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the now there's three here what is the good acceptable and perfect will of God Paul said his will has been made made known to us and I just want to tell you this morning his will is good oh come on now I want to say it again his will is good his will is acceptable his will is perfect that's we can't say that about our will but but Paul to the Romans is saying that the good and acceptable and perfect will of God that's why when when we read these things we don't understand the will of God many times it's a mystery but we've got to understand the mystery the will of God is intricate listen closely my 's are almost out okay the will of God is intricate it has and deals with so many complex interrelating parts and elements that's right you see the will of God doesn't just have to take into consideration your needs your life your petitions listen closely now this is the message now the will of God doesn't just have to do to to do that it takes into consideration those around you well Lord I I want this and Lord why don't you give me this and why don't you make me this it takes into consideration those around you the will of God is good acceptable and it's perfect it takes into consideration all those that are connected to you in the past in the present in the future this will of God is amazing it must take into consideration the prayers of those that prayed for you before it must take into consideration your prayers and it must take to consider those in the future who your prayers will affect on and on we can go for when God made a promise to Abraham his will had to make sure that that promise was passed from gener generation to generation but not just in the natural seed he had to make sure that the promise was all the way to you and I he works all things once again his will he works all things after the counsel of his will so his will gives counsel they're praying for this but years ago I can still the prayer of their mama but Lord I want to do this why can't I do it because somebody over here prayed for you and the prayer went up to the nostrils and it still smack out so good they can't go that way that way because his mama and his daddy prayed the counsel of his will I'm going to hit that one later on not today watch this now from generation to generation he works all things after the Council of his will that's why his will is good his will is acceptable his will is perfect you see in the western culture we we focus on the individual achievements right this is what I'm going to do oh I want to be this I want to do this but the Jews don't think of it like that in the he to the Hebrews the person's identity came almost entirely from his family Generation generation and he had a responsibility to keep that going why he said I am the god of Abraham of Isaac and Jacob it was the same God and that was the perfect will of God going from generation to watch this now that's why Israel and the church run parallel because their story is our story too his will has to make sure that it comes out right both in the natural and the spiritual Ephesians 15 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children wait a minute wait a minute here's the the scripture in John chapter 1 to them gave he power to become sons of God the word son there is an infant it's a baby he gave you power to be born again so that you could be a Son of God even though you were always a son but now you're manifesting it he gave us power there but now in Ephesians Paul catches the Revelation and he says the adoption of children that's the word which means the adoption Paul's not talking to these Ephesians as little kids he's talking to them as mature by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will I got a couple couple minutes now just let me just brother I just need like can you give me Grace finish this point thank you sir thank you sir and I owe you big time watch and this is this is what's tremendous the Council of his will is so amazing and that's why I thank God for a prophet because he showed us that he could not predestinate by his will the wisdom of his will he knew he could not predestinate us according to his will you know why because his will was that no one would perish so he couldn't base predestination on his will he based it upon his forn knowledge and by his for knowledge he knew who would and who wouldn't serve him predestinated Us by his forn knowledge but once he predestinated Us by his forn knowledge then predestination looks to Destiny Hallelujah I hope you get this make it as easy once again predestination then looks to Destiny and when it looks to Destiny the perfect will of God stands up again said now it's my turn I got to make sure that through their life they reach their Destiny now he's doing this by the counsel of his will and not by forn knowledge anymore he's already used the four knowledge watch this now because watch this is so tremendous by doing this he realizes that's the only way for his plan toold because his will has so many complex Parts takes into consideration all the other elements of his own nature and being it can't just act on its own it has to take everything into consideration his for knowledge his purpose his election his plan Destiny persons actors enemies it takes it all into consideration so that his will can be done can your will do [Music] that we know but that's why we know tell your neighbor his will is good acceptable perfect and that's why we know one of the greatest scriptures that is that is so misunderstood Romans 8:28 for we know that all things work together for good so misunderstood and misused I can do whatever I want anyways it all work together at the end you ain't going to make it with that mentality you'll never make it you got to take the counsel of his will and we know how many here knows why are we always worried then stressed out do we really know that all things work together for good to them that love God first of all them who are the called according to his purpose oh I like that this is so tremendous he'll make all things work together for good but only to them that love God only to them who are the called according to his purpose then how can you live outside of the conf fines of the word and still expect all things to work together for good the only good thing is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God that's why if we don't find his will we ain't going to get nowhere it's a mystery but the mystery has been unfolded and that's I took four minutes longer but I'll hit that on Sunday God bless you [Applause] amen amen how do you like that amen amig that's why he's my friend I want to have friends like that that is the word of God but how would you like to see the word of God but manifest it today it's beautiful to hear the word but we want for the word word to be manifested that it be made flesh amen amen and that's what we want to do today under a cloud of witnesses the hour have come Brethren that what I've been speaking in my past messages I've entitled the qualifications of a pastor you remember that well today I wish bring before all of you two candidates first candidate is Jud would be Juda mat other candidate is would Beth mat I wish to present and propose him to the church to put brother Judah as associate [Applause] pastor and I would like to place brother as assistant to the pastor now associate pastor in the denomination they call it co-pastor the word co-pastor would me Co or equal to the pastor I don't believe that you understand that I don't believe in a co-equal there is no co-equals I am the pastor of this location and when I am out I am still the pastor there's no co-equal brother Bram called them Co Pastor because he was in the denomination but when he brought the message to the church he called it associate pastor so we will never call it co-equal we will never call it co-pastor but associate pastor are we all in agreement then blessed be the name of the Lord now through the years we've learned a lot of lessons and amongst all those lessons we've heard is that a lot of times the pastor is called on God's behalf maybe there's an accident maybe there's a sickness and then the church enters into chaos because there's no one who's been assigned and the people don't ask themselves oh what are we going to do now where are we going to now who's going to be the place the person to take the next [Music] place but and we'll call it a commotion arises and then religious politics come in we don't want religious politics because we have worked a long time for this place we put a lot of hours of work we've worked a lot that if one day the Lord should call us that everything be dismayed everyone go one place and then another place without knowing what to do that's how we must set things in order but as Caleb was speaking the father always searches or waits for the maturity of the son when he can be called into adoption under till then he is under tutors and understanding the vision of the father I could say these young men have reached the maturity I remember a lot brother K's father and I remember when Caleb turned 30 years old you know what he told him said Son now you can be a prince because you can be unless you be 30 years of age that tremendous am amen so when the Lord should call me to go to the missionary field the one who will stay in charge will be the associate pastor you understand me Breen I'm speaking to the Church of a pastor Tabernacle so that we'll know how we're going to run with this now I as Pastor have valuated the situation I have considered it and meditated on I placed it under prayer to make this decision now I understand that the decision which we are making not all will be in accordance maybe we might have different thoughts and that's fine we are all individuals but I want to say that after prayer and great consideration we are taking this decision to have an associate pastor to have a assistant pastor to assist the pastor and Associate now the word assist assistant that word is self-explanatory it's to assist the pastor in many activities and to assist the associate pastor now these two positions offices working together can do wonders I'm working together because I know both I actually know them since their birth those who know Judah you know he's very yeah he can't Restless he he throws himself he takes risks and those who know he's very calm see yes he's very still passive when I spoke on the qualifications of a pastor I spoke of a balance so can you imagine one who takes risks and one who's calm so that's Balan is it not amen amen and that's what we seek if one goes too far ahead the other one says hey hold on slow down calm down Cal down if the other one doesn't do anything says come on hurry up come on let's do it what are you waiting for it's a balance is that what it is that's what we're doing I know them very well since their birth many are going to be able to say brother what you're doing is favoritism and you're doing it just because they're your sons okay I understand that thought but just for a brief moment okay we're going to consider Judah and for a moment I will not consider them as my own Sons as though they were not my sons and we can go back for a moment to their infancy to their childhood they have grown up in the church in the pews that you're sitting a lot of times and they would sit and sleep in the pews they were raised up in the gospel they were raised up in the message of the hour they were raised up in obedience and they were raised up to have respect respect they were taught to respect the Brethren they were presented one by Brother Bernie Garcia and the other by Brother fa Bernal as youth they were clean youth part of the qualifications of a pastoring I can say they were never in drugs they were never in alcohol they never went to a dance they were never with women I am a witness of that they had a clean youth you never saw them have girlfriends they each had only one girlfriend and that's the one they married and they never went out [Applause] anywhere and I'm speaking not as though they are my sons I am not seeing them from that point of view now you not have heard them preach have you heard them preach amen few Ministers of the Gospel can attain the level they're at in preaching in Revelation and administering of the word of God okay now they see that Footprints is possession have you seen Judah lately that he's in everything seen him or not he runs here he runs over there he needs this to be done this that he's in everything and I don't say it because he's my son but that the Church of Pastor Tabernacle can realize that he's about his father's business or no yes or no he's about his father's business so then the question I ask does he fulfill the qualifications yes brother I can affirm yes I can affirm of oth as well but assistant and assisting other people amen amen so we take this time beautiful preaching of brother Kum to position these two Brethren and we should do it as it must do through a vote okay that those who can vote are the members of a pasor tabernacle amen our Brethren who are guests I will ask you not lift up your hand only Brethren of Pastor Tabernacle so who the question is who can vote okay I'm gonna ask you who I'm going to tell you who can vote that's members of the Tabernacle through the message of the hour the member of a tabernacle is that they assist regularly the services and they support the work of that church and they do it through offerings and tithing that is the meaning of a member assist the services regularly they give offering and they give tith according to the message that's the definition of a member so you can check yourself now and see if you have the right to vote but let's consider the youth they they do come regularly to church are active in the church maybe they could give an offering of what they have but maybe they can't give tithing because they're not even working yet so we won't be legalists no no how can a young man or woman give tithing on something he doesn't have so if these youth says well then I don't qualify to vote no if you're young and you're assisting regularly you offer them when you can what you can you can vote so to the youth I'm giving the opportunity so as all understood now we've heard it biblically today that which we heard heard biblically we should not do it literally so go back to the same again associate pastor Jud members of a pasor tabernacle you're going to lift up your hand before Witnesses those who are in agreement lift up your hand very well I want to give an opportunity to those who are not in agreement anyone who's not in agreement lift up your hand AC the majority have accepted amen [Applause] Now assistant pastor matth mat those who are in agreement lift up your hand whoever is not in agreement up your hand all right assistant [Applause] pastor now many years ago Bernie I was coming to brother Bernie I spoke with his grandfather brother ber Garcia and with me went two witnesses Fabio Bernal brother Fabio Bernal Tomas Perez and Tomas Perez

Tommy J all of them came an election was done as we did right now went for to the front I said if the man be called so is his wife so my wife sister went forth and all the ministry that was there laid hands which is the [Music] anointing and they ordained me as Pastor that's the apostolic way of doing things today want to do the same thing to lay hands upon them and pray for them so I'm going to
