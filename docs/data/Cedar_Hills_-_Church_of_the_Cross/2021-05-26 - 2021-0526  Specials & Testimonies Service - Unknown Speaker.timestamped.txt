[45:22] okay
[45:26] and i knew that we had to get her to the
[45:28] vet as soon as possible

[46:20] said nana i got her up i got her up
[46:26] and my nana was like what did you do
[46:30] and i just said i called the great

[47:50] this last time she escaped our neighbors
[47:53] had
[47:54] we it was on my birthday i believe
[48:04] we were at the pastor's cabin

[48:31] the lord
[48:32] for that miracle
[48:46] gracious
[48:48] amen we have a couple more specials
[48:51] tonight
[48:51] we have a brother julian hill especially
[48:55] julian hill um sister elizabeth gallegos
[48:58] elizabeth gallegos and sister rebecca
[49:00] rodriguez
[49:02] rebecca rodriguez god bless you
[49:11] hello everyone god bless you um so sadly
[49:14] i wanted to do this in person
[49:16] but i got i got a some information about
[49:18] a family emergency
[49:19] that i had to hightail it to so
[49:21] unfortunately i can't be there tonight
[49:24] but i can still give you this in digital
[49:26] form thanks to the evolution of
[49:28] technology
[49:29] so that's what i'm doing i'm here to uh
[49:31] to give you this poem
[49:33] that i wrote about a year ago for you
[49:35] all to enjoy and so
[49:36] yeah not a song or anything like that
[49:38] but a poem and so um
[49:40] before i do i kind of wanted to talk a
[49:41] little bit just for a moment about
[49:43] what it means to me and and how these
[49:45] poems were inspired and
[49:46] how god worked through them and and how
[49:48] i hope they can bless you as well
[49:50] um because that seems to be very
[49:52] interesting how god works and i hope we
[49:53] can all agree
[49:56] but uh yeah so about a year ago i
[49:58] started to go through some
[50:00] some pretty intense uh things i started
[50:02] to really
[50:03] um deal with myself as a person
[50:06] and as a character and uh and what um
[50:10] what i am and what my relationship with
[50:11] god was and i really started to
[50:13] to really go through it and uh really
[50:16] start addressing some of the things that
[50:18] i was that i was just ignoring and
[50:20] putting off for such a long time
[50:22] and um unfortunately uh
[50:25] i don't process that well
[50:28] i don't process things healthily all the
[50:30] time but that's okay because
[50:33] just as soon as i started to process it
[50:34] unhealthily like i had every time before
[50:37] god finally showed up and said i got
[50:38] something better let's make poetry
[50:41] and so um i was sitting in church one
[50:43] day and uh
[50:44] and i got the inspiration and i was like
[50:46] poetry i don't i don't do poetry that's
[50:49] that's lame and he was like
[50:52] nope we're doing poetry and so uh i was
[50:54] given the inspiration for 140 poems
[50:57] broken up into
[50:58] um seven uh no yes seven books of 20
[51:02] poems
[51:02] and you're not going to get all 140
[51:04] tonight but i am going to publish all of
[51:06] them in a book
[51:07] very soon but i won't say when but
[51:10] you're going to get one of them and it's
[51:12] titled ix which is
[51:14] uh nine in roman numerals and that's it
[51:16] that's all the title it is it was the
[51:17] ninth it was the ninth poem i ever wrote
[51:19] about a year ago and so these poems are
[51:22] really special to me because uh
[51:23] they allowed me to process a lot of what
[51:26] i was going through
[51:27] and uh they allowed me to get some
[51:29] one-on-one time
[51:31] with god uh in ways that i had never
[51:33] done before and i was never able to
[51:35] it was just a really intimate and
[51:38] personal experience that really helped
[51:40] me process what i was going through
[51:42] a lot and i'm sure that they'll help
[51:43] other folks process that as well that's
[51:45] the whole point of these is just doing
[51:46] the works for
[51:47] for the other for everybody else but uh
[51:49] it was survival for me so i i
[51:51] i pray that it's survival for you too if
[51:54] uh if that's what it
[51:55] if that's what it does for you but
[51:56] either way these gifts are for you all
[51:58] so
[51:59] without further ado i'd like to read ix
[52:02] which was the ninth poem
[52:03] that i wrote about a year ago
[52:08] the thoughts of the devil while against
[52:10] me but i will not crumble
[52:12] for my lord god stands he is almighty he
[52:15] makes the devil tremble
[52:17] though my battle rages on each day i
[52:20] fear no loss
[52:21] and in the midst of evil i'll say the
[52:23] blood of jesus is on the cross
[52:26] come all evil come all hell you are
[52:28] known to come anyway
[52:30] but i have word from god to tell he is
[52:32] alive each and every day
[52:34] the battle is long but i don't mind
[52:36] though you pick the brain with delight
[52:38] victory simple get thee behind a
[52:41] wrongdoing devil
[52:42] you've lost in every right how is it
[52:45] to be destined to fail is that why you
[52:47] are so driven
[52:49] know that though you nash and wail the
[52:51] truth remains
[52:52] he is risen it is not easy to win this
[52:55] war
[52:56] each battle a soul to claim but my god
[52:58] knows who he's fighting for
[53:00] and i fight for him the same you may
[53:03] come with all you've got
[53:04] the damage you will do but know this
[53:06] battle is not for naught
[53:08] for the lord will always ring true
[53:11] god bless you all
[53:22] [Music]
[53:31] without him i could do nothing
[53:37] without him i surely
[53:50] like a ship without
[53:53] a sail
[53:59] jesus oh
[54:02] jesus do you know
[54:04] when today do not turn him
[54:13] [Music]

[54:27] [Music]
[54:30] without him i would be dying
[54:35] [Music]
[54:50] but with jesus thank god i'm
[54:54] safe
[54:55] [Music]
[54:59] jesus oh
