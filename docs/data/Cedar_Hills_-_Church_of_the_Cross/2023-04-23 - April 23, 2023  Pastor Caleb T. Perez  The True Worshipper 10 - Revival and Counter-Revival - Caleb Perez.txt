amen and we want to we want to uh just say there I I won't uh we won't have any service this this afternoon can I can I just take my time this morning all right I might go a little bit long and and if you like I said if you need to go be Reverend and you can you can leave but oh see it's not going to go that long after a while but uh anyways we want to get as far as the Holy Spirit tells us to and we we started a little or continued but but we we were hitting on the oil and the wine I'm going to remember last Sunday and I didn't get very far into it and I just kind of the message we we stopped when the Lord told us to stop but I wanna I wanna continue that subject this is the true worshiper number 10. we would like to put a subtitle to it Revival and counter Revival I don't know if you've ever heard of that phrase before I was kind of shocked when I was reading brother Branham and it came across that word I gotta be honest with you I had no idea what a counter Revival was let's see what we can do as we get into her see what the Lord will show to us if you would stand to your feet and we want to read we want to read the scripture that we've been reading for this subject John 4 23 and 24. but you see your beautiful faces and uh I know there's some people that are on the road God bless them wherever they are amen when you have it you can say man we should already know this by heart already huh amen and it is uh John 4 23 and 24 reads like this but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth is I want you to notice this now you just have the spirit you're out of balance you just have the truth you're out of balance but the father wants you to have a balance here you gotta have spirit and Truth Revelation 6 5-6 when he had opened the third sill I heard the third be say come and see and I be held and lower Black Horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand is now now notice this next verse because as we heard who who said hurt not the oil nor the wine they said that who the lamb said that right but if you notice the lamb also said what what was uh before that the lamb is speaking because he says I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts he says a measure of wheat for a penny now the lamb is speaking a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of bar leaf for a penny and see thou heard not the oil and the wine did I read that right is that the same voice that's saying the the first thing is the second thing is everybody in agreement here with me no yeah yeah okay you want to make sure that we that we get this right they got out of his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated an interesting thing as we have read a voice in the midst of the throne or of the between the the beasts saying hurt not the oil nor the wine yes also saying a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny yeah for there to be perfect worship there has to be perfect balance yes or yes COC one more time for there to be perfect worship there has to be perfect balance my brethren see you all right a while ago you're here so let's continue here then now this is this is important once again there has to be a perfect balance and that's what the lamb is saying or telling us that the way that this writer is measuring it's not a true and just balance in other words he's a shyster and the lamb is telling you this you gotta know when there is a true balance and when there's not a true balance he's trying to to achieve that in our lives because finding a balance in our lives is probably one of the hardest things that we're asked to do okay especially when it comes to worship you want to see why it is so important that these the lamb is talking about these balances let's find out why the lamb decided he had to say this himself don't let no one else tell it nope nope not the living creatures but lamb had to say it himself let's find out about this balance just for a moment as weak as we as we make this Foundation Proverbs chapter 11 verse 1. watch why the lamb this is so important to him a false balance is abomination to the Lord this is why we what we have to understand here false balance just wait let me see got to go work and go gotta go to school how to do homework gotta play some sports yeah underwater basket weaving got some a lot of things I'm going got going on but I can balance everything always remember whatever we give time to hello you can't give time to something or someone unless you are taking time away from someone or something yes or yes COC the more time that we spend on our phones and our tablets the last time that we spend with the family is everybody has a different mindset about things as men many times we think just because we're sitting in the same room as the family that we're spending time families is that not true all right anybody ever any men to ever say that what more do you want from me yeah you're here in the body but not in the your mind's not there sharing your Instagram Pakistan so then we start to dig into things where are you at and what are you thinking and what are you doing it could be the same way with the woman not just the man Italian hello yes yes it is yes but notice to God it's it's an Abomination when the when the balance isn't right we're giving so much time and energy to a lot of things Amos the eighth chapter and the fourth verse and watch it and I just want like I said just build this this platform here 8-4 says hear this oh ye that swallow up the needy Amelia [Music] that's the measurement of weight making the IFA small yes in other words giving a little less seems like that's the way when you go out to eat nowadays most of the time little bitty portions and the prices are way up high now hey that's like two two bites watch what they're doing that's what he says you make the IFA small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by deceit wow also find the balances by deceit if I said that we may buy the poor for silver but the needy for a pair of shoes yay and Sal the refuse of the wheat even there's nothing worse than than knowing that that the balances have been falsified we look today in a world and especially a nation that is that is so out of balance anybody here see that have to live under a rock a nation that is out of balance the economy out of balance we live in a world of deficits the world of deficits that means that more goes out than what comes in and we we live then in a world and have our lives they are unbalanced Our Lives are out of balance when we come to church just whenever we feel like it our lives are out of balance when we don't hear the messages like we should our lives are out of balance we don't read the word of God like we should our lives are out of balance what we have eaten has thrown our hormones out of balance because of that we got so much more mood swings and grouchy people what's wrong with you nothing what's going on how to balance when we're not at peace what's going on we're out of balance when there is no joy in our soul what are we we're out of balance that's right when there is no love and long-suffering more gentleness we're a people that are out of balance our minds are out of balance what causes a mind to be out of balance brother Branham says nervousness causes your mind to be out of balance Justice is out of balance we see that everywhere how many of you would like to be judged by an by a balance that is that is has been falsified governments are out of balance churches are out of balance families are out of balance we look at that and we think that we have to live like that but I'm going to tell you again what the scripture just said false balance National hello everybody hola todos what I think it is but there has to be a people there has to be a True Believer a true worshiper that can maintain the balance of God's word you and I cannot survive without balance we can't survive without balance it is so important just an important that we understand balance in our lives that we keep a balance Ezekiel 45 verse 10 says this is ye shall have just balances and adjust IFA and a just bath if you keep on reading this whole chapter and I'm and I don't have time to do all that you'll find out in this chapter how to calibrate your balance right we sometimes that's what we need we need to calibrate the balance here is here is a maybe the Center Post he says starts to go one way or the other well you gotta slide it over they have to calibrate it where it is it becomes stable and even now once we know that like I said read that chapter and you'll understand it a little bit more but we don't ever want to be judged by a falsified balance but we know that God's judgments are true God's judgments are true and so it was shown yes and I'm just going to give you the the scripture you can write it down and and read it later but in the Book of Daniel the fifth chapter 25-27. there was a king by the name of belshazzar who was put in God's balance right and but you have read that before many many that's right now now everybody remember the story and the the the the the interpretation of this is that God has numbered thy kingdom and finished it Thou Art weighed in the balances I think today is a good day come on the balances find out what we are lacking if our if our life is in Balance this means that we're lacking something but I don't want to continue just to live like that I want to know what I'm lacking terrible conditions to think that you're balanced and then you're found lacking think that your life is going great but you're found lacking what a horrible condition when we do not measure up to God's word that's why job in in the 31st chapter you know he says verse 6 he says let me be weighed this and the vessel says in an even balance that God may know mine Integrity now when we take the word balance and we bring it into the message we take it into the Scriptures it simply means that we know how to rightly divided yes see okay come on we got to know these things to balance something means that you know how to rightly divide it it don't matter what it is whether it's your money yes whatever it may be you must learn how to rightly divided now there is a story are you in a Historia maybe you've you all have heard it is now Pancho Villa didn't rightly divide everything at all we have to make sure he didn't do everything right okay now here's a story about one of the times he did do something else and it was said that one of his generals was trying to take advantage of a married woman entered her house she began to scream and her husband who was working out in the field he heard her screaming he came in running to protect his wife the general that was in the house shot and killed the husband but this is when Pancho Villa heard this he called for the woman to come and General now that doesn't sound very just yet huh says you're going to marry him and of course he told the general I have a gift for you and when you when you bring me your marriage license made sure that that he went they went down to the courthouse wherever they got married the woman screaming and yelling didn't want to get married she was forced to marry the general foreign lomaton and now he told the woman since you're legally is all his possessions are now yours you think about that is there pins in there Aaron every now and then we can we can get it right there is but it's so hard for us to to make proper judgments and and balance things the reason being is that is is that we're too caught into our emotions and the moment we we try to serve the Lord under feelings and emotions balance is off already hello are you with me when we try to to serve the Lord right to judge something but but we said well yeah but I don't really like them your balance is awesome it's not based upon whether you like somebody or you don't understand have to make sure you calibrate your balance if you don't then your balance is an Abomination I'm there with me second Timothy the second chapter and the 15th verse says study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth friends brother Branham says this day I've always tried to keep a balance of the road you get away off into formalism just as formal and ritualistic as they can be yeah because people grab for that a lot he says but then if you don't watch it plumber Plum oversized and you'll be just as a fanatic as can be he said but there's a middle of the road where the true sound same gospel evangelios God moves in there is the gates very few there be that will find it now now let's stop for a minute because in all reality this is why people cannot balance things out Jesus said you by your Traditions you make the word of God of no effect now now you have two schools of thoughts watch watch this is just as an example two schools of thought when people come to the message you have this school of thought here yeah it says when you come to the message give your heart to the Lord this is what you got to do you've got to stop drinking you gotta stop smoking you gotta stop wearing clothes you have to stop doing all these things so here is one thought or or one group of people then you have this side that'll tell you you don't have to do nothing let the Lord take it off away from you two schools of thoughts this morning which one do you choose that you got to do all these things or kick back and not worry about nothing anyways God will take care take it away from him Where Do We Go From Here both are the word that has not been rightly divided because there's something that that when you look at this picture it's wrong these ones are trying to do everything to to make it home care less yes because there's something that we gotta do okay leave it all on God here you come to the altars those of you and and we would have to go back to the old to the Old Testament to to show this is the Old Testament in the this is where many people don't get it now now here we come is my buddy okay now dear brother Yandel he decides to give his heart to the Lord ready say hi to him welcome him yeah you feel welcomed oh he comes to the Altar and he says I've accepted the Lord Jesus and that's all he he says that's it and he says he's ready to go huh you see the problem is El problema is that people don't realize that when you come to the altar it's not good enough to come up to the altar you have to make the choice that's why you can't just leave it on God you've got no choice to get on the altar oh no no lay down it's your choice you can lay down and lay on the altars because this guy he's accepted the Lord but there is a burning process that has to happen burn the sin away he's got to climb up on the altar foreign now there's a process because now you got to go to the next step but I'm trying to show you something here it's easy it is not to rightly divide the words if you don't rightly divide the words and you'll just go with anything I just felt so good in church felt good when you watch that movie but I cried in church you're in English and you cried on that movie Yes you cried when somebody said something bad towards you what does that mean you cried and I laughed good nothing wrong with that have you died you've got to come to the place that you present Domingo is at least they're honest now yeah yeah all right Manos but you know what Eros 7K when we decide I don't think I'm gonna go I got a backache today my leg hurts oh this is going on I don't feel like going the same way that you present your body a Living Sacrifice to God you are also presenting your body a Living Sacrifice to Saiyan no you have just laid on the altars I am oh you're either presenting yourself to one or the other president hello hola when you open up and you start watching pornography what are you doing you're telling sayings I present myself to you hello well if you're looking at another man or another woman what do you do watch what he says here but there is a middle of the road where the true sound same gospel is preached indicates his word so if that's the case then let's see where we need to be today when he comes there's something that God can't do it he gave you a free will to choose it's important to rightly divide the word it's important the word is tightly divided stimulation of the Revelation comes you can rightly divide the words we try to find balances in our lives but we end up compromising instead of rightly dividing it as a minister yet we neglect the very families that God's given us are we rightly dividing la palabra oh this one even brother Caleb has to go undo this a little bit oh yeah we become Workaholics of ourselves and still yet others are just Pleasure Seekers and have no responsibility to anyone else where's the balance in our life our worship is out of balance oh my goodness I'm going to say it again our worship is out of balance why the Lord doesn't move like this and when he moves a little bit we're satisfied with that I am not satisfied with just a little move I want all that God has given us all that he's promised foreign brother Branham says that Faith creates the promise let's go on here now to bring up this faith in Christ there's ministers this is Brother Branham in the message I perceive you are a prophet to bring up this faith in Christ there's ministry that's the most important thing of the day is the most important come on you want to balance let's get a balance here that's the most important thing of the day is a good god-sent preacher um brother Brown says I admire them and their gift is far beyond anything that could be done in anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word he knows how to bring balance that's why the bride is the only people on earth that is balance the bride La Novia he's the only people that is balance you know why all right making sure that's what we're talking about balance doesn't exist just for balance sake it does not exist to Crown itself King no existence and control our lives with an intimidating set of rules no no balance does not exist to make us feel guilty in Balance traded or defeated balance exists to serve us now Church did you get that balance is here to serve us oh I pray that we get this this morning then why do people have a problem with balance because they have a problem with the Center El Centro if the center's not right the balance is not right and we're always changing our centers all right amen this is the center of your life my boyfriend is my Center oh no looking at these young people oh my girlfriend she's the center until we get dumped did I say that loud I wasn't supposed to say that out loud until things don't work out my life is ruined what happened you had the wrong center Christ should be the center your home of your life of your thinking of everything that you are if the center is unstable the balance is awesome answer must be Christ be the word because even in the face of lost jobs lost jobs lost marriages lost retirement God never changes he's still stable he's still the same time he is our Center it don't matter if the whole world falls apart we have what sustains us foreign let's see what is required for worship the wine and the oil okay young people I know you feel safe huh I'm looking at you all right okay wine and oil are connected in what is somebody want to help him out Boaz we heard this last Sunday right the oil and the wine are connected somebody what okay somebody else want to help him who said that you sure positive oh Easter I like that oil and wine are connected or associated in worship and the wheat and The Barley are the staff of life [Music] okay did you get that now oil and wine connected in worship weed and barley are the staff of life foreign and here they are charging for which causes an imbalance and so the people don't know uh I ain't gonna serve God all they want is money in that church yes people I've ever thought that or said that or amazing they're charging for the staff of life but to start off with God had already promised a land for his people you can read it read this at home but Deuteronomy 8 7-10 he promised us uh a land that had balance Ahmad am I losing you no promised us a good land for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land foreign shall not lack anything in it okay my mind well you're not going to live very long what do you mean I I I'm not living long come on I can no more die than God can die well what's the problem imbalance that's the problem sometimes we feel good I'm talking about anybody here a land with wine a land with a the land has all this you're not excited foreign yeah excited are you excited is your neighbor excited she we should be the most excited people what a land but because of sin and Disobedience let's see what happened to this Lando feels good to preach with no time limits we're going to see how much how many of you can handle it our pastor would say support pero when they're watching a movie [Music] Coke right here and then a big old hot dog it's already over shoved that was such a good one let's put another one that's the flesh it says that's an imbalance hear you old men hear this ye old man and give ear this is Joel 1 2. the inhabitants of the land have this been in your days or even the days of your fathers tell your children of it and let your children tell their children their children another generation watch what has happened to or what happened to the good land that which the Palmer worm hath left and that which the Locust has left and that which the canker worm has left the caterpillar awakey drunkards desperate and weep and Hell All Ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine accounts for it is cut off from your mouth watch verse 10 now the field is wasted come on how many of you know you are the oil languages [Music] how will all ye Vine dressers for the wheat and for the barley brothers because the Harvest of the field is perished in other words you're not producing anymore your land is dried up what a condition this is the condition of many of fields Campos the new wine now you need this for worship the new wine how are you going to worship there's no more stimulation of Revelation hmm oh are we going to be honest with ourselves this morning do we just want a a message to just make us feel good we're not here for that the new wine is dried up the oil language it's become feeble and weakness the wheat and The Barley which should have been the Harvest in other words there's an imbalance in the ecosystem Echo the ecological system right there's an imbalance things aren't flowing the way they're supposed let's go on to see what it is you know what is wrong thank you uh anybody here lost their Joy no the joy of thy salvation David said they've lost their Joy because if the word of God is not new every time you hear it there's no joy you lost it when the word of God becomes old amen oh my goodness God help us this morning that's why the oil and the oil and the correctly measured in the balance [Music] because instead of producing taking the ingredients what have they done with the barley and wheat they have made a drink of intoxication the very same ingredients that that's used to make bread is now used to make whiskey now whiskey oh don't you understand and see now the great all the inhabitants of the world have been made drunk what should have been a preaching what should have been preached what should have been Jesus Christ being produced into the they've turned it into an intoxicated drink oh they're in trouble what we need is a Revival what we need is a counter Revival say it again we need a Revival this is now we're getting into our message that's all that is for this now how many want a Revival how many have a Revival already the Revival should be inside of you want everybody point to themselves the Revival should be in here already a Revival is not how much you jump and shouts that Revival is to revive what's already inside now let me let me just put this out for you okay he says it doesn't consist of bringing in new members now if we just say it like that we're not rightly dividing the words our Revival is not for new members let's rightly divide it a Revival doesn't consist of a bunch of conversions although those things go along with the Revival is there a revival going on here what good is it if it's for Africa but not for you oh come on what are we trying to give if we don't already have it yeah yeah conversions it goes along with the Revival conversion is what a Revival is to revive what you've already got Uno America brother Branham says America this is needs a Revival and a counter Revival he said but they're not gonna get it why because they send away their day of Grace I don't care how much they pray for this nation 1956. in the way their day of Grace it must not be saved we cannot be saved as a nation there still is a people who live here in the United States and our Revival is going on inside it is active it's an existence we have become the laughing stock of the whole world how many how many how many saw that of our vice president going to Africa Africa real nice yeah you gotta you gotta start you're taking into consideration these people and it is they laughed in her face yes or yes nobody else saw it yeah these presidents of the of these different African countries they laughed in her face because they see the immorality the decay of the morals in our country this is the Mexican president he said the United States they're not concerned about well-being they own their only concern about the money they're telling us what the imbalance is they do not strengthen moral because spiritual values nor do they limit drug use contrary they encourage it said the U.S moral compass has gone awry they are suffering from moral Decay is yeah this is the country we live we understand we don't need a new Pentecostal denomination a message no sir God forbids we don't need a new denomination we need to revive what we have denominated the thing that we've denominated that's exactly what we need it's a sacramental looking it's a good old-fashioned Revival knows that's true and then he says Revival is sometimes misunderstood because they think it's just to bring in new members again no no Revival result is that Revival results is the new members the Revival is to revive what's already in the church so the great things that we're after for any Revival says there's four things number one Numero Uno in a Revival is to bring lost souls to Christo this is the message speak to this mountain lost souls to Christ first then revive number two revive the church back into a spiritual conditions what should be close communion with God number three is to bring Fellowship among the churches and then he says at number four pray for the second and that's not just physical that is spiritual that's our aim he says oh he said I thought it's having a Revival what does it do it shakes all the trash out this is Iglesia no nobody likes to hear these messages um okay I've been going a long time yeah and I just should I just call it quits now you sure all right make sure that you're in watch what he says here a minister cannot bring a Revival um there's no preacher that can bring a Revival I'm gonna invite these preachers over here man they're gonna man they'll just bring us a Revival teacher can bring a Revival doesn't pack it with him for all those that oh yes I go many places do many things sometimes we gotta slap ourselves a preacher doesn't have that he doesn't pack it the only thing a preacher can do is be loyal to God oh yeah now we're getting somewhere be loyal to his words and the Revival has to come by the people because it's either the people are going to believe it or they're not sure you want a Revival but you gotta believe it here's Jesus that that that that stimulation begins to flow out Jesus which of you can accuse me of sin who can accuse me of unbelief everything that the prophets have spoken I have fulfilled it which of you can excuse me and brother Branham turns it now you know that's what the Pentecostal church should be saying for everything that the New Testament was written we are fulfilling what it has been written oh who then can accuse us if you're not producing it don't be accused of not believing it is especially when the balances have been made perfect now watch this now efficacy it needs watch we all get we must come to a place where we are clean the word revive means to bring back right listen that was alive at one time but now it's bring it's brought back is put those two words why Reviving restores most exactly the same is makosa restoration means to bring back restoration is to bring back to the former owner to bring back to a former state of condition or conditions and revive means to bring back or restore to life to restore energized once again and here's where we're going with the message says we need a Revival this is I don't know what that even means I don't know what that means but thank God for a problem there's no other place he said I'd rather live he said because this is my home I'm glad I'm an American thankful for it but I tell you it certainly needs a counter Revival it sure does and it will not get it no she'll never rise again she's gone counter Contra means in the opposite direction it's something that opposes or prevents something what opposes or or prevents a Revival a counter Revival why would we need a counter revised when we all want a Revival what's the purpose of a counter Revival I mean we go perfect strength by Perfect weakness then God can achieve his purpose by sending not a Revival but brother better counter Revival remember Revival is to revive he says but God's purpose is to achieve his purpose foreign be with him amen and I gotta say the same thing Tabernacle needs a killing necess a killing of ourselves so that we can be revived in a new life A New Hope you experience we need first a day of mourning there's a time to cry at a time to laugh but we need a day of mourning we've Gotta Die out completely we need a place of yielding to the spirit instead of so much depending on schooling and upon programs so that we can get away from that get away from the human ability we gotta go to a place where we can surrender our souls and lives even to the housewife the farmer the mechanic whoever we are we gotta surrender completely to God know that we are nothing then let God start from there oh then he's moving you've got to die before you're born again there were many people we have failed I are you getting it this morning come on put yourself in the balance of God's word which side are you is it the true worship is right the true worshiper must be restored the fields Los Campos the trees the wheat The Barley all must be restored there is a people that has been revived I don't know about you but that excites watch what a revival can do please it needs a Revival a counter Revival what is the purpose of the counter Revival is to straighten up some of the things that's in the church and in the lives of the people anybody here want to counter Revival this morning I'm inviting you for a counter Revival things that got to be straightened out things in people's lives what a thing it is then when God raises it brings a Revival in the Philadelphia Church age how many know have ever studied the French Revolution the things that were going on in France brother Brown says free thinkers this is a revolution broke out brother said what they needed was a counter Revolution Contra revolution this revolution in France it was during the time of the great Wesleyan Revival Wesley now this is tremendous you have France over here it was called the reign of terror right you can go study it's called the reign of terror it was against the government against the church it was against the monarchy everybody was getting getting a little piece of it but notice brother Brown says this revolution is the revolution would have surely taken all of England what a Revival that broke out in England that Revival in English started with a prayer meeting if you think that that prayer doesn't work this is what John Wesley's Journal said in a journal they were Wesley brother and presents he called it a love Beast and about three in the morning [Music] I don't know about you you know but here pretty soon I'm gonna invite whoever wants to come pray all night if you don't want to pray all night stay at home okay let me see who will come oh I got a baby can't go sorry would you take care of my baby imbalance yeah I'm looking at all of you what we got going on here he said that it fell with such amazement the power of God that we all broke out with one voice we praise thee Oh God we acknowledge thee to be the Lord now he hears what's tremendous to me because when all these free thinkers see that's so evident now all these free thinkers where they get these things [Music] first they start with tolerance you got to tolerate them even if you don't agree with them tolerance it goes to acceptance and after acceptance it comes they come to Promotions promoting it now all right and that would have hit England at that time but there was a revival going on that kept that revolution in France God would not let it come into England brother Branham says it was the Evangelical Awakening in England that from that prayer meeting It produced the greatest preachers and teachers that this world has ever seen that's what we need today keep on with the Holy ghosts stand up and say that's not right this is black and black and white as white where are those people if a Revival back there did that it's more a Revival a fruitful word has been restored into the churches foreign [Applause] because when I hear something wrong and I walk away and don't say nothing there ain't nothing there ain't a Revival why not you can't help but call out sin nope oh where am I at now I still got a few minutes so glad today is a good day oh yes now I have to understand this though that every Revival produces twins I'm in Revival praise God look out for that twin that's what the counter Revival is all about is to counter is it the effects oh are you are you getting it now say it again that's what the counter Revival does it puts the other twin at Bay this is the other twin doesn't have the effect on you that it wants you okay by some people oh I'm in a Revival they don't even know if they love the Lord there was no counter Revival every Revival produces twins when the world was created it was a Revival you know that anytime God creates it's a Revival what did that Revival in the beginning produce they produce two trees the tree of life and the tree of knowledge another Revival produced Cain and Abel another Revival produced Ishmael and Isaac is Jesus and Judas Christ and the Antichrist Christo the Luther church was born the Lutheran Church Martin Luther brought forth a spiritual Revival Martin but then the organization came and organized it organization John Wesley brought a spiritual Revival then the organization came again and organized It pentagos produced a Revival they also organized but brother Branham says this oh I like this he said but this revival usually a Revival lasts for three years he said but this revival lasted over 15 years and it cannot be organized it can be organized 15 years it can't be organized instead let's let's try to go and finish up here yes the Holy Spirit and the antichristo is to be twins in the same church they're walking together oh yeah in the same tree yeah right now right now they're both working the Holy Spirit saying listen oh yeah put yourselves on the scales of God's words you're okay as well you're going to heaven both working with you right now what are you doing about it oh my goodness those are good things to think about where are we vamos this is what he says the prophet of God is it Billy Graham yeah Billy is a word preacher Billy is a grandma is a Dandy one you know bien and they rallied around so that put all the cold Formals in a rally frios foreign this is a whole different game now and now and the supernatural being yes with Divine Healing and powers and working and so forth yeah see by The Miracles of God put this the church the raptured bride La Novia that's not God the oil in her lamps and put her in a Revival not Billy Graham's message even though he preached from the word so this is not just preaching from the word a man that could rightly divide it watch watch this now that when we come to an understanding of this to this promised restoration I stopped yea the Lord will answer and say unto his people only two places in the scriptures this wording used behold I will send you there is only two places he says behold I will send Caleb corn I will send Caleb the wines he will be satisfied there with and I will no more make him a reproach among the heathens the only other place that he says behold I will send you four five with a message to rest restored to restore what to restore the oil I will restore saith the Lord this is a prophecy from our founding pastors watch listen closely now this is prophecy now oh yeah you didn't know who was in your Midstate he said for many years he said I have brought something to this place now it's time for the other ones to water it these ministers okay where's our ministry talking these ministers are not going to water on their own they're only going to water which I already placed there what is placed here he says watch this now I cannot do no more I've given everything I've got tengo there has to be a harvest there has to be a reaping there has to be a gathering but we cannot do it on just a plantation it's got to be watered that's why you see me you're not going to see me in this church going forth anymore going to start going back I'm going to start diminishing regular but my ministers are going to start increasing in here and they're going to water yeah they're going to reap that which they did not plan okay there's no plantaron I heard in the midst of the four beasts a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley foreign okay we're coming down just give me like 10 minutes okay and I'll be through he says we wouldn't need a healing service not need any salvation altar calls it would be finished if you just realized what the word was When I See This I say wow wow can we get there can we get to Perfection come on Church who wants to go to perfection we say no many said when the when the prophet passed away no the perfect interpretation has come and there is a people who believe it then who can accuse us of sins who can accuse us of sinus yes there's a people that is manifesting what was spoken by the prophets listen to this he can say tell you you talk about a perfect worship the oil and the wine continues foreign this is what he said for these men will carry these the innkeepers that will take these sick people and they'll keep pouring in the oil and the wines help we ministers Lord that we might be able to serve your people with a pure conscience act like that doesn't existed or can somebody take the responsibility other pastors they said they're pastors to feed you and to Shepherds until Jesus comes not just for a short short time this is the message be certain of God these men are good men he says join their churches they'll do you good I can only be an Evangelista he says but they're pastors to feed you until Jesus comes they are the caretakers at the end that Jesus gives them two pence the word and the spirit Espiritu that the true worshiper would Worship in spirit and in truth they need anything else anybody here that's sick sister there you are who else is sick again there's a few that are sick watch how we rightly divide this word and then I'm going to finish here Paul says to the Hebrews therefore living the principles of the doctrines of Christ let's go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God Hebrews 6 1. of the doctrine of baptisms and laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment this we will do if God permits Paul knows that these things are absolutely Essentials but show me in the scriptures one Gentile that Jesus prayed foreign you won't find it we'll do these things if God permits the balance because there's many people who are not there you don't have the faith they need a touch this God permits but if we're talking about a mature Church a church that wants to go to Perfection then let's see what this kind of what kind of church this is to be and this is now my purpose has been this is the message go away my purpose has been in the church is to try to get that idea away from these American people that you have to lay hands on them and this will do if God permits yes when you do that they say well brother so and so laid their hands on me so the Brown says Just Let Jesus lay hands on you and your faith reach up and touch him but our faith is too weakness we can't reach out and touch him watch watch what he says here this is November of 1963. now I've had about 16 years and I've totally failed with it she you know why because there there are too many that wants to believe it another way and so we do it because we satisfy the people okay we will do this if God permits we satisfy the people and we lay hands my opinions that if we can see the presence and know that Jesus Christ is here what more do you need when the whole congregation is praying at one time that's when the power of the Lord Falls when the word is known Faith cometh by hearing this is hearing of the word and when the word is being preached that should do the work right there come on now he said let's go to Perfection how many want to go to Perfection okay then I'm gonna ask again who's sick today I challenge you to stand to your feet because the same one that gave me this message is the same one that's here we don't have to guess we don't have to hope is as a group as a Believer is we gotta Pray when we pray the presence comes let your faith Reach Out And Touch him we're too used to put in hands they let your faith reach out maybe you need a Revival maybe you need a counter Revival today is our day I challenge you today today is our day if you've gotten cold and indifference today is your day let your faith touch him this morning you need something stand to yourself foreign by the Bible as we pray together and the presence of God now that is here already you're laying on the balance now if you're found lacking then receive what you what you are lacking if you need whatever it is and father in Jesus name oh Lord God there are people here Lord I hate you Lord Lord there are people that are watching online Lord that need a touch from you Lord our faith is is now reaching out to you Lord just by the power of spoken words Lord you hear their prayers Lords they're crying to you this day I pray Lord Jesus Lord that your presence now that is here we're going to answer the prayers of your people Lord let us go to a higher level just knowing that you spoke the word everything that's written in the scriptures everything that you spoke up through a prophet is ours that their faith begins to move Lord let it move Lord Jesus oh yes oh see do you believe in church don't you let go until you got something here make it worthwhile that you came to church today I just want to end with this now here's Gordon Lindsay from a man sent from God Paul writes we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things that we see are temporal things which are not seen are Eternal Paul shows us here that we are now living in Two Worlds at the same time the physical world or the world of sense and the world of spirit the world of spirit El Mundo de spirit to surrounds and Sierra and Spears an interpenetrates the world of sense Both Worlds occupy the same space at the same time so now I ask you every every Revival produces twins it produces the carnal produce and it produces the spiritual believer which one are you oh now as as just in the calmness now as the music plays your time with God lord I have spoken what you have told me to speak and now we are waiting on you we have spoken and everyone [Music] has stood to their feet now Lord

brother Jacob you got to hear this one isn't it in second chronicles the second chapter read it when you get home but in that chapter Solomon Salomon has now decided it's time to build the temples oh you talk about the scriptures dovetailing you talk about rightly dividing the words he goes to the king of Tyree I believe and he says he took some of those Cedars from Lebanon I need some now I'm about to build the temple this is how many of you believe that you are the Temple of the Holy ghosts he said I need a man that can work wood this is and gold and silver La Plata what will you give me

that would produce worship because the worship the worshiper be perfected before the temple I don't know if you get that or not say it again name four things get the material for the temple revelation the same thing he uses the same thing but one is a natural and the other is a spiritual the worshiper wants should have no more conscience or disease not that you are the Temple of the Holy ghosts I
