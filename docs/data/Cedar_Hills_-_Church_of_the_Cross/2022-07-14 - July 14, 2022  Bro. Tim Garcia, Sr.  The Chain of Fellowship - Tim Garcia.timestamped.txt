[34:17] most gracious heavenly father father is
[34:20] celestial as we approach your throne of
[34:23] grace and mercy this eve
[34:28] father i take myself completely out of
[34:30] the way
[34:32] father that it will be you that will
[34:34] speak to your people
[34:37] father may they be blessed this evening
[34:40] from your word
[34:43] oh lord may bring healing
[35:13] that the lord gave me quite some time
[35:15] ago
[35:18] the chain of fellowships
[35:21] with the thought of
[35:23] reconcile your brother
[35:26] reconciliation
[35:30] when they shared
[35:32] the video of
[35:33] the report
[35:34] when the group went to uganda
[35:42] one of the parts that really stood out
[35:43] to me
[35:47] when brother caleb was speaking of the
[35:49] bulls of bashan
[35:53] and he was having the brothers
[35:55] interlock their arms together
[36:11] along another line this was the thought
[36:13] that the lord had given me okay
[36:18] also when he was speaking in fort
[36:19] collins
[36:22] and
[36:23] he called up several of the youth and
[36:26] told them you are an end and you're in
[36:28] and you are an end
[36:35] and then a quote from his message was
[36:37] the ministry of the seven angel was to
[36:50] get all the loose ends and tie them all
[36:52] together
[36:55] and when the message has tied it all
[36:57] together
[37:00] it is no more a bunch of ends
[37:03] but it is
[37:06] one
[37:15] he is the chain of circumstances that
[37:16] binds them
[37:17] a circumstance
[37:19] not a bunch of signs not a bunch of ants
[37:21] no more
[37:24] not a bunch of events
[37:29] and then he read
[37:31] is this the sign of the answer
[37:34] that
[37:46] and he gathers them all up
[37:50] i would like to ask
[37:53] eight youth
[37:55] young men if they can
[37:56] stand up here in the front seat
[38:01] in french
[38:05] right here
[38:07] and i want you guys to do me a favor i
[38:08] want you to interlock your arms together
[38:14] but i want to do it a little differently
[38:22] but the other way
[38:25] one complete circle
[38:27] where your backs are to each other
[38:33] keep going around
[38:36] like this
[38:39] and then you
[38:41] right there
[38:42] amen
[38:43] perfect
[38:46] let me have one more
[38:48] one more brother
[38:49] come up
[38:51] and i'd like to ask you a question
[38:55] because you know this thing always stuck
[38:57] to me that the chain is as strong as the
[38:59] weakest link
[39:05] and a lot of times
[39:08] when
[39:10] one of
[39:11] the lengths of the chain is broken
[39:16] [Music]
[39:41] so for example
[39:45] go in the middle
[39:47] i want you guys
[39:48] to put your arms back together
[39:51] let's say for example for example
[39:54] the judo made a mistake and he has
[39:56] fallen okay
[40:01] and this is the only way is
[40:04] that you have your right a right to turn
[40:06] your back on yes
[40:21] when someone wants to come against your
[40:22] brother that has fallen
[40:24] controversial
[40:26] it doesn't matter
[40:28] what angle they are coming at him from
[40:32] you are there to protect us
[40:35] if i come from this way
[40:50] why not if our brother makes a mistake
[40:55] and in in his weakened weakest condition
[40:59] why don't we we protect them
[41:02] until once again he becomes strong
[41:28] okay join your hands together your arms
[41:30] together
[41:32] now what happens
[41:35] if we cast our brother out or off to the
[41:38] side
[41:41] now you're only seven strong
[41:44] okay i'd like one more to sit down
[42:00] one more to step down
[42:02] that's okay
[42:04] so now
[42:06] we're down to five or a cinco now we're
[42:08] down to four out of cuatro now i want
[42:10] everyone to step down except for one
[42:19] now
[42:20] is he
[42:22] a chain or is he just a link
[42:26] now if he wants to put his arms put your
[42:28] arms together
[42:31] now this is what happens
[42:34] he's trying to join the chain together
[42:36] you get it
[42:38] and now it's more with an attitude of i
[42:40] don't care
[42:43] and if he ties his hands or
[42:45] joins his hands behind him
[42:48] now he
[42:50] is
[42:51] chained to himself
[42:53] he is actually handcuffed
[43:20] i want to read a quote from the message
[43:22] the inside man
[43:24] uh
[43:28] and remember some brother may have
[43:30] fallen some brother may be fallen
[43:35] but don't make him any worse
[43:50] the brotherhood of god
[43:58] and
[43:59] a lot of times when we make mistakes
[44:04] it's easy for us to
[44:06] point a finger is facile
[44:10] or
[44:12] not want to talk to them because
[44:14] for whatever thing he did
[44:19] but who of us is without sin
[44:45] i get the definition of the word
[44:47] reconcile from webster's dictionary the
[44:49] definition
[44:51] reconciliated scenario webster's
[44:53] is to restore to friendship
[44:57] or harmony or harmonia
[45:01] read a quote from brother branham from
[45:02] that time
[45:09] i've got a slogan
[45:11] you think on the slogan do right it's
[45:13] your duty to god
[45:30] it'll grow around you just like some
[45:31] vine
[45:34] and it'll hug you into it
[45:39] if you can't love your enemy just as
[45:40] much as you love those who love you
[45:44] come on
[45:50] brother branham was talking about
[45:52] not to not read the whole quote about
[45:55] a brother that had a problem a lot of
[45:57] monobranam anesthetic
[46:01] about brother branham setting someone on
[46:02] the platform that they thought didn't
[46:05] wasn't baptized
[46:13] and brother brandon said this man said
[46:15] di say my random esteem
[46:17] we're drawing a little ring and we're
[46:19] drawing you out of the circle
[46:25] brother brandon responded to him and
[46:27] i said then i'm going to draw a little
[46:29] ring and draw you back in again
[46:35] that's it bring you right back
[46:38] and you can't put me out just
[46:55] if you turn into your scriptures on
[46:56] first corinthians 12
[47:00] 0.
[47:12] for as the body is one and half many
[47:13] members and all the members of that one
[47:15] body being many are one body so also is
[47:18] christ
[47:22] which is
[47:28] for by one spirit we are all baptized
[47:30] into one body whether we be jews or
[47:32] gentiles whether we be bonder free and
[47:35] have been made and have been all made to
[47:37] drink into one spirit
[47:47] but the body is not one member but many
[47:52] if the foot shall say because i am not
[47:54] the hand
[47:55] i am not of the body is it therefore not
[47:57] of the body
[48:03] and if the ear shall say because i am
[48:06] not
[48:07] the i i am not of the body is it
[48:09] therefore not of the body
[48:17] if the whole body were an eye where were
[48:19] the hearing if the hole were hearing
[48:21] where were they smelling
[48:28] but now has god set
[48:30] the members every one of them in the
[48:32] body as it had pleased him
[48:40] and if they were all one member where
[48:42] were the body
[48:47] but now are they many members yet
[48:49] but one body
[48:54] and i cannot say unto the hand i have no
[48:56] need of thee nor again the head to the
[48:58] feet i have no need of you
[49:05] much more of those members of the body
[49:08] which seem to be more feeble are
[49:09] necessary
[49:15] and those members of the body which we
[49:17] think to be less honorable upon those
[49:19] unpandes we bestow more abundant honor
[49:22] and our uncomely parts have more
[49:24] abundant comeliness
[49:27] [Music]
[49:35] have no need
[49:37] but god has tempered the body together
[49:39] having given more abundant honor to that
[49:41] part which lacked
[49:51] there should be some
[49:53] schism
[49:54] in the body
[50:09] there should be no schism in the body
[50:11] but that the members should have the
[50:13] same care one for another but
[50:21] and whether one members suffer all the
[50:23] members suffer with it
[50:53] discord
[50:55] disharmony this default harmonia
[50:59] you know a lot of times which is this is
[51:03] some of us might say
[51:06] decimus in the body of christ i want to
[51:09] be
[51:10] the right arm
[51:13] or i want to be the shoulders
[51:16] or i want to be this part
[51:21] but how many pero quantos have you
[51:24] dusted this i want to be the souls of
[51:26] the feet
[51:29] without
[51:30] the souls of the thief
[51:33] how is that body going to get around
[51:39] you know
[51:42] and that's how beautiful i was reading a
[51:44] quote brother branham christianity
[51:46] versus idolatry
[52:16] part
[52:17] every sickness
[52:23] even death itself
[52:26] is under your feet
[52:28] under you
[52:30] oh i can just imagine glory lauria i
[52:33] don't feel like i was 52 this morning
[52:38] if i can just get this church to see
[52:40] that brother
[52:42] iglesias
[52:44] we will
[52:56] gloria
[53:04] now god wrote it in his word that
[53:06] that should be sufficient and the
[53:08] message fellowship
[53:10] is
[53:26] but
[53:40] and different gifts into the church the
[53:41] difference is don is in like lesia
[53:44] what to
[53:45] to do what
[53:48] scatter the church
[53:51] no but to draw the church together for
[53:52] the perfecting of the body of jesus
[54:05] with all signs and wonders in it
[54:08] is
[54:44] see what
[54:45] maybe they're having a problem or maybe
[54:47] they have need of something
[54:51] a lot of times you don't know if
[54:53] the lord allows you to go through
[54:54] something in your life
[54:59] it could be for that one time
[55:02] if someone is passing through the same
[55:04] thing that
[55:18] the same thing happened to me
[55:20] i went through the same thing
[55:23] and if you can do that
[55:25] you can help that person
[55:28] you can reconcile that brother back into
[55:30] the fellowship reconciliation
[55:34] i remember one time in church recording
[55:37] iglesia
[55:38] this was after the lord took my dad
[55:40] to dispose
[55:42] to mommy padre the brother was giving a
[55:44] testimony dermano estaba testimonial
[55:51] and he admitted that he wasn't living
[55:53] right
[55:56] and
[55:57] as i was listening to him i went home
[55:59] and i started thinking of what he was
[56:02] saying
[56:07] and i remember
[56:09] i asked the lord
[56:14] lord
[56:15] in because to me i think but the lord's
[56:17] perfect in everything he does
[56:23] but you know in our finite mind we think
[56:25] that we know everything but
[56:56] how could you take my dad
[57:01] being who
[57:02] he is
[57:05] the work that he was doing
[57:08] the help that he was doing
[57:10] and
[57:12] you
[57:12] [Music]
[57:14] saved this brother's life this brother
[57:16] that should have died
[57:21] that wasn't even living right
[57:24] you see a lot of times
[57:25] we begin to judge people
[57:30] we see that if they do something
[57:34] and right away
[57:35] as the example that we gave earlier we
[57:37] want to cast them to the side
[57:38] immediately
[58:00] so then it is not of him that willeth
[58:04] nor of him that run
[58:06] but of god that's
[58:30] but knowing that my my father my dad was
[58:32] ready to go
[58:34] my father
[58:48] i
[59:17] and
[59:18] you know a lot of times i
[59:19] i looked at him and he was just my dad
[59:24] and
[59:25] after he left this positive way
[59:31] to me
[59:32] what i mean
[59:35] then i realized who he was
[59:39] i realized who he is
[59:41] you know a lot of times we take
[59:43] people for granted which is
[59:47] and
[59:48] we don't like i was talking to
[59:50] a brother in the back brother seth
[59:54] and he was talking to brother jimmy
[59:56] talking how he just wants to be a sponge
[59:57] just to soak everything up with this
[1:00:00] ministry here
[1:00:07] but you know everything
[1:00:09] all things work together for good
[1:00:17] and i know that
[1:00:18] i was talking to a minister friend of
[1:00:21] mine
[1:00:24] and i couldn't understand why
[1:00:26] i never took advantage
[1:00:29] of my father to
[1:00:32] soak up everything all his knowledge
[1:00:34] that he had of this message
[1:00:42] because i remember when we were here the
[1:00:43] one of the last times when my son spoke
[1:00:46] you know is that the lasso this is
[1:00:49] that he said he's been in this message
[1:00:51] for 30 something years
[1:00:54] but the message has only was only in him
[1:00:56] for a couple of years
[1:01:00] you know and as i was speaking to
[1:01:03] that friend of mine
[1:01:06] telling them how how could this
[1:01:22] and
[1:01:24] i know that that uh
[1:01:28] that the lord has a
[1:01:29] a greater purpose
[1:01:31] for me
[1:01:34] but for each and every one of them
[1:01:38] you know a lot of times i love that
[1:01:39] where brother branham said
[1:01:44] because you may think
[1:01:47] sitting here in church
[1:01:50] you don't know
[1:02:13] of what's sitting right here in front of
[1:02:15] us
[1:02:18] and i know that
[1:02:20] if you guys would only know what you
[1:02:22] have here
[1:02:25] the ministry that's here in minnesota
[1:02:28] it's so beautiful that we have we hear
[1:02:30] it sunday after sunday after sunday
[1:02:49] because as as we are
[1:02:52] going through bible studies back back
[1:02:54] home
[1:02:58] for example
[1:03:00] if we were to have it today
[1:03:03] without fail sin fighter
[1:03:08] whoever speaks behind the sacred desk
[1:03:12] the lord vindicates wednesday's bible
[1:03:14] study yes
[1:03:28] question
[1:03:31] you two have to be talking to each other
[1:03:35] there is no way that the message that
[1:03:37] comes forth on sunday
[1:03:40] domingo that's right down the line la
[1:03:43] mismalinia from wednesday
[1:03:45] without you guys saying one word
[1:03:49] i
[1:03:50] can't even put that i just it's
[1:03:52] mind-boggling blows my mind
[1:03:56] and finally really i finally realized
[1:04:00] oh they were talking all right oh it's
[1:04:01] down orlando but
[1:04:04] but
[1:04:05] they weren't talking to each other
[1:04:09] it's the holy spirit in the ministry
[1:04:10] speech
[1:04:35] how could it be so perfect from genesis
[1:04:37] to revelation says the genesis has
[1:04:38] apocalypse
[1:04:40] thousands of years apart miles de ano is
[1:04:42] apart
[1:04:43] and it's so perfect
[1:04:46] because god doesn't make mistakes
[1:04:49] there's only one thing that god can't do
[1:05:06] sometimes i'm just speechless of what
[1:05:08] seeing the lord moving so in the
[1:05:10] supernatural story
[1:05:18] in the message a testimony upon the sea
[1:05:20] in the
[1:05:36] that you know as i'm driving i'm
[1:05:38] listening to him in my headset
[1:05:42] you know and a lot of times
[1:05:44] you know as you're driving which i'll
[1:05:46] listen to
[1:05:47] sometimes we're there you know sun drive
[1:05:49] with two hands
[1:05:52] i'm driving one
[1:05:53] amano i've seen some people drive with
[1:05:55] their knees
[1:05:58] but i wanted to raise my hand so much
[1:06:01] when he said the word weave
[1:06:15] now these brethren are signing on
[1:06:17] different parts
[1:06:19] of god's great lake
[1:06:20] ora
[1:06:25] now i come up here in this little city
[1:06:27] to weave my net with yours
[1:07:08] i got three children at home they go
[1:07:09] through sijos in la casa i go get ice
[1:07:11] cream
[1:07:14] three different kinds the three
[1:07:15] different classes one one's vanilla one
[1:07:18] one strawberry and one one's chocolate
[1:07:21] chocolate and when i come
[1:07:24] with ice cream
[1:07:27] looks like a rainbow but
[1:07:29] but it's but look it's all ice cream
[1:07:32] peres
[1:07:34] the flavor doesn't count
[1:07:37] there we are brother estamos hermanos
[1:07:40] we're all eating ice cream
[1:07:44] and how many of us here agree with
[1:07:46] everybody on
[1:07:47] on this message
[1:07:52] i would find it hard to believe that
[1:07:53] everybody is 100
[1:08:06] and i was looking at the word weave
[1:08:19] to become united in principle is is the
[1:08:23] nursing principle relationship in
[1:08:25] relation or interest when interest
[1:08:28] and aren't we
[1:08:32] marching towards the same goal
[1:08:37] or do you only
[1:08:39] want
[1:08:41] to be part of that body of the lord
[1:08:42] jesus christ
[1:08:47] don't you want your brother and your
[1:08:48] sister to be there is
[1:09:04] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:09:07] of your mouth but that which is good to
[1:09:09] use to the use of edifying that it may
[1:09:12] minister grace and to the years
[1:09:18] parallel
[1:09:22] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:09:23] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[1:09:25] redemption

[1:09:47] one to malice tenderhearted forgiving

[1:10:11] what they do your father
[1:10:14] no

[1:10:23] for someone else
[1:10:27] father forgive them for they know not
[1:10:29] what they do
[1:10:32] in the message
[1:10:33] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:10:38] you say well this guy did a certain
[1:10:39] thing
[1:10:57] while hermana blamed the devil the culpa
[1:10:59] diablo
[1:11:00] that's the one who caused it
[1:11:07] first peter 1 22
[1:11:09] pedro uno entidos
[1:11:15] seeing ye have purified your souls and
[1:11:17] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:11:19] unto unfeigned love of the brethren
[1:11:22] see that you love one another with a
[1:11:24] pure heart fervently
[1:11:30] espiritu
[1:11:38] de corazon
[1:11:41] matthew 18
[1:11:43] matthew chapter 18 verse 15 to 18.
[1:11:53] brother abraham god bless you
[1:11:55] it's good to see you
[1:11:56] i love you brother
[1:12:02] moreover if thy brother shall trespass
[1:12:04] against thee
[1:12:06] go and tell your neighbor
[1:12:16] moreover if thy brother shall trespass
[1:12:18] against thee
[1:12:19] go tell someone else
[1:12:21] let me agree with you
[1:12:27] moreover if that brother shall trespass
[1:12:29] against thee
[1:12:31] go post it on social media
[1:12:32] situation
[1:12:44] you can
[1:12:45] light a little
[1:12:47] brush or
[1:13:03] but when we put something on social
[1:13:05] media
[1:13:08] it's worldwide just like this
[1:13:11] for everybody to give their own opinion
[1:13:14] and it's either going to be
[1:13:17] they're either going to take your side
[1:13:20] or they're going to take the other
[1:13:21] person
[1:13:24] i remember my dad said one time
[1:13:27] he used to say it all the time
[1:13:29] there's three sides to every story i
[1:13:31] tres lados in cala historia yes there's
[1:13:34] three sides to every coin
[1:13:37] there's his side estella
[1:13:40] there's my side milado and then there's
[1:13:42] the truth
[1:13:44] so
[1:13:45] how do we know what's the truth
[1:13:48] if someone says something
[1:13:51] how do we know what
[1:13:53] if it's true if we haven't heard the
[1:13:55] story of the other brothers
[1:14:02] we are too quick to
[1:14:04] to take sides with someone without
[1:14:05] knowing the truth
[1:14:09] how would you like to go to court
[1:14:12] and the
[1:14:12] prosecutor says this person did this
[1:14:15] this this and this
[1:14:17] person
[1:14:19] and without hearing the defense
[1:14:22] the jury says guilty quest
[1:14:26] how much more should we how that we
[1:14:28] should feel towards our brother or our
[1:14:30] sister
[1:14:33] aren't they part of the body of jesus
[1:14:34] christ
[1:14:38] moreover if thy brother shall trespass
[1:14:39] against thee go and tell him his fault
[1:14:41] between thee
[1:14:42] and him alone yes
[1:14:45] and he shall hear thee
[1:14:46] thou has gained thy brother
[1:14:52] solos
[1:14:54] at
[1:14:56] but if he will not hear thee then take
[1:14:57] with thee one or two more that in the
[1:14:59] mouth of two or three witnesses every
[1:15:02] word may be established
[1:15:11] but if he will hear
[1:15:14] and if he shall neglect to hear them
[1:15:17] sell it unto the church but if he
[1:15:19] neglect to hear the church let him be
[1:15:21] unto thee as a heathen
[1:15:31] for verily i say unto you whosoever
[1:15:34] whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
[1:15:36] be bound in heaven
[1:15:37] and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth
[1:15:39] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:15:49] you know but
[1:15:50] if your brother or sister you see that
[1:15:52] they make a mistake
[1:15:56] you absolutely have every right to go
[1:15:59] talk about it
[1:16:03] but
[1:16:04] not to your brother
[1:16:06] but don't go talk to your sister or us
[1:16:09] thank you to god
[1:16:11] you'll say lord what can i do to help
[1:16:13] him
[1:16:16] or pray for him
[1:16:18] pray for her
[1:16:33] i was speaking to a minister one time
[1:16:37] he was mentioning to me and this goes
[1:16:40] way back
[1:16:41] before there was even pagers or cell
[1:16:43] phones
[1:16:45] or telephones
[1:16:47] and he
[1:16:48] he was telling me that you know as you
[1:16:50] guys have here
[1:16:54] how the time changes
[1:16:57] you either put the time forward or or
[1:16:59] you set it back
[1:17:02] well there was a brother in his church
[1:17:04] that forgot to change the time hermanos
[1:17:09] and
[1:17:10] he got to church early an hour early
[1:17:15] you know nowadays
[1:17:17] yes that'd be easy just take out your
[1:17:18] phone
[1:17:19] telephone call
[1:17:23] call your brother
[1:17:25] call your sister
[1:17:26] but back then
[1:17:31] so
[1:17:33] the brother didn't have a choice but to
[1:17:34] wait till he got home
[1:17:40] and
[1:17:42] it was probably the longest drive
[1:17:45] of his life
[1:17:49] because when he got to church
[1:17:52] because he got there on time
[1:17:55] according to what he thought yeah
[1:17:58] he was there
[1:17:59] 30 minutes earlier
[1:18:02] actually he was an hour and a half
[1:18:05] but when he got there
[1:18:07] he thought the rapture had happened and
[1:18:09] he was left
[1:18:14] so
[1:18:16] upon arriving to the house that's why i
[1:18:18] said it must have been the longest ride
[1:18:20] of his driver of his life
[1:18:24] oh
[1:18:25] i you know for example oh i gotta call
[1:18:27] brother caleb
[1:18:29] because if he's not here
[1:18:32] then
[1:18:33] surely the rapture happens
[1:18:37] so the brother gets home
[1:18:48] everybody was on their way to church
[1:18:52] so when he got there and he called
[1:18:55] the brother did not answer
[1:18:58] and he was
[1:19:00] maybe
[1:19:01] the rapture happened and i missed
[1:19:23] and
[1:19:24] that's how we think sometimes we are we
[1:19:25] automatically judge people yes
[1:19:28] automatically
[1:19:30] and that's why there's going to be so
[1:19:32] many disappointments
[1:20:01] and when he didn't answer the phone
[1:20:03] either
[1:20:05] i don't know what he thought jono said
[1:20:08] because at that point
[1:20:10] we were falling off the chair laughing
[1:20:15] because
[1:20:16] i probably would have thought the same
[1:20:17] way
[1:20:25] and speaking from personal experience
[1:20:30] i remember when and it's
[1:20:33] sad to think this way or to say this
[1:20:37] the truth is
[1:20:40] i remember when my daughter was
[1:20:42] two
[1:20:43] maybe two three years old
[1:20:47] we got up one morning
[1:20:50] and she was nowhere to be found
[1:20:56] and i say that it's sad to say this
[1:20:58] is
[1:21:14] and she said nothing.
[1:21:19] nothing
[1:21:20] called her
[1:21:21] we searched the house
[1:21:23] and down
[1:21:24] every room and she could not be found
[1:21:36] what went through my mind is how that
[1:21:37] other brother thought is
[1:21:40] pencil
[1:21:52] that i wasn't serving the lord
[1:21:58] i thought going to church on sunday
[1:22:00] morning was good enough
[1:22:02] oh i got a good message this morning
[1:22:06] can you know something
[1:22:09] that's going to last me all week
[1:22:13] oh by sunday by the time i got out of
[1:22:16] church i didn't remember what the
[1:22:17] brothers said
[1:22:22] didn't pick up the bible on monday
[1:22:25] tuesday
[1:22:26] very rarely did i go to church on
[1:22:28] wednesday
[1:22:34] and
[1:22:35] i honestly thought
[1:22:37] that the rapture had come
[1:22:42] and then
[1:22:44] after thinking that way
[1:22:48] a couple seconds later minutes later i
[1:22:50] it felt like an eternity
[1:22:56] she pops her head out from behind the
[1:22:57] couch
[1:23:00] and that to me was like the happiest day
[1:23:03] of my life he
[1:23:04] is
[1:23:06] and
[1:23:08] even then
[1:23:09] as a parent you would
[1:23:11] probably want to spank your child for
[1:23:13] not answering you
[1:23:14] the first time the second time the third
[1:23:16] time the fourth time
[1:23:18] el nino
[1:23:45] do you know without a shadow of a doubt
[1:23:48] savvy stetson sombra de duda that if you
[1:23:50] were to go today
[1:23:53] that you've made everything right
[1:23:57] just something to think about is algo de
[1:23:59] pensar
[1:24:02] and in closing
[1:24:03] serrando
[1:24:06] how things change from
[1:24:09] the time
[1:24:10] when
[1:24:11] my daughter was hiding come on come on
[1:24:17] not too long ago i went to a family
[1:24:18] member's house
[1:24:23] we opened the door of rimos la puerta
[1:24:26] and we ring the doorbell nobody answered
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:25:04] seems like they just came home from
[1:25:06] buying groceries
[1:25:09] my mind was
[1:25:20] because something had changed within me
[1:25:23] via cambiado dentro de
[1:25:26] and then
[1:25:28] after they came home
[1:25:31] oh we went to this and this and
[1:25:33] where they were at
[1:25:38] the question was asked
[1:25:41] me
[1:25:42] when you didn't find anybody did you
[1:25:44] think the rapture happened
[1:25:49] now my answer was different
[1:25:51] response
[1:26:02] can you
[1:26:03] say without a shadow of a doubt
[1:26:06] in sombra de duda
[1:26:09] that you know you're right that you are
[1:26:11] right with god
[1:26:15] this is something to think about
[1:26:18] i'm not
[1:26:22] even with hearing what the message that
[1:26:24] brother caleb brought forth
[1:26:26] on sunday the golden age
[1:26:33] i know jose because i used to think that
[1:26:36] way
[1:26:38] if i was sitting right there where
[1:26:39] you're sitting right now
[1:26:44] that
[1:26:46] brother caleb spoke with me hermano
[1:26:48] caleb
[1:26:53] that's why the holy spirit the way he
[1:26:55] moves
[1:26:58] the way he works
[1:27:02] that's what that's why i used to think
[1:27:04] that surely
[1:27:07] these
[1:27:08] they have to be tough
[1:27:12] and then for a while it became like a
[1:27:14] run like a running joke
[1:27:16] you
[1:27:31] and i think it not that it didn't
[1:27:33] solidify for me but
[1:27:34] i knew that when a visiting minister
[1:27:37] would come from out of town
[1:27:42] pueblo and there have been many ianavido
[1:27:44] muchos
[1:27:54] so i know that this lord he's moving in
[1:27:57] such a supernatural way
[1:28:13] you don't realize how privileged you are
[1:28:15] this evening
[1:28:18] the ministry here in this place
[1:28:23] this is a special place
[1:28:25] to me it's so good to be here
[1:28:31] i love you all with all my heart
[1:28:41] you know just
[1:28:43] let us love one another
[1:28:47] even as christ loved the church
[1:28:51] and gave his life
[1:28:53] he died for you
[1:28:54] [Music]
[1:28:55] he died for me for me
