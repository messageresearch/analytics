says did you hit it and I said the dog saved itself because I have the Holy ghosts that oh Hermanos implemented something unfortunate that happened right Satan always tries to do things keeps us and he hides us it's not what the devil wants to do is the purpose God has with each one of our Lives until God is finished with me that is the confidence speaking of Christians as control over all things and see is I am very happy these allergies not because of the allergies no no no I don't suffer formalities but in some way I see this weather tries to affect me I simply tried to ignore it and continue foreign if we open our Bibles and Lucas Luke chapter 5 verse 17. I'll ask you to please stand if you're able to you Lucas scriptures say in Luke Chapter 5 and verse 17. and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee in Judea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal them Lord your word it remains forever Lord it is a seed Lord it is our weapons for the destruction of powers open up these scriptures [Music] that there may not be no one here in this place or anyone that's hearing us to receive what they have come from Lord we believe it with all of us let me tell you something I have good news I like good news if you may participate with me embarrass you or do anything to try to embarrass you hold up hey cuantos estan Inferno okay problems now how many have pain I'm a gardener sometimes for too much physical work and I have to go to God raise your hand the power of the Lord [Music] in a version [Music] in the King James version 1967. this verse says the power of God was there to heal them I like that verse Jesus Christ when it says the power of God was there to heal them that will help you in your Christian Life and I thank you with all of my heart and the prayer service that we had you could take these cut up words when I said okay I had found something that had changed my life when I read about what brother Branham said that God loved to be worshiped when you worship tremendous tremendous things now it's not something that I invented the Bible and we prove it and the prayer service if we talk about faith we have to talk about the Supernatural and we talk about faith we're talking about a world that we cannot explain and we cannot do anything if as men we could do things that's where password forward that's where we speak about faith I want to share one other thing with you brother this this has helped in my Christian Life [Music] I don't have here uh knowledge or anything that can help you and your knowledge nothing but I have something that I live [Music] God bless his ministry foreign what God has promised in his word to testify what God did in your life you are proving that Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever you're proving it I have heard people now I want to testify that's fine brothers Christian I want the pizza yes in a I Place Angels not only spiritual ministers or my benefits let me share something with you cometh by hearing known as tremendous Jonathan we heard Johnson's wife how the Lord healed her glory to God Lord bless her if the Lord did it with her he can do that with me impressive Jesus Christ did the same yesterday today and forever and the testimonies is to give the glory to God foreign we give glory to God by hearing I remember I'll help your faith I remember Brothers when our pastor Michaela was praying Ministry he spoke about being sincere being honest with God friend and he made an invitation to the front many people came up as ministers God simply told me as I was ministering to him the Lord told me he had a problem in his foot you're healed foreign Glory Amigos I have friends that they're like my family now many of you know them brother uh we're very close um my wife is with my child at the hospital the Holy Spirit told me the problem of your child a child has a urinary infection because the Lord will heal him foreign foreign to heal them one time my pastor calls me our bless our pastor I understand there we where he is Lord Familia wife his family follow me Brothers I assure you yes honored his word with them that believed he will do it again because I have good news is the caller from another pastor at another place there is a family who has a girl a little girl who has gives her a gift the pastor doesn't know how to deal with them and the Holy Spirit has sent them here I didn't know who it was I told my pastor said Caleb yeah she's uh her skin is a a darker skin yes if that is her foreign by here same yesterday today and forever she testified she was walking right she said the pain was too much after that prayer service he said I even forgot and the power of God was there to heal foreign like for us to go to the scriptures in Mark chapter 10. verse 38. I'm helping you Marcus Mark chapter 10 verse 38. I've read this so many times oh and the Spirit came he may be maybe maybe and he verified this word to me I am so happy now take it foreign capture this is can you drink up the cup that I drink of wow wow both eggs and you drink up the cup that I drink of Jesus I don't know if you love Jesus can you drink of the cup that I drink of Lord can I can I drink from that question can I be baptized by your spirits Lord I want to drink I want to drink when the Holy Spirit tells me are you willing to pay the price [Music] Jesus says if you want you can drink of the same cup that I drink of is give me to drink brother it's been a blessing where to be able to enter and drink from that cup I asked don't you want to drink business invites come to me those that are thirsty El problema the problem he said there's no one thirsty is that our thirsty the drink from is not important it doesn't matter the price you're talking about a price the price he's had to pay to stand to other places foreign amigo I ask is he your enemy he is healed and to destroy but sometimes we Act as if we have a covenant or some sort of association with him if someone in the natural breaks into our home if your arm you'll take your arm out and you'll defend but Satan comes he gets us sick he takes her children takes her wives takes here and there we act as if it didn't matter to destroy he's our enemy I said Lord I want to drink from your cup you have to pay a price glory to God whatever it is Lord the enemy's doing he is an enemy when I entered to pray the first thing I do I take the armor and I begin in the name of Jesus Christ all of your weapons I say Satan to heal the scriptures say look at look at this picture now I'll enter into the message is five minutes but I wanted you to get to this level you can now understand the scripture he say and Lucas capitulo and doctors of the law was there the scribes hearing the teachings about Jesus now the Bible says it was a teaching no I don't believe okay this teaching was for two hours for six hours because the Pharisees were there asking Jesus challenging questions Moses says this Jesus but the prophet say this is Moses also says this that's what they were doing in a teaching when the scriptures where they're listening what a waste of time and the power of God was there to heal them a four or five four four or five nobodies for five crazy young people that knew that Jesus they're seeing what Jesus had done they took their paralyzed and they were going to take him to his presence the Bible says when Jesus saw their face faith has worked yes when he heard the testimonies of his friends Amigo friend the neighbor she received healing Amigo neighbors beg for money he received the site so he came and said I believe the parallel is the God wants to hear me let him come and come heal me if it's the will of God so he can come and heal me at my house foreign they believed that is the Bible says when they arrive to the house they could not enter no no no no it looks too occupied let's go home no no no no no no no no no no no no paralyzed I will leave Watkins but I will enter because no limits my face it is on my emotions these young people oh there's lots of people oh no yes oh no no these men were [Music] I've taken these young people yes when they come before Jesus Jesus tells them seeing their faith faith has to have Works faith has to have a confession I'm not sure but in Romans you confess with your mouth believe in your heart you will be safe will you believe in your heart [Music] [Applause] he begins to dance foreign all of the gifts we should be the example for what God has given us but the power of God was present there to heal them when you believe you have to receive this I finish when you believe what you believe the word of God it is a seed it has to produce no it has to produce it's what the gifts are foreign Diego is I'd like for you to bring something for the people Sunday evening pray for the

one day many times I felt in my heart last three days I did it for two years the ministry of my Prophet William barium Branham foreign we don't know they're not afraid to minister the word because we
