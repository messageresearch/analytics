question then we have to ask la pregunta a I said how many here are in control of your condition your state of affair or your position what to stay standing control this is not a contest in viento opposition one of the worst feelings that we can we can have in life no loss in tomatoes muy Feliz because we are a people that want to be in control or give us almost gente que almost are in control is when we are out of control it's going to tell us where they control amen I mean how many here ever get out of control what - the key society where they control muchas veces let me see how many honest people were because some people don't want to answer that's ok they're going to hit you this time but keep them up I want to see you I would really want to see making my business - we are we we many times we get out of control which is that Lemos the control yes or yes si o si that's not a good feeling right it's a nice one wins and because when we come back to our senses we realize that we if we did we did a number on the on whoever we were we were we got out of control with Quentin ska music he says lastimado when we we lose our mind for a moment I almost lamentable me nuclear going insane for a moment that's better than one has anybody here been insane for a moment what does an astonishing you can't even think you can't even see straight jacket done and how keep here this day and when it overtakes us even for just a brief moment I won't put mmm we don't feel good about it it's because we realize then that somebody else was in control porque no zoom squint that Calgon master one control yes sir yes come on now then you cannot lose control of something no people there is someone or something else that is taking control of it now I'm innocent I gotta see how are you

I live right please the Lord please one another in one second either by the way get out of control it opened in Los Alamos between radio but yeah most that's when our businesses failed it's just fine when our spending is out of control when our home life fails when we get out of control then the most weight under control that's when our homes and and our church fails people that are part of it they fail let's get this case on par today use fire that shows that there's not anyone was just anyone good night this morning it shows Westra that somebody is there controlling at all times yeah in the state control and oh my grandfather would say this Papa this year when there are two people fighting and I know spilly endo let one of them leave the room una serie de cuarto that right we're done
