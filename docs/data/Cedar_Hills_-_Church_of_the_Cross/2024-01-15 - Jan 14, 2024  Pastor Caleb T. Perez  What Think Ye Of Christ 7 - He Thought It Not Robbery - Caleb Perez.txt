========================================

for for [Music] [Music] h [Music] for [Music] yay we are on beginning on the fourth chapter of the book of Hebrews the whole book here is just a revelation of Jesus Christ now the thought is if we are on our way to the rest what is the rest where is it is it jining church is it being uh baptized a certain way is it becoming a member of the greatest Church in the city wearing better clothes is it education is it money so we can get work just lay down rest the rest of her life as we call it that's not it listen what the Bible says it is and how we get it for unto us the day then the gospel was preached as well as unto them that God has sent a deliver the Holy Ghost and we're on a road to the promised land now people has made a Creeds and denominations but God Still Remains at our rest as the Holy Ghost oh my bre let me stop here for a minute no matter how much the word is preached how well you like the way it's been preached unless you yourself are a partaker of that it won't do you one bit of good but they failed to get it when they got there because of their unbelief they were turned aside at only 40 miles from where they left in Egypt to the promised land and they were 40 years getting there because of their unbelief now the nth verse get ready there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God a Sabbath keeping to the people of God for he that has entered into his Christ rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his on the Sabbath he built the world put the creation on it and went to rest and never come back again to build any more world he does the same today he's Jehovah J Jehovah RI the same yesterday to end forever he never fails that's what you Mar the church they've been taught little old Petty sissified old lady doctrine of some sort run around have soup suppers and card parties no wonder we got a bunch of chaos that we got we don't need children's programs and little soup suppers what we need a rugged old gospel and man of Faith with the sword hanging out there and challenging correct you Church of God the rest of you holess people because you rejected the life you denominated yourself and said we won't believe any more than this God moved right on out and showed you he had people who would follow him what happened to you Pentecostals you had the light God's Tu it away from you the pillar of fire moves on every time the pillar of fire moved the church moved with it and the pillar of fire moves all hallelujah amen I went back I just come from Canada I thought here I am M People what's am me I don't do that I went to washing on my car I thought God I'm get to be an old man here I am I fought I've cried I've beg and anything I get a big blashe anything I get somebody say something bad about you all the old holy ruler something like that I thought about that in a voice come to me said that man's all right if they're doing that but I never calleda you to do that I called you to take the sword and standing on like Joshua W and challenge brother not fle around with some old Society or some church organization but challenge the devil AM stand in the Forefront make right right and wrong wrong preach the word and find out who's got the faith to believe it they out there amen I got the speed up on that car all time watch I said Thank You Lord thank you Lord felt good then it's all right Lord I'll grip her a little tighter and now I want to die with it in my hand that is the rest the Holy Ghost Jesus said come unto me all your we in Heavenly and I'll give you rest I'll give you life eternal life Zoey God's own life God God will come into you and be a part of you he'll give you a birth and make you a son and daughter now watch that was the third rest to give the first God received it from his word second Israel received it in the law third the church received it as a part of God so if you've never received the Holy Ghost yet you have never entered into God's rest and when you enter into this rest you cease from your own worldly works like God did from his why you're part of God and the reason that you believe God and Believe In Miracles and signs and M is because you're Sons and Daughters of God Amen you receed life oh Lamb of God I come I now come believing that now I pass from Death unto life because right here in my seat I've accepted you as my savior and I feel peace in my heart

good to be alive and it's it's good to be here with you all amen we are number seven what think you of Christ with a subtitle he thought it not robbery those of you that know the scripture you know where we're at so before we get going help me out here triple purpose number one no somebody help help okay well then we'll give you number two and his bride number three to restore the kingdom amen amen we pray that these these messages have been a blessing to you as they have been to me and uh we we want to to uh say this that when this is all said and done none of us will have an excuse I'm G to say it again none of us will have an excuse we will know who exactly who we are that's why we're here right that's why Satan fights us so much this is my first message in the New Year okay so I hope you get comfortable today first message hey this year so we're going to get right into the word but before before they put it up don't put up the scripture yet let me see how many of you remember the scripture that we've been using Matthew what you got to know the scriptures too Matthew 22 41 and 42 amen you have it you can say Amen while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ amen may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen there's a lot of people that are out today God bless them wherever they may be but today we are here we want to speak this on he thought it not robbery and to be able to understand this we want to speak on the subject of identity never was a person like Jesus and I get a witness here today I want to make sure that you're awake and you're alive this morning a person so different that the religious world could not identify him he could not fit or did not fit in any of their boxes the religious world could not identify him because his life was so Supernatural as Jesus is asking them this question without them realizing he is uh he's revealing his identity the identity is in the question what do you think of Christ and the same way it is today the way that he revealed his identity back then is the same way that he is revealing his identity today John chap 3 verse 2 Nicodemus comes to Jesus we know the scripture but he we find here out that he's trying to identify him now now we've heard many messages on identification but but watch at where the holy spirit is leading us today he came to Jesus by night and he says Rabbi so the first thing he knows is is uh he calls him Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from God this is about all that he knows about Jesus's identity right calls him Rabbi he calls him a teacher and he said because no man can do the these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him but we know that he was much more than than a rabbi or a teacher and then to top it all as they begin to ask him different questions different people watch what he says then as he's he's identifying himself he goes on to say that I and my father are one he's he's identifying himself more and as soon as he says I and my father are one the Jews take up stones to Stone him they don't like the identity that he is putting forth how many are with me and I can see them saying well if Jesus and his father are one maybe we should try to identify the father right are you with me I think you might be still asleep some of you okay stretch it out a little bit if you're a little sleep stretch it out if your mind is wandering off get it back pinch yourself this morning we're going somewhere good right okay we're going somewhere good here watch now so if you and the father are one then Phillip comes to him and say well then Lord show us the father then in other words identify the father to us and Jesus I can imagine him scratching his head a little bit and he says have I been so long a time with you and yet hast thou not known me he says philli he that hath seen me ha seen the Father for I and the father we are one so how are you really telling me show us the father when I am I am the very identity of the father I am what came forth what do you think of Christ whose son is he this is why identity is so important this is why Satan does everything in his power to try and keep us from our identity if I were to ask you how many of you know your identity how many of you have an identity how many of you know who you are really okay okay let me see your hands I I mean act like you know like believe it okay so so so we have an identity now now now I'm going to say brother brother James James what's your identity who who's who's whose son are you who who are you you're the son of brother Diego but he said I'm also a son of God now if brother brother James did something wrong made a mistake and I would say I thought you said you were brother Diego's son I know something about you would that make him any less of a son to brother Diego so then why are we do we struggle so much when we make a mistake why do we struggle and we say I don't know if I'm a Son of God anymore I don't know if I'm a daughter of God anymore am I speaking to anyone here the first thing we do it's we have to realize there's an attack on our identity sat is doing all that he can to keep us from understanding or knowing our identity he hates it when a person's true identity is revealed do you know why he hates it so much because when Satan and his angels were cast down from heaven the Bible says they lost their first state let me put it another way when they were cast down from heaven they lost their identity now now now we have to understand this because when these Devils or these angels Fallen Angels when they lost their identity they started searching for a new identity this is so very important today to know so here's Satan is cast down with his angels and and now if I were to ask you how many of you know where sin started did it start in the Garden of Eden no no no it started in heaven is that right so if sin started in heaven the only identity that these Fallen Angels could have was they had to attach themselves to the attributes of sin they have no other identity watch how important this is now they lost their identity and that's why Devils hate to be unmasked is that right Devils hate to be exposed they'll cover themselves they'll hide themselves but once they're exposed cast them out is easy that's that's the whole purpose because they're trying to hide under another identity that is not theirs okay now we we understand we're going to understand the the battle and why there's such a battle they have no real identity so they've taken on something that is temporary the very word devil means a Tormentor that's their job is to torment us yes yes or yes now now now now why are we afraid to talk sometimes I was talking to to to a brother I think it was brother Diego that was telling me he had this pain in the front of his leg and and it had been for a few years he said but then one day the holy spirit says why are you living with that pain why are you letting that devil torment you pass it out already he looked down and saidan devil you nasty pig that's me saying that okay and he cast him out he said now now he he he kept trying to come back but he said I stayed firm and after a week of him trying he realized he could not come in anymore he was gone why do we not live like that there's no reason for him to torment us day after day after day it's time like we heard for us to begin to torment them now once again they they lost their identity and they're looking around to see where they can find an identity that's why you have to have your guard up all the time watch what brother brandham says God is the author of Life Satan the author of death he puts a demon in there it's called a devil called cancer now watch one of these Devils loses its identity for the only thing can do once again is attach himself to an attribute of sinness it's a cancer now watch why why this is so tremendous brother Bram says cancer is not its name I'm GNA say it again this devil of cancer cancer is not its name medic science just give it a cancer or a name cancer oh now it's got a little it looks like a little identity going on huh I'm cancer and that cancer always comes with fear so when you begin to fear what happens that cancer or that crab it gets more a hold of us and it gets deeper in US and then it's harder to cast out but when that cancer comes and says I'm here and I'm going to invade you you have right then a chance there's a moment right there that you can stop that but if you accept it first in your mind he'll take your body are you with me now once again Medical Science called it cancer in other words gave it a name how tremendous that is why even Adam gave names to the animals I'll leave that with you are you getting it it has no identity it has no name of itself so someone else gives it a name that is describing the torment oh my well the doctor says you have the I like that wordan devil the doctor says you have this unclean devil has no identity but it's coming to you to try to find an identity I'm building a platform here okay just stay with me in this until we get this this built that word cancer come from the word crab and it means that with legs and things and and it runs out they're given medical terms but then that little cancer comes in there first it's a spirit but then it comes into a backsliding cell or a bruise cell or a cell that's not operating right he says that's what happens in a church when he gets someone failing to operate with the church nobody tells me what to do my own person someone failing and pulling off and getting indifferent that's a cancer in the church uh oh uh oh come on now we're getting somewhere it's a devil in that person and that causes the whole church to be sick over it the best thing to do is to have a spiritual operation then why would we fear someone or something that has no identity wait wait wait a minute I purpose I wanted to preach this this morning I want to run I'm telling but man I just feel the rain just hold it just I want you to get this once again why would we fear something or someone that has no identity the only reason we fear is when we don't know our identity and when we don't have an identity we're making ourselves the same as that uh oh oh oh my my my my my watch this now watch this why was iniquity found in Satan or Lucifer why I want to know that why was you were perfect the Bible says Beauty and all these things but until iniquity was found in you you know why because he refused to accept his God given identity you were perfect what an identity you were perfect in Beauty a god-given identity church and every one of you each one of us that is here today one of us that is hearing today we were made perfect Beauty the problem is is that we want another identity we're looking for something else than what God has already given lufer wanted a different identity apart from God and he tries to do us the same and that is demonic what's the first thing that happens with people I'm not going to church no more what are they saying I don't have an identity and I'm trying to get an identity separate from God that's why people don't come to church right they they're trying to form another identity away from God watch it watch it you are now open to all these Devils that are looking for an identity oh church I I pray that you get this now those demons are trying to get into the promised land what is the promised land the Holy Spirit and where is the Holy Spirit Come on come on here right here come on everybody point to your heart right here here is the here is this Promised Land oh I like this watch watch as we get this going this is so good what is a false prophet brother Braham says it's a perverted preacher right it's a perverted preacher that some devil looking for an identity found someone to come into it's all it is you get somebody that's something that's false trying to copy something that's true ah watch watch here now and when he fully incarnates that's full possession and the word possession means ownership he occupies and when he does that perverts your identity how many Christians do we have here Christians means to be Christlike many Christians now you're just like Christ that's what Christian is you're like Christ how many of you live like Christ how many of you talk like [Music] Christ okay here we go remember when I preached and I said to be like Jesus Who Wants to Be Like Jesus okay why are we complaining all the time he was a man a man of Sorrows the Bible say acquainted with grief wounded for our transgression bruis for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him you still want to be like Jesus I don't know why this is happening to me I guess Jesus don't love me you don't want to be like Jesus if you wanted to be like Jesus you would Praise Him and worship him you say Thank You Lord my character is being molded I am understanding my identity that's why we're here today is because we want to be sure about who who we are and what we are now now now notice this now in order for saying to be a man he has to Incarnate same as the holy spirit in a person the Holy Spirit up there won't do you no good oh I was church and oh I felt the Holy Spirit wonderful but has he come to dwell in you it does you no good unless it's inside of you and when the Holy Ghost or the Holy Spirit comes in you then you are like the most high and you think it not robbery for you have put on the mind of Christ and the real robbery is when Satan tries to get into the congregation and he puts on a garment but he can't put on the holy ghost that was our founding pastor War has been declared on your identity tell your neighbor neighbor War has been declared on your identity and all Satan has to do is make us doubt who we really are oh come on now come on now you got to have to start pulling that now all Satan has to do is to make you doubt just one little thing I doubt it you're a Son of God I doubt it you don't know what I've done wait a minute wait a minute all he's got to do is make you doubt for one moment why so many in the world today don't know who they are or what they are they don't have they're looking for an identity and most people spend their entire lives trying to form an identity I'm sorry but I got all these points you just got to I'm G to say it again most people spend their whole life try to form an identity who who are you well um I want to be this great Sports person okay so they train and they do all these things what are they trying to do they're try form an identity because they want to be easily identified oh come on come on now I'm going to say that again this is what people want today I want everybody to identify me right away Michael Jordan boom oh yeah Michael Jordan best basketball player ever unless you're a Kobe fan or whatever that's not the point the point is easily identified we know who that is people long for that same thing I want to be known like this rock star this singer or this that or the other I don't want none of those things after one thing and that's that I want to know my identity I want to know who I am I want know where I came from I want to know what I'm doing here I want to know where I'm going only by my identity will I ever answer those questions watch this we don't form our own identity this is the problem in the churches I want to be known as a great preacher who cares about that I want to be known as some great somebody some great [Music] who cares about that that's not my identity there's something longing there's something more there's greater inside of me something greater inside of you notice as as as this comes oh I just love this we don't form our own identity because our identity was established long before we even came to Earth I I'm looking for an identity where are you looking my identity was already established even before I came to Earth even my style of pre preaching was already established either We believe We Came From God or we don't in the back part of God's mind our identity was already established in Christ when he thought of Christ he thought of us he didn't have one thought of Christ and another thought of you and I no when he thought of Christ he thought of you and I church I hope that you get this this morning where were you job come on now job you want to know your identity where were you job when the morning starts sing and the Son of God shouted for Joy where were you I'm trying to give you your identity Somewhere In The Eternity was the identity of Christ and his church watch this now watch oh there there's our identity how many of you want your identity you got it where did you find it if I ask you young men where do you find your identity brother Isaiah where where do you find it you go to walart Walmart I'm looking for our identity do you go online Amazon's got everything Amon no no where do you go in Christ that's where our identity lies the bride's identity is found in Christ watch the tactics the tricks that the devil plays order to keep us from our identity why I love this message so much slap me across the face wake up this is your identity and when you see it you're like wow thanks for the good slap Lord I sure listen closely because this is so important in your lives if you ever write something down write this down this is the tricks that the devil plays with your identity this is our problem now we humans we Define ourselves okay everybody we're all we all Define ourselves we Define ourselves in our identity by what we do or fail to do for Christ I'm going to let that one sink in for a moment well I sure messed up I guess I I I don't even know why he loves me anymore trick of the devil we Define ourselves and our identity by what we do or fail to do for Christ but thanks be to God he judges us on a higher level he judges us with a different standard he defines Us by a higher standard listen listen closely now this is the key to overcoming Christ doesn't Define Us by what we do or don't do for him Christ defines Who We Are by who he is ljah uhuh nuh uhuh n uhuh you didn't get that you didn't get that because I see some of your and when you start looking like if you're in space somewhere you're not even here your body is here and the devil saying good job think of youres think about your work tomorrow pinch yourself wake up this morning Christ defines Who We Are by who he is that'll kill more Devils than anything else you look at what you did and you did this and you did that but look who he is because I came from him and I'm here manifested today because I have an identity he defines Us by what he has already done not by what I'm going to do he defines Us by what he already did for us do you see why it's so important that Paul would say it is no longer I that live but it's Christ that liveth in me our identity I don't want an identity without Christ it's Christ that lives in me and that's what gives me my identity I want you to repeat after me now my identity is defined by who Christ is and who I am in him in and no say it again tell your neighbor neighbor my identity is defined by who Christ is and who I am in him that's why these messages are so important he showing us who he is and then he says Who We Are the question is can you take him at his word watch the words watch this you know Satan always uses those demons they always use sat second person you are worthless I have have an identity and you're trying to give me an an identity of worthlessness come on Church you got to fight fight the good fight these are demonic thoughts that come to every one of us every day oh you're a failure anybody ever deal with that demon demon of failure has no identity so he's trying to give you the identity of being a failure that don't pertain to me sorry well you got what you deserve why don't you shut up oh you will never change anybody deal with that I know you deal with that we all deal with these things you're a hopeless cause trying to push an identity on you oh you're disgusting we deal with all these you're not a real Christian let me see let me see anybody ever had that demon come across giv you that identity you're not a see your hands come on yeah okay all right okay God is sure sick of you and if people knew really knew who you are they'd hate you you're probably going to hell that's in that those are real those are real thoughts you should just kill yourself he tries to get us and the only Power that Satan has is the mind but if we can stop him at the mind he has no power over us you're worthless no you are oh come on now Church you got to make sure you got to act like you believe it come on now you're disgust no you're disgusting who do you think you're talking to I have identity and my identity is in Christ and Christ already defeated you hallu jerk jerk don't be afraid to talk to them oh I heard a I heard a a noise and and a voice told me how does he get to us he first attacks our our view of who God is that's right that's where he starts watch so many people's idea of God I don't want to do anything wrong if I do he send me to hell wow I didn't know we served a god like that serve a god like that that is just looking to see where we make a mistakes we can send us to hell I was saved restored I was justified stifi fil with the Holy Ghost I was glorified before the foundation of the world he already saw the end he already made a way why would I think he sent me to hell because I made a mistake Wonder Jesus said thou stupid and dumb Spirit come out of that I'm afraid he's going to punish me if I do come on for better than that if we make a mistake we have an advocate hallelujah hallelujah watch this now and so our view of God is distorted and we serve God out of fear rather than love if our view of God is distorted then our view of Christ is distorted our view of Christ is distorted then our view of ourselves is distorted the same way that Satan tries to trick and attack us the same way that he attacked Jesus attacked his identity if thou be the Son of God Jesus never said let me prove to you that I'm the son of come on Church come on he'll attack your identity if thou be the Son of God Jesus never even had to respond to him like he didn't say well let me prove it to you the father had already spoken right before when he was baptized the father said this is my beloved Son who I am pleased with him the father had already given him his identity and yet he wants to come and challenge the identity church he already gave us our identity and it wasn't based upon whether we would make mistakes or not he knew we would repent if we didn't make mistake watch this now this is my beloved Son I don't know what time I started but who cares because because this is this is going to get some good stuff we're barely getting going right his identity was not up for discussion and I'm here to tell you today that our identity is not not up for discussion come on I want to say that again our identity is not up for discussion I don't have to prove nothing to the devil Christ already proved it ah watch this now how many of you want to know your identity okay 1 John 3 1 and 2 this is how we find our identity is in the scriptures somebody told me I was a Son of God no no no go back to the scriptures find it there and then go forward behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God sons of God do we have here all right therefore the world knoweth us not I want an identity that everybody knows therefore the world knoweth us not Mark Chavez Mark Chavez who's that the world don't know us because it knew him not either beloved now tomorrow yesterday beloved now are we the sons of God that's our identity and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is that's why the greatest show of power on this Earth what's the greatest show of power in this earth praying and seeking and doing this and the dead rais the greatest show of power is when a son finds his position to them gave he power to become sons of God I just love that now it is our identity and Jesus knew that his identity was with the father and so what did he do he surrendered amen it's the hardest thing for us today surrender to him because when you do you got your identity oh no I'm going to do all this and I'm going to do all that and I'm going to do this wrong have dreams have Ambitions but more than that are you with me they your neighbor neighbor it's good to see you today we're getting to know we're getting we're making sure that we know who we are because when that bride recognizes who she is and what she is not just who she is but what she is she will be an invincible Army Hallelujah anybody part of that church all right that's why he said not my will but thy be done Church before Jesus performed a miracle before he cast out demons the father was already pleased with him I've got to do this and I got to do that no before Jesus did any of that the father was already pleased this is my son it's who we are in him watch this now that's why why do we think that he'll accept us if we do more for him he'll accept us if we pray and we cast out devils and we do these signs shall follow them that believe it's not because you do this or that it's because you have an identity we're getting to something so good here anybody needs to stand up and stretch a little bit okay all right I want you focused for this as we're coming around the corner the first corner of the Four Corners okay yeah we're coming around here our identity is steadfast our identity is sure it's secure our identity is is eternal Jesus said my sheep hear my voice they identify him he identifies them Thou Art the Christ Thou Art Peter Iden come on now come on now he's identifying watch your now my she hear my voice they can hear it they know what the voice of the shepherd is and they know when it's not him [Applause] oh uhoh I want to take you to a dream I appreciate sister Tabitha for sharing this dream with me I want you to listen closely to this this is so tremendous she said and sister Tabitha if I say something that's out that's not right just let me know okay but to the best of my my understanding he said she was in bed and she in in this dream I believe she she heard some preaching going on and she's thinking maybe Mark couldn't brother Mark her husband couldn't sleep maybe he's got a message going he went over to look and brother Mark was asleep she said but but right next to the bed she saw Pastor Caleb standing on the side of the bed over him he was preaching she said it looked just like you wh watch my sheep hear my voice it looked just like you she says but the preaching style was different all points matter it wasn't exactly like yours something was different about you but I couldn't put my finger on it she says she said then you started to say identity isn't important people are being misled because they're putting too much focus on identity said then you turn to look at me and you said for example the next time you do a Christmas play you don't have to put so much emphasis on who Mary was there's too much emphasis on the identity that it takes away from the word word she said okay I'm sorry but at this time she said I realized what was different you always have so much love she says even when you're correcting us there's love there but this person lacked love when he spoke it came to my mind the time that Jesus sent his disciples out says how will the people know who we are what the identity here he answered them by the love you have one for another then about that I thought about Mary a virgin who conceived that was part of her identity her identity is what helped fulfill scripture he continued just focusing on the word identity is not important watch a Believer now even when you're asleep whether you're in a vision the the The Valor the courage that comes forth she look looked up and said you're wrong it's all important people's identity is part of the word say I began to rebuke him and told him he needed to leave and as he began to walk out of my bedroom into the hallway he said I thought of my boys who were in the bedrooms right outside of ours and I said and don't you even think about bothering those boys because you know whose blood covers them and it don't it doesn't only cover them it flows inside of them so you know better said he turned back around and it was no longer in the form of brother Caleb he had been unmasked by this time he looked like a pale blond haired in Angel and he said this is your final warning right away right oh my gosh he's giving me a an ultimatum shush you don't give me final warnings God does with me as he sees please I told him you tried to come with at me as my pastor and now you're trying to come as a different Angel she said then suddenly I I stood up lifted my hands and began to sing Holy he is holy king of kings Lord of lords he is Holy she said and then I encourage enaged him to sing along with me Hallelujah I like [Applause] that and he told me I was making a big mistake but every try time he tried to talk I would say he is holy king of kings Lord of lords he is Holy he said this is your last opportunity you're going to regret it if you don't listen to me she said I walked right up to him and I I began to sing contined singing you're not holy you're not holy you're not the King of Kings not the Lord of lords not holy he says and at that time said I rebuke you and at that same moment the facade that the angel had began to fade away he said fine you want to see my form and he began to grow tall I could hear his his head graze against the ceiling his skin was like a rocer but I refused to look at him I thought it was strange that he didn't say do you want to know who I really am or do you want to know my identity he didn't say that he just said do you want to see my form looking aside I see he's such a farce I said I know who you are you're an enemy that has already been defeated oh my Lord come on church if we could learn to talk and to stand up for what's right what chance would all of Hell have against us you're already defeated at that point I woke up I wondered why I had sang those songs and I figured probably because it talks about the identity of Christ Lord of lords you are worthy You Are Holy it makes so much sense now Church there was a scripture that I always thought of and and I I I didn't really have a grasp of what this scripture was saying but I get it now when Paul in the book of Galatians chap 1 verse 8 says but though we are an angel from heaven Heaven preach any other gospel unto you than what we have preached unto you let him be a curse I said it makes sense now did Paul think that one day he was gonna gonna preach something different come on Church Paul wasn't thinking that did he think that one day maybe maybe he would lose his mind and and preach something different because he said if we are an angel from heaven oh no he didn't think that but he knew that those Fallen Angels try to even use his identity I'm going to say it again he knew that those Fallen Angels would to take his identity to deceive the people but my sheep hear my voice and a stranger voice they will not follow that's why you need a pastor to hear that voice it's not the man it's the voice behind the voice speaking to you giving you your identity let him be a cursed right you say is that possible brother Jesus said in Matthew 24 many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ let him be a cursed is it possible that he could take on a form sure isn't that what happened to Luther when San came to him as Jesus saying worship me he looked at him something was off oh oh you have a crown on your head and Jesus has not been crowned yet for the Saints shall Crown she he had found his identity in the word when you find your identity in the word there no devil that can deceive you they're trying to deceive you they're trying to give you another identity they're trying to say oh look what you did you're a drunk you're a drug addict you're he's trying to give you an identity another identity I'm telling you this morning give it back to him I'm going to say it again give it back to him that's not our identity now we are the sons of God right now we are the sons of God and for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whoever is born of God can even commit sin for his seed remaineth in him he cannot sin because he is born of God it's all about identity it's so important that brother Bram preaches so many messages identified with Christ go listen to these messages five identifications of the True Church of the Living God identification identific God is identified by his character istics God is God identifying himself by his characteristics the identified Christ of all ages the identification of Christ in all ages Christ is identified the same in all generations the identified Masterpiece of God don't ever let the devil tell you that identity is not important everything who we are and what hangs on it now notice this now can I have just a little bit more time there there there's there's another part that I want to get to so good wait a minute wait a minute I'm GNA do an uncle on here woo those grapes are pretty good I just crossed over and got some big old grapes but I'm going to need some help big old grapes across help me out here this morning take some of these grapes the scripture tells us that the two Spirits would be so close in the last days that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible but it's not then the only way to tell the difference is to identify them by the characteristics the prophet balam was fundamental but the prophet Moses was identified I'm going to say it again the prophet balam was fundamental fundamentally Moab and Israel the same but the prophet Moses was Iden by the characteristics of God fundamentally all churches seem to be oh relatively the same but the Church of the Living God is known by the characteristics of God because she has an identity the other ones have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof how are these he was identified by the characteristics of God there was the pillar of fire they had in their camp superal light hanging over them there was great healings in their Camp Supernatural God staying with the word that was given to Abraham the promise that he would have a son but now Moses and Abraham's promise they were going to the promised land B also a prophet of the Lord standing down there but the only way you could identify was by those characteristics but watch now the shout of the King was in their Camp okay okay everybody comes to church they clap their hands raise their hands say Amen all the churches are full today and all these things going on fundamentally the same even in the same local congregation about the same every now and then this one's a little Louder Than This One fundamentally the same fundamentally but in one Camp there's a shout of the King come on now come on come on this is your Camp the angel of the Lord encamps this is your camp in some camps there shout of the king inside I don't come waiting to hear the shout of the King he's already shouted in here watch what he says here the atonement was in effect the brass serpent the SP Rock God identifying himself by his characteristics and he identified himself with Moses God's characteristics are not natural we can all pray some pray in the spirit and some pray in the in the flesh God's characteristic is Supernatural because he's the Creator and when he begins to display itself it's so unusual to the modern thinking that throws them offline they cannot understand it yet he never gets away from his promise he's allotted it to every age watch how brother brandham then explains John 1412 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than the shall he do because I go unto my father watch his explanation of this in other words he that believeth on me shall be identified by my characteristics The Works watch how brother brandham explains Hebrew one God who had Sun Times and different manners spake in times passed unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son now watch him say this is the way the scripture should read God in sunnd Times by the prophets he identified himself and in this last days he has identified himself through the son what think you of Christ he's making Hebrews 138 the same he the same that's that word he's the same yesterday today forever he same yes amen or is he different come on church is he different brother Bram says he's the same in every detail except this morning he's wearing a blue suit he's wearing a black suit today but it's the same he is the same church he does not change only his mask or only where he has incarnated into church I wish I could I wish I had so much time to get into this but I have to skip some of this because I'm coming to this part you wear clothes that are immoral why you say well you can't say that that person is immoral I can judge no one he says but by their fruits they're known they may not actually commit the crime but on them is a spirit that's driving them to immoral IM immorality we are identified by the spirit that anoints us blah blah blah blah you know did you know you already know that phrase did you know stop it I don't want to hear it you know the devil's coming did you know never mind mind I'm not even going to get into my the rest of my message the deception Len closely I'm GNA come this and then I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hit this and then I'm going to go to that this last part okay we're winding down now we as Believers we can identify the written word right see wow glor hallelu sh oo wow we can identify this sure we can even identify the prophet that he sent brought the word and revealing Christ but why is it that we have such a hard time identifying what the message has produced wow we don't have a hard time recognizing what the message says brother says this says that we don't have a hard time at recognizing that but when that message produces we have a hard time with that we want more Revelation but we're afraid of manifestation oh Church come on I'm going to say it again we we want more Revelation but we're afraid of manifestation did you see what brother brandham says he said this and this yes I do I see it I have seen the identification of it that word is identified in his people what are we looking for this is the time Church no other age no other time has the sons of God ever been manifested of this time right now this is the full complete manifestation of the word why do we struggle with that know who you are nothing against the these this brother so I'm not saying it I'm like cuz you don't know who it is but they were laughing about some movie and man can you believe it they did this in this movie and this and it was rather vulgar and I had to say something and I said what I can't believe is that a Christian would be watching those things that's what I don't understand the filth that we watch and we we we channel in that's what I don't get how can a minister of the Gospel be watching those things how can people in the congregation be watching those things come on now somebody's deceived you about your identity I say that to help why there's so many things that we we we don't discern how many of you like listening to music no you're not truthful I'm gonna ask you again how many of you like listening to music okay why do you listen to music I I I had a conversation and and I won't go into the full conversation but a wonderful conversation with a brother why do you listen to music and what kind of music do you listen to uh I like this genre and got their their time their kind or style why do you listen ah you know get home from work and just want to relax down whatever you do whatever you do what you do I don't know only you know what you do you do what you do but I ask the question this who lives in your heart who supposed to live in your heart come on come on you that like to crank it in your vehicles forgive me I shouldn't have done that but you know what I mean some like to crank it up right oh come on you no if you want help the first thing you got to do is you got to be honest I mean like to crank it in their car brother peace out love you man yeah cuz we have those things in common but my question was this to the brother if your heart is the Throne of God and we are we're to be patterned after what Moses saw in heaven is that the kind of music that they have up there come on now do you listen to music for your enjoyment or do you listen to the music to create an atmosphere for the one that lives inside that'll make you think twice before you turn it on again but I tell you this because Christ must be identified in our homes in our job in our alone time in every aspect of our life we must we must know that his identity lives on in us the thief doesn't come but to kill to steal what is he stealing your identity they're going to destroy you take your identity he wants to kill and to destroy you but a man brother Bram says this but a man has got to be convinced first and the only convincing thing is manifestation wowow this Listen to listen with everything you got for the next 5 10 minutes this is where the message is hinged on now the only convincing thing is the manifestation now if in no other time for the sons of God to ever be made Manifest this is the only time that the children of God have their complete identity what a what a mouthful that one is in no other time did they have their complete identity except in the manifestation of the sons of God here the only convincing thing is the manifestation it says or the identity of the Gospel being identif ifed in you Jesus said these signs shall identify those who believe now we said everything we said for this right now okay I got attention now just just just a few minutes now watch and this is where it's all hang on hung on now phili 2 5 and six this is good and I and I wish I look at that I have more more and more and more and my Lord but we got to get this last part now are you ready let this mind which was also in Christ Jesus let this mind be in you right now watch now let this mind be in you which was also in Christ this is the mind of Christ what we read here is the mind of Christ when we hear the prophet speak it's the mind of Christ so watch now if this let's just say this is the mind of Christ we're put in as an example let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus we heard the other day as a man thinketh in his heart right let this mind be in you what did this mind think this is important now what did this mind of Christ thinky let's go to the next verse continue reading what did this mind think that was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God he said it's not robbery that I be equal with God so let that mind be in you so that you don't think it's robbery to be equal also oh no church if you don't get who you are what you are and what you're doing here Now's the Time to get this now mind be in you Church turn to your neighbor neighbor let this mind be in you tell you're the other side let this mind be in you who was in Christ Jesus he thought it not robbery equal with God don't think it's robbery equal church now now now I got to stop here because this blew me away and this this is the just of my message I don't know what just follow me right here and I get excited and sometimes you can't even understand what I'm saying go back and listen to it again him being in the form of God but it not robbery to be equal with God I began to hear the prophet speak God is identified the same in all generations so I'm taking the mind of Christ bring it to my generation come on come on church this is not something in the past this is not robbery be equal with God and he's identified in every generation even my generation your generation identifying himself right now watch what brother brandham says now he was the manifestation of God God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was expressing what the father was in himself he said I do always that which pleases the father and the I and the father are one the father dwells in me when you see me you've seen the father in other words he expressed God the spirit so much in in him he and the father it wasn't robbery for him to be the same person I'm going to say it again Hallelujah he said it's not robbery but show us the father if you've seen me you seen the father not robbery CU I and the father are one we are the same person all right now now now let this mind Jesus saying me and the father we're the same person that's why there's not three persons no such a thing that came from the pits of Hell father are one you've seen me youve seen the Father the same person come on now come on now now we put that point now we're coming to another one he was the Tabernacle of God he was the express image of God he was what God through his power projected a part a body which was called son because he was a man and he come from God and he was so committed to God till he didn't think it robbery him and God being the same person and they were because in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God they were the same Jesus didn't think it robbery he was the person now if we leave it there we miss the message why do you think it robbery to be equal with or the same person let this mind be in you let it be in you you're [Music] nothing you need to find out what your who your identity you got find that out when you do no devil in hell going to tell you anything different come on now I'm coming I'm coming around the corner a big long one but I'm I'm coming full steam ahead what mind do we think it's robbery to be the same he's the same in every detail except the little Corporal body then we are his body today Jesus said at that day day right now at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father and me I and you you and me there's God working through so when a person is so completely yielded to the Holy Spirit speaking it is not the person speaking anymore the Holy Ghost comes down and brother Noah he begins to speak it's not the person Noah anymore you know Noah but you just can't see Beyond the Veil but when the Holy Spirit comes down it's the Holy Spirit speaking now do you think it's robbery to be the same person oh church I'm trying to let you go but I can't I can't there's something pulling that there's pulling more come on now I I I got to get this across to you if he puts his word in a person then it's not the person anymore it's him you think it's robbery to be the same person if he puts his words in a person it's not the person anymore it's him it's there's no devil that should ever put you finger in your mouth anymore watch what he says he likened in many parables a husband and wife he called The Church bride and the bride is no longer and the bridegroom is no longer two people they are one we've heard that so many times but once again he'll think it not robbery to be the same person this is borderline right now right here Christ and Antichrist this is how close it is you go one way a little bit Antichrist you come this way a little bit you're exactly right not she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone man and woman it's called the mystical Body of Christ now the True Church of Jesus the bride is liken to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there's no fault in her she's glorious within and without am I talking to anybody here all right from beginning to end she is the work of her Lord all works are perfect in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can you fathom that accept it by faith now I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna finish with this now promise you I'm sorry I'm not sorry so I take that [Applause] back can any man this is a question can any man do the works of Christ unless he was Christ it's a question they asked brother brandham the man himself can't be Christ but the works of Christ will follow every believer he'll do the works of Christ in any man but he believes in me and has confessed by faith and died out to himself my spirit will dwell in him and he becomes a part of me then brother BR says now that don't make him Christ not one person by themselves it makes him part of Christ with the rest of the church all right he is not Christ because that would be Antichrist you see he would be taking away from Christ but he can do the works of Christ any believer okay now watch this question now then it comes down to a brother Bram brother brandham sister came Tabernacle she believes you are Jesus Christ incarnate brother Bram simply says the sister was wrong I am not Jesus Christ I am his servant I am not Jesus Christ I am his servant watch this you think it not robbery to be the same person oh not that person that lived 2,000 years ago watch as brother brandham answers this brother Bram they're saying that you're more than a man you can create Jesus can look just like brother brandham whoever it is I don't know said but I am your brother see Jesus is your savior I cannot be your savior he has already saved you see you're so close to being the truth there yet you're so far from the truth in One S sense of the word it's exactly the truth in other sense it is the Antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus be an antichrist for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high and will come again in great power and Glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him it's exactly the truth you become Christ if all that God was he pour it into Christ and Christ thought it not robbery the person of God and all that Christ was he poured into the church and she don't think it's robbery to be the same person or to be Christ because him and her are one and the same you become Christ so let this mind be in you where you think not robbery oh brother and sister you're going to say that I'm Jesus Christ oh that's error but to be Anointed with his Spirit brings his own person brings own person are you getting it if you say to be Anointed with his Spirit which brings his own purpose of his life into you oh it's still him but now he's using your Tabernacle don't think it robbery I'm telling you church as I brother will would you come to the piano or i w I won't stop because I can go on and on for a long time we need go to Africa amen don't tell me that the identified Christ of all ages hasn't been identified in our midst you can't tell me that tell somebody else that well we don't like this about your church I didn't ask you I'm not trying to be funny or trying to be bad or negative I didn't ask you what you thought all I know is one thing to me it's not robbery to be him I'm going to tell you why I say this I left church on Wednesday and as I was going home I get a call brother Loreno Garcia senior in the hospital he's bleeding from his brain they're G have to send him out somewhere I drive drove up to the hospital I didn't want to go into the hospital as brother Caleb I sat there in my truck and I said Lord it ain't robbery I'm going to say it again church it's not robbery I said Lord I put myself to one side not be me that walks into that hospital Let It Be You Lord the very life that was in you Lord is now in The Believer let us let me go in Lord let it be you not me there's his family it wasn't brother Caleb Christ not just in brother Caleb Christ in his family we got around him spoke the word brain you stop bleeding wherever the bleeding is Stop in the Name of Jesus Christ it is done you believe it he said yes I believe it I said then it stopped already they flew him out they got to to Al Paso started doing the tests Mr Garcia we don't know what happen we can't even find any bleeding we can't find nothing wrong Christ identified in this Our Generation as you stand to your feet alive he's real and he has identified himself by his characteristic thank you for being a wonderful audience how many of you believe he's here I've never been so sure in my life we're not guessing he is here we've seen the characteristics him identifying himself day after day after oh Church he's not just the god of the ministers he the god of the audience you have as much a right put into practice these characteristics you have every right stand on his word let him speak through you don't ever think it's robbery to be equal or the same as the person of [Music] Christ how many confess to be Believers today with every head bowed we believe in the resurrected Lord Jesus who is identifying himself right now Church you know we don't have to put it he's identified himself right now by the same characteristics as when he was on Earth he's the same church yesterday today and forever now in his divine presence of the resurrected ID identified Son of God who is made flesh among us again today in the flesh of his Believers I command every Spirit every unclean Spirit every sickness every disease to depart out of these people these are believers Satan this is God's Property she has been identified already she he has identified her that she is his bride we're not looking for that it's already here now if you can believe that his presence is here the presence of the resurrected Son of God of Christ yes you believe that then in Jesus name what you ask for raise your hands and this is between you and God now just let him move and say Lord I believe I believe with all my heart oh Lord I believe it with all my heart father as you begin to move around now this building oh father go into the depths of to the hearts oh Lord you that examine every heart father open up Lord open up the windows of Heaven open up Lord use that Spirit Lord open us up that blood cell to the individual Lord and let it be you father that begins to manifest yourself in these people oh Lord we need you more than ever we're thankful Lord for the

amen when start very good afternoon to all of you we're going to start the other [Applause] service the service of of saying goodbye wanted to let you know that this week I'm going back to my country a wonderful news that I'm totally healed of what I was suffering [Applause] with that's why Bo God allowed me to come to this land to prove that the god of healing is still as in the day that he started working upon the earth when I heard about the testimony today but the prayer that brother Caleb did for the brother that was affected prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today do not let your guard down lift up your faith without faith it is impossible to please God faith is revelation is not an emotion or thought it is the action of the word in you for you to say the name of the Lord and whatever you say that will come to pass people don't get to believe that that is true Everything you ask believing that you shall receive it that will be so but faith has a calendar the Lord knows in what month and what day he's going to give you the answer to your petition immediate things are a miracle the things that you hope that you wait that is for Faith I want to thank God first for permitting me to be here to say goodbye to my friend brother Tommy and being here at the last moment of his that's a privilege that the lord gave me to be here with my friend until death there's many friends there's no like one friend there is just one friend but Jesus only had one friend because it's individual with each one of us it's individual the friendship with him I don't know if you're a friend of Jesus but I am his friend it is not Collective it is individual how do I know that I'm his friend the one that loveth me shall keep my word we are keepers of his word so I want to thank the Lord for the time that he had me here inica incedible if I 10 months here and I didn't even notice time goes by very fast the greatest thing is that I came in but I'm going back he when you meet with Jesus you cannot be the same something has to happen and I am a witness of the power of God my situation wasn't easy all hell is against me the years the tiredness and the old age problems everything is suming up at the end of the way but he is our victory I want to thank brother Caleb and his beloved family and all of you as a congregation for the kindness the human warm the marvelous time that you have given me during the days that I was able to be in contact with all of you and for 10 months to be a believer in what a privilege it is not being here at the pulpit but the greatest here you serve it but you eat it over there that's a wonderful thing I want to thank and my my family my wife they thank you I want to thank my sonin-law and my daughter how they took care of us me and my wife they said this is your house the only thing it is that they didn't give me the keys but they said it is their house but they said make yourself thank you brother jul sister and their girls their boys she was nursing me and I was the guinea p pig but it was a very good experiment brother J thank you so much to your family the the kindness your your friendship that brought healing to my body too I had never believed what the prophet had said God heals with a visit you can preach it but as long as you don't live it you cannot be a witness of the reality of what it is the name of the Lord I me comp my comrade Abraham the last in the congregation but the first of the elders keep that Jewel that is there that is there with him back him up and give him thanks to the Lord that that the Lord raised up that wonderful family to be the representatives of God for this congregation our brother is listening to me and and his beloved wife that is with him I want to thank him for his attentions and his Ben benevolence I want to recognize and acknowledge the work of my son Henry I know that because of his job was absent from this place in some times but he knows that his home isn't here that brother Caleb is his pastor and that I am his dad as as a married man you know that you have a dad too and when you get older you become a son and then a dad the first thing that that that was called him now you are the one that is calleded that your children scold you now does it feel don't eat this take care of this the law of of prohibiting things when you get to be old you're going to remember of this also I want to thank my son Fabi Moes that is in colia he was very attentive of my uh state of health made the effort to come here and he took the good news to the people in Colombia which I am responsible of my wife as well wants to thank all of you for your kind invitations and that human warmth that you have in here to make us feel at home thank you very much we want to thank each one of you for that and to finish I want to tell you that I'm gonna miss you so much there had been a long time ago that hadn't been a sheep before being a sheep is very tremendous because if a sheep gets sick the pastor gets sick too and it it doesn't get healed until they see the sheep that is healed even though they don't complain they take the pain and the distress of your needs when you're a pastor you're going to remember this old man uh the the the the youth you have the most beautiful generation which is the final generation it is up to very few Believers and a lot of unbelievers that's what the prophet said there's few that are believers but many the unbelievers how many believers do we have here now how many live in this city and that the Lord has taken out out I believe that there's still going to be more because we still have because the as long as the Lord with Jesus we have the the right amount of seed as long as the last one comes in and we all leave this is not far away this is closer than what we think so don't let the cares of this world to kick you out and that you can you can enjoy as we enjoy this morning of a wonderful Supernatural sermon you cannot hear it everywhere it is a privilege to be in this place so to finish to close I want to thank you one more time what do I say to the Colombian people greetings 15 days you're going to know how many angels went with me on the way back to Colombia you can ask for as many angels as you need you have an angel next to you but the Lord allows you to ask for as many angels as you want
