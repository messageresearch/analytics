that i want to send to our brilliant who many times have stood with us in the gospel field my memory date back dates back right from 2017 when we for the first time had an encounter with the brethren from siddha hill's church of the cross las cruces neo mexico united states of america that was in may it was a team which was comprising of the church from cedar hills and i don't forget my brother tito from voice of truth tabernacle from then to this day we still have a lot more to keep pondering over what god has always been doing in this kind of unity that we developed many things have happened since then what we clearly know the translation work started the radio program started and much later when this incident of coronavirus also came you gave a lot of hands in terms of helping us this particular video clip is to make you realize one last thing that we have yet done which was yesterday we held a short meeting kind of a seminar in which they attracted over 200 people and all that came as a result of our announcement that we have always been running on the radio to have at least a day that we would meet it has been a very good meeting that we held yesterday in which we again baptized 13 more souls into the kingdom in the name of our lord jesus christ [Applause] [Applause] don't you hate your brother [Music] [Applause] amen [Music] [Music] down [Music] [Music] new house [Music] [Music] oh [Music] right [Applause] happy birthday and we just want to appreciate god for this another year added unto you we thank god for your ministry which has always encouraged us and builded us in being true servants of god we believe another year added unto you for revelation happy happy birthday amen amen god bless you would you stand to your feet and this opponent we're thankful for those those last three three uh young men that that uh that you saw they are the ones that are that are always printing every amen let's get right into the word if you would like your bibles be like jesus and as we continue this message remember the question that was asked last sunday are you jesus it is jesus amen let's continue with that thought and let's let's see where the lord has and has for us and where he's taking us hebrews 13 8 president when you have you can say amen here good to see each one of you bueno is those that we can't see and those that we can't the lord sees us all and it reads like this jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever are you glad once again that he is the same esta contentos where would we be if we had a ever-changing god lord help us may he add his blessings to the reading of his word and you may be seated once again as we had said last sunday we may quote many things that we were that we spoke about but we want to try to bring this in the simplest terms so that you can understand it they said find out what he was back then then the scripture says he's the same hey man so i'm going to say that again we know exactly who he was back then we'll know exactly who he is today remember jesus christ is the principal theme of the bible and we understand that the bible is the revelation of jesus christ and therefore every character that is mentioned in the bible amen everyone i'm going to say it again every character in the bible was typing christ and was pointing that christ was coming as we said some time ago the old testament that he's coming the new testament says he's here and we are certainly grateful to god now are we going to fully understand the mystery of his will what the mystery of god's will is in each one of our lives how will we ever understand that if we don't search the scriptures how many believe that the scriptures chose and it's got the answers to who you are how many really believe let me see your hands if you really believe this want to make sure that we're talking to believers this this morning amen now once again we want to know the mystery it's a mystery his will is in every one of our lives and every character in the bible and that's why it was he is known as the identified christ of all the ages once again i'm going to say it again he is the identified christ identification of all the ages i'm sure tonight brother branham says on the message identification identification that we ought to find ourselves somewhere amen amen he says so that we would know the k the outcome of that character that's why when you read the bible you you've got to it's got to be personal to you you got to find yourselves in some character of the bible he says and that way we know what the outcome was of that character and then he says he look what he's saying see what their outcome was i'll show you your outcome how god is so good and this is the revelation of jesus christ and once again he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah and all these characters these characteristics that they displayed we're finally bottled up into one person and that is our lord jesus christ for all that god was he poured it into christ and so we know then the next part of it is all that christ was he poured into the church once again in the message how the angel came to me brother branham saw jesus jesus he said there's not an artist in the world that could paint his picture he says much love and kindness my my i don't know about you but i i just i just can't get over how much i uh how much i fall in love with him more every day and the more i search the scriptures the more in love i am with him and after a while just let lord for me you gotta say lord for me is in your body and what a great plan that he has placed imagine then that the king of glory de la gloria would come down and put on flesh and blood veneers he said god compressing himself into his body letting man touch and feel the warmth of god himself who before had only we had only hurt him now [Music] prefers the unseen distant god we have difficulty with the god who is living in flesh difficulties how many know that's true today whenever they need him but one more time he is now approachable when he was not approachable no one could enter into the holy of holies we know the story of the little boy that that his parents says that you you know god god is with you don't be afraid to remember that story though and and he says yeah but but but i want a god that i can touch well i read one the other day that was similar it was a little girl and the moms went in there and the mom goes in and says jesus is here don't be afraid he said well then you stay here and stay with jesus and i'm going to jump in bed with dad why because it is the desire of a human being as much as as as when we look around to one another you can actually feel a hug right there are times that people that that people hug one another and they might do it out of courtesy you know how are you doing oh nice to see you there's nothing there but when you get somebody from the heart i can't say my brother i've missed you oh they just hug you and you can feel the warmth of the holy ghost that's what god wanted to do which was from the beginning which we have heard lokemos visto from the beginning we had heard him right which we have seen with our our eyes oh my just want to give you a hug right now gotta control got to control and our hands have handled of the word of life this is what [Music] i'm going to ask you a question have you verified that this morning well they were able to brother because they were with him 2000 years ago i'm here to tell you that members of his once again he is the same yesterday hey listen to me it seems so different than what the they have a hierarchy of ministers the more distant he becomes to the people that's why god never set up his church that way come on church man sets up the church that way oh they want a great pastor walks why do you think he's better than us or what no no that's not the way gods that's not the way he set up his church he set up his church to make sure that he was available hello everybody that's why we're available 24 hours a day i don't care if we have to go with kings we have been with kings i don't care if we have to go to the person on the street we'll go down is is and he touched the people allah i'm going to say it again the people touched him and he touched the people talking of the leper in matthew 83 you don't have to turn to it i'm just going to go down the list havelando de la proson matteo talking of these lepers jesus put forth his hand the bible says peter's mother-in-law las vegas pedro the bible says he touched her hand and the fever left her fievel i don't know but this is good stuff to me if this ever gets old to you you need to come back to the altar siesta and the same way that the woman with the issue of the blood touched him whole fuel perfectamente now if we are the body of christ that same nature be in us not the same characteristics these signs shall follow them do you think even when he's when he went down and he and he got that that muddy spit on that dirt and he created that eyeball what do you think the earth did when he pulled some of it oh i could just feel that the earth just shake and say oh he touched me in church we we we see the people and you see somebody maybe that becomes good friends with the pastor amigos all of a sudden they think that they're just somehow higher than somebody else i'm friends with the pastor amigo that's fine wonderful but do you have the same characteristics characteristics that don't make you better than anybody else hello we look at things backwards here's the god of glory oh my lord let's get into this watch this now touched humans humans by washing their feet my goodness yo smile you know in a church and only less the bigger a church gets the more schisms there are in the church i remember when we were just a few oh man we'd have such a good time starts becoming groupie and then all of a sudden there's more fights the church should be the place of where we can let down our hair like okay how many of you have ever gone to church and you come to the greeter la puerta but you and your husband or your wife whoever it is or your children you've been fighting all the way to church this is oh we're doing fine we're doing fine thank you yeah that ever happen to anybody yes okay shouldn't this be the place that you can actually come in and say no i'm not very good that's why i'm here why has the body of christ why is it the sickest body because we have not discerned the body we don't know who's god don't want you like that if you're mad god wants you mad somehow we think that because we're christians we shouldn't ever get mad we shouldn't get upset we think that we should and we come to church my name is put notes don't get me wrong you can keep putting notes like this i have an unspoken prayer request god knows my secretary that's okay when the body of christ is here i'm not saying you need to tell them everything that's going on in your life let me tell you sit down for a while i mean you're going to be there for a while what am i getting at this we've told people things and they've gone and gone to tell everybody else for doing that and that's why this is a sick body but we need healing in here this morning because the body needs to be healed follow me this morning stick to me to be like jesus somebody want to be like him this is where the world has gone off my goodness how many are still with me this morning juantos is 115. just real quick who is the image of the invisible god philippians 5. and let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus jesus who being in the form of god let me see your hands if you want that mind yeah i want to make sure that you're that you're following me the mind where we don't think it robbery could be equal with god amen but made himself of no reputation born in a manger nacion to a a woman that claimed that she was pregnant not knowing no man kind of hard to believe her es duro claire doesn't seem like the grand entrance the messiah was supposed to have no pares and then he calls a bunch of disciples some who don't even know how to sign their name surrounded himself with men like that made himself of no reputation but he took upon him the form of a servant here's where we get into the message he took on himself upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men oh we're going to get to something good in after a while on this one he made himself and was made in the likeness of men in the song okay we got to get all these little pieces in the puzzle together or what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh i didn't have that one under okay i'm sorry romans 8 3 i'll read it in english for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh amen wait a minute especially okay we love to repeat in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt amongst and wait a minute wait a minute but the flesh when the word became flesh it was in the likeness of sinful flesh oh my oh the word became flesh in the likeness of sinful flesh he came in the likeness of men for men um i gotta hold on to these things now god said let us make man in our image after our likeness here he comes aquivene jesus god and flesh in the form of god in the form of but changes his form to that of a servant and that is made into the likeness of men yesterday is now [Music] wait a minute it's the image of the invisible god is now in the form of a servant what kind of reputation is that hebrews 4 15. what was in this is the last part of the verse but was in all points tempted some of the points in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin tempted in every way that you and i are those he totally became [Music] sorry but i'm just enjoying myself this morning i'm going to stop again like jesus jesus in the form of a servant watch him now this gets gooder and gooder as we go on yes he threw it off everyone else but even to a point that john the baptist had seen the dove come down and already said this is the lamb of god how do you make that declaration i know lord you're with me jose senor questions on me but as soon as times get a little rough i don't know if he's with me that's right are you are you with me lord estas conveyors can you give me a sign we're nothing but a bunch of sign seekers that's okay because it's no more just the sign so much it's the voice behind the side the sign can only point you in a direction but when he that is in you speaks what does it do it shows you yeah i pray this is this is helping you how many how many is it helping you it threw everybody off not only that no solo eso how is his followers supposed to tell somebody else who do you follow i can't see us too um follow a servant not me i follow the king of kings that's where a lot of people are today i follow the king of kings i never have learned how do you tell somebody that come to church leslie i'm going to show you who i serve the greatest servant that you've ever seen what do you mean jesus yes see wow what a servant guess the other one have you ever had that conversation with somebody the greatest servant in this world jesus christ my lord and savior not in this time no neces tiempo most people wouldn't take that la people wouldn't want that and most people are too embarrassed to say that yes his ways are past finding out his ways are so much higher than ours there was no other way to redeem man than to become one of them but let me tell you about this great servant he was born without normal conceptions in physics in physical he disprove the law of gravity ascended into heaven in economics he disproves the law of diminishing returns by feeding 5 000 men with two fishes and five loaves of bread in medicine in the medicinal he cured the sick and the blind without administering a single dose of drugs in history and historia here's the beginning in government he said he shall be called wonderful he said no one comes to the father except through me he came in the form of a servant yet his followers called him masters he had no degree yet they called him a teacher he had no medicines yes they called him a healer he had no armies yeah rulers feared him he won no military battles yet he conquered the whole world he committed no crime yet they crucified him he was buried in a tomb yet he lives today he demolished every status quo and i am honored to have and serve is such a leader leader this is where the church needs to get back to but jesus called unto him to them called them to him and said unto them ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles they exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them that's us the gentiles mentality who's the greatest amongst us same conversation that the disciples had conversations who's the greatest in the kingdom he took me up mount transfiguration oh no i turned on and my goodness but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you antes the minister was going to be the great one amongst us no no that's not what it's saying no it's whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and a minister there minister is diaconos one who attends oh now we're getting into what we're supposed to be take off turn around and throw them away we'll attend somebody for 10 minutes and i know yeah that's the easy way out i'm not helping them because they don't listen you want to kill yourself christ never did that to you nor did he do it to me when we didn't listen how many of you got it all at once but yeah i got it i acted right from the beginning don't even raise your hands 44 and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be the servant of all oh you know what a servant is there a slave as a bond man oh now we're getting to be like jesus huh for even the son of man oh wait till i get into this for even the son of man that's office of of a prophet even the son of man came not to be ministered unto no inaudible i am come down from heaven come and serve me i'm over here even the son of man came not to be ministered but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many yeah you still want to be like jesus jesus i want to be like him one that attends wait a minute the son of man elijah came to fulfill the offices of his church this iglesia you'll know why i said that in a moment he didn't come for somebody to serve him no binoculars come on church i'm going to say that again we are servants then and our job is to try to make somebody else life a little bit better it is to free them especially so that they can be everything that they are called to be using because a servant's first interest el interest is not himself it is others i could just stop right here and just let that one just sink in so and they came to jesus jesus and john's disciples asked him he said are you uh are you he that was going to come or do we look for another when they came to jesus jesus jesus never said of course i'm the one tell that wasn't jesus's response i like to let those things just soak inside it's got you gotta get this church there is no rapture if we're not like him that's right not we can be like a church member the church is full of grandchildren but in the midst of all that there are many children he said no you go tell john simple as this you go no no no don't go tell him go show him go show john of those things show him again those things which you do here de las cosas you tell him to do this that the blind receive their sight losing how could the blind receive their sights if they didn't have a someone that was serving this if you look at a real minister is this a few hundred minutes how much time is that put in there serving the people how many hours of prayer you tell him that the blind receive their sight losing the lame also have a friend the lame also have a servant you tell him that the lame walk tell him that the lepers are cleansed and the death here it's very hard to be a servant because it how many of you have something against somebody wrong question i want to see how many want deliverance today from that come on whether you're online and it doesn't matter how many can raise your hand if you say i've got i've i've got some thing against somebody what's the point or somebody has something against you if you know somebody has something against you that gets me off the hook how many want to overcome that i'm going to give you the key today okay who wants a key point i'm going to tell you what to do are you ready now my question is how many of you will really do it you want to make it home do it you don't no it's up to you is invite that person to your house get a bucket of water and humble yourself you meet me you say you'll break that spirit just like that yes but you think people today will humble themselves to that i'm not the one that's wrong they're the one that's wrong you know somebody has ought against there is a god how many want to be the servant of all patos am i heading home this morning let's go on i got it i still got a little bit of time and humility is seeing ourselves as we really are did you get that real humility is to see yourself like you really are [Music] it is knowing who we are and owning it is it is living without hypocrisy we might act one way however when we get around people oh yeah look at this look at the brothers i want all these little points church i want you to just go over it over and over again say lord lord help me to be like jesus listen to this it is living without hypocrisy it is walking in the light is not afraid of no dark spots of your life nothing is being a open book only all to see one of the most loving things that i can do for someone is to be honest about myself how many times after you've talked to somebody or somebody's talked to you does one say i wonder what they meant by that i wonder what they're really up to they were really nice to me that way what is it you're having to sift through deception sir walter when we when first we fashion to deceive when by my incongruency i give people wrong signals they respond accordingly and wrongly to me and then i respond wrongly to their wrong response and on and off the circle continues until a war is started and no one remembers how the feud began it began when we first tried to deceive somebody of who we really were that's why jesus made himself of no reputation and being found in fashion as a man because you see humility is not thinking less of yourself because you're too busy thinking about someone else now we're getting into the mind frame of a servant peter 5 5 tells us in humility why has humility been lost in the church because the gentiles are always trying to exercise lordship over someone that's how many right of the lord do we have here you got to balance the word brother brother brother diego preached the other day he no but that don't take away that we're still his servants he just doesn't call us that no no no come on you got to balance the word we must continue as servants with all humility serving the people god has a ministry today you're still in the ministerial is he not still serving the people that's right watch this now pikachu when they said brother branham and they said mano branham that's that sister said is in the message be not afraid he says christ died to save every lost person no matter what creed has done for them that's always tried to be my approach what an example i'm just a public servant of god to you and the preacher is a public servant publicly that can help the people we are a publix we are public servants this is why satan is against every true minister of god as i was reading the message taking sides with jesus brother branham starts off saying have you noticed what satan has tried to do in the last few days to the ministers that's associated he said it's satan trying to get rid of us and even in our midst i find satan trying to get rid of us in one way or another that's right he's tried to kill some by car accidents he's tried to kill some by sickness he's trying to destroy the physical body of some el cuerpo de algunos he's tried to discourage others by using their children he's trying to discourage others by using their spouse discourage others by their finances he's trying to kill but i want every deacon every minister would you stand to your feet today and i want you people to understand that these people these men those that help the usher stand to your feet yes sirs [Music] that help you then they serve the people they worry about brother brown's telling you this and we're seeing it happen in our own myths trying to bring some sickness he'll do what he can to get to you he'll use your family's church he'll use whoever he can i can say the closest one to you but i want to repeat what brother branham he said i want to encourage each one of you ministers be courageous no matter what comes up what takes place just don't let nothing beset you no thank you my brothers gracious how many are going to pray even more not just the one man up here there's a ministry there many times even helped keep my arms up came here is but he came in the form of a sermon how i look at that and i say lord i have a lot to i got a lot to grow in you mean to be a good servant but that's not good enough i want to be a better servant for the rest of this year for the beginning of next year for as long as god would have me here i want to make sure i'm approachable touchable who can we henceforth i don't call you servants no more but friends amigos why because you're doing the same thing i'm doing that you know why we're his friend because he looks us and says now you understand me a little bit amigos and i'm just going to go down this list romans 1 1. paul the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ and christopher which are at the servant of jesus christ revelations do you notice they're all one one see because you can't go to the rest of the chapter lest you cross the servanthood the revelation signified it unto his servant john juan revelations 19 10. to worship him see thou do it the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy jesus again brother branham says that you're jesus christ incarnate was wrong jesus christ search just give me like 10 minutes okay just like about 10 minutes i'm sorry i guess i just maybe i ought to just preach like 45 minutes huh just drop it and go in one and there's a man there's men that go into those offices there's a balance to these things we'll get into those we've gotten to those but we'll get into a little later why did the church world put him out of their churches because they were not trained into in the word to know him and without the mind of christ you can't believe every word and having his mind is to know his will it is the mind of the anointed one which is christ and if that anointing only anoints your spirit you'll never be like jesus jesus if it only anoints your flesh you won't be like jesus but if that anointing goes down and over shadows the germ of life in your soul will produce christ in you and that's why that's why brother branham says this is you can have the holy ghost 24 hours you'll go to hell but don't lose sight that you are a servant of jesus christ that he uses for the benefit of the people how can people ever say that they are christians and deny the supernatural christians the whole ministry is the supernatural because each one when they got a swallow of that supernatural manner he become a priest or as soon as he become a priest because the ministry is the foreknowledge my lord i pray that you get this this morning once again there's were so many people well i don't need a ministry i got the messenger and the message how can you claim to have the message and deny what the message has produced and if you watch this in the seven seal how many times it explodes come on now how many brother jim that's right somebody that reads it explodes three times explode every generation that comes after an explosion that produces that explosion and this is where many people failing to understand yeah let me tell you something and don't you ever forget this the anointing doesn't just fall from heaven some pentecostal idea oh the anointing is going to come down and it will annoy me elohim not the way that god made his church they said no no he said he was like cannot get he poured out his spirit upon all flesh but it's the same as when he waters the weeds praise the lord just like the crop they all thank god for the water they're not all wheat and that's where people fail to realize you want the anointing from god every preacher out there has an anointing but i'm not talking about that anointing i'm talking about christ the anointing oil that goes down from the top of their head to the soles of our feet and is bringing the congregation into this priesthood but not by putting men above there even though there are offices in the church many understand that but watch that anointing how it comes forth they stay on that for a while when the prophet of the age put forth a message the supernatural the anointing elohim the mind of god i was once delivered to the state exploded a couple minutes and then you can go to the piano i just want to stop with this because i never finished in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god remember some years ago brother tommy jr preached a message tremendous message the holy spirit brought through him and he preached on this he said you notice how most people jump from verse 1 to verse 14. he said but no one ever goes to or very very rarely do they go to to verse 2. and the word became flesh oh we go all the way over there i don't know whether to preach this or just or just let it just permeate the same was in the beginning el mismo estaba real quick genesis 1 26 says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness image and likeness is the shape or resemblance so the image is the representative figure and the likeness is what's fashioned or shaped in the similitude of that image similar brother branham could jesus look like you and the man around his head i read this or you be jesus something like that in one sense of the word that's exactly the truth another sense of the word it's an antichrist the difference between right and wrong if you try to make me the person of the lord jesus you're making me an antichrist but because that person is a person of the lord jesus that's sitting at the right hand of the hand of the majesty but for his life are you jesus it is jesus how many can answer that question this morning are you jesus it is jesus and you stop for a moment and you see genesis 1 27. first he says let us make man in our image after our likeness verse 27 gives you the answer you put it up there genesis 1 27. so god created man in his image there he goes in the image of god created he him now after what does he do male and female created he theme what's that likeness now i'm finishing brother will come on up what is that likeness then watch the female part he is where were you beforehand where were you before they he laid the foundations of the world fundamental where were where what you and i church we came here and that's it there's a watch how he flips it around the only way to save you and i okay calm down from glory gloria and he became the likeness of man the principles and brother branham he's speaking about one like the son of man oh yes but you get this last part but i want you to stop here for a moment projecting the image to the map this is why many people don't understand the ministry of the son of man because they see the light and what it's projecting to a man if in the ministry of the son of man not the and that's why many will put everything oh the bride has it all and over here all brother branham has it look you're you're breaking up the pictures forgive me for taking so long i'm sorry i just love his word and i am a super lover i don't want us to miss it if you didn't understand just get the tape and hear it if you again don't understand it call me uh i'll explain to you oh you're gonna miss i should be a little more calm and maybe just talk these things there's just something in my heart that stirs and that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities no brother branham was not the son of man he was a son of man prophecy that was revealing the son of man jesus christ now we get everything in the word put it we put it all in order when the very image was being displayed in the scriptures and you'll know who i am where i am sitting on his throne saying
