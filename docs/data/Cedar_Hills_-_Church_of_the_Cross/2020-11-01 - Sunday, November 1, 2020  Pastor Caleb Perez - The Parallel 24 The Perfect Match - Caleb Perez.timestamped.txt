[1:07:43] word how many have been excited to get
[1:07:45] into the word
[1:07:47] always have a good time right getting
[1:07:49] into the word
[1:07:52] so now i see where what time it is and
[1:07:54] then let's let's let's go and see as far
[1:07:56] as long as the holy spirit would lead us
[1:07:58] to go
[1:08:01] and uh once again it's uh the parallel
[1:08:04] number 24.
[1:08:07] and with the subtitle the perfect match
[1:08:12] and you tell your neighbor that the
[1:08:14] perfect match
[1:08:16] amen
[1:08:17] perfect match
[1:08:19] amen isaiah 28 verse 8 and then verse
[1:08:23] when you have it you can say amen
[1:08:35] and it reads like this for all the
[1:08:37] tables are full of vomit and filthiness
[1:08:41] so that there is no place clean
[1:08:49] or
[1:08:50] precept must must be upon precept
[1:08:57] should be
[1:08:58] not maybe no
[1:09:00] precept
[1:09:01] must be upon precept
[1:09:16] here a little
[1:09:17] and they're a little
[1:09:32] the whole nation
[1:09:34] is on pins and needles
[1:09:39] yes or yes coc yeah everywhere you turn
[1:09:42] around
[1:09:43] not only with the rising number of cases
[1:09:45] of this virus
[1:09:50] but waiting to see
[1:09:52] who will be elected
[1:09:57] and determining who's elected
[1:10:01] i do
[1:10:02] i can say i predict one thing
[1:10:06] who's going to win queen bagan no no we
[1:10:08] already know who who who who has won
[1:10:11] already yes i am
[1:10:13] but i do predict this recipe one thing's
[1:10:16] for sure
[1:10:18] half the country will be partying the
[1:10:20] next day
[1:10:23] because they're candidate one
[1:10:26] and the other half will be mad as heck
[1:10:36] trying to figure out how to
[1:10:38] throw the winner out
[1:10:39] of house
[1:10:42] lines
[1:10:42] will be formed for voting
[1:10:46] as lines have been have been drawn in
[1:10:49] the sand
[1:10:53] and each one
[1:10:55] taking their sides
[1:10:58] and as we look at this even though each
[1:11:00] person
[1:11:02] may not be in total agreement with their
[1:11:04] candidate
[1:11:08] they chose the one that they feel stands
[1:11:10] for the closest to the way that they
[1:11:13] think
[1:11:18] i'm going to say it again
[1:11:19] they choose the one
[1:11:22] that is the closest to the way that they
[1:11:24] think it is
[1:11:27] the one that they feel is
[1:11:29] the closest match
[1:11:31] to them
[1:11:36] the one that is the closest to
[1:11:38] their own ideologies
[1:11:42] that's who they vote for
[1:11:45] we hear things like
[1:11:47] our country's future is on the line
[1:11:52] or this country is about to be changed
[1:11:54] forever
[1:11:57] my question is where have they been
[1:12:02] we have had a prophet
[1:12:04] that has foretold this years ago
[1:12:09] but they rejected the message
[1:12:12] and by doing so they rejected the holy
[1:12:15] ghost
[1:12:18] but today there is a people
[1:12:34] when we voted for jesus
[1:12:37] you see there's a big difference in why
[1:12:39] we voted for jesus
[1:12:43] we didn't vote because his word or his
[1:12:46] teachings was the closest to our
[1:12:48] ideologies or our thinking
[1:12:53] no that's not why we voted for jesus
[1:12:58] but we voted because
[1:13:00] his word
[1:13:01] his thoughts
[1:13:03] his thinking is superior to ours
[1:13:10] we voted for him because
[1:13:12] that is the mind
[1:13:13] we want to put on
[1:13:17] it was never about
[1:13:19] what i think and how close we can get to
[1:13:22] what god's word says
[1:13:26] it's about the perfect match
[1:13:30] it's about
[1:13:43] because the word never came out of us
[1:13:47] this morning
[1:13:48] we came out of the word
[1:13:50] in the beginning was the word
[1:13:53] the word was with god
[1:13:55] the word was god
[1:13:57] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[1:13:59] amongst it
[1:14:01] we are what came forth from that great
[1:14:03] logo
[1:14:06] therefore when we find our way
[1:14:09] by the grace of god
[1:14:12] we have found
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:39] we needed a
[1:14:40] guide we needed a leader a leader we
[1:14:43] needed a teacher
[1:14:45] we needed a comforter
[1:14:49] we needed a priest
[1:14:51] and he was the answer and is the answer
[1:14:54] to all our needs
[1:15:09] say it again he has never made a promise
[1:15:11] that he cannot and will not keep
[1:15:15] completely that's why brother branham
[1:15:17] says what is this
[1:15:19] when god heals
[1:15:20] he doesn't heal to show his power
[1:15:27] hey man he is perfect and his word is
[1:15:30] true
[1:15:33] as human beings we we need to know that
[1:15:35] we belong somewhere come on
[1:16:04] every morning
[1:16:17] because i found the part that was
[1:16:20] missing here
[1:16:23] as we get into this word and find we're
[1:16:25] looking at as we talk about the perfect
[1:16:27] match
[1:16:30] it might get a little rough okay
[1:16:34] but but but look at what i'm trying to
[1:16:36] what the holy spirit is trying to
[1:16:37] accomplish
[1:16:41] you might say well brother i don't see
[1:16:42] that or i don't agree with that that's
[1:16:43] okay he says
[1:16:45] but know that what i'm telling you is
[1:16:47] the truth
[1:16:49] the rest is up to you
[1:16:52] would you turn in your bibles now once
[1:16:53] again to philippians the fourth chapter
[1:16:55] and the 19th verse
[1:17:00] forgive me but i'm a little bit
[1:17:02] struggling this morning up here
[1:17:05] i finally uncle on i finally went to the
[1:17:07] next step of my life
[1:17:14] i didn't want to go bifocals
[1:17:18] so i went to
[1:17:20] progressives if we
[1:17:22] let this progress
[1:17:23] because they don't have lines
[1:17:26] i can't see worth a
[1:17:28] darn so i'm got these glasses on and
[1:17:32] penguins are okay but if i raise my head
[1:17:34] too much
[1:17:36] but they're good to read though
[1:17:38] so pray for me this morning
[1:17:41] looking out there and the ground is
[1:17:42] going like this
[1:17:45] i don't know if i should have worn these
[1:17:47] or not but i got to get used to them
[1:17:50] amen philippians 4 19 reads like this
[1:17:54] but my god
[1:17:56] shall supply all your need
[1:17:58] according to his riches in glory
[1:18:01] by christ jesus
[1:18:08] in gloria and christoph jesus how many
[1:18:10] times have we read this
[1:18:12] is
[1:18:13] esto
[1:18:15] many many times
[1:18:17] i have read it many times how many times
[1:18:19] have we sang this
[1:18:22] okay can you sing along with me this
[1:18:24] morning
[1:18:39] but right now how many can sing with me
[1:18:43] my god shall supply all my
[1:18:47] can you can you stop and sing it again
[1:18:50] my god shells
[1:18:55] according to his riches in glory
[1:18:59] and i i want you to i want to stop there
[1:19:03] how many are needy today
[1:19:06] see
[1:19:09] if i were to ask you to write down all
[1:19:11] your needs
[1:19:14] necessity how many needs do you think
[1:19:16] you might have quantized
[1:19:18] answers to yourself
[1:19:29] and are all your needs
[1:19:32] are they all needs
[1:19:44] think about it how many really how many
[1:19:45] needs do you really have
[1:19:49] maybe you can list your needs and by the
[1:19:51] end of the week maybe some of those
[1:19:52] needs might have been answered
[1:19:57] but at the beginning of next week you'll
[1:19:59] have another list of needs
[1:20:04] and yes physically we we do there are
[1:20:06] things that we do need
[1:20:09] we need air
[1:20:12] we need water next time
[1:20:14] we need food
[1:20:16] we need all those things to survive
[1:20:20] we even need companionship
[1:20:24] there are many people that even die of
[1:20:26] loneliness
[1:20:29] so we pray lord i need this and i need
[1:20:31] that neces
[1:20:33] but you ever come to a place where you
[1:20:35] feel like it's
[1:20:36] a lot of it is just vain repetition i
[1:20:39] don't know
[1:20:40] am i talking to us
[1:20:44] it seems like we pray the same prayer
[1:20:47] i think we're all guilty in one form or
[1:20:49] another
[1:20:51] and we pray and we pray about the same
[1:20:52] thing lord i need this and lord i need
[1:20:54] that
[1:20:56] after a while you wonder if the lord
[1:20:59] really hears those vain repetitions
[1:21:01] especially
[1:21:05] matthew chapter 6
[1:21:08] hold on to that to what i just read
[1:21:11] back to that philippians
[1:21:14] but when you pray this is verse seven
[1:21:16] per society and when you pray use not
[1:21:18] vain repetitions
[1:21:23] how many here use vain repetition
[1:21:27] okay
[1:21:28] we got a few people that are that are
[1:21:30] honest
[1:21:32] don't use vain repetition as the heathen
[1:21:34] do for they think that they shall be
[1:21:36] heard for their much speaking como los
[1:21:38] gentiles que pies
[1:21:43] ye therefore like unto them for your
[1:21:45] father knoweth what things you have need
[1:21:48] of
[1:21:49] before you even ask of him
[1:21:51] what is
[1:21:56] okay how many have a need
[1:21:57] for food
[1:22:00] you need to how many have need water
[1:22:04] everybody has these needs right
[1:22:07] now verse 31 tells us though
[1:22:10] therefore
[1:22:11] take no thought
[1:22:15] okay
[1:22:16] we repeat prayers over and over
[1:22:19] lord i need this and lord i need that
[1:22:20] and lord i need it and the bible is
[1:22:22] telling us
[1:22:24] don't even take a thought about it
[1:22:28] why do we think so much about that
[1:22:31] why do we pray so much about those
[1:22:33] things
[1:22:35] take no thought saying what shall we eat
[1:22:37] or what shall we drink or where will
[1:22:39] shall we be clothed
[1:22:45] take no thought about it no penn says i
[1:22:47] want everybody to repeat after me this
[1:22:49] morning take no
[1:22:50] thought take note that that means don't
[1:22:52] think about it right
[1:22:55] it's so easy just to say it and don't
[1:22:57] think about it
[1:22:59] after all these things do the gentiles
[1:23:02] seek
[1:23:04] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[1:23:06] have need of all these things
[1:23:13] but the answer comes when he says but
[1:23:15] seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:23:18] and his righteousness and all these
[1:23:21] things shall be added unto you
[1:23:29] therefore take no thought for the moral
[1:23:31] for the morrow shall take thought for
[1:23:33] the things of itself
[1:23:39] so the holy spirit comes to be back
[1:23:41] again and he tells me this
[1:23:44] read philippians once again
[1:23:48] i go back and it says
[1:23:50] but my god and then he says stop he says
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:55] watch the messenger of the first church
[1:23:58] age
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:27] because they didn't know who that god
[1:24:29] was
[1:24:31] but he says my god
[1:24:34] watch how important that is
[1:24:38] he's declaring unto him to them
[1:24:42] who this unknown god is
[1:24:45] now with that in mind
[1:24:47] he's declaring it
[1:24:50] and when he is declared unto you
[1:24:53] you know that god
[1:24:56] that is
[1:25:09] shall supply i like this now
[1:25:15] my god shall supply
[1:25:17] all your need
[1:25:20] i want you to stop here for a moment
[1:25:24] because we're
[1:25:36] notice what the scripture says
[1:26:04] that's the need to know where we were
[1:26:07] connected from the beginning
[1:26:11] the need to be connected
[1:26:15] the need to find
[1:26:16] our perfect match
[1:26:20] we cannot function
[1:26:29] our god is the fountain of all that we
[1:26:31] have need of no estradiol
[1:26:35] jesus christ is saying
[1:26:38] speak first the kingdom of god and his
[1:26:39] righteousness
[1:26:41] and all these other things will be added
[1:26:44] to you
[1:26:46] why because when you find him
[1:26:57] and now you can tell somebody else
[1:27:02] shall supply
[1:27:15] i think it goes very well with what
[1:27:16] we're speaking about this morning
[1:27:20] when god wanted to create fishes
[1:27:27] somebody help me out they're going to
[1:27:29] play i'm going to create
[1:27:33] who is he going to talk to who's he
[1:27:34] going to speak to him
[1:27:39] he spoke
[1:27:40] to the waters
[1:27:43] yes sir yes
[1:27:45] don't know maybe you're not with me this
[1:27:47] is
[1:27:48] i'm going to say it again god wanted to
[1:27:50] create fish
[1:27:53] so where did he or who did he speak to
[1:27:55] or what did he speak to look at
[1:27:57] the bible says that he spoke to the
[1:27:59] waters
[1:28:01] and he said let the waters
[1:28:03] amen yes or yes coc
[1:28:07] when god wanted to create trees
[1:28:11] what did he speak to aquila blonde
[1:28:19] but when god wanted to create man
[1:28:23] he spoke to himself
[1:28:26] and what was
[1:28:59] therefore if you take the fish out of
[1:29:01] the water
[1:29:04] it dies
[1:29:05] yes sir yes coc
[1:29:08] the earth then
[1:29:10] has everything that the tree would ever
[1:29:12] need
[1:29:15] and if you take the tree out of the
[1:29:17] earth
[1:29:19] what happens to the tree
[1:29:22] the tree dies
[1:29:24] that's right
[1:29:26] so it is with man
[1:29:29] god has everything that the man needs to
[1:29:32] live
[1:29:35] and when man disconnects himself from
[1:29:37] god
[1:29:40] he also will die
[1:29:42] so remember though
[1:29:44] that the water without the fish
[1:29:48] continues being water continuous
[1:29:51] but the fish without the water is
[1:29:53] nothing
[1:29:57] the earth without the tree continues
[1:29:59] being the earth
[1:30:02] but the tree without the earth is
[1:30:27] it's about finding the side from where
[1:30:30] you were formed or taken from
[1:31:14] here a little and they're a little aki
[1:31:16] toyo for with stammering lips and
[1:31:18] another tongue will he speak to this
[1:31:20] people
[1:31:25] i want you to notice this now
[1:31:29] upon line lineage
[1:31:31] precept upon precepts
[1:31:34] it's a recipe here
[1:31:36] this morning it's a recipe
[1:31:40] and after he says line must be upon line
[1:31:42] and precept upon precepts
[1:31:47] he says
[1:31:48] this is
[1:31:50] the rest
[1:31:53] it's that simple
[1:31:56] this is the rest
[1:31:58] if you don't have rest in your life you
[1:32:00] know
[1:32:01] somewhere
[1:32:02] line is not upon line linea
[1:32:05] somewhere precept is not upon precept
[1:32:09] and he's telling us this is the rest
[1:32:13] wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest
[1:32:19] and line upon line illinois
[1:32:23] this is
[1:32:27] refrigerator i feel so dry mesenter i
[1:32:30] don't feel refreshed at all
[1:32:33] is not upon line
[1:32:35] we're getting into this this morning how
[1:32:36] many are following me this morning
[1:32:52] or your life parallels perfectly
[1:32:56] esteem parallel perfect with the line of
[1:32:58] the word
[1:33:00] the word that you were taken from es la
[1:33:02] palabra
[1:33:03] tomato this is the reason that many are
[1:33:05] not at rest est
[1:33:18] and they leave out the parts that are
[1:33:20] too hard
[1:33:23] hearts they don't want to live
[1:33:26] mine is not upon line
[1:33:29] there is no rest
[1:33:30] there is no refreshing no i refrigerator
[1:33:32] now what notice how how the scripture
[1:33:34] then reads commodities
[1:33:37] must be upon precept
[1:33:40] the precept
[1:33:43] is the commandment
[1:33:47] law must be upon law lay there
[1:33:50] must be upon commandment
[1:33:53] and line is
[1:33:55] it's used for measuring the bible says
[1:33:59] it's
[1:34:00] a chord or a string
[1:34:11] the precept once again is the law or
[1:34:13] commandment
[1:34:15] and that was israel's rest
[1:34:18] of israel how many know that
[1:34:21] got to know these things
[1:34:23] once again that was israel's rest
[1:34:27] gave them the law
[1:34:29] and in that law they this yeah
[1:34:33] did it according to what the law had
[1:34:34] said
[1:34:36] they found rest there for their soul and
[1:34:39] control
[1:34:40] but the line then
[1:34:43] precept must be upon priesthood
[1:34:53] and that line
[1:34:55] it does something
[1:34:56] that nothing else could do in yeah
[1:35:00] it magnifies the law magnifica
[1:35:03] now watch
[1:35:04] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:35:06] forever
[1:35:09] the full revelation of god
[1:35:12] god ever
[1:35:26] was
[1:35:36] shall be guilty of
[1:35:40] death they said i've never committed
[1:35:43] adultery
[1:35:45] and then he says
[1:35:47] magnify it magnification now if you look
[1:35:50] at a woman to lust after her sistem
[1:35:53] you've already committed adultery
[1:35:56] watch he never took away the law
[1:35:59] because precept must be upon priests
[1:36:03] but what he did he magnified it
[1:36:06] now he's saying okay you say that's the
[1:36:08] old testament
[1:36:10] but it's a parallel within you
[1:36:14] doesn't do away with you
[1:36:17] magnifies the word that was in seed form
[1:36:22] and now it brings it to its
[1:36:23] manifestation
[1:36:25] manifestation watch this how many are
[1:36:27] with me
[1:36:30] remember the sabbath day keep it holy
[1:37:05] why many people think that they speak in
[1:37:07] tongues they got the holy ghost
[1:37:10] that don't mean that yes
[1:37:13] the holy ghost does and will cause some
[1:37:15] to speak in tongues
[1:37:18] but until
[1:37:32] looks back there and doesn't agree with
[1:37:35] the rest of the words
[1:37:38] then it's a wrong spirit somewhere
[1:37:41] it's got to come from the inside
[1:37:44] which is the word
[1:37:46] from the
[1:37:59] you started back there as a seed
[1:38:04] say it again
[1:38:05] you started back there as a seed
[1:38:10] that's why we read it last time
[1:38:13] says
[1:38:59] how is that possible
[1:39:01] how can you disagree with any part of it
[1:39:03] and claim to be part of the word
[1:39:07] that is the rest the refreshing
[1:39:10] refrigerator
[1:39:24] that's the third rest
[1:39:27] but he helped me out on this sunday
[1:39:29] school morning
[1:39:31] what the first rest was
[1:39:39] there was three major arrests in the
[1:39:40] bible right
[1:39:43] the first one
[1:39:47] god that's right
[1:39:48] on the seventh day what did he do
[1:39:53] the second rest
[1:39:55] what
[1:40:04] nobody i just said it a while ago a
[1:40:06] penalty
[1:40:33] but many people don't understand because
[1:40:34] they want to make
[1:40:46] christ is the anointed word of the hour
[1:41:02] i want this to to really hit home
[1:41:05] where we rest upon the full word of god
[1:41:09] when i read line upon line i i i think
[1:41:12] about two lines
[1:41:16] two lines those lineas and uh two lines
[1:41:19] run in parallel
[1:41:23] i see
[1:41:24] what i think of
[1:41:25] i don't know you a lot of things to
[1:41:27] think of
[1:41:30] i also think of a book
[1:41:33] and each sentence is a line
[1:41:36] together line upon line
[1:41:39] they tell a story
[1:41:42] and as they tell a story
[1:41:50] the more the books developed
[1:41:53] we'll get into that in a moment
[1:41:56] now notice this now because this is why
[1:41:58] it's so tremendous
[1:42:02] brother says in the message unbelief
[1:42:04] does not hinder god
[1:42:07] it says in the last days
[1:42:10] what it's going to take to stand
[1:42:22] is a scriptural trained church
[1:42:30] i know everything brother branham says
[1:42:31] joseph
[1:42:33] and you should
[1:42:35] but everything he said proved that the
[1:42:37] bible was true
[1:42:43] hello everybody
[1:42:45] i'm going to say it again everything he
[1:42:46] said proves
[1:42:48] that the bible is the word of god
[1:42:52] that the bible is
[1:43:08] now we can see we don't want to go off
[1:43:10] on preaching but but we get excited
[1:43:13] sometimes
[1:43:15] that's the only way to stand is a
[1:43:17] scriptural trained shirt
[1:43:21] he says on the line and linea for
[1:43:24] there's going to be incarnal pers
[1:43:26] impersonations rise
[1:43:29] in personification we realize that we
[1:43:31] are in the last days
[1:43:34] anything can look so real
[1:43:38] why is that the truth
[1:43:40] anything can look real nowadays
[1:43:43] but yet if it's off the scripture
[1:43:47] leave it alone
[1:43:49] i don't care who said it i don't care
[1:43:52] what pastor que pastor i don't care what
[1:43:55] pulper priest okay
[1:43:57] or bishop oh cardinal if it's off the
[1:43:59] scripture you leave it alone
[1:44:03] watch this now unbelief doesn't destroy
[1:44:05] god including that no destruction it
[1:44:07] doesn't destroy his plan no that's true
[1:44:09] is the plan it doesn't destroy his works
[1:44:12] no there's three
[1:44:13] it only destroys the unbeliever
[1:44:16] now watch as we look and find that
[1:44:18] perfect match that we're talking about
[1:44:23] would you put that up there parallel as
[1:44:25] an adjective parallelo
[1:44:28] as an adjective just look at all the all
[1:44:30] those words there
[1:44:32] is
[1:45:16] resemble
[1:45:18] similar estimate to bear resemblance
[1:45:21] equivalent
[1:45:23] imitation
[1:45:24] echo remind record be in harmony with
[1:45:28] coincide
[1:45:30] now watch this the word parallel is
[1:45:32] synonymous then with the word match as
[1:45:34] we've seen
[1:45:37] and line must be upon line
[1:45:41] that's why god matched as we said the
[1:45:43] fish with the seas
[1:45:46] he matched the tree with the earth
[1:45:49] and he matched the man with himself
[1:45:53] and then he took the woman from the side
[1:45:56] of the man
[1:46:24] when they pierce
[1:46:53] chris had also a body
[1:46:57] body on earth today is his bride
[1:47:00] where did he come from
[1:47:02] he came from his side
[1:47:05] yes him hey i said bone of his
[1:47:15] because she's the perfect match with him
[1:47:19] now watch this now thank you
[1:47:22] everything
[1:47:24] was a perfect match
[1:47:27] everything lined up
[1:47:30] but when eve got away from the mold
[1:47:58] i'm going to say it again she got out
[1:48:00] from behind her head
[1:48:57] four walls
[1:49:13] what a condition huh a condition nothing
[1:49:16] matched not uh
[1:49:18] it was all
[1:49:20] it was all in
[1:49:22] in ruins
[1:49:25] when we look at this pando mira
[1:49:27] the reason there's so many problems in
[1:49:29] the marriage
[1:49:32] this line is not upon line
[1:49:37] hello everybody hold on put on your seat
[1:49:39] belts a little bit we're gonna go for a
[1:49:40] ride
[1:49:54] and i see people they just can't make it
[1:49:58] they can't get it together no please why
[1:50:01] line is not upon line
[1:50:04] it doesn't match
[1:50:06] something's wrong something's off
[1:50:07] sometimes
[1:50:12] and when line is not upon line there is
[1:50:14] no rest
[1:50:17] or refreshing
[1:50:19] in that
[1:50:22] relationship that's the resting place
[1:50:25] this is
[1:50:26] that's the place of refreshing
[1:50:28] precept is upon precept and line is upon
[1:50:31] us
[1:50:33] notice in the message he must be born
[1:50:35] again
[1:50:54] she puts her print on him
[1:51:01] this is the word
[1:51:04] another woman there would marr it
[1:51:07] forever

[1:58:54] protestants are striving for it now
[1:58:58] they're gaining ground in
[1:59:02] is the very attitude that was seen in
[1:59:03] the united nations organization
[1:59:09] when the world leaders refused to
[1:59:11] recognize any one individual concept of
[1:59:14] spiritual worship
[1:59:21] but they but they agreed upon or
[1:59:24] recommended
[1:59:26] put in all these concepts
[1:59:29] with hopes that the religions become
[1:59:32] leveled into one especially
[1:59:38] was there ever an age like this 20th
[1:59:40] century

[1:59:57] and it's an anti-god spirit
[2:00:01] where all men are supposedly equal
[2:00:06] in theory
[2:00:08] this is the age of political parties
[2:00:13] call themselves
[2:00:14] christian democrats
[2:00:16] christians democrats christian
[2:00:18] socialists christians
[2:00:20] christian commonwealth federations oh
[2:00:23] they're coming well
[2:00:40] and thus we ought to do so today
[2:00:43] isn't that what they're trying to turn
[2:00:45] the country too
[2:00:49] turn it into a socialist country
[2:00:52] show me any socialist country that has
[2:00:54] ever flourished
[2:00:58] according to marx's theory
[2:01:02] of socialism el socialism is a
[2:01:04] transitional social state
[2:01:33] everywhere all those
[2:02:09] my goodness i want to read this article
[2:02:15] listen to this article
[2:02:36] but you think times have been good
[2:02:39] you ain't seen nothing yet either
[2:02:43] let's see
[2:02:44] let's let's pull back the curtain a
[2:02:46] little bit
[2:02:51] the u.n says
[2:02:54] the christian church
[2:02:56] is the enemy of human rights
[2:03:12] so that the world is not subject
[2:03:16] to christian doctrines
[2:03:19] they cannot impose their spiritual laws
[2:03:25] in their id 2020 project
[2:03:29] they say that it is it is it is
[2:03:31] mandatory
[2:03:34] to corner christians
[2:03:37] and divide their beliefs and faith
[2:03:41] that they cannot win more lives for
[2:03:43] their christian doctrine
[2:03:47] they are trying to take away the power
[2:03:49] from the church
[2:03:51] because christians they say
[2:03:54] commit crimes against gender equality
[2:04:01] by prohibiting their human rights
[2:04:05] that we are as christians are enemies of
[2:04:07] humanity
[2:04:22] under a new world order
[2:04:27] christians are an obstacle
[2:04:32] and an opposition to the excellent work
[2:04:34] of the un for gender ideology you know
[2:04:38] positions
[2:04:42] it used to be man and woman
[2:04:45] now supposedly there are over a hundred
[2:04:49] gender types now our
[2:05:04] what's the difference between israel and
[2:05:06] the gentiles he's in israel
[2:05:09] israel was blinded
[2:05:13] that right
[2:05:14] amen
[2:05:16] they didn't do it willfully god did it
[2:05:29] i want you to really get this because
[2:05:30] this this really hits home
[2:05:34] the growth of christianity in the world
[2:05:36] is a threat
[2:05:39] we must neutralize religious groups for
[2:05:41] their campaigns against our gender
[2:05:43] ideology
[2:05:46] is
[2:06:15] i'm not going to tell you yes or no
[2:06:17] but i will tell you this
[2:06:19] everything you do
[2:06:22] whether it's eating your food yes
[2:06:24] drinking a drink
[2:06:25] or taking shots oh you make sure that
[2:06:28] you pray about it
[2:06:30] i will tell you that
[2:06:32] that's your choice of what you want to
[2:06:33] do
[2:06:34] but pray about things
[2:06:36] don't just take it all the doctor told
[2:06:38] me
[2:06:41] i don't take away that prayer
[2:07:10] through vaccinations
[2:07:17] there's a lot of things that it says but
[2:07:18] i want you to i want to get to this
[2:07:22] the u.n reiterates
[2:07:50] we will be able to implement abortion
[2:07:53] implemented
[2:07:55] neutralize the global growth of humanity
[2:07:59] global through homosexualism and
[2:08:01] lesbianism
[2:08:05] make sure that people understand
[2:08:08] we don't hate we're not against
[2:08:10] homosexuals or lesbians
[2:08:12] god doesn't hate the homosexual or the
[2:08:14] lesbian
[2:08:16] but he hates the act of it you know that
[2:08:19] he loves the soul girls i'm
[2:08:36] watch this we will vaccinate our
[2:08:38] children and adolescents
[2:08:41] so that only ten percent of children are
[2:08:43] born
[2:08:46] for an equitable reduction
[2:09:17] and and 1.5 billion homosexuals
[2:09:20] homosexuals so that we can prove prevent
[2:09:23] the birth
[2:09:25] of five billion children
[2:09:28] and lead to the death
[2:09:30] girls
[2:09:43] we will apply the full weight of
[2:09:45] humanistic laws
[2:09:50] no wonder the world is in such a
[2:09:51] condition
[2:09:54] nothing matches anymore
[2:09:57] i'm going to turn the corner now
[2:10:00] can i have like 10 15 minutes
[2:10:03] no wonder the world is in such a
[2:10:05] condition
[2:10:06] once again nothing matches anymore
[2:10:10] but we can make sure that we are in line
[2:10:26] line up with the bible
[2:10:40] with the scripture teachings
[2:10:45] instead of man's theology
[2:10:49] the quicker you'll find the resurrected
[2:10:52] christ
[2:10:54] church you're
[2:11:08] but i will tell
[2:11:35] he didn't want to line up with god
[2:11:39] nor with god's prophet
[2:11:43] sounds like a lot of people today
[2:11:47] watch this now he could say people say
[2:11:49] we'll line up with the bible
[2:12:08] did i miss something somewhere
[2:12:12] i'll line up with the pastor but not the
[2:12:14] brother
[2:12:18] sorry but line is not upon line
[2:12:22] he's a part of that mystical body of
[2:12:24] christ
[2:12:26] that makes him part of the word
[2:12:30] then how can i deny him
[2:12:46] because
[2:13:15] the reason this needs to be taught
[2:13:21] it is somewhere
[2:13:24] [Music]
[2:13:25] the church
[2:13:27] lining up like
[2:13:43] la nova traffic mini skirts
[2:13:48] this is supposed to be the bride of
[2:13:49] christ

[2:13:56] he said but

[2:15:41] mystery
[2:15:44] there's a match to it
[2:15:48] to this
[2:16:34] watch this now brother caleb don't save
[2:16:36] nobody
[2:16:38] we have one savior that's jesus christ

[2:17:38] the arrow of god's deliverance
[2:17:43] he said i want my experience to match
[2:17:46] god's bible
[2:17:50] that's the match in time
[2:17:54] if you want
[2:18:05] that's good stuff
[2:18:08] brother brown says
[2:18:10] will paul have to give an account for
[2:18:12] his people
[2:18:14] yeah see
[2:18:16] praise god
[2:18:19] because i preached what paul preached
[2:18:24] what is it church yes
[2:18:26] it's the mystical body of christ
[2:18:29] being formed
[2:18:30] for line upon lines

[2:18:35] of faith
[2:18:35] [Applause]
[2:18:50] come on church and then it came the next
[2:18:52] one you know we don't have to eat and

[2:22:04] iglesias singapore new women
[2:22:09] and stuff like the rest of the woman of
[2:22:11] the world
[2:22:14] that nearly killed me
[2:22:16] when i walked in here the other day
[2:22:20] there's only one woman in the bible that
[2:22:22] ever painted her face
[2:22:25] that's what he says
[2:22:26] you don't paint your face to meet god
[2:22:30] you paint your face to meet men
[2:22:34] you ever heard anybody say oh i gotta go
[2:22:36] i'm about to pray so i gotta go put on
[2:22:37] some some stuff on my face i'm about to

[2:22:49] hello everybody
[2:22:52] oh that one hit a sour note
[2:22:56] i think i better stop right there
[2:22:57] because that's like whoa
[2:23:03] watch now watch how the holy spirit
[2:23:05] through the prophet begins to shoot the
[2:23:07] arrow of deliverance
[2:23:11] and he focuses on the leadership
[2:23:15] the king joe ash is in
[2:23:24] how many lukewarm borderline preachers
[2:23:27] do we have
[2:23:37] whatever the congregation wants that's
[2:23:39] the way the preacher preaches
[2:23:42] not here
[2:23:45] that they don't want me no more here
[2:23:46] they can say ah we don't want you no
[2:23:48] more here
[2:23:50] i will meet everyone on the day of
[2:23:52] judgement
[2:23:56] it was not my feelings my emotions i
[2:23:58] just i didn't want to be mean to people
[2:24:02] but how else do you get the people's
[2:24:04] attention
[2:24:09] only one church
[2:24:11] that'll be ready for a wrap
[2:24:25] oh my lord
[2:24:27] backslidden preachers
[2:24:31] that's what they do today
[2:24:33] but a god-sent holy ghost-born preacher
[2:24:38] compromised with any congregation
[2:24:50] but today it looks like the world
[2:25:01] making a little more money
[2:25:03] and it just made
[2:25:04] a sap out of you yes
[2:25:23] have they have not gone to the potter's

[2:26:53] nobody could stop them
[2:26:55] but we lost our first love as we heard
