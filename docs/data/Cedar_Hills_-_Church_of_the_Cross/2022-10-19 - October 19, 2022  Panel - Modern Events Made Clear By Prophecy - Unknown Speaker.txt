the traditions this fine evening all right turn around and greet your brothers amen we want you to feel relaxed here tonight what you'll be able to get into God's word but where we could you know get to it but to understand it imagine I we're going to talk about the cup of the amorites a couple of the Gentiles and the cup of iniquity amen amen let's start and approach the author of this was gracious Heavenly Father Lord Celestial Senor or truly it's a privileged Lord that you've given us Lord you just come and Lord dig into your word find out where it puts us today lord it's not us but we know it's you tonight and your word is as much alive today as it was 2 000 years ago Lord we rely on you tonight take over and just bless your people tonight in your precious name we asked amen amen let's read the scripture let's turn to the Book of Revelations verse 4 foreign and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls have them golden having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornications amen you may be seated amen we have a lot of scriptures I don't want you standing um Danny so much let us turn to the Book of Matthew chapter 24 verse 12. and it reads like this and because iniquity shall bound the love of many shall wax hold it but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved messages and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations then shall the End come is when ye therefore shall see the Abominations of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand in Tienda amen so if we could just try it all starts with the cup of the amorites and I know brother Abram's going to touch more on that is but we want to paint a picture tonight because God came to Abraham and he tells Abraham in four generations the people will be in bondage and he says but the cup of iniquity is not yet full he said I've given you this place but don't think about that right now that's not coming for four generations he says but when that cup is full then I'm gonna come and he says don't you worry about those amorites I'm going to take care of them so that's the picture we we want to to paint today but what if we change just one word just so we could better understand it of the Gentiles is not yet foreign we see vemos how God is telling Abram about but we want to look at the cup of the Gentiles so we could see what pertains to us as if we see and we say that the cup of the Gentiles is not yet full because but when it's full then there's an exit that's coming right that's why that's why we hear that that's why we come to preach the gospel we want to we want to be taken away right he's telling us don't worry that's not for you to worry about it because when the cup of the Gentiles is full foreign [Music] where does the Gentiles start what's the difference between the Gentiles and the and the Jews give us a little bit of influence but we want to be able to ask you questions so yeah it's ready for us so when you start to when I you start to think of the Gentiles and discussions and the Jews us as as Believers we always um we know we're Gentiles we understand that the Jews were were the Gods chosen people when I started to look at this I started to to kind of dig a little bit of who who the where the Gentiles came from yeah through my study I started to dig a little bit when through the through the scriptures through the scriptures as you start to see where the Gentiles began of course this is you know after the flood you know but through the word of God you start to to narrow it down uh [Music] and for Carlo so you you find that that there was just one race you know this is the name of it was it was the family of man yeah and it stayed that way until the promise that that God gave to Abraham so where you start to see this is as it is so let's let's just read it real quick so Genesis 12 verse 1 it says now the Lord had said unto Abraham yet thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy Father's House onto a land that I will show thee and this is and I will make thee a great nation foreign well um where he was I believe it was the the Amorite located but what else as I started as I I wanted to provide to see that picture yes so as you start to see like um that's the promise that we're talking about you know if you follow the the lineage of Abraham you began to understand like understand where Abraham who his father was and where what was going on in the land during that time so we we all should know who Nimrod was right he was he was the king of Babylonia he was the one who built the Tower of Babel well and Abraham's father is um he was he was the chief general of his army and so Tara was uh he he worshiped idols and this is where Abraham came from yeah so when you see that you understand more that when Abraham was was how God called Abraham out of that because God couldn't deal with Abraham in a place like that foreign okay so um we knowing that his father worshiped idols [Music] so there was times in in Abraham's Youth of the end his father would leave him there to to tend to the store selling idols and you just love the part to see how that seed that was inside of Abraham Lincoln is he refused to to do that he would break the idols and he would tell the people that were there to buy the idols how wrong it was this is Abraham in his youth okay it's just you know dude it was all always there like yeah you have to understand who Abraham was in the Bible we find that every promise that God gave to Abraham he believed it as it already was that's the the type of servant that Abraham was to God I say all of this for a reason because when you start to look at that you understand in the scriptures Abraham was referred to he was the first one that was referred to as Hebrew I say all of that about his Youth and everything because when Abraham came out he already knew God was going to bless him and he was going to raise a nation out of him God's word as if it was already when you see Abraham in the Hebrew language it means a crossover or to pass through significant so in chapter 14 Genesis is where he's referred to as a Hebrew the first one that was referred to that way and the reason why they referred to him as a Hebrew is because they already knew that Abraham was not like any other in the land yeah it was completely different so when they would refer to him they called him the Hebrews if you follow the lineage down from Abraham to Jesus Christ [Music] Jesus we know that out of Abraham came Isaac out of Isaac came Jacob and out of Jacob came Judah and out of Judah is where that was the lineage that God chose to to bring where Christ was to come foreign now Judah he they were the Hebrew that they took it to the next level and that's where the Jews were formed from foreign let me explain so when I say the next level they believed it so much that they identified themselves and this is where the Jews came from yeah they identified because they changed the definition of what the Hebrew was at this point is and they changed the Hebrew definition do they want it to be identified as that is the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob yeah the Gentiles you can say they were they were there before the Jews and out of the Jews out of the Gentiles came to Jews and everything that you look at Gentiles everything that you're gonna see is everything but a it's non-jew is that you look up the definition everybody else is Gentile and that's the segregation there that that's the difference between the Gentiles yes do you have any doubt good examples of what is where some of the Gentiles that the lineage came the um for the line that Jesus came from um David Navid David from David came Christ some good stuff though some that that we would never think okay oh yeah um there is a harlot that game um but you always put me on the spot like this but I I believe her name is Rahab the Harlot from that vintage as well salmon that's right yeah for a little more had spoken that before I mean to put him on the spot but it it is when we get into the lineage it is it is so amazing [Music] you know and if we have time for able get into a little he has a code just a little bit on the grafting but it is amazing because it makes it real to us you know you because many times we think that God is so far away and we're never going to reach him but when we look and we see foreign God used some of the most common ways the common people to show that there was Grace because we could always go back to the scriptures he came to his own and his own received them not you know but now that opened the door for us now there's hope for us because we look at this and we see you know many times we don't even we hear many times in church about the Gentiles but many of especially I I say young people but there's a lot of us that come to church here I really don't understand where the lineage came from and the difference between Jews and Gentiles so we wanted just to paint a picture a little bit of go back in time we're talking about this you know we have to get get all our bases down before we even get into it the other thing was with that that always got me was when you see the Jewish perspective on a gentile was was they were known as unclean they even called them dogs the uncircumcised considados they kind of really like really degraded the Gentiles um and and when you see Jesus like Jesus he could have had that attitude you know you find you find the woman at the well where she's like you have nothing to draw from this world if you only knew who you're talking to you well one time you just see it all over like how you're saying it how yet God in his foreign that God saw you and I because you know without him seeing us we don't have a chance if you know but but to see how you're saying no I I don't know if you ever studied this you know but uh did you know that Caleb wasn't considered uh he was actually a Gentiles and you see the mighty Caleb and Joshua Josue well they were a tribe that got put into to with the children of Israel I believe they're called the kennesite tribe was part of that tribe's father and so so when you see calebel his name was the faithful dog they there there is that thing that one thing that always stirred my heart is how we say no matter how low we can get no matter how unclean we feel Our Lives yeah God provides an exodus for each and everyone the most amazing part to me just that Jesus would go to a gentile speak to a gentana gentile say speak the word the words my mind so if we look from the other perspective now okay if this God is so great like you say that he he went out and found so then what what purpose would they need laws for you know so great he found this gentiles what happened that's where mercy and Grace comes I mean because by our own merits foreign all they did after you know but you know you see that when Jesus is is there with the Gentiles Jesus it blew me away how much he just loved and knew what his purpose was he could have said my life it's only for my people he knew that his life for a bigger Ministry what metal yeah what I was trying to trying to get out here is you know we see what the what the end result was with the Jews we talk about the Pharisees were more holier than Jesus Jesus because God had all the chosen people but then you lift your head but there's a there's just one thing that started from the beginning and never stopped following them and that was the trail of the serpent right yes never get away with it that's why God through this whole whole ordeal was telling Abraham foreign many many 400 years or 400 Generations they will go to captivity uh so what went wrong in all this you know and and we're leading to is what we call iniquity I kind of want to bring bring that point out but what is Iniquity yes can we have anyone honest here just so we could get to the bottom again which one of you young um [Music] I know Ruby got Ruby or because yes just answer whatever whatever the answer is going to help someone else not a bad answer hello you you see these answers from these from the these these young men these are answers that help us so much you know I I had ran to this definition of iniquity yeah yeah and I liked it because it was you know it painted a different picture than what we're used to hearing and when we look into iniquity you know it it ties right into sin okay you know there's sin written all over it [Music] but this definition it reads like this definition the Bible speaks of and alludes to God measuring the sin is in the uh an iniquity of each person yeah each nation and the world iniquity is a type of sin that is international and shows so when we're reading this we we as message Believers this next part really got my attention is this the difference between sinning and secret life because we are ashamed and sinning in the full light of day in LA and ignoring ignorando or renouncing God's sovereignty foreign [Music] the iniquity that that abounds and we we know the Bible talks about the mystery of iniquity we think if we sin in private then somebody or we sin and no one knows that it's okay but we go back to the times in the old testamento they didn't have the blood they had to come with their yearly sacrifice and the innocence of that sacrifice would then come upon them and that's what was required but their nature wasn't changed so you you could kind of see they were up against the battle that's why he he starts talking about the cup of iniquity and many times we look and is we we have to look at ourselves is that cup of iniquity full in our lives because really what is it once that cup is full you know we look at that's God's tolerance you know through the blood of Christ he looks away because he sees that blood that's covering but you see this world that we live and when is God going to stop tolerating sinus when are we going to stop tolerating sins you know we look at this great promise but when are we going to stop our Readiness we think just because we don't smoke and drink that everything is fine the prophet God says it's the little things oh I don't feel like going to church when you know where you should be because I don't understand when you know that's where your strength is the thing just alluding off of what you're going off because there's three there's three words that gets associated with iniquity and that is transgressions it's also it's almost like levels of Disobedience so one of the Hebrew words of of uh of iniquity it means guilt worthy of punishment which we realize that that it when we have iniquity we are all given a choice and there's a choice to choose to find forgiveness oh now I get to put Benji on the spot Benji was telling me of this illustration that he saw yeah I want you to explain it okay so we dig into a lot to try to come with different ideas I don't think I was more thankful that God sent us a prophet then okay I was watching you know this a video had popped up because when you search something on YouTube on YouTube everything on that topic pops up so there was this um I don't know if his Pastor I don't know what he was this is what the Lord told me he says this is unique this is how iniquity works you poured water in a cup a put dye in the cup he said this he says this is sin he says it's iniquity but all you got to do is repent is start all over that sounds pretty good he continues he says but then your spirit builds up again he says don't worry start all over again I I began to see the pictures that he was painting and it was to me it was picturing a perfect picture of iniquity that we continue to do the same thing over and over oh God ain't coming for a long time my whole life I've heard the ministers God will be here tomorrow and you know so you you see that and you're you're like man why did Life to Live here you know without completely dedicating our whole lives to him we think that God is not going to come to that point where he's completely can't tolerate sin no more you know but but I have this code and I'm kind of glad brother Omar brought it to that point this is the baptism of the Holy Spirit it says and when the whole thing begins to leak out and the righteous seed began setting on the side Delgado and the wicked just keep on very religious just keep getting Wicked and wicked and wicker he continues and nothing to do but to destroy the whole thing like he did back in the Andalusian destruction every thought of men continually full of sin is everything man thinks about today is a bottle of whiskey or some woman or out running around can't live true to their wives the boys can't live true to their girls can't live through to the boys why they're in such a place till the devil has got them so bound and possessed with evil spirits and the whole thing has just become a conglomeration of sins he says that's why we're in this day and that's the reason yes that Russia is playing exactly in the hands of God is to rock this thing right out of here the Bible says so certainly God using communism don't you think that it that is so crazy the prophet of God preached this many years ago but that's why God said a prophet to see ahead of time I don't know if you caught that scripture the first scripture I read in Matthew 24. oh it went here but but through all this he he talks about you you jump to verse 14 24 14. and this is the part this is the light that we have to look for yes you know we start talking about these cups and how they'll eventually be full in business but what's going to happen until that time where is the glory that the bride is going to have and I like this part chapter 14 and the gospel of the kingdom is shall be preaching in all the world for a witness unto all nations that's the part we really that that part's got to fire us up that through all this bad yeah that true gospel is still being preached that's the part that's being made alive and then you start be getting we feed off each other we get wound up like we heard Sunday where's the devil if he gives me if he gives me a punch he's going to have one coming back most definitely because because in this we find we find like like like a brother Adonai said you find that this iniquity your answer was you know you see that these sins they can come and iniquity can Define your life foreign the blood of Jesus is strong enough to a day to obliterate any of them you see that when Jesus Is In The Garden of Gethsemane Jesus he's saying father take this cup away like was it was it a cup like the drinking cup what was it it was a measurement it was something that he did not want to take part of because as he consumed our iniquity I don't know about you but I'm thankful our iniquity got swallowed up by his blood just like you and I never did it but the thing is for us now oh yes is okay now go and sin no more and that's the part that that as you go to brother brother Abraham sorry brother Benji's illustration that's what's wrong with the Gentiles that's why we're considered an unclean race we're a bunch of pigs came to church on Sunday thank God I feel so much better now yeah but we haven't even left the door right back to it then you have been engulfed with iniquity and we're blind and don't even know it is but when you accept that perfect sacrifice and you truly let the blood wash you God puts us get your sin and throws it into the sea of forgetfulness libido and he puts a sign up and it says no fishing this doesn't even happen move forward with your life hey man I I have a quote here but we're pressed on time because Brothers this is the code of when brother Branham is going to go to Israel Israel but the Holy Spirit tells them no it's not time yet I was looking at it right now he saw this for his day but it was meant for this day and this is just the last part of the quote the Gentile church is now in the ladies yeah end of the lady of CN age the Jews are in their Homeland already there as a gentile apostasy has already taken place and we have a president like we have is this is for us we have a nation is broke up like we have we have atomic bombs hanging in the hangers we have a church that's lukewarm the remote we have a church of people that draws themselves together that's us now we have a Ministry that patterns the ministry of Jesus Christ do you believe that church you know we we have to to me and and my words I have to place these right okay because what God has given us you know to me but I mean God gave this ministry to me so it better be the greatest ministry that's here on Earth and every church should see it that way you know because that's what gives us life here it's the leadership that God gave us just like Abraham was a great leader to his people we have to see that and our propheter was seen this day because I see a church that's ready I see a church that has a Unity I see a church that has a Ministry and if when we can look at that then Romans chapter 12 tells us [Music] is receive his word and accept it for the Abraham Manorama well Bueno we're gonna find out who the amorites were Obama says and why God hated so much the amorites they were one of the Seven Nations that occupied Kane before the conquest by the Israelites now Canaan was the land that the lord gave to Abraham when he came all the Earth but let's go back a little so we can follow the spirit and see why God hated the Emirates now the MRIs God did not produce Giants but saying you something that God had created to produce there was the serpent yes Genesis 9 18 and it says and the sons of Noah that went forth of the earth were damned ham and japheth and ham is the father of Canaan he knows we want to follow the seed and what it produced Genesis 9 22 Genesis and him the father of Canaan so the nakedness of his father and told his two Brethren without Yan the father is Genesis 10 14 yes some of these words are hard to pronounce but the first path through some and castle in Allah who came the Philistines where Goliath was a Philistine he eat a partridge remember we want to see where those giants came from and Canaan begets he done his firstborn in half as now notice the territory from the Dead Sea is of Jordan to Mount Hermon yes he was a giante he had a bed made of iron there was 13 and a half feet long the MRIs were notorious for superstitions for witchcraft or black magic their area was between the Euphrates River and the Mediterranean season we see that Abraham's descendants have been enslaved for 400 years and after Moses set them free especially they Journey to the promised land Canaan is it was the land of the Emirates because the Lord had told Abraham that is the fourth generation your descendants will come back here for the cup of the sin of the human rights has not yet why okay they were so afraid of them they build walls for protections one of the Kings built a wallet there was a 170 miles long from the Tigris River to the Euphrates a lot of those tribes viewed those MRIs with disgusts gusto this is what they said about the amorites they said his companion is his weapon companies he knows knows the mission he knows no grain in other words if they didn't have food they ate grass does the King Nebuchadnezzar when he was turning to appease thank you he knows no house or Town Pueblo and he is nothing but raw meat and he is not buried after death where they died or in battle they just left the body the MRIs were barbarians so even when they reached foreign barbarians Leviticus 18 1 levitical Uno and the Lord spoken to move the Saints speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them I am the Lord your God after the doings of the land of Egypt for in you dwell shall ye not do and after the duties of the land of Canaan whether or I'm gonna bring you shall you not do neither shall you walk in their ordinances notice where the spirit comes from he can say that donde is a spiritual verse 7 Mercedes the nakedness of thy father or the nakedness of thy mother shall thou not uncover cheese thy mothers thou shall not uncover her nakedness thy father's nakedness is the spirit that they got that came from their great grandfather um and then his grandson of him he married his own mother but that's another story no he can say verse 21 versus Allah profane the name of thy God I am the Lord but foreign [Music] or an observer of times or an intender or a witchero with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancer means for all they do these things are in Abomination unto the Lord and because of those Abominations the Lord thy God does try them out from before thee is that's why God could not destroy them until that cup or Bible in a place they call it the cup or another place they call it the ball uh or the bio or a a Bible is what we used in a laboratory it and that violates us a thin little skinny little thing that where we mix acids is that we needed when we were gonna analyze what we would analyze analysis it was a God that they had where they would sacrifice children I asked the question to you people and you might probably say is brother Abraham that Spirit of a sacrificing uh uh children that that have been way back then I tell you people they are sacrificing more children and he was the head of a bull with his hands like this conscious and they would make a fire and put the baby there on the arms of that then a God that they had made sacrificing children is that Spirit still in effect every year they sacrificed children all around the world how many times have you seen you heard or read well a woman will go into a bar and leave the baby in a car with over 100 degrees weather how many children died because of that in the in in the United States how many mothers drawn their children when they don't want to take care of them no more cuantos matters do you know that 40 percent of pregnancies are terminated by abortions and they're having a big debate in the United States about abortions a woman that a balls are under the spirit of the Emirates there are about 3 000 abortions daily abortiones and those are the old those are only the ones that they reported because many don't report it much is practice child sacrifices there has been a Resurgence of child sacrifice Caleb in Uganda I uh and Uganda which doctors have been implicated in mutilation and death of children Los brucos is who were killed in an effort to bring good portion and wealth to those that were willing to pay foreign so there's more child sacrifice now than in those times the spirits don't die Spirits stay here and they've been traveling all this time yeah when the Israelites israelitas they got to the border of the promised land they sense and then they came back all scared we look like grasshoppers they saw the MRI Giants right there they don't know but thank God for calebos he said we are more than able to take this lamb this is we are able to overcome only he in Joshua were the only ones that brought great background foreign but it's not for me there are they're afraid no we can say none of them were permitted to go over and they perished in their own land but once they crossed over into the Promised lands years later they went and married more about women right woman and history repeats itself yes many have come into this message and like the woman Methodist Lutheran foreign and on and on and they're they're afraid is a woman a giant is they have committed fornication among them foreign Gentile woman they polluted the bloodstream EOS contamination which is the life because they had to keep the bloodstream clean for catanic limpia because the Jewish blood is the cleanest blood in the face of the Earth is you know we've already insane look amazing and San Lucas that Jerusalem shall be trampled by the Gentiles so then why is Jerusalem being trampled by the Gentiles no questions who founded Jerusalem I'm waiting okay foreign [Music] [Music] thy birth in the Nativity of the is the land of Canaan the father was an Amorite and the mother of hitters it is for thy Nativity in the day that thou was born thy neighbor was not cut neither was thou washed in water to stop stop only that was not something at all nor swallow you know foreign now this is God talking about Jerusalem Caleb you were in Jerusalem correct me if I'm wrong did you say that only one fourth of Jerusalem was the Jews lived and the other three sectors were were gentiles of the old city so we're gonna we're gonna see why only one fourth were Jews I'm gonna be jumping this this verse is very long and so we don't have time to you know I'll be dumping boys and we're talking about Jerusalem is to do any of this unto thee to have compassion about thee but thou was cast doubling to an open fuel the loathing of thy person in the days the thou was born I said unto thee when thou was in thy blood Vivek I have called it to multiply as the bird of the field and thou has increased and works great and thou will come to excellent ornaments thy breasts are fashioned and thy hair is grown for as thou was naked and bare foreign Mia and I'm working with water yay I thoroughly washed away the blood from the and anointed thee with oil let's jump to verse 14. and thy renowned went forth among the Heathen for the beauty for it was perfect through through my calmliness which I had put upon these days the Lord God is is why so many Gentiles are there in trust in thine own Beauty and played the Harlot because of thy renounce he became so famous they opened so everybody wanted to build Jerusalem and pour out thy fornication on everyone that passed by you know confessions to foreign El capitolo moreover thou has taken thy Sons and Daughters whom thou has borne unto me and this is of the sacrifice unto them to be devoured is this of thy whoredoms a
