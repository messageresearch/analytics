and bring me just that you just a cup of water amen amen how many love him tonight I said how many love him tonight I don't know if you remember but when we have a Friday night service it's an Evangelistic service so if you came tonight you better came with the m ready to ask God whatever you need that's why we're here tonight we're not here for any other reason but that the Saints of almighty God would call upon his name and he would answer so I I hope you you're ready for this tonight you know we serve a god that there's nothing impossible for him is there anything impossible for him nothing so if we call upon him he's got to answer but now we have to meet those requirements we got to meet the requirements that he's asking that if there's sin in our lives we got to correct it if there's sin in our midst we got to correct it so let's do that first and then no matter what you have God can answer you do you believe do you really believe tonight there's a man here that is hurting I believe that God is going to heal him tonight and I know there was a sister with a herur eye here God could heal her eye tonight but we got to believe it the prophet of God says if you could get the people to believe he says they're not even cancer that's the god that we serve he's not a god of halfway but he's a God that answers that when Elijah called upon Him fire came from heaven when Joshua needed more time the sun Stood Still it's the same God in our midst today but you got got to believe Revelations 2 apyp Revelations 2:2 apocalyps and it says I know you may be seated leave the scripture up there may God have the blessings to the reading of his word so we all know this scripture this is God talking to the Ephesian church it was the first church St but he starts off and he says I know what does that tell us he's telling his people I know what you're going through he said I know your Deeds I know your faithfulness that's what he's telling us tonight Church of the cross I know what this church stands for he says I know that you're a missionary minded church he says I know your hurts I know your labor I know you love me I know what you do God knows our hearts he knows our intent there's nothing that God don't know but many times we think God don't know we think he don't know he knows Ethan Ethan he knows what's am do you you believe it you know what you're asking for I don't know but you reached God tonight don't you lose it whatever you ask for going to give it to you he knows he knows your heart he knows you're hurt AJ God he knows he's going to heal you tonight Hallelujah he knows he knows the hurt that we go through he knows we fight he knows we toil he knows what we go through that's why when he came he didn't send someone else he came himself he wanted to better understand me he wanted to know what I go through he knew we all would have our own complexes he knew we would think things he knew we would think the brothers are talking about us he knows church and that's why the scripture says I know the works I know you're I know your patience I know thou can't can't not bear that which is evil and th thou has tried them that say they are Apostles he said your your foundation is well he says I know this he says but you know what I have one thing against holy moly wow wow how could he tell us all that we've done well that he's proud of us but all after all of that he says but hold on I got one thing against you wait a minute remember I said now we got to fix what's broken inside of us if we haven't met those requirements they got to be met first our hearts have to be right we see Time After Time the word in its Purity preached behind this Pulpit the word hits me first it hits the minister first so we don't come here trying to tell you to correct yourself God beats us up first and I got to say church I had a bad attitude you know we had a rough year last year I remember there was months I was gone more than I slept in my own bed and we're not bragging but you know what church we came at the end of the year and I wasn't paying attention because because we every time we serve the devil has every right to hit us back and me as a dummy I wasn't paying attention and I began to get depressed I began to feel like nothing because that's what happens the prophet of God says I will restore the years the P wor the year Locust but many times we forget that those same insects they're still around those sticky little boogers they're trying to sneak in the church they're trying to get us depressed they're trying to get our heads down they try to sneak again but you know what he said the prophet of God said he saids when those worms when those beetles eat the tree all the way down to the stump he said you know what he said a branch try to grow here he says it was a denominational he said he try he pruned it down another one came up denominational he said he pred it he says but through all this he said what the devil didn't know that inside the heart of that tree it was growing it was getting stronger so if the safe thing is happening today they're trying to sneak in trying to make you feel bad they're trying to make you feel like a little yeah that's what we are many times complaining about everything oh this is that I don't like how the windows came I don't like this well maybe God don't like you attitude maybe he don't like your condition you see those beetles they come in but you know what he said he said I will restore he said all the years all the years that were e and Christ is the mystery brother says what are those years is that all the healings all the blessings all the Miracles that pertain to you pertain to me amen I'm going to restore those I'll I'll tell you something church I want to so bad my own life I want it to catch up to the messages that are being preached as many times we think through our complaints oh that that message is too good for us it looks high it's so impossible you know what there's nothing impossible for God he said you've lost Focus you've lost Focus he says where has the where did you leave the first love that energy that you had when you came to the Lord you were ready to do anything where where to go where's it at church it's here I want to lose my attitude I want to Lo lose everything bad that I do but many times we as ministers I'm sorry to say this but we're afraid to admit it we're afraid to admit it because many times even as Christians we think we're without sin we think we're so holy we think we can't be touched and then we find ourselves in the same place as the Pharisees and sades that they were looking at Jesus you don't do that we know a law that's greater than that but if we could be for real church and I I don't I don't know I don't know about you but if brother Caleb wasn't my pastor I don't know who else could teach me and I hope every church that's listening to this message has the same opinion about their Pastor I remember years ago we all every one of you was cing at this altar when our found Pastor got sick do you remember that time do you remember the toils we've gone through we felt so abandoned we felt so in loveed and then you go back church I'm sorry to say this there's days I get up and I tell myself the guy back there could be so disappointed to see you today he expected more out of you he wanted your growth to be higher so you see how easy these insects can come in and put this dark shadow that comes upon the church when our pastor toils he gives his life for this place for the souls for the souls for me we take it for granted I take it for granted but I'm tired of playing games because you know what the prophet of God says he says in that first love he says that's where the power ISS that's where the power lay many times through maturity we think that power is going to get there but he said this from your first love from your first word he says that's where the power lay but many times we don't take God for what he's worth he's powerful he's mighty there's nothing too great for him this is for you brother Diego what time did I start I I wanted to calm your nerves you know brother Diego has a saying that every time the preacher wants more time he asked the people how much when did I start but you know what church why don't to calm your nerves because it's time for us to come up high we don't got we we ain't got a whole lot of time but we're afraid to call God on the scene we're afraid to call him on the scene because there's sin in the camp we don't realize and you say brother what are you saying Paul said I sin daily he was an apostle of God but it's the little things church it's the little things that hurt the Lord like oh we have another Sunday night service the youth have another UD doesn't the pastor know we have lives too these are the things that hold it back you know the gifts that God has placed in this church they're here and we know what the scripture says gifts and callings are without repent but the gifts are for you but when we doubt when the gifts are in operation we are holding something back we're holding something back and I don't look at this physical body but I look to the spiritual aspect we are getting their Church the coming of the Lord is the hand he said that you knew God was coming today he said what would you do would you repent would you give your life to God if you knew he was coming today but you know what church he's here today whatever you need he is here huah don't be afraid to ask him don't be afraid to give your life to him your brother and sisters need you they want you because what did that what was the leaves eating for the leaves when they ate at them come on youth when you answer it anyone Fellowship I don't know about you but I don't Fellowship the way I used to what's my excuse I don't have a house right what's your excuse I work too much I have kids that are children that I have to raise you see how easy it is to make excuses but he says let's start off with first he didn't say you lost your first love he said you left it right so it's it's in reach it's in reach it's not too far away he says okay I'm going to tell you this but I'm going to tell you how to get back but he said first what does that mean why do he use first why did he use first Noah he doesn't like being second he doesn't like being second but every time I use the excuse I don't have a home I just put God second every time I say I can't make it to prayer service I put him second every time I say I didn't call Brother Ronnie that they didn't tell him I loved him I put him second every time I didn't show up to church sometime I put him second every time that I don't pick up my Bible and read it I put him second every time I don't pray I put second you know God is not built that way he it's it's not normal for him to be put in second place he's a jealous God and he demands Perfection but church I don't want to put him second I want to have that what the pastor preached on which is called preach preeminence that he's first not second but many times this is a bad part he's third and fourth he's not even second but he wants to be first his big complaint is that we don't put it first telling us so if we don't put him first then what are we doing what's in first what is in first whatever it is what have we done we've created an idol now we've created an idol we're going backwards in time it doesn't matter what it is many times we'll even put a job before God cuz it doesn't matter if your job is getting in the way you're saying God can't give you a job that won't be there God will give you a better job he don't like excuses he wants to be first because when we put Idols in front of us the prophet of God says the statue of a perfect man he says all these unbelievers he says what do they do they prostate themselves in front of the idols he said to the point where that Idol begins to be healing it begins to even move itself that's what he says cuz they believe so much in the idol that is doing weird stuff stuff imaginary in their mind because that's what the devil uses he uses your mind that's his Battlefront but we fall in that trap every time and we let Idols become in our midst thinking we're Christians what do we do we put religion we put the Church of the cross in front in front of our relationship with him that that one hurt me that one hurt me because we all have nicknames around here we all have nicknames I like my nickname whatever you do Caleb that Caleb says you do it that's all you got on me I'll take it all day long but but but we began to to throw at each other but God he still sometimes weaks at our ignorance and these Idols become present they come become present that our relationship because we say okay I got to do this for the church I got to do that for the church and we forget our relationship with God now let's go to the queen of the South the Queen of Sheba what was she she was an idolatrous she came from the land of idolatry now here's the reverse pattern of it all she knew was Idols but one day she heard something she said she heard something about Solomon and something began to activate inside of her she looked at her Idol and she heard the stories she looked at the idol but then she heard the story but she says I got to go see what's happening when she met Solomon the prophet of God's said it was such a great experience that she left her Idols all she knew how to do was grab something she was trying to grab something to replace the idol he said she met her first love she met something great something that was Godly he said she didn't know what to do all she could do was grab a piece of dirt and she says I got to take this back with [Applause] me could you imagine if God would make that same impression on you today that you're just so blown away of his grace and his Mercy that all you can do is grab dirt everybody would think you're crazy but we do crazy things when we're in love we do crazy things and you know I I I wish I wish brother Lorenzo would use his own stories when he gets behind the pulpit but he always wants to use my stories and I don't appreciate he's always saying how I used to write my wife letters use your own love story now buddy but you know that's what what it does for us I remember I couldn't wait to write her a letter I couldn't wait to see her because something happened Something in My Heart began to activate but when I met the Lord that was different it I got more crazy I couldn't do nothing but jump and out I couldn't do nothing but scream it got so crazy that the sisters the sisters from s Miguel the sisters from V's Court they would play around and make fun of me jacine used to say something jacine used to say something she'll be she'll be laughing at me I said this is all I know I get crazy when I sing I get crazy when I talk about God's word because that was my first love and I knew nothing else nothing mattered something activated inside of me but why did he say last he said you've compromised your religion for my relationship he says don't he says now I'm going to tell you how to get back he says remember he says remember remember and I began to remember I began to remember I began to remember and we go back and God never left us we thought he was gone the whole time but he said remember he said then repent repent of what you've done he says then he says you will do what he says you will be an overcomer to him that overcome will I grant to sit with me is he talking about me is he talking about you he's going to Grant you yes or no that weak weak I'm not buying it if you're trying to sell it to me I'm not buying it that he's child see you see now that's the seed yeah that's the seed of this right am see you see the difference he remembered he remembered something something inside of him he said wait a minute this is who I am this is who I am this is the seat inside of me he said I'm just as crazy as the preacher because church I serve a god that is real he's a real God I'm going to share something with you and no I'm not going to share it think we're I think we're out of time but you know what church I love him Brother Carlos I love him are you crazy oh come up here then you know you know sometimes we have to we have to get a little bit relaxed to let God do what he's about to do musicians am you know I feel many times that the word comes and I I always stand back there watching what's going on but sometimes you know I'm going to share it with you when we're walking down this hill that brother Kaleb was talking about brother Caleb turns and he says he says you follow me and me as a dummy I tried to argue with him I said Cal this is we can't go there's cliffs in front of us and he turned he gave me that look Carlos I said yes sir but as as we were coming down the mountain I just remember the Lord telling me something he reminded me of the story of the king that was driving down in his Carriage down the road and he wanted someone to ride he wanted someone to ride with him and he's looking at the best dressed one his servant was looking but then he saw the soldier walking down the road his beat up his clothes were ragged fought the good fight walking down the hill I could remember my buddy my buddy Manda amig Manda my buddy Amigo all that were here stood behind our pastor we're getting old many of them are beat up many of them G have gone already and the Lord said he says don't never forget about those servants he says don't ever forget about the real soldiers the ones that can't walk anymore but they have fought the good fight he says don't forget about them stand your feet Church s up Brother Carlos slow you know many times we need a rededication every eye closed here if you want to rededicate your life not to rededicate it because you're kind of serious it doesn't matter if you're a minister Deacon Usher but many times we're the ones that I feel many times that I should be the one running to the altar but if you want to rededicate I ask you tonight just raise your [Music] hand but with a sincere heart say Lord I want to put you first Lord that preeminence that your scripture talks about Lord that's what I want I want to take you so serious Lord that I could just go home tonight with you Lord Lord but you've given us that fight that fight to help people to take this gospel to share what you've done for us Lord you've given us that fight we're not here to stay on the sidelines Lord but we want to fight to conf fight whatever St throws at us Lord I want to fight Lord fight this year harder than I've ever fought Lord touch your people Lord whatever their need mayy Lord touch their hearts do you believe a church with your eyes closed I'm going to ask my father-in-law to come forth he's hurting really bad he got thrown off a horse they
