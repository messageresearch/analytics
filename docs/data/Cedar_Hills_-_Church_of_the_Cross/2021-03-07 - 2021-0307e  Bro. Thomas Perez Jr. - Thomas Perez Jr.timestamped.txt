[33:08] do not imagine that you in the king's
[33:10] palace can escape any more than all the
[33:12] jews
[33:15] for if you remain silent at this time
[33:20] relief and deliverance will arise for
[33:22] the jews from another place
[33:27] and you and your father's house will
[33:28] perish
[33:31] and who knows whether you have not
[33:33] obtained royalty
[33:36] for such a time as this

[34:31] are called mrs lord jesus christ
[34:35] we are in in his kingdom we are a we are
[34:38] we are royalty
[34:41] we are the queen and there is only one
[34:45] king of kings and lord of lords
[35:01] when you hear a word like we heard this
[35:03] morning
[35:05] like we were heard last sunday and when
[35:08] you hear them on sundays
[35:11] you hear the minister and you hear
[35:13] brother abraham you hear the different
[35:15] other ministries
[35:17] you speak to us that's not just
[35:19] information for us
[35:22] something that has to change our lives
[35:25] something that's got to change our way
[35:27] of thinking
[35:32] and everything that we understand we
[35:34] have come to the place that we are all
[35:36] royalties
[35:40] we have come to this to this wonderful
[35:42] message
[35:52] this message has given us the capacity
[35:55] to understand all mysteries
[36:21] and he keeps on going and he keeps on
[36:23] going and he keeps on going
[36:26] step it is a ladder it is a step to god
[36:29] it is a stairway to heaven so we know
[36:32] all about what we are supposed to do
[36:36] but each step brings new
[36:38] responsibilities
[36:51] each step brings a new responsibility
[36:53] into our lives
[36:56] and when you find yourself and you are
[36:58] come to the place of understanding
[37:03] you find yourself that you are now in
[37:05] the house of the king
[37:08] and you think that you've that we have
[37:10] accomplished what we have
[37:12] set out for
[37:15] and we are royalty some people
[37:18] might might look at me
[37:34] chosen unelected people in pueblo
[37:38] i see i see a a royal priesthood
[37:42] i see you at a place where where you are
[37:45] sitting now
[37:46] in heavenly places in christ
[38:00] at times we forget where god rescued us

[38:55] and it does not have that same
[38:57] quickening in you you know

[41:03] that there is a decree that was given
[41:08] and the degree that was given is that
[41:11] anybody that was a jew was going to be
[41:13] put to death
[41:14] at a certain time
[41:18] we ourselves have got to know
[41:24] that the time that we are living in
