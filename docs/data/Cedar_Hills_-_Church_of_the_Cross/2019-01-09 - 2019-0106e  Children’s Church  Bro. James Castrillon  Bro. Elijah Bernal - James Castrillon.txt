like to thank our precious Lord Jesus Christ for giving me life to serve him and our pastor brother for giving me an opportunity to share a little something with you guys if you would all turn in your Bibles to Isaiah 40 verse 28- 31 hast thou not known hast thou not Hur that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth Fain not neither is he weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint if you would all bow your heads for a word of prayer de Lord Jesus Christ Lord Our Father who are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever amen you may be seated the title of a message is called Fearless as an eagle when I was when I was in my bed hearing the audio of the supernatural life of brother brandham I came across a story that really blessed me andless that brother brandom he was in the wilderness enjoying nature but there was this girl that was making a big fuss was making all sorts of noises but R watch the squirr hey what are you so excited about well brother bam realized that squirrel wasn't excited it was scared cuz he saw an because brother bham Saw an Eagle resting on a stump brother bam wanted to see the reaction of the eagle so he got his rle and pointed it at the Eagle guess what deagle did deagle did not do anything he just looked at brother brandom then brother brandom told the eagle hey fella aren't you scared of me you know I could kill you but still that eagle did not budge you just stay there looking at brother r brother bam became to wonder why is this Eagle not scared of me but then he realized that Daddy got God gave that eagle two powerful wings that as someone tries to shoot that eagle that eagle will be gone in two flaps now how many kids here are afraid of something and they want to share it nobody well we have some Brave kids here that's a good one you're scared of spiders now one from the girls no nothing okay there's we got Brave Girls here Isaiah another one spiders now if God gave the eagle two power of wings to take himself out of danger what has he given us well God has given us many things and to me two of them are the word of God on prayer amen now let's get deeper into the life of an eagle as soon as the little iglet grow feathers their mama starts to shake the nest she says kids it's time to face your fears so she shakes that Nest real hard and down go leg start falling and falling and they start yelling mama no please help us we don't know how to do this but they do that realizing that all they have to do is just flap those swings and fly so there goes the Momo she comes down and picks him back up after that she does that to teach him a lesson she says kids I'm going to do do that until you guys know that all you have to do is just flap those swings and eventually those eaglets realize that they won't die all they have to do is just flap those wings amen the Bible says in Joel 3:10 let the weak say I am strong amen could you repeat it with me yes let the weak let the weak say I am strong say I am WR come on guys I I heard your boys yelling outside I've heard your girls screaming outside you can do better than this again let the weak let the weak say I am strong say I am strong now that's better so please if the Lord tells you to do something do it because he won't leave you until you fulfill his purpose and as the Eagle girls they don't like to be in no places so when they're ready to fly but there's a storm they don't chicken out and say oh no the clouds are too dark I better stay here or maybe no it's just too windy I I'm going to stay here I don't want to break my wings no that eagle goes up to the storm and says you don't scare me and he flaps those wings and he overcomes the storm did you guys know that the eagle uses the wind the storm's Own Wind to pull himself higher God has given us powerful tools and some of them are the word of God and prayer so maybe when you're afraid and your mom tells you to go turn off the lights in the kitchen and you don't want to do it cuz you're scared or maybe you want to sing or testify in church but you don't want to do it cuz you're afraid my recommendation to you is flap those wings confess that you're a child of God and if you only know one verse of the Bible say it over and over and over again until you realize that the demon called being scared of the dark is gone or that demon that tells you oh don't sing in church cuz you're going to make mistakes or the demon that tells you don't testify in church cuz people will laugh at you now this is what brother bam says in the message expectations and I thought if God gave the eagle two Wings to take himself out of danger and he has down much trust in his wings what are a church that's baptized with the Holy Ghost do see there he was moving his feathers I thought yeah as long as he can feel them Wings they're all right he ain't scared of nothing and I said praise God as long as I can feel the Holy Spirit moving Devils can't scare nothing that's right when the holy spirits around I want to share with you guys a little testimony about how the Lord helped me overcome my fears I remember when I was younger I used to be really really shy so the Lord put something in my heart that I wanted to play that piano so I said and then I decided I wanted to play piano Chanel so as time went on I decided that I really wanted to play a special for the Lord so I got everything ready and I came up here and then I saw some obstacles my leg was all the way down there trying to reach the fed and then my hands R here trying to look at the piano and try to play piano and then fear came in and said oh well you're going to make some mistakes and guess what I didn't make one mistake I made a ton of [Applause] them so then I decided I was going to try again and on the second time guess what happened nothing I played the Lord I played for the Lord and I didn't make make any mistakes cuz the Lord helped me overcome my fears and I ended up having more fun then I honestly just forgot that I was being scared and then I decided after that one I was going to do another one and the second one was still pretty terrifying but then the third one it wasn't so bad and just kept on going to the point that every time that I go up here to play a piano the and the Devil comes in tes to and tries to tell me oh well you're going to make some mistakes I tell him oh come on devil it's too late I've already got usess in my heart so I tell him to get his dirty lives and get out of here and then I enjoy playing for the Lord and before I let you guys go I want I want to tell you guys a little quote about what brother benam says about and now he said say fellow are you scared of me he just sat there and looked at me and I thought oh I see God you want me to see that eagle because he's Brave that's what it is God don't want cupboards God wants brave men are remember little kids when you're afraid or when you're in your bed and the lights are off and there's noises coming around and you don't know what they are remember that there's a stronger hand holding you and it's the one of our Lord Jesus Christ God bless you man God bless you this evening God bless our brother James who did a wonderful job and um give a hand hand clap ask you forgive me this evening I'm very nervous but that you just helped me last time they asked me to to preach for children's church church I had got my message ready came to church met brother Jerry in the back and he said I want you to preach for about 10 around 10 minutes I was confused I asked him I was like well brother Jerry what if I go over and he he laughed and and he was like well I'll let you know so I come preach my message with an interpreter and get off we go back home listen back to the tape I had preach for 3 minutes and 20 seconds so I hope that I can go a little longer than 3 minutes and 20 seconds this evening you just help me if um if you could please stand and uh we'll uh you kids willing to help me out no okay God one is willing to help me out okay who all brought their Bibles okay so first one that can find me First John 4:4 44 ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you that he is in the world Amen man greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world but what catches my attention the most it says that little children that ye are of God how many believe that okay so the second scripture is first John 2:28 really close to each other and now little children abide in him that he shall here we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming amen that the little children should abide in him you may be seated this evening I just want to want to speak of two different Kings the Old Testament and the kings of Kings of Israel how many know the story of King manasse not a very known name how many know King Josiah okay so two of us know what King Josiah is okay well to start off with Manasseh they were both really young kings manasseh's dad was King Hezekiah who knows about King Hezekiah well King Hezekiah was a a very very good man in the Lord and and the Lord blessed him because the Kings before him had destroyed the church or the or or the house House of God and Hezekiah came and restored it and made the people serve the Lord well after Hezekiah got older and he passed away his son came his name was King manasse how many know how old King Manasseh was any of the adults 12 he was 12 years so is who here is 12 years old of the young nobody told years old come here Paul you mind help me out so we all know that brother Paul here is not an evil person not that we know of but King manasse was Paul's age whenever his father died and he had to be king so can you stand there lost my spot there okay so his father very great very great king how old are you 12 okay so he was 12 years old so King Manasseh under the influence of his father and those around him should have been a great King right well the Bible says that King Manasseh was one of the one of the most evil Kings for the first part of his life that he did that which was wrong now we know Paul didn't do that Paul is a very good very good person I hope I know we know that so um so he was 12 years old so how was it that Manasseh was such an evil King how did he become such an evil King if his father was so great because of what he was young right so maybe maybe those around him had influenced him and told him your father was he was awesome great king so you don't have to be as great God will bless you because your father was he was a good King made the people serve the Lord well maybe manasse took after that saw what the other kingdoms were doing and he decided to follow after other gods and turn away from the Lord maybe he stopped going to church put up idol and this leads me to my next scripture first John 5:21 whoever finds it here yes just a little longer 521 no you know what it's okay you can sit down thank brother Paul for coming and helping me up here 521 yes we'll let you read it it's okay 1 John 5:21 521 first John 521 here okay let's see we'll get you to read the next one first John yeah little children keep your SL selves keep yourselves s from Idols Idols amen so a simple scripture it says little children keep yourselves from Idols now how many know what an idol is Elijah yes yes they were they were statues and what and what brother Elijah said it's any an idol is anything you worship or you put above God which is very evil so the Lord was very angry at King Manassa and after manasse it says the Bible said that he was worth wor than the world so in a pretty bad spot being that he came from a from a from a very good from a very good place in the Lord so you know what happened to King manasse he was taking he was taken he was taken captive he was taken other kings came other Kingdom came and and and uh destroyed the kingdom and took him captive took him to jail basically and it says that there is where he found the Lord and and um says here that he would he humbled himself said he humbled himself and God came down and and restored well didn't really restore his kingdom but brought him back to his kingdom and King Manassa repented and uh he was already older he wasn't as a child as 12 years old and that's where he made his mistake as a child he did not believe in God God so as he he went on he passed away his son came and was a horrible horrible King also he didn't he didn't live but two years in the as king and and he was and he was killed but then comes this other King Josiah how many know how how old Josiah was when he became he was 8 years old now who here is eight years old you want come help me so let's say this is King Josiah and um he uh the Bible says what he did 2 Chronicles 34:2 mind standing up here for a little bit okay than 2 Chronicles 34:2 none the ladies have their Bibles okay Lord and walked in the ways of his father David he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left wow so King Josiah from a young age found the Lord but his his father and I believe his grandfather were very evil so how was it that Josiah was able to find the Lord at such a young age tell us brother Josiah how did you find the Lord you the Josiah I don't know he doesn't know that's okay so and the Bible doesn't say but maybe Josiah had looked at the stories of old maybe he thought of Moses and how the Lord blessed him maybe he thought of of King Hezekiah and how the Lord was great with him so maybe Josiah decided I'm going to Worship the Lord and I'm going to do the best I can to serve him so you can go sit down thanks brother Isaiah so he decided to Worship the Lord and the Lord blessed him greatly because as a child he decided to follow the lord it says here that at in a young age he did that which was right he started so um Josiah was influenced greatly Maybe by his mother maybe by the priest and he would he took um he was obedient to the word I believe so Josiah began to look deeper and deeper into God's love and in his word and and found himself a great king powerful King and he did that which was right in the Lord so what was the difference what was the difference between the two kings who was the good King Asia Josiah was the good King and why was he a good King he found the Lord at a very young age and that's right what was Manassa why did Manassa fail true and because he decided that he wasn't going to follow the lord at a young age right because he thought his father did it good enough for him so I have another story um it's not in the Bible but who knows the story of Dwight Moody brother Caleb knows the story he's not brother brandom speaks of him a lot and the and the story of Dwight Moody to me is very is a it's very uh it's an awesome story because he he also found the Lord at at a very young age brother brandom said that there was an old wash woman that she was I believe it was it was clothes that she washed and um she was there and and uh she wanted she had on her heart to do something for the Lord so she decided that she was going to rent she was going to rent a stable quick question who knows what other marvelous story in the Bible happened in a stable Mary and Joseph and the birth of Jesus Christ that's right so she rented us she rented this Stable horses and she cleaned it up and then so she starts inviting people come on we're going to have a Revival this evening through the week it's going to be good she gives people this paper she gives people this paper I got here or three people and um they would read it they would take it C see and they saw that it was going to be done in a stable and they threw it on the floor and walked off because brother bradam says it wasn't fancy enough for them so that the rest people so the wash woman felt very horrible she felt like she had done nothing for the Lord so time comes the preacher's there washwoman is there and um earlier that day she had she had she had met this young boy and came up to her and said well what are you doing what what's that you got and she says well we're having having a meeting this evening and uh she says here take one he says well I can't read but but um but what's going on she said well we're having a Revival and um it's going to be good so he says okay he takes one he continues on his way and as he starts and as the as the preacher starts brother brandham says that a small raggedy hair boy walks in through the door he said he was just a little boy and he came and his daddy's clothes cuz he was very poor and so that from there is where he found Jesus it was just the wash woman and the little boy and the preacher in his stable so uh brother Dwight Moody he went on to save millions of souls what brother brandham says he was a great man of God brother brandham uses him a lot so we understand that you have to know God from a very young age and believe in him with all your heart you're are going to succeed in life is that right amen so um well I thought my notes were going to go longer but I guess not so what was something that you learned brother brother Andress that's heard God and what's the best time to start any time right now is the best time to start serving the lord amen is that a so um I uh I've been in church all my life and um and I um and the Lord's been good but this past year just quick testimony before I finish I had a I had a deer hunt how many like to hunt a little wow a lot more than I thought that's good it's awesome and um I had heard that there was going to be a lot of deer it was going to be an easy hunt and uh so I beli that so I started walking and we were looking for the deer and we could um and there was no deer to be found as we so I became discouraged I walked Dad we walked up up and down mountains and nothing so as we were walking down we began to talk about Jesus and what he does we began to began to look at the stories of old and he said well brother Mark had a had a story of where u a wonderful hunting story where where God had provided him a an elk is brother Mark here is that true brother Mark so I said well well if that could happen to brother Mark well it's got to happen to me too so we started going and I prayed and then ideas started coming well happened to brother Mark but how could it happen to you you're just you just you know you're not you're not like brother Mark so it kept going but I prayed and I believed that there was going to be a deer for me so I expected it to pop out of nowhere and it didn't but it it was Thanksgiving day and I decided Well I didn't decide to eat I mean I kind of had to eat and um there Thanksgiving and prayed I said Lord I don't know where to go we don't know where to go can't find anything but if you just lead us to it Lord we'll be ready so finished started eating eating canned ham which doesn't taste like ham am but it's pretty good so um and we hear these side by sides coming four-wheelers and um and there were two strangers never never met didn't know their names he says we know that you guys are hunting deer and we want to take you to where the deer are so you can shoot a deer so we go the first day and uh and we SE some but we but we weren't able to get it that day so so I was discouraged again but I said you know you know the Lord is good and and I love him with all my heart and I have since a young age so we go the next day and the Lord provides a deer for us and uh it was just it was good because you don't have to be any older in what you are especially the children to know that God is he's real and he's able he wants to help you that ye are of God and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so um just just remember that and to love God in your young age and to keep him as you grow and I don't have anything else it was kind of short but uh pray that God bless you and that that you continue have a good day God bless you [Applause] would you please stand and I believe that the Lord the Lord is here and I believe we the Lord deserves another round of applause for
