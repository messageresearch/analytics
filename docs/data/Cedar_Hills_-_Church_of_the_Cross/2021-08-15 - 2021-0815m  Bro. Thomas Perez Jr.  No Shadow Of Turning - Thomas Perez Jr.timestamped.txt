[5:30] [Music]
[5:49] it just won't fade
[5:53] so many different stories we thought
[5:57] could not be redeemed
[6:00] but it's against our darkest values we
[6:04] start to see
[6:06] the beauty of the blood
[6:10] the goodness of this grace
[6:14] and mercy on his earth
[6:17] that can never be explained
[6:21] heaven's best takes all the scars
[6:24] for the worst in all of
[6:29] [Music]

[8:52] love is
[8:58] [Music]
[9:12] notice now
[9:25] notice now we're going to read
[9:27] in the bible
[9:29] and the the seventh seal
[9:31] that's found in revelations the eighth
[9:34] chapter and when he had opened the
[9:37] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[9:40] about the space of a half heart
[9:44] that's all we have
[9:47] now
[9:48] we're going to notice i remember after
[9:51] the fourth chapter of revelations the
[9:54] church is gone
[9:56] after the
[9:57] the
[9:58] four harsh writers has went out
[10:02] the church is gone see
[10:06] and then
[10:07] they were satan and his angels was
[10:09] kicked out
[10:11] and then they come to the earth and the
[10:12] battle set in again because eve broke
[10:16] down the barrier from where she was uh
[10:18] isolated behind the word of god
[10:21] you believe in god's mathematics
[10:24] you don't you sure lost you'll sure get
[10:26] lost in the word if you start
[10:28] four or six or
[10:30] or something besides just the
[10:31] mathematical words running an order
[10:34] you'll sure have in your scene a cow
[10:36] picking grass on top of a tree somewhere
[10:38] you'll certainly run out because god
[10:41] does not his whole word does run
[10:44] completely in
[10:45] in mathematics
[10:47] yes perfect the most perfect there's no
[10:49] other literature written like a language
[10:51] so perfect in mathematics
[10:54] now
[10:55] the
[10:56] the eighth chapter
[10:58] only reveals the scene of uh the scene
[11:02] of the seventh seal where nothing else
[11:05] is revealed now nothing
[11:08] all the way back from genesis is seventh
[11:11] chapter the seventh seal
[11:13] spoke seals
[11:15] from the very beginning in genesis
[11:18] the seventh jesus christ is speaking
[11:21] himself told her the end time and when
[11:23] he got told all said six seals when he
[11:25] got to seven he stopped
[11:29] there it is it's a great thing and
[11:31] nowhere through the church age
[11:35] since in the early apostolic church
[11:38] has the protestant church ever had a
[11:42] prophet
[11:44] tell me who it was
[11:47] never
[11:48] but we are promised in the last day
[11:52] that to return to the church again
[11:55] for the benefit of straightening up all
[11:58] that has been missed
[12:00] undone left undone of course predicted
[12:04] here that the seventh angel's message
[12:07] would finish the mysteries of god amen
[12:11] now we went through it all we see that
[12:13] it's perfectly in harmony with the
[12:16] scripture that's the reason now could
[12:18] you imagine when this person comes on
[12:20] the scene
[12:22] when he does
[12:23] remember it'll be so humble and thanks
[12:26] to the churches are messing up long ways
[12:29] if there be one among you
[12:32] you're spiritual or a prophet
[12:34] i the lord my god will make myself known
[12:37] to him and speak to him in visions
[12:40] through dreams interpret dreams
[12:43] somebody have a dream the prophet will
[12:45] be able to interpret it
[12:46] and if
[12:47] he has a vision he speaks it i'll make
[12:50] myself known to him through visions
[12:53] and dreams
[12:55] make myself going and if what he says
[12:58] comes to pass then hear that prophet
[13:01] because i'm with him now
[13:06] return now to the eighth first
[13:10] of the uh by the first verse i mean of a
[13:12] chapter
[13:14] revelation
[13:15] 8 1.
[13:17] we must remember
[13:19] that this seventh seal
[13:21] is the end of time of all things
[13:26] right
[13:28] the things written in the seventh seal
[13:31] book
[13:32] sealed up of the plan of redemption from
[13:36] before the foundation world it ever
[13:38] begins
[13:40] it is the end
[13:43] it is the end of the struggling world is
[13:45] end of struggling nature it's the end of
[13:48] everything in there is the end of the
[13:50] trumpets it's the end of the vials
[13:52] it's the end of the earth it's it's even
[13:54] the end of time
[13:57] time runs out
[13:59] the bible said so
[14:01] it's the end of the viles
[14:03] and even in the ushering in of the
[14:06] millennium
[14:09] that's on the seventh seal
[14:11] it's just like firing a rocket into the
[14:13] air
[14:14] and that rocket explodes here and it
[14:16] goes up then it explodes again it puts
[14:18] out five stars
[14:21] one of those stars explodes goes out
[14:23] five stars smith
[14:25] and then one of them stars explodes goes
[14:27] out five stars submit see it fades on
[14:30] out now how is he going to do it that's
[14:32] what we're going to go with
[14:35] we don't know
[14:37] notice
[14:38] the breaking of this seal was so great
[14:42] that heaven was hush-fired in silence
[14:46] for the space of a hammer
[14:50] god is it green
[14:53] what is it
[14:55] it was hushed
[14:57] cabins it was the same move
[15:00] for a half hour
[15:01] when the seventh sealed mystery in the
[15:04] book of redemption broke over
[15:06] [Music]
[15:10] think of it but it's broke amen
[15:13] the lamb breaks it
[15:17] you know what they were all about i mean
[15:21] they didn't know
[15:22] their blessing just stopped
[15:24] why
[15:25] what is it
[15:26] i'm going to tell you my
[15:29] my revelation
[15:31] and now
[15:32] uh certain
[15:35] as i stand in the platform
[15:38] tonight
[15:40] i
[15:41] had the revelation that revealed it's in
[15:45] a threefold manner
[15:47] sitting there
[15:48] when this left me
[15:50] something has come to me and said don't
[15:51] fear not in your little voice like on
[15:54] the inside of me spoke
[15:56] i have to just tell you the truth just
[15:57] exactly what happened something hit and
[15:59] said don't fear this is that third pull
[16:03] i was standing with a little baby shoe
[16:06] when he told me something make your
[16:07] first pull and when you do the fish will
[16:09] run out to the lure so then watch your
[16:12] second pull say because it'll only be
[16:14] small fish
[16:15] he said then the third pool will get it
[16:17] and there's three great things that goes
[16:19] with it
[16:20] and one unfolded
[16:23] today or yesterday the other one
[16:26] unfolded today and there's one thing
[16:29] that i cannot interpret because it's in
[16:31] an unknown language
[16:33] but stand right there and look right
[16:36] straight at it
[16:37] and this is the third ball coming up
[16:40] amen that's the reason all heaven was
[16:43] south
[16:44] remember
[16:45] the seventh messenger was
[16:48] the seven messengers was
[16:51] the
[16:52] noted one to me the seventh angel it
[16:55] seemed more to me than any i see they
[16:57] were standing like this
[16:59] and i was standing here
[17:02] and i was watching those other see one
[17:05] first bunch of little purrs feathers all
[17:07] beat down you remember them
[17:09] and they all flew eastward
[17:12] and the second bunch were brighter
[17:16] bigger birds look like doves pointed
[17:18] wings
[17:20] they flew eastward first pull
[17:22] second bull
[17:24] then the next was angels
[17:27] and it's standing right there and this
[17:30] explosion left and i was looking this
[17:32] way towards the west and they come and
[17:34] just pick me up and then i went out of
[17:36] my knowing
[17:39] and the one of them coming was the one
[17:41] that looks strange to me was the one on
[17:45] my feet to the left where i entered the
[17:47] constellation at but counting from the
[17:49] left to the right it would be the
[17:51] seventh angel
[17:53] okay coming across now
[17:56] remember the seven lessons do you
[17:59] remember
[18:00] the pyramid of white rock
[18:03] now notices
[18:05] that now
[18:06] when this
[18:07] taken place
[18:08] junior was standing in a field and had a
[18:11] had a big pyramid to it like that and
[18:13] there was something left on the rocks
[18:15] and i was revealing that to the people
[18:17] is that right junior
[18:19] about a year before it happened
[18:21] and notice the next thing now i took
[18:23] some kind of a bar and cut it off and on
[18:25] the inside was white rock that had
[18:27] nothing wrong on it
[18:29] and at that time i started to the west
[18:32] and i told them all i said don't go out
[18:35] west stay here
[18:37] and look on this until i return
[18:41] went west for the blessed return back
[18:45] to the east
[18:47] with the holy spirit interpreting this
[18:51] unwritten word amen
[18:54] amen
[18:59] but i know that it was then seven
[19:01] thunders putting themselves right close
[19:04] together just banging seven different
[19:06] times and it unfolded into something
[19:09] else that i see
[19:10] then when i see that i look for the
[19:12] interpretation flew across there and i
[19:14] couldn't make it out
[19:16] that's exactly right
[19:18] the hour isn't quite yet far amen
[19:22] what happens is that
[19:25] those seven thunders
[19:28] that he heard thunder
[19:30] and was forbidden to write
[19:32] that's what the mystery is laying behind
[19:35] those seven consecutive thunders going
[19:37] out
[19:38] now why that is proven why it is the
[19:43] secret that no one knows about
[19:46] john was forbidding to write about it
[19:48] even even on a symbol about it wow this
[19:52] is why
[19:53] there was a no activity activity in
[19:56] heaven
[19:57] it might give away the secret
[20:01] do you see it now amen
[20:03] but here is seven straight thunders rock
[20:06] and roll one two three four five six
[20:08] seven
[20:11] that perfect number
[20:13] then
[20:15] heavens couldn't write that
[20:17] heavens can't know about it nothing else
[20:20] because there's nothing to go on
[20:22] his relaxing time it was so great till
[20:24] it's kept secret from the angels
[20:28] now
[20:29] why if satan should get a hold of it
[20:34] he might do great damage
[20:36] that's one thing he don't know
[20:40] if they made one move it might give
[20:42] something away so they just shut up
[20:44] quit harping
[20:46] everything stopped
[20:49] uh seven god's perfect number
[20:52] seven
[20:54] is right down the road
[20:55] seven
[20:57] thunders utter
[20:58] straight together
[21:01] like you're spelling out something
[21:03] notice at that time
[21:06] john's started writing he said don't
[21:08] write it
[21:11] jesus
[21:12] never spoke of it
[21:14] john couldn't write it
[21:17] angels know nothing about it
[21:19] amen what is it
[21:21] it's the thing that jesus said even the
[21:25] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[21:26] about it
[21:42] i don't
[21:56] seven
[22:03] so the thing for you to do is
[22:23] therefore the power is
[22:37] or whatever takes place at
[22:52] all blended together so
[22:55] i could
[22:56] truly say
[22:57] that to the best of my understanding
[23:00] according to the word of god and the
[23:02] vision and the revelation
[23:04] the interpretation thereof is just
[23:20] god bless you each one
[23:26] [Applause]
[23:35] this amen amen
[23:38] amen what privilege it is to be in god's
[23:39] house once again

[48:44] that is
[48:51] and uh before we we go any further
[48:55] i i just wanted to to read this i
[48:58] thought this would be such so vital for
[49:25] i didn't expect me to change much
[49:43] simply give worldly stuff
[49:45] i still wore pants every once in a while
[49:49] so when i went to the camp i was waved
[49:53] by the the love everyone had for the
[49:56] lord
[50:10] and then the question came
[50:13] am i worthy of the gospel
[50:17] i didn't think about the question nope
[50:19] nope
[50:21] i might have just said yes right off the
[50:23] bat
[50:26] but the more i looked into it the more i
[50:29] started thinking
[50:33] the way i was living in the way and the
[50:35] way that i had been following the word
[50:38] was wrong
[50:53] and in the camp they talked about the
[50:55] result of excuses is the mark of the
[50:57] beast
[51:02] that realization hit me hard
[51:20] i was
[51:32] i knew that the love of this community
[51:35] community
[51:38] and the love god gives me
[51:42] is more than what the world could ever
[51:44] offer
[51:48] i
[52:02] and i won't
[52:12] and we appreciate that great testimony
[52:16] testimony
[52:22] now uh we we want to we do want to say
[52:25] we want to greet everyone on on the
[52:28] internet
[52:32] i always knew we were being seen in
[52:34] africa in latin america
[52:41] and throughout the united states
[52:44] but not until the other day that a
[52:46] brother told me that even in europe they
[52:48] are watching the simulcasts
[52:54] at all of our brethren around the world
[53:13] and we're thankful to the to to the lord
[53:15] jesus this morning
[53:19] we we want to go into some some
[53:22] scriptures
[53:25] before i before i go into that
[53:29] i had the privilege to open up the
[53:31] convention the virtual convention in in
[53:33] in colombia on friday
[53:40] in colombia in colombia and we're we're
[53:42] very very happy and
[53:44] thankful to you brother fabios for his
[53:47] confidence that he has placed in us to
[53:49] do such a work establish
[53:56] i do want to say that that
[53:58] i i trust the lord more than now than
[54:01] ever before
[54:06] and i i think that everybody should
[54:08] every day it should be
[54:10] a new day
[54:14] the bible speaks to us about new mercies
[54:20] doesn't mean that the mercy of god ever
[54:22] gets old
[54:36] to us
[54:39] and we're grateful to god that he is
[54:41] always understanding of our trouble
[54:48] i was out
[54:49] mowing my weeds not my grass my weeds
[54:55] but and i bought this uh riding
[54:57] lawnmower to mow these weeds
[55:05] and i don't know if any of you ever have
[55:08] these conversations with the lord
[55:14] well i i i am
[55:16] his son he is my father yes
[55:27] it is not a good thing it's to be
[55:29] disrespectful to almighty god
[55:46] when are you going to give me your whole
[55:48] heart
[55:51] and you know when you have a dialogue
[55:53] with god
[55:57] he already knows your heart before you
[56:00] even know it
[56:14] if you would have known our life
[56:19] we've been christians our whole life
[56:23] i don't know what it is to be in the
[56:24] world
[56:27] that does not make me a better person
[56:28] than anybody that was in the world
[56:33] makes me a better person
[56:36] what makes me a little bit more
[56:37] responsible
[56:40] but i tell you one thing for sure
[57:06] not to make a person that he feels
[57:09] better than another person
[57:23] that would keep you from such a thing
[57:27] but as i as i look and i'm 56 years old
[57:33] they tell me that i sing my first song
[57:35] at two and a half
[57:48] and once when you think that you have
[57:50] surrendered everything that you have to
[57:52] godot
[58:04] without without understanding this i
[58:07] said this
[58:10] he said he's i i told him he says when
[58:14] are you going to give me your whole
[58:15] heart
[58:18] and i said
[58:20] whenever you
[58:34] you heal
[58:35] my son
[58:38] and i'll heal your son
[58:40] how do you unders how do you rationalize
[58:43] that
[58:46] the only thing that you can understand
[58:48] is this
[59:01] you heal my son i'll heal
[59:15] and i i i looked at the scripture or i
[59:18] looked at myself i should say
[59:22] and and when i hear the word of the lord
[59:26] what are we going to call this
[59:30] immediately
[1:01:07] i was telling the pastor
[1:01:21] and i started sawing them down with the
[1:01:23] handsaw
[1:01:28] yes i have a chainsaw
[1:01:33] i have
[1:01:34] all kinds of different things i could
[1:01:36] use

[1:02:04] has got to
[1:02:32] moves us
[1:02:46] when i first
[1:03:14] sometimes it might be
[1:03:16] somebody did something wrong to me he
[1:03:18] said
[1:03:20] sometimes it might be you doing
[1:03:22] something wrong to somebody that you
[1:03:24] never made right he says
[1:03:41] and this this this brother yesterday
[1:03:44] something happened to him
[1:03:47] and this man this man would follow him
[1:03:52] until one day
[1:03:55] god delivered him
[1:03:59] from that shadow there's a song but he
[1:04:01] said that man never followed him again
[1:04:07] there are things in your life that will
[1:04:09] follow you every single
[1:04:38] because it dwells inside of you
[1:04:41] because there is a shadow that lives
[1:04:43] inside of you
