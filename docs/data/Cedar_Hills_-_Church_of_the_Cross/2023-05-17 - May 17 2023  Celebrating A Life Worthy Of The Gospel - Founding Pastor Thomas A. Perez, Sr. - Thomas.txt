apostle a person that his legacy will live on through Caleb through time for the servants that he taught how to be simple but how to be the best you could be I met brother Tom in the mid 70s traveled with the team in the late 70s and became a gopher I'd go for the coffee I'd go for their soda pop I'd go for many things for them at one time brother Tommy just giving a small testimony a one-time brother Tommy stopped me in said brought him a boy this is your training this is where you're going to start to train serving the greatest thing that man can do to be humble is to serve others and this is what he taught me he says Great Men start at the bottom they work themselves up to the top and they have to be the best they can be if you're if they think that they're hot you need to be hotter if you preach a message a message has to be a message to save a message to him and a message to teach what needs to be taught within a congregation brother Tommy was uh a great lawyer someone that could tell me what I needed to know and we're going to miss him a lot but we have a memory that is embedded that is embedded in our hearts uh our thoughts and with this I believe with all my heart that right now he and brother Bernie and brother Paul brother Pepe brother burunda those individuals that have paved the way for us are looking at us making sure that we are continuing uh this Apostolic message throughout the world and that's what I loved about brother Tommy he'd go into Mexico they knew him as Omas he'd go into other countries in the United States foreign countries internationally and then you'll miss Tommy brother Thomas he never made himself something to be big but never called himself anything above brother but we all know that he paved the way for the future of uh Latinos that spoke only English and that's why I'm proud to know that I had contact with with a man that was inspired a man that was anointed a man that showed me how to do what I'm doing today and that's live for others and at the same time understanding that our time is limited here on this Earth and what we should be doing is training those that will follow us those that will continue when brother Branham started those that would continue with brother burning started those that will continue what brother Tommy has started so I thank God for those great memories I go back through Memory Lane I can sit down and I can say praise God for individuals like brother Tomas Perez not only does he fit the bill of the faithful Ministry but it was all in him all the five offices in a man just like brother Bernie just like brother Brennan I'm not putting them at their level of brother Brown I'm putting them at a level that God called them to be the best they could be I want to thank you for this opportunity that you give me to greet you uh honoring this this great man of this Visionary so God bless you I'm praying for you I'm praying for the church and always remember uh if Tommy wanted to come back like Tommy used to say he would never come back because he's in a better place and he's Young and Viola is there with him sister I almost said with him so God bless you all and

sobres de Cristo is Anto as if we is my name is Paris senor foreign location is Bendigo thank you good afternoon God bless you this is Brother Rod Rohde I first met brother Perez in 1978 in Sacramento California when I was just a 21 year old young man this was someone that I was immediately drawn to a matter of fact two years later I had the privilege of marrying the first youth that brother Pettis had in this message it's my wife's sister Carol I want to say that when I heard him voice the word of God I knew this was truly a special servant that God had his ministry was out of an apostle I saw that clearly early on his example as a Christian his attitude as a Son of God to just to to teach us how to stand I'm so grateful for the example that he put before us and so so so grateful to have been able to have our paths across which I do believe those things I don't believe in coincidence I believe that God ordains these these things that take place in our walks in our lives I'm just going to read one verse here of scripture First Corinthians chapter nine says are ye are not ye my work in the Lord this is the Apostle Paul speaking he says if I be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless I am to you for the Seal of mine apostleship are ye and the Lord I rest on that I always have but God bless you greetings from Brother Jody in Alaska it's good to be here today and talk about brother Tommy I met him back in the late 70s he was on his way to Oklahoma and Arkansas where he had sheep there he was a pastor of some people that weren't in Silver City where he was a professor he stopped by to talk to me because my cousin Charlie had given me a book called footsteps on the sense of time which didn't have a front cover or back cover and I had trouble understanding the book and I told Charlie I need to talk to Tommy or somebody about a prophet I I'm having some issues there well Tommy stopped by and he talked to me and he gave me scripture after scripture how God still used prophets well that was awesome but I said I need more of this he says why don't you come down to Silver City and we'll talk and I go yes sir so I went and I visited when I got there to Silver City I went into a place called sword Tabernacle where he was a pastor and as I entered the front door I saw a picture of him and Viola and he was standing right underneath the picture but there was also another picture to the right of him as with a manacle who's that and he goes That's William Branham I go that's William Branham I go that's the man in my dreams he goes you had dreams about this man I go yeah he's a hillbilly well to make a long story short I ended up moving to Silver City when I got there everything was on shut down this the mine was on strike so anyways we're having a rough time during that time he stopped by for me one day and he said go with me to Demi which is about 50 miles 40 miles right in there to Deming we went we went to Deming and we we many of you know the story of the Whirlwind with the money in it we'll sit down and talk about that later I want to talk about a miracle the first miracle I ever saw was in Guadalajara Mexico at Pepe Hernandez church we were praying for the sick after brother Bernie finished preaching his message and as we went down to pray there was an elderly woman who had her hands raised she had her hands raised up high and she had her eyes closed when Tommy focused on her and he went down there he says come on God's fixing the move we went and he with one finger he being opened her eye one eye open the other one was shut when he opened it the socket was dry when he prayed for her he said what do you want she said he said Christo and when he opened her eye again I saw a eyeball I swear on my mom's grave that's the first miracle I saw little pockets of light begin to drop and people were coming out of wheelchairs people were praising God uh running around it was just unbelievable let me say this about brother Tommy he's one of the greatest men I ever I don't think anybody could have a perfect family like that look at their lives right now they're men of God they're the daughters married Godly men I'm going to tell you we need to sit down and talk and I can tell you many many stories of things that I witnessed myself and saw God bless you from Alaska God bless you I want to thank you for this honor given to me to remember brother Tommy the burunda family first crossed paths was really taught me way back in 1941 that was with my dad was an Apostolic Pastor a pastoring there in the Bayard area 1941 he dedicated brother Tommy we then saw him in the early 70s at the Fillmore Church Phoenix Tabernacle in Phoenix on Fillmore we're all very familiar with the Supernatural Ministry the discernment and the revelation of the word praying for the sick and so forth that by the time we received from the Lord Jesus Christ I saw brother Tommy minister in Mexico Arizona New Mexico and we developed the family all the blessings of of being able to know brother Tommy and to be over that and tell you to the Lord Jesus Christ first then uh of course you are dead he moved us dad moved us from California to Phoenix in 1948 when brother Banner ministered to him yeah that had cancer of the throat 17 years later in 1965 dad moved us to Arizona and then in 1970 brother Bernie came from it was then that I first met brother Tommy I was blessed to speak with him a lot in 1977 through 1978 when he lived here here in Phoenix for around eight months I was blessed I visited brother Tommy several times in his home in Silver City what a tremendous sense of humor he had several times I was really honored to preach to this church there in Silver City the last time I met with Brother Tommy was in August of last year when I went to uh Las Cruces to visit brother Abraham I want to thank you for allowing me to publicly remember brother Tommy the great warrior of Faith a man of power Faith love Shalom God bless you Lord bless you this morning I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ one to make a couple comments for the family may the Lord give you peace and rest and a time not a Mourning but of joyful and that our loved ones can be in the presence of the Lord I think of a poem that my father always used to like to quote it said the hand of time is wound but once and no man had the power to know just when the clock will stop at later early hour to lose one's health is sad indeed to lose one's soul is more to lose a soul is such a loss that no man can restore only one life will soon be passed and only What's Done For Christ will last and we think of the passing of our loved ones and many times there's no way to explain it or anything to say but we'll see you tomorrow I think of our our brother Thomas and and the time that we had in fellowship and around the country and on missionary trips and I know that when we're doing the mission work we're we're in the will of God and so how many times do we find that the lives that he impacted and looking to these Elders that we had we know that they give us courage and it also give us Footprints to follow and I think then of another quote that the prophet of God quoted the lives of Great Men all remind us we can make our lives Sublime and departingly behind his footprints in the sands of time footprints that perhaps another selling or life solemn's Maine a foreign brother scene she'll take heart again let us then be up and doing and with a heart for any fate still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait knowing that the prophet of God said that when we've had a part in a saving of a soul and and when we've and when we've been part of that that our name would be attached to that when there's no more Moon and no more star and we spend out into eternity that our name will be attached to those things and it brings me a great comfort to know that our brother name will be attached to many many lives and many souls and and we won't say goodbye but we'll say God bless you and we'll see you down the road Lord bless you family Lord bless you brother Caleb brother Tommy your wives and your families and mom and all of those that are part of the Great economy of God we love you and we give you our our greatest thing we could say is God bless you may his peace be with you foreign answers audita um

some words farewell to my friend to be with the Peres family to be very close family since we first met is and for the people in this message that one way or the other one has brought us into it it's

missionary visit to the country of Colombia company which was along with Enrique that today we sustained ritual fulfill in the history what was said in malachios but a revelation God gave me to tell me he was my friend I mean Amigos ministerio the closest friend in the ministry also received from God the same feeling in the essay Temple at that time therefore our lives were bonded together to a
