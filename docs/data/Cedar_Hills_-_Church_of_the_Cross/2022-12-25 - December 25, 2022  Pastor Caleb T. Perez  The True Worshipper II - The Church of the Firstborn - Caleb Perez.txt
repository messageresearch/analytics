online God bless you Merry Christmas to you amen would you stand as we're gonna get we're going to get into the word we have a a little bit lengthy programs we're trying to we'll cut it down a little bit but we want to get right into the word quite a few people that are out sick this morning and be with them and give them their recovery they gave me some what was it that little thing it was for cottonmouth so I won't take it anymore so up in the middle of it you see me going like that yeah amen we're happy this morning because we understand by a prophet that Christmas is not a celebration celebration Christmas is a worship morning because we have come we have seen his star and we've come to work and to bring worship to the one and only potentate our king of kings and our Lord of lords this may seem like an odd scripture to read for Christmas is I think by the end of the sermon you'll understand why I I'm reading it so let's go to the Book of Exodus 13th chapter we were hoping my father was going to make it Pastor I don't know if maybe they're still on their way but when you have it you can say Amen the title of the message is the true worshiper number two is with a subtitled the Church of the firstborn how many here are the church part of that church of the first born you tell your neighbors a neighbor I'm part of that church yes part of the Church of the firstborn amen reads like this Exodus 13 verse 1. and the Lord speaking to Moses saying sanctify unto me all the firstborn that is wow we are the Church of the firstborn sanctify him unto me all the firstborns whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel both of man and of beasts it is mine is let's go to verse 12. that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the Matrix and and every first link yes set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the Matrix and every first link that cometh of a beast the males shall be the Lords verse 15. and it came to pass when Pharaoh could would hardly let us go that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of Beast therefore I sacrificed to the Lord all that openeth the Matrix being males but all the firstborn of my children I redeem is FICO once again the firstborn of my children I redeem or I buy back as blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated just for a few moments here in the scripture there is enough here to preach until as they say till kingdom come in when you see words such as first born these are things that are so relevant in understanding why we must be born again now we often think of the first born as the one who is born first yes or yes COC now I got to make sure this morning that that some of you are not in a food coma still yeah anybody's still in a food coma ate too much yesterday and then we went to bed late I'm sure see and then you've had a hard time getting up and you stayed in the shower and then you remembered it was a worship day notice this now we often think of the firstborn as the one who was born first is that right or what would be called the initial child and there is truth in that but there is much more to this subject than what meets the eye so as I was thinking and meditating upon this subject wondering why the Lord would have me preach this on Christmas I get this spot and I and I began to work with it so listen closely here if we talk about the first child that was ever born who was it somebody help me out here you look like a very intelligent crowd can happen today who was the first child that was ever born not man I'm talking to child right was Cain right in the Bible says that amen now now uh if Cain was the first and who was the second Segundo was able then my question then and this is where I'm getting into where I began to think about this that if the initial child was Kane then wouldn't the birthright belong to Caine um some are saying yes and some say no I'm gonna say it again if the initial child or the firstborn was Cain wouldn't the birthright belong to him you might say well the the law of the firstborn uh hadn't been established maybe it's true don't you think that satanas understood the significance of what it was to be a firstborn how many are with me this this day once again though do you not think that Satan understood what the significance was therefore wouldn't it make sense that the the spirit that anointed Cain would then tell him hey uh don't forget that you are the firstborn why then are you not receiving the benefits of being the firstborn if you can just go with me for a little while and just see who where what what I was meditating on and thinking of is and I I then began to think about the story and I and I and I and I remembered in the scriptures where it says Kane was very rothsanyo was there something that was given to Abel that Cain was expecting himself okay was there something that was given to Abel yeah did it have something to do with the blessing of the firstborne I had never stopped to think about that I mean we see that the birth the fighting going on with Jacob and Esau but I thought for a moment I said well well wouldn't Cain then be in the same situation looking for the blessing of being the first born and yet he saw that God accepted he accepted Abel's sacrifice but not his sacrifice I looked at that and I said my goodness I can see why he would be so upset this is where we would follow the trail of the firstborn what did Satan know that that he got them to get ahead of God's program that through the serpenter he got to the woman which was the betting ground he got to her first there for the firstborn child was Kane but although that Cain was Eve's first born he was not Adam's first born now this is why you have to look at it from from a few different angles and you talk about the firstborn well the firstborn of who watch as this this as we try to unfold this now when you really look at it then both of them were a first born all right sure see you look at that and but we see that Abel was of Adam and the Bible says that Cain was of that Wicked one but there was a Birthright the first male to open for without realizing it you you tend to We tend to overlook certain things but how many of them would say that Cain then then the birthright should have been his cuentos ah you guys are scared you disagree that's okay and and that that's why this thought came to me and I began to see this and then I I cannot preach something unless I go to the word I can't prove it by the word it doesn't mean no good then I have to take the thought and I gotta throw it away but when I look into this into the message of the hour thank God for a prophet and this is in the message earnestly contending for the faith and brother Brahm says but let's take the first two boys that was born on this Earth and then watch what he says Cain first he was supposed to have the birthright I didn't say this the prophet of God said this once again came first really he was supposed to have the birthright but he lost it just as Esau did not now it pertained to him because he was the first to open the womb if we would say the womb of Eve notice this now now the scriptures and we're gonna we're gonna back this up by scriptures this was intriguing to me because it was here the whole time but I had never looked at Cain and Abel Through The Eyes of the birthright maybe many some of you had and God bless you I'm not acting like this is the first one to ever think of this When I See This unfolding the birthright was supposed to be king but he lost it just as Esau so now when I look at Cain and Abel in regards to the birthright I want to know how Cain lost it are you with me now now come on Come With Me Now how did Kane lose the birthright you that are spiritual you'll catch it why he lost the birthright remember anything you do without faith is sin now I cannot go any farther until I realize that the birthright is connected to Redemption I can't even begin to understand what Birthright is if I don't put it together with the right to Redemption once again you got to get this birth right it's the right to Redemption now now notice this now biggest thing Satan understood that and that's why when that when when Adam he forfeited his rights through the hands the the dirty hands of Satan but say in wanting to do it his way to achieve the same thing he thought that he could that that he could just get it by placing Cain as the firstborn but watch what goes with the birthright a mom I want you to see this now as I began then going to the scripture I started making more sense the scripture that we have read for years and in process of time it came to pass that now you that are spiritual I want to see if you catch this question is that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord I was talking to some of the young young people yesterday and I said let me see if you guys can catch this they got it Noah come on watch verse four he said and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof is and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Canaan to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance fell is now now go with me here now because automatically they must have thought he was the first born that he could do whatever he wanted he could offer whatever he wanted wow you with me now notices now we can see I'm the first born I want to want to offer and give my some fruits that's what I'm gonna do is but he lacked the Revelation revelation of what the firstborn should have because it wasn't just being born it was a first born and when Kane he never offered the first fruits he only offered fruit how many are with me you got to get this he didn't offer just he didn't offer the first fruits and the type of that was not perfect to what was coming yes notice notice this now but Abel had a revelation and by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice what did he offer the Bible says he brought of the first links watch this now that's when Cain realized it is impossible to please God church we can sit here Iglesia year after year but if we don't serve God by faith and then do we worship Him can never please God required God required an innocent life as a substitute in order for the worshiper to be covered but God didn't just require blood he required the first link hello everybody I'm going to say it again he didn't just he didn't just require a lamb the Revelation was that it was the first link and the one that would offer the first link had to be the firstborn you'll understand why I say that in a moment he didn't bring that so many times today we are called upon to give God first foreign amen this is our Christmas or a Christmas present it is is a Christmas message I don't see where you're going with this with Jesus and the and the Shepherds and uh what are you doing over here because you'll never understand the New Testament without understanding we many times don't give God the first which is that in itself shows whether we are part of the Church of the firstborn or not Hello everybody we come then he must but we don't give God first we give him leftovers hello everybody hola I'm not saying to everybody and all the time I'm just saying many times in our lives we give him left over time yes or no COC when we're down and down and we're tired oh Lord oh okay well I gotta go to bed we give him leftover strength we give him leftover offerings and leftover sacrifices but in verse 4 we found that Abel gave of the firstlings okay revelation he knew that even though he was not the first to open the womb but that the real Birthright belong to him through the revelations they never had that revelation of what a firstborn was God was still willing to give Cain another chance so we see then from here Genesis 4 we jump to Genesis 5. genealogy chapter and we find out that is not mentioned in the lineage of Adams hi and even in the genealogy in the book of lukeas Cain is missing too for to God Abel was the firstborn after his death was his replacement church this is true worship this is what it is to worship God in spirit and in truth for only a first born can recognize the importance of giving to God the first and only the firstborn is given a revelation which is a gift from God and that's why you see it all the time in a church why do they have and I don't have it I don't know how's your worship hello everybody how is your worship in the Bible the firstborn usually referred to the birth order but it wasn't always the case many times it referred to the ranko say it again look at it as the birth order also referred to the rank the firstborn possessed double inheritance how many Church on the firstborn do we have the firstborn the double portions he had the leadership he had the authority this is the firstborn that's why when they would see the older brother or the one that was was considered the firstborn he had great honor in the house and he would always receive the largest part of the inheritance he was the one who succeeded the father and everyone else would respect him he told us so the word term first born the preeminent in status or he is the closest in relationship to the father think about this who man considers to be the first born always who God considers the firstborn let's take let's take Abraham from for for instance the Muslims they say that Ishmael is Abraham's first born and you argue with them you might you might try to argue with them but they have a point the whole picture but they have a point according to the flesh yes that was the first that was his first child ah okay Abraham's first born and according to the law and the inheritance should it be Ismail according to the flesh absolutely absolutely and according to the birth order but the problem with that he came through the wrong room I want you to get these types and shadows notice this now Ishmael came Ismael but he came and opened the womb of a bonds woman this is where we can find ourselves today so many even if you're if you claim to be religious what are you opening the womb of a bonds woman or of a free woman are you are you first born according to the bonds woman it is first born according to the free woman gosh I pray that you get this now is but the promised seed was to come through the free woman perilous was the first to open the womb of Sarah the freeway think about David giving you these examples so you can get your mind around out of eight boys David was what number come on quietly read your Bible yeah I'm going to read your Bible okay of eight boys David was what number he was the eight he was the youngest that's right the birthright according to the flesh then again come on see there's there's entry level trivia and then there's higher level trivia we just went up a little bit was the oldest son of Jesse Jesse aliab exactly good job you got to give one to the brother here aliab was the one who should have gotten the birthright he was the oldest there of Jesse but watch What God Says of David Psalms chapter 89 and verse 20. this was written by Ethan the Ezra Heights I have found David my servant as we as we see relation what about Joseph Jose it was the perfect type of Christ said there was not one negative thing written about Joseph yet Joseph wasn't Jacob's first born is that right amen he wasn't his firstborn yes you know your Bible because Joseph was the first opened the womb of Rachel Gabriola I want you to catch these things every male that opened at the womb Shall be Called holy think about Isaac and Rebecca she was pregnant and and you talk about having morning sickness all day sickness of poor sisters that have to go through this she had sickness all day long so she got to a place that she couldn't take it anymore Lord what's going on inside of me I believe that every believer feels the same way what is going on inside of me it seems like there's a struggle day in and day out but what what happened when the Revelation came to Earth and the Lord revealed what was going on in her yes you have two nations in thy womb there is and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people Elders Shall Serve the youngeres wow here we are first born again who was the first born oh Isaac and Rebecca Rebecca saw was the firstborn absolutely but remember here the firstborn of my children this is the founding Pastor is he made it and we give one to our founding Pastor back there hello Pops it's good to have him here with us this is what he says in other words it's written in a book it's Redemption in a book of redemption now in this book of redemption he saw was here Esau was in this book is because that was first born according to the book of redemption but God then was obligated because of his law he was obligated to redeem Esau did you get that sir uh I think I lost you okay Esau was written in a book God by his law he was obligated then to redeem Isa was there in the book now watch what he says here he was obligated watch carefully and then what the Tommy says it went over your head you must have got the same response since they were in the mother's womb he had already declared to Rebecca he had declared to the church to the woman that the older one would serve the younger oh what a Twist here but God couldn't do it can't go against his words couldn't do it unless that man is this is what he says watch it's the look oh it gets delicate because a lot of people you don't realize don't sell your Birthright Amana you think I got the birthright did you sell your Birthright and then we'll seek repentance and we'll want to come back to God it says and then God will just laugh at you you'll never be able to get to him if you sell your Birthright so Rebecca knew that under the law of God that that firstborn got the blessing so you can just see a mother you know we always ask that question right who's your favorite foreign not anybody in here okay so who's your favorite better not say it huh gotta let that one goes she had gotten a revelation and you imagine a mother looking at her two sons and it wasn't just Jacob that was the supplantern he was working with him how do I get him the birthright All These Little Things oh they're they're great so she's planning along with Jacob on how they're going to steal the birthright he was the one that God had made the promise to yeah in your womb there's two Natures but the younger Shall Serve so here she is I gotta make it happen if we would stay so focused I gotta make it happen we are number one goal in life you haven't been in church very long so yeah you don't know yours nothing to do with how long you've been in church closes your relationship with God this is what it's about it's about getting the birthright get your hands on it don't you let it go for nothing don't sell it for a million billion dollars if you give it up for anything the world has to offer get a hold of this bird I've noticed this now why would she do such a thing because she had a revelation and she understood the importance of the birthright but you'll only see the importance through the promise this is why she favored Jacob over over Esau what is this for though Esau was the first to open her womb okay God's predestination could not fail the president sells his Birthright to his younger brother we know that is that's right because the birthright didn't mean nothing to him no no no significance did you get that Birthright meant nothing to him at that point then why did he become angry like Kane and wanted to go after Jacob and kill him he realized how important the birthright is so important nothing else should matter but all these testimonies and stories that we find only pointing to one that was coming and under the inspiration Isaiah began to prophesy here we go to prophesy and he says behold a virgin shall conceived oh I'm going to say this again in another way a virgin's womb shall be opened by Emmanuel foreign you finally I think you're awake now and I'm I'm starting to feel you pull a little bit okay and here we find out in Luke 2 4 and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth and to Judea unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was the house of the house and lineage of David is to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered here we go and she brought forth her first sonito oh brother Branham says in why it had to be Shepherds oh the story is so great can you tell your neighbor right now oh neighbors story is so great that it goes over the head of so many questions to think little Jehovah laying in a Manger he had to live like a baby little Jehovah borned in a stable little Jehovah playing with children on the streets little Jehovah the teenager little Jehovah the school boy and Jehovah the mighty oh yes you took all these places and you become all of this suffer the penalty of sins to give us eternal life in other words to redeem us what a gift to the world greatest gift God ever gave to man so great was the life of our Lord Jesus Christ that the whole Bible was written of him so great was the life of our Lord Jesus Christ that even his genealogy was written three times in the New Testament in can you imagine the first one let me tell you who he is this is the book of the generations of Jesus Christ all the way to Joseph and it finishes with whom was born Jesus Jesus who is called right Cristo and that wasn't enough yes so Luke starts to pen the genealogy now from Joseph all the way back the regresso forward and he finishes with which was the son of Adam it was the son of God but then John begins to pen his genealogy and he goes back before Adam he goes back to the very beginning he says in the beginning was the words he not only is the first born Hallelujah I'm gonna say it again he not only has the birthright he is the birthright come on church I'm going to say it again he not only has the birthright he is the birthright you receive him as your personal savior into his church which is the Church of the firstbornitos watch how important this is to us Luke 2 21-23 and we read this all the time when we dedicate babe Lucas and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcision of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb Jesus and when the days of our purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord Shall be Called holy to the Lord the Bible tells us in John 3 16 that he was the only begotten of the father and through him the birthright was now extended to you and I did yes or yes oh I gotta say that again through him the birthright was extended to you and I did you mean to tell me that the birthright could be extended to someone else Romans 8 29. romance whom he did foreign what is this Birthright that we say you got to get it somebody tell me your young people anybody help me out here it goes with it what is this birthday okay some parents want to help it's very simple Yes move it simply he says what is the birthright it's the right I'm telling you the holy spirit is your Birthright that's your god-given right that Holy Ghost ought to be more important than anything else in the world more important than your prestige then your life than your job everything else you should not seize until you got it then to receive the Holy Ghost is to receive your Birthright okay okay everybody in agreement with me let me ask you a question how do you receive salvation salvation thank you how do you receive the Holy Ghost Santo wow we got a lot of we got a lot of and there's there's all parts of the puzzle how do you receive your healing did you know that the same way you receive your healing is the same way you receive the Holy Ghost it's the same way you receive salvation Salvation yes or yes this is the problem today we come to the Altar and we raise our hands Lord give me the Holy Ghost we think that it just comes like that it's a Pentecostal idea there is an order away that God has placed you to receive the Holy Ghost for you to receive the birthright to do it people do not want to go that way I'm going to tell you what it is you want to know how to receive the holy ghosts your Birthright it's the same way go and see what brother Brandon has this is in the message at Thy word Lord you'll never be safe how many you have the Holy Ghost you believe it yeah how many of you are saved salvos this is this is the prophet of God now it is you'll never be safe I don't care how hard you try you'll never be safe and receive the Holy Ghost unless giving you the answer here and nobody wants this answer that's why Satan is so adamant of stopping preachers foreign and then he says isn't that right it's a question to believe the word the word of God and the man that's preaching it isn't that right you want to receive your healing it's the same process believe God's word by his stripes and you are healed and believe the one that's preaching it to you if I were to say by his stripes you're healed how many people are sick then stand to your feet and do you believe me as I'm telling you can receive your healing in Jesus name it's not hard noise not to believe who God has is our sister back here no sir Tina I'm sorry to put you on the spot your family's been talking to her for many years I came over the other day and we talked to her yeah believe me apparently she does maybe next week I think she's going to be getting baptized that's how simple salvation is the one he has sent to unto you want the birthright leave it from the lips of someone that is preaching that has the birthright we've got something to give the people we
