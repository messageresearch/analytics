offerings thank you Lord because you always give us the best we give you the best receive honor and glory in Jesus name give an Applause to the Lord he is worthy amen y may be SE at this time we're going to have a poem by our brother Julian hill julan hill amen God bless you uh as always this poem is available in Spanish if you would like it but it's also going to be available in English because it's a little complicated so if you get confused even speaking English just ask for a copy and I can get you one uh this poem is called the anomalies the world consists of 8.1 billion people of that number 2 b173 mil1 180,000 are Christians of that that number 2,173 1880 are not Catholic Orthodox or Protestant according to recent data roughly 2 million Christians are message Believers which in percentages is 0.025% of the world's population as low it as it is this percentile is called a statistical improbability also known as an anomaly it is highly unlikely for a number in that percentile to exist which is to say that it is highly unlikely for you to exist the type of person who would base the reality on anomalistic alone is known as a non-believer they use science to try to explain the unexplainable world around them these statistics that don't make sense a Believer however sees things differently a Believer looks at anomalistic and does not see statistical improbability but the precise evidence of the Divine the hand of God in this time the times before and the times to come we are the anomalies what a compliment and encouragement to know that our manifestation is quote highly unlikely however scientists still find room for doubt in the mathematics of chance and likelihood in odds an odd is simply the extent to which something is probable but With God all things are possible though the devil tries to manipulate mathematics and science to his whim God is the creator of them as is evident in his word and expressed in his numerology what man calls chance the believer calls by its synonym the odds or the expectation therefore the prospect of God is more than the likelihood of a future event it is the it is Hope and confidence in what is to come the odds of the Lord are not the ratio between the amounts stated by the parties to bet implying a failure to those who agree with him but is evidence of the different unusual and strange to the world we are unexpected to God we are the expectation what is the expectation of God and His Thoughts peace and not of evil to give us an expected end and the hope of his righteousness with his expectation becoming our own is gladness unashamed boldness and the magnification of Christ in our bodies by life or by death it is the knowledge and wisdom unto our souls it is rest goodness to do justly love mercy and walk humbly that all Grace May abound that we will have all sufficiency to every good word to show us Great and Mighty things established with light shining upon us always to move mountains to restore dry bones to love and speak words of everlasting life among other things the world cannot understand this they cannot understand us and more importantly they cannot understand God they use math science and even theologies to attempt to do so but he cannot be intellectually conceived he is intimately known inside the heart therefore unless they know God they cannot know the anomalies for the anomalies are more than evidence of the highly unlikely but are better placed as the absolute outcome of God's predestination thus even even when examining math it is more unreasonable to believe that we are not divinely placed by the hand of God than to believe the very existence of the True Believer is divine intervention we do not reason our way into faith for by reason we can come out of it by faith we can go in we believe in the perfect plan of God which has and will always have a 100% probability of success which to man is considered statistically impossible With God all things are possible behold the anomalies the nearly impossible people that as time goes on only become more improbable we are the walking evidence of God that the world has dismissed him the court of public opinion and what of it why should we care about what the world thinks when we have the word of God which is not an opinion but the truth though they attempt to Tower over him with their Babel they will never come as close to him as us the only ones who can come up higher are his people his children who are The Chosen the anomalies those who despite the division are multiplied despite the faction fractionalization have been made whole those who the who in the equation of mortality had their memory subtracted while sin was added only for Christ to subtract the sin and add himself as the missing variable implementing the equation of restoration this is the math of God the expectation the ultimate conclusion become a part of him be the anomaly the difference the outlier the evidence the unexplainable the incomprehensible the undeniable the unshakable the odd one out the unexpected The Peculiar the abnormal and above all the expectation do the impossible for you are the impossible the very life in you is evidence that the impossible can be possible who is the enemy to tell us what can and can't be done who are they to say that it cannot be done again in a world of problems you are God's solution God bless you amen God bless our brother Julian for that enjoy that did y'all enjoy that let's go ahead and sing that song I just want to be where you are cuz where he is all things

sing that song to introduce our brother this [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me me be oh me be [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh me for [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen the song says I want to serve you with all my heart with everything that I have how many can say Amen to that tonight aren't you happy to be in the house of the Lord I consider it such a a great privilege to be up here again and people say well the pastor called you all of a sudden there's no such thing with me is all of a sudden anymore I I just want to be ready whether it is to preach the word pick up my brother that's fallen down give him encouragement go visit somebody in the hospital maybe you don't get patted on the back for those things but God who is rich in Mercy he extends his Mercy through his children like greet each one here and all the visitors here and online to help God's people you see that title is a little rough isn't it cutting off the trail of the serpent in your life amen praise the Lord and we're going to go to our first scripture in Numbers Chapter 14 num and here Moses is speaking to God the people have rebelled against Jehovah and it looks like God's going to destroy them and wipe them off the map but there's a man that stands up named Moses so I want you to keep this in mind under Moses they came out of Egypt and they were baptized in the sea type of justification they went into the Wilderness which is a type of sanctification and then as they journeyed on in their lives they came up to the Borderland where they had to cross over into the Promised Land which is a type of the Holy Spirit my we're going to see how that in this process of the new birth how these complexes hit us in justification sanctification we're going to be going back over just a little bit what we hit about what three weeks ago a month ago or something like that but I wanted to use this example here verse 11 states and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be air to they believe me for all the signs which I have showed unto them I will Smite them with pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a great nation and mightier than they can you imagine Moses if he was full of himself excuse the expression he was oh boy he's going to disinherit them and he's going to make me greater than them Moses was a type of Christ he knew that without the his brothers and sisters that none of them would make it what a tremendous thing God spoke to him and Moses said unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou brought us up this people in thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou art Lord among the people that thou art Lord art seen face to face and that thy Cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by daytime in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of Fire by night oh my goodness Moses is standing in the bridge here now if Thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the Nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the Lord was not able to bring them this people into the land which he swear to them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness I believe Moses took this personal he could see what the peoples of Egypt would say about his God that he was not able to bring them to the promised land let us pray before we continue Lord Jesus we thank you tonight for this Grand opportunity Lord to speak Thy word to your children Lord May It Be You Lord not Jimmy alire no Jimmy alire May Jimmy Aly just be dead like an old crystallized serpent on the pole Lord no life In Me Lord but the life of your word and your spirit believe your word Lord thank you Lord in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen may be seated let's continue with verse 17 now here's the spirit of Christ in Moses now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great according as thou H has spoken saying that the Lord is longsuffering of great Mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the fourth third and fourth Generations in other words he can forgive he can have mercy but there is a trail of iniquity has come from the beginning of time and even though has Mercy on those people there that trail of the serpent continues on now for our new people I want to make sure you get this the word tra a marked or established path a trace or Mark left by something that has passed when it pertains to your life we're not going to go into what the trail of the serpent is actually the prophet never preached that message literally he mentions it in six messages all preached in 1965 hee he he preaches it in the power of transformation he he preaches it in God's only provided place of worship he preaches it in in leadership he pictures it th shall possess the gates of his enemy six different times he mentions this Trail of the serpent from the beginning he says and when I go home this time I'm going to preach on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end and Trail him through the Bible and show how he heads up and he goes in how cunning that fellow is the serpent not just an animal that Satan used to inject himself into Humanity that's what happened in the beginning and that's why to you new people if you don't truly understand how the fall came and how the devil injected himself into you or the human race you'll never truly understand why you need to be born again it's so easy to understand if we'll put on our spiritual caps that we were born the wrong way the first time under the permissive will of God we're not going to go into that but the religious world today doesn't want to face this reality of what happened in the Garden of Eden and how many knows they ate apples that's a religious Fable we're not going to go there but we're going to show you how when Satan mixed himself into Humanity it degenerated man from a son of God to just an animal just a mamal walking upon the face of the Earth without any purpose without realizing why God had put him on Earth do you know why God put you on this Earth praise the Living God so how does that trail of the serpent come to you in your life how did Sin what is sin and and what the word today they don't believe the Bible oh man has interpreted it so many times you can't trust it but what they don't realize that God is big enough to keep his own word that's why when God told Moses I'm going to make you great I'm going to make you greater than them I'm going to take away the inheritance from them and I'm going to make you the main guy he knew better than that because he stood in the bridge and brother Benham said this was the first time that God truly listened to the voice of a man Moses said don't destroy them have mercy upon them show that you are a great God so that you can bring them all the way into the promised land oh he knew how God was great he knew God kept his word Jeremiah 1112 says heever hasten over his word to bring it to pass oh what does that mean to you and me tonight that means he's more eager to fulfill his word than we are for him to fulfill it and if he hastens and watches over his word make sure that it fell into our hands in a pure form so that he could stand up and say heaven and earth will pass away but this my words will never pass away this my word will judge you at the last day how could he judge us if his word was not in a pure form and why did God send a prophet like unto Moses in this time stand in the bridge just like Moses did here when God was ready to just eradicate the whole human race there was a man that had Christ in him in the office of the prophet of the age to stand because he saw that there was a a bride that had come forth from the very spiritual gen of God that's why brother never tried to raise himself up I'm just your brother nobody great it's not about me it's not about you it's about him in us notice that not just him but it's about him in you he can't lose one of you he loses one of you he loses part of himself praise the Lord Jesus that's not in the notes that's okay what else is new now remember in our last message on the complex of humanity we went into justification and we found out that when we're justified by faith in the finished works of Calvary God cuts off our past sin could we put up the first picture up there for me please the ones we used last time once again my art is not that good but you get the point and that's a heart that's the heart of the Sinners it's all full of those that those black dots represent of all the sin and mistakes and everything that we've done wrong in our life but that guy in the middle there that Fallen nature that serpent that inter wol himself into you and me because the iniquity of our fathers and forefathers went from one generation to the next generation to the Next Generation and as the scripture says my mother conceived me in iniquity I came into the world speaking lies to begin with you didn't have a chance you were lost I was lost I was in this condition as an unbeliever that's what a sinner is because I didn't even know what God's word had to say about his plan for my life looks looks very Bleak doesn't it give me the next picture oh when you repent and are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you are Justified your past sins are cut off and as we heard last time out of future home he just cut off your sin now he didn't cut off the trail of the serpent yet we got to we got to take this a step at a time we were Justified we found out that was to be declared innocent by the blood of the Lamb that when God looks at us through the red blood through our Crimson sin red through red is white he does not see our sin anymore he declares us Innocent by the sufficient sacrifice of calary and brother says you're you're Justified it is as though you never sinned to begin with I I want you to catch that real good do you knew people my precious brother got baptized Sunday welcome my dear brother oh you're just beginning my brother yes it's it's going to get gooder and good it's going to get better and better as the days go by notice as though you never sinned but brother benam says even though he forgave your sin cut off your sins the thing that made you do it is still in there that's why it is that as though you never sined because in this part of the process of the new birth there's still a part of you that sins that gets touchy don't it you're Justified but later on as we go through this process we overcome all these complexes do you know what you need to do under justification you say why brother Jimmy jimy because as of yet when you're just Justified you have no literal evidence yet that you have changed there you turned around in your life God called you you had your back to God you were going the way of the enemy wanted you to go you didn't about face you turned your back on Satan and the things of the world get to face God are you with me let's continue the next picture Sanctified before we get into this one I want to go to our next scripture in First Peter amen chapter one and we're going to start with verse one now we all know that this word Sanctified means cleansed and set aside for service but you might say well what does that mean how does that work because under sanctification when you are cleansed and there's no longer any evil spirits or Desires in you you're empty remember how we said that last time and we mentioned the scripture in second Peter last time that says to make your calling and your election sure how many want to make your calling and election sure does anybody remember what we said the calling does he deals with your conscience he get makes you feel bad for your condition for the sin in your life to such a point that you no longer want to be that way you're disgusted with the things that are in your life the trail of the serpent came into you through a wrong seed through the seed of the serpent which is a false word amen amen so under cons under making your calling sure he dealt with your conscience and when you got baptized we saw in First Peter 3 it was an answer of a good conscience towards God it wasn't there yet God's not there yet but it was an answer he called you answered because it was your conscience that was woke up now you care about your relationship with God now it hurts you if you disobey God it hurts you if you offend your brother your sister your wife your husband before you could have cared less but that conscience that answered proved there was something down in that Soul it was a germ from the beginning oh it wasn't the seed because the seed is the word of God but it was the spiritual feminine part of what you are notice how I said that spiritually speaking you had the spiritual egg of the word already predestinated in you what you need now is the germ of the Holy Ghost to dze that and bring forth a new birth we can go into those things more but how many understand how many the young people can more or less get that there was something in you you didn't understand what it was I didn't understand what it was when I was a 12y old boy and I would be about to do something and and something would speak to me not necessarily an audible voice and I would get scared and I would go home when I got a little older I didn't go home you know what I mean right but it was that it was what brother BR called representation by predestination because we are a part of the feminine part of God we are his bride later on we'll get into those things but now let's go here and see now under election he's not going to deal with our conscience so much he's going to deal with our subc conscience he's going to deal with our soul he's going to dive into our soul and he's going to begin to take out everything that Satan has put in there everything that he has perverted because it's a fallen nature and how many remember what is the soul what is the soul the nature of what does your spirit to you that didn't know what your soul was now you do praise the Living God now how many want to see if you're elected not that he's going to elect you right now how many want to see if you're already El 1 2 3 oh my goodness you don't want to know if you're elected I tell you when the Great Tribulation comes I don't want to be here you know why I don't want to even go there I'll lose another 10 minutes now let's go to the scriptures here in first in Peter chapter one we going actually start with verse two elect according to the foreign knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit and San now what's he going to do he's going to drive the nature of that serpent out of you through sanctification not to elect you but to manifest that election you'll never know whether you're elected or not unless you go through this process sanctification of the spirits it's the spirit that's taking all these filthy desires out of you and of me he's giving us a new desire he's creating in us a new desire elected according to the foreign knowledge of god let's say that together elected according to the for knowledge of God do you really believe that I believe it so no matter what it takes I want to make my calling and my election sure now as he begins to tear me apart come on now and he begins to dismantle all the works of the devil in my life now he's going to put me back together the way Adam was put together oh my I don't want to go there and I didn't even notice what time we start started oh 7:30 okay cuz I used to be faster but then I got so fast every right oh what did he say said a lot of things man lost what did you get out of it uh oh maybe my old a older age is helping me a little bit go a little slower so make sure you're with me right elected to the for knowledge of God through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multip W how many want that that Grace to be multiplied in you know in Zariah says The Headstone shall come forth with acclamations of grace and grace unto in Spanish it says her in English it says unto it but in Spanish it says unto her do you know where the first acclamation came forth from from heaven when the Lord himself descended from heaven with a shout a message of Grace but the other Grace was the echo of the grace that was in heaven and the second acclamation of Grace comes forth nowto you Grace unto her unto the bride oh now it's answering back PE Grace unto her aren't you happy for that grace verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead I want to switch to Spanish here because it says it different in English and it does in Spanish when it says to uh beget us again again our our first uh begotten when we're born of our father and mother in holy matrimony we know we come formed in iniquity but now in sanctification when the heart is now clean when your spirit is now clean now the word the word can be begotten inside of your heart and that will bring a regeneration when the Holy Spirit quickens that word that is begotten in your heart that's what begins to cut the trail of the serpent that begins to cut it off right there it doesn't come by that trail anymore did you get it how many times have you seen people come to the Lord they give their heart to the Lord baptized and after a while what happens they go back and do some of the things they did before does that condemn them are we going to just kick them and kick them out no we're going to pick them up realized that the trail of the serpent that came through their life that came through their genealogy that came through their family tree still hasn't been destroyed it still hasn't been cast out of the human heart you got to die I got to die to that old nature under justification let's go back as we approach sanctification the hardest thing it will be for you to do my brother and my sister is to believe what God's word says about you more than what you know about yourself that's the whole thing that all depends whether it ever comes to where the Serpent's Trail can be cut off and all the curses that have come upon you that have come upon your family you can be regenerated wow getting awful milk here here verse four to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fth not away reserved in the heaven for you it's reserved in heaven I ask what heaven you get it Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I just don't want to visit there once in a while I want to learn how to live there in heaven he's preserved it he's preserved it Greek word says to such a place it'll never Escape you how can it Escape you if you're following the plan of God for your life give me that first quote amen out of the message revelation of Jesus Christ after he laid his hands upon them talking about the apostles here they were then after being saved and Sanctified they were filled with the Holy Ghost water blood spirit there are three that agree in your Earth I'm going to say it that way if you say three agree on Earth which Earth your Earth they agree in one they are not one you can be justified without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified without being filled with the Holy Ghost one must born of the water and of the spirit and that's not water baptism excuse me be a type of it I'm not saying anything against that it's the water washing of the Water by word the only way you're going to believe more what God says about you once you're Justified is to be constantly feeding yourself the word of God every day of your life not on Wednesday not just Sunday you are walking in the word every day the only way you're to believe what God says you are and you're not going to do that just on Wednesday oh what we get on Wednesday and Sunday 100% quality what better Pastor could we have is he really the pastor no it's the Holy Ghost in him but he's using that office but what office is he using in you oh there's only one pastor we understand did you know all of you have a Ministry sir how to start you brother Tommy Caleb the pastor founding Pastor that's a denominational World they put all the Holiness behind the pulit they put all the sacredness behind the pulpit they forget the god of the audience that the people must be holy for I am Holy how are you going to be holy without the Holy Spirit why am I mind I'm starting to feel pretty young I'm starting to feel pretty good you said one of these days Jim you're going to do it so much you're going to probably just drop dead right in the Pulpit what an honor be in my post of Duty preaching the word God calls me home he'll raise up somebody else and I'll be in the other dimension come on brother preach it don't give up never give up praise the Living God think there's some power here huh the Greek word damos shall receive d power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you amen amen Jesus come to wash and to cleanse and sanctify the church that he might come and live in and with his own blood he gave his own God born blood that he might cleanse us from our sexual birth there's nothing wrong with speaking about this if we have clean Minds we know that matrimony is the only place for that we know that in the beginning it never was used right better not go there I got some good stuff on that but we'll be here another hour and I Mage he's got to cleanse us from this natural thing this sexual birth that that perverted that was born in sinap iniquity came this world why does he do that he does that under sanctification so you're empty oh yeah of all the things of the world but now the words the seed that you were supposed to be in the beginning is begotten in you now the real you is going to be born would you like to meet the real you you how many would like to to know the real youth how many of you are already knowing your real new well I think I already know who he is and he's not an Earthbound creature a creature of Eternity you are a creature of Eternity came from eternity we will go back to Eternity we are not just anybody we are the manifestation of the for knowledge of God oh my goodness I've already been going an hour no no no 42 minutes oh I scared myself it's easy to lose track at time up here praise the Lord Jesus this is what happens in sanctification you're begotten a new have you would you ever hear a message like this in the denominational world we don't have nothing against them a lot of us came out of there we love the people we love the people we try to get this message to them because it's much more than just accepting Jesus as your savior but until he becomes Lord possessor of every fiber of your being and the scripture says that no man can call Jesus Lord except by the Holy Ghost then he has control of you then he has he is Lord of every aspect of your life amen amen glory to God glor so how many have continued to believe of our new people how many of you continue to believe how many read your Bible at home how many you listen to the message at home very well how many are becoming the message then you must read my Bible then I must read your Bible not written on paper with ink now but written by the holy ghost in the heart of man the living Bible the fourth Bible are you happy let's go to our next quot quote out of you must be born again how many have read this message what are you done then after you have been died then what are you to do then you're conceived a new not a natural conception now to bring a natural baby conceived in the word to bring forth a son and daughter of God you are conceived a new you

been recreated again oh my no wonder this old natural birth no more drag you go all over the place wonder why this old birth old nature can no longer drag you all over the place because he has recreated you again from what you were the image of a Son of God and a daughter of of God it's just such an it's the greatest miracle that that ever happened when a sinner can be made to become a Christian what's the greatest Miracle when you're recreated regenerated that's why water baptism does not regenerate it remits your sins it sends them back to the originator of what made the sin letter comes to your house with somebody else's name on [Music] it live here anymore remit it back to him but now under regeneration he seals the deal he recreates you and this is what cuts off the trail of the serpent he's not going to be buzzing around like a beer with no Stinger because he lost that finger when he put it into Christ brother Bren oh he can make a lot of noise he can try to bring up things of your own life you what in the world are you talking about I don't remember people say well you cannot forgive and forget are you sure about that well I was in charge of the mission here 30 years ago whatever all the people were new my wife would sometimes see some of the things the brothers did to me and she would come tell me how can you let him get away with that and I go honey they're they're they're new honey don't be born one of these days they won't do it again oh I already forgave them and I already forgot about it and I'm going to treat them as though they never did it to begin I love the people do you love the people once you're regenerated and the Holy Ghost enthrones itself in that little room in your heart that trail of the serpent the Holy Spirit comes in and he blows out loud and he erases the trail of the serpent now if the serpent wants to come through there he can't even find his own trail Lord Jesus we thank you Lord as we stand to our feet
