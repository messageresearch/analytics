[Music] spoke course to brother Tommy I speak every day every service so but uh God has sure been good amen let's just read a scripture real quick and then I I'll have you be seated for it's found in First Peter 5 put my glasses on 1 Peter 58 when you have it you can say Amen then it reads be be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil a roaring lion did I read that right your adversary as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour so we find out right there he's already a bluffer amen amen he's not a lion but as so he's a bluffer right there amen you may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated just just before I get started I want to read a Thanksgiving and it reads last week brother AB came to my house to light the furnace when he did the furnace turned on as expected but I was waiting for the blower to work [Music] it turned on and the blower worked beautifully uh it says what what brother Abe didn't know was that the city had come to light it a week before and and it turned on but didn't blow any air and the city worker told me to see a plumber brother a and I had both prayed and it worked my my power of prayer amen I was very thank thankful because this had happened before and God came through and rebuked the devour and my Second Blessing was I had been praying about wood for the wood burner but I couldn't get what I was looking for so I prayed and put it in God's hand on Monday evening I received an unexpected call from Sister Abby and brother Aaron asking if I was home because they had some wood to deliver I was so excited they both came with their children and we fellowship and brother Aaron stacked the wood who would have known I was truly grateful and thankful to the Lord and to them as well as brother Abe for the furnace and the King shall answer and say unto them verely I say unto you in so much as as you have ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me my my God is sure good amen that was from our our sister Bertha so it doesn't matter the situation whatever we need if we believe in our heart and we pray unto God believing anything is possible amen amen just just a a thought I have [Music] here you know I I I I was thinking the the other day and you know we we we have a journey that we're on you know and and and and our walk with God it's not an easy one as you could say you could probably say it's not a walk in the park you know but but I but but I was thinking and this is just me myself you know every time I I I I I I get up here and I Minister the first word that come out of my mouth is I'm not worthy and and of course I understand how I'm saying it because it's God that has made me Worthy but when I say I'm not worthy then the devil can hear me so so I get up here and I say I'm not worthy and we all know who the Devil Is Right are we know what Satan means Satan means the accuser so so he's going to accuse us any way he can you know so so I I I myself giving him ammunition to use against me by saying I am unworthy but but I am worthy and you are worthy you are worthy of every promise that God has that promised to you but that's where Satan comes in he he uses three things against us one is deception one he likes to accuse and then the third he lik it's condemnation so so as we see in the beginning as far as deception from the very beginning In the Garden of Eden he used deception and he told her no you will not die so it started there but we know Satan is a liar he's a he's a deceiver and he's a murderer yes he's a murderer but he's trying to kill us and kill me every single day by trying to say I am not worthy by trying to say you are not worthy trying to say look at what you've done you've done this and this and this you've done this but it doesn't stop there because there's an accusation but there's always there's always another side to it it's like when you go to to to trial and you have the the the one side I gu you could say would be a the state if you committed a crime and then say I I would be like a defendant and and they have to prove every accusation against you so my accusation is I'm a sinner okay I'm an unbeliever I've been accused of this but we have an intercessor we have an intercessor that will step in and he says you know what you've accused him of this this and that but I forgave him my blood covers that he he wants to accuse us every single day the the the the the the the journey I said are actually it's rather a battle right we we we battle every single day because the enemy we face he's a fierce enemy he he's Fierce he he keeps on and he's trying to find and find ways to steal and destroy God's plan for you and I he he he he's trying to keep us from it but one day there was a man called Jesus and he went on that cross and he died on that cross and he covered blood came down to each and every one of us it covered our sins and it and and it kept us but that still doesn't stop the devil he wants to as brother Jerry said Jerry he wants to put fear in US that's one of his greatest weapons is to put fear in you and I you know because because I I was reading something or I I I came across this let me see if I could find it but it it it was kind of it was like a a riddle anyway I I I believe I can remember it but but anyway in this riddle it started off that a man left home or ran from home and he walked a little bit and then he went to the left and then he he ran from home a little bit again kept running he ran a little bit more and then he turned left and then he ran a little bit more and then he turned left okay the question is asked is is why did he run from home I'll ask you that why did he why was he running from home the the first thing we want to think of is that there's some crazy guy at home trying to to do something to us right because that's what the devil wants to do he wants to to he wants our imaginations to run wild he he he wants us to think the worst he wants us to think that oh this is really horrible but then the guy he as as he's talking to the people and he says well think of it as baseball he ran from home he ran to first he ran to second he ran to third he ran home and the two masked men waiting for him were the capture in the Empire so there was nothing wrong but right away the devil wants to put thoughts that that oh my gosh the the worst of the worst is going to happen like I said Jesus died on the cross he died for you and I we don't need to think those thoughts because in this battle that's that's where it is right here but if we have him in our heart if we have the love of Jesus in our heart can push all those thoughts aside but we got to fill up with something we just can't fill up with anything we can't fight the devil with just anything but we got to fight him with the word of God we got to come at him with the word of God I cannot fight him sitting down hearing music all day long I cannot fight him sitting down watching things we shouldn't be watching I cannot fight him when I have a conversation with somebody and I'm using words that I shouldn't be using because that's what he wants you know we we we we we need to be a separate people we live in this world we have to deal with the world but we cannot act like the world we got to carry ourselves different to act better and and and and keep your nose in the air no but we are children of God the question comes then what think ye of Christ what think you of Christ what think what do I think of Christ if I'm out there talking like I'm not supposed to listening to things I'm not supposed to doing the things I'm not supposed to acting like I'm not supposed to then how am I going to turn somebody that knows I'm a Christian how am I going to go back and testify to that person we can't be the same we got to be different we got to have the love of God in our lives we got to have the word in our heart amen in Romans R 34 33 and it says here who shall aay lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that he is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who is at the right hand of God but if you read in Zechariah 31 who's at the right hand right there and he said and he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him so Satan's there every step of the way also and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuke thee Oh Satan even the Lord that had chosen Jerusalem rebuke rebuke thee it is not this a brand plucked is not this a brand plucked out of the fire now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away the filthy garments from him and unto him he said behold I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and I will clothe thee with change of rayment it's the Lord also he has a better plan for you and I Satan has a a terrible plan he he wants to keep us from the word of God he wants to keep us from our Salvation he wants to keep us from the blessings God has a better plan the Lord Jesus Christ has a better plan for you and I the blessings are for us that that we would want we can have it do we have money in the bank do you have money in the bank I can tell you right now if you have money in the bank you can grab it right now and it's yours your healing is yours your salvation is yours the devil has no claim to this property anymore the devil not your property no more the devil we're not your property anymore we get you now he had me bound up and he had a chain and he was pulling me brother Bram says we get that chain now put in the corner we say don't move Satan this mind you might want to put a seat of doubt in it but the heart here it belongs to God the the heart that I have it is yours Lord we got to think that way we we got to act different like I said right it it it it's hard sometimes as a Christian I understand that very hard sometimes especially as young men as young ladies but even the the the the elderly the older I don't want to say you're old but we are getting older but the same goes for us we got to be careful we got to guide our steps we got to pray one for another we cannot talk about one another the time for playing games is over we're not children anymore we've matured we got to keep on keeping on as brother Ben starts to come up I leave you with this what is the biggest thing the devil fears it's a Fearless you and I we got to be Fearless we can't let him push us around anymore we can't can't let him take what's ours we can't let him take the joy of our Salvation anymore we can't let him we got to fight him and we fight him with this we fight him with God's word we fight him with the messages we don't fight him with our with our bad thoughts we don't fight fight him with our bad bad things we don't fight him with our bad language we fight him with God's word amen God bless [Applause] you man God bless you been you man and you sure have been hearing good word amen so I put the title of this message that the Lord led to this is what I've been waiting for my whole life I I want you to grasp this in the middle of all that we see all around us in the middle of chaos everything that's been preached to us everything that we've been taught leads to right now you know and many times brother Caleb comes and gives us last Wednesday some [Music] words and everybody's heart drops everybody gets scared but this is what we've been waiting for we've talked about this day but you know what I figured one thing this church has the worst the worst repeat with me the worst sports fans don't we we have the worst sports fans you know we we we we watch TV on Sunday right you watch all these sports that's that's happening this whole world is watching and every time a ball gets dropped what happens have the odds right ah every time a touchdown happens what you have ex exactly it depends on the team but you see what I'm saying you guys are the worst SP fans ever I remember when the Eagles won Super Bowl I saw Noah he was running through the house and he was going flying like he was an eagle so we're the worst sports fans right you know if we take it to if we really believe what we believe how would we act if we knew that we were a son or daughter of God very very disappointing we don't have to talk a lot tonight but are we really God's children come on church are we really his children [Applause] because you know what what's been taught in this place is that we are not therometer Christians you know what a thermometer Christian is Thermometer so what happens if your temperature around you is hot then you're hot if if it's good around you then you feel good but if it's if you're lonely around if everything's lonely around you then you're lonely but the prophet of God teaches us something to be therat Christians that we got to set the temperature so that's why Church this is the day this is what I long for this is my day so why are you going to be sad why are you going to be lonely why are you going to be scared God called us for this day let us get into the word now we're ready for God's word because we forget who we are we're children of God we're that Royal priest what he talks about for that chosen generation let us turn to the book of Deuteronomy chapter chapter 4:32 and it reads like this ask now ask now of the days that are passed which were before you which were before thee since the day that God created man on the earth and asked from one side of Heaven the other whether there have been any such thing as great as this thing or have you anything be I'm sorry or have been heard like it you know this word this word excites me because he said ask now but then he it seems like he's making us go back he said ask now what has happened already so what does that tell you church he says it was before you but maybe we didn't recognize it maybe we were scared he said ask now because what happens he says you look from one side of Heaven to the other and you see if there's any been a day like this you you say what what are we looking for we're looking to go home church that's where we're at we're at that cuff right now it's time to go home so why does Fear come in because what happens we put fear in the place of urgency if the coming of God if it's at hand where's the sense of urgency if he's coming tomorrow where's the sense of urgency or are we all ready to go home cuz I'm telling you church if we're not ready you better get ready you know I was imagining the day that Noah's Ark was being closed I was thinking maybe the people were just watching it close maybe they could have ran and got up but they had no sense of urgency they didn't care what was going on it began to get common to them oh that's just Noah again now he's closing the door but little did they know that God was shutting the opportunity God was shutting the chest that they were going to be saved so he said look to the left then look through Heaven there's been no day like today the opportunity that we have we have it in our hands it's in our Gras we could almost touch the coming of the Lord but where is the urgency where is the church and I got to preach this to myself you think our pastors run ragged right now why he's going all over the world trying to find that one you have men that have backed him up you think it's easy for these men to go they have businesses they have families every time I'm sure when brother Mark leaves his business takes the hit cuz he's not there to run a brother will call me all these men what are they doing the sense of urgency our pastor doesn't care how he feels we got to take this gospel take it to Norway Poland he said let's start lighting fires everywhere but what about here church is the fire going to be lit inside of us I want that fire I want it lit inside of me why Church to preach the gospel to spread the good news Hallelujah it's time it's time we think it's a joke I I remember our founding pastor always telling us he said one day we're gonna come and you're going to say why is this brother gone why is half the church gone and he says you won't even know what happened that's where we're at so this is is what I've been waiting for my whole life this is what because in this scripture if you go to verse 30 let's start with verse 29 he says but from then Thou shalt seek the Lord thy God thou sh not find Thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all your heart with all your soul when there are tribulations and all these things have have come upon thee even in the latter days that's this day if th turn to the Lord [Music] but he said now ask ask now he says cuz what you keep on reading the Scriptures it says where have you ever seen a man go up to a burning bush and him see that fire he come face to face with the pillar of fire he says and live he says Where have you seen he says look in all Heaven you have never seen this he's trying to wake them up he says because something happened he says you go back the scripture says go back all the way to Abraham someone stood someone stood for this seed he said someone St for you you were that seed that Abraham stood for you were that promise he said now look you see it anywhere else he said no you don't see it because many times we take for granted the lineage that we come from but but I I have some nuggets here I'm to use your nugget brother I'm going to use yours de it was too good for you not to hear this brother Abraham he's telling us about the seed that you belong to sharing it with the African Ministry because so many times if we were just realize who we were we would be the best sports fans in here juming up and down we feel like the woman at the well but here here he's telling us he says when Abraham through Hagar is he says when it came to pass he says Sarah was kicked off in Camp Sarah told Abraham you take Hagar and you take that child and you kick them out of Camp so you go into Genesis and it tells you it here comes Hagar comes that child gives him water he says you're going to have to leave so they're going in the desert Water Runs Out they're at the point of death and Hagar puts the baby under a bush I cannot see this lord I can't see this baby die she begins to cry to the Lord she begins to cry she said Lord you got to do something me and the baby are going to die she was on her KNE she was begging to the Lord but the Lord the Lord heard her cry but the minute that that baby cried it woke got up and he showed Hagar turn around there's water right there you take it and you give to that baby but why did God respond to the baby because that was still the Seed of Abraham it wasn't the promise seed but how much more you're the seed of AB how much more will God answer your prayers how much more will he respond because why the scripture was being made manifest because why when you are in that will the prophet of God says then you have scriptural Authority because why on that day of Pentecost they were up in that they were waiting he said you wait here in the city of Jerusalem until you're ued with power but they were human just like me and you maybe they said brother Isaac we've been here nine days maybe we got to go go find it somewhere maybe another brother said we got to do this but the prophet of God says but Peter stood the scripture says we have to wait until we're indued power and then maybe John stood up and he said everything Jesus talked about it was something powerful it was going to be a mighty power that we were to receive so they waited but one day something happened that word became manifest and when they saw the word come to pass that was the scripture of authority that they waited for and that's when that rushing Mighty wi came down and they covered them but what happen church we do not want to take the word and let it take its place inside of us we don't want to let that happen now let's go to the Book of Jeremiah I'm sorry brother God's word is powerful amen Jeremiah 29 verse 20 verse 9 this is good church you know I never understood Jeremiah but when you study Jeremiah reminds me a lot of John because he always leaned on God he would speak to God like if he was Adam in the Garden of Eden say stuff like Lord I can't do nothing unless I lean upon you but here he says verse Jeremiah 20 ver9 change then I said I will not make mention nor speak any more of his name hold on this is God's Prophet the same one that brought prophet prophecy upon prophecy he says I'm not even going to make mention of his name where was he where was he had he given had he given up you begin to read and you began it looks like he's beginning to lose his mind it begins to look like he's throwing in the towel maybe he preached too much but he was so in a such a depression because God's people would not follow the scripture says they were in a bad shape of idol they began to forget who they were they for forgot where they came from they forgot who God even was and the prophet was a blushing Prophet also he says but his name I won't say no more but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones even though he wanted a quit even though he wanted a quit there was something inside of him that began to go all the way through the marrow of his b and it was the power that came with that word that even though he wanted to quit God says you're not going to quit because when you take God and his word and you're his seed it begins to do something because the prophet of God says that Moses he went to the burning bush the burning bush took him in but then he took that burning bush in because this it's not us just taking and taking and getting wrapped up in his word it's nice to have the beautiful musicians it's nice to have the best pastor we could ever ask for to have the best Ministry to have the best youth to have the best doesn't so good that's not what we for come for to receive that Holy Ghost if you could only realize Church show me you look through the right side of Heaven to the left side of Heaven show me where off this is happening are you see brother are we better than everybody no no I ain't going to make it without them so why am I going to want to be better than them but the difference is this word it's mine and when it comes and it comes inside of you then it's all shot up in my bones begin to take over and it might tell you oh I don't want to go to Norway I don't want to go to Poland it says you're going to PO you're going here you're going there brother you're going there brother you believe it because why shut up in our bones word begins to take over and we begin to see everything that our found Pastor told us get the word inside of you get that word inside of you stand to your feet Church God's word does something spectacular to us and you might say brother it doesn't scare you I'm human just like you are of course it's SC but somewhere deep inside of us we know that the word that we've received here has made us ready we have dressed ourselves in God's word and there's nothing that's going to stop us now so this is what I've been waiting for my whole life church this is it brother Al this is it you that have been following this message year after year it's finally going to pay off we are going to
