the world's hungry for the world wants to see something genuine that's what's the matter these conversions that's a circle they're not real conversions it's interaction there's an intellectual knowledge of Christ but a born-again experience gives the real crime aunt America is people who have to be entertained they've got too much television in them they weren't entertainment they then find the old-fashioned gospel they said we can go over here it isn't so rough we can do what we want to go ahead but I see fear in mob you know that's true Oh God least that's the church God offer do you Harbor truth as the hymn desert brood but you would not you listen to man leaders instead of the Holy Spirit leaders you listen to man teachers instead of gods teacher the Holy Ghost we would teach you behavior make you behave yourself nice may give you lady life make you the salt of the earth the salt creates a thirst and man appears to be like you if you really live the Christian life you can't do it in yourself you've got the head of Christ in you to do it the world is what with some genuine that's the reason they see people that claim to be something and going out acting like the rest the world that's what calls communism to rise in Russia or to town the Catholic Church dr9 claiming to be something and has no morning accident done just like the world no more than any other Lodge not only Catholic but Protestant just as bad and it's come down home to the Pentecostals acting dressed in fashion and looking talking spiced even making fun and different that's rough but it's good for you the truth but that's reason the world can't see nothing genuine when the people comes to a place that they forget all the little differences and the love of God will shed abroad in our hearts by the real teacher the Holy Ghost you'll become salty and the world will want to be like you you create a creation around you you've seen people you couldn't stand to be around yet they were nice people they create that within themselves you've seen people you love to be with because they create that atmosphere around them your spirit your soul you can't hide it you can't make believe
