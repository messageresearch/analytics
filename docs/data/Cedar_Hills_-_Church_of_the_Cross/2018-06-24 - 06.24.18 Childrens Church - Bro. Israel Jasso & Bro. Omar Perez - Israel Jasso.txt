we're gonna welcome my brother Israel hah so are you excited too [Applause] [Music] well when [Music] [Music] god bless you our first I would like to thank my pastor for letting me be here today in this place so I could talk to you a little bit about the story of David and Goliath and so if you at all please turn into your scriptures First Samuel chapter 17 verse 36 and 37 when you have it can you please say Amen thy servants through both the lion and the bear and the uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he has defied the armies of the Living God david says moreover the Lord that delivered me are the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of the hand of the Philistine and saw said unto David go and the Lord be with thee can you please bow your heads in a word of Prayer gracious Heavenly Father we come before you lured asking you Lord that you you put you bless us all to Daler and Lord please that I asked with that that this message will help someone mirth lord please a we love you learn in English Christ you pray amen you may be seated so when and at this time there was a battle between the Philistines and the Israelites and and on the Philistines they had a huge giant they had he his name was Goliath he had a helmet of brass he had a coat of mail he had armor that covered his entire body and he also had a huge spear and in the Bible it says that he was six cubed span and I'm assuming I'm assuming that that must be as tall as a bookshelf and so and he was always taunting at the Israelite saying that you guys are just little I can squash you like a bug or or just like taunting everybody like let's say in a game or something and so what he said he challenged the Israelites that you he wanted to fight someone and he who if he wins that he if the Israelite wins the Philistine shall beat their slaves but if Goliath wins that the Israelites have to be the Philistine slaves so on and the Israelites try they had these three men and they were all they were brothers and their father's name was Jesse and he had eight sons and David he was a youngest and so just to explain David he was a keeper of a sheep the Sheep and he would help his father in different places and so one day his home his father told him to go take his brother some food and David was very obedient he would listen to what his father would say and so when he told him that he gathered up his food and started heading to the camp and when he arrived at the camp he was wondering where his brothers were because he wanted to make sure they were okay and they would afraid David was pretty young so he was kind of nosy and so and so whenever he went to go find it he wanted to go find his brothers to just go make sure they're okay and so whenever he was looking for his brothers it was the first time he ever heard Goliath's voice and people were saying how have you guys heard of this man named Goliath he's been he's been whining to challenges and trying to beat us up and so David he he wasn't even a part of this war and he says I'll fight him and so everybody just starts looking at him and saying like what you're just a little kid what you're talking about and so when Saul he heard David and he he was saying like what makes you think you can defeat him they're just yeah you you can't you can't do you can't fight him and so David told him a story and he told him a story when he was with his his sheep and there was these two beasts the lion and a bear and they both attacked the Sheep and so whenever they attacked the Sheep but they took one of them and David went straight to the Beast and took him straight from their mouth and whenever the Beast they went to go attack him David just he was he had the grace of God protected him and he grabbed him by he grabbed him by their beard and slaughtered them meaning that he killed them and so and so Saul he he started to gain faith and David and so he says well by all means go ahead fight him and made the Lord be with thee and so so thought that David was just because he's small that he was just gonna be like basically just squashed and so uh saw him his best armor and he gave him a sword and David was looking at all like what are you trying to do to me I I can't fight like this I haven't proved it and so David just stripped away the armor and what he took instead was he took a slingshot five stones and his staff and so he just went like that to Goliath and Goliath took one look at him just he just started laughing at him and I'm a I can see he says I can squash you with my bare hands and David David says you come in armor and a spear but I come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so he took one of his stones and putting in his slingshot and threw it straight to his foot him in the middle of his forehead and the stones don't straighten into his head and Goliath fell - into the face of the earth and David he he didn't have a sword so he took a lie its own sword and sliced his head off and and the Israelites they they were young and victorious they they were yelling with joy and the Philistines they just ran us for their entire life so after telling you this story after giving you some knowledge I I want to relate how it can help us today in this world because a giant today is and this time it's like it can be a problem a situation a sickness anything and so and so I I can't I have a problem myself I like watching my tablet for too long but I'm pretty sure everybody I I'm pretty sure most of people might have a problem in the life in right now and so if you have the faith like David where you can believe that you can take down a giant then it shall be done in the name of Lord Jesus Christ I hope this I'll help you all and God bless you [Applause] [Music] I did see some warriors earlier where they are ah there's one right there what's your name stun Malachi you know who I am I am Joshua you're in the Bible too okay so am i great to meet you Malachi how you doing are these all my little warriors right here are you guys big fierce warriors big ones huh big ones how you doing sir are you doing great to me all of you god bless you brother gentlemen sisters how are you you doing okay don't be afraid I'm on your side well you see it's about that time it's about time to go into the land of promise we've been wandering this desert long enough you know like I said me and brother Caleb you know we went a while back in man we just wish we could have went right then but you know God has a purpose for everything but he's kept us around all these years 40 years we've been wandering the desert you know so sad to see Moses great servant of the Lord pass on to see the angels come and carry that man to a place to hide him away I was with that man every day I was his minister we've gone through a lot together in 40 years hearing people's murmurings and complainings hearing how much that they just didn't think God could do it but not me and brother Caleb we didn't believe that at all we know our God was able to do whatever he wanted to do through us we knew the promise that he didn't just give to us he gave to our great-great-great grandparents and told us about this land flowing with milk and honey while we are the generation that's here that's going to go take that promise now I'm looking for an army I can't go over there by myself so I need an army so I need a bunch of this new generation I need the generation of the true believers how many of you believe we can go conquer Canaan do you think we can do it we can do it right easy me and Kayla birdie went and saw some of those giants if they're just big that's it we can take them they're not that big guys I'm bigger than half of them and I eat way more than they do so we're it will be alright alright alright don't be scared Malachi we got this we're in the Bible okay so here we go and we know the story but I want to relate this for you a little bit closer because you see when God commissioned me to go over he said it's time to go take it you know it's not something easy that you feel on your shoulders it doesn't mean that we just run in there with our heads not on and just start going crazy waving our swords no we got to follow the very plan of God because if we don't a lot of you guys might be missing I don't want nobody missing over there I need all of you guys okay all right so here we go and God give him gives me the promise he said it's time to go over while Jordan the hard thing is Jordan is running at full force right now you know I saw the little rio grande outside hey while we would have done that one easy we would have just jumped across it and just been on our merry way that's not the way Jordan was Jordans River was rushing hard it was rushing fast the only way a person could get over there is if a man was superstore now I'm talking about really really strong maybe like brother mark brother mark I think could swing across maybe we find another man really strong could make it across so we're gonna send those two men to go spy out this land okay because the first city we have to take is Jericho now Jericho is one of the major cities of this land of Canaan the walls are high I want you to look up at the ceiling that's not high enough we could get some of those ladders out of but the back of brother been struck and climb right over they these walls are big I'm telling you high walls so high that you if you have the if you're scared of heights yeah you'll get scared you're gonna be able to climb that wall it's high okay the only way we're gonna take down these walls I still don't even know how well we're gonna home man some of my arm is falling off here hold on to that for me I might need that later so here we are and we're crossing over I'm gonna get the the men we're gonna get the Levites to cross over because God gave me the battle plan that we ain't gonna move without the Levites and the Levites these guys are the elite of God these guys ain't scared of nothing these guys would go and get the the tabernacle of the Lord the Ark of the Covenant on their shoulders and as they march across that soon as the soles of their feet hit the water the water is gonna part for us we've seen it before guys we've seen it when we leave when we left Egypt some of you haven't seen this but I saw it with my own eyes just believe me these waters will part so where's my warriors at put your helmets on which warriors do I got all right guys you ready I want you to get into line behind me okay I want a column of two all right this is a test cuz you guys don't pass this test we ain't gonna pass Jericho all right lines of two's come in so you're gonna get right here okay now one get behind him the other ones gonna get over here and there so on okay come over in this way Malachi all right all right come on that way okay you guys ready all right we're gonna test your battle cry first okay now on the count of three I want you guys to yell like you're yelling at the devil you ready one two three that was pretty good but I think we can do better all right guys can we help these guys out I'm gonna need everybody I'm gonna need the ladies I'm gonna need the man I'm gonna do the little kids the big kid everybody one two three that's what I'm talking about we can take this land you guys ready all right let's go you're gonna watch these men in front of us imagine them today walking across Jordan you see Jordan all right watch those waters apart let's go and as they walked they walked right into the land of Canaan with nothing to stop them they walked all the way through no big deal look at the waters guys that on both sides we're fine let's go keep on going we ain't looking to the circumstances let's look to the promise let's go guys all right now let's let's go back let's go back over there so everybody can see us hey David how you doing man you doing all right all right all right go ahead guys all right you guys got to start looking mean and tough because I don't want no weaklings in my army we'll send you guys over to brother Ben's house and toughen you guys up if we have to all right so then they crossed into the land this land is beautiful just imagine the most greenest green you've ever seen just imagine all the fruit there we've been eating Fig Newtons we've been eating roots we've been eating all kinds of stuff the manna was pretty good but imagine all these fruits there those grapes are sure good you know you guys got to taste some of them this morning man brother Caleb knows how to cut them grapes knowing oh my gosh I think he even stained my shirt I'm gonna have to send him my dry-cleaning bill but here I am and it was the time of Passover so we don't do no fighting on the Passover it's not good to miss church to go to work do all this other stuff no when it comes time for Sunday we worship the Lord so as Joshua goes Joshua goes off to himself they started making unleavened cakes and here's Joshua and Joshua starts he starts to pray I I really don't know how we're gonna conquer these walls yet but it's not up to me it's up to God Lord Jesus Lord how Lord how are we gonna do this Jehovah Todd I don't want to lose any of my men these are good men they got families they want to inherit this land they don't want to just die they want to be able to enjoy some of it Lord some of these young ladies here Lord struggling we all struggle Lord but I know if you would just give me a word Lord a word of encouragement I believe Lord we can take these walls I believe we can conquer these armies that are squatting in our houses these people that are just being a bunch of squatters on our promises I know you're gonna give it to us Lord and as the story goes on he moves off to himself in the wood there and Canaan and all of a sudden he's by himself and he begins to hear footsteps [Music] who are you are you for us are you against us yes be strong and of good courage well - oh God and with you I am your servant come at me Father all right did you see that lightning bolt come out of this out of this scabbard that's the same captain of the Lord of Hosts that is going to be in our midst but I don't believe he's only gonna be in our midst I believe he's gonna be in this place to reign in your heart forever if you just let him into your life young young kids one day just let the Lord Jesus Christ come into your heart and no demon in Hell would ever have victory on you but as you see holy moley Wow do you know what this is what is this this is God's Word Wow and it's got all of this it's got the battle plans to take out Jericho that's what we came here for boys now we're gonna get them this is what we're gonna do he just told me a secret we're gonna march around the walls of Jericho for the next seven days for the six of the days we're gonna march around one time but nobody is to make a battle cry nobody can make a sound can you guys keep a secret did you say nope oh you said yep okay I'll make you sure we got a little serious there for a little bit I little go crazy all right guys so first pert for six days they marched around the walls of Jericho not making a sound they followed the Ark of the Covenant and the whole time the king of Jericho was getting mad because it was warring on his mind you know the devil likes to mess with our minds a lot that's his battleground yeah but isn't it funny when we mess with him he gets mad so we started worrying on his mind and when the king of Jericho saws marching without making a sound no battle cry he said what manner of army is this they crossed a part of the seal they parted the Red Sea then they go and wander the desert for forty years and then they turn around and they break through the the waters of Jordan and then they make cakes where in the world did they get the frosting over here they make these cakes and now they're walking around my walls and they haven't made a sound that they want to fight what kind of warriors are these guys what kind of warriors are these ladies and he wondered and he wondered until

walls all right let's go Shh alright guys you see the walls of Jericho in front of you know fan out get into position and as they got closer to the walls of Jericho the seventh time all of a sudden when you hear the ram's horn then on a stream make a joyful noise unto the Lord all their people make a joyful noise unto the Lord ah and the walls of Jericho came crumbling down at their feet because of people that will need the promise of the Lord [Applause] you guys get on the beat Wow I'm gonna leave you all of this remember though the obstacles might seem great though we might just seem a few
