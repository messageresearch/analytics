[13:24] but if there's a petition in your heart
[13:26] tonight
[13:27] I have a Thanksgiving
[13:30] 4K
[13:33] because the time that I've been here
[13:36] 22 years
[13:38] for the first time
[13:40] I was able to travel with my wife
[13:46] if you couldn't understand me just a
[13:48] little bit
[13:51] the situation that I am in
[13:53] believe me Brothers
[13:56] when one walks with the Lord
[13:59] anything can happen
[14:38] but those highways are still dangerous
[14:41] very dangerous
[14:44] just a little
[14:46] the Lord just a little bit the Lord
[14:49] allowed me to see
[14:50] the angel
[14:53] that was ahead of me
[14:55] well it is real
[15:02] never left me
[15:08] it's hard for those that don't drive in
[15:10] the snow
[15:23] throwing snow onto my windshield
[15:28] but the angel
[15:30] [Music]
[15:31] was always there with me
[15:34] for my wife and myself
[15:38] 22 years without traveling
[15:41] God gave me the strength
[15:44] to sustain me
[15:46] and to come back
[15:53] this is my church

[16:06] [Music]

[16:29] that you have

[28:16] can have a seat
[28:18] so let's just read real quick Revelation
[28:20] 21 9.
[28:25] and it was just part of the scripture
[28:28] that uh our founding Pastor read on on
[28:31] Wednesday
[28:34] and it says and there came unto me one
[28:37] of the Seven Angels which had the seven
[28:39] vials full of the seven last plagues and
[28:41] talked with me saying come hither I will
[28:43] show you Thee the bride the Lamb's the
[28:46] wife
[28:56] Del Cordero
[29:00] At His blessings to the reading of the
[29:02] word
[29:09] amen so uh we want to be uh
[29:12] I want to make sure we got our time
[29:14] right tonight
[29:16] how many enjoyed that message this
[29:18] morning
[29:20] amen so uh where do we stand
[29:24] and as you can see uh that was my title
[29:28] right so I felt as soon as I heard the
[29:31] the uh
[29:33] the uh title this morning
[29:37] I felt safe
[29:40] all right I believe that the Lord was
[29:42] working amen
[29:45] so I feel good tonight because uh
[29:48] because we were on the same page whether
[29:52] abrahamas
[29:54] good to see each and every one of you
[29:56] God bless you Roxy and Paul God bless
[29:58] you good to see you this evening
[30:01] and all those that are online
[30:04] so where do we stand amen
[30:07] and so the question was asked to us this
[30:09] morning
[30:12] why are we here
[30:16] amen somebody be bold while we're here
[30:19] right so maybe we might say oh there was
[30:22] nothing else to do on a Sunday night
[30:25] right and so like the the man that one
[30:28] once time one time went to church
[30:31] uh he heard the sermon
[30:34] and then uh he he uh when he got back
[30:37] into the car
[30:39] he began to complain
[30:42] he said oh man that was the worst
[30:44] service I've ever been in
[30:47] oh man did you hear them singing
[30:50] Do You Hear did you hear the piano
[30:52] player
[30:55] terrible really and that preacher
[30:58] that's terrible
[31:00] right and then and then his son chimed
[31:03] in from the back
[31:06] seats
[31:09] what were you expecting for a dollar
[31:11] right
[31:16] thank you he had put a dollar in the
[31:18] offering and that's exactly what he got
[31:19] a dollars
[31:22] so why are we here
[31:25] uh how many believe that you are the
[31:28] Bride of Jesus Christ tonight
[31:31] right so I got I got half of us that
[31:33] said amen
[31:35] and maybe another half that raised her
[31:37] hand
[31:38] so I'll give you an another opportunity
[31:41] uh how many are here how many here are
[31:44] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[31:47] so you hear so many times
[31:51] and and we hear this a lot is
[31:54] that the First Defense of people
[31:57] because they say uh you you don't know
[32:00] who the bride is
[32:04] right that's our first line of defense
[32:07] right or you can you can't judge me you
[32:10] don't you know
[32:12] but there is a way to know who the bride
[32:15] is
[32:16] how many know that tonight
[32:19] there is a way to know if you are the
[32:21] bride
[32:23] would you like to know because he told
[32:27] this Angel here
[32:29] let me show you the bride
[32:32] the Lamb's wife
[32:35] right so we're going to find out a
[32:37] little bit about this this bride
[32:41] because everybody claims to be the wife
[32:45] but unless God reveals himself to you
[32:51] he reveals himself personally to you
[32:55] and he ever thought of you in the
[32:58] beginning
[33:00] then you are his wife
[33:04] and it will be revealed to you so how's
[33:08] it going to be revealed you say
[33:11] let's find out amen let's just get a
[33:15] little comfortable
[33:16] Diego always said let's just get
[33:17] comfortable tonight
[33:21] and let's find out how we're going to
[33:24] find out
[33:25] so let's read Malachi 4-5 amen
[33:29] all right so we're just going to read a
[33:32] couple scriptures to to get a foundation
[33:34] amen
[33:36] he says behold I will send you Elijah
[33:40] the prophet before the coming of the
[33:42] great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[33:49] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[33:52] fathers to the children
[33:56] and the hearts of the children to the
[33:58] fathers
[34:01] last I come and smite the Earth with a
[34:03] curse
[34:07] so he's going to come and do two things
[34:09] right
[34:11] so one thing was going to be that he
[34:14] would turn the hearts of the fathers to
[34:15] the children
[34:24] but he's going to also turn the hearts
[34:27] of the fathers or the children
[34:29] he's going to turn the hearts of the
[34:31] children
[34:32] back to the fathers
[34:35] right correct and that was a gentile
[34:38] Prophet yes and he said I will send unto
[34:41] you Elijah the prophet
[34:44] he never said he's going to stand Paul
[34:49] or any other messenger but he said I
[34:52] will send to you Elijah the prophet
[34:57] now if we can go into our scripture now
[35:02] we can turn over to Luke 22 31. now
[35:09] and the Lord said Simon Simon behold
[35:12] Satan hath desire to have you that he
[35:15] may sift you as wheat is
[35:25] but I have prayed for thee that thy
[35:27] faith not that thy faith fail not and
[35:30] when thou art converted strengthen thy
[35:33] Brothers
[35:44] and so let's just go over now to our
[35:46] scripture in Matthew 16.
[35:49] and so you want to keep these scriptures
[35:51] in mind okay
[35:53] we're going to start to build on them
[35:56] then set Jesus unto his disciples If any
[35:59] man will come after me let him deny
[36:02] himself and take up his cross and follow
[36:04] me
[36:13] okay so now we're starting to see a
[36:15] little road map right
[36:17] we're starting to see the instruction
[36:19] page
[36:23] now he's giving us a way to find out who
[36:25] we are
[36:28] right so he he says now take up your
[36:31] cross and follow me
[36:33] but we find out in this last day that
[36:36] we're living here
[36:38] first of all let me make sure
[36:40] everybody's on the same page how many
[36:42] believe me
[36:45] that we are living in the last days
[36:49] right how many believe that we're this
[36:52] is the the last day amen
[36:55] and as you know in the last days
[36:59] we find out
[37:01] that is very hard for people to follow
[37:06] Jesus said take up your cross and follow
[37:09] me
[37:11] now we know that it would be so close
[37:15] that it would deceive the very elect if
[37:18] it was possible
[37:23] and so that's how close it's going to be
[37:24] in this last hour
[37:27] and the reason for that is
[37:30] because God promised
[37:33] that he would pour out his Spirit upon
[37:36] All Flesh
[37:38] now we heard this morning right as
[37:41] brother Abraham was speaking
[37:43] about the Holy Spirit right
[37:46] and what the Holy Spirit was given
[37:49] foreign
[38:23] right he said that the the rain will
[38:25] fall upon the Justice
[38:29] that's the promise
[38:32] as we heard this morning so
[38:36] now what was the Holy Spirit given
[38:38] foreign
[38:40] well brother Abraham was speaking this
[38:42] morning about his time in the apostolic
[38:44] church
[38:49] right and and they said that the Holy
[38:52] Spirit
[38:54] was given for us to speak in tongues
[38:59] right
[39:00] is that what they said brother Abraham
[39:02] right it was to speak in tongues it was
[39:06] to do all these other things
[39:08] but now the holy spirit will make you
[39:10] could make you speak in tongues
[39:13] right but but that's not what it was
[39:16] given foreign
[40:00] foreign
[41:00] when you don't Harvest when you plant
[41:03] how many knows that is
[41:05] it takes time
[41:09] for this rain
[41:11] or for the former rain to take effect
[41:16] but when the seed reaches maturity
[41:20] God gives it a ladder rain amen
[41:24] which brings a harvest
[41:27] now when that Harvest comes forth
[41:31] now everybody claims the third of the
[41:34] Bride right
[41:35] everybody claims they have the word
[41:38] everybody claims to believe the prophet
[41:42] right everybody believes they have the
[41:44] word
[41:45] but when that latter rain comes
[41:53] that was under the former Reign
[41:57] so whatever that teaching was
[42:05] it's going to give you the fruits
[42:08] whether that teaching was right or wrong
[42:15] it's in the fruit that's why Jesus said
[42:19] if you can't believe me
[42:22] believe the works that I do
[42:25] it's in the works
[42:29] so we see that people say
[42:31] I I I hear the prophet
[42:34] oh I don't need a pastor
[42:37] I have the tapes I have the prophet
[42:40] right and so I don't know if you've seen
[42:43] the movie The Chosen right
[42:47] and so in this Scene It is the sinner
[42:49] Jesus goes into the temple
[42:52] right and they they ask him uh you know
[42:55] they had made preparations for him to be
[42:57] able to read the the reading for that
[42:59] day yeah
[43:02] right and so he reads the scripture that
[43:05] pertains to him
[43:07] right and so when the priest hears him
[43:11] and everybody around him
[43:14] they start looking a little confused
[43:17] they're saying is he saying what I think
[43:20] he's saying is
[43:23] right and so and so in in the movie his
[43:26] friend uh Lazarus
[43:29] he starts to say no no no he's no he's
[43:32] not trying to say that oh and if he says
[43:35] right Jesus you're not you're not saying
[43:37] that right
[43:38] so what they were thinking
[43:40] what he was saying was that he was the
[43:43] Messiah
[43:44] that he was the Christ
[43:47] and so so Jesus responds to responding
[43:50] he says that's what I was saying Lazarus
[43:52] pretty much
[43:53] that's what I'm saying right and so the
[43:56] priest tells Jesus
[43:59] he says if you don't recount what you
[44:01] just said
[44:03] we're gonna have to fulfill the law of
[44:06] Moses on you
[44:08] and Jesus looked him in the face right
[44:11] and he says I am the law of Moses
[44:15] right
[44:17] and that's what it is today yes yes no
[44:46] has got to be a revelation to you
[44:51] and the only way that can be is
[44:54] that you have to have a new birth
[44:58] how many knows what the new birth is
[45:59] but it's time for us to have our own
[46:01] experience
[46:28] because the pastor says he's Christ
[46:32] as many times we're gonna if we like our
[46:35] pastor business
[46:38] we like him uh we're gonna we're gonna
[46:40] say oh you know it's like like brother
[46:43] Lon said oh sometimes we just repeat
[46:46] things that the pastor says
[46:52] if we like him we're gonna we're gonna
[46:54] repeat what he says
[46:56] but when that Revelation
[47:01] that says he's the Christ
[47:04] when that Revelation personally comes to
[47:06] you
[47:08] only by the Holy Spirit
[47:11] you can call him the Christ so
[47:15] don't says now
[47:18] order but in you they don't understand
[47:21] you can never call him the Christ
[47:24] except by the Holy Spirit
[47:26] the holy spirit is the only one it's a
[47:31] lunico that can show you things to come
[47:36] how does he show you Israel
[47:41] right we heard it this morning right
[47:44] God has a vessel
[47:47] God has prepared a prepared voices
[47:52] now we know that God has only one voice
[47:56] and God has a voice
[47:59] that's what you have to watch out
[48:01] foreign
[48:23] we're living in a late dangerous hour
[48:27] we're living in dangerous times
[48:31] we're living in Alaska
[48:33] very dangerous hour
[48:38] and the reason you gotta watch out is
[48:42] because we heard this morning right
[48:45] we have inlets
[48:48] to the body and there's inlets
[48:53] so there's inlets to the supernatural
[48:57] so we got to be careful what we're here
[49:02] because our beings
[49:04] have contact
[49:06] with the Supernatural
[49:08] and in the Supernatural world
[49:11] you can beat the state very easily
[49:17] very easily so you gotta watch where
[49:20] you're stepping
[49:22] it's like a Minefield is
[49:33] you step on a land mine
[49:37] blow you apart right and that's what the
[49:40] devil will do people say oh I know the
[49:43] Bible God
[49:45] I know the message front words and
[49:48] backwards
[49:50] the devil knows it better than you and
[49:52] me both
[49:54] right he knows that more than we do
[49:59] and man I was gonna try to I was not
[50:01] gonna try I almost go into the right
[50:07] there's one thing he doesn't know
[50:09] right because God didn't permit it to be
[50:11] written
[50:13] but it was hidden in the heart of a
[50:15] prophet is
[50:22] okay so let's go on
[50:24] you can be deceived very easily
[50:27] now if we don't know the word
[50:30] which is Christ the word
[50:33] we can never be made free
[50:36] now as I said everybody claims to know
[50:39] the word
[50:41] but we know that the gospel didn't come
[50:44] in word only
[50:47] but it came in power and demonstrations
[50:51] now you hear so many people say
[50:55] like I've said and I'll repeat it
[51:04] somebody said the other day or I read
[51:07] directly from the prophet
[51:10] the prophets my guide
[51:13] I lean upon him the prophet right
[51:18] but like Philip said
[51:20] to the eunuch
[51:22] who is reading directly from the scroll
[51:26] he was reading directly from the prophet
[51:29] is
[51:33] do you know what you read
[51:46] a little bit more Revelation than most
[51:48] people nowadays
[51:51] he said how can I know
[51:54] unless
[51:59] just like he said some Apostles
[52:08] unless some man is
[52:14] the Holy Ghost teachers
[52:19] so the word
[52:24] that's why today many people foreign
[52:31] they
[52:33] don't understand it so they start to
[52:37] dismiss things about the message
[52:40] right because they don't have a guide
[52:42] right
[52:45] so because they can't understand the
[52:47] message
[52:49] and they can't put the message together
[52:52] right they start dismissing certain
[52:54] things
[52:56] oh the prophet was wrong
[52:58] the prophet made mistakes
[53:01] before 1963 he wasn't inspired
[53:06] right because they don't know
[53:09] Christ
[53:13] because you can only call him the Christ
[53:16] through the Holy Spirit
[53:22] what is that
[53:24] so you have to have that word
[53:27] right and so it also takes a strong hand
[53:30] of faith
[53:33] it takes a strong hand of Faith
[53:39] how many know what that hand is
[53:44] that I would send you Elijah the prophet
[53:49] and to what's he gonna do to turn the
[53:51] hearts
[54:19] I was a better Christiano
[54:23] hey
[54:24] that I was a better Christian when I was
[54:26] in the apostolic
[54:29] and brother Tommy's response was
[54:32] you were a better Christian in the
[54:35] Apostolic Church
[54:38] you didn't even know how to be a
[54:40] Christian
[54:42] you didn't even know what it was to be a
[54:45] Christian
[54:46] until this Prophets
[55:51] ain't no
[56:26] and so in the message
[56:30] so we're going to read a quote here
[56:36] right so it's uh in the anointed ones at
[56:40] the end time
[56:42] is this how close it's going to be
[56:48] Anointed with the same spirit that was
[56:50] upon Moses
[56:55] all right I got the Holy Spirit brother
[56:57] right
[57:00] Moses what he says was anoint Anointed
[57:04] with the same spirit that was upon Moses
[57:09] what was the difference
[57:12] the teaching of Moses
[57:15] was perfect
[57:21] Moses had the word of God
[57:26] oh I'll hear a denominational preacher
[57:30] oh this guy on YouTube he's awesome
[57:36] what was the difference in his message
[57:40] the message of this this one right here
[57:43] and their message
[57:45] being anointed by The Same Spirit
[57:48] foreign
[58:40] you know you don't run off like a Lone
[58:42] Ranger
[58:45] Jesus said
[58:48] go bring me your husband
[58:52] what are we going to do
[58:54] bring me your husband right
[58:58] and so
[59:00] he was anointed with the same
[59:02] Spirit as Moses was
[59:06] that Moses message was perfect
[59:11] the Bible said here in second Peter is
[59:15] that it was the teaching of Balaam
[59:19] that Israel received
[59:22] that God never did forgive
[59:27] unpardonable
[59:29] not one of them got saved
[59:34] Salvo
[59:36] let us sink in a little bit
[59:40] right
[59:42] they all heard the message
[59:44] they heard the prophet is
[59:48] they heard Moses message
[59:52] they all heard it Salvo
[1:00:03] though they had come out under the
[1:00:05] blessings of God okay
[1:00:07] and sing the hand of God moving by the
[1:00:10] mighty prophets
[1:00:13] and
[1:00:17] because another Prophet is
[1:00:21] and what what's the New Testament
[1:00:23] preacher
[1:00:25] he's a prophet right so another preacher
[1:00:29] or another Prophet come in with a
[1:00:32] teaching
[1:00:34] contrary to dispute with Moses
[1:00:38] and try to prove to the people
[1:00:43] that Moses was wrong
[1:00:48] right correct so they run off with their
[1:00:51] own message
[1:00:53] right but it's got to be lying
[1:00:55] the Bible says it's line yeah
[1:01:02] right correct what brother Abraham
[1:01:06] preached this morning
[1:01:08] yeah
[1:01:14] precepts right
[1:01:26] that's why you don't run off
[1:01:28] these people that are running off
[1:01:30] opening churches everywhere
[1:01:36] right correct why I got a message
[1:01:39] does it line up line up online
[1:01:42] does it line up with the word so
[1:01:47] in
[1:01:49] uh I got five minutes
[1:01:51] six minutes so
[1:01:55] so we find out
[1:01:59] that we must follow
[1:02:01] as we read the scripture
[1:02:04] take up your cross
[1:02:07] and follow me he's seeking me right
[1:02:09] right
[1:02:11] as we've just read
[1:02:13] that that Jesus was telling Peter Jesus
[1:02:17] he says Satan has asked for you now
[1:02:24] let's go here
[1:02:26] it's okay I want to read uh the same
[1:02:28] scripture
[1:02:30] you're not you're not going to have it
[1:02:32] up there so
[1:02:33] I'm going to read it oh you guys
[1:02:36] remember the scripture
[1:02:38] Luke 22
[1:02:40] you want to look it in your Bible if
[1:02:42] they want to put it up
[1:02:45] but I want to read it to you this way
[1:02:51] right
[1:02:53] so this is this is another translation
[1:02:59] Luke 22 31 and it says
[1:03:03] you're my friend Pedro me amigo right so
[1:03:06] just follow along
[1:03:09] it says Peter my friend Pedro Amigo
[1:03:13] listen to what I'm about to tell you is
[1:03:17] Satan has obtained permission
[1:03:23] permisso
[1:03:33] to come and sift you all like wheat
[1:03:37] yeah we right away think
[1:03:40] and the Lord said Simon Simon behold
[1:03:42] Satan has desire to have you yes
[1:03:50] okay so then Jesus prayed for him
[1:03:54] no but he says
[1:03:57] vehicle
[1:03:59] Satan has permission
[1:04:02] he came and he asked Jesus
[1:04:04] can I have permission to stiff Peter
[1:04:06] down
[1:04:09] and Jesus tells Peter
[1:04:11] Satan has obtained permission
[1:04:18] and to test your faith
[1:04:22] but I have prayed for you
[1:04:25] we heard this morning that God has given
[1:04:29] us the greatest weapon
[1:04:31] and that's prayer yes now saying has
[1:04:35] permission to sift you down
[1:04:38] right and to test your faith I gave him
[1:04:42] permission but I have prayed for you
[1:04:47] that you would stay faithful
[1:04:50] to me Ami no matter what comes
[1:04:55] the power of prayer
[1:04:58] thank Jesus
[1:05:00] thank Jesus Jesus for praying for US
[1:05:03] foreign
[1:05:28] vacations
[1:06:36] we know sometimes you got to go to work
[1:06:52] all right Pedro
[1:07:13] stay faithful to me no matter what comes
[1:07:18] remember this
[1:07:20] after you have been
[1:07:23] turned back
[1:07:26] to me Ami and have been restored
[1:07:31] make it your life mission ask it
[1:07:35] to strengthen the faith of your brother
[1:07:40] now you cannot do that
[1:07:45] you have had a full conversion
[1:07:48] total when you have had a true
[1:07:50] conversion
[1:07:53] and the only way that a man can be truly
[1:07:56] converted is
[1:07:59] that the holy spirit is
[1:08:11] like we saw this morning
[1:08:13] that was a strong and affairs
[1:08:54] and the Bible says that they were
[1:08:57] pricked at their hearts
[1:08:59] they were pricked
[1:09:03] as we stand to our feet and what
[1:09:06] happened to the heart it was bleeding
[1:09:09] when it's pricked
[1:09:12] it begins to bleed what was happening
[1:09:16] all those impurities were coming out
[1:09:20] all that garbage
[1:09:22] that's why they say a smoking is going
[1:09:26] to send you to hell everywhere
[1:09:33] doing this and that's going to send you
[1:09:35] the house
[1:09:36] no that doesn't send you to hell no it's
[1:09:38] not alone just believe in God's word
[1:09:42] just believe in God's Prophet is
[1:09:47] all those other things
[1:09:49] he said just follow me
[1:09:52] just follow me take up your cross
