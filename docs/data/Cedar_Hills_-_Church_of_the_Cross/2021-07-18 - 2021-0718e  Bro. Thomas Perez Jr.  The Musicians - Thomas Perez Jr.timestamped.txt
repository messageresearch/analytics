[42:53] what we did was we we found out how to
[42:55] have recreation ourselves
[43:00] and we didn't we we would eat dinner
[43:05] and after every dinner this was a
[43:07] catastrophe my dad would get the guitar
[43:09] me papara and you see the great
[43:12] musicians that my brothers are
[43:14] the best losers we we would they would
