don't know me if you're here just how traumatic it was for a nation to go through what they did but if uh the museum was huge and you couldn't just leave you had to go through a little maze Grande and as as the middle part of it was blocked so you couldn't get out of it it was so moving you saw people that were being dragged just uh dead bodies without any any respect to the bodies what was Muertos and uh and so many other things but what impacted me also was a poem by a little of a little boy they were given um very little food to eat in a certain country and they would have to those that were Brave would go out at night and steal food for their family and this one little boy um and there was written in his face who will bring the food for you tomorrow Mothers it was it was it was an experience I'm sorry when you experience yeah a little um but after I I left there I was I was I was just in tears when I left that place this was when the um thinking of all the the lack of the love um and the uncaring for those that are that needed help that are hurting and so he gave me this poem the precious the precious tears you left behind those tears were also mine I hold these lives that once were torn apart I heard their cries and held them to my heart each life is dear and precious to me I saw the secret things before they came to be the healing of the Nations will come the tearing Devastation shall cease and all be gone one day there will be no more destruction and disease or in my Holy Mountain love will reign and Hate shall cease thank you hey man would you all please stand you have come to the most important part of the service that is to hear right from the Throne of God this morning I mean are you ready are your hearts ready to receive something it is my great privilege my great honor to introduce our our Elder to come and give us Words of Life this morning let's sing that song I woke up this morning feeling fine and if you maybe you didn't wake up that way but now you're feeling mighty fine just seeing it with all your heart this morning as we welcome him to come up and [Music] I woke up this morning feeling fine oh I woke up with Heaven on my mind I woke up with your down in my soul poor poor I know oh Lord have control all that I do I was walking live [Music] and my mind always [Music] [Music] welcome always [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] they'll always [Music] I hope you're feeling mighty fine I am okay I feel fine every time I'm in church and be with people that I will spend an eternity with yes well this morning this this week has been a mighty uh busy week for me Tuesday I address the widows and Marcus yesterday I addressed the youth and today I'm Australia but I I like it when I'm busy what are you going to do especially it's been so cold where are you going and the hospitals are full with people with the flu so why do you want to go and you know better to be inside study with the word of God and be a good boy and a good person okay so this morning if you will bear with me and later you tighten your seat belt and you give me your most attention limit us to complete attention and we'll learn together as you can see the title of my message is the sights of the north side with the subtitles The Trail of the surface so if you would be so kind this morning and open your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 14. verses 12 and 13 versus a scripture that I taught you so many times but we're going through a different route yeah here he says how are thou Fallen but brother Brown says why are thou fallen from Heaven of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which is weakened the Nations lose verse 13.3 for thou have said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the man of the congregation and the sides of the north two days his Blessing to the arena the word you may be seated foreign he was God's right hand man to Fellowship he got puffed up in his heart yes so why are thou fallen from heaven because Lucifer in heaven okay Lucifer and LCL try to exalt himself even be just a little higher than his boss happy he had the wrong attitude and you'll never get more of God until you become nothing you've got to get little before you can become big and Lucifer wanted to be God but God said I need you and Michael up here to help me and you still will be my son of the morning but then God descended and don't says and form Adam Out of the Dust for more Adam and make him a secondary God you know is when Lucifer found out this is God more jealous and he betrayed Michael yeah Miguel and he made himself a great Kingdom it is [Music] Bible says then how did he make himself uh greater kingdom come on we know that Satan was real crafty and sleight Heaven knowing the principles of life he had a lot of wisdom and when he was cast down to the to the Earth he got there in the garden and in the garden there were two trees one of Life the other of Good and Evil where did the evil come from because in heaven Satan had the preeminence that can choose first so what is happening and don't say contessiendo it's inspiration is inspiration by God for dios but Satan also can inspired and the Lord God formed Men Out of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living Soul God inspired just inspiration in other words and that was God's spirit yes and Satan in the serpents he preached the foreign ministers in the Apostolic Church who is the devil that deceived the devil me and Thomas my dad caught us again we were more green than you know what we couldn't answer the questions which was the devil did deceived the devil you heard the spirit I had way back over there foreign [Music] hahaha who was the devil one the disease that all was God himself let's see where we're going so God has said we have Satan preaching to if II Corinthians 11 13. deceiving Spirit comes Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ for yesterday and no Marvel for Satan him self he is therefore is no great thing in his ministers also be transformed as a Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their Works those false Apostles are his disciples Galatians chapter 1 verse 6 to 8. what was that Uno Uno I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that call you into the grace of Christ unto and other Gospels which is not another but there will be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then there which we have preached unto you let him be a curse you see that that the Syrian Spirit Mira it ISO because the Satan preaches from behind many prophets the people are received we were in hotel when we were in kuchillo if the people that have come under the ministry of Thomas perish senior we wouldn't have a church big enough to hold if we had all the people that had been under the ministry we will not have enough room to set them off so that's why are the benches he can say Satan by his inspiration or take the word how did he attack the world he inspired El inspiro he breathed into the serpent yes and she reasoned with him and you see now the trail of the serpent Ramirez the beginning you have two wombs then in those materialistes or the woman well we're going to explore all of us it's the international physical and spiritual spiritual the mind is a womb to the spirit is and you are on the basis of free moral agencies to take in or reject that is how if committed spiritual adulteries by the Intercourse of the Mind sexual Diablo no you are walking on the trail of the serpenters [Applause] I am the three old the truth and the life I am the way which the way is your heart is and the seed is the gospel and that seed alone is foreign wait I mean what is the mind the world comes first to this womb it is because the mind is a future when you filter what goes from the Mind into yourself so then where is the mark of the beast and don't just press don't start La Marca de la Vesper does the Bible said that the mark of the beast is it it's in the forehead and on your right hand in Suman why on the forehead is the mind yes the greatest battle ever found was in the womb of the minds then in the womb of your heart the blood of Christ is the germ of life that goes into the seed and bring forth a newborn believer the entire place the physical womb of if was closed is could not create a blood cells in the womb of the virgin in the womb of the Virgin Mary in in Maria so he used the blood cell of the serpentus which have the term of life and it opened the womb of if yes and deceived and the tree produce King yes Mexico oh um like a dog is going to the street and trying to find somebody to give him something to eat so in other words the mongrel was not a pedigree it's the Pedro Mexico Peregrine means pure bread because Cain was not there is multiply and replace La Novia what year Carlos where are you watch here miraki and when the womb of Eve opened and the serpenter relations the portal and Gates of Hell were opened because Eve was inspired by Satan's we can say there were 400 . they were inspired and inspirados all in one Accord and they prophesied but Jehoshaphat said momento I haven't been taught like that what kind of inspiration do you have The Inspirations death notice the kind of inspiration of any ministers teaching here only tapes for you people I don't know all of you heard the message of our founding Pastor Wednesdays if you were not in church I hope you were online here in there in English he said and it it has to be somebody who knows where he's standing is if a church doesn't have an Apostles so you people are the most privileged people yes we are so privileged that he left everything in order for us if you hear tremendous message from behind this problem you can thank our founding persons which was an apostle of Jesus Christ no [Applause] many ministers and people don't like to hear something like that is two scriptures on Second Corinthians and Galatians comes among the people as an angel of Life his name was Lucifer is the one that carries the light wasn't his alive he was the son of the morning foreign when is the darkest time in the heavens at midnight oh no oh no the darkest is right before the sun comes out early it is so dark and the only star you see in the heavens all the other stars have disappeared in Estrella and is pointing to the east yes it is the morning star is welcoming the Father the Son is welcoming the s-u-n is the great son we know is is the Lord their same sun is or that a morning star or is Estrella de la Manana let me tell you something to relax that morning star is you know of course when the sun comes out you don't see it no more it's like the we are supposed to be the Moon La Luna we are the ones that give light in the absence of the sun Reflections but even though we the bride is the moon the time will come when the moon will turn into blood well when will the moon turn into blood and Sangre I preached on that before yeah have you forgot we are in an exodus from the Moon I'm a you know why the time will come remember in chapter 12 of Revelation there was a woman clothed with the sun who is that woman we're on the red Exodus is a foolish version they have to be murdered in the Great Tribulation turn the moon into blood yes in the evening in the west Alex but you cannot go further than the weather is it starts getting a little dark it commences you see the evening star is the evening they are not two different stories and the name of those stars is Venus the goddess of love because none of you or myself because I can preach real hard okay how many and why do I pick on you Andrea okay I'm gonna pick a new rules Ruby Ruby how many keys does the piano have piano huh Andrea tell your friends Ethan you play the piano how many keys foreign [Music] know them that go clockwise but you know what I'll go with the other 79. people follow the other doctrines that's why we have to go counterclockwise Amen on my mind one goes against the green one and that's you yes not deceived by an Angel Of Life look at their teachings and answers you know and and me and the founding pastor at first we we were with them because we didn't know better oh no brother Branham is coming in a in a tent Ministry he's coming in uh can you imagine in a canvas 10. when Moses and their God of course Moses didn't go into the promised land but when the Israelites God to the promised land they did away with tempered knuckle in the desert and brothers and it was not a tent of canvas I am the 10th you're sorry I am the 10th I am the 10th you are the yeah he said he would have to pray in first to drive the the spirits because they used to have rock and roll concerts and and dances so he had to pray to get those Spirits out of there is this it helps my my not his preaching he says to pray for the sicks and discernment it's better in attention and it'll be only for church services but thank God also Ministries that you are only supposed to hear tapes of William Brothers Urbana then quite in the fivefold ministry did he put teachers because men they can hear things and just believe what they want is and that's why they are deceived foreign [Music] so then entrances a lying Spirit came up and said let me go down all Inspire those ministers your Inspirations those pastors those teachers estos maestros those that call themselves Apostles in this message okay don't get me wrong they are great men educated Educators tremendous speakers I could not even hold I mean there are speakers that I don't even come close to them [Music] I mean you you've heard them you said they and by the way they Minister let's face it they love and this is not throwing a nobody yes people like to hear ministers they can preach a hundred miles an hour and you guys that preached like that there is nothing wrong with them if if I if I did then I would have the wrong spirit is and if I would criticize I have no business behind this is your gift because God is you know he likes black people brown people white people you know the difference is for his place like many flowers together come on flowers for him the Flores and he'll take him away from the earth take them up in a place under the altar where those flowers will never Wilt or turn like I said and there's people even in in our midst of Medias who have a gift I wish I could preach like some of you know that's not my Ministry you know but I I love to hear the news and that attracts a lot of people yes and they think that if you don't preach like that hey Lego princesses because let's face it really is Emilio I'm more clear than clear yeah I'm just very very Frank very clear now Simmons we were born with nothing if it's black I'm gonna call it black s Blanco I mean I'm not gonna be back as a puppet and tell you a lie you know Western artists but let's face it sometimes teaching can be true it's okay yeah but you know what teaching will put you in your position and the devil hates it when you get to your position and when you get to your position no devil in hell can move amen and I'm gonna leave it there so this premise because and by their inspiration in person inspiration uh people believe a wrong Doctrine is given power to control everything he lost his conscious of what God put him here for on Earth he lost all the plumbing Sterling started in the gray in the brain he said Plumbing without Plumbing I'm gonna make sure I got there right listen because because when you are dying foreign you don't reason no more it's your soul is been in your heart and you grieved away instead because you have five senses which was made by the egg of a woman so the serpenter evil one El maligno is the outside man is a spirit too which when you are born on those dead in town says it was not given by God it was only permitted because that's the spirit is of a worldly nature yes that is why you were born in sins so that person inside of you is a sinner to begin with and it also has five inlets Etc you do not think Cristiano piensa or have conscience with your body or tennis consensus it has no mental faculties because foreign [Music] that is why foreign [Music] I never not even when I was all in the world did I know how to dance in the midst there anyway I look to see yeah but I always go to the dentist in yuffie and I just like to dance the walls because I didn't know how to dance I wish I would be like Cami and uh and uh said they condensed even in here yeah uh no longer we can say people can dance in the experience go to church in the spiritual and can absolutely have the real spirit of God here absolutely maintaining the spiritual reality are anointed on that Spirit on kingdom sobre is still be lost two on that one people just because they dance or speaking in English and let me say it again and you were in the spirit dance and Shout in violence and come here in the spirit are anointed but there is still be lost and devil possessed foreign see that's why you come to church to learn English don't get scared don't get scared and start going out of the church yeah it's the little soul it's just on the inside of that spirit and then through this spiritual yes how did the spirit on the outside between the soul and the body can be absolutely Anointed with the Holy ghosts so then the Soul is predestinated so they can anoint this Spirit to make the outside body but a circle come into subjection to that spirit is the holy spirit can anoint a man is it with the Holy Spirit and your soul is dark as pitch is because the same water that falls under which also falls under notice the trail of the surface going into all you know that trail of the surface he goes into all your houses including mine including La Mia and many of us we put a welcome met to the circle I told you many times there's her there's more period don't die Master spiritus it's in Walmart it's in a Walmart it's a store that everybody visits is those are hitchhikers Daniel yes if you let them you'll bring them to the house and then the wife gets enough squabble with a husband where did those spirits come from spiritus is your life worthy of the Gods is the life worthy of to me of the Gospel we all must examine ourselves here I cannot answer for you or you answer for me we are here so God can help us for us to be an example to the people or our relatives as we're gonna find out some of you don't even know that you have the Holy Ghost is and you put a welcome mat to to the to Satan it upon is because the Bible says the sin lies the serpent enters in your conscious you're trying to sleep and a lot of times you can't in music because you're in a nightmare okay you've seen hideous things just like the sinner when The Sinner dies he cannot go to the presence of God because he's a sinner he cannot return back to Earth because his time is up okay his heart between two things in the fifth dimensions and he cannot go in the presence of God because he is not covered by the blood okay he cannot wake himself because his time is here on Earth how many here have nightmares laughs I knew that you were not going to raise your your hand yes but I was talking the world I had a lot of nightmares and if some of you were truthful you would raise your hand yes that's all right you know we're humans they can say he's in a tormented Nightmare and you have a nightmare is when the two countries are passing is you self-conscious and the first conscious and it catches between media so when a sinner dies he's caught with his soul is between Earth and health and a nightmare why has all this happened foreign uh 13. no I'm sorry you're right just Howard thou falling from Heaven All lose to first turn of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which does weakened the Nations for thou have said in thy heart I will Ascend into heaven will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will see it also uh look what he's gonna sit upon the amount of the congregation in the sight of the north is notice where the congregation of God is where Satan wanted to go is saying look 10 18. son Lucas yes yocho and he said unto them I beheld sane as Lightning falling from heaven what causes lightning you know what causes lightning okay when two clouds called light under those so which two clouds colliders it was Lucifer and Michael him they collided Lucifer images and you felt like lightning and the lightning bolts that fall more often Los Angeles so how why was The Cloud of Lucifer negative because Michael took all the torch out of him but he wanted to go back up to the sides of the north so how was he gonna go if his Cloud had not charged in him already taken out of all he started so when lightning comes down where does most of the lightning strikes started so it is a negative vote it is on transmission line or the electricity power lines so they will not be charged get inside takes the negative ball is when it hit also hits one of the things that he hits the most are the trees is so he could not hit the tree of Earth if he would have tried to hit Adam he would have exploded because he would have been aligned it or had over a million volts and there was if well you said well she didn't have no power instead is wait a minute where he Adam needed a help mate so when they took the river out of him God gave adam a help mate yes she was to help me and he could do what Adam did but when Satan came down he hit that tree and do you know there's many trees are resistant to a lightning bolt it's a resistance [Music] nothing will happen but have you ever seen a tree that's broken in heaven because it's our tree has the resistance it boils the self in that tree what happens and you've seen many trees like this is and took the charge that she had and then if gave to it to Adam and it was transferred do the serpent but foreign the second Bible the pyramid and in the king's chamber yeah there is a chef an opening pointing straight to the Polaris or the North Stars because there are a lot of stars but only one true story is set in the center of the earth the North Star never moves an accomplice always points to True North and if you have the Holy Spirit is always points to the sides of the North to the word of God never points to a denomination because denominations are like other stars they shift like the world he says but we know it is a little deeper how do you say a little deeper and Laos menu it says the head of the handle yeah I think the month is a no star is here to mention just a few so let me take it look at where the power is in the first two Wars World War one and World War two years a country that borders Russia which is the King of the North yeah Germany alemania are North Germany borders Russia after the 40s in the 50s is the U.S went to war with Korea Korea but North Korea made the United States General North Korea is then we're going to the 60s and they went to Vietnam and North Vietnam made the United States get out in North Vietnam is Satan is reigning on the side of the Lord well the last time the north won is when we had a Christian Presidente Cristiano Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln in the North in the Civil War the north Peterson and the North Star is only visible in the northern hemisphere because it cannot be used for navigation south of the Equator and on the Tabernacle in the Wilderness Camp on the North what was the banner on the sides of the north it was the eagle so now as you look at the first Bible in the zodiacs on the sides of the north there is two constellations side by side the constellation of the agila the constellation the constellation of the ego and the constellation of serpent areas both on the sides of the Lord where did this message come from the North Del Norte North America North America and to finish where is true refugeot where is my refuge understand The Book of Psalms chapter 48 verse 1. great is the Lord in the city of our God in the mountains that's where Satan went up to the month of the congregations beautiful situations
