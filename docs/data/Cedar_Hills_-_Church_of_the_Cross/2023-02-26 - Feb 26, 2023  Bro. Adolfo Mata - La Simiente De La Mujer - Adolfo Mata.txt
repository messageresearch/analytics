I'm going to ask you all to be seated we have a short video it's the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel it's a video of our Prophet God bless you our purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel now if we can only find that and make it sure positive then we'll know just the hour that we're living none of us know when he's coming but we can tell that the hour that the time that we're living knowing just how close we could be now while instead of the scriptures he see that the 70 years was running out so him being there 68 years left two years and the future until God would restore his people back to their Homeland while in prayer we find out that there was a mighty angel came from Heaven Can anybody call these names Gabriel and he is the Angel to the Jewish Church I mean all that everywhere is Gabriel Gabriel is the messenger to the Jewish Church came the Mary came to Zechariah always is Gabriel and he's one of the great angels of heaven and did not he bring our brother Daniel such a wonderful salutation from God oh Daniel greatly beloved 70 weeks are determined upon thy people [Music] the Jews and what was it determined for upon not only Daniel but among Daniels Holy City see Daniel holy city now class what was Daniel's Holy City Jerusalem 70 we started terminal 9 leave the holy seed to finish the transgression making the end of sin and uh to make reconciliations for iniquity to bring in Everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy that was a six-fold purpose of the visitation of Gabriel now let's start number one to go to market you got pencils number one to finish the transgression that's the first thing now to finish the transgressions of Israel who transgressed against God will be the Turning Away of the ungodliness of Jacob we were contrary to Nature aliens without Mercy without god with no hope at all and God by his Mercy to give us a chance cut off righteous Israel because of transgressions and turn them aside throughout the tame Olive Tree and brought in a wild olive tree contrary to Nature onto a good tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own Olive Tree then poor miserable people cut off I down or not knowing where they're going and thank the gods in his Mercy did that philosophy thing uh blinded their eyes from their own Messiah shut their ears up that they could not hear him yet looked out of these miracles in the vanities Miracles and things that even through it number two make our end of sin [Music] now let's read again Daniel to finish transgressions and and make an end of sins that's the second purpose of coming first is The Finnish Israel's translation and to make an end of sins where did Israel sin where did they do their vital sin where did they separate themselves from God here's where she's done her life's sin and the reason she's in the condition today Matthew the 27th chapter of Saint Matthews the gospel and the 25th verse of the 27th chapter [Music] the governor answered and said unto them whether all these trained with you that I released unto you and they said Paramus now remember that's Israel is pilate said unto them what shall I do with Jesus which is called Christ listen at it they all said unto him let him be crucified remember that's their Messiah that Daniel said would come [Music] remember this morning in the lesson here and you'll be cut off not for himself not nothing you do let him be crucified and the governor said while one evil has he done but they cry out the Lord saying let him be crucified that pilot saw that he could Prevail nothing but rather a tunnel was made and he took one and washed his hands before the longitude said I am innocent of the blood of this just person see to it listen here's your mistake here's your sin then answered the people and said is run Beyond us and on our children that is worth it he was making it into sin for them how could he do anything else let's forgive them knowing if he has a blind their eyes that we could come in it's like his own children calling for his blood that's the reason he cried for forgiveness for them forgive them Father for they don't know what they are doing they were blind foreign they did this but when they see him again demand what I need to send what is sin they did not believe that was a messiah they could not see him to be Messiah yeah he thought every sign of Messiah was supposed to do but they could not see it they were blind so when you see people saying I don't believe in about anything I can't see it I can't see the scratches the Holy Ghost don't be angry with them they are blind but Dad can't see this message of him coming I can't see this baptism the Holy Spirit I can't see the serpent seat I can't see this stuff they're blind just pray for them all right you know I believe but when they see him when he comes again it will make us end of their Unleashed to make reconciliations for iniquity iniquity is doing wrong as they did at the cross he made reconciliations but it will not be applied to them it was not applied to them why because they were blinded and could not see it amen and why did they run you said well maybe today was all time blind you're a wealthy blind they were blind because God blinded them but you're blind because you're willingly blind there's no reconciliation for you if you believe that I am he said Jesus you will sign your sins that's right as soon as that was a messiah she was born again in one day make reconciliations Four Seasons a Reconciliation for our iniquities on coincidence oh my [Music] God they just got what was evil not which is wrong reconciliations was made for their iniquities number four to bring in Everlasting righteousness when Israel's transgression has come to an end Satan who is their accuser and our accuser Satan will be sealed up in the bottomless pit when one when bringing in Everlasting righteousness something that cannot end all that cause unrighteousness will be got away with let's get Revelations the 20th chapter the 13th verse just a minute and let's read here just a minute and I saw an angel come down from heaven heaven the keys to the bottomless pit on a great chain in his hand he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and found him a thousand years and casting into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nation no more until the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that must be loosed a little season make on Everlasting bringing Everlasting righteousness Satan in the Bottomless Pits and when he does that and seals up the devil which has deceived the people in other words when the enemy has been put away the end of sin has come the bringing in of everlasting righteousness has come Satan is sealed up in the bottomless pit and the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the Earth as the waters covers the season amen glory to God it's coming brother if women will be ladies and men will be gentlemen all right now the Millennium man is on that's when the Millennium when the city is to be built number five the Seal of the vision and prophecy yeah you shall come to see you'll division prophecy [Music] the museum class this revelation of Jesus Christ and of his power of His coming of the empire was sealed up until this time that's what he come to do it's hit from the scholars no wonder they will apply stealing it up there's an old prophets and everything way back it won't hold water but the vision this Vision has been sealed right here now facing my face that God will reveal them amen he said to the inside suppose that's the words and sealable until the end time what do you do to seal up the vision and the prophecy Daniel had prophesied these things you saw it in a vision and the angel come down to seal the vision and to seal the prophecy they can read it but can't understand it until the end time the end time what is he in time they end up with 70th week when that priests Antichrist will be revealed at this time making himself God the sixth I Know It's the Most High you're the one the last thing he used to do is to what now to anoint the most holy this is the anointing not of a man Jesus is already anointed is that right uh anointing anointing that Temple or the millennial Rings God came into the sanctuary that was to be anointed I was given over to him for the people to come to worship so to anoint not the holy place but to anoint the most holy place and we notice that New Jerusalem is the most holy place and the anointing will be upon the New Jerusalem that this is from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride of doing for her husband the anointing will be a full man of course it is people are just crowning being of King and Lord of lords coming back to his holy Temple Anointed with the presence of God to live in the rain to the Millennium with his

song remember this song we're gonna ask our brother although for to come forward and bring us words of life amen [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign have fellowship with all of you so we're very happy for that is to the Book of Genesis chapter 3 verse 14 and 15. foreign foreign stick your seat yeah once again it's such a pleasure to be amongst you all about two weeks the lord gave me a small thought and when the thought came unto me and since then the curse fell upon this animal is was placed between the two seats in other words they are not friends in the heel is so there's something there that's very tremendous so if we could take the time if the Lord would help us to enter into that so it's not the of Satan is because the devil he is a spiritual being who was created by God himself is but in reality it's the seat of the serpentos in whom the devil or Satan went in yeah and throughout the century to work through it is so it's the form that the devil injected himself into humanity and he continues to inject himself through the tactics which he uses through the humanity so we see that the seed of the serpents continues to be used by Satan it is but really it's the that is so really it makes sense because he has been dragging himself through the time man that the woman in itself there is no seed in here but enough for there to be a conception neces could then have children without a companions but the Bible says but we know that God himself and he produced a germ of Life in Her he asked me small he was God himself reproducing himself to come and flesh just like Satan uses the seat of the serpent which is reproducing himself to make himself a human yes and the promises that he will come through the woman men men tell us to be the name of God he had to come as a man and suffer as a man and bear all that men suffered but in reality it was God in Christ the world unto himself to reconcile the world two hymns through his son okay to us blessed be him but the Bible speaks to us in the beginning was a word was with God and the Word was God the word was made flesh the word made flesh in a man is and he had the holy spirit in him without measures in other words he had the fullness the holy spirit in him full of grace yes made flesh in a man walking on two feet now that was Christ Jesus is a word now you're with me now we said prior to this okay for there to be children there needs to be a union between a man and a woman to produce sons and daughters all that wasn't gone foreign and the church to Christ physically is not here with us holy spirit yes which is the anointing yes Christo which is Christ the Holy Spirit now in the church now we all know that a church is likened into a woman of God man man this is and God continues to bring the seed of the woman now it's Christ the anointing the Holy Spirit working in his church bring forth new births children of God Como just badri the father and the sun are the same because now the word needs to be made flesh in someone so that the world can be alive it must live in someone it needs to live in his children his brain to Iglesias his church needs to come to be La Novia palabra the word bribe La Novia the word or the bride message see that's who we are I mean now in my particular case 46 years now we've been following this gee this is you could say it's easy but only I know foreign we are the message of the hour Is Us because the spirit has come down to the woman bring for children to existence amen amen the message produced a message called what was the Holy Ghost given for eign take a moment to think what's Spirit given for eign shall see me the Holy Ghost given for eign [Music] is dead see yes but it must be the Holy Spirit bring forth a new life the letter kill it but the spirit will sanctify our quickness then amen now we're in the church condition where God is low through individuals working through those individuals seeking for the Lost to bring them into the fold of the Lord back in the Garden of Eden and he will speak with the son you say Adam wherefore art thou Adam those that belong to him hello with him now when he works through his church what it works with individuals they have come to the position where God can use them to an adoption yesterday performs a ceremony of adoption he took three Witnesses located there's also Revenge he is positioning his son he should do his work is adopted adopted and now gone has children her sons on this age they are now fellow workers in in the work gold workers co-workers yes they're co-workers in this in this work amen amen that's why you see your pastor Yandel Africa go in Africa there's a work he must do yes yes and it is doing that work is unity of God and man that is continuing the works of Christ but until the last times until Every Nation and when I say preach I'm not talking about taking a pamphlet I started and speaking but get up with them any person can do that but to praise we are ambassadors of the good tidings on Abraham uh president there's a lot of ambassadors of bad news all they do is take the bad news but we are not that way we are ambassadors are good tidings he is not dead wealth in US of God woman it is promised to bruise the seed of the serpent in the head because in our time continues continues his works and to be able to finish with that in the body it still moves be a very beautiful very flowered message many Les but it harms not the devil Godly but we gotta hit him where it hurts him and very often I say yes I would like for the devil that I could physically hit him and if I could oh I'd give him a good slapping I have to use the shield that the Lord has given us he says it was going through this narrow way which is the way of the lord it's a narrow path narrow way of the world is a broad way but this is a narrow way cross the way so if I would have my gun and he says he says I want it that way then to hit him in the head but then someone told me don't do that brother take that stick is wounded went into a pool of water foreign hopefully it dies was going through a very difficult time the people we're confusing him we're confusing him with a very anointed one Christ Jesus they were turning their focus he was the Christ I can't bear that is and the saddest part it wasn't those out in the world he himself says if it would have been my own enemies I would have laughed about that but it was precious brethren but it's yours and precious sisters that were then telling me this until the angel came Let It Go es he says you know that already happened Israel had so many years they confused him for Messengers or must we seek another is the same it's been so long that there's been a prophet on the earth now they're confusing you with Christ I understand hopefully that wounded serpent should die well it didn't die giving problems it's still giving problem in our time a lot of people haven't understood that God has risen up a prophet with the spirit with a message for the preparation of a bride and I say Amen to that amen amen and that's the way it is but you know the word reproduces itself when it's genuine but when it's not the power to reproduce itself again it needs to be genuine words and it needs to be made flesh amen amen today a lot of people have our own churches have been getting away from us now I'm not your pastor I'm not going to go deep into that but if someone's watching us online and put pay attention there is a spirit that's dividing churches so that if you don't believe the way we do you're not going in the Rapture and you have to follow a worldwide pastor all around the world with that I believe then they shall be saved be the name of God now the word that's spoken is the Original Seed the spoken word is the Original Seed now that word once it's been spoken it doesn't go back it doesn't change it remains forever that's who it is [Music] and the scene it is a scene it has life as well original that's original no Ivory the hybrid that mix directly not just States not just books very good as both of those things that's why I take my inspiration that's my message this is That's My Messenger amen amen but there are things that are in the message I've always been there [Music] it is the same God but using different vessels amid amen it is the word finish the Redemptive work of Christ a lot of people they say just press play I could go into a lot of things there but the only thing I can say yes you want to hear me press play press my button and I play for you [Applause] a man a man yo I speak as well because that word has been made flash that's which I follow it's not a myth no no no it's not a religion it's gone way past that is can you change something like that no no you can't change when God's already changed them the spoken word does not die it lives and it shall live forever and if we are the ones who take or carry it says and with you to reproduce itself when it was necessary to give the message to a eunuch an angel came he took Philip foreign amen amen so then continues to do his work he's always been a crystal to Christ very few recognize them it went right over their heads present yes will the bride have a Ministry yes before the Rapture yes there will be a Ministry surround the earth I will carry this gospel amen amen it is the woman that has received the germ of the word wants to bring forth Sons children to existence it is necessary be born again does not die it is necessary to die yes we must die to ourselves yes see we need to die every single day surprise Gloria amen amen we must die to be born again when you are born again you have a difference that you come to a position do you understand your own positions God can really do through you okay oh sometimes we say well obviously I can't do much but if you give that to the Lord God can use that nothing to do much worse because we are yelling but it is amen amen you carry who said the real oh amen you're royalty Sons and Daughters of God that's something to be proud of Jesus I'm proud to be yourself I'm proud to belong to this message I'm proud to be part of that message I am the message foreign Hermanos amen man let's pray our dear heavenly
