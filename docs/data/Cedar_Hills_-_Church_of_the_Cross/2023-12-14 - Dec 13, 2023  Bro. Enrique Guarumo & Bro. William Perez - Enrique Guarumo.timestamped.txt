[39:07] more
[39:09] time let us open up our
[39:12] scriptures let us go to the Book of
[39:22] Matthew we're going to be reading
[39:24] chapter four of St Matthew
[39:39] when you have it you can say
[39:43] Amen blessed be the name of the
[39:46] Lord let us pray before reading
[39:49] it Heavenly
[39:52] Father we thank you
[39:55] tonight for giving us the opportunity to
[39:58] be
[39:59] here still with
[40:02] life with with the desire to serve
[40:05] you to continue our
[40:09] journey Lord at this time we have opened
[40:11] your
[40:12] word we ask you that by
[40:17] reading that you help us to understand
[40:19] the reading of
[40:21] it we ask this in your
[40:24] name in the name of the Lord Jes Jesus
[40:30] Christ 4 verse 12 of
[40:35] Matthew through verse
[40:38] 16 the scripture read reads like
[40:45] this now when Jesus had heard that John
[40:47] was cast into prison he departed into
[40:55] Galilee
[40:59] and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt
[41:01] in capernum which is upon the Sea Coast
[41:04] and the borders of zabulon and
[41:10] nephin that it might be fulfilled which
[41:13] was spoken by Isaiah the prophet
[41:23] saying the land of zabulon the land of
[41:27] by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan
[41:29] Galilee of the
[41:41] Gentiles the people which sat in
[41:44] darkness saw great light and to them
[41:46] which sat in the region of the and
[41:48] shadow of death light is sprung
[41:51] up you may be
[41:55] seated
[41:57] G to take some quotes from The
[42:03] Prophet the message there is a man that
[42:06] can turn on the
[42:09] light we ask
[42:12] God to understand what we can according
[42:15] to his
[42:17] word the prophet tells us in this
[42:22] message that
[42:24] religions or the past
[42:27] ages they could not
[42:33] Advance because they did not continue
[42:36] with the light that was after
[42:39] them and that's the reason why they
[42:41] couldn't
[42:43] continue and us as people of
[42:49] God I believe we have been instructed by
[42:51] the word and the
[42:54] message to understand that the word word
[42:56] of
[42:57] God is always
[43:01] present and is always
[43:06] Progressive it is not just a one
[43:09] place or one
[43:14] form the word of God is always be
[43:17] transforming itself through
[43:21] time and the prophet of God tells
[43:24] us that when God said let there be
[43:29] light then he said that the first
[43:32] atom started
[43:35] spinning and he said and until
[43:38] today it is still spinning the same
[43:42] way so the word of
[43:44] God never
[43:46] ends because it is
[43:52] eternal when we come to this topic uh
[43:58] just as the prophet left
[44:04] it because I don't have a higher
[44:07] authority to give my own
[44:12] topic but I will leave it as such just
[44:15] so I can give it in this
[44:18] way for us to obtain
[44:23] light the prophet of God says that
[44:25] electricity
[44:28] has always been upon the
[44:31] earth and the prophet
[44:34] says if you were in a dark
[44:38] room you would not be able to
[44:44] say you would probably say electricity
[44:47] light
[44:49] up but he said that's not going to
[44:53] happen even though electricity is
[44:57] there but even if you scream and
[45:02] shout you will not be able to get
[45:06] electricity unless you
[45:09] go to the law of
[45:12] electricity and that that's the way God
[45:16] is he say you can be crying out to
[45:23] God but you have to act upon the law of
[45:27] God because God is a god of
[45:32] laws so you cannot come to
[45:38] God but through his word which is the
[45:44] law and I read something that the
[45:46] prophet says in the
[45:51] message I hope you be you be patient
[45:53] with
[45:54] me
[45:56] with reads like
[46:04] this that's just like the
[46:08] light it isn't the lamp that makes the
[46:18] light it's the electricity that's in the
[46:20] wire that makes the
[46:23] light it Heats The Wire
[46:28] and the wire gets hot and makes the
[46:32] light now if you remember the
[46:36] scripture in John chapter
[46:39] 8 Jesus says I am the
[46:45] light but when you go to the Book of
[46:47] Matthew Chapter
[46:50] 5 you notice that Jesus says ye are the
[46:54] light of the
[46:57] world
[47:01] now for what I know I
[47:05] understand that there is lamps or
[47:08] bulbs of a of a certain
[47:12] capacity but Jesus
[47:16] says so should your light
[47:21] shine so it depends on the light that
[47:23] you
[47:24] have that's how you should light
[47:28] up if you only have five
[47:35] amps don't try to have 60
[47:40] amps I hope I can
[47:46] make this is very common in the
[47:50] house so there can be electricity at
[47:53] home somewhere
[47:57] there has to be a source of
[48:02] power now to transmit that
[48:07] power it takes some
[48:12] resources and when you go through the
[48:16] road you're going to see some power
[48:19] lines have you seen
[48:22] it there is power in those lines amen
[48:27] you can't see it but there's
[48:29] power that if you touch
[48:32] it I'm G to read what the
[48:35] prophet the prophet he worked at
[48:40] electricity I'm I'm gonna say
[48:45] it he says that he was so
[48:48] distressed and he saw he saw those power
[48:54] lines he said that there was 2300
[49:00] volts and he wanted to grab those 2300
[49:04] Vol to
[49:06] go so so he could go home see his his
[49:11] daughter and some some Supernatural
[49:14] way he ended up on the
[49:20] floor so if there was 2,300 volts the
[49:25] prophet said
[49:26] says by
[49:30] only that would tear your whole body
[49:36] apart now when Paul meets this
[49:41] light what this light
[49:44] does is that it he it blinded
[49:48] him that's what it
[49:51] depends on what kind of buob You
[49:54] Are
[49:58] and here we come into what our position
[50:00] in Christ
[50:05] is so the prophet was in in the in the
[50:08] power post
[50:12] post and when he saw the shadow on the
[50:15] on the on the
[50:17] ground he said that it was like a
[50:23] cross so to be able to transmit this
[50:27] light you need
[50:30] Calvary the
[50:32] cross and if you go through the
[50:35] road those who who
[50:39] are so you're goingon to see that you're
[50:41] you're going to see a
[50:43] cross you're going to see a post on in
[50:45] the form of a
[50:47] cross and there's three lines in
[50:51] there now this electricity that gets to
[50:54] your home
[50:58] it's a voltage of
[51:03] 110 vaults that come to your house but
[51:07] through
[51:09] there there is
[51:12] electricity that is
[51:16] 240 We're not gonna talk about that
[51:19] we're only going to talk about
[51:24] 110
[51:27] you know devices like
[51:29] these they only work with 12
[51:32] volts and when the gospel
[51:36] started started with 12
[51:39] Apostles but after
[51:42] that the Lord said let's let's get up
[51:46] the voltage a little
[51:48] bit and he said let's get
[51:54] 120
[51:56] I hope you can understand
[51:58] me and when he put
[52:02] 120 so the power was
[52:08] more now to be able to transmit that
[52:13] power we're gonna find what that we have
[52:16] the
[52:20] post that's why Paul said to establish
[52:24] men that are
[52:27] helpful that are willing to
[52:30] teach and you know the
[52:34] requirements because this
[52:40] power if you connect it to the wrong
[52:43] lamp you know what's going to
[52:46] happen it's going to
[52:49] explode it's not
[52:52] gonna these
[52:54] lamps
[52:56] they have some
[52:59] resistances and that's why Paul comes
[53:01] and teaches us and he tells
[53:06] us that the men that are going to
[53:09] serve they must be tested
[53:16] first there there's people I'm not going
[53:18] to say who because I don't know
[53:23] them you know they put a man to do a
[53:25] certain
[53:27] job and with the first complaint they
[53:30] receive they cannot resist
[53:33] it they cannot bear up with
[53:38] it that's why Jesus says so sure should
[53:42] your light
[53:46] shine as a brother said even if I was
[53:49] the rug of the
[53:52] church and they put that brother to
[53:54] sweep and he he he didn't want to do
[53:56] it he said I don't like
[54:02] that that's why you should prove your
[54:09] resistance so let's establish the the
[54:11] first
[54:13] post you know the Wood and Wire post
[54:19] right maybe there by by your house there
[54:22] there's one of
[54:24] them
[54:26] have you
[54:30] wondered why those post they they have
[54:33] been there for so
[54:36] long you see that years go
[54:39] by and the owner of the house and a new
[54:42] one
[54:43] comes and the wooden post is still
[54:50] there for that post to to
[54:54] last or resist the
[54:57] time that he that he
[55:02] needs they put oil on
[55:08] it and you know what oil means in the
[55:14] Bible when you're under the right
[55:18] anointing in the right
[55:24] place
[55:25] there's going to there's going to be
[55:27] many things that are are going to
[55:30] happen but that's not going to hurt
[55:33] you because that
[55:38] post they do not only cover it with
[55:43] oil but the deepness that is going
[55:47] up is the same deepness that is going
[55:53] down so
[55:57] these are
[55:58] some but take it to the
[56:04] spiritual so you can see how is my post
[56:13] anchored
[56:19] remember I'm just giving you the facts
[56:21] so you can know if you are
[56:23] light why am not am I not
[56:27] producing even if it's five watts of
[56:33] light you know why the
[56:37] Propet because there is a wire that is
[56:40] wrongly
[56:43] placed why do I not
[56:47] get the prophet says it's probably
[56:50] because there's a wire there that is
[56:53] losen because the power is
[56:58] there you probably feel disappointed or
[57:01] or
[57:04] discouraged but you have to find that
[57:06] little
[57:09] wire why are things not working in my
[57:13] home you need to have you need to find
[57:15] that little
[57:20] wire we are receiving very tremendous
[57:23] messages
[57:26] how many are
[57:32] Gods I remember brother
[57:37] Bernie he was speaking about
[57:43] very he say sometimes we want to have so
[57:46] much
[57:47] power to speak to the
[57:50] lion to control the
[57:53] animals but what about your
[58:01] home I
[58:04] remember the first God is
[58:11] Man then not even the dog can can be
[58:14] subjected to
[58:18] us so we have to look for that wire why
[58:21] we are not lighting
[58:23] up
[58:28] I'm not gonna get
[58:32] in because we have to live it first so
[58:35] we can preach it the prophet
[58:38] says keep
[58:44] reading
[58:48] then you
[58:53] know I work in it for
[58:58] years but there's no one in the
[59:02] world that knows what electricity
[59:10] is can explain the power of
[59:20] God the prophet of God says no one can
[59:23] explain it
[59:28] for that's why a man that was trying to
[59:30] explain
[59:32] it I think he died frustrated for
[59:36] that because he couldn't explain
[59:39] it
[59:42] says isn't it
[59:44] strange no one knows what it
[59:48] is they can hardness
[59:50] it they can make it
[59:53] light they can cook with
[59:55] it they can heat with
[59:58] it they can light with
[1:00:01] it but no one knows what it
[1:00:05] is it's two pieces of
[1:00:08] material rolling
[1:00:13] together which makes the
[1:00:17] continuity so it's two
[1:00:19] pieces
[1:00:22] together that's why the scripture says
[1:00:25] two are under
[1:00:29] agreement ask whatever you
[1:00:33] want but it
[1:00:37] takes for them to be in mutual
[1:00:43] agreement so they can have
[1:00:47] continuity blessed be the name of the
[1:00:50] Lord and sends
[1:00:52] out GE electricity that's the way it
[1:00:57] is when those two pieces get rolling
[1:01:04] together that's what brings it off in
[1:01:06] the
[1:01:07] generator that's the way it
[1:01:11] is when a Christian gets to working with
[1:01:14] God rolling
[1:01:18] together that brings an unseen
[1:01:22] force that does Mysteries
[1:01:25] that none of us know
[1:01:28] anything we only know that it's God
[1:01:31] isn't that right see
[1:01:36] yes blessed be the name of the
[1:01:42] Lord so the first thing we find is that
[1:01:44] we need two people
[1:01:48] together we have a line of
[1:01:52] 110 but on the other side
[1:02:00] we're going to need another part of
[1:02:01] electricity which is
[1:02:06] negative you touch it and you don't feel
[1:02:09] anything but if you touch the one that
[1:02:12] is
[1:02:14] 110 you would probably not feel
[1:02:17] anything but you need to take to touch
[1:02:23] both
[1:02:25] 120
[1:02:27] volts and that will shake you
[1:02:31] off but when we go over the
[1:02:37] 240 we need two
[1:02:44] 120 you don't need the negative
[1:02:48] anymore that's why you need to leave
[1:02:50] every
[1:02:53] negativity be able to form a
[1:03:01] 240 we're going to be in 2024
[1:03:07] now so we're not going to be in 120
[1:03:12] now I keep
[1:03:15] reading the prophet
[1:03:23] says this
[1:03:25] what was
[1:03:29] it was God going to light the world with
[1:03:32] his own
[1:03:34] electricity he had been here all the
[1:03:37] time it was here all the
[1:03:42] time but they just didn't know how
[1:03:45] to and make it work for
[1:03:52] you well now the same holy spirit that
[1:03:55] fell on the day of
[1:03:57] Pentecost that healed the sick back
[1:04:01] there it's been here in the
[1:04:05] church all the
[1:04:11] time but the thing of it
[1:04:16] is you don't know how to make it work
[1:04:19] for
[1:04:23] you
[1:04:25] now there's a thing that makes it work
[1:04:28] is Faith to believe to
[1:04:33] believe when you believe and take him
[1:04:35] out his
[1:04:37] word that's the
[1:04:40] lifeline and it cannot
[1:04:45] fail now if you go in the morning and
[1:04:47] turn on the electric
[1:04:49] iron some of you women to start the iron
[1:04:55] and the first thing you know that it
[1:04:56] doesn't
[1:04:57] work has it happened to
[1:05:03] you that's what the holy spirit is
[1:05:07] saying you're GNA iron and there's no
[1:05:17] electricity you will not go around and
[1:05:19] say there is not such a thing as
[1:05:21] electricity he said uh-uh no no no said
[1:05:23] uh-uh
[1:05:26] you wouldn't do
[1:05:28] that there's just something
[1:05:37] wrong there's just something
[1:05:40] wrong you got your wires crossed
[1:05:45] up that's what's the matter with many
[1:05:48] people that
[1:05:49] say well I got prayed
[1:05:51] for I didn't get healed
[1:05:56] there's no such a thing as Divine
[1:06:00] Healing you just got your wires crossed
[1:06:07] up the prophet says
[1:06:11] look look at the others that are being
[1:06:14] healed
[1:06:16] see there's something wrong with you not
[1:06:19] with
[1:06:23] God
[1:06:26] so if you haven't been heal do not blame
[1:06:30] God do not blame
[1:06:33] anyone just go
[1:06:35] home say Lord why do I not get
[1:06:39] healed what am I doing
[1:06:42] wrong so I'm not the way that I'm not
[1:06:46] healed because the power is
[1:06:52] there keep reading
[1:07:01] now it says
[1:07:04] now the room is full
[1:07:08] of electricity but only that bulb is
[1:07:11] made to
[1:07:15] burn now as God has certain instruments
[1:07:18] that he works
[1:07:22] through the prophet is saying that God
[1:07:24] has
[1:07:27] electricity but he has
[1:07:30] instruments that he can work
[1:07:33] through
[1:07:38] says through
[1:07:42] preaching through
[1:07:46] prophecy through prophetic
[1:07:50] utterance through Gifts of and so forth
[1:07:57] mine is a prophetic
[1:08:02] utterance that's the way I work for our
[1:08:16] Lord many of you here's a young
[1:08:20] man some strer
[1:08:22] cases
[1:08:26] a little Waterhead
[1:08:28] baby heart
[1:08:32] trouble and everything else around here
[1:08:36] seting you're right in the dark spot
[1:08:40] aren't
[1:08:41] you now all the
[1:08:44] screaming you do to
[1:08:47] God that is an
[1:08:52] it electricity will light up if you work
[1:08:56] according to law of
[1:08:58] electricity this is the last
[1:09:03] one now there was a man that God was
[1:09:06] fixing to give electricity to the
[1:09:09] world I believe when God's program is
[1:09:13] ready everything will work right to its
[1:09:16] place don't
[1:09:18] you it
[1:09:20] has for ordained to do so
[1:09:28] so Benjamin Franklin went fishing with a
[1:09:32] kite well Lightning
[1:09:35] Run and he caught
[1:09:37] it and he began to run and
[1:09:40] holler I got it I got it got it I got
[1:09:48] it he had
[1:09:50] it but he didn't know what he had
[1:09:58] Prophet says
[1:10:00] well that's what's the matter with our
[1:10:02] Pentecostal
[1:10:04] church with our Pentecostal
[1:10:07] church you've got it but you don't know
[1:10:09] what you
[1:10:12] got that's it that's
[1:10:17] right you've got power enough to Open
[1:10:20] the Eyes of the
[1:10:22] blind
[1:10:24] and stop the ears of the
[1:10:27] de to do all
[1:10:32] things but you come in with a twisted
[1:10:45] atmosphere let's get it in one Accord so
[1:10:48] the Holy Spirit can pour out the go
[1:10:51] shirt down upon the people one place
[1:10:53] play in one
[1:10:57] Accord so the holy spirit is telling us
[1:10:59] to be in one Accord at the
[1:11:03] point that God can pour
[1:11:06] out those
[1:11:08] gushers of
[1:11:10] Miracles and Things Can
[1:11:15] Happen bless be the name of the Lord you
[1:11:18] may if you stand on your
[1:11:21] feet we're going to leave the other
[1:11:23] things
[1:11:24] for
[1:11:32] later when a person is caught by
[1:11:37] electricity that electricity attracts
[1:11:39] that
[1:11:42] person now you can't let go of
[1:11:46] that this the same thing that happens to
[1:11:48] the
[1:11:51] Christian when you're attracted by that
[1:11:53] power of
[1:11:56] God and you can say no longer do I
[1:11:59] live but Christ live within
[1:12:04] me you can get a hold of that
[1:12:07] power
[1:12:09] then to wait for the
[1:12:12] Rapture God bless
[1:12:15] [Applause]
[1:12:20] you
[1:12:22] amen

[1:12:48] afraid even uh even um replacing light
[1:12:56] bulb man
[1:12:58] it's little scary for
[1:13:01] me so those that work around
[1:13:05] electricity have a lot of respect for
[1:13:08] you I replace a fan the entire house
[1:13:11] gets shut

[1:16:31] with fleas
[1:16:35] cor
[1:16:36] well we're going to get into that in
[1:16:39] little in a little
[1:16:41] bit but I have a question for you this
[1:16:48] evening is is
[1:16:50] prayer is it your steering wheel will or
[1:16:54] is it your spare
[1:17:01] tire I want you to think about this for
[1:17:03] the next 20 or so
[1:17:08] minutes is it what guides
[1:17:12] you or is it something
[1:17:15] that it's in it's in the trunk of your
[1:17:22] car
[1:17:24] is it something that you when you get
[1:17:26] into a little bit of trouble you you you
[1:17:29] realize that there's
[1:17:36] prayer I have found myself especially
[1:17:39] this
[1:17:44] year really
[1:17:46] evaluating my prayer
[1:17:50] life you know many times times we we we
[1:17:57] pray we pray for our
[1:18:00] food we pray for uh when we go to
[1:18:05] bed we pray when we get
[1:18:09] up maybe uh there's a petition that
[1:18:13] comes
[1:18:15] in and we see it on our church
[1:18:19] app and many will put in we are praying
[1:18:26] and those things are
[1:18:29] great but when we when we talk about
[1:18:34] prayer when we have when we have read
[1:18:38] this
[1:18:41] scripture of when we would seek
[1:18:45] him when we will search for
[1:18:49] him it doesn't say that we'll find find
[1:18:53] him when we search for
[1:18:56] him but we will find him when we search
[1:18:59] for him with all of our
[1:19:06] heart the question I have asked myself
[1:19:09] over and
[1:19:12] over what have I
[1:19:15] done and have I given the Lord Jesus
[1:19:19] Christ all my
[1:19:21] heart
[1:19:25] even as someone that has that has that
[1:19:28] has been in
[1:19:32] church for 42
[1:19:35] years I still have to find
[1:19:40] myself I still have to ask
[1:19:44] myself where am
[1:19:46] I where am I
[1:19:48] going what am I
[1:19:51] doing is is is is everything that I'm
[1:19:54] doing is it is am I doing it
[1:19:59] correctly and even as a
[1:20:03] minister I find out and I ask myself
[1:20:06] these
[1:20:08] questions am I really searching for God
[1:20:11] with all my
[1:20:14] heart am I really using prayer as my
[1:20:17] steering
[1:20:21] wheel am I really putting everything in
[1:20:24] my
[1:20:28] life every decision that I
[1:20:32] make whatever I do am I really am I
[1:20:36] really putting it towards
[1:20:40] God and really asking him is this the
[1:20:43] right thing to
[1:20:47] do am I really going down the right
[1:20:51] path
[1:20:54] am I doing what's right for my
[1:20:58] wife am I doing what's right for my
[1:21:01] children I ask
[1:21:04] myself and it bothers me so many
[1:21:09] times because I can say yes I
[1:21:13] am there's very few people that go to
[1:21:16] church more than I
[1:21:20] do I can truly say that there
[1:21:23] there is very few people that go to
[1:21:26] church more than I
[1:21:31] do but what does that
[1:21:34] mean what has Church come what has
[1:21:38] Church become to
[1:21:42] me just a place to go to on a on a on a
[1:21:46] Wednesday
[1:21:49] night on a Sunday morning
[1:21:53] Sunday
[1:21:54] afternoon throughout throughout the year
[1:21:57] uh doing uh uh
[1:22:02] conventions is it is it just become
[1:22:05] something that I'm supposed to
[1:22:10] do because of who I
[1:22:14] am and I have to be honest with
[1:22:20] myself I could say yes you're doing the
[1:22:23] right
[1:22:25] thing yes you're you're you're going
[1:22:29] down the right
[1:22:31] path and even everything that we've
[1:22:34] learned over the over the
[1:22:38] years everything that has been taught to
[1:22:43] us from our
[1:22:45] Prophet from our apostle from our
[1:22:49] pastor everything that we have learned
[1:22:54] so many times I feel like I have a
[1:22:57] better way to do
[1:23:00] it no I'm going to do it my
[1:23:04] way because number one it's
[1:23:08] easier it's more it's it's more
[1:23:11] comfortable for
[1:23:13] me it's it's a better
[1:23:17] way and so many
[1:23:20] times we're we're so so
[1:23:23] afraid we're so afraid of of what the
[1:23:27] future is
[1:23:31] holding there's there's a quote that
[1:23:35] says never be
[1:23:37] afraid to trust a known to trust an
[1:23:41] unknown future to a known
[1:23:49] God we don't know what the future is
[1:23:55] but in our life in our
[1:23:58] experience we know what God has
[1:24:02] done amen amen we know what God has
[1:24:06] brought us
[1:24:08] through but when we come to a point in
[1:24:11] our
[1:24:13] lives so many times we have forgotten
[1:24:16] what God has brought us
[1:24:21] from and we say
[1:24:22] okay well I'm in a higher position
[1:24:28] now I feel like I'm like I'm a bit more
[1:24:33] mature I've read all the
[1:24:36] books I've read the Bible I've read the
[1:24:40] message so now I know exactly what to
[1:24:45] do but there's so many
[1:24:47] times in those
[1:24:50] situations when it's not
[1:24:53] when when we go through
[1:24:56] that we use our own
[1:25:00] mentality we become so we become so
[1:25:05] limited we're limited by
[1:25:10] ourselves brother Enrique was was was
[1:25:13] talking about
[1:25:16] excuses and it's everybody's fault
[1:25:18] because of what I of of where I am
[1:25:24] it's everybody else's
[1:25:26] fault well it's the pastor's
[1:25:29] fault well it's it's the youth leaders
[1:25:35] fault well it's my wife's
[1:25:39] fault no no so many times we've got to
[1:25:43] look in the
[1:25:45] mirror and say
[1:25:48] hey it's my
[1:25:51] fault
[1:25:53] just when you
[1:25:55] think where you have reached a
[1:26:00] limit God wants you to go a little bit
[1:26:04] higher but this is this is where the
[1:26:06] flea comes
[1:26:10] in you know a
[1:26:12] flea is an amazing
[1:26:16] creature and if you don't
[1:26:19] know well a
[1:26:21] flea
[1:26:22] it's one of God's
[1:26:24] creatures whether you think it's
[1:26:27] nasty it doesn't
[1:26:30] matter it's one of God's
[1:26:33] creatures all right so get that out of
[1:26:35] your
[1:26:36] mind it's one of God's
[1:26:38] creatures while a
[1:26:41] flea can
[1:26:44] jump up to 36
[1:26:50] in doesn't have wings
[1:26:53] that's how that's how high it can
[1:26:57] jump the
[1:27:01] flea when it wants to
[1:27:04] jump
[1:27:07] horizontally it can jump up to six
[1:27:11] feet now that would be the
[1:27:15] equivalent of brother
[1:27:19] Elijah Elijah jumping 3 50
[1:27:26] ft imagine
[1:27:31] that a creature so
[1:27:36] insignificant that even when King Saul
[1:27:39] was was chasing
[1:27:45] David David referred to
[1:27:49] himself and said why is the king
[1:27:54] chasing a flee like
[1:27:57] me chasing something something that's so
[1:28:05] insignificant but when we go back into
[1:28:07] our
[1:28:10] lives what the devil wants to
[1:28:13] do he wants to limit you where you're
[1:28:20] at he says you can
[1:28:23] jump you can jump like the
[1:28:27] flea I have no problem with
[1:28:31] that but this is the way that people can
[1:28:35] limit a
[1:28:38] flea they would put a flea in a
[1:28:44] jar well and then they would put a lid
[1:28:47] on
[1:28:49] it well because the flea jumps
[1:28:55] and it's in his
[1:28:57] nature he starts to
[1:29:00] jump and immediately he hits the cap or
[1:29:04] the lid of the
[1:29:08] jar over and
[1:29:11] over the flea keeps on hitting his head
[1:29:16] on the lid of the
[1:29:20] jar and for three
[1:29:23] days the flea will do
[1:29:27] this because it's in his
[1:29:31] nature after the three
[1:29:34] days the flea
[1:29:36] is well his head's a little
[1:29:43] sore he starts to think
[1:29:46] well I'm going to
[1:29:49] jump but I'm not going to jump as high
[1:29:51] as as I used
[1:29:54] to because now he's
[1:29:58] Limited in this
[1:30:00] jar of How High he can
[1:30:03] jump so he starts to
[1:30:06] jump and he says okay I'm
[1:30:10] jumping but now I'm not hitting
[1:30:14] myself now I still do everything that I
[1:30:17] used to
[1:30:20] do and I can
[1:30:23] jump and he jumps and doesn't hit his
[1:30:26] head
[1:30:28] anym and he feels
[1:30:30] everything is good
[1:30:34] now what's amazing about
[1:30:38] it is that once the
[1:30:43] flea has
[1:30:46] Offspring The
[1:30:50] Offspring they have the same mentality
[1:30:53] as their
[1:30:56] parents so what
[1:30:58] happens the lid is
[1:31:02] removed the flea
[1:31:05] jumps but he can't escape the
[1:31:11] jar he has been
[1:31:14] programmed all of this
[1:31:17] time to
[1:31:19] know that if he jumps higher than where
[1:31:22] he's
[1:31:24] at he is going to hit his
[1:31:28] head so not only is he jumping a certain
[1:31:32] a certain
[1:31:36] height but now he's telling his
[1:31:40] children his
[1:31:43] offspring you
[1:31:44] know we used to be
[1:31:48] able we used to be
[1:31:50] able to jump as high as we wanted
[1:31:55] to oh but we're limited
[1:31:58] now because if you if you
[1:32:03] try if you try and jump with everything
[1:32:06] that you
[1:32:08] have you're GNA
[1:32:10] fail you're going to hit your
[1:32:12] head you're only going to reach a
[1:32:14] certain
[1:32:17] height even when the lid is
[1:32:20] removed
[1:32:22] the
[1:32:25] mentality so the
[1:32:28] parents are
[1:32:31] limited and they take that
[1:32:35] limitation and they take that and they
[1:32:38] place it on their
[1:32:44] children and they
[1:32:47] say you're
[1:32:50] limited you can only do so
[1:32:55] much and over and
[1:32:58] over Offspring after
[1:33:02] Offspring have the same
[1:33:09] mentality why we see other people at at
[1:33:12] another
[1:33:16] level and we wonder
[1:33:19] why why can I
[1:33:22] why can't I get out of this
[1:33:25] situation why am I still stuck just
[1:33:28] thinking church is good
[1:33:34] enough why am I
[1:33:37] stuck
[1:33:39] thinking that oh that this that this
[1:33:42] prayer that I'm
[1:33:44] praying is good
[1:33:49] enough church we get stuck
[1:33:53] we're
[1:33:55] limited the doctor tells us
[1:33:58] something and we're limited to what his
[1:34:00] diagnosis
[1:34:03] is say you're
[1:34:05] sick he say yes I
[1:34:08] am you say you're not going to get any
[1:34:13] better that's right doctor I'm not going
[1:34:15] to get any
[1:34:18] better and it keeps on going year after
[1:34:20] year
[1:34:23] and we look at
[1:34:25] ourselves and I see myself from when I
[1:34:29] from when I was 20 years
[1:34:33] ago I look at myself and says who who is
[1:34:36] this
[1:34:38] guy who is this guy that that that would
[1:34:42] preach on how how beautiful faith
[1:34:48] is how how we've got the power to of for
[1:34:52] any
[1:34:55] situation and who is this guy that's so
[1:35:02] scared who's this guy that's
[1:35:05] afraid because what what he what the
[1:35:08] devil is telling
[1:35:10] him he's saying yeah that's the truth
[1:35:15] Satan I can't be better than what I am
[1:35:20] today I can't do
[1:35:22] it I'm not worthy to do
[1:35:25] it and year after
[1:35:28] year we think that with ourselves to
[1:35:32] ourselves and we start believing
[1:35:35] it sooner or later we start transferring
[1:35:39] that to our wives to our
[1:35:44] children and we say because I am this
[1:35:47] way you have to be that
[1:35:50] way
[1:35:54] because I'm in this this condition you
[1:35:57] have to be in
[1:36:06] this and we limit
[1:36:11] ourselves and we limit the gifts God
[1:36:14] gives to
[1:36:16] us we limit our
[1:36:20] children
[1:36:23] we limit them to
[1:36:26] saying we limit them and we tell
[1:36:31] them this is as good as it's going to
[1:36:37] get you're
[1:36:39] fine
[1:36:42] good
[1:36:44] good don't try and strive for anything
[1:36:46] else Beyond this because this is the
[1:36:50] best
[1:36:54] and we go and we go through life jumping
[1:36:57] and
[1:37:00] shouting and this yes this is
[1:37:05] it
[1:37:09] yet we see ourselves in the mirror years
[1:37:16] later blaming everybody else around
[1:37:20] us
[1:37:22] for us not being able to succeed in
[1:37:27] life brother and sister I'm not telling
[1:37:29] I'm not I'm not I'm not saying about
[1:37:34] financially or economically
[1:37:37] no no but when we succeed in
[1:37:43] life what what do I mean by
[1:37:48] that when we can truly
[1:37:55] with all of our
[1:37:59] heart help somebody in
[1:38:04] need without even caring about getting
[1:38:07] something in
[1:38:12] return it seems like we're always
[1:38:14] wanting hey if I do this for you while
[1:38:17] you know you owe me one later in
[1:38:20] life
[1:38:26] you owe
[1:38:28] me but
[1:38:30] really have we limited ourselves to
[1:38:35] that have we limited ourselves to to not
[1:38:40] caring about those that are around
[1:38:47] us but I want to tell you there's some
[1:38:51] good
[1:38:54] news how many like good
[1:38:59] news there is a certain lady that
[1:39:04] that wound up thanking
[1:39:15] God pretty is pretty crazy huh yes uh
[1:39:22] she ended up thanking God for an INF
[1:39:24] infestation of
[1:39:30] fleas this lady was in in the time of of
[1:39:35] the second world
[1:39:41] war she wasn't a Jew but her family
[1:39:44] would help would help
[1:39:48] Jews she would help them hide
[1:39:54] he would feed
[1:39:57] him he was in the little town of Harlem
[1:40:01] out right outside of Amsterdam Amsterdam
[1:40:04] in the Netherlands
[1:40:11] uh one
[1:40:13] day one day the Germans came
[1:40:19] in and they took her entire family
[1:40:24] away eventually her father her
[1:40:28] mother and her siblings passed
[1:40:32] away in the
[1:40:36] camps it was only her and her sister
[1:40:42] left they had uh they had been taken to
[1:40:46] this
[1:40:49] camp and they were were able to smuggle
[1:40:52] in a
[1:41:00] Bible for for many
[1:41:04] days they would read the Bible in
[1:41:09] secret and
[1:41:12] finally after about after about a month
[1:41:15] or
[1:41:16] so they started having a little bible
[1:41:19] study there
[1:41:22] and they wondered
[1:41:25] why why they were
[1:41:29] able so freely to talk about the love of
[1:41:37] God why they were able so freely to to
[1:41:41] be able to sing
[1:41:47] hyns one day as they were as they were
[1:41:49] sewing uh socks for the for the
[1:41:56] soldiers this lady named Cory
[1:42:01] tenom she asked her
[1:42:05] supervisor is this the right size that I
[1:42:08] that I that I uh that I need to make the
[1:42:14] socks is this the right
[1:42:17] material and she says can you come and
[1:42:20] tell us
[1:42:24] can you come into our room and tell us
[1:42:26] if we're doing it
[1:42:30] right the supervisor saids I ain't going
[1:42:33] in
[1:42:36] there she says why won't you come into
[1:42:39] our
[1:42:41] room we ain't going in
[1:42:45] there many more months passed
[1:42:48] by they would hear the cries of other
[1:42:51] women in in different
[1:42:55] buildings they were getting
[1:42:58] abused and they wondered
[1:43:02] why in their building no one was getting
[1:43:10] abused they wondered
[1:43:13] why no Soldier would enter in into their
[1:43:19] building
[1:43:21] until one
[1:43:23] day they started reading a
[1:43:28] scripture and it starts with first
[1:43:33] Thessalonians
[1:43:37] 15 and as they read this in their little
[1:43:40] bible
[1:43:43] study it says that see that none render
[1:43:48] evil for evil unto any man
[1:43:54] but ever follow that which is good both
[1:43:57] among yourselves and to all
[1:44:04] men and even in their situation they
[1:44:06] read Rejoice ever
[1:44:11] more pray without
[1:44:16] seizing
[1:44:17] 18 in everything give thanks
[1:44:25] in everything give
[1:44:29] thanks you know what they give what they
[1:44:32] gave thanks
[1:44:35] for because when they first entered into
[1:44:37] that
[1:44:41] building Corey got down on her
[1:44:47] knees along with her s along with her
[1:44:49] sister
[1:44:51] and they asked
[1:44:54] God show
[1:44:57] us show us
[1:45:02] how show us how to
[1:45:06] live in a
[1:45:08] building infested with
[1:45:13] fleas after many
[1:45:18] months they said
[1:45:22] God thank you for the
[1:45:26] fleas because it was the
[1:45:29] fleas that protected
[1:45:33] them from all these men trying to go
[1:45:37] in you see it was so
[1:45:41] bad that these men didn't want anything
[1:45:44] to do
[1:45:49] with so in your
[1:45:54] life we may limit God
[1:45:58] sometimes but brother and
[1:46:01] sister if we can really see what God is
[1:46:06] doing if we can get this scripture and
[1:46:09] say pray without
[1:46:13] ceasing
[1:46:15] Rejoice give thanks in all
[1:46:19] things you might not be where you should
[1:46:24] be thank

[1:47:02] you for being so kind to
[1:47:06] us thank you
[1:47:09] Lord for when we were yet
[1:47:13] sinners I think that is one of the
[1:47:16] most one of the most beautiful script in
[1:47:20] the
[1:47:24] Bible when we were
[1:47:28] unlovable when we were
[1:47:31] Sinners when we were
[1:47:34] unworthy God looked at
[1:47:37] us he drew near to
[1:47:41] us says I love
[1:47:45] you how beautiful that I'm going to ask
[1:47:47] you to
[1:47:48] stand how great that
[1:47:51] is even in our own crazy in even in even
