is once again the the rapping together of our names le puse airports - t - o LM LM LM volviendo kuntala numerous and as we as I as I prepared for this message omit escape Roberto Perez them exactly there's there's the next message that I was that I was preparing for the memory para por el próximo Marquis but but I realized that I could not fully get that next until I until I get this one down immediate okay no podía preparar and completamente stuck at their mini con st and so the reason i read this scripture in a super quality sk2 that III pray that you understand where I'm coming from espero contain them that they don't they may don't even go and never never should I or would I use the pulpit to bash or to bad-mouth someone in okay oh sorry al pulpit opera there are medallion but but we do have to make the people aware that was eternal I can tell Tonto of the of the the spirits and the things that are going around today de los espiritu's eco sasaki and someone sent me a video I'll get the other day ma'am you me zero and it's of a brother singing a song is the owner manual I can't I guess he had made up the song and composer can't and I as I said I'm not attacking the brother I don't I don't know the brother Konoha but what got me okay so was not just the words of the song no solo foreign las palabras de saber tanto the reaction of the people la reacción de la gente that that that's what really it it's sad in my heart may this yo me could I don't fill my heart with such sadness I tell you mean by the or tanto and like I said it's not just because of the words but but but to see the people just just taking it and saying yes yes no sólo las palabras that come to us you know like a takeover xeo now and and the song in the song en el canto it mentions it just it states this means your night is a stone that Ephesians 4 Disick a physios Quatro is not enough no it's by standing to bring this bride in shape but a para her eyes dunno yeah and as I said it hurt me to my soul to to hear that email Alma in other words they they feel that the Ministry of Ephesians 4 since you think and they stated their fists which is known as the fivefold ministry it's gonna see a comeback into pieces it's not enough to get a bride ready know as bastante para para know that that Ephesians 4 has failed FSU's quatrefoil yellow and and when you look at that and don't know mean it saddens you because you realize that Ephesians 4 is part of the sacred scriptures interest in supporting official pastors but today and IIIi don't believe that that Ephesians 4 has failed you know KF is quite rough I yeah we may fail as men Oh mom risky Santos fine but God's Word never fails Peniel no fun we have to make sure that that that is settled within us in a case ago that's okay yes and they don't matter who or how popular the man is if it again okay the poorest people are or who they may be or who their name is okay I wanna always what's that we always remember what this is him pray that God's Word will never fail when he says that he placed this fivefold ministry in the church 22nd Iglesia color coat is the memorial perfecting of the Saints for Allah perfection or the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ if you could've at believes that this ministry will have a bride ready but I do not know there we understand that this ministry does not preach its own message the most custom is there's no prints but it is a vision ministry that is keeping the voice of Elijah alive it assistant ministerial came until I was alias Eva through all the divisions at restore all the fanaticism Infinity's all the false doctrines all has no penis for there has to be a bride that is being perfect dick ever gonna know yet kisses that but it's just because someone does not see it happening in their life does not mean it's not happening but Calvin the lava contestants with visas no kidding ck no contest era there is a ministry i unum in estate that is working according to the plan that was left guess that there are handle the equivalent casinos where they have them and why the people even in the message today he put kill I think they don't go in and don't even want to recognize the plan Noriko no Sanel plan and that plan is in the message taking sides with Gaz silk Amanda let's go what are they done with that message yeah mister cornice they put it to the side as if it doesn't exist they don't work um okay yeah Maxie's let me tell you something the committee realize there is a mystical body of the Lord Jesus on earth today are you quite a permissive coding and that is what I mean edified yes acquit but the hell if the body is being perfected the end of perfection alone brother brother Henry ash gave me this this quote Henry missed a strap and it's in the exposition stand exposición the smear in church age any listener if you don't think that this is true it says he says you know Pincess casters but just listen to this guy's all over the world or total moon in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups is Rupa's Pentecostal is group which they are and organizing the businessmen it's an organic center low somebody's in it was they have invaded the pulpit an ambassador lost Fulton without a call from God he knew your mother did you they have styled themselves the fishers of men is the end model of tomorrow's pescado disease and the founders of a move of God in front of others they'll move me into this they say he's a gifted ministry in ministerial visions for 10 through 13 the official qualities and traits that God gave the church he killed as your legal is either saying that it has failed and okay off a yellow so they are taking over tennis wind okay here we are right in the midst at least almost a measure of the fulfillment of prophecy into the prophecy called the gainsaying of korah gemelos ditches bag and a lot is the quran and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it in the same can one complete oh they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth is tempra contrast here just experiencia poor veteran may God have pity on their on them can you think a less demanding and may their eyes be open before it's too late Oh cause when I sent up here but when you see he conduced a via a social I'll go so see your financial structure the structure Athena come into the church in l agree that divides the folks in any way any video a la gente it whatever though is not of God it's not noise de Dios I'm gonna say it again church oh boy when you see a social or financial structure minister to response here that has come into the church and trolley list that divides the folk in any way in question that is not of God just don't know is that the earth it is another sign of the time I am do this physically rich case pc commentary but spiritually impoverish Maori CNA John from Reseda spiritual men telling listen which we are now living in la cual estamos ie this is why I don't believe that just because a person preaches that they're part of the fivefold ministry was karaoke persona kappa can or Jesse because a person has a gift or has an office does it make them part of that ministry get in and on an official no necessity part is it not even just because they read the quotes do they do they can we say that yeah it is part they are part of the ministry or pork analysis track to the Prophet Allah says little key but I believe that this is an elective group of men you know kiss this one group Willie he though their hands picked from before the foundation of the world feel a specific job at a complete America specific brother branham in the message questions and answers on the skills we know this is very well gonna say my sister would the Bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture no get them thrown ministerio antes del grab don't sure he says CD say that's what's going on right now is look at anyone doing the Bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour the Bride of Christ la novia de Cristo sure see she consists of apostles and prophets consisted their post ELISA Pro features evangelists and pastors master-servant Calista's he says is that right it's correct oh it's a question is that right it was correct that's the Bride of Christ yes as an organic she she goes got a ministry didn't minister a great ministry grant minister the ministry of the hour in a ministerial order and it'll be so humble instead at unwielding this ministry is they along with the believers of this age instead of your current Americanos ministers they are simply the elected witnesses of this endtime sana a test he goes and he goes Paris Ted I'm gonna tell you once again so you know we we know this in but our stance taken missile is very participant on estamos para there is no way that Ephesians 4 has then in good Morris kfs use Quatro DNA it has failed okay I gather will fail okay Wi-Fi yet or can fail oh you're not very excited about that time we I'm gonna say that again no well there is no way than good model that is visions for officials has failed after yellow will fail for yet huh or can fill up again because if he's ins for once again is the echo but if this is quattro silicon they're not preaching their own message this company can do su propia means the echo of what the mouthpiece of God has already spoken it and equally local I look at this goes yeah nada they only repeat what they have seen or what they have witnessed or repeated look can bestow or look mb they don't have once again their own message no
