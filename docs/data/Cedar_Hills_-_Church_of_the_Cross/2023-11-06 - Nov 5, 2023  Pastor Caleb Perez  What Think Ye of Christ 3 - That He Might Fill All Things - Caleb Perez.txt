me asking the Lord to keep me safe bless me with health and bless me to prosper and the very next day I received a call from my supervisor informing me that there were some abnormalities from my annual firefighter [Music] physical from over from over a month earlier and that I could not return to duty until I consult with the specialist I must admit that initially I was a little shocked then the shock almost turned to anger because Satan was threatening my [Music] livelihood but the Lord reminded me not to allow the enemy to steal my Shalom my peace and trust in him then after informing my wife as to my situation she immediately reminded me of our recent subject from Bible [Music] Study Bible study which is which is that I have shamida the Lord's [Music] release Shila and that he has already paid that bill for me so there was no need to worry during my first call to a specialist I was informed that they were booking out an an appointment for late February so I consulted with brother Tim and sister Bonnie for guidance and to see if she knew of a specialist who may be able to help me out but the next day which was Friday before I could call Sister Bonnie's contact I received a call from my immediate supervisor and best friend's wife that I would be receiving a call on Monday from a doctor's office to confirm an appointment for me for Tuesday morning after undergoing some test and Consulting with the specialist I was immediately cleared for work then as I was driving to work and praising the Lord I received a [Music] revelation that not only did the Lord know of the test I would have to [Music] endure but he had already blessed me with the reward for trusting in Him although I had to miss one day of work the Lord Jesus Christ had already set me up with an extra 16 hours of overtime for [Music] training three hours of overtime for the doctor's appointment with the specialist and a full overtime shift a few days later the Lord blessed me twofold for what Satan tried to steal hallelujah hallelujah and that is from our brother Michael Harold this is Michael [Applause] Harold amen what a mighty God we serve we have a petition this

do we want to say thank you to the the ministers brother Abraham brother Tom brother Jimmy and brother Ben did such a wonderful job in the on Wednesday we had uh a pastoral conference with the brothers in in Uganda amen so amen we're grateful to God for that and also such a wonderful time at a Bible study brother Marcus's house on Friday wonderful fellowship and always that's the greatest thing we can do is fellowship amen amen many remember the threefold purpose easy now huh easy why some of you looking through your notes you can this should be just easy okay help me out before we sit down help me out here number one to reveal himself in Christ number two what was that to have preeminence in his bride and number three to restore the kingdom God in Christ Christ in his bride a restored Eden scripture we've been reading is Matthew the 22nd chapter in verse 41 and 42 when you have it you can say Amen you're trusting the Lord this morning for Words of Life got it all right Matthew 22:41 42 says while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of David father almighty God we simply come today Lord father having placed ourselves to one side Lord may it be you that comes Lord on the scene may they not see brother Caleb but may they see and may they hear you Lord this morning May the words that come forth Lord may they be your words that are both spirit and they are life and Lord may as it goes forth may it Quicken to the hearts of the people and may each one Lord receive what they came for today we thank you as we leave ourselves in this service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated remember the quote that we have read with this scripture your decision on what the scripture asked will seal your Eternal destination what a what a thing it is huh doesn't get old it's a tremendous thing to understand what think ye of Christ ask your neighbor real quick nebor what do you think of Christ it's a good question because many people have their own ideas of who and what Christ is and it's impossible in one message to tell you everything that Christ is but we'll go in the line that God has that he leads us this morning the word Christ in Greek is Christos which means the anointed one also means the Messiah and and here Jesus the Messiah the Christ is actually asking them what they think of him but he's not telling them that who he is he's just asking them the question in the Jewish eschatology the term term Mash or Messiah it refers to the Future Jewish King that was to come from the deic line who is expected to save the nation of is of Israel and will be Anointed with holy anointing oil and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic age now that's what they say we we know better than that because their eyes were blinded and I think we should thank the Lord this morning that their eyes were blinded for our sake I don't know about you but I I thank the Lord for that if they would have seen that Jesus was the Christ the great Messiah that they were waiting for we would never have had an opportunity but we know that Jesus they don't see this but that Jesus is the Messiah how many agree with that and we know brother Bram says that he's already been anointed yes everybody knows that he's already been anointed he doesn't have to be anointed again it's the same way as the temple the Temple of Solomon it was dedicated anointed when it was knocked down and they rebuilt the temple they didn't have to anoint it again already there but now when we when we see the Christ and and maybe maybe on the next time I Minister I sure would like to go into anointing the most holy but let's let's go for a moment here to acts the second chapter and I pray you have your Bibles here because it's we've got a lot of scriptures so get your Bibles out and I pray that you learn this morning nobody's in a hurry this morning okay then let's let's find out about this he was anointed already who anointed him God anointed him okay yes or yes see see we we we understand the the the different the anointing in the types and shadows but acts 236 says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly now now this is tremendous because they were blinded but even though as a nation or or as a people they were blinded the the first church that that that the people that that made up the first church age a lot of them were Jews that's one of the tremendous things that's one of the Mysteries how that the church was the early church was made up with both Jews and Gentiles but here he says that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified made him both Lord and Christ in other words he made him both Supreme author having supreme authority he made him the master the controller and he made him the anointed Messiah now but but they don't see this as I said because they were blinded to this the Bible tells us and you can just write it down 11:25 of the book of Romans that blindness in part is happened to Israel until another words there was something coming until the fullness of the Gentiles become in now now they're blinded in part when once again but there's something that's going to happen that will contribute to them receiving their sight again I don't know if you know how important we are to the plan of God blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become come in in other words until the fullness of what Christ was going to pour into the church has been poured into it that's easy enough right amen and and and then the last member coming in that's why we put a subtitle as he might feel all things godes that's why we don't believe in sprinkling right there's no there's no scripture for that to just sprinkle now full immersion God doesn't want to just feel part of you he wants to feel all of you he wants to fill every part of your body Spirit Soul he wants to fill your your mind he wants to fill all space and time that's who he was in the beginning he was Elohim he existed of himself but he filled all space and time how many of you want him to fill all this space right here how many of you want him to fill all your time if he filled all our time we wouldn't have time to get into trouble we wouldn't have time to think of the things we think of but he wants to fill all space and all time that's the only way that he will ever have preeminence in us if I were to ask you the question question how many of you does does Christ have total preeminence in that's a question for you to ask yourself I don't need to I don't need to see hands but once again how many of you does Christ have total preeminence the only way that he can have full preeminence is that he must be in you and you must be in [Applause] him I I I hope that doesn't confuse you he's got to be in you and you got to be in him that's full preeminence now notice this now in that day you shall know that I am in the father the father is in me I in you and you in me total preeminence all right when we see this Colossians the first chapter and the 15th verse what do you think of Christ who is he well Paul tells us colians who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature in other words there was no image to Elohim there was no form brother brandham says it's too mysterious as much as you would want to to imagine your imagination barely goes up a little bit and then it covers everything and nothing moves there's nothing there it seems like it anyways nothing covers all space and time and our imagination is working Overdrive I want to understand you Lord I want to know you so we're we're there in the darkness trying to understand Elohim but he did something for us he says I'm going to create I'm going to birth off of myself once again God giving birth and he gives birth to the logos and the logos is Christ that's the anointing that's the pillar of fire that's the great theophany we can go on and on he's the image of the invisible God and without him you can't see him for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things can we say that together in all things he might have preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell preeminence means that he's number one right he's number one in rank he's number one in influence right come on everybody there's a lot of influence out there influ right but he's number one in influence number one in rank once again how many can say I have given him full preeminence what think you of Christ if you say you're in love with him but you don't give him full preeminence you're showing how you're answering the question think he of Christ Colossians 29 n for in him dwelleth part of the godhead yes or no or no come on I need you alive I need you alert this morning for in him dwelleth three quarters of the godhead in him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead bottle the fullness is the completion the godhead is the Divinity and the bodily is the Corporal or the physical so when we see what really is going on what think ye of Christ the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ yes or yes the entire Bible is the expression of one goal one purpose that he wanted to achieve and now in these last days this secret this mystery that was in the back part of God's mind now in this last day he has revealed it and he has showed it he hides it from the the the the eyes from the from the wise of and prudent and he reveals it unto babes such as wom Christ he is the principal theme of the entire Bible you can't if you can't see Christ in every verse of the Bible then you read it again because you missed something the Bible is Christ he is the word tell your neighbor the Bible is Christ he is the word when you read in the beginning God created there's Christ yes or yes in the beginning God Christ is there oh we're getting into some some good stuff and if put together right there is the entire picture of the fall and regeneration the whole picture of creation and God's whole plan revealed right there in Jesus Christ he's the principal theme of The Bible we've read this many times he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ he was in the prophets in the Psalms in the history in the Bible is the things that is to come and he will be before and after what does that make him then the same yesterday today and then if he is that he should be the Principal theme of our talking what think you of Christ he should be the Principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the Principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the Principal them of everything we do say or think it should be Christ I think that would be enough for me just to walk down and say God just to live that wow don't have to try to live anything just live that think ye of Christ when we see this if he's not then the Bible or if he's not in you then the word is not in you and the only way you can actually be a Christian for Christ to identify himself in you once again in him Christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead body now now now this is is something that that really gets me because that's as far as the Revelation goes to many people in him dwelt the fullness of the God he expressed himself God expressing himself and that's where the church stops that's as far as the religious people go everything was poured into Christ thank God once again that he would send a prophet the Revelation continues now you must see Christ in every verse in every song but you better see the bride there too you better see yourself there what good would it do to see Christ in every scripture but you don't see yourself you don't see the bride something's wrong here we have not really understood Christ the mystery it was to reveal this this is in the message Christ is the first it was to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then I like that it's a continuation here and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bod bring it into the people now are we are we making sense here we he he he he was the fullness in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily but now he wants to take that and put that into the people that he might he all things again all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church watch what he says here he wants to bring the fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the pinen the oversight the leading and now tell your neighbor Now read that with me and now the complete fullness of the godhead Bly dwells in his church the preeminence I want you to say it again and says now the complete compl fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in us right I'm not going to stay just stay with dwells in the church part of that bride I believe so the fullness of the godhead body dwells in not one of us but it dwells in us the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ The Works that I do shall you do also that's why he says behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and in there there would be a Time come there would be a Time come forth is that future or is it now come on church now in there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the what a thing no wonder in 1 Timothy 3:16 he says without controversy great is the mystery of God manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit being of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into Glory he wants to fill us every every corner he don't want you to have some little fake door but Brother Carlos what is it called in a kitchen there's a oh yeah it's a fake door you open it up it goes into a pantry know right and we have a lot of those Butler pantries in and we always expect God to do something for us right away right but we're not completely honest with him all the time okay notice this now be careful what we fill ourselves up with ideas oh that's a good idea ever say that it's a good idea yeah means that means that you that you swallowed it line and sing Creeds and dogmas doctrines and people are being filled every day Israel says we're going to wipe out Hamas they were interviewing a man and he said this Hamas isn't just an organization or a people Hamas is an idea when that idea gets hold you can try to kill the people but the idea it's hard to eradicate it it's easier to kill a human than to kill an idea you can try to eradicate iate the people but it's so hard to eradicate an idea that has found a home in the mind in the heart of the person that believes it's hard to eradicate an idea that there's purpose behind it but I thank the Lord this morning and I praise him because God's thoughts have been expressed look what they tried to do to the Jews in World War II they tried to eradicate them but they couldn't nor will they ever accomplish that because they are God's people and the logos which is not just an idea but it is the thought it is the word it is the Divine expression of God's thoughts and they can never be eradicated you can't kill that what is eternal remember it's hard to kill an idea get into the church World prophet of God says you know there's there's really two extreme or radical ideas the first one is that God is three that there are three Gods three persons that's a radical idea are to kill that idea that God is father son Holy Ghost three people making up the godhead no no it's three offices now that should eradicate that idea unless the idea has settled in your heart then you're going to need some certain the next idea he says is Jesus only a radical idea too because Jesus only you're making Jesus his own father and Jesus had a father they're both radically wrong but remember now it is one God in three offices coming down created a blood cell a body was formed and he filled that body oh wow now that's that's that's that's too much for the human mind because we say how could he all eternity and expand and and fill everything and then and then he comes down into a body this is ABCs right but there's a lot of new people and that's what I'm I'm after this I want to help them bring them up to this to understanding he then gave a his life a ransom and through the broken blood cell God's own life was let loose and it returned on the worshipper God doesn't do nothing halfway we can go through acts the second chapter and just write it down real quick that's the day of Pentecost there was a sound of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house okay he's filling and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost we keep on reading these scriptures like John 1 verse4 the word was made flesh dwelt amongst us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth verse 16 and of his fullness of his fullness have all we received and Grace for Grace I like that scripture Ephesians 3:19 and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God tell everywhere we look we see Christ that Caleb might be filled but put your name there that Caleb might be filled with the fullness of God Ephesians 1:9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him verse 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that f all in all how does that fullness come are you with me still we're building a good foundation here how does this fullness come let's let's find out Ephesians the fourth chapter verse 10 he that descended is the same also so that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things are you included there I'm talking about that he might fill all things how is he filling all things he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastor and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the stature of the fullness of Christ Christ is the anointing is the anointed one the logos and the family comes through that anointing okay now I I say all these things and and here we're going to we're going to start getting into if God created man in his own image and in his own likeness what kind of man did he create created a spirit man but you can't see a spirit he made man in his own image because man was supposed to lead the cattles and the Beast just the same way that the the Holy Spirit leads the believer today so out of God came this logos and out of the logos forth a man no man has seen God at any time no man can see God in the bodily form because God is not in body form God is a spirit all right no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father hath declared okay now here here we go now Genesis 126 God said let us make man in our image after our likeness now we are made in the image of God how many here have been were made in the image of God once again this is very important we are made in the image of God but we are not the image oh you got to you got to understand this church because if not then you're going to go off with some little ideas oh we're the image of God no no no the image of the invisible God was Christ not a bunch of men not a bunch of people the image of the invisible God is Christ so we are not the image even though we are images of Christ you got to you got to get is this is so important once again we are not the image we are images of Christ but we are his likeness all right all right okay we we got to make sure that this is settled good tell your neighbor neighbor we are not the image we are the likeness why brother Brandon preaches the message images of Christ why because it's him in us and we're producing The Works that he would do so we become images but we are actually his likeness oh I like this the likeness is the female part tell your neighbor the likess is the female part okay that's why he made both male and female the son of man would be revealed in the last days has it been revealed yes some say oh brother brandham he he was the son of man no he wasn't he was the [Applause] likeness Hallelujah I'm going to say it again was he the son of man no no he was a son of man revealing the son of man he was the likeness because he was one like unah okay I got you your attention now we're getting into the message now this is very important and not only him but but he has a bride and she is his likeness Watch this once again and the likeness is the bride and she is part of the ministry of the son of man and what is that Ministry to unite the bride and Grom together like Adam and Eve unite him together so he can restore the kingdom that's ABCs right are you are you the image Christ is the image of the invisible God we are his likeness now watch this now the bride when you read that scripture the bride once again is the likeness Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God now watch our founding Pastor he said as God poured it into Christ Christ then poured it into the church then the bride in turn pours it back into Christ you you better you better get get your Chompers out that was that was a chunk of meat God all that he was pour into Christ was he pours into the church now the church pours it back into Christ let's see what he says you know what he says he said that was P that one passed right over our heads all right he says you might get it a little later this is this is a little later this is the now you're going to get it a little bit later but but this is the now because the bride she's got to rest oh we're getting pinch yourself I'm telling you forget about the and everything on the stove we got to get this spiritually first she's got to rest Jesus is resting he's got a different mask now the bride has to put on the image of the man and she can only do that by becoming bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his spirit and when she does the spirit and the bride say come not until then watch he goes on watch the word rest in rest he uncovers he takes off his mask and all that God was that poured into Christ Christ was he poured into the church and that is his rest get all these points all that God was in Christ all that Christ is resting now in his church in his bride he's resting in you he's resting in what you're going to do show me show them show them what how to do this I trust you not until you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're under tutors and governors until that time that is his rest he's resting on what you're going to do his rest is nothing else but what you're doing if the Holy Ghost is resting in you then Christ has entered into his rest and then now you must enter into his rest and his rest is to do the will of the father that's the rest usually I'm going to go rest ah long been a long day not the rest he's talking about did you know that the Christian Life the Christian walk is based on rest and you can only fully rest when he has preeminence in your life watch as we go continue on still with me watch this now the man was placed in charge here as far as that's concerned I am a man the man that we have here yeah a man but in the mystical Body of Christ I'm not a man part of the bride of Christ right and brother brandham is not the man either he's part of the Bride also oh there are points where he stands there the the same as when uh a pastor the spiritual husband of a church but when you see the macro even the pastor is there is the bride of Christ he's there representing I don't have no problem with that in representation but the male is the Lord Jesus Christ he is the son of man watch this now this is what Elohim coming forth came forth from him the Loos and from the logos there was a that that was the light and from that light come out a man who made it God watch this is this this is nitty-gritty now who who made it God who made the man the Son of God oh that one that one that one didn't hit good that one didn't hit good the logos he calls the logos the Son of God he created all things you say only Elohim is the creator the spirit of Elohim went into the logos it was still him creating but now he had a form that's right he couldn't say let us make Man Without a form he couldn't say let us make man in the image and the likeness he couldn't do that there was no form but he could do it in the sense of that he created man the spirit first and then he began creation creation creation that was Christ the logos the angel of the Covenant come on you got to put your your floaties on we're going to go into some deep water anybody know how to dog padle [Music] you get tired though after a while huh pedling in church after a while I'm tired already overload no no get all the junk out this is what it's doing this morning clearing out the channels clearing out the junk the logos that came out of God brother Bram says was the son of God yet later on we're going to find out that he calls the logos the Everlasting or Eternal Father how can it be both we'll get to that question not today in another one but Christ lived in that body but watch now why that's why Jesus could say I come from God in other words I come from that logos I go back to God or back to the logos when Paul seen him he was the logos that's why when you see this picture oh they have a picture of a man there it's actually the picture of that logos right the light that came out of Elohim the beginning Angel of the Covenant that from there all things were created get all these little things no and when we see this now that same logos has a part yes amen I don't know are you are you bored this morning the same logos has a part that logos has a bride tell your neighbor say neighbor that logos has a bride and I'm a part of that bride Christ must and will have preeminence in who is this bride that came forth song of Solomon's chapter 6 verse 8 there are three score Queens that's 60 queens and four score concubines and are virgins without number these are all the churches but my Dove my undefiled is only one I don't know that don't make you feel special Dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bear her watch what verse 10 says who is she that lookth forth as the morning Fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners that is the Bride of the logos that is my Dove she's only one lots of churches this morning but she is only one Isaiah 545 for maker is thine husband the Lord of hosts is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel let's see if they can eradicate that the god of the whole Earth shall he be called where did he get the material to make usow come on now where did he get the material from from himself where did he get the materials to to to form and to make Eve from the man he didn't go back to the dust he got it from the man he pulled a rib and the same way that he put Adam to sleep and pulled out one of his ribs the same way he did with Jesus they put him to death they put him to sleep and they thought they were killing him but it was actually the Fulfillment of what he had done in the Garden of Eden because it was them that he pulled out of him the bride of Christ you had to put him to sleep the same way now I want to turn a corner here Matthew 16 and this this is there's so much to preach on and I I'm not here to try to wear you out I'm but what think ye of Christ all right Matthew 16 and you you you know this very well well-known scripture he saith unto them who who do you say that I am Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God what a tremendous thing he knew who he was he stated who he was you're the Christ you're the Messiah the Son of the Living God said Simon you're you're blessed blessing blood didn't reveal this my Father which is in heaven and then he goes down to verse 20 and then he charged he his disciples that he should tell that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ now watch this as we as we turn this corner you know now it's been revealed revealed to you all don't go and tell anyone else that he was the Christ the anointed one the Messiah is this not what we do many times we go and we hear something and we run with it did you know this did you know that but but do we live it here's the thing we got a lot of head knowledge about this the Bible the a lot we know a lot of but but when you when you really look at this that was the rock confession brother says now he conf confessed it he had the Revelation but his body hadn't caught up to it yet this is all he's telling them don't tell no man I am the Christ not yet why because your your body has to match up or or catch up to your confession when your body catches up to the confession then you can say he is the Christ many are with me now watch this we say a lot of things but but our body doesn't match up it's got to match up notice this is where I'm getting to John chapter 7 and verse 40 it it says just kind of paraphrase it here's a lot of the people they said of Truth this is the prophet others said this is the Christ but some said well shall Christ come out of Galilee you see they had been programmed already they had accepted another idea and said was he going to come out of Galilee wasn't he supposed to come of the seed of David the town of Bethlehem that was true they knew the scriptures they knew these things they just didn't know him and the Bible says so there was a ision among the people because of him now Satan is a spirit right know that when they say son of God Son of God is also Spirit Here Comes Satan now watch as I paint this picture for you in Luke the the the fourth chapter Sayan Sayan is is there he's the tempter and he comes to Jesus at this point he's not sure if he is the Son of God or not the scripture tells us that the devil said unto him if thou be the son of God now Satan's a spirit he needs a body to work through but watch here as he comes to Jesus now he sees a body of man that's what throws him off the logos becoming a man this is rough if thou be the Son of God after the God man defeats Satan he puts him in his place imagine the conversation that Jesus has with the demons he he gathers all his Devils together and he tells them I tried him I gave him my best shot he is the Christ after being defeated he had no doubts anymore there were no more ifs he is the Christ I thought I could trap him I thought I could Corner him I gave him my best offer he didn't budge he whipped me he whipped me with the word because I found out he is the word he is the Christ he is the son of God now now watch this the same chapter watch as as it goes a little bit further now in the same chapter verse 4 verse 40 I'm sorry chapter 4 verse 40 watch when he says and now when the sun was setting his demons are back on track right they're doing their job all they had all their sick divers diseases they brought them to him he laid hands on every one of them killed them now watch The Devils now their General their Master which previously had said if thou be the Son of God but now he's told them yeah yeah he is the so the devil's also Al came out of many crying out and saying Thou Art the Son of God okay okay now now now this is what is so tremendous because these devils are saying this without Revelation and the the kingdom of God is built upon Revelation and so Jesus he he's the word he's the word and he says I can I can hear him telling these Devils that's not for you to say it I don't need you to declare who I am you might as well shut your mouth now I I didn't say that to scripture scripture says that and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was Christ how did he know that he was Christ ah because they ran up into him and he smoked him say like it is took him that took him out watch this now why won't he let them talk when was one of the greatest truths that the world has ever known why does Jesus silence them because it was not for them to declare that it's the saints that shall crown him the Saints the bride is his glory she's the only one under a revelation can say thou art the Christ why because he is her Lord and the Bible says that no man can call Jesus Lord except by the Christ I'm going to say it again no man can call Jesus Lord except by the Holy Ghost which is Christ now this when I look at this and I see how how he came the L becomes flesh expression is it's the greatest expression and then would come another expression of the word when that word comes Jesus is the word and the word torment torments Devils now now I'm I'm coming to I'm finishing up okay but but just bear with me can I have like 10 minutes get this this is the essence of the message now the word torments the Devils I get so sick and tired in our lives to see how these Devils torment us that's right you're not called to be tormented by Devils church we have been called to torment Devils why is this backwards why is this all wrong in our lives because he doesn't have preeminence we give him preeminence the word then torments the devil I want this to seek in now very much when was the last time that we tormented devils in our Liv oh come on now we're tormented all the time our minds are tormented and what of this and what of that sick and am I going to die it's just torment after torment after torment until somebody finally realizes if I give God preeminence then we turn the tables and now we can torment him now now notice this now Matthew 8:28 When he came to the other side of this country there there he met two possessed with the devil they were exceeding Fierce that no man would want wanted to even pass by right but as Jesus approaches he's the word now say it again he's the word and you are the bride word come on now either we believe that or we don't and behold they cried out Jesus never cried out oh man look at that guy with the demon with those devils no they're the ones crying out church if we could get to that place they said what have we to do with with thee Jesus thou Son of God Art Thou come hither to torment us to torture us to Vex us before the time I don't know about you but I'm tired of torments we become a puppet and those Devils behind us are I'm tired of this life next thing you know here we go again the same thing why we keep preaching about it because it gets worse this has preeminence over us oh come on and we hear it in church say I'm going to do better anybody here when we're in church under the anointing I'm straightening up right and we're good until we get to our house open the door and we're a puppet controlled and we're back and live the same way again in our heart we long to be free from this we long to for him to have preeminence we don't want to pay the price stop I'm going to stop for a minute here I asked the question to some of the people and I said why is it that when in the Old Testament when when the sacrifices were being made and all the burnt different kinds of burnt offerings were done honey was never one of the ingredients anybody know that they never never used honey in any of the ingredients why oh I got a lot of good answers I think this I think this okay after a while why is honey not used in the burnt offs because honey can't because honey they can't stand up oh you you don't even know why what I'm saying why I it can't handle the heat when you take honey and you put it under the fire it turns into a black mushy mess it's the same with us we give we try to put into our offering our burnt offering we try to add honey all the time oh Lord Jesus you know I love you oh Lord I'll follow you till I die all we're doing is adding honey to it but with the trial of our faith when the when the when the trials and tribulations come when the heat comes when the fire burns what happens we fall away I thought God loved me I thought what are you talking about quit putting honey on your on your sacrifice you know what they used instead frankincense frankincense because the hotter frankincense gets the more beautiful the smell they all right now let's get back to our message here I'm I'm I'm I'm wrapping up now notice this now five minutes okay all right wa in did I go past 10 minutes already no no the clock stopped all right it stop all right good job good eye good eye all right notice this this is important because we get tired of being tormented but there's something in Colossians 1:23 and 27 that really my because everything that happens to us we simply always say oh yeah I'm being tormented well it's one thing to be tormented because of your own sake there's another thing that we're going to read about if you continue in the faith settled not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which ye have heard which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where of I Paul am made a Min who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up oh my here we go and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh he never considered his afflictions his own afflictions he never said look look what look I preached the gospel and look how Jesus look look how the Lord repays me it was in an honor for him to say my afflictions are the afflictions of Christ in my flesh that's why when we look at men that are back there brother Abraham brother fa we look at all the men around the different ones that that have gotten through the years you see they have been Afflicted in their bodies they they've been through so much Affliction after Affliction AFF have to go to to the specialist what's going on what is it it's the afflictions of Christ in their flesh why because we are the body of Christ the afflictions of Christ we see see them in our flesh or we are the flesh or Corporal body that he's using not that Corporal body this physical body these physical bodies are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and that's when we see that's when demons are tormented when we no longer see the afflictions as our afflictions but as Christ Affliction that torments the Devils how could they go on how could they keep serving the lord and they're Afflicted and Afflicted and Afflicted why because it is not their afflictions it is the afflictions of Christ in their body that's why he would say whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God in other words to fulfill the word of God is to perfect the logos did you get that to perfect the logos why it's scattered but the Perfection of the logos is when it comes back that's why brother brandham says that's my purpose to unite the body of Christ to unite that logos back Christ in you the hope of glory I'm going to I'm going to go to a stop here I got so much so much to put out and stop here how many of you are tired of being tormented tired of those Devils just playing I'm gonna ask if brother Diego would come and all the ministry if they would come here's a man that has yes he's a prayer Warrior and he has prayed and stood for for all of us for many of God's people in different places and the devil has come to afflict him that's not his Affliction that's right amen the Affliction Christ can I get all the ministry to come please we're not here to be tormented we're here this
