[37:16] Jesus name we pray
[37:18] amen amen
[37:20] let us turn into a scripture
[37:26] found in Luke 21 verse Uno
[37:34] the word of God reads this way
[37:37] and he looked up and saw the rich man
[37:40] casting their gifts into the treasury
[37:43] as he's a layer in mirando a Los
[37:47] ricoso friends
[37:51] Villagio and he saw also a certain poor
[37:54] Widow casting in thither to mites
[38:02] Blancas and he said of a truth I say
[38:05] unto you that this poor widow have cast
[38:08] in more than they are
[38:16] all these have of their abundance cast
[38:19] in in unto the offerings of God
[38:22] but she of her penury have cast in all
[38:25] the living that she had friends
[38:40] may God have his blessings to the
[38:42] reading of the word and you may be
[38:43] seated
[38:52] thank the Lord for for his mercy and his
[38:54] grace
[38:57] which surrounds us every day
[39:03] every time we come to church
[39:07] you know we come very rich yeah
[39:11] rich
[39:13] we become rich spiritually speaking
[39:18] and sometimes day after day
[39:22] maybe service after service
[39:26] we're so comfortable and communist
[39:29] service
[39:32] that maybe we slack off a little bit
[39:38] you know we become as these rich men
[39:43] these rich men that have a lot of goods
[39:47] a lot of money
[39:50] and you come into service sometimes
[39:55] like you walk in and you like you own
[39:57] The Joint investors
[40:02] but but you want again puffed up
[40:07] ready for service
[40:10] and and you you know you're gonna hear
[40:13] some good singing
[40:15] we might raise our hand a little bit
[40:20] we got a nice new suit
[40:23] God is good oh he's blessed me with some
[40:26] great clothes
[40:29] we're going to hear some good preaching
[40:33] maybe I'll worship a little bit
[40:37] and then you know I'm after church
[40:40] yeah we're gonna go get some lunch
[40:43] I might go and have a nice big steak
[40:47] and it's like that day after day you
[40:50] know
[40:51] yeah well what else are they going to
[40:53] say they're going to say the same thing
[40:54] they said you know
[41:02] but something caught me about this poor
[41:05] widow woman
[41:08] it's always when we don't have certain
[41:10] things
[41:16] that we kind of get a little closer to
[41:19] God
[41:24] where is your heart
[41:28] we sometimes are not like the poor widow
[41:30] woman
[41:33] and we can come and give something to
[41:35] the Lord
[41:38] but we don't have any feeling or meaning
[41:41] or value behind us
[41:45] our heart is far away from our gifts
[41:50] way far away
[41:52] and I speak to myself
[41:55] what haven't I given to the Lord
[41:59] is there more to give
[42:02] this widow woman is
[42:17] it was the smallest of the coins that
[42:20] she dropped into the offering bag
[42:25] and let me tell you how small it was
[42:31] Blancas were equivalent to a penny
[42:35] Penny what can he do with a penny
[42:40] I'm sorry brother Ron sorry
[42:42] what could you do with a penny
[42:49] what would you do with the penny
[42:51] what value does that mean to you
[42:56] it was the offering that she gave is
[42:59] the tithing was already paid
[43:02] and that was owed to God already
[43:06] but she wanted to give something more
[43:10] she had a burning desire in her heart
[43:18] that has felt the Lord pull on their
[43:21] hearts
[43:26] but I do all this for the church
[43:31] didn't you see me coming early
[43:35] I went upstairs to the audio department
[43:39] isn't it enough
[43:41] and then the pastor may ask
[43:45] hey I need you to do this is
[44:07] foreign not just half of what she had
[44:13] let me let me rephrase
[44:15] not just ten percent
[44:27] that's the one just half of you yeah
[44:32] the Lord himself is here
[44:35] he wants all of you
[44:38] he wants you to know
[44:41] it's okay to drop it is
[44:45] all that you have is
[44:48] because again Lord Jesus said
[44:51] he saw the rich
[44:54] and all the money that they dropped
[44:58] but that didn't move him
[45:01] he had a talent disciples
[45:06] to
[45:14] [Music]
[46:06] so to
[46:09] Viviana and what an amazing level of
[46:11] sacrifice
[46:13] it's known as our human cells yes
[46:18] we don't want to sacrifice
[46:23] we're fearful
[46:25] we don't want to give
[46:27] and when we do
[46:29] your heart's not in it
[46:33] sometimes when we prepare a gift
[46:37] we put no thought or value
[46:42] and don't realize who were you giving to
[46:44] you know
[46:46] it's because we're selfish
[46:50] we're selfish
[46:53] I'm selfish
[46:56] you can put your name there if you want
[46:59] we want to receive before we even before
[47:02] we give yeah
[47:04] and there's several reasons yeah you're
[47:07] selfish
[47:10] some people believe
[47:13] it's logical to put themselves first
[47:20] primero whenever possible to ensure
[47:22] their survival and thriving
[47:27] you have a fear of losing control
[47:31] you sometimes you don't even know you're
[47:34] selfish
[47:37] sometimes you fear abandonment
[47:41] sometimes you want to be manipulative
[47:44] manipulative
[47:50] manipulators
[47:51] you have the wrong mindset
[47:55] sometimes we're only conscious of my
[47:59] needs is
[48:05] sometimes we confuse
[48:18] we need an Awakening the Necessities
[48:23] so let's go vamos
[48:26] you confused your wants for your knee
[48:32] you learned this when you're young
[48:36] you got to know what you need
[48:41] what you can afford
[48:44] how do you prioritize in your life
[48:52] a need is something you must have is
[48:56] something you wish
[49:01] a need represents necessity
[49:06] represents your desire uh
[49:11] your need is essential to survival
[49:14] Necessities
[49:18] your want is
[49:23] essential your need is going to remain
[49:25] constant over time

[54:10] I'm gonna have to wrap my daughter out
[54:14] you have a thousand toys
[54:18] and your sister
[54:20] has another toy
[54:22] and you forget all your toys
[54:30] just for one thing that you didn't want
[54:31] in the first place
[54:35] how childish we are okay guess
[54:44] Satan wants to provide all your wants
[54:46] assistance
[54:49] he's after your need
[54:53] to be your need
[54:56] [Applause]
[54:57] he wants you to sacrifice
[55:01] what will he give for this huh okay
[55:05] you're a little addicted
[55:09] I love it let me show you something new
[55:14] but I want to be your needs but it's
[55:17] what he says
[55:19] but let me tell you what the Bible says
[55:23] let me tell you what it says
[55:27] in Philippians 4 19.
[55:30] but my God
[55:32] my God
[55:34] shall supply
[55:36] all your needs
[55:40] not your needs
[55:46] but that doesn't make sense
[55:49] I want somebody to provide all my needs
[55:55] well maybe physically
[55:57] you need water and food necesitas
[56:01] but spiritually
[56:06] it's the place that he designed
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:12] everything else tries to take it
[56:16] sometimes we try to fill it up with
[56:18] others
[56:20] it doesn't work
[56:24] this is hermano I have him
[56:27] achieve what I wanted to in life
[56:34] if I choose the Lord right now
[56:38] I won't be able to get that
[56:41] and I'm scared
[56:45] I'm super scared
[56:47] God Will Supply your need
[56:51] he will supply your need
[56:57] but you gotta know him as my provider
[57:02] you got addicted
[57:06] that is yours yes
[57:09] but this is mine these Earthly
[57:12] possessions are mines
[57:15] and that's our problem is you know that
[57:19] widow woman yeah it's a view that she
[57:21] must have known he was Jehovah
[57:24] she must have known that he was the god
[57:26] of Abraham Isaac and Jacob uh
[57:50] [Applause]
[57:56] and he wants your heart
[57:59] how is it that God's jealous
[58:03] isn't that weird
[58:05] I heard the brother preaching is
[58:09] to be a Christian Cristiano means to be
[58:13] like Jesus Jesus
[58:15] and Jesus they're they're jealous Jesus
[58:19] says celoso who's jealous here today
[58:23] we're jealous
[58:25] we covet uh
[58:28] we want other things
[58:31] not the Lord
[58:33] but your God is a jealous
[58:36] you know he's fiercely protective
[58:40] protectivo
[58:45] or Vigilant or vigilante of one's rights
[58:49] or possessions
[58:51] you're jealous of the things you don't
[58:53] have um
[58:55] and the Lord the Lord your God is
[58:59] jealous for you yes
[59:02] even before
[59:04] you even gave your heart to the Lord
[59:07] and maybe you still come to church
[59:11] service after service
[59:13] and you still haven't done it
[59:16] maybe you've given God only 20 percent
[59:20] uh
[59:24] but he's jealous
[59:27] he demands faithfulness is
[59:32] an exclusive worship
[59:35] thou shall have no other gods before me
[59:40] but we make this to God
[59:44] no I don't worship it
[59:48] not only wants your heart
[59:50] he wants your mind
[59:53] you probably heard this before
[59:55] he wants your strength
[59:57] he wants your time
[59:59] oh Lord I just went to I went to work
[1:00:04] I got 10 minutes for you Lord
[1:00:10] I'm so worn out Lord
[1:00:12] maybe if you were uh
[1:00:15] give me more money
[1:00:18] I don't have to work
[1:00:25] what a sickly attitude
[1:00:29] he's asking you to surrender all to him
[1:00:35] he's asking give your heart is
[1:00:44] why because he gave the very best for
[1:00:46] you
[1:00:50] I think the best gift that you can
[1:00:52] received
[1:00:56] is when someone gives you the itself
[1:01:00] when I was a kid
[1:01:02] we just want toys
[1:01:07] but when someone gives you
[1:01:10] their time
[1:01:14] you know what that is
[1:01:15] you know how our pastor is
[1:01:28] a sacrifice for them
[1:01:32] it's a sacrifice for their family
[1:01:36] and I know that because now I'm on both
[1:01:39] sides of the coin
[1:01:42] but I want to encourage you today
[1:01:46] give him your heart
[1:01:48] you hear it all the time
[1:01:51] you hear it all the times
[1:01:54] but if you heard anything today
[1:01:58] if you heard his voice
[1:02:05] just crack the door a little bit
[1:02:09] sometimes we're scared to open that door
[1:02:13] and Jesus is there knocking
[1:02:18] and he's knocking he wants to get in
[1:02:20] Estates and he's a gentleman yes but
[1:02:24] it's your job to unlock the door
[1:02:29] grab the knob and
[1:02:34] Dios
[1:03:04] as Brother Carlos comes forward
[1:03:09] you know the I've noticed
[1:03:12] the more you give to the Lord
[1:03:15] the more you're blessed
[1:03:19] and for me money's a bad Master
[1:03:24] my family knows that I am height
[1:03:30] but I've tried to do better
[1:03:33] because I see the need
[1:03:36] of all those that desire the Lord
[1:03:40] but the more you give him
[1:03:44] more you're blessed
[1:03:46] the little boy gave Five Loaves and two
[1:03:49] fish is
[1:04:10] Elijah's Widow gave him to eat first
[1:04:16] though it was hard
[1:04:18] and she was gonna die
[1:04:21] she had food
[1:04:26] he must gave him my old tattered
[1:04:28] garments
[1:04:30] my filthy rags
[1:04:33] say I don't have much today
[1:04:37] and that is good yes once again you
[1:04:40] don't need all those worldly possessions
[1:04:42] give them your garments
[1:05:00] that lives
[1:05:03] beautiful myself
[1:05:29] [Applause]
[1:05:49] don't be scared
[1:05:51] we're here with you
[1:05:54] open your heart foreign
[1:06:06] amen amen I I was all right just let him
[1:06:09] keep on going
[1:06:12] he was he was getting rolling there I
[1:06:15] was that's tremendous God bless Brothers
[1:06:18] amen amen so we're brother Seth was
[1:06:21] talking about opening your heart hermano
[1:06:24] says
[1:06:25] and and it just so happened that we're
[1:06:27] gonna we're gonna talk a little bit
[1:06:29] tonight about someone who who wanted to
[1:06:31] open their hearts
[1:06:35] so if you'll turn with me in your Bibles
[1:06:37] tonight
[1:06:39] we're gonna go to a book of John chapter
[1:06:41] three
[1:06:45] we'll start with with uh with verse
[1:06:47] three it's uh this is a well-known
[1:06:49] scripture
[1:06:50] is
[1:06:52] and when you have it you could just
[1:06:54] saying
[1:06:57] Tiempo
[1:07:01] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[1:07:04] verily I say unto thee
[1:07:06] except the man be born again he cannot
[1:07:09] see the kingdom of God respond Jesus
[1:07:22] how can a man be born when he is old can
[1:07:25] he enter the second time into his
[1:07:28] mother's womb and be born
[1:07:39] and I want you to notice
[1:07:42] that Jesus doesn't even really
[1:07:45] acknowledge nicodemus's question Jesus
[1:07:50] he doesn't stop his thought
[1:07:54] to address nicodemus's comments
[1:07:59] verse 5 says Jesus
[1:08:02] Jesus verily verily I say unto thee
[1:08:06] except a man be born of the water and of
[1:08:08] the spirit he cannot enter into the
[1:08:10] kingdom of God
[1:08:16] and there's where we wanna we wanna
[1:08:18] start there
[1:08:20] and and and we notice here Aquino tamus
[1:08:25] and then the Lord forgive me for not
[1:08:27] having you stand to read the words
[1:08:33] and may the Lord add His blessings to
[1:08:35] the reading of that word
[1:08:39] but notice
[1:08:42] how
[1:08:50] much
[1:08:51] because he didn't want people to see him
[1:08:54] come talk to Jesus
[1:08:58] but that's not even the important part
[1:09:03] we know that that Nicodemus he he really
[1:09:06] couldn't grasp what it was that Jesus
[1:09:08] was talking about
[1:09:12] Jesus but but the first thing that that
[1:09:15] we tend to do when we read this
[1:09:17] scripture
[1:09:18] is
[1:09:20] is we assume that Nicodemus
[1:09:25] maybe ask the silly questions
[1:09:30] any anybody who knows a little bit about
[1:09:32] biology
[1:09:36] knows you can't enter the second time
[1:09:38] into your mother's womb
[1:09:41] is
[1:09:45] we we take that that statement is
[1:09:50] and we take the question
[1:09:52] and we put it to the side
[1:10:00] it was so so lost
[1:10:08] but I want you to know something
[1:10:11] I want to ask a question
[1:10:16] is it possible it's possibly
[1:10:21] is it possible it's possible
[1:10:25] to enter again
[1:10:29] into my mother's womb Madre
[1:10:34] because what if I told you
[1:10:38] that it's not only possible
[1:10:43] but it is an absolute necessity is
[1:10:52] so then the question becomes
[1:10:56] well brother what is it what in the
[1:10:58] world are you talking about because
[1:11:02] he said you can't do it
[1:11:05] we've accepted the fact that in that
[1:11:08] physically it can't be done
[1:11:13] but then I'm going to answer the
[1:11:15] question like the chief used to
[1:11:17] respwest
[1:11:20] he used to answer a question
[1:11:25] with another question
[1:11:27] so you go and you go get advice
[1:11:33] and you said Chief what do I do it is
[1:11:37] and the first thing he would say is
[1:11:42] let me ask you a question
[1:11:45] so I'm going to ask you a question
[1:11:51] the question then becomes
[1:11:55] then who is my mother
[1:11:57] says
[1:11:59] that becomes the question of the day to
[1:12:02] ask
[1:12:06] because if it's a necessity to enter
[1:12:09] once again
[1:12:12] and
[1:12:15] physically I can't enter back into my
[1:12:17] mother's name is
[1:12:27] so we find here
[1:12:30] and we find we find Jesus in The Book of
[1:12:33] Matthew
[1:12:34] Jesus
[1:12:37] verse 46
[1:12:40] and and this here if you read this
[1:12:43] chapter uh
[1:12:50] he's Jesus he's he's laying down the law
[1:12:53] here Jesus
[1:12:55] he's got a multitude of people in front
[1:12:57] of him
[1:13:00] and and he's he's really he's really
[1:13:04] hammering him
[1:13:06] and and the people
[1:13:09] they're getting restless
[1:13:12] and then they they kind of can't take it
[1:13:15] anymore
[1:13:17] but they noticed Mary and some of the
[1:13:20] brothers coming up to where Jesus
[1:13:27] and because they can't handle what Jesus
[1:13:30] is putting out
[1:13:33] Jesus the scripture tells us
[1:13:38] while he yet talk to the people
[1:13:43] it says his mother
[1:13:46] and his brothers he stood without
[1:13:49] Desiring to speak to him
[1:13:53] then one in the middle of his sermon
[1:13:59] once said unto him
[1:14:04] and thy brother and standing without
[1:14:08] and Desiring to speak with
[1:14:11] but watch the way Jesus responds
[1:14:17] when they tell him Behold thy mother
[1:14:20] Wonder
[1:14:23] Jesus catches that Jesus
[1:14:26] because if he would have acknowledged it
[1:14:29] a certain way
[1:15:20] he said behold now
[1:15:24] Madre
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:15:49] so we return back to the original
[1:15:51] question
[1:15:54] if it's necessary to enter again CS
[1:15:58] neces
[1:16:08] because now we've changed
[1:16:12] now we're looking at the scene from a
[1:16:14] different angles
[1:16:18] we can no longer look at it from a
[1:16:21] carnal standpoint
[1:16:24] we can no longer look at it from that
[1:16:29] Persona that says I want my wants filled
[1:16:35] we've got to change our position
[1:16:39] and we begin to understand
[1:16:43] who are they that do the will of my
[1:16:45] father Yes Padre
[1:16:51] what is the will of my father
[1:16:55] because unless I can answer these
[1:16:57] questions
[1:17:00] I'll never understand who is my mother
[1:17:05] and we understand
[1:17:07] what is the will of the father Yes
[1:17:11] just sum it up simply
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:15] this is the will of the father
[1:17:18] that's his will estos
[1:17:25] because his word
[1:17:27] wants you to as well
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:32] Madre
[1:17:41] so we find
[1:17:43] now we have the will
[1:17:47] now we understand what is the will and
[1:17:52] so my mother entonces me Madre is
[1:17:57] that do the will of God
[1:18:00] but are we still physical
[1:18:05] are we still stuck in carnality
[1:18:10] are we still looking around at one
[1:18:13] another thing who we could see
[1:18:17] or have our eyes been opened oh no
[1:18:20] straws
[1:18:21] as our spiritual eye
[1:18:25] and see that was placed before the
[1:18:28] foundations
[1:18:38] because
[1:18:40] it looks at things differently
[1:18:45] and it begins to ask the question
[1:18:51] is
[1:18:53] who is this
[1:18:57] because the one thing that Jesus said we
[1:19:00] must do
[1:19:04] Jesus
[1:19:06] is to be born again
[1:19:09] there's no way around it
[1:19:13] there's no shortcuts
[1:19:16] there's no easy way
[1:19:21] you've got to enter back in
[1:19:24] regression only this time
[1:19:28] you enter into the mother
[1:19:31] which is the word of almighty God is
[1:19:45] and it's there is
[1:20:36] so that we can enter in once again
[1:20:46] G must be born again
[1:20:50] Nicodemus wasn't as crazy as we all
[1:20:53] thoughts
[1:20:55] he wasn't as silly as we all thought
[1:21:00] but Nicodemus just had one problem
[1:21:06] we see the carnal Partners
[1:21:10] so if you notice
[1:21:13] back in the scripture
[1:21:18] and this blew me away
[1:21:21] because this is the the new birth
[1:21:26] it's the very Crux of what we believe
[1:21:34] John chapter 3 San Juan and you look at
[1:21:39] verse seven you step back
[1:21:42] that statement blows me away
[1:21:47] here's Jesus Jesus giving him the one
[1:21:52] Commandments
[1:21:55] did you and I must kill
[1:22:00] Nicodemus couldn't capture it
[1:22:04] and Jesus turns to Nicodemus
[1:22:09] and he says but Nicodemus it is
[1:22:16] you must say it again
[1:22:21] I'm on you gotta go with me
[1:22:26] come on you gotta go to this scene
[1:22:30] you gotta be there when he tells them
[1:22:33] yeah
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:22:37] this is the Crux of
[1:22:42] malachios again
[1:22:46] Nuevo
[1:22:49] but Jesus turns to him Peru Jesus
[1:22:53] answers
[1:22:57] that I said unto thee here
[1:23:01] that you must be born again
[1:23:04] it's all right
[1:23:07] don't don't hurt yourself no no no don't
[1:23:11] Marvel too much
[1:23:44] so that when you start to that Journey
[1:23:49] when you young people start to wander
[1:23:52] condos
[1:23:54] how do I receive the new birth
[1:23:59] you begin to enter it
[1:24:02] is
[1:24:09] but it's not just here
[1:24:15] it's there
[1:24:19] it's there
[1:24:22] who is your mother
[1:24:24] it's here
[1:24:27] foreign
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:25:05] thank you gracias
[1:25:07] [Applause]
[1:25:16] my
[1:25:17] mobile forgive me
[1:25:21] asure in the bad Splash Zone spot there
[1:25:23] is
[1:25:35] not all that saith Lord Lord
[1:25:40] do the will of the father
[1:25:45] that's what Jesus told them
[1:25:47] Jesus that Marvel not that the demons
[1:25:51] but you can cast them out
[1:25:55] there's a lot of people that say Lord
[1:25:56] Lord
[1:26:01] says it becometh us
[1:26:05] to know where we stand in the word
[1:26:09] it becomes
[1:26:13] to study the mother
[1:26:15] if you come with us
[1:26:24] so that we know
[1:26:26] so we're doing the will of God
[1:26:33] I want to read this quote real quick
[1:26:40] now I take brother Ronnie for this by
[1:26:42] the way
[1:26:43] brother Brandon yesterday a message
[1:26:46] question and answers
[1:26:51] science has taken man forward
[1:26:58] more forward Mas Adelante
[1:27:01] greater things with this mind Mas Grande
[1:27:05] then what
[1:27:08] and that's the only thing that he has
[1:27:12] yes
[1:27:13] is the tree of knowledge is
[1:27:17] but this last part
[1:27:20] this last part heard to the core is
[1:27:30] farther
[1:27:33] then the ministers has taken them
[1:27:40] taking him to quit
[1:27:43] with his Spirit
[1:27:45] which is unlimited
[1:27:51] and so I was we were talking with
[1:27:53] brother Ronnie in the back is
[1:27:56] and the only question I could ask was
[1:27:58] why is
[1:28:03] that the case
[1:28:07] why has science taken us further
[1:28:13] then the ministry
[1:28:16] when they're dealing with a limited
[1:28:19] knowledge
[1:28:20] is
[1:28:25] and the word of God is unlimited
[1:28:30] and then I thought and I've been I
[1:28:33] pondered and I prayed Lopez
[1:28:42] and the Lord said yes
[1:28:46] because science
[1:28:49] gives them the thing that they want
[1:28:56] not what they need
[1:29:02] science gives us technology
[1:29:06] and as long as there's a distraction
[1:29:09] brother calebra you know destruction
[1:29:12] brother Bradham says a minister could
[1:29:15] preach until he was blue in the face
[1:29:16] they said hermano Brown
[1:29:21] what if the distractions are great
[1:29:26] then what we're actually looking for is
[1:29:47] then we'll go further with science
[1:30:02] but that don't line up
[1:30:06] because that's not the way it's supposed
[1:30:08] to be okay
[1:30:10] book of Jeremiah chapter one verse
[1:30:21] foreign
[1:30:27] Bible says then the word of the Lord
[1:30:29] came unto me saying
[1:30:33] notice how the Lord speaks to Jeremiah
[1:30:43] before antis
[1:30:46] I formed
[1:30:48] I must say that again
[1:30:51] before antis I formed
[1:30:56] in the valley
[1:30:58] I knew thee
[1:31:02] um
[1:31:04] he said before and testicle you and I
[1:31:08] were even formed
[1:31:12] before he sat to the businesses
[1:31:17] of creating you and I The Creator he
[1:31:21] knew us
[1:31:23] we were in his thoughts
[1:31:26] we were in his mind
[1:31:29] and we find out
[1:31:32] that when we come we find let me get
[1:31:36] here in contramos that predestination
[1:31:41] looks back to election
[1:31:44] election
[1:31:47] looks to foreign
[1:32:04] travel
[1:32:19] [Applause]
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:24] and he speaks to Jeremiah
[1:32:28] and he said before they say antis when I
[1:32:32] knew you Jeremiah
[1:32:34] he said I Sanctified you the scientific
[1:32:37] I already prepared you
[1:32:40] I already gave you all that you were
[1:32:43] gonna need
[1:32:46] I already provided the sacrifice
[1:32:52] I already wrote your name on The Book of
[1:32:55] Life
[1:33:03] you were even formed
[1:33:07] I knew you they're gonna see
[1:33:16] and we reach a point
[1:33:19] find out in Galatians 1 15 okay
[1:33:28] but when it pleased God
[1:33:34] because he already
[1:33:39] knew yeah
[1:33:42] but when it pleased
[1:33:47] who separated me from my camera
[1:33:52] the second time
[1:33:57] we sit under tutors
[1:34:00] what are we waiting for que estamos
[1:34:04] esperando that adoption of saints is
[1:34:09] we're waiting there is
[1:34:12] but he knew Peru he knew how long it was
[1:34:16] going to take me
[1:34:19] he knew how long I had to be in the womb
[1:34:22] is
[1:34:25] and when he separated me
[1:34:28] brother Henry thank you hermano Henry
[1:34:30] muchas gracias because when he separated
[1:34:33] me porque cuando there was a death
[1:34:37] and that death takes place
[1:34:41] and when the separation happens
[1:34:54] a new creation
[1:34:58] Jesus and that's what he knew yesterday
[1:35:04] when he saw Jeremiah
[1:35:07] before he formed him and tested he saw
[1:35:12] him the moment and love your animal that
[1:35:15] the separation happened
[1:35:19] because that's when Jeremiah became
[1:35:25] the living soul
[1:35:31] before that he was a dead soul muerta
[1:35:37] no life
[1:35:43] but when the separation comes
[1:35:47] the life enters
[1:35:51] then we have access
[1:35:54] that's when we begin to have that access
[1:36:00] to all of the promises that God gave us
[1:36:05] to the rest
[1:36:09] foreign
[1:36:20] but it all begins
[1:36:23] with the question
[1:36:26] who is
[1:36:30] the musicians
[1:36:40] I'm gonna end with this it's a little
[1:36:42] story
[1:36:48] the guys who put the picture up on the
[1:36:50] screen
[1:36:51] I I see
[1:36:54] Los Hombres
[1:36:59] and this picture
[1:37:00] is
[1:37:04] this picture is
[1:37:05] hanging in a famous Museum in Paris
[1:37:11] Paris
[1:37:12] and this picture is
[1:37:17] it's of a man playing the devil for his
[1:37:19] soul is
[1:37:24] playing chess with the devil for
[1:37:26] instance
[1:37:29] and he's losing pretty bad
[1:37:35] the name of this picture is called
[1:37:36] Checkmate
[1:37:40] say Yama
[1:37:43] El mate
[1:37:45] but
[1:37:47] one day there was a man
[1:37:49] who was walking through the museum
[1:37:52] seeing the art it was
[1:37:56] a way you can play something if you
[1:37:58] would
[1:38:01] and he's walking through the museum and
[1:38:02] he stops at this picture
[1:38:07] and he stays there staring at it for
[1:38:09] hours
[1:38:13] and he's staring at it so much
[1:38:17] that it begins to attract all the museum
[1:38:20] curators
[1:38:27] and they said sir are you okay
[1:38:32] and he said what do they call that
[1:38:34] picture it is
[1:38:39] he said they call that picture checkmate
[1:38:42] you see because the devil has
[1:38:45] as him in a position where he can't go
[1:38:47] nowhere
[1:38:55] the man said hello
