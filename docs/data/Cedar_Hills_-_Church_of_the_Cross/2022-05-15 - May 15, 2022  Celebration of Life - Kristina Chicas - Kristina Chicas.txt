always on amen god bless you this morning grateful to each and every one of you that has made the effort to be here this morning those that are online uh sister christina's family that are in line in i believe new york may the lord bless them also at this time and those that will see this at a later junction her family her friends may the lord jesus comfort you i'm going to ask us to stand and we're going to read a portion of scripture for a few moments this this morning the bible tells us in the book of saint james go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas ye know not what shall be on the moral or what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanishes away for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that but now you rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil therefore be him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin let us approach the author and ask him to give us our our daily portion as we draw night to him he is as we heard yesterday he is our king the immortal invisible the only wise god thank you father this morning for the opportunity to be able to draw nigh into your presence into this congregation of people that have been purchased by your blood and father we ask father that you will comfort those that need comforting right now that you will bless those that need you this morning may those that are online as they hear these words may your holy spirit descend to them and give them what they need at this moment father we are your children you are our father we don't know what to do unless you inspire the words to become life to us father off out of the pages of your holy word we do garner what we need we do receive the inspiration the revelation and the word that is supposed to supply the our needs today and father every time we look into these sacred pages we always find you there for you uh this is you written in scripture form we ask father that you will bless everyone now once again in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ you may be seated i won't take much of your time this morning but i i do want to take a little bit of it to uh to uh give our condolences to the family of sister christina especially to her children to andreas to alexis to adriana to jacoby 35 years is way too early but we do trust in a resurrection reason that we separate christianity from the rest of the world's religions is that we do point to an empty tomb an empty grave and as he spoke to us these words he spoke to us because i live you live also and receiving the strength that we need for our life and in our journey i've i look towards the pages of the scripture i been fortunate in one way shape or another to be able to direct myself to different grieving families to be able to tell them what life is all about you cannot go and know about life unless you know a little bit of what death is death is a separation death is something that each and every one of us in here one day will meet one day when it is our turn will will be lane where sister christina is at and someone will be saying some words over us we know that that is the destiny of each and every one of us as soon as we are born we actually start dying from that day on i i see my aunt cecil and my aunt and my cousin michelle president gene as in kim family brother jorge and all the aunts and the uncles that are here representing today they are our foundation of what our church was built upon in understanding the scripture and understanding the life that we have then lived in i look at the basis of where our eternal destination lays and it lays within the pages of what we know as the holy bible there are around 800 000 words in that king james bible and our life hangs upon some of these words look in our life our life is is a paradox our life is supposed to be at times happy and we laugh but the majority of times that we laugh and are happy it's like a child that is whistling through the cemetery we don't know what life will be we don't know what tomorrow holds but we do according to the scripture no who holds tomorrow and because of that we get our strength in times like this this is the time that shows the character of the person in need this is the time whether we believe or we don't believe this church as i am so proud to be called a member and associate pastor of this church very proud is only four walls and these walls have never saved anybody and never will save anybody but this is a gathering of people that have come here for one purpose and one purpose only and that is to further themselves to find life and as we we look every day of our life should be a search of how much more can i do god's will what does god have me to do today where am i going where did i come from what am i doing here and unless we have the answer to those questions we go in what is called a death walk and the death walk is there is we are just going around in circles and in circles trying to find the end and trying to find the beginning but jesus christ spoke these words to us he says that the thief cometh to steal to kill and to destroy but he said i have come that you might have life and that more abundantly we look at our opening scripture and it says worry where whereas ye know not what we shall be on the morrow what for i did a funeral last november of a little girl that was that died in the birth canal many times people say i'm going to be this and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that and i had the opportunity last few months ago to do the funeral of a of a girl 23 years old that was disabled handicapped never spoke a word in her whole life we have great plans in our lives of what we shall do and we live like if we're going to live for a thousand years and we act like if there is no tomorrow and no justice and no judgment but the paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers wider freeways but we have less we buy more but we enjoy less we have bigger houses and smaller families more convenience but less time we have more degrees but less sense more judgment more knowledge but less judgment more experts yet more problems more medicine but less wellness we drink too much we smoke too much we spend to recklessly laugh too little we drive fast we get too angry we stay up too late we get up too tired we read too little and we watch too much tv and because of that all of those we pray very seldom used to be that americans would take a bath once a week and pray every day now we take a shower every day and we pray if we're lucky once a week and we wonder why our life has no favor has no feeling and it is because of the work we do into our life they asked me asked us the question as we have been raising and we have as he has been born and been such a blessing to us my boy abraham was born with some difficulties they asked what do you think about him i said he's our salt and pepper he's what adds savor to our life but what is jesus christ mean to you is jesus christ just a man hanging up on a cross to you is jesus christ just a picture that you see every once in a while or is jesus christ the person that you fell in love with a long time ago because he has redeemed you from this body of sin and death if it's a relationship that is something that you have to add savor to when you pray in the morning and you raise up your hands and you sing to the lord you're adding savor to the relationship of life we have multiplied our possessions but reduced our values we talk too much love to sell them and hate too often we've learned how to make a living but not a life we've added years to life but not life to years we've been all the way to the moon and back but have trouble crossing the street and saying hello to our next door neighbor we've conquered outer space we have not even dented to find out what lives inside of our inner space we've cleaned up the air but we have polluted the soul we've conquered the atom but not our prejudices we write more but learn less we plan more but we accomplish less we've learned how to rush but not to wait we build more computers to hold more information to produce more copies than ever but we communicate less and less these are the times of fast food how many love fast food we like everyone here loves fast food slow digestion these are the times of big man and small character steep prophets and shallow relationships these are the days of two income incomes but more divorces fancier houses but broken homes these are the days of quick trips disposable everything throwing away paper plates cups whatever needs to be done and it's also a throwaway of our morality one night stands overweight bodies and pills that do everything from cheer to quiet to kill it is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stock room why do i say all of that and it sounds so gloomy it is a gloomy world out there politically religiously in everything that you can imagine and without god in this world this world is chaos and on its way to hell but the word of god tells us oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever i don't know how many christians and how many people love god even if you're not from this church how many can say that god is good the reason that we are here today even if it's a just a funeral service is we know that god is good oh give thanks unto god unto the god of gods for his mercy endureth forever oh give thanks to the lord of lords for his mercy endureth forever and we can go on and on and on you were able to come here this morning because his mercy endureth forever as bleak as it looks like guys as bleak as it looks like as believe as it looks like me there will come a day but there will be no sorrow i don't think you believe me there is coming a day when no heartache shall come no more clouds in the sky no more tears to dim the eye it is called a resurrection morning that's what the bible calls us that is when we change from this tent to a building amen in a tent it's temporary all the sorrows and everything we go through is all temporary there is something that lives when the soul of the human being and that is god and only god can wipe our tears away and only god can satisfy our heart i look at four beautiful children they're blessed to have a grandmama and a great grandma an aunt and uncle and a great father figure and great people in the church that care about them what will happen to them what will happen to them is all what already happened to them god has already bought them god has already possessed them they belong to almighty god our lives belong to him you know why because his mercy my judgment might be one thing your judgment upon her life might be one thing our judgment upon her life might be one thing but let me tell you what god says praise the lord because his mercy endureth forever if we go upon the creeds of life all of us are doomed to death and are doomed to hell if we lie we do the same thing as the drunkard if we don't do what god wants us to do our responsibility we're all damned but his mercy thankful to god that no one of us here is god almighty because he judges as you heard our pastor say on a higher level it wasn't for the way he judges us and the way he looks at us we would not have a purpose and would not have a chance but because his mercy his mercy endureth forever we can sing and say to sister christina not goodbye sister christina but until the morning and because he lives we have a mark raise up your hands in victory that how god does things we don't know we do know who hold our hand god bless you [Applause] you unravel me [Music] is [Music] i am a child of [Music] god i am a child [Music] you have chosen me i've been born again [Music] i'm no longer [Music] [Music] i am a child of god [Music] [Music] if i had only known the last time would be the last time i would have put off all the things i had to do i would have stayed a little longer held on a little tighter now what i'd give for one more day with you [Music] cause there's a wound here in my heart where something's missing and they tell me that it's gonna heal with time [Music] but i know you're in a place where all your wounds have been erased and knowing yours are healed is healing by the only scars in it heaven belong to me and you there'll be no such thing as broken and all the old will be made new and the thought that makes me smile now [Music] even as the tears fall down is that the only scars in heaven or on the hands that hold you now i know the road you walked was anything but easy you picked up your share of scars along the way but now you're standing in the the only it won't scars to me and you there'll be no such thing as broken and all the old will be made new and the thought that makes me smile either [Music] for the hands that hold you now there's not a day goes by that i don't see you uh hey man would you stand to your feet sing the song with me sheltered in the arms of god so who let the storms reach high the dark thou tries for they don't worry me four arms shall turn within the arms of god [Music] he walks with me and none of earth and heartbeat [Music] forever [Music] i feel the touch of hands so kind [Music] what [Music] childhood in the arms [Music] dry [Music] foreign [Music] oh he walks with him [Music] the [Music] shall hear [Music] a call from [Music] foreign [Music] he of god lord gracious heavenly father lord come before you once again father we're asking you father to come and comfort the family again father come for her mother come for the precious children father the brothers the sisters the whole family father and friends father but like we heard father this is not a goodbye father but
