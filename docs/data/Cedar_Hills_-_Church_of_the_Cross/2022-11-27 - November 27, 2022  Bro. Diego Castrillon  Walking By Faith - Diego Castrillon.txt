good morning may God bless each and every one of you is comfortable take your seats this morning for for how many is here men [Music] each time you open your eyes take a breath it's a victory the Apostle Paul said these words because we even have resisted to death is very good this morning want to greet each one of you uh Brothers give me the opportunity to be here direct myself to this precious audience also want to give thanks to our lord Jesus thank you I do it with all fear and trembling before the most precious thing of God how many believe it Brothers you know what the word value is I've heard Christians I'm not worth anything sometimes we felt that is something caught my attention how much is this bottle of water worth if you're not thirsty maybe it's not worth anything to you pero but if you're thirsty that is maybe it's worth 50 cents what's worth in the store it's the same bottle but I'm gonna pay a dollar okay there's more more value to it if I buy it in like in a stadium bottle here it goes to space with the astronauts how much is it worth it it's invaluable it has no price it has in another foreign unto me and not only did he take me out but he placed me Heavenly places and he gave me promise all those promises when I could live with confidence now do you know how much you're worth the soul that you have that's why I'm so happy to be a Christian you're lost you're going to know this morning you're gonna you're gonna leave with enough strength challenge whatever demon from hell and tell him to his face that makes me feel better we can open up our scriptures and Matteo capitulo foreign Matthew 14. and we'll start with verse 23. the scriptures and when he had sent a multitude away he went up into a mountain apart to pray Jesus who's speaking about Jesus and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves where the wind was contrary and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea turbaron they were trouble and they cried over for fear Jesus Jesus speaking to them saying be of good cheer in his eyes be not afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord help me come bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come on Jesus and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and began to sink and he cried saying Lord Save Me Jesus and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him watch these words Lord good morning because this morning we can fight you can open up this bread to us spirit that opens up the understanding of these words [Music] invite everybody tell them today I have good news today I have very good news Jesus Christ is not dead he resurrected that's our hope yes and that is our faith you know foreign always do it okay I want you to be spiritually speaking that you allow me to take you by the hand and let us walk together foreign there has to be an answer foreign seem fair without faith is impossible it is impossible to please that's something you have to always why do we have to have faith without faith as impossible it's impossible to please these words you will never obtain nothing of God if it's not through faith then what is faith iones faith is not they're not it's not an emotion sometimes we think that if we shout God is going to answer us and we cry Lord [Music] answer us and after half an hour after maybe 10 minutes we don't even have a voice anymore and we're tired When the Children want something from their parents after [Music] [Applause] we take Faith foreign what is faith confession faith is a confession faith is a confession brother Diego I believe in God man I believe you but if that confession not what you believe in your heart that's not faith is when you speak something and it's not according to what's in your heart it's like you're acting like a hypocrite I'm not saying you are a hypocrite when you say something yes like a hypocrite foreign Romanos Diaz persiculo Nueve Romans 10 9. follow me Romans 10 9. what does it say yes shall confess with our mouth the Lord Jesus the confession of your mouth brother I believe but in your heart you cannot write in your heart you are acting come on like a hypocrite no sometimes Brothers I think sometimes I have acted as a hypocrite many years back I remembered yo yo me being a Christian I read disco here but I don't feel anything I'm acting like a hypocrite all right I want to know him if the Bible is the truth and this message is obligated to his wife and since then I can tell you God answers my prayers [Music] to be able to enter into his presence your faith has a confession foreign the commission that came to brother Branham an Affliction is a message from afflictions and infirmities he said the angel told me if you're sincere is you can find out where you're being held back are you sincere are you sincere are you here being sincere with God when you speak with your brother are you sincere you speak with a pastor are you sincere when you pray to God the word sincere signifies are you an Estonia oh there's a story years back Los griegos the the greeksios they were very well known for their culture and their statues and very valuable things many times when the when the sellers would get gather these statues and it would take to sell them they wouldn't mishandle them they would chip like parts of it he would get uh like some cement or what with wax he would guess what she is and the statute looked like it was brand new they put wax on it and the buyer would come you would look at the Statue and it's he would say it's perfect and he would purchase it but when the sun hit the statue all the imperfections started to come out that's where the word there was people and when they were going bye they would tell the sellers I want a statue I want a statue without wax I want it to be perfect if he has made me perfect why do I want to go back on to that condition which condition brother Diego yes 5 10 15 years we still speak about the brothers we still have to talk about these things now this brother he's throwing at me over here you're never going to grow as a Christian personal because you're taking it personally a way that's incorrect so the Bible says by the stripes but if in the church if we hear that someone says something why do we take it personal you have to be very sincere it's not a game the bride is here the predestinated ones now there's a work it has to be done at the same time he needs to know that there is a bride that's perfect faith is required it's a confession another brother in the church why are you not mature enough why don't you just just deal with it just suffering deal with it yeah I know that there's many times that people speak because God shows it to me all right now I I deal with it and I put it to the side and I pray for them because they're my brothers but when they get a hold of it like my sons and daughters of God yes just like I have protected them those are my prayers we have to take these things out I'm gonna turn the corner here I'll go through a turn into a corner here did you know that Faith Runs Out you know the faith Runs Out said until your faith holds up we will always want to blame someone else pero your faith Runs Out foreign that's why you were here this morning there's a scripture when Jesus that is important foreign let your confession no fire not fail you is not a feeling or an emotion glorious was good and marvelous the other day it snowed a little bit we call the deacons real cold oh it's because you know brother many excuses what does your feelings have to do with it what does it have to do with faith something different faith is a decision I have 25 years being a Christian and there's been some hard trials very hard but to go back to the world never been an option for me though I have dealt with it it has hurt me I've never put these things above my face or before it yeah because of our feelings and emotions our emotions are so weakness you know thank you for your attention our emotions are so fragile yes I don't like those okay anything hurts us it's our emotions and that's okay we are human beings yes coming to church because I'm happy that's my face that God is truth hear me Peter I have prayed that your face not failure that's why mother father pray for your children pray for them in the world that's not the end of the story I have the power to rewrite as a Historia we write that sorry my family that's true faith is we have the honor to pray for many many people before praying for them I speak to them a little bit about faith so they can learn a little bit more be able to face the challenge of the day could you come and place your hands upon me Hermano is brother that's not Faith okay that's right Jose even though I know that it's in the Bible and I believe it foreign a little bit more into this I don't hear anything no man can heal Jose is I know sometimes there's people that are very sick and it's not nothing wrong with us going it's part of the work the special cases where we have to go don't take it to the other extreme to capture my spirit trying to help you elevate in your faith it's been many times that has always been here always has answered me he's never had to go to the hospital to go and pray because I call him and I tell him difference you also if you see him God always answers the prayers I'm going to enter a little bit more brother Brandon said the answer Russian wasn't with a prayer that I made the Aston brother Branham God healed my daughter because of your prayer I know Randy said no brother says no no it wasn't my prayer it was your faith do you capture that yo it's what you believed not what I prayed it's what you believe when I call my pastor that's what I believe let me tell you brother my wife they had to operate her yeah it was urgent it was it was definite okay I believe God used to doctors yeah he used to prayer he's the Lord the the session I have to go to surgery the word was spoken and I said the way you say brother it was my faith the word of God went out and I believed it in the morning we went again to the hospital the doctor was going to admit her foreign how many fast the most tremendous I did who's next I begin to pray you gave it to me go go get another opinion the holy spirit says I already had the victory because I heard his voice when my wife went I got the best doctor I paid whatever it was because he looked at the the diagnostic operation she doesn't need surgery how much does God honor faith foreign because God knows he knows all things it's your faith now if you still necessity you still need help with your faith we'll be glad go to your homes and pray for you I say with all my heart we're glad to go and place your hands on you we're going to help you so that we can all grow in the faith it's not what the people pray it's what you believe the gifts they don't heal anyone a vision it doesn't heal anyone but the vision of his face you understand it that's the order the has already done it oh yeah I'm gonna enter in here Peter scripture saying hello is let me show you Castle let me show you a special case or a real case we have all heard how Peter was was sinking Jesus comes to help him why did you doubt hombre of little faith with all my heart is I always kind of would avoid talking about that because I could not understand how Peter could have such little faith those are the words of Jesus Peter why did you die oh you have little faith how could Peter have a little faith when the scriptures say when they when they were in the boat the waves would hit it in the middle of the Waves an image it appears and the people get they get scared because when we see the supernatural Sometimes some they get scared maybe others are more attentive [Music] then Peter let me say senor he says Lord a school chairman here hear this brother Pedro Peter Jesus it didn't know if that was Jesus and Peter was no damage it was intelligent he didn't know the Bible says when he recognizes the voice and Peter says oh Lord see yes if it is you Manda bid me to come pick the word for Jesus would speak English in the campaign things would happen when Jesus would say oh recover your sights those paralyzed those the Dead Come resurrect here that's what Peter said Lord if it's you let me send the words it's what you believe it's your face do you believe that you can come he puts his foot on the water foreign but it was it was a time but at one moment Peter he says that one time Peter looking at the waves come on isanto the Holy Spirit told me this that's why I hadn't preached it while I was working he brought me to these words and he told me when the scripture says little faith the Holy Spirit told me it doesn't say the Poquito he didn't say small in quantity you know Parker but little porque Noel because it didn't reach to finish come and fall it started to finish but it was Peter's face oh Peter of little faith your faith did not sustain this you understand that's your face that fail you oh yeah muchos Christians are precious people they're sinking is stuck yes you know why they're sinking because they're like Peter looking at the waves brothers because I have 10 years when the brother told me this is five years and I'm still sinking is that person treated me back they should not have done that is our emotions that [Music] that you can walk by faith if I ask you five more minutes how many walk by faith because my faith was not sufficient we walk by faith until the boss he he tells us something at work oh yeah I'm not gonna go to church you walk by faith we walk by faith until the husband does something wrong I'm not going back walk by faith causes person in Western things happen in our lives or do you think that Jesus if they have done many things but Jesus comes that could take his Focus away from his mission he was the Lamb of God there was no storm that could drown him Jesus is coming here that's because he was gone the Bible says he's my older brother and I look at Peter porque Pedro and because Peter as a disciple he knew that if his Lord could do it he had the right to do it also are you understanding me that was back then let me tell you the same Jesus the Same Works he says because I will no longer be here in spirit nothing that can hurt you and greater workshops because I shall be there with you there's no virtue in us but I have given my heart to someone that walked upon the storm okay I didn't get a chance to reach where I wanted to you I believe that it has been sufficient you shake a few things and to refine other things so you and I could grow the Bible says to the stature we have been called to have perfect faith it's what you believe in the Bible says the Bible even says what you ask is the Bible says yes he says whatever he asks whatever I asked no it's not what the Lord gives look what you asked how do you understand what faith is if you could see because this is if you feel if you're sinking maybe you like Peter maybe your faith hasn't been sufficient look brother I finished with this is if he feels inspired don't lose the spirit and to look Lucas thank you Luke 22 32. foreign I want you to catch this you're acting like children all the time Dios no responses God doesn't answer your question it's my faith is and I finish with this is he departed into a mountain for what to pray it's speaking of Jesus we have to be by ourselves with God many times to pray on the land watch the scene the ship was in the midst of the Sea on the land where it was a ship where was Jesus the following verse country and he saw the toiling and growing even though for the wind was contrary to them how could Jesus see them if he was on the land you understand Jesus was not there he was on the land he was praying he had a vision he saw his disciples tired the Bible said let's read it again together he saw them toiling and Rowing the Bible is the Bible wants you to understand that he knows what your what Your toil is what you're going through the Bible says that the wind was contrary aren't you tired of everything what was going wrong how could Jesus see this because he had a vision foreign that's why he went walking to rescue Amigos rescue his friends and I finished with his testimony every time that my pastor our pastor goes out on a missionary field when I speak of faith I also said that I was going to speak on the gifts it's important for the people you learn what the Bible says about the gifts 90 of what the majority of these churches have heard [Applause] they say that the gifts are no longer needed oh we don't need the gifts anymore what the gifts we have the word that has partial truth but let us look at the scene here Jesus was not only a prophet is he was the god prophet yes and he was as a man he didn't know what was happening the Bible says that you saw them that they were toiling foreign this is gone that is a gift thanks for the gift Jesus Jesus he could go walking and go and rescue his friends every time I'm Amanda I like to pray yes because it's a nature is so days before your pasture goes and goes out to these different countries by the grace of God because God has provided a gift he's sovereign this man has a problem this man is stuck over here other times I see symbols foreign Glory Glory every gift that God has placed in the church has to be proven first is has to be proven first is when the Holy Spirit began to give this gift into the church I recognize that sister she spoke in tongues that's the Holy Spirit and I know the life that she lives foreign trip to Denver and this Vision that God gave me okay when I begin to speak to your pastor what he's going to encounter over there something I still don't understand I know when you get there there's going to be an atmosphere there's going to be a contrary not that the church will be operating this atmosphere but what was happening at that moment it was gonna be contrary because there was a malignant purpose be able to kill two people in those in that congregation Persona there were not just any any people was the the wife of the past and and his daughter crocodiles brother you can say what does that have to do with it that's the way God speaks to show me the nature of the spirits that we're attacking in Denver uh I told my pastor the spirits personas don't want to kill these people um very very like like stealth like like likes to hide it's it's hides under the water it only shows its eyes oh when the crocodile bites it's death there's no way a great victory in that place when our pastor gets there is the the wife and the daughters that there's a great chance that they will not make it now the vision begins to form the picture it's not the good picture it's good when you go you say we're here he has a trial that magnitude of this man of God that's what Visions are foreign prayed the atmosphere begin to change God began to move now this is just a small testimony I don't have no more time this is here for you for all of you we could grow in faith praise God praise and worshiping let us exalt him uh God has not forgotten let us pray for this handkerchief Senor Lord make a prayer handkerchief is placed the body of the mother of sister Cynthia the sickness it has to recognize the Lord for the glory of God In
