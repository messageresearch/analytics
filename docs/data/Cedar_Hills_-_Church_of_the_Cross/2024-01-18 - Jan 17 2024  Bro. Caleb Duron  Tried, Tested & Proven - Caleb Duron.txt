was coming to join the pastor and brother Tommy Tommy and on a little journey and then uh brother Caleb said get here early enough and you can preach for us I said well okay okay so here I am and then I I got here kind of late he said he said I'm the slowest driver from here to Tucson so uh I say well you know but you know God here just in time amen thank you brother Caleb for having me thank you brother Caleb for interpreting is there any other Caleb in the room that I need to acknowledge there's two more yeah I understand we're going to change the name to Caleb Tabernacle after a little

of the rest of my family here God bless you thank you brother Jimmy amen yeah you can always count on him to cheer you on huh nobody else says amen he'll say Amen so forget about and brother Omar where did he go yeah he said I'm gonna be in your Amen Corner so y'all can stay quiet if you want to those say amen for the rest of how many is glad to be in the house of God to my family back home and to the The Amazing Grace Temple God bless you thank you for watching they're trying to jump on now well I'm ready are you ready the place looks beautiful I love it but you know eye is not seen and ear is not heard or nor has it even been recorded of what things God has prepared for us amen but the next scripture says it has been revealed to us by his spirit so we can see our creativity our vision is coming from somewhere amen so God bless you Ephesians chapter 6 if you would try not to hold you too long would you read with me verse 10 11 and 12 amen so it reads like this finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might chapter 6 verse 11 put on the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil and then verse uh 12 here for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the uh what it say sorry Ru rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high and then I do have another scripture but be uh two more references but we'll do uh James in a little while but for now would you turn to First Peter amen First Peter chapter 1 and uh 6 through eight 6 through eight is that six to eightth there okay yeah six says wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season I want everybody to repeat for a season if need be you are in heaven is through manifold Temptations verse seven says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perish though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ Hallelujah whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah let's bow our heads to pray father we love you thank you for your word get me out of the way you've done done it time and time before and I'm counting on you now as ever speak to the hearts of your children those that are here those that are watching wherever this message will go may it cause a Revival within the believer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for there is none greater amen amen amen you may you may be seated I I want to uh go back to real quickly first Peter uh 7 that verse there because uh if you notice it says for the trials of your faith can you put it up for the trial of your faith be much more precious than that of gold that perish though it may uh though it be tried with fire might be found into the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ but I want to explain something real quick that's just not a few of your trials that's not your self-inflicted trials or trials that are are brought on You by others the ones you've asked for the ones you didn't these are all trials are permitted so that you can be presented is this all right it'll be presented and it'll be for the honor and glory and praise of Jesus Christ he say how can my trial be for the honor and Glory well there was a a Time way back in the day when when seemingly God was looking for something to do and I guess Lucifer was looking for something to do and they kind of run into each other and he said where have you been and Satan answers back oh I was just wandering around trying to find a flaw there's nothing I can do I'm kind of bored and what does God say he said have you considered my servant joob there ain't nobody like him in the world it's Satan goes I have I've looked him over was going to work him over but you got this hedge of protection around him and that doesn't mean a bunch of bushes now no there's a a group of angels they're circling job and Paul Lucifer could just not break through huh so he said if you took that hedge away he said he will curse you to your fa and and surprisingly the Lord says game on nothing out of you young people nothing really let me try a different way bet bet goes all right bet so God says but just don't touch his life and don't touch his body now that was in the beginning right but we've heard that later on in life something like don't touch the oil and don't touch the wine the this whole idea of being tempted and tried it's not so much that God didn't have uh didn't know what job would do because God knew perfectly well what job was going to do you know to some extent job knew what he was going to do to some extent job knew what he would do to some to some degree but a lot of us think we know what we would do can somebody say Amen if it was me Brother David if it was me in your situation I would simply do this this or this I would say thus thus or I don't know what you're doing come on David say amen and job had three friends like that too stood there for seven days now I know I got friends and I've got friends but I never had friends to stare at me for seven days but first of all seven minutes into have been like what y'all looking at you what do you want get out of here right but job just sat there too and they sat there what did you do why is all this happening maybe job didn't know it then but first Peter tells us now that he'll receive him all the honor and all the glory and all the praise because through your Temptation and through your trial you will not stop loving God you will not stop praising God we got nobody else to blame it's not this one or that one it's the devil he tricked you he trapped you he did make you do it but somewhere along the line we said Lord Lord I need you right now come on that's what makes us who we are because we don't give up and we don't stop we don't quit fighting brother Bram said at the end of deep calling to the Deep he said Satan we are weak but we are not Defeated come on we got to do better than that maybe some of you feel weak tonight huh let me tell you you might feel weak you might be weak but you were not defeated amen amen it might seem like you're defeated and you might seem like you're finished and you might seem like I can't take one more minute of this let me encourage you tonight just turn your eyes see it there is a way of Escape that way of Escape has been laid out for see job didn't have it like that so God wasn't proving job to God it was partly to prove job to job because job had to realize who he was I mean come on let's be real job started getting kind of funny there sitting on a pile of [Music] ashes his boilers you know getting count it down but then he received Revelation the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name he started to wake up and come into praise he said and though these worms eat my yet in this flesh I shall see God are you with me so then God was proving a little bit of job to job but what this contest was really about God was proving job to Satan that's right you see it so what I'm going through what what you're going through partially is to prove us to us so brother Caleb I can realize who I really am is anybody with me now huh huh it it was just recently don't let me lose that bring me back to that somebody you're going to have to help me all right okay it was just recently that I begin to watch people and brother Diego it finally hit me it isn't Flesh and Blood it isn't your fault it isn't me against you it isn't this church against that chur it isn't that that sister wanted to be that way anybody it isn't that that brother woke up one day and said I'm gonna be the best drug addict there is come on somebody he didn't say I'm going to try a heroin just get myself addicted I'm going to drink every day of my life just throw my life away nobody starts off like that sin always takes you further than you wanted to go are you with me the Lord our God is a gentleman but the Devil is a molester of people I'm trying to be careful hope you understand God won't BSE himself on no body but the devil will take whatever you won't give him so what part of it is our responsibility we didn't get enough Holy Spirit to combat the devil at his own game so how do we get out of it it's simple turn to the way of Escape turn turn to the blood turn to Christ Jes now it isn't God not going to come down and do it for you you're going to have to do it yourself and you can do all things wait wait wait it's not Christ will do all things through you no it's I can do all things through Christ you get the difference we're wanting Christ to do it for us but he wants us to do it through him how can we do it through him oh because he already did it that's why is that right are you with me all right the fight is on and it's becoming tense the devil is trying to destroy you and me and brother William tears all the pieces but my God is real and he's real in my soul my God is real for he is washed and made me whole oh it goes on his love for me for me is like pure gold my God is real I can feel in my soul somebody say Amen this is not a lost battle not at our end we are Overcomers by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony is that right this nonsense can I say what the prophet said this one here brother Bram said now don't say this well I'm a weak well I'm weak uh my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian well I don't know anybody who's a good Christian good Catholics I don't know any good Muslims come on somebody help me out throw me something he said I'm not a very good Christian he said that's just what the devil wants you to think so I'm an alcoholic what who said that I'm a drug addict I'm a loser I'm a failure well who told you that oh wait wait wait let me try it this way uh have Giants in the land we can't take it we're too small for them who told them that so it's the same difference with the bride of Jesus Christ going into the promised land and we are saying there's too many Giants over there we can't do it we're we're I'm not a good Christian I'm a loser my faith is not strong I can't quit it's your fault you made me this way it's the pastor's fault he wasn't there for me brother Bram wasn't real those prophecies were oh come on can I go there we can explain this this and this you know they tried that with Moses too they explained why the river was poisoned then the frogs left then they died then the flies came they were just all circumstances well then tell me this how did hail fall from a clear sky and burn his fire on the ground explain to me how the firstborn of Egypt died and nobody else you might get away with some of the other stuff tell me how two million people crossed the sea on dry land and just by the same coincidence when Pharaoh went in there the water just decided tough fall right you can't explain Moses you can't explain away those things so don't tell me brother brandham this and brother brandham that and brother stop being a copout um quit making excuses and just simply tell me you're not a Believer and leave the rest of us Believers alone okay is that all right I'm not going to your house trying to convince you I don't go to your denominational church and try to disrupt you by the way why don't you take your church separating nonsense where am I getting this from and try that stuff on a denomination somewhere because it ain't going to fly in our ranks brother brandham was Vindicated you're not there's a picture of a pillar of fire I don't care how many selfies you got I don't care how many filters you use you ain't got no Pillar of Fire over here come on so stop saying I'm not a good Christian that's just what the devil wants to hear you say talking his language brother brandham said don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all those I want a positive amen a little more positive see he said all the time I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart with all my heart your testimony always your everything never permit a negative thought your mind if you can help it is this all right but the problem with us Believers is a prayer line instead of focusing you know like the little train engine that couldn't you know I think I can I think I can I sounded funny sorry we ought to be going up I do believe I do believe I do believe don't let the devil get a word in edge wise that brother ain't got discernment somebody must have told him that or he guessed or he read your Facebook or something like that you know that's why I don't got social media that way if the Lord shows me something you can never tell me I saw it on somebody's face Facebook that that's just too much that's too easy but I do see a screen and I do see what you're doing 90% of the time I don't even tell anybody right because God has to permit you to do so may I'm sidetracking may I go on got a little more time said you can't I can't help the thoughts from coming he said but just do like the farmer does just don't let them plant any nest in your head he said and if it starts to come on he said no sir Jesus Is My Savior all things are mine let me try that again all things are everything is mine so then why the trials why the tests because if God doesn't let you go through it you're never going to rise to your full potential you're never going to see that you can speak the word you can never going to see that you can pray and if you have faith as a mustard seed you could say unto this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and it shall be done there's somebody back home who is tackling a a a a problem in her life she just decided one day I'm not going to do this and this and this anymore and I stood there watching and progression is getting better and better and she's getting stronger and stronger so let's get down to real business ready well brother Caleb Duron Caleb what did you pray it wasn't me what sermon did you preach that help this young lady nothing well what what word did you speak that caused it to happen it was nothing I did but what happened the young lady touched the Hy of His Garment you understand when Jesus comes the tempter's Power I said when Jesus comes the tempter's power is broken it's broken it has no more power it has no more strength I've told this before you remember this when I said Samson when he's in there it wasn't what the Philistines did to overpower him they overpowered him and it was his own fault he told a secret he was his own doing but see Samson when he was working in that Mill there began to remember the former glories of a day gone by remembered the time that I prayed and I asked God to deliver me did the time that I prayed and nobody was there and nobody could help me but I cried out to God remembered God was faithful and he came down on the sorry did you catch me interject myself in that that's why I know what happened remembered going around in circles and I killed a lion with my bare hand I carried off the gates of Gaza I took a Jawbone one time and I beat back 1,000 Philistines I remember those days and all of a sudden he got hot and sweaty and he r b I don't think it ever grew back that's just me he he he he must have felt a little [Music] stubble brother I don't care I don't care if they shaved him the next day it was never about the hair commitment to God can you imagine if he if I'm right can you imagine he just felt that stubble and he get he starts to shout he can't see now gets down in a little corner Lord I don't care if they save me tomorrow my hair didn't do that it was my faith in you that did that and if I have ever found Grace in your sight Remember Me this one more time you understanding it now so that's all that has to happen the god that delivered you before the god that got you home from wherever you were that you shouldn't have been the god that restored you once restored you once can restore you again really yes see because you see brother will there's Grace and then there's Amazing Grace brother brother Caleb what what's Grace well Grace is what gets you out of it the first time and Grace is what get you out of it the second time and I'm not talking about sister Grace we're talking about Grace right my buddy okay look and then Grace might get you out of it a third time and then you get there a fourth time but by your fifth time you're going there just can't be any L God must be done with me and suddenly you hear Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a rich like me not you I was but now I but now I see Let's cross over my chains are gone I've been set [Music] [Applause] free my God my savior has rescued me can you hear it now Amazing Grace over and over and over and and over again do you believe it's not God's fault either God didn't make this happen but you'll never learn this until you go through and you're tested and you're proven not to God but to yourself and to Satan and more than I need to know myself I want that old snake in the grass I want that old Fork tongue backstabbing go ahead try it help him out two faced anybody got any words for Brother come on help him out now all right all right I don't want I want that slimy slithery I want that no good loser L thank you I want him to pay and I want him to know what I'm learning I'm learning I'm his child and it don't matter how bad I've been he may have to take a belt to me and that's all right I don't I don't I don't know I don't know did anybody ever count how many times you were whooped now now you sisters like Gracie here I I you probably what you probably count on your hand maybe my little girl I can count I know three maybe maybe cuz all I got to do is look at her do this little bit here sorry D love you honey right but boys I don't care how many times you just keep lighting them match lighting them match have the nerve to turn around and say I didn't do it well then how' that burned down I weren't even there turn around the box of matches in your pocket all right I don't know how many times I got whooped but it didn't stop me from being my Father's son he still my dad so it don't matter how many times I disappoint myself in the Lord I know that he's still my father and nothing can separate me from the love of God Christ Jesus anybody say Amen will you go to jam James chapter 1 please a few more minutes and I'll wrap it up I hope this all all right I came to tell you it's not your fault and nobody said amen I said I came to tell you that it's not your fault you know uh I promise a few more minutes I used to say I used to say that there was a a a like a comic I used to think was funny comic strip and um it was Satan sitting on a rock looking at the world and he's crying and and Michael the Archangel comes along what's the matter he said I'm getting blamed for a bunch of stuff I didn't do Michael goes there there and I used to use that and he to say he's right it's not his fault he just lays out a trap and you make a choice wait a minute wait a minute I got quotes to say different brother Bron said it's not your fault you got trapped and I realized the Lord made me realize couple days ago that by me using that example I was throwing an anointing of condemnation on my own congregation I couldn't figure out why they couldn't like overcome because I was telling them it was their fault so a couple of Sundays ago I made them all repeat after me are you ready it's not my dad's fault it's not my mom's fault all right it's not the pastor's fault it's not God's fault I'm not a loser come on everybody I'm not a loser not a failure I am not an accident I have a purpose I am not a disgrace say that one again I am a child of God it's strange how excited my church got all of a sudden yes so now we're singing a different song I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God in James chapter 1 verse uh 12 and I I'm gonna start wrapping it up here it says this put on my old man eyes here we go blessed is the man that endureth Temptation okay I'm going to finish reading it then I'll go back to that for when he has tried he shall receive the Crown of Life let me see if I'm getting that right which the Lord had promised to them that love him okay now I'm a little bit what is this all about let me get this right it does not say blessed is the man that goes around it or over it under it no it doesn't say that does endure means to continue in the same state now I'm not saying that if you fall in Temptation you just go on with it I'm not saying but it means to continue in the same state if if you get stuck in a trap you're to still continue to praise God no matter what you continue to conduct yourself as best you can as a child of God you know don't let nobody say to you aren't you ashamed coming to church like that if you want a if you want an example of this watch one of the testimonies from Billy Paul brother Billy Paul Paul because he said his dad never treated him that way his dad never rebuked him as far as going to church but when he did show up the church he simply told Brother Billy Paul it was good to see you at church last night can can brother Caleb is it all right I don't know how much time I got is it okay because I have to do this there was brother Billy Paul talks about having a smoking problem and he said uh he said he had things were going all right the Lord had already healed him you know oh that's another thing man this is hard okay okay so when he gets sick and he's dying in the hospital Billy Paul Paul brother brandom comes down to see him and brother Billy Paul says oh Dad I'm glad to see you please pray for me and brother brandom says oh no oh no I didn't send you did you pray but he said so right there brother he said brother brandham led me to the Lord Jesus Christ this man had already seen the angel of the Lord but he still wasn't a convert do you know that brother brandham did not throw Billy Paul out of the house he he didn't brother Billy Paul said he came home one day late at night drunk and he goes I missed the first step and Dad heard it the next morning he didn't kick him out he simply said you can't live here like that wasn't throwing him out he was giving him an opportunity to change brother Billy Paul said I moved out on my own brother BR said you don't have to do that Paul but you can't stay here like that brother Billy said I want to go changes things a little bit don't it okay so anyway uh back to the hospital converted now and then now they're going fishing I know it's kind of and he said but I hadn't kicked the smoking problem yet and he said he was sitting there in the car got cigarettes and his lighter in his pocket and he goes I wonder if Dad knows I'm still smoking he said right then Dad goes hey Paul you're still smoking hey Paul he roll down the window go and he goes what' you throw out the window he goes you know my lighter and cigarettes my god brother brand asked him had you ever done that before he said all the time he goes how many times he goes I could have bought a car with all the lighters I thrown out the window I could have bought a car with all the lighters that thrown out the window this I'm I watched this recently that's fresh in my mind brother says well let's go back and find him he said he looked didn't you see me throw him out the window he said brother Rand gave me that look he didn't say no more he said when he gets to where they are he said look where you threw them out out there was a cross there they had landed right there and the cross said get right with God get make this stuff up he said right there brother BR said I'm gonna pray for you and you ain't never going to have this problem again and that's what happened what I'm saying to you is we have have power over everything because everything is mine to endure says to continue in the same state to remain firm under suffering or Misfortune or pain because in doing so in other words some through the fire some through the flood some through great trial through the blood because in doing so he shall uh uh uh he shall receive the crown of life that is Promised by the Lord so don't think that you're weak don't think that you're finished you just got tricked you just got lied to but there is a truth that has been planted in your heart since for most of us before we were ever born matter of fact for all of us before the foundation of the world there was something put there it would always call us back to where we come [Applause] from he goes on to say in James verse 13 now let no man let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God is not tempted of evil uh uh and neither tempted he any man so God doesn't do it he allows the devil to do something and I I hope I you understand what I'm saying brother will would y'all come I hope you understand what I'm saying with this it all takes place for our own good because of the trials because of the tests I get stronger and stronger and stronger amen amen do you know the song um mercy of God I love you Lord I I'll sing you you'll catch it I'm sure I just want you to know your trials and your tests they're not in vain those of you who think you're the weakest you're actually the strongest let me say that one more time those of you who think you're the weakest you're actually the strongest huh you hear
