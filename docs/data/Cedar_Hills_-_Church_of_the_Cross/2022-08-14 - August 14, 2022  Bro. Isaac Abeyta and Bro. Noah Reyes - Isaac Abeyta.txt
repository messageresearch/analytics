[Music] amen not to have you standing much let's let's turn in our scriptures to matthew verse 10. matteo verso diaz but not matthew chapter 10 verse 8-10 yes now this was the first commission jesus gave to the disciples jesus he tells them heal the sick freely give the gracia but then he tells them provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses neither bordon for the workman is worthy of his me amen may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated thank our pastor for for the opportunity now in another portion of scripture he also told about about 70 others to go out and do the same i said and he sent him out by twos and he gave him power and authority poder over all devils now imagine this all these years science doctors doctors have been searching for a cure honestly for sicknesses and diseases and he tells his disciples disciples go out and be the cure isaiah because why because they had power and authority over all devils now imagine what a son and daughter can do imagine you 11 22. whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you've said received okay this is this first row in front of me stand up don't be embarrassed to stand up now imagine pastor caleb telling you this right now he's giving you power over all devils all diseases but he's going to come to you and he's going to say okay i'm sending to mexico you ministers you too i'm sending to south america usted you guys are going across the uh to the east coast but when you go you're going without money remember the scripture do not worry in that very hour what you shall see because in that very hour it will be given unto you that's why you hear the preachers say get the word inside you and at its appointed time he's going to bring it out as you have needed but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory by christ jesus jesus why because he's jehovah gyra porque porque don't even take a changing of clothes don't take a jacket psalms 914. why because he shall cover you with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler allah so you see our pastor just went to mexico mexico that the holy spirit is leading you though don't get me wrong i i feel for these people you see them when they lost everything but is god calling you there but and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when you depart out of the house of the city shake off the dust of your feet without in another portion of scripture it says shake off the the dust of your feet for a testimony against him he tells them if they don't receive it's no different than when god sends a prophet you know is different he says believe who i send no no you got to raise your hand but just think about this you want to be used by god i never understood the scripture when i was your age it says present your body a living sacrifice present holy and acceptable i didn't understand it no no you don't understand present your body a living sacrifice until this flesh starts to go through hell on earth i didn't understand it until i started would would be used and then i would get sick so when god calls you to something much is going to be required those who believe the message you're adding to the scripture those who believe the messages are adding to the scriptures you can't do it so brother brother i remember brother tommy saying this you might not agree with it but don't say you you you disbelieve it because if you say you don't believe it you don't give god a chance to work inside you know difference between jesus then jesus and jesus now jesus the prophet says he's just got a different color of sudan and brother gets challenged on surface there's anybody new here or or online maybe there's there's these mysteries to this mysterious what really happened in the garden of eden you eat an apple or a prime organic so he's speaking to this man you see a prophet does not know everything that's right he is the very mouthpiece of god when the cases would come when the legend he would say boom i'll go into a vision of town past events things that happened in their lives and then he would say i'd have to go back and hear the recording because i don't know what i said why because it was not a man it was the lord and uh he uh he he tells brother brown you're wrong on that lisa he says i may be but tell me about it now whereas the species you said was between man and beast was it a chimpanzee he says no it won't mix [Music] and the man says if the original sin is here it ought to be here also now again our prophet doesn't know anything this is when brother branham was receiving the revelation to serpents then he says where's it at brother brown i'm saying lord he said romano you see before that beat that beast it was the closest thing to a man he was upright then after the fall he was cursed on his belly into skip some of this here now without a prophet or i see in prophet i've seen it many times i know a lot of ministers and muchas versus ministers and they try to probe it these things and you try to figure them out but they get all mixed up because those mysteries porque estos mysterios were only given to one now what was one of the one of the main things was lost in the beginning of the spoken word el poder de [Music] you start to see or in other words they won't be fully manifest you'll see it here and there he says until these pencils get so tight the air oblah it's just as good if jesus christ himself because she is him and he is her el essaya i am bone of my bone west of the these i want to see these miracles taking a contestant i know i was baptized a certain way might not have been 100 on scripture but as long as i know in my heart you want to see original results you got to do original requirements that's brother tommy jr why because there is a correct way to receive the holy ghost there's a correct way to receive the new birth yes it does matter what church you go to it matters who you choose to be your pastor just about every church will speak about the supernatural they believe that god does miracles is not producing that but if a church follows more of what the church says god would not back all these miracles all these supernatural things he wouldn't back up if i wasn't preaching the truth so all these all these brothers out there they're they're wanting to see something scriptures say faith without works is dead just just to finish here let me skip over there's just something about when a confession comes from your mouth if what was in the mind of god in the beginning would have just stayed a thought we wouldn't even be here today but the power of the spoken word scripture says that he maketh intercession on your confession you young people i know it's like a roller coaster who says instead of just hearing the word i would take the word and i would start to dress myself up what does that mean i begin to apply it to me yes go from service to service and you don't feel changed you don't feel nothing we have the greatest revelation all the time he literally says para what's next but when you begin to exercise when you say enough's enough that's a garbage stop one day jesus got his finger and he drew a line in the sand you've got to draw your own line in the center as second corinthians 10 second corinthians yes verse 4 anything that stands between you and god i don't care if it's your friends no important amigos or if it's your family familia anything that stands before you and god it's gotta be torn down for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds this is what you got to do now casting down imaginations arguments in every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ you've got to destroy every obstacle that stands between not give yourself to christ every single day you gotta make sure that nothing is standing between you and god throw it in the trash tonight [Applause] man god bless you this evening give our hand to our lord jesus christ and our servants and we don't we don't want to take too much of your time we'll get going if you'll stand for the reading of the scripture if you open your bibles in matthew 7. and it reads this way asking it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that seeketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth into him that knocketh it shall be reading of the word you may take your so we see the scripture here your mental health it's in the book it's all right here and there's many times that we struggle to believe that you truly believe but you have to believe it there's many things that we go through we have our battles but who are we to deny his glory but if he chose to make something out of you who are you to deny his glory gloria right many times muchos misses we we think that we're too far gone we think that we've uh expensed all his all his grace but when he pleased the lord to separate me from my mother's womb to call me by his grace i believe when god takes a step towards you and you have to take a step next tomorrow we hear this many times god is a gentleman he's not to force you for he'll take a step towards you he'll make advances towards you but you have to take a step next tomorrow he's going to wait for you right many times we we think you pensamos muchas versus well brother i go to church i pray now i'm doing my part where where did god come in i i'm the one that's that's going to church brother if only you knew how far down you would be if he hadn't taken a step towards you first glory to god it was done before the foundation of the world again i say amen but it takes someone in this present time to be able to receive it i like something brother branham says when love has met its fail love has met its bill when love has met its failure and you can't have you can't have faith without love it's what i see in this quote right here we we find uh god extending his grace to us but love has to find its fill it has to find its place and what is because that is faith drawing it is pulling from that group we see jesus when when that woman touched the border of his garment and the disciples said jesus they they depress against you when love has met its fill amore right love has to be put into something it requires a dispenser right a dispenser it has to be able to hold something in africa in africa in uganda there to the man we were at the restaurant and he took the scripture matthew 6 verse 9 and 10. matteo says and here he is explaining this to to the man and it reads this way after this manner therefore pray ye our fathers that are in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as as it is in heaven so there he is telling this man to you know you know the lord's prayer you know the scripture and he tells them how does it read and he begins to say say hallowed be thy name you know they're kind of thinking trying to remember the recorder and brother caleb turns to them does it say on earth no it doesn't this is see it says in earth in earth and the in this vessel right here of clay the the the varroa it's where that will has to take place but it has to be dispensed right now yes it was all done before the foundation but there has to be someone to receive it right now but what sayeth the answer of god unto him i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal but okay led even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace there is a remnant that is called according to the election of greece i like something brother will told me one time algo comedy hermano williams [Music] you know there's so much we have to do in one day we're going to do these great things but it has to take in this present time transfer has to take place was made unto them i use and now i see evaluator that are transfers made unto us you say brother well you weren't here when our founding pastor was here understanding receive the father i like that brother you know many times we look at our past say brother i don't understand i've done so many things that are wrong that's good good for you but i have a god that is rich in mercy he's waiting on you because he's already made that step he took that step towards you now it just takes you to take a step back towards him to be able to look at this word to be able to say i will stand for you lord she had gone medic after medic just spent all her money trying to find a fix for her issues she had reached her end avial cansalo finn but once she did so she said if i can only touch the border you heard news of a little man coming to the city so she she was now all left all alone and she had this reproach that was following yesterday and perhaps you may feel the same way hey brother i i feel unclean i've done so many things that are wrong but if you only understood that it only takes for you to extend your hands you know many times we complicate it so much but it takes a simple act of faith to be able to reach your hand out but i'll cancer and say lord i accept you i accept my healing i accept my deliverance you know there's so much needless pain that we go through but did you know there's a pain that is needed how many know that there is a pain that is needed is necessary brother branham and the smyrnan church he may commit you to death as he did paul pablo he may commit you to suffering as he did job well frustration and not of peace his purpose to proposito is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect as brother jerry was speaking this morning said satan take he he wants you to go out even for a moment is it can be so hard to believe that sometimes but it takes a simple act of faith so that you may have a long life but i could think uh yes now you asked why would i want to have a long life this tragic life so miserable and miserable filled with troubles it is eternal life a life where you stand for the word of god that is to honor thy father yes by standing for this word he's quoting a certain brother and he says quoting this brother he says he says i would rather be standing on the word and someone asked him why i'd rather be standing on the word than in heaven then you god is obligated god is not obligated to you yes he is obligated to his words and what does it require a step of almost a full day's trip esteban it has produced something the bible says that every plant produced according to its kind this message has produced according to its kind they can't tell you otherwise it's too late it's already produced brother branham once again in message divine love now is master maru met its fail god is obligated when you've come to your end and man's met their end then grace you take a step we can only believe brother branham in the message elijah and elisha elias now in the audience and everywhere is but this spirit of god which is here now if you'll just believe on him he will heal you see ben he will just confirm if a man now lord there lord we just pray for these young people we pray for the people in the building here anybody that only faith pleases you lord and the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] amen amen you deserve the glory and the honor oh lord we
