[19:54] 2020 last year now listen though 2020
[19:57] was many things and lots of things
[19:58] changed one thing stayed exactly the
[20:00] same and that thing was the great
[20:03] outdoors what is the title of your story
[20:06] oh right that thing that's important

[20:50] you'll never forget the buck or the duck
[20:52] either okay okay where was i right 20
[20:55] 20. let's back up a little bit
[20:57] this 2020. lots of things have changed
[21:00] but one thing that had not changed was
[21:01] nature the great outdoors beautiful
[21:04] astounding world
[21:06] of i'll be back opening of god's
[21:08] creation keep talking boy great
[21:12] you know i'm glad you're all here this
[21:13] would have been a really short story
[21:16] it was 2020 and me and my brother paula
[21:18] decided to go on a hunt now the hunt was
[21:22] an excellent hunt because we happened to
[21:23] know a very wonderful rancher he was
[21:25] nice enough to let us go on the property
[21:28] and go on a private hunt on his land you
[21:31] have to understand this land wasn't just
[21:32] any land this was prime buck country
[21:35] there were bucks the size of antelopes
[21:38] and if you've never seen an antelope
[21:40] there was some the size of cows and if
[21:41] you've ever seen a cow where have you
[21:43] been
[21:45] they were massive 12 point bucks
[21:48] beautiful things and the rancher was
[21:50] kind enough to let us come on his
[21:52] property and hunt one single buck just
[21:54] one
[21:56] he was very very close to this butt
[22:02] very close
[22:08] unnaturally close go get it
[22:10] come on
[22:12] going against the forces of nature close
[22:16] it almost didn't seem real i mean i
[22:18] don't even know what else to say at this
[22:19] point
[22:21] easy
[22:23] and as you can see the rancher loved
[22:25] dear old snowflake his most prized deer
[22:28] of all his most prized buck in all this
[22:30] land and so as we met him and we walked
[22:33] up to the rancher i'll never forget the
[22:35] words that he said to me a set of
[22:37] unforgettable words to both me and paul
[22:39] and those words were
[22:41] well hello gentlemen how are you doing
[22:43] sir yes monster right what's your name
[22:46] young man
[22:49] pleasure to meet you
[22:51] absolute president
[22:52] i want you boys to have the best time of
[22:54] your life that's best wow have a good
[22:57] time yeah go camping fishing hunting
[22:59] okay whatever you always do whatever yes
[23:03] but have one condition okay one
[23:05] condition that's the one
[23:06] yes you don't touch my old snowflake
[23:10] don't don't even look it okay
[23:13] you don't shoot him you don't look at
[23:15] him right nothing
[23:16] off territory
[23:18] but other than that
[23:29] thank you so much
[23:30] and with that we were off me and paul on
[23:33] a hunting trip like never before and we
[23:34] did certainly camp wherever we pleased
[23:36] we fished wherever we pleased and we
[23:38] certainly did whatever we please you can
[23:40] do in the woods there's not much we
[23:42] discovered but
[23:44] three days of hunting had gone by and
[23:45] not a single buck was found
[23:48] nothing
[23:49] absolutely
[23:50] not
[23:51] the fourth day came around and we
[23:52] decided with the genius plan i said all
[23:55] you know we should do we should uh split
[23:57] up and just cover more territories last
[23:59] day of the hunt let's see if we can find
[24:00] some
[24:01] i think that's a good
[24:02] idea okay scooby-doo
[24:05] so we did we split up and i went on my
[24:08] way through
[24:10] the woodland lands
[24:12] don't worry it's loaded
[24:14] i went through the lands
[24:17] scouting
[24:18] watching waiting for something and lo
[24:21] and behold as i lifted my scope up there
[24:23] was a buck
[24:25] it had 12 points it was a massive beast
[24:29] it was my time to shine it was the one
[24:31] that god had gifted me but as it turned
[24:33] around it had a white face
[24:35] and thus it was snowflake i was
[24:37] devastated
[24:39] how could this happen to me but you know
[24:41] what here's the thing snowflake was 2000
[24:43] yards away the farthest i ever shot was
[24:44] 200 i thought well i mean what are the
[24:47] odds
[24:48] that i would actually make this shot
[24:50] i mean what's the worst that could
[24:52] happen the famous last words of anybody
[24:54] that anyone can say so i lifted my rifle
[24:57] i aimed at snowflake calculated for the
[25:00] distance calculated for the wind
[25:02] recalculated because i did it wrong and
[25:04] with that i said clam
[25:15] [Music]
[25:18] what a shot
[25:20] [Applause]
[25:23] an instance of terror came upon me
[25:30] an instance of terror
[25:31] what can i do how is this even possible
[25:34] i checked again it was true so i ran 2
[25:36] 000 yards in five minutes never seen
[25:38] before in human history and i made it to
[25:40] snowflake and there he was
[25:43] dead as a doornail
[25:47] i looked around
[25:49] there was no one that could be seen i
[25:50] said well maybe it's not the end of the
[25:52] world yet perhaps what we do is we
[25:54] relocate the creature i mean what's the
[25:56] worst that could happen no one's seen
[25:58] anything yet i mean after all other than
[26:00] the uh 200 people in this building
[26:02] no one could have possibly seen me i
[26:04] found a good place to let snowflake rest
[26:06] and thus
[26:07] i pulled out
[26:09] my handy-dandy metaphorical shovel and
[26:11] got to digging slowly but surely digging
[26:14] deeper and deeper into the ground until
[26:16] it was deep enough to or deep enough to
[26:18] hold this massive creature i pulled
[26:20] snowflake in
[26:22] put him in the hole and huzzah i'm out
[26:24] of trouble guiltless no one ever saw
[26:26] anything that i did who could possibly
[26:28] have seen this act
[26:31] and as i turned around
[26:33] you killed snowflake
[26:37] no no you did you just get a snowflake
[26:39] how do you know how do i know where's
[26:41] your proof
[26:43] what are you doing
[26:44] oh come on that's my proof
[26:48] that's great
[26:50] listen you can't tell anyone about this
[26:51] paul if you tell anyone what happened
[26:53] here today will never be allowed to come
[26:54] back on this ranch
[26:55] i will die of embarrassment i have to be
[26:58] buried in another country in the hole
[26:59] the size of snowflakes you understand
[27:01] what this means oh i won't tell
[27:09] and paul slurped away evilly
[27:12] and was often his own in the woods
[27:14] i thought well i might as well keep
[27:16] burying snowflake i mean surely i can
[27:18] trust my brother he is my brother after
[27:20] all
[27:22] no brother would ever betray another
[27:25] and with that
[27:26] snowflake was buried and the hunt was
[27:28] over two days had passed
[27:30] and on the monday after it happened
[27:32] all at a basketball game however i had
[27:35] work and we both
[27:37] well only paul really had chores at the
[27:40] time
[27:40] as we were walking away and i was on my
[27:42] way to work i'll never forget what paul
[27:44] said to me he said
[27:45] hey jules so uh you know i got a
[27:48] basketball game tonight
[27:50] i also got my chores but i don't really
[27:53] feel like doing them so
[27:55] you're gonna do them right
[27:56] what i have work what are you talking
[27:58] about
[27:58] remember the book
[28:01] [Music]
[28:04] got you with that one
[28:07] and the chores were done
[28:10] for two days these tours were done
[28:12] cleanest floors
[28:14] luckily these ones already pretty clean
[28:15] but the ones that i had cleaned were
[28:17] full of many horrors that paul's room
[28:19] should not have
[28:21] i cleaned and cleaned and cleaned and
[28:23] finally
[28:26] on the third day i was given a chore
[28:29] that was so menacing
[28:31] so terrible that i could not take any
[28:33] more of this and that chore that paul
[28:35] had requested of me was
[28:37] hey joel's uh so you know
[28:40] we have four dogs
[28:42] dog poop
[28:43] so you got to clean that up
[28:45] but we have no bags
[28:49] or gloves
[28:52] so good luck with that
[28:53] i'm gonna go
[28:55] and i just couldn't take it anymore
[28:57] that's ridiculous how could this happen
[28:58] and so in the instance of me needing to
[29:01] make up for my wrongdoings i ran and i
[29:04] ran all the way back to rio doso all
[29:07] those hours of mileage made up in two
[29:10] days of non-stop sprinting straight to
[29:12] the rancher's house
[29:14] and i confronted him and said
[29:16] mr rancher
[29:20] okay
[29:28] waiting for you really
[29:31] wow how'd your hunt go it was great
[29:34] it was great really yeah it was
[29:35] wonderful
[29:51] [Music]
[29:55] i know what you did
[29:57] and it was wrong
[29:59] but i forgive you for what you did
[30:02] you know and next time you come which
[30:04] will be never
[30:07] um i i expect you to respect the rules
[30:11] whether it's here or another ranch's
[30:13] problem
[30:14] okay
[30:15] god bless you thank you
[30:17] i believe you
[30:19] do i know you from somewhere
[30:22] lucious no oh wait wrong story wrong
[30:24] story
[30:25] sorry
[30:26] bit of a throwback there and so i was
[30:29] forgiven finally that burden was lifted
[30:31] off of my back never have to deal with
[30:34] those guilty things again and finally
[30:37] i was free
[30:42] you heard the story right of course of
[30:44] course you were just blabbing on
[30:46] i'm just sitting here thinking to myself
[30:49] why am i friends with such a criminal
[30:54] you should have your license revoked
[30:56] and never to hunt again you know
[31:01] i learned it from i've learned it from
[31:02] my peers
[31:04] so you're saying you're very easily
[31:06] persuaded
[31:08] yes now what what did you say i wasn't
[31:10] you go with the flow like a trout
[31:15] i'm gonna start pointing you the trout
[31:18] the brown drought does it have to be
[31:20] brown i think so
[31:23] what about can we go like a beige no
[31:26] if you keep it up you're going to be the
[31:28] cutthroat trout
[31:30] wow you'll be cut off from my lap okay
[31:32] see that was i was hoping for that one
[31:34] the first one was a little scary
[31:36] okay you know what professor there's one
[31:38] thing yes you know i can't help but
[31:41] think that after all that i really don't
[31:43] understand why the rancher forgave me i
[31:46] don't understand either you would have
[31:48] been shot
[31:50] if it was me but it's not me
[31:53] and that's what's so great about our
[31:56] experiment today oh because if it was me
[32:00] you would not be here right now
[32:02] but
[32:03] i'm going to tell you of a greater power
[32:07] that so few know anything about
[32:10] who can tell me
[32:12] what that power might be
[32:17] you better not say what i think you're
[32:19] going to say
[32:22] it's not thor
[32:24] it's bigger than thor
[32:26] double-a batteries
[32:29] what is my cancellation device
[32:32] anybody
[32:34] yes sir
[32:36] jesus
[32:37] not just jesus but his blood
[32:40] so i'm going to show you julian exactly
[32:43] chemically wise
[32:45] why
[32:46] the rancher forgave you
[32:49] and why you are very lucky today
[32:52] i think that should do it
[32:54] okay
[32:56] so
[32:57] we are all human beings we make mistakes
[33:01] right did you not make a mistake yes
[33:03] several
[33:04] basically all of them you broke all
[33:07] yes we will not go there you did break a
[33:09] lot of them
[33:10] so
[33:12] we all do the same thing right how many
[33:15] your mom tells you okay it's time for
[33:17] bed
[33:18] and you want to continue watching disney
[33:20] plus and you pitch a big feet
[33:23] and you start crying
[33:27] aj
[33:30] [Applause]
[33:31] you start crying because you want to
[33:33] watch more disney plus and you know
[33:35] church is the next day and then you wake
[33:36] up all cranky and you don't want to get
[33:39] dressed
[33:41] and then you're terrible in sunday
[33:42] school and the teachers have to kick you
[33:44] out with the deacons
[33:46] that's what i'm talking about
[33:48] you are this little cup you are a foam
[33:51] cup
[33:52] very soluble
[33:54] full of trash
[33:58] but it's not your fault i must say
[34:02] because we were born in sin shaped in
[34:04] iniquity
[34:05] and unfortunately
[34:07] we have the tendencies to want to lie to
[34:09] cheat maybe you go to school
[34:12] and you cheat on a test
[34:14] maybe you say a bad word
[34:17] or all these things start to pile up in
[34:19] your cup
[34:21] but there comes a time when you're so
[34:23] tired of these things and you know
[34:25] you've messed up and you say lord
[34:28] i do not want to continue cheating on
[34:30] tests
[34:31] i do not want to go and kick my dog when
[34:34] he does not do what i say
[34:36] i don't want to choke out my brother
[34:38] anymore
[34:40] so what you must do
[34:42] is you go to the lord and you tell him
[34:44] these things lord i don't want to
[34:45] continue acting like
[34:48] a beast
[34:50] a scary beast walking around my house
[34:53] all mad
[34:54] i don't want to do that anymore
[34:57] so then what you do is you go to all the
[34:59] people that you did that wrong to
[35:01] because it's okay to pray to jesus but
[35:04] he didn't do nothing to you
[35:05] you go to the ones you did it wrong
[35:07] through
[35:08] so like brother julian went to the
[35:10] rancher and he said i'm sorry i shot
[35:12] your
[35:13] famous snowflake
[35:14] he melted i don't know what to tell you
[35:18] see if he would have just prayed about
[35:19] it the rancher would still be mad
[35:22] but he went
[35:23] to the rancher and said i'm sorry i
[35:25] didn't mean to do that
[35:27] so once you do all those things you go
[35:29] apologize to your dogs and your cats and
[35:31] your teachers and your brothers and
[35:33] sisters and you have all the trash
[35:36] you ask the lord to put it
[35:39] under his blood
[35:40] and as soon as you put it in his blood
[35:44] this is what happens
[35:50] very
[35:55] can everybody see what's taking place
[35:57] here
[36:02] it gets put
[36:04] in the sea of his forgetfulness
[36:09] and nobody can tell you that you did
[36:12] anything else wrong
[36:14] because the lord
[36:17] justifies you
[36:18] who can tell me what justify means
[36:25] and it's not your dad justin
[36:27] what you can answer what is it
[36:33] you don't know
[36:34] anybody else
[36:36] what does justify mean
[36:39] brother
[36:41] so he says just as if you never did it
[36:46] remember
[36:46] brother tommy how crispy are your
[36:48] cucumbers
[36:50] you don't ever bring it up again because
[36:52] he never did it
[36:54] same thing here
[36:56] no matter what it was
[36:58] you just go before the lord forgive me
[37:01] lord
[37:03] and once
[37:06] again it's as if you never did it
[37:12] but the key to all this is you don't
[37:14] continue doing the same things wrong
[37:17] you don't go back just because you get
[37:19] mad again and kick the dog
[37:24] don't knock the world over
[37:26] and you don't continue cheating on tests
[37:29] just because you got away with it
[37:30] you don't continue saying little bad
[37:32] words
[37:33] you don't continue watching disney plus
[37:36] on saturday night
[37:37] you try to go forward and get better
[37:40] amen
[37:41] and so that's what the blood does
[37:44] it annihilates all the sin and the wrong
[37:48] and that's the message that we wanted to
[37:51] share with you and that
[37:53] my friend is why the rancher forgave you
[37:57] wow
[37:58] what a story can we hear one for our
[38:00] amazing scientists who brought that all
[38:02] out it's amazing absolutely phenomenal
[38:12] well it was very nice being with you all
[38:14] today we look forward to next time but
[38:17] for now i got to go whip his little
[38:19] behind at some chests
[38:21] so you wish buddy i don't know how to
[38:24] hunt legally but i can't beat you at
[38:26] chess legally i never have to wish
[38:28] nothing i know who i am
[38:30] god bless you
[38:31] [Applause]

[47:29] you know i had an experience the other
[47:31] day
[47:34] as
[47:35] you all know i've been going to school
[47:41] and i did an estimate to do some yard
[47:43] work for somebody
[47:45] weeks ago
[47:51] well i got the job
[47:56] i did the work he sold
[47:59] and
[48:00] they were just so impressed with the
[48:02] outcome
[48:04] established they ended up paying me the
[48:07] original price i asked in the first
[48:10] place
[48:15] and
[48:16] he also is somebody that can hire me
[48:20] when i get out of school
[48:26] i don't believe that's any kind of
[48:27] coincidence
[48:32] and the the
[48:34] funny thing
[48:38] is that
[48:39] his wife's name is dolores
[48:45] but his name is chris
[48:48] chris
[48:49] like how
[48:52] that there's pain
[48:56] but it's fixed through christ

[49:09] everything
