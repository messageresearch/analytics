happy tonight amen you all may be seated have a couple of specials ask brother Julian Hill to come up first jul Hill then brother Angelo and Sister Sarah Angel Sarah God bless you everybody I I got inspired with this poem on Saturday and I thought I was going to read it on Sunday and that didn't happen so here we are and uh honestly uh it's been a bit of a troubling week but not because it's been bad it's just there's been a lot of anxiety around me and today was especially bad and I almost didn't want to read this because of it but uh I'm going to read it and I think you'll see why the devil didn't want me to so anyway uh this poem is called rise and because of how long it is I'm just just going to read it in English to save time but if you'd like a Spanish copy just let me know and I'll I'll print you one and get you one in Spanish on that note here we go dark days are upon us the children of Darkness act as stakeholders of an earth to which they shall not fall air it is not theirs it is ours for the meek shall inherit it the new Earth cometh but who stands ready to claim it a great deal of evildoers have stood against the gospel some are more worldly than others and others are more religious than the world even the sun is shrouded in darkness as the time of the eclipse takes hold Behold a great Shadow crosses America and the country does not see it the heavens and earth are moving now more than ever who moves with them is it to the unknown neighbor that he should inherit the buck or should we desire the Lord like the heart that panteth after the waters wherefore is our Destiny or wherefore is our identity is it in Christ to the believer the answer is Swift but to others it remains unknown I have hope that the Believers will abound that Joy will fill their hearts as the light do fill the lantern for though the times are dark the Believers are bright if nothing else I say I have the light I will stand before the world of the wicked not alone but with he who has overcome it even still I see the body in him for when my eyes are opened I behold the Vindicated unveiled and there she is the bride beside me now she shouts the bridegroom cometh and he who has an ear hears the children of Darkness have been here many years but now the children of God have arrived we who have access to the fullness of the word and all the power of the Holy Ghost are acting representing our Lord and walking as Giants in a Land of demons who scatter when hearing our footsteps they hear the Eagles cry and flee hear the Lions Roar and tremble watch The Oxen work and sweat and when they look to see either of the three instead they see a man Jesus Christ walking within the Sons and Daughters of God how do we know this is true many are the spreaders of Lies the doers of misdeeds and the deliverers of deception under such circumstances can anyone be saved if it were not so he would have told us but instead he stated that the devil cannot deceive the elect for they hear the proven promised through the parable of the prophet and cannot be shaken what grounds does the enemy have to speak on what have they done besides lie they have not come close to the truth that is Jesus Christ he beat every one of them for he is the one above all who among them has come back from the beating who among them has risen from the dead only God has he is the only truth one way and one life provided by the perfect sacrifice that was and is and is to come Jesus Christ Christ when he was crucified there we were those who would believe it when he was placed in the Tomb we were put there with him when he conquered death we did too by this assurance we sing Oh death where is your sting grave where is your Victory he is risen and with this Faith this hope we know now is our time now we rise rise to the challenge of the adversary for what challenge is there in an adversary who is already defeated rise to higher places symbol of John for what do we have to hear to fear when the Eagle's Wings carry us rise to the occasion for what better occasion is there than the occasion of the coming Christ rise above the Waters of man for what Terror do the depths distribute when Christ has already walked them we are Overcomers of the world for Christ overcame it first when he overcame it there we were for though we are the last as the scriptures State we are also the first we are the predestinated bride though those who many seek but few shall find We Are The Chosen those who were called out of the world and made the Third Temple where he is delighted to dwell we have been given the power to take the inheritance given to us before the foundation of the world and that was unjustly stolen from us today yay though the Giants of Jericho gaw they have not met they have yet to meet you the real you the Holy Ghost filled you the properly and the properly and perfectly placed you the powerfully positioned you the one who was called according to his purpose you of this one they have not seen if you want the promise the blessing and the bride needed to bring the Rapture then the unveiling must begin now now we must act yet the cast asks how do we take action what of the gate the answer is do as our Lord did before us step by step word for word and act for act for ACT we must do what our Lord did faces of the living Christ now is your time now it is your day now is the inheritance to be claimed so unto you my revelatory people I give you a word a word so simple yet so powerful by the Revelation that it could save millions that word it is the word that describes what our Lord did that we must do in our day for the sake of those who are within and those who are without and that word is Rise God bless you God bless [Music] you I was there when the spirit came F

the word we will open our Bibles Amos 33 and you can say Amen when you got it and it read it can two walk together except they be agreed and then we will turn to 2 verse 25 and it's read it and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the Conqueror and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I s among you let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we're so thankful for this opportunity that we can come among your people and then that we can receive from you so may you add the blessing over the reading of your word Lord we pray in Jesus Christ name amen you may be seated you come with an expectation this morning are we happy this morning you know why we should be happy because we are in the house of the Lord and when you look around yourself you will see the people that you will spend eternity together with so that should make us rejoice and be happy and thankful and also [Music] humbled so once I want to thank Caleb for the confidence and also my pastor brother Morton for letting me come along and I'm so thankful for the hospitality you you all have shown brother Julian and sister Mara opening up their home I feel so sorry for them because I only sleep there and then I leave and then they are sleeping when I'm coming back so but we trust the Lord that he has a plan and I also want to greet from our little church in Norway they wanted to be here amongst us so if the Lord teres you will see them soon and I also got a text message last Sunday from The Interpreter that we use in Russia I have never met him in person but we used him in our church for nearly two years to interpret our sermons from English to Russian for the Ukraine families that was together with us so he is sending sending greetings to you all so somebody from Russia are sending their greetings the vision that was a unknown word to me I had never heard it so I didn't understand it but two years ago I came to lasus for the first time and I was up up at the office and talking to all the brothers and the service started and most of of the men left the room and while brother Caleb was supposed to leave he stopped in the door and he said if you want if your brothers want to stay stay so we stayed so it was my pastor brother Morton and my brother Jerry Gonzalez Jerry Gonzalez and brother Ronnie Gonzalez Ronnie Gonzalez and we sat at the table and talked together and then suddenly brother Ronnie he asked me the question where do you see yourself in the vision and at that moment I didn't catch what he asked because it was an unknown word for me but the picture has been developed and now I have catched that word so from from that moment it was a turning point in my life it became personal to me so when you ask yourself the question where do you see yourself in the vision is there a lot of Visions around or is it One Vision because we are we are a lot of people and it seems that everybody has their own vision and I had my own vision I'm an Explorer I like to climb to the top of the mountains to the very top peak to get R myis and then jump out and that was the vision I had to have the feeling of flying down the mountain side exploring the nature that God had created but you know if that had been continued to be my vision I wouldn't be here today so I understood that I need to find my position in that Vision because brother Ronnie he talked about a vision that I didn't understand but I knew that I need to live according to that Vision I need to get in line with that Vision so I started to search and you know you can't place yourself somebody has to recognize you and place you so three months after the experience at the office I was placed in an office and I had no clue and when I got placed I had still no clue what that meant but I knew I saw that something was true about it I saw a life in the brother that placed me so I could have continued in the vision I had and if you for some reason have your own Vision it can seem that you are walking together with the bride and your pastor but at one point you will recognize I don't have the same vision it can take one year 10 years eight years we don't know but if you don't have the same vision at one point you will depart so like the woman woman with the blood issue we need to force our ourself into the vision it's PL placed a great commission for us to go out to all the world and preach the gospel to find that last soul and we need to force ourself into that Vision by force it doesn't come easy my walk was very hard my walk was very hard because I had to let go of a lot of things I even had to to leave a church my friends family it's hard but you know you have to force your way so when I came here the first time I was so skeptical you know brother Tommy Tommy he was standing here and he was singing and he had he had a nice time and he was shouting it was crazy to me I saw that man this is a crazy man and then his son brother Omar he ran up and he took the microphone and he was shouting even even higher and then the drums for me that was like a devil he was get going crazy and I was sitting there how can this be the Church of God but you know what I saw the love amongst the people and I knew something is is according to the word it is a love that are uniting the people so I told my dad my pastor about it and he said don't pay attention to the music listen to the preaching and then you'll see and now I'm so thankful for brother Tommy Tommy so you know why I was so skeptical because I used the wrong touch Stone I had a man's idea of how the music was supposed to be what instruments there was supposed to be in a church but then I took this Touchstone and I saw that this is according to the word because I saw the signs following and that was wonderful so now using this this book as my Touchstone I can look at the people and then I look at this and I know I'm at the right place so it doesn't matter if I'm in this church if I'm in po if I'm in Norway or anywhere if I can look at the people and I use this as my touch Stone I know I'm in the right place like we read in Joel 2:25 I will restore to you the years that the lus had eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the polymer form my great great Army which I sent among you and we know that this warm ate something ate something it took away the the the fruit the leaves the bark and it started to hit the roots but it it lays a promise here I will restore and what time are we living in is this the end time do we see the signs in the heavens we understand that so that means that this pertain to this age so when I came and I saw all of you I recognized something has been restored and I need it that is restored we live in the dispensation of the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God you believe that you really believe it make sure you really believe it that is Romans 8 verse 19 because when Satan comes we start to doubt is this the time for the manifestation of of the Sons and Daughters of God Satan is still tormenting me he's giving me a hard time it's so hard to live he took this away from me I had to do this and it seems that I'm falling in sin every day isn't this supposed to be the manifestation the dispensation dispensation for the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God and and I'm still falling how can that be young people we all go through it everybody the pastor the ministers all of us and Satan he's using his gun at us and he has more bullets than ever before and the more he shoots at you the more you know that you got something that he is trying to hide because he's scared because he knows that this is the dispensation of the manifestation you know something revealed Satan ain't scared of that because that doesn't put anything in action but when you have the manifestation then Satan is scared so when Satan shoots at you and when Satan did shoot at me we are standing in front of a choice we have a lot of bullets in our body but the prophet Joel he promised I will res rest so we have a promise we know that I have these bullets in my body but I have a promise so whenever you doubt read Joel because the promise is for you and me so we're standing in front of that choice what to do with these bullets should we let them stay in in our body or should we take them out and throw them under the carpet what do you think throw them under the carpet then you're rid of them isn't that a good thing isn't that a good thing the bullets has disappeared or should we take those bullets up to Heavenly places take them to the offices that is placed in the church the gifts that is placed in the church and receive our healing and then still you have the bullets you have you have now received your healing but then use these bullets to torment the devil back to show him that we have a promise in this day the bride tree will be restored so devil your poor toolbox you won't trick me and I will show these bullets to every man on this Earth so they know that this bullets pertains to you and that will help the bride but if we throw them under the carpet Satan will continue and he did that to me for many years I went to the wter got prayed for took the bullets under the carpet and I was so happy and when I turned my back to the altar he shot me in the back without me noticing but now we have the promise this is the day when the evening light is shining so I'm not sure when I started but we'll see so my title is a true witness I will restore when we were in po brother Mark Chavis Mark Chavez he was preaching on this being a true witness and that was tremendous for me a true witness I realized that I have been telling people about this Bible oh it's written in Joel that is it's supposed to be a promise and the prophet for this age he did this and this and this SEC secondhand Revelation I wasn't a true witness but you know when I was up in that office I'm a true witness of what happened there because that changed my life and the restoration of the Bright Tree started for me and you know why God allow allows Satan to shoot at us he placed him here for a reason because the only way for the manifestation of God's attribut is to let him shoot at us so we can be wed and show and manifest God's attributes so it isn't anything wrong with you when he shoots at you and Satan is actually doing a big mistake because he shoots at you and then you manifest God's attributes and you know he regrets so hard that he was shooting at you but he will still try maybe this time it will work and you know to his to to God's people it will never work because this is the dispensation of the man man estation of the Sons and Daughters of God this is the dispensation that we will torment the devil remember that promise it's nothing wrong with you when he shoots at you because he is shooting at you for a reason and I think he doesn't understand the reason could because it only brings the manifestation of go God's attributes the restoration of the Bride free so when you look around you around you you see your brother and sister then you know that that promise is true because it happens Malachi 45 and 6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet I will send you not somebody else I will send you the it's a specific message to you and that message needs to be manifest it's not enough that it it is revealed to you that you run around it's revealed to me I have it no it's not enough but when this can lay here and you can say Satan I know where your destiny is then it has become a life and you don't need to say anything to the people around you because they see the life in you so now you have received this Prophet the message a specific message for you and you know what why did I come to Las cruus I was reading behold I will send you Elijah the prophet oh that that is wonderful I don't need anything else I can just sit here I received the message it's so wonderful and I still can see the snowy mountains and I have my skis here and I have all possibilities no no I knew he also sent this message to somebody else and when I read this book and I have this book as my touch Stone I know that it is supposed to be a bride and I need to hear the message that the rest of the Bride has received because my part is not enough it's not enough for me in order for me to become a part of the Bride when I understood the word Vision I understood that this is a way that will will bring me somewhere so now I saw that this is really the day for the restoration but I still had a lot of questions because when I left the church I was in I started to study the message for real I'm working as a carpenter and I have my headphones and I'm able to listen to four or five sermons a day and I was listening and I was listening and I understood there is something more it must be something more this can't be it quote 183 from the third seal the bride the noia hasn't had a Revival [Music] yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it now it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to make her up again see yeah he will send it he promised it now watch okay okay I'll sit down I'm watching can I see it it's supposed to come I will sit here and I will listen to more sermon but I understood this can't be it because we're living in the end time you know I had received the message and I heard about the future but I was looking for the path That was supposed to take me to the future I was looking and I was thinking I just had to wait something is coming maybe one day at work when I have listened to seven sermons The Heavens will open uh Shining Light will and tell me the Revival is on so I was walking and walking and walking nothing happened but then when I was placed in the body of Christ I started to realize the restoration is on oh something is happening I see great man of God they lay their hands on the sick and they recover I see great man of God that Grant people their needs you're praying for a child you will receive it's a promise and I can see it in a people and I understand the Revival must be here now but still I can't see in the message because in the third seal it says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet and I ask people around and they say something great will happen we're waiting everybody's standing we're waiting for something but I could see something happening something happening to a people quot 83 from recognizing your day and its message why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that they will be an Awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride see by being a Christian they feel they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what is being done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come what is happened already happened right by you already happened right by you look to your neighbor it has happened right by you you see a people and it's happening it's the restoration of the brid it's an evening light shining the restoration of the gifts the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God it's no more time for revealing of the message it's the time for the manifestation of the message and it happens I'm a true witness and we see it we went to PO and the restoration of the Bride tree happened there you could see a people a tired people they have used the years to clean their dress but now they are restored you know why because of a vision we're [Music] placed right underneath the evening Light It Shines on it and great man of God has been placed there for us to realize that the Revival is going on and why is he using the word Awakening because it will end with this revival it won't continue but if you're looking for the word Revival in the message you will end up with a quote that the bride hasn't had a Revival yet but now we are awake so brother and sister the Revival is going it's happening everywhere great man of God brothers and sisters sons and daughters are the Revival you are the Revival I can tell you this morning this evening is there revival going on don't go out and look for it because it's happening right by you if you go out the door then it's not right by you then it's outside but it's happening right by you so believe it brother and sister and be a part of that Revival because that is the restoration the feminine feminine part joining with the masculine part and we will stand together with him in eternity am so I will end with this quote it's from the sermon influence quote 216 so should we should we find ourself in this Bible is that good enough or should we find ourself in the message as well because if we are the Revival we also are the message the manifestation of that message so let me read it for you what we have seen happen what I have seen happen should put every soul in action a true witness if you're doubting come along I'll show you the Revival is on it should make a church what is a church place your name your name say out loud it should make a amen Marcus brother Marcus that would make a Revival here in Phoenix Phoenix Las crues or Las cres that people brother Morton sister Elizabeth Elizabeth sister Susan Susana Lucas Lucas Louisa Louisa brother Marcus marus is flying in from Europe Norway to see what taken place they would say I would say there's a place in Arizona New Mexico called the Maricopa Valley Mia Valley a city called Phoenix Phoenix lases there is something broken out there and till the seven tunders of Revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the Bible is being manifest God bless you all Mar brother [Applause] Marcus oh that made me feel really app to the Lord God bless [Applause] you amen may God continue blessing your ministry I want to be to greet you this evening and just take these few minutes and if God gives me enough Grace that the precious word that that our brother brought can be fulfilled and we can continue with the manifestation I want to thank our pastor for the confidence and to God for giving me this opportunity maros if we open our Bible to the Book of Mark maros Mark chap chapter 9 verse 23 and as you find it oh she's not going to hide today is her birthday let's give her an Applause sister Eliza God bless you and may God consider the desire of your heart it's a it's a pleasure in me the Lord you have a beautiful mother you have a beautiful grandmother and and a marvelous sister and a marvelous pastor and a marvelous [Applause] congregation let us open up the word in Mark maros Mar Mark 9 9:23 and if you can stand we're going to read two scriptures Jesus said unto him if thou C believe all things are possible to him that believeth let us turn to Mark 7 verse 25 the scripture says Mark 7:25 for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet let us read the next verse 26 the woman was a Greek a serap phenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter let us pray Lord we thank you take control we surrender ourselves to your presence we give you all honor and Glory you may be seated during this week I I told the Lord I said Lord put me to a side for these five minutes that is the desire of my heart if you see brother Diego brother Ronnie I I failed because my prayer brother is that I I I not stand here because I have nothing good to offer you and even though God made me a minister a preacher it is my duty it is my responsibility to have something to be able to offer because if I don't have anything to to offer and then I'm going to go then I I I go to the Fountain I go to the Fountain brother because he is the unexhausted Fountain and when he ministers to me then I can stand before you and to minister to the people that is the duty that every preacher every Minister can be able to take the word and not only speak it but to live it and to preach it if we if we are not capable to manifest that what we speak then don't come behind this P go to the Cross find yourself with him and everyone is going to say oh that wasn't the brother that was God the scripture says that a man came looking for Jesus because his disciples weren't able to cast out a demon now this man now watch this man he wasn't just any man he was a Jew he was a man that was under the promise he was a man that obeyed the law a man that was waiting for the presence of the Messiah now here is the Messiah Jesus God the fullness of God the Messiah is speaking to this man watch the words he says he he tells the father to him that believeth if you can believe to him that believeth all things are possible Jesus isn't saying for me all things are possible because for God there is nothing impossible he is telling him if thou can't believe it's not in me it's on you for you to believe for him that believeth all are possible so then now I'm going to take that promise now I'm going to take it out of context and I'm going to put it in another place a many so that you can understand and catch the Revelation the Bible says that there was a woman a cenan a Greek a woman that she did not have the the the the promise the right to the promise that woman that according to the law she was a curse she was evil because she oby the law evil to him that doesn't obey the law a woman that knew nothing about the Messiah a woman that according to the Jew that she was a dog that's what the Bible says now this woman we've heard it many times but I want you to catch it catch the inspiration that God has for you this evening now this woman comes and she be she she comes to Jesus she he says heal my daughter Jesus now Jesus he ignores her like if I like if I was there until until this woman when this woman she doesn't look to the answer of Jesus the Bible says that this woman she she falls out his she humbles herself she humbles in the feet of Jesus the Bible says that he who humbles himself shall be exalted but even though even though she is humble Jesus ignores her for the second time for the second time Jesus because the Bible says I I came to obey the law to fulfill the law and by the law she did not have the right to him when Jesus ignores her she says again Lord my daughter is tormented now now here is Jesus no no oh forgive me sister come now now catch this right there now here is a serici woman now here is Jesus now watch the response of Jesus he says he says woman it's not correct that the father takes the bread that pertains to the children the bread that pertains to the children to to give it to give it to the dogs Jesus ignores her for the second time and then he turns his back now listen to her response Lord that is true me I don't have the rights to the bread because I am a dog but even though although even though Jesus tells her that that she is not worthy that it's not right Jesus is telling her it's not your time yet woman wait it's not your time yet but when she now now watch her answer Lord that that that's correct that's true I don't want the bread but but even the dog even the dogs no no watch the answer they eat under the table but us the dogs we're not on the scene we are under the table but they eat the crumbs they eat the crumbs that that the sons that they fall the table this woman she didn't take the bread she took a crumb and with a crumb that you receive their healing by oh she didn't take the bread she only took a crumb to receive her healing oh woman oh this woman oh she she overcame God she prevailed against God oh Jesus stayed without words he said woman I I didn't give it to you but according to your faith not me not my faith your faith your faith now here is a man here's the Jew with a sick son here is Jesus trying to give him the person that that deserves the one that is re worthy to receive the bread oh but he doesn't know how to eat it see if you can believe if you can believe to him that believeth all things are possible now what bread was he talking about Jesus said I am the bread that Cometh From Heaven and you can eat if you can believe and then then I can do it now Church you you aren't dog you and I we are children of God God God gives you the bread God gives you the bread so that you and I so that we can be filled not just a the want the crumb this is this is the bread Brothers the message of the hour the M of the hour is a bread this bread in Africa in Africa oh brother oh brother not even the crumbs but here in the church oh we beg the people please eat some bread please eat some bread but many times the bread goes bad because we ignore him but you will be guilty for getting the bread that has been given to the sons you're going to be responsible to God because it is our responsibility our duty to to stand on the word manifest the word it's my duty to bring the presence of God it's your duty to give to give like those aition woman brother Diego I'm sick I have a problem that's an embarrassment why are you sick if your kids and children are in the world it's it's an embarrassment it's an embarrassment for you because there because there is of bread there is enough there is enough of God to cast out the devil to cast out the hell if you can believe I believe Brothers I believe but can you believe so then if you can believe all things are possible not for me but to him that believeth I want to tell you something the musicians can come let me tell you what is coming these unclean spirits that are coming out being cast out oh a Sunday was a a service of Liberation oh hallelujah hallelujah but let me tell you something but what happened in the spiritual the holy spirit this morning he takes me to a place to that place that Jesus calls when the unclean Spirit comes out it goes to dry places I was walking in this place oh what a horrible ugly place I thought I was walking in through Mars and and I began to see the the the the demons that came out of the people over here they were over here in this place calling their friends and and I saw them brothers how that they would call their comrades and seven of them gathered I I counted them and they began to say so let's get together let's band together they they got together in unity to to cause harm to cause harm to destroy to destroy your life to destroy your life so then what is your responsibility you have to fill yourself with God you have to read the Bible you have to pray brother you're offending me no no no you have to pray because those seven spirits that I saw they're going to come in your condition is going to be worse I saw it brother I saw those spirits but let me tell you that God he also has a Ministry that has United that has got together to bring the presence of God the children of God I ask the question if thou can't believe you that are there you that are sick you that are struggling if you can believe this word I ask you the question if you can believe to him that believeth all things are possible here's the presence of God is here I ask the question is there somebody here that maybe wants to be healed is there somebody here that maybe wants to be saved but there is enough power here to continue saving to continue healing because we don't need we don't need more power we need Faith this Revelation produces [Music] faith I ask the question if you are sick and and you leave the same that's on you that's on you because because God did everything he did for you and if you don't leave healed and if you don't leave a liberated forgive me but because that's because that's for because you don't have because you don't have to C because you don't have the the The Valor take this bread brother bread take this bread and to eat it I'm just waiting if you can believe to him that believes all things are possible I'm going to ask you and don't lie to me re uh respond with all of your heart if you believe that God that that spoke
