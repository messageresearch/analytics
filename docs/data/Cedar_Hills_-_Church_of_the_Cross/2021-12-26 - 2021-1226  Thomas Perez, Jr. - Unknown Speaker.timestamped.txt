[1:03:26] we we we trust in the lord we've we've
[1:03:29] had many great things happen to us this
[1:03:31] year
[1:03:36] we
[1:03:36] uh
[1:03:38] many great events have happened
[1:03:43] and we this is the last sunday of 2021
[1:03:52] this next year we we we
[1:03:55] we come with we should come with fresh
[1:03:57] vision
[1:04:04] and we we've already our pastor has
[1:04:06] already said that this would be the
[1:04:08] capstone this would be love a baptism
[1:04:25] to to to to do away with anything that
[1:04:28] we we know of no
[1:04:31] yes
[1:04:32] but this year is just about already gone
[1:04:37] we pray that that our problems
[1:04:42] our complexes are hang-ups
[1:04:46] little foxes that spoil the vine
[1:04:51] the things that so
[1:05:46] but i believe that jesus christ is the
[1:05:48] same yesterday today and forever
[1:05:53] and i believe that his words do matter
[1:05:56] today
[1:06:02] my wife she she she
[1:06:05] she came to uh to a a new crossroads
[1:06:08] this year
[1:06:12] and she's as beautiful and lovely as
[1:06:14] ever before
[1:06:56] and we've had great steps that we have
[1:06:58] gone
[1:07:27] my revelation hasn't changed
[1:07:31] now i do believe that in revelation
[1:07:34] but i believe that revelation is
[1:07:36] progressive
[1:07:39] i believe that there is a firm
[1:07:41] foundation upon revelation
[1:07:45] but i believe that that revelation
[1:07:47] should carry you to newness
[1:07:51] from faith to faith
[1:07:54] from glory
[1:08:05] this is the greatest thing that i
[1:08:08] understand about the scripture
[1:08:12] that god almighty left his throne
[1:08:16] i still after all these years of
[1:08:18] preaching
[1:08:21] can never get past that
[1:08:46] that we can have very great grasp of the
[1:08:50] message of the
[1:10:00] that is the first action of love
[1:10:03] we can say that god is many things
[1:10:06] as much as
[1:10:08] many adjectives
[1:10:11] are consuming fires
[1:10:13] these many of these
[1:10:25] and that is one characteristic that you
[1:10:28] can always
[1:10:42] i'm not talking
[1:10:55] nobody wants to love them
[1:11:12] it seems like there's been a disconnect
[1:11:16] connection between god and man
[1:11:19] but jesus brother branham says
[1:11:22] jesus could touch the holy god
[1:11:51] how many were happy with 2021
[1:11:56] 2021 was good
[1:11:59] how many are going to be happier in
[1:12:01] 2022.
[1:12:05] you haven't been there yet
[1:12:08] you know the bible tells us that when
[1:12:11] joshua
[1:12:13] commands the people
[1:12:17] when they were going to cross the uh the
[1:12:20] jordan but even
[1:12:47] another door opens
[1:12:50] and it can bring a lot of promise along
[1:12:56] the first step towards getting somewhere
[1:13:01] is to decide you're not going to stay
[1:13:04] where you are
[1:13:11] can i say it again
[1:13:13] the first step
[1:13:16] for getting somewhere
[1:13:19] is to decide you're not going to stay
[1:13:23] where you are
[1:13:27] now
[1:13:28] if i
[1:13:30] struggle
[1:13:58] because
[1:14:04] if we could stay in 2021 for the next
[1:14:07] 100 years everybody would be happy
[1:14:40] it'll cause you to love your enemy
[1:14:44] you're not my enemy
[1:14:46] cause you to love those that
[1:14:48] despitefully used you
[1:14:52] it'll cause you to speak of those that
[1:14:55] persecute you
[1:14:59] and to speak of them well
[1:15:02] it's a new season
[1:15:05] it's a new challenge
[1:15:07] it's a new time
[1:15:22] what
[1:15:34] but it'll put you in the track that
[1:16:04] there will come a time
[1:16:06] when you believe everything is finished
[1:16:11] that will be the beginning
[1:16:16] henry ford said
[1:16:18] this failure
[1:16:22] is the opportunity is the opportunity to
[1:16:25] begin again
[1:16:28] more intelligently
[1:16:36] do you know that that the great sam
[1:16:38] walton which is the founder of
[1:16:41] of uh
[1:16:42] walmart and grandstand welcome to
[1:16:44] california club a walmart sam's club
[1:16:47] they said he went bankrupt i don't know
[1:16:49] three four times
[1:16:53] but he never gave up
[1:16:56] now they're the richest family in
[1:16:57] america
[1:17:00] if
[1:17:09] that when you come to the basis of the
[1:17:11] scripture
[1:17:14] an understanding
[1:17:41] to go and hang around people that might
[1:17:43] not like you
[1:17:47] it might cause you to love somebody
[1:17:51] that you might not like
[1:17:54] but one thing it will cause you to do
[1:18:08] this is a new dispensation
[1:18:14] and habakkuk tells us
[1:18:17] as we know
[1:18:20] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:18:23] time
[1:18:52] in six months we are going to step on
[1:18:54] the shores of norway for the first time
[1:18:57] in statesmen
[1:19:02] this year by the help of almighty god
[1:20:01] to choose me just forget me i cannot go
[1:20:04] back in time and say why did you choose
[1:20:07] me
[1:20:10] by this time
[1:20:12] the vision has already provided the
[1:20:15] provision
[1:20:28] when you come to the basis and i i need
[1:20:30] to
[1:20:43] things don't happen just to happen
[1:20:58] there was any foundation
[1:21:03] now
[1:21:03] those itself it it causes you when when
[1:21:07] you start understanding the scripture
[1:21:37] every place
[1:21:44] the commission is the same here
[1:21:48] as it is
[1:21:50] here
[1:21:52] every place
[1:21:55] have you ever walked where you're
[1:21:56] supposed to be
[1:22:00] have you ever walked your territory of
[1:22:02] where you're supposed to be
[1:22:05] every place
[1:22:07] that the soul of your
[1:22:21] when you look
[1:22:23] to the promise of god
[1:22:27] it puts you in your future
[1:22:31] when you walk into it
[1:22:34] is the revelation
[1:23:03] you have to have good seed time
[1:23:08] and i'll tell you in this church
[1:23:11] we had good seed time
[1:23:15] we had a man that planted a lot of seeds
[1:23:42] god speaks to moses right before the
[1:23:45] passover
[1:23:52] shall be unto you the beginning of
[1:23:54] months foster that principle
[1:23:57] it shall be the first month of the year
[1:24:00] to you but
[1:24:21] i don't want to be the same person in
[1:24:23] 2022 that i wasn't twenty-one
[1:24:36] god in his rich mercy has given us great
[1:24:40] things
[1:24:56] but for sure it'll bring you to another
[1:24:59] condition
[1:25:02] have not i
[1:25:04] commanded thee
[1:25:07] be of good courage this is the wind
[1:25:09] balloon if i can tell you this this this
[1:25:12] morning
[1:25:15] we are cells nosotros mismo are
[1:25:18] encountering great challenges estamos
[1:25:21] encontrandos en controndo grandes retos
[1:25:24] again
[1:25:25] in june we will step into norway for the
[1:25:28] first time
[1:25:32] but we won't be the first to stand in
[1:25:34] norway
[1:25:37] norway will be the second one the third
[1:25:40] however in order we come in
[1:25:44] but let me tell you who's already there
[1:25:49] jesus christ who is the same yesterday
[1:25:51] today and forever
[1:25:55] it's already in your tomorrow
[1:25:59] and as he is today
[1:26:02] he'll wait for you tomorrow
[1:26:04] and he is in 2021 thomas
[1:26:33] and it continues
[1:26:35] the cycle
[1:26:39] but when we come here
[1:26:42] under
[1:26:44] what god wants us to do today
[1:27:02] covers
[1:27:13] sometimes our our church or maybe our
[1:27:16] minds are divided
[1:27:30] and
[1:27:43] and maybe
[1:27:45] he he knows nothing of the world
[1:27:50] but the world is inside of him
[1:27:54] then you get another person
[1:27:57] and maybe has become had gone into the
[1:28:00] world and done all kinds of mess
[1:28:06] how do you bring these two people into a
[1:28:09] reconciliation with god
[1:28:23] does this person deserve more love than
[1:28:25] this
[1:28:40] he
[1:29:08] brings the forgiven
[1:29:09] [Applause]
[1:29:50] covering
[1:30:02] it's just to say brother it's just i i
[1:30:05] me and you are the only ones that know
[1:30:07] her
[1:30:09] so i i'm going to cover you
[1:30:12] but you you better hope that this
[1:30:14] brother never uncovers
[1:30:17] because it is
[1:30:46] you
[1:31:00] brings us then into a unity
[1:31:07] you know when you hear brother branham
[1:31:08] say
[1:31:09] yesterday
[1:31:10] god called me to unite the body of
[1:31:12] christ yesterday
[1:31:16] i was wondering
[1:31:19] if we belong in that message see
[1:31:22] those potentials didn't throw this
[1:31:23] demonstrated
[1:31:25] somebody told me a while ago
[1:31:28] there's a difference between being a
[1:31:30] follower
[1:31:33] and being a believer
[1:31:37] i'm not just a follower
[1:31:40] i am a believer yes i don't just follow
[1:31:45] the signs follow me
[1:31:48] i am the message of brother branham
[1:31:53] so the unity and those
[1:31:58] that's the hardest thing to do
[1:32:01] the passenger will tell you
[1:32:03] pastor will tell him
[1:32:05] he'll tell you how do you bring these
[1:32:07] two factions together
[1:32:51] the same amount of denominations in the
[1:32:53] pentecostals
[1:32:59] you're coming to the message
[1:33:02] there is everybody's got a better better
[1:33:04] way to do things
[1:34:29] this is the challenge
[1:34:55] it is for brethren to dwell in unity
[1:35:12] when
[1:35:24] is
[1:35:37] we get happy because we got a tingle in
[1:35:39] our back uh
[1:36:05] it
[1:36:10] but it is like the precious ointment
[1:36:16] upon the head
[1:36:19] here let me let me tell you how much you
[1:36:20] have to get what is
[1:36:32] how much oil was that question
[1:36:49] that's not going to bring you to the
[1:36:50] challenge of the new day
[1:36:53] it is like the anointing oil
[1:36:58] that was on his head get this induced in
[1:37:00] other words they kept on pouring it i
[1:37:03] used to get on the remainder
[1:37:18] that's what gives you possession
[1:37:22] it's not just your foot
[1:37:25] it's the anointing
[1:37:28] that is on the right foot
[1:38:00] whatever he did
[1:38:02] wherever he walked
[1:38:05] holiness
[1:38:07] to the lord
[1:38:08] holiness
[1:38:10] now
[1:38:12] we read a little bit
[1:38:28] can't oh no no no why
[1:38:31] because the other foot hasn't been
[1:38:33] anointed
[1:38:36] and the other eye hasn't been
[1:38:39] and the other ear hasn't been there
[1:38:42] but when the
[1:38:54] is
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:24] and i got my own ideas how do i think of
[1:39:26] these properties
[1:39:29] and i got my own way to go
[1:39:32] but as the due of hermann
[1:39:37] and as the do that descended upon the
[1:39:40] mountains of zion
[1:39:44] why would he call the
[1:39:46] zion
[1:39:49] because zion was the gathering place
[1:40:06] okay i gotta do it again
[1:40:08] every time all of this the israelis
[1:40:12] talked about gathering
[1:40:16] getting together
[1:40:18] talked about zion
[1:40:34] what is it that is coming
[1:40:37] into our time
[1:40:43] the bible speaks to us about
[1:40:45] dispensations
[1:41:02] in which a particular
[1:41:16] that
[1:41:18] what does god want to happen in your
[1:41:20] life in 2022
[1:41:25] the bible talks about
[1:41:28] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:41:44] united
[1:41:46] union
[1:41:53] now before we can be united in christ
[1:41:58] he's got to unite our body spirit and
[1:42:01] soul
[1:42:05] because
[1:42:07] our body our soul and our spirit on
[1:42:10] sunday morning says hallelujah
[1:42:26] the
[1:43:09] comes
[1:43:10] and each one gets a little harder
[1:43:16] he comes to the lion
[1:43:19] defeats the lion
[1:43:21] from the lion he comes to the bear alley
[1:43:25] from the bear he comes to the giant
[1:43:30] but if he would have ran away from the
[1:43:33] lion
[1:43:36] he would have never
[1:44:46] bastard
[1:44:59] the giant
[1:45:14] and when he comes
[1:45:17] did he have anything
[1:45:20] did he have a robe
[1:45:22] not yet
[1:45:24] but he was already being clothed within
[1:45:26] without and upon
[1:46:13] and they were speaking about this and
[1:46:14] they said
[1:46:16] don't listen to brother branham no
[1:46:18] economic because his tapes will confuse
[1:46:21] you
[1:46:23] he said but a friend of mine
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:56] but the challenge fell upon a man's ears
[1:47:00] that had experience
[1:47:05] he was not 56 years old nothing is in
[1:47:07] context
[1:47:08] he was 15 years old
[1:47:13] but the lion and the bear leon
[1:47:16] had already looked inside of a 15 year
[1:47:18] old boy
[1:47:47] when he heard the challenge
[1:47:51] bring a guy over here
[1:47:55] bring one guy and i'll feed him to the
[1:47:57] birds of the air
[1:48:01] but in his
[1:48:02] time he said it don't happen today
[1:48:07] because it's my time
[1:48:09] and i'd say this as the church of the
[1:48:11] living god
[1:48:13] they don't happen in your time
[1:48:16] it don't happen
[1:48:56] now
[1:48:59] how then can it be
[1:49:02] and touches come up what he said
[1:49:03] brother branham preaches and you know
[1:49:05] this and i gotta i gotta say it's
[1:49:07] the second song
[1:49:08] real quick but he preaches one two three
[1:49:10] four five six
[1:49:26] and he says now this is the last age
[1:49:34] now
[1:49:37] it's the rights of the people
[1:49:40] i got
[1:49:48] you have a right legal right in new
[1:49:50] mexico to go and smoke marijuana if you
[1:49:52] wanted to know
[1:50:08] this
[1:50:27] he comes
[1:50:30] here's the attorney now
[1:50:33] in the church age and like that
[1:50:35] not in the laodicean churches
[1:50:39] but in the last church age
[1:50:42] in order in other words
[1:50:45] if there are some of you thinking that
[1:50:46] you're going to be the eighth
[1:50:49] especially
[1:50:55] let me open this this open door for you
[1:50:57] and let you know that this urge is
[1:50:59] already open
[1:51:04] now
[1:51:15] i wonder how many of us in that room
[1:51:33] setting back their little dust bonnet
[1:51:35] unlike the country woman wear there
[1:51:44] and here's my bible as a servant of god
[1:52:12] raise your hands i know your belief
[1:52:27] she wasn't there when the squirrel came
[1:52:30] into existence
[1:52:36] but she was there when he spoke
[1:52:42] and when he spoke it
[1:52:45] it took her back to the occasion that it
[1:52:48] happened
[1:52:52] and she steps into the vision
[1:52:56] and when she
[1:53:08] i watched
[1:53:12] my papa said this
[1:53:14] don't forget africa
[1:53:17] they have a great part to do with the
[1:53:19] resurrection
[1:53:23] i did not have that vision
[1:53:27] no i didn't have that baby
[1:53:29] god didn't give me that vision
[1:53:32] of me but as he spoken
[1:53:35] we stepped into the vision and trauma
[1:54:13] no because hope can't even can't even
[1:54:15] you can't even place it with with faith
[1:54:20] it's just like an enemy of faith
[1:54:25] but what brings faith gets tailored
[1:54:28] to today
[1:54:30] loved us in the moral of us
[1:54:33] when when
[1:54:34] when
[1:54:35] when when when nothing else could help
[1:54:38] but my mother must be on you that i'm
[1:54:40] going to tell you again when nothing
[1:54:42] else could help
[1:54:44] uplift
[1:54:50] so brother branham hey
[1:54:54] the spoken word of god
[1:54:57] he says where do you want those
[1:54:58] squirrels
[1:55:02] right there right there right there
[1:55:03] right there
[1:55:07] and that didn't happen one time
[1:55:12] it happened six times how concealed
[1:55:16] but they weren't visions
[1:55:18] but she's got to go back to the
[1:55:20] happening
[1:55:23] she goes back to the happening
[1:55:27] dispensation
[1:55:30] that was for her
[1:55:43] you know
[1:55:44] you know
[1:55:44] you know when when you say
[1:55:46] when people say did did the february
[1:55:49] 28th 1963 happen
[1:55:54] i say yes sir
[1:55:57] i was there yesterday
[1:56:11] yes
[1:56:19] you tell me did it happen physically
[1:57:22] if
[1:57:51] to you it's up to you
[1:57:56] it's up to you yes australis
[1:58:02] can i say this again
[1:58:30] you ask it and thus saith the lord i'll
[1:58:32] speak it behind you and you have it
[1:58:41] she said
[1:58:45] the salvation of my two boys
[1:58:53] and those two little modern teenage
[1:58:56] nickel fritz boys
[1:59:11] and scream the blessings of god
[1:59:29] yo nunca in all my life and ptolemy had
[1:59:32] felt such anointing
[1:59:36] the first time it was ever performed on
[1:59:39] a human being
[2:00:20] i believe that the church of the living
[2:00:22] god
[2:00:50] now
[2:00:56] god's called us to go around the world
[2:01:05] how
[2:01:06] grandma
[2:01:34] you haven't
[2:01:48] it's gonna
[2:02:00] it's not if you think i'm right and
[2:02:01] you're wrong
[2:02:16] upon the clothing
[2:02:29] but he's calling you into a new
[2:02:30] dispensary
[2:02:41] that's going to shake the whole world
[2:02:52] it's been since the days of jesus of
[2:02:54] nazareth to a human being
[2:03:24] don't let nobody tell you
[2:03:40] no
