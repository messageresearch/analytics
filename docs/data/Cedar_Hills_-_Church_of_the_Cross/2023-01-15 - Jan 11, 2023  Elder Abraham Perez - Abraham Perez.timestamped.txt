[1:01:37] if you want to know him
[1:01:41] he never pointed you to a church
[1:01:46] or anywhere else to know him
[1:01:50] but he pointed you to the cross
[1:01:55] and there is
[1:01:57] self-crucifixion yes as crucifixion
[1:02:00] to yourself
[1:02:02] that's why a man must be born again
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:30] Del Vino brother random says
[1:02:34] that Israel was God's fine
[1:02:39] and he came to them
[1:02:42] he came to his own Dino a loss and it
[1:02:46] was his song that crucified
[1:02:51] the churches rejected the fruit of the
[1:02:54] vines
[1:02:56] and when Jesus Took to the Lord's supper
[1:02:59] with his disciples
[1:03:02] before his crucifixion
[1:03:11] this is the blood of the new
[1:03:15] testamento as of as you drink
[1:03:21] the Lord's death till he comes
[1:03:26] and many churches won't take regular
[1:03:30] wine
[1:03:32] Vino regular
[1:03:34] because that it was an alcoholic okay
[1:03:37] foreign
[1:04:00] and another reason
[1:04:02] is when wild ages
[1:04:07] it gets better and stronger
[1:04:11] yes
[1:04:19] in the blood of Jesus Christ gets
[1:04:22] sweeter and better as the years
[1:04:35] do you know that when you take communion
[1:04:41] it has Divine Healing Divina
[1:04:47] when the Israelites in time took the
[1:04:50] communion
[1:04:54] in March for 40 years
[1:04:58] and when they got out of the Wilderness
[1:05:02] there was nobody people or sick amongst
[1:05:09] and there were over two million of them
[1:05:13] there is power of healing in the
[1:05:17] communion
[1:05:19] Saint John 19 30.
[1:05:26] when Jesus therefore had received the
[1:05:29] vinegar he said it is finished and he
[1:05:34] bowed his head and gave up the ghosts
[1:05:48] can you truthfully
[1:05:53] say it is finished if the Lord would
[1:05:57] come this is
[1:06:06] and Jesus cried with a loud voice Jesus
[1:06:10] and when he cried
[1:06:13] it thundered
[1:06:21] so loud
[1:06:34] we're gonna hit that in a little while
[1:06:38] but remember he said it is finished
[1:06:42] Genesis 2 1.
[1:06:47] thus the heavens and the Earth were
[1:06:50] finished and all the hosts of them
[1:06:58] and on the seventh day God ended his
[1:07:01] work which he had made and he rested on
[1:07:05] the seventh day for all his work which
[1:07:08] he had made
[1:07:17] and God bless the seventh day and
[1:07:20] Sanctified because that he need he had
[1:07:22] rested from all his work which God
[1:07:26] created and
[1:07:29] Madea is
[1:07:38] are you resting
[1:07:42] can you say
[1:07:45] what the Lord said that when he finished
[1:07:48] in six days his work he rested on the
[1:07:52] seventh president
[1:07:59] if you're born again
[1:08:04] and sealed with the Holy Spirit
[1:08:08] are you supposed to be resting
[1:08:13] and we in the seventh Church
[1:08:19] you should be resting
[1:08:22] Reposado you say no you know because you
[1:08:27] know we still gotta spread the word and
[1:08:29] our brothers go on missionary trips
[1:08:37] but look at I'm not gonna go into that
[1:08:41] you know but you know you gotta enter
[1:08:44] into the seventh Genesis
[1:08:49] and Jesus was the lord of the service is
[1:08:52] a Jesus
[1:08:54] you are not resting from doing the works
[1:08:58] of the Lord no studies
[1:09:01] you are resting because you don't do
[1:09:08] this you are not in the you live in this
[1:09:12] world but you are not of this is
[1:09:30] he Sanctified the seven days yes
[1:09:36] but his rest was interrupted by Satan
[1:09:40] you know so this cancer foreign
[1:10:12] did not land on the garden
[1:10:15] he landed
[1:10:18] then the only reason he got into the
[1:10:21] garden of it
[1:10:23] because if lowered down the bar and let
[1:10:27] him
[1:10:32] means that he got more jealous
[1:10:37] in heaven he was jealous of Michael
[1:10:41] when he came down
[1:10:43] he found out as in control there was
[1:10:47] already a God here on Earth
[1:10:56] secondary and he got more jealous
[1:11:00] until he won the victory over Adam and
[1:11:03] Eve
[1:11:05] and they lost their inheritance
[1:11:10] same does not
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:41] so you see why God could not receive the
[1:11:45] offering of of Cain
[1:11:50] because he gave him enough
[1:11:58] in those days
[1:12:00] they were so far advanced in technology
[1:12:04] they could tell time by the stars
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:09] but the Zodiac was the first Bible
[1:12:14] it was God above us sovereign
[1:12:25] but God seemed that man stopped looking
[1:12:28] up
[1:12:32] and then rely on God
[1:12:35] but under achievements through their
[1:12:38] science
[1:12:42] he needed another Bible
[1:12:47] so what kind of Bible did he gets okay
[1:12:55] you know when if
[1:12:57] committed what she did
[1:13:00] so then the heavens were close
[1:13:07] so if the heavens were closed
[1:13:10] because in those times they used to tell
[1:13:13] time by the Stars
[1:13:17] so if the heavens were closed
[1:13:22] how come the Wise Men followed the Stars
[1:13:28] they were the only ones that could tell
[1:13:31] time by the stars
[1:13:33] is
[1:13:36] in the heavens close to the
[1:13:38] denominations
[1:13:42] how can we hear tell time by the Stars
[1:13:49] oh listen the Prophet The Seven Stars
[1:13:58] hallelujah hallelujah it wasn't close to
[1:14:01] them
[1:14:04] John was on the Isle of Palms
[1:14:09] among the snakes and the Scorpions
[1:14:13] the Lord says
[1:14:16] I cannot talk to you down during those
[1:14:18] denominations
[1:14:22] and the heaven was open
[1:14:27] doors
[1:14:38] isn't the same thing that happened to
[1:14:41] our Prophet is
[1:14:49] here Philadelphia
[1:14:58] foreign
[1:15:39] you're gonna have to wait three and a
[1:15:42] half
[1:15:42] minutes
[1:15:52] of the rain from the clouds
[1:15:57] they made this wine that you like to
[1:16:00] come here to church
[1:16:04] you've got wine from the water from the
[1:16:07] clouds
[1:16:11] but he needed another Bible
[1:16:17] and he said
[1:16:19] Enoch Enoch come up come up here
[1:16:23] the same thing he told to John no means
[1:16:28] and the heavens opened
[1:16:33] and look
[1:16:36] he walked
[1:16:38] with God
[1:16:42] and God gave him the plans
[1:16:46] to make the second Bible
[1:16:51] you know what the Bible was called
[1:16:54] foreign
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:17:18] amen amen
[1:17:20] but then Peron tonsils
[1:17:23] he needed another Bible
[1:17:28] where the Bible came he called
[1:17:30] bibliadino
[1:17:32] he can say
[1:17:36] They Crucified him electricity Caron
[1:17:41] and his period moved upon the waters
[1:17:45] it's respiratory
[1:17:49] he was looking for a place to rest yes
[1:17:54] to finish the seventh day para terminal
[1:17:58] to indwell God in us
[1:18:03] because in the last days
[1:18:07] the only Bible many will ever read
[1:18:14] you know what is the only Bible they
[1:18:17] will read
[1:18:19] it's you yes
[1:18:22] that's the only Bible they will read
[1:18:27] and the word says we are in the case of
[1:18:31] red of every word
[1:18:34] amen amen
[1:18:37] that's why the spirit of the Lord moved
[1:18:40] upon the world
[1:18:43] looking for a place
[1:18:49] and when Jesus cried with the loud voice
[1:18:54] it was the voice of Thunder
[1:18:58] ah does the Thunder have a voice
[1:19:05] he says the voice like a voiceover
[1:19:09] because when it thundered
[1:19:12] when he was on the cross on the list and
[1:19:15] cried with the Lord's voice
[1:19:22] he'd opened the grace
[1:19:28] but when the Grays were opened
[1:19:32] the only ones that I walked
[1:19:36] the Old Testament saying Los Santos the
[1:19:40] Antigo testamento how come the other
[1:19:42] Graves
[1:19:46] thank you
[1:19:47] because when he cried the first time on
[1:19:49] the cross
[1:19:50] in La Cruz
[1:19:57] oh he was calling for Elijah foreign
[1:20:11] is
[1:20:21] it how come you understood
[1:20:28] you gotta put the brakes I'll be
[1:20:30] pitching down there with all those
[1:20:32] things
[1:20:40] now
[1:20:45] gracias thank you
[1:20:48] good to have people they know what
[1:20:50] they're doing
[1:20:55] we don't like it look Mike good it's a
[1:20:57] good thing that I couldn't got good
[1:20:59] insurance
[1:21:01] if I go over the cliffs
[1:21:05] I God Blessed Assurance amen
[1:21:12] foreign
[1:22:00] and in Genesis is
[1:22:13] when he said let there be light on the
[1:22:16] first seal in Genesis
[1:22:20] it's separated the darkness
[1:22:25] and when you heard the seals
[1:22:30] you read the first sale
[1:22:34] and this became a new Bible
[1:22:38] it separated you from the darkness
[1:22:48] Hallelujah
[1:22:58] is separate the light from the darkness
[1:23:02] it used to be in Genesis
[1:23:06] there are missed water the ground
[1:23:11] the Mist was an Earthly cloud
[1:23:17] and the old world
[1:23:24] and it also closed with the thundermans
[1:23:29] and when the animals heard the voice of
[1:23:33] The
[1:23:34] Thundermans
[1:23:36] they had never heard of thunder
[1:23:41] so how could the animals understand and
[1:23:44] go into the yard
[1:23:47] you have never heard of Thunder
[1:23:51] the denomination
[1:23:58] that's not a thunder that's an awesome
[1:24:00] trainer
[1:24:03] this color lady is this color she told
[1:24:07] her husband
[1:24:09] how come you shout so much behind when
[1:24:12] you preach in church
[1:24:17] well he said if I don't have lightning I
[1:24:21] want to have thunder
[1:24:25] correct
[1:24:33] amen amen so then the animals heard the
[1:24:36] Thunder Los Angeles
[1:24:37] you had never heard thunder
[1:24:41] but you're here
[1:24:47] the animals animals they marched into
[1:24:50] the yard
[1:24:52] and do you know that right now it is
[1:24:56] thundering is
[1:24:59] every time you come to church it's
[1:25:02] thundering is
[1:25:08] remember the Thunder has a voice
[1:25:15] Genesis 9 13. and he says
[1:25:20] I do set my bow in the cloud and it
[1:25:23] shall be for a token of a covenant
[1:25:26] between me and the Earth
[1:25:36] and it shall come to pass when I bring a
[1:25:38] cloud over the Earth that the bow shall
[1:25:41] be seen in the clouds
[1:25:53] foreign
[1:25:58] was between god well not between God and
[1:26:01] Adam and Company
[1:26:05] the Covenant was between God and the
[1:26:08] Earth
[1:26:10] that's what it says and when I see a
[1:26:13] cloud over the Earth
[1:26:17] well we all every day we see a bunch of
[1:26:20] clouds
[1:26:22] but notice not just any clothes
[1:26:28] where was this Cloud coming from you
[1:26:31] don't have any eyes it had to be a bow
[1:26:35] on the clouds
[1:26:39] for 2 000 years
[1:26:42] there was no rain
[1:26:46] yeah
[1:26:49] I asked the question
[1:26:52] what comes first
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:27:05] talk to me you intelligent kids welcome
[1:27:08] first meetings
[1:27:12] all your searches look at yourself
[1:27:14] parents are real smart
[1:27:17] what comes first
[1:27:21] you said the rain instead James is he
[1:27:24] correct all right
[1:27:29] well don't just say go ahead tell me
[1:27:33] the world comes first huh
[1:27:37] lightning
[1:27:42] oh you look cool you're afraid that I'm
[1:27:44] gonna ask you one of your kids
[1:27:47] I don't know what comes first huh
[1:27:51] lightning I wonder what kind of school
[1:27:55] these kids go to yes
[1:28:02] there is no clouds
[1:28:11] we're just talking about the clouds
[1:28:17] you stuck clowns
[1:28:23] well at least you come to church and you
[1:28:25] learn something
[1:28:26] um
[1:28:34] Revelation 10-1
[1:28:36] apocalypse is yes oh no
[1:28:41] it's gonna get good here
[1:28:46] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:28:49] from heaven closed with a club
[1:28:56] and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:29:01] and his face was it was the Sun
[1:29:06] and his speed is pillars of fire is
[1:29:11] remember he was close with the clouds
[1:29:16] but the Covenant was upon his head is
[1:29:26] what causes the color of the rainbow
[1:29:31] colors is the way the Sun hits the drop
[1:29:38] of rain his commercial
[1:29:41] and that's how he throws the color
[1:29:49] this claw was a covenant is
[1:29:56] and this Angel yes
[1:30:00] because in the old
[1:30:03] testamento it was called the angel of
[1:30:06] the Covenant
[1:30:11] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:30:14] open
[1:30:16] um
[1:30:19] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:30:23] and his left foot on the earth he puts a
[1:30:25] superiority
[1:30:29] so where did he put his feet
[1:30:33] he put one foot on wrong
[1:30:38] and the other one on the United States
[1:31:16] one of the beasts came out of the sea
[1:31:20] station
[1:31:24] and brothers
[1:31:31] of Revelation did I say onset the
[1:31:34] apocalypse this is another best thing
[1:31:37] he came out of the Earth
[1:31:41] for there was no people
[1:31:43] and that's the United States
[1:31:49] and the image
[1:31:53] so the angel came down
[1:31:56] and put one foot on wrong
[1:32:00] and put the other food on the United
[1:32:02] States
[1:32:03] and he said time shall be no more
[1:32:09] I have prepared Russia to throw atomic
[1:32:13] bombs to both of you
[1:32:17] your time is over
[1:32:22] no more yeah no
[1:32:24] no we can say as we turn the corner
[1:32:34] Jesus on the cross Jesus
[1:32:38] I have been asked this question yeah
[1:32:42] ask this question to our pastor or Tommy
[1:32:46] is
[1:32:52] is the blood of Jesus cleanses
[1:32:58] how could the blood
[1:33:00] cleanse me commas
[1:33:03] because Jesus did not have more blood
[1:33:06] than any of you okay Jesus
[1:33:09] how could he clean all his things
[1:33:14] such little blood that he heard
[1:33:21] it's a human he only has so much blood
[1:33:26] so the chemistry of the blood was
[1:33:31] not sprinkle every heart
[1:33:36] because the blood was shed and Cavalry
[1:33:42] and it based the ground
[1:33:47] when the blood cell was broke
[1:33:52] great release God and so
[1:33:57] adios through the Sanctified
[1:34:02] that the blood had to come back to the
[1:34:06] believer
[1:34:09] so we could be identified with our
[1:34:13] sacrifice
[1:34:16] it was the life of the sacrifice in US
[1:34:21] foreign
[1:35:07] Jesus breathed on them
[1:35:12] and he breathed in them the Holy Ghost
[1:35:18] repeated the spirit too
[1:35:20] the question was asked
[1:35:23] did they receive the Holy Spirit right
[1:35:26] then
[1:35:32] well let me tell you
[1:35:34] if you got a naked do you have an oak
[1:35:37] tree
[1:35:43] thank you yeah
[1:35:46] so do you have an oak tree
[1:35:49] like you said potentially right
[1:35:52] potential
[1:35:54] so did they have the Holy Spirit right
[1:35:57] then and there yeah
[1:36:10] later he he almost cursed the Lord
[1:36:18] you know
[1:36:19] before the Cockroach you will deny me
[1:36:22] three times
[1:36:34] and you shall receive the promise
[1:36:38] the gift of the Holy Ghost spirit to
[1:36:42] Santo
[1:36:50] because Jesus had taken the book out of
[1:36:53] the dirty hands of Satan and get to the
[1:36:55] original owner yeah
[1:37:02] here we go akibamos so Elijah said
[1:37:06] I hear the abundance of friends
[1:37:19] he went all through the third changes
[1:37:44] my stories
[1:37:46] he's so I thought about the eyes of the
[1:37:50] hand of a man
[1:37:54] where did he see the clouds
[1:37:57] Saint Luke 12 54. son Lucas
[1:38:05] and he said also through the people when
[1:38:08] you see a cloud rise out of the West
[1:38:12] straight away you say there cometh a
[1:38:15] showering so it is
[1:38:25] so when they saw the cloud here in the
[1:38:28] wells
[1:38:38] why was there an abundance of rain
[1:38:46] Ultimo
[1:38:49] what did you say
[1:38:50] the latter the the letter rain
[1:38:55] and the Harvest rain came together
[1:39:01] it was an abundance of rain
[1:39:06] and when you see the South going blow
[1:39:08] you say there will be heat and it comes
[1:39:10] to pass
[1:39:19] you Hypocrites you can discern the face
[1:39:22] of the sky and of the Earth but how is
[1:39:24] it that you do not discern this time
[1:39:33] they cannot discern the times
[1:39:39] so
[1:39:41] what does a cloud produce
[1:39:45] lightning before the Thunder
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:11] or wherever the carcass is there will
[1:40:15] the Eagles gather together
[1:40:20] the carcass is here
[1:40:23] we're all legal here together
[1:40:31] and he said unto the disciples that days
[1:40:34] will come when you shall desire to see
[1:40:37] one of the days of the son of man and
[1:40:39] you shall not see it
[1:40:41] can you leave it on that verse because I
[1:40:43] didn't have that here please could you
[1:40:45] put it back
[1:40:46] go ahead
[1:40:50] okay
[1:41:03] and they shall say do you say hear or
[1:41:05] say there go not after them nor follow
[1:41:08] them
[1:41:16] where is the lightning the lightest all
[1:41:18] that one power under Heaven's shyness
[1:41:21] unto the other part under heaven so
[1:41:24] shall also the son of man be in his days
[1:41:37] what proves must he suffer many things
[1:41:39] and be rejected of this generation
[1:41:43] is
[1:41:56] it was in the days of Noah socially but
[1:41:59] we also in the days of the son of man
[1:42:02] is
[1:42:09] they did it
[1:42:10] they drank they married wife they were
[1:42:14] given in marriage until the day that
[1:42:16] Noah entered into the ark and the plot
[1:42:18] came and destroyed them all
[1:42:21] is
[1:42:30] can you see
[1:42:33] as a light has traveled the lightning
[1:42:36] has traveled from the East to the West
[1:42:38] yes
[1:42:45] like in the times
[1:42:52] in this time that we live
[1:42:56] isn't there a flood of doctrines and
[1:42:59] churches and Greece and doctrines all
[1:43:01] over
[1:43:03] the difference
[1:43:05] oh the flood has seen all the churches
[1:43:09] the world
[1:43:13] no
[1:43:23] the lamb takes the book of seals
[1:43:27] and breaks them
[1:43:30] and shows the seven angels the mysteries
[1:43:33] of God
[1:43:35] which is the ministry of the seventh
[1:43:38] angels
[1:43:39] He had to reveal it to us
[1:43:43] in order to have Rapture in faith
[1:43:47] and when he cried with a loud voice
[1:43:51] seven Thunders
[1:43:57] which will be revealed in order to get
[1:44:00] the bride ready
[1:44:03] and together for rapturing faith
[1:44:07] we need the face to be changed in a
[1:44:10] moment
[1:44:13] to be taken out of the Earth
[1:44:18] this is the last scripture
[1:44:21] Revelation 14 14 foreign
[1:44:33] heaven and he said our Golden Crown and
[1:44:36] in his hand a sharp sickle
[1:44:39] images
[1:44:52] and another angel came out of the temple
[1:44:55] crying with the loud voice to him that
[1:44:57] sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle
[1:45:00] and reap for the time he's come for thee
[1:45:03] to reap for the Harvest of the earth is
[1:45:06] right
[1:45:21] and he that sit on the cloud throws
[1:45:24] trust in his sickle on the Earth and the
[1:45:27] Earth was ripped
[1:45:39] is in the sickle going around right now
[1:45:43] is is
[1:45:52] n't this a harvest
[1:45:56] rain that's raining now
[1:46:04] and the closer
[1:46:06] then God gets to us
[1:46:11] should we get closer to God
[1:46:15] because the time will come
[1:46:19] when the Harvest will be over
[1:46:26] the hidden mysteries in the foundation
[1:46:29] of the world
[1:46:32] it's not being revealed in the last days
[1:46:35] to the manifested sons of God
[1:46:40] these seven Thunders never utter in
[1:46:43] heaven yes
[1:46:51] to that group that is perfected
[1:46:57] who can really take the word of God
[1:47:05] the lightning produced the Thunder
[1:47:13] when two clouds Collide
[1:47:19] when did the two clouds collided
[1:47:25] it was too omnipotents coming together
[1:47:31] and that happened yesterday
[1:47:35] when brother Brennan was lifted to the
[1:47:38] king's chamber because
[1:47:43] okay
[1:47:46] enlightening he was the leader's throat
[1:47:49] in Republic lose
[1:47:56] and the lightning Strokes look for power
[1:48:00] lines yes
[1:48:04] he was the Overcomer in Era Alexander
[1:48:11] that was when he in February 28 of 1963.
[1:48:18] and that's when the Seven Seals were
[1:48:21] open
[1:48:24] he was the overcomer
[1:48:29] and that was the only one that could go
[1:48:31] into the king's exchange
[1:48:36] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:48:40] waters
[1:48:43] searching for a place to rest
[1:48:47] he came searching for a preferred ground
[1:48:53] he was searching for an overcomer
[1:48:57] he was searching for a power line
[1:49:02] and in 1963
[1:49:06] after opening the seals yes
[1:49:12] it was opened in the east oriente
[1:49:17] the lightning came West yeah
[1:49:23] I asked the question
[1:49:26] the lightning came from the East
[1:49:30] to the West at Occidental but the cloud
[1:49:33] was in the west
[1:49:37] and after the sales were broken during
[1:49:41] in the east
[1:49:47] the leader stroke was looking
[1:50:06] so he was looking for a place to rest
[1:50:10] concert
[1:50:16] when the seals were opened
[1:50:20] the only place he could go was to New
[1:50:23] Mexico
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:27] he came to New Mexico
[1:50:30] he was looking for a power line
[1:50:35] who was the power line
[1:50:38] Prophet was a little strong and
[1:50:41] Professor
[1:50:46] but it doesn't come from heaven
[1:50:50] from it comes from the earth
[1:50:53] and the little strong main connection
[1:50:56] with a mainstream yeah
[1:51:06] with a lot of energy
[1:51:09] it was not air Arizona California
[1:51:13] or any other state they had to come to
[1:51:18] New Mexico
[1:51:21] New Mexico
[1:51:23] a lot of energy
[1:51:26] it opened the atomic age
[1:51:33] he came to New Mexico
[1:51:36] and he went to Hanover Hanover
[1:51:54] but you
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:29] how many in here were born
[1:52:32] before 1945
[1:52:36] raise your hands we got one oh no two
[1:52:42] those three dress
[1:52:44] four
[1:52:49] they were born
[1:52:52] because the atomic bomb was in July the
[1:52:55] 16th 1945.
[1:53:01] and I said it before when their atomic
[1:53:05] bomb hit in New Mexico
[1:53:08] they knocked me off as a couch where I
[1:53:11] was sleeping
[1:53:13] I didn't know what it was I only know
[1:53:17] that I bounce to the floor
[1:53:21] so then the prophet said Prophet The
[1:53:25] Leader stroke
[1:53:28] this is the founding person
[1:53:32] you're full of power
[1:53:35] you are the main stroke here you said is
[1:53:39] who gave the confirmation of that
[1:53:44] so the sun is
[1:53:55] he said I have never seen a Ministry
[1:53:58] like this since my father-in-law was
[1:54:02] alive
[1:54:09] who can argue about the ministry of our
[1:54:12] funding persons
[1:54:15] there was a power line
[1:54:19] and the prophets told him foreign
[1:54:25] to help me
[1:54:27] help me to gather all the Loose Ends
[1:54:36] we were losing
[1:54:39] we were all in the world
[1:54:42] we were in denominations
[1:54:45] I need you to help me to get these loose
[1:54:48] ends
[1:54:50] and then because we were born in the
[1:54:53] atomic age

[1:55:01] and to finish
[1:55:03] to say this is
