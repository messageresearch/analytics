also want to greet our brothers on the internet may the Lord bless each one of them [Music] Fabi it's a pleasure to see our brother Fabio and sister brother Abraham the prophet says that there are monuments tested by time so in this evening we're gonna get into the word of God I'm going to ask you to open your scriptures in the book of Exodus chapter 33 but before reading the scripture let us go before the author of the word to ask for the guidance of God in this evening blessed and good Heavenly Father we give you thanks for one more day of Health and life we're gathered here in this place to worship and glorify your Holy Name we're going to open this word but we want to ask you that you add the blessings to the reading of it our hearts are open for you to give us your word that you may be the one who minister in this evening that you may be in each brother and sister that your Holy Spirit may move in the audience if there is someone sick that you may heal him by Your Word we only put ourselves in your hands surrender for your service in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen the word of God says Exodus 33 verse 15 and he said unto him If thy presence go not with with me carry us not up hands for wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight is it not that is it not in that thou goest with us so shall be separated I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou Hast spoken for thou has found Grace in my side and I Know Thee by name may the Lord add the blessings to to the reading of his word may be seated I want to thank our pastor for the opportunity for permitting us to be in this place so this conversation that Moses is having he is not talking to any person he is talking nothing else but but to the Lord he is talking to the Eternal God he was coming from a walk in the Wilder they had gone through a lot of Trials and tests right after they left Egypt the first time Israel was already murmuring but there's something important that the word of God is speaking and Moses puts a condition on God and him being the prophet says he had a calling to take the people to the promised land he had seen the hand and the marvels of God but it came to a point he reached a part of desperation that he said if your presence is not with me I will not take a step forward do not not move me from here I'm better here until your presence is with me and then he said in this shall you know that I have found Grace in this evening brother and sister first thing we want to do is to find grace before the eyes of God for we we don't want to give a step forward we don't want to leave we don't want to move his presence is not with us Moses moving forward in this journey he said I don't want to know anything else but number one that I have found Grace in thy sight and that thou walk with us and that me and thy people they that you walk with us but the answer comes from God I shall be with the I'll walk with thee you must be I separated people from the rest of the people God doesn't want he does not desire it is not within God to share his glory with anyone he wants you and you alone he's not calling anyone else when he's knocking at the door he knocking at your heart for you to open your door or his presence to go with you now for you to find grace before God for me to find grace before God I should please God for for me to please God we all know and we repeat it by memory without faith it is impossible to please God we can't recite it one once and one once again but Apostle Peter is teaching us that we when we have faith or when we advance in faith there's a very important point that Apostle Peter teaches us and he's saying first Peter 1:6 where you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through many full Temptation this word heaviness it it catches my attention the word Afflicted causing oppression it's something that's going to wear you out and it's going to give give you sadness at the same time it it's going to give you discomfort it's going to give you physical suffering that's what having an Affliction means so for a for a short period of time we must be afflicted we must have discomfort not every not all life we're going to have comfortness we must have a physical suffering that the trial that the trial the trial of your faith being much more precious than a gold we can see that in all the scriptures where everyone who pleased God they had to come to this point of putting their faith to test we all can say we have faith but what about the day that our faith has to be tested that's what the people of God had experienced in the walking in the wilderness they wanted to go to the land they wanted to go to a land flowing with milk and honey they were going in that walk but they did not know for them to please God you don't please God with anything else but having faith so when you have faith now your faith needs to be it must be tested with Affliction with trials as to The Heroes of Faith I want to share a quote from the [Applause] prophet the messenger the the message God's covenant with Abraham and his seat God does not make any difference between his children we are all sons of God he's not gonna make a distinction of anyone for you for him you are his daughter you are his daughter you are his son and we all before the presence of God are he does not make any difference but every son that cometh to God must first be tried it has to be punished now the word Whi it's not just anything else it is to beat someone repetitively to beat someone violently once and once again very negative effects in a person but in that way your faith my faith must be tested God he doesn't want any person like his children if you cannot bear with the with a child keep this in your heart you must be afflicted first you must be be whipped so you can go through the process of of trial the bud when it produces fruits before producing the fruit God purchase it first God cleans it out first that removes all the old leaves removes the branches that are useless it's a hurtful situation when it the shaking comes it's not a a cause to be happy but after that it has the fruit God does that for you and I to produce fruit fruit 100 fold now look the the Bible says the trials and temptations are wonderful and they're even much more precious than gold have you ever ever been scourged or whipped a whip imagine it's not just beating up God that's how he does with his children and I wanted to ask a question this year how many are children of God being a child of God has a process it is a discipline the prophet says You must be whipped and you must be disciplined what is the word discipline we saw that the word whip is when a person is whip whipped is when that person is beaten repetitively and violently and after he went through that process after he still he says Lord whatever you say Lord that is a child that has now discipline comes God that gives him a set of norms and rules to follow in a behavior and to keep order before people God didn't choose you God didn't choose us to polish you to order you to discipline you and then keep you here down here where nobody usess God disciplines to show us up before people and say behold my behold my daughter in whom I am well it's not me it is not the person but as people if we could stop seeing the flesh this flesh is going to fail but we have to do this to tear up the the flesh to go beyond the veil of Flesh and see that inside there's a son and the daughter of God tested by time but that is what I have to do not seeing the flesh flesh is going to make mistakes flesh fails flesh is going to forget flesh stumbles that's what flesh is but inside the flesh there's a there's a that God hased every heart of human being and if my eyes don't have enough Revelation to see that there's a severe problem with me the brother is not fighting his own battle by himself that's why there are brothers and sister to help them because we're Army it's not the brother against the brother it's not the sister against the sister That's what Satan has placed he has tried to bring dissension but the Son of God goes beyond the veil he goes beyond the veil he looks more and he looks at a son God a daughter of God purchased by blood to the price of pain where eternity is found and this eternity United with this other eternity and in this moment it becomes the Gathering of the Gods if you do not believe it is because you need your faith to be tested but we are sitting we are sitting in Heavenly places and I repeat it again we are sitting in Heavenly places and we are sitting with Christ Jesus in who in who my brother my sister that's where Christ Jesus the holy spirit is in him heaped him he baptized him what I have to go is to go be Beyond the Veil of FL to go beyond the veil of Flesh he's not against me I am not against him united we are against an enemy it comes as a flood if you could imagine the word River it comes to tear apart to destroy to remove to dissolve to divide That's what Satan is becomes as a flaw the spirit of the Lord a standard now you and I no we we are like David was when he wrote Psalm 42 he was in trials and test he was in Affliction he said why all my soul oh my soul why why are you discouraged with in the Lord upon the Lord why you this courage within me all my soul wait upon the Lord why are you cast down on my soul if if you one one time notice this l let God remove those old old branches those old leaves that old that old branches that they are useless they're not good for anything they're only their hindering let God Purge you let God remove it let God move you as job he had every everything he had was destroyed in such a way that he didn't know where he was going that's where he found himself in that condition he only said the Lord God had taken the Lord God had given blessed be the name of the Lord his children have been slaughtered it's not anything else it's receiving a whiping beit with violence but he certain of who God was and Moses he was certain of who God was that's why he said if your pres does not go with me if thy presence is not with me do not move me from I don't want to move I'm not going to give a step forward until your presence is with me but you you must found find grace before the eyes of God and for you to find grace before the eyes of God remember there's only one way and that is with faith God bless you am man God bless you this fine evening can you give one to the Lord amen what a amen what a word amen what I was back there listening to brother Salvador you know he was talking about us being in Heavenly places you know and and um everybody was shocked dead no reaction no you know but we have to believe that you know we have to believe that we're in Heavenly places you know we got to take it for what it's worth God comes and he wants to bless us so what's the problem what's so hard to take that Faith to take that faith and use it we're afraid many times to use God's faith are we in Heavenly places right now did you bring your portion tonight you know I I know brother Tommy says this a lot he says we are living below our god-given privilege we are living the the the presence of God the blessings of God he wants to give them to us you know I was thinking about something today you know we see and we hear many times the prophet of God says they longed to be sitting where you're sitting they long to be in this day and many times we look and we take it for what it's worth but Church you know we are living in a day we are living in an hour last week it's better today for one step closer to going home you cannot tell me that the word that's being brought forth is more powerful you've ever heard before you say no brother we heard better word God is Progressive he gives us what we need and this day it's a special day not yesterday it already passed but what God has for us today what he has today it's special special say he's knocking on your heart but he said don't Harden your heart we got to take his word for what it's worth because tonight we're going to talk about something God gave me a message and in this message he told me when their eyes met that's where it started he said I want you to imagine something imagine when John the Baptist for the first time his eyes met Jesus he said what do you think was happening we talked about this day family Pastor talked about this day he said it's going to be a great day he said it's going to be a day of a manifestation that this word I'm preaching it will come to pass there will be maturity there will be a bride that has made herself ready but the problem we looked to yesterday but I could imagine John preached of a Christ that was coming from the day that he could be barely survived by himself he left his home how many years we don't know but he was in the wilderness God talked to him he saw a vision he saw something great something great that was coming but one day he met his eyes with Christ he said he is the Son of God he is that lamb something happened but what about me that was John the Baptist but what about us what about today what about it it's your day you know I'll tell you Church the messages that our pastor has preached I don't know about you but they rocked my world he made a statement are you guessing if your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life or are you sure that it's there he says it's too late to be guessing to be wondering because many times that's what we do we go through life and we want to put everything before God and we have these stupid thoughts what are we doing going to church is this God real and these thoughts come in what are we doing are we sleeping in church do we come to church whenever we want do we not take it for what it's worth if God is who he says he is then he's got to do something his word has got to do what it says it will do John chapter 14 even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth in you and shall be in you on church that's got to make it alive to you this was then but that word is being manifest it's got to mean something to us he says I will leave you comfortless is that what it says oh we're not in a hurry tonight see when I speak I can say what brother Jimmy says in half the time I may leave The Interpreter behind once in a while so let's let's get hold of this says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you let's let's take God's word tonight let's make it produce what it says it's going to produce in me Amen in me okay take it come on this is what it says it's going to do he said yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you you see me because I live you live also you want some more and he says at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and me and I you and I know these are such common scriptures that have so much power but we take them as common because imagine let's imagine what really happens and I heard a brother preaching this and it just it really caught me Joshua do you think that the people got so tired of him talking of this promised land and I know what you're thinking and I I use this one for for a reason you're saying brother you're going to preach on Joshua again we've heard you can't say anything you haven't said before don't worry that's we're going somewhere tonight so imagine now they were in the wilderness for 40 years but it came to a point that they began to die off that generation began to die off and they began to hear Joshua and Caleb okay tell us the story again how you to the promised land how you brought those grapes across how that there were giants tell us the story again because it's so common just like that's what the word does we let it become common in our lives if God said he would heal you then with faith tonight you take that healing but many times we let our brother we step all over him he begin he's our stepping stone but that's not what the word said the word said he would produce a bride that would make herself ready you cannot tell me that in any time that the word of God it's not producing what it is today that's that's what I see that's the faith that I have a br a brother asked me this one the other day he said why is so great I want to understand this William brandom you guys talk about we're driving down the road and I threw a renion into him he said you I could prove that God is everywhere I said no you can't and I started hitting him with faith and I said you you have to do by faith we have to prove it by the scriptures yes but by faith God gave us that tool to believe who he was then later couple days later I told him you want to know how I believe a prophet said the scripture says that but it's by faith you know we come we say let the word do what it says it's going to do but you got to do it by faith you know there are many here today that need The Old Rugged Cross and you say what are you saying brother I need that old rck cross every I don't want forget what he did for me sacrifice that he made because that blood for me it's still wet on the cross was I there that day no but by faith I believe it now it's through faith became tangible to me but that's what God's word does but we got to take it in our lives every single day because John the Baptist his eyes met with Jesus but so did Peter's Peter said Lord if that's you call me to walk on the water his eyes met Jesus and he walked on the water but as soon as he took his eyes as soon as he took him off Jesus he began to look around he saw the waves he saw the storms he saw every problem that there was and he he almost drowned so now here here he is let's go a little further let me read you let me read your a quote Jehovah Gyra 3 paragraph n he said but one day oh hallelujah hallelujah he said remember that promise his promise to Abraham because what happens we forget about what God's done for us they wondered in the wilderness but before that they were in bondage we got comfortable in bondage we get comfortable in bondage we take it we accept what the devil has for us we take it we let sin bondage us but he said one day God remembered that he gave Abraham a promise he said Glory now I'm beginning to fill religion notice God remembered his promise to Abraham he anointed a prophet with a pillar of fire over him he came down into the land and began to remind them of the promise of God that could not fail and God was present to vindicate that word he said right he told them there there was a land flowing with milk and honey God had given it to them they marched out of Egypt on the on the on the strength of a testimony of this Prophet with the pillar of fire over him because he was sent and God had proved that he was with him isn't that what happened in our midst church has God through his word Pro it to us that he's a powerful he's a mighty God because what did he do he said after those times he said now I will send my son and I will put him on the cross I will shed his blood that's what he did for us but many times we take it as common oh what are you going to do tell me what God did on the cross again I'm not going to tell you what he's done on the cross I'm going to tell you what he's done with me I'm going to tell you how he transformed me how he's made me a Son of God because that's what John saw he said this is what this is what I saw something inside of John it was bubbling his prophecy had come to pass the prophecy of Isaiah Jeremiah had come to pass now his brother brother Bram and today after 2,000 years we still have that evidence that we have passed from Death life our Joshua has brought back the evidence and we on our way to that Promised Land tasting of the Heavenly gifts of God that he has brought back to us notice it how wonderful where when we were once in darkness he said now look where we're at today now we're going to get to our message here because many times we find oursel in a place that we are undone we are broken we let the devil tell us whatever he wants We Believe oh let's change today accept that cross that blood that he shed for us because let's read the scripture acts three and I and I want you like I said we're not in hurry we got an hour now in my time my time is faster let's let's start off with verse two remember how the rice had met and a certain man lay from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who seen Peter and John about to go into the temple ask an arms imag and John walking down the gates imagine what that lay man was thinking he was lame from his from birth they would bring him every day to the gate why do you how do you think he felt do you think he felt great about himself that they had to bring him to beg every single day now we're going to switch it around here Peter and John walked with Jesus they saw how he healed the sick now the scene is changed and Peter fasting his eyes upon him with John and he said look on us re he said look on us and we know what the prophet of God says he said they weren't saying look at me he he said they they try to say pay attention we're about to tell you something verse six vers six and pet Peter's famous words Silver and Gold Have I None but s such I have G such I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth he says rise up and walk that was good enough right there and it says Peter then he said he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet his ankles they reive strength just another story huh I know many times God's word doesn't excite us we've heard this we've heard this a million times and leaping up he stood and walked and entered into the temple walking and leaping and praising God but why was he so happy church that was the first time the first time that he entered into the temple he was brought outside of the temple without hope he never had that opportunity to step into that Temple but that's what God's word does for us he sent the fful ministry to give us hope that's what he did church this man didn't have no hope but Peter fastened his eyes on him he says Silver and Gold Have he says but what I do have he says I give unto you no hope he didn't know much he didn't know what it was to go into God's Temple he didn't know what it was to praise the Lord but it was at the third hour the Third hour that they were passing by because it was that hour that they went into the temple and they gave their prayers but it was also the third hour that Grace came to him and it was also that third hour that Christ died on the cross they went and he shed his blood it was that was the only only hope that that lame man had was at the third hour and many times we may say oh brother that's just a another common story here's the prophet of God he said I could take hours and hours telling you of things that I've seen oh why he said Jesus her great warrior he said went over and conquered that land he conquered death and hell he conquered grave on that third day you see how the trees are coming into place and he said I am he that was dead but I'm alive forever I have the keys to death and hell he said there's the Conqueror since he rent the veil in two he said here he stands so now or there he stands now here here it is today we hear many times and we we don't we don't think you know what it how it affects the presence of God oh here's brother Caleb again talking about this revival in Africa talking about this revival in Africa there's brother Caleb again telling us of all the Miracles that happened in his dad's time here's brother Tommy again here's this one and we don't realize that's why we cannot have the healing in our midst don't take it for comment the same thing happened to the prophet of God the prophet after he had after he had called the Scrolls into existence he's there there with a bunch of brothers and they're getting together in a home and they were about to pray to leave and brother Bram says here let let me talk to you about something and the and the prop the prophet God was about to start talking and one of the brothers says what brother Bram what are you going to tell us again how you call the Scrolls into existence you know many wow it happened with our prophet of course it's going to happen in our midst same spirits and I know I preached on a blushing Prophet not that long ago but I want you to imagine that Prophet gave his life for us imagine how it made him feel I could imagine him leaving with his head down how great God was that this nation a filthy Nation but that was the tool that God used and they said what is it just another story brother BR how the Scrolls came into existence out of nothing they were created our brother Brown probably had his head down but it was a couple of days later church that he walked into the house of had right and the brothers that were with him they said we've never felt the presence of God because the word came out and Har R stood up and said brother Bram that's every bit of the truth brother bra says you ask what you want anything you're poor your sister's crippled it doesn't matter what you want and she said oh I only want the salvation of my two kids chch I'm tired of letting the devil take what's ours we're tired of it it's time to claim what's ours it's a claiming time don't don't take God's word as common you call God's word into existence you know we we said many times our founding Pastor was years and years ahead of his time I'm
