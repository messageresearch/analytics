okay ready one come on one two legs ready one two three four but hoorah hoorah may be seated all right how many has has heard of the story of Moses who knows the story of Moses right we all know the story of Moses you know he was the one that took the people of Israel out of Egypt to the promised land we all know that right now one of your teachers in Sunday school told me that you guys already know the story of Joshua and Caleb is that right amen amen amen you guys want jumping jacks - okay so let's get our swords let's stand to our feet let's open up our Bibles to the book of numbers numbers 13 chapter 13 verse 1 and 2 chapter 13 yes chapter 13 verse 1 and it says and the Lord and the Lord spake unto Moses saying send out men and that they may research the land of Canaan which I give unto the children of Israel of every tribe of the father of their fathers shall ye sandy man everyone at ruler among them a man close their Bible you be you have permission to be seated so so Moses was meditating he was meditating and the Lord called upon him and he told him to go see the promised land that I promised you the children of Israel now from each tribe he got a man someone raised their hand and tell me how many men were they yes stand to your feet that's exactly right yes there were 12 men at least 12 men they were they were sent to a mission they were a special task force and so these men - what went to their mission and as they went they went to the promised land because Moses had asked them well I need you to do the mission to go see if there's week if they're strong men if there's walls if there's a city if there's water if there's food and you don't know what's over there Moses had a lot of questions so these spies they went to the promised land now next question they brought evidence so they looked at the promise they observe the the they observed the Promised Land right no first question I hope I'm not confusing you guys first question how many days did they scout and spied on the Promised Land raise your hand yes hey no no almost how many days they scouted in the promised land voice no well they scouted the land it's spot on the land for 40 days you're in the land you remember did you guys learned that in Sunday school they spotted the land for 40 days and idly spotted they took evidence to the people back they went back to camp to Moses they took evidence what did they take as evidence raise your hand no no yes but you got to stand up come on soldier you could tell right here come on attention grapes that is exactly right but not any kind of grapes there were big grapes there it was a branch of grapes it was huge so it was so big that they had to put it on a on a stick and two men how to carry it back so that when they went back Moses told Moses saw the grapes all the people saw the grapes and they asked okay well the report what did you guys see what happened and they said well there was honey and milk flowing it sounds pretty good huh honey milk maybe cookies never know right they said there was honey and milk flowing but there was just one problem Moses and the aunt out of the 12 spies the ten were complaining and they said Moses we cannot cannot go to the promised land and Moses said what's what you guys see there are giants there are men of great stature we cannot defeat them yes and only to to knew they could and only to knew they could keep them amen that's right good job that's exactly right but that's why there were ten of them complaining and as they were complaining to Moses Moses hasn't said anything but then like our soldier said two men stood up Caleb raised his hands and said we shall go to the promised land we shall go because it is ours already we will win the battle that's how we soldiers have to face our battles today with the same faith the same courage the Caleb and Joshua had the same courage we need when we go to school when we're traveling when we were in church or at the park we always have to have that faith and so but the people still complained the people cried they murmured they they were sad because they couldn't go against the Giants they were tired because they thought that Aaron and Moses brought brought them to let him die in the land of Canaan so they said you know what Moses we're gonna pick a new leader we're gonna pick a new captain we don't want you anymore do I scare you okay amen and and wait and when forgive me and when Moses Moses just fell down on his feet with Aaron and the Lord came and the Lord's presence appeared and he said the people of Israel I would destroy the people of Israel he was going to destroy the people of Israel but then he said but then Moses cried out say forgive forgive the people and they were forgiven but they had to face the consequences sometimes when we don't obey the Word of God when we don't obey our parents when we don't do what's right that's exactly right soldier they punish us and we have to learn from from our mistakes we have to learn from our mistakes so they were sent for how many years were they sent in the wilderness raise your hand who knows that think for how many years they were sent in the wilderness to die that is correct well done soldier they were sent 40 years to the wilderness to die but Joshua and Caleb how they stood up for the Lord and that they knew what they they were not looking at the Giants they were not looking at the walls they were looking straight at the promise and they knew what they wanted they knew directly what they wanted so that's that's that's what we have to remember now in days that's open right let's let's open our Bibles to the book of mark mark chapter 11 verse 24 all right Santa Fe therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen so remember that's one of the promises that Lord has gave us that we should pray pray but you got to know that that is a promise whenever you pray for it's already yours it's already done so when you're going through I have a testimony myself when when I was younger years ago no I'm just kidding that was last year I was a young boy and I remember I was frustrated I was frustrated I was sad and I always thought when I prayed to the Lord I say the Lord is too busy for me the Lord has so many prayers to answer he doesn't have time for me you wouldn't care I thought to myself so I thought okay I don't need to pray anymore I don't need to hear the God's Word I don't need to hear his message I said that terrible it was consequences for that and and when you feel lonely and when you feel scared and you don't know what to do and it's okay to be afraid because we are humans and when you feel scared you start searching other places you start searching other friends friends that are there that don't even believe this will beautiful word and you talk to them and oh and I'll tell you what your friends out there in school they're not gonna care about your spiritual life they're not going to care about your relationship with God that comes to you that comes to you when I realized when I went to these people when I when I when I went to other friends when I went to these influences I looked back it was far away I was far away so just don't cry I was far away from the Lord and the Lord had yeah promised me he already had promised me he promised me that I will be fine he promised me no matter where I am with fear he always will be by my side always amen that's my that's my testimony and the Lord brought me to his feet and children when you feel afraid don't be afraid to talk the way the Lord now the way the Lord brought me close to him he didn't just brought me close to him he brought me through my parents I spoke to my parents my parents came to me remember your parents are not there just to spank you or just to ground you although they do you know but remember they loved you so much when you feel insecure about something or you feel lonely go to your parents talk about it with your parents don't be afraid don't go to your friends to school don't go anywhere else all your parents want is the best for you best amen that's right so don't be afraid don't be afraid to speak with your parents don't be don't be don't be afraid now sometimes we feel alone and scared and we don't know what to do speak with your parents or speak with your pasture go to straight to your pastor your parents don't be afraid that the Lord is always gonna be by your side and always remember as a soldier stay put because the Lord is right there amen all right let's stand to our feet now the musicians could come up how many are in the Lord's army amen how many are the Lord's army all right I want to hear that
