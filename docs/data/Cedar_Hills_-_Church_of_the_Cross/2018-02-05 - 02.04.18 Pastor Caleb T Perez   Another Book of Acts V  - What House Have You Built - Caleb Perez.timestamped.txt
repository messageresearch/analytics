[1:04:28] simple as simply it's to try to rid sin
[1:04:31] as urgent of our lives
[1:04:33] LP colonists as even the word corrects
[1:04:35] the error because he wants to rid sin of
[1:04:37] our lives
[1:04:38] when the laconic still being experiment
[1:04:39] that is piccolo than us and that's why

[1:05:32] the couples the other day living history
[1:05:33] or less but love is not a feeling in a
[1:05:36] moral sense to me a feeling is just a
