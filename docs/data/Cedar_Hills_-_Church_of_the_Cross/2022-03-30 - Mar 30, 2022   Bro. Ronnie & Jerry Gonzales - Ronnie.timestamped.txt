[27:31] yeah
[27:32] john 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[27:36] and the word was with god and the word
[27:39] was god
[27:41] god want one
[27:45] johnny 1 4 in
[27:58] john 1 6 and 7.
[28:01] there was a manchester from god his name
[28:03] was john
[28:04] and
[28:05] the same came through and his
[28:07] development of the light
[28:15] [Music]
[28:28] like
[28:30] john 1 9. that was the true light that
[28:33] lights every man that comes into the
[28:35] world
[28:58] is
[29:12] [Music]
[29:14] is
[29:16] [Applause]
[29:17] [Music]
[29:30] [Applause]
[29:46] i'm just gonna steal this one i think
[29:49] uh it appears there's a lot of john's
[29:51] tonight i thought that was interesting
[29:52] just wanted to point it out love that
[29:53] from the sunday school kids but to those
[29:55] of you who know
[29:56] my pen name for the books that i publish
[29:59] and write is actually john anderson um
[30:01] a pen name is just a name that you use
[30:03] when you don't want crazy people to
[30:05] follow you and stalk you for the rest of
[30:06] your life
[30:07] if you happen to get to that point as an
[30:09] author so i just thought that was an
[30:11] interesting uh thing but hello everybody
[30:13] it is wonderful to see you all again my
[30:16] beautiful extended family so good to be
[30:19] back and i got inspired to read this
[30:21] poem today
[30:22] um just out of the blue and i wanted to
[30:25] give some backstory about it because the
[30:26] back stories about how the poems are
[30:28] inspired are pretty interesting about
[30:30] two years ago maybe two and a half years
[30:32] ago i went out to lordsburg which is in
[30:35] the middle of nowhere and that's really
[30:36] all there is to say about it
[30:38] and i got to meet a cousin of mine his
[30:41] name was cousin mike cousin mike is a
[30:43] gentleman who literally lives out in the
[30:46] middle of nowhere of the middle of
[30:48] nowhere
[30:49] he is a man who lives in a
[30:52] i guess you call it an rv
[30:54] and um
[30:55] i don't know how he survived because in
[30:56] the entirety of the time i was there i
[30:58] saw him drink a coca-cola and that was
[30:59] it
[31:00] so
[31:01] he's a very interesting guy but the
[31:03] weird uh not the weird but the
[31:04] interesting thing about him was he's a
[31:07] man who collects rocks he is a man who
[31:10] has basically made his hobby and his
[31:12] living off of going to riverbeds and
[31:15] finding rocks now the interesting thing
[31:17] about cousin mike is that he
[31:19] collects rocks that you and i would
[31:21] probably not even know had anything
[31:22] beautiful inside them and i got to
[31:25] partake in this event of finding rocks
[31:27] and uh seeing him actually shape them
[31:30] into what we call fluoride if you've
[31:32] ever seen fluoride it's a wonderful
[31:35] beautiful greenish kind of teal color
[31:37] and it's very nice to look at but if you
[31:39] saw the rock that it was shaped from you
[31:41] would not think that at all you would
[31:43] you would think it's just a rock and so
[31:45] when i went on this trip and i saw him
[31:46] use all the tools and the things that he
[31:48] used to grind the rock down it inspired
[31:50] me with this poem uh that is titled poem
[31:54] 32. it's
[31:55] it's uh
[31:59] in this book here and i'm going to read
[32:01] it all to you and uh i hope you enjoy it
[32:03] an alternative title if you're
[32:05] interested is also the river man um the
[32:07] river man is my cousin mike
[32:10] so
[32:11] river man river man shaper of the rocks
[32:14] seeing what's within these rocks of
[32:15] little talks a raggedy pebble mixed with
[32:18] gunk and rubble builds great beauty in
[32:20] size and with trouble
[32:22] beauty tests inside the minerals of
[32:24] fluoride though that would not be seen
[32:26] upon seeing the outside
[32:28] it is dirty rough and a heavy burden to
[32:30] clean but the riverman cleanses it no
[32:32] matter how mean cutting off the gunk and
[32:35] polishing the stone working the beauty
[32:37] it would not work alone the riverman
[32:39] watches tending to each stone with care
[32:41] understanding its makeup and what makes
[32:43] it fair in uic gold fluoride and silver
[32:46] are all good attributes of value to
[32:48] deliver
[32:49] it's hard to know all the treasures
[32:51] inside the beautiful makeup that we
[32:53] ourselves do hide but the river man
[32:55] knows he is quite witty he knows how we
[32:57] sparkle and shines so pretty washed in
[33:00] the water and forged in blood carried
[33:02] out of darkness rubble and mud we are
[33:04] the rocks the river man takes made of
[33:06] clay and dirt precious metals and shapes
[33:08] beauty within is so hard to find if one
[33:11] tries it solo with no tools to grind no
[33:13] water to clean no diamond to graze no
[33:16] tools to chip all our filth in all ways
[33:18] river man river man how we need you
[33:20] still to show us and make us the beauty
[33:23] you instill
[33:24] god bless you
[33:26] [Applause]
[33:34] amen god god bless the children of the
[33:36] julian thank you for that

[38:02] amen god bless you tonight
[38:07] good to see you each and every one of
[38:08] your faces
[38:10] [Music]
[38:11] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[38:16] and let's see just to get uh get started
[38:20] right away
[38:22] so let's turn to our scriptures in acts
[38:24] uh 748
[38:39] foreign
[38:49] okay and it reads
[38:51] i'll be at the most high dwelleth not in
[38:53] temples made with hands
[38:55] as saith the prophet
[38:58] templar
[39:04] [Music]
[39:28] [Music]
[39:36] thus saith the lord
[39:38] the heaven is my throne and earth is my
[39:40] footstool and i want to focus here on
[39:43] the second part
[39:44] where is the house that you build unto
[39:46] me
[39:47] and where is the place of my restaurant
[39:58] [Music]
[40:09] give thanks to the lord
[40:13] for the
[40:14] having confidence in us through our
[40:15] pastor
[40:19] to voice the word of god to you all
[40:22] the
[40:29] [Music]
[40:36] because every
[40:40] [Music]
[41:05] so we want to pray for our pastor and
[41:07] those that are that are traveling with
[41:08] him
[41:12] i know they're having a rough time
[41:13] getting out
[41:18] apparently they just
[41:22] [Music]
[41:30] and as i was driving a few days ago
[41:46] and it was the word development
[41:49] if you see my my title
[41:52] it's structure dash development
[41:55] [Music]
[41:57] so
[41:57] doing what i do you know i like to break
[41:59] down words
[42:42] and i
[42:46] [Music]
[43:04] [Music]
[43:23] and it came to the point where my
[43:24] training is
[43:26] [Music]
[43:29] so we have to do
[43:31] annual training on certain things
[43:36] right they give you a good company will
[43:37] always train it's a boy
[43:49] it keeps them educated in certain things
[43:58] [Music]
[44:05] [Music]
[44:12] [Music]
[44:34] to keep
[44:38] so you say brother jerry we're not in
[44:40] training no more we're in the battle
[44:41] they say
[44:44] that's true
[44:46] but even more so we have to be in
[44:47] training
[45:01] [Music]
[45:15] you have to keep up with the time
[45:19] because if we don't keep up with the
[45:20] time
[45:23] outdated very rapidly
[45:27] and an outdated person
[45:33] because it's hard when you don't know
[45:34] what you don't know
[45:38] so
[45:39] we know the cyber security is running
[45:41] rampant today
[46:06] but so so just let's just um
[46:09] talk about development here really quick
[46:10] let's define it really quick i know
[46:12] everybody knows what it
[46:32] for example like a project that's in
[46:33] development for example
[46:36] attractive land that has been made
[46:38] available or usable unapart
[46:43] [Music]
[46:53] in other words other words that mean
[46:54] development
[46:57] significant
[46:58] it went to evolution
[47:01] went to expansion expansion went to
[47:04] growth
[47:05] and progression
[47:07] so it started to make it started to come
[47:09] together a little bit
[47:11] like i said in my in my simple mind
[47:15] and how important it is for us to be
[47:16] developed
[47:20] keep in mind as i speak on things on the
[47:21] natural the puerto
[47:31] [Music]
[47:49] so
[47:50] it brought me to the message i was
[47:51] hearing
[47:54] when i when i heard development it took
[47:55] me to the message
[48:03] many of you have heard it the dark room
[48:47] so just bear with me really quick
[48:49] so but so in in the training when i was
[48:52] i work in training
[48:54] i thought about i thought about this
[48:55] this was what stuck to me
[49:00] it's an opportunity for professional
[49:01] development it's an opportunity
[49:04] remember that's what companies do to
[49:05] keep their employees up today
[49:14] it kind of reminds me of the rehearsal
[49:19] because we hear about transfiguration
[49:21] how it was a rehearsal
[49:26] right like like a training
[49:40] it took me to
[49:41] like i said mount transfiguration
[50:24] what it says here
[50:26] first timothy 3 16 i'm just going to
[50:28] paraphrase it okay
[50:29] [Music]
[50:32] because all scripture is given by
[50:33] inspiration of god
[50:36] and is profitable for doctrine
[50:46] so then again like i said i see in the
[50:48] scriptures that there's a certain
[50:49] structure that needs to be followed
[51:47] because there is an order to his coming
[51:51] did not moses see in heaven the way the
[51:53] tabernacle was patterned
[51:59] so he saw there was a certain
[52:01] development
[52:18] that's another message that our founding
[52:19] pastor preaches
[52:24] so we're gonna we're gonna find out here
[52:28] the synonyms to structure the synonymous
[52:31] destructura building the official and a
[52:35] word called edifice
[52:38] means a cathedral because
[52:44] you see how they kind of go hand in hand
[52:47] the structure is so the angle that i
[52:49] want to hit the structure now
[52:52] because we're going to find out because
[52:54] i'm only going to go about about five
[52:56] minutes
[52:58] but so the the angle
[53:01] that i want to hit on structure
[53:04] we're going to find out why the firefall
[53:07] ministry is so important
[53:11] why is it that they throw at it so much
[53:13] today
[53:16] what are they afraid of
[53:18] it says so god's saying
[53:20] that that a temple is not built by the
[53:22] hands of man
[53:58] [Music]
[54:07] there's something that's being built up
[54:35] [Applause]
[54:49] you're going to be all over the place i
[54:52] found in my routine my daily routine
[54:55] routine of the area many times i feel
[54:56] like i'm all over the place
[55:00] you know i'm like i'm gonna go to the
[55:01] gym i'm gonna i want to lose weight
[55:32] [Music]
[55:46] it's really no reality man builds a
[55:48] house right
[55:51] he's the one building the sanctuary
[55:54] but in reality
[55:56] it's god inspired men
[55:59] who built this if you
[56:23] [Applause]
[56:28] development
[56:41] what is
[56:56] the
[57:10] [Music]
[57:24] is
[57:38] is by the policies that are said
[57:40] [Music]
[57:43] here's an example of a development
[57:47] we say we love everyone
[57:50] but what happens when those words just
[57:52] become habitual
[58:06] so maybe back in the day when it first
[58:08] started
[58:10] it was enough to say i love you brother
[58:14] but what if it's not reinforced
[58:17] what if there's no training being done
[58:39] [Music]
[59:16] updated
[59:31] i it hits me before i even have the
[59:33] question
[59:36] so updated love in modern times
[59:41] updated
[59:44] updated for today to be able to to
[59:46] battle the devil today
[59:49] it requires updates
[59:54] requires exercise
[59:56] it requires training
[59:58] it requires
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:20] for if you love them which love you
[1:00:23] what reward have you
[1:00:24] you're not even the publicans the same
[1:00:40] you get the gist of it
[1:00:54] you just read it through the through the
[1:00:56] screen there
[1:00:57] but he says watch this
[1:01:00] this without this structure
[1:01:05] there will never be a development
[1:01:08] that's why there's so many
[1:01:09] interpretations
[1:01:12] of the message
[1:01:13] of the bible
[1:01:16] it requires a man to build a house
[1:01:19] he's asking what house will you build
[1:01:50] which most words ending in a-r-i-e-m
[1:01:56] a container for keeping something in
[1:01:59] content
[1:02:00] in this case holy or perhaps cherished
[1:02:03] people in this case
[1:02:19] and he gave some apostles prophets and
[1:02:20] some evangelists and some pastors and
[1:02:22] teachers
[1:02:23] there's the structure
[1:02:26] watch this for the perfecting of the
[1:02:28] saints
[1:02:30] for the work of the ministry
[1:02:32] for the edifying
[1:02:58] there's no way we're going to be able to
[1:02:59] get to this without going through that
[1:03:01] structure
[1:03:07] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:03:12] developed no longer developing
[1:03:23] [Music]
[1:03:27] is
[1:03:57] it's right after the structure
[1:04:02] he applies the structure
[1:04:04] and you notice how everything the
[1:04:05] development comes afterwards
[1:04:08] that's why it's so essential it's
[1:04:09] important
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:05:05] listen to him
[1:05:08] [Music]
[1:05:19] [Music]
[1:05:42] and that way we can be developed
[1:05:48] [Applause]
[1:06:01] jerry that's what i haven't heard in a
[1:06:02] while
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:31] i'm gonna be reading our first scripture
[1:06:32] here
[1:06:35] it's gonna be found in second
[1:06:36] corinthians
[1:06:38] chapter five verse 17.
[1:06:42] cinco
[1:06:46] now this bible that i'm preaching is my
[1:06:48] interpretation bible here
[1:06:50] [Music]
[1:06:52] so i have a interpretation bible and a
[1:06:54] preaching bible
[1:06:57] but as i was getting my preaching bible
[1:06:59] to come to church
[1:07:03] when i had second corinthians 5 17.
[1:07:09] it wasn't even the right scripture
[1:07:11] i told my
[1:07:12] wife i was like what the heck is this
[1:07:14] yeah
[1:07:16] it goes from i'm going to read from 17
[1:07:17] to 21.
[1:07:20] it just goes from
[1:07:21] 17 and 18.
[1:07:24] and it's not even the right scripture
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:35] therefore if any man be in christ
[1:07:38] he is a new creature
[1:07:40] all things are passed away
[1:07:42] behold all things are become new
[1:07:53] and all
[1:07:55] and all things are of god
[1:07:58] who have reconciled us to himself by
[1:08:00] jesus christ
[1:08:02] and have given to us the ministry of
[1:08:04] reconciliation
[1:08:07] reconciliation
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:14] to wit that god was in christ
[1:08:17] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:08:20] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[1:08:22] and have committed unto us the word of
[1:08:24] reconciliation
[1:09:18] 17 10.
[1:09:25] and it says
[1:09:27] i the lord
[1:09:28] search the heart
[1:09:31] i try the reins
[1:09:33] even to give every man according to his
[1:09:35] ways

[1:12:05] we we uh adults the older adults
[1:12:10] you're
[1:12:11] you're an example to the younger ones
[1:12:16] so here today i'm going to train a
[1:12:18] subject i've never really entered into
[1:12:20] before
[1:12:28] and it's on reconciliation
[1:12:29] reconciliation amen and um
[1:12:33] so i guess i kind of started been
[1:12:34] studying on that for a little bit
[1:12:37] then i started getting into redemption a
[1:12:38] little bit concentrated
[1:12:40] and i can say what brother branham says
[1:12:43] i'm not going to repeat what brother
[1:12:44] branham says
[1:12:46] but i'm trying to say what brother
[1:12:48] location
[1:13:01] for those that don't know there's a big
[1:13:03] difference
[1:13:05] and i'm going to say what he said
[1:13:08] the plan of redemption
[1:13:10] oh what a plan
[1:13:13] what a plan a plan i i i
[1:13:16] i can i want to say to everyone
[1:13:20] if you've never studied the redemption
[1:13:24] the plan of redemption
[1:13:26] i i
[1:13:27] do it and look into it you'll be blessed
[1:13:34] [Music]
[1:13:36] sorry guys i forgot to give it to you
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:41] redeem means to recover
[1:13:44] recover
[1:13:47] it's like if you have something in the
[1:13:48] pawn shop right
[1:13:51] and you want to take it out you go and
[1:13:53] you purchase it back
[1:13:56] to make amends
[1:13:59] to recover from captivity
[1:14:02] to set free from slavery
[1:14:07] all right now we're going to read uh
[1:14:08] the definition of reconcile
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:12] and this is here we're going to do the
[1:14:14] best we can to to focus on reconcile
[1:14:19] to restore to friendship or harmony
[1:14:27] harmony that's that's the key word there
[1:14:28] harmony
[1:14:31] to settle or to resolve
[1:14:35] now here's another question
[1:14:38] you don't have to raise your hands on
[1:14:39] this one
[1:14:41] you know
[1:14:42] you know you search your heart
[1:14:45] does somebody have something against you
[1:14:50] does one of the youth does somebody have
[1:14:51] something against you know do you have
[1:14:53] something against each other
[1:15:08] oh this brother here oh he did me wrong
[1:15:12] so this so this subject here you know we
[1:15:14] i i i was in in the subject here
[1:15:18] and during this time when the lord gave
[1:15:19] me this this uh this subject this theme
[1:15:21] here
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:37] and during you know
[1:15:38] after we had listened to it
[1:15:40] my thoughts were on that
[1:15:42] and then and then we start hearing all
[1:15:44] that russia's gonna start to invade
[1:15:46] right
[1:15:48] you know so then my thoughts go from
[1:15:49] reconciliation to the prophecies of
[1:15:52] russia and all these other things
[1:15:57] oh and how it talks about the three
[1:15:58] curtains
[1:16:00] the iron curtain the bamboo curtain
[1:16:03] the the the purple curtain
[1:16:07] brother branham says don't for don't
[1:16:08] fear the iron curtain
[1:16:12] or the bamboo curtain
[1:16:14] of the bamboo hear that purple kern
[1:16:19] so i was like i was like lord how did
[1:16:21] how did i go from reconciliation to this
[1:16:27] and uh and then then he began to
[1:16:29] tie it in for me
[1:16:33] you know and i i began to think to
[1:16:35] myself and i and i thought lord why why
[1:16:38] is it so hard for people to be
[1:16:39] reconciled with each other
[1:16:45] i'm
[1:16:46] sorry why is it so hard for people to be
[1:16:49] reconciled
[1:16:52] why is this so hard for people to simply
[1:16:54] make something right
[1:16:58] and i had that question
[1:17:13] to notice myself
[1:17:15] [Music]
[1:17:20] you know i'm not going to stand here in
[1:17:21] front of everybody and stay here that
[1:17:23] i'm here and i'm perfect you know
[1:17:26] you know but i i had the pride
[1:17:35] you know
[1:17:35] pride gets in the way of so many people
[1:17:38] so many uh people of in the church
[1:17:57] we began to get a little bit a little
[1:17:59] prideful right
[1:18:01] oh i do this in the church you walk with
[1:18:03] me i get here the earliest yo yo
[1:18:06] oh i'm the last one to leave
[1:18:08] i say amen the loudest
[1:18:10] must
[1:18:37] i can't point the finger to nobody else
[1:18:51] how hard it is for someone to that is
[1:18:53] prideful to simply humble themselves
[1:18:59] and make a thing right
[1:19:01] so the lord began to work with me now
[1:19:04] he says he says ronnie
[1:19:06] what's iron this eradicates i start to
[1:19:09] think you know in my simple mind
[1:19:12] oh iron is something hard
[1:19:16] you get a piece of iron it you can't
[1:19:17] bend it it's hard to bend
[1:19:21] and he says oh
[1:19:23] pride is like iron.
[1:19:27] and i it was at that moment right there
[1:19:29] when he told me that
[1:19:32] it was at that moment i realized that
[1:19:34] every single one of us
[1:19:39] or some time in the past
[1:19:42] all three curtains inside of us
[1:19:48] the iron
[1:19:59] oh i do this in the church i can't
[1:20:01] humble myself to to to apologize to
[1:20:03] jerry
[1:20:04] yes you know
[1:20:05] uh jerry i don't i didn't do anything
[1:20:07] wrong
[1:20:08] i do this in the church
[1:20:11] one in the church
[1:20:16] always justifying ourselves
[1:20:19] brother branham here
[1:20:22] and the message
[1:20:24] thinking on our way
[1:20:30] we are thinking about our justifying
[1:20:32] ourselves all the time right
[1:20:34] i'm gonna read this as quick as i can
[1:20:36] here
[1:20:37] and and when i come back in a few
[1:20:39] minutes
[1:20:41] my precious wife standing in the door
[1:20:45] she looked she looked and i know what
[1:20:47] she meant when her eyes caught mine
[1:20:54] now this story is when brother branham
[1:20:56] was got into trouble with the taxes
[1:20:58] story is
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:08] they call right they call and he goes
[1:21:10] outside
[1:21:14] she said billy was that just exactly
[1:21:16] right
[1:21:19] you know how you like to justify
[1:21:21] yourself sometimes
[1:21:24] i said oh sure
[1:21:26] you'll see i wasn't in there
[1:21:29] she said
[1:21:30] but you was when the phone rang
[1:21:34] i said but i wasn't in here when you
[1:21:36] when you told them
[1:21:37] [Music]

[1:21:44] she said billy billy are you sure of
[1:21:46] that
[1:21:48] oh i i i said i think so
[1:21:52] and i started out
[1:21:54] and i got my
[1:21:55] [Music]
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:22] can you lay your hands on that child
[1:22:26] the bible says
[1:22:28] in first john 3 21.
[1:22:33] if our heart condemned us
[1:22:36] then we have confidence with god
[1:22:39] that's what's the matter with the
[1:22:40] christian church
[1:22:45] christiana can't get anything done
[1:22:50] because our hearts
[1:23:04] that's the way to be truthful
[1:23:08] and i started i started to pray
[1:23:11] and i seen i wasn't fit to put my hands
[1:23:13] on that baby
[1:23:16] i said sir
[1:23:19] sir i will i will see

[1:23:30] attorney
[1:23:32] i said can i speak to you a minute
[1:23:35] he said sure you'll see but the other
[1:23:37] fellows are done
[1:23:39] i said just stay in your office a few
[1:23:41] minutes

[1:23:44] i went to the room
[1:23:46] i said attorney
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:28] i said
[1:24:29] i wasn't here
[1:24:31] but i run out of the house and run
[1:24:33] behind the house to keep from being in
[1:24:35] there
[1:24:37] i said it's a lie anyhow
[1:24:40] i said will you forgive me forever
[1:24:50] [Music]
[1:24:52] and i could see in his gray gray eyes
[1:24:55] little tears began to form
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:26:03] so just follow me okay
[1:26:05] that iron kern is like pride
[1:26:10] the second turn
[1:26:12] bamboo the bamboo red china
[1:26:16] and as i began to think on that
[1:26:19] the lord comes and it strikes me again
[1:26:26] he says ronnie is it ronnie
[1:26:28] what is china known for
[1:26:31] i asked the sister the other day
[1:26:34] what is china known for

[1:26:44] chinese food
[1:26:46] yeah i just sorry i had to throw that in
[1:26:48] there
[1:26:55] and china is well known for a great
[1:26:58] landmark that's there
[1:26:59] china
[1:27:13] because we're not willing to humble
[1:27:15] ourselves
[1:27:28] to make it right
[1:27:45] i don't care who we think we are
[1:27:48] i don't care if you're a preacher
[1:27:51] the wife of the preacher
[1:27:54] a child of a preacher
[1:27:56] we all have walls
[1:28:12] we talk a lot about the statue of a
[1:28:14] perfect man
[1:28:16] we go from justification sanctification
[1:28:19] of the holy ghost
[1:28:21] and then our founding pastor would
[1:28:23] always say
[1:28:25] then you cross jordan
[1:28:40] and brother jerry brought something to
[1:28:42] my attention

[1:30:41] perfect man
[1:30:45] we want to climb it right it almost
[1:31:13] all these walls of separation
[1:31:25] but there are great walls that we have
[1:31:26] built up
[1:31:28] and these

[1:33:40] walls that have been built up
[1:33:43] and where are they all hiding
[1:33:45] behind
[1:33:48] religion a religious spirit is the worst
[1:33:51] spirit
[1:33:53] he doesn't see though he doesn't say to
[1:33:55] fear the iron or the bamboo
[1:33:59] don't fear the pride or the walls that
[1:34:00] you're building up
[1:34:14] all these curtains
[1:34:16] they got to be ripped down
[1:34:22] sorry around my glasses i can't read the
[1:34:24] time
[1:34:26] how how how people are religious people
[1:34:29] yeah
[1:34:32] we can't even shake the hand of a people
[1:34:33] of somebody that used to come to church
[1:34:37] and we profess love
[1:34:40] we say that we love everybody
[1:34:43] but yet we see somebody that used to
[1:34:45] come to church
[1:34:47] and we see them at the store
[1:34:52] i i know because because i've talked to
[1:34:55] some of them
[1:34:58] you got to tell me that i'm wrong in
[1:34:59] that one
[1:35:01] but we love
[1:35:03] we love romamos before got so loved
[1:35:10] for we saw love
[1:35:20] in this message church i've never been
[1:35:22] searched so much in my life
[1:35:26] this message this message has has been
[1:35:28] the hardest message for me
[1:35:32] because when the holy spirit began to to
[1:35:34] to to uh to show me these things
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:40] on reconciliation
[1:35:45] names came up
[1:35:50] you're a minister
[1:35:55] but you're not reconciled
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:58] but lord
[1:35:59] or lord but but god was in christ
[1:36:01] reconciling the world to himself
[1:36:05] lord i'm reconciled
[1:36:10] it says oh
[1:36:11] no
[1:36:14] this is where i get the essence of my
[1:36:15] message right here
[1:36:19] matthew 5 22 matteo cinco
[1:36:28] but i say unto you
[1:36:30] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[1:36:35] without a cause
[1:36:48] are you angry with your brother
[1:36:53] i'll tell you what church when the holy
[1:36:54] spirit becomes comes and be and searches
[1:36:57] the reins of the heart
[1:37:00] no matter how much you try to justify
[1:37:02] yourself
[1:37:31] absolutely no hiding from
[1:38:00] oh and whosoever shall say to his
[1:38:04] brother
[1:38:05] raqqa shall be in danger of the council
[1:38:08] but whosoever shall say thou full
[1:38:11] shall be in danger of hellfire
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:27] all right so so now here comes the part
[1:38:29] where you raise your hand
[1:38:32] remember
[1:38:33] we raised our hands
[1:38:36] we all looked around
[1:38:39] now here we're here here comes the
[1:38:40] kicker now
[1:38:57] odd against you
[1:39:01] leave your gift at the altar
[1:39:04] go that way
[1:39:07] first be reconciled
[1:39:10] god was it christ reconciling the world
[1:39:12] to himself
[1:39:15] and we're happy with that
[1:39:17] he redeemed us
[1:39:19] and reconciliation goes right with
[1:39:21] redemption
[1:39:23] oh you got it we're wrecked out to
[1:40:07] um
[1:40:09] therefore bring thy gift to the altar
[1:40:13] oh
[1:40:16] youth
[1:40:17] holiness you're trying to steer the gift
[1:40:48] for the
[1:41:01] inside of him well then
[1:41:15] but the altar
[1:41:17] oh we think oh brother i'm going to come
[1:41:19] up to the altar and i'm going to cry my
[1:41:20] eyes out
[1:41:23] that's not the altar he's talking about
[1:41:25] not only the altar
[1:41:29] right
[1:41:30] here we're going to offer your gift
[1:41:34] make it right with your brothers
[1:41:38] and this is this is a kicker right here
[1:41:41] this is the kicker for me this is what
[1:41:43] the holy ghost made me do
[1:42:08] i had to make it right at work also
[1:42:12] for something i
[1:42:18] and i had to apologize for helping my
[1:42:20] family
[1:42:35] i didn't even do nothing wrong
[1:42:38] i had to go and make it right at work
[1:43:34] and there and i hadn't seen this
[1:43:35] gentleman in about three years
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:43:39] so thursday
[1:43:42] and lo and behold here he comes
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:46] i pushed my car to the side
[1:43:49] i asked his girlfriend if he could give
[1:43:51] me a minute with her with him
[1:43:54] and i told him you know what man i go
[1:43:55] this this and this situation happened
[1:43:59] i've been hoping to run into you
[1:44:02] you know you've been on my heart
[1:44:04] and this whole time this
[1:44:16] and i told my you know i'm sorry you've
[1:44:17] been in my heart i know i wanted to make
[1:44:19] things right with you man i'm sorry
[1:44:24] you see brother ronnie
[1:44:26] that's not a good example
[1:44:29] it's just brother ronnie you know i said
[1:44:30] it
[1:44:32] i remember what i remember one time
[1:44:41] if you remember this he says there was a
[1:44:43] brother a cab driver
[1:44:48] he says for some reason he just did not
[1:44:50] like me
[1:44:52] every time i would go to mexico
[1:44:54] mexico
[1:44:55] you know
[1:44:58] you would give me you give me a bad face
[1:45:00] and he said so i purposed on my heart
[1:45:02] before i went
[1:45:07] and i went and
[1:45:09] and won the brother over
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:21] [Music]
[1:45:27] i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to
[1:45:28] finish no no no uh
[1:45:31] it's a small things play something soft
[1:45:34] the simple things the small things
[1:45:36] are simple
[1:45:38] that'll keep us from entering in
[1:45:40] because thou has despised the deus model
[1:45:56] how to treat a brother right
[1:46:01] something soft for us brother
[1:46:06] i'm gonna just jump to the conclusion
[1:46:07] here um jump to this
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:23] like this
[1:46:24] like this my spiritual senses are
[1:46:26] heightened
[1:46:32] he says i know what the voice meant
[1:46:37] it was saying to make things right
[1:46:40] in our lives
[1:46:42] but what i felt beyond strong
[1:46:45] was make things right with your brothers
[1:46:50] or you will not be able to see your
[1:46:52] loved ones
[1:47:06] you know we say a lot of times
[1:47:09] i'm gonna wait for the brother to come
[1:47:11] to me
[1:47:12] i mean the scripture don't say that
[1:47:15] go make it right with your brother
[1:47:18] it says but if you know that a brother
[1:47:20] has something against
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:34] raise your hands
[1:47:44] because nothing short of perfection will
[1:47:45] enter into perfection
[1:47:50] don't let the sun set on your wrath
[1:47:55] the sun sets on too many people's lives
[1:48:01] in other words don't die with habit
[1:48:03] having somebody having something against
[1:48:05] somebody
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:10] or somebody having something against you
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:14] like brother branham said unleashing the
[1:48:15] matter brandon how the man told
[1:48:22] [Music]
