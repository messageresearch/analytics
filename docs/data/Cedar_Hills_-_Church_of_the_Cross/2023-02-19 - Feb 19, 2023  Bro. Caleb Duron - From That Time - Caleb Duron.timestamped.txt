[21:02] well I tried him and I found his promise
[21:12] everything he said that he would be
[21:19] the finest words I know cannot begin to
[21:25] tell
[21:26] just one
[21:29] Jesus means to me cause he is beyond
[21:40] [Music]
[21:48] [Music]
[21:54] is
[22:00] [Music]
[22:05] everything
[22:08] [Music]
[22:11] let my soul ever
[22:18] [Music]
[22:21] more than marvelous
[22:27] [Music]
[22:30] more than
[22:31] miraculous
[22:33] could ever be
[22:36] he is
[22:39] [Music]
[22:50] [Music]
[22:52] to be
[22:54] [Music]
[23:00] I stand amazed when I think that the
[23:04] king of glory
[23:08] would come to dwell within the heart of
[23:13] America
[23:16] [Music]
[23:23] when I think of who is beyond
[23:28] [Music]
[23:44] [Music]

[24:08] [Music]

[24:39] [Music]
[24:53] [Applause]
[25:18] wait thank you
[25:52] okay
[25:53] if I live my life alone
[25:57] I die this way
[25:59] and let's live my life alone well then
[26:03] there'll be no fruit after me but if I
[26:06] fall into the ground
[26:09] under the will of God
[26:11] and I'll bring forth a new birth
[26:14] and in that new bird that will bring
[26:16] forth another one through birth and
[26:18] another with new birth until the whole
[26:21] world will be missionaried gospel
[26:24] preached this gospel must be preached in
[26:27] all the world for a witness unto me
[26:29] these signs shall follow them that
[26:32] believe
[26:34] so if we ourselves then in our ministry
[26:39] and in our thoughts and in our life if
[26:43] we abide as we are we can do it all good
[26:47] we've got to also die at the altar
[26:52] I will live alone
[26:55] we'll live to some denomination some
[26:57] Creed
[26:59] we'll lead to some organization but if
[27:03] we die to ourselves and the Holy Spirit
[27:06] will be spread forth everywhere
[27:10] we've got to die
[27:13] so many today
[27:17] so it is right now that if we must
[27:20] realize that we've got to die in order
[27:24] to bring forth uh
[27:26] uh New Life
[27:29] it's always said so much in this if you
[27:31] want to see me you must die
[27:35] to yourself
[27:37] and then you'll bring forth a new life
[27:39] not
[27:41] not if
[27:44] if you ever expect to see him you'll
[27:48] never see him by some joining a church
[27:54] some book of laws that you keep some
[27:59] Creed that you serve
[28:01] you'll see him when you die
[28:05] and you come to Calvary and are
[28:08] crucified to yourself then you'll see
[28:11] Jesus
[28:13] we would see

[1:28:13] Lord we're in your hands
[1:28:16] all the different things that have been
[1:28:18] said already today
[1:28:21] from the brother's prayer
[1:28:24] when he said we have stones to throw at
[1:28:27] the Devils
[1:28:30] the Lord we're in your hands
[1:28:33] father that we are Overcomers
[1:28:36] Lord that we are dancing on the devil's
[1:28:39] grave
[1:28:42] dancing all over the enemy
[1:28:45] Lord to realize the picture that is
[1:28:47] being taken
[1:28:50] or rather that is being developed
[1:28:55] from the picture that was taken before
[1:28:57] the foundation of the world
[1:29:01] Lord to know that I have died last night
[1:29:04] Lord my God
[1:29:07] and I always stand in your presence once
[1:29:09] more
[1:29:23] knowing that we are standing in the
[1:29:24] presence under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:29:31] that this would be the hour
[1:29:33] but this would be the time
[1:29:35] you make yourself real more real
[1:29:39] than we have ever seen before
[1:29:42] bless these people now I pray
[1:29:44] [Music]
[1:29:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:49] for there is none greater
[1:29:52] can we say amen amen God bless you baby
[1:29:57] do you love him with all your heart
[1:30:00] to the one next to you and say I love
[1:30:03] the Lord
[1:30:06] say do you love it
[1:30:13] amen amen I'll give the Lord a hand to
[1:30:16] praise
[1:30:23] just thinking on the theme that we have
[1:30:25] this morning
[1:30:27] the title of the sermon
[1:30:31] is from that time
[1:30:34] and uh I got inspired
[1:30:38] a few weeks back we had brother Bernie
[1:30:41] Garcia Jr
[1:30:44] he came and spoke for us on a Wednesday
[1:30:46] night
[1:30:48] and the Lord allowed him to do an
[1:30:50] amazing thing
[1:30:53] he forgot his notes
[1:30:56] he had a sermon planned for about a week
[1:31:00] and he realized he forgot his note is
[1:31:05] not that so he went from his job back to
[1:31:08] his house
[1:31:12] put him on the couch
[1:31:14] went and did a few things real quick
[1:31:18] left the house again
[1:31:21] and realized that he had left his nose
[1:31:23] second time
[1:31:26] we come into the office that I have no
[1:31:28] notes it is
[1:31:31] that's all right you're still preaching
[1:31:34] we don't get out of things that easy
[1:31:36] around here
[1:31:38] he looked at me kind of sad
[1:31:41] I said you're not a novice
[1:31:44] don't preaching long enough
[1:31:46] you can do it
[1:31:49] and he got up and preached one of the
[1:31:51] best Services I've ever heard him preach
[1:31:54] but he made a statement
[1:31:56] talking about his father brother
[1:32:00] Garcia was telling him what his life was
[1:32:03] like
[1:32:05] before he met the Lord
[1:32:08] and he was telling him about all the
[1:32:10] things that he used to do
[1:32:13] and the kind of young man that he was
[1:32:17] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:19] and he makes this statement here and
[1:32:23] from that time
[1:32:26] and that just caught my attention
[1:32:29] so this morning the message was called
[1:32:31] from that time
[1:32:34] and so I was thinking on these thoughts
[1:32:36] here
[1:32:38] when we become of age
[1:32:41] we begin to plan for our funeral
[1:32:46] we kind of get romantic about it you
[1:32:48] know
[1:32:50] who's going to be there
[1:32:52] somewhere you're laughing because you
[1:32:54] know I'm not lying um
[1:32:57] write down notes this morning
[1:33:00] you know who's going to be there
[1:33:03] some of you plan to Die Young
[1:33:06] I don't know where you get these plans
[1:33:08] but you plan to die here
[1:33:12] for whatever reason you envision your
[1:33:14] mom crying your dad crying
[1:33:18] especially with you Orlando is a funny
[1:33:20] word
[1:33:24] anyway and uh especially when you're mad
[1:33:27] at everybody
[1:33:32] I'm gonna die one of these days and
[1:33:33] everybody's gonna find out how much they
[1:33:35] love me
[1:33:39] oh man the Lord showed me so much right
[1:33:42] now I wish y'all would stop
[1:33:45] but it's your fault all right okay
[1:33:48] so then we we we we we know what songs
[1:33:52] we want to have sang in our funerals
[1:33:56] what kind of casket we want to live
[1:33:59] if I'm talking to anybody let me see
[1:34:01] your hands
[1:34:03] funeral planners in here
[1:34:06] and uh you know listen my funeral is
[1:34:09] playing
[1:34:11] you want to hear what the plans are okay
[1:34:15] it's one hour of Silence
[1:34:18] at the graveside
[1:34:20] nobody says
[1:34:22] nobody sings anything
[1:34:25] nobody said the preachers
[1:34:27] nobody gets up and says any nice words
[1:34:30] about me
[1:34:32] my thought process is this
[1:34:35] if you didn't tell me while I'm alive
[1:34:39] chance to say when I'm dead
[1:34:46] trying to fool everybody know you don't
[1:34:48] like me
[1:34:49] you're sick say everybody like it you're
[1:34:52] the reason he's in the grave yes
[1:34:57] come on right I keep pointing at gray
[1:35:01] hairs and tell you who gave them to me
[1:35:05] praise the lord we go on planning like
[1:35:08] that
[1:35:09] we buy life insurance
[1:35:16] we buy life insurance
[1:35:20] if I should go prematurely
[1:35:23] first of all God don't take nobody home
[1:35:26] prematurely
[1:35:29] but see in our minds if I go prematurely
[1:35:35] then there's money to take care of the
[1:35:37] the expenses the plot yeah
[1:35:43] the services
[1:35:45] the casket little money for the family
[1:35:48] to live off until they get things
[1:35:50] together
[1:35:54] all of this planning goes into your dad
[1:35:59] but we do very little to plan uh our
[1:36:02] life being uh to make plans of our life
[1:36:07] we don't make the proper Arrangements
[1:36:13] we make arrangements to die
[1:36:16] but no arrangements to live
[1:36:19] and I say this morning
[1:36:21] if we would take as much care
[1:36:25] and stop the premeditation
[1:36:28] of how it's going to be at our funeral
[1:36:31] for how we're going to die or how we're
[1:36:35] going to take our lives
[1:36:37] or whatever it might be if we would take
[1:36:41] more cow on account on accounting
[1:36:44] of how we're going to live our life
[1:36:49] but not just live our lives
[1:36:52] how the Lord could live my life
[1:36:56] foreign
[1:37:56] back into his perfect world
[1:37:59] so God works it out
[1:38:02] but if I could do it over there I would
[1:38:07] serve God every day of my life
[1:38:11] I would have finished high school
[1:38:14] I would have listened to Dad a little
[1:38:17] more
[1:38:18] I would have taken into account the
[1:38:21] things that they were saying
[1:38:23] I would not have missed a single church
[1:38:27] service if I could have been at home
[1:38:30] I would have never got an attitude when
[1:38:33] Dad said let's pray
[1:38:40] if I could do it over

[1:38:48] of my temporary life
[1:38:51] David praise and honor and Glory
[1:38:56] amen
[1:39:01] that's what I would do yes look at your
[1:39:03] idea I miss the days

[1:39:24] of 2023
[1:39:27] you all took care of your funeral is
[1:39:31] without spending one dime
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:38] do you understand that you didn't have
[1:39:41] to buy a casket
[1:39:43] you didn't have to plan out a song
[1:39:47] because every song they were saying last
[1:39:50] night at the funeral
[1:39:54] absolutely perfect absolutely
[1:39:57] amen the story that was being told
[1:40:01] the preacher that was testifying of the
[1:40:04] ones that died
[1:40:06] he said the right words
[1:40:09] correct the right scriptures were
[1:40:11] reading the right atmosphere was was
[1:40:14] said
[1:40:16] and you gave up your life
[1:40:22] you gave up your life
[1:40:25] in your funeral is
[1:40:28] the most monetarily inexpensive there
[1:40:32] ever was of course
[1:40:35] but spiritually
[1:40:38] foreign
[1:40:43] [Applause]
[1:41:14] do you love them
[1:41:17] what's the point
[1:41:20] we've got to die
[1:41:22] if you cannot die
[1:41:24] to yourself then God can never resurrect
[1:41:28] inside of you yes
[1:41:30] how can the Lord bring forth a lie come
[1:41:33] on
[1:41:34] when it's got when your heart is
[1:41:36] bombarded with your own life
[1:41:39] God can never outpour his Spirit on you
[1:41:44] or inside of you while you're yet
[1:41:48] holding on to your own spirit
[1:41:51] is that right yes correct if you ever
[1:41:54] want to make God laugh
[1:41:58] how many would like to make the Lord
[1:42:02] no takers huh
[1:42:05] I'll tell you how you do it
[1:42:07] you tell him your plans for your future
[1:42:12] and you'll get a chuckle out of God
[1:42:18] that's a good one brother Jimmy yes
[1:42:19] that's a good one she's let me tell you
[1:42:21] what you're really going to do
[1:42:24] that's a good one brother Perez
[1:42:28] okay but sit down I'll tell you what
[1:42:30] you're really going to do
[1:42:31] that's a good one young sister that's
[1:42:34] fine you want to be a model
[1:42:39] put down the selfie let me tell you
[1:42:41] what's really going to happen
[1:42:45] Mr America boys
[1:42:50] UFC fighting not gonna happen
[1:42:55] if you want to fight
[1:42:57] get in this fight amen
[1:43:02] man do you love him liaman the purpose
[1:43:05] of dying is so that we can take all the
[1:43:08] spirit of God
[1:43:10] in the spirit of God
[1:43:13] will keep that old nature
[1:43:17] resurrecting again
[1:43:21] the problem with us is that we come to
[1:43:23] an often we'll die
[1:43:26] we'll repent and get right with God
[1:43:29] but within we don't take on the holy
[1:43:32] ghosts
[1:43:34] so what happens is
[1:43:42] that's a total of eight if you can't do
[1:43:45] that
[1:43:45] and now you're in April you're now
[1:43:48] Eightfold the devil than you were the
[1:43:50] first time
[1:43:52] now then you can get down and get rid of
[1:43:55] those eight Devils
[1:43:57] but for everyone another seven comes
[1:43:59] back
[1:44:11] [Applause]
[1:44:59] they don't care anymore about you than
[1:45:01] they did when you were there foreign
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:46:03] yeah
[1:46:04] you're out of the frame is
[1:46:08] oh you were those people use this and
[1:46:12] pictures develop you're like this is
[1:46:14] you know what I'm saying are you behind
[1:46:18] somebody else
[1:46:19] who who's that guy can the system
[1:46:23] you're out of focus
[1:46:25] what God has in mind
[1:46:28] I saw the picture of the church the
[1:46:30] congregation out front
[1:46:33] and you know I look I'm trying to find
[1:46:35] everybody that I know
[1:46:38] but that's what God has in mind
[1:46:40] but in his picture
[1:46:43] everybody is visible for a son
[1:46:46] deceiveless you understand what I'm
[1:46:48] saying
[1:46:49] I go to church
[1:46:53] I'm a good member is not going to get
[1:46:56] you anywhere
[1:46:57] I is going to get you into trouble
[1:47:01] I is going to take you back to where I
[1:47:04] should have never been foreign
[1:47:37] if you could die every day after all
[1:47:40] those days you could be born again every
[1:47:41] day
[1:47:44] tell me I'm wrong
[1:47:46] brother Brandon said even nature itself
[1:47:49] testified
[1:47:51] in the morning the son's a newborn baby
[1:47:56] in the middle of the day it's in it and
[1:47:58] it says
[1:48:02] about 12 o'clock it's in the prime of
[1:48:05] Life
[1:48:08] about three or four and it starts to get
[1:48:10] older yeah
[1:48:13] in its 40s and it's fifties
[1:48:20] but in the morning
[1:48:25] yeah
[1:48:26] is that right
[1:48:28] correct so you need the Holy Ghost
[1:48:30] Necessities
[1:48:34] the purpose of sinning the Holy Ghost
[1:48:37] was for God to continue
[1:48:40] what I threw a bunch of people
[1:48:43] to continually
[1:48:46] manifest God
[1:48:48] I said manifest God
[1:48:51] it doesn't say manifest
[1:48:53] [Applause]
[1:48:55] or
[1:48:58] Amazing Grace temples
[1:49:05] it says continually
[1:49:07] manifest God
[1:49:10] to the world
[1:49:12] is that right not by a Creed not by a
[1:49:17] denomination
[1:49:18] but by the power
[1:49:20] of his resurrection
[1:49:24] see you died last night she resurrected
[1:49:29] this morning
[1:49:30] today many of you will die again

[1:49:37] tell me your backside
[1:49:42] in your eyes again
[1:49:56] over and over and over again
[1:50:00] the power of his resurrection feeling in
[1:50:04] the pride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:24] now
[1:50:26] that's right I guess they're not enough
[1:50:27] black people in here to appreciate that
[1:50:29] one you know
[1:50:31] it's just because the Mexicans outnumber
[1:50:34] everybody else in the room

[2:05:06] I'm glad they didn't take it
[2:05:11] even our own the extreme revelation of
[2:05:14] the message
[2:05:17] the deeper it goes
[2:05:23] no more it seems to just shake people
[2:05:25] off
[2:05:28] I'm not cutting nobody else
[2:05:31] that's not my job
[2:05:33] but I however I have to say it like this
[2:05:38] there are a lot of people falling away
[2:05:43] for them
[2:05:47] but if if I'm being real
[2:05:51] I'm even more happy that I am sad yes
[2:05:56] because I'm standing in front of a group
[2:05:58] of people today
[2:06:00] dead or not going to fall away

[2:07:08] much money we got
[2:07:09] all right do you believe that God would
[2:07:12] uh excuse me to believe that the blood
[2:07:13] would come
[2:07:16] that pure blood that would be a miracle
[2:07:19] like this
[2:07:22] Blood walked over there after
[2:07:26] this place he's talking about brother
[2:07:29] Abraham having children after 25 years
[2:07:31] of being dead
[2:07:36] skip ahead to uh paragraph 101 in that
[2:07:39] same message
[2:07:42] as long as God has got a People
[2:07:46] God has got a church
[2:07:48] God has got the Holy Ghost marching with
[2:07:51] it
[2:07:53] that's what God gave the Holy ghosts
[2:07:58] that's what God gave the Holy Ghost
[2:08:01] foreign
[2:08:10] [Applause]
[2:08:16] that'll move right on with the baptism
[2:08:20] of the Holy ghosts
[2:08:27] and they'll be the ones
[2:08:34] they will be the one it was when I said
[2:08:37] a chaos
[2:08:44] Nosotros you will be the ones
[2:08:49] through their testimony
[2:08:54] testimony what testimony

[2:09:17] My Testimony is Amazing Grace me testing
[2:09:21] on your soup
[2:09:25] I once was lost
[2:09:44] Amen brother Mike
[2:09:46] through their testimony
[2:09:49] you will judge the world
[2:09:54] oh
[2:09:57] I worry about those
[2:09:59] they try to hurt you
[2:10:08] when they stand before
[2:10:10] and beg for their life
[2:10:13] and Jesus looks at you and says it's all
[2:10:16] up to you it is
[2:10:18] I know what I do you say okay but you're
[2:10:21] the one they offended
[2:10:26] have I got an example of that do I got
[2:10:30] some time
[2:10:31] wasn't it brother Brandon said there was
[2:10:34] a couple sitting in the audience
[2:10:37] I can't even fathom this
[2:10:40] and I don't know what his idea of making
[2:10:42] out is
[2:10:45] Let's Be Careful you know what I mean my
[2:10:49] idea is me there he said they were
[2:10:51] making out it is
[2:10:53] what would you do pastor
[2:10:56] and he said he told him stop that please
[2:10:59] don't do that
[2:11:01] and they kept going
[2:11:05] I mean where were the Deacons
[2:11:09] anyway I'm not going to go there you
[2:11:12] know
[2:11:14] I'm not talking to you brother Jeff
[2:11:15] you're all right
[2:11:19] they kept going on the prophet of God
[2:11:23] said
[2:11:27] yes
[2:11:32] without even flinching
[2:11:36] whatever you say
[2:11:39] because the angel okay langel had one
[2:11:42] mindset
[2:11:44] that's wrong they deserve to die
[2:11:48] now whatever you say man of God
[2:12:00] put in the hair yeah
[2:12:04] whatever you say
[2:12:07] in the prophet of God looked down
[2:12:10] I forgive you YOLO
[2:12:13] [Applause]
[2:12:20] you know what you're going to do
[2:12:22] the Bible or brother Brown said that God
[2:12:25] was pleased with that decision
[2:12:29] you know you premeditate you know you
[2:12:31] premeditated this too
[2:12:34] oh don't do it I'll call you out
[2:12:37] you know you sat there
[2:12:40] you said one day they're going to stand
[2:12:42] before me and I'm going to send them
[2:12:44] straight to hell
[2:12:47] if that is your attitude
[2:12:50] you will actually be on the other side
[2:12:52] of the judgment
[2:12:57] I know you'll say you want to really
[2:12:59] hurt people that hurt you I know
[2:13:01] but if you could find it in your heart
[2:13:03] to forgive them now
[2:13:08] you will forgive them there
[2:13:10] you'll never get your reward
[2:13:13] oh I don't know how I got off on that
[2:13:15] that's right
[2:13:18] he goes on to say your testimony today
[2:13:21] will bring judgment against the city
[2:13:24] that our testimony in the baptism of the
[2:13:27] Holy ghosts and the power of God
[2:13:31] he said a holy life
[2:13:34] will bring judgment against this city
[2:13:39] and through that by scattering of your
[2:13:41] life
[2:13:44] he said and the baptism of the Holy
[2:13:46] Spirit about this mother Spirit to Santo
[2:13:48] and by the lives that you live
[2:13:51] and the things that God has done to
[2:13:53] prove that he's moving here
[2:13:57] and with their intellectuals
[2:14:00] walked away from it
[2:14:03] they will be judged by the Saints
[2:14:07] they're already judged yes he's not
[2:14:11] talking about the people being judged
[2:14:14] he's saying the Saints are already
[2:14:16] judged
[2:14:18] and he says and they have passed it
[2:14:27] hey

[2:58:00] Phoenix uh actually my family and I were
[2:58:03] taking sister Anna back to Phoenix
[2:58:08] and uh I started to kind of
[2:58:11] go in and out like this is

[2:58:17] driving
[2:58:19] suddenly my the road was no longer in
[2:58:22] front of me
[2:58:25] and I was told later on that I kept
[2:58:28] driving
[2:58:31] but where I was spiritually
[2:58:35] was walking towards Heaven's Gates
[2:58:41] and I looked at the brother that was
[2:58:44] with me
[2:58:44] [Music]
[2:58:45] and there were some that were in the car
[2:58:48] that were walking with me
[2:58:52] into a car accident
[2:58:55] and we all died
[2:58:58] but it wasn't that at all

[2:59:07] they're all dressed in white robes
[2:59:11] Blancos brother green and his family
