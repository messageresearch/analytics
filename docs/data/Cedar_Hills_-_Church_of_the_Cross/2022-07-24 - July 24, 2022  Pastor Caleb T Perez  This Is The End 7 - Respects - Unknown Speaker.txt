now we find that this boy was the same having these godly parents he did that was right when he was made king and he ignored all the politics and the popular opinions of his day and served god with

our brother proud to say grateful to god thank you for your prayers he he wanted me to let you all know that those of you that were praying for him was done we want to tell you we had a wonderful

time all right you think i should let him off the hook no yeah okay sister stand to your feet would you this is the point you guys don't want to answer just a quick question did you all have a good time oh okay thank you would you all stand with him amen we had a good time god bless the the the youth helpers the leadership teams they my good and my hat's off to them they sure made us proud and and uh wow what some some services that we had in the sermons that were preached and i think that was probably the best i've ever heard brother carlos amen we were very proud and and all the the people that went the young people that went my goodness they all participated and they were very it was as i said i was i was uh very proud to say and we want to uh you know there there are many times that there are messages that you just can't wait to preach and my goodness you you you excited and you just can't wait for sunday to get here yes but then there are sermons that the lord gives you that's that's a little rough easy to preach so this is one of those messages yes and then we have to look at ourselves to see where we are and so if you can be so kind this is this is this is the end number seven and with the with the subtitle respect so we ask if you would turn in your scriptures in the book of genesis the fourth chapter what a lovely group of people this morning all the visitors god bless you it's certainly good to have you in our midst if there's something you don't see you don't see it just quite that way you just put it to the side okay say hello you're eating cherry pie and you come across the seeds you don't throw the whole cherry pie away right put the seat to the side and keep on eating enjoying yourself it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord that an offering of fruit from a ground that god had curse where did he get that idea from the recipient he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel to his offering yeah you may be seated don't close your bibles because we're going to keep on reading a little bit here i can see the story unfold these two young men both of them having been in church ambose i believe adam and eve would instruct their children or the children i should say put it like that but when it came time then to offer unto god their sacrifices their offerings a question came to me this morning and the question was how did they know that god had accepted one and not the other como here's both of the men here they are how would they know that god accepted one and not the other como even i think it's a good question because it's no different today but i asked how do we know that god has accepted our sacrifice our offering sacrificio does we go to church is it because we try to live a good life what is it that that that showed that god had accepted one and not the other ques let's continue reading here and this is verse five now but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell most respected enraged good to have you back brother alexis and your wife god bless you we miss them i know now think about it again he's very roth he's enraged at this moment something happens that makes them know [Applause] why is your countenance fallen marquette because we think that things should have been done a certain way kane was it was the same with him he thought it was okay the way that he was offering or what he was offering to god but when he realized that god did not accept what he had to offer his countenance fell any of you ever had your countenance fall you're happy or whatever and then you a problem comes right in content especially when it deals with your family especially all was even willing to give cain another opportunity i didn't accept your your your offering but if you do well will i not accept [Applause] is that right come on now you and your offering must become one and the same friend i looked at this and i asked the question once again how did they know that god had accepted one and not the other in a message that brother branham preaches fellowship through reconciliation of the blood elements he goes to say he goes on to say this in the garden of eden after they was stricken or thrown and thrown out the firstborn was kane el primo the second one was able and when they both realized that they were immortal think about this they had never seen death before both of them sword atlantis and now they began their offerings for the angel watch now because our god is a consuming fire i can imagine just when that sword went down to abel's when god begins to ask him a question questions will you not be accepted if you do right now this is this is so tremendous as it began to unfold remember cain was a believer but he was a type of the carnal church but abel been a type of the spiritual church god vindicated abel's offerings brother brahm says by the supernatural the same pillar of fire notice this as as this unfolds today there were two things that we find here it said that god had respect unto abel there's the man the person and unto his offering and because of faith yeah the faith that a that abel has he was able to offer unto god a more excellent sacrifice so we find the faith the person the person and the sacrifice the sacrificio and all three together juntos showed and was proven if we provado that he sacrificed the correct thing que sacrifice a perfect god the omnipotent omnipotente the eternal invisible god could have respect to a human being like you and i come on that that that blows me away that god almighty could have respect to a human question [Music] i don't know why this has happened lord do something are you that missing a person and impossible to please god it's impossible come to church raise our hands sing the songs of zion still he does not accept our worship we go through the emotions or through the motions i should say we say oh lord i love you but our life shows something different let's find out something is wrong somewhere that's [Music] that's exactly the problem the world wants to do it their way el mundo his ways are higher than my ways in your ways he offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice excellent romans 12 1 tells us here in this sunday school this morning romans 12 1 says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service but it's you say brother we can never be perfect nobody's perfect we're humans way i can't be made perfect because of religion because i i i repeat and i can quote a lot of the bible do not make me perfect yes that was his respect to god by revelation he gave a better sacrifice the devil comes to church and he's the first one here but watch this now this is it's where we want to get to yeah in all reality a real true respect in the offering of the sacrifice and respect on god's side is the product of an accepted sacrifice we show our respect to god by [Music] i believe god i believe jesus christ how does he show that he's accepted what you believe that's exactly what paul told them chapter 19. from a big mega church we don't have the holy ghost in our church and you say wow it is you know what are we where are we going i don't know where's and when we say we believe god i believe jesus christ god gives you something to show that he has accepted you and your faith okay young people somebody help me let's hope in this i can't you then come on how do you know that god's accepted you this is this is for you all you got to know didn't get something i just saved all because i i felt good at church man that was a good sermon and go back home and be the same person what good does that do this makes you religious but how do you know do you go do you all want to know you want to know my friend how do you know that god accepted you come on god has accepted your your sacrifice your faith how do you know como sabe anybody want to answer algebra part of it he gives you the watch what he says he'll give you the baptism of the holy ghost as a sign that he's accepted your faith brother branham says hallelujah hallelujah the church this morning should say hallelujah accepted your faith now your countenance doesn't have to fall anymore church you don't have to be rough and enraged all the time stand up and give praise to god every morning and every day holy ghost watch as this unfolds a little more yeah kane was a believer but look where that religious spirit had its beginning he brought his offering god had no respect for it what would that do to us today if we after worshiping in church thinking we've given it our all pencil and to know god has not accepted it would make our countenance fall i don't want to be in that condition god's giving us an opportunity to correct those things and i'm grateful for his long suffering remember it was by faith that abel offered a more excellent sacrifice they both sat and heard the same message they heard they both heard what happened in the garden of eden but by the hearing of the word by the word of god faith comes and i like the way the bible says jaime by hearing one message by hearing a message after a message he's coming it's coming from him your faith has grown to whatever you don't even please god i wake up i'm going to say it again faith moves towards you the preacher is preaching right now and faith starts moving towards you it comes by hearing but right now there's a lot of people that aren't hearing people are here in church and their mind is what am i going to eat after church hello everybody i don't have enough money to pay my rent tomorrow you're in church yeah but you're not hearing by the word foreign but sooner or later you'll find out that brother caleb was just trying to save you great you is advancing to you right now there's no reason why anyone here should not have the holy ghost he's dancing to you this morning he's moving praise word of the logo that has embodied itself we don't recognize faith's advances come on you young men you know when you like little like a young girl and you start making a few advances good smile buddy like hey that's exactly what we do to the holy spirit not today i got bigger fish to fry in my life i got all these plans in my career nothing wrong with any of that is a priority over the things of god you'll find out one of these days and when you find out that you're just immortal you'll come and be serious now as we go is that okay if i go on yes faith advances towards you by the rima of god we've got to recognize its advances what shall we do that we might work the works of god believe on him that i said that's the hardest thing as i've said before that's the hardest thing for one human to so we know then that faith can only come by the preaching of the gospel what did cain end up sacrificing a strange offering strange what's happening today strange sacrifices and offerings that god has no respect for sacrifices i'm coming now to the part that the lord helped me okay there has never been a day like today where there is so much disrespect there ain't nobody that that respects anyone we love the pastor because we didn't like how we did things watch this now disrespect is the weapon of the week write that down disrespect yes to be respected a brother sent me this morning they were said they were listening to brother bernie in the 1980s i don't know what message it was said he that he said this i would rather be treated right and respected than to be loved and every person that's all you hear back me you that's the society we live in today is that right yes sir yes coc come on how many of you have ever used that phrase i thought you gave up your rights but you have rights when you want to have rights yeah yeah exactly god is no respecter persons it means something to me don't get me wrong that god doesn't respect because of that god respects on another level because there has been there has been revelation that has come forth james 2 1 says this santiago my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ no the lord of glory with respect of persons nothing faith is [Music] i'll get to something in a moment watch what verse nine peace and persona but if ye have respect to persons [Music] you do things just because you respect her of persons oh like they say blood is thicker than water that's my family don't don't mess with my father are you messing with somebody else you don't want them speaking about my family no kidding cameron let me finish think about somebody else they're all right come on last family when you respect my person not because they come in with all these chains these gold chains and this raymond oh that's that's put a nice place for them here people instead of respecting god's word we are committing sin when we only respect those who are nice to us who only or what good does it do you to love those that love you come on you want to know you cannot love your enemies you can't love those that are talking about you stand up without people holy ghost and the holy ghost shows that you could tell your neighbor i don't believe you're the temple of the holy ghost brother branham says in the message respects before you can have respect you've got to have fear oh our lord i say this morning i perceive that god is no respecter of prayer god is no respecter of persecution well i'm a baptist god is not a respecter of persons personal he wants to see if you respect the one that he sends and as soon as god got his man ready down in egypt you would only be in bondage you would only be in egypt for 400 years they stayed 430. why did this stay another 30 years because they disrespected the messenger god had sent why we're you know in the camp we heard that monday morning that this generation that has risen up is the generation that has crossed over into the promised land which is the holy ghost the coming of the lord only if you and your generation can respect the message and the messenger solos you have an opportunity right now you say well how do we respect the messenger when they laugh at you because the way you dress stand up for what the word of god oh my lord that clock is moving too fast brother branham says that joshua and caleb josue moses side whether moses was right or wrong do you know brother branham made mistakes amigo i am a caleb they knew that god that he was god's messenger and when you talk about the messenger talk about god brother branham talks about a young girl elementary she said but she said i wouldn't give brother branham's religion to my pet cow the next day she realized she was immortal died in agony before brother branham could get there you know says not because she disrespected me but she disdisrespected the gospel preaching okay and that god was working signs and wonders respect the messenger i tell you and yet god don't understand how he deals with prophets a man wrote in and said brother branham or a man that's supposed to have the spirit of elijah and there you are sitting on the bank of a river fishing you know who answered that letter brother billy paul billy paul and he showed it to brother branham who could understand the things of god how that he honors and he respects those men that he sent respect it's a sad thing because you know even ministers don't even respect each other and i say this because there's a lot of people that are online but many times there is no not even no respect amongst ministers much less the that any servant of god that even names the name of jesus christ he ought to be honored for just even naming his name in reverence and respect ain't none of us has a free pass it hits all of us i thought whether you're the pastor whether you are the laity it don't matter breaks me down before it comes to you that's what he says in the message on the name of jesus christ i'm with him whether he's protestant or catholic do the ministers not read this whether he's protestant or catholic whatever he is i might disagree with him upon theology oh you don't see the you don't see the thunders and the tent and everything else like me lost you might disagree upon theology but i want to respect him as a servant of christ and as my brother no matter what he does we've got to give respect to the holy spirit where is that going on come on now pinch yourself a little bit this morning i know it's hot under there jose questa that's not important right now it's important we become very soft in so many things watch what he continues to say continued no matter what he does i got a respect if we could bind ourselves together and give godly respects to god and to the holy spirit and what he's doing in this day and respect every gift and every office that he send into our midst and god will just continue to pour out his spirit upon us we'll grow in numbers and multiply yes you believe that we've got to have respect and when he found out that he was that he was having fellowship with us that man says you be careful with those new mexican people you guys are on the radar he said they preach a man-made system and the minister says have you ever met them an 80-year-old man would think i better not say nothing until i meet them he says you've never met them he said i have heard between three and four hundred messages i have yet to see that spirit there you go imagine a pastor who i've never even met he tried to break the brotherhood when all we've ever tried to do is gather and bring them together there's little or no respect anymore not amongst the ministry not amongst the people but many times you hear things there'll be people ministers that oh that'll come and they'll invite people from the church here yeah not even the decency to call the pastor and say is it okay if i reinvite some of the people i've never i've never stopped anybody from going anywhere i've always said whatever we can do to help tell me who you want who you need i was proud of the man that that they asked as he stood up and says if you want me to go call my pastor s imagine if i were to go and invite somebody's wife to dinner that would be the greatest i'm going to say it again to that man and to my wife that's why there's no respect anymore except amongst the bride of christ lord help me because if where i have failed lord i don't want to fail are you that messianic i haven't guilty of any of this lord forgive 1961 brother branham preaches the message respects what an anointing on that message in 1965 a man by the name of otis redding who knows what about the song respect but two years later in 1967 aretha franklin got a hold of that song aria franken's ass she rearranged a few things she was off to the races find out what it means to me oh yeah here we go okay we're going to get after it huh what happened coming she rearranged what was all originally written for the second wave of the feminism movement in the 1970s r-e-s-p-e-c-t find out what it means to me the respect of the world is not the respect that god requires that's why i'm saying you cannot have respect without fear brother brown says i fear my wife not the way a lot of men fear their wives because if they you know they don't act right yeah to be a stumbling block to anyone i fear the people in my community because i would never want them to think that something i did or something i said to show that i wasn't a christian coming into a godly fear i feared not that i'm afraid he's going to send me to hell no porque advocated for equal rights for who would have women where that spirit would have taken them from equal rights that they were pushing for women they don't even know how to define a woman wow what about all that other we want equal rights you can't even define who it's foreign imagine they they're nominating this this this color lady for the for the supreme court nominees i knew what a woman was when i was who knows coming this is where we live they cannot define a woman but i'm thankful to god that he already defined the woman she is a woman because she was taken from man uh yeah we sit there with a finger in our mouth sometimes and they're like ah you don't know what you are. come on are you serious eden that's where the world has come together but there's a people of god they think a woman was taken from another woman oh my goodness what a shame and our children have to grow up in this world but you're given an opportunity we'll cancel the afternoon service just let me finish this case that's all they're after esto lo que estas the abortion rights and the homosexual rights and all this homosexuality they want the population by reducing the number of children that were born and it's the same way in the spiritual mode where new births are taking place themselves saying we don't have the holy ghost in our church that you shall be saved in childbearing you continue in the faith when they lose respect for the pastor they're done when the pastor loses respect for the congregation come on it works both sides this is the truth that even in the churches yes a church is a woman neglect most people today cannot define a church anymore oh take that one hmm come on now you can't define a church nope because you get together a few of you que porque god didn't call you to do that don't you dare get into that office no wonder brother brown says there's going to be a lot of surprises in the judge yet again there's going to be a lot of surprises at the judgment you're not a pastor because somebody thinks you're a pastor my brother was calling me from overseas brother they're saying that we don't need apostles no more uh god put the apostle in the church show me where he took them out i said i i guess they believe in a four-fold ministry now hello everybody and if you leave your first love you gotta find somebody else to love you lose your first love when you lose respect come on church take that to the bank not when there is respect no controversy the bible says that by faith moses is seeming the reproach of christ greater than the riches of of the treasures of egypt but why because moses had respect unto the recompense of the reward you know what the word respect there means i'm coming around the corner now i know you're tired and it's hot and all that but that's okay coming around the word respect there that moses the word respect means away from everything my love of my life what it means and look again when you turn your side off of everything else put it on your love of your life which is christ we look the people look around trying to find something that they say they don't have to get into their pornographies they'll look at immoral things in morales no you're not looking away from everything else [Music] i've never committed adultery the woman says you dress in a way causes men to lust after you counsel imagine a married woman if he is talking with another man and and get me right i'm not talking about that hey this person you know i i know this person i work with we have to talk about certain things i'm not talking about those things that you have to do in life in orlando talking about when you open yourself up you start to talk to another man that's not your husband another here on social media talking to every i'm not even going to say that statement but talking to everyone not your husband not your wife shame on you [Music] i wonder there's so much adulteries and fornications going on all the time i've never done anything brother but in your mind you've seen it over and over again and the poor spouse is sitting there where are you at on this have a conversation with me no what happens no they've gone somewhere else i need otros i'm single i can talk to whoever i want to yo talking to a married man or a woman come on church not by phone ne por telephone not by social media oh man you talk about devils moving around we don't make the devil uncomfortable then we haven't done our job as preachers and as pastors that's right turn your attention off of other things and give it to christ quite honor the king andrea you know what it means to to honor all men put a value in all men too many times our thoughts you know what our thoughts are really they can and now you begin to form ideas through everything you've heard because all these impressions don't do you nobody you try to help brothers and sisters many times people in the world sometimes are nicer than the ones who go to church hello everybody well i don't even want to give them a job man the way they treat you after they get their job church we have special rights thank you for helping me when i needed help going home and say darling i'm not going to work for the brother no more he was so kind to him for him god bless him not the way things are done there's so much disrespect in so many ways but we're going to heaven hello god never accepted our sacrifice i'm trying to avert that church for me for you i don't want to attack anybody get rid of the entitlement that we think we have because we're message believers full obedience to the word is the only thing that gives you any entitlement it entitles you to the token when you are respectful oh just give me two or three more minutes and i'll just stop here we're living many times
