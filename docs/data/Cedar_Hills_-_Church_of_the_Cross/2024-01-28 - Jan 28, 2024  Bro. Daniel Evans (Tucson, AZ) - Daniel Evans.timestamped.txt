[38:34] in our
[38:38] Bible is the book of The Beloved
[38:41] disciple St
[38:46] John 10
[38:53] verse it says
[38:55] this
[38:57] as the father knoweth me even so know I
[39:01] the father and I lay down my life for
[39:04] the
[39:10] sheep and other sheep I have which are
[39:14] not of this
[39:15] fold them also I must bring and they
[39:19] shall hear my voice and there shall be
[39:21] one fold and one
[39:25] Shepherd
[39:34] amen God bless you you can take your
[39:38] seat one Shepherd and one
[39:42] fold how different that is that that the
[39:45] world teaches us
[39:49] today we've got our little group there
[39:52] in Tucson Arizona and that's part of the
[39:55] f
[39:59] and I send greetings friends from the
[40:01] Tucson
[40:05] Tabernacle Tabernacle I know they all
[40:07] wanted to
[40:09] come but uh we we um we had another
[40:13] brother come in to preach this morning a
[40:14] brother that you all
[40:19] know or many of you know him his name is
[40:21] brother Ryan long
[40:24] Ryan and brother Ryan brother Ryan sends
[40:28] his greetings
[40:32] also we um the excuse that we had to
[40:37] come is we went through a lot of the
[40:40] storage at the Tucson Tabernacle and we
[40:42] have all kinds of message books from
[40:44] brother
[40:49] Brandon so we brought a bunch of boxes
[40:52] with us to give to brother Tommy and
[40:54] brother Caleb to send overseas to ug
[40:58] [Applause]
[41:04] but uh but we kept brother Caleb we kept
[41:07] quite a few of them back so we can come
[41:09] on another
[41:13] trip so we'll just keep bringing them
[41:15] and bringing them as long
[41:18] as there's one thing that brother
[41:20] brandham there's there's a lot of
[41:22] different doctrines about brother
[41:24] brandham and his ministry that that the
[41:26] world right
[41:32] now but one thing that we know for
[41:36] sure brother Bram wanted his message to
[41:40] go
[41:44] overseas and that's something that we
[41:46] can all come together
[41:50] on and it's it's sad that that even
[41:54] though we this should be something that
[41:56] we can come together on Satan has used
[41:59] it as many things to divide
[42:05] us but brother Caleb we are 100% behind
[42:09] you and brother Tommy and what you all
[42:10] are
[42:16] doing may God bless you and what you're
[42:19] doing continue to
[42:22] bless we were uh when I lived in
[42:25] Jeffersonville few years
[42:28] ago when we were all together at voice
[42:30] of God Recordings one one day and the
[42:33] power went
[42:38] out so we weren't able to use our our
[42:41] computer so we all congregated in the
[42:44] largest room in the
[42:51] building and Brother Joseph and brother
[42:53] Billy Paul were were sitting on the
[42:55] table
[43:00] and all of us were gathered around maybe
[43:02] 50
[43:06] people and Brother Joseph tells brother
[43:09] Billy he says Billy tell us a story
[43:11] about
[43:13] dad bil
[43:17] bil and brother Billy Paul said
[43:19] something now never
[43:22] forget he said that I was the closest
[43:26] person to brother brandom in the
[43:31] world he said I traveled the world with
[43:34] brother
[43:36] Brana he said I was always in service
[43:38] with him I drove him around in the
[43:44] car he said he shared with me the most
[43:47] inner thoughts that he
[43:53] had and he said even me
[43:57] brother brandom's
[43:59] son with him all the
[44:02] time he said even I did not know the
[44:06] difference between his friends and his
[44:13] enemies he said he spoke the same about
[44:18] everyone even to those that were closest
[44:21] to
[44:23] him and I still think Lord where is that
[44:26] in my
[44:28] life how many times do I share with my
[44:31] wife or my son when when somebody upsets
[44:38] me and I speak evil even inside the
[44:42] innermost chambers of my
[44:47] house even though those things may be
[44:51] true but it doesn't need to be
[44:54] said division friends is is created by
[45:00] Satan
[45:03] himself and he has robbed God's Children
[45:06] of their unity and their love for each
[45:11] other and it even goes down into our
[45:17] home that unity in the
[45:20] church it starts in our
[45:22] home in our
[45:24] family I tell a story about my
[45:29] wife the Lord blessed me with a good
[45:33] wife I see fear come into her eyes right
[45:39] now I um I like to drink Coke
[45:44] Zero so I would drink my Coke Zero and I
[45:48] would only drink half of
[45:51] it and I would put the other half in the
[45:54] refrigerator to to keep it cold to keep
[45:56] it
[46:01] fizzy and almost always I would come
[46:03] back to my refrigerator to get my Coke
[46:07] Zero I would open the door and there
[46:09] would be my Coke
[46:12] Zero and I would pick it
[46:14] up and it would be empty there' be
[46:17] nothing in my Coke
[46:20] Zero my wife would drink
[46:23] it and she would put the empty can back
[46:25] in the
[46:28] refrigerator and it upset
[46:30] me so I took my Coke
[46:35] Zero and I drank the whole
[46:38] thing and I took the
[46:41] can and I filled it half full of
[46:46] milk and I put it back in the
[46:51] refrigerator she would learn a
[46:54] lesson and my wife wife learned a
[46:56] valuable lesson that
[47:00] day as did
[47:03] I from that moment
[47:06] on from my cero
[47:10] can I drank everything from hot
[47:15] sauce the
[47:17] vinegar the
[47:21] buttermilk anything you can
[47:24] imagine what good did it
[47:28] do me to do that to my
[47:33] wife how would you like to be married to
[47:35] a woman like that
[47:38] for friends it doesn't do any good to
[47:43] fight it doesn't do any good to
[47:49] argue when I when I was in
[47:51] Jeffersonville a brother came from down
[47:53] in Tennessee Jeffersonville
[47:57] tene his name is Tom
[47:59] Jennings Tom Jennings he was an old man
[48:01] and his family went way back with
[48:03] brother braham's message in
[48:09] Florida he he and his family were a
[48:12] member back in the 40s and 50s he and
[48:14] his family were members of the Assembly
[48:16] of God
[48:21] denomination and they had heard of this
[48:24] man William brandham that would come
[48:26] through Florida and heal the
[48:34] sick so his father had had a heart
[48:38] condition so they went to William bram's
[48:45] meetings and brother brandham called him
[48:47] out of the
[48:49] audience told him he had a heart
[48:52] condition and then the Lord healed him
[48:56] but this man was a trustee in this
[48:58] Assembly of God
[49:02] Church so he kept it a secret that he
[49:05] was following this man William brandom
[49:07] around
[49:11] Florida he said because if they were to
[49:14] hear that he was following him around
[49:15] Florida they would kick him out of the
[49:21] church so his pastor
[49:26] his wife was deadly deathly sick with
[49:33] cancer caner so this brother Jennings
[49:35] goes to the pastor and he says I've had
[49:38] this experience with this man William
[49:46] brand he said you need to bring your
[49:50] wife to these meetings and she will be
[49:54] healed
[49:56] but the pastor couldn't do
[49:59] this because the Assembly of the
[50:01] Assemblies of God would always schedule
[50:03] a Revival whenever brother Brandon was
[50:06] going to be in in um in
[50:15] Florida florid in Miami Florida in Miami
[50:18] Florida so the pastor tells uh brother
[50:21] Jennings he says I I can't go because if
[50:24] I if I go there I'll come back and I
[50:26] won't have a church to come back
[50:33] to so brother Jennings says he says I'll
[50:36] take care
[50:41] of so he gets the trustees
[50:46] together and he says the pastors wife is
[50:50] is really sick and she's about to die
[50:53] and they're just it's been really hard
[50:55] on
[50:59] them and brother Jennings knew that
[51:02] brother Brandon was going to be in St
[51:03] Petersburg Florida in two
[51:08] weeks
[51:10] pburg so he gets the trustees
[51:13] together and he brings it before the
[51:15] church for a
[51:17] vote he said the Pastor needs a rest and
[51:20] his wife needs a
[51:24] rest I'd like a votee from the church to
[51:26] send the pastor to St Petersburg Florida
[51:30] for a little
[51:34] vacation P it was 100%
[51:38] vote so the pastor brings his wife to
[51:43] brother branham's
[51:46] meeting they bring his
[51:49] wife up to the platform in a
[51:54] cot
[51:57] strer yeah because because she couldn't
[52:02] walk brother brandom looks down at her
[52:05] during the
[52:07] meetings and he says sister you have
[52:11] cancer he said you're definely
[52:14] ill but you could
[52:16] see but he said let me tell you
[52:18] something else he said you are the wife
[52:20] of a
[52:23] pastor and he says let me tell you
[52:25] something else your husband is on the
[52:28] platform behind
[52:32] me and he says brother Jennings come
[52:35] down here and stand with your
[52:39] wife and he says and he gets him down
[52:41] there and he says let me tell you
[52:42] something that no one
[52:45] knows he says you have cancer of the
[52:48] mouth and he says will you both
[52:51] [Music]
[52:52] believe they both believe brother
[52:54] Brandon pray prayed for them and they
[52:56] were completely healed in the name of
[52:58] the
[53:02] Lord both of them lived to be old
[53:06] people his dad died at 96 years
[53:12] old came back to
[53:14] church and what he said was the
[53:18] truth word had gotten
[53:22] back to the
[53:24] church that called brother Jennings
[53:27] Innings they said you are no longer a
[53:30] trustee at this
[53:33] church and the pastor is no longer the
[53:37] pastor you see the
[53:40] division what if this church would
[53:42] accepted this man with this
[53:47] gift how much would the people have been
[53:50] blessed if they would have brought him
[53:53] in but his message did not line up with
[53:57] their
[54:00] denomination they did everything to keep
[54:02] him
[54:05] out do you see the UN there was no Unity
[54:08] there among Christian
[54:13] people and how much do we see that
[54:15] brothers and sisters
[54:19] today Satan has robbed us of our
[54:24] Unity
[54:26] you have a good
[54:29] church things are going well
[54:32] here I'd like to bring our church to to
[54:35] see this example that you all
[54:41] set but each person each person in this
[54:44] audience has a responsibility for that
[54:50] Unity one person in this audience could
[54:53] destroy that Unity
[54:58] and do you think Satan isn't working on
[55:00] it
[55:02] now seeing the blessing that you
[55:07] have Jesus in his last
[55:11] days he brought his disciples
[55:15] together we call it the Last
[55:19] Supper he he sent Judas
[55:24] away
[55:25] and here are his
[55:28] people and you can imagine the pressure
[55:31] that was on the Lord
[55:34] Jesus he knew that within 24 hours he
[55:38] was going to be
[55:41] gone and these were the people that were
[55:44] going to have to carry on his
[55:48] message so Jesus has them around the
[55:50] table and he's talking with
[55:53] them let's turning our Bible to St John
[55:58] 14 verse
[56:02] 15 Jesus says this he says if you love
[56:05] me keep my
[56:10] Commandments don't read o don't just
[56:12] read over that
[56:13] scripture what are Jesus's
[56:17] Commandments if someone smacks you in
[56:19] the
[56:21] face turn the
[56:23] other
[56:27] if someone steals your
[56:29] coat give him your other garment
[56:34] also he says pray for those that
[56:36] despitefully use
[56:41] you he says bless those that hate
[56:45] you it's easy to bless brother Caleb or
[56:48] bless bless brother Tommy
[56:52] Noah because they you know know they
[56:55] love
[56:57] you but what about those people that
[57:00] hate
[57:02] you Jesus said if you love me keep my
[57:06] Commandments love those
[57:10] people and I will abide and I will pray
[57:14] the father and he shall give you another
[57:15] comforter that he may abide with you
[57:23] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[57:26] the world cannot receive because it
[57:27] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[57:31] know him for he dwelleth with you and he
[57:34] shall be in
[57:45] you what is Jesus speaking of right
[57:48] there he shall be in
[57:51] you it was going to happen here in just
[57:54] a a couple
[57:56] weeks that the same spirit that was in
[57:59] Jesus
[58:01] Christ was going to come and dwell in
[58:05] flesh at the day of
[58:08] Pentecost in the form of the Holy
[58:11] Spirit and yet a little while and the
[58:13] world seeth me no
[58:15] more but you shall see me because I live
[58:18] you shall live
[58:23] also B he's talking around the supper
[58:29] table verse number 28 he says
[58:33] this you have heard how I said unto you
[58:36] I go away and I come again unto you if
[58:38] you love me you will rejoice because I
[58:40] said I go unto the father for my father
[58:43] is greater than
[58:53] I so he's saying that I'm going to leave
[58:59] you but you should
[59:03] Rejoice because the promise of the holy
[59:05] spirit is
[59:08] coming and that's going to be greater
[59:10] than just one man God in one man walking
[59:13] the
[59:16] earth now it's going to be God in men
[59:19] and women spreading the
[59:23] Earth
[59:25] with the same spirit that that man Jesus
[59:27] Christ
[59:30] had and now I have told you before it
[59:34] come to pass that when it has come to
[59:36] pass you might believe you might
[59:42] believe Hereafter I will not talk much
[59:44] with you for the prince of this world
[59:46] cometh and had ha nothing in
[59:53] me he's talking about a spirit that is
[59:56] going to
[59:59] come Judas John called Judas he called
[1:00:02] him a thief and a
[1:00:07] liar Judas may have killed himself
[1:00:09] friends but his Spirit never
[1:00:13] left he is still a
[1:00:17] thief and he steals not only he steals
[1:00:20] us of monetary things but he also steals
[1:00:23] of us of our joy and our love one from
[1:00:26] for
[1:00:32] another but that the world may know that
[1:00:35] I love the father and as the father gave
[1:00:37] me commandment even so I do arise and
[1:00:42] let us go
[1:00:50] ahead so what he's saying is they're
[1:00:52] sitting around the table
[1:00:56] and he says okay let's get up and let's
[1:00:59] go so they get up from the table and
[1:01:02] they start walking down the hill on the
[1:01:06] way down to the to the kidan
[1:01:14] valley and then when they get down to
[1:01:16] the bottom of the valley they go up a
[1:01:17] little space the next way and they get
[1:01:20] to a garden called
[1:01:23] gths
[1:01:27] so as they are walking down this Trail
[1:01:29] the Lord Jesus is preaching to them and
[1:01:32] teaching to
[1:01:37] them and he's trying to build something
[1:01:39] in this is the last sermon that he has
[1:01:41] with his
[1:01:45] disciples and he's trying to build
[1:01:48] something that will stay with
[1:01:51] them John 15 verse 7
[1:01:56] as he's walking down he says if you
[1:01:58] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:02:00] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:02:02] be done unto
[1:02:07] you he said here in is my father
[1:02:12] glorified that you bear much
[1:02:17] fruit so that you may be my disciples
[1:02:22] say and I ask all of us if we just
[1:02:25] consider ourselves Disciples of Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ what fruit are we
[1:02:32] bearing is it the fruit of division and
[1:02:38] hatred because our fruits tell us who we
[1:02:43] are or is it the fruit of love and
[1:02:48] unity let's go to the next
[1:02:52] chapter let's go to John 7
[1:02:55] 1 and this is my
[1:03:00] subject Jesus they got down to the
[1:03:07] bottom and he says okay he says now
[1:03:11] let's close in
[1:03:14] prayer you know how we close in prayer
[1:03:16] in
[1:03:18] service here is what Jesus is
[1:03:22] doing and he prayed over the
[1:03:26] disciples now listen to Christ's prayer
[1:03:30] for the
[1:03:33] church verse 17 he says
[1:03:36] this he says sanctify them through thy
[1:03:39] truth Thy word is
[1:03:43] truth he says as thou Hast sent me into
[1:03:45] the world even so have I also sent them
[1:03:49] into the
[1:03:52] world and for their their sakes I
[1:03:55] sanctify myself that they also might be
[1:03:57] Sanctified through the
[1:04:03] truth neither pray I for these alone but
[1:04:06] for them also which Shall Believe on me
[1:04:08] through their
[1:04:14] word right there Daniel Evans is written
[1:04:17] in the Bible Daniel
[1:04:19] EV and if you are a true Christian if
[1:04:22] you truly love the Lord there are you in
[1:04:24] the
[1:04:27] Bible we are the Fulfillment of this
[1:04:30] prayer that Christ
[1:04:33] prayed that we have heard this gospel
[1:04:37] and we have read what these disciples
[1:04:39] wrote in this
[1:04:45] word listen to
[1:04:49] this that they all may be
[1:04:52] one as thou father art in me and I in
[1:04:56] thee that they also may be one in us
[1:04:59] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:05:01] sent
[1:05:08] me and the glory which thou givest me I
[1:05:11] have given them that they may be one
[1:05:14] even as we are
[1:05:20] one I and them thou and me that they may
[1:05:24] be perfect in one and that the world may
[1:05:27] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[1:05:30] me and thou ha as thou Hast loved
[1:05:42] me thank you brother I read it wrong
[1:05:44] that they may be perfect in one and that
[1:05:46] the world may know that thou has sent me
[1:05:48] and Hast loved them as thou Hast loved
[1:05:53] me
[1:05:54] father I will also whom thou Hast given
[1:05:57] me be with me where I am that they may
[1:06:00] behold my glory which thou Hast given me
[1:06:03] for thou lovest me before the foundation
[1:06:05] of the
[1:06:16] world righteous father the world hath
[1:06:19] not known thee but I have known thee and
[1:06:21] these have known that thou Hast sent me
[1:06:32] and I have declared unto them thy name
[1:06:35] and will declare it that the love
[1:06:37] wherewith thou has loved me may be in
[1:06:39] them and I am
[1:06:50] them amen brothers and sisters
[1:06:55] prayer should mean a whole lot more to
[1:06:59] us this is the prayer of the Son of
[1:07:03] God and the Son of God is praying he's
[1:07:06] he's saying Lord that they may be
[1:07:11] one so that the world will know that I
[1:07:14] am the
[1:07:17] Messiah by their Unity their love one
[1:07:19] for
[1:07:22] another that they will know that Jesus
[1:07:24] Christ is
[1:07:26] God so how important is it for us to be
[1:07:29] unified in
[1:07:33] one and yet we let our tempers get rise
[1:07:36] up and we let little divisions come
[1:07:38] Among
[1:07:42] Us can you imagine Jesus with his
[1:07:44] disciples around praying Lord let them
[1:07:47] be one as you and I are
[1:07:52] one
[1:07:55] we know the
[1:07:56] godhead we have the revelation of the
[1:07:59] godhead we have the father and we have
[1:08:01] the son we have the Holy
[1:08:04] Spirit and we know from the prophet that
[1:08:07] these three are
[1:08:10] one and let me ask
[1:08:14] you how hard is it for you to separate
[1:08:18] the father from the
[1:08:21] son how hard is it for you and I to tell
[1:08:24] the difference between the father and
[1:08:25] the
[1:08:27] son and here is the Son of God saying
[1:08:30] Lord let them be one like you and I are
[1:08:35] one let them be so knit together that
[1:08:38] you can't tell a difference at
[1:08:43] all and this love that they have for one
[1:08:46] another is going to show Jesus Christ is
[1:08:51] alive and here we are
[1:08:55] in this
[1:08:56] day and you have people you have people
[1:08:59] coming in you have the churches
[1:09:02] growing but why is it
[1:09:05] growing it's growing because of the
[1:09:09] sheep that are in in this
[1:09:14] church and the love that they have one
[1:09:16] for
[1:09:18] another the world sees this
[1:09:22] love and that love introduces them to a
[1:09:25] living Jesus
[1:09:30] Christ it was Christ's
[1:09:34] prayer that this is how people would
[1:09:36] come into the message of the Hour come
[1:09:38] into Jesus
[1:09:42] Christ brother brother Caleb told me
[1:09:44] last
[1:09:45] night he said sheep produce
[1:09:51] sheep that's how the people come in it's
[1:09:54] not brother Caleb witnessing out out on
[1:09:57] the
[1:10:00] street it is the body operating in
[1:10:03] perfect
[1:10:06] Unity but it shouldn't be just limited
[1:10:09] to this
[1:10:11] church should be spreading it around the
[1:10:16] world brothers and sisters this is
[1:10:19] important this is the prayer of Jesus
[1:10:21] Christ
[1:10:22] himself
[1:10:26] then this prayer that Christ prayed
[1:10:29] began to manifest itself after Jesus
[1:10:33] died
[1:10:37] resurrected they were scared there was
[1:10:39] 120 of them in an upper
[1:10:44] room the Bible says they were in one
[1:10:46] place in one
[1:10:50] Accord what is one Accord
[1:10:54] they had a one
[1:10:56] purpose they had one thing that they
[1:10:58] were working
[1:11:01] towards there were different people
[1:11:02] there were different doctrines there
[1:11:04] were different personalities everything
[1:11:05] was
[1:11:09] different and what replaced conflict
[1:11:15] before now was there was one Accord to
[1:11:18] win souls to this man Jesus
[1:11:22] Christ
[1:11:24] you see the brothers going overseas and
[1:11:26] trying to help
[1:11:30] people it's something that we should be
[1:11:34] behind it's one Accord we should be
[1:11:36] agreeing on
[1:11:39] that then the Holy Spirit fell because
[1:11:42] they were in
[1:11:45] unity the Holy Spirit fell upon the
[1:11:51] group The Pillar of Fire
[1:11:55] was manifested there in those 120
[1:12:00] people and then they went out in the
[1:12:03] unity of the gospel and in
[1:12:07] love Peter came to the man at the gate
[1:12:09] called Beautiful the first
[1:12:13] miracle man puts his hand out to get
[1:12:15] some
[1:12:17] money Peter says Silver and Gold Have I
[1:12:21] None but the love that was in Peter that
[1:12:24] that Unity of the Gospel that was in
[1:12:26] Peter he looked down on
[1:12:31] him and he said look at us he said look
[1:12:35] at me he said Silver and Gold Have I
[1:12:38] None but I have something that's far
[1:12:41] greater than any silver and gold for
[1:12:45] you he said in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:12:48] rise
[1:12:50] up he said what I have I give to you
[1:12:54] and he gave it to him the man jumped
[1:12:57] up and the gospel was spreading because
[1:13:00] of the
[1:13:02] unity one after the other the the the
[1:13:05] Bible says that the Lord added to the
[1:13:07] church
[1:13:12] daily and we're satisfied with one or
[1:13:14] two converts a
[1:13:17] year we should not be satisfied with
[1:13:21] that more and more Lord help these
[1:13:25] people get them to Jesus
[1:13:29] Christ there was so much Unity that they
[1:13:32] came together again in Acts chapter
[1:13:37] 4 the love between the disciples they
[1:13:40] had one
[1:13:43] Focus they had come off the streets
[1:13:46] where they had been
[1:13:50] persecuted remember Jesus said slap me
[1:13:52] in the face
[1:13:54] turn the other cheek they had been
[1:13:56] slapped in the
[1:13:57] face they had been
[1:13:59] persecuted they came together in the
[1:14:02] group and they rejoiced of their
[1:14:09] persecution that they got to suffer for
[1:14:11] the
[1:14:13] Lord and they were in such unity and in
[1:14:17] such love that the walls of the church
[1:14:22] shook
[1:14:26] they were of one heart and one
[1:14:30] Soul long for that
[1:14:33] day I long for that day to come brothers
[1:14:37] and I want it so
[1:14:41] bad they had it in the book of
[1:14:44] Acts but Satan was not going to let it
[1:14:51] stay he's a robber
[1:14:56] Stephanie and I and the kids when we
[1:14:58] were in Jeffersonville we went on a
[1:15:00] vacation we went just for the weekend
[1:15:02] one
[1:15:04] time we took our dog with
[1:15:08] us and when we came
[1:15:12] back we walked in the
[1:15:16] house and there was something
[1:15:19] wrong there was something different
[1:15:21] about our home
[1:15:24] there was an eerie creepy feeling inside
[1:15:27] of our
[1:15:30] house I can't explain it there was
[1:15:32] nothing out of
[1:15:35] order but someone had been
[1:15:38] there that Spirit of the enemy had come
[1:15:42] into our
[1:15:45] home and we started noticing things were
[1:15:52] missing my daughter had saved her money
[1:15:54] for forever since she was a little
[1:16:00] girl had it in her
[1:16:03] drawer she opened her drawer and her
[1:16:05] money was
[1:16:08] G little things in our home were missing
[1:16:11] that we wouldn't have even
[1:16:15] noticed the enemy had come in and robbed
[1:16:20] us and we didn't even noce notice we
[1:16:23] couldn't
[1:16:24] tell until certain things were
[1:16:28] missing and that is what happened here
[1:16:31] in the book of Acts we see they were in
[1:16:33] such
[1:16:37] Unity they had such love for one
[1:16:41] another but Satan the robber had crept
[1:16:47] in and started infiltrating into the
[1:16:52] church
[1:16:53] and
[1:16:55] stealing without people
[1:17:00] knowing he entered in and he started to
[1:17:03] take that Unity of the
[1:17:09] believer we can see it when Paul writes
[1:17:12] a letter to the Corinthian
[1:17:15] Church Satan had entered in and divided
[1:17:19] the
[1:17:21] Brethren and he said says this in 1
[1:17:23] Corinthians chapter
[1:17:27] 1 he said Paul Paul to be an apostle of
[1:17:31] Jesus Christ to the will of God and S is
[1:17:33] our
[1:17:37] brother okay that word um Apostle is
[1:17:43] important when we go when we go
[1:17:47] somewhere when I come and I Minister
[1:17:48] this church to this
[1:17:52] church
[1:17:53] I am not operating in the name of an
[1:17:56] apostle I come here as a
[1:17:59] friend someone a minister to try to
[1:18:02] encourage
[1:18:05] you but my role is not to bring some
[1:18:08] Doctrine or some division into the
[1:18:13] church but when you operating under the
[1:18:16] office of an
[1:18:19] apostle then things are different
[1:18:23] and you are to bring that
[1:18:26] correction but here Paul is operating
[1:18:29] under the office of an apostle and he is
[1:18:32] bringing correction to this
[1:18:37] church now watch what he
[1:18:39] says now y'all are in
[1:18:43] school take English class is does anyone
[1:18:46] like writing like creative writing said
[1:18:51] no one of the one of the rules in
[1:18:56] writing is don't repeat
[1:18:59] yourself you say something in different
[1:19:01] ways you use pronouns in different
[1:19:06] words but if you repeat yourself over
[1:19:09] and over and over it sounds
[1:19:13] funny unless you are trying to make a
[1:19:16] very pronounced specific
[1:19:21] point Paul not only was a prophet and
[1:19:25] Apostle but he was also a very studied
[1:19:29] and learned
[1:19:33] man and a very good
[1:19:36] writer he says
[1:19:39] this Paul called to be an apostle of
[1:19:42] Jesus Christ through the will of God and
[1:19:45] SST our
[1:19:49] brother under the unto the Church of God
[1:19:52] which is that Corinth to them that are
[1:19:54] Sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be
[1:19:57] Saints with all that in every place call
[1:20:00] upon the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:20:03] both theirs and
[1:20:14] ours Grace be unto you and peace from
[1:20:17] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[1:20:21] Christ
[1:20:25] I thank my God always on your behalf for
[1:20:27] the grace of God which is given you by
[1:20:30] Jesus
[1:20:36] Christ that in everything you're
[1:20:38] enriched by him used the pronoun I know
[1:20:41] pronouns are big
[1:20:47] today but but Paul leaves nothing un
[1:20:50] undone here
[1:20:53] in all utterance and in all knowledge
[1:20:55] even as the testimony of Christ was
[1:20:57] confirmed in
[1:21:03] you so that you come behind in no gift
[1:21:06] waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:21:15] Christ who shall also confirm you unto
[1:21:18] the end that you may be blameless in the
[1:21:20] day of our Lord Jesus
[1:21:29] Christ God is faithful by whom you were
[1:21:33] called into the fellowship of his son
[1:21:36] Jesus Christ Our
[1:21:44] Lord through his repetition he's making
[1:21:47] a very important
[1:21:50] point he's correcting them
[1:21:55] now I beseech you Brethren by the name
[1:21:57] of our Lord Jesus
[1:22:01] Christ that you speak the same thing and
[1:22:03] that there be no divisions among
[1:22:08] you but that you be perfectly joined
[1:22:11] together in the same mind and in the
[1:22:13] same
[1:22:18] judgment for it ha been declared unto me
[1:22:20] of you my brethren by them which are the
[1:22:22] house of Chloe that there are
[1:22:24] contentions among
[1:22:30] you now this I say that every one of
[1:22:36] you sayith I of Paul and I have Apollos
[1:22:40] and I have cph
[1:22:44] ch he says is Christ
[1:22:49] divided was Paul crucified for you
[1:22:54] or were you baptized in the name of
[1:22:59] Paul friends I feel it it's so often
[1:23:02] that we
[1:23:03] forget that the very
[1:23:06] people that these people that we are
[1:23:09] talking to are the very people that will
[1:23:11] one day make it into the
[1:23:19] kingdom and it's the seat of God
[1:23:24] that no matter how this person is raised
[1:23:26] or what church that they're raised
[1:23:31] in when they hear the Gospel of Jesus
[1:23:37] Christ of a living Jesus Christ in a
[1:23:40] personal relationship with
[1:23:45] him that they forsake everything and
[1:23:48] follow after this
[1:23:51] Christ
[1:23:53] Paul right here he's saying some of you
[1:23:55] are saying that you go to this church or
[1:23:57] you're from that church or you have this
[1:23:59] Doctrine or you have that
[1:24:05] Doctrine sound familiar doesn't
[1:24:08] it brother Caleb told me last night that
[1:24:11] he was he was in
[1:24:15] Poland and he told these brothers these
[1:24:18] pastors he said Brothers it's time to
[1:24:19] stop this
[1:24:21] bickering
[1:24:24] and we see we go right back here to
[1:24:26] First Corinthians and they were doing
[1:24:28] the same
[1:24:30] thing do you see the enemy had slipped
[1:24:33] in and
[1:24:38] stolen their
[1:24:40] unity and he's done the same to
[1:24:43] us brother brandom came and everything
[1:24:45] was
[1:24:47] great he pulled the church out of the
[1:24:50] denominational system
[1:24:54] but when he but when he said that he
[1:24:56] said listen he said there are believers
[1:24:59] in all of these
[1:25:05] denomination and we leave that part out
[1:25:07] of the
[1:25:09] message remember Jesus the quote that I
[1:25:12] read the beginning Jesus said there'll
[1:25:14] be one Shepherd and one
[1:25:18] fold and we remove that we we forget to
[1:25:22] say
[1:25:25] that so if you're talking to a Catholic
[1:25:27] or you're talking to a Baptist or you're
[1:25:29] talking to a Methodist and and those
[1:25:31] denominations are pretty much gone
[1:25:37] now except for Mama she's still there
[1:25:40] Catholic
[1:25:42] church but now it's mega churches and
[1:25:45] it's it's different these different
[1:25:47] large churches that are going
[1:25:51] around
[1:25:52] you might be talking to a son or a
[1:25:54] daughter of
[1:25:56] God so use caution in doing
[1:26:02] that Paul said later on when he in that
[1:26:09] letter Paul said he
[1:26:12] said some
[1:26:16] fast and they do it for the
[1:26:18] Lord he said some eat and they're doing
[1:26:22] for the he said some are
[1:26:26] circumcised and they're doing it for the
[1:26:29] Lord he said some are not circumcised
[1:26:32] and they're doing it for the
[1:26:34] Lord he said all things are for the
[1:26:38] Lord so friends if we eat we eat for the
[1:26:42] Lord if we drink we drink for the
[1:26:47] Lord if we're listening to tapes we're
[1:26:49] listening to tapes of the
[1:26:51] Lord
[1:26:53] if we're going to
[1:26:54] church we're going to church for the
[1:26:57] Lord if someone listens to their Pastor
[1:27:01] they are doing it for the
[1:27:05] Lord if someone feels that they should
[1:27:09] stay home and listening listen to a tape
[1:27:12] they are doing their best to do it for
[1:27:14] the
[1:27:18] Lord now if you're operating as an
[1:27:21] apostle
[1:27:23] if I was sent to go and correct
[1:27:25] something I might have a different thing
[1:27:27] to say because I'd be dealing with a
[1:27:29] specific
[1:27:35] group but here Paul is saying respect
[1:27:38] all of these other um angles on
[1:27:44] things and be careful about condemning
[1:27:47] other people just because they don't see
[1:27:48] it like
[1:27:51] you
[1:27:55] if we are truly to love one another as
[1:27:58] Jesus told us to
[1:28:02] do friends love requires
[1:28:06] sacrifice that's the thing that we
[1:28:09] forget it requires a sacrifice for me to
[1:28:11] love my
[1:28:14] children I have to be a good dad I have
[1:28:17] to do things that sometimes I don't want
[1:28:18] to
[1:28:21] do for their own
[1:28:24] good when when they were sacrificing the
[1:28:27] Bible they took the very best lamb and
[1:28:29] they took the very best
[1:28:35] bow and they sacrificed those
[1:28:40] things but they still kept their
[1:28:44] anger they still kept their inner
[1:28:48] thoughts they still kept their money
[1:28:50] they still kept their division
[1:28:54] they kept these other things they
[1:28:56] sacrificed their
[1:29:00] best but the Holy Spirit was not there
[1:29:04] in the individual to give their entire
[1:29:07] lives to
[1:29:10] God but things changed and now we have
[1:29:13] to give it
[1:29:16] all everything that's in
[1:29:19] you including your feelings
[1:29:22] sometimes including your
[1:29:27] religion if you don't see it a certain
[1:29:31] way back
[1:29:34] off let the Lord do the
[1:29:40] work friends the enemy has
[1:29:44] stolen our
[1:29:46] Unity you feel good here brother Tommy
[1:29:48] it's a good place to go to
[1:29:50] church
[1:29:52] the Lord has blessed
[1:29:54] you I love to come and fellowship with
[1:29:57] you all you know I love to be with
[1:30:00] you because I I can feed off of that
[1:30:03] unity and love that you
[1:30:07] have and it should be
[1:30:10] greater so that people if they walked
[1:30:13] into this building they say there's
[1:30:14] something different about this place I
[1:30:16] want what these people
[1:30:19] have wherever you go what whatever you
[1:30:24] do if you're in the
[1:30:27] store there's something about that
[1:30:31] woman I want what she
[1:30:34] has there's something about that man on
[1:30:37] the work
[1:30:41] site I want what he has and then they
[1:30:44] are introduced to Christ the
[1:30:50] Messiah it was his prayer
[1:30:52] PR that they would be one even as Christ
[1:30:55] and the father are
[1:30:58] one I don't believe he would have prayed
[1:31:00] it if it wouldn't if it wouldn't be
[1:31:05] possible it must be possible in this
[1:31:10] day and it must
[1:31:12] happen and we are not there
[1:31:15] yet the Bible says in Matthew 24 the
[1:31:19] very last this this end Time chapter
[1:31:25] it says the love of many shall wax
[1:31:28] cold and we we just live in this world
[1:31:31] like everything's normal it's oh I have
[1:31:33] love but we don't have that
[1:31:36] love we should seek that love brothers
[1:31:39] and
[1:31:41] sisters there is nothing
[1:31:44] greater and we should have patience with
[1:31:46] one
[1:31:48] another if we fail don't condemn
[1:31:54] someone I'm talking about your
[1:31:57] family your supper
[1:32:00] tap your
[1:32:02] home husbands and
[1:32:04] wives don't fill your wife's Coke Zero
[1:32:08] can up with
[1:32:11] milk look over the
[1:32:15] mistakes don't
[1:32:18] fight love the
[1:32:20] Lord say oh this is a this is a simple
[1:32:23] simple
[1:32:25] message then the simple message is what
[1:32:28] Christ prayed for his
[1:32:32] disciples we get too
[1:32:35] technical yeah I know the
[1:32:37] seals and they're wonderful and they're
[1:32:39] Revelation from God
[1:32:41] they they were prophesied to be revealed
[1:32:43] in this last
[1:32:45] day I get it I know I I I know that the
[1:32:50] the the ages in and all of these these
[1:32:53] different Revelations that came
[1:32:57] forward but why is most of what brother
[1:32:59] brandham
[1:33:02] preached is Jesus Christ and come out of
[1:33:04] that denominational
[1:33:07] system far more than anything
[1:33:10] else and yet we draw we still we when he
[1:33:14] left we draw the circles around each
[1:33:18] other and we'll draw the circle around
[1:33:20] our church
[1:33:24] and then we argue with some of the
[1:33:25] people in the church get
[1:33:28] offended so then we draw a circle inside
[1:33:30] the
[1:33:32] church and then we argue with our our
[1:33:34] wives and and fill our Coke can up with
[1:33:40] milk and we draw another Circle pretty
[1:33:43] soon I'm the only one standing
[1:33:45] in is that what was
[1:33:48] taught is that what Jesus Christ taught
[1:33:52] it's not what he
[1:33:53] taught he taught love one another and be
[1:33:56] one in the
[1:33:59] gospel brother brandom T I don't care if
[1:34:01] they're Methodist Catholic Baptist or
[1:34:03] whatever they
[1:34:06] are one in the
[1:34:09] gospel let me read to you something
[1:34:12] brother brandham said in
[1:34:17] closing brother Caleb I don't have I
[1:34:19] don't have enough time to read that one
[1:34:20] quote
[1:34:24] the the second quote is from the sign of
[1:34:26] the
[1:34:29] Messiah listen to
[1:34:32] this he said if Christ is the
[1:34:36] vine and his members of the church is
[1:34:38] the
[1:34:42] branches what ought you to find in the
[1:34:47] church The Works that I do shall you do
[1:34:49] also and More Than This shall you do for
[1:34:51] I go I go to my
[1:34:55] father that's what we should
[1:34:58] find we should find Miracles and we
[1:35:01] should find great signs and wonders and
[1:35:03] tongues and and these different gifts
[1:35:05] that's what we should
[1:35:09] find but what do you find when you go to
[1:35:12] church talking now right down to our
[1:35:20] circles
[1:35:22] we are the
[1:35:25] Presbyterian we are the we are the
[1:35:28] Baptist we are the
[1:35:31] Pentecost we got the
[1:35:38] message we got the message we're better
[1:35:41] than everyone
[1:35:43] else we have more of a revelation
[1:35:45] because Malachi
[1:35:48] 4 oh you know you're out you don't look
[1:35:50] like us you don't act like us we are the
[1:35:59] Elite that's not
[1:36:03] Christ Christ is love because he was
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:11] God have this this will all men know
[1:36:16] that you're my my disciples when you
[1:36:18] have love one for the other
[1:36:25] why would the prophet have said it that
[1:36:28] way maybe the anointing of the Holy
[1:36:31] Spirit was on
[1:36:34] him and the Holy Spirit was speaking of
[1:36:37] times to
[1:36:40] come and the ba Methodist and the
[1:36:42] Baptist and all that would be
[1:36:46] shrinking but there would be a group of
[1:36:48] people that put a name on themselves
[1:36:50] saying we are the
[1:36:55] message let me tell you something I am a
[1:36:57] disciple of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:01] Christ I love Jesus
[1:37:04] Christ and I am proud to say that God
[1:37:06] did send a
[1:37:09] prophet he sent a prophet to set things
[1:37:12] in
[1:37:14] order to tell us not to do those
[1:37:18] things but here comes Satan back in and
[1:37:21] he tries to he tries to ruin our
[1:37:26] unity and he's done a good job of
[1:37:29] it but there's a Remnant there's a group
[1:37:32] of
[1:37:34] people will raise up in perfect
[1:37:38] love and this prayer of
[1:37:41] Christ I believe will come true in these
[1:37:48] people that they would say do you see
[1:37:51] their love one for
[1:37:53] another do you you see how the husbands
[1:37:56] treats the
[1:37:58] wife the
[1:38:00] husband the brothers and the sisters get
[1:38:05] along they're friends and they love one
[1:38:10] another there must be a
[1:38:14] god there must be a Christ somewhere if
[1:38:17] they're acting like
[1:38:20] that
[1:38:21] and that is the prayer that Christ
[1:38:25] prayed and we are coming to that
[1:38:29] time and I want it so
[1:38:33] bad and
[1:38:36] Brethren will
[1:38:41] close and I hope it comes from my
[1:38:46] heart that I want that Unity with with
[1:38:50] everything that's in me
[1:38:54] I'm tired of
[1:38:56] fighting tired of defending
[1:38:59] myself tired of
[1:39:01] attacking I just want Jesus Christ and I
[1:39:04] want his
[1:39:06] people we came last night with the kids
[1:39:09] getting
[1:39:11] together saw all these different young
[1:39:14] people with different
[1:39:17] background just fellowshipping together
[1:39:20] and playing ball and enjoying each
[1:39:25] other can imagine how much it pleased
[1:39:28] the
[1:39:31] Lord how much it would please the Lord
[1:39:33] for us all to act
[1:39:38] out I'll close with this and turn the
[1:39:40] service to the
[1:39:43] Pastor Matthew chapter 22 ver
[1:39:50] 34 but when the Pharisees had heard that
[1:39:53] he had put the Sadducees to silence they
[1:39:56] were gathered
[1:40:01] together then one of them which was a
[1:40:03] lawyer asked him a question tempting
[1:40:05] them and
[1:40:11] saying he's trying to set up Jesus here
[1:40:13] with a
[1:40:17] question so they could get him on some
[1:40:19] sort of a doctrinal
[1:40:25] different Master which is greater which
[1:40:28] is the great commandment in the
[1:40:32] law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love
[1:40:34] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[1:40:36] with all thy soul with all thy
[1:40:41] mind this is the first and great
[1:40:46] command then
[1:40:48] Jesus adds
[1:40:52] and he says the
[1:40:53] second is like unto
[1:40:56] it Thou shalt love thy neighbor neighbor
[1:41:00] as
[1:41:03] thyself on these two
[1:41:06] Commandments hang all the law and the
[1:41:11] prophets so you say well brother Daniel
[1:41:14] that's a simple
[1:41:16] message all the prophets
[1:41:19] messages all the
[1:41:22] prophecies all that they
[1:41:24] said hang on these two
[1:41:27] things love your
[1:41:29] father love your
[1:41:31] brother so was Jesus
[1:41:34] simple Jesus was the word manifested
[1:41:39] himself and he brought this message that
[1:41:42] you love one
[1:41:45] another that you go forward in the unity
[1:41:47] of the
[1:41:49] Gospel
[1:41:51] everything friends that we should
[1:41:55] be is
[1:41:57] love beloved disciple all the
[1:42:03] disciples they preached
[1:42:05] love especially John he said love one
[1:42:09] another he says little children love one
[1:42:14] another and that's what we should be
[1:42:19] doing
[1:42:21] you love you
[1:42:22] all I'm grateful friends I'm grateful
[1:42:26] for
[1:42:27] friends I'm grateful that when I when I
[1:42:30] come in I see the young people and they
[1:42:31] came to greet
[1:42:34] me brother Diego feels so
[1:42:37] good you just feel that
[1:42:41] love and that's the greatest message
[1:42:43] that we could ever preach to
[1:42:46] any if we greet each other in love and
[1:42:49] we love one another and we lift each
[1:42:51] other
[1:42:54] up the Bible says that those of us which
[1:42:57] are strong should bear the in Bear the
[1:43:00] infirmities of those that are
[1:43:04] weak for one another love one
[1:43:08] another the enemy comes in and he steals
[1:43:10] our
[1:43:13] love he steals the unity of the
[1:43:19] Gospel brothers and
[1:43:22] sisters God bless
[1:43:38] you so when the anger Rises
[1:43:41] up when you get
[1:43:44] offended remember that this Unity starts
[1:43:47] right
[1:43:49] here and it can start here and it can
[1:43:55] spread you ever throw a
[1:44:02] rock you throw it out there and then the
[1:44:05] makes a Big Splash in the
[1:44:09] middle and the ripples just go out from
[1:44:12] that
[1:44:14] middle it could be from one person in
[1:44:16] this
[1:44:18] church that that's starts and that unity
[1:44:22] and that love
[1:44:28] spreads and I pray that I'm part of
