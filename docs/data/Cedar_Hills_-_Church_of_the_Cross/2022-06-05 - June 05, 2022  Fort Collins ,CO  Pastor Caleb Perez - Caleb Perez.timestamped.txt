[1:01:09] and i want to read verse 3 and then
[1:01:11] we'll go to verse 4 and then 14.
[1:01:16] and i've been hitting a few series a few
[1:01:18] messages on this series
[1:01:48] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[1:01:51] the disciples came unto him privately
[1:01:54] saying tell us
[1:01:56] when shall these things be
[1:01:59] that is when one stone shall not be left
[1:02:01] upon another
[1:02:02] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:02:06] and of the end of the world
[1:02:15] is
[1:02:28] amen may god add his blessings to the
[1:02:30] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:02:46] i
[1:02:49] many times it is a word that brings a
[1:02:51] lot of fear into people
[1:02:56] the bible is full of phrases
[1:02:59] that talks about the last
[1:03:11] and each one of those phrases deals with
[1:03:13] time
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:55] the more the moment we see pandemic
[1:04:06] [Music]
[1:04:35] we do not have the knowledge the wisdom
[1:04:38] of what these words
[1:05:06] which simply
[1:05:20] how many of you have doomsday phobias
[1:05:24] if you hear the end of the world oh my
[1:05:25] god
[1:05:27] your palms get sweaty
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:33] oh you get a little nervous is there
[1:05:36] anybody here
[1:05:37] you watch you watch too much cnn and
[1:05:40] what happens
[1:05:42] oh you start to go crazy
[1:05:44] you become like a neurotic
[1:05:47] my goodness we're at the end
[1:05:50] but let me tell you without
[1:05:51] understanding
[1:05:54] without knowledge
[1:05:56] it will destroy us
[1:05:59] yes sir yes yoshi hosea 4 6 says this
[1:06:03] jose
[1:06:04] my people are destroyed
[1:06:08] because of world war two
[1:06:14] my people are destroyed
[1:06:31] that nobody says it says my peoples are
[1:06:33] destroyed for lack of knowledge
[1:06:38] without knowledge of what is happening
[1:06:42] or what is going to happen
[1:06:59] us neurotic
[1:07:01] it makes us so
[1:07:04] nervous
[1:07:06] it gets us to feeling a certain way
[1:07:08] paranoid
[1:07:11] depressed and everything else
[1:07:27] happened
[1:07:29] what is happening
[1:07:31] and we must know what is going on
[1:07:34] when we know what's going to happen
[1:07:37] there's one thing for sure
[1:07:40] we will not
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:08:04] [Music]
[1:08:08] that right i mean
[1:08:10] there's a lot of people out there
[1:08:13] there's a lot of preachers which is
[1:08:15] pretty cool there's a lot of so-called
[1:08:16] prophets
[1:08:18] there's a lot of people out there
[1:08:21] jesus simply is telling you
[1:08:24] take heed that no man
[1:08:28] you're going to hear of wars
[1:08:31] and rumors of war
[1:08:34] but see that you'd be not troubled bro
[1:09:03] and the gospel of the kingdom
[1:09:07] shall be preached
[1:09:09] in all the world for a witness
[1:09:13] unto all nations
[1:09:16] and then the end will come
[1:09:20] now i have to get this and make sure
[1:09:22] that you understand me where i'm going
[1:09:26] because i often associated
[1:09:29] verse three
[1:09:31] where it says
[1:09:33] and what's the sign of the coming and of
[1:09:36] the end of the world
[1:09:40] but in verse 14
[1:09:43] and then shall the end
[1:09:46] says
[1:10:01] and the more i looked at that the more i
[1:10:03] realized that that's not true
[1:10:06] those are two different words
[1:10:10] but it talks about the end of the world
[1:10:13] the greek word is
[1:10:41] one thing is the end of the world
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:56] okay we begin everybody got that so far
[1:11:01] we want to learn this morning
[1:11:03] in revelations 1 8 an apocalypse
[1:11:06] jesus simply is saying this
[1:11:09] jesus implemented he says we know the
[1:11:10] scribe was was john
[1:11:13] juan but these words are jesus speaking
[1:11:16] jesus
[1:11:19] and i am omega omega ah
[1:11:22] tell your neighbor
[1:11:37] why are we fearful of them
[1:12:15] because to see jesus christ in
[1:12:17] everything
[1:12:19] in spanish brother henry help us out in
[1:12:21] espanol he says i am alpha you say
[1:12:25] omega ah
[1:12:28] there we go
[1:12:29] now yo soy el
[1:12:32] masculine alpha et alpha
[1:13:30] as the time
[1:14:13] but because we're creatures of time
[1:14:17] we are finished
[1:14:19] we always think of it oh my gosh the end
[1:14:21] of the world
[1:14:23] disaster
[1:14:25] it's the end of all things
[1:14:40] what the bible says
[1:14:43] he that endureth
[1:14:45] unto the end
[1:14:48] it doesn't say he that endureth to the
[1:14:50] end of the world
[1:14:52] it says he that endureth unto thee
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:08] look established he that endureth unto
[1:15:12] the goal
[1:15:15] that endureth unto the point that is
[1:15:17] aimed at well
[1:15:21] he that endureth unto the end result
[1:15:26] he that endureth until the fulfillment
[1:15:29] of prophets
[1:15:35] until the supreme end of god's plan in
[1:15:38] man is finished
[1:15:43] the same
[1:15:44] shall be saved
[1:15:46] what is the end result
[1:15:49] that is that that is my subtitles
[1:15:57] we don't have an and church no tenemos
[1:16:00] pin iglesia listen to me
[1:16:02] we don't have an end
[1:16:09] come on
[1:16:11] you know the greatest spirit that there
[1:16:14] is
[1:16:16] in a church
[1:16:17] the greatest bad spirit i should say
[1:16:20] in the church
[1:16:22] can somebody tell me what it is
[1:16:29] no no what is it
[1:16:40] that should be the spirit that should be
[1:16:42] cast out yes
[1:16:45] you know why because in every church you
[1:16:48] get a a little bit of a religious spirit
[1:16:51] the spiritual relationship
[1:16:53] i've been in the message my whole life
[1:16:57] but do you have an expected
[1:17:13] well i'm a child of one of the one of
[1:17:15] the preachers
[1:17:20] a religious spirit will tell you that
[1:17:22] you're okay
[1:17:26] but when the power of almighty
[1:17:56] you're not getting it
[1:17:58] no i want to make sure you get it
[1:18:01] you gotta know
[1:18:03] i'm not sitting in church my whole life

[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:06] i want you to get this because this is
[1:21:07] important
[1:21:09] once again they asked about the end of
[1:21:10] the world
[1:21:13] but he answers them by pointing them to
[1:21:15] the end
[1:21:18] in other words
[1:21:20] who himself
[1:21:22] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:21:25] no that's the seventh still
[1:21:35] you want to know what will be the sign
[1:21:37] of my coming
[1:21:40] he's telling you this
[1:21:41] when the full
[1:21:43] perfect
[1:21:45] complete word
[1:21:48] has been restored
[1:21:51] preach for a witness
[1:21:54] then the
[1:22:08] the end is
[1:22:36] or only through the preaching of the
[1:22:38] gospel of this kingdom
[1:22:41] being preached in all the world
[1:22:44] can a universal bride be made right
[1:22:49] it is christ in her that is
[1:23:04] how many know that god will that god he
[1:23:07] he wants the best for you
[1:23:11] tell your neighbor
[1:23:12] god wants the best
[1:23:23] god has a strategy
[1:23:26] and his strategy is to fulfill his plan
[1:23:29] he has the computers to plan i want to
[1:23:31] know how many of you are in his plan
[1:23:32] what
[1:23:37] in the message perfect faith by perfect
[1:23:39] weakness
[1:23:45] god's strategy is to take empty
[1:23:48] human
[1:23:49] vessels
[1:23:53] and shake the world with them
[1:23:57] oh hallelujah
[1:24:00] oh my goodness
[1:24:03] i want to know how many empty vessels
[1:24:05] are here
[1:24:10] when's the last time you shook the world
[1:24:16] religious spirit you says you're doing
[1:24:17] okay
[1:24:20] yeah you preach
[1:24:22] you're okay
[1:24:23] i'm not looking for that you know
[1:24:26] i want to shake the world
[1:25:14] at pentecost what did he do
[1:25:16] it taken them 10 days to get all emptied
[1:25:20] out
[1:25:24] and the religious spirit in the church
[1:25:26] says you don't need to do that
[1:25:31] you don't need to fast
[1:25:33] get yourself ready
[1:25:34] you're okay lesbian you'll be fine until
[1:25:37] the coming of the lord
[1:26:04] there's a religious spirit
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:09] and that religious spirit can blow both
[1:26:11] ways
[1:26:14] because they can tell you that you're
[1:26:16] okay
[1:26:18] or it can also tell you
[1:26:20] you're not good enough
[1:26:34] i
[1:26:47] let's see where this takes us
[1:26:51] as we continue reading here
[1:26:53] took him 10 days to get all emptied out
[1:26:57] they was all standing there with their
[1:26:58] vessels turned up
[1:27:02] god
[1:27:15] you might say well brother they died
[1:27:18] natural death
[1:27:21] the natural day
[1:27:23] of course
[1:27:24] but they came through to an expectation
[1:27:30] they weren't looking what was going to
[1:27:31] happen to this body
[1:27:34] they knew
[1:27:36] that by giving themselves completely
[1:27:39] over to christ
[1:27:41] they knew what their end would be
[1:27:45] i find people struggling with that so
[1:27:48] much
[1:27:50] i don't know what my end is going to be
[1:27:53] wait a minute
[1:27:55] in the gospel of saint thompson
[1:28:26] he said in the place of the beginning
[1:28:28] of the principle it is the place of the
[1:28:30] enemy
[1:28:35] i don't know if you got that or not i'm
[1:28:37] going to say it again this isn't the
[1:28:38] face of the beginning of the principle
[1:28:55] come on now it's time to not play church
[1:28:57] anymore

[2:00:36] in all that paul had done for the that
[2:00:38] he thought he was

[2:01:09] the other course
[2:01:10] he was a pharisee of pharisees
[2:01:15] didn't know for sure what his end would

[2:01:40] i have finished
[2:01:42] my
[2:01:43] course
[2:01:47] i have kept
[2:02:15] but when i emptied myself
[2:02:28] means that it has limits and boundaries

[2:02:36] finish
[2:02:40] once again
[2:02:43] comes from the same root
[2:02:47] and here's paul saying
