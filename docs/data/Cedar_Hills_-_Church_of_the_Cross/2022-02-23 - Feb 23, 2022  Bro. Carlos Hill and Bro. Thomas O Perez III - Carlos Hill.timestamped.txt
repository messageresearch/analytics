[25:39] we can have an opportunity to rise up on
[25:42] the wings of eagles tonight
[25:46] it's the eagle that thrives on a night
[25:48] like tonight
[25:54] because he raises up on the winds
[25:58] it's an ideal time for him to be in the
[26:01] air flying
[26:05] because he can go higher and higher and
[26:07] higher
[26:30] and i i i
[26:33] have this cool echo i don't know where
[26:35] it's coming from but it's awesome
[26:51] i i i was was kind of struggling trying
[26:53] to get my thoughts together
[26:59] different different things and and and
[27:00] this is this is where the lord took us
[27:02] so we'll go down that road
[27:13] casting all your care upon him
[27:16] for he careth for you
[27:17] enchanted
[27:30] but i i
[27:32] i was i was of course and you have to be
[27:35] uh hiding under a rock
[27:40] to not
[27:42] look around in the world and see all the
[27:44] turmoil and things going on
[28:00] and there's wars and rumors of wars
[28:05] and there's all these different things
[28:06] going on
[28:10] and it and it
[28:11] it causes us to to
[28:14] to maybe sometimes be concerned be
[28:16] panicked be afraid
[28:22] and as a believer you you want to try to
[28:24] to
[28:25] to look at the different things
[28:31] and i find my conversations more and
[28:33] more i have that sometimes with brother
[28:35] enzo or brother jimmy
[28:38] lorenzo romano
[28:40] and you're trying to understand how the
[28:42] different things in the world that are
[28:44] happening
[28:48] how do they how do they how will they
[28:50] play out
[28:53] how does it fit into god's plan of
[28:55] according to what brother branham
[29:11] where where am i at in my spiritual walk
[29:16] where am i at with the lord
[29:19] am i am i ready for him to come
[29:23] the hour is
[29:39] to figure out where we're at
[29:44] and and i wanted i want to take it
[29:46] tonight a little bit along the lines of
[29:48] a message that our apostle preached
[29:53] and he preached the message entitled the
[29:55] formula of life
[29:59] and and as i as i hear that message
[30:04] and and i hear him and he starts off and
[30:07] and he starts looking at and analyzing
[30:09] science
[30:14] and and and he looks at science and he
[30:16] says you know i marvel at science
[30:19] behind
[30:20] my
[30:22] because even though science is a
[30:24] perversion of god
[30:28] it it shows something
[30:32] and what it shows
[30:34] is
[30:48] i
[31:04] but you find out they don't look back
[31:06] they don't go back
[31:10] they keep moving forward
[31:14] they said that automobiles would travel
[31:16] at such a speed
[31:21] that if they had a head-on collision
[31:29] well they would just pass right through
[31:30] each other
[31:33] they couldn't imagine a day
[31:37] where cars would do 200 miles an hour
[31:42] but we have production cars that will do
[31:44] that all day
[31:53] is constantly trying to come up with
[31:56] different explanations
[32:07] [Music]
[32:12] they never consider it a mistake
[32:16] science will look at something that they
[32:17] said
[32:20] and they'll say you know what that was a
[32:22] learning opportunity
[32:25] we didn't get that quite right but you
[32:27] know what
[32:29] it's not a negative
[32:31] negative
[32:34] so when i i start to look at my own life
[32:39] and and i find myself many times
[32:44] struggling with a lot of regrets
[32:49] and i hope you don't mind that i get a
[32:51] little bit personal tonight
[32:53] [Music]
[33:00] [Music]
[33:03] and i've been working through a whole
[33:05] bunch of things that are going on in my
[33:07] head
[33:12] and everything that i go through i keep
[33:14] coming back to the same thing
[33:20] i made a mistake at this point
[33:26] and then i and i come back and i go if i
[33:28] could just make a different decision
[33:35] if i if i would have just approached
[33:36] this situation from a different way
[33:42] if i could have just known this
[33:44] information when i made this decision
[33:49] then i could have been i could have been
[33:51] in a better situation
[33:54] and and every time i do that
[33:59] i add something that i carry
[34:04] and i continue to carry these things
[34:09] so every time forgive me but every time
[34:11] i i make a decision or i i look back
[34:17] i start carrying things
[34:22] and after a while the spas in tiempo
[34:25] i start learning something that the
[34:27] human being can do
[34:32] that we were never meant to do it
[34:38] and that is to function
[34:42] in dysfunction
[34:46] functionality
[35:10] maybe something happened that maybe
[35:12] someone offended me
[35:14] i'll give me
[35:18] and at every time that i carry that
[35:21] cargo esto then then then something else
[35:24] happens and i add some more
[35:26] alcohol
[35:29] and i'm carrying all of this
[35:32] dysfunction
[35:36] and and i'm still able to kind of
[35:38] function
[35:42] you ever you ever had your hands full or
[35:44] maybe you're you're making food or
[35:46] something and you need to like swipe the
[35:48] page on your tablet
[35:49] or your phone
[35:54] who's ever used your nose
[36:09] and every day that we operate and then
[36:12] we move forward and then we go and and
[36:15] maybe maybe maybe something bad happens
[36:17] with our finances
[36:23] maybe we're not where we thought we
[36:25] should be in life
[36:30] maybe maybe we've been hurt by our
[36:33] family
[36:36] maybe we've been hurt by our friends
[36:38] kisa
[36:41] maybe the people that are closest to us
[36:43] have abandoned us and hurt us
[36:51] and we carry dysfunction this function
[36:56] and i come to service on sundays
[36:59] domingo on wednesdays
[37:02] the song leader says raise your hands
[37:18] because god forbid i lose any
[37:47] that anger a lot of times is what fills
[37:49] the voids that i have yes
[37:53] and it keeps me safe
[37:57] i won't let that go
[38:00] there's no way i'm going to let that go
[38:02] you know where the hell is
[38:16] science
[38:18] and science has no regrets
[38:23] they don't look back on mistakes
[38:27] so why do we enthusiastic
[39:11] because i'm full of dysfunctional
[39:41] and the lord says
[39:44] that's not for you to carry yes
[39:48] my will is not for you to carry that
[39:54] but it's your choice
[39:57] and so he steps back
[40:00] this is all right
[40:06] pretty soon
[40:08] my arms are getting tired
[40:12] and something really weird happens right
[40:14] about that time
[40:17] because about that time you can't carry
[40:19] anything else
[40:22] one of these guys drops off you know
[40:25] and we spend more time going after that
[40:28] one thing
[40:33] and then we associate
[40:36] with with people and things
[40:39] thank you brother for bringing back my
[40:41] my back
[40:44] to me
[40:48] and we have friends that'll bring that
[40:50] right back to us
[41:46] and this is my new formula
[41:49] formula
[41:50] there's a formula
[41:52] that they talk about
[41:53] formula
[41:55] called the formula of frustration the
[41:58] formula
[41:59] you ever been frustrated
[42:03] the formula for frustration looks like
[42:05] this
[42:06] frustration
[42:08] fabricated expectations
[42:10] expectations
[42:12] plus failed realities must
[42:42] i made that up
[42:43] [Music]
[42:45] that giant mansion i'm supposed to live
[42:49] okay
[42:51] i i made that up
[42:53] yo
[42:54] but guess what people saw this game
[43:03] and i live in a two-bedroom apartment
[43:08] and i look at god
[43:10] and i'm frustrated
[43:14] lord i don't understand
[43:17] i don't get it
[43:19] why am i not where i'm supposed to be
[43:24] when the reality of it is
[43:26] you're exactly where he wants you to be
[43:30] done
[43:32] but because we've fabricated so much
[43:35] reality
[43:38] which is why reality tv is so dangerous
[43:41] what was that really reality tv
[43:46] social media is so dangerous
[43:51] because it's fabricated reality
[44:54] [Music]
[45:17] and i find out that the bible
[45:20] in cuento calabria is full of these
[45:22] formulas
[45:25] and they're beautiful formulas
[45:29] you see the formula for life the formula
[45:33] is simply the new birth
[45:37] that's the formula for life
[45:40] but how can i get to that place
[45:47] you see because the new birth you got to
[45:49] be able to embrace it with everything
[45:51] you got okay
[45:55] but i can't even free up my arms to
[45:57] raise my hands
[46:11] that's the formula for baptism this is
[46:14] the formula
[46:15] you see the formula for baptism
[46:19] you take john 3 5
[46:22] and you add first peter 1 22. again
[46:28] and then you add some
[46:30] just a little bit of john 3 1.
[46:34] and a whole bunch of first corinthians
[46:36] 15 51.
[46:40] you know and what you get is baptism
[46:43] ilocus
[46:45] but then i find out
[46:48] that there's even more formulas
[46:51] and i find the formula
[46:54] formula and i find the formula for
[46:56] letting go ayola formula
[46:59] and i find that the formula for letting
[47:01] go is in first john 1.
[47:26] [Applause]
[48:04] just as if i never made those mistakes
[48:09] as if i never made those decisions
[48:14] because i understand but continue
[48:17] i'm not where i want to be you
[48:46] and we receive the baptism of the holy
[48:48] spirit
[48:51] baptism upon baptism baptism is talking
[48:54] about israel and it becomes line upon
[48:56] lying
[48:58] precept upon
[49:14] where i can understand the next formula
[49:20] which is the formula for the way that a
[49:22] man is placed in the body
[49:27] i find the formula for the perfection of
[49:29] the saints
[49:32] and i go to ephesians 4 11.
[49:35] oh and the bible tells me
[49:38] oh and he gave someone
[49:41] anybody
[51:09] [Music]
[51:32] [Music]
[51:48] me and brother jim have been talking
[51:49] about
[51:53] the ascension of the beast
[51:57] from the bottomless pit del posto
[52:00] we know that he goes into the pit
[52:30] i
[53:12] drawing
[53:25] he begins to draw the attention to
[53:28] himself
[53:30] nations and people are looking for an
[53:33] answer
[53:36] but they can't come together under
[53:38] politics
[54:20] it won't come under under this ideology
[54:51] but i like what our pastor said in the
[54:53] office
[54:56] he said you see the difference
[55:00] the difference between when he went into
[55:03] the bottomless pit
[55:18] never in the history of the world
[55:22] has had to deal with
[55:25] with manifested sons of god
[55:29] he's never had to come up against that
[55:32] and
[55:45] he's never come up against the force
[56:00] it's the formula of life
[56:04] as we begin to draw nigh unto the lord
[56:10] and time begins to close down
[56:27] and i look and i look around
[56:32] and i see all the things that our
[56:34] apostle talked about
[56:38] and i hear his messages
[56:41] and i think to myself logo
[56:44] lord senor
[56:47] i feel that yo
[56:51] i can see in myself
[56:55] the manifestation of a
[57:08] and it's the question is simply this
[57:39] i got the dismissal prayer

[59:39] [Applause]
[59:43] i'm going to ask you to please stand for
[59:44] the reading of the word
[59:50] and i'm going to take the line that our
[59:51] that our pastor gave to our young people
[59:53] this year
[59:58] it's found in the book of second timothy
[1:00:03] chapter 1 and verse 6
[1:00:08] it says wherefore i put thee
[1:00:10] in remembrance that thou stir up the
[1:00:13] gift of god
[1:00:15] which is in thee by the putting on of my
[1:00:18] hands
[1:00:26] may god add his blessings to the reading
[1:00:28] of the word you may be seated
[1:00:32] i i want each one of you to look at each
[1:00:35] other maybe just turn around and look at
[1:00:36] your neighbor
[1:00:39] and and i want you to know that each
[1:00:42] person next to you has a gift
[1:00:46] how many know that
[1:00:48] so each one of us has a gift
[1:00:52] this gift wasn't just given to us by
[1:00:54] anybody
[1:01:07] that it doesn't matter how gifted you
[1:01:09] are
[1:01:12] if your gift is not active
[1:01:16] so i'm going to tell you something
[1:01:19] i'll go that that here is paul
[1:01:22] pablo and paul's getting ready to be
[1:01:24] executioned
[1:01:28] he's getting ready to die
[1:01:31] and he writes to timothy
[1:01:34] and you're going to say hey timothy try
[1:01:35] to do your best bro no
[1:03:13] from the apostle
[1:03:40] this is what is called upon us in this
[1:04:19] it says i come and i can re i can i'm
[1:04:22] going to baptize you unto repentance
[1:05:30] that can start your brother
[1:05:54] he would say some crazy stuff
[1:05:57] like what was wrong with this guy
[1:06:01] then i read the story again that
[1:06:23] just sit there on his ipad all day and
[1:06:24] say
[1:06:25] google how do i get the holy ghost
[1:06:30] he was the man that was
[1:06:43] something that was stirred up
[1:06:55] one thing that was so tremendous to me
[1:06:57] about peter tantra
[1:07:01] one day jesus tells him to cast his net
[1:07:04] to the other side
[1:07:07] we all know the story he brought up all
[1:07:09] the fish

[1:08:06] come to and asked to sift your sweet
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:23] jesus
[1:08:24] and neither does our pastor ever give up
[1:08:26] on us
[1:08:28] he said what i have prayed for
[1:08:32] that's your faith get to faith it will
[1:08:34] never fail you no

[1:47:36] god can use these gifts to help or for
[1:47:39] his glory
[1:47:41] thank you all for gaining your time
[1:47:46] when you disagree with someone that
[1:47:48] doesn't have to stop us from turning our
[1:47:50] arm around them and call him a brother
[1:47:52] and call her our sister
[1:47:54] let's show christ in our heart and do it
[1:47:56] with love and respect
[1:47:58] hebrews 13 1 says let brotherly evil
[1:48:01] continue or first of 3 8
[1:48:04] finally all of your be of one mind
[1:48:06] having compassion for one another
[1:48:09] love us brothers be tenderhearted be
[1:48:11] courageous
[1:48:13] sometimes i disagree with my family and
[1:48:15] friends but
[1:48:16] that doesn't mean i should not come
[1:48:18] without any friends
[1:48:20] let's show who should be in our heart
[1:48:26] a new faith was brought to joseph during
[1:48:28] that journey and just like me i feel
[1:48:30] like the same thing happened to me sort
[1:48:32] of so
[1:48:33] for a while before i came here to new
[1:48:35] mexico i was
[1:48:36] kind of exploring my faith but i was
[1:48:38] going in directions that i don't think
[1:48:40] were the right direction
[1:48:41] that really know what the truth was
[1:48:43] exactly
[1:48:45] um i was watching these videos and these
[1:48:48] other things about like
[1:48:50] christianity but it wasn't exactly what
[1:48:52] i am pursuing today which is this church
[1:48:55] and i'm very thankful for every single
[1:48:56] one of you guys
[1:48:58] i decided that i was going to ask my mom
[1:49:00] why they need me after who they did and
[1:49:02] does anybody remember sister ruby frost
[1:49:06] that's who they named me after
[1:49:08] brother brandon makes a statement he
[1:49:10] says it was the very thing
[1:49:12] that they brought identified who they
[1:49:14] thought he was and that that caused that
[1:49:16] uh that caught my attention because they
[1:49:18] did not know
[1:49:19] um 100
[1:49:21] that that was the messiah
[1:49:23] you know through revelation that that's
[1:49:25] how that's i believe this helped him
[1:49:27] and many times us we want to understand
[1:49:29] everything
[1:49:31] we hear we hear the word we want to take
[1:49:33] everything we want to understand it and
[1:49:34] complicate things
[1:49:36] instead of just believing what god has
[1:49:38] given us the sign that's there and
[1:49:40] through faith believing god
[1:49:43] says that
[1:49:44] that even the
[1:49:46] wise men but they took god
[1:49:49] what is what fitted
[1:49:50] them as what they thought of christ and
[1:49:53] how
[1:49:54] they wanted to be seen as a as a
[1:49:56] christian
[1:49:57] so
[1:49:59] so
[1:50:00] i i can
[1:50:01] i can apply that to my life and so that
[1:50:04] i want to be a good christian by using
[1:50:06] my gifts for the lord and
[1:50:08] and um
[1:50:11] so
[1:50:12] this paper
[1:50:14] is our gift let's say that
[1:50:16] brother random is
[1:50:18] saying that no matter what you do for
[1:50:20] your gift
[1:50:22] break it try to break it no matter what
[1:50:24] the devil tries to do to it
[1:50:28] your gift
[1:50:30] your gifts will always be with you
[1:50:32] whether you find it or not it's always
[1:50:34] in it
[1:50:35] and like i said before your mind what
[1:50:36] the devil
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:48] is the hand of the lord
[1:50:52] all it takes is the hand of the lord
[1:50:55] to take your gifts and transform it into
[1:50:57] your crown
[1:50:58] well think about this
[1:51:00] maybe god ruined your plan so that your
[1:51:02] plan didn't ruin you
[1:51:04] focus on yourself now losing someone is
[1:51:07] sad but don't lose yourself trying to
[1:51:08] find them again what god has ahead of
[1:51:10] you is greater than what you have behind
[1:51:12] you so stop looking back and start
[1:51:14] looking forward
[1:51:15] because if you get carried away worrying
[1:51:17] about what could have been you'll miss
[1:51:19] out on what's happening
[1:51:21] i'm telling you not to just wait just
[1:51:23] wait and see why god had you wait
[1:51:25] what god is doing is beyond what you
[1:51:27] could ever pray or think of
[1:51:29] even in the waiting season god can move
[1:51:31] mountains in your favor
[1:51:32] i'm not sure who needs to hear this
[1:51:34] conceivably but one day you'll look back
[1:51:36] and be grateful that it went god's way
[1:51:39] the devil wants to make things
[1:51:42] seem hard seem rough
[1:51:44] but that's how we get uh
[1:51:46] things in this world may seem hard
[1:51:48] but like my brother says
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:36] is
[1:52:41] [Music]
