our brother Enrique guarumo to come forward following him brother Benjamin Guerra I've seen that song let's all go down to the river there's a man walking on the water amen oh and let's all go down to the river oh there's a man he's walking on the water oh and come along with me I wanna see is this man walking on the water oh well he can raise the Dead from the grave change the water and turn it into wine oh and he can make the lame walk he can make the dog top and open up the eyes of the blood oh so let's all go down to the river oh there's a man he's walking on the water oh come along with me is this man walking on the water oh [Music] oh yes he will stay there soon if you give him full control so be ready for that Judgment Day all together now oh now let's all go down to the river oh there's a man and he's walking on the water oh come along with me is this man walking on the water [Music] it was Lord Jesus Christ bless you invite you to open up your Bibles give me if I'm not too formal um we'd like to honor the word of God as much as we can but to the book of Hebrews chapter 11. verse 5 to verse 7. verse 5 the scripture reads foreign that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him or before his translation he had his testimony that he pleased God is foreign but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him foreign by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet move with fear prepared an ark to this to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith man you may be seated um you days ago the Lord put this on my heart [Music] in different ways and considering these scriptures I'll take in Genesis chapter five so that we can see how this began they're in Genesis chapter 5 verse 22. the scripture reads but on Genesis excuse me Genesis 6 verse 5. hombres is all that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually says by this time in the time of nowhere the world was in a terrible condition possibly like the time we're living in now and when you read about Noah's characteristics you'll find certain correct uh characteristics that compares to today and one of those things that man was only focused on evil is and that is presently the time we are living in Noah keep this in mind is the prophet says typified the people that went through the tribulation that are preparing themselves to stay in the tribulation I don't know where you're standing today but at the same time the prophet says there was a man whose name was Enoch is he was preparing himself to be raptured and and the events that follow and what follows is the resurrection and then the rapture I'm not sure what you're preparing yourself for but according to the scriptures and the prophet this Hit me hard in my heart the prophet says Noah was a grandson said and I said Lord this isn't because I have any sort of Kindred with someone at church you cannot base this because or your mother or perhaps you may think you're past and now you have your salvation secured it is something but it's not everything and I began to worry about this when we read in Genesis chapter five assistant you realize that Noah had to be warned this is you cannot wait for Los Angeles you should be ready by faith worked with God by faith worked with God the difference is one had faith stay here on Earth and the other had Faith to go in the Rapture many people today they are basing their thoughts to stay here you know the Las Costas one of the things that we can see in the scriptures Noah had to be warned again but that Grace that he found was not enough keep that in mind hopefully begin to think which side am I on stop where is my faith laying because one day the prophet says one of these days they will call the policemen what happened my daughter was here and she disappeared and the police officer was 500 calls this morning the same thing what happened a people has left my question is and this goes for myself which side am I on which side are you on Lester be the name of the Lord armor to be able to reach grace and mercy and Enoch Enoch he walked with God the prophet of God says I believe the coming of the Lord as I said the second coming is past due numbers the message the seven compound names of Jehovah the the date is past due it is already passed and like it was in the days God waiting not willing any should perish so the second coming can take place the problem of today is one wants to make their own Ark according to the plan of God it will perish character the prophet says other ships came by Noah open open up could not open because it was God who shut it what kind of people are we to be we know you send a boy to school when he comes back you don't know what happened you can't leave the the boy with your answers it becomes a serious problem the desire of man is to always do evil fathers mothers be careful with this coach yes see who you trust your children with El Primo the cousin say Satan is very watch out we're in a world field of evil he says to realize that this day may be the last day we'll ever be mortal would you be happy this may be your last day to be mortal ity tomorrow we may be immortal s how many desire that oh we heard that the message this morning very emotional I almost shouted back there foreign of yours oh God allow me to be like tomorrow when the hour comment that I should take this path that I may find the King's Highway I can see Enoch he was becoming to him he knew what was going to happen um I can see him kiss his wife a kiss goodbye and say Amor darling I'll see you later take up his children and give them a kiss and kiss them goodbye are you going out for a little walk yes going for a stroll but that day and he went to unto Glory I don't know what you're waiting for that's yeah it's time brother to go home don't wait for tomorrow to get in order come on to live like Noah then relax continue yes that won't stop God if you are preparing to stay a problem no a problem [Music] [Applause] each time I sit at the table to eat I'm thinking Lord how are we today one of these days brother we'll see our loved ones [Applause] my question is are you preparing for that how many believe that is it's for the crate is for the crazies Paul when they had to stand before an audience yes yes and he caused a scandal the assembly divided but one day it'll happen if you don't believe it but there will be a resurrection one of these days that love when you lost be there sitting next to you and if you have not prepared yourself and you will not be able to take flight this gets me excited I I have people that are waiting waiting for me get excited if you're in sin get away from sins there is great promises for he that believes it says a Noah yeah which is a type this thing is the type of Israel that's carried over will be over there on Mount Transfiguration down in Palestine when Noah saw Enoch was missing where's he at oh my brother um perhaps one of the day these days you'll come to church where's brother Caleb at um where's the deacon oh brother it'll be too late it's why God is warning us today that day to come don't understand where is he at which was his grandson Noah was grandson and he said where's it at what become of him he knowed that the time was at hand right then oh my brother Prophet says I see the church going into its laodicean condition I see little isms and fashion oh brother how is this this makes us look to the mirror of the word the fashions little Sensations scattering the church and separating it making it worse than ever then not then I know it's time I can't help it I'll go into something in me makes me scream out back to the world many people today Brothers they put the other part aside that ship will not resist oh Church of the Living God how can it be the last few days I've been torn and up early for morning prayers and I said to God the other morning he also I said God I don't know what more you can do I have don't I have done as you have told us as far as I know the people constantly drifting drifting I said the next thing you'll have to move yourself you've got to put a face and confidence is personas and those people's hearts to believe it or all I could do will never change it if God doesn't put that faith in your heart brother Brandon tells us I have done everything that I know to do but what happens Donald Trump says I can't do it what happened to you lutherans many years ago at the First Reformation you were God's light what happened to you foreign but there's more scriptures than that so we can't take away from the scriptures or can we add to it your ship will not withstand this is what a prophet said and knowing we are in such an evil times foreign to the scripture and allow us to place a good foundation that'll help us to withstand what is coming if your faith is brother anything will take you them huh foreign they won't reach it I don't know about you which side you want to be on if you may stand let us give honor and glory to God think think about that [Applause] foreign know both had Faith Noah and Enoch is what kind of Faith do you have foreign hey man amen don't you love him this fine evening thank you thank you Pastor for the confidence you've given us tonight what a word we've heard today amen I believe you know in you know we could be Fanatics you know but sometimes we you know got to get out of the line but um you know we got to get excited about God's word and after hearing what we heard this morning my my heart was overjoyed you know to to get ready here and it was it was hard waiting between Services knowing that it was my lot to to let God use us tonight and God is good let's turn to the scriptures and I'll let let you be seated let's turn to the Book of Mark Chapter 5 Verse 22 Marcos and the word of God reads like this and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue and when he saw him he fell at his feet may God add the blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen this last panel we did was very impact for me on the red heifer you know because you know we we just heard Brothers but were it impacted me the most you know it lets us see something and and what the picture that picture that it paints because we see what God is doing in his word but then we see a reflection of today [Music] seems they lived under the law yes we live under grace but it seems like we do away with all the requirements that God has for us many times we serve God like you were a Catholic because we know that there's repentance here foreign how did he get to the place [Music] [Music] so it came to a point Betty how to make a decision because many times in the Bible does the an action take place but God was already working on Jerrys because every time Jesus did something serious he heard about this he heard about that he heard the parable that Jesus talked about and inside the heart of Jerry the only way [Music] that he has to make that decision so we find him at the feet of Jesus Jesus but I've heard the prophet foreign there was a crowd that Cameo and the scripture says that Jesus stopped yes on the way to Jersey's house what happened the Lord is to to experience something experience we know the story of the woman with the blood issues and all she had to do foreign oh only believe solo prayer [Applause] you think the prophet of God just came up with the only believes don't worry he goes into jarius's house he says you're unbelievers get out he cast out all unbelief a total separation God is seriously Council rights all right Iglesia we gotta get serious with him the fire is here but we're half asleep you know I told the Lord recently it's a lord of playing games I'm tired of seeing the people of this condition so he can solve it what can I do yeah and you know what the Lord told me he said the prophet of God says that's the United States needs more missionaries but he said let's bring it down Church he's more missionaries then what are you doing get here he said it just doesn't rest on the pastor he's a character is that where is the love because you have for God we gotta shake ourselves It's gotta get serious is here it's here Church Iglesia we talked and we preached year after year a Greater Works your salvation your salvation to Salvation what is the restaurant to impart eternal life our pastoring in the last I can't do my job if I don't do my job am I we're not going to have this bad very long this load is great what am I doing about you we want to come to the Lord to come to pass we talk about this fire distance to make things happening to have the desires to impart eternal life because what is the greatest thing yes what's the greatest message you could preach and your features Hallelujah the power of almighty God is here there's nothing that could stand in its way prophet of God God told him you could get people to leave you know every minister has that power of God yes every believer but many times we don't accept this promise we try to pawn it off to someone else because that's the easy thing but to call God on the scene and have the faith that there's nothing that could stand because can you do that this with every guy closed in the building [Music] raise your hands as high as you can how gracious holy Heavenly Father Lord there's nothing that I can save myself for I'm not like able to see that your meat but it's your word Lord your powerful Lord It's Your word that saves us so we call you
