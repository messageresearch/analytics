[58:06] nets it windows it somewhere chapter six
[58:08] a piccolo say and first twelve verses OC
[58:11] and the Bible says planting and it was
[58:16] told King David without obese or aw
[58:19] saying the Lord had blessed the house of
[58:23] obed-edom Shindo flow Bob in the two de
[58:25] la casa do bed Adam you may be seated
[58:28] make my god blah asked of add his
[58:31] blessings to the reading of the word
[58:34] elevation electroscope allowed the store
[58:36] the story I I that the Lord has been
[58:38] working on me with Listeria collected
[58:41] estoy trabajando Kumiko simply a lot of
[58:43] us maybe not a lot of us have heard of
[58:45] obed-edom the front of people so Moses
[58:48] which I'll do with it on then my
[58:50] question was why should I be like Oh
[58:52] buddy don't do this for clipping because
[58:54] you come over Adam and and simply it is
[58:57] because of the choices that he made
[58:59] implemented political NCAA Lisa which

[59:05] not only for him but generations after
[59:08] him Kuo su vida de una vida en de ciudad
[59:11] no sólo para el perro en la she only
[59:12] this was then we see that the story is
[59:15] famous kalisto dia that that the art of
[59:18] the Covenant
[59:19] allarakha de facto it dwells in the
[59:21] hands of the Philistines at this time
[59:23] Stalin Amano's fede stills in this
[59:25] caucus unit and the Philippines had the
[59:28] art for about seventy five years
[59:30] los feliz de austin el arco como post a
[59:32] temptation Kuan Yew's and when David
[59:34] becomes king cuando la vida got a plea
[59:36] he knows that the one thing that needs
[59:39] to be restored
[59:40] asami que la cosa que tiene que se
[59:42] restaurant is that the art is kill Erica
[59:45] needs to be restored to the center point
[59:47] of the nation en esta vez toda de El
[59:50] Centro Punto de la nación
[59:51] only then can his whole nation be black
[59:54] sólo por esto puede la nación 7dc de so
[59:57] it says that David goes go to this
[59:59] Academy
[1:00:01] and he's able to make a path to attempt
[1:00:03] yes I assume wanna use and he
[1:00:06] gets the Ark of the Covenant
[1:00:08] oh my allarakha and back to now the art
[1:00:11] of a company when it's in the hands of
[1:00:13] the Philistines of the darkest and
[1:00:15] monotonicity stills they they take it to
[1:00:17] the temple of Dagon the gemenon
[1:00:20] sympathetic on which is the fish God
[1:00:22] recovers in your space and in the
[1:00:25] morning you know mañana de God on his
[1:00:27] face da gonna star in cuidado es Rosa
[1:00:30] and we see that everything in our lives
[1:00:33] even Mosca Torah study that that we
[1:00:35] place before God lo que podemos antes
[1:00:38] que Dios it's an idol it's neither a
[1:00:40] thing that are in the way from Pakistan
[1:00:43] is infirmity de but none of them can
[1:00:45] stand before God they don't know they
[1:00:47] stopped our assailant reduce not even if
[1:00:49] you want it to be sticky icky sassy cat
[1:00:52] daddy for him whether but are sitting on
[1:00:55] the bed so they picked it up Travis
[1:01:02] Dakara so we sometimes in those Oprah's
[1:01:06] in okis units we get to where we we want
[1:01:08] to do something else so bad yamazaki
[1:01:11] McKay Demoiselle Gautama lamenting that
[1:01:13] we can't even see the blessing that God
[1:01:16] wants to do for our Jenny Shakira for
[1:01:17] Mozilla dicen que viene para nosotros so
[1:01:20] when it's in the hands of the
[1:01:21] Philistines what's the matter little see
[1:01:23] stills they move it place to place some
[1:01:26] women de lugar de lugar it playing the
[1:01:28] Philistines for 75 years for suspense a
[1:01:31] Cinco años y 1 OC stills because they

[1:02:02] takes the ark from wildin Erica the only
[1:02:05] problem is there this problem is David
