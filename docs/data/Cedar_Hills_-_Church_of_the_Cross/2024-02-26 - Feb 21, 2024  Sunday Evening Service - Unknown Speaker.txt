[Music] fore [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] amen [Music] amen the Lord Jesus Christ bless you we're GNA open our our Bibles in the Book of Amos chapter 3 drink some water because it's hot last time we were speaking on there is a man here that can turn turn on the light I want to keep myself in that line a little bit until the Lord guides me and the Bible says reads like this Prophet surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets let us pray beloved God and Heavenly Father we thank you in this evening we place ourselves in your hands waiting upon you to help us like I've said before we don't have our own message because it is your word and your message and we're going to speak on it asking that it might be a blessing for your children and also to me because I'm the most needed one among all of us we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may be seated I'm going to set my time here um we were speaking about light what I don't want is to do a shock uh electric shock because we need to know how to conduct the lines how many of you have you had an electric shock at your house okay and you're just like startled um but if you notice uh outside of your house there's some uh some control something to control it and if there is a a an electric shock uh those lines are going to go off to prevent a fire so wor testing and maybe I'm going to mention some things that are probably blow your mind but don't get scared because here we have the control that is the word of God and he can set everything in its position so we spoke about the natural part but today I want to speak about the spiritual part and the word of God tells us that God does not do anything without first revealing it to his servant the prophet if there is any person that wants to know the secret of God so the first thing you have to do is to listen to the voice of a prophet how many love hearing the voice of a prophet according to the message the prophet of God says that the first thing that existed in eternity when he was the self exist existent one that existed by himself he was thinking he had in his thoughts to express something the first thing he expressed was let there be light when he expressed that thought or that word because before the word first it was a thought so then when it was spoken the logus came to to pass or the prophet said it was a little light that started spinning around the prophet says that was his son the logus was his son now when he was with the logos then he said let us make man according to our likeness and her likeness so then he made a spirit man to the image of God created he male and female we're good so far right so then when that Spirit man prophet of God says that he would lead all the natural things but it took man made flesh to rule upon all these things they asked the prophet brother Bram what is the difference between Genesis 126 and Genesis 27 and he answers and says they're the same but one is a spiritual and the other one is a natural being but the man that sinned was a natural man he wasn't a spiritual man so then we start seeing how the light starts condescending the prophet calls it and says God revealing himself through time through these beings but it came there was a point where God was already perfect it was the father was the son and his spirit so God was already perfect so when man sinned we're g to we're going to we're going to stop here a little bit and we're going to say it was God the logos the spirit according to the image and likeness of God how many can see the logus there that was there that's when go when God said let us it wasn't any man it was a man in position of what God had given him to rule upon that's how the scripture says let him rule upon the the the fall of the Earth the fish that is the right man but when this man fell we've heard this many times this man fell when God called man he wasn't calling him because he was uh playing hide and seek or because he didn't know where he was because God doesn't miss a thing you can hide anywhere you can be in the most but God knows the condition that you're in that's why when he said Adam Adam where are thou because Adam was playing their hiding the Tre it's because he was calling Adam because the position that he had left he he was in his right position he said Adam I'm going to go a little fast he said Adam the prophet of God says Adam had the rulership upon all the world Man became man or God upon the earth I want you to see men look at yourself and say me the god of the earth that's why last time I I I com I did a little comment that many want to have the power to move mountains to heal the sick oh that's good but the position that God is calling you to is for you to have the position of ruling on the position that has given you what is that position we're going to see what the prophet say to be a son a daughter of God that's why the thing that God has to restore is man because if man is reconciled with God now the man is in his position to be able to speak and bring words into existence otherwise you will not be able to do it look man I couldn't understand why Sarah would call Abraham his her Lord because Abraham was the god for SAR we saw it this morning right Moses was the god for who for for Aaron So when you say when when you pray when you say Lord who is your lord man in his position is a God and I I I'm not afraid to say it and I know that many people they struggle with with this because the order of God is the next the first we have his he said I will not do anything without first revealing it to him and then after he has the prophet I'm gonna read as the prophet and message adoption uh n page can I read it because that way you can believe it more uh the prophet reads like this how that God has set some in the church through the labor pains through what the sisters can tell us a little bit about this it's not easy it's not easy to bring to manifestation a gift of God the prophet of God says God never takes his gifts to Heaven he always leaves them on the earth for the benefit of his children he says oh they get tremendous sometimes when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the prophet of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born how many of you have been born check yourself I'm not going to ask you I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but you have to be consci this if there is something that the devil wants to finish is the spiritual homes because he knows that there is growth in there of his children now you young people be vigilant to this but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists and then he has given into there speaking with Tong interpretation of Tong wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles so where is this if you want to see Miracles and signs mind then you have to get into that body you cannot reject it if you rejected you will never be able to see those things you say brother but they have prayed for me brother I've been in the most holy church here and I've been up and down and nothing happens it's because you haven't recognize what God has given you God has placed Apostles the devil doesn't like that because that is his competition because the devil also has Apostles if you're the devil has Apostles too he has false Christ because this is a battle this is a of one Kingdom against the other Kingdom we have been hearing the restoration of the Kingdom this is a battle and you have to hold your you have to to know what you have believed in because if not the devil is going to play dirty to never let the devil come and tell you that you don't need those things don't open up your mind to that the prophet says in here this has never changed it will never change the prophet says after you are here inside where in that body today we had a good lunch right raise your hand all those that had a good lunch I I don't think I think some of you didn't but the natural body the word of God tells us that the word the nature itself teach us this Natural Body teaches us many things when you eat when you pray for your food so that food goes to the body and in that body here inside there is some gastric fluid how many of you know about that that gastric fluid what it does is that it takes the food and it melts them breaks it down on such a point that they become liquid so then when they become liquid then the body starts processing them within the same organs that we have inside and that's when you start like that's when but when you're going through those that gastric fluid brother it's because you're going through the body to bring benefit of of Health if you eat meat so then the body is going to take the minerals or the substances of that meat and it's going to take it from there what it needs for that body to M maintain itself now the prophet of God says going to go to page 50 of this message and the prophet of God says sure it is the holy spirit says I have uh put trials I tested him in this I tested him in that way I have knock him down knock down if you have felt yourself knocked down don't don't think it's the devil the holy spirit is saying I have knocked him down I have put him in sickness I have stricken him I have step upon him I let the devil do anything he can but he will lift up again see he would rise up again I have gotten him sick I have done this to him I put him in the hospital I took him outside and did this to him I do that other thing I put his wife against him has it happened to you brother what do you say oh the devil no don't get SC for that it says I turn his neighbors against him don't raise up your hand but who has a neighbor that that is like that I turn everything around but that didn't change a bit of why because you are in your position that God has called you to you're not moved by a goip in your position because when God said let there be light there you were what is light for when you turn on the light well we don't have cockroaches here but you're going to see them or do we do we have them well I haven't seen them here when you turn on the light you're going to start seeing all the animals running but when the light of God is spoken to bring into manifest the children of God when God said let there be light so then the logus appeared and there you were and it it appeared and when light came pass according to John chapter one in the beginning was the word the word was the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and I ask when did that change it hasn't changed God is still making himself flesh through his children that word did not stay there 2,000 years ago that word continued and it it still Advanced more and because of that word you are here now because by the word of God all things subsist that hasn't changed then the first thing that God does when you're born he puts you under a Ministry we saw it this morning so then the Holy Spirit he's there controlling taking control of that body when you need something then the Holy Spirit he is the leader he says oh such sister so and so needs something okay okay I'm going to send the pastor going to send the teacher she's a little confused I'm gonna send the teacher so she can understand that she's my daughter and I'm her God if there is someone that is getting out of line a little and he's getting into sin so then he says we're goingon to send the Evangelist because he is the one that knows his needs the prophet says though he kills me in him will I wait the Propet say I killed his family I took this away from him I did all of this he rose up immediately though he killed me even though I will serve him you're probably struggling with some situations this is something very personal I don't like to talk a lot about this but I got home and I asked my wife have you talked with God she said yes and he asked her again have you talked with God and she said yes have I said what did he say to you he said what do you mean she said what because when I say that I speak to God With God it's because there was a conversation don't think that in your mind it's like like speaking to a wall okay I already said that no I was going through Highway 70 the Lord said this to my heart he said there is a lot of tiredness and I say I don't understand you know when God speaks things sometimes you don't even understand so I said Lord what do you mean he said there's a lot of tiredness and I didn't ask anything else but when I got home and I saw those two pictures and I stood in front of them I said Lord I believe you I believe your prophet and I believe there's a Ministry why are people tired he said it's because they're counting my coming as slackness and people get tired and it threw me off I said Lord I said Lord yes I'm tired I said I'm tired Lord sometimes I feel that I cannot I would like to give you more but I can but he gave me a scripture that says those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength please stand wouldn't have any more time to read the scriptures but let me tell you something don't get tired just get a hold of the little you you have this is the truth do not get discouraged or if you're tired I understand because I have been there I've been at the point of saying lord I can't do it anymore but you know what the problem is I said I can't I can't go back I've tried so many times but I haven't been able to you know what I see comes to my mind Lord where am I going where shall we go Lord a beer is not going to give me the satisfaction that I have in you dance is not going to give me what I need vices are not going to give me what you give me do not change this for anything if God called you to be a Son of God do not lower yourself down to be king take with pride this word with PR and stand still and say Lord whatever happens it doesn't matter whatever happens from here I'm going to stand firm just help me Lord let us bow our heads how many love him I'm so thankful with God I don't know how to express it but I am so thankful because God redeemed man to redeem man and I'm thinking on these men that are over there that that are abroad and I remember those words that the prophet heard and they said brother brandham if you hadn't gone we wouldn't be [Music] here church if there hadn't been men that stood firm and what they believe you and I wouldn't be here you would probably be in a bar probably there
