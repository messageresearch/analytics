[36:35] honor just to give us that Breath of
[36:39] Life I thank God for
[36:42] that and I know you you probably already
[36:47] heard when my wife was sick last
[36:50] year you might say well why you're
[36:53] repeating again what she
[36:55] said
[36:58] for the devil's sake I'm telling
[37:00] him for the devil's sake I'm telling
[37:05] him I thank the Lord for the miracle
[37:08] that he did for

[37:13] much that she has so much
[37:16] energy now she won't
[37:18] stop but I thank the Lord for that for

[37:35] prayers we keep praying for him and the
[37:37] the ministry that are with him in Poland
[37:42] now amen it just
[37:46] uh for all this stuff that was been
[37:48] going
[37:51] on you know we say well nobody's
[37:54] perfect and I understand that
[37:57] but Paul said let's run to
[38:01] Perfection people say
[38:03] well people say well I I'm hanging by a
[38:08] thread you heard people say that before
[38:11] right I'm hanging by a
[38:14] thread just make sure it's by the Hem of
[38:16] His
[38:22] Garment God puts his trust in
[38:25] you puts his confidence
[38:27] you that's why in Psalms 23:4 it
[38:31] says though I walk through the valley of
[38:33] shadow of
[38:36] death I will fear no
[38:39] evil we we look at the story of of
[38:42] Peter now he was a rough
[38:44] guy he was a
[38:47] liar
[38:49] deceiver he like to
[38:51] curse he would he would
[38:55] swear
[38:57] and he chopped a man's ear
[38:59] off and I know he wasn't going for the
[39:03] ear he was going for his head
[39:06] actually as we see the story of
[39:09] Peter he was a very he had
[39:13] issues you know who doesn't have
[39:18] issues so one
[39:21] day he was with
[39:24] Jesus so they took him uh
[39:27] to the
[39:31] Courtyard the sandrian ccil to get
[39:36] judged he got arrested for
[39:39] that and Peter was there in the
[39:43] crowd now Peter went only a a not too
[39:48] far he went a little
[39:53] ways so he was in the
[39:55] crowd
[39:57] he was uh getting warmed up in the
[40:01] fire so in the
[40:04] crowd somebody
[40:07] said aren't you a follower of
[40:11] Jesus and Peter said no I'm
[40:15] not goes I'm not a
[40:17] follower I'm not I was never associated
[40:19] with
[40:21] him how many times have we denied
[40:24] Jesus now we know that Peter denied him
[40:27] three
[40:28] times how many times have I denied
[40:33] Jesus Maybe by my
[40:36] actions the life I live they say that
[40:40] your life speaks louder than
[40:42] words but you got to remember one
[40:46] thing we know that Peter was he was
[40:49] bad but Jesus still loved
[40:52] him when the angel was at the tomb
[40:57] of of of Jesus when Jesus was
[41:01] resurrected the angel told Mary
[41:03] Magdalene and the rest that were
[41:06] there you go tell my
[41:10] disciples you didn't name each
[41:13] disciple he said go tell my
[41:17] disciples and Peter he named Peter for a
[41:22] reason specifically he named him by his
[41:25] name
[41:28] I believe he wanted his he wanted uh his
[41:30] critics to to
[41:32] know that I still love
[41:36] Peter and and you look at this
[41:40] story and you see
[41:43] Jesus he tells Peter you know what Peter
[41:48] that's
[41:49] okay I will build my
[41:51] church upon the revelation of who I
[41:55] am
[41:57] and the Gates of Hell will not
[42:00] Prevail maybe you're going through
[42:01] trials right
[42:03] now but in 1 Peter
[42:07] 2:9 it says
[42:10] here but
[42:12] you
[42:14] you you're a chosen
[42:18] generation a royal
[42:21] priesthood a holy nation a peul
[42:25] people

[47:19] power and you as we go through
[47:23] life when we become Christians
[47:27] our lives are
[47:29] marked and people notice
[47:32] that my life is
[47:35] marked when you act
[47:39] different people already know who you
[47:42] are they know you better than what you
[47:44] know
[47:46] yourself and that's what happened to
[47:49] Peter they knew he was a follower of
[47:54] Jesus
[47:56] Peter
[47:59] never rejected
[48:01] Jesus he never rejected
[48:04] Jes he knew he was the Lord Jesus
[48:08] Christ he was Christ the
[48:11] anointed Peter never rejected that
[48:14] part he only rejected him as a
[48:18] follower as
[48:21] associate how much do have we done
[48:24] that
[48:26] well I'm a message
[48:28] believer I uh I believe the
[48:31] message but our lives show
[48:34] different so I I say
[48:38] tonight look at at at uh at uh
[48:42] Shamar shamgar was a just a ordinary
[48:50] farmer he was getting whipped year after
[48:54] year
[48:57] and shamgar was getting
[49:00] tired the Philistines would come and
[49:03] still his
[49:07] heart all the time he looked at his
[49:11] wife she looked
[49:14] beat looked at his
[49:17] kids the same way they looked whipped
[49:19] they looked
[49:21] beat shamgar said I can't live like this
[49:24] anymore
[49:26] so one
[49:27] day his great great great great great
[49:30] great
[49:33] grandfather was sitting outside the
[49:36] tent mzc came up to
[49:39] him and he gave him
[49:42] meat and gave him
[49:44] milk and he told
[49:48] Abraham you told
[49:50] Abraham thy
[49:52] seed shall possess the gates of its
[49:54] enemies
[49:57] until Shamar didn't recognize who he
[50:00] was he would get whipped year after
[50:05] year so he looked at him goes you know
[50:09] what I got he got his
[50:13] Ox it's a long
[50:15] stick had a pointed in at the
[50:20] end he used the to poke the the
[50:24] cattle to to direct them to go
[50:28] forward so that's what he would he
[50:32] did he beat 600 of his enemies with
[50:38] that 600
[50:40] Philistines and the word of God
[50:43] says one shall take a
[50:47] thousand 1,000
[50:49] today 1,000
[50:51] tomorrow one victory at a time one day
[50:55] at a time so the devil the
[50:58] devil being so
[51:00] stupid he only sent 600 of his
[51:04] enemies and we know that the devil knows
[51:06] the
[51:08] scriptures he didn't know that part that
[51:11] one shall take a
[51:13] thousand and that's the way shamgar
[51:15] defeated the
[51:17] enemy just with a
[51:19] stick that's what we got to
[51:22] do just by the
[51:24] word you got to recognize who you
[51:27] are where we come from and where we're
[51:33] going hallu Luke
[51:39] 10:19
[51:42] behold I give unto you power to tread
[51:45] upon
[51:48] serpent you have the
[51:51] power God never allows pain in your in
[51:53] your life without a purpose
[51:58] blessed is he that
[52:00] overcomes he created you to be an
[52:04] overcomer it doesn't matter what you're
[52:06] going through right
[52:07] now there's something greater inside of
[52:11] you if if Peter had the key to unlock
[52:14] the the
[52:16] [Music]
[52:19] door on the day of
[52:21] Pentecost acts
[52:24] 238 repent and be
[52:28] baptized that's where we come
[52:30] in because in Luke 17 it
[52:34] says the kingdom of God is within
[52:37] you kingom we just don't have the key
[52:40] now we have the kingdom inside of
[52:44] us we go through things in
[52:47] life there is no
[52:50] explanation sometimes God will make you
[52:52] go through something that you fear the
[52:54] most so you can wipe that off your
[53:00] life something that you fear the
[53:04] most God will do it purposely just to
[53:06] get that fear out of
[53:10] you you're not a
[53:12] Survivor you are an
[53:15] overcomer there's a
[53:16] difference you are an
[53:20] overcomer we want to remind Satan this
[53:24] tonight he had 2,000
[53:27] years he's had 2,000
[53:29] years to stop this
[53:33] message he's had 2,000
[53:36] years to stop this
[53:38] bride you can't do
[53:40] it so God
[53:43] knows you can meet the challenge of the
[53:48] age God has predestinated predestinated
[53:51] you to to this
[53:52] age God has always mindful
[53:56] you what is man that God is always
[53:59] mindful
[54:01] of you might say God is forgot about
[54:04] me you might say God is
[54:08] silent just for a little while he's
[54:11] testing your
[54:12] faith he wants to know where you're
[54:16] at but the shadow of the king is here
[54:21] tonight the devil's already
[54:24] defeated Bel is
[54:26] defeated doubt is
[54:28] defeated fear is
[54:31] defeated everything is
[54:34] defeated I would like to read something
[54:36] from Brother
[54:44] bam ins sign
[54:50] 1962 and when a man or a woman is
[54:53] dressed in full armor
[54:58] full armor of
[55:00] God it ain't
[55:02] power it's
[55:04] Authority the Devils will
[55:08] scream and breaks
[55:12] will death itself will not shutter and
[55:15] the graves will
[55:24] open
[55:27] you might say I lost a loved
[55:31] one why did I lose my
[55:34] parents why did I lose my
[55:36] son my daughter why did Death why did
[55:40] they die maybe there's a
[55:43] reason maybe God wants you to resurrect
[55:48] them but I'm going to read this in the
[55:50] exposition of the seven
[55:54] churches
[55:59] but thank
[56:02] God in the last
[56:05] age there will be a a group rise
[56:08] up and who is that group
[56:11] tonight the true
[56:14] Bride of the last
[56:16] day and she will listen to that
[56:19] Spirit she will rise
[56:22] up you are that group
[56:26] now here it is you get
[56:29] ready you all ready this is what brother
[56:32] B say now here it is you get ready he
[56:38] commissioned his
[56:40] church to cast them Devils
[56:44] out there you are in my name they shall
[56:49] cast out
[56:53] devils in my name
[56:55] you will cast out
[56:57] Devils it is
[56:59] written the word is is in the
[57:02] brigh and she does she does it in the
[57:06] name and she has th
[57:09] say you have th say the
[57:12] Lord the word will defeat
[57:15] Satan
[57:16] anywhere any time any
[57:20] place in any
[57:23] condition thank the
[57:26] Lord for his
[57:28] grace for redeeming
[57:30] us now we are more than
[57:34] conquerers we have the
[57:38] inheritance we're more than
[57:41] conquerors so we're we're dealing with a
[57:43] defeated
[57:46] enemy sickness is
[57:49] defeated death is
[57:51] defeated it's a testing time
[57:56] it's one good evidence to us that God is
[57:58] with
[58:00] us when we're
[58:02] tested for all children children of God
[58:04] are tested and
[58:09] tried so trials brings there's trials
[58:11] bring a
[58:14] purpose it makes you it starts forming
[58:16] your
[58:18] character if the devil tells you that
[58:20] you're
[58:22] nobody if that's the case
[58:26] why is he always
[58:29] after so whenever a thief breaks into a
[58:33] house he will never break into an empty
[58:37] house there's nothing
[58:39] valuable that's why the devil's always
[58:41] trying to get
[58:42] you because there's something valuable
[58:44] inside of
[58:46] you you know what drives a devil
[58:49] crazy when you ask God for
[58:52] something and he doesn't give it to you
[58:56] but you can still serve God the same
[58:58] way that's what drives him
[59:02] crazy David made this
[59:06] statement this
[59:08] day I am
[59:10] weak but you're still anointed
[59:15] king you might be weak you might be
[59:20] sick that doesn't matter you're still
[59:23] anointed say we're a
[59:27] seed not just any kind of
[59:30] seed but the Royal Seed of
[59:33] Abraham you can be
[59:35] weak you can be
[59:37] sick depressed
[59:42] anxiety but you still have the Royal
[59:43] Blood In
[59:46] You
[59:47] weakness and
[59:50] anointed they stand
[59:53] together as long as we're in the will of
[59:56] God nothing can stop
[59:58] this nothing can stop
[1:00:01] you you might be going through
[1:00:05] chaos but one remember one
[1:00:08] thing one victory at a
[1:00:11] time we do have the
[1:00:15] Victory and God is more than
[1:00:19] able to take full control of your
[1:00:23] situation how many love him
[1:00:25] tonight I just want to read this last
[1:00:29] part brother B says here on the
[1:00:33] token you apply it and say
[1:00:36] Lord I am going after my son and my
[1:00:39] daughter they might be out in the

[1:01:12] her with your anointing upon
[1:01:15] you and he'll do it amen amen God bless
[1:01:23] you
[1:01:45] God bless brother Daniel he was telling
[1:01:47] us up in the
[1:01:48] front he didn't know what he was going
[1:01:50] to preach
[1:01:53] about
[1:01:55] that's strange
[1:01:59] huh you please stand as we read a
[1:02:06] scripture God bless our brother Daniel
[1:02:08] may the Lord continue giving him
[1:02:12] more G to speak a little bit this
[1:02:16] evening i' like to bring a little bit of
[1:02:18] light on the faith of
[1:02:23] Isaac many times I've heard a little bit
[1:02:25] of the faith of
[1:02:28] Isaac but I wanted to bring a little bit
[1:02:30] of light on it this
[1:02:34] evening if we could turn to uh the Book
[1:02:36] of Genesis chapter
[1:02:43] 26 I like what brother Daniel said he
[1:02:45] said that we're not
[1:02:48] surviving but we are
[1:02:50] overcoming
[1:02:53] amen and
[1:02:57] in this little story we're going to read
[1:02:58] about
[1:03:01] Isaac he also had his
[1:03:07] difficulties uh God gave his father
[1:03:09] Abraham a big
[1:03:14] promise but he needed to have an
[1:03:16] experience of his own
[1:03:18] amen amen just like each and every one
[1:03:21] of
[1:03:23] us
[1:03:27] you might have a family member maybe
[1:03:29] your parents or grandparents that had an
[1:03:30] experience
[1:03:33] God but we need to have our own
[1:03:35] experience with
[1:03:38] God because without an
[1:03:40] experience you can be like
[1:03:43] Peter go from service to
[1:03:46] service and never be
[1:03:51] converted that's why Jesus told him that
[1:03:53] once you are converted
[1:03:55] then strengthen your
[1:03:57] brother that way you could take care of
[1:03:59] your
[1:04:00] brother and that's what we
[1:04:04] want that's what our pastor had asked of
[1:04:08] us he asked us are we our Brother's
[1:04:14] Keeper we will not be our Brother's
[1:04:16] Keeper if we have not had a
[1:04:21] conversion we're just going to be
[1:04:22] worried about our own business
[1:04:26] of our own things that we are
[1:04:30] doing let's go ahead and read Genesis
[1:04:34] 26 in verse
[1:04:51] one and there was a famine in the land
[1:04:54] beside the first famine that there was
[1:04:56] in the days of Abraham and Isaac went
[1:04:59] unto ailec King of the Philistines unto
[1:05:03] gerar amen God bless the reading of his
[1:05:05] word you may be
[1:05:10] seated here we have uh Isaac in the
[1:05:12] beginning of the
[1:05:18] scripture as he was uh confronting a
[1:05:22] crisis when there is a crisis
[1:05:26] the first thing that somebody would like
[1:05:28] to
[1:05:34] do maybe something uh serious arises
[1:05:37] maybe something like
[1:05:40] Co in Isaac's case what he wanted to do
[1:05:44] he wanted to
[1:05:46] leave he wanted to leave from where he
[1:05:48] was
[1:05:50] at and that's what one
[1:05:53] does
[1:05:55] when there's a crisis in the
[1:05:59] home one thinks I'm battling in
[1:06:02] work maybe things aren't going well for
[1:06:07] me my my brothers things are going well
[1:06:10] for
[1:06:12] them maybe he had a friend
[1:06:17] there maybe he had a friend that was
[1:06:19] calling him come over
[1:06:23] here
[1:06:24] I'm over here in Egypt and the River
[1:06:27] Nile is rolling flowing
[1:06:31] fully the Nile River is running
[1:06:36] strong there's water to for
[1:06:42] everything but here where where Isaac
[1:06:44] found
[1:06:47] himself the Bible says that there was a
[1:06:52] famine how many here can go without can
[1:06:56] go
[1:06:57] hungry I can't go without
[1:07:05] eating I know there's Brothers here that
[1:07:07] are good at that they God has blessed
[1:07:09] them in
[1:07:11] fast but my body it struggles
[1:07:15] with I can't go without
[1:07:18] eating and my wife can tell
[1:07:21] you and all you have to do is just look
[1:07:24] at me
[1:07:26] right and here was
[1:07:29] Isaac he began to pack his
[1:07:34] bag he was maybe in communication with
[1:07:36] his
[1:07:37] friend and there he was going towards
[1:07:43] Egypt can you imagine the son of the
[1:07:45] father of the
[1:07:47] faith in route to
[1:07:52] Egypt but when the Lord Lord had
[1:07:54] appeared to
[1:07:56] him he appeared to him and he told him
[1:07:59] in verse
[1:08:06] two and the Lord appeared unto him and
[1:08:08] said go not down into
[1:08:11] Egypt dwell in the land which I shall
[1:08:14] tell
[1:08:22] thee the first thing that comes to the
[1:08:23] mind is somebody when they want to leave
[1:08:26] they want to go on route to
[1:08:29] somewhere sometimes they don't even know
[1:08:31] where they want to go and we've seen
[1:08:37] it we weren't born
[1:08:45] yesterday we've seen it and the people
[1:08:47] come and maybe a little bit of pressure
[1:08:49] is
[1:08:51] applied and all of a sudden they're gone
[1:08:56] they might go to another
[1:08:58] place and then later on they come
[1:09:01] back same as as they had
[1:09:08] left but when one
[1:09:14] remains just like God wanted Isaac to
[1:09:17] remain in
[1:09:20] ger there is a key to
[1:09:22] remain
[1:09:30] there's a key to remain and to stay in
[1:09:34] one there's a scripture in ecclesiastics
[1:09:52] 7:14
[1:09:59] in the day of prosperity be joyful but
[1:10:01] in the day of adversity consider God has
[1:10:04] also ha set the one over against another
[1:10:07] to the end that man should find nothing
[1:10:09] after
[1:10:12] him as us as
[1:10:16] humans we want to figure out our
[1:10:20] future you want to figure out well this
[1:10:22] is happening
[1:10:24] so I need to do
[1:10:28] this I got to prepare this and square
[1:10:31] away
[1:10:34] that but many times we have
[1:10:37] heard our pastor has told
[1:10:40] us that our future is already
[1:10:47] fixed that's why it says in
[1:10:48] ecclesiastics to
[1:10:50] rejoice in
[1:10:52] adversity
[1:10:54] take
[1:10:55] inventory see how your life is
[1:11:01] going let me tell you the Lord is not
[1:11:03] going to let you die of
[1:11:05] hunger because the Bible
[1:11:08] says that I've never seen a righteous
[1:11:13] forsaken or his seed begging for
[1:11:18] bread how many here this
[1:11:21] evening descendants of Abraham
[1:11:26] our future is already set it's
[1:11:30] fixed all we have to do is stay
[1:11:34] established stay in the
[1:11:39] faith we know that we go from Faith to
[1:11:42] Faith we're speaking of the faith of
[1:11:47] Isaac Isaac had so much
[1:11:52] faith just to have been with his
[1:11:57] father if you can imagine
[1:12:02] Isaac when the experience that Abraham
[1:12:05] had when God appeared to
[1:12:08] him this changed all of
[1:12:13] Abraham to go and do a sacrifice as he
[1:12:16] was going to
[1:12:17] do it's something crazy it's
[1:12:20] craziness can you
[1:12:22] imagine
[1:12:24] take your son and go
[1:12:26] sacrifice it's a
[1:12:31] craziness but that remained marked in
[1:12:35] Isaac it maybe traumatized
[1:12:40] him but that was a good
[1:12:43] trauma if I can say it that
[1:12:49] way he saw the faithfulness of his
[1:12:52] father
[1:12:55] he saw how faithful his father was to
[1:12:56] what he
[1:13:00] believed so much that he that he took
[1:13:02] him to an
[1:13:05] altar I don't know what I I don't have
[1:13:07] an idea what Isaac
[1:13:10] thought when he saw his father with a
[1:13:12] knife appear like this over
[1:13:17] him and God speaking to the
[1:13:21] angels look he's going to do it
[1:13:25] better go down and stop
[1:13:27] him can you imagine how fast that angel
[1:13:30] moved he already had his hand right
[1:13:35] here that's why it is important to
[1:13:37] instruct our
[1:13:40] children instruct them in the
[1:13:45] word maybe they might hear a little bit
[1:13:47] here and a little bit
[1:13:48] there and they might begin to
[1:13:52] stay that's all Isaac
[1:13:56] had he never had an experience with
[1:14:00] God Jehova never appeared to
[1:14:06] him so all he had to continue on
[1:14:10] forward was to see what his dad
[1:14:15] did that was his
[1:14:22] belief
[1:14:24] but after he found himself with
[1:14:28] God the scripture said that God appeared
[1:14:31] to
[1:14:34] him when one has an experience with
[1:14:38] God I know that each and every one of us
[1:14:41] here is
[1:14:44] different it doesn't matter if we're
[1:14:48] different nobody stays the
[1:14:52] same no one stays the same after that
[1:14:55] experience
[1:14:58] Peter Peter as brother Daniel said he
[1:15:01] had his
[1:15:05] issues but when Jesus went into the ship
[1:15:08] with
[1:15:13] them they wanted to pull the Nets but
[1:15:15] they couldn't because there was so much
[1:15:16] fish in
[1:15:18] them he
[1:15:20] stayed hooked himself
[1:15:26] he said what's going on here I fished my
[1:15:28] whole life there was no fish in the
[1:15:32] water that's how Isaac
[1:15:40] was so when God told Isaac where he
[1:15:42] needed to
[1:15:44] stay he began to
[1:15:47] work CU he had had experience with
[1:15:51] God he told him where to go and where to
[1:15:55] stay even if it was an ugliest
[1:15:59] place that was his
[1:16:01] place God was going to bless him
[1:16:04] there God was going to establish him
[1:16:10] there and he began to make the wells of
[1:16:13] his
[1:16:13] father they were actually already
[1:16:16] made they were
[1:16:21] covered the Philistines hated that
[1:16:24] family so
[1:16:27] much that they had come and filled those
[1:16:30] Wells with
[1:16:35] dirt and don't think it's just oh let me
[1:16:37] call this company and they could make a
[1:16:39] well company and make new
[1:16:42] well they had to dig it up
[1:16:46] themselves it's a lot of work to make a
[1:16:51] well but he began to work
[1:16:56] that's why God told him stay here I
[1:16:59] will that's why we go from Faith to
[1:17:02] Faith if something they don't give you
[1:17:05] it doesn't work out it doesn't work
[1:17:08] out just continue on
[1:17:13] forward he he found this well and he
[1:17:15] began to uncover
[1:17:18] it and when he got to the
[1:17:21] bottom the water began to come up
[1:17:24] forth the Philistines
[1:17:27] came they said what are you doing
[1:17:30] here this is our
[1:17:37] water can you imagine how much they had
[1:17:39] already
[1:17:43] worked they told them that's our
[1:17:46] water and they began
[1:17:48] to
[1:17:51] argue and ISAC he wasn't going to
[1:17:56] argue he just told his man get your
[1:17:58] tools and let's
[1:18:00] go he named that well
[1:18:04] esek because there there was enemy
[1:18:10] enity there was fight and
[1:18:13] contention and he was
[1:18:17] is the son of the father of the
[1:18:21] faith he wasn't going to go to the side
[1:18:24] and go fight with somebody over
[1:18:25] there just for a
[1:18:30] well when God had already told him he
[1:18:32] was going to bless
[1:18:37] him he took all his men and they
[1:18:40] left they went to another
[1:18:43] place they begin to
[1:18:46] dig and the same thing
[1:18:51] happened
[1:18:53] Philistines came and they said hey what
[1:18:55] are you still doing here this is our
[1:19:01] well in that
[1:19:04] well he also named
[1:19:08] it Isaac was a well
[1:19:15] Namer Abraham was an alter
[1:19:19] Namer it didn't matter where he was he
[1:19:21] always always made an
[1:19:25] altar it's for the enemy to know where
[1:19:27] he had
[1:19:29] been and where God had taken him out
[1:19:33] from and how God had blessed him with a
[1:19:35] strong Mighty
[1:19:37] hand that
[1:19:43] well he named it which means
[1:19:48] contention he wasn't going to be
[1:19:51] fighting
[1:19:55] the people of God are not fighting
[1:20:00] in our pastor just preached to
[1:20:04] us that seed doesn't fight
[1:20:10] seed but we can
[1:20:14] fight the contrary
[1:20:18] seed that the majority of the
[1:20:21] time it's in side of
[1:20:23] us we don't have to go that
[1:20:26] far we don't have to go look for fights
[1:20:29] out
[1:20:30] there the fight is
[1:20:34] here we have to take ourselves to the
[1:20:37] side that's what Isaac had to
[1:20:41] do he didn't want to
[1:20:48] fight he didn't he didn't care about
[1:20:51] their
[1:20:51] opinion
[1:20:55] he didn't care of his
[1:20:58] opinion if they came and told him hey
[1:21:00] that's my w but in this
[1:21:03] day we have an
[1:21:08] opinion if somebody comes and they say
[1:21:10] oh no it's not like
[1:21:13] that we get all bent out of
[1:21:16] shape and right away we want to
[1:21:21] fight we want to
[1:21:25] fight that's not the seed we want to
[1:21:27] fight
[1:21:30] with because our fight is against it's
[1:21:33] not against flesh and
[1:21:38] blood it's principalities and Spirits as
[1:21:41] our fight amen
[1:21:44] amen Abraham
[1:21:49] preached in Genesis 13
[1:21:53] verse
[1:21:59] eight and Abraham said unto lot let
[1:22:01] there be no
[1:22:06] strife and I pray thee between me and
[1:22:08] thee and between my Herdman and thy
[1:22:10] Herdman for we are
[1:22:14] Brethren amen
[1:22:18] amen that's what that's what
[1:22:21] Abraham
[1:22:23] that's why Isaac just got up and
[1:22:26] left at the
[1:22:29] end they came to a well which they dug
[1:22:33] up that the Philistines didn't know
[1:22:35] nothing
[1:22:39] about what the Philistines
[1:22:43] hated not what they were
[1:22:45] doing it's what they
[1:22:49] were
[1:22:51] they they could not see the descendants
[1:22:54] of
[1:22:55] Abraham they couldn't support
[1:22:57] them because they wouldn't stay
[1:23:01] still like our brother Daniel
[1:23:04] mentioned Satan has had 2,000
[1:23:07] years he couldn't he hasn't been able to
[1:23:09] stop us and he hasn't stopped us he
[1:23:18] can't so what is it that's going to take
[1:23:21] us
[1:23:25] to be able to take us to somewhere to to
[1:23:33] better and I don't know each and every
[1:23:35] one of your
[1:23:38] lives our pastor preached to
[1:23:43] us he preached to us about a
[1:23:46] love of that
[1:23:51] experience I read a
[1:23:57] quote where faith is a
[1:24:06] substance Peter didn't have the love
[1:24:09] John had in his
[1:24:14] heart John was an agency of the love of
[1:24:20] God can you imagine being the agent of
[1:24:27] love that someone that is low in in
[1:24:33] love that maybe is battling with
[1:24:35] whatever it
[1:24:37] is we're not going to begin to name
[1:24:40] anything because we don't want to enter
[1:24:42] into
[1:24:45] problems but what it has to
[1:24:48] say is that love conquers all things
[1:24:53] with love you can do
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:24:57] anything brother bam says that John was
[1:25:00] the agency of
[1:25:03] love he had found himself with
[1:25:10] God and the
[1:25:17] philes the Philistines could not stop
[1:25:19] Abraham or his
[1:25:21] descendant it's because
[1:25:26] Isaac Isaac had an experience Jehovah
[1:25:29] appeared to him and he spoke to
[1:25:35] him he was the agency of
[1:25:38] love and he connected
[1:25:41] there he was he found himself
[1:25:44] low and then he filled himself up with
[1:25:47] love and then after that they couldn't
[1:25:49] stop
[1:25:50] him nothing could stop
[1:25:57] him the Bible
[1:26:00] says in chapter or verse
[1:26:05] 12 Isaac also had his
[1:26:09] problems but he stayed stable in
[1:26:13] one he stayed there where God told him
[1:26:15] and he started to
[1:26:16] plant in verse
[1:26:21] 12 then then Isaac swed in the
[1:26:27] land and received in the same year
[1:26:31] 100f and the Lord blessed
[1:26:39] him and man waxed great and went forward
[1:26:42] and grew until he became very
[1:26:46] great he blessed him so
[1:26:51] much
[1:26:54] that that he began to grow in that
[1:26:58] place the Philistines began to hate him
[1:27:01] even
[1:27:07] more then Envy be uh
[1:27:12] came en Envy
[1:27:15] started but it was already too
[1:27:17] late God had already blessed
[1:27:19] him he had stayed faithful
[1:27:24] and God began to bless him and the Bible
[1:27:28] says you continue reading chapter
[1:27:32] 26 that the king
[1:27:34] came first of all the king R ran him out
[1:27:38] of
[1:27:40] town because he had gotten so
[1:27:45] powerful and he said you better leave
[1:27:47] because you're now powerful more
[1:27:48] powerful than
[1:27:49] me better just get out of here
[1:27:54] but for the time of the
[1:27:56] Harvest 100
[1:28:00] fold you that know how to
[1:28:07] add maybe he planted a field
[1:28:12] of 100 crop 100
[1:28:17] acres it got it grew real
[1:28:21] fast
[1:28:24] and the Bible says that fear began to
[1:28:28] enter fear began to enter into the
[1:28:31] king all his subjects in the
[1:28:35] kingdom and the Bible says that the king
[1:28:37] came to visit him and he brought men
[1:28:40] with
[1:28:41] him and what the king
[1:28:45] wanted he came in
[1:28:51] peace
[1:28:52] and he sub subjected himself to
[1:28:56] him he said look we come in
[1:28:59] peace what we
[1:29:02] want isn't an
[1:29:05] alliance we want to be
[1:29:08] friends we want
[1:29:11] Union because we fear your
[1:29:16] God because we see how God is with
[1:29:19] you first he ran him out of town
[1:29:23] then afterwards he wanted to be his
[1:29:28] friend that's all the things are
[1:29:32] brother the devil he doesn't sleep and
[1:29:34] he's not
[1:29:38] dumb where he's losing
[1:29:43] ground wanted to get ahead but you know
[1:29:48] what
[1:29:50] ISAC
[1:29:52] he believed so much in what he was he's
[1:29:54] standing
[1:29:56] on that he didn't take bad for
[1:30:01] bad that wasn't his
[1:30:06] characteristic his
[1:30:09] characteristic was that of his
[1:30:12] father he was a Son of
[1:30:15] God he wasn't going to pay bad for
[1:30:19] bad because they stole his Wells his
[1:30:21] water
[1:30:23] they treated them
[1:30:28] bad that's what a Christian
[1:30:30] does he don't pay bad for
[1:30:35] bad we don't pay bad for
[1:30:38] bad we pay
[1:30:41] good the Bible says that he made a a
[1:30:46] party gave them to
[1:30:48] eat fed
[1:30:50] them and he blessed
[1:30:53] them and sent them on his
[1:31:00] road when one stays
[1:31:07] faithful when you stay faithful in the
[1:31:09] place that God has called you
[1:31:11] to God has great
[1:31:15] plans don't try to figure out the
