[24:44] you
[24:57] testimony by your sister jen followed by
[25:00] a
[25:01] special by your sister rachel and
[25:03] immediately following her
[25:04] sister elizabeth gallego amen published
[25:25] i don't get up here as often as i should
[25:27] and
[25:29] come on but i have so much to be
[25:33] grateful for
[25:37] if i can get through this without crying
[25:54] it's really rare to get that sick from a
[25:56] gallbladder
[26:07] it happened and he almost died
[26:13] he knew it he felt it
[26:18] i saw it
[26:21] and we just cried out to the lord he
[26:23] seemed lamented
[26:26] he gave me a message to give to his
[26:28] children
[26:29] because he truly didn't believe that he
[26:31] was going to make it out of the
[26:32] emergency room
[26:37] yes and we couldn't take it anymore
[26:38] either we called our pastor
[26:45] our house our pastor happened to be at
[26:46] the same hospital at the same time
[26:49] as we were
[27:01] i promise you the spirit of the lord
[27:03] came down into that emergency room
[27:09] that piece came down like a blanket and
[27:12] it literally
[27:13] rocked my husband to sleep
[27:18] is
[27:32] they couldn't figure out his issue here
[27:33] so he was transferred to el paso
[27:41] and his liver was really congested and
[27:43] all the toxins and bile had backed up
[27:45] and spilled into his bloodstream
[27:53] he turned orange and he was so jaundiced
[27:55] his eyes were yellow
[28:02] his pancreas was so inflamed you could
[28:04] just see it
[28:05] out the top of his stomach
[28:13] the bilirubin was high his white blood
[28:15] cells were high
[28:16] his liver his pancreatic enzymes they
[28:19] were critical
[28:25] one of his enzymes just to give you an
[28:27] idea that they climbed
[28:28] from 6 000 to 9 000 and the normal range
[28:32] is 110.
[28:40] he was in so much pain the pain was just
[28:42] crippling
[28:48] there's nothing i could do to help him
[28:52] strangle a couple of nurses i'm just
[28:56] kidding
[29:02] because even though i couldn't do
[29:04] anything
[29:05] i knew that our lord could not
[29:12] i just cry and say lord increase my
[29:14] faith
[29:18] you've given me this mountain you have
[29:20] to give me the strength to get through
[29:22] it
[29:24] is
[29:29] not just by his word but he gave me
[29:31] friends
[29:32] he gave us family our church family
[29:38] foreign
[29:42] your phone calls your text messages your
[29:45] prayers
[29:46] visiting
[29:50] looking out for our son miranda
[30:04] he's come after our family in a lot of
[30:06] ways
[30:10] but we didn't get lost in the details
[30:14] we never let the doctors voices be
[30:16] louder in our minds and that still small
[30:18] voice inside
[30:25] seems like the devil turned the
[30:27] temperature up seven times with words
[30:29] like
[30:29] liver failure cancer he's gonna die
[30:34] el
[30:46] but that just made me smile because i
[30:48] knew
[30:49] jesus is the same yesterday today and
[30:51] forever
[30:57] and i remembered what he did back then
[30:59] when the heat got turned up on those
[31:00] three boys in the fiery furnace
[31:09] so that must mean nothing less than the
[31:10] fourth man is about to step in
[31:16] significantly
[31:23] [Music]
[31:27] his blood values started to improve and
[31:28] he was stable enough to get the surgery
[31:30] that he needed
[31:37] he's here he's healing
[31:41] and he's ready to serve another day i'm
[31:43] so great
[31:57] it's the greatest weapon it is love
[32:00] let me fight every day
[32:05] you gave me strength i love each and
[32:09] every one of you

[1:08:54] i wasn't serving the lord at the time
[1:08:58] i wasn't a bad person
[1:09:01] but i wasn't serving the lord
[1:09:14] what do i say to her what do i say to

[1:09:34] so in her in her hospital room i was
[1:09:36] singing church him
[1:09:37] everyone i could think
[1:09:43] and that's the only thing
[1:09:46] that would comfort

[1:10:29] why didn't i serve the lord before my
[1:10:31] mother got sick

[1:11:40] were the disciples good men
[1:11:45] were they good men
[1:11:50] they were preaching right he has
[1:12:20] jesus says go out and preach the gospel
[1:12:23] preach repentance
[1:12:31] so we're so were the apostles good man
[1:12:44] one of them betrayed jesus are you
[1:12:46] serious
[1:12:47] you're not jesus
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:13:13] you know what that's equivalent to today
[1:13:16] valencia
[1:13:30] foreign
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:44] how many
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:58] with him talk with him
[1:14:02] they ate with him
[1:14:08] and yet the things they did
[1:14:15] so we find out can you tell me youth
[1:14:19] which of the apostles had a natural
[1:14:26] death
[1:14:55] by herod by aron aron
[1:15:00] i'm sorry
[1:15:04] and how did peter die come on
[1:15:12] i heard someone say he was crucified
[1:15:16] upside down
[1:15:21] he wasn't aware being crucified like
[1:15:24] christ
[1:15:30] andrew was said to have been crucified
[1:15:34] andrew andres was said to have been
[1:15:36] crucified
[1:16:04] bartholomew was a martyr
[1:16:11] so they died some horrible deaths
[1:16:19] i'm going to cut through some of these
[1:16:21] these notes here
[1:16:34] so much that can be said
[1:16:41] but the devil we know always works in
[1:16:46] beauty
[1:16:48] he's going to make his road more
[1:16:51] beautiful than
[1:16:52] jesus's road
[1:16:56] camino more beautiful than the
[1:16:59] jesus's road
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:12] so if this is jesus's
[1:17:21] so can we be following jesus and then
[1:17:24] step on over
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:28] jesus
[1:17:35] i'll share a little something humor with
[1:17:37] you in a little bit here real quick
[1:17:41] well we can't do that we can't follow
[1:17:45] jesus one day and then
[1:17:47] follow satan the next jesus
[1:17:52] we get off the path with jesus
[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:04] and catch him where we left
[1:18:13] i just want to read a poem real quick
[1:18:16] i'll be finishing and asking brother
[1:18:18] jerry to come up
[1:18:22] remember youth is

[1:20:01] he then will ask my dear child
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:09] your card is all maxed out
[1:20:17] you know life is like a credit card
[1:20:21] why do we always doubt
[1:20:27] remember
[1:20:30] remember that jesus is always in charge
[1:20:38] why do we only pay the minimum
[1:20:42] after everything he does
[1:21:12] remember life is always very hard
[1:21:20] until we follow jesus each and every day
[1:21:26] and you
[1:21:40] god
[1:21:52] and god bless my brother jonathan
[1:22:06] yeah i didn't do anything i didn't want
[1:22:08] to do
[1:22:21] and a lot of it wasn't good
[1:22:25] you know i uh
[1:22:30] forgive me
[1:22:34] my mom passed away in january
[1:22:49] but me and jonathan were friends for
[1:22:51] many years
[1:22:55] we did a lot of things
[1:22:58] a lot of it wasn't good
[1:23:01] but i thank god that he never
[1:23:12] he introduced this word to me
[1:23:17] and for that i will always be grateful
[1:23:21] you know because because in a way
[1:23:25] in strong influence in my life
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:32] and a lot of it wasn't good
[1:23:36] right many young people have had
[1:23:39] influences
[1:23:41] in influences or being influenced once
[1:23:44] you influence yourself one way or the
[1:23:46] other
[1:24:01] i my mom didn't like brother jonathan i
[1:24:03] mean
[1:24:08] i don't want to say she hated him
[1:24:11] that's a strong word but she didn't like
[1:24:15] him
[1:24:17] and every time he would call me she
[1:24:19] would wouldn't let me know
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:24] because half the things we did weren't
[1:24:25] very good
[1:24:30] and i'm not doing this to shame brother
[1:24:32] jonathan but like i said i i
[1:24:33] a lot of things i did because i wanted
[1:24:36] to no
[1:24:36] no no but it goes
[1:24:41] i'm saying it for for a reason
[1:24:56] how many of us know friends from the
[1:24:58] world
[1:25:00] i may have friends that aren't
[1:25:02] christians
[1:25:04] and those friends that aren't christians
[1:25:07] sometimes aren't going to be a good
[1:25:09] influence i'm going to visit no one is
[1:25:39] was when he became king
[1:25:46] 16 years old that that
[1:25:49] at 16 years old that is a lot of
[1:25:51] responsibility right
[1:25:54] responsibility he had a lot of
[1:25:56] responsibility
[1:25:59] and we'll start with uh with first
[1:26:01] second kings 15.
[1:26:06] and we'll just start with verse one
[1:26:11] i'm like brother jonathan the words are
[1:26:13] getting smaller but
[1:26:14] i got some help
[1:26:20] and it reads like this in the 20th and
[1:26:24] 7th year
[1:26:25] 70th year of jeroboam king of israel
[1:26:29] be of israel began as a raya son of
[1:26:32] amaziah
[1:26:33] king of judea to reign
[1:26:44] 16 year old 16 years old was he when he
[1:26:47] began to reign
[1:26:48] and he reigned 2 and 50 years in
[1:26:51] jerusalem
[1:27:00] his mother's name was of jerusalem
[1:27:04] and he did that which was right in the
[1:27:06] sight of the lord
[1:27:09] according to all that his father amaziah
[1:27:11] had done
[1:27:28] because he was a he was a great king
[1:27:33] right usia was a great king right
[1:27:38] he did a lot of good things for the lord
[1:27:43] and he obeyed the lord the best he could
[1:27:49] you know and that's why i say there
[1:27:50] there there's a lot of influences out
[1:27:52] there
[1:27:55] yeah but sometimes we ourselves
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:11] but i can influence myself my own
[1:28:13] thoughts can influence me
[1:28:19] you know and that's why when i first
[1:28:21] came to the lord
[1:28:24] i i was i i didn't understand it you
[1:28:27] know
[1:28:28] you know i didn't i i didn't grow up you
[1:28:30] know
[1:28:32] coming to church i didn't grow up
[1:28:35] in this message that's why i say you you
[1:28:38] young people foreign
[1:28:43] my children included me you're very
[1:28:46] privileged
[1:28:48] to grow up in this world you know you
[1:28:51] have a beautiful word in front of you
[1:28:55] you have a road map in mapa that leads
[1:28:58] you that's leading you a certain way
[1:29:01] i had a road map
[1:29:05] but but the road is straight right
[1:29:22] i was born in los angeles you know in
[1:29:25] los angeles
[1:29:26] and uh i wouldn't say i had a a rough
[1:29:28] life
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:32] we struggle like like normal people do i
[1:29:35] guess you could say
[1:29:46] you know but i was i never knew there
[1:29:48] was a god
[1:29:50] i never knew jesus died on the cross
[1:29:55] i never knew all the things that he
[1:29:57] could do for you
[1:30:00] or he could do for me for me you know
[1:30:03] and we lived in in los angeles still
[1:30:05] till i was about 11 12 years old
[1:30:10] and we had to leave very quickly
[1:30:15] this is just a short testimony
[1:30:18] but we had to leave very quickly
[1:30:21] because my dad wasn't a very good guy
[1:30:25] you know he never knew the word
[1:30:30] he was uh he was a heroin addict
[1:30:34] he was addicted to drugs and
[1:30:37] i saw as a as a as a young kid i saw a
[1:30:40] lot
[1:30:44] many things people your age shouldn't
[1:30:46] see much
[1:30:51] you know just i mean they seem funny now
[1:30:56] but you should never have to see those
[1:30:58] things
[1:31:00] you know an example was my my dad was
[1:31:03] always wanted by the police
[1:31:08] and it's it's not on fact it's not like
[1:31:10] new mexico
[1:31:12] no mexico yes you have a warrant
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:29] on your door in los angeles they
[1:31:32] they they wanted you
[1:31:35] so my dad was always he was like i said
[1:31:38] he was in trouble i'm not trying to
[1:31:39] shame the guy but
[1:31:40] but but it's just just an example
[1:31:56] police department open the door
[1:32:00] well my dad would jump out of bed and he
[1:32:01] would jump out the window and my mom
[1:32:03] would be like no hold on hold on i'll be
[1:32:04] right there
[1:32:09] by the time she opened the door he was
[1:32:11] gone
[1:32:13] and this happened many times yesterday
[1:32:16] you know and here i'm like what is he
[1:32:17] doing you know
[1:32:20] there's a front door you know
[1:32:25] but uh there was there was one time
[1:32:28] where they
[1:32:29] they caught on to him
[1:32:32] they knew he was stalling
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:38] he
[1:32:46] and the next thing you know all i heard
[1:32:48] was a big old crash
[1:32:52] so they kicked the door in front so he
[1:32:55] didn't have
[1:32:56] time to get very far so he gets me out
[1:32:58] of bed
[1:33:02] puts me in the shower tells me to
[1:33:05] undress
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:17] so he says when you hear them come stick
[1:33:19] your head out the
[1:33:20] the
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:38] you know i guess they didn't want to go
[1:33:40] you know little kid in the shower you
[1:33:41] know
[1:33:46] those are some of the things i saw as a
[1:33:48] young kid
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:52] and it's not good you know i was even in
[1:33:55] the bathroom
[1:33:57] [Music]
[1:33:58] when he was injecting him
[1:34:06] i saw him so drugged up that that they
[1:34:08] took him out in a straight jacket
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:14] things that we shouldn't see that's
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:43] they would have hurt pretty much the
[1:34:45] whole family
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:47] because he mixed up he did something
[1:34:51] well i don't know if anybody's heard of
[1:34:53] the mexican mafia
[1:34:56] mexicana if you look it up they're
[1:34:58] pretty rough
[1:35:01] so anyway we had to we had to move i
[1:35:03] mean when we're in house one day
[1:35:05] and a week later we're in new mexico
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:12] central of all places
[1:35:15] central and mexico of all places
[1:35:19] and i hated it i i was miserable
[1:35:24] could you imagine los angeles to
[1:35:40] where i where i lived in central dundee
[1:35:44] in central and i don't know if you know
[1:35:47] if anybody remembers central if they
[1:35:49] lived there in in about 1981-82
[1:35:55] okay there was a car wash right right
[1:35:57] into town
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:01] right when you turn in there's a car
[1:36:03] wash right there on the corner
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:07] i believe it'd be to the right
[1:36:10] and then across the street there was a
[1:36:11] house
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:15] and then there was like some log cabins
[1:36:20] and a gas station
[1:36:36] my back door when i walk out my back
[1:36:38] door
[1:36:41] because if you go down to the back of
[1:36:43] the house there was a creek right that
[1:36:45] ran through there
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:37:10] [Music]
[1:37:13] you know and i say that as a story
[1:37:15] because because as like i said as i grew
[1:37:17] up it wasn't
[1:37:18] i i didn't
[1:37:30] you know my mom and dad separated when i
[1:37:32] was in junior high school
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:38] and it wasn't it wasn't good you know
[1:37:42] so that's when i started doing the
[1:37:44] things that i wanted to do
[1:37:45] in business
[1:37:55] [Music]
[1:37:59] but then i met the lord
[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:54] i still have friends like jonathan's
[1:38:58] they're not friends they were
[1:38:59] acquaintances
[1:39:02] these are my friends right here these
[1:39:06] are your friends in life
[1:39:08] these are your friends that will stick
[1:39:10] by you through thick
[1:39:28] got to that point right i mean he did a
[1:39:31] lot of good for the lord
[1:39:34] he was a good man but he got to a point
[1:39:37] and he felt in his heart that
[1:39:39] he could do whatever he wanted
[1:39:45] right he thought he could do a certain
[1:39:47] thing
[1:39:49] he thought he could do a certain thing
[1:40:20] he got so mad at them for them trying to
[1:40:22] stop it
[1:40:25] and the lord gave him leprosy
[1:40:30] and that's the way i i felt one at one
[1:40:32] point in my life
[1:40:45] he brought me from this situation
[1:40:48] to this
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:41:00] so here comes the friends achieving los
[1:41:04] amigos the influences
[1:41:06] las influences they say hey jerry
[1:41:08] remember hey how you doing i haven't
[1:41:09] seen you in a while
[1:41:13] hey let's go hang out over here
[1:41:39] where the young people struggle and not
[1:41:41] just young people but everybody in
[1:41:42] general is
[1:41:46] but the lord is after the future of the
[1:41:48] church i mean the devil is after the
[1:41:51] future of the church
[1:41:54] because he knows if he can put a stop to
[1:41:56] it
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:42:12] plan he cannot stop god's plan
[1:42:16] in your life
[1:42:19] he cannot stop god plan in your life
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:23] because the devil is a roaring
[1:43:04] actually if he wants to do anything to
[1:43:06] any of you
[1:43:08] guys
[1:43:21] the power he had over me i gave it to
[1:43:23] him
[1:43:26] because i had influences
[1:43:30] that wanted me to make the enemy to
[1:43:33] start doing the things that i used to do
[1:43:35] okay
[1:43:48] but we have to do away with the
[1:43:51] influences
[1:43:54] now we're going to have to deal with
[1:43:56] this world
[1:43:59] yes we are we're going to need to deal
[1:44:01] with people
[1:44:04] we're going to have friends of this
[1:44:05] world
[1:44:07] but they only want to do one the devil
[1:44:09] only wants to do one thing
[1:44:13] to everybody and the young people
[1:44:17] he wants to shame your testimony
[1:44:20] testimonial
[1:44:24] because right what is it what does the
[1:44:25] word say we are written epistles
[1:44:30] of all men basically
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:47] people saw my life
[1:44:50] the crazy thing is i told him i was
[1:44:51] going to church
[1:44:55] but there i was drinking with him
[1:44:59] i was a stumbling block for that person
[1:45:04] because i was saying one thing
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:07] but my life portrayed another thing
[1:45:10] [Music]
[1:45:12] so i'm responsible for that life
[1:45:27] you want to live the best life you can
[1:45:31] we want to live the best godly life
[1:45:36] we got to do away with the influence
[1:45:42] influences
[1:45:53] because one day
[1:45:56] the day you're born your book
[1:46:00] starts right
[1:46:03] well we all have a book the day we're
[1:46:06] born our book starts
[1:46:10] one day
[1:46:23] i could leave here
[1:46:26] after service
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:30] you know and god forbid i can get in an
[1:46:32] accident
[1:46:35] i don't know but one day your book's
[1:46:38] gonna close
[1:46:41] so what are we doing right now in this
[1:46:44] moment what are we doing right now that
[1:46:47] when our book closes you're going to say
[1:46:50] we know where we're going we
[1:47:05] and my own thoughts proposed
[1:47:08] started to betray me
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:13] because there was times where i didn't
[1:47:14] need anybody
[1:47:18] to go do what i was going to do but i
[1:47:20] said
[1:47:48] there's only one
[1:48:00] is not true
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:52] that's what gets the devil out of bed
[1:48:56] he's not out of bed because you're
[1:48:58] sitting here and coming to church
[1:49:03] because he's the first one here
[1:49:07] he's the first one here but when he gets
[1:49:10] out of bed
[1:49:12] is
[1:49:26] and who their
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:52] but with the lord jesus christ on our
[1:49:55] side
[1:49:57] with the lord jesus christ fighting for
[1:50:00] us
[1:50:02] we can make it we don't have to
[1:50:06] to and that's how king josiah got he was
[1:50:08] he was boasting
[1:50:10] he says
[1:50:13] i'm this great man oh you say brittany
[1:50:16] and he was
[1:50:17] but he let it set in his heart that he
[1:50:19] was this great man but that he could do
[1:50:21] whatever he wanted
[1:50:50] we have
[1:50:55] in closing as the musicians come
[1:51:01] i want to read something here brother
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:46] uncensored
[1:51:50] where they curse not the maltesen and
[1:51:52] use god's name in vain
[1:51:55] and that ain't going on today
[1:51:59] because i was watching a tv program on
[1:52:01] regular tv
[1:52:05] and they were dropping f-bombs like
[1:52:07] crazy
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:12] and it used to be wrong for the children
[1:52:15] in the holiness churches to go to
[1:52:17] to bioscopes or picture shows
[1:52:29] um and now saying gotta jump one jump
[1:52:32] ahead
[1:52:36] by bringing it right in the house
[1:52:39] in the form of television and then
[1:52:42] uncensored
[1:52:43] you know and and that
[1:52:46] and so forth you see and that's satan's
