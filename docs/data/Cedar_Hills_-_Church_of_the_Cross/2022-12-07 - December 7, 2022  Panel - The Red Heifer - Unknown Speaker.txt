it comes directly from your throne in your precious name we ask all things amen amen you may be seated amen we're this first scripture we're going to read is a little lengthy so yesterday so we kind of just wanted for right now we like to stand during the reading the word but this scripture we want to take it but before we get started you know our pastor's birthdays today we from the bottom of our hearts you know we just we want to thank him and his family you know for over for me it's been but I mean 23 24 years that we've we've been here let's pick this up from the ground he showed us who God really is and he's lived the Life of Christ all my life to him I know the rest of you could probably say the same thing and he is he loves God's people and we just we love you Pastor yeah amen let us turn to the Book of Numbers we want to lay really really quick here a foundation of of where that red heifer comes from and brother Milo's going to read and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded thing speak unto the children of Israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spots wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke is and ye shall give her unto Eliza the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face and now he is the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of the congregation seven times and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn yet and the priest shall take Cedarwood and his up and Scarlet and take it into the midst of the burning of the heifer is then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and with the priest shall be unclean until the evening [Music] and hear that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh and water and shall be unclean until the evening [Music] and a man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of Separation it is the purification for sin is an expression amen so as we get into this you know there's there's quite a bit of um symbols here quite a bit of Shadows but before we get into it when this ceremony took place you know at the end of the day what it came what came of it it was called water of Separation to get to our foundation we have to go all the way back to where it came from and even it even started before Moses the ordinance that God gave Moses and Aaron so we gotta go all the way back to Abraham yeah because to me that's where our foundation is here fundamental because God told Abraham separate yourself from the bad stuff you know he wanted him separate from the worldly things and that was it yes so it's easy to separate from that stuff is but God really wanted he wanted to show us something here God told Abram separate yourself this as Believers this is where it hurt Abraham uh separate yourself from your family from your father so it we start here and if there's anything that I've realized through these Waters of Separation how we take for granted the blood that Jesus because you go and you we dig into what this red hat for the meaning of it really is it's something that's so real to them that God came with the law and in those those times if they didn't abide by the laws it was death so now you take the other part of it now they knew they were God's people so they believed in something they believed in what God had placed there for them now we come many years later and many times it's easy to be laxed and this is [Music] and we take God's blood for granted because you we go into history how how many of these ceremonies took place Brothers in the history of the all the history of the Jews it has been performed nine times foreign now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy Father's House unto the lamb that I will show thee and I will make thee of a great nation and I will bless thee thou make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing is sorry Genesis 12 1-5 foreign and I will bless them that bless thee and I will curse him that cursed thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed is so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abram was 70 and 5 years old when he departed out of Iran foreign and all their substance that they had together and the souls that they had gotten in Iran and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they came so so here here is the beginning God gave him the environment and then here he talks about the promise but did Abraham do what God asked no he didn't no no Senor his nephew and he took off to his father see when God comes he calls for a total separation and many times it's a separation even from your own self he said a complete separation from your country and from yours from your family's house God calls for that total separation how many how many could find ourselves there today Matthew 10 36. just so you could see what how his complete word comes comes into place and the man's foe shall be they of his own house more than me is not worthy of me know his dignity me and he that loveth his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of noise and he that taketh not his cross and follow with me is not worthy of Me no dignity so you could see how you know it's easy to say it's passing the city but God's blessings come on he calls for a total separation so now that now that we now that we got the foundation here fundamental now we we could truly get into the Waters of Separation because time we don't have a lot of time here church so when was the heifer first mentioned first with Abraham because the ordinance is that he that started they started first with Abraham says then they transitioned and that's where we find the ordinance today does God had already told Abraham you got to take the heifer you got to take the round you got to take the pigeons so it had already started so Moses had already knewed these ordinances but God says now it's time to get serious you saw how I expected a separation from Abrams now it comes with you total separation so we have here most yes heifer is a Baka and I'm gonna ask brother Milo here he heard Danny really understands really understand the criticalness of of breeding animals and what God really expects is you mind sharing with them what what the expectations of the or the qualifications of this ever happened yeah so this red heifer it's not just an ordinary cow is qualifications that it has to be qualifications were to be used for the ceremony a few that I have found foreign any work done with the um disqualifies it in this case includes even a person leaning on it or placing a garment or cloth upon it [Music] unless this was done to safeguard the animal itself placing a yoke when you work as we see Christ he was this this heifer is typing Christ was never yoked up with the Sadducees and the Pharisees if the heifer is pregnant or even a male mated with it has disqualified it is so we see how how rare it is to find one of these red heifers brother Isaac was the last time that the red that there was a red effort over 2000 years ago Milo said it had to be totally red I mean red um red red heifer red hoofs red nose red eyes two thousand years there there has not been a perfect one down yes yes perfecta the most tremendous part about this is not that they haven't found one is that God's in full control is what he's doing all the way till man tries to take it in his own hands and begins to try to mix it that's why when we get into this next part they see how critical God's law is he wants to make sure we abide by it is through his laws you know because the scripture told us exactly what what he has here but we wanted to get into the Jewish laws see what those exact requirements are yeah to make sure it matched up with verse two that we read because it wasn't just no spots but he said I don't want even a yoke to be honest animal why because this Shadow it was shadowing something it was shadowing the real thing that was to come we know that Christ is there was no yoke on him what it did what what God didn't want to happen was the symbol of that joke upon that cow a symbol of the Legos the Yoke of denominations like if you go to the denominational the Yoke of sin the Yoke of unbelief painted that picture clear for us he says those total separation because we're going to get to the ashes next and this is what makes up those ashes let us let us read before we go so just so that we have a good foundation this was a thinking man's filter is and it gives it's it's going to give the start to finish but it Paints the picture perfectly for us notice in Exodus 19 79 I want to to read it when you go home when you have more time notice when Israel had committed sin observances first they took a red heifer which had never had a yoke on her neck this means she was never was yoke up with anything and she had to be read the color red color is an atonement color you know science knows that if you look if you take red through red is Blanco look through red at Red Rojo it's white it's black he looks through the red blood of the Lord Jesus and our red sins become as white as snow investors and the heifer was killed in the evening time [Music] by the whole Congregation of Israel and there was put seven Stripes of her blood upon the door foreign this is the type of the seven Church ages by the blood is and then her body was taken and burnt it was burnt with the hoof everything was burned together and it had to be picked up by a clean man Olympia and it had to be put in a clean place outside the congregation therefore if Israel could only see the type is this word of God is must not be handled by dirty hands of unbelief that is not even imagine just as a minister to read this you see how critical it is when we come is handle God's word because the law required it to be completely clean is that it had no blemish when your hands touched it ceremony and if he's clean is it Olympia he had to come through God's filter a clean man Clean Hands and had to be kept in a clean place not a place where Jezebels and Ricky's those Ricky's and everything partaking take the communion and things when they're running around with wives and husbands esposos in all kinds of fields going to dances and parties fiestas and wearing bob hair shorts and everything else call themselves Christians it's to be kept in a clean place and recognized that they had done wrong then they were sprinkled with the ashes of this heifer upon them and that was the water of Separation a purification for sin una purification notice here it is and when Israel before they could come into Fellowship Israel in the worship they had to first pass to the Waters of Separation justification by faith commit by hearing then they entered into the congregation under those seven Stripes to show that something died and went before them for their sins they were separated by hearing the word the Waters of Separation then entered into Fellowship the only place that God met a man and God only meets you today in one place and that's in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ he is the word Elizabeth and the Waters of separation and his blood was shed for all seven Church ages and then by the Holy Spirit we enter into that Fellowship which is only given to the church oh how great he is can you give one to the Lord oh my God God's word doesn't [Applause] that we got to come through the washing of the Water by the word there's a reason why one of my favorite scriptures is and he says I heard by the hearing hearing of myself but now my eyes you know because that's where Revelation comes for yeah first we got to be purged we gotta be clean olympiados so before they even burned this red heifer is there's a couple of things that happened when they kill the red heifers the scripture verse 3 tells user the priest he dipped his finger in that blood and he sprinkled it seven times before the temple or before the Tabernacles or before the congregation that's why the prophet of God says that's why when they would enter they saw that something died which was the seven seven Church ages towards the Tabernacle and did the seven times signifying seven dispensations for the seven years that that the church would be sprinkled by the blood upon that heifer and also in another place uh brother Branham says seven times showing that it was a public testimony before the people that an innocent substitute had died for a guilty victim a a public testimony a public testimony to everyone who passed that way know that they were coming under the blood of an innocent substitute of their sins and as brother brother Ben was saying for it was the water of Separation purification and that that's what the Jews have have as we've been saying have been waiting for all this time Why seven times because there was sin in every age seven times the blood was sprinkled making an atonement standing in the state of judgment seven times there the heifer was put into the fire and was burned up to ashes and it it had to be the the Scarlet hyssop is put together and and burnt which meant the dispositions of Grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit through Cedarwood hyssop and Scarlet and all was burnt together and many many say oh if you if you just touch the dead body then this had to you you had to go through this this process I like what the prophet how he puts it here he says as any man had did wrong or anything these ashes is the senesis of his heifer was placed upon him and he was separated from his guilt yes it was it was a separation because an animal could not take away the sin it was a covering or a separation many many uh say this was was a it's a ritual ritual gun um again I like the way the thank God for a prophet amen [Music] he says here separation and Memorial through all their generations to know that his heifer a selected heiferous in the blood stood between him and the church ashes it made a separation between him and his guilt and when when when when you see that in place and you place it on Christ Jesus Jesus how that when we do guilt we look at the separation and he who stood at the Judgment there yeah and his blood was dipped from his body and sprinkled across the Earth between that and God's holy Tabernacle introduces that listen here that every believer coming into his presence breaking through the veil of Flesh or in a way the things of the world knows that the blood makes an atonement the Waters of Separation as brother Ben was saying the by the washing of the Water by the word I mean a consecrated life walking in this present world without condemnation and we all know the scripture foreign [Music] as anointed them by the Holy Ghost it I remember brother Ben as a young man he would always say it's got to get personal um leave it back in history and said it was the congregation is but it was sprinkled upon the individuals and he walks in the present world free from condemnation by the Holy Spirit foreign brought out in the presence of all the being out of the presence of Eliza the high priest that was the significance of the seven times thank you brother Isaac can you imagine Isaiah 1 18 just just too tired and come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be read like Crimson they shall be as wool okay so now now we now we can get a little further here you know brother Isaac did a wonderful wonderful job seven Stripes it's a very rare animals red Roja red meat Roja but when they burned it together what color did the ashes come to yeah red to Red Rojo comes y here God is is rich in his word so now they come you know we read the scripture already part of that animal even to the waste of it burn it completely the Bible says there's three things that got mixed in that fire that's what we're going to cover right now um Cedarwood yeah this is powerful it says Amen brother Ben before we get into the cedar wood this would like for us all to realize how important this is this is not something that this it's for history it's like what brother Ben used to say we got to get personal tonight you have to bring it what good would it be for this red heifer to read about it to learn about it back in history why do you guys keep on saying I used to say yeah [Laughter] all right and so what good would it do for me if I left it there in the Bible but if this Bible doesn't come alive and it doesn't do something for me right now it doesn't do anything for you right now where you're sitting and what are we doing here just warming a bench I'm talking to myself here put it on [Music] but the Bible says though your sins be read as Crimson um they should be white as snow okay God looking through the blood don't see you as a sinner he sees us redeemed and why we are redeemed because he sees us through Christ that's the reason we could be made perfect not in the sense that we are sinless [Music] but perfect in the eyes of God because we are in Christ that's the reason he said be perfect even as my Father in Heaven is perfect perfect we see Paul in the 10th chapter of Hebrews he's trying to explain the law having a shadow of good things to come is [Music] not the very image of things could make the comma perfect could make the comer the worshiper because God was looking at that time he was looking through the blood of an animal but now he looks through the blood of his own son we see that Perfection comes through Jesus Christ the blood of an animal could never take sin away but the blood of Jesus completely removes Sin from the worshipers so what you're saying is is when they did this ordinance they still left the same desire foreign now Cedarwood is a very tremendous type of wood it is first of all one of the toughest Woods is out there yeah yeah it is resistant to disease it is well known for its quality and preciousness does anyone know why it's so precious it's a white word with red streaks which speaks of the righteousness of the Cross and the red streaks speak of the blood that make it righteous all right man the cedar tree grows tall imposing of the white symbolizing if he can say that again imposing with a wide blancho symbolizing adines artiness this word was used to build the house of King David it's the it's the fusalem as well for the temple that Solomon built we see how precious this wood is right the next material I was put into it was scarletta Scarlett was sheep's wool died in Blood and to be there in Sangre he was bleeding that was the Scarlet that was put into the waters so Redemption comes through the blood all the way from Genesis to Revelation there's a Genesis there's a red streak of redemption let's take Rahab the Harlot brother Branham says that rahab's house stood on the walls of Jericho when all the rest of it because there was a scarlet cord um hanging outside let's take the children of Israel brother Ben um the children of each of Israel in Egypt and a hippo oh it was commanded that the eldest son be killed but brother Isaac what did they do yes that they would be saved it's because there was blood on the lintel the doorpost is the death angel to pass do we see how important this is how many of us parents have placed that blood on the doorpost of our lentils [Music] and brother Isaac's going to talk to us a little bit about the third one which is now for the brand brother Brandon I'll just hit the highlights here to save time he's saying it uh it was a just a common weed that grew in the Middle East is and that it even grows out out of the cracks of the walls there is then he says what do they speak of what did it speak of faith faith it's a faith just common faith come on and he says you think you have to have to have some Supernatural Faith to get something from God just common Faith come on you you've just got to apply the blood if you're sitting here now and you never met Jesus in your in your life just apply that simple faith that brought you to this building you don't got to go to a theology school learn some great long Creeds the only thing you have to know is that Jesus died to save Sinners Jesus and his blood washes you white as snow is and he says that is simple childlike faith is so if you're sick tonight apply that simple common Faith oblique is uh so so hyssop was it it's it's a part of the uh the mint family is I I have a couple pictures of the hyssop if they want to want to put them up and it the Greek word uh is his full his his sopos and and the Hebrew word azob the delivery was up meaning holy herb the significant and it was used in ancient times as a cleansing herb for temples and other sacred places in symbolic form and it represents humility repentance and sacrifice sacrificio the cleansing effect in connection with with the with plagues chest ailments and a simple form of in cleansing of the cleansing the soul you know simple formal Olympia and and as brother Branham it says here the the cedar the hyssop all that that was burned with with the heifer is on yeah it spoke of Christ on the cross as brother Ben was saying it it was it was the same same Bush it was applied uh on on the door lentils replica meaning Christ himself the the Cedar and the history Christ is inseparable you can separate the cross and different things and mean this that or the other is but Christo you cannot separate the whole bush has to be there he says it was the same Bush that was that grew along the the Jordan River so foreign worry all right sorry one one of the one of the important ones that got me was important you don't have to turn I'll just refer to it it's John 19 29. this is this is Jesus on the cross now there was said a vessels full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth is thank you all for that so you see how God knew what he was doing when he described these three elements so now we have God put a law into action did you know that that law is still in effect today we don't realize but every time you wash your hands it is still in effect today because one of one of the mo one of the strongest purifications but foreign sprinkle it for the sins of the people but brother Abraham where did they get the water from the pool of him so that God wanted it to be so clean yes God wanted this so clean yes on the back of not a cow you know but now the male part on the back of a bull because God says he has to be clean yes feet touch the ground he will no longer be clean yeah he wrote on the bull all the way to Siloam to get that water that was moved once once a year when the Holy Spirit came from but what fed into silence the stream of the home it was one of the streams that came from where Brother Carlos is so I have one question tonight through their Traditions they took the these ashes from the previous heifers and they mix them together with the new ceremony but as we heard in some of the panels with highness all the ashes from the heifer were gone and and done away with dollars so even if they find a heifer where are they going to get the ashes from the previous heifers simple essential God is just going to have to call the same one ceremonial that he gave these ordinances well with with Carlos Hill's permission he doesn't have a man after on this little yeah enough for a reason yeah okay so we got a foundation fundamento we find that Abraham started the separation and he searched for a city and the place that he searched foreign and Moses took the Tabernacle and pitched it without the camp a far off from the camp and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that everyone which sought the Lord went out of the Tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp Exodus 40 verse 1 and 2. 0 foreign and the Lord spake unto Moses saying on the first day of the first month thou shall set up the Tabernacle of the tent of the congregation you read verse two yes okay people in this message think that is coming back in a 10th Ministry brother Branham wanted a tent when he was in his first but then [Music] keeps going around the world foreign [Music] foreign we have such an high priest who has set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in Heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched the true Tabernacle yeah to me Glory did you read who he says that God preached he was supposed to then you pitched the tent come on foreign remember night is a Jewish Sage said when the tenth heifer comes from it will introduce the Messiah in order to build a little town they need a red helper this is Moses sacrificed the first one and when the white actions were almost gone they killed another heifer mixing the edges of the first heifers with the other one until they killed the ninth one in order to build another Temple the entire site has to be purified critical so they got we just reading the paper was that they wrote about five heifers red heifers from Texas so everybody's thinking now the Messiah can come this is not no matter how perfect those heifers they came from Texas they cannot use those perfect heifers in Israel because it has to be a heifer that was born in Israel and not in Texas hmm they have no ashes he was destroyed when General Titus burned down Jerusalem so the question arises why couldn't or other kind of animals the question arises why are they using a heifer to make ashes red heifers are extremely rare is and the water they use for the ceremony ceremony well Ben already told us follow me here and may God give you Revelations this is now I know that this will kind of choke you is a little bit you don't read the Bible just like this he said you read between the lines and then you make the picture come on and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gather themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us for as this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we want not what is become of him is Conte isn't that is happening now and happen all the time Moses delayed the people saying well Jesus has delayed his comments so they got a big God now like the pope Grande happened right here second Peter 3 verses 3 and 4. knowing this verse that there shall come the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of Creation in verse 9 also the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but in long-suffering to towards usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance is [Music] repentance so how are they going to rule taking all the gold so where did that Spirit of the gold star Exodus 32 2 to 4. and Aaron said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them to me and and all the people break off their Golden Earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto Aaron Antonio and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a grieving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy Gods o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt Israel foreign on one side the double at the Dome of the Rock and Domo and on the other side so they identify the Temple mount with Mount Moriah and when the Jews pray they look to this place is animals sacrifices for burnt offerings for only to be offered by the hands of the Jewish priesthood as they were marching through the desert sacred pastors were only allowed in the Tabernacles after building the first temple this first the country sacrifices were allowed only in the temple in Jerusalem and when it was destroyed sacrifices resumed in the second temple after the destruction of the second temple sacrifices were prohibited sacrifices foreign [Music] again to pray at the holy side yes so Israel officially United East Jerusalem Israel including the Temple mount with the rest of Jerusalem including including the mountain in the template so under Jerusalem but the United Nations Security Council is declared to be in violation of international laws and gave it back to Jordan to take and follow the Temple Mount but a controller Temple El Monte del templo in the gospels we learned that God will return again to the Jews well if that be so yes how can we apply it back to the times of Daniel we've got to apply it in this last age and it's after the Gentile church has been gone he has a special like because he deals with Israel as a nation and it took 49 years to complete the temple in concert and they build it in troubles and times does that sound familiar yes and when they rejected the Messiah Daniel 9 27 Daniel Nueva ventis diet and and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of Abominations he shall make it desolate even into the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate solar I always thought that Elijah and Moses were coming in the first three and a half years out of the 70 weeks of Daniel Kevin Jesus preached the first three and a half years of the 70th week and it says you're at the middle of the week he was cut off there was when he was crucified crucified are coming in the last three and a half years after seven days because it's only for the Jews the 70 weeks is oh how much right notice he can say When They Crucified him on the crucified God is dealing with the Jews he just said but the time extended just a little further yeah 40 years more later General Tyler's destroyed Jerusalem despite externality Jerusalem because he took God holy years to tear up the temple and Scattered the Jews all over the world of course using general Titus God didn't deal with them anymore and he shall send his angels with the great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the others we know that those trumpets is Moses to call them back to the atonement the Jews rejected the atonement so your eyes and mine could be okay and during this time the seals open and the
