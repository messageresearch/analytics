to uh follow it on your phone and iPad you're more than welcome to just uh please keep the volume off amen and God bless you it's good to be back again tonight thankful we have this opportunity again now to serve the Lord and after keeping you so long last night I feel it wouldn't be fair to keep you long again tonight just back there listening to an associate brother of ours in the Lord had just come from Indiana stirred by a strange dream he's never been in streetport before in his life but he dreamed the other night that he come to spport not by his car he come with uh or come somewhere to a church where I was speaking he said after I preached and prayed for the people said something's going to happen said he was back the next day and he said he knew the building how it looks said there's a there's a Civic Auditorium across the street but they never went in the auditorium says on this side in a stone building it had a wing to it and the building sat just like this and the the boy is a dreamer I've seen his dreams and know that they're true and he said um and he said then on the last night that I was speaking and praying for the sick and I said something's fixing to happen and said like a clap of thunder and said people get screaming and said as the Thunder began to go away I said it made a voice and begin speaking say as that speaking was going on that through these lates windows up here come the glory of God moving in in the form of the pillar of fire he's never seen it he's heard us talk about it but he's never seen himself and said there it was come through the windows like that and form that light like you see in the picture right above the audience here and said was rumbling off something and said I stood and said that is Jehovah God and said he was reminded of when thinking about it when Moses called the brought the people out of Egypt and they said let Moses speak and not God lest we die said everybody was laying on the floor their hands up screaming said he was screaming too Lord God I love you I love you and his wife shook him and woke him up see him going down the aisle right now brother Jackson a former Methodist preacher and um he was so Disturbed till he come down and said when he walked in he was so astounded just exactly the way he had saw it in a dream prise I don't know what it means the Lord's kept it from me but something could happen seeing brother Jackson dream that knowing me as an honest real real man servant of God and I I know I've been dreaming dreams coming to me the lord gave me an interpretation it' be just perfectly like that even the one time I going to Arizona he had the dream of it and he's very much Disturbed he's with his wife he brought her she used to be mother right away and the only way he could go would buy airplane he didn't have a penny to come and somebody give him the money and so it's kindy worked out mysteriously so something could happen we hope so we don't know just what the Lord will provide for us now we are grateful to the Lord to be living in the day that we're living in just before the coming of Jesus as I've said before it's the greatest time of all history I'd rather be living right now than anytime uh to on Earth I see here in front of us again tonight is my good friend Brother D I mentioned him in the auditorium this morning brother doubt is 93 years old today how blessed it is he contributes his long life to the glory and praise of God 93 today happy birthday to you my brother and I know out of down around the country where they're listening in tonight they also wish brother Bill da a happy birthday a very personal friend or Roberts and he's helped so many in the gospel way and everything he's a great friend of ours glad to see brother man here another Methodist preacher saved and baptized with the Holy Ghost and in the name of Jesus Christ sitting here he's also one of our Associates from Indiana and I understand brother Hickerson sitting here by him one of our deacons from Jeffersonville Indiana they're listening in up there tonight and I understand that brother um wheeler one of the other Deacons are here somewhere and uh I um haven't located him just yet somebody pointing their fingers over and I'll catch him after a bit I'm setting over way over to the right yes brother Banks Woods if you're listening in tonight your brother was your last night I seen him as it went out brother L Jehovah Witness the whole group was converted L was brought in because the vision of the Lord L was sitting in the boat there that day when the day before for was told him that something was going to happen concerning a resurrection of life he was a real Jehovah Witness too but that morning sitting there fishing and he caught well he had a great big old that Kentucky fashion you know big hook and a little bitt of fish swallowed it and he just pulled gills inals and all out throw it out on the water little bitty Sunfish he said a little fell you shot your ass wad it a little flipping along on the water died and wind blowed him up into some Pond lies and the day before setting I said the Holy Spirit tells me that there will be a resurrection of some little creature perhaps it be a a kitten when to get back home because just but when we trying to dig some fish bait brother woods and I who was listening in the night my little girl which is a young woman sitting here engaged to this linky Soldier I see she come up she said Daddy her and other little girl said we uh anybody can have any kind of pet they want but I sure don't like a cat so she no brandom so we she said all we found a poor old cat out here Daddy it's um it's eat something and it's somebody's poisoned it it's all swelled up said Daddy it's going to die right away can we get a little box and keep it a couple days I said let me see the cat well they went and got the cat I see what's going to happen so we give her a box next morning about seven or eight kittens there you know so my little boy joob picked one of them up and squeezed it and dropped it on the ground and just just a little fell there wiggling around and around killed it and I said to brother L his brother I said you know it may be that'll be that little kitten raised up like we have seen the Lord do things brother L just knew in the way the Holy Spirit just told him his married and what he had done and the evils he had done the things he had done when he thought brother Banks is telling me them things but when it really brought him right out and told him what he done the night before that was that was too much for him he couldn't get it then the next morning while we fished all night with little fish was was catching some for bait but he just stole that little fish in the water quivered flowed or about a half hour later we were sitting there I was I said brother L you let the fish swallow the hook all the way down in his stomach see I said take the fly line here flip it over the bait out like that as soon as he touched it I said then just hold him and then bring him in I said he don't pull him out like that don't swall it you catch the fish he said well he had a great big old line hang or says this the way we do it like that so just about that time I heard something coming off top of the mountain up there a horor wind whirling around and around here it come down like that the spirit of God come over the boat so stand up on your feet said speak to that dead fish said I'll give you back your life that little fish been Ling there for a half hour with his inals in his mouth and his guills I said little fishy Jesus Christ gives you back your life live in the name of Jesus Christ flipped over on his back and down through the water he went as hard as he could go brother L are you here somewhere I I seen you last night where there inside outside or where is that raise your hand if I can see what say oh yes way up in the balcony Through the Windows back there that's the man a Jehovah Witness he said brother Bram he all excited he said uh it's h it's good to be here isn't he said uh do you think that meant me that that that that I call that little fish said you shot your last wi said that that that meant something for me I said no no just a confirmation all upset about it well we travel along and you see those things happening knowing I just think what was it to show I had a many little child on my prayer list praying for it but when the vision come it was for a little old fish about so long about two inches long three look like the hook as big as a fish but what it was was to show you that God looks on the little things too one day when lepers land all over the country he used his power and put a curse on a tree and begin to wither when there was people laying everywhere needing that healing power but you see he wanted to show he's God over everything whether it's small whether it's big whatever it is he's still God over all things all the creation so we love him because that that gives us to know if he's interested to speak the word of life life into a little insignificant fish laying there dead on the water for a half hour he can certainly someday Speak Life to his children no matter if your body being more than a spoonful of dust he'll speak and we'll answer him someday he's God who's interested in everything all that we do all that we say everything he interested let us bow our heads everywhere I wonder now before we pray if there's anybody tonight that's interested in him but yet you haven't got your reservations yet for the other land where we're going to see him you know you can't come in without reservations and you haven't made them yet but you would like to be remembered in prayer now that everything will be made right between you and God tonight would you just raise up your hand just say Remember Me Lord You're just let him see your hand God granted heavenly father as we stand tonight between the living and the dead these things that's happening in these days mysterious sure they're mysterious but God you know whether they are true or not you are the solemn judge of the heavens and earth and we say this Lord just to encourage the people some of the things that thou has showed us that they might be encourag to love you and believe you serve you and to know that no matter how little the deed is good or bad you see it I pray dear God that you'll bless every one of those hands tonight and the Soul and Spirit that motivated that hand to go up I pray God that this will be the night that their reservations will be made for that land beyond the river granted heal the sick and The Afflicted Lord both here all out across the land where the the the broadcast through the phones are coming in bless those out there there that's unsaved all the way from California to New York from Canada to Mexico Grant Lord that every person under the sound of our voice tonight will be saved from their sins healed all their sickness because of your divine presence and this our brother Jackson who's flowing all the way down this Thousand Miles here to be here because something strangely stirred his heart and they shall dream dreams and see Visions dear God thou has kept it a secret for me what this means I don't know but if you shall visit us Lord prepare our hearts now for that visit we might be under expectations not knowing what you will do and not knowing if you have promised to visit us by this dream we do not know but we are just quoting those things that we do understand that you promis to visit your people and we pray that you'll make yourself real to us here in the name of Jesus Christ we ask that amen now tonight after keeping you so long last night in this morning and I kind of getting a little bit horse got a little piece of hair I got a whar in my bald spot here while I'm preaching but I forgot it this time and this air sweeping through these windows has begin to give me a a little bit of horseness I used to I'd have to close meetings but since I got that then I don't bother with it no more just go on and uh I forgot it and it's um kind of

Job the 42nd verse or 42nd chapter and the first six verses of the 42nd chapter of Joel very strange brother Ted Dudley if you're listening in tonight over in Phoenix you remember you and I talking one time about a week or two ago and we referred to this I told you someday that would become a text to me and I want to use it tonight then answered then job answered the Lord and said listen close to this reading now I know that thou can do everything and that no doubt can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not here I beseech thee and I will speak I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee wherefore I aror myself and repent and Dustin ashes now I want to take a text from that fifth verse I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now my ey seeth thee may the Lord bless his word job let's take a little of his life job was a prophet he was a man that lived back before the Bible was written it's been thought that job was one of the oldest books of the Bible because it was written before Genesis was written job this great warrior and Prophet was a a mighty man in his day no doubt that he had been brought up and had served the Lord all of his life and to live such a gallant life to the people all had respects for him but he' come to a place to where he calls it you're being tempted of the Lord but I'd like to use the word being tested by the Lord and truly every son that cometh to God must first be tested tried child trained and then if if the testing gets hard and we think it's too hard and won't listen take heed then he said we become uh illegitimate child and not a child of God because there's nothing can move a real Born Again child of God away from his parents he's part of it you can no more denight you can deny yourself see you've had the experience you've been trained and tested and now this man being a prophet he had had access to God's grace but job didn't have a bible to read he the Bible wasn't wrote then but he had access to God by Revelation and by Vision that's before the Bible was written now we find out take some of his life when God blessed him and made him a great man while even everybody respected him even to his wisdom had become so great is inspiration from God had Vindicated him to be God's servant so plainly until the people come from everywhere to hear him and then Satan begin to accuse that man and that's the what he does ever inspired servant of God Satan is always there to accuse him of everything that he does that's not right now we find out uh his life and trials and his great faith even Jesus when he came on the earth he uh referred to the patience of Job he said have you not read of the patience of Job Faith Waits with patience for the promise word to be fulfilled now we notice here that job after he went through his trials all of his afflictions he had a lovely family they were taken from him he had good health it was taken from him everything that he owned in this life was taken and he set on a as sheep with a piece of Croc scraping his bars and even to his own wife spoke against him she said uh why not curse God and die he said thou speakest like a foolish woman he said the lord gave and the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord now Satan had come up before God because he could come before God and accuse the Christians or the Believers all the time so he accused job of many things and said it's job the reason he could serve God because everything was coming good for him but said if you'll just let me have him in my hands I'll make him curse you to your face face I want you to notice that the confidence that God had in a Believer see he's in other words God said to Job or said to Satan like this you can't do it he's a just man Justified he is a good man he there's not one like him in the whole earth oh what a man and God himself would say to his enemy my servant is so perfect there's not another man on earth like him oh if we could only be that kind of a man God could bestow that confidence upon us that no that will not Twist from his word or his being anyway stay exactly and he can put his trust in us now job was a man that carried out God's Commandments to the letter exactly and Satan knew that but he said if you just let me have him I'll make him curse you to your face so God told him he said now he's in your hands but don't you take his life and Satan even stretched as far as he could on that he took every friend and everything he had almost his complete life but he couldn't take his life but job still help right on there was no no turning back you see when a man or a person has once really come in contact with god with that genuine reveal faith that God is there's nothing no time nowhere can ever separate that man from his God I believe as Paul said there's no Strife no hunger no Peril NE neither living creatures or death or anything that can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus you are securely anchored in him because you were ordained to that life but Satan thought he could twist him around a little bit and cuff him up and make him do it but you see job with his perfect revelation of God and who God was and how God loved him he waited no matter what the circumstances was he waited for his faith to be confirmed because it had a grip on God a revelation that I spoke of last night now when the sick people that's in the building the crippled people or you that have a need of God when you can get that type of a revelation that you are Justified when you are actually Justified and asking the thing that you're asking for and believe that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him there's nothing can ever separate you from that Faith that's anchored to you but first it has to be revealed to you someone come not long ago a group of man some of them listening in tonight and told me said I kept telling him go to Kentucky orals down there I knew it was I seen it in the vision well brother Deus them didn't go for a long time after a while finally they said after Texas had moved in and they said uh now we're going down I said you ought to went a long time ago but they didn't do it demon said I made a great mistake in that we're not doing that brother Bram I said if you'd went down there You' have had it all well they wouldn't listen to it then the first then before we left that night the the place where we're having lunch the the Holy Spirit showed me a great uh crack in the earth and in that was full of oil and these overflows in Kentucky was just little beds of O that they were pumping from but this one come from the mainstream and I said brother Deus it's there so they went to searching for said go down and tell us where the word where the rool is I said oh no no see we don't use a gift of God for commercial no no he could tell many work was that but I don't have any need of it I wouldn't have faith enough to ask him see if I had a need of it I believe i' ask him you tell me but first you see your motives and objectives has to be right you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God lord see if you want to be well what do you want to be well for if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get healed there's got to be You' got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of God and then when the faith is revealed to you and God by Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over now see now to make that word true when the Brethren got down there they got one fellow went over and bought a bunch of stuff and so Le and cheated the other one this way I said you see it won't work now is to make the prophecy sure within a 100 yards of where these men were digging their well some men struck the big gusher and it's there 1100 barrels or in a half a day or something like it still putting it out right in that mainstream but just to make the prophecy the word that had been said that it was there it was there the rest of them nearly is all dried up everywhere through Kentucky little ponds they pump them a little while they go it's only the Overflow from this see but because of the selfishness got among it the objectives was wrong signing up a bunch of stuff that would be this way when they promised they would do it for the kingdom of God but look like it's for themselves and it won't work no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith as if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence see we've got to have confidence I want this to the honor and glory of God then faith has a a channel to move into if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith and not genuine Faith from God that intellectual faith will get you nowhere might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing that you're looking for so job checking himself with the genuine faith that God had give to him that he was just that he had done everything that God required him to do now when we're going to be prayed for for our sickness I wonder if we have done everything that God requires us to do have we followed every iot of the scripture have we give him our hearts and lives to service what's the reason you want to be healed that's the reason you can't get Faith enough see because you have haven't maybe made this thing to God sincerely from your heart like Hezekiah did give God the reason he want to set his kingdom in order and God sent his Prophet back told him and he'd be healed see but you have to have those things made right first so then as soon as you get to these places and know that's been revealed to you by the word of God by the Revelation by the word that God requires you to do then you have faith genuine Faith now just like Abraham when he was uh 99 years old I believe Genesis 17 God appeared to this old man now 9 and9 years old when he was almost 100 years old that had been waiting upon that promise all these years he appeared to him in the name of el Sharad the breasted one and what an encouragement it was yet the promise wasn't fulfill then but Abraham I am the almighty God elsh the strength Giver the breasted God like I've told you before like the little baby that's threatening sick and crying and it lays upon its mother's breast and nurses its strength back from her because it's satisfied while it's a nursing because the only ACC say it has and knows of is a mother's breast it knows no dose of medicine you might give him a dose Med squeal and cry give him a shot in the arm and he carry on but the only access to satisfy him is a mother's breast and he said Abraham you're old your strength is gone your arms are withered up your manhood is gone but I am your mother just take a hold of my promise and be satisfied while you're waiting be arrested now that's way every believer no matter how bad the Cancer's got you how long you've been sitting in a wheelchair any of those things just if you can grasp that Revelation from God then be satisfied knowing that it's going to happen because Faith Waits patiently for the promise job knew that he was right when we find out here in the scriptures that there was these fellows come to him his church members everything that once seemed dear to him had turned against him and tried to accuse him of being a secret sinner because all these things that happened to him you hear people y today say I told you look at him you see what that ain't alltogether the truth sometimes it's God testing his people in this case it was God testing job the best man there was on Earth at the time now he was holding him there because that he knew Job was a prophet that had a vision from God that he had exactly done what God told him to do and he God was Duty bound to keep his promise to him all all Christians has got to be that when the last struggle of our life comes and death rattles are in her throat we still must hold study and remember that God said I'll raise you up again at the last day got to hold that that our testimony our place in Christ our position what we are knowing that we have kept every word of his commandment blessed are they that do his Commandments that they might have the right to enter in see and when we know that no matter what anyone has said we've kept every Commandment that we see in the Bible that God has done us told us to do with reverence and love and respect to the Creator who wrote the Bible we say man wrote it man of old moved by the Holy Ghost wrote it God wrote it through man like a prophet speaks his word it's not the prophet's word it's God's word see through the prophet that's the reason it has to to come to pass if it's truly the truth now we see this great man and remember job had no bible to read in his day no he only went by inspiration he was a prophet to whom the word of the Lord comes to he had he had only to be inspired because he know his position that he was God's Prophet now the only thing had to happen was for the in insiration to strike him and then he know what he said would happen because it was by inspiration that's what the church if it's an order set in order it only it's got the mechanics ready it only needs in the Dynamics tonight if we'll get the mechanics ready get our hearts right the things that we can do follow every word follow him in baptism follow him in every order that he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand there then we're ready for the Dynamics to be lit off and only God can do that and that's to drop into your heart that faith that says I am now healed that don't make any difference what circumstances is you're healed anyhow C his faith by faith you're healed he had a Channel of communication to God that he got by inspiration he had a way of moving himself out and letting God move in and he know he was was justified it was a gift it was a gift for the people not for job but for the people that's what all Divine gifts are to serve God's people with everybody's not ordered to be a prophet all's not ordered to be pray for the sick all of them is not ordered to be pastors and so forth but it's a channel that God is open to them and he is we had this morning in the lesson that he one man has no business deviating in next man's Channel no matter how inspired how much it seems how well how many is at the meeting this morning let's see your hand see see you cannot there's David just as inspired as he could be all the people shouting and glorifying God for a reason that seemed exactly scripture but he was a wrong person that inspiration should have come to Nathan not David he never even consulted Nathan you see what happened we have God said he does nothing until he reveals it to his servants the prophets and job was this prophet in this day now only thing God had done to job had always give him wisdom and his word and inspiration he could get no inspiration but he know all of his mechanics he had offered the burnt offering he had done everything he know to he was right but he couldn't get a word from God but the devil couldn't move him there you are now there you are when you're prayed for you don't have to run back to a line or go let somebody else pray for you when you know you've done exactly what God told you to do see then wait for that channel of inspiration to open up to you now I'm Healed when it drops in there then it's all over oh you don't need no prayer lines nothing else it's over it's been revealed to you just like the old Prophet at the coming of the Lord Jesus we find out it was revealed to him the old sage that he would not see death until he seen the Lord's Christ and he believed that and he waited for it and the people thought he was crazy the old man had lost his mind but he still believed it nothing could Shak him from it he know God had revealed it to him where the Bible said it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost some you coming into the temple that minut walked over and give praise to God and said let thy servant depart in peace when he picked up the baby mine eyes have seen thy salvation he know he was going to see it no matter how many babies he visited each day he knew God had revealed to him that he was going to see the Christ before he died Simon believe that now when it's reveal to you that you yourself has received God's promise the inspiration you being Christians it struck you you don't even need a prayer line the thing only thing you need is a open heart when all the mechanics are ready and let the inspiration drop in and then nothing can change your mind you've got it outside of that it won't do no good now notice job needed a Channel of inspiration he had it open he had a channel to communicate with God by his inspiration he had a way of moving himself out and let the word of God move in notice how they how they come to consult him from the East and from the West people looking for him because they know that what job said was the truth they know that man told the truth because what he prophesied that's what happened and so people come from the East and West he said he go to the market the young princes from the East would bow before him just to hear one word of consolation from him Great Mighty wisdom because they know the man was honest he didn't want to boast up himself he had no access to grind no strings to pull he's just an honest Prophet before God Amen and they had confidence in him amen and everybody come from east and west just to speak to him in a moment he spoke of in the Bible here but you see he like inspiration to tell him what all this was about God let it happen didn't tell him then one day we find out that in that that's a time that everybody as long as you can help them all right but when they want to disagree with you that's when trouble comes in but he alone knew he was right his pulsation of faith of hearing God words speak to him he knew it was the truth yes sir he knew God's voice nobody can fool him on it before he knew it it but whenever you something's revealed to you maybe contrary to what the people think I'm speaking a line of prophets once God reveals something which if there ever is a secret comes out from God to be made known to the people it will never come through a seminary it will never come through a group of people it never did it always will happen has and will through one individual a prophet Amos 3:7 see the Lord does nothing except first he reveals it through His prophets amen and now job had something wrong with him but he couldn't get the inspiration on him and he was wearing him and that when you get in that kind of fix that's when the enemy moves in to every friend near to you God they begin to accuse him oh it must have been a miserable thing for him and know his friends that accused him Satan then goes and joins himself with the Enemy that's when Satan comes in let me have him and I'll make him curse you to I'll make him deny his message I'll make him curse you I'll make him go back and say it was all wrong then he tried him with everything he could to all the great man and the friends that he used to have but job stood flat footed for he knew he had heard God's voice oh God help tomorrow night I get that wings of the D I heard the voice of God that said something and it's going to happen that way just the same as these other things has happened it's going to happen now job knew it was going to happened and he know that God had told him that that he was just but they made him a sinner so he waited then for the inspiration Satan getting all the the people and he come around his comforters so-called and accus him but he didn't move him a bit but when the word of God became Vindicated to him he had heard of God by the hearing of the ear but one day setting out at his lowest point and while he was sitting there and everyone accusing him even his wife telling him he was wrong he's scraping his boils and elu came down and rebuked him for being selfish about the way he was accusing God and so forth and then at that time it was when inspiration struck him that's when the lightning begin to flash the Thunders begin to Roar that's when the inspiration struck the prophet and he raised up and he said I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand upon this Earth though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself he saw he been talking about the trees the botney life hi dies and lives again water brings it back again the smell of water the scent of water the results of water pouring upon a tree or something or seed that went under the ground he said but a man layeth down he giveth up the ghost his children come to honor him he perceiveth not oh thou hide me in the grave Job 14 till thy wrath be passed he said but if a man dies shall he live again all the appointed times of my life I'll wait till my change comes thou will call me and I'll answer th appoint me bounds that I cannot pass so forth he know all these things he watched a tree live but what happened to a man when he died he didn't raise up again so God was showing this Redeemer he wanted to see if there was somebody who could intercede for him he had interceded for so many people but now is there somebody can speak for him could there somebody put his hand on job or on a sinful man and a holy God and make Bridge the way could he go to his house and knock at the door would he open the door and talk to him a while but then when the inspiration dropped into his heart then he could see God the Lightnings are flashing the Thunders are roaring and when it did he stood up on his feet and he said I know my redeemer liveth My Redeemer in the last days he'll stand on the earth see he had be to see God's reaction to his faith now we wonder if we could see God Is there a way that we could see him now it was only way God had trying job out he said I have heard of thee with the hearing of the ear but now I see thee but now I see thee with my eyes the vision of the invisible had been made plain he seen the cloud rolling around you heard the flashing of the lightning or saw it and seen the rolling of the Thunder maybe on a clear day and he seen God was in that cloud and in that lightning he could see God with his natural ey see because the invisible was made visible the visible vision of others was then Vindicated clear to the Natural Eye just like Faith with works as we spoke on last night Abraham no had no bible to read either but he was a prophet his vision and his faith and it seemed wrong to others that he should think that way that he should think there going to have a baby but they did have the baby because his vision of the baby was what he was talking about I'm going to have it I'm going to have it but when the baby was born then the other people could see with the eye what he saw in a vision and when you go to acting upon what you believe in your heart then the people know God and know what's happening to you but the way you act that's how you see God with the eye but to him all he had done that was good all that he had done for others he needed somebody to intercede for him when the birth of the baby come Isaac the um the inspiration that had led him to this had Vindicated his vision to where the people could see that what he had saw in a vision was actually the truth now sometimes these great pulsations of Faith come right in the time of Crisis it's usually crisis that drives us into this it was a crisis that drove job into us Glory why is that the end of his life his children was dead his camels and all of his Goods was gone and destroyed and his own life it broke out from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet with boils it was a crisis that he pressed himself there's where the inspiration struck you oh man and women tonight if you could look around and see how close we are to the coming of the Lord you who put off the baptism of the Holy Ghost you you may be relied upon some sensation or something that you've done that Satan can't impersonate and can't have the real spirit in you to go all the way in God's promises how can a man that claims to have the Holy Ghost deny one word of this Bible being not R you can't do it no matter how religious you are how many churches you belong to how many books your names on if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is this word man ested you'll see the message of the hour because it's the holy ghost that does it but there has to be something light that off inspiration strike you and if there's if you pour water on the ground on the ground on the ground and there's no seed in there to strike it how can it ever bring forth anything there's nothing there to bring forth that is that only the elected of God will see it the elected of God seen it Noah's time Moses time Jesus time the apostles time l Luther's time Wesley's time Pentecostal time because that was a seed that was on the earth when this inspiration was poured out now all the inspiration poured out together the bride together it's only those who are elected will see it Jesus said I thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it to Bab such as learn now inspiration has to strike it now when the inspiration struck him that did it he had it then now we find out it comes a time of these crisis when the Press is right on and you look around today look at the condition we're living in aren't we living in a modern Sodom and Gomorrah hasn't the world come back that was a gentile world that was destroyed then by fire didn't Jesus say in St Luke the 17th chapter the 28th 29th and 30th verse that as it was was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed what is a revealed is a secret made known a revelation is to reveal or make known a secret now these things that's been hid all through the church ages is now being revealed made known now we can say that and if God didn't back that up that's wrong see God don't need anybody to interpret his word he's his own interpreter he said a virgin shall conceive and she did he said let there be light and there was and we are not living in Luther's age Wesley age or the Pentecostal age the Pentecostal age is only a restoration of the gifts coming back to the church but we're living in the evening time we're living in the time of the calling out of the Bride just as it was hard for the Catholics to see Luther and the Lutheran to see the Wesley and the Pentecost West is to see the Pentecostal age so is it hard for the Pentecostals to see this age it's always been that way because it's poured out upon an elected seedall and not only what the Bible teaches they can't see it Jesus even prayed for them said there's blind in didn't know it Revelations tells us in this lady of see Church age when he was put out of the church that they're naked poor miserable blind and don't know it back again they can't see it can't understand it they're so creeped up in Traditions but remember the promised word of God by the mouth of Jesus Christ the very God that spoke creation into existence he was the one before the foundation to the world that spoke the words of Let There Be and there was or he said he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not but as many as did know him to them he gave the power to become the sons of God the very Creator and the Very Creator himself when he raised up Lazarus from the dead he said think this not strange for the hour is coming that when all that's in the grave will hear the voice of the son of man and shall come out the very God that said let there be light said the voice of the son of man would wake those that are in the grave it has to happen in its season amen he spoke Let There Be male and female and so forth and all this years and hundreds of years before it happened the inspiration hit the prophet Isaiah he said unto us a child is born a son is given his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father years pass months years days weeks years Roll by hundreds of years Roll by 800 years later Emmanuel was born by a virgin why is because it was spoke by the lips of God's anointed Prophet a seed went forth see that great hour said will you seek ask me of a Vision or sign he said I'll give him a sign an everlasting sign the Virgin shall conceive an everlasting sign now we find in those hours of real stress that's usually when the spirit of God moves in you let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace before he ever moved a hand but when he moved he moves now we notice here that in Luke the the 17th chapter and the 30th verse that he said in the last days that the son of man would reveal himself as he did just before Sodom and Gomorrah and the same conditions would exist you told about Moses about and I beg your pardon not about Moses uh but about Noah how that the people was eating drinking and so forth married and giving a marriage then he come around he said now as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the time when the son of man is being revealed now watch the son of man was revealed to Abraham's group as a man a prophet in a form of human flesh a ordinary man with dust on his clothes and Abraham called called him Elohim now Jesus promises here that in the last days the son of man will be revealed again to that same type of group The Royal Seed of Abraham just before the farf Falls remember the church never received any more witness Abraham and then then the promised son that they were looking for was brought right away after that and the church is looking for the promised son he will come right after the days of this ministry to be revealed from the heavens now we see it too plain it's got to be now the only thing there has to be is something pulsates gets into a man God vindicate and tells him and shows him that that is a thing to happen and you you're go to like MO [Applause] hallelujah praise the Lord Glory I my what a word we can do a little bit better than that praise the Lord
