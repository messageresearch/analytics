[51:52] yeah
[52:12] [Laughter]
[52:23] yeah
[52:26] amen
[52:29] amen may God bless you
[52:32] amen we'll give you the information on
[52:34] the funeral and so forth at the end
[52:38] some of the men to
[52:40] just say a few words and what
[52:42] what he meant
[52:50] amen God bless you all this evening
[52:55] you know they always say
[52:57] what do you what do you say about a man
[52:59] like brother Tomas Peres
[53:03] but you know I never I never ran out of
[53:07] things to say about him
[53:11] like our Pastor said
[53:14] he is the greatest man I've ever known
[53:18] I think to quote my uncle Tommy he's the
[53:20] greatest man ever put on boots
[53:27] do you ever wear pants or socks
[53:33] he is the greatest man I've ever known
[53:37] and you know
[53:39] he had he had four boys
[53:43] but in reality he had a whole lot more
[53:47] because he adopted me
[53:51] he was my dad
[53:54] he was my lawyer
[53:55] he was one of my best friends Amigos
[54:00] he meant the world to me yes
[54:04] and I I I can't think of a time in my
[54:08] life
[54:10] where he wasn't there
[54:14] I look back as far as I can think uh Ben
[54:18] biens
[54:21] and I just see the chief
[54:25] he was he was our leader he's our leader
[54:31] and and and I I just I thank the Lord
[54:36] I'm so grateful to God
[54:40] because everything that he taught us
[54:44] all those years that we sat under him
[54:49] was for this momentum
[54:53] it was for the moment that he wouldn't
[54:55] be here anymore
[54:58] and it was so that the work that he
[55:00] started
[55:03] will continue
[55:06] and I I thought about what scripture
[55:08] that would that would work in in in this
[55:11] situation
[55:15] is
[55:20] Luke 24 32 Lucas
[55:25] did not our hearts burn within us
[55:30] as he talked with us along the way
[55:34] you know we we have we can share a lot
[55:37] of stories and things
[55:40] that that you know what happened in the
[55:42] mission field and so on yeah
[55:47] but to me
[55:48] the most valuable time I ever had with
[55:51] him
[55:55] was was after the preaching was over
[56:01] the big meetings would dismiss this was
[56:05] and we'd all go down just a group of
[56:09] menones and he would relax
[56:13] and he'd just start to talk
[56:17] and it reminded me of when Jesus would
[56:19] talk to the disciples
[56:23] because the words and the things that he
[56:26] would say
[56:28] they were so profound
[56:31] profundas he was so far ahead of all of
[56:34] us
[56:36] that a lot of times I think we struggle
[56:38] to keep up yeah this is
[56:42] but he was just such an incredible man
[56:46] I'm sorry is
[56:53] and he touched
[56:55] all of our lives in in not just one way
[57:02] I think that's what made him so
[57:04] incredible yes
[57:07] was that no matter where you were at in
[57:10] your life what you were going through
[57:14] he was the high priest
[57:18] he was the one that became God in flesh
[57:24] and you just knew
[57:26] that if you could get to the chief yes
[57:30] no matter what it was in life
[57:34] didn't matter the challenge or the
[57:37] problem
[57:38] if you could get the chief just
[57:42] that it would be all right
[57:46] I just want to say I love him
[57:49] and he meant the world to me significa
[57:56] [Applause]
[58:14] is
[58:18] I want to read a scripture
[58:22] but before I do as we read this
[58:25] scripture
[58:27] I want you to realize that the person
[58:29] that's important to me is the man that
[58:32] represents Paul the person
[58:37] as we heard from our pastor
[58:41] it was our pastor our friend
[58:46] and Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:48] Apostles
[58:50] and as I was thinking
[58:54] in scripture came to me is
[58:58] second Corinthians chapter 3
[59:03] verses one through three
[59:09] do we begin to commend ourselves or need
[59:12] we as some others
[59:15] the Epistles of commendation for you are
[59:18] letters of commendation from me
[59:21] recommendations
[59:35] this is me brother Tommy speaking to me
[59:38] ER
[59:43] our epistle
[59:49] escritas in our hearts nuestros
[59:52] corazones
[59:54] known and read about
[59:58] Los Hombres
[1:00:00] Juarez we are manifestly declared to be
[1:00:04] the Epistle of Christ
[1:00:05] o
[1:00:09] ministered by us
[1:00:11] otrus
[1:00:16] written not with ink is
[1:00:19] but with the spirit of the Living God
[1:00:24] not in tables of stone
[1:00:28] but in fleshly tables
[1:00:35] my personal testimony with testimonial
[1:00:38] personal just want to mention one little
[1:00:41] part of it to you
[1:00:43] um
[1:00:46] very crucial time in my life
[1:00:51] I was in a message church in El Paso
[1:00:54] Texas
[1:01:01] so nobody get any thoughts I mean this
[1:01:05] was way brother Adolfo was in Fort Worth
[1:01:08] Texas somewhere it was almost seven Fort
[1:01:10] Worth Texas
[1:01:12] and my wife and I went through some
[1:01:14] trials
[1:01:19] the enemy came in to try to destroy the
[1:01:21] church
[1:01:26] and I remember men like brother Fabio
[1:01:30] Romano Fabio
[1:01:32] brother Tommy no Tommy
[1:01:35] in November after the meetings in
[1:01:38] Phoenix
[1:01:40] in Phoenix
[1:01:42] they would come and minister to us
[1:01:47] many many memories
[1:01:52] but on our personal note not that
[1:01:56] personal it came to a time in my life
[1:01:58] where I had to make a decision
[1:02:04] or I could see that our spiritual life
[1:02:07] might die spiritually
[1:02:15] and I remember
[1:02:17] my wife being pregnant with Lydia is
[1:02:25] every Sunday or seven months
[1:02:32] 5 30 in the morning
[1:02:35] to go to services in Silver City
[1:02:38] at Silver City
[1:02:42] when I came to that crucial time to make
[1:02:44] that decision
[1:02:48] not knowing what would happen
[1:02:52] not knowing whether he would even accept
[1:02:54] me in Silver City
[1:02:57] in Silver City or accept me you know
[1:03:02] and so I had this conversation with him
[1:03:07] one Sunday after service
[1:03:11] we went to his house to eat
[1:03:15] and then we got in his band and we rode
[1:03:19] in the neighborhood
[1:03:21] result
[1:03:29] it's a church so he parked because
[1:03:32] you know
[1:03:34] and he looked at me straight in the eyes
[1:03:38] and I said I
[1:03:43] I would like to be under your ministry
[1:03:46] ministerio
[1:03:51] I made this decision that we we need to
[1:03:54] to move he is
[1:03:56] [Music]
[1:04:00] but I don't know what you think about it
[1:04:02] respect
[1:04:07] he didn't say nothing
[1:04:10] can I just look
[1:04:11] let's implement the middle
[1:04:14] and looked at me
[1:04:18] and he said I don't want you here
[1:04:22] I'll never forget that is
[1:04:28] I said well maybe I better be quiet
[1:04:32] and
[1:04:35] you should try he's doing this
[1:04:40] because
[1:04:43] Iglesia
[1:04:54] but I don't Prosper like Noah I don't
[1:04:56] know
[1:04:58] number two
[1:05:01] you identify yourself with me the
[1:05:03] identification and what God has given me
[1:05:06] the ministry that God has given me the
[1:05:08] administered he goes all hell will break
[1:05:12] loose
[1:05:15] he said you think I want that for you
[1:05:21] he's very direct muy director
[1:05:24] something that I I always loved about
[1:05:26] him he would just tell me the way it is
[1:05:32] but
[1:05:36] if it's a revelation of God to you soon
[1:05:43] welcome to Soccer City
[1:05:45] and I'll never forget that
[1:05:49] then I knew that I would be written in
[1:05:52] his heart
[1:05:55] and as I finish I can say from that time
[1:05:58] on he
[1:06:01] never treated me any different than even
[1:06:04] his own son yes
[1:06:08] he treated me this like what I was one
[1:06:10] of his
[1:06:13] and that's why this scripture means a
[1:06:16] lot to me is
[1:06:23] [Music]
[1:06:26] nobody was going to take us out of it
[1:06:30] we're so thankful
[1:06:35] to speak a few words there so much that
[1:06:37] could be said
[1:06:44] [Applause]
[1:06:54] laughs
[1:07:02] man God bless you
[1:07:05] love them
[1:07:08] amen I think one thing that you're gonna
[1:07:10] find in common tonight
[1:07:13] is everyone that comes up here
[1:07:18] is going to tell you how close they were
[1:07:21] to him
[1:07:25] he always made us feel
[1:07:29] very special
[1:07:32] each one of these men sombres
[1:07:36] he gave them their value there's the old
[1:07:39] uh
[1:07:40] we could tell many stories
[1:07:43] you know I remember one time we were
[1:07:45] here I was here with brother Caleb
[1:07:47] recording
[1:07:49] and brother Tommy had came into town
[1:07:54] and he was so excited
[1:07:57] and he was telling us about the message
[1:07:59] that you have preached on Mount
[1:08:01] Transfiguration
[1:08:06] and it was he's like that
[1:08:10] that to him
[1:08:11] brother Danny was the greatest man we
[1:08:15] don't choose
[1:08:18] he gave us our value
[1:08:21] I remember one of the greatest memories
[1:08:24] I have another this Memorial
[1:08:26] I was a young Minister I think it was
[1:08:28] 1999
[1:08:32] and we're we're in Peru estamos in Peru
[1:08:36] and we're all lined up behind the pulpit
[1:08:41] in time for the minister to come up
[1:08:45] and he looks down the line
[1:08:49] it looks the other way
[1:08:53] attention
[1:08:56] you know we don't have time to get ready
[1:09:00] I got behind the pulpit
[1:09:03] and I started preaching I was nervous
[1:09:08] you know and I was I I was going to town
[1:09:11] yes
[1:09:13] and all of a sudden it repented I hear
[1:09:16] someone yelling behind me
[1:09:18] and he said hit him with the Roar of the
[1:09:22] lion he said that is
[1:09:25] and talking about the power of God
[1:09:28] falling
[1:09:30] you know that's the value he gave us
[1:09:33] but to give you a vision of that story
[1:09:38] that message that I preach is
[1:09:41] you know a young man had got this tape
[1:09:45] and and he said that he gave that's all
[1:09:49] he had for a year he was in the jungle
[1:09:54] two years he was in the jungle
[1:09:57] and that's the only thing he had to
[1:09:59] sustain himself
[1:10:01] all because he gave us our value
[1:10:05] he was so proud of us
[1:10:10] no I remember when I went into the
[1:10:12] Marine Corps
[1:10:14] I still go back and I look back and I
[1:10:17] wonder is
[1:10:19] because he was so proud of me
[1:10:23] you know when I would come back home
[1:10:26] he would take me to his office
[1:10:30] and it was my picture
[1:10:33] that was in his office
[1:10:35] because we had a special connection
[1:10:39] you know when I was in sin
[1:10:43] he would write me one letter
[1:10:47] every month
[1:10:49] and that's what keep me keep me alive
[1:10:56] but today we stand
[1:10:59] as men
[1:11:01] and a saints of God
[1:11:04] you know we're we're not no little boys
[1:11:07] anymore
[1:11:08] but he showed us how to be men of God
[1:11:12] he showed us how to fight
[1:11:15] he showed us how to love God's peoples
[1:11:19] and that's why we're able to stand today
[1:11:24] because that very seed that he planted
[1:11:27] inside of us
[1:11:29] it's already produced life
[1:11:32] and it's my privilege yes you call my
[1:11:36] pastor yeah Pastor you call my friend
[1:11:40] you know I tell this to the guys all the
[1:11:43] time

[1:11:52] here
[1:11:54] he was always our pastor
[1:11:56] always our friend Mr Amigo and today we
[1:12:00] could stand
[1:12:02] and the Very life that we have today

[1:12:47] this uh very familiar uh Bible scripture

[1:12:55] Psalms chapter 23 verse 1 Salomon
[1:13:00] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want

[1:13:23] for his name's sake
[1:13:33] amen amen what a
[1:13:35] what a Shepherd we had amen
[1:13:37] and I'm not going to say we had because
[1:13:40] we still have a an incredible Shepherd
[1:13:42] amen you know
[1:13:46] one thing we could all say a bunch of
[1:13:49] things about brother Tommy
[1:13:52] Tomas well one of the things that always
[1:13:54] stood out to me
[1:13:58] was how balanced brother Tommy was
[1:14:02] he knew when to be a certain way at a
[1:14:06] certain time
[1:14:09] he knew not to be he wasn't too
[1:14:12] religious
[1:14:15] he would stick with the word of God
[1:14:18] he would he was a jokester sometimes
[1:14:23] he knew how to get he knew how to get he
[1:14:26] knew how to be at your level to to get
[1:14:28] to you
[1:14:31] I I one of the things that that stood
[1:14:34] out to me it's kind of funny but
[1:14:38] I remember I had broke my hand once he
[1:14:52] my hand was all wrapped in a in a cast
[1:14:55] uh
[1:15:06] you know I was like and if he if he sees
[1:15:09] this and and he finds out that I punched
[1:15:12] a telephone pole is
[1:15:19] I was young and I didn't know how to
[1:15:21] handle some problems okay
[1:15:26] but anyway he um
[1:15:29] here I ran into him in the hotel room in
[1:15:31] the hallway
[1:15:33] and I said oh my Lord
[1:15:37] he's gonna get me in his room and he's
[1:15:39] gonna get the scriptures
[1:15:44] he's just gonna Hammer me with it
[1:15:49] and I was like all right I'm going to be
[1:15:52] ready for it because I deserve it
[1:15:55] but he did the complete opposite
[1:15:59] he said uh
[1:16:02] we're walking one way together
[1:16:08] we're walking like this and he says hey
[1:16:10] let me let me see your let me see your
[1:16:11] arm your hand
[1:16:13] and I went like
[1:16:32] so you know he gets my hand and he's
[1:16:35] like what happened
[1:16:38] and by then I'm like oh man I know
[1:16:41] brother Caleb told him say oh yeah
[1:16:45] so I'm like um
[1:16:48] uh
[1:17:18] he uh I gotta tell one more just just
[1:17:21] real quick but I remember one time he
[1:17:24] was a jokester too right
[1:17:27] so uh I had bought a truck a real bright
[1:17:30] colored truck
[1:17:33] and I'm
[1:17:35] a pastor's already shaking his head so
[1:17:37] I'm not gonna look that way
[1:17:38] but uh where I go to his house you know
[1:17:41] and I'm all proud I'm gonna show brother
[1:17:43] Caleb yeah
[1:17:47] come over remember my dad's this is
[1:17:52] I go in the house and me and brother

[1:17:56] garage
[1:18:01] brother Tommy was still I don't know two
[1:18:03] minutes behind us or whatever getting
[1:18:05] ready
[1:18:07] and uh
[1:18:09] so we go out and I show Bill Caleb I'm
[1:18:12] proud you're right
[1:18:17] check it out Pastor oh mira mira Pastor
[1:18:20] he's like
[1:18:22] wow that's a nice truck
[1:18:29] and he said it like that yes
[1:18:35] do that oh no well in that time as he
[1:18:39] says
[1:18:40] so brother Tommy's come coming out right
[1:18:43] next to brother
[1:18:47] what a beautiful color it is
[1:18:53] hey tell them well brother Caleb said he
[1:18:57] don't like it
[1:18:59] to him he likes those boring colors
[1:19:05] that was the balance that he had yes
[1:19:08] he knew how to be at somebody's level
[1:19:14] and you know I remember one time going
[1:19:17] through a hard time going through a
[1:19:18] rough time
[1:19:19] and this was the kind of person that he
[1:19:22] was when he when he had to be
[1:19:26] and I had some problems that I was
[1:19:28] dealing with
[1:19:29] and uh
[1:19:31] uh
[1:19:32] I'm telling them a certain something
[1:19:36] and when uh some somebody had come into
[1:19:39] the room and said hey we need to do this
[1:19:41] at this time
[1:19:45] and he looked at what the most serious
[1:19:47] face
[1:19:50] he said cancel it one of my men needs
[1:19:54] help
[1:19:55] so we're not leaving here no no until we
[1:19:59] fix it
[1:20:00] and and that touched my heart is
[1:20:04] something that I'll never forget
[1:20:07] and just just in closing here I remember
[1:20:11] uh years ago
[1:20:14] if it's okay brother Caleb I had a uh
[1:20:17] years ago right before he got sick I had
[1:20:19] a small dream
[1:20:23] um
[1:20:24] I um I'm gonna say probably about seven
[1:20:27] to eight months before before he got
[1:20:29] sick
[1:20:32] um and I never I never said it because
[1:20:35] but today today just when they asked me
[1:20:39] to speak it came back to my my
[1:20:41] remembrance
[1:20:44] and I remember in this dream
[1:20:48] I saw brother Caleb and brother Tommy
[1:20:50] they were kind of hugging
[1:20:54] keep in mind this is seven to eight
[1:20:57] months before he got sick
[1:21:00] and uh I just heard brother Caleb say no
[1:21:05] and then I blink and then I got I was
[1:21:08] closer to them
[1:21:10] and I could hear what he was saying
[1:21:14] brother Tommy was telling him I have to
[1:21:16] go yeah
[1:21:19] I have to go and brother Caleb was
[1:21:22] holding him he was he was grabbing
[1:21:45] I still need you here
[1:21:49] and right when you got about halfway
[1:21:50] equals
[1:21:53] he got about halfway and um
[1:21:59] brother Caleb I'm sorry
[1:22:02] he looked at him and he looked to his
[1:22:04] left brother Caleb was on the left hand
[1:22:06] side
[1:22:10] now it's your turn to take care of
[1:22:13] church
[1:22:15] when he said that brother
[1:22:19] and brother Tommy kept on walking yeah
[1:22:22] he walked forward he never looked back
[1:22:55] it's time for the unfolding of that is
[1:23:03] [Applause]
[1:23:30] amen God bless you
[1:23:33] this evening
[1:23:42] yeah
[1:23:44] and my brother Tommy I believe I was
[1:23:47] about 16 or 17.
[1:23:53] you know and uh
[1:23:56] you know I I don't know if it's just
[1:24:00] yes
[1:24:02] I don't know if it's good or bad yes
[1:24:05] but there's times I see people and I
[1:24:08] investors not now okay don't not not any
[1:24:12] of you here no not in the aqui but I
[1:24:15] would say you know what I I don't care
[1:24:17] for that
[1:24:20] Persona you know and and the first time
[1:24:23] the first time I met brother Tommy La
[1:24:26] primeroes
[1:24:28] I felt a connection
[1:24:31] and and this is and myself I I was never
[1:24:36] I never knew the message
[1:24:38] or see me for me
[1:24:41] you could say I was Catholic
[1:24:43] but I never went to church
[1:24:47] but but I felt a connection
[1:24:51] and you know and getting to know him
[1:24:56] you know you know as a pastor of the
[1:24:58] church
[1:24:59] you know I I I've come across certain
[1:25:03] you know maybe before that certain
[1:25:05] certain uh
[1:25:06] I guess you could say they they would go
[1:25:08] to church
[1:25:12] you know but but what stood out to me
[1:25:14] was
[1:25:17] he never made me feel that he was above
[1:25:20] me
[1:25:22] um
[1:25:25] that he was better than me even though I
[1:25:29] was doing what what I was doing at that
[1:25:31] time
[1:25:34] he never looked down on me
[1:25:38] but he he came to my level
[1:25:41] and he made me and he made me feel I was
[1:25:44] just as good as he was
[1:25:48] you understand what I'm saying
[1:25:50] he never walked around with his nose up
[1:25:53] in the air yeah
[1:25:57] but he made me feel better
[1:26:00] that he was at my level and that's what
[1:26:04] drew me to him
[1:26:07] I guess I could say he didn't know me
[1:26:11] but I felt the love from him already
[1:26:15] because he was a loving man
[1:26:18] you know you the first time I went out
[1:26:21] on a missionary trip with him
[1:26:24] you hear you hear all these stories
[1:26:27] when you actually experience
[1:26:31] when you actually are out there and you
[1:26:33] experience
[1:26:35] then you know that God is real
[1:26:39] and out in the mission field yeah
[1:26:42] is where I saw the god in this man yes
[1:26:46] how much he would give
[1:26:49] what he would give for the people
[1:26:53] the love he had for the people
[1:26:57] not just in here
[1:27:00] but for the people out there
[1:27:03] the love El Amor and that's what I saw
[1:27:06] in this is
[1:27:08] because I was in lovable
[1:27:12] but he loved me Amo
[1:27:18] he gave his life for me
[1:27:21] he sacrificed for me
[1:27:25] he sacrificed for you and I
[1:27:28] that we could be here today
[1:27:32] and not stop the work
[1:27:35] but we can continue
[1:27:38] because what he left us
[1:27:42] we can go and run with it also tambien
[1:27:47] that was the man that I knew is
[1:27:50] that he would give you the shirt off his
[1:27:53] back
[1:27:54] you know I I remember one time I I had
[1:27:58] just gotten married
[1:28:00] and I lived paytech paycheck to paycheck
[1:28:04] the the
[1:28:09] I believe I had my first child
[1:28:16] but uh
[1:28:18] I didn't have money to buy a stroller
[1:28:22] and he says you don't have a stroller I
[1:28:24] said no no
[1:28:27] here go buy a stroller
[1:28:31] that's the love for the people yes
[1:28:35] but not just the money
[1:28:37] but giving the words
[1:28:40] giving the giving the word of God
[1:28:46] and I would like to read this scripture
[1:28:49] because I believe that this is the life
[1:28:52] that he that he that he lived
[1:28:56] Romans 8 1 Romanos Uno
[1:29:00] there is therefore now
[1:29:02] no Camden condemnation to them which are
[1:29:05] in Christ Jesus
[1:29:07] who walk not after the flesh
[1:29:10] but after the spirit
[1:29:12] is
[1:29:23] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:29:26] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[1:29:29] law of sin and death
[1:29:33] Jesus
[1:29:38] you know we we have many we can have
[1:29:41] many examples in this world
[1:29:45] you know they you know the Sports
[1:29:49] everything there movie stars Los
[1:29:50] Deportes de Hollywood we have many
[1:29:54] examples we can have many examples
[1:29:57] but to me the greatest example that I
[1:30:01] have ever seen is
[1:30:04] our founding pastor Pastor there can be
[1:30:08] no other greater example to me
[1:30:12] you know
[1:30:14] probably the greatest man
[1:30:18] that I have ever known you know because
[1:30:22] I I never had a really close
[1:30:24] relationship with my father
[1:30:30] and I I
[1:30:34] literally hated the the man
[1:30:43] I I I hated him law or the other for
[1:30:47] years
[1:30:49] and I talked with our founding Pastor
[1:30:51] one day
[1:30:53] and he said
[1:30:57] he says I don't
[1:30:59] know what you your situation
[1:31:04] but whatever your father has done
[1:31:08] you still gotta honor him
[1:31:15] he says you got to forgive him
[1:31:17] whether he asked for it or not
[1:31:22] and one day I just said you know what
[1:31:25] Lord
[1:31:27] take it away
[1:31:29] and I felt such a pressure come off my
[1:31:32] shoulders
[1:31:35] those are the words
[1:31:39] of wisdom
[1:31:43] you know um
[1:31:46] when when uh talk about being prepared
[1:31:49] Orlando preparado I remember the first
[1:31:53] time I ever spoke
[1:31:55] we came down from Silver City Benin was
[1:31:59] the Silver City I think it was in in
[1:32:01] Messiah right brother Dan uh in Messiah
[1:32:04] so I'm driving down and I'll say yeah
[1:32:07] I'm gonna hear a great message
[1:32:11] so I walk in the building
[1:32:13] and he says so you're going first is
[1:32:40] and uh
[1:32:42] brother Tommy hermano Tomas it's not he
[1:32:45] always I I preached the service uh for
[1:32:48] my grandfather
[1:32:51] and now at the end I I told my
[1:32:54] grandfather I'll see you later
[1:32:59] and he was quick to get me as soon as I
[1:33:01] got down
[1:33:04] he said let's not see you later
[1:33:08] brother Tommy until we meet again
[1:33:13] amen God bless
[1:33:15] [Applause]
[1:33:25] God bless you tonight
[1:33:27] I'm going to try to maintain my
[1:33:29] composure here
[1:33:32] because just like everyone else
[1:33:34] greater man I have known
[1:33:39] I look back
[1:33:41] you know as I as I pondered on brother
[1:33:43] Tommy
[1:33:45] Tomas not thinking about his death
[1:33:55] the impact that he had on everybody
[1:33:58] and I look back and I always remember
[1:34:02] this is
[1:34:04] when we moved to Silver City
[1:34:06] we had a hard time here in Las Cruces
[1:34:10] my dad at the time was was really heavy
[1:34:13] on drugs
[1:34:18] brother Alex Solis and sister Vita in
[1:34:20] our past Solis
[1:34:25] and told us just go to visit us in
[1:34:27] Silver City stay with us
[1:34:30] in Silver City stay with us for two
[1:34:33] weeks
[1:34:34] I want you to come to church with us
[1:34:37] just to see what it's about
[1:34:40] lo and behold he
[1:34:43] so so we get there we got the privilege
[1:34:47] and the honors
[1:34:49] to go to church
[1:34:51] and and from that day the first time
[1:34:56] my mother fell in love with the message
[1:35:01] so my mom was not leaving
[1:35:05] anymore
[1:35:07] so we ended up moving to Silver City
[1:35:10] Silver City so
[1:35:12] you know just to look at the man that he
[1:35:15] is
[1:35:18] you know like I said my mother fell in
[1:35:20] love with the kind of person that he was
[1:35:37] you know one of the greatest things that
[1:35:39] I know
[1:35:42] is
[1:35:45] I remember one time in Colombia in
[1:35:49] Colombia it was after a service
[1:35:51] and he was praying for people
[1:35:54] praying for people as he was leaving
[1:35:58] praying for people outside
[1:36:00] we had to physically restrain him
[1:36:04] and get him into the bus
[1:36:07] so one of the greatest scenes I've ever
[1:36:10] seen
[1:36:12] so he's fighting with us
[1:36:15] because he wants to get to the people
[1:36:18] he says
[1:36:23] just fighting to get to them
[1:36:31] I remember how blunt he was
[1:37:30] when his wife passed away
[1:37:35] remember that time
[1:37:37] and it was a sad times
[1:37:41] but I was already hooked
[1:37:45] I had to get to him
[1:37:47] I would hang around him
[1:37:50] I would hang around hang around outside
[1:37:52] his office
[1:37:55] Junior would take me to the office
[1:38:02] just to say hi to him so
[1:38:32] because there's something
[1:38:34] a long lasting impression
[1:38:37] Impressions
[1:38:42] because there was a truth to him
[1:38:45] the scripture says
[1:38:49] yes you receive a righteous man
[1:39:51] and he told
[1:40:01] more than ever before
[1:40:04] you know
[1:40:06] so many things and discussed that and I
[1:40:08] don't want to get into because I won't
[1:40:09] even finish
[1:40:12] rough times in our lives
[1:40:15] when things were happening
[1:40:17] when I needed something
[1:40:20] was always there yes
[1:40:24] have you ever seen a man
[1:40:27] that can walk into a room
[1:40:30] change your whole world
[1:40:33] change your atmosphere
[1:40:35] having the roughest times
[1:40:39] at home problems with your dad
[1:40:44] the police maybe whatever
[1:40:47] but he would walk in the room
[1:40:50] and the whole atmosphere would change
[1:40:58] you know people ask me well
[1:41:06] if
[1:41:33] so somebody I was a nobody yeah you know
[1:41:35] you know Erin avian I didn't come from
[1:41:37] no Legacy
[1:41:39] from a family of a
[1:41:42] pastores of a minister the ministro
[1:41:46] yet he gets me and my brother
[1:41:49] in one of the Phoenix meetings
[1:41:52] and he says you're going to help me when
[1:41:54] I get back
[1:41:57] you're going to be mine you're going to
[1:42:00] be with me
[1:42:02] and even to the point brother Daniel uh
[1:42:06] brother Daniel shared this with me one
[1:42:08] time
[1:42:09] when he was with Brothers
[1:42:19] he says you see you guys you Ronnie

[1:42:48] situation

[1:42:51] he will always be there
[1:42:54] because I'll carry him
[1:42:56] and his teachings
[1:42:59] and closing
[1:43:01] I went to go see him on Friday
[1:43:05] and I was thanking him
[1:43:07] you know I would I would get his hair
[1:43:10] you know just
[1:43:11] you know just touching them you know
[1:43:15] that I was thankful for everything that
[1:43:17] he is
[1:43:24] done for me and my family is
[1:43:35] and I told him remember
[1:43:39] you remember the promise
[1:43:42] and I
[1:43:44] had been talking to him before he is
[1:43:49] know he was had his eyes closed
[1:43:52] but when I asked him that is
[1:43:55] he opened his eyes and looked at me
[1:43:58] and I began to melt something
[1:44:02] that gives to an operation is
[1:44:09] that gift was operating until the very
[1:44:12] end yes
[1:44:18] for one of the greatest Miracles I've

[1:48:49] I can remember
[1:48:50] um coming into tier C when I was a
[1:48:52] little boy
[1:48:55] and he didn't want us to leave he said
[1:48:58] you guys have to spend the night
[1:49:02] so my mom my dad my brothers were like
[1:49:05] okay
[1:49:07] and he said
[1:49:10] the boys your boys
[1:49:13] me and my three brothers take my bed
[1:49:18] is
[1:49:22] and we were like no no no no we can't
[1:49:24] take your berries no you're sleeping in
[1:49:26] my bed
[1:49:30] I was young I was six seven years old
[1:49:35] but I had a problem wearing the bed
[1:49:40] I was so petrified
[1:49:44] I think that's the first time I ever
[1:49:46] prayed
[1:49:48] I got on my knees and I said
[1:49:54] I cannot do this in this bed
[1:49:59] so I think I went to the restroom I
[1:50:02] don't know how many times before bedtime
[1:50:03] and
[1:50:09] a long story short I didn't have an
[1:50:11] accident in the bed accidentally
[1:50:16] but just just to remember that
[1:50:20] give up his own bed that was just
[1:50:22] something so special that yeah
[1:50:26] that you never forget
[1:50:30] another time I remember
[1:50:32] um
[1:50:33] the temple
[1:50:35] we were there in Silver City I had just
[1:50:37] gotten married also and
[1:50:42] he saw me and he said
[1:50:44] something's wrong hon I'm like no no
[1:50:46] everything's fine
[1:50:50] then he just stared at me
[1:50:55] and I looked at him
[1:50:57] you all remember those eyes right
[1:51:01] like like a hawk
[1:51:05] and he just said
[1:51:08] and I I had my head down and I
[1:51:12] and he's just looking at me at me
[1:51:17] you need to pay your rent huh
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:22] who told him hey he couldn't pay my rent
[1:51:27] that's only eighty dollars
[1:51:29] imagine if we paid 80 today
[1:51:35] so he just reached in his pocket
[1:51:39] this is how he rents about 80 bucks
[1:51:42] right
[1:51:44] we ran it off Uncle Mike back then
[1:51:46] Thomas
[1:51:50] so just like without hesitation he would
[1:51:53] just give from the bottom of his heart
[1:51:59] the thing is sticks out the most for me
[1:52:01] for or I'm going to call him my uncle
[1:52:02] Tommy uh
[1:52:07] Tomas was in the year 2000
[1:52:12] when my my niece had passed away from
[1:52:16] she was six months old yes there's a
[1:52:19] message there
