[51:10] we love the thrill that we feel when we
[51:12] get together with god's wonderful people
[51:19] first john chapter 3
[51:23] behold what manner of love the father
[51:25] has bestowed upon us
[51:27] that we should be called the sons of god
[51:30] therefore the world knoweth us not
[51:32] because it knew him not
[51:34] quite
[51:44] beloved now are we the sons of god and
[51:47] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[51:50] but we know that when he shall appear we
[51:52] shall be like him or we shall see him as
[51:55] he is
[52:09] little children let no man deceive you
[52:11] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[52:14] even as he is righteous
[52:22] he that committed sin is of the devil
[52:24] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[52:27] for this purpose the son of god was
[52:29] manifested that he might destroy the
[52:31] works of the devil
[52:41] verse nine whosoever is born of god doth
[52:44] not commit sin for his seed remaineth in
[52:46] him and he cannot sin because he is born
[52:49] of god
[52:58] we're thankful father for their word
[53:00] this morning
[53:03] we're thankful for your people this
[53:04] morning
[53:07] grateful for your presence
[53:10] yeah and father after this is all over
[53:36] in the book of saint john the sixth
[53:37] chapter
[53:40] and verse 26 verse of 96 jesus answered
[53:43] them say it and said
[53:45] verily verily i say unto you
[53:48] you seek me not because he saw the
[53:50] miracles
[53:51] but because he did eat of the loaves and
[53:53] were filled
[54:07] labor not for the meat which perishes
[54:09] but for that meat which endureth unto
[54:12] everlasting life which the son of man
[54:14] shall give unto you for him hath god the
[54:17] father sealed
[54:20] him
[54:31] unto him what shall we do that we might
[54:34] work the works of god
[54:47] that ye believe on him
[54:53] now i i want to uh
[54:56] entitle my message this morning
[54:58] the works of god
[55:04] and this might sound really funny or
[55:05] kind of corny or kind of strange piece
[55:08] [Music]
[55:11] but with a subtitle of
[55:13] how crispy are your cucumbers
[55:24] so you'll you'll find out a little bit
[55:26] more in a little while
[55:30] you know the word of god is is is so
[55:33] tremendous when i as i as i was hearing
[55:35] it last sunday
[55:40] and i as i hear the word of god as it is
[55:44] being ex
[55:46] expounded to us
[55:51] it has the the power in itself to
[55:54] produce
[55:57] and to bring about the exact effect that
[56:00] it is supposed to bring it
[56:06] the word of god is supposed to change
[56:11] the word of god is not a snack
[56:27] jesus says man shall not live by bread
[56:30] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[56:32] out of the mouth of god
[56:38] and the word of god is simply it's our
[56:41] nourishment it's we we we can't even
[56:44] walk unless he comes in and and dwells
[56:47] in us and and gives us what we need that
[56:50] day
[56:54] is
[57:51] then god becomes a historical figure to
[57:54] us
[57:58] i never want for god to become a history
[58:01] for us
[58:04] because a god of history can never help
[58:06] us in
[58:20] that lives
[58:34] is this is maybe you maybe you don't but
[58:37] i did
[58:40] no
[58:42] that that mary was walking around one
[58:44] day
[58:47] and all of a sudden the angel came to
[58:49] her and greeted her
[58:54] and uh and all of a sudden the the the
[58:56] holy spirit overshadowed her
[59:01] and
[59:02] then
[59:15] he said that mary and joseph were having
[59:17] a conversation
[59:21] and the conversation was according to
[59:24] the message or
[59:26] or the the teaching that the rabbi had
[59:28] done on the day before
[59:41] he said i heard what the rabbi had to
[59:44] say about about the
[59:46] miracles that god did for our fathers
[59:52] and what god did for our grandfathers
[59:57] her question was can god do it today
[1:00:03] and then mary tells joseph
[1:00:06] did you notice the scripture that was
[1:00:09] given to us
[1:00:12] in the book of isaiah in the leader of
[1:00:14] the isaiah she said let's read it if we
[1:00:17] can vomit
[1:00:19] and they started reading
[1:00:21] for unto us a child is born
[1:00:26] a son
[1:00:54] all you're going to think
[1:01:07] what the word of god has got
[1:01:28] you cannot get anything
[1:01:30] on behalf of god if you don't talk about
[1:01:33] him
[1:01:37] i like to come and as we're hearing
[1:01:40] brother branham or or hearing here or
[1:01:42] reading the bible
[1:01:47] or hearing the or or hearing the
[1:01:49] messages
[1:02:18] what does that mean significant when all
[1:02:21] of a sudden the angel repents
[1:02:24] says hail mary you say
[1:02:26] hola maria you have found favor with god
[1:02:31] i want to tell you that you're gonna
[1:02:32] you're gonna have a son
[1:02:35] scripture started being fulfilled right
[1:02:39] then and there
[1:02:43] do you know what scripture you're gonna
[1:02:45] fulfill
[1:03:00] behold i send you
[1:03:03] out hold i sent to you and be
[1:03:05] outstanding elijah the prophet and leah
[1:03:08] for the coming of the great and dreadful
[1:03:10] day of the lord
[1:03:13] the scripture that belongs to us
[1:03:17] that identifies god in our age
[1:03:27] child is giving
[1:03:41] when you when you come to to the to the
[1:03:44] realization of where we're at
[1:03:50] and the bible speaks to us in the book
[1:03:52] of numbers
[1:03:56] and you find out that that these
[1:03:59] were uh the israelites were were a
[1:04:02] people
[1:04:04] israelites
[1:04:07] it seemed like they always complained
[1:04:09] about something
[1:04:33] did you ever complain because you were
[1:04:35] too blessed
[1:04:36] yes
[1:04:49] and it becomes a complaint about
[1:04:51] everything
[1:05:20] we get rib eye and
[1:05:22] rib eye and and porterhouse steaks we
[1:05:24] get the best every sunday morning
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:31] it's not enough
[1:05:33] but this is where the israelites found
[1:05:35] themselves
[1:05:38] and they said in chapter 11 and verse
[1:05:41] and verse 5.
[1:05:45] we remember the fish
[1:06:02] and the garlic
[1:06:04] but now our soul is dried away
[1:06:10] there is nothing at all
[1:06:13] besides this manna before our eyes
[1:06:22] what they had forgotten is when they
[1:06:24] were eating the fish
[1:06:28] when they were eating the
[1:06:30] cucumbers pepinos when they were eating
[1:06:33] the melons
[1:06:36] and the onions
[1:06:38] and the garlic
[1:06:40] what they had forgotten was the basic
[1:06:42] thing the most cruel thing that they
[1:06:44] were under
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:06:59] the bars can be made out of gold but
[1:07:01] you're still a slave.
[1:07:08] they had forgotten
[1:07:11] that now they were free
[1:07:23] they had a slave mentality
[1:07:29] unless somebody whipped them that day
[1:07:34] they weren't comfortable
[1:07:37] unless somebody told them what to do
[1:07:40] again
[1:08:01] they all of a sudden came into this
[1:08:03] slavery
[1:08:06] when god frees them by the mighty hand
[1:08:08] of moses
[1:08:12] and they got to a hard place
[1:08:15] all they could remember was the fish and
[1:08:18] the cucumbers
[1:08:22] the melons
[1:08:34] and my question this morning to people
[1:08:37] is this
[1:08:39] how crispy are your cucumbers
[1:08:48] they were in
[1:08:50] the wilderness
[1:08:53] if they had any cucumbers
[1:08:56] by now they have become pickles
[1:09:04] amargost they had already become pickles
[1:09:10] but their remembrance was the cucumbers
[1:09:15] now there's nothing wrong with cucumbers
[1:09:18] i love cucumbers
[1:09:26] radishes
[1:09:28] and avocado avocado with any dish that
[1:09:31] you have you got a good dish
[1:09:46] we're gonna grow some big cucumbers
[1:09:53] but the cucumbers that they were
[1:09:55] thinking about
[1:09:58] was the imagination
[1:10:42] and how crispy are they right now
[1:10:49] jesus christ
[1:10:51] has done some marvelous things
[1:10:56] i appreciate what god did in silver city
[1:11:01] appreciate what god did it could you
[1:11:03] look at your season but i don't live
[1:11:05] back there
[1:11:07] jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:11:14] [Applause]
[1:11:38] while
[1:11:40] but i'll tell you what what peter james
[1:11:43] and john did what is it
[1:11:47] after they received the holy ghost
[1:11:50] they come to a gate called beautiful
[1:12:19] and now
[1:12:44] what i do is i take from those things
[1:12:47] that were in
[1:13:16] my wife not to embarrass her
[1:13:21] she is
[1:13:23] the greatest woman i've ever
[1:13:25] met yes
[1:13:30] she
[1:13:44] me
[1:13:46] i married her
[1:13:51] but you know
[1:13:52] me and her have a this this thing hey
[1:13:56] i'm i i'm a type of person that i i i
[1:14:00] come across really really difficult
[1:14:02] really fast
[1:14:10] that's the greatest thing man i heard if
[1:14:11] you're welcome
[1:14:20] as i was telling my mom it was a it's a
[1:14:22] gift
[1:14:25] one
[1:14:38] so
[1:14:39] so so the simplicity of it is this
[1:14:45] i do a lot of bad things with her yeah
[1:14:47] yeah you know i'll do something bad
[1:14:50] against her
[1:14:53] but immediately i say i'm sorry
[1:14:58] and then she tells me
[1:15:00] then i'll do it again
[1:15:04] and she says see you weren't you weren't
[1:15:05] sorry for it
[1:15:20] [Laughter]
[1:15:23] so how did i do it again
[1:15:26] that's how i got how crispy are your
[1:15:28] cucumbers
[1:15:32] but because she's such a great person to
[1:15:34] deal with
[1:15:51] first the cucumber
[1:15:53] turns into a pickle
[1:16:04] and you you make i love pickles how many
[1:16:07] love pickles too
[1:16:16] all right
[1:16:17] good good man went
[1:16:20] so you love pickles
[1:16:22] i love pickles sister sister paula makes
[1:16:25] some of the best pickles
[1:16:29] but a pickle
[1:16:31] is is is a is a
[1:16:35] cucumber in a jar
[1:16:39] it's already old
[1:16:41] you need to whether you need to whether
[1:16:44] you need to leave it two hours three
[1:16:46] days five days whatever it's an old
[1:16:48] cucumber
[1:16:52] that's why they call it a pickle it's
[1:16:53] not it's not it's no longer a cucumber
[1:16:57] but did you know
[1:16:59] that a gourd
[1:17:00] is the same it runs in the same family
[1:17:04] quest
[1:17:13] is in the same family
[1:17:17] so it goes
[1:17:19] not that a cucumber becomes a gourd
[1:17:24] because no it doesn't no no no
[1:17:26] but what i'm saying is it belongs to the
[1:17:28] same family
[1:17:32] this is where we find ourselves
[1:17:38] elisha
[1:17:40] comes
[1:17:42] and he finds the school of the prophets
[1:17:48] and when they come to meal time
[1:17:54] they come to the meal time
[1:18:23] what i want to tell you is this
[1:18:27] when you come to the word of god
[1:18:31] and god gives you the richness of his
[1:18:33] glory
[1:18:36] you can you can you can munch on some
[1:18:39] great cucumbers
[1:18:42] but if you use them for history
[1:18:47] they become
[1:18:48] a pickle
[1:18:52] and you're thinking that you're still
[1:18:55] eating a cucumber
[1:18:59] can you imagine the imagination of a
[1:19:02] person
[1:19:05] 40 years later puerto
[1:19:19] and this was their complaint
[1:19:35] jesus said this
[1:19:37] i am the bread
[1:19:40] that descended from heaven
[1:19:44] they were not rejecting just the manna
[1:19:48] no
[1:20:12] had now rejected the word made flesh
[1:20:30] this is what i've understood of the
[1:20:31] message
[1:20:34] when your life does not produce
[1:20:37] it it's easy to say well brother branham
[1:20:40] did it esposito said oh elementary
[1:20:46] it's an easy way out
[1:20:49] facility
[1:20:53] the denominations say
[1:20:56] the apostles vietnam
[1:21:11] so we cannot produce the fresh
[1:21:24] is
[1:21:26] it doesn't have
[1:22:09] when the people of israel came out
[1:22:11] of israel
[1:22:12] they came out in a mixed multitude
[1:22:22] you want to start getting away from
[1:22:24] church
[1:22:27] stay
[1:22:28] hang around with people that don't come
[1:22:29] to church
[1:22:35] you want to unbelieve your
[1:22:49] we were born for
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:32] five demon-possessed women there in
[1:23:36] uganda
[1:23:39] i look back
[1:23:42] to see where my dad was
[1:23:45] he wasn't there
[1:24:14] the cucumbers
[1:24:17] remember the melons
[1:24:20] remember the promise of god
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:57] but but you'll find out what happened
[1:25:02] he had a disease that made him always
[1:25:04] horrible you can imagine how he looked
[1:25:07] not sitting out for anybody
[1:25:08] could do something with that poor man he
[1:25:10] wouldn't do it it'd be a brute i listen
[1:25:13] closely as we close
[1:25:16] this man standing there on his hands and
[1:25:18] feet
[1:25:19] he thought that i wanted him to do a war
[1:25:21] dance if there happens to be a
[1:25:22] missionary here would know that's what
[1:25:24] they plan a lot for the tourists and so
[1:25:25] forth doing their tribe dance the man
[1:25:28] wasn't mentally right
[1:25:30] and i said um
[1:25:32] i want to pray with him and he
[1:25:35] kept going like that but his hands just
[1:25:37] down on his old four couldn't raise up
[1:25:40] i said look what a condition that poor
[1:25:42] human beings in
[1:25:44] that man's a soul just like i am or
[1:25:47] anybody else here
[1:25:50] i said
[1:25:51] if there's any witch doctor that's near
[1:25:54] i'll challenge you in the name of the
[1:25:56] lord jesus to come do something for him
[1:25:58] that's right
[1:26:00] everybody was crying
[1:26:02] but there'd been a vision over him
[1:26:04] i'll say the thing he's thinking about
[1:26:06] he's thinking about his brother he's
[1:26:09] born in a christian home
[1:26:11] when he's young a baby he was this away
[1:26:13] i said he's 22 years old now
[1:26:15] but i said in a christian home he was
[1:26:17] born
[1:26:18] and his parents raised up to witness the
[1:26:20] same thing but i said he had a brother
[1:26:22] that was riding either a yellow goat or
[1:26:24] a dog and he fell off and he's hurt
[1:26:27] himself and he walks on two sticks under
[1:26:29] his arms like crutches i have to look on
[1:26:32] i see the vision of the boy being healed
[1:26:34] i said but thus saved the lord
[1:26:37] the boy is healed and about a city
[1:26:39] blocked them all away from me i heard a
[1:26:41] scream and here come the boy jumping up
[1:26:43] in the air holding them crutches ovaries
[1:26:44] i had just a screaming to the top of his
[1:26:46] body it taken them 20 minutes now to get
[1:26:48] the crowds quiet in the militia all
[1:26:50] around
[1:26:51] then in a few moments i looked again to
[1:26:53] the man to see what would happen above
[1:26:54] him was a vision like a blue shadow like
[1:26:57] looking into a television there's to the
[1:26:59] man normally
[1:27:02] nobody
[1:27:04] never knows what it is i've seen the
[1:27:06] dead raise that the doctor pronounced
[1:27:08] him dead
[1:27:09] i've seen things happen when god has
[1:27:12] said so like that all devils out of hell
[1:27:15] can't stop it
[1:27:16] amen just call almighty
[1:27:18] i've seen him sitting there normally i
[1:27:21] thought here's my chance here's my
[1:27:23] chance lord i said
[1:27:25] if anybody could help that man he
[1:27:27] wouldn't do it for me
[1:27:28] but i said i'll challenge the priest of
[1:27:31] the muhammad table to come and give him
[1:27:33] his soundness i'll challenge the witch
[1:27:35] doctor or anyone else to come and give
[1:27:37] him his soundness nobody can and neither
[1:27:40] can i
[1:27:41] but the god of heaven has raised up his
[1:27:43] son christ jesus and his promised the
[1:27:46] same things that he did we would also
[1:27:48] and i have seen a vision on the body
[1:27:50] that he's going to be made well it's
[1:27:52] just saith the lord if he'll do this i
[1:27:54] said how many will believe on him and he
[1:27:56] raised her hands i walked up to the void
[1:27:58] said in the name of the lord jesus
[1:27:59] raised up he thought it was like this
[1:28:01] interpreter told him again i threw a
[1:28:03] chain and all of a sudden
[1:28:06] he raised to his feet for the first time
[1:28:09] in his mortal life
[1:28:10] the tears run down on his back belly
[1:28:14] he began weeping that crowd went into a
[1:28:17] panic and i said everyone here that now
[1:28:20] only receive jesus christ his personal
[1:28:22] savior stand to your feet thirty
[1:28:24] thousand raw heath who stood to their
[1:28:26] feet and he accepted jesus christ as
[1:28:28] personal savior at one time
[1:28:31] but
[1:28:32] ten times bigger than the day of
[1:28:34] pentecost
[1:28:36] thirty times bigger
[1:28:38] notice
[1:28:39] what taken place mr baxter come to me
[1:28:42] said brother branham i believe in
[1:28:44] physical healing i believe you are
[1:28:45] standing interpreters again i said it
[1:28:47] again i said i do not mean physical
[1:28:50] healing i mean that you accept and will
[1:28:52] renounce all other gods and you will
[1:28:55] receive jesus christ as your savior if
[1:28:58] you're sincere throw your trinkets on
[1:29:00] the ground brush your idols and it was
[1:29:01] like a stone of death where the power of
[1:29:04] god struck the place and thirty thousand
[1:29:07] of them
[1:29:11] wow that's what's the matter with the
[1:29:13] christian church today and failed to do
[1:29:16] what christ said to
[1:29:18] if i be lifted up no wonder david could
[1:29:20] god bless the lord over my soul and
[1:29:23] forget not all his benefit who forgives
[1:29:25] all of our iniquities and healeth all of
[1:29:28] our diseases
[1:29:30] he's still god denied
[1:29:42] what then does it take
[1:29:46] it takes a surrendered life
[1:30:04] yes
[1:30:18] and that's wonderful
[1:30:20] but unless you live the life that these
[1:30:23] people did
[1:30:27] there is death in the pot i'm worthy
[1:30:34] that's why the five full ministries
[1:30:39] has been so thrown at in this last time
[1:30:46] that we don't need no preachers anymore
[1:30:49] that we don't need pastors apostles
[1:30:52] pastors apostles pastors
[1:30:55] prophets teachers and evangelists
[1:30:58] that we don't need them no more
[1:31:00] not
[1:31:28] he didn't
[1:32:06] [Applause]
[1:33:20] the holy ghost guides me
[1:33:23] if the holy ghost guides you
[1:33:27] anywhere
[1:33:30] i gotta hit that one more time
[1:33:33] give me chapter verse
[1:34:16] it is not
[1:34:45] unless they are conformed
[1:34:48] and he says according to this blueprint
[1:34:55] blueprint and this he finishes after
[1:34:58] this
[1:35:00] and that is thus saith the lord
[1:35:05] how do you get away from that
[1:35:08] is the word of god
[1:35:11] in its power
[1:35:37] i don't care what you do and you go home
[1:36:08] without
[1:36:22] that want to work the works of god
[1:36:26] how do i work the works of god
[1:36:29] to believe on him
[1:36:35] this is what
[1:36:37] this and finishing now
[1:36:39] this is what jesus was trying to get to
[1:36:42] the samaritan woman
[1:36:47] the first thing that he asked
[1:36:50] for
[1:38:01] i think of the glories yes i do
[1:38:04] but i also think of everything that that
[1:38:07] went wrong
[1:38:10] i also think of things that we've lost
[1:38:14] things that have
[1:38:28] and i'm here working in uganda
[1:38:31] in uganda me and the pastor are working
[1:38:34] with a man

[1:38:59] you think
[1:39:02] what is holding back the coming of the
[1:39:05] lord

[1:39:24] foreign
[1:39:38] there's going to be a meeting in the air
[1:39:41] and we're going to meet them here
[1:39:48] how many have loved ones that have gone
[1:39:49] over to the other side
[1:39:52] we're going to meet them
[1:40:06] you've heard this before from our pastor
[1:40:09] pastor the reason that he has you meet
[1:40:12] them before
[1:40:16] before you meet him in the end
[1:40:19] because if you would meet him
[1:40:47] what a day that
