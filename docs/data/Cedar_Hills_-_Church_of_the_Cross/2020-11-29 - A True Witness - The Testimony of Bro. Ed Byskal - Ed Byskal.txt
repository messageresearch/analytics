========================================

e e [Music] [Music] we were driving in his vehicle he was driving I was sitting in the passenger side and Blaine Southwick was in the back seat I don't know what Blaine was doing at this moment but brother brandham was just driving and it was a gravel Alaska Highway was still gravel there and he said he tilted his head back a little bit and he said brother Eddie what do you think of this ministry do you think it could be that of Elijah the prophet as its for told in the scripture and then he mentioned several time several places and then he said into Revelation and then his voice just trailed off well I want to stop there brother bram's voice when he was I would say deep under anointing in the deep in a vision he's actually in another world and he would say uh-huh uh-huh you notice when he was when he is has people before him and he starts telling them in detail about their lives and about why they're there and you're praying for someone and he was in the war and you have a letter from your daughter in your purse and uhhuh uhhuh and his voice would just get what I call thick kind of Deep thick and trails off and sometimes not very clear in what he's saying not too hard not too easy to hear well that's how the voice went and so I knew that he was just under uh in a deep somewhere in a deep Vision said what do you think of this ministry he did not say my Ministry he said this ministry you think it could be that of Elijah the prophet as it's foretold in the scriptures in the Revelation and so on and then he just trailed off I said well for I felt very inadequate to answer that kind of a question I didn't feel spiritually adequate you know I didn't feel as though I was adequate to answer that question and I looked down at the glove box and I said well for all I know brother brandom it must be it has every appearance of being and and and then he said I kind of think so myself and at that instant with the complete Union of what our agreement in agreement at that instant all I can tell you is that it was a person I believe the angel of the Lord just between us and slightly forward not right here but just slightly forward the presence of a person and I literally I froze I thought I was going to die I thought I was going to pass into some other place I didn't know anything about and I was just staring at the box and I was afraid to move and the presence was so holy the presence was so all consuming you just could not not that you wanted to escape it but it was just um just all complete complete presence gripping you and I just stared at the box and I I looked up I only knew one thing to do and that is to see how brother brandom is reacting to this and I just looked I cast my eyes kind of sideways to look at him we had about 4 days beard on 3 4 days beard I would say we we we we had been out in the bush and his beard was sticking out prickling like very prickly and and his face was pale and I thought he looks like a person near death I'd only seen it once before in my life and I'd been with a very good friend of mine I just came to his house I just pulled in and he had been pinned between two heavy pieces of equipment with his temples and a Truck and a loader behind it and he was pinned between the two and he used all of his strength probably a super natural strength at that moment and just to press the push the two pieces of equipment apart and that freedom and when I happened to drive in they had him laid out on his sofa and I noticed that his beard from the shock to the system his beard had prickled out and he was just pale and that whole image just flashed to my mind in an instant when I looked at brother Brenham and that I just thought that and brother Brenham kind of rolled his head back looked over to me he said I guess he's come to me brother Eddie 10,000 times 10,000 and that's every time the same it's just like I could die and at that instant we were just driving a curve in the highway and there was a big bull moose standing right in the middle of the road and it it startled me oh I said I said brother brandham there's a moose and I hadn't gotten a moose and I needed a moose and he just kept driving he never slowed down we were we weren't not going fast he said it's all right brother Eddie just get your gun in your shells and kind of like he's yours sort of thing and he just kept driving he drove up so close that that and I shot that moose and uh we dressed the Moose out and brother bam sat here just on my left and he sat on the log and we just dressed the Moose out and when we were done we walked back to the car and I I stepped into the car and disclosed the door and I can't describe the atmosphere it was it was just so Serene and so marvelous the after effect of the whole thing and the presence of that person and brother Bram said every time he comes something good happens and I've used that phrase many times every time he comes whether it's in a church service or in a family's life or a home is's a distinct atmosphere of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and every time he comes something good happens [Music] [Music] I was here in Vancouver attending a wedding and we heard I got a phone call that brother Bram had been in an accident and and was hanging between life and death and in the in amarella Texas and we I went I caught the plane first thing in the morning went home called brother Tom Brown asked him to keep me informed and my wife and I were sitting in our home on December the 24th Christmas Eve and then I just had an Awakening I said just think I said just think dear here the airwaves are filled with Joy to the World the Lord Has Come Joy to the World and It Came Upon a Midnight Clear I said and all the store windows are filled with the manger scene and people are singing carols and churches are having special meetings or whatever more at this season it's the same as they were singing the songs of the Psalms of Christ and his crucifixion when they were crucifying him and I [Music] said they have missed the John the Baptist and now I said here we've had a most phenomenal Ministry in brother brenham's Ministry if and we believe he's the Forerunner of Christ second coming if he's had that such a phenomenal Ministry and so Supernatural and you know so uh it was like reaching into another realm another world so many times I said if he lives beyond Christmas and just dies I said I will not understand that but I said just think I'm speaking to my wife just think if he should pass away right at this Christmas season I said what a remarkable thing that would be to a nation that is a drift from God and about two hours later I got a phone call that brother Bram has just passed away on Christmas [Music] Eve I thought the only thing that would be left to do is go across this country and scream out it's it's over it's too late it's it's over and uh so that was on my heart and I was expecting to go and now brother brandham was gone the messenger's gone we're not going to be going back to Jeffersonville to special meetings to hear him uh kind of the bottom had fallen out of everything and we had to find ourselves the hunger for God was not Abad and I I had felt now for some months I had felt that I should return West and uh I gave the company where I was working they were very good to me I gave them several months notice and then I left Toronto but I had no job no income no nothing and moved here to Cloverdale and after about 3 4 years I was supporting myself doing my best to support myself which we continued to do and then we built our our home a new home another home and made the old house which we had bought we turned it into Cloverdale bway house or Bible Way house and from it it grew to a log Church from the log Church to the church where we presently are today in the school in the camp um but I consider all the blessing of God upon the work has been solely off for one thing and that is because we always were putting forward the message the message to us is Christ we're putting forth Jesus Christ this is Jesus Christ and and this is what he's doing now today and he sent a word he sent a message for us and whether it was on the radio where we had radio for about 9 years cleaning the tape so they could hear Brother bram's voice and H have the same effect that it's had on us and then we wanted to print the message books it was it was just a p passion with us we were absolutely obsessed with getting the message to other countries to get it in their language I felt that was the most honorable and the most privileged thing we could do and we have continue to this day [Music] they had a a luncheon and I think there was 122 ministers to a international and they call it the first International it was all Philippine done by the Philippine people and done by the Philippine church I sat there one of the ministers who I understand is even a lawyer he said I've wanted to translate a certain certain mage message I can't find that message I happen to have a copy of that message in my Bible and so I just slipped it out and I said here's a copy right here you can have this one and he was so happy then I got I went to my hotel room while the dinner was still going on and I went to my hotel room and I I just sat there in front of my computer and I I started typing on a clean page um Minister's profile your name your address I just asked a whole lot of questions one of the main questions was how many tapes do you have of William brandham because all kinds of people were spreading their tapes and I want to know how many tapes they had of William brandham how many message books do you have of William brandham and uh how can we help you to serve the Bride of Jesus Christ better and they could write their little note there and then I asked them to sign their name and they could attach some pictures if they wished and if they wish to fill one out fine if they didn't that was fine and after that one single visit we came home and after about three weeks I asked sister Leo would you please make a summary of all the returns that we've had thus far and there was about 150 that had filled it out even though there was only about 122 there but about 150 had sent in uh these return these profiles ministers profiles and this was a shock that broke my heart of the 150 92 didn't have a single tape of William brandham 92 and I just shook my head how does this country have ministers from America going over year after year after year after year having meetings and conventions and preaching what in the world are they preaching these people don't have the message and that has always been my passion I just felt that my time my energies are have to be aligned to presenting Christ to these people and making him available to them [Music] I called the trustees from our church and this was the initial movement and I can't tell you I didn't have any particular Vision or dream but I just knew I could see it and uh we went out for a dinner at a restaurant in Fort Langley and I said I have a vision that I would like to present to you and I began to draw a a unit I said this is called a message kiosk and it's about 5T High about 18 24 in wide and about 24 in deep has a screen here I could see kiosks and the people were using it in the industry and and and we have the the best product there is so uh shortly after that I was making a trip to Africa and I stopped in Amsterdam and I was in the hotel late at night around midnight and asking for a room and the girl was at the desk just one girl and she was making out my forms and I looked and here was exactly the same color here was a like a aluminum uh unit about 5T tall sitting there with a big sign on it says print 22 pages of your favorite newspaper and I said to the girl I said what is that she said that's a that's a newspaper kiosk I walked over to it and there was a screen and I just touched it and up came the map of the world I thought that's how incredible this is exactly what I've drawn and is what I see in fact is we had a whole aspect that this didn't have so they would print out part of newspaper what I envisioned was the flags of Nations coming up because it has to be International people who don't speak or read English they maybe speak just their own language tribal language but they one thing they would know is their flag uh this flag so they touch the flag and it brings up the languages that the message is available in and they could and then it would be in their language and they could understand that and down here is a finger coming to a button to print and they touch that touch the button and there's a little printer in there and out comes a fully printed message book in that language the internal workings of the unit really is the translation and the storage of it in a computer system and they could have any kind of printer and they would have different printers and we realized that they would have to get their own and not only that a lot of the ministers today because computers are cheaper and they have their own laptop or whatever more and so we could just provide them with a or put it on the internet The Hub and that's what that's where the Hub came from the Hub is the internal workings of the chaos and the Beautiful part of it it doesn't it doesn't come from Bible believers it's not connected to our church it just belongs to the bride it's anybody's and everybody's God has allowed us to go into China to go into Africa to go into places like the Congo and there's been a huge work in the Congo but it's not over the people still need to have access to the message to be able to search the message uh there's people in Mala and Zimbabwe and Nigeria and Uganda so we just keep surging ahead and translating the King James version of the Bible I just couldn't sit here hold my Bible in my hand and know that the Chinese people 1 billion 300 million people maybe closer to 400 million that don't have an accurate King James version of the Bible and it took about 18 years for this Bible to be I'm enthused about it I'm very very enthused about it and I just think nothing can stand in the way no matter whether it's governments or who it is and to be able to put the message to put that prophet's voice up into the heavens for me and my belief is it's a great voice from Heaven as the Bible speaks of and is there permanently and they can have all the rubbish up there but we have a Vindicated voice up there and if I were a young man today I would want to do as you Brothers do know everything I could know about that technical world so I could utilize it for the gospel for the industry but yet looking back in retrospect I can see where God allowed me to become in contact with the printing press for commercial per purposes and and the world and business and all the rest of it and on down the road a few years what is that to God that's nothing it's just a breath I I needed to know about paper and about ink and about printing presses and so on the first time I went to India I had to buy a printing press and it was a platin hand handheld press I knew all about platin presses and I knew all about the different manufacturers of it and so on so forth that's when I could just turn around quickly and say that's what that was about that's why I had that work and whatever whatever field you're in if your life is given over to God you'll you'll find that what you learned in life will be useful in the kingdom of God thy kingdom come and thy will be done so I believe that uh I in fact is I can say authoritatively that what and how God has led a life even from Youth and up through the teen years into married life and so on so forth how God has led that's how God wants to use a person and he will use them so I I'm very very pleased and very happy to be able to say that and I'm very happy when I see young ladies young men want to give their lives to God let their lives be a testimony and I think of the words brother bradam said a true witness of the True Vine and that has always been a slogan with me a true witness I want to be a true witness of the True Vine [Music] [Applause] [Music] that I wanted to convey in this episode is the feeling that I had the feeling of disappointment the feeling of disillusionment that I had with what I was seeing amongst the what I would consider a first class people of Believers uh we believed a Full Gospel and I have here uh a couple of the magazines this is uh a March 1958 this is I simply are bringing this up to let the people see what was taking place and uh this is a a picture of the evangelists uh just a very very few of them and then as we open it up there is a article by one of the evangelists and then as we open up the next page and I'm BR bringing this so that you can uh see what was taking place during that time there were large enormous meetings taking place everywhere and uh just dozens of evangelists and healing meetings taking place this first meeting is uh one of brother bram's meetings it's reporting on written by Gordon Lindsay and you can see the crowd here is there's just tens of thousands of people and then uh I think the first article was more cell and then this article has to be winning the nation's Crusade one of these men here is Lou Petrus who brother brandham refers to and then uh on this page here is all different evangelist brother Brenham is there in the corner uh Tommy Hicks is here I believe one of these men is Jack Cole I'm not certain and uh so we can see there's uh 4 8 12 16 uh 20 24 men on the on this page alone these are all very notable event list and healing meetings everywhere this is RW col pepper I was never in one of his meetings but he was very very well known and had tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people in Bombay India and that's the crowd in Bombay India uh that was 1958 and then in this 1958 magazine here once again we open it up and across the top is just uh number of evangelists and uh tent meetings all of them had tent meetings with maybe 25 30,000 people it was an atmosphere that caused a young man like myself a young Minister I thought that you know they're going to win Nations for Christ this is what they're doing and there was such a move of God brother bandam calls it a Revival of the restoration of the gifts and it was remarkable manifestation and something that I want to have you understand is that while this while these magazines which are this is worldwide Revival I don't even know who put this one out this one was put out uh I think think by Gordon Lindsay there was voice of healing that was taking place but then a lot of these people had their own magazines or Roberts Tommy Hicks Tommy osbor they all had their own EV Evangelistic uh uh meetings and showing the large crowds and the tents and the Revival this was taking place all over from one state to the next uh from Indianapolis to Minnesota to to Texas and all over the states and shareport and so on and incredible meetings and overseas and Tommy osbor was overseas and in Holland and made movies of it which I I saw their film I saw Tommy hex's film of Argentina and I understand that uh the president of Argentina gave him the keys to the city so with this kind of move of God I also saw it begin to diminish and this was 1958 1958 1958 then we come to 1961 and 1965 if we get into 1965 [Music] just leafing through the magazine this is Bishop Stanley who gave brother brandham the Bible in birth pains I believe it is and then I would like to say and I would like to make this point emphatically it is these people that said certain things about the ministry of William brandham and when you get to the end of these meetings this magazine here for example which is uh 1978 you see nothing of these meetings this is Ern Baxter an article by ER Baxter who is Brother bram's first manager in his article he does say that of all of the times of discernment when the prophet of God was speaking to the people and Discerning their sicknesses and diseases and why they were there he said there was never once there was an error that's what they said he said there's never once that's been an arror and I also I would like to share this magazine this is a Full Gospel men's voice very po popular this is put on by the businessmen the elite I would say of America and this is what they said and I wish to read it in Bible days there were men of God who were prophets and seers but in all the sacred records none of these had a greater Ministry than that of William Brown a prophet and Seer of God whose photograph appears on the front cover of this issue of Full Gospel men's voice brandom was used brandom has been used by God In The Name of Jesus to raise the dead and this article is beyond the curtain of time and that's why brother Brenham sent the article sent the magazine to me me and perhaps knew that we were going to once again Face the People it's not us who said that that's what they said back here that's what all of these great evangelists and ministers and furthermore I have also another volume here which is uh been written and authored by Professor David Edward Harold professor at the University of of Birmingham Alabama and he said in his book Upon A Revival of 1947 to 58 he said this most of the participants of the Revival looked upon brandom as its initiator out of his massive Union meetings in 1947 spread reports of hundreds of Miracles and marbles brandom seemed an unlikely leader he was introduced to the Pentecostal uh World by the despised Oneness Pentecostals but his preaching was halting and simple beyond belief but William brandham became a prophet to a generation this is Professor David Edwin Harold we did not write this book this is what they said this is what the Full Gospel men's said this is what these magazines have said that he was the initiator and I can say as one who has traveled the world there is an ongoing Supernatural Ministry in Russia in Africa in China in Europe and all over North America of people who caught the voice and heard the voice of of this prophet he was they missed it they thought he was just there to heal the sick that wasn't it a prophet is sent always to call the people back to the word of God and that was his call his Commission his message should forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ and it has done so and there are churches everywhere and I'm here to declare [Music] that for
