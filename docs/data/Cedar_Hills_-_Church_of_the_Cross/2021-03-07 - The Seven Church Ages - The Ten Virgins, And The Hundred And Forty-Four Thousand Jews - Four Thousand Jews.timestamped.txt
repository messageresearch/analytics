[0:00] now this morning we're going to try to
[0:02] tie
[0:03] the lord willing some of those things in
[0:06] of the uh between the church ages
[0:10] these right in here there's something
[0:12] goes in 144
[0:14] 000 the rendez the sleeping virgin
[0:18] the wise virgin and the ceiling of the
[0:20] holy ghost marking of the beast
[0:22] all those things in the and the dark age
[0:26] of 1500
[0:27] the uh catholic hierarchy when they was
[0:31] established in united church and state
[0:32] together
[0:33] that was a post-millennium they thought
[0:36] that they were
[0:37] they were absolutely in the millennium
[0:39] because the church had
[0:41] received its biker one like christ to
[0:44] sit on a throne
[0:45] and uh it was united with the church and
[0:47] state all had become well
[0:49] and the great millennium is on they
[0:51] still believe that but
[0:53] that's an era because the millennium
[0:55] can't come
[0:56] can't be issued in without the coming of
[0:59] christ
[1:00] christ brings in the millennium amen
[1:03] he's the son of prosperity and when he
[1:05] comes in will be a thousand years
[1:08] and what it is it'll be the rapture the
[1:10] church shall go up and then the return
[1:12] of christ
[1:13] and remember now what's the next thing
[1:16] we're looking for
[1:17] the rapture of the church
[1:20] now remember we're going to deal on that
[1:22] sharp this morning
[1:24] you're either in that body or out of
[1:26] that body
[1:28] no halfway between them there's no
[1:31] pretty good christians and
[1:32] and uh they're either christians or
[1:35] you're not christian
[1:37] we have this new birth now which is a
[1:39] spiritual
[1:40] that breeds out all the cult and we are
[1:43] new creatures in christ jesus
[1:45] born again of the spirit of god new
[1:48] creatures
[1:50] there is a remnant of jews to be saved
[1:55] and there is a jew which is a cast off
[1:59] because giving us a chance there is a
[2:02] lukewarm church
[2:04] and there is a spirit-filled church
[2:07] now this remnant was the sleeping
[2:11] virgin the unbeliever of that
[2:15] you be unbeliever
[2:18] and that's the center and here is
[2:21] another one
[2:22] which is a formal upper f-o
[2:26] formal church and then here is the other
[2:29] one
[2:29] which is the saved church sk
[2:33] the sage church now keep them in mind
[2:36] all the time
[2:37] now in this saved church there's two
[2:40] classes in this church right here right
[2:42] here which was type of christ
[2:45] one was a sleeping virgin and the other
[2:48] one had
[2:48] oil in the land now first
[2:52] before we do that we're going to 144 000
[2:55] of revelation 7 so that it can really be
[2:59] understood after these things i saw four
[3:02] angels standing on the four cars the
[3:03] earth
[3:04] holding the four winds that they should
[3:06] not blow up on the earth
[3:07] or on the seer any tree and i saw
[3:10] another angel descending from the east
[3:12] having the seal of the living god and he
[3:16] cried with a loud voice to the four
[3:17] angels to whom it was hurt
[3:19] he was given to hurt the sea and the
[3:21] earth saying hurt not the earth
[3:23] neither the sea or tree until we have
[3:26] sealed the servants of our god in their
[3:29] forehead now remember the servants
[3:32] has always been god's servants is the
[3:35] jew
[3:37] abraham was his servant the gentile is
[3:39] not a servant
[3:40] it's a bride it's a son this is the son
[3:44] the churches the jews are the servants
[3:47] so just remember trace that through the
[3:50] bible you'll find that the jew
[3:52] is god's servant now
[3:55] you see and then all of jerusalem was
[3:59] destroyed
[4:00] now that now this year is perfectly a
[4:02] parallel
[4:04] revelation seven now watch from the time
[4:08] of tightest besieging jerusalem
[4:11] within the world there hasn't been a
[4:14] time down to
[4:15] history that all the world went to war
[4:17] until
[4:18] 1914.
[4:22] now listen close and so then uh
[4:25] this all of them was marching toward you
[4:27] well remembered
[4:28] at 19 and 14. now is this strange
[4:32] right in the decline of the world's war
[4:34] i have the volumes of it
[4:36] volume 2 about page 44 that they
[4:39] do not know to this day who stopped that
[4:42] war it's god that stopped him the
[4:45] fulfillings were
[4:47] just at the breaking of pentecost back
[4:51] in 1906
[4:52] 1914 down there now to see whether this
[4:54] message that we got is connected with it
[4:56] or not
[4:57] the very hour that israel was signed in
[5:00] to be a nation
[5:01] it was the very same hour very same day
[5:04] very same
[5:04] month everything else i was at
[5:06] greensville indiana when that angel
[5:08] there appeared to me and sent me out on
[5:09] the deal with this
[5:12] i actually met me down on the river and
[5:13] told me what would take place that
[5:15] commissioned me
[5:15] 11 years later at the same hour that
[5:18] israel was signed in as a nation
[5:20] it's all connected together see the age
[5:22] of the lord is on earth now
[5:24] see he's moving around fixing everything
[5:27] for the coming of the lord
[5:28] and one angel went down in one state
[5:31] with abraham
[5:33] the elect sodom was down here
[5:36] and lock was inside and two angels went
[5:40] down there and preached to them
[5:42] and brought that little bitty group out
[5:44] sleeping virgin
[5:48] all right but see without intellectual
[5:51] preaching
[5:52] the thing your ears here but he's trying
[5:53] to jerk out solomon try to jerk out
[5:56] or give grace to that sleeping virgin
[5:58] amen
[5:59] but here was abraham and his christ and
[6:01] jesus said as it was
[6:03] in the days of sodom so shall it be in
[6:06] the coming of the son of man
[6:07] and then there was a space given then
[6:10] for the gentiles and they come down to
[6:12] this age
[6:13] then there's three and a half years left
[6:15] yet for the jews
[6:16] now i want to prove that there are jews
[6:20] now i'm going to take the same hurt not
[6:21] the earth neither the sea
[6:23] or any tree until we seal the servants
[6:26] of our god in their forehead now to
[6:27] prove that this revelation is right
[6:29] watch this the fourth verse and i heard
[6:31] the number of them were sealed and there
[6:33] were sealed
[6:34] [Music]
[6:35] 144 000 all of the tribes
[6:39] are the children of israel israelites
[6:42] for the act they're just now gathered
[6:45] they're up there already waiting for the
[6:47] ceiling time to come
[6:50] of the tribe of jude was sealed twelve
[6:52] thousand tribe of reuben twelve thousand
[6:54] tribe of gab twelve thousand eight
[6:56] through twelve thousand neptune twelve
[6:58] thousand
[6:58] and one simeon and on down to benjamin
[7:02] the 12 tribes
[7:03] and 12 times 12 is 144
[7:07] 000. see now that's the one now if you
[7:10] look in the
[7:11] 14th chapter just a moment here you see
[7:13] and i looked and lo
[7:14] a lamb stood on mount sinai and with him
[7:18] 144
[7:19] 000 having
[7:22] his father's name written in their
[7:25] forehead
[7:26] mount sinai the lamb had come back
[7:30] from the rapture and come back as we
[7:32] tucked the other night
[7:33] and joseph dismissed all the gentiles
[7:37] when he stood by his brother the jews
[7:39] always believed their prophets we all
[7:41] know that
[7:42] because god told him that the messiah
[7:45] would be a prophet
[7:46] you'll be a secret coming no one know
[7:48] what's going to happen
[7:50] we don't we don't meet him first we meet
[7:52] one another first
[7:54] and the dead in christ shall
[7:58] rise first and we which are alive
[8:02] that it remains shall be changed
[8:05] standing in the field of change come on
[8:07] the gray hair go out the wrinkles all
[8:10] away
[8:11] be changed in a moment and a twinkling
[8:13] of an eye
[8:15] and we shall meet our loved ones first
[8:18] and then together with them that we're
[8:20] dead says the scripture will be
[8:22] caught up in the air to meet the lord
[8:26] the order they're coming that comes 144
[8:29] 000.
[8:30] we'll receive the gospel after we can't
[8:33] receive it the same time
[8:35] the light is on the gentiles the jews
[8:37] are denying it
[8:38] hiding now when the gentiles is taken
[8:42] up then the spirit comes up on two to
[8:44] give witness to them
[8:46] then the jews receive it which is 144
[8:49] 000
[8:49] of the lost tribes of israel
[8:53] will receive the gospel and the bride is
[8:55] taken away now there's 10 virgins
[8:57] let's strike matthew 21 then shall the
[9:00] kingdom of heaven be likened to 10
[9:02] virgins which took their lamps
[9:04] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[9:08] now and five of them were wise
[9:11] and five were foolish and
[9:14] they that were foolish took their lamps
[9:17] and took the
[9:18] aura with them but the wise took oil
[9:22] in their vessels with their lamps
[9:26] while the bridegroom tarried let's see
[9:28] these church ages
[9:30] they're slumbered and slept and at
[9:31] midnight
[9:33] there was a cry made behold
[9:36] the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him
[9:39] and all those virgins
[9:40] arose and trim their lamps and the
[9:42] foolish said
[9:44] said unto the wise give us of your oral
[9:48] for our lamps are gone out but the wires
[9:52] answered saying
[9:52] not so unless there be not enough
[9:56] for us and you but go ye rather to them
[9:59] that sell and buy for yourselves pardon
[10:02] me
[10:03] and while they went to bob the
[10:04] bridegroom came
[10:06] and they that were ready went in with
[10:09] him
[10:09] to the marriage and the door was shut
[10:13] afterwards came also the other virgin
[10:15] saying lord lord open to us
[10:18] i see there wasn't unbelievers just good
[10:20] people
[10:21] open to us but the answer but he
[10:24] answered and said dearly i
[10:26] say unto you i know you not
[10:30] once therefore for you know neither the
[10:32] day nor the hour when the son of man
[10:34] shall come
[10:37] now watch the both of them were virgins
[10:41] if you take that name virgin and run it
[10:43] down it means
[10:44] that means holy clean
[10:48] sanctified so the greek word
[10:52] for clean is sanctified the hebrew word
[10:55] is holy holy clean and sanctified is all
[10:59] the same word
[11:00] so this was not a filthy
[11:04] dirty church it was a sanctified
[11:08] clean church 10
[11:11] virgins went out to meet the bridegroom
[11:13] what does it mean
[11:14] all these churches not

[11:45] the word they believed their
[11:46] denomination let him preach
[11:48] this one could not go in or there was no
[11:52] oil in the land they went back to pray
[11:55] up to receive the holy ghost but while
[11:57] they were gone
[11:58] it's all over amen now you get it
[12:03] while they went to buy they're trying to
[12:05] buy now
