[27:22] [Music]
[27:32] jesus
[27:36] [Music]
[27:46] oh
[27:48] how many believe the great physician
[27:53] now is near my mind
[27:58] sympathizing jesus
[28:01] oh it's so wonderful to be in his
[28:05] presence
[28:09] such a privilege that the lord through
[28:12] our pastor would give me the privilege
[28:14] to
[28:15] bring part three on the inoculation
[28:18] of god
[28:24] with a subtitle beyond
[28:28] immunity
[28:33] [Music]
[28:37] it's not funny it's kind of strange
[28:41] since the the last time i ministered
[28:44] everything that's gone on
[28:48] in the political world and our our
[28:50] president god bless his soul
[28:55] i pray that god will save his soul
[28:59] i have nothing against him and how
[29:02] he was he got the virus
[29:08] and then now he says he's immune
[29:14] but is he is he truly immune
[29:19] well he might be immune against brother
[29:22] milo
[29:23] corona virus but where
[29:28] but he might get sick of another virus
[29:32] so is that the kind of immunity that god
[29:35] just gives a personal immunity
[29:40] but really in order to get true immunity
[29:46] it has to go beyond what
[29:50] immunity is of this body
[29:55] and tonight we're going to see why the
[29:58] jesus
[29:59] really could not produce the inoculation
[30:03] how many remember what the inoculation
[30:06] is
[30:13] against this virus and helps your body
[30:16] produce
[30:16] antibodies
[30:20] to fight the virus
[30:24] that's what it is it's lucas but
[30:27] immunity is the state or quality
[30:29] of not being susceptible
[30:33] to any virus
[30:44] am i reading that right is that thing
[30:45] off
[30:48] it looks like it stopped to me it's 7
[30:51] 26 i've already been up here three or
[30:53] four minutes
[30:55] so i just want to make sure that i do
[30:57] not go over my time
[31:00] you're so kind to open your bibles
[31:04] the 12th chapter of saint john
[31:09] the juan capitulo amen
[31:14] how many brought your bibles tonight yes
[31:21] yeah let me see if the guys got that
[31:22] scripture here for me if not i'll get it
[31:24] real quick
[31:27] john 12 28.
[31:30] people
[31:36] even though it doesn't look too hot up
[31:38] here but that's okay
[31:40] i'll just read it off my phone maybe
[31:42] it's my glasses
[31:44] john 12 8
[31:48] father glorify thy name father
[31:51] glorification
[31:52] then came there a voice from heaven
[31:54] saying i have both glorified it and will
[31:57] glorify it again
[32:04] now let's go to chapter 17
[32:09] amen here we go
[32:17] verse 5 versus cinco
[32:23] and now oh father glorified
[32:27] out me with thine
[32:30] own self how is jesus going to be
[32:34] glorified
[32:35] arapus father glorifica allah to you
[32:40] how is he going to be glorified
[32:43] he's saying glorify me with thine
[32:46] own self
[32:50] he's speaking to the father and he's
[32:53] saying the only way i'm going to be
[32:54] glorified if this will only come unless
[32:56] they're glorious
[32:57] with you yourself that's glorified
[33:00] mismo my glorification all right that's
[33:03] good stuff
[33:06] amen amen but i know himself with the
[33:10] glory which i had with thee
[33:13] before the world was
[33:16] glorious
[33:19] lord jesus we just thank you good night
[33:22] lord
[33:25] for your mercy and for your goodness
[33:29] and they're privileged to speak to your
[33:31] children
[33:34] now anoint the word to each heart lord
[33:52] that it will take us beyond the immunity
[33:55] that this body can produce
[34:01] will supply a divine protection lawyer
[34:06] we ask all this in the precious name of
[34:08] our lord and savior jesus christ
[34:17] did you all play that first clip for me
[34:19] i have up there brother tommy
[34:20] in the message hinder me not
[34:25] as i look up this quote go ahead and
[34:28] what's going
[34:33] is no on that god will glorify
[34:36] one human being by himself
[34:40] i want you to hear me i'm going on a
[34:42] limb right now
[34:45] god will not glorify one
[34:48] human being by himself that's why
[34:52] when he asked the question
[34:55] and he says father glorify me
[35:00] with the glory that i had
[35:03] before with you before the foundation of
[35:07] the world
[35:09] he says i have glorified thy name
[35:12] i have both glorified it once in jesus
[35:17] name and i will glorify
[35:20] again that in his bride
[35:24] but his bride has to be together
[35:27] as a unit to receive the glorification
[35:30] or the entering in of the spirit
[35:34] into the theophany completely so that
[35:37] there can be
[35:38] a resurrection of human flesh
[35:42] glorified how many can say amen
[35:46] you know really i i wouldn't have to say
[35:49] anything else is closing
[35:52] god bless you no
[35:56] my god is so good we just love the lord
[36:00] jesus
[36:02] you know yeah it's been such a
[36:06] tremendous thing
[36:10] i remember as i finished part two on the
[36:13] inoculation
[36:16] we left the message where we would see
[36:19] how the resurrection would produce
[36:22] that inoculation
[36:32] but before i do i was thinking of when i
[36:34] would be able to bring this third part
[36:37] this place
[36:41] and when our pastor preached part 21 of
[36:44] the parallel
[36:50] changing from one form to another
[36:53] uniform
[36:55] at the end of this his message
[36:59] he read this quote
[37:02] do you have that first one brothers the
[37:04] word
[37:06] became flesh paragraphs 183 and 184
[37:11] amen amen
[37:15] and they that are sons of god are led by
[37:18] the spirit of god
[37:19] then when the human
[37:35] and the spirit of god fills that vacancy
[37:41] where you empty yourself amen
[37:46] then will be when the church is
[38:00] let me let it go up a little bit we'll
[38:03] walk
[38:03] in his steps but coming out in two spots
[38:07] and his power in support and his
[38:09] thoughts
[38:11] and his being
[38:14] in his movies
[38:29] will become material
[38:48] let this go up because it's going up
[38:50] very slow
[38:52] the church will be so wrapped in
[38:55] christ amen did you notice that so
[38:59] rapt and cry
[39:02] and here he comes back again
[39:05] amen it went off and it came back on
[39:08] again so praise praise the lord
[39:10] so wrapped in christ the holy spirit
[39:15] mankind so away from themselves
[39:19] that they don't see themselves
[39:25] so far away from ourselves that we don't
[39:27] see
[39:28] ourselves it doesn't mean we don't
[39:32] look at ourselves in the mirror
[39:33] sometimes
[39:36] but we don't see when we look in the
[39:39] mirror we don't
[39:40] see
[39:45] but watch this they don't see themselves
[39:48] they don't
[39:48] have no but to serve god and their
[39:52] thoughts
[39:53] move on they refuse the things
[40:07] the holy spirit spoke to me in my heart
[40:10] hablo le spirito santo mi corazon
[40:11] i believe it's the holy spirit did you
[40:15] believe it the holy spirit
[40:17] yes not that i need your approval no
[40:19] necessity
[40:20] but the holy spirit speaks through you i
[40:22] believe
[40:24] he spoke to me he said now you can bring
[40:27] the third part of this message
[40:32] amen amen
[40:36] the spirit said now you can bring this
[40:38] third part
[40:41] when you are wrapped in christ
[40:44] what it says it takes you beyond
[40:47] yourself
[40:50] beyond the immunity that you could
[40:52] attain in this body
[40:57] to the complete expression of the
[40:59] inoculation
[41:01] that's on the inside of your soul a
[41:03] complete expression
[41:06] when you're wrapped in christ it reminds
[41:09] me of this song it says
[41:11] jesus on the end
[41:16] working on the outside
[41:29] amen amen it's the holy spirit wrapping
[41:33] you
[41:33] completely on the outside also
[41:38] takes you behind this immunity
[41:41] and it takes you into a realm where the
[41:44] supernatural
[41:46] god
[41:55] you say you're really going slow tonight
[41:57] well yeah so i guess the older i get the
[41:59] slower i go
[41:59] they say what is
[42:24] it's got to begin to influence your
[42:26] decisions
[42:27] influence the system
[42:44] when you get to that point will there be
[42:47] anything
[42:48] that can touch you
[42:52] we'll attain that how many believe we
[42:54] will attain them
[42:57] we are in the process of attaining it
[42:59] right now
[43:01] i love this so much jesus on the inside
[43:05] is jesus
[43:07] now could you all put that
[43:11] definition up there of the word
[43:14] heard immunity
[43:21] it's another thing you know we didn't
[43:22] even hear these words before
[43:26] that i've heard the president different
[43:28] ones and different people
[43:30] i do watch a little news probably about
[43:32] an hour a day
[43:35] i like seeing the scriptures being
[43:38] fulfilled
[43:51] a reduction of the risk of infection
[43:54] when a significant proportion of the
[43:57] population
[43:58] has become the risk of infection
[44:04] immunity or
[44:32] god will not glorify one of us
[44:49] praise the lord jesus christ
[44:52] now i would like to go to hebrews
[44:55] chapter 4.
[44:59] verse 15. verso quincy
[45:09] well we have not and high priest which
[45:12] cannot
[45:12] be touched with the feeling of our
[45:15] infirmities
[45:17] but was in all points tempted like as
[45:21] i am does it say that i am well yeah i
[45:24] am but
[45:25] no it says we are amen
[45:28] as we are
[45:52] did jesus look like he had no sin when
[45:54] he went into the temple and
[45:56] overturned the tables and the money
[45:58] exchangers and got a whip and beat the
[46:00] you know what out of them and got them
[46:01] out of the temple jesus
[46:08] the kind of priest probably said oh what
[46:10] a horrible
[46:25] amen so we have not a high priest that
[46:29] can't can he can be touched
[46:35] by the feeling of our infirmity
[46:40] feeling
[46:46] he can go every through everything that
[46:47] you and i have gone through
[46:51] but yet without this believing one word
[46:54] describe
[47:02] what word could he have disbelieved
[47:04] brother henry
[47:09] it wasn't what the word said about
[47:11] somebody else
[47:15] it was what the word said that he was
[47:19] that he could doubt what the word said
[47:30] and how many of you know that he was not
[47:32] even in the office of the high priest
[48:04] once a year he would go into the holy of
[48:06] holies
[48:10] he had to go in with the blood a little
[48:12] basin in the blood
[48:16] and he had to be sprinkling that blood
[48:18] seven times upon the mercy seats
[48:24] he had to be dressed right then
[48:28] pomegranate bells around his skirt
[48:31] is the granada and he had to walk in
[48:34] such a way that those
[48:35] bells were making noise
[48:41] and he had a rope tied around his leg
[48:46] and if he did something wrong
[48:49] and would die there in the presence
[48:52] of that shekinah glory
[48:56] gloria they would pull him out of there
[49:00] they wouldn't be able
[49:13] anybody could go in there
[49:28] is a high priest that can be
[49:31] touched why can he be touched
[49:36] i want to give the definition of that
[49:38] word touch there
[49:41] as we turn in our bibles to john chapter
[49:45] 20.
[49:48] amen amen what a tremendous thing
[49:55] glory to god
[50:26] that will bring divine immunity
[50:29] it's not just that he was touched like
[50:32] that
[50:35] something was attached to him
[50:38] and what
[51:20] a
[51:22] jesus said unto her woman
[51:26] why we pissed out
[51:33] she's opposing him to be the gardener
[51:37] say it unto him sir if thou would have
[51:40] borne him
[51:41] hence tell me where thou has laid him
[51:46] and i will take him away
[51:55] i don't want to comment too much because
[51:56] i want to get to certain things here
[51:59] and jesus said unto her mary home maria
[52:03] she turned herself and said unto him
[52:11] amen
[52:14] next verse
[52:18] all right back to verse 17 please
[52:21] and jesus said unto her touch me not
[52:25] jesus
[52:27] for i have not yet ascended to my father
[52:32] but go tell cedar hills
[52:36] church of the cross iglesias
[52:39] amen go tell my brethren are you his
[52:41] brethren is he our older brother
[52:46] i have not yet ascended to the father
[52:50] but go to my brethren and say unto them
[52:54] you did this i ascend unto
[52:57] my father
[53:11] if he was already in the office of
[53:23] and my god and your god
[53:28] can you play that second clip
[53:34] same message hinder me not
[53:38] this woman says show me where you laid
[53:41] him
[53:44] and she she calls him raboni master
[53:50] and he answers her and says don't
[53:54] touch me don't hinder me
[53:59] i am not yet ascended to my father
[54:04] in other words he resurrects
[54:09] and he's and in his resurrection he is
[54:12] still
[54:14] a man of a mother
[54:17] and a father and a genealogy
[54:21] but he don't want to be hindered until
[54:23] he's glorified
[54:25] him god
[54:28] amen so he says i must ascend to my
[54:32] father
[54:33] don't hinder me by calling me master
[54:37] amen
[54:41] now we begin to understand the two
[54:42] scriptures that we read last time if you
[54:44] want to mark them down
[54:48] because i don't want to take a lot of
[54:50] there's so much i just
[54:52] it's good for you to study at home
[54:53] anyways
[54:55] acts 2
[54:59] verses 30 through 33 but i actually
[55:02] do want to read
[55:06] the 33rd verse can you get acts 233 for
[55:09] me gentlemen
[55:13] i want you to begin to notice the
[55:14] sequence of these things
[55:18] jesus had already talked to his
[55:20] disciples and preached to them and john
[55:22] jesus how he had to go away or the
[55:27] comforter would not come
[55:31] and he gave them the promise of
[55:32] everything that this holy ghost
[55:35] would do when it would come to something
[55:39] and when he did that in chapters 14 to
[55:41] 17.
[55:44] he was prophesying of what would
[56:06] [Applause]
[56:14] therefore being by the right hand of god
[56:18] exalted
[56:21] go ahead brother henry
[56:25] exalted notice
[56:29] here then now he's ascending
[56:34] to the father and now he becomes
[56:37] exalted there and what happens watch
[56:41] the scripture therefore being by the
[56:44] right hand of god exalted
[56:46] comma
[56:50] having received of the father
[56:55] the promise the promise
[56:57] [Music]
[57:09] and receive the promise not of the sun
[57:11] now
[57:15] the promise of the father
[57:22] the promise of the holy ghost the
[57:24] promise
[57:38] let's go back to luke 24.
[57:42] i want to give you the scriptures for
[57:44] these things
[57:46] because everybody thinks jesus died he
[57:48] rose he went to heaven
[57:50] and and the holy ghost came to christ
[58:14] amen amen he said unto them
[58:18] these are the words which i spake unto
[58:21] you while
[58:22] i was yet with you
[58:26] exactly what we just mentioned look at
[58:28] this tom i've already told you about all
[58:30] these things
[58:32] well i was yet with you that all things
[58:35] must be fulfilled
[58:38] which are written in the pro law of
[58:41] moses
[58:43] and in the prophets and in the psalms
[58:48] concerning me
[58:53] remember we just heard where the father
[58:56] answered jesus
[58:57] in john chapter 12 and he said
[59:01] i have both glorified glorification
[59:05] and will glorify you and here we see it
[59:08] being glorified
[59:11] but now in order for it to be glorified
[59:13] again
[59:15] there has to be a resurrection
[59:30] that's the only
[59:58] now i want you all to get this not just
[1:00:00] understand the scriptures and
[1:00:02] in general everything else
[1:00:06] what was he concerned about the
[1:00:07] scriptures that he had to fulfill
[1:00:11] and he wants us to be concerned about
[1:00:13] the scriptures that we
[1:00:14] must fulfill
[1:00:19] amen amen
[1:00:27] and he said unto them is it written
[1:00:31] and thus it behooved christ to
[1:00:34] suffer necessarily christopher rise
[1:00:38] from the dead
[1:00:44] next verse
[1:00:47] and that repentance and remission of sin
[1:00:50] should be
[1:00:51] preached in his name among all nations
[1:01:08] i can see myself walking in the streets
[1:01:10] of africa again
[1:01:14] africa maybe not literally
[1:01:17] but spiritually maybe my theophany will
[1:01:21] take a trip over there
[1:01:33] and ye are witnesses of these things
[1:02:01] watch what he could do after he'd
[1:02:04] suffered
[1:02:15] of my father upon you that my
[1:02:20] who was going to send the promise upon
[1:02:22] them
[1:02:24] jesus jesus but not as a son
[1:02:30] but as a high priest
[1:03:14] wherever
[1:03:42] you are
[1:03:55] that pertains to the bride
[1:04:19] brothers can you give me that quote i'm
[1:04:21] gonna jump some things because
[1:04:23] i'm not gonna be able to get to all the
[1:04:26] material that i have here
[1:04:29] and i would like to go to that quote in
[1:04:32] the resurrection
[1:04:34] of jesus
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:44] here it is now watch this video
[1:04:49] aren't you glad that god's in our
[1:04:50] prophet content
[1:05:03] i can't drink at all but if i could
[1:05:07] okay
[1:05:11] oh now this is working better good thank
[1:05:13] you brothers appreciate it
[1:05:15] it's a hard job how many given applause
[1:05:22] now in saint luke the 24th chapter 31
[1:05:26] verses 23
[1:05:30] i wish to read a little text you see
[1:05:33] our lesson tonight
[1:05:46] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[1:05:48] him
[1:06:02] by
[1:06:13] jesus had already been glorified
[1:06:18] in a while we'll get into john 20 and
[1:06:20] because luke
[1:06:21] and john lucas speak very similar
[1:06:24] very similar of the same events
[1:06:29] even though john gives the most detail
[1:06:36] praise the lord from god in the
[1:06:38] beginning he was the word of you
[1:06:40] in a principle he was the angel of god
[1:06:44] it was with the children
[1:07:17] the smallest man in the city had to
[1:07:19] climb up in the trees
[1:07:26] and i think of him that when he had
[1:07:29] risen from the dead i want you to get
[1:07:31] this part here
[1:07:32] this is where it's going to start
[1:07:33] opening up the office of a high priest
[1:07:41] was he let's go back he had risen from
[1:07:44] the dead that morning
[1:07:48] that he was then had his own
[1:07:51] blood as a
[1:08:21] but when jesus took his blood
[1:08:25] can you imagine such a thing
[1:08:29] that jesus when he rose
[1:08:32] he could see the high priest sprinkling
[1:08:35] the blood on the mercy seat
[1:09:04] to enter
[1:09:46] it was no longer
[1:10:13] he saw everything exactly the way i was
[1:10:15] in heaven
[1:10:18] and when he made the tabernacle he did
[1:10:21] everything exactly
[1:10:25] and now jesus was going to be the high
[1:10:28] priest
[1:10:42] sprinkled
[1:10:57] i'm not finished yet i've got work to do
[1:11:01] i've got to make the way okay
[1:11:24] there was
[1:11:38] and i know as humans this guy man gets
[1:11:42] all jittery
[1:11:45] and i've hurt my brother some of my
[1:11:47] brothers or sisters
[1:11:50] and i'm not throwing at them maybe
[1:11:52] that's
[1:12:06] and i don't want to go into things that
[1:12:08] sound hard you know
[1:12:10] i'll leave that to the past and i say
[1:12:13] could you wait a minute please put this
[1:12:16] better moment
[1:12:18] of our seat or power
[1:12:35] well maybe you just haven't been able to
[1:12:38] discern
[1:12:39] the difference between one and the other
[1:12:41] the protons
[1:12:44] and then i make a real tape and
[1:12:46] it makes people might think that i think
[1:12:48] i'm somebody
[1:13:43] sickness because
[1:13:54] and his own blood was fresh upon the
[1:13:58] earth
[1:14:01] i did not have fear for this virus
[1:14:04] one second don't hit me no
[1:14:09] not because i'm a goody goody
[1:14:24] because he put his hiss of the serpent
[1:14:26] on
[1:14:37] [Music]
[1:14:40] praise god
[1:14:44] he broke through every bill there was
[1:14:46] and unveiled god to man
[1:14:50] went way above the heavens of heaven
[1:15:09] next paragraph please if we don't get
[1:15:12] past this
[1:15:14] all above
[1:15:18] and there he opened up a channel that
[1:15:21] god
[1:15:22] used to come down
[1:15:26] to the corridors of heaven
[1:15:29] he talked to man in the garden of eden
[1:15:33] and satan by sin had blocked them
[1:16:04] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:16:07] it's still in that message but he says
[1:16:09] this
[1:16:10] he says why when jesus rose from the
[1:16:13] dead
[1:16:15] he didn't just sit on the tomb
[1:16:30] he knew that his work was not
[1:17:42] i'm not doing too bad i'm trying to
[1:17:45] well you all pray for me amen for me
[1:17:48] let's go to this other message
[1:17:52] the great and mighty conquer earth
[1:18:07] is this it brothers it looks like it
[1:18:12] yes watch this video it was still on the
[1:18:15] high priest
[1:18:18] and then he came he came down
[1:18:22] because he was in the beginning
[1:18:39] up on that glorious day
[1:18:44] in in pascua he became not only the word
[1:18:50] but he became the high priest
[1:19:02] i'm getting too drunk here you know
[1:19:04] maybe i better sit down and let somebody
[1:19:05] else preach
[1:19:06] you know he's scary basically i'll tell
