[28:34] [Music]
[28:44] day God bless
[28:47] you hear
[28:50] me my name is uh brother Steven Garcia
[28:53] or brother Steve you call me either way
[28:56] um I come from Phoenix
[28:58] Arizona I never thought that I would be
[29:01] here in this uh position that I find
[29:03] myself in
[29:04] today but um the call came here we are
[29:09] and so I just ask that you bear with me
[29:11] um let's go straight into the Scripture
[29:13] it is
[29:15] Deuteronomy 30:
[29:22] 15-6 when you have it please say Amen
[29:31] and it reads like
[29:33] this see I have set before thee this day
[29:37] life and good and death and evil in that
[29:42] I command thee this day to love the Lord
[29:44] thy God to walk in his
[29:47] ways and to keep his Commandments and
[29:49] his statutes and his judgments that thou
[29:53] mayest live and
[29:54] multiply and the Lord thy God shall
[29:57] bless thee in the land whether thou
[30:00] goest to possess it you could bow your
[30:03] heads let's
[30:06] pray Lord heavenly
[30:09] father I thank you Lord God for the opp
[30:13] opportunity to be
[30:15] here and the trust that you put in me
[30:17] Lord God to be standing before your
[30:23] children you know how I feel about being
[30:25] up here Lord you know what I think of
[30:28] myself Lord God
[30:29] but as your word says father it's time
[30:33] to die to
[30:35] self it's not about what I think it's
[30:37] about what you think it's not what I say
[30:40] it's what you
[30:42] say and so I place myself aside father
[30:44] help me to get out of the
[30:46] way help me to put myself out of the way
[30:51] and to impart whatever you would have
[30:53] for your children tonight
[30:55] Lord I Thank You and I necess that your
[30:58] children can open their hearts to
[31:00] receive whatever you have for
[31:01] them we love you Lord and we thank you
[31:04] for all these things in the name of the
[31:05] Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be
[31:15] seated so as it reads in uh verse 16 it
[31:19] says he's he set before us different
[31:23] options he says there's life and good
[31:25] and there's death and Evil
[31:28] and so today you have to make choice of
[31:30] whom you're going to
[31:31] serve right who shall you serve this day
[31:35] it's your choice today are you going to
[31:38] choose life and good or you going to
[31:39] choose death and evil and if you choose
[31:42] the life and you choose the good there's
[31:44] things that come along with it but the
[31:46] Lord says that here that he will bless
[31:48] thee in the land whether thou goest to
[31:50] possess
[31:51] it and so how are we going to possess
[31:54] this land well let's read here in Luke
[31:57] 22
[31:58] ver
[32:00] 24-27 and it says now a dispute also
[32:03] arose among them as to which of them was
[32:06] regarded to be the
[32:08] greatest Jesus said to them the kings of
[32:11] the Gentiles have absolute power and
[32:14] Lord it over them and those in authority
[32:17] over them are called
[32:19] benefactors but it is not to be this way
[32:21] with you on the contrary the one who is
[32:25] the greatest among you
[32:28] must become like the youngest and the
[32:30] leader like the
[32:33] servant for who is the greater the one
[32:35] who reclines at the table or the one who
[32:41] serves is it not the one who reclines at
[32:44] the table but I am among you the Lord
[32:47] Jesus Christ is among you as the one who
[32:52] serves so he's setting the example for
[32:55] us right there where Jesus Christ the
[32:58] God God himself come down in human flesh
[33:01] God of all glory the creator of Heaven
[33:05] and Earth the creator of everything that
[33:07] we can see and he's saying that he comes
[33:10] as the one who serves how much more
[33:13] should we as human beings be willing to
[33:17] put ourselves in the place of a servant
[33:20] and to give ourselves to serve
[33:23] others and so in Matthew 18: 1-5 I don't
[33:27] have this um I didn't give this to them
[33:29] up there but it says at that time the
[33:30] disciples came to Jesus saying who is
[33:33] the greatest in the kingdom of
[33:35] heaven and calling to him a child he put
[33:38] him in the midst of them and said truly
[33:40] I say it to you unless you turn and
[33:43] become like children you will never
[33:45] enter the Kingdom of Heaven whoever
[33:48] humbles himself like this child is the
[33:51] greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven
[33:54] whoever receives one such child in my
[33:56] name receives me
[33:59] so what he's saying here is that what
[34:01] the world calls great is actually the
[34:03] opposite in the Kingdom of Heaven A lot
[34:05] of times we think well who who's great
[34:07] oh the the the guy who's you know
[34:10] standing in front of millions of people
[34:12] maybe the president or maybe uh Jeff
[34:15] Bezos or some billionaire who they they
[34:17] have all these things that you could
[34:19] ever think of anything that we desire in
[34:22] our flesh that we would ever want these
[34:24] people have it and that's what a lot of
[34:27] people in the the world they think of as
[34:28] great well he's a great speaker he knows
[34:31] how to articulate himself and he's so
[34:33] intelligent and he has all this money
[34:36] and he has all these things that I only
[34:38] wish that I could
[34:39] have but what greatness is in the
[34:42] Kingdom of Heaven is making yourself as
[34:44] low as you can
[34:46] be it says to make yourself as a child
[34:48] and it's not to put children down saying
[34:50] that they're beneath us but it's trying
[34:52] to get us to to see a point here that
[34:55] children in nature they're free from
[34:59] in nature children are humble they're
[35:01] willing to
[35:02] learn and most of all they're willing to
[35:04] be dependent on their
[35:06] parents but as we
[35:08] grow the problem is that we get bad
[35:11] habits because we we grow up and as as
[35:15] part of becoming part of this world we
[35:18] realize that we have to go to school we
[35:21] have to go to work to be able to make a
[35:23] living these are things that we are
[35:26] unavoidable and in doing so we come in
[35:29] contact with things that we don't want
[35:31] to see we come in contact things with
[35:33] things that are not beneficial to us and
[35:35] we start picking up little bits and
[35:38] pieces here and there well look at this
[35:40] guy he has this and maybe uh if it's
[35:42] okay for him to do this well maybe I can
[35:44] do it too maybe I should uh be a little
[35:47] more uh Arrogant with my my chest out
[35:51] you know because you know that guy he
[35:52] gets all the ladies or
[35:54] something but what Jesus is telling us
[35:57] here is that we have to be humble and he
[36:00] showed us how we should become by being
[36:02] the example he didn't just say it he
[36:04] lived the
[36:06] life and ultimately what he's saying is
[36:08] we have to Humble
[36:10] self and I like to make a distinction
[36:13] that I there's there's to me there's a
[36:15] difference between self and what I like
[36:17] to call or what my pastor has taught me
[36:19] to call selfie where self is the person
[36:22] who wants to do good self is the one
[36:25] inside of you making the decisions
[36:27] trying to do what's right but selfie
[36:29] which is this guy right here which is
[36:31] the nature the old
[36:33] nature he wants to do what he wants to
[36:35] do he wants to be selfish he wants to
[36:39] take control of the situation he wants
[36:41] to take the steering wheel he wants to
[36:43] drive he doesn't want to submit to
[36:45] anybody he doesn't want to listen to
[36:47] what you have to say because he thinks
[36:48] he knows better and as sometimes it
[36:52] feels like we Peak when we're getting
[36:53] into adolescence all of a sudden we know
[36:55] better than our parents all of all of a
[36:57] sudden we know better than the people
[36:59] who are trying to help us grow as
[37:01] Christians and we think well they don't
[37:03] know what it's like they don't know
[37:05] where we're going through well as a
[37:08] witness I can tell you that I used to
[37:11] think that way I did I used to think
[37:14] that way my dad would try to help me he
[37:16] would try to give me
[37:17] advice
[37:20] and and I didn't want to take it because
[37:23] I thought I knew better well he you know
[37:26] my dad
[37:28] he doesn't know much he how does he know
[37:31] what I'm going through he doesn't know
[37:32] the thoughts that I have he doesn't know
[37:35] that I've contemplated taking my life he
[37:38] doesn't know the things that have
[37:41] happened in secret to me how does he how
[37:44] could he possibly know what I'm going
[37:46] through to give me the words that I need
[37:50] to be able to make
[37:53] it and live a a life of victory
[37:58] and so what happens is we become
[38:02] arrogant and we're not willing to Humble
[38:05] ourselves to be able to receive the word
[38:08] of God that we need to in order to grow
[38:11] as
[38:12] Christians but when we
[38:15] do allow ourselves to become humble when
[38:19] we do find the way to put self
[38:25] down then that's when God brings his
[38:28] quickening power to us and he begins to
[38:30] unite us with him and if you are taking
[38:34] uh notes that scripture would be John
[38:39] 663 and in verse
[38:41] 26 that we just
[38:43] read it says but is not to be this way
[38:46] with you on the contrary the one who is
[38:48] greatest among you must become like the
[38:50] youngest and the leader like the servant
[38:54] so there's two requirements that he's
[38:55] saying that are required to follow Jesus
[38:57] Jesus and number one is that you must
[38:59] humble yourself before God and others
[39:02] which means that you must take the low
[39:03] rank you must become Meek because to
[39:06] humble yourself it's synonymous with
[39:09] weak uh
[39:10] meekness and number two is you must be
[39:13] like a
[39:14] servant you must be one who serves a
[39:17] bond
[39:19] servant and to further understand what
[39:21] it means to Humble ourselves let's go to
[39:24] James 4:6
[39:27] and it reads like this but he gives more
[39:31] grace therefore it says and it is
[39:34] referring to he's referring to a
[39:36] scripture back in Proverbs
[39:38] 3:34 he's saying he says therefore it
[39:41] says God opposes the proud but gives
[39:44] grace to the humble and so when we begin
[39:47] to Humble ourselves it brings the God's
[39:49] quickening power to us and it begins to
[39:51] bring life to the seed that he has
[39:54] already planted in us and it begins to
[39:56] bring more Gra to us not just a little
[39:59] bit of Grace it begins to bring more
[40:01] grace and grace is unmerited favor Grace
[40:04] is joy and Delight it is God's affection
[40:07] to us and it is strength to keep going
[40:10] on in this
[40:12] journey and so when we take the lowly
[40:15] road instead of trying to take the high
[40:17] road and you know it sounds kind of
[40:19] backwards because people are always
[40:20] saying take the high road well what it's
[40:22] saying here is to take the lowly road is
[40:24] to humble yourself and not to think more
[40:27] highly of yourself than you
[40:29] are and then when you do that God will
[40:32] extend his holy influence upon you in
[40:35] your life and when that happens that is
[40:38] when you start to see the acceleration
[40:40] of the maturity of the word that you
[40:43] have received in your
[40:46] heart so we must humble ourselves daily
[40:50] and as we do so God is slowly bit by bit
[40:54] Drip by drip positioning us Within the
[40:57] body and whose body is that does anybody
[41:00] know what body is
[41:02] that
[41:04] anybody the bride amen so as we are
[41:07] humbling ourselves we are slowly Drip by
[41:10] drip bit by bit becoming more a part of
[41:13] that
[41:15] bride and where as where before we would
[41:19] have doubted ourselves we didn't think
[41:22] that we should be
[41:24] anything you we think
[41:28] these people around me they don't know
[41:30] the things that I have done they don't
[41:32] realize how sinful I am and how I've
[41:36] treated others they don't know the
[41:37] things that I even did yesterday the way
[41:40] that I treated my family the way that I
[41:43] talk to so and so I I don't deserve to
[41:45] be
[41:46] here but when we begin to Humble
[41:50] ourselves and say Lord it is not what I
[41:52] think Lord it is what you think what do
[41:55] you say that I am
[41:57] then that is when the doubt begins to
[42:00] leave and God's holy influence over us
[42:03] helps us to Humble ourselves even more
[42:07] Glory so it is based on our submission
[42:10] to God when we humble ourselves
[42:13] basically what we're doing and what we
[42:15] need to do in order to Humble ourselves
[42:17] is we need to repent of selfie okay who
[42:20] is selfie you guys that's a weird word
[42:23] that's a weird way to describe yourself
[42:24] who is selfie selfie is oh look at me oh
[42:27] let's take pictures of myself oh look
[42:29] look this is selfie right I am self I'm
[42:32] amazing you know you don't know what I
[42:33] can do well why don't they put me up
[42:35] there and I'll show what I can do that's
[42:38] what selfie is selfie is
[42:41] self-interest I well I want to do what I
[42:44] want to do I want to do I want to go and
[42:46] I want to be able to drive a Lamborghini
[42:48] because look look at so and so if he can
[42:50] do it why can't I do
[42:51] it I self-reliance how many times have
[42:54] we gotten in trouble and we instead of
[42:57] running to the Lord asking him for help
[43:01] we just oh let me just swipe it on the
[43:03] credit card because you know I have
[43:05] money I could pay for it maybe the Lord
[43:08] had a blessing for you if you would have
[43:10] just gone to him and asked him and he
[43:12] would have given it to you without you
[43:13] having to pay your own money he might
[43:17] have had a friend nearby that that was
[43:20] going to call you and and give you
[43:22] whatever it was that you had need of but
[43:25] we're so quick to just think well uh
[43:27] I'll just swipe the credit card because
[43:29] I have it I don't I don't I don't need
[43:31] anybody else I can do it
[43:34] myself we need to what we need to do is
[43:37] we need to repent of wanting to defend
[43:39] ourselves every time somebody lashes out
[43:43] at us or treats us
[43:46] unfairly and uh to understand this
[43:50] better let's go to First Peter chapter
[43:54] 2: 20- 2
[43:58] and it reads like this for what credit
[44:01] is there if when you sin and are harshly
[44:04] treated you endure it with
[44:07] patience but if when you do what is
[44:09] right and suffer for it you patiently
[44:13] endure it this finds favor with God for
[44:17] you have been called for this purpose
[44:19] since Christ also suffered for you
[44:22] leaving you an example for you to follow
[44:25] in his steps who committed no sin nor
[44:28] was any deceit found in his mouth and
[44:31] while be being reviled he did not revile
[44:34] in return amen so can you imagine he's
[44:37] over
[44:39] here getting lashed getting whipped
[44:42] getting taken from this leader to that
[44:45] leader because they were trying to find
[44:47] something to convict him of trying to
[44:49] find him guilty for something they were
[44:51] spitting in his face they were cursing
[44:54] him out calling him beab and every name
[44:56] in the book book and he could have
[44:58] opened up his mouth and he chose not to
[45:01] the very God Of Heaven chose to keep his
[45:03] mouth shut when all these
[45:05] Sinners the one person who was innocent
[45:08] in this
[45:09] world and he chose to keep his mouth
[45:12] shut and while suffering he uttered no
[45:16] threats but kept entrusting himself to
[45:18] him who judges
[45:20] righteously he was on the cross and in
[45:23] his
[45:24] suffering he didn't say well just wait
[45:27] till I get down from here and you're
[45:29] going to see you're definitely going to
[45:30] get it wait until I raise up 3 days from
[45:34] now and you're going to see what's going
[45:35] to happen to you he didn't do any of
[45:38] that but we when our
[45:41] brother whether it's Brother In the
[45:43] Flesh or brother in the spirit they say
[45:46] why didn't you do this you were supposed
[45:47] to do this you were supposed to get it
[45:48] done why didn't you take care of it and
[45:50] then immediately were what about you
[45:52] where were you I'm over here working
[45:55] working my tail off and where you been
[45:57] why'd you show up late blah blah blah
[46:00] we're so quick to defend ourselves
[46:01] instead of keeping our mouths shut and
[46:03] humbling ourselves and saying you're
[46:05] right it was my job and I should have
[46:08] done
[46:11] it and he himself bore our sins in his
[46:14] body on the cross so that we might die
[46:17] to sin and live to righteousness for by
[46:20] his wounds you were healed for you were
[46:23] continually straying like sheep but now
[46:26] you have returned turn to the shepherd
[46:27] and guardian of your
[46:30] souls and so when we begin to Humble
[46:33] ourselves we have more grace at us laded
[46:35] to us and he's saying here that we were
[46:37] straying like sheep and he came and he
[46:40] found us the shepherd the great Shepherd
[46:42] came and he found us and as sheep we're
[46:44] not supposed to drift off and do
[46:47] whatever we want as sheep we are called
[46:50] to be led by the
[46:52] shepherd and how do we do this how do we
[46:55] go and how do we take this attitude of
[46:58] humility that we're supposed to have
[47:00] what we're supposed to do is we're
[47:01] supposed to have an attitude of
[47:02] gratitude that is praising God for every
[47:05] situation that we find ourselves in no
[47:08] matter what it is and it is so hard
[47:12] especially this day and age with all the
[47:13] Temptations all the things that we have
[47:16] we have a a supercomputer right here at
[47:18] our fingertips everywhere we go and it
[47:20] gives us access to anything that you
[47:23] could possibly think of it is right
[47:25] there and to be able to have that and to
[47:29] not allow
[47:31] ourselves to get caught up in those
[47:33] things of the world it is very
[47:35] hard but we are called to praise God no
[47:39] matter what situation we find ourselves
[47:42] in it says in Romans
[47:45] 8:28 and we know that God causes all
[47:49] things to work together for good to
[47:51] those who love God to those who are
[47:54] called according to his purpose so it is
[47:56] not just the good things it is not just
[47:59] Lord thank you for this house thank you
[48:01] Lord God for this car thank you for
[48:03] healing my leg Lord God thank you for
[48:05] for giving me my my beautiful wife and
[48:07] my children father it is not just that
[48:10] it is also Lord God thank you Father for
[48:14] the flat tire and I had to wait there 20
[48:17] minutes for somebody to come help me fix
[48:18] it Lord God thank you Lord God for my
[48:22] brother who cursed me out Lord God
[48:24] outside because he was having a bad day
[48:27] and he didn't know how to handle himself
[48:28] Lord God thank you why not not because
[48:30] we want our brother to do those things
[48:32] not because we want to have to deal with
[48:34] a flat tire but because we know that
[48:35] when we endure it with patience he is
[48:39] there and he's willing to help us get
[48:41] through those days he's willing to help
[48:43] us through those moments of suffering
[48:46] and it it causes us to just fall more
[48:48] and more in love with
[48:50] him but the problem is is that when we
[48:53] find ourselves there when we find
[48:54] ourselves in the furnace of affliction
[48:57] as humans selfie all selfie wants to do
[49:00] is get out Lord why am I here Lord why
[49:04] why why do I have to deal with this flat
[49:05] tire I just dealt with the AC going out
[49:07] two weeks ago that's Lord God why why
[49:10] why why me Lord why we're in the furnace
[49:13] of Affliction and the enemy is throwing
[49:15] more and more coal in there trying to
[49:17] make it hotter and hotter and all we
[49:19] want to do is take the steering wheel
[49:21] and drive right out of there we want to
[49:24] get right out from where we are because
[49:26] it hurts hurts and nobody wants to deal
[49:28] with pain nobody wants to but part of
[49:32] the the trouble that we have is that we
[49:34] need to learn to deal with the pain and
[49:36] not just deal with it but praise the
[49:39] Lord in those times of pain because that
[49:41] is when he comes down on the scene and
[49:43] he brings you a peace that you never
[49:45] knew that you could
[49:50] have when we come with this kind of
[49:53] approach that's when you start to
[49:55] realize that you're beginning to to lead
[49:57] a Victorious Life and brother brandom
[49:59] says when you start leading that type of
[50:01] Victorious life there's nothing that can
[50:02] stand in your way can sickness stand in
[50:05] your
[50:06] way can your your job stand in your way
[50:09] can your spouse stand in your way your
[50:11] children stand in your way no the only
[50:13] thing that can stand in your way in
[50:14] those moments is self self is the one
[50:17] that begins to get in the way and and
[50:20] and starts complaining and murmuring
[50:22] about all the things that we have to
[50:24] deal with
[50:27] when we don't humble and submit what
[50:29] we're basically doing is we're removing
[50:31] God from being able to have his
[50:33] influence over our lives wow we're
[50:35] taking control of the steering wheel and
[50:37] we're basically telling God I know what
[50:39] I'm doing even though I'm in this pain
[50:42] I'm struggling I'm going to trust myself
[50:43] to get me out of this because I don't
[50:45] want to have to deal with this anymore I
[50:47] don't want to I don't want to learn the
[50:50] lesson that you have for me in this pain
[50:52] I want to just get
[50:54] out wow
[50:57] and so to understand this a little bit
[50:59] better what it means to be submissive
[51:01] and to be humble let's go to Matthew 11
[51:05] verse
[51:08] 28-30 I believe they're going to have it
[51:10] this one up
[51:14] there and it reads like this come unto
[51:17] me all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[51:20] and I will give you rest take my yoke
[51:24] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[51:27] and lowly in heart and ye shall find
[51:30] rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy
[51:34] and my burden is
[51:36] light and one of the things
[51:39] that we we struggle
[51:41] to to realize I feel at least I did
[51:44] anyway I don't know about anybody else
[51:46] but a lot of times I feel
[51:49] like when we think of being submissive
[51:51] and humble we think that we that means
[51:54] we have to bow down to other people and
[51:56] that we have to cower away when uh we're
[52:00] put into a
[52:02] confrontation but being Meek being
[52:04] submissive being humble it doesn't mean
[52:06] that we have to be silent and passive
[52:08] people because if we're going to take
[52:10] the kingdom we have to take it by
[52:13] force and if we're going to submit
[52:15] ourselves to God it says submit
[52:17] yourselves to God therefore resist the
[52:19] devil and he will flee from you how are
[52:21] you going to resist the devil if you're
[52:22] like oh no you know I'm I'm humble and
[52:24] I'm Meek just sleep leave me alone and
[52:27] uh you know everything will be good
[52:29] that's not resisting resisting means
[52:31] that you have to use God's word and you
[52:33] have to be able to use the word and tell
[52:35] him no that is not what God says you're
[52:39] sick I am not sick I'm going to resist
[52:42] you because the word says by his stripes
[52:45] I was
[52:48] healed and when we begin to do so then
[52:51] that's when he begins to flee
[52:57] and so in verse 29 I want to break it
[52:59] down just a little bit it says take my
[53:02] yoke upon
[53:04] you and yoke is it is um it is a tool
[53:08] that they use I don't know if any of you
[53:10] have ever seen one it is Yol that they
[53:12] put on ox and it is a tool that they use
[53:14] to plow the fields it is a tool that is
[53:17] used to do very strenuous work and they
[53:20] put it on Ox because they're very strong
[53:22] and you know I don't think anybody wants
[53:25] to see a human out there in the fields
[53:27] using a yoke and trying to plow the
[53:29] fields and that's why they do it to
[53:30] animals but the Lord here is telling us
[53:33] put my yoke upon
[53:35] you and he's
[53:37] saying the word yoke is synonymous with
[53:41] burden bondage and slavery so the Lord
[53:44] is calling us he's saying take my yoke
[53:47] take my burden take my yoke take my
[53:50] bondage take my slavery upon you and we
[53:53] think that's kind of strange you know
[53:55] the Lord is asking me to be a Slave
[53:57] yes he's asking you to be a love slave
[53:59] for him that's what he's calling us to
[54:02] do the yoke is put on us to bring selfie
[54:06] our self our fallen nature under
[54:08] subjection our fallen nature under
[54:11] bondage and it is a tool that is used
[54:14] for carrying heavy loads and
[54:17] burdens but the problem that we find
[54:19] ourselves in is that we're here plowing
[54:22] the fields we have the Yoke we have our
[54:24] heads down and then before you know it
[54:28] we start feeling a little pain and we're
[54:30] like ah and we're the 11th Hour workers
[54:32] right and so we're here and we're not
[54:35] alone there's other people here plowing
[54:37] the fields alongside of us but we look
[54:39] over and we
[54:41] see why why does brother so and so have
[54:44] it easier than me oh man this this this
[54:48] is super heavy and I'm getting so tired
[54:50] and I feel so weak why is his load so
[54:53] light why doesn't he have to carry the
[54:55] things that I have to
[54:57] why am why is God giving me
[54:59] this why do I have to keep struggling
[55:02] while it looks like so and so has such
[55:04] has it so easy well one of the reasons
[55:06] why it might seem like they have it so
[55:08] easy is because they have learned to
[55:10] submit themselves to god wow why they
[55:14] why it seems like it their load is so
[55:16] light and it's not as heavy as yours is
[55:18] because they've humbled themselves and
[55:20] they said Lord even though this is heavy
[55:21] even though it's hard i g i i Place
[55:24] myself in your hands you take control
[55:26] Lord and I will surrender to you and I
[55:28] will praise you no matter what and when
[55:31] we begin to do that then all of a sudden
[55:33] that heavy load which we which was so
[55:36] burdensome all of a sudden it starts to
[55:39] feel a little lighter because it's not
[55:41] you that is carrying it alone anymore
[55:43] the Lord Jesus Christ is there lifting
[55:46] it up off your
[55:50] shoulders and one of the things that we
[55:52] don't realize is that when we're here in
[55:54] the furnace of Affliction what God is
[55:56] doing is that he is testing us he's
[55:58] testing us to see what our attitude is
[56:01] going to be in those times of Affliction
[56:03] are we going to praise him are we going
[56:05] to thank him no matter what or are we
[56:07] going to murmur and complain and ask why
[56:10] why me why me why do I have to go
[56:12] through this and one of the things that
[56:15] I realized and it it it came to a
[56:18] breaking point for me was about a month
[56:23] ago July 13th on on a Friday Friday the
[56:26] 13th funny
[56:28] enough
[56:32] um one of the most um hard struggles
[56:36] that I ever had to go through happened
[56:38] to me and my my wife and my
[56:42] family um we uh we received some
[56:45] emergency news that my wife she was
[56:47] pregnant at the time and she wasn't
[56:49] doing too
[56:51] good
[56:53] and we went to see the doctor and the
[56:56] doctor doctor said based on some of the
[56:58] images that we're seeing and
[57:00] uh and the the way that the symptoms
[57:04] that you're
[57:05] presenting we want you to go see this
[57:08] specialist in in
[57:09] Colorado and I'm from Arizona and so you
[57:12] know it's not just it's not like I can
[57:14] just upend my life and just drive to
[57:17] Colorado and uh and we're like okay like
[57:21] okay so so what's the plan he's like you
[57:23] know yeah we want you to go see him
[57:24] tomorrow tomorrow like what do you mean
[57:26] tomorrow I have to work you know what I
[57:28] mean I have a life what do you mean you
[57:30] you want going to just go he's like but
[57:31] what you don't realize is that this is
[57:34] this is BAS potentially life and
[57:37] death and if you want your baby to have
[57:39] a chance to survive we need you to go to
[57:43] Colorado and so I'm very grateful that
[57:48] there are programs out there to help
[57:50] people who may or may not be in the most
[57:54] strong of financial situations
[57:56] and they had programs to help us and
[57:58] they flew us out there free of charge
[58:00] they put us up in a
[58:02] hotel and we were able to go over
[58:05] there and see the specialist that they
[58:07] had
[58:08] there and a long story short I don't
[58:10] want to take up too much time on the
[58:12] story but we get there and they run all
[58:15] the new test themselves to see how she
[58:17] my wife is progressing how the baby's
[58:19] progressing
[58:21] and they tell us that this is a case
[58:24] like they had never seen before
[58:26] and it it was a one in a million
[58:30] cases and um they said your baby isn't
[58:34] doing too well they started see swelling
[58:36] around her brain they thought that she
[58:38] might have
[58:40] um she might have some permanent brain
[58:43] damage and her organs and her lungs were
[58:46] getting pushed up against her rib cage
[58:48] and so her heart wasn't able to pump
[58:51] like it
[58:54] should and so um
[58:56] there was she wasn't getting enough
[58:57] blood to all her extremities and her
[58:59] brain and that's why there was swelling
[59:01] everywhere and my wife ended up
[59:04] presenting symptoms that were similar
[59:05] because it was her body trying to
[59:07] counteract what the baby was going
[59:09] through and so she started feeling those
[59:10] symptoms herself she started getting
[59:13] swollen and they said based on the
[59:15] baby's condition and based on your
[59:18] condition we're recommending that we do
[59:19] an emergency
[59:21] delivery and we want to prepare you
[59:24] ahead of time that we don't think the
[59:25] baby is going to make
[59:27] it they they said with the baby symptoms
[59:32] alone I think they gave they gave the
[59:34] baby about a 133% chance of living and
[59:37] they said but with your symptoms
[59:39] included they said we just want to
[59:42] prepare you for the
[59:45] worst and so we we called upon the Lord
[59:49] and we said
[59:52] Lord we know that you are a miracle
[59:54] worker
[59:56] we know that you can take control of any
[59:59] situation there's nothing that is
[1:00:00] impossible for you so we place it in his
[1:00:04] hands and we talked to our pastor and he
[1:00:06] said whatever they recommend if this is
[1:00:09] how the baby is supposed to come then
[1:00:11] this is how she's going to come and for
[1:00:13] those who don't know I have three
[1:00:15] beautiful boys over there and I had been
[1:00:19] asking for a
[1:00:20] girl and so to me this was God he uh we
[1:00:24] prayed about it we asked our pastor can
[1:00:27] you please pray that we would have a
[1:00:28] girl and when we finally got the results
[1:00:32] of of the gender of the baby it was she
[1:00:34] was a girl and so I was so excited to
[1:00:38] finally have a
[1:00:40] girl and I kept thinking in my mind Lord
[1:00:44] like there's no way that you would give
[1:00:45] me this girl just take her away like it
[1:00:48] just doesn't make sense like I don't see
[1:00:50] how you would grant me my my desire just
[1:00:54] to take it away just to take her
[1:00:58] away but as they went through the
[1:01:00] process of the delivery my wife began
[1:01:02] having more and more
[1:01:04] complications and they went and they
[1:01:07] took her to the uh the
[1:01:10] ER and I was in the waiting room just
[1:01:12] waiting the results waiting for them to
[1:01:14] come and tell me what happened because
[1:01:16] they didn't allow me to go see
[1:01:17] her and in those
[1:01:20] times when when the heat in the furnace
[1:01:23] is turned up all the way
[1:01:26] that's when you find out what you're
[1:01:27] really made
[1:01:28] of and I I must admit that there were
[1:01:32] times where I broke
[1:01:35] down and I I just kept telling the Lord
[1:01:39] Lord like I I trust you and and I love
[1:01:42] you but I'm here Lord God and I'm
[1:01:44] stressing Lord God because they said
[1:01:45] that my wife was having having
[1:01:47] complications let alone my baby please
[1:01:50] don't take my my child away please don't
[1:01:53] take my wife away from me
[1:01:56] and I was stressed out because she was
[1:01:57] losing a lot of
[1:01:59] blood but I ultimately I said Lord I
[1:02:03] said it's in your hands I said you give
[1:02:06] and you take away if it is your desire
[1:02:09] that I have to go through this that you
[1:02:11] have to take my baby then that's what
[1:02:13] I'll have to do if you have to take my
[1:02:15] wife I don't know how I'm going to make
[1:02:17] it I have three boys that she takes care
[1:02:19] of all day every day I don't know how
[1:02:22] I'm going to do it but if that's what
[1:02:25] you want for me
[1:02:27] then I know that you'll make a
[1:02:30] way and the baby ended up not making
[1:02:37] it I don't know what happened I don't
[1:02:39] know the exact reason they told us that
[1:02:42] we could do an autopsy but I didn't I
[1:02:44] didn't want to I didn't want to know it
[1:02:46] wasn't going to change anything my baby
[1:02:48] was
[1:02:49] gone but what brought me
[1:02:52] consolation was that people called me he
[1:02:55] people who had already been in the
[1:02:57] furnace of Affliction people who had
[1:02:59] been
[1:03:00] there they called me and said brother we
[1:03:03] know what you're going through because
[1:03:04] we've been through the same
[1:03:06] thing and so sometimes we think that we
[1:03:09] don't understand why we're going through
[1:03:11] something we don't understand why we're
[1:03:15] going through this this pain and this
[1:03:17] suffering but a lot of times it's so
[1:03:19] that we can help somebody else when they
[1:03:21] get there where we're
[1:03:23] at amen
[1:03:26] and so I just said Lord God I thank you
[1:03:28] Lord God all I can do is thank you for
[1:03:32] bringing my wife out
[1:03:34] safe she had no issues the surgery went
[1:03:38] perfectly according to plan on her
[1:03:42] end and if this if all you had to do was
[1:03:45] have me go to this so that I can help
[1:03:47] somebody further on down the road Lord
[1:03:49] and so be it and I don't say this to
[1:03:52] bring any praise Or Glory to myself
[1:03:54] because like I said I stro so much and I
[1:03:56] still have questions of why I don't
[1:03:59] completely
[1:04:01] understand but regardless of the why
[1:04:04] regardless of how I feel about
[1:04:06] it I must tell the Lord you are
[1:04:10] sovereign you make the choices that you
[1:04:13] want to make whether I understand it or
[1:04:15] not whether I would do the same in your
[1:04:18] position or not not that we can be in
[1:04:20] his position but a lot of times we think
[1:04:22] well if you know if it was up to me I
[1:04:24] would have done it this way
[1:04:26] well it's not up to us God can do
[1:04:28] whatever he wants and so I just have to
[1:04:31] thank him and praise him that I do have
[1:04:34] three healthy boys there that I do have
[1:04:37] a wife that I do have this beautiful
[1:04:39] life that he's given me that I am
[1:04:41] healthy that my family is healthy and
[1:04:44] that he has saved me from my sins
[1:04:58] am so Christ's yoke it's a way of life
[1:05:01] of a servant totally yielded before God
[1:05:04] and others and his way of life is a yoke
[1:05:08] of servanthood so we're called to be
[1:05:10] servants and it requires that we yield
[1:05:13] and ourselves yield ourselves and humble
[1:05:15] ourselves before
[1:05:18] God and now we go to the word
[1:05:22] meekness where he says I am meek and lo
[1:05:25] in
[1:05:27] heart and what he beans means by
[1:05:29] meekness we find here in the Greek
[1:05:31] Lexicon strongs number
[1:05:34] 4239 and it says meekness towards God is
[1:05:38] that disposition of spirit in we in
[1:05:40] which we accept his dealings with us as
[1:05:42] good Romans 8:28 again
[1:05:46] regardless of what his dealings are with
[1:05:49] us we must regard them as
[1:05:51] good and therefore without disputing or
[1:05:55] resisting
[1:05:56] without complaining without
[1:05:59] murmuring in the Old Testament the meek
[1:06:01] are those wholly relying on God rather
[1:06:04] than their own strength to defend
[1:06:06] themselves against
[1:06:07] Injustice because what happens when we
[1:06:10] when we go through an injustice
[1:06:12] where we didn't deserve to be treated a
[1:06:15] certain way selfie wants to immediately
[1:06:17] outrage like how dare you treat me like
[1:06:20] this when I did nothing wrong imagine
[1:06:23] you're at
[1:06:24] home imagine you're at home and you took
[1:06:28] it upon yourself to take the Yoke of
[1:06:30] Christ upon you and so you said what
[1:06:32] what can be done around here what work
[1:06:33] can be done I'm going to help my brother
[1:06:35] my sister I'm going to help my mom I'm
[1:06:36] going to help my dad I'm going to clean
[1:06:38] the dishes and I'm going to clean this
[1:06:39] whole kitchen and then afterwards then
[1:06:42] I'm going to reward myself with a bowl
[1:06:43] of cereal okay I don't anybody like
[1:06:46] cereal yeah okay so you're I'm going to
[1:06:49] reward myself with a bowl of cereal
[1:06:52] after I do all this work so you go you
[1:06:54] do all this work
[1:06:56] you clean up the kitchen you make
[1:06:58] yourself a bowl of cereal you sit down
[1:07:00] and you put the milk back like you're
[1:07:02] supposed to right I don't know about any
[1:07:04] of you but we don't like milk being left
[1:07:05] out outside in our house okay because
[1:07:08] then it can go
[1:07:09] bad and then comes along your sibling or
[1:07:12] whoever else somebody else comes along
[1:07:14] you've already cleaned the kitchen they
[1:07:15] were nowhere to be found but once it's
[1:07:17] clean all of a sudden people come out of
[1:07:19] the woodwor they come into the kitchen
[1:07:22] and they go and like oh they see you
[1:07:23] eating a bowl of cereal I'm going to get
[1:07:24] some too they go they pour themselves a
[1:07:26] bowl of cereal they grab the milk they
[1:07:30] they pour the milk and they leave it
[1:07:32] there on the counter they walk away and
[1:07:33] they go to their room
[1:07:36] okay has that happened to anybody maybe
[1:07:39] maybe not okay then all of a sudden mom
[1:07:42] and dad comes home from work because
[1:07:44] it's a Saturday you're you're there
[1:07:46] sitting at the table not on the couch
[1:07:48] like you're told not to you're on the
[1:07:50] table because that's where they want you
[1:07:51] to
[1:07:52] eat and you're watching cartoons
[1:07:54] whatever you do on Saturday I don't know
[1:07:56] what you do and then your mom and dad
[1:07:58] comes home they see you eating the
[1:08:00] cereal and they see the milk right there
[1:08:02] on the
[1:08:04] counter and they go and they go how many
[1:08:07] times have I told you to put the milk in
[1:08:10] the fridge after you're done using
[1:08:13] it who is there who is going to sit
[1:08:17] there and just take it how many of us is
[1:08:20] just going to sit there and say you're
[1:08:22] right I'm sorry I'll take care of the
[1:08:25] milk next time how many of us would be
[1:08:28] the first one to be like what are you
[1:08:29] talking about Joseph left that out there
[1:08:32] on the counter how dare you obviously we
[1:08:34] wouldn't talk to our parents like that
[1:08:36] but inside right that is what but that's
[1:08:39] how we would be feeling that's what we
[1:08:41] would want to say what do you mean
[1:08:42] Joseph let that that wasn't me and
[1:08:44] immediately it's we want to jump to
[1:08:46] defend
[1:08:48] ourselves but here is saying meekness
[1:08:50] towards evil people means knowing god is
[1:08:53] permitting the injuries they inflict and
[1:08:55] that he is using them to purify his
[1:08:59] elect and that he will deliver his elect
[1:09:03] in his
[1:09:06] time so what you could have done is you
[1:09:09] could have just sat there said yes okay
[1:09:13] I'll take care of it because if Johnny
[1:09:15] doesn't bring in the wood what are we
[1:09:16] supposed to do we're supposed to bring
[1:09:18] in the wood so if your brother and
[1:09:20] sister left maybe you could have said
[1:09:23] hey can you put the milk away and they
[1:09:25] whatever and they just walk away and
[1:09:27] they leave it there because they know
[1:09:29] what type of Christian you are and they
[1:09:31] know that you're going to take care of
[1:09:33] it no matter what you go over there
[1:09:36] humbly as a servant of the Lord you go
[1:09:40] you grab the milk and you put it away
[1:09:43] even after your parents already scolded
[1:09:45] you because you know that in due time
[1:09:49] the truth will come out or maybe it
[1:09:51] won't come out but God is going to
[1:09:53] deliver you from the Affliction and the
[1:09:56] pain that you're feeling and we know
[1:09:58] that all things work together for the
[1:10:00] good and what we don't realize is that a
[1:10:03] lot of times the pain and the suffering
[1:10:05] is going to come from our very own loved
[1:10:07] ones it's not it's not yes every so
[1:10:10] often we'll be driving around and
[1:10:11] somebody will give you the bird or
[1:10:13] whatever it is and yeah you're they're
[1:10:15] just treating you like trash when you're
[1:10:16] driving down the street but most of the
[1:10:18] time it's going to be the ones that it
[1:10:20] would hurt from the most the people who
[1:10:22] you love the most your brother who
[1:10:25] treats you like you're the scum of the
[1:10:27] earth for doing nothing but being a good
[1:10:31] boy a good girl because all you want to
[1:10:34] do is serve the Lord like man dude
[1:10:36] you're so lame dude like like you can't
[1:10:39] just give it a rest like we're here at
[1:10:41] home D you don't got to put on that fake
[1:10:42] face anymore you don't got to put on
[1:10:44] that fake attitude like what are you
[1:10:46] what are you trying to prove we're here
[1:10:48] at home dude just relax chill
[1:10:51] out and it's in those times of
[1:10:53] Affliction that we need to lean on the
[1:10:55] Lord even more and say Lord God thank
[1:10:57] you Lord God I thank you Father and I
[1:11:00] trust in you and I'm going to put all my
[1:11:03] pain Lord God everything that I'm going
[1:11:05] through Lord God I'm going to put it on
[1:11:06] your shoulders Lord because I know Lord
[1:11:09] God that you're going to help me raise
[1:11:11] this yoke Lord God and you're going to
[1:11:13] make my burden just a little bit
[1:11:16] easier and what we're doing when we're
[1:11:18] carrying that yoke when we're carrying
[1:11:20] that burden willingly humbly what we're
[1:11:23] doing is we're taking steps and each
[1:11:26] footsteps is possession yes we're
[1:11:29] possessing the land that the Lord God
[1:11:31] has promised us you want to be filled
[1:11:33] with the Holy Ghost we have to Humble
[1:11:35] ourselves and take step by step through
[1:11:38] the furnace of Affliction through the
[1:11:40] oil press we have to take step by step
[1:11:43] and it's going to be painful it is going
[1:11:46] to
[1:11:47] hurt but let me tell you the Lord God
[1:11:50] right here
[1:11:53] says in verse 28
[1:11:55] that we just read come unto me all ye
[1:11:58] that labor and are heavy laden and I
[1:12:01] will give you
[1:12:02] rest and so if you are feeling heavy
[1:12:05] laden today if you feel like the Lord
[1:12:08] like like the Lord isn't hearing you he
[1:12:11] hasn't heard your prayer in I don't know
[1:12:12] how long maybe we haven't even prayed in
[1:12:15] so long because we don't feel like the
[1:12:18] Lord hears our prayer maybe the Lord God
[1:12:22] is just waiting for you maybe he's
[1:12:24] waiting for for us to Humble ourselves
[1:12:26] so that he can answer our
[1:12:28] prayers humble yourself and say Lord God
[1:12:31] I don't know why I'm going through this
[1:12:32] Lord God but I'm going to trust you no
[1:12:35] matter what Lord I'm going to put myself
[1:12:37] in your in your hands Lord God and I'm
[1:12:39] going to stop taking control of the
[1:12:40] steering wheel Lord God because it has
[1:12:42] left me to nothing but death and Chaos
[1:12:45] pain and destruction and misery and I'm
[1:12:48] here now Lord God and all I want to do
[1:12:50] is have my life end Lord God because of
[1:12:53] all this struggles that I'm going
[1:12:55] through nobody seems to understand my
[1:12:57] brother he doesn't even know my parents
[1:13:00] they don't know what I'm going through
[1:13:01] Lord God but in my misery Lord I come to
[1:13:04] you Lord God because your word says come
[1:13:06] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[1:13:09] laden and I will give you rest so father
[1:13:12] I will surrender myself to you now Lord
[1:13:15] and I will give my heart to you Lord and
[1:13:18] I know Lord God that in due time if I
[1:13:20] humble myself enough to you that you are
[1:13:23] going to give me the rest that i s so
[1:13:26] long for Lord
[1:13:28] Jesus and so I'm going to read this
[1:13:30] quote to
[1:13:34] close it is a a
[1:13:37] prisoner
[1:13:39] 1963 July
[1:13:42] 17th and brother brandham says I wonder
[1:13:44] tonight with our heads bowed and if you
[1:13:46] could bow your heads and just listen to
[1:13:49] this
[1:13:50] quote if that ambition that we have of
[1:13:53] being something else or maybe of
[1:13:56] something that we might think be a
[1:13:58] selfish thing wonder if we couldn't just
[1:14:01] lay that aside I wonder if some young
[1:14:04] boy here tonight look around and say I'm
[1:14:06] going to be this and I'm going to when I
[1:14:08] get big I'm going to be a certain
[1:14:10] certain
[1:14:11] thing I wonder if you could feel the
[1:14:13] will of God move in your life and say no
[1:14:16] no uh-uh my ambitions are lost now for
[1:14:20] the last few days maybe the last few
[1:14:22] weeks maybe the last few months you've
[1:14:24] been feeling so much pain and Agony but
[1:14:27] you've been feeling that the Lord and
[1:14:29] the Holy Spirit has been speaking to you
[1:14:31] you're just going to say Lord I want to
[1:14:33] yield myself to God to be a thrashing
[1:14:36] instrument in this last day some young
[1:14:38] girl that might have Ambitions of a fine
[1:14:41] lady character or maybe a pretty little
[1:14:43] M maybe someday make Hollywood your
[1:14:46] career I wonder if you're not willing
[1:14:49] now to submit your ambition in the
[1:14:51] presence of God and his word to hear the
[1:14:53] call of God in your own life life God
[1:14:56] knows who you
[1:14:58] are and this afternoon God knows who you
[1:15:01] are that is
[1:15:02] struggling he knows who you are whether
[1:15:05] you think that he knows you or not he
[1:15:08] knows what you're going
[1:15:10] through and whether you think so or not
[1:15:13] he's reaching out to you and he's saying
[1:15:14] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[1:15:17] heavy laden and I will give you rest and
[1:15:19] if you've never felt that rest if you've
[1:15:22] never felt the peace that passes all
[1:15:24] understanding
[1:15:25] Just Surrender yourself and humble
[1:15:28] yourself before him and say Lord I'm
[1:15:30] going to stop doing things the way that
[1:15:32] I think I'm going to stop doing things
[1:15:33] my way I'm going to follow the leading
[1:15:37] of my
[1:15:38] shepherd I'm going to follow the leading
[1:15:41] of my pastor and I'm going to start to
[1:15:42] take the things that he says then I'm
[1:15:43] going to start to apply them into my
[1:15:45] lifej and I'm going to start to come to
