thank you this is the the office we are setting up here here and this is where we will be doing the translation work into the Acholi language and this is the office [Music] for all of you brothers that are here when we ask the Lord some time back what he would more he would have us do for his kingdom and the Lord says don't forget Africa and about that time I received an email but we believe that there was a divine plan there is a divine plan and that one got ahead knowing the about a call from before the foundation of the world in essence he knew that we would be sitting here this and to do a work I believe that we have come for for one reason and that's to do our part to help find that new bride part of the bride of Jesus Christ that is included in Uganda India Jordan and Dave and so we are very happy to be here for all of the other homes again this is brother Cole Coxon where the home console excellent yeah he contacted us we talked back more we send some Bibles to him to the church and and after that we came down with me and we began to talk about the translation work and that translation of course into the into the language of archery and so brother brother Thaksin here he did tell us about teach us a little bit of a but so we want to before we go any farther we wanted to first of all have brother brother beau Constance a few words to the people back home what everybody feels in his heart concerning the office that the Lord has provided for us to do the work and so the constant [Music] [Music] granted you permission for the wait coming to Uganda this is our D is concerned I contacted long time ago around 2005 we then accepted to send us some Bibles then we we received about 130 Bibles which we distributed to never judges or my sister's asses as our me as a believer of this entire message of this name I felt in my heart of us the English very well so I started to request Indian that is so he accepted to support the translation and fortunately impossibly and it had all program then I contacted again and I told him that there is a need of translation of the basis in actually language because also believers in this land do not understand English so he replied positively then he organized a day to come and meet us to me it is it was a opportunity for them to come and confirm that there are believers in this land that's why we came to talk to us a last time and they confirm it then we agreed that the translation should be started to hear so this is not my my my my my my plan I see it is a carnival this is not for my own benefit [Music] which is my I gratitude to a sentient and also the entire universe seven of the SATA he Church of cross because we have accepted to support us in this one we may call blessed in so Gracie [Music] a man amen and we want to - we want to also let you all know that brother brother Tito he is the pastor of the church in Fort Collins Colorado and along with him in his church if they are they have been a great help and try to name any books to bring things for the children so we want you all to know who are the people visit you man and the church they're calling out that is helping in this process then we have a brother Livingston now to me the beautiful thing is that brother brother Thaksin goes to brother Joel fries church yes yeah Joe three mother then he singles to brother Roberts church and then brother brother bozhil is a pastor of a church yeah and the beautiful thing is that that God is working amen to the churches together and it may be just problems but it's trouble is everywhere but it's endeavor e that means to make an effort to keep the unity of the spirit and so we say a few words really today was I was expecting a numbers of unites I never knew that you you
