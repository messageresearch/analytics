get started here real quick in Romans 6 10 repeats Romano says yes it says for in that he died he died unto sin once I'm gonna finish right there you may be serious may God bless his word because we know we know the theme is the the day I died you know you know when when when somebody or a family member passes away they they under under gravestone it has the day they were born but then it also has the day they died but how many remember the day you died do I remember the day I died you know there was a day I had to die and I was a young person at one time and I got baptized and I thought I was doing really well I was doing I was doing really good is got married I was 19 years old and I thought I had it all I thought I had it made I thought I could do whatever I wanted but then how many US of us have young friends that that are from the world see because when we die We Gotta Die daily tried once Jesus but we gotta die out daily this flesh has Gotta Die Out daily but I thought I was I was okay to have friends in the world Amigos so I was working I meet a couple of guys and I I thought I was strong if your tickets but this this this flesh didn't want to die he still wanted to partake of the world but if we don't die out to the world then then what are we going to do I was pulling they were pulling me then then I should have been pulling them you can't have your cake no nobody else no place to pastel and eat it too you can't you've got to be a separate people this evening now we're going to talk to people yes because because in in in First Corinthians in 1533 I just added that Ronnie I'm sorry but it says be not deceived this is evil Communications corrupt good manners no it is conversations evil Communications what are evil Communications it's something that the devil doesn't want you to do is he doesn't want you to serve the Lord he doesn't want you to know your purpose in life so in saying all this is but the day I died and my wife can remember this I was out doing the things that I was doing and I believe he told brother Mike our founding pastors he said if he keeps it up sister Rachel would be the youngest Widow in Grant County uh that does not shake you see coming from the word it's the word of the Lord said get your act together at least that's it you're gonna die well that's the day I died I surrendered my heart that's why we gotta Die daily foreign and what I'm trying to say is us as Christians young men young young ladies even some of the older ones we think we're doing good and we can keep Communications with with the friends we used to hang out with you know we may think we're strong but a little too much of that we'll pull you a little too much over there and a little too much over there and a little too much over there and a little too much before you know it there's a big gap but now it's time to start getting back start getting back start getting back because we are Sons and Daughters of God this evening we are children of the Kings and we gotta conduct ourselves bendiga [Applause] amen sister Rebecca Rodriguez where is where are you sister hey amen brother Daniel there yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah God bless you brother

he don't just answer you it's quickly he answers us Amen brother brother Julian come and tell us what God has done for you you know these men are telling you how they died and how their light got lit foreign [Music] foreign chapter 18. verse of internal verse 21. the word of God says you don't have it First Kings 18 21. you say yes samientos series came into all the people and said how long how to be between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but a bill then follow him and the people answered him not a word chapter 1 verse 16. foreign thy people shall be my people and thy God my God how many how much time will you hold between two opinions I believe many times that's where we fail is sometimes you're trying to serve God and at the same time we're trying to entertain this body we focused in on the terrestrial things no matter where you are important whatever it is if you die in Christ will bring you to him bring you with however it is God will bring you with Christ when he comes many times we blame it in the circumstances patience please sometimes as young people we want to blame different things or different people um we look we try to come up with an excuse me my dad he didn't raise me in the right way always my mother or my father didn't take care of me right they didn't teach me how to pray familiar they didn't have that family altar excuses once and again I know I want you to know that God doesn't look at you it's like something like your father your mother like any person in him he doesn't look at you like it's just a little child your decision is your decision with God all right you see if if your your opinion your decision of Christ is dropping you on to a decision you say well if I walk up to the altar to the altar you see you're coming that's good but brethren Hermanos did you realize when you raise up your hands you started break every scientific luxuries in Deepika Your Hand by nature to to man Opera Naturally by gravitation to hang down if you raise your hand it shows there is a supernatural being in you is able to defy the loss of nature Las Vegas naturales to raise your hands towards your creator something in your heart made a decision God sees you raising your hands just the same as he sees you at the altar he is exactly right if you mean it is Veronica you can't be halfway you don't know a medius you've got to mean it is I would like to share with you just a small testimonies maybe I haven't said it before but maybe some have heard it maybe not um want to install ing when I was young like some of the young people that are here today I found myself in a situation trying to please God that in a way I was way off a certain opportunity was presented to me I said Lord my life to come to church um here is here is a lovely thing as you serve one another you are serving God is the love of God is in every Christian's heart and we can find and be and be kind to another he said forgive one another if you don't see the scriptures so if you see scriptures just alike is when you believe anyhow and pray for the other persona just love one another you will find there is no greater evidence of a Christian in the world than love much questions going back to my history and my testimony is I made that decision deals is God did some tremendous miracles uh you make it in the history the story is short who knows messes this place a few months afterwards Jr brother Tommy Jr was preaching Phoenix Arizona November in November in Phoenix in 1992 is God confirmed his word to me or mistake but always be absolutely sure where your absolute is okay foreign foreign accepted by his worth God bless you amen and sister Elizabeth would you come and sing here to the Lord how many love the Lord Jesus tell somebody something nice like they smell good or something like that William Money God bless you I asked my daddy to help me because when I seen this song since I got to this church just don't have the boys but

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] says [Music] [Music] foreign again [Music] [Music] be for you that don't know Spanish just a closer walk with you oh great did Jesus is my place [Music] daily walking close [Music] Let It Be I'm going to introduce to you I am going to introduce to you a man unhombre that has become one of the greatest success stories you'll ever find he's an ex-gang banger now he's the treasurer of our church [Applause] you can do a little bit better than that this is what Jesus Christ does [Applause] wow he just set the bar up really high right now that's what he does that's my big brother right yes yes he don't let me slacks mine is stand Ard is in Corinthians second Corinthians chapter 6 16. this he says thank you and what agreement hath the temple of God with the idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people amen thank you you know the Lord has really been using that scripture with me in my life personally yes for the last two years and it has really he's brought to my attention that this flesh loves to blame everything and everybody likes to make excuses excuse us and I he he showed me he told me I need to start looking at myself it is and really really studying myself my behaviors would I start thinking for whatever reason the [Music] my reaction to somebody when somebody does something wrong to me and and I've really took in a really good look at those things and and it's going to be different for all of us how many know that God knows why you have the nature you have he knows how many of you want to know what he knows amen because once we once we know that then we're able to conquer this flesh is this place just loves to be it loves to be in this world I mean it doesn't want to leave and there's a reason why he loves it we know during the fall that the flesh was cursedita and everything in this world I mean every day I don't care how long you've been reading your Bible hearing the messages I've heard it from people that have been in church all their lives it's not just but every day you think you're getting over something and he let your guard down and then you walk by something that's so tempting and you stop and you're like it looks pretty tempting now Brother Jimmy's the man uh nobody but he could be a tablet he could be something that we're not supposed to be watching yeah he could be a little thought of Revenge not that brother Jimmy is that yeah but you know these these things is caused me to really check myself and one of the biggest things that he brought to my attention and he he kept saying it do you trust me um do you trust me confused with me and every time I would answer yes and this went on for days and then finally he gave me the Revelation revelation about maybe getting offended at everything and everybody else because like the scripture says that we just read what business do we have paying attention to anything else for him but instead he tells us to do something and then let's say he tells brother Jimmy to yeah to put on a green sweater um maybe maybe uh nothing bad another model but maybe maybe his maybe his wife says Nah put that blue one that's just an example but he was he was showing me this and he said he's telling me he listened to everything that that isn't of me it was It was kind of rough because yeah you know I just want to serve you I love you I just asked to be focused on you all day long yeah my heart was in the right place but instead of paying attention just to him I start to worry about my feelings I start to worry about this or that is don't you trust me and so I had to get it right how to say yeah I do trust you and as ridiculous or as outlandish as some things might seem for me to do foreign I do them now and you know what I have no regret you know things because he I've learned to just submit myself surrender myself and and every day it's it's it's you're living you're dying is like I said I don't care how long you've been listening messages or no important I mean every day you just gotta submit yourself and you got to watch every step that you're making but um pero there was a there was a couple so one of one of the other biggest things you know when the day that I that he called me out I was in the back of a cop car yes he showed me who he was I kept my word I didn't know how to serve them and I served them for the rest of I told him I'll serve you for the rest of my life and yeah just show me that your room and he did and you know like for all of us as that starts to go yeah and that start that process starts to happen yes there's the enemy is foreign and and I've I've come to I've come to realize that I shouldn't be discouraged when that enemy tries to bring those things up you know foreign that was that was this flesh that was this world and when he called me out by my real name and he brought the real me out there's no need for me to get discouraged about those things but amen I am in God bless you [Applause] I told you it was going to be good then I tell you that's what God does [Music] foreign [Music] hey he stood to defend his inheritance for many years [Music] [Music] to my sword in the name of the Lord I will trust in his words [Music] for many years the enemies kept us from the promised land down took away the god-given joy of our Salvation believe in us nothing like a child of a king in slavery but this day I stand to defend myself [Music] [Applause] I will I will let the enemies [Music] salvation is minus it's mine and my healing is mine yes it's my and my family is mine yes they're mine for the promise is mine yes it's mine every blessing is mine yes it's mine oh Redemption is my yes it's my restoration is and I will not let the enemies [Music] so in the name of Jesus here I come foreign [Applause] and her and brother John are going to be new parents we're going to ask you to stand real quick the chorus of what a mighty God we serve just to kind of get you get you maybe your hands uh limber up a little bit foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] on you What a Mighty God we're gonna ask brother Enrique to come and give us the words of Life we've been blessed to have the brother here with us with us [Music] we love Angels before noches good evening you may be seated brethren uh the the theme is the day that I died but uh foreign it was based on the decision because when we are born in this world we will have a lot of opportunities in in the meantime the way you grow is and your life starts exploring things then you start to find out that you are a sinner and you come to the time that you have to make a decision you're going to continue to sin or not that's your decision I'm going to read something that the prophet of God read said here and it's in the the message of Revelation is I I brought my guitar up because I'm going to sing a song after I finish starting to play the guitar well I started liking it but everything is to the honor and glory of the Lord Jesus the prophet of God says disabian says look here notice Ruth Ruth deciding she had to decide whether she was going to go or not go uh I believe this week when the services started boy honorable you automatically thought I'm going to go or I'm not going to go and so you had to make a decision and then I said every day I'm gonna dress beautifully look nice as the time that they gave us the program because those are things that just you see it once a year and we should we should take advantage of it the maximum Advantage she had to decide whether she was going to go or not and that's what every believer has to do you have to leave everything of the past everything told us everything if you're not willing to leave everything in the past and that's what would happen with me but your conscience will not lie to you she will tell you you still have not died you you yourself don't wait for the preacher to tell us about me you know if you're dead or alive the prophet of God says one has to leave all the things of the pastas leave all the things of the previous life and live all of the world yes and that's not that's what I did not want to do because while you are attending church you read your Bible you sing of the things of the life in the past then you become a formal Christian and you think you're you're believing that you are fulfilling a requirement and everything's all right you have to leave the places of the previous life to cross into a new land it's difficult because I say it on my behalf okay I love soccer football Irma oh brother I couldn't even see a ball a soccer ball and they never I was at intenses when you find yourself in that condition to oh you're us a um I I would even go to the Billiards yes and and that was agreeable I loved it but me in my mind I knew that I had to leave that alone that's fussy it's not easy the prophet of God just says to leave the things of the other life previous life and to cross over into a new land yes and that's what one does not want to do because one does not know who you'll find yourself with because when I took the decision to the United States I said I don't want to go but when you make a decision under the inspiration of God that should produce fruit in your life that one has never known foreign the way you became when you became a Christian you left the Billiards cuentos how many know what a billiard is you assisted it didn't you oh yeah I I hope that you still and the nightclubs I I never went to those you have to get to with the people that it looked like they suffered with attacks because brother this is a new life this is a different life because they would shake and they would cry they would shake their head and they would jump and for you they look like they were crazy but you had to make a decision if you were going to go or not correctly again you knew when you were going to make that step that your own people would make fun of you that you left behind automatically because things because those are because that's the case of it uh conclusion coming to that conclusion I made that decision you know that when you come to that corner because you have done one thing or the other you have sinned enough you feel Miserables and the only thing that you want to do is die because that's what the devil wants you to do but that's it there when you make that decision is that's not gonna obligate you this is waiting for you to make that decision okay I knew the Bible Prophet I had heard the prophet that's not enough because the prophet says that this message would not have any effect if there's no one to receive it it's the most difficult thing that you may do is that's when you have to surrender to God fully all your heart is you have to promise God for the rest of your life and that is something that will accompany you all your days that's why I've only read a man that about a man I read about a man that after he died [Music] that his Fame has now started this is that's our Lord Jesus Christ when he was here the whole world rejected him has been glorified because of that Grace I want to sing a song I pray that it'll be benefit to you thank you my brother [Applause] foreign [Music] actually [Music] uh the songs that help me a lot because I wanted to be amongst the people that that are on the other side the Heavenly chorus I don't know if you know it for me it has been a great help [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] my name is [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you soon [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] energy is [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you thank you brother warumo and thank the group wow that was a beautiful song I was I was looking at the I was looking at the little girl back there that man what a worship machine I I don't know if she's she's Isaac and Valerie this Mr Destiny and Mariah you you just get comfortable tonight just first and Abby and Rebecca and that Rebecca oh and I get you and the other Rebecca you ever notice how many people have the same name in our church awesome [Music] does that I'll be with me [Music] God is in this glory god is [Music] I will trust in Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] God is glory god is in the details even in the broken parts [Music] I will trust in Jesus [Music] let's go [Music] if it reads like the diction if it is [Music] that is in this story God is in the details [Music] I will trust in Jesus [Music] [Music] better than this story you're in this story God in my story [Music] that was beautiful where's adley Hadley come here singers and then we're after this brother brother Jacob this one is here gonna give us some more word I like that amen thank you you know I don't know if you notice I'm smiling at you kind of you you don't know this is this is my smile you know we saw an accident today but it's so good to see each and every one of you all right [Music] foreign [Music] let's do you thank you my heart belongs to you I never give myself to another [Music] my heart belongs to you my heartbeat myself to another my heartbeat s to you foreign [Music] [Applause] amen so be it amen men I see yes but there's a few seconds to sit down um Romans chapter 8 Romanos capitolo Ocho verse Uno thank you Brothers they're on the screen and I'll explain in a little bit why we're reading this portion of scripture it is Romans chapter 8 verse verse one okay there is therefore no condemnation to them which are Los que estan in Christ Jesus in Crystal Jesus not after the flesh but after Sino the spirit conformation foreign by the name yamado of Miguel Galvez de Miguel Galvez he always encourages to read Romans chapter six in Romans yes yes or yes COC okay he wanted to make sure that we understood what it was to die we had to die in this flesh and the to the desires so he encouraged us to read those chapters before we got baptized that was my grandpa Galvis yes I missed him but I know he's his his soul is under the altar better the theme I died for me personally I was 16 years of age February 22ndoch 1981. the meaning of you mathematicians are doing the math that's okay Manos I wouldn't be here today February 22nd 1981 see if I can put on this in a nutshells it doesn't look like it they start giving me me a a cord it doesn't doesn't seem like that can we just go on I gave my life to the Lord in February 22nd 1981.00 and I want to tell you young people I came you'll be honest with you it was Contigo out of fear out of fear the preachers that we grew up with

that's what I want to encourage you to do I can have a relationship he loves you he gave his life for you so we came out of fear so you come out of fear and and sadly in in this movement in this Apostolic movement Apostolic I believe it had its time that it had it's it's bigger there you go but we're in the 11th Hour amen amen and in the name of Jesus amen but this brother reminder when the Lord called him when the Lord called that light is enlightened you amen he spoke a prophecy to me I really didn't understand it at the time is he looked at me and my mirror you too are the death it is
