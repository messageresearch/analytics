gamez nervous Hallows day video Mucha Gracia and god bless you [Music] [Applause] [Music] my name is viola and I'm interviewing our founding pastor brother the matzo fetes senior oh my grandpa we're doing the joy project and it stands for just older youth and we just want to show our gratitude and appreciation for all that you've done grandpa for standing for this message and just for everything that you've done for for everybody so I have a couple questions for you okay okay so how did you come to know the Lord Jesus [Music] I'll beg dude how how bad do I have to however back [Music] well when he seemed to have a long life better and and and how much I have gone through it's a long time but it's it's about did you know did you know that when you you were you were ordained to the ministry in 1969 in Bakersfield California right yeah so remember that yeah 1969 yeah and so from 69 next year will be 19 or will be 2019 so next year you will have been a minister or d'ardane Minister for 50 years [Music] that's a long time [Music] yes I remember I remember details on how long I've been pastoring the church and how long I've been uh they've they've had me on this thing what what was I when I started 1959 to 1960 yeah that's three or four years you served in the Navy then used then you married mom in 1965 No 64 and then you have Tommy in 1965 Jackie in 1966 near baptized in 1967 in the Apostolic Church then in 1969 you were ordained as a pastor then in 1972 you came into the message say I need to get together on that lift and in my my my limit to because that sound right yeah these are [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] how exactly did you get to know the Lord Jesus with it yeah that's a little experience also Kim another service bank miles of 20 years old when I got out of a navy I went have a 15 ounce or two years during the Vietnam era and that self it's another just a movie but when I got out of the service uniforms my parents were at everything and I was back home safe and of course my mom Church loving and then my dad a pastor and the hot dog search in abandoned church and when I got hoarse go to church a school teachers you didn't want to go and I said you know what I feel fully good you know it's a good thing Here I am and I go over there or not and I said I'm gonna go up and I'm gonna sit in back as soon as I can say okay as long as just go through the wonderful and thank the Lord for me about it and Here I am up and you know Pentecostals hey hey hey really could get wrong so I'd start the music and st. you know and they were real pure body but you know that's the way they are today rowdy man everybody goes their way and Here I am and I'm looking at the door you know saying hey as soon as they can and then you start putting the spirit name this to go wait he said that's this minister up there in the front he knew me real doing in those neighborhoods there yes my dad's - he's still around yeah it's been a little Dom he's never done that and he was real cast back in me yet so much you you would have he would just like persist you know and he kept you know wait he was for science service is he ever said kiss me and you would kind of wave like that day to come forward and I just look away in on it and here are he knew I wasn't going to come forward so he asked another messaging to take over they were looking for the percent of the service and he walked out I say oh my god here he comes oh and I was pretty hostile you know myself aggressive people just don't know no I don't know what no meat so so then he's all I can see is a name and and Here I am waiting again so now I was trying to look through the door yeah the part got just gonna let me go out and act like he was holding guns you know this is White's no come on just you want to come forward and pray so we can thank the Lord and I'm five minutes we could target to tell the closer he gets us but the sound was too much yes it's just just leave me alone I'm fine there right what madness is I see your manner that's just you haven't met because you're insistent and then and then he said you know what Jesus will hear you whether you're happy you're mad upset this doesn't matter I was baptized in the office of the church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ my dad baptized me for the reset my stance and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but when I came in the message it was real so it was really really important that all the highbreed all of us top that was not based on Scripture which was a hybrid seat and the genuine word the original Word of God and then the kinda on the coming to another TV program and all that based on what brother Jimmy was sharing me brother we need to pull up all their high breathe and all the original seats this is what a lot of people in the message understand why I thought we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the message in order to start all over again it's like a baseball diamond when when did you accept them that's about two years and so what keeps you going is a pastor [Music] just in love for the church the people and I remember we started in in [Music] Cuchillo [Music] there was a people there and everywhere we had we had a congregation about body a good congregation a was some desolate church and it was hard to get into the people and get people out and do things III didn't I could do much because I I didn't have the experience or nothing about it I [Music] so it's the love for the people that keeps you going the love of people [Music] yes what is that that keeps you going with this message with the word what is that keeps you strong and it keeps you firm on ground on my door how are you doing this well strong only comes if you're weak without a figure seemed at last three witnesses and I don't feel strong all the time but the verse says that the witness is when you're sincere and you that's when you let him there's a scripture when Peter when the Lord had already said Peter deal of means this particular might achieve fear do you love me of course three times he says it look but I like when he said he said Peter it's after he would be happiest with eutectic love and say take care of mine I call that ego stamina they you know finally he says you know look here when you were young used to go wherever you like private little scriptures they says but when you turn home even a cold wait for somebody that's tasty this he says he said those words big time to tell them that the real death is to die just to yourself but uh there's every point in life versus your buddy the hood says you can't do nothing without me he says come on find love in our daily living I said me not for they says that so the truth is the strength is that you can do nothing only to him and that's the only thing that keeps me going because I don't do things to me or else nothing is no it's a no father is another not absolutely Thomas cannot see me so our strength is it keeps it and what exactly is it that maintains like what is it that maintained relationship with the Lord and with your brothers and sisters in Christ it's the families of those shirts of fellowship utility it's that semi-think Church it restores your vigor spiritually it restores you again it reminds you of the love of Christ would get so involved and other things of doing things as a parent or grandparent and you know the Bible says that as long as we're in this place where did the absence of the Lord we need to get back in there with the spirit in a soul it's and I could think that that fellowship in church is a it's a thing that keeps me going Boetticher Checotah truth no matter how much sometimes his body is gonna fight it all the way and that's my strength it's going to church and learn and Sunday's is the greatest hard life oh yeah learning because we have great teachers you know I wish I had time talk just to go oh man I can share with you stories of scriptures Oh Paul's got my knees and thumbs getting on my knees and back in the old week when they said get concept also this feels a little nice to us they didn't have chairs they were sitting but Hill sits cross-legged seat and we have the greatest teachers right now then we see that their feet I don't mind if they we ever said me not only in a cute if they want to tell me you sit right there I don't doubt I will sit there because those of the beautiful specials this is gues getting generally on behavior that to me we have the greatest teachers right now this way I sleep quiet that's why I want to learn I don't want to jump the gun I don't want to get ahead oh yeah I totally love it you know my love to listen and sometimes when we talk too much we see too many things so it's no I'm targeted without some some crazy reason want to hear this but I went oh it's that's what keeps me going every teachers well maybe Waikiki though me with you know what the Lord is what keeps you what there's times it's hard but I depended on tight coupling because me encouragement and people might [Music] pretty but also in a spiritual way well what advice could you give to us too to maintain our strength me what we have I remember one time when we bought some furniture these this was half negative thought and after Chicano and he was delivering the the salt flats and the furniture from billion flooded every way and ye have really accepted the Lord Jesus Christ and he was really excited and says hey I noticed you have a sign out there and me and monk maybe I will start the Lord you know I said yeah yeah Christian yeah we love the Lord of all hearts you know and he says wow and then he asked me do you guys work for me I said yes how holiday man I was inspired I said and I said you know what and there's a commandment that says the lowly Israel is a mother said what to do Squanto to collect Psalms contour to maintain for talk to sayers but one must further politely is it contentious where's us components forces it to win - you know long with all the strength you know why because I said we went through so many things it's that it's hurtful to change we'll say we didn't go that way such as we turn our strength to sports - to diversions of the world I mean and I made a mistake - you know I was a cross-country runner and I was my strenght that ran marathons and everything I've been going Mexico elliptic spoken there's nothing better what I'm saying is all your strength that's what I say I tell everyone to wait is that something every every bit of it I think turned towards him and you gonna be surprised that he's gonna give you more strength because you're giving and you're gonna receive and that would be my advice because that was the secret to hold on as far as of youth Wow yeah that's what I told that young man is he went out there like saying thank you I said I said and I was surprised because I was not ready for that question but I remember there and I'm saying again this was this how I imagined oh we use your strength over it's a way to tax access exercise how many thumb don't that is wrong that means ground I walked or like an active active no direct that's right Oh every fiber of it you've seen told me everything you got he is not right and what is your advices and or there is a question for you very good dog mmm you have question as the grown-ups or people that come to me what's your favorite song remember of all time what's what's your most favorite song [Music] it's pretty hard to answer that question because I know a lot of I love painted in church today that I've learned such as choruses and things was at the cross one of them at the time every time you preach these to sing that song you never okay second solo must be must be hey you got pastoring very much [Music] yes I do what's the best part Dave [Music] what was a mystery to me like this now is it this big [Music] nice [Music] yeah no CLO Missy little realize [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] specific one you you you can recommend as possibly is to me was their original the spoken word the original work it was for me by me was here because there are good I understood all the ages I understood my hybrid that was there Daniel 30 church age from the dead yes wispy and back huh all day effect in that night scene 325 how they turn away and when the truth Damien and they think I created the work and how we're gonna get back and I saw that you see it when I saw that what really shocked me well when brother Brandon would see the horn and the dollars little boy oh my god obviously and don't you find yourself in a church that is denying some of the words doc so the reasonable word on 50 I mean I says that all that shook me and I love how they you know I loved it it was it was okay it hurts it hurts to to admit that you were in a church I mean they're beautiful people don't get one but but when it comes to the G no we're not they are designed to some possible data and if they fall in that category Donner's other and that really taught me i'll penises oh yeah when i was shocked and i was trying and how come fix it you know so you have to go back to your ISM so I says I'm gonna have to make the decision a moment and if there's ever ask me name various wasn't a while people ask me why that's okay you got ten you want to hear it and I sit down and I talk like my parents or my brother so much this or anybody out there the only thing they really think they kinda understand things there though though the hard part that they really shot some islets cerfancy there really something spelled like this Wow they can't it's just let go they hit a wall and that's anything you don't mean my wife she told me there to die meant to serve in it how she came to the message one time we were talking I says you need you deserve to hear - brother the must in with superseding the felony fester this is no when you hear him and I had shared with her the message and she never fought it she loved it as a matter of fact when she came in I did coming back totally and she did going to church yeah she's my golden chime - yes I took her hey come easy miss Kay let me take care of you there in that kind of way and then she she critiquing continued going and she got a backpack to the brother brother kid last night sir they've artist Church don't know how easy fine and she has been in them and loves the message she loves the brother she loves everything about everything she don't want to go any other place and she was Jean like Captain Arthur got damaged it'll cost us all to him kneeling and all those kind of players and I just see her daughter a lot of things Ebola and fighting with she heard the message he was like soul boy sentence more than others no argument about anything and the same thing was me I'm never T can tell you I never argued anything we sat down what are you sure with me out of some constant opening the details I'm all yours religion talking and listening listening I wanna argue I trusted that God was Indian expose and he was tell me the whole truth and nothing but the truth [Music] [Music] how how did you come to know the Lord Jesus um well like you in 1987 I am we had got to to the Walmart and we saw some friends there that you should be ferry Cruces and then they had work to server city we met them there and then they invited us to Silver City and went to chicken that's how I met the Lord Jesus so whenever the first time you went to church you you felt comfortable and you feel good there I fell in love with it okay thank you so the next question um so what what was your year that you were baptized and when did you receive the Holy Ghost mmm I was baptized in I think it was July of 1987 and how did you receive the Holy Ghost I received the Holy Ghost I would say the same year in 1987 okay but who who baptized me brother Dan okay when did you meet the founding pastor and when did you start attending Cedar Hills well I met brother timing you know like I said him in 1987 and they a started attending church in in June of 87 okay so like what you think that keeps you going on like what what what gives you like whenever you wake up what makes you keep like okay I'm gonna be I'm gonna be okay today so like I feel good today what keeps what keeps you going on like that spirit like spiritually well just you know I get up in the morning and I prayed to the Lord and then I just start getting messages that's the only thing that keeps us going well that's kept me going how do you maintain the relationship with the Lord Jesus and your brothers and sisters in Christ well I mean maintain life but where the Lord Jesus might I hear these word and just try to apply it is this best as I can and the same with my brother physician you know just trained to to do what the word says to do to to love women to just you know try to be you know what what the word tells us to do my favorite well I like them a lot of funds but my favorite song is amazing grace okay pretty good sister yeah it means um next question what's your favorite message of brother Brandon oh I like I like to hear his life story advice to to being with Christian to other people that's what would you say that there's nothing better better and this led them to serve the Lord I am here with my auntie Paula she'll be speaking on behalf of Uncle Louie married that us us so whenever you're ready auntie you may go ahead I know my brother Louie was baptized in the 1980s I'm not sure that I know my sister al was very very happy that her brother was getting baptized and of course had accepted the message so that was good Marian and Louie they got married and of course had accepted the message so that was good Marian and Louie they got married on October the 8th 2006 but I have to go to the to the morning of 2008 they had gone to church and then after church the seed got baptized and then went out to eat and it was about three or four o'clock that they got married that same day so I thought it was very special because a little Tommy married them and but I know that they had been dating for a little while and she accepted the message right away so that you know made it easy for Louie you know that she believes the message and believe our profit so that was a good and when did they meet the founding pastor well I was probably the earlier maybe the middle of around June or July of 2006 of course you know my sister passed away in 1996 but she would have been happy to see you know how after they were it's awesome to hear yeah I thought it was pretty neat that they got married that same date because that went to church that that does them they got married that's cool well my brother he's a cowboy and he he loves to raise horses and his donkeys and his pigs and chickens him and Marian do a lot of things together they like to go camping they like to wear rodeos and so they they stay pretty busy and of course they're hunters she was at this year she got a deer and out that my brother didn't get one so we'll have to wait for next year see what happens they like to go hunting awesome yeah anyway they're you know they go to church all the time and and you know these things very happy and of course my Marian and Lou got married she had a special son he has been a blessing to all of us and so Louie has been very very good you know to him and Marianne is just the best mom any child could ask for he got real sick it was a like the end of October and he was in the hospital in and out and finally he she got to take him home and so she had to blame or she didn't work all the month of November nor December you know because her child came first between her job and and Eddie Joey you know she stayed on took care of him and I really admire her because you know being such a good person and good mother so we love her very much and she's you know really been a blessing to our family what would you say is uncle and auntie's greatest strength well the love they have for each other and and you know how the Lord works in their lives and must hook-ups been with Eddie Joe and you know all that you know Rex keeps them together in a very good way what would you say is the key of to life for them it would evolve it would evolve oh I told you about emptyness travel and loving nature and loving each other and loving God that's awesome do you know their favorite hymn you know I really don't I really don't but I do know that they're Eddie Joe was he hasn't been to church with us for a while but when he was going to church he was she was always worshiping he probably worship more than any of us and did you eat the big last lesson there singing and he you know just make he doesn't speak but he would you know holler out and caught his hands and and you know if the music makes me very happy so I think that is so neat when in fact one day he was sitting in the back and I don't know how he got up he got up and before we knew it he was at the altar that's amazing yeah thank you for your time and for speaking on their behalf and I believe that they will see that God bless you I'm here with them brother Daniel Danny and if so project joy is it's an acronym for just older youth and so what we're doing is we're doing this project to express our gratitude and appreciation for the older generation that has come before us and and just to express our appreciation of your walk with the Lord and to document your life story so the first question is how did you come to know the Lord and well I got converted in December 2001 after my wife died but before then I know you know I knew the truth in our words but I accept the Lord until what happened to my life as a I don't know you know if you know what happened to my okay so in December 2001 that's when I got converted but you know since we were young Mei Lan and Tommy still live in Hanover in the morning was to go to a Baptist Church Sunday School in the night time dad used to take us to all the church in beard so all that time you know I do that Lord but I still am given by my heart to love them I was until December 2001 when what when did you get baptized it was December 2001 and my brother Tommy's I wanted that pliés me over there the church in silver well um what makes you keep going on cue well don't say that gets me going is because I know my Creator and he's my provider he supplies all my needs and I know that he's live in this earth we're living here just watch for the Lord gave us 30 years to live in this earth so in other words it comes down to what do you want spend eternity go on vacation or damnation sir for sure a lot because I want every choice with our Lord now I want to be tormented by the devil damnation so I know I know the truth since I was young body except the Lord until this several 2001 that's awesome I know it's kind of like the same thing but what what's the what is the key to life for you the key for life yes well the key for lives I would say is you gotta give thanks to other for everything and you got thank you for everything getting praise honor and glory for her because he's not creator I events in there and he's the one that's greater created every thing that you see was made by key turn every what gives me good do you have any favorite songs well favorite songs are well well you know what Christmas carols my favorite song is there oh holy night it's my favorite Christmas girl holding item and the Hampton church oh hey my my favorites I can say which one because I like all I have cause there's someone that you like better than naughty but right now I can cannot remember the names of course there's something I like there another's but it comes down to Christmas girl or hold a night is my favorite you do you have a favorite message of brother branham or of our pastor founding pastor I'm sorry to cut you a visit again do you have any favorite messages of our prophet or of the founding pastor well I can't say I have any favorites because like what Tommy you know Mike I was the pastor of the church and silver however was the boss I say it was a tremendous message and airy the following Sunday said he was better than less hockey so see it starts to say because there were all awesome yeah brother anyway we know who Brendan was as a poster for the and time Missy said but I cannot say whistle my varicose or to me they're all awesome um do you have any advice on being a Christian well the advice I give to my my daughter's I got two daughters you know my grandchildren your life telling the only solution for this wicked will is to get close to a lord other than that man cannot solve the problems of this world because things are really bad evil you're the only solution we have to get close all Lord because after what happened to my wife easily I could have come here to the other side my show you know but they would tell me when I see a counselor tell you know what no man on this earth can help me the only one that can help me is over let's each and every one of you today well today we were with brother Fidel and his

element a in the blush robeeyay a preguntar obvious primera meant a case ail and la paura Heke he gave this and concocted forget about the world's events and I think first of all for us to be able to there's so many details in a man of that caliber of our founding pastor would take me forever to to give it in so many details of his life but just a quick overview as we we all know of a man that we appreciate the greatest man I can say that I have that that I've ever had in my life has been my father my hero my father was born in on May 27th 1941 to bedro and Maria Pettis he he is there was seven brothers him included and six sisters and I believe one or two adopted and through a through their their that the life they were born he was born in in Hanover New Mexico a very into a very poor family but a family that that loved the Lord and and they were raised to to serve the Lord at the age of I believe it was at the at the age of of 18 he ended up going into the the US Navy there you spent the next four years from 1959 to 1963 in the in the Navy he when he got out of the Navy I believe it was a year later that he married my mother which is sister viola Pettis at the time her maiden name of course viola tell us us and she she was their their their first son that they had was in nineteen they were married in 1964 in the first son came in 1965 and came and that was Thomas Jr then came Jacqueline in 1966 and 1970 was Naomi and then after 1971 was Caleb and then 1981 I believe it was that was that was William but like I said he he was a pastor for many many years a great servant of the Lord that the way that the Lord used him in his ministry was simply out of this world as we've often said we never had to go look for a hero outside of our own home so so many things so many miracles so many things supernatural things that happen during his life God's hand always upon him keeping him and so that's kind of an overview yeah but you have any any questions for me yeah could you tell us what year he was baptized sure so in nineteen in I believe it was February 26th of 1960 seven that's when he was baptized and then and when did he accept the message and then well he after being baptized in 67 in 1969 him in my uncle Abraham they were they were were ordained as as ministers in Bakersfield California in 1969 I believe it was 1972 that they ecstatic said that they ended up accepting the message what was maybe some of his favorite messages or you know series of brother branham well being that he loved the the message so much every every message he loved he believed but he would always tell us especially as young ministers that we if we could get a hold of the the series the church ages the seven churches the seven seals the Hebrew series and of course Daniels 70 weeks he said if you could if you can under get those and and and seek the Lord about them and read them and you understand that then you'll understand the whole message is that it's it's all based in there in those in those series so those were the things he went through so many so many church church age and also the Seventh Seal books they were like road maps so those were probably yeah I would say is his favorites what about songs what was maybe one of his favorite songs well being that he was a musician he he loves songs he loves singing he loved playing a very avid guitarist trumpet ear you name it he could pick up any instrument and just play it so so I I would say that especially during his ministry one of the songs that he'd love to come out with was at the cross also in Spanish in la Cruz and those that verse were where it says on ksfy solo no estoy mondo in console a dog that was that was one of his favorite songs and one of his favorite verses to that song okay and the last question I would ask um what do you believe it was that kept him going for all those years through all the trials and things that he endured well I believe number one the thing that has kept him going and we're thankful to God that he's still here with us the thing that that kept him going was his love for the Lord we asked him that question the other day and to Allah what would keep him going this as a pastor and his response was my love for the people and if I ever saw a man that had a heart and love the people and was always wanting to do whatever he could to help them make it home that's what kept him going many times okay well thank you for interviewing here today god bless you god bless you that might be what he's been talking to you now holy all wrong it's eternal life ever word of God it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance well it's hot cold any different whether the people are fussing rattling while you're doing it they love joy you hear the word long
