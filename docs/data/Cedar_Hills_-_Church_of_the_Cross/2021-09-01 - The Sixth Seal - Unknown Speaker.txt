now we notice now as we go into the sixth seal now may the heavenly father help us as we settle down now to this sixth seal now this twelfth verse of the sixth chapter and i beheld when he opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell into earth even as a fig tree cast her untimely figs when she's shaken of a mighty wind and the heavens departed as a scroll when it's rolled together whenever a mountain every island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great man and the rich man and the chief captains and the mighty man and everybody and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that set up on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand if we find out now john said i'll be held when he opened the sixth seal that was a great earthquake then all nature was interrupted see but we find out here that nature took a tumble yes all nature look what taken place the the earthquake the sun went black and the moon would give its light the stars shook and fell and while everything happened see right at the time of the opening of this sixth seal that's when it takes place right immediately after the announcement of those martyrs okay the martyrs have been finished now you see we're right close into that hour now we could be at any time see because the church is just about ready to take its flight but remember when these things happen the bride won't be here just remember the bride's gone you don't have to go through any of it this is a time of tribulation of purification of the uh of the church it's put up honor for it go through it not the right he takes his sweetheart out of the way that's cersei done redeemed her see it's kind of a that's his own selection his own choice like any man that takes his bride now the earthquake compares scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or uh mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries and the six seals all together is one great big book just six scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed that's reason john wept because of no one could get that book all creation everything was gone she just simply turned back to atoms and molecules and so forth and cosmic light and not even be creation person nothing else because adam lost the rights of that book he forfeited when he listened to his wife and she listened to satan's reasonings instead of the word of god he was farting then he couldn't go back into the dirty hands of satan who tempted her out of the way so therefore it went back to its original owner like any abstract deed would do see goes right back to its original owner and that was god the creator who made it and he holds it now here let's start out now and let's read uh saint matthew the 24th chapter now i just like to give you something here i've just looked up to find now saint matthew from one to three well it's where we go to read first and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple and he said unto them see not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be one be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down these three verses it took place actually on tuesday afternoon april the 4th 80 30. and the first two verses took place on the afternoon of the of april the 4th and 80 30 and the third verse taken place on tuesday evening of the same day see now notice here is here is three questions are asked by the jews his disciple three questions are asking why what um uh first first what when shall these things be when there won't be one stone left up on another what shall be the sign of thy coming second question and of the end of the world see it these three questions see just exactly comparing what jesus said in matthew 24 and what the revelator here opened up in the sixth seal is just exactly and jesus was speaking of the tribulation period amen this sixth seal is the tribulation period that's what takes place the bride has gone there's no living creature nothing there to say it it's just now god is not dealing with the church no more it's been gone he's dealing with israel this is the other side this is when israel received the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelation 11. remember israel is a nation god's servant nation and when when when israel is brought in it'll be a national affair and that's when they're supposed to be delivered now look let's get to daniel 12 here just a minute and at that time michael shall stand up the great prince which stood for the children for or the children of thy people see that's jews and there shall be a trouble such never was since there was a nation even to that same time now compare that exactly what jesus said matthew 24. there should be a time of trouble has never been since there was a nation look at this sixth seal see the same thing a time of trouble notice since there wasn't even to the same time and at that time thy people now in this seven last part of the seventh year thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book the predestinated you see that's written in the lamb's book of life shall be delivered at that time and many of those asleep in the dust the earth shall await and some to everlasting life and some of the evolution shame and contentment now and then shall the wise shine as the brightness of the firmaments and and they that turn many to righteous shall shine the stars forever and ever and i will give power unto my two witnesses that they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sacral these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand before the god of the earth if any man hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth devour their enemies and if any man shall hurt them he must in this manner be killed see there it is they can speak what they want to and there it happens amen brother god rides on the scene here they have power uh power to shut the heavens that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over the waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with plagues as off as they will what is it god can bring these things but the word they can do nature any way they want to here it is they're the one who brings on this sixth seal they uncover and open it up it's a power of god [Music] this interrupt nature see the sixth seal is completely an interruption of nature do you get it now there's your seal who doesn't it's the prophets the other side of the rapture and here he is with the commission from god to smite the earth whatever he wants to oh [Music] stop the heavens and he does what's the matter he's fixing to take the 144 thousand out for redemption out of the book of redemption and that's under the seal of redemption and the sixth seal that's it my dear friend that's that sixth seal if it's so mysterious and here is a word taking what he has given to me and blending it together and showing you so you know yourself it's thus saith the lord see
