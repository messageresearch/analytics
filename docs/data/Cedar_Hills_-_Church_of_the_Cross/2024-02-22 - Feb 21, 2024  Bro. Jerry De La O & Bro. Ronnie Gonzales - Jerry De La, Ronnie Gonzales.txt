one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them [Music] man God bless you this evening God bless you this evening there we go I know it's Wednesday sometimes on Wednesday we're a little tired but God is good amen amen God is good and there's no other place we'd rather be and right here not hearing from me but from hear hearing from God this evening amen I may not to take too much time but uh let's get to our scripture in Matthew 15 and I'm GNA start with uh verse 21 you know man and it reads like this then Jesus went then and departed into the coast of Ty and sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and Bes besought him saying send her away for she crith after us but he answered and said I am not sent unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table then answered then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour may the Lord add the blessing to the read reading of his word and you may be seated you know and we we have a situation here we we we have this this uh this lady and and she has a need but her need her need to her was was was great but but you see here Jesus didn't think it was that I shouldn't say didn't think that but but but he wasn't sent to her but but what she needed was great you know and how many of us have a need you know how many of us struggle with certain things you know and her need was so great that she was not going to leave there until she got an answer you know and sometimes we have a need and we want something done right away and if it's not done right right away we we we we as humans we give up we're like oh never mind he he don't care about me but but not this lady she had a need and she was persistent in her need you know she was persistent as to what she needed she was persistent as to what she wanted you know there there's times where where we have needs and we want something or we need something from the Lord but we want it right then and there sometimes it'll happen sometimes it won't but we cannot give up you know because we have one goal because if we want to be persistent in something we we there's a goal that that we have to be persistent in and we're pers we can be persistent in the things of the Lord which is good and that's what that's what the Lord wants because our ultimate goal should be to make it home right our ultimate goal is to make it home it's not to be part of this world our ultimate goal is to make it home and we're going to have trials and tribulations on that road the devil is going to do everything possible knock us off that road but we can't give up we can't quit but at the same time there's persistence in the things of God but also but also we can pers be persistent in the things of the world right we can also be persistent in the things of the world and that's what where the devil will try and get us he wants you to take your mind off the ultimate goal he doesn't want you to find your purpose he doesn't want you to know who you serve he doesn't want you to give all your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ but ultimately that should be the goal to give our heart to the Lord because we cannot be part of this world we we can't have this be one foot in the world and one foot in church and walk both it can't be done you either sell all the way out to the world and sell all the way into Jesus Christ but you know for for for for the most part persistence is linked very closely to endurance because you because you got to have a lot of endurance for this trip that we're taking because it's not a short Journey but how many has it been for you a long journey this has been a long road but don't quit now don't quit now because we are so close it is so close and it would be a shame to quit now that's a de that's what the devil wants from us you know he wants us to get so far he wants us to do this and then he's trying to get us to turn back you know every day how many every day does the devil try and do something to you every day right I mean I don't think there's a day that goes by that that that he doesn't try to distract us somehow the devil is persistent in what he's trying to do to us but we in turn got to be persistent in God to overcome that situation and how do we overcome that situation by listening to the World by dealing with the World by hanging out with the world but we overcome that situation by getting the word inside of us every single this of this word get it to dwell inside of each and every one of us that's how we can fight him that is how he can be defeated because we cannot give up if we look at Noah in the Bible they they said the Lord told me it was going to rain to build an AR because it's going to rain but up until that point it had never rained on the Earth but Noah did not give up he he kept going on he it's going to rain it's going to rain the Lord said it's going to rain he did whatever the Lord told him and they look at him and they tell him nah you're crazy Noah for doing that no it's going to rain and then one day he was prepared not the others but he was prepared rain came down because he did not give up he did not quit on God's word the same with Abraham when he told him he was going to have a son and he finally had a son and then the Lord told him what did he had to do with that son right he told him he had to sacrif he wanted him to sacrifice him so he got everything ready he put even put the wood on his son's back and his son got there and they got everything prepared and he didn't doubt the Lord here is here is the evidence that he had a son and he did everything exactly like the Lord told him he was persistent into what the Lord told him he even had the knife right here ready to go down he was ready he was ready and then all of a sudden there's a ram in the in the bushes because he didn't doubt one word of God he knew the Lord would make a way and that's the way it is with each and every one of us us no matter what we go through no matter what Trials come our way no matter what sickness comes our way the devil cannot stand in the way of the plan of the Lord of of our Lord Jesus Christ whatever he tries to do to us he's already defeated and we got to walk around knowing that that he is already defeated but every step that we take we're being persistent because we got to go forward we got to keep going forward we got to keep going forward we can't go back there's nothing there for us anymore I'm sorry there's nothing there for us anymore what we did back there ain't no good but what we're doing right now for the Lord Jesus Christ is to serve him is to give all our heart to him this evening it's not to forget what he did for us he tries to bring into remembrance the things that we did the things that I did but if we realize all that is under the blood so when he looks down he doesn't see the sin anymore he sees you under the blood so once that sin is under the blood don't pull it back out leave it there leave it there it's covered sins are covered that's right we see there's persistent in the things of God but there's also persistence in sin you know and if if you go I'm not going to go to it because because it'll probably take too much time but if you read in First Kings 21 and and and in there Ahab he asked this this gentleman to give him his property he want he wanted that property and the man said no I can't give that to you it's been in my family and so Ahab he was kind of disappointed so he tells his his wife or she asked him what happened why why do you look so so uh so sad so so depressed why asked him for his land and he wouldn't give it to me but needless to say she was persistent that he was going to have that she she was persistent that that she wanted that for her husband if we can turn to that real quick first second First Kings 21 17 and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the saying arise go down to meet Ahab king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he is in the vineyard of NE Nebo whether it whether he has gone down to possess it and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus sayith the Lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and th and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus sayeth the Lord in the place where dogs lick the blood of nebul shall dogs lick the blood even th so if we stay persistent in sin we will be judged he was judged right here because it that wasn't it it wasn't he wasn't supposed to do it like that he did wrong so he was judged right here so if we stay persistent in the things we're not supposed to we will be judged and we don't want to be judged we want to be persistent in the things of God this evening we want to be persistent in what God has for us the good that God has for us because the blessings are right there for you and I the healing is right there for you and I salvation is right there for you and I but it doesn't come easy we got to work for it we got to fight for it we got to struggle for it but it's right there we got to have faith we got to pray we got to be strong in the no matter what he tries to do to us no matter the situation he tries to put in front of us we got to keep on keeping on this evening we got to keep on keeping on for the Lord we got to struggle we got to battle we got to fight but know one thing the battle is already w the victory is already won we are dealing with a defeated enemy this evening he can't harm you he can't touch you but he can put trials in front of you he can put struggles in front of you but we keep keep on keeping on this evening and closing it's it's been a struggle it's been a battle everything that we do is is a battle and if if you sit there this evening and and you think everything is easy and you say oh there I have no trials check yourself because as Christians we should never have it easy if it's too easy check ourselves see what's wrong it might it might sound crazy you know you talk to people in the world and they and I always talk to him and they oh man we have it so easy and this and this is going good for me and they say how's it going for you I said it's going good I'm not I'm not going to give the devil credit we give him too much credit it's going good it's been a struggle but it's going good this has happened to me but it's not going to stop us because our ultimate goal our ultimate goal this evening is to make it home is to cross over to the the other side it's to see our loved ones that have already made it home that is our goal that is our our journey right now and don't give up amen God bless you [Applause] amen God bless you this evening brother Jerry brother Noah thank you amen would you all please stand as we read the word this scripture is going to be really easy for everybody to find Genesis 1:1 back to the beginning amen in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light turn to verse 26 well-known scripture and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creepy thing that creepeth upon the Earth am man you be seated amen so today I'm going to continue a little bit what I what I uh spoke on for the New Year's Eve service so this is my little little series part two of what think you of Christ not to take anything away from our pastor but since that's what he's on and that's how God's been dealing with me so I want to I'm gonna continue on that also with the subtitle Let There Be amen amen amen so last time I asked the question what think ye of Christ don't don't just hear me think about it what think ye of Christ as I said last time most people are going to think about about Jesus on Calvary for some in the message they're going to think of the Prophet some of us might think of the form that Jesus came to us or the form that he came to you maybe uh our pastor maybe maybe one of the ministers everybody's going to have an image of what they think of Christ now that I said that is that working in your mind what think ye of Christ amen amen but very seldom do we think of ourselves amen again we always think of the person that's had the biggest influence on us or or how Jesus came to us amen amen how often or how many of you thought of yourselves when I asked that question why why not no we're not Christ we're not the Christ the person of Christ because if we were then that would make us an antichrist amen but somebody might say oh well you see brother Ronnie I just you know are we I just I I don't do this or I don't do that I can't do this or I can't do that you see brother Ronnie I just don't have it and that's where the problem ISS that's a trick of the enemy as I said last time the word overcome means to maintain life in you amen amen but uh but according to brother brandham he also says this overcome means to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks remember that remember when I read that the last time but we to recognize him devil but we must recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than he is the god in who the god in who the god in who the God in Me me amen because if we leave it here with brother brandham says that word of God doesn't do us no good it's always in the past amen but we have to see the god in you amen now today I'm going to get a little bit personal today today I'm today I'm gonna speak nothing but my experiences I'm not going to speak about my trials my tribulations but if something like that comes up may my trials may my tribulations be your stepping stone learn from the experience you know so so for years so for years I I pray that and I wanted the life of Jesus inside of me anybody pray that to be like Jesus I I pray to have his life you know that I would read the messages listen to brother brandham and and to see how God would use them God that makes us for me that would make such an impact in my life as a young man and I thought to myself I wish I could have an impact on the people like he did I will see our founding Pastor the gift of faith that he had I mean I I would think to myself I wish I had a gift of faith like that oh I would see brother L the teachings that he would do I wish I could teach at him I would see Tommy junr how we all know how Tommy junr is Tommy J he gets up here he song leads and he gets a crowd moving oh when we have a grand old time and I thought to myself I wish I had that gift I would see brother Jimmy the sincerity of the man the genuine love that he has for the people to be able to go anywhere at any time didn't matter doesn't matter where the person's at I would say wow wow I wish I had that gift to see our pastor brother Caleb to make get these big deep subjects of the word to make them so simple that even a baby can understand a baby in the word I would see that I was like wow I wish I could do that anybody ever thought that and again I'm speaking on from my experience okay but the thing is I can't be them I can't no matter how much I try I can't see and and and that's where our mentality stays stuck I can't but the thing is this the flip side of the coin they can't do what I can do somebody might be thinking to themselves oh what do you do that's for me to find out that's I need to figure out the will of God in my life you figure out the will of God in your life and when you figure that out know what he can do what you can do no matter how uh what great man that they may be nobody can do what you can do you are unique it's like every person's like a like a thumbprint no no two people have the same thumb print print is unique to you amen amen what think he of Christ what think ye of yourself as I said last time I want Ronnie to die now I'm not talking about getting a gun and pulling the trigger and none of that stuff but I want that old nature that Gonzalez nature that's no good for nothing that that nature is contrary to God every human being your nature where you come from doesn't matter how tremendous your your father grandfather whoever may be it's a nature of the world contrary to God amen amen that Gonzalez negativity remember we spoke about that last time everybody's been speaking about that seems like right the last few services but that has to die amen amen and by God's grace it is now watch when all else fails you you're going to have failures people around you are going to fail I don't know where I came from one thing that will never fail you is God amen amen people may fail you and they will but one thing that God will never fail you never we see the highs and the lows of the life of David we read the Psalms we preach a lot of the Psalms a lot of the ministers preach on Psalms on the book of Psalms in the Book of Psalms you see the highest and you see the lows of David's life right but we're not here I'm not here to speak about my lows I'm here to speak about his highs the Bible says that David encouraged himself and that's where I found myself in the highs and the lows of Ronnie's life in Ronnie's Book of Psalms Ronnie but like I said God won't fail you so Ronnie encouraged himself now after I spoke the last time I was in the shower a few days after that I was washing my hair you know and and and I was there and I was and I was praying I'm there and and just like Lord Lord help me Lord help me help me Lord I don't want to be this way I want the Gonzalez nature to die Lord I don't want to be that way I'm in the shower and I'm praying this okay Lord help me Lord help me Lord help me now there when the Lord comes to you and speaks to you there's no fake in that presence there's no faking that presence there comes a time where God's Gonna GNA come to you and he's goingon to demand of you an answer like he did unto job job G up your loins and speak to me like a man and there that that's where Ronnie was at in the shower it was reflecting on my life I said Lord I help me Lord Lord I don't want these feelings that I don't want these feelings no more and I was crying out to him Lord Lord help me when all of a sudden he descends you sound like those men in the scripture Lord Lord I do this in your name he didn't tell me I was that man he said you sound like them what are you he tells me who are you are you a husband are you a father are you a son what are you are you a barber a hunter Ronnie Ronnie what are you am I not the high priest of your confession and I said yes Lord you are the high priest of My Confession then why ask me for help blew me away well Lord You're the one where my help comes from why he asked me for help speak the word confess it with your mouth confess with your mouth that with what you are confess it constantly asking for help in a hope that God's gonna do something but we are commanded by the word to speak the word speak what you want to be and you with the power to create a world and go and live on it the words that we speak they either they're either life or death did he not he tell Moses why cry Moses why cry speak now I didn't say it in my heart I didn't say it in my mind confessed it with my mouth that which what I was or what I am I am a Son of God I am a minister of this gospel I am a believer in the word I am a believer in the Holy Ghost I am I am born again I believe in a prophet that God sent me a prophet been redeemed I've been restored I have reached that stature and when I said it I said Let There Be You may say oh Ronnie you haven't reached that I Abraham counted the things that were not as though they were in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period and darkness was upon this Earth this Earth was void but then he came and he said let there be and there was light Let There Be he didn't say it he just showed me what to say I confessed it with my mouth Let There Be joy happiness peace I said let there be and there is that's what we have been told to confess it confess it let there be and go forward now there was a doctor he was a neuroscientist at the Thomas Jefferson University Thomas Jefferson him and Communications expert they got together and they made a book this book is called words can change your brain in it they write a single word has a power to influence the expression of the genes that regulate physical and emotional stress when we use words with positivity like love and peace we can alter how the brain functions by increasing cognitive reasoning and strengthening the areas in our frontal loes right in using positive words may often more often than negative ones can Kickstart the motivational Center of the brain propelling them into action I like this part right here I found the mistake I want to say this study was done in 2019 but this in lack of a better term I want to say this concept has been around for a long time before any scientist ever got together to to to realize this I always say this I tell customers when I talk to customers when I talk to people they say oh science disproves God no sir science proves God an expert from their book tells us how using the right words can literally change our real how using the right words can literally change our reality that's just words by man that's Science Now imagine what a word of God can do imagine what what the word of God can do if we get one promise and hold on to that just one promise I know we've heard that a lot but think about it the best way to to to uh to learn something is by repetition to hear something repetitively now watch Romans 43 for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness 17 as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quith the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were that's why I say this scripture proves that that concept has been around for a lot longer than so why cry speak and let there be we have the power our words have the power to create a world and go and live on it now watch words their meanings shape our beliefs Drive our behavior and ultimately creates our world amen amen now the enemy is going to come he's going to try to plant a seed inside of you he's also going to come over here with the word of God he's going to dislocate it dis represent it and he's going to come he's going to bring it to you amen amen but we have that seed that has been planted inside of us church that seed we it cannot be hybrid we can't just sit here waiting for the Lord to do some kind of a Hocus Pocus on us he gave you the power of the spoken word speak it and go forward now imagine imagine come here Angelo come here for a second the Lord says Angelo Angelo I'm going to show you how I do it and you were with them and he says look my son this is how you're going to do it the first day day let there be light let there be the second day let there be the third day my son let there be the fourth day my son let there be the fifth day let there be but on the sixth day he says my son let us make m let us I showed you how to do it I showed you what to say now let us thank you a rehearsal a rehearsal Elijah Let There Be anxiety tell anxiety let there be let there be peace God had to believe his own word you remember do you remember our founding Pastor saying that one he said God said it brother Bram says they might have taken six 6,000 years for the world to come he said it and there was let there be let there be peace now there's a there's a word that hasn't been used behind our pulpit in a long time brother Mike you remember this we better be packing the goods remember that maybe a lot of your young ones maybe don't know about that but it used to be that they used to say that all the time right brother Mike I better be packing the goods you better be packing the goods amen Amen Brother Carlos you remember that because one of these days maybe our pastor's not going to be there maybe one of the ministers ain't gonna be there and he can't say for you let there be for you we have to get to that place I have to get to that place where I can say Let There be let there be amen amen you might say that's just for the minister that's our problem no it's not I'm going to repeat that again oh brother Ronnie it's just for the minister no it's not no it's not the Bible says we're Believers in the scriptures the Bible says uh let me get that for you I don't want to wrong these signs shall follow who man and woman ministers does it say that come on Le Ley these signs shall follow the prophet these signs shall follow the minister these sign shall follow them that believe God put that in the church in my name they shall speak with new tongues not so much speak in tongues I'm a Believer in that the reason why I'm a Believer in speaking in tongues because God put it in the word and he never took it out never in the scriptures never in the word will you find that God took that out of the word you'll never find that but these signs shall follow them these sign shall follow you again we better packing the goods because maybe just maybe they might not be there one of these days and these signs will follow you it's going to follow you the believer God said it I believe it that settles it that's that's one that hasn't been used in a while too we must remove those words from our vocabulary defeated how many have you felt defeated worry I can't I'm horrible pardon my step away from there I suck I'm stupid I'm a I'm an idiot have you used those words every time you use that one of those words you're speaking that upon yourself and your body is going to react to what you verbally say in other words this we like to we get excited when we say oh the word of God let there be oh but I suck what you're saying let there be we must never speak that about ourselves much less our children or the brothers and the sisters did you know that negative words release stress and anxiety uh hormones in your body in Ephesians says let no corrupt communication come out of your mouth why because Satan has MAA you know what Maka is that's knowledge of former things he's a chemist he know he knows what hormones to release in your body so that those words come to you your whole body gets discouraged I I I I I know a guy when he is down he is down he totally walking I mean he talk to him hey bro how you doing hey I I'm not mocking but those words cause a whole reaction in his body I used to that was almost slipped out too I used to work with a couple of guys [Music] one of the guys would say to the other guy he would tell me he's a run check this out God I have a headache I feel sick and he would leave it at that and the other guy that we worked with a couple hours later he would be ah I have a headache I'm going to go home and he'd be gone for the whole day one time this was even said ah I have L I can't feel like I can't talk he would say check this out an hour or two later the guy would be there he'd be I I can't talk I have blocked y our words have power there is power in words but the Bible says let this mind be in you and there it is again let you have to let this mind and after we let this mind be in US it says I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me I don't know what time I started that okay better start weighing down because yeah through faith we understand that the word of God the the worlds were framed by the word of God how were they framed by Let There Be he simply said let there be and we know that the world were framed by the word of God so I'm going to I'm going to end with this okay because I'm not sure what time I started at so I I went I went I preached that the last time after after I went to in the shower after I spoke that I've been a new person my my mind and my mentality it's it's completely different but what what God did through my word I I believed my word and and it was so God said let there be light and there was I spoke it and there was if you if you're in need of something whatever it may be we've heard heard a lot of word in this place you know the word Let There Be speak it let there be sick we're GNA get sick again but the healing of the spirit and of the Soul when God comes and changes that it's it's different I may get sick CO's going around like wild fire I may get sick but my spirit and my soul there different I'm I'm I'm a different than what what I was not because uh I was going to speak something negative about myself not so not so much because I'm a great man or a great person but I believe in a great God and greater is he that is in me than than he that is in the world greater is he that is in me than he who can destroy this body so my my my family and I we were in a we went to uh leberg Canyon leberg Slot Canyon leberg Canyon anybody heard of that one it's a good one you got you all got to go visit one of these days there there slot can and then there's lebur Slot Canyon two different ones so as we're walking down this Canyon we were having a great time kids were laughing we were laughing we were being loud we were talking it was we had a great time and as we're walking down this Canyon I for I I would see some droppings of a predator I didn't say nothing about it I mean here I am every time I go out in the woods I always have my sidearm with me I wasn't scared because I had my gun you know so so we're walking a little bit more and there was more walk a little bit more and there was more and walking a little bit more and there was one that was fresh so I so I I told Grace and the kids I was like man that that one's fresh right there Dad let's go back Dad Dad let's go Dad let's go Ronnie was Ronnie we better go my son Nathan we had just barely took his boot off remember he had broken ankle she's like oh yeah he's like they're going to go the Predators is gonna go for the easiest one and that's true so we're having a good time I I told my my family is you know what don't even worry about it we're laughing we're having a great time it's going to hear us before it sees us and trust me it's more scared of you than you are of it Dad let's go Dad let's go let's get out of here I was said no it's fine we walked and there it is looking right at us David freaks out he's Dad let's go and take our don't worry you see how it ran it's more scared of us than we are of it and besides I I have my gun but I won't have to use my gun because it's scared of our voice so now watch the lord gave me something on that when the person is out the predator hunting you'll know about this when you're when you're hunting for Predators you have an electronic call and you can put it out there and the electronic call you turn the sound on and you put on the sound of a distressed animal whether it be a deer a rabbit a bird whatever it may be the Predator hears the sound of distress and the Predator comes because now that's natural now spiritually the the devil is like a roaring lion not a lion he's like a roaring lion and a lion is a predator and a lion is an apex predator so when they hear that sound the sound of distress they come running for a free meal easy meal and the Lord says when you're negative that's how you sound that's a that's like a gut punch to me when you're negative that's how you sound when you see things that maybe you shouldn't be seen no I'm not talking about poras but maybe we see things that happen we dislike it maybe we talk about it that's a sound of distress maybe something happens to us a predator also likes the sound of a baby rabbit and they'll come to devour so a lot of times when we're complaining we sound like a baby right and the Predator the enemy he loves that he loves the sounds of distress he loves the sound of your complaining let me rephrase that he loves the sound of my complaining he loves the sounds of my distress that's why in the highs and the lows of David David never stopped giving praise even in his highs and his lows and in you is given the power of the spoken word now the enemy is scared of the voice because the Predator is a scared of your voice amen amen he's a predator scared of your voice if you know that a bear is scared of your voice a mount Lions he's scared of your voice most of the time anyway we we we better stop the distress the Lord has changed my heart every time I I I I hear something like that I cut the thing off whether it be a phone call whatever it may be I got to go I will I I will no longer I will no longer stop to hear the negativity the Predator loves that sound he'll come to devour you stop that I have to stop that and we have we have to stop it and we have to say Lord joy peace happiness Let There Be I was going to say something else but I'm I'm gonna stop that right there I feel the spirit of the Lord stopping right there let there be you're going through a hard time let there be speak the word let there be the enemy is is scared of your voice you may have the power like I had my 40 I had my gun I had the power to defeat the enemy but I didn't need it simply the most powerful weapon that God has ever given you he could have defeated the devil with his power immediately he simply spoke let there be let there be he's more scared of your voice your voice of Praise than anything else God bless you God bless you brother Ronnie brother Jerry Ronnie Jerry thank you for letting you be thank you for letting the Lord Jesus use you

beautiful word amen Ronnie Jerry you may be seated just real quick brother brother Fidel God bless God bless you I asked for five minutes uh Thanksgiving to the Lord for uh my beautiful wife uh just a couple days ago we were we've been married 30 [Applause] years and something that the lord gave gave to me in my heart it's gonna sound funny but it's because uh it's yeah she thought that I wasn't going to give her any attention the other day we finished working and the Lord inspired my heart to go out and eat a hamburger hamburger but the best thing was a good time because the Lord guided me to do it that way maybe I could have taken her out to a lovely dinner because the children of God have to do all of that I consider myself like Adam when he would go and maybe get something from the tree maybe cut it out cut it down and whatever he cut down it would reappear uh I think that's the way my economy I just go out and I extend my hand and there it is and I could have had for a very good dinner uh uh maybe a a beautiful dress but you know what because it's been 30 years 24 years here in the United States not just anybody could have supported what you had done let us look sisters it is it's hard to support your your husband um sometimes our husbands were uh not careful with her that uh that if it wasn't for them I don't just say it for myself I wouldn't be able to do what the Lord has inspired me to do here her she was uh something fundamental in my life to complete what the Lord has has me here to do and you know what that was but thank the Lord and God is going to reward you you know why because your mother passed away you you were not able to go but I'm going to tell you here you're going to be one of the the the persons in your family that you're going to be able to see your mother again that is what is God that's what God is going to do with you I just want to tell you this for all you that are married uh uh OB observe your wife because a lot of times God wants to say a have you con have you considered what I have given you and when you can look at them with the eyes of God it is the thing that is more be the most beautiful thing you know why because after your salvation he gives us the very best God bless you amen God bless brother Fidel Amen on his wife and his wife for that 30 years you don't see that very often but I believe they had a strong Foundation May the God Lord continue to bless you and give you more years amen just before we go just a couple of announcements uh there'll be prayer on Saturday at 7 o' and then Friday there'll be
