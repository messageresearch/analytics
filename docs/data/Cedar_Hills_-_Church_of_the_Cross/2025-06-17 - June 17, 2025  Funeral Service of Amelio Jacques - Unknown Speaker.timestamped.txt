[19:04] He sends his angels. And on June the 6,
[19:08] this angel came to Lasuses and saw a man
[19:11] by the name of Amelian Hakis. He says
[19:14] that's a flower for the Lord. He picked
[19:17] up that flower. Says your journey has
[19:19] ended. The Lord wants you to a place
[19:22] where that flower will not decay. He
[19:25] needs a flower so he could put there at
[19:27] the altar that gives good aroma, a good
[19:31] smell. Lord, that's where he is right

[19:44] a special man Lord and we are honor him
[19:48] this morning Lord that he's there with
[19:50] the Lord in a place where that flower
[19:52] will never decay. I can say brother you

[24:35] [Music]
[24:41] Very good morning.
[24:44] The Lord Jesus Christ bless you.
[24:48] Before we sit down,
[24:52] I would like to read a scripture in the
[24:54] book of St. John
[24:56] verse uh chapter 11
[24:59] verse 25.
[25:03] It's a very familiar scripture to many.
[25:08] These are the words of our Lord and
[25:09] Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[25:15] And Jesus said unto her,
[25:20] "I am the resurrection and the life.
[25:23] He that believeth in me, though he were
[25:26] dead, he shall live.
[25:29] You may be seated.
[25:32] I would like to thank
[25:34] all to thank all the friends, our family
[25:37] members,
[25:41] that are accompanying our sister
[25:43] Virginia this morning.
[25:49] I would like to say that when one of our
[25:51] loved ones passes on,
[25:55] he he leaves a legacy behind
[26:02] and that will stay in our hearts and it
[26:04] will stay with us always
[26:06] as as a husband,
[26:09] a friend, a companion,
[26:13] his memories ies
[26:17] are going to be converted into the
[26:19] treasure so tremendous
[26:22] for some of us.
[26:26] This is not a goodbye.
[26:30] This is until we meet again.
[26:35] We will see each other very soon.
[26:41] Our brother Alio
[26:46] He is resting on a promise
[26:51] and this promise is not made of menit
[26:55] not it's it's not political
[26:59] it's a promise
[27:01] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[27:05] our Lord and Savior when he said
[27:09] he that believeth in
[27:12] Though he be dead,
[27:15] yet shall he live.
[27:17] Oh, what a promise.
[27:22] I believe with all of my heart
[27:26] before our friend Alio
[27:29] would leave this world,
[27:33] he had the privilege and the opportunity
[27:37] to be able to make his life right before
[27:40] God
[27:41] to be able to prepare himself
[27:44] to encounter himself with God
[27:49] just like that that malfactor on the
[27:51] cross there next to Jesus
[27:56] in that instant that's the only
[27:58] opportunity he had
[28:02] he had an opportunity to hear about God
[28:06] and that's when he said Lord
[28:10] remember me
[28:12] remember me
[28:15] when you come into your kingdom
[28:19] we all heard those words
[28:22] because Jesus said,
[28:25] "He that cometh to me,
[28:28] I will no wise cast out."
[28:32] And and I'm also convinced
[28:36] our brother Alio.
[28:39] He took those words
[28:43] and he accepted the sacrifice
[28:46] and he received the Lord Jesus Christ.
[28:50] as his Lord and Savior.
[28:53] And today,
[28:55] he's not here.
[28:58] He's with our father
[29:02] enjoying the peace of God.
[29:06] Sister Virginia,
[29:12] as the Lord teaches us in his word,
[29:16] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[29:20] you shall be saved and all of your house
[29:24] and you have embraced that promise.
[29:29] That promise gives you hope.
[29:33] This is not a goodbye.
[29:36] only till real soon we'll see you again
[29:40] because we will see him again.
[29:43] How long?
[29:46] It'd be like in a twinkling of an eye
[29:53] a lady like you, Sister Virginia,
[29:57] that has chosen
[30:05] You have chosen to put God first in all
[30:07] of your life
[30:11] and you have decided to embrace the
[30:13] faith
[30:15] as a shield
[30:20] to fight in every war that we would have
[30:23] spiritually speaking.
[30:26] This world has brought you these trials.
[30:32] and faith has been your victory
[30:37] that has helped you to overcome in each
[30:39] one of these trials.
[30:43] For for that reason, Sister Virginia,
[30:47] I can say
[30:49] the faith
[30:52] is accompanied by works of
[30:54] righteousness.
[30:58] We say that we believe in God.
[31:00] and we have faith.
[31:03] But I would like to share something else
[31:05] with you.
[31:07] The Bible teaches us.
[31:11] The Bible says that demons also believe
[31:13] in God.
[31:15] They were at one time over there with
[31:17] him
[31:19] before they were cast out of heaven.
[31:23] But the true ingenuine faith
[31:28] come accompanied with works of
[31:30] righteousness.
[31:32] Sister Virginia,
[31:38] your testimony,
[31:43] you speak so much louder than any word
[31:45] you could say.
[31:48] You are a pillar in our church
[31:53] and your Christian life is an example to
[31:55] all of us
[31:57] but not just us here
[32:01] for your neighbors for your family.
[32:04] You are an example
[32:08] and you her friends
[32:12] that accompany us and and the family
[32:14] members that accompany us.
[32:16] I would like to share with you tell you
[32:19] that our brother Alio,
[32:22] he's not here.
[32:25] This is just like a tabernacle.
[32:30] It's like the shell that's left.
[32:34] Because a true alo
[32:39] he is resting and enjoying the presence
[32:42] of God.
[32:45] If we would to ask him right now,
[32:48] would you like to come back?
[32:53] I would think obviously he would say no
[32:57] to come back into that body again.
[33:02] I don't think that would be right or
[33:03] just for him. That's why my friends
[33:12] this body
[33:14] was taken out of the dust of the earth
[33:18] and into dust it will return
[33:22] that the word of God might be fulfilled.
[33:26] The Bible also says
[33:29] if you hear his voice today
[33:33] No heart in your heart.
[33:37] When God created man,
[33:42] he gave him something so valuable.
[33:47] When he created you and me
[33:50] loved us so much
[33:52] and he gave us something of such great
[33:54] valor,
[33:56] it's free choice, free moral agent.
[34:02] the opportunity that you have to choose.
[34:07] And when God gave us this free will,
[34:11] he loved us so much.
[34:14] Then he counseledled us and gave us
[34:16] counsel.
[34:18] He recommended to us
[34:21] that we would choose life
[34:24] that we might live.
[34:26] Now I ask
[34:30] if we would hear his voice today,
[34:35] harden not your heart.
[34:39] Every time we hear God
[34:41] and we hear his voice
[34:45] and we refuse to obey,
[34:49] our heart gets harder.
[34:55] And when we come to these funerals,
[34:59] God is speaking to us.
[35:02] Now, one of these days, you and me,
[35:05] today it's our brother Alio.
[35:08] He's gone before us. But tomorrow,
[35:12] we don't know. Maybe you or me
[35:16] and the more elder person, the youngest
[35:20] person,
[35:22] death respects no one.
[35:25] That's why
[35:27] if you would hear his voice today,
[35:30] harden not your heart.
[35:33] Are you ready to go with him?
[35:37] Our brother Alio was ready.
[35:41] Before we finish this moment,
[35:45] I would just like to ask you a simple
[35:47] question.
[35:50] If you have not received the the Lord
[35:52] Jesus Christ
[35:54] as your Lord and Savior,
[35:58] I think today would be an opportunity
[36:02] and then we could pray for you.
[36:06] I I want you there just right where
[36:08] you're at,
[36:10] friend,
[36:12] family member.
[36:16] This is not brother Diego speaking.
[36:21] It's God speaking to you through a
[36:23] vessel.
[36:28] What would it be you if it was you
[36:29] tomorrow in this same place?
[36:33] Let's not harden our hearts.
[36:36] I ask someone here
[36:41] that would like to receive our Lord as
[36:43] savior
[36:47] if death would surprise us as we walk
[36:49] out the doors
[36:52] that we could say like our brother Alio,
[36:57] he just simply went home.
[37:01] If you would like for us to pray for
[37:03] you, you could raise your hand.
[37:05] Would you raise your hand?
[37:08] If you would like to receive the Lord
[37:10] Jesus,
[37:12] we would pray for you. It will be an
[37:15] honor.
[37:18] I'm just going to wait a few moments.
[37:22] Would you raise your hand?
[37:28] Our brother Alio,
[37:32] it's been an honor
[37:35] that God lent you to us
[37:40] to be able to share with him
[37:44] so many memories
[37:50] that now are going to be converted into
[37:51] the greatest treasure that we have.
[37:56] If we could finish this service
[37:59] We could say these words,
[38:02] our brother Alio, he's left and gone.
[38:06] He's now at home.
[38:09] But us that remain.
[38:13] And those of us that love him and we
[38:16] appreciate his life
[38:19] and we really respect his memory.
[38:24] Now, we're going to honor his.
[38:27] We're going to respect her
[38:32] and we're gonna embrace her and
[38:34] participate of that respect that we will
[38:36] show her.
[38:38] This is the opportunity
[38:41] to continue showing that respect
[38:44] and respecting the will
[38:47] and respecting her family.
[38:50] This is an opportunity
[38:53] that the family would make things right.
[38:57] and they could come together and be so
[38:59] much stronger together.
[39:02] Let us have a word of prayer.
[39:04] Father, we thank you for this
[39:07] opportunity
[39:10] to be able to express these words
[39:13] to know Lord
[39:15] that one more has made it home.
[39:20] blessed the the widow, her his wife,
[39:23] comforted her heart,
[39:26] her son,
[39:28] even every one of the family,
[39:31] her friends and family that are here and
[39:34] then us that we knew him.
[39:39] Lord, we ask you to take control in the
[39:40] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

[41:29] Loren Perez to please come up and and
[41:31] sing her special.
[42:02] [Music]
[42:16] Oh, you know I need a brand to touch
[42:22] my strength from yesterday is gone.
[42:29] But if you give me Lord another touch,
[42:36] I'll have the strength to carry on.
[42:43] I thought the sun had come to stay.
[42:50] But all too soon it went away.
[42:56] And in his place the storm's cloud came.
[43:03] And with the clouds there came the rain.
[43:11] It rained so hard and all so long.
[43:17] I miss the storm. I felt a calm.
[43:24] It was your touch that brought me
[43:27] through it all.
[43:32] Without your help, I surely fall.
[43:39] Yesterday has come and gone.
[43:46] And now a new day's come along.
[43:53] I do not know what it may bring.
[44:00] My heart may cry instead of sing.
[44:07] But it matters not what comes my way,
[44:12] Lord. Lord,
[44:14] if you just touch me new each day,
[44:21] your loving touch rise all my tears
[44:25] away.
[44:28] Close by your side. I want to stay.
[44:36] Lord, you know how weak I really am.
[44:43] even better than myself.
[44:49] But with your help, I know I really can
[44:56] make it through the darkness night.
[45:00] Everything's going to be all right.
[45:07] Lord, you know I need a brand new touch.
[45:14] My strength from yesterday is gone.
[45:21] But if you give me, Lord, another touch,
[45:28] I'll have the strength to carry on.
[45:38] [Applause]
[45:47] Amen. God bless our sister Lorenna for
[45:49] that beautiful special. We thank her for
[45:52] that. Amen. At this time of the uh this
[45:55] part of the service, we're going to
[45:57] we're going to open up the the service
[45:59] for any family members that would like
[46:00] to come up and and say some words about
[46:03] about our brother here. If anybody would
[46:05] like to come up, um, we're going to try
[46:07] to limit it, uh, to two to three minutes
[46:10] and, uh, we have a a space here
[46:12] designated for for you all to come and
[46:14] come up and say some words. So, whoever
[46:18] would like to come up, we open it up.
[46:33] Thank you.
[46:38] Hello.
[46:43] Would you like to interpret or is it
[46:45] necessary? No, it's not necessary. Thank
[46:47] you.
[46:51] My name is Leo Hakis. I know most of you
[46:53] here. Um, I thank you for being here
[46:58] to pay your last respects to my father
[47:01] and in support of my family and we are
[47:04] very thankful for that. Um, I like to
[47:07] say I'd like to share a few words to
[47:09] honor my dad.
[47:12] My dad had humble beginning. He was born
[47:15] in 1938 on a farm in Chamarino, New
[47:18] Mexico. He had 12 other siblings.
[47:24] Um, his dad grew cotton, alpha alalfa,
[47:28] corn, and that small farm had he always
[47:32] kept one or two pigs in a pig pen, a
[47:35] chicken coupe, and before the tractor,
[47:37] I'm told there was a team of horses as
[47:39] well. So, there was always work to be
[47:42] done on that farm. And boy, did we hear
[47:45] stories about that. Uh, we heard how
[47:50] we heard how it was uncommon for them to
[47:53] have to work from sun up to sun down
[47:55] during the harvest except for when
[47:58] school was in session.
[48:00] And my dad loved school.
[48:03] Not only did it get him off the farm,
[48:06] but he was good at school.
[48:10] For fun. At times he would have his his
[48:13] cousin from Anthony, New Mexico,
[48:17] uh, Ruben Huckkins. He would go and
[48:19] spend the night on the farm. And my dad
[48:22] tell me that they used to climb up into
[48:24] the cotton trailer full of cotton and
[48:27] lay there and tell each other's stories,
[48:31] gazing into the sky, looking at all
[48:34] those stars
[48:36] and uh, catching up on the the goings on
[48:39] in their life.
[48:42] Um,
[48:43] and my dad said at times that's exactly
[48:46] where they slept, right there on in the
[48:48] cotton trailer on top of all that
[48:49] cotton.
[48:52] Um,
[48:57] bear with me.
[49:03] My dad,
[49:05] as I said, he excelled in school.
[49:09] an aunt of mine, my aunt Estelle, she
[49:12] used to tell me, she'd say, "Leo, your
[49:15] dad's a very smart man." Um, he used to
[49:20] go when he went to school, he would
[49:23] finish up his math homework, all the
[49:25] whole book. He'd read through it and
[49:27] finish up all the work. He'd finish it
[49:29] early and then he'd go around and tutor
[49:31] the other students that needed help in
[49:33] their math.
[49:35] My dad excelled.
[49:37] He graduated amongst the top 10 of his
[49:41] graduation class at Gadston High School
[49:44] in 1956.
[49:48] By 1959,
[49:50] he met my mom, fell in love, married
[49:53] her, and joined the Air Force. He
[49:56] continued his
[49:58] his education
[50:00] at Colorado State University through a
[50:03] program sponsored by the Air Force
[50:05] Institute of Technology.
[50:09] He told me to be in that program you had
[50:12] to maintain a 3.0. So he studied
[50:15] diligently
[50:17] and he earned a
[50:20] bachelor of science in mathematics.
[50:25] Upon completion of that, he went on and
[50:28] completed officer training school and
[50:31] after that he was sent to Vietnam during
[50:33] the Vietnam war.
[50:37] That was 1968 to 1969.
[50:41] I was 6 years old in ' 68.
[50:45] Uh but I remember
[50:48] a lot of nights during that year
[50:52] I would turn on the news to Walter
[50:55] Kankite for the evening news to get an
[50:57] update and
[51:00] all the time wondering
[51:05] if my dad's okay and when he's coming
[51:08] home.
[51:13] I also remember how my parents
[51:15] communicated with with each other that
[51:17] year. Of course, there was a lot of
[51:19] letter writing and um they also
[51:23] communicated by realtore tape. I can I
[51:27] can see my mom when she'd get that that
[51:29] tape in the mail and she'd go put it in
[51:32] her recorder
[51:33] and turn the machine on and there would
[51:36] be my dad's voice talking to me, talking
[51:38] to us. And I thought that was really
[51:40] cool. Yeah. Uh,
[51:46] I remember the day he returned from
[51:49] Vietnam.
[51:51] Many of you might remember that was an
[51:52] unpopular war. Not everybody returned.
[51:55] Not every soldier returned to a nice
[51:57] welcome.
[51:58] But my dad's family and my mom's family
[52:02] did him well. He did us proud. It was a
[52:06] big group of us in the El Paso airport.
[52:08] We're there at the gate waiting for him.
[52:12] I can I I remember all the excitement um
[52:16] with with my mom. She was really
[52:17] excited. Another individual stood out
[52:21] that I can remember in my mind. It was
[52:22] my uncle Danny. He was very excited as
[52:26] well. Uncle Danny is my peasant, my
[52:29] cousin Penny's
[52:31] father. She I saw her earlier. She's
[52:33] here with us today. Um
[52:36] but
[52:38] when he walked through into that gate,
[52:42] uh an uproar of cheer and banners rolled
[52:46] out. Welcome home, Emlio.
[52:49] Confetti thrown into the air. It was
[52:52] quite a celebration. I was really happy
[52:54] that my dad was able to experience a
[52:57] welcome home like that. Coming back from
[52:59] that war
[53:01] after Vietnam and after being honorly
[53:04] honor honorably discharged from the Air
[53:06] Force,
[53:09] he continued his education
[53:12] at uh
[53:15] um Colorado State University again.
[53:18] Um and this time he was going on the GI
[53:21] Bill. That's where he earned his master
[53:25] of science degree in physics.
[53:29] at uh
[53:32] and after he earned that degree, he took
[53:34] a job at the White Sands Missile Range.
[53:36] That was 1973.
[53:39] He was hired as a physicist and
[53:42] operations research systems analyst.
[53:46] And at that time, of course, we we were
[53:48] back here and uh we we pretty much
[53:52] became a typical middle class family. My
[53:56] dad would go home every work I mean he'd
[53:57] go to work every workday. My mom stayed
[53:59] at home, kept up the house, saw to it
[54:03] that us kids got to and from school. And
[54:05] during those summers they would take us
[54:07] on family vacations.
[54:10] They took us to places like Disneyland,
[54:16] Yellowstone National Park,
[54:18] um San Diego Zoo. My youngest siblings,
[54:22] they got to see San Jose in San
[54:25] Francisco, California.
[54:29] My dad retired after working at the
[54:32] Missile Range for 20 years. All the time
[54:35] he loved the outdoors and he loved
[54:37] fishing. He was an avid fisherman.
[54:41] He was the guy that would be fishing in
[54:44] the heat of the summer or the cold of
[54:47] the winter or even in the rain.
[54:51] And he and in his retirement, he thought
[54:53] he could do it every day. He'd be out
[54:56] there at winter in the winter in Reoso
[55:00] with an axe chopping a hole in the
[55:02] frozen river, dropping his line in and
[55:05] catching trout.
[55:07] But even though he had a good time, he
[55:10] found himself with too much time on his
[55:12] hands.
[55:14] So he attended post-graduate studies at
[55:17] New Mexico State University.
[55:20] And that's where he earned his New
[55:21] Mexico teaching teaching license.
[55:26] When that finished and when the
[55:28] interviews came, I remember how excited
[55:30] he was with all the offers that he was
[55:32] getting. But he settled on a teaching
[55:35] job as a math teacher at his alma mater,
[55:39] Gadston High School, where he taught for
[55:42] five years.
[55:46] After that he took on a
[55:49] assistant professor position at the
[55:52] Donana Community College where he taught
[55:54] math. He he was equally excited about
[55:57] that job. He really liked the staff and
[56:02] and really enjoyed the group of students
[56:04] that cycled through the community
[56:06] college.
[56:07] He had to stop teaching when the pain in
[56:10] his lower back was too unbearable for
[56:13] having to stand for long periods of time
[56:16] and then he went into full retirement
[56:18] and that that was about 10 years ago.
[56:22] I'm proud of my dad and his
[56:24] accomplishments.
[56:26] He's taught me much in life.
[56:30] My dad had a full life and he
[56:33] accomplished much.
[56:35] All starting from a farm in Chambarino,
[56:38] New Mexico.
[56:40] And I will miss it.
[56:44] As it was stated earlier, this is not
[56:47] goodbye. Amen.
[56:51] This is
[56:54] until I see him again.
[56:56] God's willing
[56:59] in God's presence.
[57:03] I'd like to conclude thanking my family.
[57:10] 11 months ago when my dad fell down and
[57:12] suffered a traumatic brain injury,
[57:17] my wife Diane,
[57:20] she's been there for me and the family
[57:23] and for that I thank you.
[57:26] Thank you.
[57:29] and my mom.
[57:37] What a faithful servant of God. Amen.
[57:40] Amen.
[57:42] whatever facility he was in these last
[57:45] 11 months,
[57:49] the hospitals or the skilled nursing
[57:51] centers here in Los Cusus or the
[57:54] Veterans Home in Truth or Consequences
[57:57] and then finally the El Paso Eltech.
[58:02] She was there
[58:05] always visiting whenever she could,
[58:08] reading the Bible to him, praying for
[58:10] him, praying with him.
[58:13] At times when I was there with some for
[58:17] some of her visits, a peace would set in
[58:20] and he would just peacefully fall asleep
[58:23] for a little while and it was very
[58:25] beautiful. Thank you, Mom.
[58:27] my sister Ivonne.
[58:30] Oh, the calls,
[58:33] all those calls to the insurance
[58:35] company, the case managers, and the
[58:37] hospital staff trying to keep it all
[58:40] straight and keep it running smooth. It
[58:44] was quite a job for her. And my sister
[58:47] Melissa,
[58:48] she's the registered nurse of the
[58:50] family. She helped us with
[58:53] all the lingo jargon, helped us
[58:56] understand what the doctors were saying
[58:58] and what the nurses were saying. It
[59:01] really was helpful when we had to make
[59:03] those hard decisions together. My two
[59:06] sisters,
[59:09] they had many conversations with
[59:13] hospital staff, doctors.
[59:16] Some of those conversations were good
[59:19] and I'm told some of them were pretty
[59:20] heated. All in
[59:24] advocating for the best care for my
[59:26] father.
[59:28] My brother Robert, he moved into the
[59:31] family home last fall as early as he
[59:33] could. And he's been there helping my
[59:36] mom. My mom's 89 years old. Her knees
[59:40] are weak. She can't lift anything heavy
[59:42] anymore. So he's there to help her
[59:45] inside, outside the house, keep her
[59:48] company, talk with her, watch TV shows
[59:51] with her, accompany her to the grocery
[59:54] store. And for that, I'm very thankful,
[59:56] Robert.
[59:58] With all that they did, it sounds like I
[1:00:00] did nothing.
[1:00:03] You did, but I filled in everywhere I
[1:00:06] could.
[1:00:08] 11 months ago, we came together as a
[1:00:11] team, advocating for dad as best we
[1:00:15] could, taking care of mom.
[1:00:18] Now, we must remain that team, taking
[1:00:22] care of ourselves, taking care of each
[1:00:24] other, taking care of mom. Yes, sir.
[1:00:30] And also, I almost forgot, my two
[1:00:33] brothers-in-law, Kenny, married to
[1:00:36] Ivonne. Chris, Mary to Melissa,
[1:00:40] anything we needed, you guys were there
[1:00:42] to volunteer. You guys have been a real
[1:00:44] help. Thank you.
[1:00:47] The rest of you, you come here to pay
[1:00:50] your respects in support of the family.
[1:00:53] We are profoundly thankful.
[1:00:56] God bless you all. God bless you, sir.
[1:01:04] Amen. Amen. And God bless the brother
[1:01:06] for those precious kind words. Beautiful
[1:01:09] words. Amen. Amen. Amen. Is anybody else
[1:01:12] that would like to come up and say some
[1:01:14] words?

[1:02:20] but he he had respect for everyone but

[1:02:47] uh going to many dinners with the family
[1:02:50] that I, you know, I finally started
[1:02:51] like, well, okay, maybe this is the day,
[1:02:54] you know. And I said, uh, hey, Dad,
[1:02:57] how's it going? And I was like, "Oo, I

[1:03:24] very very uh for me and and respected
[1:03:28] me. And he's he's helped me uh many
[1:03:30] times when I was going to school, you
[1:03:32] know, with math because this guy was a
[1:03:34] math wiz. Uh, I was not the sharpest
[1:03:38] tool in the the toolbox with math, but
[1:03:41] in many times he was able to get me
[1:03:44] through a lot of that, but I I know I
[1:03:46] want to try to keep this short, but I
[1:03:48] did want to talk uh with Ivonne has a
[1:03:52] ride up here. Uh, she had hurt her knee.
[1:03:55] She recently just fell and hit her knee
[1:03:57] and she can't come up these stairs. But
[1:04:00] these are words from from Ivonne.
[1:04:04] Dad, I miss you more than words can
[1:04:06] express. I miss our conversations and
[1:04:09] our moments spent simply enjoying each
[1:04:12] other's company. I treasure them all. I
[1:04:15] think about the stories you and mom told
[1:04:17] me, especially the one about your early
[1:04:20] days struggling to make ends meet while
[1:04:23] making sure I never went without. I
[1:04:26] loved hearing about your life on the
[1:04:27] farm and your years in the Air Force and
[1:04:30] the values you instilled in me. I miss
[1:04:33] taking care of you, helping w with
[1:04:35] whatever you needed. I miss your voice,
[1:04:38] your smile, your laughter, the way you
[1:04:42] could brighten a room just by being
[1:04:43] yourself.
[1:04:45] I miss visiting you and sharing time
[1:04:47] together. More than anything, I just
[1:04:50] miss you. You are a wonderful father,
[1:04:53] and I'm forever grateful for everything
[1:04:55] you gave me. Your love, your unwavering
[1:04:58] strength.
[1:05:00] You will always be in my heart and in my
[1:05:02] thoughts. Being your daughter is the
[1:05:05] greatest honor of my life. And I will
[1:05:07] carry your love with me always. I will
[1:05:10] love you forever. And until we until we
[1:05:13] meet on that great high mountain, I will
[1:05:15] hold you close in spirit.
[1:05:19] That's it. Thank you.
[1:05:21] [Applause]
[1:05:26] Amen. Thank you for those kind words as
[1:05:28] well. Anybody else?
[1:05:34] Okay, at this time we're going to we're
[1:05:36] going to be playing a video at this
[1:05:37] time.
[1:05:40] Sorry, sister. I'm sorry. See,
[1:06:02] I'm going to miss my husband very much.
[1:06:05] He was a good provider.
[1:06:12] I'll never forget
[1:06:15] every year
[1:06:17] in the summer when he would take a
[1:06:20] vacation from work,
[1:06:23] he would ask me,
[1:06:25] "Where do you guys want to go this
[1:06:27] summer on vacation?" So, we think about
[1:06:30] it, you know. Finally, we decided where
[1:06:33] to go.
[1:06:36] He was a good man.
[1:06:40] We had good times
[1:06:43] and bad times too. We all do.
[1:06:48] But he was a very
[1:06:52] caring person.
[1:06:54] He loved his children.
[1:06:57] He loved us all.
[1:07:00] He provided for us
[1:07:03] very good. He was a good provider. I'll
[1:07:06] never forget that.
[1:07:08] I can't complain about that.
[1:07:14] Well, he was in the hospital.
[1:07:18] I used to go there and
[1:07:22] and I we would talk to him,
[1:07:26] but he was hard of hearing.
[1:07:30] So the only way we could talk to him was
[1:07:32] we would take a tablet and write what we
[1:07:36] wanted to say.
[1:07:38] And I would uh I would ask him before we
[1:07:42] would leave,
[1:07:44] do you want me to read for you to you?
[1:07:47] and he would nod his head cuz I would
[1:07:50] read the Bible to him
[1:07:52] different
[1:07:55] the chapters of course books in the
[1:07:57] Bible and he would just sit there he
[1:08:00] would lay there and close his eyes very
[1:08:03] peacefully
[1:08:06] sometimes he would fall asleep on us
[1:08:09] but
[1:08:13] I am so happy and so glad
[1:08:16] because we
[1:08:19] He was gone from home for nine months
[1:08:24] off and on
[1:08:26] when we had him at one time at home we
[1:08:29] had caregivers
[1:08:31] and I would still read the word to him.
[1:08:34] I would make time.
[1:08:36] We used to spend time like that.
[1:08:43] We'd pray and we pray that the Lord will
[1:08:46] bring him home so he could spend a
[1:08:48] little time with us.
[1:08:52] Well, okay, we pray for a miracle.
[1:08:55] But you know what?
[1:08:58] We're going to miss him very much.
[1:09:02] But I thank the Lord and I praise him
[1:09:06] that he accepted the Lord
[1:09:10] sometime last year
[1:09:12] or maybe before then.
[1:09:15] And
[1:09:17] one day me and sister Bertha went to the
[1:09:20] hospital
[1:09:21] and I told her I said Bertha
[1:09:26] let's talk to him about the Lord. Let's
[1:09:28] let's see if he will
[1:09:31] rededicate his life.
[1:09:33] That's what we did.
[1:09:36] Bertha, sister Bertha talked to him and
[1:09:40] again we made sure
[1:09:43] that he will rededicate his life. He
[1:09:45] did. And so now I told the Lord, "Okay,
[1:09:49] Father,
[1:09:51] I'm going to miss my husband very much.
[1:09:54] But you know what, Father?
[1:09:57] I'm so happy and so glad that he's there
[1:09:59] with you. The night that they I that
[1:10:03] Friday we had gone to visit him.
[1:10:06] He was okay.
[1:10:08] Like I told brother Caleb, I don't
[1:10:10] understand brother Caleb.
[1:10:13] We went to see him today.
[1:10:16] He was good. He was in good spirits. We
[1:10:20] made him laugh.
[1:10:23] And
[1:10:25] and now they called us and tell us he's
[1:10:28] gone.
[1:10:30] And I said, "Okay."
[1:10:33] Anyway,
[1:10:36] I am so happy and so glad.
[1:10:39] Then that same night, we were all in my
[1:10:42] house, my children
[1:10:45] crying, of course,
[1:10:48] and my daughter Balissa hugged me. She
[1:10:51] put her arms around me and as she did,
[1:10:56] the Lord spoke to me and said, "He's
[1:10:59] here with me." I said, "Lord, I told
[1:11:03] them, the Lord just told me he's there
[1:11:07] with him." So, we all praised him and
[1:11:10] thank the Lord for it. And she said,
[1:11:12] "Mom," she said, "the told me to hug
[1:11:14] you."
[1:11:16] I praise God for that
[1:11:19] because though he's going to be gone
[1:11:21] someday, we'll see him. Yes. And I'm so
[1:11:25] glad and happy
[1:11:27] that he's with the Lord.
[1:11:30] Praise be to God. I never gave up
[1:11:33] praying for his salvation.
[1:11:36] There were thoughts when there were
[1:11:38] times when I thought he would ever come
[1:11:39] come to know the Lord and he did. Praise
[1:11:42] God. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:11:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:49] Thank you, Jesus, that he's there with
[1:11:52] you, not suffering anymore.
[1:11:55] Praise you, Lord Jesus. Thank you. Thank
[1:11:58] you, Lord.
[1:12:06] What a faithful lady. Amen. Wow.
[1:12:10] Amen. Amen. This time we're going to be
[1:12:12] watching a video. If we could please get
[1:12:14] the lights.
[1:12:17] Immediately following after the video,
[1:12:18] we will be having our closing prayer by
[1:12:20] by our brother uh Daniel Martinez.

[1:13:35] relief.
[1:13:40] How precious
[1:13:42] dear
[1:13:44] that grace
[1:13:46] appear
[1:13:48] the hour
[1:13:51] I first
[1:13:53] believe
[1:13:57] through many
[1:14:00] dangerous
[1:14:02] toils
[1:14:04] and snares
[1:14:06] I have
[1:14:09] already
[1:14:11] come.

[1:14:17] hath brought
[1:14:20] me safe
[1:14:22] thus far
[1:14:24] and grace
[1:14:26] will lead
[1:14:29] me home.
[1:14:33] The Lord
[1:14:36] has promised
[1:14:39] good
[1:14:40] to me.
[1:14:43] His word, my hope,
[1:14:47] seek your poor
[1:14:51] be.
[1:14:53] As long
[1:14:55] as life
[1:14:57] endures.

[1:15:04] this flesh and heart
[1:15:08] shall fail
[1:15:11] and move
[1:15:13] to life shall cease.
[1:15:20] I shall
[1:15:22] posess
[1:15:24] within
[1:15:26] the veil
[1:15:29] the life
[1:15:31] of joy
[1:15:33] and peace.
[1:15:38] The earth
[1:15:40] shall soon
[1:15:43] desolve
[1:15:45] like snow.

[1:15:50] for bear
[1:15:52] to shine.
