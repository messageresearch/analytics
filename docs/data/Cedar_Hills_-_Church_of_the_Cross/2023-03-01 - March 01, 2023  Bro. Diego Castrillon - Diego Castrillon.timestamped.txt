[45:17] I invite you if you can stand to your
[45:19] feet
[45:21] let us honor the word of the Lord
[45:28] the scripture says Matthew 5 verse 8.

[46:14] [Music]
[46:16] senior activated
[46:21] that you inspired through thy precious
[46:23] son the Lord Jesus
[46:25] these words
[46:30] gave us the inspiration
[46:33] break the bread
[46:36] and that we may be able to leave from
[46:39] this place better
[46:40] Lord we praise you and the numbers
[46:43] in the name of the Lord Jesus is our
[46:45] prayer
[46:47] go ahead and take your seat is
[47:02] to a people that one day gave their
[47:05] hearts to the Lord okay
[47:09] people that say we are Christians
[47:13] because we want to be like Christ
[47:16] and not only do you want to be like this
[47:20] but we want to see God
[47:23] I am a Christian because I want to see
[47:26] God
[47:27] I want to see him
[47:30] that saved me that died on the cross
[47:34] foreign
[47:42] [Music]
[47:51] [Music]
[47:59] these are the words of Jesus
[48:02] that they are who are going to see Jesus
[48:06] are they that are pure in heart
[48:09] now the word pure
[48:13] get a holy
[48:16] son those who have a holy
[48:18] the word holy this is
[48:21] brother Branham says
[48:25] set aside for service
[48:28] it means consecrated
[48:33] Sanctified holy
[48:37] has been dedicated
[48:43] blessed are the pure in Hearts
[48:52] those who have dedicated their heart to
[48:55] the Lord
[49:02] let us turn to Isaiah 57.
[49:05] so that we can put our context here
[49:13] Isaiah 57 15.
[49:20] I was thinking about speaking on faith
[49:24] I wanted to continue that line of Faith
[49:28] but the Lord at this evening had put
[49:31] this on my heart
[49:33] and I pray that it can be a help for
[49:35] everyone
[49:36] so here is a prophet Isaiah
[49:42] Isaiah 57 15.
[49:45] now listen to these words
[49:48] and how it is
[50:33] it says stand to your feet
[50:36] that now you can doubt it peroci El
[50:39] Presidente now now if the president
[50:43] it says the president of the United
[50:45] States
[50:49] that has all the armies of the United
[50:51] States
[50:53] he says to stand to your feet
[50:56] You're Gonna Stand to your face
[51:04] eternity listen
[51:10] I inhabit
[51:14] now who is saying this
[51:19] is
[51:25] telling you that we're here
[51:28] now I want to know where he abides
[51:38] whose name is Holy I dwell in the high
[51:41] and holy place
[52:16] in holiness
[52:20] in
[52:33] EPA he wanted to know that that one
[52:36] Israel to know
[52:38] and we see it here in Leviticus 11 verse
[52:42] 45.
[52:47] Leviticus 11 45 says
[52:50] I want to run but I can't
[52:53] I I gave glory to God
[52:56] he has control yes
[52:58] important that is the most important
[53:01] thing is
[53:03] Leviticus 11 45.
[53:07] for I am the Lord
[53:11] that bringeth you up out of the land of
[53:14] Egypt
[53:15] listen
[53:22] God is talking to his children the
[53:24] people of Israel
[53:27] to be your God
[53:33] ye shall therefore be holy foreign
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:32] God
[55:08] is
[56:43] your prophet
[56:46] Isaiah
[58:04] that one day God became flesh
[58:07] that all that God was
[58:11] that he poured it into a Tabernacle
[58:14] Jesus called Jesus
[58:17] Christ Jesus the scripture says
[58:19] blessings
[58:57] this place
[59:00] has been consecrated
[59:02] this piece of land
[59:05] you and I could be here
[59:08] this is the first place
[59:11] was first consecrated
[59:14] because there has to be a holy spirit
[59:16] this place is
[59:34] we have to come in holiness
[59:41] if we come to preach
[59:48] the ministers
[59:54] we are a special class
[59:58] we are some greater than others
[1:00:02] a class that God has chosen foreign
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:01:15] that's why there has to be Holiness
[1:01:18] brother Branham says
[1:01:28] power Brothers
[1:01:33] the Bible says
[1:01:36] we should go from Victory to victory
[1:01:41] in the Rota sometimes
[1:01:46] the question is
[1:01:54] for they shall see God
[1:01:57] come on
[1:02:01] How could somebody come and sing
[1:02:05] if you were not consecrated it is
[1:02:09] the ministers it is a privilege when
[1:02:14] Jesus I say
[1:02:17] when he made that beautiful prayer it is
[1:02:21] a padre and he says father foreign for
[1:02:24] them
[1:02:25] foreign
[1:02:55] my older brother
[1:03:32] the first thing they're going to say is
[1:04:10] now when you enter through those doors
[1:04:13] foreign
[1:04:55] the scripture says immoral I dwell
[1:05:01] and the Brokenhearted
[1:05:06] the hearts that are criticizing and
[1:05:09] murmuring
[1:05:10] in the Brokenhearted
[1:05:13] through those doors
[1:05:42] because I came to see God foreign
[1:05:47] Iglesia
[1:05:51] that's why I don't talk in church
[1:05:54] that's why I don't get my phone to make
[1:05:56] phone calls in the church
[1:05:59] because this is my living room
[1:06:05] here
[1:06:09] people come here to receive
[1:06:12] you don't hear that people want to see
[1:06:14] God
[1:06:17] when you come back with a broken heart
[1:06:20] with a pure heart
[1:06:24] you shall see God
[1:06:30] how can you sit in this views
[1:06:33] and have something against your brother
[1:06:36] something against your sister
[1:06:41] when it has been preached on that what
[1:06:44] an embarrassment
[1:06:49] I'm gonna finish
[1:06:57] I don't know what brother Caleb had in
[1:06:59] his heart
[1:07:00] or a head in his heart
[1:07:03] ahead in his heart
[1:07:07] when
[1:07:12] he tried to challenge Moses the servant
[1:07:14] of God
[1:07:15] and when you read the Bible
[1:07:19] and you're going to see that that the
[1:07:21] the words of quora brings us
[1:07:24] Moses we are also holy qures
[1:07:28] because Cora knew that God moved in
[1:07:31] holiness
[1:07:43] but you know what scares me about Korra
[1:07:46] okay
[1:07:47] that he had the capacity they
[1:07:52] not only to resist Moses
[1:07:59] but but to deceive 150 people are with
[1:08:03] them
[1:08:08] you see what happens when you say I'm
[1:08:10] not in agreement with them
[1:08:12] I'm not here to be in agreement
[1:08:15] I am here because I believe the words
[1:08:20] I I come here because I believe God
[1:08:26] I come here because I believe you and my
[1:08:29] brothers and sisters
[1:08:36] [Music]
[1:08:52] to preach
[1:08:54] ERS
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:04] the one of Moses
[1:09:10] the spirits don't die
[1:09:17] he criticized he was jealous
[1:09:22] it's the same thing the spirits don't
[1:09:25] die
[1:09:26] but the thing did not stay there
[1:09:30] Moses
[1:09:33] he stood for Moses for for quora yeah
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:09:39] children
[1:10:17] solamente
[1:10:19] Murio
[1:10:22] and only those that were murmuring died
[1:10:26] the the children of corridoro salmos
[1:10:33] and you read it there in the Psalms and
[1:10:35] such beautiful Psalms and with the gifts
[1:10:37] that the children of Korah had
[1:10:40] because the children of course
[1:10:43] never stood
[1:10:47] they never stood and backed up that
[1:10:49] murmuring
[1:10:51] it's their brothers
[1:11:05] we have lowered the bar of Holiness with
[1:11:09] what we have
[1:11:10] we cannot do it
[1:11:13] you have to be sure

[1:12:05] because that is the way we can help them
[1:12:08] it is
[1:12:19] a man so so humble
[1:12:23] ingredients
[1:12:24] I'm not making the man great
