[28:50] good good evening God bless
[28:55] you I'm surprised
[29:02] uh not not that I didn't know it wasn't
[29:03] gonna happen but that happened so
[29:07] fast I was visiting the pastor during
[29:09] the
[29:12] week and he said that he was uh inspired
[29:15] by God and he wanted to do something
[29:20] different he was sitting on one side of
[29:22] the table and I was sitting on the other
[29:24] side of the table with our
[29:26] families and during the our conversation
[29:29] he said what do you think
[29:32] he he said he said big Fred is all do
[29:36] you think you can
[29:40] speak at the moment say an hour or
[29:51] two I was Brave at the moment but on the
[29:54] way home I like oh what am I going to do
[29:56] yeah
[30:00] I spoke with my
[30:01] wife and brother
[30:06] Loreno he said told Brother Cale was
[30:09] saying
[30:10] this and he said if he said Saturday
[30:13] it's GNA be
[30:17] Saturday I understand that he was saying
[30:19] that but I don't think
[30:21] so and I I wrote him yesterday I texted
[30:24] him
[30:26] yesterday I said
[30:28] I said brother Caleb I want to ask you
[30:30] something just to be
[30:34] sure he said I know you asked me to
[30:40] speak is it for this Saturday or for
[30:42] next
[30:44] Saturday and some time
[30:51] passed he
[30:53] said where he responded he said let me
[30:56] do the itinerary and I'll get back with
[30:57] you
[31:00] okay
[31:03] when I relaxed a little bit I said okay
[31:05] know I I have some
[31:07] time I had a few other things to
[31:11] do but this
[31:13] morning I got a phone call from Tommy
[31:19] junor and it's not very uh it's not very
[31:21] often that I had received that phone
[31:26] call I didn't answer at the moment but I
[31:29] then I returned his phone
[31:35] call and he told me oh well brother
[31:37] Caleb is asking if you can speak for
[31:38] about 20 minutes this
[31:41] afternoon I said sure that's
[31:50] fine and and obedience we're here to
[31:56] speak I have you down here in a moment
[31:58] let us read the word
[32:01] first second
[32:03] Corinthians
[32:05] 4 verse
[32:09] six and the word of God says this
[32:30] for God who commanded the light to shine
[32:32] out of Darkness hath shined in our
[32:34] hearts to give the light of knowledge of
[32:37] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[32:43] Christ may the Lord add His blessings to
[32:45] the reading of the word now you may be
[32:51] seated it's not very common that I stand
[32:54] behind
[32:56] here forgive me and be patient with
[33:01] me and we just want that the Lord
[33:05] speak that it may not be me but it may
[33:07] be
[33:09] him before I
[33:11] start I I want to
[33:16] pray Heavenly Father we give you
[33:19] thanks Lord for the
[33:24] life Lord for you have provided a place
[33:26] so we can come and worship you
[33:29] Lord put me to a
[33:32] side and may it be you speaking to your
[33:36] people Lord as a testimony of what you
[33:39] have done
[33:40] through Lord because of ourselves we are
[33:46] nothing Lord but it is simply that you
[33:48] have put your eyes on
[33:49] us we give you
[33:51] thanks then we
[33:53] ask ask this in the name of the Lord
[33:55] Jesus Christ
[34:04] the reason why I uh this scripture
[34:07] caught my attention was the word
[34:08] Darkness caught my
[34:14] attention and I know that the word
[34:16] darkness is mentioned various times in
[34:18] the
[34:20] scripture and something that I've had
[34:22] for many
[34:26] years that the what the word Darkness
[34:31] means it's the the lack of lackness of
[34:36] light ignorance or
[34:39] confusion for lack of
[34:43] knowledge and uh I read this because
[34:45] there's a reason behind
[34:50] it I believe that my walk with the Lord
[34:53] was already set before the foundation of
[34:54] the
[34:56] world but came a time where it had to be
[34:58] made
[35:04] manifest and my walk with the Lord it
[35:06] became started some years
[35:10] back to be exact it was 23
[35:14] years it's it's we say it uh
[35:19] Loosely but I thank the Lord for those
[35:24] years because he has allowed me to know
[35:27] him
[35:30] and to be able to allow me to see
[35:33] him and he has allowed me to serve
[35:37] him and the way I was I encountered
[35:42] myself uh before I I I came
[35:46] here was I was a completely different
[35:54] person and that's why I read the
[35:56] scripture and how it mentions the word
[35:59] Darkness because I was in
[36:02] darkness I was in in
[36:05] confusion and lack and and lack of
[36:10] light but when that light began to shine
[36:13] in me it wasn't of of
[36:16] myself it was that at that
[36:19] time through our brother
[36:22] Fidel which is he is my brother in the
[36:25] flesh
[36:29] um I uh through him I began to feel
[36:32] something inside of
[36:36] me and I have to be sincere I didn't
[36:38] know what it was because at that time I
[36:40] I didn't know the
[36:43] message and we uh you're raised and you
[36:45] grew up in
[36:49] Traditions and I didn't know nothing
[36:51] about the word of
[36:54] God but at that time
[36:58] I was no longer a a little boy of 10
[37:01] years
[37:02] old I was 23 24 years
[37:07] old but as we have
[37:10] learned as they has been told
[37:15] us but as we have heard that this flesh
[37:18] is going to be real
[37:21] comfortable and I say this because
[37:23] Freddy In the
[37:25] Flesh at that time
[37:28] he didn't need
[37:31] anything he was fine where he was
[37:35] at he had a good
[37:42] job he didn't have the uh luxurious
[37:46] things but he was
[37:48] fine but that was according to the
[37:52] flesh now Freddy in the spirit he needed
[37:55] all things he needed everything
[37:58] because he was
[38:05] empty it was at that time that I felt
[38:07] the necessity to speak with my
[38:11] brother during that time brother Fidel
[38:13] he was already here in the the United
[38:18] States and not to take so much
[38:23] time a few I spoke to him a few times
[38:28] and I would tell him I want to go over
[38:33] there as a young man as a single young
[38:36] man my intentions were for something
[38:42] else but I knew that the Lord had other
[38:44] intentions for
[38:48] me at that moment like as I said I
[38:50] didn't know what it
[38:54] was I would be a liar if I said oh I
[38:57] felt this or I felt
[38:59] that no I simply want to be
[39:03] sincere I was ignorant of those
[39:11] things but in my heart I felt in me that
[39:14] I wanted something
[39:17] different and those who know brother
[39:20] Fidel
[39:32] during at that time brother Fidel he
[39:35] personally worked with uh with brother
[39:39] Tomas and if if there's something that
[39:41] he's got he's always been
[39:46] obedient if I'm gonna move this water
[39:51] bottle he's always going to consult it
[39:53] before he moves
[39:56] it and uh at that time that that's what
[40:01] happened and every phone call I he would
[40:03] tell me wait just a little bit but the
[40:07] the day
[40:09] came he said yes you're you're going to
[40:13] come he said but you know the life that
[40:15] I
[40:18] live it's no longer the life I used to
[40:20] live before here it is something
[40:25] different and that's what captured my
[40:27] attention about brother
[40:30] Fidel and the it was the way that the
[40:33] life that they
[40:35] lived
[40:37] I I I was
[40:47] different I I knew that in them was was
[40:50] something
[40:51] different that's when I began to look at
[40:54] the
[40:55] thing that's and that's at that time is
[40:57] when I began to
[41:00] say I I would say as I want what they
[41:04] have because it has to be a personal
[41:07] revelation it has to be something
[41:12] personal it can't be something that
[41:13] you're just GNA
[41:18] say and that's when I came here to this
[41:22] country and I have to give thanks to
[41:24] this country
[41:27] because this country has opened the
[41:28] doors for
[41:32] me and and I say this because it's been
[41:34] many years have
[41:37] passed and this is the best thing that
[41:39] has happened to in my
[41:43] life because in this throughout this
[41:46] process I began to know the
[41:48] Lord in this process and this
[41:55] time I I found out that the problems
[41:58] that there are no
[42:00] coincidences and to the
[42:05] youth I I believe that you haven't
[42:12] made you don't understand that many
[42:14] things that what happens to as a like as
[42:16] a as a for somebody that's a
[42:22] father and I want to impart to you
[42:24] something personal
[42:27] but I'm going to share
[42:30] it not just not so you can feel sorry
[42:33] for
[42:34] me because we're not here to uh
[42:40] Sor sentiment is really
[42:43] nothing it doesn't do nothing to
[42:46] God and he he knows the heart of each
[42:51] person throughout those 23 years
[42:58] um I'm G look see somebody and see if
[43:01] their parents are
[43:03] here James brother
[43:10] James are your parents here yes go give
[43:14] them a
[43:17] [Applause]
[43:26] hug I'm going to ask
[43:29] you how how did that
[43:34] feel how did how did it feel to be able
[43:36] to hug them to touch
[43:41] them glory to
[43:46] God glory to God because you they're
[43:48] here with you they're close to you in
[43:51] that process
[43:52] [Music]
[43:58] I haven't been able to to touch my mom
[44:01] or
[44:01] to or to hug my mom like like he just
[44:06] did but that sacrifice hasn't been in
[44:11] vain it's been that sacrifice has been
[44:15] worth it for
[44:17] [Applause]
[44:19] you because he paid a price for
[44:25] us but that there is is a promise that
[44:27] God has given
[44:30] me that if I can't hug her here on
[44:36] Earth and but I'll be able to hug her in
[44:38] a place that is
[44:39] [Applause]
[44:42] better because we are fighting for
[44:47] them and that's I simply just want to
[44:50] say that that God has been
[44:54] great and he has been merciful to me
[44:58] and I say that
[45:01] because and I haven't testified and I've
[45:03] and I've been embarrassed of
[45:06] it a year ago I broke my
[45:12] foot and it was something that I thought
[45:14] would never
[45:17] happen but there was a motive and there
[45:19] was a reason why it
[45:20] happened and I'm glad that it
[45:25] happened because I had an accident at
[45:29] home I I
[45:33] fell I practically broke my foot in
[45:40] half and the doctors would tell me well
[45:42] it's it's not going to be the
[45:50] same and the doctors told me that I
[45:52] would have 60 to 70% of a mobility in my
[45:54] foot
[45:58] but I I didn't depend on the
[46:00] doctors I depended on
[46:04] God because he told me that I was going
[46:06] to be
[46:08] fine and now I can say that I am
[46:11] fine the Affliction of the
[46:14] flesh is uh you feel the
[46:18] pain but I have cried
[46:20] out and I have said have confessed I am
[46:25] fine because the word has been
[46:29] spoken and that's where I maintain
[46:34] myself I am a man of few
[46:37] words that is not an
[46:41] impediment to it's not an impediment to
[46:44] give thanks unto
[46:48] God because here we we know each other
[46:51] some by
[46:54] name the sisters of sisters and the
[46:56] brothers with the brother
[46:59] but I remember brother William he preach
[47:02] he preached on the message
[47:05] experiences how are you going to know
[47:07] your brother or your
[47:10] sister or how are you going to know your
[47:12] brother or your sister if you don't know
[47:13] what has happened to them you don't
[47:15] know we see each other here for so so
[47:18] much
[47:20] time and I say for myself to you with
[47:24] respect
[47:27] do we really know each
[47:35] other we we haven't had Fellowship yeah
[47:40] and and I simply just want to
[47:44] say that each and every one of you have
[47:48] in one way or another have helped
[47:52] me you see me here working here in the
[47:55] church
[47:58] but but
[47:59] I I don't do that so I can look good I
[48:01] do it for
[48:04] God and I do it for him because I feel
[48:06] that desire inside of
[48:09] me I want to give you thanks for your
[48:12] your backup
[48:15] your
[48:19] support and if this is has been able to
[48:22] help your walk glory to God
[48:27] that it may not be me that it may be God
[48:30] that where I may be able to help you
[48:31] this
[48:32] evening because great testimonies God
[48:34] has given us our
[48:38] lives and I I believe it's time to to
[48:40] manifest
[48:42] that manifest what God has done for each
[48:44] and every one of
[48:47] us to to continue on the
[48:50] battle as our Pastor
[48:53] said not as a
[48:55] team but as a
[48:57] body because we are a
[49:00] [Music]
[49:02] body and the body is formed of many
[49:07] members and if I am a part of the body
[49:09] that you don't
[49:12] see and hopefully I can be that part to
[49:15] uh to push that you can see that other
[49:17] part
[49:19] so and that's what I wanted to
[49:23] share I forgive me
[49:30] forgive me
[49:31] that forgive me that's all uh it was so
[49:34] short but it was God's time not my time
[49:37] God bless you
[49:46] [Applause]
[50:11] all right put my timer on all right good
[50:14] evening church God bless
[50:16] you amen I'm so happy and blessed to be
[50:19] here
[50:21] tonight so amazed how God works
[50:27] this morning as I was getting ready to
[50:29] go for a
[50:32] run I was putting my shoes on I was
[50:35] praying and thanking God for everything
[50:37] that he has done for
[50:42] me and I was asking him to keep using me
[50:46] and show me what to do to help
[50:53] others and that's when I got got a text
[50:56] message from a
[51:00] friend and he said Marcus I've seen what
[51:03] you know your change and what you've
[51:05] been
[51:08] doing and I wanted to ask you if it's
[51:11] okay if I come over to your
[51:15] church and just as I was going to tell
[51:17] him to come tomorrow for
[51:22] service I get a call from Brother Tommy
[51:27] asking me if I you know if I would be
[51:29] sharing testimony
[51:33] tonight and then I tell my friend you
[51:35] know what we're having service tonight
[51:36] so they're here tonight and I want to
[51:37] welcome
[51:39] [Applause]
[51:43] them so before I get started let me just
[51:46] ask you a
[51:49] question how lucky and blessed are we to
[51:52] have a god of Second Chances
[51:59] and if God has ever given you a second
[52:01] chance can I get an
[52:04] amen sometimes it's even three four five
[52:08] 10 100
[52:13] chances and he's always there ready to
[52:15] forgive us ready to help
[52:19] us and I want to start with this
[52:24] verse Jeremiah
[52:27] in 2911 under the new
[52:32] version and it
[52:36] reads for I know the plans that I have
[52:39] for
[52:42] you declares the
[52:44] Lord plans to prosper you and not to
[52:47] harm
[52:50] you plans to give you hope in a future
[52:56] God add his Blessing to his
[52:59] word now I want to do a small
[53:03] prayer heavenly father thank you thank
[53:06] you for this beautiful
[53:09] day thank you for my brothers and
[53:12] sisters for my
[53:15] pastor and for the second chance that
[53:17] you've given in my
[53:20] life for fulfilling the
[53:23] promise that you will take our test
[53:28] and turn it into a
[53:31] testimony and be it
[53:34] tonight let the words the right words
[53:37] come
[53:38] out so that anybody sitting here
[53:42] tonight anybody
[53:45] online may find those words of
[53:49] Hope and know that there is a
[53:53] way that you are the way
[53:57] we love you and we thank
[53:59] you and I believe God has has two
[54:02] stories in our life there's two stories
[54:04] in our
[54:07] life there is God's story for our
[54:12] life and then there's the story that the
[54:14] enemy wants to sell
[54:18] you and I stand here
[54:22] tonight to share with you the story that
[54:24] God gave me
[54:28] not the one that the devil was trying to
[54:30] sell
[54:32] me uh I got married at the age of
[54:37] 18 I became a father by
[54:42] 19 and in my
[54:46] 20s I said I worked pretty hard was a
[54:50] hard
[54:52] worker growing up I always seen my
[54:54] parents struggle
[54:58] and I always said I want to have a
[55:00] better future for my
[55:03] family so I left school and started my
[55:07] business and I worked and worked Monday
[55:10] through
[55:13] Sundays and then in my 30s I thought I
[55:16] had made
[55:19] it I was living the
[55:22] life um I was getting to travel
[55:28] uh going to conference opening
[55:32] businesses and it was when the devil
[55:35] came right first he comes to what to
[55:40] steal so he came put me in the wrong
[55:45] groups starting
[55:47] partying and he will whisper in my ear
[55:50] and
[55:51] say hey Marcos you deserve this
[55:56] you've worked so hard in your 20s you
[55:58] didn't
[56:02] party now it's time to
[56:06] party and that one thing led to another
[56:12] thing and I found
[56:15] myself and hurting my loved
[56:19] ones you know I found myself consuming
[56:22] drugs on a daily basis
[56:27] lying to my
[56:29] family lying to my
[56:32] wife and just letting the devil sell me
[56:35] the the
[56:39] dream and what I found out my
[56:42] friends is that the devil makes you
[56:44] believe that he's adding something to
[56:47] your
[56:50] life but what he's really doing is he's
[56:53] subtracting something for your life
[56:58] but you see with God is the
[57:01] opposite with God he he first
[57:05] subtracts he says You must leave this
[57:08] you must get away from
[57:10] this he
[57:12] [Applause]
[57:14] multiplies so you know I was coming back
[57:18] from a trip uh from a conference from
[57:23] Utah and I had a connection flight in
[57:25] Las
[57:31] vasas and it was bad weather so the
[57:34] plane was going to be delayed for 10
[57:39] hours and my luggage was carrying my my
[57:43] medication I was say
[57:47] medication it's not prescribed
[57:52] medication and at this point I was
[57:55] already consuming six seven pills a
[57:59] day and I was at the at the airport and
[58:03] I I was sitting in the shirt and I
[58:04] started shaking I
[58:12] needed and as the hours went by things
[58:15] started getting worse I started feeling
[58:17] my heart going
[58:22] fast I got out of the share laid in the
[58:25] in the ground
[58:28] and I was
[58:30] shaking in Desperate
[58:35] mode and I was afraid that I was going
[58:37] to
[58:39] die and I pray and I say God please
[58:43] please help me get through
[58:48] this and I got back to El
[58:51] Paso the first thing I went I got my
[58:54] luggage to try and and see the men
[59:00] medicine what came to find it wasn't end
[59:05] there so I said okay I'm GNA go home and
[59:07] I'm gonna call
[59:10] someone I drove from op Paso it was
[59:13] already past
[59:17] midnight I got home my family was
[59:19] already
[59:22] sleep I started making phone calls
[59:26] and everybody that would always
[59:33] Supply they didn't answer or didn't have
[59:39] none so out of a desperate mode I got a
[59:42] Bible from the house laying there in my
[59:44] living
[59:49] room and I remember prior to this I had
[59:52] already SE help I was going through a
[59:54] counselor yo yes
[1:00:02] and I remember the counselor saying
[1:00:03] Marcos in order to leave that medication
[1:00:06] it's not recommended that you do leave
[1:00:08] it from one day to another you must do
[1:00:10] it um little by
[1:00:19] little and as I got the
[1:00:22] Bible I said it might be impossible for
[1:00:25] a doctor but I know God can cure me from
[1:00:30] this and I prayed I fell
[1:00:34] asleep the following
[1:00:37] morning I woke up and I felt
[1:00:42] great and I said man it's a miracle Am I
[1:00:44] Dreaming or is you know like I feel very
[1:00:49] good it was Sunday it was Mother's Day I
[1:00:52] remember
[1:00:56] that they went
[1:00:58] by the following morning Monday
[1:01:01] morning as I was waking
[1:01:04] up I felt that I couldn't move like if a
[1:01:07] train had gone over my
[1:01:14] body and I was laying in
[1:01:17] bed and I was crying and I started
[1:01:20] remembering every all the bad things
[1:01:21] that I have been doing
[1:01:26] I was
[1:01:28] depressed my wife was already kicking me
[1:01:30] out of the
[1:01:32] house I received the divorce
[1:01:36] decree uh I was having to close my
[1:01:42] businesses I was losing
[1:01:44] money losing
[1:01:46] hope and I said maybe if you know maybe
[1:01:49] everything will be solved if I was just
[1:01:51] what if I died like maybe everything
[1:01:53] will be solved
[1:02:00] and I receive a text from my
[1:02:03] friend from
[1:02:05] Justin love you he sent me a
[1:02:09] text inviting
[1:02:11] me to go to a c plan she wanted to talk
[1:02:14] to
[1:02:17] me and I
[1:02:19] went and our conversation led to him
[1:02:22] inviting me to church
[1:02:27] and I remember I was sitting almost
[1:02:30] where just in sitting right
[1:02:35] now and I was I was feeling
[1:02:39] hopeless I was feeling
[1:02:42] tired I was feeling
[1:02:44] depressed I was mad at
[1:02:47] myself and I thought nothing can save me
[1:02:50] at this
[1:02:53] point and then there made an alter call
[1:02:57] I came to the
[1:02:59] front Pastor Caleb was preaching that
[1:03:03] day and he asked me what do you want
[1:03:07] son and I know it wasn't Pastor
[1:03:11] Caleb and I said I want my life and my
[1:03:13] family
[1:03:16] back he said you already got them
[1:03:19] back
[1:03:24] amen and that day
[1:03:26] I was just cried and I and I was praying
[1:03:28] kept on
[1:03:31] praying the following
[1:03:35] weeks they made a call to see if you
[1:03:37] want to get baptized and give your life
[1:03:39] to the
[1:03:43] Lord I came got baptized by Brother
[1:03:48] Tommy and it's the best decision I've
[1:03:54] made and
[1:03:56] you know by then I was already leaving
[1:03:58] out of my
[1:04:00] house I continue to come and every time
[1:04:03] I came I I just learned something
[1:04:07] new and I found that hope that I needed
[1:04:10] that day to fight the battle that I was
[1:04:12] fighting that
[1:04:19] week and I I and I kept on praying say
[1:04:23] God take away the people that don't need
[1:04:25] to be in my my life and put the right
[1:04:26] people in my
[1:04:32] life and then I get a message from my
[1:04:35] cousin
[1:04:38] Bob Robert he says Marcos I'm gonna go
[1:04:41] visit you in I'm gonna be visiting in
[1:04:43] Los Cruses let's get together probably
[1:04:45] hadn't seen him in a year or
[1:04:51] so and to be honest I didn't want to see
[1:04:53] him
[1:04:56] for the reason because I didn't want to
[1:04:58] I think as a man we go through this
[1:04:59] problem I didn't want him to know that I
[1:05:01] was already living out of my
[1:05:06] house because as a man I think sometimes
[1:05:09] it's difficult to show our weakness we
[1:05:11] always try and portray a strong
[1:05:18] person and he came and I I just want to
[1:05:21] say I'm so grateful for him and his wife
[1:05:24] family
[1:05:28] because it's been the rock that I need
[1:05:29] when I most needed
[1:05:33] help those times where I felt
[1:05:37] alone he's been there to help
[1:05:40] me I love you
[1:05:42] brother and no
[1:05:51] coincidence but that's not the only
[1:05:53] angel God sent in my life
[1:05:57] couple months
[1:05:58] later I met my brother
[1:06:03] Omar and it's hard to be sad around this
[1:06:08] guy even when I'm sad or when I was
[1:06:10] depressed he would make a joke and
[1:06:12] change you know made my
[1:06:17] day and pastor Pastor thank you you
[1:06:21] you've been that angel in my life as
[1:06:23] well I remember one of the first advice
[1:06:26] that I got from
[1:06:31] Pastor you know I was fighting a lot
[1:06:33] with my wife and
[1:06:36] arguments and he gave me a
[1:06:40] tip he said Marcos maros you must learn
[1:06:44] how to act instead of
[1:06:49] reacting that simple uh uh tip right
[1:06:53] there has been a lifechanging for me
[1:06:59] because I no longer react to
[1:07:01] things I
[1:07:04] act I no longer tell uh tell my God how
[1:07:08] big are my
[1:07:11] problems I tell my problems how big is
[1:07:13] my
[1:07:17] God and you can learn from anyone in
[1:07:20] this church man I can go around I
[1:07:22] remember uh brother Abraham saying um
[1:07:25] you know doctors are for
[1:07:32] non-believers the other day I was uh we
[1:07:35] were in a fellowship we were eating with
[1:07:36] Omar and
[1:07:40] David David and David said you know you
[1:07:44] know there's there's people in life that
[1:07:47] are raised Christian
[1:07:52] uh who have a you know a good Christian
[1:07:55] Life
[1:07:58] get married follow the the
[1:08:03] God and then there's the other
[1:08:06] ones that go through all this tests all
[1:08:09] these trials all this bad right the
[1:08:15] world and sometimes God needs those
[1:08:17] people because it's those people that
[1:08:19] can go and talk to others that go
[1:08:21] through the same path
[1:08:26] and I believe I'm that
[1:08:30] person um I can share a lot of things I
[1:08:33] just have 20 minutes I don't want to go
[1:08:35] by my time the other I it's it's been a
[1:08:39] battle but the blessings that I've
[1:08:44] received have prepared me to face the
[1:08:49] enemy I'm sure this the other night it
[1:08:51] was last
[1:08:53] week the middle of the night I was going
[1:08:56] through a
[1:08:59] nightmare and I woke
[1:09:02] up and I was shaking have you ever had
[1:09:05] those nights where you're still like you
[1:09:06] even woke up and you're still shaking
[1:09:07] like you I was feeling some
[1:09:14] anger and I remember saying oh thank God
[1:09:17] that was The
[1:09:20] Nightmare I feel like I wanted to hurt
[1:09:22] someone
[1:09:26] and I tried going back to
[1:09:29] sleep and as I was going to sleep I
[1:09:32] started hearing a noise in my
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:37] window and I said maybe it's a cat or
[1:09:39] something and then it started getting uh
[1:09:45] stronger and
[1:09:47] stronger and I woke
[1:09:49] up and I said you
[1:09:53] Satan you're a liar
[1:09:56] you're the father that invented
[1:09:59] lies you can no longer do nothing to
[1:10:02] me because it's no longer I that decide
[1:10:05] I've given my life to
[1:10:09] Jesus so if you want to do something you
[1:10:11] got to deal with
[1:10:13] him and I went back to
[1:10:16] sleep and this was a tool that me and
[1:10:18] Robert were talking about a couple days
[1:10:23] before and it's been many the other day
[1:10:25] she shared with me that um brother
[1:10:27] Jimmie
[1:10:29] said Jim with
[1:10:32] God
[1:10:34] sometimes he will make you come
[1:10:38] down humble
[1:10:40] yourself so he can Elevate
[1:10:43] you amen and I want to share this photos

[1:11:19] important days in our

[1:11:37] that I would be sharing a testimony here
[1:11:39] on
[1:11:43] stage and in my vision I could see my
[1:11:46] wife and my children here with
[1:11:50] me and telling you look God God can
[1:11:54] restore
[1:11:57] and I will I was looking I was see my
[1:11:59] parents in the full aisle of my
[1:12:03] family and not all of them are here
[1:12:04] today but tonight I have my
[1:12:07] brother and my uh stepmom
[1:12:12] here and I know pretty soon my whole
[1:12:14] family is gonna be
[1:12:20] here and let me just tell you before I
[1:12:24] leave whoever is here you're watching
[1:12:29] online if you lost
[1:12:31] hope if you feel like you're losing that
[1:12:33] everything that you've built is going
[1:12:38] away that all the odds are against
[1:12:42] you you should get
[1:12:45] excited because that's an
[1:12:48] indication that God is ready to change
[1:12:50] your
[1:12:51] life you God bless you
[1:13:21] God bless you
[1:13:23] everybody was
[1:13:26] here we are
[1:13:27] again thank the
[1:13:33] Lord first of all I want to thank our
[1:13:35] pastor for another
[1:13:41] opportunity I want to thank God for uh
[1:13:43] this opportunity to show my
[1:13:48] testimony and if we could stand to our
[1:13:50] feet to read the word
[1:13:52] please r
[1:13:56] we're going to turn to Romans 8 verse
[1:14:21] 30 moreover whom he did predestinate
[1:14:24] them he also called and whom he called
[1:14:27] them he also Justified and whom he
[1:14:29] justified them he also
[1:14:35] glorified what shall we say then to
[1:14:38] these things if God be for us who can be
[1:14:41] against
[1:14:44] us and let's go to verse 35
[1:14:57] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:14:59] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[1:15:02] P persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:15:05] Peril or
[1:15:07] sword let's go to verse
[1:15:18] 38 for I am persuaded that neither death
[1:15:21] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:15:23] nor powers nor things present or nor
[1:15:27] things to
[1:15:28] come verse
[1:15:37] 39 nor height nor dep nor any other
[1:15:41] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:15:43] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:15:45] Jesus our lord
[1:15:48] amen let's it be the word of the Lord
[1:15:56] I know that what we can say here as as
[1:15:59] people brother Bram
[1:16:03] says what I say may be
[1:16:07] wrong but the word of God will never be
[1:16:10] mistaken that's the
[1:16:13] truth so I want to share a little bit of
[1:16:16] of my
[1:16:19] testimony well I'm 38 years old you may
[1:16:23] be seated
[1:16:30] I was like am I speaking too
[1:16:41] loud I Want to Break My Testimony into
[1:16:44] two
[1:16:50] stages the first stage I see it as the
[1:16:52] stage of fear and the attributes of sin
[1:17:01] we know that sin is one thing and the
[1:17:03] attributes are all the
[1:17:07] actions so I believe that I'm the one
[1:17:09] that broke the record in all
[1:17:14] s also in what is
[1:17:19] fear ever since I was a kid I was
[1:17:23] carrying my chains
[1:17:26] I felt fear
[1:17:28] insecurity fear to be
[1:17:32] abandoned always threatened all the
[1:17:38] time even though my father always
[1:17:40] provided for
[1:17:44] home as a husband he was not a good
[1:17:49] husband so I learned all the bad things
[1:17:52] from him
[1:17:55] thank God I had a very good
[1:18:00] mother and I'm blessed for the mother I
[1:18:02] have
[1:18:05] truthfully she's not here but I want to
[1:18:08] tell her that I love her with all my
[1:18:09] heart they're at the
[1:18:12] cameras I know I wouldn't be here
[1:18:15] without
[1:18:20] her and she's an important part in my
[1:18:22] life and I truly appreciate her
[1:18:29] when I was growing up I met my
[1:18:31] wife she's a great
[1:18:34] woman beautiful thank
[1:18:37] God he gave her all the attributes she
[1:18:42] needed and since the moment I got
[1:18:47] married I wouldn't be the person I'm now
[1:18:49] without her
[1:18:51] [Applause]
[1:19:03] uh
[1:19:09] truthfully that part of my life carrying
[1:19:11] all the
[1:19:13] chains it hasn't been
[1:19:17] easy but I believe I know that than
[1:19:20] thanks to
[1:19:23] God I'm sure I've been able to break
[1:19:25] with all those
[1:19:30] chains I'm still fighting with many of
[1:19:32] them those negative
[1:19:35] thoughts but thank the Lord to his
[1:19:40] grace that I'm here and he gives me
[1:19:43] another
[1:19:45] opportunity the second
[1:19:49] part that's when I moved from Mexico to
[1:19:52] the United States
[1:19:55] I got here to this beautiful church with
[1:19:57] this beautiful
[1:19:59] family and thank the
[1:20:02] Lord I was able to get
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:08] baptized and as brother Jimmy was uh
[1:20:11] talking or sharing the other
[1:20:19] day I I I pass justification
[1:20:22] sanctification and I'm receiving the
[1:20:24] baptism of the Holy
[1:20:25] Spirit I feel it with all my
[1:20:29] heart everything starts looking
[1:20:36] different I go to the stores right now
[1:20:39] where in the
[1:20:41] Halloween and I don't see it as I used
[1:20:43] to do it or see it
[1:20:51] before even the way I dress I start
[1:20:53] changing it and
[1:20:55] small details of myself I started
[1:20:56] changing
[1:21:01] them and I wouldn't have done that
[1:21:03] without God Christ in my
[1:21:13] heart last Sunday when God through our
[1:21:16] pastor was uh giving us the
[1:21:22] message that day I felt something
[1:21:24] different I I surrendered to
[1:21:30] God and I felt that the Holy Spirit was
[1:21:33] in
[1:21:40] me thanks to God thanks to that I could
[1:21:43] eliminate several negative
[1:21:51] thoughts when you come in here to become
[1:21:54] a Christian things are not easy or
[1:21:57] easier but they become harder or more
[1:22:01] complicated uh the battle in the mind
[1:22:07] starts and you have to feed your heart
[1:22:10] as they
[1:22:15] see to be able to fight that devil that
[1:22:18] mentality
[1:22:29] it is not easy but it's a it's good to
[1:22:31] feel Joy and the blessing and the love
[1:22:33] of God
[1:22:45] again I know there's a lot of things
[1:22:47] that I have to go through and I still
[1:22:49] have to learn
[1:22:56] but truthfully any person that thinks
[1:22:58] that he is in a bad situation bad
[1:23:02] position if God could do this for
[1:23:06] me I'm sure that they he can do that for
[1:23:09] them as
[1:23:11] well God is is a good
[1:23:13] god and he's a God that does not
[1:23:19] lie he has predestinated us as the word
[1:23:23] says we just have to
[1:23:26] surrender I just have to
[1:23:29] surrender and keep moving
[1:23:33] forward he's going to reveal everything
[1:23:36] he has for my
[1:23:38] life and he will fulfill his
[1:23:45] promises that's basically
[1:23:49] it I want to thank my mother my
[1:23:53] wife my pastor and all the church God
[1:23:56] bless you
[1:24:21] [Music]
