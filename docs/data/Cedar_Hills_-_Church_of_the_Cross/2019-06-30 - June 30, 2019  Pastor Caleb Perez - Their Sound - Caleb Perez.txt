was a lot of mess you're in amen as we look at all those videos my message may be just for just for a few moments now again Tommy mensaje poco we realized that that as Jesus memos cómo es qué hey Suz as he looked at the at the multitude and preaching all day long and obvious that he can do it he looked and saw that they were hungry we don't get any a number right sometimes we say well that's not the gospel it is a noisy noisy luckily muchos deal and if it's in the gospel it is the gospel he's done Delamar kill us they'll ever heal you now we understand that there are different parts of it and then them escape artists if and then there are things that as human beings we have compassion towards people EK courses work it didn't I cook tenemos come come Paseo the Bible says that Jesus looked at the crowd and saw that they are hungry they saw a multi-tool if you hear and read it and they had heard him look yeah yeah pretty how they were hungry and Jesus said I don't want to send them home hungry he hadn't but he looked at the crowd and and he had compassion on them Meola multitude to a compassion and that compassion is a company or her something that was so great before I look at that gun it produced the creative Word of God I'm gonna say it again the compassion that Jesus had on the crowd like okay - okay sue saleable tea - produced a creation brother who nacreous here and that's where he began to create the bread face and final test Bible says that he fed more than 5,000 this is a really really compare of majestic combo we look at those things and those things are needful Mira Moses of course I saw necessary yes we understand once again that that's part of the gospel it's our love for God's people that constrains us to do what we do it's el amor que tenemos a la gente que no sambuca but we also understand that that's not the main part of the gospel and Emmas que no la parte de prisa birthday we do those things I say mostly you have many churches do those things many churches and many humanitarian organizations do those things they'll go and they'll feed the people they'll help people and we feel good when we're able to do something like that for the people so we want to tell you that Satan don't care if we do that or not this morning I'm gonna say it again saying don't care if we do those things I said another import that cat I'm saying it's okay to build churches it's okay okay to to feed the poor to do all these other things yes though but that don't get same out of bed a la cama I'm gonna say it again you don't get setting out a bad Church

easy very sick is that fasting I said because all hell is not against them poor cat understand contra days all hell is against the message of the hour that we preach because it has the power to bring souls worship are afraid has the power to reach down to those that are lost power to make a person as they do nothing stop and change them from a church memory capella you membrane and it heals them

different ways different is most you got to be on the alert because that I let it down but I'm thankful to God yes there is one thing okay you're not course that God gives us knows that that'll give us the authority a lot of stories over the enemy so real enemy go in the church age book in a little revelation of Jesus Christ so nobody want to know what it is we're case one thing it gives you the authority common is that loud told you that he said it is the revelation of God is that revelation the deals that will give you the authority over the Doctore that's what El Diablo yeah yeah well I know a lot of word brother they don't give you a sharpener hello everybody well I do a lot of praying that's good mooch okay but it's the revelation of the word but a little assume that is the authority that because when all we have is a second hand revelation of the man I said that because the brother said it but if it's not a revelation to you can you have any kind of authority over the over the enemy what was that they I'm not the real enemy was impossible simple simply and you can see why you step with an adult you add or take away from the word it's cursed I need any key pennies
