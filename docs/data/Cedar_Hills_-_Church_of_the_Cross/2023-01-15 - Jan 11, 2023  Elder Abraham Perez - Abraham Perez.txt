so let us pray oremos precious and Heavenly Father Celestial this morning as we come before your divine presence I have nothing to give to your children but if I put Abraham Peters to the side and let you speak to us we can be fed by your words of your children this morning Christ Jesus name amen amen you may be seated foreign but that was a long time ago but you know what is when you were born you were born to die as soon as your mother delivers you you're on an exodus to your second home and what is your second home is you go to the Grave you go to the military cemetery in Fort bear it was a forebear a cementario de los militares and they got tombstones looks like an apartment house apartment well if you don't have a home there probably in memory lane you'll have one yeah it's used and they're so nice that they put your name there so your people know where you're living is here lies William so then you won't have to miss where he lives oh here lies Jerry I'll go visit you oh you said but you're all good you'll die first and I will um death does not respect your age he does not respect how rich or how poor you are no I respected if you go to India India they don't have places to bury them anymore they will either feed you to the crocodiles or put you in a little canoe and turn it on fire really foreign Young oh what you see here it goes ah look at brother Ibraham there goes death walking around your death is that's Martha you have never known me you said I've never known none of you you know because what we see is going to that grave is what's inside so this outside has to die so the inside can live the man inside cannot come out until you die so I have another home that's why we come to church that's why we want to get close to God In my Father's house or many palaces amen amen foreign and their soul is dead Mira Hector foreign foreign [Laughter] I have a lot more I I've got an encyclopedia full of those kids 10 John 19 28. the message is it is finished hmm after this Jesus known that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled says I serve this is Tango if the Lord would approach you this morning could you fulfill John 19 28 but it is and tell the Lord it is finished I have accomplished everything the scripture and you could say this day this scripture is do you know what your purpose here on Earth is uno now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his power was come that he to depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end of History [Music] foreign I was written in the paper the following day that some of them left slept on the sidewalk at night to be the first in the door to get um the Lord said I thirst tengo said foreign and they bring him unto a place called Golgotha which has been interpreted the place of a skull is verse 23 verse and they he gave him to drink wine mingle with Mir but he received it now you know what mirror is we'll read read the communion Church date he'll tell you it lives like that it's midnight to use to embalm the dead people so that's why they were giving Jesus on the cross they wanted to make sure that he was dead they gave him wine they had never fermented how did it happen Jesus was at the very first in Canada Jesus oh you people like to drink wine tomorrow if I wouldn't ask you the question many of you will be ashamed to raise your hand okay how many of you were rhinos oh man you go to Skid Row you don't have to go to San Pedro in Los Angeles we got himself tell me many of us when we were in the world when we didn't have money to buy liquor they wine that keep this wine you could find we would buy remodel is just to be able to drink something I think it cost about 65 cents a bottle yeah what we do when we were in that world Jesus are at the wedding Jesus and the wine gave out is what would you say if Caleb closed the church she collapsed because we ran out of wine and I'm not talking to the wine we use in communion I'm serving you wine this morning people like like Wednesday brother farmer give us good wine it's stimulates you is for you to come more and more to church to so much we're gonna find out this week if you really want to come in Holy Week we'll have church every night see how much wine you want don't get drunk with the first night tomorrow foreign [Music] thank you do you know that the state Maru zabase it means it grows it as it goes it is an expression or goal is an expression inscribed in a banner or a seal um and I'm seeing this in this congregation there is growing and growing to drink not wine of denomination or or wine of the world you're coming and drinking fermented wine Venice because when Mary cuando Maria told her son Jesus son we ran out of wine and what did Jesus say Jesus what have I to do with it Contigo because they ran out of wine so then they got six water Republic tomorrow says either 20 or 30 gallons of wine but they wanna so then Jesus only made him sicko says because he told his mother why do you bother me my hour is never fermented and for six seven ages we got bigger and stronger for you amen amen it's the stimulation of Revelations amen you need wine let your car or truck run out of fuel then you gotta walk what if not your wine from saltino we're gonna find all this week amen amen your spiritual vehicle needs wines albino years ago our Minister told the founding pastors he said brother Tommy Tomas I don't know what to preach on you understand we already preached the seals and the churches there's nothing to print and the foreign he says I don't have time to preacher I got my covers full of wine all the messages you can see the he made the wine a dead wedding at least with probably just tap water or water from uh from uh well our question which he did not make there AI he had to have water from the clouds okay he was at the cross and those religious priests and Jews where the temple is and then they went out when they did that in the Scriptures it was because they crucified the ministry this is what about your crucifixion are you ready to go to Calvary this morning have you marked the place in your life he'll point you to the cross and you gotta go there and die and then you know him if you want to know him he never pointed you to a church or anywhere else to know him but he pointed you to the cross and there is self-crucifixion yes as crucifixion to yourself that's why a man must be born again [Music] Del Vino brother random says that Israel was God's fine and he came to them he came to his own Dino a loss and it was his song that crucified the churches rejected the fruit of the vines and when Jesus Took to the Lord's supper with his disciples before his crucifixion this is the blood of the new testamento as of as you drink the Lord's death till he comes and many churches won't take regular wine Vino regular because that it was an alcoholic okay foreign and another reason is when wild ages it gets better and stronger yes in the blood of Jesus Christ gets sweeter and better as the years do you know that when you take communion it has Divine Healing Divina when the Israelites in time took the communion in March for 40 years and when they got out of the Wilderness there was nobody people or sick amongst and there were over two million of them there is power of healing in the communion Saint John 19 30. when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghosts can you truthfully say it is finished if the Lord would come this is and Jesus cried with a loud voice Jesus and when he cried it thundered so loud we're gonna hit that in a little while but remember he said it is finished Genesis 2 1. thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the hosts of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day for all his work which he had made and God bless the seventh day and Sanctified because that he need he had rested from all his work which God created and Madea is are you resting can you say what the Lord said that when he finished in six days his work he rested on the seventh president if you're born again and sealed with the Holy Spirit are you supposed to be resting and we in the seventh Church you should be resting Reposado you say no you know because you know we still gotta spread the word and our brothers go on missionary trips but look at I'm not gonna go into that you know but you know you gotta enter into the seventh Genesis and Jesus was the lord of the service is a Jesus you are not resting from doing the works of the Lord no studies you are resting because you don't do this you are not in the you live in this world but you are not of this is he Sanctified the seven days yes but his rest was interrupted by Satan you know so this cancer foreign did not land on the garden he landed then the only reason he got into the garden of it because if lowered down the bar and let him means that he got more jealous in heaven he was jealous of Michael when he came down he found out as in control there was already a God here on Earth secondary and he got more jealous until he won the victory over Adam and Eve and they lost their inheritance same does not [Music] so you see why God could not receive the offering of of Cain because he gave him enough in those days they were so far advanced in technology they could tell time by the stars [Music] but the Zodiac was the first Bible it was God above us sovereign but God seemed that man stopped looking up and then rely on God but under achievements through their science he needed another Bible so what kind of Bible did he gets okay you know when if committed what she did so then the heavens were close so if the heavens were closed because in those times they used to tell time by the Stars so if the heavens were closed how come the Wise Men followed the Stars they were the only ones that could tell time by the stars is in the heavens close to the denominations how can we hear tell time by the Stars oh listen the Prophet The Seven Stars hallelujah hallelujah it wasn't close to them John was on the Isle of Palms among the snakes and the Scorpions the Lord says I cannot talk to you down during those denominations and the heaven was open doors isn't the same thing that happened to our Prophet is here Philadelphia foreign you're gonna have to wait three and a half minutes of the rain from the clouds they made this wine that you like to come here to church you've got wine from the water from the clouds but he needed another Bible and he said Enoch Enoch come up come up here the same thing he told to John no means and the heavens opened and look he walked with God and God gave him the plans to make the second Bible you know what the Bible was called foreign [Music] amen amen but then Peron tonsils he needed another Bible where the Bible came he called bibliadino he can say They Crucified him electricity Caron and his period moved upon the waters it's respiratory he was looking for a place to rest yes to finish the seventh day para terminal to indwell God in us because in the last days the only Bible many will ever read you know what is the only Bible they will read it's you yes that's the only Bible they will read and the word says we are in the case of red of every word amen amen that's why the spirit of the Lord moved upon the world looking for a place and when Jesus cried with the loud voice it was the voice of Thunder ah does the Thunder have a voice he says the voice like a voiceover because when it thundered when he was on the cross on the list and cried with the Lord's voice he'd opened the grace but when the Grays were opened the only ones that I walked the Old Testament saying Los Santos the Antigo testamento how come the other Graves thank you because when he cried the first time on the cross in La Cruz oh he was calling for Elijah foreign is it how come you understood you gotta put the brakes I'll be pitching down there with all those things now gracias thank you good to have people they know what they're doing we don't like it look Mike good it's a good thing that I couldn't got good insurance if I go over the cliffs I God Blessed Assurance amen foreign and in Genesis is when he said let there be light on the first seal in Genesis it's separated the darkness and when you heard the seals you read the first sale and this became a new Bible it separated you from the darkness Hallelujah is separate the light from the darkness it used to be in Genesis there are missed water the ground the Mist was an Earthly cloud and the old world and it also closed with the thundermans and when the animals heard the voice of The Thundermans they had never heard of thunder so how could the animals understand and go into the yard you have never heard of Thunder the denomination that's not a thunder that's an awesome trainer this color lady is this color she told her husband how come you shout so much behind when you preach in church well he said if I don't have lightning I want to have thunder correct amen amen so then the animals heard the Thunder Los Angeles you had never heard thunder but you're here the animals animals they marched into the yard and do you know that right now it is thundering is every time you come to church it's thundering is remember the Thunder has a voice Genesis 9 13. and he says I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the Earth and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the Earth that the bow shall be seen in the clouds foreign was between god well not between God and Adam and Company the Covenant was between God and the Earth that's what it says and when I see a cloud over the Earth well we all every day we see a bunch of clouds but notice not just any clothes where was this Cloud coming from you don't have any eyes it had to be a bow on the clouds for 2 000 years there was no rain yeah I asked the question what comes first [Music] talk to me you intelligent kids welcome first meetings all your searches look at yourself parents are real smart what comes first you said the rain instead James is he correct all right well don't just say go ahead tell me the world comes first huh lightning oh you look cool you're afraid that I'm gonna ask you one of your kids I don't know what comes first huh lightning I wonder what kind of school these kids go to yes there is no clouds we're just talking about the clouds you stuck clowns well at least you come to church and you learn something um Revelation 10-1 apocalypse is yes oh no it's gonna get good here and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven closed with a club and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it was the Sun and his speed is pillars of fire is remember he was close with the clouds but the Covenant was upon his head is what causes the color of the rainbow colors is the way the Sun hits the drop of rain his commercial and that's how he throws the color this claw was a covenant is and this Angel yes because in the old testamento it was called the angel of the Covenant and he had in his hand a little book open um and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth he puts a superiority so where did he put his feet he put one foot on wrong and the other one on the United States one of the beasts came out of the sea station and brothers of Revelation did I say onset the apocalypse this is another best thing he came out of the Earth for there was no people and that's the United States and the image so the angel came down and put one foot on wrong and put the other food on the United States and he said time shall be no more I have prepared Russia to throw atomic bombs to both of you your time is over no more yeah no no we can say as we turn the corner Jesus on the cross Jesus I have been asked this question yeah ask this question to our pastor or Tommy is is the blood of Jesus cleanses how could the blood cleanse me commas because Jesus did not have more blood than any of you okay Jesus how could he clean all his things such little blood that he heard it's a human he only has so much blood so the chemistry of the blood was not sprinkle every heart because the blood was shed and Cavalry and it based the ground when the blood cell was broke great release God and so adios through the Sanctified that the blood had to come back to the believer so we could be identified with our sacrifice it was the life of the sacrifice in US foreign Jesus breathed on them and he breathed in them the Holy Ghost repeated the spirit too the question was asked did they receive the Holy Spirit right then well let me tell you if you got a naked do you have an oak tree thank you yeah so do you have an oak tree like you said potentially right potential so did they have the Holy Spirit right then and there yeah later he he almost cursed the Lord you know before the Cockroach you will deny me three times and you shall receive the promise the gift of the Holy Ghost spirit to Santo because Jesus had taken the book out of the dirty hands of Satan and get to the original owner yeah here we go akibamos so Elijah said I hear the abundance of friends he went all through the third changes my stories he's so I thought about the eyes of the hand of a man where did he see the clouds Saint Luke 12 54. son Lucas and he said also through the people when you see a cloud rise out of the West straight away you say there cometh a showering so it is so when they saw the cloud here in the wells why was there an abundance of rain Ultimo what did you say the latter the the letter rain and the Harvest rain came together it was an abundance of rain and when you see the South going blow you say there will be heat and it comes to pass you Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky and of the Earth but how is it that you do not discern this time they cannot discern the times so what does a cloud produce lightning before the Thunder [Music] or wherever the carcass is there will the Eagles gather together the carcass is here we're all legal here together and he said unto the disciples that days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it can you leave it on that verse because I didn't have that here please could you put it back go ahead okay and they shall say do you say hear or say there go not after them nor follow them where is the lightning the lightest all that one power under Heaven's shyness unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his days what proves must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation is it was in the days of Noah socially but we also in the days of the son of man is they did it they drank they married wife they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the plot came and destroyed them all is can you see as a light has traveled the lightning has traveled from the East to the West yes like in the times in this time that we live isn't there a flood of doctrines and churches and Greece and doctrines all over the difference oh the flood has seen all the churches the world no the lamb takes the book of seals and breaks them and shows the seven angels the mysteries of God which is the ministry of the seventh angels He had to reveal it to us in order to have Rapture in faith and when he cried with a loud voice seven Thunders which will be revealed in order to get the bride ready and together for rapturing faith we need the face to be changed in a moment to be taken out of the Earth this is the last scripture Revelation 14 14 foreign heaven and he said our Golden Crown and in his hand a sharp sickle images and another angel came out of the temple crying with the loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time he's come for thee to reap for the Harvest of the earth is right and he that sit on the cloud throws trust in his sickle on the Earth and the Earth was ripped is in the sickle going around right now is is n't this a harvest rain that's raining now and the closer then God gets to us should we get closer to God because the time will come when the Harvest will be over the hidden mysteries in the foundation of the world it's not being revealed in the last days to the manifested sons of God these seven Thunders never utter in heaven yes to that group that is perfected who can really take the word of God the lightning produced the Thunder when two clouds Collide when did the two clouds collided it was too omnipotents coming together and that happened yesterday when brother Brennan was lifted to the king's chamber because okay enlightening he was the leader's throat in Republic lose and the lightning Strokes look for power lines yes he was the Overcomer in Era Alexander that was when he in February 28 of 1963. and that's when the Seven Seals were open he was the overcomer and that was the only one that could go into the king's exchange and the spirit of God moved upon the waters searching for a place to rest he came searching for a preferred ground he was searching for an overcomer he was searching for a power line and in 1963 after opening the seals yes it was opened in the east oriente the lightning came West yeah I asked the question the lightning came from the East to the West at Occidental but the cloud was in the west and after the sales were broken during in the east the leader stroke was looking so he was looking for a place to rest concert when the seals were opened the only place he could go was to New Mexico [Music] he came to New Mexico he was looking for a power line who was the power line Prophet was a little strong and Professor but it doesn't come from heaven from it comes from the earth and the little strong main connection with a mainstream yeah with a lot of energy it was not air Arizona California or any other state they had to come to New Mexico New Mexico a lot of energy it opened the atomic age he came to New Mexico and he went to Hanover Hanover but you [Music] how many in here were born before 1945 raise your hands we got one oh no two those three dress four they were born because the atomic bomb was in July the 16th 1945. and I said it before when their atomic bomb hit in New Mexico they knocked me off as a couch where I was sleeping I didn't know what it was I only know that I bounce to the floor so then the prophet said Prophet The Leader stroke this is the founding person you're full of power you are the main stroke here you said is who gave the confirmation of that so the sun is he said I have never seen a Ministry like this since my father-in-law was alive who can argue about the ministry of our funding persons there was a power line and the prophets told him foreign to help me help me to gather all the Loose Ends we were losing we were all in the world we were in denominations I need you to help me to get these loose ends and then because we were born in the atomic age we've got atomic energy and to finish to say this is your father has a name of atomic a Imam atom God bless you [Applause] well brother Justin and sister [Music] really will come to the front because the ministers please come and Ministries this baby I think he died and they brought it back but they're hearing problems with
