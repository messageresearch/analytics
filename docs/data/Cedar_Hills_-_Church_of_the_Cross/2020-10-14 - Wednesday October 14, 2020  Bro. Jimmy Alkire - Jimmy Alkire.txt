[Music] sweetest [Music] [Music] he speaks the [Music] oh [Music] [Music] amen [Music] jesus [Music] oh how many believe the great physician now is near my mind sympathizing jesus oh it's so wonderful to be in his presence such a privilege that the lord through our pastor would give me the privilege to bring part three on the inoculation of god with a subtitle beyond immunity [Music] it's not funny it's kind of strange since the the last time i ministered everything that's gone on in the political world and our our president god bless his soul i pray that god will save his soul i have nothing against him and how he was he got the virus and then now he says he's immune but is he is he truly immune well he might be immune against brother milo corona virus but where but he might get sick of another virus so is that the kind of immunity that god just gives a personal immunity but really in order to get true immunity it has to go beyond what immunity is of this body and tonight we're going to see why the jesus really could not produce the inoculation how many remember what the inoculation is against this virus and helps your body produce antibodies to fight the virus that's what it is it's lucas but immunity is the state or quality of not being susceptible to any virus am i reading that right is that thing off it looks like it stopped to me it's 7 26 i've already been up here three or four minutes so i just want to make sure that i do not go over my time you're so kind to open your bibles the 12th chapter of saint john the juan capitulo amen how many brought your bibles tonight yes yeah let me see if the guys got that scripture here for me if not i'll get it real quick john 12 28. people even though it doesn't look too hot up here but that's okay i'll just read it off my phone maybe it's my glasses john 12 8 father glorify thy name father glorification then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again now let's go to chapter 17 amen here we go verse 5 versus cinco and now oh father glorified out me with thine own self how is jesus going to be glorified arapus father glorifica allah to you how is he going to be glorified he's saying glorify me with thine own self he's speaking to the father and he's saying the only way i'm going to be glorified if this will only come unless they're glorious with you yourself that's glorified mismo my glorification all right that's good stuff amen amen but i know himself with the glory which i had with thee before the world was glorious lord jesus we just thank you good night lord for your mercy and for your goodness and they're privileged to speak to your children now anoint the word to each heart lord that it will take us beyond the immunity that this body can produce will supply a divine protection lawyer we ask all this in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ did you all play that first clip for me i have up there brother tommy in the message hinder me not as i look up this quote go ahead and what's going is no on that god will glorify one human being by himself i want you to hear me i'm going on a limb right now god will not glorify one human being by himself that's why when he asked the question and he says father glorify me with the glory that i had before with you before the foundation of the world he says i have glorified thy name i have both glorified it once in jesus name and i will glorify again that in his bride but his bride has to be together as a unit to receive the glorification or the entering in of the spirit into the theophany completely so that there can be a resurrection of human flesh glorified how many can say amen you know really i i wouldn't have to say anything else is closing god bless you no my god is so good we just love the lord jesus you know yeah it's been such a tremendous thing i remember as i finished part two on the inoculation we left the message where we would see how the resurrection would produce that inoculation but before i do i was thinking of when i would be able to bring this third part this place and when our pastor preached part 21 of the parallel changing from one form to another uniform at the end of this his message he read this quote do you have that first one brothers the word became flesh paragraphs 183 and 184 amen amen and they that are sons of god are led by the spirit of god then when the human and the spirit of god fills that vacancy where you empty yourself amen then will be when the church is let me let it go up a little bit we'll walk in his steps but coming out in two spots and his power in support and his thoughts and his being in his movies will become material let this go up because it's going up very slow the church will be so wrapped in christ amen did you notice that so rapt and cry and here he comes back again amen it went off and it came back on again so praise praise the lord so wrapped in christ the holy spirit mankind so away from themselves that they don't see themselves so far away from ourselves that we don't see ourselves it doesn't mean we don't look at ourselves in the mirror sometimes but we don't see when we look in the mirror we don't see but watch this they don't see themselves they don't have no but to serve god and their thoughts move on they refuse the things the holy spirit spoke to me in my heart hablo le spirito santo mi corazon i believe it's the holy spirit did you believe it the holy spirit yes not that i need your approval no necessity but the holy spirit speaks through you i believe he spoke to me he said now you can bring the third part of this message amen amen the spirit said now you can bring this third part when you are wrapped in christ what it says it takes you beyond yourself beyond the immunity that you could attain in this body to the complete expression of the inoculation that's on the inside of your soul a complete expression when you're wrapped in christ it reminds me of this song it says jesus on the end working on the outside amen amen it's the holy spirit wrapping you completely on the outside also takes you behind this immunity and it takes you into a realm where the supernatural god you say you're really going slow tonight well yeah so i guess the older i get the slower i go they say what is it's got to begin to influence your decisions influence the system when you get to that point will there be anything that can touch you we'll attain that how many believe we will attain them we are in the process of attaining it right now i love this so much jesus on the inside is jesus now could you all put that definition up there of the word heard immunity it's another thing you know we didn't even hear these words before that i've heard the president different ones and different people i do watch a little news probably about an hour a day i like seeing the scriptures being fulfilled a reduction of the risk of infection when a significant proportion of the population has become the risk of infection immunity or god will not glorify one of us praise the lord jesus christ now i would like to go to hebrews chapter 4. verse 15. verso quincy well we have not and high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as i am does it say that i am well yeah i am but no it says we are amen as we are did jesus look like he had no sin when he went into the temple and overturned the tables and the money exchangers and got a whip and beat the you know what out of them and got them out of the temple jesus the kind of priest probably said oh what a horrible amen so we have not a high priest that can't can he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity feeling he can go every through everything that you and i have gone through but yet without this believing one word describe what word could he have disbelieved brother henry it wasn't what the word said about somebody else it was what the word said that he was that he could doubt what the word said and how many of you know that he was not even in the office of the high priest once a year he would go into the holy of holies he had to go in with the blood a little basin in the blood and he had to be sprinkling that blood seven times upon the mercy seats he had to be dressed right then pomegranate bells around his skirt is the granada and he had to walk in such a way that those bells were making noise and he had a rope tied around his leg and if he did something wrong and would die there in the presence of that shekinah glory gloria they would pull him out of there they wouldn't be able anybody could go in there is a high priest that can be touched why can he be touched i want to give the definition of that word touch there as we turn in our bibles to john chapter 20. amen amen what a tremendous thing glory to god that will bring divine immunity it's not just that he was touched like that something was attached to him and what a jesus said unto her woman why we pissed out she's opposing him to be the gardener say it unto him sir if thou would have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away i don't want to comment too much because i want to get to certain things here and jesus said unto her mary home maria she turned herself and said unto him amen next verse all right back to verse 17 please and jesus said unto her touch me not jesus for i have not yet ascended to my father but go tell cedar hills church of the cross iglesias amen go tell my brethren are you his brethren is he our older brother i have not yet ascended to the father but go to my brethren and say unto them you did this i ascend unto my father if he was already in the office of and my god and your god can you play that second clip same message hinder me not this woman says show me where you laid him and she she calls him raboni master and he answers her and says don't touch me don't hinder me i am not yet ascended to my father in other words he resurrects and he's and in his resurrection he is still a man of a mother and a father and a genealogy but he don't want to be hindered until he's glorified him god amen so he says i must ascend to my father don't hinder me by calling me master amen now we begin to understand the two scriptures that we read last time if you want to mark them down because i don't want to take a lot of there's so much i just it's good for you to study at home anyways acts 2 verses 30 through 33 but i actually do want to read the 33rd verse can you get acts 233 for me gentlemen i want you to begin to notice the sequence of these things jesus had already talked to his disciples and preached to them and john jesus how he had to go away or the comforter would not come and he gave them the promise of everything that this holy ghost would do when it would come to something and when he did that in chapters 14 to 17. he was prophesying of what would [Applause] therefore being by the right hand of god exalted go ahead brother henry exalted notice here then now he's ascending to the father and now he becomes exalted there and what happens watch the scripture therefore being by the right hand of god exalted comma having received of the father the promise the promise [Music] and receive the promise not of the sun now the promise of the father the promise of the holy ghost the promise let's go back to luke 24. i want to give you the scriptures for these things because everybody thinks jesus died he rose he went to heaven and and the holy ghost came to christ amen amen he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you exactly what we just mentioned look at this tom i've already told you about all these things well i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which are written in the pro law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me remember we just heard where the father answered jesus in john chapter 12 and he said i have both glorified glorification and will glorify you and here we see it being glorified but now in order for it to be glorified again there has to be a resurrection that's the only now i want you all to get this not just understand the scriptures and in general everything else what was he concerned about the scriptures that he had to fulfill and he wants us to be concerned about the scriptures that we must fulfill amen amen and he said unto them is it written and thus it behooved christ to suffer necessarily christopher rise from the dead next verse and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations i can see myself walking in the streets of africa again africa maybe not literally but spiritually maybe my theophany will take a trip over there and ye are witnesses of these things watch what he could do after he'd suffered of my father upon you that my who was going to send the promise upon them jesus jesus but not as a son but as a high priest wherever you are that pertains to the bride brothers can you give me that quote i'm gonna jump some things because i'm not gonna be able to get to all the material that i have here and i would like to go to that quote in the resurrection of jesus amen here it is now watch this video aren't you glad that god's in our prophet content i can't drink at all but if i could okay oh now this is working better good thank you brothers appreciate it it's a hard job how many given applause now in saint luke the 24th chapter 31 verses 23 i wish to read a little text you see our lesson tonight and their eyes were opened and they knew him by jesus had already been glorified in a while we'll get into john 20 and because luke and john lucas speak very similar very similar of the same events even though john gives the most detail praise the lord from god in the beginning he was the word of you in a principle he was the angel of god it was with the children the smallest man in the city had to climb up in the trees and i think of him that when he had risen from the dead i want you to get this part here this is where it's going to start opening up the office of a high priest was he let's go back he had risen from the dead that morning that he was then had his own blood as a but when jesus took his blood can you imagine such a thing that jesus when he rose he could see the high priest sprinkling the blood on the mercy seat to enter it was no longer he saw everything exactly the way i was in heaven and when he made the tabernacle he did everything exactly and now jesus was going to be the high priest sprinkled i'm not finished yet i've got work to do i've got to make the way okay there was and i know as humans this guy man gets all jittery and i've hurt my brother some of my brothers or sisters and i'm not throwing at them maybe that's and i don't want to go into things that sound hard you know i'll leave that to the past and i say could you wait a minute please put this better moment of our seat or power well maybe you just haven't been able to discern the difference between one and the other the protons and then i make a real tape and it makes people might think that i think i'm somebody sickness because and his own blood was fresh upon the earth i did not have fear for this virus one second don't hit me no not because i'm a goody goody because he put his hiss of the serpent on [Music] praise god he broke through every bill there was and unveiled god to man went way above the heavens of heaven next paragraph please if we don't get past this all above and there he opened up a channel that god used to come down to the corridors of heaven he talked to man in the garden of eden and satan by sin had blocked them blessed be the name of the lord it's still in that message but he says this he says why when jesus rose from the dead he didn't just sit on the tomb he knew that his work was not i'm not doing too bad i'm trying to well you all pray for me amen for me let's go to this other message the great and mighty conquer earth is this it brothers it looks like it yes watch this video it was still on the high priest and then he came he came down because he was in the beginning up on that glorious day in in pascua he became not only the word but he became the high priest i'm getting too drunk here you know maybe i better sit down and let somebody else preach you know he's scary basically i'll tell you i'm just it's getting awful white in here right now you'll pray for me i need it so badly i'm not so bad so good amen he became not only the world but what a glorious thing brother now okay he's not only the word he is the high priest of making foreign we can intercede foreign by the holy spirit that's in us to the word that he has made us i know it's a lot of reading but i'm having a lot of fun there's never been one like it nobody knows what a weapon there's never been one like it he's gonna be the worst and when he comes he was born to i'm ready for next time already again whatever that is by the by the grace of god didn't he say that time would come that the love [Music] well they completely located behold i send the promise of my father i ask you a question tonight is it so much that divine love would come down [Music] not just where love

your children tonight [Music] they're not when we [Music] that's the day when he will fear us we have nothing to be afraid of you have given us the spirit of a sound mind [Music] lord i just pray lord that you would just touch oros after you came back from ascending to the father and you had been glorified yes yo glorificato there was no longer any possibility of any cell in your body you were now the glorified son of god glorification you wanted to show your disciples i paved the way i am the high priest as we heard our pastor say flesh glorifies glorification he wanted his disciples to see before pentecost and after he was glorified desperate glorification he breathed upon them [Music] 1 where it said we have handled we have handled the word of life they saw the complete [Music] [Music] that sometimes i see it begin to open lord and then the room begins to vibrate quite quite white light floor it begins to vibrate and it begins to open but then all of a sudden it closes but it's
