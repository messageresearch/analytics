seminary anyways if you don't stand this is the point point of the PA what we have today is not going to be real deep ok tenemos lo noise algo muy profundo we don't want to keep you very long either look at the most and that was mucho but it's something that that's very important result Oh muy importante and we we hope that you that we can that we can do it justice this morning is but almost sir who Stowe's esta mañana if we turn our Bibles to the book of John she was a la vela liberal isn't one chapter 17 verse 15 capitalist yet they were still King say this is Jesus party is his sous of London he's talking to the Father Orlando Leal partly and it's one of the most tremendous passages that you'll ever read yes uno los mensajes master Mendoza Cousteau puede layer when he's praying and the prayer is Lord made it let them be one as you and I are one cuando Laura Casey or que hace una como como tu y yo somos uno but this is a a piece of context here is the zoom context or in his prayer he says yes what assume I pray not that thou should has take them out of the world noruego kilo skeeters del mundo but that thou should has keep them from evil sino que los Cuates del man what a what a thing kegger and course he didn't ask to take us from this world no PD O'Keefe was a mosquito but he asked in this prayer to keep us from evil but also what uh knows that man me the Lord had the blessings to the reading of his word and he may be seated Vennela and this you know little clues to pull out of points in time so today we can just relax a little bit support a lahar some poco but not too much no mucho we have kind of two two little sermonettes that were that are related then the most common it is chrysalis you probably saw kind of a strange title up there proto-tool algo extraño G it's called the entangled depression but the precision in Ranade might seem kind of strange but I shall go extraño but this is what the Lord is put on my heart is because you know push Tameka so so but it's it's kind of too too little sermonettes I just want you two to know that so when we get ready to switch gears you you'll understand where we're at those sermons is going to come be a Muslim so he had on the stomach so it to get going we also want to read a quote from our prophet but initially the most lunacy today Nostra Profeta it's in the message the ever-present water from the rock ah hey el agua que estas en preposition present de la Roca we know that Israel has always been a historical example of the church survey most kids my LCM proceeded o una historia y Glacia because Israel was the people of God because rather than where were the Jews until they came out of Egypt hasta que salió de he and then they were the Church of God we're not like Lissa that he goes because they were separated from the rest of the world the photo supposed el resto del mundo and when we are separated from the rest of the world on the samosa puzzle then we become the church in Tosa jugamos a satellite listen but as long as we are not as long as we are entangled with the rest of the world being closest that wasn't a that I still didn't do then we are not in the church and so there's no estamos in like you know this is the sentence that that cut me too my heart is still a la francaise keep in corto el corazon this isn't just some little concept that brother branham just spattered out no so long concept okay since Moreno simplemente puso but he says now I trust that this goes real deep is outer confuse a story entry movie you know we want to know about a lot of deep things ok it was our de las casas Pro food we want to know about the thunders and the seals and they lost Reynosa lo se use the tent and all these deep things like are quite low low pro fundo but our prophet says now I trust that this goes real deep well you oughta comfy okay so interim we protein and catches its place it kept the su lugar see we are not the church then no so Muslim until we are separated from the world hasta que estamos esperados that means separate ourselves if except hermanos economies must come out from among the peoples unclean solid that like moon Decius de la gente del pueblo deal not with them no trata con EU and be not partakers of their sin they participated suspec ADO's yoke not up with the unbelievers you know a guy you talkin incredulous but separate yourself from the things of the world will see Paris in the Las Casas del mundo now this quote struck me very deep esta esta see Tamara yo funda got its place in my heart cup - su lugar de carrasco and I had to stop and ask myself through capillary preguntar of me am i a part of the people of God so yo parte del Puerto de Dios or am i a part of the Church of God what party they like lecea deduce you ask yourself that question I go into some onion are you a part of the people of God it's just a part of the Pueblo de Dios are you a part of the Church of was that puddle Iglesias am i entangled with the world stoyan radical mundo and chains of worldly bondage in kalina's they serve in umbria moon donna or are my bound like we heard on Wednesday was Tata Docomo which almost a miracle by God's chains of love por las cadenas they are mortal and I am a prisoner of Christ to call so a questionnaire or the Callisto we have to ask ourselves this question is whose casinos las preguntas and we have to be honest with ourselves their own estos gordos otras christmas you know my father-in-law used to say you can fool most of the people most of the time mr. point gonadal ahmadiyya gente lamahieu dia del Kim but you can't fool all the people all the time pero esto no puede todo el mundo and you certainly can't fool yourself yes the good I'm interested look up wink on yours or maybe you scan the pool maybe you can deploy yourself whether but you can't fool God pero no puedo gallos we have to be honest with ourselves Callisto's we want you to ask yourself that question yeah Casa la pregunta are we part of the church so you're part le Glacia are we part of the people o parte del pueblo we have to ask ourselves that the most Capri Montano says every day guardian when we leave our homes under the house mr. Scolari's which we pray and we'll we hope you're Ramos esperamos there are homes or places where everyone believes in the Lord Jesus Christ Auto garrison lugar is on the toes criminals Norwich Cristo but we have to leave our homes there are much less discusses and we have to spend most go go out easily moose and we have to spend most of our time pasamos mr. tiempo la mayoría amongst people that

akitaka ago today Vida you stay without mercy see me city Cordia but I'm so glad and happy for a god that is rich in mercy today liquid Waseda Cordia I know that many of you feel that way you said que muchos you said she's just still tired cancer overwhelmed so many girls I know we all feel that way you know céntimos hace couple of months ago as soon as mrs. I was thinking about this stop in San Luis - its struggle that I find myself in love Italian like giving Quinn true and the word came to me la palabra vino means single word and we're gonna shift gears now just so you know you almost come here spartacus they say pass the word that came to me was depression la palabra cave you know me with the presume that's a that's a hard word to talk about it's not palau de dooda parabola it's a word or condition as una palabra de una conditions hard to talk about the deficit of large very complicated as muy complicado because when you're tangled it's complicated putting on assistant ray always is difficile complete sometimes maybe it's a little shameful the proto is algo work on social shameful the talk about the shameful to say that i'm overwhelmed the circus toys that would all shameful the say maybe I've had a little bit of depression but so as you get to worry I'll go to the person my understanding is a 15 million Americans suffer from depression Tania's cake in seven days americano souffle deposition that sounds like a lot but I see como mucho but what I find interesting you look in Quinto in tourism is that they say 80% que o Jinta por ciento are not treated no son trehalose so if 15 million suffer seeking Simeon is superin eighty percent aren't treated or cinta por ciento estan Lester how did they come up with 15 million to begin with como and sausage egg on alumina like in semi honest para pasar I believe that depression touches us off locate the person knows took a todos believe it's something that we all have to deal with is alcohol of this animal Scalia I also believe this I'm being crystal I also believe that depression our lives okay love the person has with us it serves a purpose serum for positing our founding pastor preached years ago I saw Sonya spree con esto pasó timorous evil is meant by God for good killed per mole ratio por Dios I believe that all of us could okay Toto so the whole from the older this little my or to the young people I still mean or we all suffer from some form so free module one people now I do know that clinical depression it's an affliction you say kala the presumed clinic is when affliction but some depression in our life serves a purpose pero algunos a present mr. v - um procedure I'm gonna share a little something with you that help me to understand this your particular States algo que me ayuda and there is maybe it maybe this sounds a little bit strange the proof does when a algo extraño maybe you say brother that doesn't apply to stop liquor but for those of you that can come along with me for just a minute what's come up well the producer here to put a solo me know if this helped me to understand estimated ami aunt and then how many know that our water comes from the ground what does I mean que nuestra agua preceded de la tierra we live in the desert right you be most analysts here a lot of lakes and stunning it has Lagos it goes as a see our water that we drink comes from the network fmos viene de la tierra do you know that it takes a well to bring that water up you said a kid in an audio on postal para sacar el agua it's a it's a well you have to put it from a it's a Carlile okay you know and I and I heard this I was talking to a man at work that knows about water knows about Wells yeah I know but it's Rocky case especially that and he used the term and it caught my attention equals o L terminal Tommy attencion so the water that we take comes from the ground okay I work at tomamos bien le Lafayette takes a well to bring the water up you start a kid on an audio para sacar so realistically we have to defy the laws of gravity today most Kevin Stadler ladies they grab it out you to get the water from the ground but a sacar el agua there's the Lowepro fundo into into our glass but up and mr. oh and mr. Bassel a lot of gravity likely to be defiant they get over that in a cave instead of six you have to pull it up okay I kiss a Carla so it seems that were defined a law of gravity yet those puristic vincent was la ley they grab that they would be permanent I know this might be seeming like how its made or the Discovery Channel or somebody's you come over a canal the discovery while gopalam one thing has a bear with me for just up just a few couple minutes O'Laughlin minutos so we have a well the name wasn't puzzle we on the top of the ground in superficiality I want a glass of water that's the water is way down there about 500 feet away I work in like what's tucking into Spears De Profundis lay down there so we get it up though this but a Swede Allah well in order to get it up but a sweet Allah the man has to turn the pump on el hombre tiene que vienen de una una pumpin a boom body agua it begins to suck the water from the bottom EMP SS which United like well hello perfume enough the water comes you a queue you know and we say well that's all it takes this is possessed o lo que cela que is the pump is la pompe how many but I've ever drink a milkshake before what do you say tomorrow Munna Munna multi-artist now how many of you sucked on the straw you stayed get it but if you think about it Capote and it's too thick yes Tom agresa para para tsuki and pretty soon there's no there's nothing there no more heater too young right now mother what the glass is still full better advise that you know but somehow you're doing all the drawing that you can to the straw yeah gonna matter stick it is sucks you're not poor el Capote unfortunately you can move the straw around in the cup important homage to step over low a stuck in winter algo you can make it work until the things out a little bit that's the case every tampoco but a well doesn't have that luxury but on audio no tiene is they logo if the well does that cuando se la ciudad y know there's not gonna be no more water no nobody mi Sagwa so so what what happens lo que pasa is if you you if you drink a milkshake she said call the Domino Montana and if you haven't ever noticed this go to wendy's and get a frosty or something serious you know how explaining weather storm I don't want is you compressing for us give it a try you'll see what I'm talking even meet a local history shake your straw in there and it started brother Robert knows what I'm talking about hunger super tasters I look at least Orlando not about Wendy's but another Wendy's water I know that what so he put your strainer and you be NT gone it used to be Saturday there's a car the milkshakes not too thick si si la montagne Rustam agresa right around the straw al rather the proposed you'll see a little indentation start to form of a case a visa for Morocco como que c'est un poco try it well that little indention is up it's a pequeña though this is in cleanup oh cool in a well in a non posso that is known as a Kenosha has the cone of depression welco know that they presume that is necessary it's necessary that little dip that forms around the straw case ending soon because they form a little bit you could have one of the best pump in the world step with an air pump but if there was no cone of depression there but as you know you know that if you would not get water for very long so no a sacar algo por mucho tiempo so that cone of depression is necessary as it could another person is necessary what it does su casa is it begins to push down on the water is complicit who have silvery locks and as the water is pushed down yet does impossi along the straw it forces the way down to where the bottom of the well is force us our home this teleporter AHA xylophone and that's just it's it's a phenomenon it was a phenomenal but if that doesn't happen oh she has to knock on you won't get water out of your wealth little place I can agua so I use that example we should say him to tell you this but other secret
