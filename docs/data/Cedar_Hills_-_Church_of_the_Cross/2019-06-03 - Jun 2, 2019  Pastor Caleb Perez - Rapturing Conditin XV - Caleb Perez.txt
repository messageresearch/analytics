speaking lies within your own spirit the desire of season 11 did because you were born this season you didn't have a cheap but down inside of you some lady come there was something in there don't begin to draw if you notice but something told you there was a god somewhere and you're ready for that you took the church you took to the ideas where he was told better then use I want to use the thinking man's builder but when you use God's filter which is the thinking man's door because all other builders will pass away but mine shall not and let you take God's filter and draw your life your desires if you draw your desire suit god filter a thinking man filler there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost now if you all the evidence the Holy Ghost that is that's soldier of the line but the Word of God and every respect sure you drawed your life through the thinking man's building God he'll notice is that God's children he said we was washed by the water of the word and when God gave Adam and Eve a filter in the Garden of Eden it so don't you drone on this Israel but Satan punched a hole and say oh it's a little bit will hurt just one cop - it's all intercept dance into the universe that's all it takes this one taste of nicotine then they're gone there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost and then that shows that is you was that predestinated seed down in you that makes you hunger for God all the father has given he has given these tyrannies they die but Nick tower they raised to see in the world direction all that he has given these will come to me they'll replace the body work for our mouth whatever it is they'll be placed in there and they will come to me in their season oh there is that real filtration of the world the world is dead and the soul is going only one thing there

draws do that there's nothing can't get to it but the Holy Ghost what is it it's the germ seed word from the beginning that you were then thought at the beginning studier drawing the seed line let's see you think your heart before ordination is already in their father foreknowledge of God predestination and when it's Rob dictates all through nothing else but the word - the taste of escaping hang the righteous man the holiness who sees the Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday River what jumps into this place down there that words it's in the heart of what is it what is going through the word there's only one thing of pass through the word that's the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that can pass - the word is the Holy Ghost I'm thinking man gives a holy man a taste [Music] man now that's the way that's the only way to get the mind of Christ Cecil nikamoda lamented you've got to put it through the filter the filtration system set up wooden sistema de filter oh when we look at that it says God's provided way it's a model priesthood and I think brother Mike Mike Bettes jr. for sharing this quote in astronomic inner company is that there's only two ways of anything they say I thought mosaic well KITT that's the right way and the wrong way camino correct oh yeah Lincoln and that is your ways and God's ways Sun Tzu's Caminos y el camino de san you can't be in your and
