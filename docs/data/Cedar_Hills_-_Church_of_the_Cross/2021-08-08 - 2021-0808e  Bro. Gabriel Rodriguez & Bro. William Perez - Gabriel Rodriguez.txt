[Music] mr rebecca if she would come and recite a testimony by her sister hannah then immediate follow immediately following brother julian if he would come and recite a testimony from my brother judah god bless this my first time attending a youth past and aside from desiring fellowship i was looking forward to strengthening growing my relationship with god i enjoyed listening to brother evans share his testimonies about his supernatural experiences and to hear how god is so real i also enjoyed to hear our pastor teach us how to defeat the demons that attack us and we're so moved to hear the thunder vindicating the word of god after he spoke it was just so powerful thanks to the lord jesus and this beautiful camp i can say that through god that through god's merits my life is being made worthy of the gospel [Music] [Music] the youth leaders [Music] [Applause] to fellowship and enjoy everyone's company [Music] especially after the services and wonderful fellowship we had late june especially that i thought would drag me forever i felt but i felt the burden lifted off and now i praise god for restoring and healing me this camp was truly a blessing and gave me inspiration and renewed my strength i am so grateful to my pastors brother caleb and tommy and the congregation for being so gracious to us allah [Applause] amen god bless the testimonies and at this time we come to the most important part of the service and that's to hear from the throne of god amen how many are excited and ready amen we're gonna sing that song one of them and it is a privilege and an honor to introduce first our brother gabriel rodriguez and immediately following her brother william bettis let's all stand how many are one of them oh hold on hold on how many are one of them yes amen oh there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all of them [Music] oh i'm so glad that i can say [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Applause] i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of [Music] them [Music] they have already [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] they were baptized [Music] i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them [Music] [Music] so how's the youth doing we had a great camp this past weekend you guys still fired [Music] i'm just here tonight to share a little bit of a testimony testimony just take a little bit of your time but so you know i was actually talking with uh brother moses when he was like [Music] and he said he was like because tommy jr told him that he's giving a testimony next [Music] and i don't know about you guys but i'm in the same situation you guys can be seated i think i did that at the children's church like eight years ago too and but uh you know oftentimes i was thinking i was like like what's my testimony if i haven't gone out and god hasn't brought me out of all these things but i think it's better to look at it as how much greater is it that god kept us from all those things and even though i didn't go through all these things i still have a lot of things that god has done for me in my life i wanna just possibly say to you and so uh first i'd like to start with something that happened about it was january of last year we're there working at the hospital and we're getting close to our inspection [Music] and uh so there were these uh switch gears they were about 480 volts and as part of the inspection we had to go and uh cover up these pipes that had the wire coming in from outside and when this first happened i kind of just like brushed it off because i didn't think anything of it but i think i gotta give god glory for everything that he has done and so uh they asked me they were like hey we need you to go cover these pipes up in this gear and so in the switch gear you have the pipes on the floor [Music] and the gear goes on top of the pipes and it has all these metals [Music] and so the wires come and they'll get terminated [Music] so we go and we tested it made sure it was off we and i was like all right i'm good to go i could i could stick my arms in there i'll be fine so then i was there working and your arm's literally right there by the metal that's got 277 and 408 volts and uh so they're working for a couple minutes then my superintendent he's a older white man he walks in [Music] and he talks like sam elliott he was like what are you doing and so i was on i was working on the ground so i kind of sit up and i was like [Music] what do you mean i'm working like what do you want me to throw 100 and then as soon as i sat up and got away he went and he pushed me onto the floor out of the way and he was like this is hot and me i was being ignorant i was like no it's not we tested it and then he grabs a meter and he goes to test it [Music] and from bus to bus he had about 480 volts and they say 120 stings you enter 277 [Music] and then 480 i mean that's something someone will lose their life over i wasn't afraid i didn't even know but god was still taking care of me [Applause] [Music] okay all right so i look at it this time [Music] and so i decided to go up to idaho idaho and uh when i told brother caleb he was kind of like what okay but i already had it made up so i went but you're like i guess he also if we i [Music] and i freaked out i mean it was just like brother diego said that most of it wasn't even cove it was just my fear there i was couldn't it happened because i couldn't smell or taste some food that my mom was made then through all that i mean it's like quarantining it seems like it just makes you sick just having to be there stuck in your house but and then so even through all of that even though i probably overstepped my boundaries it was only me and my brother sam that i got copied and in our whole house he still kept the rest of my family safe and even in that sickness nothing serious happened to me or my brother [Music] and then after all that uh i went to our my brother caleb's house our past and i went to wash his cars and he was just asking me how i was doing [Music] it put like a doubt in my mind as to who i was as a son of god then even now thinking about me even thinking that it's [Music] ridiculous and he was able to pull that seed out because that's not a seed of the son of god and i just thank god for my pastor he's there that in those times that i needed him he was able to put me back into shape then fast forward to about four months ago i decided to make another smart decision [Music] it's electrical work i'll get a job anywhere [Music] but in that time i actually got to do a lot of things i wouldn't have been able to do with the job and it's crazy because five months without a job and maybe i didn't have everything i wanted and uh so i want to give a big thanks to my parents first off for the roof over my head um and there were a lot of brothers here that gave me work yeah brother juliana that was another thing when i was working for my pastor [Applause] the best job [Music] i had everything i needed and i still didn't have an actual job then after that work with brother caleb kind of finished up i got back and i talked to him and i told him that i needed to get a different job and he told me he was like no just be patient he told me that wasn't the right reason then that same week i actually got a call for an interview at the job that i'm currently uh my main thing i told them was i need to be in church and so uh just for you used this one it's like it's easy to get in a rush and think you need to be at a certain point in your life and being patient doesn't mean to take forever to do something [Music] [Music] and that's my testimony for y'all and i just pray that it blessed you amen god bless brother gabe this is this evening amen i had a little little thought this this evening for this evening and i pray that the lord or helps me out and uh too so i can pray that i can express it the way that he gave it to me amen amen let's uh turn into our scriptures we're going to turn into the book of first peter and we're going to start with the chapter 2. when you have it say amen i think the lord and our pastor for the wonderful wonderful service we had this morning you know you can see our pastor just giving everything that he had and all you say is wow thank you lord it's implemented thank you for giving us a shepherd that'll give everything that he has to us amen amen and it reads like this wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that she may grow thereby spiritual if so being ye have tasted that the lord is gracious amen let us pray our gracious and heavenly father lord we thank you father lord this is just a little bit of what heaven is going to look like a time where there'll be no more struggles there'll be no sickness that you just be with us if there is someone here lord that needs that needs you all necesita if there is someone online that needs you as well lord i pray that they will be blessed and lord i pray with that whatever they ask that it may be given to them lord we love you yeah thank you once again for jesus christ in the number of yours amen you may be seated i was uh i was thinking the other day is [Music] and maybe there are thoughts that i haven't thought about in such a long time and they're they're about things that uh that i that i went through as a young person and the other day he brought to my attention and i think i was in in eighth grade or so and i thought you know i'm i'm pretty good at basketball yep [Music] you know i played in the burrito man invitational yeah you know and we did we did really well i thought it was pretty good so i had this uh this desire the net then yesterday the sale to try out for the basketball team you know i had a good i had a decent shot you know i i could run with a correct you know like these young guys now you know i was i was the young guy and i see all the other guys that were that are that were about my age as i am now uh in my dad and i always thought to myself man i'm i'm up i'm going to be fit for the rest of my life you've been saying you're always done i'm going to be you know so a couple weeks ago i found out that i am 40 years old but anyways you know i had this i had this desire to play for uh for for the basketball team [Music] and you know you you see how how good or not as good you you are used forever so we got into about maybe the second or third week of uh of trial to practice and it came to the point where there were there were time for for what's called the cuts that's that means that the ones that are not good yes that's how you see you later you didn't make it so here i am trying now you know thinking i'm pretty decent bueno well as the coach calls me in uh william you didn't make it he said william carina he said but what you lack better look at the falsta is the drive you lack the push you know there's other guys around here that's something that you don't have wow you can say wow that that hurts that hurts you know somebody that thought of what they don't like saying you know you're you're you're not very good we're all all winners here we're all really good at what we do and in reality in reality there's and i'm going to put myself there there are so many things that i'm not good at i cause that if somebody would say that hey you're really good at that they would be lying because i know i'm not good at certain things you can ask my wife i try my best but there but there are so many lies about about how how good you are and in reality and every hand will say oh i'd love to serve the lord but how many of us fail at times you know what i thank god that we have the pastor i'd rather have somebody like that then somebody's saying oh it's okay you're you're good the grace of god will will will will straighten you out la gracias you know i don't want anybody like that in my life you're not gonna see me because that's not gonna help us out that's not gonna help you that's not gonna help me out no level because i'm not a big right but i love to speak on animals and if anybody gets a little hungry i'm sorry you know it starts its life off way up in the mountains [Music] it starts itself up in the in the in a tiny stream and it starts itself up with not even knowing who his parents are it doesn't even know who his mom is or doesn't even know whose daddy is that there is something inside of them that sustains them you know i laugh sometimes as as you hear these documentaries on on animals is has made them the way that they are today and it's it's funny for me to hear that because we know that that's not the truth we know that there is something that has been placed inside of it by god almighty so here is this little little salmon salmon starts off as an egg in pieces starts growing and growing and one day as it's going down the river india el it finds itself in that it was born in fresh water and aguas fresca and it finds itself now in salt water it finds itself in the ocean and here he is surrounded by all these other salmon and here they go on living their life they're they're they're growing crescendo and they travel anywhere from two thousand to three thousand miles uh away from where they were born remember in the ocean if you ever if you've ever been underneath the ocean you know just fyi just in case you didn't know information you can't see very far no underneath water no puerto so it's not like us where we can you know get on top of a mountain and say hey oh there's south there's north there's east northwest they're underneath water so here they are and they spend about four years of their life but something something inside of them after about four years this was the cuatro ano there's there's a there's a calling inside of them and it starts to it starts to um as they mature and as they get to adult size they long to go home it's something that god puts inside of them let's go to proverbs 27 17. and this is really this is this is so awesome how god works and this is a very uh uh familiar scripture this is a scripture that uh that was uh when we had our our men's meetings and all that we would start off with it says iron sharpener so a man sharpeneth the countenance because they've just they discovered years ago the question was how do these fish get back home it was such a mystery era you talk about millions and millions of fish that have been out in the ocean that are two three four thousand miles from where they were born after all this time traveling in the ocean how do they know how to get back [Music] and it shows them where to go it tells them to go east or to go west but that's not the amazing thing remember there's thousands of rivers that pour into the ocean hundreds of thousands of rivers so here's this salmon navigating but god has given him an incredible sense of smell um so what does that mean guest significance well he gets to the point where he finds the river in cuentral rio remember he's going from sea salt back to fresh water [Music] that's oh but it doesn't stop there that's not where the end is just because god has shown you where to go and we read the scripture i walk by faith and not by sight and we know where to go we're on the right path there's still a one eye obstacles that are gonna face us but thank god we're on the right river amen amen so you can tell the devil when he brings you stuff in your life i'm saying that you're not gonna make it he starts smelling a little bit more i'm not on the i'm not where i should be thank god i'm not where i used to be but i'm on the right path that that uh that smell is familiar it is something that that is in my memory that i that i know i'm on the right path so during this time durant's the largest uh fresh water migration route of any salmon salmon is on the yukon river it's yukon and the migration that that they've recorded the longest migration from the time that they leave the ocean to the time that they get on the river is 1900 miles so imagine imagine you're three thousand miles in the ocean and now you've come to the river but you've still got 1900 miles left now this this [Music] that's the time when the eagles come out and it's not just a few you know but there's hundreds of thousands sienas that go down these rivers the biggest one that they've seen along this particular river rio particular over five million salmon so here they are as they're swimming goodness there's a waterfall they said wow he said wow it was sure easy when we were coming down the mountain into you see when you when you go when you go with the flow in the korean you think that you have no problems it's what easy know the pastor said the ministry said that serving the lord was hard you're still going with the flow that cries anybody been and here they go akivan they've measured the salmon and medidon salmon that has jumped almost 10 feet over a waterfall avrincado [Music] wow so here he is but not only does he have to face the falls not only does he have to jump over the waterfall but [Music] and here is that salmon just going up battling every day now i want you to know something and i and i really love what brother caleb said this morning and he said many times that so many times that we have just just meat just coming out of our teeth so much word that has that has been brought forth there's so much uh there's so much word that that we have heard and yet this salmon as soon as he stops or as soon as he enters into fresh water he eats no more yeah he lives off of what he has eaten and that sustains him for the journey i want to ask you youth i want to ask you adults this evening has whatever the what the word the word that has been brought no i need more oh necesito why am i we have received enough there is so much word already so much life that has been given to life but yet we ask for more but here are these salmon is there going up the stream they don't eat anymore they live off [Music] the smell is not familiar you know the devil tries to bring you something in your life tries to bring you through a crossroad hey this this route is better it might take you another route but there has to be something inside of us when we when we start going around when we start comparing it to what what the word has given us [Music] that doesn't smell very well that doesn't that doesn't smell like home no well imagine 1900 miles navigating rivers and streams until one day one day they come here this is exactly through all these waterfalls through all these things that are that are coming against them the time for them is what they struggled what they live to get to that place so that they could die but uh you know we talk about so much of living and the world says you know what live your life live it to the fullest vive lo maximo oh you can live any kind of life you want what is we read but imagine something this morning young people everyone this morning where you could die so when we so when we hear the word of god when we hear what's been brought to us by our by our prophets by our you just a church member has it made you that just well i go to church just because um just because my my cousin goes there well i said well this is all i know so what else am i going to do this is all i know all i know is going to church and that's all that my experience was was just coming to church you can come to church every day and that and that's fine that's that's okay but we want more we want more imagine you know we feel like we have to make all these changes in life i i better stop doing all of this that's good if you want to stop doing that praise that have been through the worst things that can happen we're still here still here we're still here fighting but how many want to die tonight you know i like what the youth said that we have arrived amen is that right that we have arrived it's correct well that's what the salmon says as well salmon says i have arrived and i have arrived to die to myself but how many can truly say that that they want to die out to themselves amen amen read a quote from brother out in the ocean you can find them it says what we call humpies the salmon when they come up there when they go before that run comes salt water but they're actually freshwater fish here they come right up there and spawn about every four years and die as soon as uh [Applause] there's nothing that you can do about it but the law of nature makes them knowing that they go up there and spawn in the hole and spawn in the hole and die imorie brother branham says you just can't beat god's love thank god for that remember he places something inside of you he places a thirst inside of you for him but it's up to you it's up to us how many can respond to the lord and say father responded father here i am lord i'm ready to die i don't i i'm tired of this it's part of [Music] lord every hour i need [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] god hey man let's sing it i [Music] surrendered [Music] [Music] with every hand in the building
