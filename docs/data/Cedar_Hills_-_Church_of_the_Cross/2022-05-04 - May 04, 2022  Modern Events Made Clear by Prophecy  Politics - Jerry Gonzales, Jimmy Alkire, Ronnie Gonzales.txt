jerry i'm also mr man iranian jerry i'm gonna just basically serve as a narrator i might say a few things at the end or i may ask them questions so you all just pray for us [Music] many of you that have studied the message don't know what this is talking about but to you that are newer and maybe they haven't studied the message that much yes you might not understand this scripture right out of the gate but if you'll just listen [Music] so let's stand for the reading of the words and i'm going to jump around here a little bit in this chapter 18 of the book of revelation revelation 17. if you go back and read chapter 17 and then 18 you'll get a good context of what it's talking about for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich to the abundance of her delicacies now we're going to go to verse 8. therefore shall her plagues come in one day death morning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for the strong is the lord who judges her polo en solo dia ventranzos plagas muertes is and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her bernie reyes incendio standing up far off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas the great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is your judgment come and the merchants of the earth shall weep and warn over her for no man buys their merchandise anymore now let's go to verse and it's good to see people with open bibles praise the lord jesus yes the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and waiting los mercaderes estas cosas and staying alas alas the great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls for one hour so great riches is come to nothing and every shipmaster and all the company in ships and seders and as many as trade by sea and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like to this great city is rejoice over her you heaven and you holy apostles and prophets for god has avenged you on her leg amen verse to 22-24 verse 22 and the voice of harpers and musicians and the pipers and the trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in you no craftsman whatsoever crap there be shall be found any more in you the sound of the millstone shall be heard no more in you at all and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in you and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be no more hurt at all in you for your merchants were great men of the earth and by your sorceries were nations deceit and in her was found the blood of the prophets and of the saints and of all that were slain upon here in india muertos lord jesus we thank you for your word now lord jesus it should bless us as we enter into your word by your spirit lord we thank you now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen so we're going to start off here and i'm going to turn it over to brother ronnie here and decided amen bless everyone well jimmy thank you for the precious word all right i'd like to start off with uh a few scriptures very well-known scriptures [Music] you know as i was sitting up here the holy spirit changed it for me change the order of it [Music] now let's turn to one of probably the most famous or the most famous uh scripture in malachi 4 5. [Music] amen if you were to turn that to that with me it says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse you want to hear some great teachings on that right there brother jimmy's got some good ones all right let's turn to another very famous scripture amongst our ranks uh revelations 10 7. apocalypse after he says behold i send you then he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and again another very famous one here yo ephesians 4 4 11. and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers constitute [Music] for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ okay so i just wanted to say as bro jimmy was saying about we're speaking on modern events in you know we've uh i believe we're a country that has that has been built upon great presidents on some of these presidents right one of the most famous ones is brother george washington come on jorge washington how he would how we know he when he was there in the valley the battle of valley forge you know how he was how these temperatures were so cold freezing temperatures not like like today right well but he was out there and he was praying in in without shoes on orlando it was snowing yeah he was out there praying to the lord you wanna see it another one of the great ones brother abraham lincoln now now how many know that abraham lincoln it is said that he had only had two books you know but we see it we see these great men and all these great achievements that they that they dip in the year 1789 the bill of rights was introduced foreign [Music] we all know what the bill of rights is right and in 1971 it was adopted and put into effect you know and and one of the things one i want to speak about this evening we're talking about the amendments and and the one i'm going to be speaking about is the first amendment and under this first amendment we have freedom of speech the expression freedom of press freedom of religion the right to assemble and the right to petition you know if we could say for if it wasn't for these great men we wouldn't have these amendments the first amendment it guarantees the freedom of speech [Music] it gives americans the right to express themselves without worrying about the government it is the most basic component of free speech this is the freedom this freedom is similar to freedom of speech in that it allows people to express themselves through a provocation and then the first amendment is guaranteeing the freedom of religion it prohibits the government prohibits the government from establishing a state religion and from forming one and one favoring one religion over the other religion and then the first amendment protects the freedom to peacefully assemble with a group of people for social economical political or religious purposes [Music] so so our founding fathers that that is the rights we have today the rights you have right now at this very moment to be here sit it together congregated it is because of these these men the reason why we can broadcast on youtube youtube which would be classified under the freedom of oppress is because of these these great men especially i don't know about you all but i love to come to church i love to hear the word of god i love to hear the messages that brother branham brought i mean i'd love to read them you know but this was all made possible because of men that were that were inspired of god to to create these first amendments hey man i don't know if you can everyone can join with me today to give a round of applause for these men that that allowed us to [Applause] and this bright age is going on at the same time that this lady ocean church age is going on and ladies how many remember what lady ocean means [Music] means justice for the people significant it also means rights of the people it also means now now as i was looking this up and i was breaking down the word of ladies [Music] and i'm probably not going to say this right he said no you guys still correct them but i believe it's dicey is it dicey did you spell it d-i-k-e d-kis something like that i don't know how to say it to be honest with you so who now that now that word there now that was that came from uh from a greek goddess is now the first one was was her name was famous which meant which and there it means divine law divine law means divine significance and uh and famous now you might not think this is important right now but give it a few minutes and this is going to be pretty important now witnessed the birth of apollo witness the birth of apollo now her persona is a person is a blindfolded woman with a sword in one hand and a pair of balances in the other espares so when you go look at it says all uh um they're wretched poor blind and ladies because they're looking at the spirit of the spirit of god was looking to that this goddess that the spirit was going to be upon the people in this time the spirit of this goddess [Music] and it is said that she has little to no idea what's going on but the spirit of this goddess what does it cause among the population of the world it causes the worship of the creation more than of the creator cause it brings back the spirit of the ancient empire of rome romano where they would actually worship naked women in the time everything that our sisters have to confront every day of their life so be aware of that all the ideologies that you can they're getting you to worship the creation more than the creators you know so so ladies you see it's moral decay it's people that are are conforming to this age because everybody wants their rights and that and that's why i gave a little bit of the background first of of these great men because we were born with these rights and the people with very little understanding as as this goddess has you know we the the people don't realize or or they are since they're conforming to this age to this day into the spirit they don't they don't realize that they have the rights already so what do we see that's what's going on i remember brother caleb about a couple of years ago our pastor was kind of talking about something similar to this and he says he says they don't they the only way that they can have more rights as if they take yours away and it's not that they're giving them rights it's they're taking yours away you know we see we see nowadays and how in its political standpoint is so many different things that are going on in the world right now and it's all because of this day and age and the spirit that we're living in right now amen can i get an amen to that you know you know these these politicians jesus politicos you know you know whether it be the radical left radical whether it be the radical right they're all there's always a double standard siempre they're over here saying the very thing is and then the left is saying in certain terms they're saying certain words and then the right is saying you can't say them very the unity of the one god in the one church i want to ask you a question what are the three main political parties worldwide and if you could put the definition of those up there real quick communism a system in which goods are owned and common and are available to now is communism a creation or a communism you want to answer that for me communism as we'll read here in the unity of one god in the one church paragraph 39. did you think that in this russia they have a false pentecost they are that's the work of the devil they try to force all men into communism intention for saratov where every man has everything commonly do you know that was the condition of the church under the holy spirit holy spirit on the day of pentecost in the other pentagons that the people sold their possessions and laid them at the feet of the disciples and they distribute them to every man as they need it and now the devil has come around and got into the world and made a political power to force man to to that yeah entrance god does not force man to do anything you do it in your own free will he can warn you his presence in supressencia to make him your savior but satan has perverted god's plan up everything to his own son did you ever think of catholicism and the catholic church is trying to make every person a catholic like this it won't work it's under a man-made program did you ever think of the protestant church under the federation of churches another word for this world council of churches it is trying to force all these little churches out iglesias and it will happen that you will not be able to go to church unless you belong to the union of churches then little places like this will certainly pay for it but we got a scripture that says they're not little flocks it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom before turn it back over yeah did you notice though the political condition the condition political has been caused by this fallen church russia why did it turn communists we could read the quote but i don't want to take the time he says because of the filthiness and low downness of the catholic church so the direct relation between the condition of the churches [Music] is what determines what spirit is going to arrange in the political realm i don't know but you can get a hold of that no no oh you know by the way i i take my ties in often this is my church your friend is it your church don't don't don't misinterpret that nami this is our church how many can say this is our church the condition of our church the conditions will determine whether a spirit of politics can get among us to try to divide us and the spirit of god in the spirit of will never be divided nunca ceremos then all these messages that we hear they can't go online this right here is a direct attack from satan on the church and the crazy thing is that this is even a new spirit tremendous question around for a long time what was one of the four things that that uh adam lost he lost the power of the spoken word oh so this spirit of cancer culture [Music] you know but uh let's see here time's going really fast so so so since this is it's under attack and that's the natural political yes what about the spiritual spiritual right because there's two vines that grow together right we heard about the political the political powers that came up right but there's two powers in the world which is which is god insane so so this spirit or is this spiritual it tried to silence jesus jesus they try to silence the apostles all the martyrs throughout all these ages i was talking to my wife the other day and i was telling her like what brutal things that these people had to go through for the gospel i recommend you read the fox book of martyrs you know they even did it to brother branham where he was in germany and they wanted to kill him oh then they got to and they tried to silence the voice but this this is here's is is where i think it says it starts to get good for me bro jim i'll go for it are you all ready we all we all we all have we we've all heard the voice of god in these last days right yes but then silence the voice if we can say it that way and then by silencing a voice well it's it's good to go and play a tape every day [Music] every day that's that's right brother every day i'm sorry i gotta get comfortable and i was telling you i wanted this one i wanted to preach take it easy history repeats itself right and all these all this these things that we see through all through the ages throughout all these years it's it's it's no different today and please forgive me i i mean this i mean this no throwing and no one no no but i do throw out of spirit gentlemen if you can give me uh what's the message what is a vision and i believe that america is going to get her last call this year you close america that america is either going to receive price or is going to turn him down flatly this year now let's bring that to today that was in 1956. are we turning him down this year each person take inventory of themselves right look what they're doing down in florida observe in florida to jacco uh look what they're doing all the way how could there ever come how many are part of the church it comes to its very height then it's always the best yes sir and god is working it all together see there is people that are trying to silence that voice and a lot of times we think almost it's just it's just they're just right at the fightful ministry you know but but sisters that spirit works in uh on a different way with you sisters you know has satan tried to has stopped you from voicing the word to at home has saint made us so busy with with the things of of of our household no has that been now i'm gonna have to finish with this right here gentlemen if you would uh if you would please play the audio clip uh i asked you to please 17 15 and you'll find the bible says the water switched out so it is sickness and multitudes and people in tongues all right boys what a horrible thing first drips himself on the sea of life no pirates of god loose voting with the tithes to hear the roar of the great cataracts the falls what a horrible thing it would be to a soul-drifting voice of many waters what is this boy it's a judgment the bias of the ministers through the holy spirit that's crying out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many waters cry out sickness and molotov the voice of those seven stars in his hands every church age preaching the baptism the holy ghost the baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues the power of god the resurrection of christ the second coming divine judgment the voice of many wonders from this one it looked like the son of man that's where i want to be and that's where i want to make my opposing statement how could these this fightful ministry brother jimmy minister queen to play how can it have failed when it came forth from one like unto the son of man if that voice failed if the fightful ministry failed then the voice of the prophet failed because that fightful ministry ministry was produced by the one like unto the son of man amen god bless you amen praise the lord how many are happy [Applause] we're not going to have time to really go into politics of what's happening on earth and right now yeah in our nation the confederation of churches the confederacy iglesias is rising to fight communists to fight what a horrible people we used to think of that all communism over there yeah but our nation has been eat out with socialism and communism socialism a system of society or group living group in which there is no private property everything is owned and controlled by the state today the means of production is controlled by the states that's the fight we have in washington right now is in washington hour with this new agenda and right in our own government many have sold out to socialism and communism in our own on the on the computer so they can read it really quick first corinthians 14 33 for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all the churches of the saints i had a couple of others here but i'm going to i'm going to skip here just to get to the gist of it here so so we see all this right left politics and all it is really is just a big ball of confusion yes john 16 13 says pero juan this is put up on the computer so they could read it how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whosoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come hello you know the two powers there's either god or satan and brother branham says what it is today it's it's really a modern day tower of babel is what it is the other side says contrary and it's disinformation to the other side so it's confusion to the people there's confusion in the churches confusion nobody knows what to turn and what is truth anymore so it's a modern day tower of babel modern and i'll have to rush a little bit here that's okay no i'm going to have to rush a little bit um so let's go to uh jesus christ's name yesterday today and forever first quote and we believe that we're living in that type of day now when sputniks are in the skies and the modern day we believe that jesus is coming soon everybody it's later than you think right yes but i want to go back to a little bit of the past as well so those that know obviously that have lived in the united states and to those you know the newcomers i want to you know be able to explain what happened here but it's due on may john f kennedy john f kennedy a very charismatic man very loved of the people and it says that the the crooked machines during that time are the ones that elected him the crooked machine las machina striker so very very a very famous man but in in 1961 so he started what's called a race to the moon the united states and the russians were battling to see who could get to the moon first so he even made a declaration that we needed to put more effort into into beating the russians to the moon so we know that he never saw that in his administration because of the assassination administration but the efforts paid off in 1969 in the mission that they called apollo apollo we heard brother ronnie speak on that a little bit but it so it was there was a total of 11 space flights um excuse me let me let me go back here now to get ahead of myself the the apollo was the nasa program that resulted in apollo um i'm making a total of 11 space flights and walking on the moon [Music] but there were six of them six of the seven flights and keep those details in uh and uh keep those details with you okay there were six of the seven flights and those flights it took place between 1969 and 1972 okay tomorrow enter and i can't help but but look at history repeating itself again let me explain we have we had a catholic administration back then in john f kennedy we have another catholic administration under joe biden administration during that time was an uh the civil rights movement a uh and so they say that they're working but we see space flight today elon musk sending a bunch of people to space all over miramasa elon musk but there's one coming in 2025 that caught my attention attention it was in time because the peace of the second administration paralleling the first wasn't set yet so so we see the first mission was apollo the second one will be called it'll be under the mission called artemis artemis iii they call it which artemis iii was the goddess that was worshipped in in the in the uh the church age of ephesus artemis was the twin to apollo artemis so who was this apollo queen era so we see that there's a lot of greek mythology that was mixed in back then apollo was the greek god he was god of the sun dios del sol and light is a loose he looked good they said he was they called him the averter of evil he was an olympic god and he loved music and poetry he was known for healing and plagues healing and plagues prophecy and knowledge order and beauty order and he was an archer so so when i when i saw him i started to see him and you and you'll see why in a little bit i hope i can get to it but so he was an archer and he was a gun and and so he says so you look at the the four horsemen of revelation right uh caballos and apocalypses you see the first horse rider how was he el primerginette he looked harmless he had a bonus and he was an archer as well so keep that in mind okay so apollo if you guys want to study it remember the four horsemen of revelation apocalypse how many writers were there brothers nobody else what if i tell you was the same writer all the way through many griefs seem to have supposed that apollo stands for destroyer assembler see how it looks good see how he starts off good but he was known as a destroyer he held what's called the delphic tripod but watch the characteristics of apollo characteristics remember i'm getting to all this to get to a point there was a race to the moon um so we see here so there was a purpose of why he wanted to get there first apollo is concerned with the health and education of children watch this the long hair which is a prerogative or an entitlement or right of the boys was cut off the the el nino era cortado at a certain age and dedicated to apollo apollo so so we see it creeping into into into society today remember that it's a system we look at the catholic church brother branham said i'm not against the people you see rome has tainted and has her hand in everything so so he go you go you see with the children what are they doing in the in the schools today they're creeping into the schools and teaching four-year-olds they're teaching them about sex and how to choose gender so so apollo had he was concerned with the teaching to the children he was a some writer he connects the name apollo apollo with with in which case apollo would be the the god of flocks and herds now we see okay don't don't think about about the sheepfold that flocks of animals because today the flocks of people or the masses are influenced by the narrative that's being pushed out today keep in mind the system okay in all this keep in mind the system behind it all right so so the so let me let me read this here before i watch this here and one and one of the um um the quotes here i have a brother branham i don't know if you guys have it uh exposition of the seven church ages which was joined with with the emperor worship cult means of atonement making amends wrongdoing plato said of him he explains to men the institution of temples sacrifices and services to deities sacrificials besides the rights connected with death and the afterlife he says which offered the people that are living unless they belong to the temple worship of apollo almenos anyone who refused to join in the idolatrous feasts orgies was barred from these first century unions [Music] in order to be part of the social and commercial life [Music] one had to be a practicing pagan idolater so we see like i said keep in mind the system okay in all this what what was the rush to the moon i better just hit these points here because so so the whole point of getting to the moon if we know the types under the catholic administration [Music] anybody know what brother branham calls apollo apollo he actually speaks of him we just read it and he calls him the modern modern-day pope that just blew me away the pope who is literally apollo and modern version has taught the people to join themselves to idols the roman church has become a false prophetess to the people because she has taken away the word of the lord from the people but you see don't just leave it in catholicism ronnie just finished talking about them silencing the voice you ever wonder why brother branham says one man can be a denomination [Music] if i can find my my notes i think i got them all mixed up but you see him in revelations 9 11. why does all this matter is important because it i was going to say it shows something that's coming no estradiol it shows what's already here it shows the system behind it all systems influence behind what's of the it moisture satanic power influence in politics in the schools in the churches and in the individual individual because if we notice see not that the gentile dispensation started how the dispensation holy man worship of a holy man what if i tell you it's gonna end up the same way if you look at nebuchadnezzar's the only destroyer i see you was that king of the bottomless pit his name was apollyon which in the manuscripts apollo and napoleon were the same person it was because he came from doctrines without foundation which was the bottomless pit because that's what doctrines that are false they are doctrines without foundation fundamentals so that's why that's why brother branham calls him a modern-day pope so like i said so we have to be very careful that we don't we're not set up like that as the system like i said i'm talking down to the individual level now individual it's an individual affair individual but so so in finishing here we're going to just finish here so that so so we're going back to the moon estamos in 2025. in the religious or political realm in a reno political what you're seeing right now so in 2025 so you'll see she's the goddess of the moon and she's also the hunter so brother branham says now brother brother brown says when the pope visited jerusalem he typed it at her as a church he he said that moon completely blacked out and he says and he's coming here too he says so when this takes hold i mean it's here already we see those demons those locusts and revelations uh uh verse three i believe revelation nine three pneumonia and apocalypse you see these demons right that will come and torment the people this is like locusts what just so happens at apollo's press was a locust one of them one of his quests was the locust so that the only thing i can see is it it ends with the worship of a holy holy man and in the 70 weeks of daniel you guys were able to get that drawing daniel so you see the you see that image there right that nebuchadnezzar's dream on the bottom right there the top right hand corner looks like a catcher for a perfect man to meet there right the only escape that we have this is is when that when we reach that stature that stone in your life now okay bring it down to you to your life when sane is sealed out god is so that's the only escape that i see we got to stay in the word young people you've got to learn the word learn the message believe that's enough for one night but i would like to finish with this quote out of the message jezebel religion paragraph 124. lord if they're of these worldly systems are dying and the jezebel system will smother it out what they want to have live by the hidden spring like elijah vivir escondido served through the time of famine and god give them the holy ghost now dios and hereafter forever young people openness what you confront every day when you go to school you go to work you say i believe the word i believe the message everything around you is trying to smother out the voice of the
