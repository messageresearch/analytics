comfortable in this time I want you for you to I I want to appreciate our pastor brother Caleb my general for that opportunity for giving me this opportunity to be able to direct myself to the precious purchased of the Lord Jesus Christ and our Minister brethrens that are with him that God will bless our brother Lorenzo that he he deserves the best open up your scriptures in Isaiah the 57th chapter and verse 4 15 Isaiah 57 and 15. if you can can you please and we're going to to honor the word of the the scripture says Isaiah 57 15. I want you to notice this verse this verse is in past tense do you say it says he has already said it is in time past that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holi I want you to notice this next portion I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite once senor emos Lord we have heard your word bless your people in the name of the Lord read it if I would place a title to this message I would would speak it and I would name it humbleness I want to speak on humbleness I believe this theme this title even though we have it we have heard it and we have preached according to it is been very misunderstood because if in reality we would capture we would understand what the Holy Spirit has to teach to his people through the message what humbleness is the rapture would have already happened the great work and the powerful Works would have already been done that's why a Christian always comes to the service to add to him words until the perfect day until you can see it is something that already happened and it will not be moved from what has already been spoken we are speaking about I want you to notice the titles the Lord of hosts he is the one that says psalmist David said that before his presence [Applause] the mountains melt as silk and even the heavens and the heavens they speak about his Justice God yes the almighty one became a man John 1 14 says it came and dwelt with us by him were all things made easy nail and without him nothing that was made would ever have been made we are speaking of one grand great the Bible says that in him and the life was the light of man and that True Light it illuminated men because from his fullness we all drink from gracias Grace upon Grace foreign we're speaking about humbleness brother Branham teaches us Jehovah say foreign Jehovah [Music] foreign he formed himself in humility the almighty God that receives honor and Glory that the Terrapins they cover them they cover their feet he takes away his takes off his crap he takes away all his vests to dress himself and he formed himself in humility not only as men but he became your Redeemer what is his name you know what his name means he is your Redeemer [Applause] Jesus dressed himself with humility Jehovah was formed in humility but now Jesus dresses himself with humility you know you know what that means the children they cannot dress themselves that we have been called by Redemption he dressed himself with humility he had many many choices Kings and majesty and different Christian different vestures he dresses himself with humility and the scripture says because the son of man did not come to be served he came to serve and to give his life that is the humility he dressed himself that way and when he dressed himself he not only dressed himself with humility you know okay but the god that feels all heaven when it came to Earth he took the work that was the lowest that could exist he took a towel and he he wrapped it and he called the disciples and said to them Lord master and listen and you do well because I am the master and the Lord yes have washed your feet we're speaking about humility yours God Zeus Jesus in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bottles all of Heaven all of the universe was was emptied into this Tabernacle called Jesus the the flesh was not God but what was inside Jesus what's the fullness of the godhead bodily scripture tells me dead fools Jesus even though you're being God didn't take that he didn't take he did not think it to be robbery to say yes do it this way do it this other way he didn't do it that way that he said that he emptied himself that he took it out of himself and he humbled himself he says and he became obedient because humility as always obedience humility obedience ability has Works humility over us as works Jesus became humble in obedience and obedience unto the death of the Cross and it's the death of the cross this brethren that's this Historia this is history but the scriptures the Apostle Paul foreign [Applause] when we speak of humility oh brother I have humility and we all have uh humility or humbleness we have humility and we we humble ourselves to them against that we know beneficial that we can take out a benefit from the humility you know that you can take advantage foreign I never call the pastor and when we are in problems we call and then we become humble understand me that's the humbleness that we know [Music] the Apostle Paul says wait no wait wait wait a minute sorry the same mind one thing is Jesus said this word that whosoever follow me whosoever who is he speaking to who so ever whosoever is in salsa that that will exalt himself will be a beast broken when the Bible says that Jesus humbled himself unto death it tells me Jesus that Jesus lived a broken life word broken means Brokenness or broken means that you humbled in yourself and you take your will and you place it to the center it's on somebody else's words Jesus lived a broken life he had a right have a wife Jesus friends to have children but he broke his heart for not to do his words but the will of him that had sent him that is Brokenness God had already spoken I abide is broken heart you know what you know what the unction is for eign you know what the anointing is for eign and I would always ask myself it's Lord how I would have loved is to be there with the disciples I would have followed Jesus from afar I would have loved to have heard to to hear what he would pray how he would pray he would say in his prayer I ask is there someone here like like that foreign you have loved to have been there that was a desire that I had my whole life but hear this you know what the anointing is for eign Thomas prays put your name James When you pray When you pray in this manner Our Father which art in heaven thy kingdom come there's a lot of loud that is a prayer oh come let your kingdom come thy kingdom come what is the kingdom of God it's not food and drink let's put that in the spiritual power in the spirit foreign for that you know what Jesus would pray by the father make your people free father they're yours those that you have given me Satan has them bounds because your word says because you have sent me to Freedom Jesus that was the prayer thy kingdom come yes [Applause] oh Lord Hallowed be thy name Lord help me we are praying because if you're hot we'll teach you how to pray that is humility was given for eign don't take it personally pray for them Jesus when Jesus was in the cross when he had come for them because he came to his own he was him that the scripture said his friends were there Jesus called them friends then it would see their enemy on the cross but Jesus Amigo he would see them as His Friends Lord where did you receive those wounds in the house of my friends as they spit upon him as they cursed him on the cross Jesus was hanging there father don't hold it on their account put it on their account I forgive them humility Jesus said When you pray you can pray 20 consecutive hours I know what that is pray for 3 for three second of days even in that Mr Mark because if you don't are not watchful the same prayer will put you in an arrogant or a pride oh uh an exalted place it's not the prayer but it is the prayer prayer is just an instrument Jesus as Jesus said when you pray who is he speaking to well when you pray closing the door or in praying I was the pirate to our father that is in secret where does God dwell where brother in secret you will find him in no other place in secret no one knows brother Diego where is God in secret foreign yes amen will reward you in public are ye there let's cancel for their rest the supernatural powers where God foreign you don't need to make big long prayers I want you to hear this when you see Supernatural things that happen from behind up open that is the result of many many hours in secret but when you hear a lot of words in the Pulpit is that there was not a lot of time made in in secret yes that was the secret of the Primitive Church they knew is that secret of humility that is the problem brother Brandon says that God demands of us that we be of one heart what has happened like a million messages [Applause] and more division but now there is a turning of the corners that's where the holy spirit is if the musicians can come here to the front I'm going to ask you a question you know if you had the opportunity to have an interview with brother bran what would you do what would you do would come to you and tell you hermano Diego brother Diego I'm going to give you the opportunity so that you could have an interview with my servant brother William Marion Branham what would you do foreign think about it what would you do what would you ask him what would you speak about God gave me that opportunity the Apostle Paul said a Cristo priced I did not know him in the flesh but I knew him in the spirit God's servant one day in a vision I don't know if it was a vision or what it was that it was a small place and the first thing I encounter is an angel and he asked me the angel asked me do you want to hear do you want to see brother Branham I I felt that my heart started to be faster you see she said yes yes I I got emotions I want to see him there was some stairs that would take that took me to a second story like a like an upper room when I go up the stairway I could see a couch and I could see brother Branham sitting there he was like like he was resting it's like if he was tired I see him I see this man what would you do Brethren yo Mia I simply I get close to him I want you to notice what I what I what I'm going to say he's like in a recliner knee Manos and I place my hand over his hand me mentally and in my mind I told him brother Branham how can I be more humble how foreign I I bent my need to honor him as a man of God I was meditated in my heart he stands up takes off his handsome and he places his hands for me he starts praying for me for me and he starts praying for you yes when you humble yourself
