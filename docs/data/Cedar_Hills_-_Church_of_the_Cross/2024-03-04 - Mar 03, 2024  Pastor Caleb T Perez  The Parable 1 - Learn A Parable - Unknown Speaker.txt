we're going to see a video from our Sunday school immediately following is going to be our sister Ruthie hill hill has a testimony and a special right after God bless you Romans 8 verse4 for as many as are L by the spirit of God they are the son of God Romans 8 verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage against to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA Romans 8: 16 the spirit self will bear witness with the spirit that we are the children of God for I reckon that the sufferings of this present times are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US Romans 8:8 moreover whom he predestinate then he also called whom he called then he also Justified and whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us Ro Romans 8 verse 30 and 31 God it's so wonderful God love it's so wonderful God love it's so wonderful God wonderful love so high you can't go over it [Music] you can't go it so you can't go God's wonderful love God love it's so wonderful God love it's so wonderful God love is so wonderful God wonderful love so high can't go over it so can't go under it so wide you can't go around it God's wonderful love God bless you all I want to start this testimony off by saying God is still the god of not only Miracles but as of healing and his promises never fail back in December I went to a specialist to be seen so we could get some answers funny enough it was actually the specialist brother Fabio went to see after talking with our pastor we all felt it was the right decision for me to go see him after meeting with the doctor he felt like I have might have an underlying condition condition called Mass Cell Activation Syndrome I had the blood work and test done and was waiting my final appointment to get the results but a few weeks ago I had an episode in church and brother Diego came to pray for me and when he did he said to me sister those Spirits are not in your body anymore you are free at the time I couldn't understand it because I was experiencing symptoms but I just clung on to that promise as the weeks went by and things got worse I just knew that the darkest hour means Dawn is just in sight last Thursday I had my final appointment and when the doctor was going over the results he looked puzzled and I knew it could be either really good or really bad news he looked up and said it's seems as though your blood your blood work came back perfect and all your tests are [Applause] negative I looked up at my parents and they both smiled he then began to say how sometimes the tests don't always show the results correctly but after the meeting ended my dad looked at me and and said the Lord is showing you that through your blood work his promise and what brother Diego said was the truth and you are healed I believe the lord gave me a double portion by not only the healing process but a miracle as well and although this symptoms keep trying to harm my body I am standing here to say that God has and will finish the work and I am fully without a doubt healed in Jesus name I just want to thank everyone who has prayed with me and fought with me I wouldn't be standing here today without all of you I love you all very much this song is my testimony and I pray it's a [Music] blessing so many moments my heart

many how many come back to tonight we have a a video and and some testim so we pray that you come back we want to start a new series this morning and we want to entitle the series the parable those of you that the last message that I spoke there there was uh I I mentioned it briefly on a parable but um but the Lord kept bringing this to me and I and I feel led to to go into this a little more we're happy to to have the visitors that are here brother God bless you my my Primos David sister Kathy God bless you it's nice to have you with us amen and uh and then the other the other uh uh visitors that are here God bless you I don't know you but God bless you God knows you and that's all that matters amen amen so we're we're grateful to God and and so well let's get right into it right why wait let's let's jump in now and uh you can be so kind to turn in your Bibles to the book of St Matthew the 13th chapter and verse 10 and 11 here Jesus is speaking to the multitude when you have it you can say Amen am amen it reads like this there's a few few pages still going so we'll we'll let you find it we want everybody to to eat this morning amen reads like this and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you I I I I want you to know if you can put your name there this morning because it is is given unto Caleb now I want we're going to read it again but put your name there because he says it is given unto Caleb I'm going to say it again let's put our names there one more time because it is given unto Caleb to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given one more scripture Mark the 4th chapter and verse 33 and 34 remember why do you speak in parables in verse 33 says and with many such Parables spake he the word unto them as they they were able to hear it not easy sometimes huh but he spake unto them as they were able to hear it what were they hearing with some people hear with this ear the natural ear but then there are those that that hear with a spiritual ear so once again as they were able to hear it that's how faith comes right right but without a parable spake he not unto them but watch this now and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples amen may God had his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen here we have something tremendous the more I look into it the more I can say wow wow Parables I I I I began to see this in a whole different light now if we were to ask you the question real quick Parable once again we should all know the meaning of the word Parable amen can you help me this morning what is the Parable all right so it sounds like a few are giving it their best shot right it is simply an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning okay now now now keep that in mind as we go through this message it also means when you place One Thing by the side of another thing it's to compare one thing with another a parable deals with the likeness and the similitude if I were to ask then the question what is the purpose of the parable Jesus could have preached many different ways he could have he could have expounded in different ways there are many different kind of teachings or ways to teach but if you notice here Jesus chose to speak to the people with Parables and and it's not by coincidence that he speaks by a parable there there's something that a parable does and that is that it brings the natural and the spiritual together you know sometimes as human beings we're we we're very carnal in a lot of ways so many times we see things and and every time we look at things it seems like we're always looking at it in a in a natural or carnal way am I talking to anyone this morning we look at things and why am I sick this happen to me why am I going through this but we never look any farther other than what our five senses tell us we don't seem to want to really search out the spiritual aspect of it and so we go through life and we're down in the dumps because things just don't go our way but once again Jesus spoke in Parables the purpose once again is that he would to he was going to bring the the natural and the spiritual together and that's what we're after this morning we're after going beyond our five senses and we're after going to things that really matter and that is bringing them together how many would like to bring the natural and the spiritual together this morning I believe that we're here for that very reason we hear many times that this saying well the natural types the spiritual and it is true when you put the natural and the spiritual together it's like putting a your your left hand and your right hand together although they they are they are different in one sense but when you bring them together it's it's like a mirror image of of each other right it's like a mirror you see them and they they fit perfectly together now now when we see this natural type in the spiritual I started out my message in Poland and I asked simply the question the same question that I have asked here that I asked here not long ago and that was how many of you are perfect so if I were to ask you again this morning how many perfect people do we have locked on right now how many perfect people do we have about half the church is perfect it's like that everywhere we go it doesn't matter what church I go to I ask the same question I get the same answer all the time the answer is dear in the headlights once again how many perfect people do we have here I'm trying to get going in my message but I but I can't get over this this this question is a good one it's the same response everywhere we go and the majority can't respond right away because as soon as you ask the question you see the face change and you see the wheels start turning no this week this happened and I T this and I said this and I did this and we can't figure out how we can be perfect all right now you see this because it it's important that if you don't understand the parable you'll never be able to say I am perfect impossible why because you can't bring the spiritual and the natural together come on now this is this is the problem because when all we see is our natural physical condition we cannot under that understand how we can be perfect this is is very important since the world likes to say no one is perfect how many of you have ever used that phrase I've said this to you so I'm going to say it again though well Nobody's Perfect the only one that says that are the ones that got caught right you don't ever hear that from people that didn't get caught when they when they get caught with their hand in the cookie jar well is perfect right now now now this this has to change because we Christians we go along with that saying and we have learned and accustomed ourselves to live a life of imperfection are are you with me we have accustomed ourselves that we're human beings that we just we'll just live a life of imperfection we are living in a prison of imperfection when you look around the people are in prisons of imperfection because everybody or nobody is perfect church let me tell you this morning that we have a perfect sacrifice we serve a perfect perect God and we come from a perfect logos then how in the world are we not perfect if we're trying to perfect this guy we're never going to do it but there is a man on the inside there is a man on the inside who through the word is perfect now how how many believe that as you ask these questions really it really starts to it gets people thinking we are perfect you know why because we have received the perfect interpretation of the word our founding Pastor said this we are perfect when the perfect interpretation of the word has been interpreted to our conscience My Oh my he that hath an ear let him hear now now this is is where we start what was the purpose of of using a parable to begin with it helps us it helps us in so many different ways a parable helps us realize that though we live under the tension the nervousness the pressures of this age and we are born with the breakable and fallible nature we still have the capacity to hold the divine within ourselves did you get that church we live in a world of tension we live in a world of nervousness but through even a falling condition God has made a way he made a way for every one of us that's here today to do what to to realize that we are to hold the Divine inside of us I don't know if that excites you but it excites me this morning that Divine would come and dwell in the hearts of mortal men and women like only through a new birth can we accomplish these things natural does type the spiritual natural is the Earthly story I want you to tell your neighbor neighbor the natural the natural is the Earthly story but there's more to it than that all right because the spiritual is the Heavenly meaning once again parable is an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning now how many natural people do we have here well we're all we all should be we all we're all natural right we're all physical fles and blood how many of you have an Earthly story I have an Earthly story but how many of you have realized the Heavenly meaning of your story uhoh that's another thing now once again the natural types the spiritual our lives every event has already happened in the spiritual yes or yes I'm say again every event everything in our lives has already happened in the spiritual but we need something to understand the meaning of it we all come from different walks of life amen we've all been through hardships in our life one or the other there is not anyone that that is Bor born that has not seen trouble the Bible tells you that man that is born of a woman few days and full of trouble all right troubles everywhere we turn but if we never understand the spiritual meaning then they have not come together we don't know the parable here Jesus is saying learn a parable tell your neighbor neighbor learn a parable that's tremendous because we're going to need this in the message learn a parable because the parable puts them together Church there is so much that is going on right now I pray that our eyes and our ears are open to it when we see these things happen happening everywhere we turn you see the good the bad the ugly all kinds of things going on but we also understand that there is something that are five senses cannot pick up it can only be picked up by our six sense which is Faith and Faith being the six sense it will declare what the other five senses cannot declare Hebrews 111 and3 simply tells us now Faith is the substance of things hoped for it is the evidence of things not seen through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear in other words things that we see were made of things that we we cannot see these things came from somewhere out of nothing he made something I remember that story and we all know it very well of the scientist that challenge God says we can make and create what you do everybody remember the story right and so he said well go ahead so the scientist goes and he grabs a handful of dirt the Lord says put that down get your own dirt yeah yeah that's right because it came by the power of the spoken word existence from what seemed to be nothing yet there was something there was Elohim there he was by himself but from himself he created or brought these things that's what creation is all about listen closely it brings the Unseen of the spiritual world into the natural or Physical Realm okay did you get that I'm GNA say it again because you got to get all these pieces of the puzzle creation is all about this is why Satan cannot create how many know that Satan cannot create only can pervert or take what God has already created creation brings the Unseen spiritual world and it brings it into the natural or visible World Parables use the visible world to illustrate what's going on in the spiritual realm now we know how important a parable is I'm get it learn Parable all right when we know the Earthly story problem is that we miss details I don't know why this is happening you're missing details I don't know why I got to go through this missing details of the parable the parable comes to show the details this is important church because if not the enemy puts his finger in your mouth and does with you whatever he wants yes or yes amen the enemy comes and the next thing you know it I don't know I don't know why I'm in this this condition learn a parable telling us learn a parable tell your neighbor again learn a parable neighbor important to see this now we missed details and things happen to us and our family and why do we do we shut down all of a sudden we don't feel like going to church but I'm going through I don't know I don't know why why we did we did why why is it always the the negative part of it always why why why but but how many times do we seek the the spiritual meaning of what's going on this is what I'm after this morning there's a spiritual meaning of why you're going through what you're going through why are we not seeking those things because the devil he got there first he got to your mind first and said poor look at you let me stop for a moment here when I when we were in Poland I we we had a prayer line it probably to this day is probably the the most powerful prayer line I've ever been those people when they pray they are so sinc and when they pray that they don't just no no no they they they pray out loud everybody women children when you say let's pray and they all began to raise their voices and they began to pray you talk about about getting the spiritual world and and bringing it to the Natural World they bring him on the scene they're not afraid to cry out to the Lord as as the the line was going through people going through the line I noticed a young man this young man was probably in I don't know early early 20s or so and I noticed that he went around and he and he came back through the line again after the service his mother asked if he if she and and her son which was that young man could could speak to me very all handsome young man seem seemingly normal but he had a story to tell and I stood there listening to his story he says that that he had a lot of things going for him very athletic young man but five years before he was in a horrendous car accident he was thrown from the rear glass of the of his vehicle it broke his spine when you think you have it back somebody else is going do something they didn't expect him to live said you'll never walk again you're lucky to be alive now now here's this young man and he's coming and and to that I believe it was his fiveyear anniversary of the accident he comes and and and he begins to to to put out what's in his heart he said I fought hard and with the help of God I overcame all the odds and I had to learn how to walk again I had to learn how to talk and I had to learn how to do all these things again he said but brother I still struggle today I said what's your struggle he said that Spirit of depression hits me every day and I can be doing good and the spirit of depression comes upon me and tells me you've lost five years you'll never get him back he said and I go down into the dumps what do you tell a young man who in the prime of his life has gone through that what do you tell him I'll pray for you but he wanted an answer the Lord had been dealing with me in this parable and I want you all to to listen closely because this is this is where we all find ourselves in the parable Earthly story Heavenly meaning I looked at the young man and I could feel the presence of the Lord come learn a parable learn a parable I said I said brother I said the Lord wants you to learn the parable I can't tell you the mystery because the mystery is for you to find out God for that but you can find the Myster hid inside the parable that's the day that you're free from that day you will not be depressed no more I said find the purpose in the parable I'll tell you this you have a lot to live for now brother I said but I'll give you some help here I believe that what you went through there's a purpose behind it and the purpose is so that you can tell your generation that Jesus Christ is alive that Jesus Christ is still healing you should have been dead I said brother you should have been dead forget five years you should had no more years left but he's not done with you and if he's not done with you then there's a reason why you're still alive brother you want to get rid of that depression I said you go around I don't care if you're in school I don't care if you're at work I don't care if you're at church you start to tell everyone of what Jesus did for you the next morning Sunday morning he was up behind the pulpit and he was giving his testimony I have a purpose he said me tell you what Jesus Christ did for me going on the natural and the heaven were coming together starting to learn a parable this is what we need to do this morning we've got we've got a lot of learning to do this morning learn a parable when you learn the parable you ain't going to get depressed you'll know why you're going through what you how many believe that Jesus Christ is alive you how many believe that he's still a Healer more than ever before how many believe he's a savior how many believe he's a restorer how many believe he's the same in every detail except the literal Corporal body how many believe he's alive this morning I'm going to tell you how much alive he is brother this is to torment the devil we're we're tired of him tormenting us we're it's time we torment him torment him now try to torment you the parable says now you torment him brother Diego here he's got some wonderful news no I I'll interpret it yeah thank you though appreciate that this is this is what the parable showed go ahead now Tuesday I I had a an appointment with the urologist after having three separate appointments with the same urologist and this place that they took me to was different he had different instruments that he had placed they were either going to either have surgery or do a biopsy it was felt really strange there when the specialist comes he's looking at this exam of the tests eyes could see his eyes he he kept going through him over and over again something just didn't seem right but for me it was [Applause] right and his only words were Mr Diego brother or sir Diego I don't believe you're going to die canc I couldn't even find one milligram of [Applause] Cancer all the [Applause] honor and the glory goes to Jesus chist and I'm here to tell you and to to to to go against or to challenge the the all of hell that if they think to send more demons to confront the Bride of the Lord Jesus it's it's better that they know that it'll be the last thing that they do because Jesus Christ yday today forever and she she has thus sayth the Lord can we give one to the Lord Jesus oh come on we got to do better than that somebody's got to shout hallelujah somebody's got to praise him this morning because his goodness his mercy endureth forever that Victory is not just for brother Diego we are a body and when one member has the victory all of us get the victory we all join into the victory that is where we're at he's he's alive he's doing great things oh yes he is oh see truly the natural here we go come on Church truly the natural is the witness of the spiritual there's your Parable I'm going to say again truly the natural is the witness of the spiritual world that's right the spiritual world needs a witness who is the witness of the spiritual world hallu I am a witness of the spiritual World our should be a witness of the spiritual world let's go on when we see what the Lord is doing whatever you've gone through your life is a witness amen that something already happened in the SP spiritual world the natural world just caught up to it in the spiritual they already knew he was healed oh come on church I'm G to say it again in the spiritual World they already knew that the doctor would say there is no cancer there hello everybody but that's why our our brother Bram says our bodies has got to catch up with our confession there's nothing to fear nothing tell your neighbor nothing to fear neighbor don't live in fear no no no we have something greater am church we have been given the privilege to be a part of the greatest story let me rephrase this church we have been given the greatest privilege that all the prophets of all long to live in our time we've been given the greatest privilege The Greatest Story to be a part of the greatest Parable I'm going to say it again to be a part of the greatest Parable that is taking place in our day right now that's the truth okay who's part of it is I raise my hands well then learn a parable learn this Parable you can learn all The Parables and know all the stories and we can know all the stories of of our founding Pastor through the church ages learn all the stories we can know what all the stories are about but have you brought the spiritual and the natural world together in in your life have you learned the parable because you've heard the story doesn't mean you've learned the parable you learned the story but when the spiritual the supernatural elements brings the spiritual and the natural together you have just learned a parable oh church I'm going to again you've learned a parable this revival that started in our day has spread we were in Poland and brother Julius text me he said buddy I need to give you an update are you ready for the update no you're not ready are you ready for an update young people are you ready for an update come on you ready for an update you ready for an update yeah give me an amen all right all right I'll take that one he said brother the the Revival has spread now to Kenya it has gone to South Sudan sud Rwanda Rwanda DRC Congo con and the total number of new Believers that have come through the Revival is now 197,000 531 oh that's all you're getting I didn't do that we didn't do that the Revival was not started by man the Revival was started by God so many doors opened and I say Lord help us ministers you want to work it's time to work things not going good get them good find the spiritual meaning the parable you don't feel called or you don't want to be called you you have to answer the question Parable we had Brothers there in in Poland from all around Poland from England Czech Republic Romania Roman Spain Belgium they all were there attending the service it was a missionary Camp all inviting us to their churches what was it that surprised them the most they had never seen a team they had always seen Lone Rangers one man coming leav another man coming but when they see a team come and it wasn't just from Los crues part of our team from Norway when we get there they had never seen anything this is the problem even in the churches today get fighting so much amongst ourselves and this preacher beli this and and we we fight so much amongst ourselves that that we don't even know how the body is supposed to work oh come on you know what I'm talking about we don't even know how the body is supposed to function because we're too busy fighting Thunder's revealed or not return or no return tent or no tent the song says tent or a cottage why should I care he's building a mansion for me Hallelujah but just because someone sees it a different way they're still my brothers different I still got to love them we get so caught up in so many things but when they saw a body working together come on you know what I'm talking about when they see a body working a team working together they said wow on Wow one brother after another can this happen in our country that's the questions well others are thinking what can I buy now I'm shopping and I'm going to do this there are thousands upon thousands upon millions of people dying what are we doing come on now learn a parable learn a parable what he is doing today Dr Locker States this in a parable and images borrowed from the visible world and is accompanied by a truth there is a truth that accompanies every believer that comes to Earth it's accomp they are accompanied by a truth from the invisible or spiritual world come by yourself it's not this is not some accident that happened are you with me this is not some accident truth accompanies you what is that truth your Parable is accompanied by a truth from the invisible do you know why Jesus chose to use Parables because he knew that the imagination is quicker than [Music] logic oh I'm going to say that again Jesus used Parable because it activates the imagination instantly and that was his way of getting to you before the enemy does because if the enemy can use make you use logic then he's got you well I know that but what about this and this and this where we miss it we use logic more than we do Faith before logic starts logic is okay but it gets in Faith's way because you try to figure everything out why this don't worry about why learn a parable we are too carnal sometimes learn a parable BR the spiritual in the natural still with me let's let's go for just a little while just a little bit more okay now now Parables they help with the memory you ever noticed that in your life the brother could preach up a storm then run down the aisles and you'll say man that was a good sermon that was a great service by Monday afternoon you don't even remember his the scripture he used you don't even remember what he would preached about but if he tells you a story or a parable that sticks to you what a beautiful story that brother I love that story this is why parables are so important they help with the memory and they stir up or excite the affections and they awaken your conscience learn a parable let it wake you up Parables then used by Jesus as the vehicle for the highest truths of all it was divine truth clothed in human gar right amen that's why Parables listen closely Parables come with a power parable of the S parable of the prodical son parable of the 10 virgins Parable Parable Parable parable but when you find out the mystery in the parable and it brings the spiritual and the natural together there is a power in that Parable say again there is a power in that Parable enough to set you free to bring you to who you really are Parables have the power listen to this they have the power to bring the natural and the spiritual world into harmony why do you think the prophet of God why do you think that he could live in Two Worlds at the same time how is that possible he learned the parable learn a parable because that's what brings Harmony in your life as I'm preaching now I I'm acting out I'm acting out right now in the natural what has already gone on in the spiritual right yes or yes see see how is it possible that I can be in Poland and the Lord using Brother Diego to say what you what is going to happen tomorrow has already [Music] happened to the untrained person how did it already happen it already happened in the spiritual then we see it happen or unfold in the natural W what a tremendous service but heaven was already rejoicing because there's more joy in heaven for one sinner that repents 9 who need no repentance somebody found the parable somebody learned the parable I hope you get this this morning I pray not hope I pray you get this what's going on we are actors the parable unfolds itself through the actors am it needs the human Garb natural man witness be an actor spiritual have its way through the natural you with me you believe that come on now see how much you get of this I hear you complaining I'm GNA tell you learn a parable and if you hear me complain about something you tell me we got to learn the parable it's got to come into harmony watch the parable now and as the Lord leads us in in in the next messages but in the first SE brother Bram says this act tonight Satan changing his mask all the actors acting the part that he did when he become from a spirit to a man he only put on an actor's garment or human flesh now you see it's only an actor's form that's the reason they are all in Parables the whole book of Revelations is symbols and those symbols are Parables is that what he said oh that's why we see in Parables the way they are here beasts and animals and so forth it's in an act and these actors began in the first church age because it was Christ revealing himself to the seven Church ages through these Church ages there's a great mess up comes along then at the end of the church ages the seventh Angel's message is to pick up these lost Mysteries where are they lost where is he going to pick up these mysteries from learn a parable the parable hides the mystery and the only thing that could pull the mystery out of us was the message of the seventh angel nothing else nothing else the seventh Angel's message is to pick up these lost Mysteries and to give it to the church now will notice that here he picks it up he puts it all together then he brings the parable watch now the we're coming into a parable in our time Jesus said all these Parables without a parable he spake not so if he did not speak without parables in that time how would he speak without a parable in this time when he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still speaking Parables today people are still saying we don't understand what did he mean there's no Harmony there watch what he says here here's the parable you know what the parable is you ready this is for our time you know what the parable is once again something happened yesterday oh come on right three people are happy everyone else is I have no idea what you're saying get into the word and you'll know what I'm saying the seven seal is what I'm talking about has three parts listen closely here now this is so important for us to understand the seventh angel then brings the parable something happened yesterday another one today the other came in an unknown tongue or unknown language what was yesterday the prophet was here six seals unfolded The Plan of Redemption unfolded part of the parable right amen but there's more to it something happened today the message is here to today is the scene today is the part of the actors acting out the part where is he getting his part in the parable that's right cuz it's not in holy script well I look I I read and I don't find it you got to do more than just read got to make contact with the spiritual yes or yes it's not in holy script you're not going to read in the Bible a team from Cedar Hills Church of the Cross went to Poland that it's Unwritten you won't find it in the Bible yet you will it doesn't say your name either that oh brother Reuben will be saved me is it in here does it say Reuben's gonna be saved but it doesn't say it the way we look for it a parable and the parable is whosoever will that means Caleb I don't know about you but the put my name there that means Caleb whosoever will let him come God so loved Caleb I find that I find that in the parable Hallelujah pray you're getting it this morning Hallelujah watch now it doesn't say we went to Africa either but it does say go ye into all the world and preach the gospel now there's where I find myself the parable BR harmony with the natural and the spiritual when they come together there is a blast there's an explosion that happens it's the unwritten word you'll know it was always there go into all the world and preach the gospel what a parable somebody's got to do that the seventh Angel's message pick up these lost Mysteries remember the mystery is hid in the parable once again he said learn a parable when I looked at this this is what kind of got my wheels turning was I'm reading Matthew 24 and Jesus preaches six seals right those of you that know the message you know Jesus preached six Hills did Jesus preach the seventh no preach the seven it was not to come till the end yet he preached it at the end it was the lamb that opened the seal but he was in the Heart come on here's the parable say it again here's the parable where's the lamb you see all these things he says the animals those are Parables where's the lamb now where's the lamb today no Messiah is not walking amongst us no more he was just walking amongst us the other day everybody was saying amenah amongst us Weeks Later is Messiah amongst us come on wake up life is being given out he speaks of six Hills he omits the seventh and notice as he continues his sermon he goes not into the seventh he goes into Hallelujah I don't know I don't know about you but when when I began to see this I'm just like oh oh whoa yeah yeah boy yeah excites me he goes from six Sals into learn a parable of [Music] Victory I'm going to say it again learn a parable of the fig tree oh that has to do with Israel You're missing it you're missing the parable you put it all to Israel you don't see how it affects the bride today again the parable is a natural or an Earthly message or or or or story with a Heavenly meaning says Israel natural typifies Church spiritual put it all together it's a mirror what is it learn a parable of the fig tree oh my here we are now this is where we're at today now we're learning the parable we have heard this so many times do how many times have you preached on learn a parable how many would you say probably hundreds of times learn a parable learn a parable the victory is this what happened to we're leaving out details and that's why there's no Harmony details here church that's why we can't go home the parable is learned we got to learn the parable morning learn the parable of the victory is yet tender showing us that summer is nigh and so likewise when you see all these things know that it is near even at the doors plural even at the doors verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word will not pass away it's not by chance or coincidence that God allowed us on this trip to go to owitz oh my anybody here ever have gone to aich before anybody that's you you you that know history a little bit this is where the they had one of the largest concentration camps for the Jews during the time of the second world war around there was around 3.3 million people living or Jews living in in Poland close to three million of them were killed to go into those gas chainers Brother Carlos you remember when we went to that in in in uh in Jerusalem we went to the to the uh the Holocaust Museum there are things that I I don't I would wouldn't care if I went back again and you see the pictures there and you see the different things but when you walk in to the actual camp and you feel the heaviness all that went that went on there and then you hear the voice say again learn a parable of the Victory and I'm saying Lord what did I miss he took us there for a reason into the gas Chambers Crums and then you go and you and you see piles and piles of shoes and and and their literal hair you go to where they where they would shoot them and and the heaviness that's there and you see scripture again the souls under the altar when the fif SE was opened the fifth was open there was Souls under the altar that were crying Lord how long before you avenge us of our blood Lord they killed us Lord when are you going to avenge us and and you go through all this and through it all we went for this purpose they are respects those that died but you see those things it causes you to ask the question did I catch all the all the pieces of the of this of this Parable natural Israel typifies the spiritual church have I caught all the details learn this Parable he say you can't even go into the seventh seal you have learned the parable of the Fig Tree the lies in there church I'm going to say it again the mystery lies in the parable go back and hear this message again he I there's so much here all those Jews were they were killed and though they had not accepted Jesus Christ the atonement yet because they were blinded for our sake but yet they will be given white robes brother bradam says mine were not under that altar mine were other under another altar he said mine already had white robes because they're the ones that listen and came forth from the message they have already put white robes but these Jews not until they come and they Avenged not will they be given white robes this is important to understand the parable he's dealing with Israel is he see I'm going to say it again is he dealing with Israel we can say yes and no right now in reality he's not dealing with him totally because he's he was dealing with the church agent but now he's not even dealing with the church AG I'm going to say it again oh the seventh Church age continued but he's not dealing with them he's dealing with a group of people learn the parable he he's dealing with a group of people bride who has caught the open door in heaven dealing with that group of people and through their lives the parable has unfolded the actors of that seven I want to read to you something from our founding Pastor just a couple more things and then I'll let you go how many are seeing the parable now getting it getting it okay learn the parable the elect he said are sitting in Heavenly places you might think they are in church the devil's sitting in church the religious person is sitting in church I'm not talking about that I'm talking about his bride's sitting in Heavenly places she's in a different ball game I like that but they are the ones that are holding the Four Winds learn a parable that is what the bride is is she is a missionary is she's commissioned to take the gospel that's why the prophet said the gospel should be preached show me where it's being preached come in Word only but the power and the demonstration I'll tell you one thing he said I'll show you an Africa where it's being preached I'll I'll show you in Norway where it's being preached I'll where it's being preached I'll show you around the world where it's being preached that's why the prophet said and then he goes on and says I'll show you where it is being preached it's being preached what he said on the scene of the seventh seal today today the elect are the only ones that have this he shall send forth his angels to gather his elect he'll send his Messengers to gather his elect there is El in Africa so he's got to send his messenger yes sir oh putting little funny books trying to make little stories or your own Parables that's me oh how you think of think it is it's going to stand winged angels from Heaven no he ain't he's going to send men like me with suits on together what are we doing it's Harvest Time it's time to gather the crop cuz it's almost time for us to head on to Palestine how long will thou hold the winds until the last one comes in go and bring the last one to me and that last one will probably be a black man learn a parable he goes into this he said I had a dream years some years back he said and in this dream I saw brother brandham said he said he was coming from Heaven he was in a White Horse and he came I was like in the country came down I didn't know it was brother brandom he started riding around like this great big Old Ranch House Coral I was sitting by the fence I was looking at him he pass Pass Me By once twice and the third time he took his hat off and he says how I said brother Bram Come On Son jump in with me I remember I jumped on that horse with him I know what it meant when I got to Africa he said probably the last will be a colored man I saw myself writing that horse no not brother brhom I am that message part of that message that he brought when we were in in in in in Poland right before the the pastor he he he he dismissed the service he read this quote out of God's only provided place of worship brother bam says I was getting pretty old I thought will there be another Revival what a question what a question will there be another Revival another time this is 1965 and just remember from the West will come a white horse rider and then he says will'll ride this traal again soon as we get ready it's a promise come on Church learn a parable that's the parable our Parable is the parable of the seventh seal Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness it's the natural that is showing the spiritual it shall be preached in all the world for a witness All Nations and then shall the End come there's your Gospel of the Kingdom Parable remember what a parable is the natural is a witness of the spirit behold I show you a there's par we shall not all sleep but we shall all change Parable so now he's showing you the mystery of the parable we shall all be changed how are we going to all be changed we're all Rascals we're all born in sin shaped in come to the world speaking lies we all be changed you want to know the parable if you get the parable then you got the mystery learn a parable here's the parable repent and be baptized you want to know how to change that's the mystery is repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for of your sins that's the parable and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the mystery that's the mystery in the parable bring the parable and bring the mystery together there where you'll find the answer Peter had the Keys of the Kingdom and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on Earth Loos in heaven there's the parable show me the mystery someone that can take the gospel do what it says it will do now you have the mystery together natural spiritual a Harmony so now I ask the question is there anyone here as you bow your heads their heart to the Lord baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and you say brother I need I need that I want to know the parable where you start would you raise your hand it's an opportunity you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and say brother the Lord's working in me would you raise your hand there's one hand here praise God is there anyone else I
