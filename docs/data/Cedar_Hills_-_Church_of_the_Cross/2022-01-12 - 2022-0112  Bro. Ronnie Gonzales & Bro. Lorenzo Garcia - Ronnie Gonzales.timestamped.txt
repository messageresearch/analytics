[34:30] to
[34:32] a very well known scripture
[34:35] [Music]
[34:37] ephesians chapter four
[34:42] and we're going to start with verse
[34:43] three
[34:49] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[34:51] spirit
[34:52] in the bond of peace
[34:54] [Music]
[34:59] there is one body
[35:01] and one spirit
[35:02] even as you are called in one hope of
[35:04] your calling
[35:12] one lord
[35:13] one faith
[35:15] one baptism
[35:20] one god and father of all
[35:22] who is above all
[35:25] through all
[35:26] and in you all
[35:31] [Music]
[35:42] with above all
[35:45] through you all poor
[35:47] and annual
[35:51] but unto every one of us is given the
[35:53] grace according
[35:55] given is of us is given grace
[35:58] according to the measure of the gift of
[36:00] christ
[36:07] wherefore
[36:10] when he ascended up on high
[36:12] he led captivity captive and gave gifts
[36:15] unto men
[36:21] now that he ascended
[36:23] what is it but that he also descended
[36:26] first into the lower parts of the earth
[36:36] he that descended is the same also that
[36:39] ascended far above all the heavens
[36:46] that he might fill all things
[36:51] and one of our
[36:53] known scripture here or verse
[37:03] are you part of the sam
[37:18] for the perfecting of the saints
[37:27] [Music]
[37:41] unto the measure of the stature of the
[37:43] fullness of christ
[37:47] you may be seated
[37:51] [Music]
[38:02] we
[38:33] because
[38:34] the lord preached to me all weekend
[38:38] you know a lot of times we don't know
[38:39] when the lord's going to speak to us
[38:44] or by whom he's going to speak
[38:46] we uh a lot of times we are speaking for
[38:49] myself
[38:51] we don't catch when the lord's going to
[38:52] speak to us
[38:57] on that friday afternoon
[39:05] [Music]
[39:12] it was kind of
[39:13] it was it was real
[39:15] real basic
[39:17] you know i was i was working
[39:20] i think i was like one of the last ones
[39:21] there to the concert
[39:24] i had to walk in front of about
[39:26] about a thousand people
[39:30] so i was kind of a little embarrassed
[39:34] but it's all right
[39:36] so so
[39:37] so the teacher the band teacher he gets
[39:40] up el maestro
[39:54] and so he he began to um
[39:57] you know just talk to us the different
[39:58] things that they have done
[40:02] there were some kids out there was their
[40:03] first year playing instruments
[40:08] some had been
[40:17] [Music]
[40:20] you know and uh so so he began to i
[40:23] don't know much about music okay
[40:26] i've always wanted to learn how to play
[40:27] it
[40:31] but
[40:34] probably not
[40:36] but um those who play music
[40:40] instruments
[40:41] maybe they'll know a little bit of what
[40:42] i'm talking about here
[40:45] so my boy nathan hip again he plays the
[40:47] trumpet
[40:49] he says
[40:50] he want to play the trumpet because
[40:52] tommy played the trumpet
[41:01] but um so at first and what i'm going to
[41:03] say is there's nothing nothing new
[41:07] we've heard this before
[41:09] so first the the the teacher gets out
[41:12] there
[41:14] he says first of all they have to learn
[41:15] to play the trumpet they have to learn
[41:16] how to
[41:19] put their mouths in a certain you know a
[41:20] certain way
[41:21] [Music]
[41:29] first of all you have to put your hand
[41:30] like this
[41:48] to using the mouthpiece
[41:52] now
[41:52] this evening
[41:54] now where i believe we're i'm amongst
[41:56] eagles
[41:59] take the take the types take the symbols
[42:01] okay
[42:04] so so my so my little boy again you know
[42:06] before he can learn to play the trumpet
[42:07] he had to use the mouthpiece
[42:12] and then he used the trumpet
[42:24] all right i want you guys to play the
[42:26] way the way you guys
[42:27] first played
[42:37] the trumpets were blowing the violins
[42:39] were going
[42:41] on the percussions were going
[42:46] it's it's you know it was just a bunch
[42:48] of racket
[42:50] then he says okay now let's show them
[42:52] what you've learned
[42:55] so they
[42:56] started playing jingle bells
[43:00] jingle bells it was a big difference
[43:01] between the racket from they first
[43:03] started
[43:06] to playing jingle bells
[43:09] jingle bells so that was on a friday and
[43:11] i didn't think much of it
[43:15] until saturday
[43:17] you know again zoe plays the violin
[43:20] and they went with sister emma she also
[43:22] plays the violin
[43:23] [Music]
[43:30] so we were there and as we were walking
[43:32] in we could hear the music playing
[43:36] we walk into the place we were supposed
[43:38] to and trauma
[43:40] brother diego and sister margaret we're
[43:42] there
[43:43] margaret
[43:44] and we went to go sit with them
[43:47] that was just their you know the the um
[43:49] the professional orchestra for you know
[43:51] for the areas
[44:07] and something caught my attention
[44:10] and i was like oh man that's when the
[44:11] lord began to speak to me
[44:15] and then i was like oh i was like and
[44:16] then the lord
[44:19] like he
[44:20] shows and speaks to himself in
[44:22] mysterious ways
[44:26] now now in this symphony
[44:29] india in this orchestra
[44:31] so so in my boy's class
[44:48] i don't know if you've ever been to an
[44:49] orchestra
[44:52] you know they're they're always dressed
[44:53] the same the standstills
[44:55] always dressed in black
[44:57] you know and uh
[44:59] and uh so i i wondered why
[45:01] and zoe says
[45:04] he says well it's because they don't
[45:06] want you to focus on them they want you
[45:08] to focus on the music
[45:12] man so i began to i began to think i was
[45:14] like
[45:16] there
[45:30] now it doesn't matter where you are and
[45:32] you walk with the lord
[45:34] maybe you just started started your walk
[45:36] with the lord
[45:38] maybe we've been coming to church for 50
[45:40] years
[45:43] you know we must all be dressed the same
[45:45] thing
[45:47] we must all be dressed with the word
[45:50] again it doesn't matter if you you're
[45:52] just starting off
[45:56] or maybe you could take a slide by
[45:57] because you've been coming to church for
[45:58] 50 years
[46:12] or in in south america and
[46:16] america we must all be dressed the stage
[46:20] the word doesn't change from from region
[46:22] to region
[46:25] from
[46:26] different countries about different
[46:28] spices it's all the same
[46:35] another thing that i noticed
[46:38] and
[46:40] the people in the orchestra
[46:43] they're all in their place
[46:46] when they're all in their place
[46:49] it's like a fan
[46:52] like an arc like a like
[46:54] like uh like a rainbow right
[46:57] and uh
[46:59] i began to see that but
[47:01] i was like man that's all
[47:03] aren't we like a covenant people
[47:08] are we a covenant people almost enter
[47:10] are you a covenant people are seeding
[47:13] and it was all it's like like a rainbow
[47:15] or a fan
[47:16] in informatica
[47:20] and then the thing this thing kind of
[47:22] this thing hit me i know i'm going a
[47:24] little bit slow
[47:27] but
[47:28] just because
[47:30] the musicians
[47:31] had their their their instruments
[47:34] [Music]
[47:36] they were in their post of duty
[47:40] doesn't mean that they were plain
[47:45] that's right yes sir hey man we think
[47:47] we're in our post of duty many times
[48:10] even had this in my notes but they had
[48:12] they had the wooden beams lined with
[48:13] gold
[48:16] um
[48:37] [Music]
[48:55] and you get the person that plays the
[48:56] drums to try to play the guitar
[49:08] now you try to get that same person that
[49:09] plays the guitar
[49:13] or the violin
[49:14] and you try to put them with their same
[49:15] sheet music to play the drums
[49:20] it's going to be a mess
[49:22] it's going to be a racket
[49:24] and many that and that's how we we must
[49:27] be sometimes
[49:46] we're gonna make a mess
[50:00] another thing that i noticed
[50:03] and this is the biggest thing that
[50:04] caught my attention right here
[50:07] i turned around i looked at brother
[50:09] diego diego
[50:14] this this buddy doesn't know that he's
[50:15] preaching to me
[50:19] in the amateur level
[50:22] in the professional level
[50:37] he was there and before they were going
[50:39] to play antos
[50:41] he would do this
[50:47] i kind of think follow me why is this
[50:49] kid snapping at my kid
[51:17] and then i was like
[51:19] okay that's kind of kind of a little
[51:20] weird again i don't know nothing about
[51:23] the music
[51:25] but then on the professional level
[51:28] you know before this conductor
[51:32] let me read a little bit here what the
[51:33] conductor doesn't
[51:48] the
[51:48] conductor not only directs
[51:52] they are teachers
[51:54] ensuring that everyone
[51:56] is taught how to play their own part
[52:03] okay now now the guy that plays the
[52:05] drums and the guitar
[52:08] he's got a specific sheet of music for
[52:10] himself
[52:13] specifically
[52:14] now the conductor now
[52:20] he can tell you
[52:22] he can you know by looking at this sheet
[52:24] of paper
[52:26] or this book
[52:27] he can control the bass
[52:30] the guitar
[52:44] [Music]
[52:56] how many are happy for a guide
[53:13] of music
[53:16] to which they make a certain adjustments
[53:19] such as in tempo
[53:22] articulation phrasing
[53:25] repetitions
[53:41] relay their vision to the performers
[53:47] take it and type
[53:50] the conductor keeps an orchestra
[53:54] or
[54:09] to all of the messages of our founding
[54:10] pastor
[54:16] that brother caleb doesn't teach any
[54:18] different
[54:21] different
[54:22] amen so what would the conductor say
[54:26] stay together
[54:28] that's that's what the message of the
[54:29] con that's the message that the
[54:31] conductor is relaying to the to the to
[54:33] the orchestra
[54:34] [Music]
[54:35] is
[54:51] brother ronnie the holy ghost does that
[54:52] [Music]
[54:55] that's right amen
[54:57] amen but where is the holy ghost
[55:01] and you'll see here in a minute i'm like
[55:02] just keep on reading i know it's a
[55:03] little slow today
[55:15] a conductor serves as a messenger for
[55:18] the composer
[55:28] right
[55:34] it is their responsibility to understand
[55:37] the music
[55:41] the sport the book
[55:43] all the notes
[55:45] and convey through it
[55:49] and convey through gestures
[55:53] so transparently
[55:57] that the musicians in the orchestra
[55:58] understand perfectly
[56:16] about your leader
[56:18] you know but here but
[56:21] he's he's he's uh
[56:23] he's
[56:24] relaying this message
[56:25] through gestures and everything
[56:26] perfectly to the people
[56:37] i was like okay but then the
[56:39] professional now
[56:42] so it's getting good for me
[56:47] messages are all this is good stuff
[56:50] amen
[56:51] i wish your password get up here and
[56:53] continue on yes amen i'd like to give
[56:56] them my spot right
[56:57] i tell brother kaleb all the time don't
[56:59] call me to preach
[57:01] put yourself or put somebody else that
[57:03] likes to
[57:07] [Laughter]
[57:10] now now now this this uh this conductor
[57:15] again he is the messenger for the
[57:16] composer
[57:19] and i thought to myself and they say we
[57:20] don't need a fightful ministry
[57:23] you know my my daughter zoe me me
[57:25] kazooie she'll be there in the house
[57:28] and she'll be playing the violin
[57:30] she'll be in the room
[57:32] in the garage
[57:34] [Music]
[57:35] she's got to report how she sounds for
[57:37] the teacher come on
[57:46] and even though it sounds beautiful
[57:51] it doesn't have the same as if it's when
[57:53] the rest of the orchestra
[57:57] and orchestra
[57:58] but she's practicing at home
[58:01] she gets we're supposed to get our sheet
[58:03] music
[58:06] we get
[58:17] the conductor is one of the most
[58:18] recognizable figures in the musical
[58:20] world
[58:24] [Music]
[58:27] waving their mysterious ones
[58:48] but it's more accurate to think as
[58:49] conductors as silent musicians
[58:56] whose instrument is made of people
[59:01] so how do they make music
[59:06] while the musicians are sitting in their
[59:08] post of duty
[59:11] okay so this is how it happened
[59:13] so the the orchestra was ready to go
[59:26] [Music]
[59:30] he
[59:44] you talked
[59:58] is
[1:00:11] what does he raise he raises the wand
[1:00:14] what did brother caleb
[1:00:17] he was talking about this the menorah
[1:00:18] right
[1:00:20] it was the changing of the beat
[1:00:23] this beginning of this year peter and
[1:00:25] the wolf
[1:00:33] he raises the raises first of all
[1:00:36] because it has to be to our leader
[1:00:39] to the guy
[1:00:41] to the messenger
[1:00:43] first of all has to come to the head of
[1:00:44] the house
[1:00:46] is that right man that's correct
[1:00:48] heads of the house
[1:00:51] was it the word had to come to you first
[1:00:54] doesn't
[1:01:08] it's an awakening for the musicians
[1:01:17] they're there
[1:01:18] take your breath
[1:01:20] if you got an instrument then you need
[1:01:21] to blow
[1:01:54] so what does he do guessing through the
[1:01:56] sweeping and the waving of his hands
[1:02:00] his body gestures
[1:02:02] over here he's controlling the flu with
[1:02:03] his hands
[1:02:17] everything you move is controlling over
[1:02:18] here
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:42] the brothers
[1:03:56] the conductor is simply doing what the
[1:03:58] composer said
[1:04:05] the conductor is a messenger
[1:04:08] he gets a message from the composer
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:53] it's not the same when you listen to it
[1:04:54] on the youtube or whatever
[1:04:57] youtube when you hear it live
[1:04:59] yeah it's it's moving
[1:05:04] what do people say
[1:05:20] they made the music come to life
[1:05:32] resurrecting or awakening
[1:05:46] but the musicians make it alive
[1:06:14] well they press play because they don't
[1:06:16] want the responsibility for themselves
[1:06:17] right
[1:06:22] but wait a minute are we waiting for
[1:06:24] just brother caleb to uh to make it
[1:06:26] alive
[1:06:30] that wouldn't that be the same thing in
[1:06:32] a smaller scale
[1:06:38] as long as as long as brother caleb
[1:06:39] makes it alive
[1:06:43] no no no no no
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:07:11] now to you adults
[1:07:21] only the composer knows what it really
[1:07:27] and means it to those who are listening
[1:07:31] are you interested in knowing what the
[1:07:32] drama is
[1:07:36] but you'd have to know about the
[1:07:37] symphony first
[1:07:55] of the music
[1:07:57] it throws it
[1:07:59] something is going
[1:08:02] it's
[1:08:03] some sometimes it's going
