continue our story now after the prophet samuel died david and his men were camped out in the wilderness of perron after long days in the field david and his men realized that they were running low on food and supplies so when david heard that nabel was going to be sharing his sheep david sent 10 young men to carmel to speak with him and abel listen to my words i want you to greet mabel in my name yes sir offer him a peace offering from me to all his family tell him that it has been a blessing for us to dwell here with his men tell him that we will continue to protect them as long as the lord god has us here ask nabel if he will spare some food to my faithful men yes sir right away sir david's men traveled to carmel then and there they found nabel in his fine pressed purple robe drinking wine and while acting like naval able sir i bring greetings from my lord david the anointed servant of the almighty god may peace and prosperity be with you and your family my lord david has heard that you're having this chief chilling contest he wants to know he wants you to know that he's been taking care of all your shepherds while they're out with their flocks he's made sure their possessions are safe david has asked if you could send us back with some food it's been a couple days now we only had one birth to eat we're starving my son david yes sir like the david hey david who is david and who is the son of jesse better yet who are you bunch of fools with your crusty sandals on my nice clean floors how do i know you're not so cool again pretending to be with david i'm not giving you fools or crumb so you can tell david to eat dirt for all i care blasphemy and with the sad heart the men delivered the news to david my lord we're so sorry neville was so wicked and mean he said that we had crusty sandals he claimed that he did not even know you and that he could care less if we starve to death out here he said what yes lord gird on your swords every one of you this man will find out who david the son of jesse is he's a dead man yeah thank you sir david girded his sword and left the camp with 400 men following him meanwhile back in carmel avio had no idea of the great danger her husband had gotten them all into abigail abigail please you must talk to your husband what is going on oh abigail david the anointed sent messengers from the village to greet our master what do you refuse to hear them he doesn't understand david and his man have been a great wall of protection for our people he's so foolish he doesn't want to help him when abigail heard the words of the young man she quickly gathered 200 loaves of bread two bottles of wine five dressed sheep four quarts of roasted grain 100 clusters of grain and 200 fig cakes she loaded all the supplies into her donkey and quickly snuck out of the city without telling her husband nabel as she rode deeper into the wilderness she could see david and his men and they were coming straight towards her but abigail stood bravely as they approached her where is this man nabel after all we have done for this fallow and this is how he repays me all i wanted was for my men to have a bite to eat and drink how dare he rebuke the man that i sent in my name because he did not help me he didn't help my man and now there won't be a man or boy or even a servant of his that will not pay for his foolishness please let me explain my lord pay no attention to nabel he is exactly what his name means just a fool please accept this food and share it with all your men may the lord keep you from taking revenge and taking the lives of innocent people david i pray that the lord will deliver you from all your enemies and may all the people who tried to kill you be as naval i swear by the living lord please forgive me if i say a little more the lord will always protect you and your family because you fight for him david and i pray you never do anything evil as long as you live the lord your god will always keep you safe when your enemies are upon you he will take away their lives quicker than you can throw a stone from your sling the lord has promised good to you even to make you ruler of israel when the lord does all these things for you please remember me i praise the lord god of israel it was him who sent you to me today your bravery has kept me from killing innocent people if you hadn't come so quickly all these families would have been killed by morning don't worry you may return home in peace i will do all you have asked when abigail returned home she found nabel very drunk so she waited until morning to tell him all that had happened with david nabal do you realize the danger that you put our entire family with the way you treated david and his men david is a man of god and deserves respect do you know that he was on his way to kill our entire house but god was merciful to us i want you to know that i gave david and his men all that they asked for god has given you another chance to be a better person mabel please don't throw it away this time woman first of all what business do you have giving away my food and my wine to that rascal david especially my food cakes everyone knows not to mess with my pancakes and it came to pass about ten days later that the lord smote navel and he died my lord nabel i've just received knows that he's dead bless the lord he has kept me
