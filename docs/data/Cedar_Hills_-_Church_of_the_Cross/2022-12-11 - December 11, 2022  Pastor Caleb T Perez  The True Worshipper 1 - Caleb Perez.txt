through it and then next thing you know it the year is over we are grateful to God life and for each of you we appreciate everything that each one of you does and we're happy this this uh we're happy this uh morning I got a little surprise that's babysitted for a moment but that's uh yeah and then brother is uh is our brother is our brother and our friend from Barrientos and so we've been talking about this for a long time finally he made it so God bless you good to have you here amen amen we we uh we want to give a little testimony to you and that is uh when we were when we had gone a couple of weeks weeks back to about three weeks ago we were in Denver and uh we were actually planning to go to to Denver the week before we actually went and when we got there actually that the the we we uh the brother uh ended up telling to me he um he was actually uh he's trying to be be a this uh quiet about it finally he says well brother my my wife's in the hospital he was pregnant and she she was uh she was at the point of death and and still through it all he kept uh he kept him he could have canceled the services but we went ahead and went and the Lord had given brother Diego a vision crocodiles we know we know that means it means death for sure those crocodiles but we went in the name of the Lord they took the baby out by a C-section and they ended up she ended up pointing to a coma uh as we were there we we stood together and we made a prayer as a body and uh I'm here to tell you she came out of her coma out of the hospital and uh and her and the baby are doing just fine so we are grateful to God for that he told me later on he says I I saw those same two crocodiles but the arrow of God's Deliverance say it again the arrow of God's Deliverance that's what we are grateful to God foreign I'm going to try to be better well you know just let's let's try to tone it down a little bit and and uh let's try to stay within an hour you can be so kind and and stand to your feet as we uh read our scripture and this is the first message on the true worshiper it says [Music] some thoughts concerning this I had preached some years back on the worshiper to talk on a few uh maybe a few messages concerning this yeah and as the Lord was putting uh it was giving me the inspiration you know he says I will share my throne my glory you tell me Gloria I must tell you again he said tell the church that I will share my glory at this point we either all in right and so we we want to make sure we are where we need to be very well known scripture John chapter 4 and verse 23 San Juan capitulo such a an attack from the enemy is my goodness he he don't let up but we're not letting up either we know this scripture he's talking to the uh the woman at the well amen and it says this but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship is I like that very much right there where it says the father seeketha continually looking for such a worshiper my goodness I want to ask the question are you one of those worshipers the churches are full this morning of worshipers they're worshiping the best that they know how right amidst it all there is a true worshiper that's what we are after that's what we want to be yes okay oh may God add His blessings to the reading of this word you may be seated we see this in the scripture and I I I really enjoyed the the panel on Wednesday and brother Abraham you know he's of course like we say we always say we run out of time but there was something that he read and I probably won't get a lot into that during this message but there was something that he read towards the end that really it really got my attention from what I was studying and that was as he was reading Revelations 11. everyone remember that Revelation and Revelations 11 1 says and there was given me a read like unto a rod yeah and the angels stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein is so so it got my attention is as to the the part that I'm dealing with measuring the worshiper now now there's a lot that goes with this that as we were talking about it I believe on on Thursday there's so much that that this that's that this deals with and so we will maybe in the next message we'll we'll get to that you remember he said what do they need a measuring tape what do they do they bring your measuring tape and they measure it like this how do you measure a worshiper good question we can get into the other things but but we we want to focus on the worshiper this morning and there is much that goes with this because though when there is a wedding they're uh bridesmaids are measured for their dresses and groomsmen are measured and attendees are measured we have a a special treat this coming weekend and we have a couple that has been married for 60 years Centennial stats brother Ross and sister Ruth Mr Manor Russell and what an example is that right and so we're we're all invited right we're all invited if not I'm gonna have to put up for you I'll pay for the food this Saturday I think it's at three o'clock and so they're inviting all of you to come and and and and join in and so you know that they're they're they're they're being measured for for whatever dress they're gonna wear or suit and so forth and those so many go to church but only the bride who gets measured for the for the wedding which is nobody else gets measured for the wedding dress and so we we everyone's waiting for the moment when the bride walks out hoping maybe that they that they measured correctly the bride is is nervous she gets measured for her dress now now the the in the natural the dress you know they they measure it so that it it they custom make it to fit her but in the spiritual spiritual we must grow up into this dress we've got to grow up into it now now when we get to a certain place we understand and see see that that it's a tremendous Day that's coming and so we we want everything to be just right anyone that everyone that's got married before you want everything to be just perfect when the day finally arrives there's no time anymore to to to to get the dress ready it either fits or it doesn't and so it's it's it's uh we see this and it wow it it uh it makes it so real to us that's why the scripture says these measure the worshiper what a thing it is and sometimes we don't like to be measured I went the other day to get a suit the man says I think you're a 44. no I don't think so no no no I think I'm a 43. so John hello 43 was just a little tight and I was like oh uh just measure me at a 43. I'm gonna lose some weight anyways and the man says everybody that comes in says after what well I guess I just just measure me for what I am and I guess if I ever lose weight I can try to adjust it but I wonder this morning how many of us can measure up to the world not just measure up as a churchgoer some religious person got to make sure we measure up to the word she have made herself ready the Bible says and the way that she has made herself ready is by worshiping in spirit and in truth by himself sometimes the question how important is it really to Worship in spirit and Truth we've got to know how to dress ourselves with the word and it takes me to Genesis chapter chapter 2 and verse 15 if you can turn to that and I pray that this this God helps us I've kind of been under under something the last couple of days and this building we are at our post of Duty this morning and so we we want to just see just a little bit what God has for us and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it I want you to notice there was two things that he was asked to do and to keep it everybody got that can you repeat with me you dress it and to keep it you can put up those definitions up here and like I said just we'll we'll put today just a foundation to to this subject but the word dress there is in the Hebrew is it means to work to serve to worship yeah and the Lord God took the man put him into the Garden of Eden first of all to dress it yes he was there to serve to work but also to Worship in this garden now now notice this now his work and his worship is all connected together this is very important to understand this once again his work his service and his worship they're all connected together under one word in the Hebrew called then it was also to keep it and the word keep means to guard is to preserve a preservar to be a Watchman so as we see this picture beginning to form everything that man did in the garden was part of his worship and his responsibility was to keep responsibility to guard and protect that worship at all costs you get that with me it's important that we understand this once again it was his responsibility and protect his worship at all costs in the Garden of Eden there was a perfect economy there was a perfect harmony because there was a perfect worship there they were true worshipers and in the cool of the evening father would come down and they would finish their worship under the fire under the great logos you cannot have true worship unless you're under the true fires if you're not under the true fire then you only have a form of godliness and you cannot have perfect worship prophet of God says in the message sir we would see Jesus he said let's stay under the fires worship right here under the fire let's Worship in the power and the spirit believe in that God's word yes it is but after the fall the true worship was lost the ground was then cursed for man's sake and he would have to work and eat by the sweat of his brow with his face but God was still going to be worshiped the Bible says that by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice and without faith it is impossible to please God impossible to gratify him entirely impossible gratification and only through true worship is God completely and entirely gratified and here's the best part of it all yeah that anyone or anything that stands in the way of our worship is I I believe that the Lord wants us he wants us to go through this slowly that this is can you can you tell your neighbor he will share his glory it's important that we understand this is things that we've heard for years and years but now I tell you church we must know this with everything that is in us we must make sure that we're aware of this Exodus 8 1 says and the Lord spake unto Moses going to feral and say unto him thus saith the Lord let my people go and this is the same word that we just read in in the Book of Genesis it's the same word that's used here to serve let my people go that they may serve me the word serve there is a bottle so in the Hebrew and once again to serve to work to worship now once again it's all combined together and if thou refuse to let them go is behold I will Smite all thy borders with frogs here it is showing that Satan is powerless against the true worshiper God that has let my people go so they can worship me because he desires the worship and Praises of his children but it also implies that they had to be released as slaves first in order to be free to worship they were slaves in Egypt when he said let them go in other words they had to be released as slaves in order to be free to serve him you can't serve God and still be a slave no pues you can't do the both of them you can't be a slave to sin and then try to serve God and worship him no I will share my glory with no one no compartment watch how and why he's telling us this is we cannot fully serve and worship him yet we are slaves to so many things in this life you want to see who and what you are worshiping see how much time you spend on different things you spend we spend so much time in nonsense nowadays either a few weeks ago when we were in Colorado I went to visit brother Patrick and uh and there he he asked us a question he said have you ever looked on your phone and your tablet and and seen how much time you actually spend on that is yeah he said I looked at it and I was sickened whip let's be there and all the band the videos after videos of YouTube and videos that was the YouTube and so many things on our social media platforms when it's all said and done there's a log and the log is the measurements it measures you your media stand sometimes we don't like the measurements huh right I'm going to lose weight get me a smaller suit we have a running joke and it is we can fit into a slim slim on this like four or five sizes bigger than what we use it if we start measuring there's a lot of things we're not going to like because we enjoy those little cakes [Music] a little extra hot fudge on the ice cream then when we go to put it on the coat it just you know I didn't know I was that size it's no different than when we look at those things measures all the time that we that we that we waste and then we say Lord you are number one in my life yeah you calculate the time you spend with him by the time we spend with everything else and it's not even close he said this brother Patrick says Patrick you know Tavis I'm gonna start in December in December month and I'm going to detox and and this is I said that's a good idea here's when he's there so I'm going to ask you how many you want to detox from all your electronics raise your hand or say Amen if you're not going to do it hold you to it let me see how many of you now you know all the things that you do on it if you use your phone to call somebody or or if you use it for work or or you're studying or whatever that I'm not talking about that is leave it with you how many how many are willing to do that oh I think I can just leave right now just let that settlement come back and ask you in a little bit think about it time to measure ourselves but but I'm not talking about having a measuring stick going around measuring everyone else you don't measure up to what I think a Christian should be like churches have measuring sticks yes or yes COC and they're always everyone's measuring everyone else I'm not talking about that kind of measuring he gave John a read to measure the worshipers or Not by Church ideas but but measure it by this read what is this really it's God's word it is I see [Music] not trying to get people to live up to my standards there's a standard of the word that is much greater than what what our standards but I wonder how much or how many of us would let God actually use us or use the standard for us you find out how addicted you are so many things and at this point so many people don't even care and that's the sad thing yes many are not even willing or wanting to fight anymore that's what I do that's what I do for a good time so uh that's between you and the Lord I was just asking a question is we're all guilty of those things measure the worship my goodness when you see those things that it hurts you to your soul not whether somebody wants to detox or not yes but that the word doesn't change I'm going to say it again the word changes foreign then here most people think that their jobs are secularism meaning they have no religious or spiritual bases we go to work and same thing over and over again [Music] we say work is what we do on a daily basis just to make money to survive or to live on see if that's true what a waste of over a hundred thousand hours of one's life okay think about that stop and think about those things cost us over a hundred thousand hours of work an average person working 40 hours a week for whatever however over a hundred thousand hours with no meaning at all and with no connection Tiempo I don't know about you that's a lot of time and people view their jobs and they say it's the necessary evil says and when we when we when we see that is we work five six days a week and then we Come And We Worship the Lord on Sunday and I say what an error why the Hebrews don't view it like that is when we look at at the amount of time we spend at work the true worshipers has such a different mentality about those things the Bible tells us in Exodus 34 21. six days shall thou work it says and the word work there is the same as to dress it is it's the word again six days shall you serve shall you work shall you worship but on the seventh day Thou shalt rest so to the worshiper even at their jobs they are working for the Lord they are worshiping the Lord they live in a constant worship constantly yeah how many are with me this morning trying to get something across here this morning it's not just a certain time of the week the true worshipers who Worship in spirit and in truth then they are constantly doing they don't take a break from it it is who they are worshipers how many are with me we want to drive this home today they are worshipers constantly every aspect of their lives every moment every minute every hour they are a witness they are a worshiper to the god that they serve do we give are all at work Christians should do we treat others well are we honest are we an example to those around us to those we come in contact with imagine if we could see our work as a time of worship an opportunity to glorify God to a world in darkness that's what real worship is all about it's not just coming to church and saying amen and raising your hands a to be out in the world glorify God with your life that's the greatest worship you can ever do not by how loud you say Amen worship is the life that you live he glorifies God measure the worshiper there's fine people in the world brother Brown says but there's only one Mrs Jesus Jesus come on here's the measure there's only one Mrs Jesus now if I were to ask you how many of you believe you're part of Mrs Jesus Jesus there's only one message Jesus Christ that's where his name lays there is where his worship is worship is not in everybody yet the churches are full of worshipers his worship he says it is in her and her alone all that we do don't let some all that we do in word or indeed we do it in the name of Jesus Christ only she worships under the fire only she worships under that logos that Pillar of Fire that's why the worshiper wants purged has no more desire of sin anymore that's the key word the churchgoer once purged not the religious person has no more desire for sin that's why I tell people and I say if you're still doing your things on the side in your dope and drinking your alcohol and watching your little pornography in your little shows you have not been purged yet might as well say it the way it is not been purged the worshiper once I don't have no more desire for those things yeah we've got desires for a lot of things I will share my glory with no one he says I sure enjoyed brother Jack Duff when we were in last week in Tucson talking about Let the Fire Fall this is began to talk about the generations and how that history repeats itself what God did he says it takes about four generations to repeat what God did in the original generation so he starts to talk and he's reading brother Branham brother Brandon begins to talk about the first generation or the first one would be the messenger of the age right and so the first messenger of the age would be the first generation and he starts by lighting that Messenger on fire to that age he has the fire to that age he's got the fire but by the second generation fire begins to dwindle down there but it's not very small he said but by the third generation it was usually only just Embers left on little Embers that's all that's left he said and by the fourth generation that would be you young you young people by the fourth generation he says there's no Vestige of the original flame anymore this is what we're dealing with when we look at our young people fourth generation is the advantage of what the original fire foreign [Music] church this is this is serious are young people they can they'll die on the vine there'll die just as much inside of church as they will out there in the world and who wants to help I always say it's easy to say and show hey yeah there's a problem yeah but who's going to do something about it thank you I understand why that such an attack spiritually speaking to to get after and to understand true worship once the fourth generation to finish there I'm gonna ask you young young people how many of you wanted to finish with your parents that's it are you all satisfied with that satisfaction my mind you're the fourth generation and there's nothing brother man says there's no what's that word again let me find that word there's no Vestige of the original flame anymore I was hearing the other day oh yeah and I had never heard the rest of the story [Music] Brandon was sitting talking to some people and I knew this part of the story and he looked down to time why did you say 1977. he said because after 1977 it was so dark so dark I don't I don't see how anyone could live past that is you live in such darkness and I had heard that but I had never heard the last part of it they said that someone then asked brother Branham and says what if we ever get two thousands brother Brandon just said they would be the true bride of Jesus no one else could live in that time everyone else would have a form of godliness but no one else can live in this time no one else can overcome no one else can be a true worship elected by God to be that it's it is so serious how many of you young people it's a hard time I understand I get it I have the fourth generation there's no Vestige of the original flame yeah when all looks so gloomy and bad for you all come on are you all ready for this is come on now I'm gonna say it again are you ready for it and all seems to be lost in the fourth generation God comes and lights the fire that is a promise to every one of you that you don't have to be sad about this no more well I just don't understand or I don't get it and I know brother Tommy was a tremendous man but I wasn't here I just hear my parents lift the fire again come on Church Revival fires are flowing people are flowing everywhere what God did in Uganda you all could just see that it's the fire again in your generation you would know that Jesus Christ yesterday with our founding passes let the fire church you want the fire get it Fuego all you gotta do is say Lord I want that fire and start to worship under the fire you'll never make it without worshiping under the fire that's the promise that history he repeats itself the fourth generation fervent desired please it all began to fade as the church went on Olympians the abandonment to God was dying out and people weren't too careful about what God thought of them anymore they changed their manner of dress their attitudes their attitudes their behaviors did the church age of Ephesus for drifting Souls on the sea of life that cycle of Revival in and death has never failed so he is thankful to God for that is why we must worship under the fire because our God is he will not let you be a part-time person he will share his glory with no one no compartment ah mama you asked for today come on you want to see where you're at understand let me ask you all of you of all your Christian experiences that you've ever hadenido when was the Dearest o when was your Christian experience the most serious first love when I first came to the Lord ask yourself that question come on we're measuring with the word that was church when was it most important and great at its greatest points well when I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother is if that's the case you better run because you have fallen foreign [Music] Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ 16 yes he says from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply of events according to the effectual working in the measure of every part it makes an increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love there is a body in every member of that body has to be measured and it's giving a certain measure of Grace thank the Lord for that every messenger that Christ sends comes with a message that message is the measuring stick for their generation I'm gonna say it again in the world every messenger comes with a message they'll be judged Every Generation by that reason Matthew 11 says they departed in Jesus began to talk to the multitude about John Jesus you've heard about John what did you go to see a reed shaken With The Wind in other words man's measuring sticks that bends with every wind of Doctrine because oh my is that what you went to see is someone that would bend the measuring a little bit because of the systems or the churches no no no this read wasn't shaken by any Winds of Doctrine he wasn't removed by religious orders or systems but he brought a message with him and his message was that behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before this what a thing it is prophet of the age comes and brings a message let me tell you that is our message measure yourself with it come on now John is the type of the Bride he was given a read measure the worshipers but it's not measure the worshipers measure someone else with it just measure yourself are you a worshiper take the message of the hour and measure yourself we're too caught up many times measuring everyone else we measure a church service like I said the other day by how much Sensational emotions based on that where are you getting your measuring stick from they don't understand come on church it's time we throw away our measuring sticks having a measuring stick like that foreign come on now our measuring sticks custom made to our feelings our emotions are thinking of life I think this is even if I say I think it doesn't matter it matters what Christopher yeah we tend to judge a church how many people in the church like us what a dumb message hello everybody well they don't like me that really where's gonna get it well I like a lot of people in that church what a dumb foreign we should never measure someone by how they act towards us we should never measure someone by how they act towards us we should measure ourselves by how we respond to the way hello Church hola English now we're using the right measuring stick we're using the right the right read now does it make you any lesser of Who You Are or do you not like it because it's uncovering things about you that are not like oh no stand up where did you get that support where did that building come from the pits of Hell everybody [Music] but we have our own guidelines of how to judge people I hear people saying people talking all the time majority of the time is just a bunch of nonsense and you let it goes I heard some people saying you know certain such and such a people not to mention names and I say to that what a dumb spirit [Music] I bring any a challenge to anyone that wants to talk about that there is not one person that we as a church have ever forced out of church get that measuring they don't understand [Music] that there are conflicts in a church even certain characters show me a church you don't have that question come on show me a family where there's no conflict come on now but to say that our people Force somebody out you know this is that's the measurement that's what it does it takes you there foreign you're using the wrong measuring sticks it's so sick spirit S Services let me ask you a question we become very judgmental Services how many of you would like to be judged by partial truth anybody here why not because you want the judge to hear your side of the story then why do we judge others with partial trips measure the worship let's see the standard the Reed the stick that we should measure ourselves with trying to measure everybody else because you got your own little sticks this is the this is the standard this is the read Luke 6 says 36 says be therefore merciful yeah as your father also is merciful judge not know who's gays and he shall not be judged he shall not be condemned you know forgive and ye shall be forgiven give does and it shall be given unto you good measure taken together and running over shall men give in to your bosom or with the same measure that you need with all it shall be measured to you again in other words the standard by that you use to judge the same standard that will be used against you holy spirit is telling you don't do that that's yourself yes who is trying to judge everyone else by your own standard I had to go check and see what that meant good measure um the Bible's there I was like reading I was like yesterday I'll go back to the other go to English good measure wait a minute down shaken together running over restaurant you know what it was it's when you went to the market and you and you bought something from someone that was generous is poured the grain into your containers and they so for a good measure you began to press it down somebody that wasn't generous they would put it like that and they say okay they shook it a little bit it settles a little bit and as it settles then oh there's more there's more that thing we can put in there and shake it together and then the generous person would put some more grains and they would press it down and then the last scoop it ran over and then you say oh with the same measure Jesus is telling them with all it shall be measured to you oh it's good it's with Bueno when something like that happens we weren't expecting that great generosity so how important is it to be a worshiper a true worshiper of God utmost importance or without worship Elohim would never have become foreign do you know where Christ lives he inhabits the praise come on church amen when's the last time you really praised him and worshiped him I guarantee you that when you do that the Bible says and then the Devil and Tom said he said what is the devil it's in other words he had perfect worships one that fear God and issue with evil so what made him perfect once again so let me ask you how many of you have a worship this is so tremendous to me he feared God it means choose turn off how many of you can job knew how to turn things off especially when there were things in a proof is nope I'm a true word hello everybody hola the word is shoot means to cut the head off come on Church how many people can be like Joe come on foreign foreign love early I should be done right my hours and you won't believe me next time I say stick to an hour I just want to end
