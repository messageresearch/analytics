come and uh give his home God bless you everybody it is good to see you all yes and all your beautiful faces this is the most good-looking family I've ever seen you're welcome I don't know why I just want to say that I'm sorry uh I want I want to get right into this Poe today is um as you all know we've been doing the text all things natural is a sonnet of Supernatural Poetics and the poem today uh has a couple of themes and I'm going to give them to you real quick so remember oceans natural versus the spiritual recorded versus or typing this natural type in the spiritual uh Peter typing the believer is Christ types Christo the oceans of man Inward and outwarda um the subjects of Terror versus salvation and shredding the waters real quick before we go forward I wanted to define the word Terror because it's kind of a nasty word uh in the dictionary Terror just means extreme fear in the dictionary um and you might think well terror is like horror which is mostly what they're associated with a terror is slightly worse because the difference is horror would be if you were swimming in the ocean and you saw a shark and Terror would be if you're swimming in the ocean and you knew there was a shark but you couldn't see it those are the differences but uh it's important to know don't worry salvation is coming so this poem is titled Oceans Deep where men must start in pessamos how deep does our ocean go get them what Terrors does it hide what is it we are pulling in what Darkness eats our lights Jesus walked to tumult sea Jesus in the midst of storm in Medio de la tormenta Peter watched and saw this man forever called the Lord though Christ gave Pete one command to look only to him he walked upon the massive Pond the reservoir Greg he looked into the depths below the depths look back at him swallowing him in a momento his odds grew ever slimes the Lord reached with his mighty hand El Senora Largo supo de rosamano and pulled Pete from the waters hands had gripped his ankles firm susmanos confirmeza to pull him miles under butas the social here we call by name is the sea of man is wonders tempt us to the depths they tempt us to our end nostient human creatures claw our ankles are made with ill attempts careful not to look from Christo or soon you will be swept every tear that falls in here this Abyss has kept is oh fear not little flock who walks the top of the water though the storm may thrash and well our Lord will never falter nuestro Senora if you are to sink and fail no God hath planned your doubted know that Jesus doth remember to you he will reach out yet [Applause] Julian for that hey man would you please stand [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] give one more [Music] into this year [Music] [Music] I said you foreign [Music] [Music] amen without further Ado we're going to introduce tonight's Minister our brother Danny Esquivel how many have come in great expectation Amen Let us sing it again [Music] [Applause] [Music] there some pictures [Music] [Music] it will go [Music] please and like you how many can give unto the Lord Jesus this morning amen a man wasn't in his grace this this evening yes it was his grace hey man so I I didn't tell brother Isaac to sing that song but it goes right in line with what we're going to speak tonight so uh so we're not standing too long um God bless you all this evening thank you God bless you to our pastor for the confidence tonight and let's read our scripture right away so we can take our seats and what's going to be found in Matthew 27 verse 62 Mateo versus and when you have it you can say amen amen now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together into pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I will rise again foreign command therefore that the Sepulcher be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last Heir shall be worse than the first is pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made the Sepulcher sure sealing the stone and setting a watch amen you can be seated and may God add His blessings for the reading of the word so they wanted to make sure that they were guarding the Rock Amen they rolled a great Stone over the tomb and they set forth guards guardes who guard the Rocka but what they didn't realize what's that they were guarding a Rocka beneath the rock the had already testified that in three days I'll rise up again what a Rock Amen so I started thinking about this and this is no no lie and so as I got home last night I had already been thinking about it and uh so last night I was I was working at home and I usually go out to my horse Corrals and I stay about an hour out there yeah and usually that's where I speak to the Lord and so I was I was raking I was I was cleaning up horse manure this is [Music] and I was thinking you know everybody wants to be a Cowboys so it's time to do cowboys all right see and so I was there raking raking up some stuff and the Lord said you're going to speak on the Rock yes and I said I'm going to speak on the Rock you're going to speak on the Rocka I said well I don't know about that um I pretty much already got the schedule down maybe it'll be after the new year and so I'll get ready to speak on the Rock and the Lord said again You're Going to speak on the Rock yes and no sooner than I heard that again the phone rings and I looked at my phone and I was fumbling it around and it said pastor pastor I said man what a coincidence this is pretty coincidental I said I thought to myself no he ain't calling for me to speak no no no no no no I think I just heard that we're all preached out yeah all right so so I answered the phone and he says hey how you doing I said oh pretty good how about you yeah he says let me call you back okay well maybe that means it's going to be like a little lengthier conversation maybe yeah maybe go over a couple things that we had already talked about us and he calls me right back he says uh how do you feel about speaking tomorrow oh I had already known the Lord had already spoken and my lord said unto the and the Lord said unto my Lord and so here we are on the Rock Amen now I started thinking the other day I started to get a little um I was kind of thinking you know kind of like how we do and I started thinking over the years that's something that I think about pretty often I always think about the the first time that I ever went to church and then I start to think about that and I think man what up I know I mean what a what a what a it's unbelievable and then I think about how we came from from you know when I when I first came to church one time it was it was just me my dad and my sisters and so then and then I think about those times and as we got older and older and I you start thinking oh man all the years are passing by so fast and I think well man those days are gone I start looking around and thinking about the people that were there in church and then I think about our founding Pastor I said and I think man those days are going and they're gone they're gone and they're going fast and so you start to think a little bit or I do anyways you think I start to think well look how far I've come oh yeah look how far I've made it and I man I made it this far right look and I look at my family Bill me Familia I think man the stand that I made yeah all right look at look at I'm so blessed when all of a sudden the Lord says it was me the whole time it was God by his grace when I couldn't even stand that was him that was holding me up he has become My Life Source he has become everything to me is everything that I am he has been my wrong he has been my rock in a weary place now when you play football right they call that The Rock right hand me off the rock right that's the one the line when the running back regrets the football because the one thing that he has to do he can be fast right but he's got to guard the wrong right he's got to guard that football is because his adversary he's trying to take the ball away from him right so that's what they call the Rock is so they use the same term in basketball right you got a guard basketball [Music] you got a guard it right and so now as we approach the new year we want to be sure tonight you know because like I said it was God all the time God did it if you're here tonight God did it if you have anything tonight God did it if you have a good job tonight it was God the whole time foreign [Music] A man jumped out of the bushes said oh what are you doing and she says I'm praising God because I was praying to him that I needed food and he heard my prayers and now I have a bunch of food God did it and he said no God didn't do it because I'm an atheist I don't believe in God he said yesterday I was cleaning the side of my house and I heard you praying and I heard that you needed some food he said so stop your worshiping don't praise them you're praising the wrong God says I went to the store I got my credit card and I bought you all these groceries God did it he says I am an atheist I heard you praying I went to the store we are at the end got the groceries put them in my car put them on your porch and I ring the doorbell and she said no sir God did it says you don't understand he says I did it no no no no no God did it he said I did it she said no God did it God heard my prayers that I needed food and God did it and he let the devil pay for it it was God who did it amen now that's the attitude that we have to have it was God who did it it was God who has brought us this far with music you know it was God who was the rock the Bible says that he is salvation he is my Refugee who is there none like God there is none like him tonight God did it and I thank God save me yes we see here now David was a man the Bible says he was a man of Praise And so David he would write songs like that he was right like the Lord is my refuge is the Lord is my strength and we find out here you know I wanna I wanna read something that brother Brandon says and brother Brandon says this in the new year right and so he says now now Heavenly Father his brain and he's talking about the new year and he says Heavenly fathers we stand here [Music] as many thoughts as dying out in our hearts and the mistakes of last year and as we're approaching the death of 62. and the birth of 63. oh God maybe may we be one step higher until we can see Jesus Jesus and his program May everyone here Lord in my prayer well the old year is dying and the new birth of the new year is coming yeah May the old man's sin and unbelief die out in our hearts and the New Birth come in with the 1963. and we'll just put 2023 there like a rushing Mighty Wind come on that may fill our being and make us new creatures in Christ this is the part that come is he says make us fit service forgive our past bless our future guide us O Lord bless these ministers okay be thou with us Lord we are your servants and we give ourselves for 2023.3 that the power of your spirit might have more preeminence in our lives forgive us and help us we pray oramos raise up mighty Manos that raise up mighty men that was his prayer and why the controversy now why the controversy the prophet of God is praying to God and God answers his prayers and Men become a scandal and it becomes so he says raise up mighty man raise up Mighty Warriors in the face openness Lord that hidden man Escondido the Rocka he's dead let me say that again he said Lord he says open this year that hidden man let's say my nice candido the Rocka beneath that we might see the program of God Lord put the Capstone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessings be upon us all guesses May the power of the Resurrection come upon us that's not what he says he says foreign [Applause] [Music] and uh and so you know he had to go he couldn't uh all the soldiers were crying and so uh he went with the with a soldier and so so when he got to this certain place uh God drew his attention to Iraq deals and he says uh go to The Rock he says why does he want me to go to the Rock right and he says get closer to the Rock right and so as he gets closer to the Rock so everything else because of the gases the the grass the weeds the trees they died right and so so he says get closer to the Rocka and he says now pick up the Rocka and so he picks up the Rock and underneath the rock was the Easter lily you've heard the story right you've read the story right so he says there there was an Easter lilians it had life inside of it and that life because it was underneath because of the gases underneath the Rocks Jesus is the rock okay God is in Isaiah 42 11 in is it's this decent let the Wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice foreign [Music] I went to another level of thing I didn't even know I could sing like that but then I went to another level oh my pain was gone Montana now I always say I am not gonna be the way I preach I'm gonna be cool next time I want to be like that guy yeah he's just monotone [Music] right but you know what let us have a kid let the inhabitants of the rock sing que losses I just can't help it that's the way it made me because he has been my rocks he has been there with me that's my rock it's a miraca now hold up now one day Jesus asked the question Jesus you know because as we heard beautifully Illustrated that Jesus had been hearing about what people were talking about Orlando right and so he asked the question he said who do men say that I am this is well the disciples were also they had heard around the city so they began to say well some say that you're Elias one of the prophets right and so so he personally directed them and he said to Peter Pedro he said but who do you say that I am this is who do you say that I am yeah and you know Peter Peter was bold Peter was both somebody was talking about Peter the other day I said man that's going to be a real awkward conversation for you when you get over there and you gotta face Peter you said the stuff that you were saying about Peter that's going to be real awkward right Peter was Bold And he says you know what is that okay I'm just gonna say it well I'm gonna I'm gonna say maybe it might not even be right boys foreign [Music] saroka [Applause] right correct but we always like to look at Peter because it was already predestinated that kind of reminds me of how one brother Brandon went across the curtain of time now will I be judged like well you know because they said you'll be judged and you're the people that believe your message or you preached to will be judged according to which is will Paul be judged yes all will be judged and they'll be judged according to what Paul brothers and he said well then I preached for Paul praying I preached that's not so much what gets it is Cried Out Clamato we are resting on that I wasn't even born I wasn't even born when he went across the corner of time but I believe I was one of the Millions foreign you want to make sure that you have the Rocks you want to guide your rock Uno foreign and this is Brother Branham uses this scripture the message shalom I mean Shalom right and he also references Isaiah and he says arise and arise and shine for your life has come right in in Gross darkness and then brother Brandon begins to say you know like we're living in a time of gross darkness and then he reads is uh Psalms 62 and then he says these two scriptures are totally contrast but he says now we're living in dark times you go home and read that message because if I repeat what brother Brown says somebody's going to say right oh he's throwing at me all right because some of us do what brother Brown same here okay we're not going to read it you read it at home and so he's talking about women oh they want to put the pants he starts talking about the man just aren't Burly anymore not Burly they're not manly yeah they want to wear certain things I won't repeat because you're going to look at somebody and say oh it'll give you a reason to go read it okay so he says he says so we're living in Gross Darkness we're living in dark times but that's why I wanted to read this scripture foreign yes right why are we always it's so dark oh it's so evil oh man look at these videos they're evil [Music] oh man they're Evil Dead dangerous Danger right that's the way we are right and so brother Brown says Shalom peace trolling my soul waiters upon God for him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation no David found himself one day David mighty warrior of God is he was hiding in a Rocka right and the Bible says that one day fall who was his adversary was looking to kill him right and he went into the same cave where David was now there's a great lesson in that too so if you want to go read that story right David went and cut off but the Lord got a hold of David right and David David said that that's God's anointed right A Dream David that he had done that the grief David that he had done that choice right and so so David found himself in this cave but David knew that the cave wasn't his security The Rock wasn't his security he said he only is my rock in my city David knew that God had done it David knew David that God was his protection that his job was in his rock that his job was in his Rock he alone it is was nothing in the basket he looked in there and he he was he was about to get up at the pulpit he was about to blast the congregation yeah I had bills that I needed to pay uh they didn't even bring Tyler off when all of a sudden God stopped him they repented and he said they are not your Source they're a resource I am the source right so God tonight he is your source he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved now how did David get to this place uh here's a boy can you imagine this well right imagine this scene we've said it many times right and then here's this um little old brother Branham says ready little Ruddy fellow muchachito okay and so can you imagine this here he comes and he says uh who's this uncircumcised Philistine is challenging the armies of the Living God stand up this is the conversation this guy right here he says who's that giant over there who's been following the armies of the Living God I just wanted them to get out a visual of the size and so he says uh well look at him we didn't know he says you know I'll go fight him what makes you think that you can go fight that giant well one day I was in the field just only Campo and I was watching my father's sheep is you don't you don't you're not capturing it he said a Lion King Leon you're you're not getting it I was hunting me and my wife and javelina you know how Alina was coming down the same Trail we were coming down right and they don't have good eyesight you know cause I'm like does he see me or is he charging me this was the javelina javelina it's big right so that thing was coming at me is that is anybody so I put my bow down and I pulled out my pistol it's okay that thing makes one more move Charlotte right but David said one day I was watching my father's sheep and a lion king [Applause] know you you can't fathom that Leon what did you do to the lion let me ask you again what did you do to the lion he says I took that lion out oh I flew that lion you slow a lion they could capture it they could capture it they didn't live in big old houses that we live in here Jungle of uh asphalt right because a guy in that time a guy in that time he knew if you ran into a lion on the trail it was pretty much sudden death practice he says I slew that lion you you killed the lion yeah and one day a bear too I killed the Big Bear give me that old rock to me that was sent to me by a prophet and I received it by five stones I received it with five Stones does that give me something that I know in English Jesus gave me a password Give Me Prophet Prophet us give me preach the evangelists there is something that I know don't give me your new Revelations and the Bible says that David went out and he took that rock he says he took that stone and he put it in a slingshot right and so he got this Stone so before we go there we're going to go to Deuteronomy 32 so get that ready 32 30 and 31. and so David says the Bible says that David took his link I don't know how many swings he took but it won't matter right right it wouldn't matter no important it doesn't matter if you if you if you take the football doesn't matter right if you if you hike a football is football and how many steps if you don't have a NFL alarm I'm gonna do you no good right it might be good for Junior League but it doesn't matter the wind up it don't matter if you're pitching and you do a big wind up if you don't have that wrong bye I don't know how many swings he took no sequence [Music] maybe five maybe seven right maybe seven and the Bible says that he flew that rock he let it go crack Goliath School is [Music] if it was coming out of a gun it would have to come out at the speed of 1000 feet per second one thousand feet per second means that that stone significance at 688 miles an hour that there's not a man alive 688 miles per hour no let me clarify that clarification 688 it was a Jesus Jesus it was that God that yours was David's Rock and in verse 31 it says foreign Jesus how many love the Lord say ah your rock is not like my rock um right you're a rock even even your enemies and Amigos they know and you'll stop it oh they might talk about you oh but they know this is the Rock of Ages it was God with youth indeed it was God now the rock is with us tonight as we go into the new year as brother Brandon was reading that prayer right and he and he uh in closing I want to read this yes now let us down to our feet now and every one of us you know there's power in the Rock right correct brother Brown says David knew it David had that power right and Samson he said he had that power he knew that there was power in the Rock and so he says the contest is on for each one of you Paul said forgetting those things that are the or in the past all of our mistakes last year I pressed towards the mark of the High Calling president all my mistakes that I have made in all these years forgive me for them God forgive me Church forgive me Ministry that I have failed with wow what does this put me oh I feel yeah God forgive me foreign he felt like he had failed that was the end of 1962. whatever holds tomorrow whatever tomorrow holds I don't know but I Know Who Holds 1963. we know what happened in 1963. all right he says whatever holds whatever tomorrow holds I don't know you're not saying Garden God had already predestinated God had already foreign not so puffed up anymore right I have failed filled with okay so let us raise our hands to God let us pray in our own way so everyone raise your hands that believe this and I'm going to read brother Brown's prayer and you pray right you pray let us raise our hands to God now and let us pray in our own way as we make our confessions and ask God to help us through the next coming year heavenly father as we stand here as many thoughts is dying out in our hearts and
