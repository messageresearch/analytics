[1:23:01] begins to write about it
[1:23:03] autumn rain ten years later you know
[1:23:05] this was up now we're in the 1500s yeah
[1:23:08] that was a mementos a man by the name of
[1:23:11] Copernicus who no begins to write
[1:23:14] and psst weed where is he getting his
[1:23:17] anointing or his thoughts from they

[1:23:58] come on the way you I don't know what I
[1:24:00] want you to see how what the deception
[1:24:02] if it's in something like this because
[1:24:04] an illness appears then I'll go how much
[1:24:06] more the deception in the spiritual
[1:24:08] realm not the other steps you're in
[1:24:10] another is pretty flat so the dark ages
[1:24:13] and this is a diet
[1:24:15] hold on non estar pasando when all of a
[1:24:18] sudden quando de repente a Howard of the
[1:24:20] earth they'll appear a bright tree had
[1:24:22] been or even down to a stump a ladder
[1:24:24] rollin s you know commune style trunk

[1:25:06] they know that people are not gonna
[1:25:08] accept that or something can put on
[1:25:10] holiday that's heresy
[1:25:11] here so what do they do yes and they
[1:25:13] start another branch commune significant
[1:25:16] Authority twenty years after Luther
[1:25:19] proclaimed his message he maintains a
[1:25:21] physic in the Tarot plaka may start
[1:25:23] another branch what means and not to
[1:25:24] harm the society of jesus a Tzadik
[1:25:26] ensues who are its members Genesis was
[1:25:29] me Ambrose the Jesuit priest
[1:25:31] sweetest and they began to push the idea
[1:25:34] impose on them

[1:25:49] Stephanie met alas they would let on but
[1:25:51] little by little
[1:25:52] there are poco poco then came new and in
[1:25:54] Kepler you can only lay all these men
[1:25:56] godly late doses they began to push the
[1:25:58] agenda in personam Bucharest asked him
[1:26:00] what's going on in all this esta pasando
[1:26:02] canto the same token in la misma say yon
[1:26:04] God is moving your system now remember

[1:26:09] actually feel the Holy Spirit move but
[1:26:11] the winners pictures at the moment in

[1:30:35] move the one asking can stolen lost him
[1:30:37] Webby
[1:30:40] and that it is the earth which shifts
[1:30:44] and turns he gives that theory like a
[1:30:46] heater when we see such Minds from the
[1:30:49] way most l is men tests we must indeed
[1:30:51] confess they were adamant that they know
[1:30:53] most that mr. devil has possessed them
[1:30:55] suppose a either and that God sets them
[1:30:58] before us as mere he says you know
[1:31:00] Spinelli delante know so - in order to
[1:31:02] keep us in his fear that Montoneros and
[1:31:05] suit a motor now I I'm not pushing you
[1:31:09] one way or the other journalists in
[1:31:10] pianey flat earther and I ain't aglow be
[1:31:12] no kickin alone - there are many things
[1:31:16] that even in the scriptures that I want
[1:31:18] to know but I may be many things we
[1:31:20] won't ever know okay but one thing is
[1:31:23] for sure we're not posses here that I
[1:31:25] know
[1:31:26] Bible says this in Joshua 1011 is worth
[1:31:29] yes
[1:31:30] and Joshua 1012 yes dusty then spake
[1:31:33] Joshua to the Lord in the day when the
[1:31:35] Lord delivered up the amorite hello Jose

[1:31:44] Israel until a person ceadeus on the
[1:31:47] console standstill death in thing upon
[1:31:50] Gibeon in Cameroon wait a minute
[1:31:53] it's finished if the Sun is the center
[1:31:55] and everything goes around it he didn't
[1:31:58] he have said Earth stand still no they
[1:32:00] are litera here rock artists to HEPA now
[1:32:03] that's my reasoning that's not God
[1:32:05] that's my reasoning should he have said
[1:32:07] that no why did he say Sun stand still
[1:32:11] poor kid he controls even more light
[1:32:13] necesita loose upon reading and the
[1:32:16] Earth Stood Still in a terror cell it

[1:32:22] get the verso and the Sun yes or Stood
[1:32:26] Still say the two bow and the moon in
[1:32:28] illuminate separate until the people had
[1:32:31] avenged themselves upon their enemies

[1:34:55] up on Mount Palomar just or Mount Wilson
[1:34:58] he says and then Monday William in
[1:35:00] California few weeks ago - I said in the
[1:35:03] observatory there it may contain the
[1:35:05] lobster I thought you and all listen to
[1:35:07] him now if you can see all I ever
[1:35:09] learned about the solar system no look
[1:35:12] at yet Brent deal so the system must be
[1:35:14] scientifically proven when I was a boy
[1:35:16] can wear a scientific Amenti program
[1:35:18] about 30 years ago and oh you know
[1:35:20] muchacha say trained tanya has all been
[1:35:22] changed now
[1:35:23] I told us you know cambia Laura and
[1:35:26] scientifically proven he prevails in TV
[1:35:28] commentator they was wrong then esta my
[1:35:32] name is Molly entonces did you ever
[1:35:35] think of that have youngsters pants out
[1:35:37] of this they used to tell me medicine
[1:35:39] that the Sun stood perfectly still
[1:35:40] cancel second and the world turned
[1:35:43] around he can mundo here a lot now they
[1:35:45] say that that's wrong
[1:35:46] I would I use D CK system that the Sun
[1:35:48] does the running al-qahirah cell see the
[1:35:51] Sun runs to insulting
[1:35:53] and now they saying that both of them
[1:35:55] run he's humble that he doesn't brother
[1:35:57] Brown says in the matter on this day I

[1:36:00] you know until no I can't get it either
[1:36:07] temple for your lien okay let's but I'm
[1:36:09] after something here it's following I
[1:36:11] can't get it he's gonna poke up you know
[1:36:14] Joshua might have been right right when
[1:36:16] he said oh she asked her son to stand
[1:36:18] still Jesus co-star you can deliver a
[1:36:20] circus a padding but you always find
[1:36:22] that you come back to the Bible it is
[1:36:24] different when team agrees that is real
[1:36:26] book but case is a liberal I mean the
[1:36:28] Bible is the right science book and
[1:36:31] Libya is a little la ciencia correct oh
[1:36:33] oh I love this book you are much too
[1:36:38] liberal
[1:36:39] there's a lot I don't understand I don't
[1:36:40] matter one these days whether around
[1:36:42] this side or the other side here's show
[1:36:43] it to him entiendo que lo lo lo entiendo
[1:36:46] I was talking he says your glove Aziz
[1:36:48] 1961 I was talking to mr. Thais yellow
[1:36:52] cone mr. ta eyeball teacher in high
[1:36:54] school whom is Troilus quill anus you
[1:36:56] know it was she said I believe what the
[1:36:58] Bible said you see your critical Amelia
[1:37:00] this day that or I said I believe what
[1:37:05] the Bible said that the Sun stopped this
[1:37:07] Aquila on the easy control panel Joshua
[1:37:09] said to the Sun stand still
[1:37:11] Josue Leticia soul cat get it no parity
[1:37:13] he says well he just stopped the world
[1:37:16] he's helped al mundo he seen Josh was
[1:37:19] ignorance help me know like not answered
[1:37:20] a Josue I said you do the same by your
[1:37:23] intelligence then there's the lo mismo
[1:37:25] since Portsmouth daily hence here
[1:37:26] because you just said okay took on a
[1:37:28] theory that if the world were to stop
[1:37:31] Casey al mundo para see the
[1:37:33] gravitational pull would not be there
[1:37:35] like anomaly that people would start
[1:37:36] falling off you got pine island to say
[1:37:38] like him so now you're saying that well
[1:37:40] God stop the world and this is Jose pero
[1:37:42] el mundo
[1:37:42] arrested he's he understand so what
[1:37:44] she's he's letting him hang himself
[1:37:46] Lukas equation solo smart man who know
[1:37:49] them we Savio watch this now Joshua was
[1:37:53] the way why he says if dijo it was a
[1:37:56] paradox
[1:37:57] I don't paradox in the Sun Stood Still
[1:37:59] one well don't think at all
[1:38:00] Kia tone it was it was so so hard to
[1:38:03] believe yet it's so true in stand alone
[1:38:05] the greatest number
[1:38:07] I was talking to a scientist and he goes
[1:38:09] on to relate the same thing
[1:38:10] eben unscientifically CDC la misma and
[1:38:13] then he and then SES he goes on Amit
[1:38:15] estiga he said you see Ben the Sun and
[1:38:19] so and we say they tell us today this is
[1:38:22] and still no the world turns around this
[1:38:24] is the paradox now they soon find a
[1:38:25] doctor down the marriage message paradox
[1:38:30] 1964 they say if the world stops the
[1:38:35] grid of course the the gravitational
[1:38:36] hold they say it would fall off the sake
[1:38:39] idea and then brother round it goes on
[1:38:41] just saying you know lemon everybody say
[1:38:43] whatever he stopped looking like a
[1:38:45] parado I don't know what he stopped no
[1:38:48] se que is looking for oh but because a
[1:38:50] man saying stand still but operculum
[1:38:53] radhika Kasich and it's written in here
[1:38:56] yes that's creepy
[1:38:57] the Sun Stood Still and stole second
[1:38:59] opiate oh well whatever God says look at
[1:39:08] this do whatever God did he says I don't
[1:39:10] know yo no sé kids okay it's what the
[1:39:12] Sun Stood Still so se quedó kind of home
[1:39:15] Stood Still who NASA kazakian and we and
[1:39:17] because of a man a human being he put
[1:39:20] you said oh ma no that was in the line
[1:39:22] of duty
[1:39:22] it's our little Devere I commanded it
[1:39:25] let mondo oh and if we're we Christians
[1:39:28] this is not Eskimo kiss ya know we have
[1:39:30] to believe this to be the infallible
[1:39:32] Word of God
[1:39:33] it's a lapidary everywhere he
[1:39:36] stopped the world and all Mundi stopped
[1:39:38] the Sun but also whatever he did okay
[1:39:41] Lee so it Stood Still for about 24 hours
[1:39:44] I believe it Joe Nickell 1965 now
[1:39:48] insistence they say what a paradox
[1:39:50] thank you peridot I don't know what you
[1:39:52] people think no second look is tears
[1:39:54] being that thinks the world was it runs
[1:39:56] that runs the incent kill mando heater
[1:39:58] but anyhow the Sun Stood Still pero
[1:40:01] hasta que dokie atone goes on
[1:40:03] no no Christ is revealed in his own word
[1:40:07] but at least our allowance appropriately
[1:40:08] on some time ago this is four months
[1:40:11] before he passes away
[1:40:12] estos cuatro meses at the skin fires you
[1:40:14] watch him now frequency you know some
[1:40:16] time ago so a new team but they told us
[1:40:18] no the here on the earth said that he
[1:40:20] saw four
[1:40:21] angels standing on the four corners of
[1:40:22] the earth on the landlady came in aqua
[1:40:24] trunculus but I was a country in a still
[1:40:26] a tiara no cuz the earth was round for
[1:40:28] Kayla Tara and redundant this is our
[1:40:32] prophet now speak instant news to profit
[1:40:33] on Londo he said but the Bible said is
[1:40:37] the peril of India this day four corners
[1:40:40] cuatro schemas now we can try to figure
[1:40:42] that out that that was when was the
[1:40:44] doors out we can figure all those things
[1:40:46] out but I can't figure it out sorry
[1:40:48] general rapport figure that but the
[1:40:49] Bible says four corners it eleven LASIK
[1:40:51] what risk let it has four corners he
[1:40:53] could gimmick well now you see two weeks
[1:40:55] or three weeks ago who steady I say
[1:40:57] those who trust it was in the papers and
[1:40:59] the only loss an intact in this article
[1:41:01] in a static when they found out that
[1:41:03] Iran cuenta who they found out say they
[1:41:08] don't cuenta that the world is square
[1:41:11] del mundo splenic morado and to our
[1:41:15] reasoning a parent or an absurdity
