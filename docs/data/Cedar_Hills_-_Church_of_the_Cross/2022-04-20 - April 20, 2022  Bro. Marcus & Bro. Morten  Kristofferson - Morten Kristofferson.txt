god bless you brothers i'd like to share a real quick quick testimony um i don't get up here much less monday not this past monday but last monday of last week some of us man come to prayer in the morning and um me and my wife uh we had a real graveyard snake she could not sleep that night she had a back neck pain real painful all night she stood awake and i she was groaning and i believe we all understand that i'd heard okay when the morning when i got here i very seldom will ask for something very seldom i would ask for something and then brother kevin looked at me about the kayla pray for my wife all my brothers brothers [Applause] almighty god of israel mighty god of israel oh there's so much to thank the lord for right testimony after testimony i also like the money on earth miss morton [Applause] my interpreters have a hard time with me i guess my accent [Applause] we just don't come to ask we got petitions but i like to say this before we go before the lord precious brother caleb please a message we have a high priest i'll i go to my tablet and open it up and the first thing that comes up rest for a little bit and i combine those complements for it yes and you are the omega eustace and omega and we are the omegas awesome brother thank the lord almighty god of israel almighty god of israel i love that explanation almighty god of israel israel oh my god my father my father my father my father the horsemen thereof the horsemen thereof lord we we pretend this petitions lord you're hearing us he doesn't feel well our high priest our high priest is touched by it he knows we're just going to spank them sorry andres and jacob jacob lord we come before your presence and just like you have always heard us even jesus when he came to the tomb of lazarus he turned around and said father i thank you lord because we're touching these people in need right now amen you'd all be seated at this time i believe we have a poem by our brother julian hill and immediately following will be the cedar hills choir amen god bless you hey everyone oh there we go hi uh hello everybody god bless you um i had another poem for you today but it's very short and the story that or how it came about is probably longer than the poem itself um but sometimes it's not so much about how long the poem is but what the message is behind it that's important and uh to give you a bit of backstory about this poem i uh a lot of the poetry that i've received for this happened about two to three years ago so what i'm about to tell you is no longer relevant but just so you know it was a very dark time about two or three years about years ago for me and uh i was dealing with a lot of things internally and this poetry was how i processed that in this specific piece i started to deal with existentialism a little bit and if you know what that is it's basically just uh trying to figure out where you are in the grand scheme of things in life and whether or not you're you're worth anything in it it's a big question and it's a question that has to do with purpose and huge things like that and um the devil likes to use that to manipulate you a lot because he can tell you something like well you don't matter in the grand scheme of things or we'll look at other people what they're doing on social media or even your immediate peers around you look at all the things they're doing you're doing nothing and uh you're meaningless you don't matter and that it's a big lie but it's one that tends to to work very well on us and so the beauty of this poetry and what god showed me through these things was how to shine the light in those areas and tell the devil he was lying and um in this specific piece i'm titling it here it's uh i'm going to call it the sands of time it's called xliv but i give you guys titles to to make more personal it's called the sands of time and it has to deal with the idea of of uh being a speck of dust amidst an ocean of sand and trying to to come to terms with that and figure out how you can find your importance in it and um i would recommend rereading this a lot there's a lot of hidden little secrets in here that you can find double meanings in but if you want to do that you can talk to me and i'll get you a copy but this is it the sands of time to the mortal man we are but a speck of dust in the sands of time blowing in the vast breeze nobody in particular only revealers of the jewels in our midst as they brush us aside but to god he remembers every grain of sand to him we are so much more valued at a price unmatchable by any mortal to him we are a nobody shaped to be somebody though the dust may go to dust as ashes go to ashes we are like the desert in which he loves to dwell proving to be the oasis in all his endless time and that is it and god bless you [Applause] you um so [Music] see i am [Music] stations [Music] i am [Music] [Music] oh my youngest [Music] [Music] good [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] foundations [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] is [Music] now [Music] [Applause] amen god bless the choir amen would you all stand [Applause] man i believe we have come to the most important part of the service that is to hear straight from the throne of god how many have come expecting great things tonight amen we'll sing that song at the cross and we'll be introducing brother marcus christopherson and immediately following be our brother morton let's just sing that song at the cross and just get ready for the word amen [Music] and [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh at the cross at the cross oh where i first saw the light oh and the burdens [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] i am happy all the day one more time with all your heart oh at the cross at the [Music] the burden of my heart [Music] was [Music] received [Music] god bless you all i want to thank [Music] your hospitality is very amazing and special for us when we first came it was like i've [Applause] we have all been in christ before before the foundation of this world was laid so that's why i recognize you yes in the spirit of the lord jesus christ that we all are a member of a part of the body of christ and we all play a very important part on the body of jesus christ we all are a part of the body of jesus christ so when we look at each other we look at jesus christ so i want to greet you all and uh really look forward estoy so god bless you all [Applause] oh yeah and i just have to say we we've had a really really nice time here so far and i'm uh i'm very thankful to the pastor and the home industry for uh showing me the confidence so as brother marcus said we feel like home coming and i wish i had enough time to have a talk with everyone so we are really looking forward to that time and there is no time limit anymore so um okay i had a thought on my heart so uh so let's go to go to the scripture almost and and i put the title to my my simple message title is we know that this is the end not the end of the world and there is let's go to hebrews chapter 12 very familiar scripture person but there's so much in it wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every way and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set forth after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet poking which which said come up hit her and i will show you the things which must be hereafter this question is and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the trunk of the father father celestial we thank you for this wonderful word and the revelation you have given us only by your grace because this message is a message of grace followed so may you bless your word father and bless all my brothers and sisters here in jesus name amen amen well that the voice you might be sitting when it's in touch the voice that john here was lavos scucha juan come up peter is souviaca well and still i think most of us musically has a question how to get there yeah and how to get higher commodity but paul said something pablo that's really important lay aside every way think of john pincus to the one he was in a certain condition both spiritually and naturally ambassador that when he heard the voice that's really important that we can recognize the voice and immediately in media get into the spirit in the spiritual and get higher each week on the ground and sometimes well it looks like even though i'm a believer i sometimes also feel like i'm crawling on the ground and sometimes feel like eating dust because we are sometimes very down to the earth but in this hour and being overcomers and actually it's impossible to to be overcomers as long as every person who offends us and we most likely we find ourselves battling with those things so when we are kind of weighed down by so many earthly things content so under heavy weights many christians they they find a way of getting used to that kind of life getting used to carrying all those things but that's not scripture because paul said get rid of pablo so when paul said said get rid of every way if we are believers we must believe that there is a way it come a question to my mind where do i build my house where do i build my life this is an eagle won't build his nest on the ground the eagle builds his nest way as high as he can get in the highest peaks you are a candle that sits on a hill [Music] the altas anticipationists we are expecting great things system was expectative of the grand discussions we are not saying well i'm pentecostal that i'm a methodist so that don't satisfy me satisfaction i got the ambition to move until i meet him in control [Applause] [Music] well john what type of the bride is so it it means you and me he is a type of human being and he heard the voice say come up here and and john was in a condition that made him able to get into that spirit capacity and in that condition the lord showed him the whole preview and in this drama drama we are compassed about with so great when you are going live on the stairway in vivo and this drama in this drama you must be prepared both in your soul your spirit and your body and sometimes we are forgetting about the problem sometimes we are getting very spiritual in order to stay in the right conditions and i hope it's okay for you that i speak a little bit about the body yes and you know when we when we were like babies sometime later we we we started we learned to swim you also have to learn how to fly well somebody leaves that believes that the rapture is is something and we are going like rockets but the rapture is actually a little tiny and when this seed is fully measured we will step into another dimension but until then we have to take care of this temple because when you are listening to the word the word has to go through certain channels and now we come to the tricky part all right [Music] so many times i i've said to myself which is versus medici and it is possible yes possibly but it happens it depends on my attitude it depends on me at tooth actually according to the best thing to do as soon as you wake up in the morning is to get right into the spirit because if you and i go right into the spirit the direction for the rest of the day is already set direction but you have to get into the right kind of spirits because there are many spirits and and and in this time we so easily get caught by all the spirits through a lot of different channels if we are not conscious and bring ourselves right into the holy spirit what does that mean read it in the same time that satan has to lose all his demons eating demons but the best way to cast out the demons is to act contrary to what the demon tells you to do have you ever felt that poo algona alone so what kind of decision do we make classes and very often they think okay just one more time you see then you glorify him and to bring myself higher amen actually we can't bring ourselves higher and i will give you a little testimony of what it means for me and when going through this pasta i i want you to remember one thing who is your greatest enemy in amigo and if i tell you maybe you won't like me so i will i will let brother branham answer that question some brother branham he says this is that's the biggest enemy i got is william branagh yes william branham he's always in my ways he's always in god's way i will say he always gets in god's way he is too tired he don't want to do this you don't want to do that if i just if i can just crucify that god can use it just he can use this body so i tell you a little story about myself for for many years the hardest thing in my life the most efficient me vida was to get up on what about you i i was always like a last minute sleeper i it so when i finally got up on the finale i felt like my whole life was like a mess and i was behind all others well i had a little discussion with the brother caleb this morning chocolate because we also need some some bitter things he said it was his religion he said he is well it could have the same effect on our brain or smoking or drinking because sugar it affects our reward center in our brain and every time we take in that stuff we we ourselves with something but it's a kind of tipping point here if you feel too good it will be harmful that's the reason children they they when it comes to candies and things they can't control themselves because in this there are so many spiritually candy stores around us for cheap price can get a lot of candies because when too much sugar you are getting brain fog and and with that kind of fog it's really difficult to judge things judge things the right way you see ben so we can see when when when people get too much sugar they are not stable not established but really unstable so in established and unpredictable impressiveness men and it's not good for their body but i was taking a lot of sugar because every morning after some few loaves of bread despite this i was not drinking chocolate chocolate i was eating it and drinking coffee and the more chocolate interesting the more coffee and not only chocolate no solo chocolate cake especially marzipan cake especially exactly but the consequence of this consequence was that i got sick in my body and i was gaining a lot of weight and i got so tired and i was some time ago i i was counting on how many hours i spent on the sofa in the afternoon because i had to crash down to the sofa every afternoon and sometimes sleeping one hour two hour three hours my calculation told me miss calculus that i spent more time on the sofa during 16 years than a pilot spends up in the air during his whole career think of that brother that's a lot of armors wow so um in the evenings always a big bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce on it yeah because the body is demanding because it goes to the reward caleb and his wife was so nice to us and they let us have their car because in the house also we could drive he said something the hulk be aware that this power is a diesel vehicle but actually [Music] i tried it out when we were happy so i started thinking how could so we'll see there is a bacterial flora are you not florida the bacteria you know that that are our enemy bacteria but those who should be there are our friends amigos actually we cannot live without nobody and there are billions of high pioneers they use in our brain we have billions of brains there must be units and we need those brain cells for everything we do and and we need that those brain cells they they are conscious because sometimes especially when driving car especially sometimes it's a matter of a second question we have to make the right decision correct but if we have if we have too much heavy weight on us we run the risk of acting too slow establish we run the risk of not recognizing the voice you see ben so for our stomach to to work properly it needs healthy foods the same way as our soul needs healthy spiritual food and if you carry the muscle you can't grow no no in order to grow we need solid food solido and what is growing quest i'll show you in a minute it's going up is [Applause] the opposite thing is shrinking it's important to know the difference it's important i'll tell you something our bacterial flora flora bacterial is communicating it's with our brains so if we eat junk food chico memos basura eating sugar azucares and now the stomach starts to send kind of and clear signals and we run the risk of acting in the wrong way it was god but in order to to get get rid of things we have to make at this decision we we need to have a right attitude correct and and make a commitment to ourselves to the lord is but in an easy life you can't overcome peru so we have to like brother branham said tenemos commodities in the modern have expectations that are expectative what kind of expectation class of expectatives that i can do better because i need to grow i need to get up higher lot of pains in my body muchos dolores said me cuerpo i could hardly walk difficult hardly do things difficult a specialist told me especially you look like a car that hasn't been repaired for 30 years you must do your part of us so when i got to a specialist specialist he said the first because i was i was aching so badly i was walking like this you see ben and when we went somewhere for having a walk in the city or something i i i just said my family here is a bench down here and you know where you find me you see it's not a good condition so when i came to that specialist specialist he said because i asked him could you help me with some some insoles [Music] and he was asking questions for one hour [Music] and the first thing you have to start with is to improve your balance to equilibrium so he said the oil closure right and he said from there you have to because when you get older he said if you don't have good balance when equilibrium in your body is especially in your feet especially if your muscles and things are not trained you will so easily fell on the ground and break bones in your body you see ben it was about that i had some motivation for doing this because i knew something it will be painful anyhow if i do nothing it will be very painful so better take some pain now to make some gains and beneficial so i started off with this mpc so long story short brazil historian i lost like 50 pounds and and my physical condition was you can make the puedes so conscious the best thing was one morning half past six remember last time i had that that feeling of being well rested so i was thinking for a little while why did i wake up and another voice told me don't ask you many questions and i i started arguing a little bit and i i said that well this good feeling will soon come to an end but then i made a decision yes to get right out of the bed but i knew in order to to have this lasting pero i have to get higher it's not enough with one app you mean for me it was like going into another dimension now aura i had energy when they're here and i made a decision i will use my energy for something very very important so every morning i open i open my ipad and i turned on some sermons from [Music] las cruces and i was listening hours and by doing this it it sets the direction for when doing this on monday morning because sunday is a wonderful day but monday is also really good because on monday morning i'm watching the service from las cruces from sunday and and that kind of gives me power for the whole week so it sets the direction it's for tomorrow and the next day and the next day until thursday morning when i'm listening to the sermon from the wedding and then next monday another sunday sermon otro servicio del domingo and in in between in with you thursdays and mondays there is so many things on that youtube channel it is the canal the youtube the las cruces and going back many years sometimes amazing grace gracia that i can sit up in norway amongst the billions of pine trees in telus beyond is from the ministry in las cruces del ministerio in las cruces and feel that i am a part of the same spirit i am a part of the same body this is something supernatural and by listening to hundreds of those sermons so i could come and see you in person and that makes me thinking of that great day when we all will be gathered in person and persona not through technology technology but in the same spirit as the body of christ as his pride we meet him our bridegroom and amen because there was a little woman that came to the wealth to draw water okay naturally agua natural and she was so burnt yesterday she met the man in control she was predestinated from eternity this was god's perfect timing and she was so down to the ground yesterday that she got desperate he just said she broke all those circles she she went in the circle for a certain time and just turned into another circle and another circle but those circles didn't bring her up well she met a very special man she had before she had six men in her life and then she was flying even higher and then she saw that he was messiah okay and she got even higher to your own muscle and she saw that he was crying you see ben what a revelation and she got so high that she left her water and ran into the city and she was testifying about this man who had told her all about and for many years of her life the power of gravity el poderte la graveda hold her down to the earth all the time and that's the power of the revealed word for this hour god bless you everyone hallelujah my mind [Music] amen how many are grateful for that word this evening how many are grateful for that word this evening how many want to continue not to go up and down as the sugar goes but to go up and up and up and up and up amen if we if we could all please stand thank you brother morton for that [Applause] he's here all you have to do is raise your hands worship it [Music] [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] allegra [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and when you're up against the struggles that shatters all your dreams and your hopes have been cruelly crushed by satan's magnificent [Music] just [Music] [Music] [Music] and now satan he's a liar and he wants to make
