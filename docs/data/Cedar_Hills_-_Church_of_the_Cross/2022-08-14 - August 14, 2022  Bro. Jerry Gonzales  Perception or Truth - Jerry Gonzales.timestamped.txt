[37:50] and tommy junior and uh i don't know who
[37:52] else is with him
[37:56] just keep him in your prayers as they
[37:57] travel back okay
[38:02] much longer
[38:13] starting with verse two principiando con
[38:15] verso dios
[38:25] and moses called unto all israel and
[38:27] said unto them
[38:29] you have been all that the lord did
[38:31] before you
[38:32] and said unto them ye have seen all that
[38:34] the lord did before your eyes
[38:36] in the land of egypt unto pharaoh and
[38:38] unto all servants and unto all his land
[38:44] israel
[38:58] the great temptations which thine eyes
[39:00] have seen
[39:01] the signs and those great miracles
[39:09] but watch verse 4
[39:11] yet the lord hath not given you one
[39:13] heart to perceive
[39:16] and eyes to see and ears to hear unto
[39:18] this day
[39:46] and it reads
[39:48] i beseech you therefore brethren
[39:50] by the mercies of god that ye present
[39:53] your bodies a living sacrifice
[39:55] holy accessible to god which is your
[39:57] reasonable service
[39:59] yes
[40:08] sacrificial
[40:15] and be not conformed to this world
[40:17] but be transformed by the renewing of
[40:20] your mind
[40:21] that ye may prove remember that word
[40:23] prove what is that
[40:25] is that good and acceptable and perfect
[40:28] will of god
[40:34] transform us
[40:50] blessings to the reading of his word you
[40:51] may be seated
[40:55] again it's good to be in the house of
[40:56] the lord with you
[41:00] to be able to worship and to sing with
[41:02] you
[41:04] to be able to partake of his precious
[41:06] word
[41:07] participate
[41:09] but uh i wanted to bring a little
[41:11] thought this morning
[41:14] and it goes along with an experience
[41:16] that i've had
[41:32] that i've
[41:49] we'll we'll find out what it is
[41:52] yes but so our pastor preached on on a
[41:55] very tremendous subject last week
[42:13] and then so i just started a new job
[42:15] okay
[42:19] it's with a new company it's a new
[42:20] position
[42:22] [Music]
[42:23] and and and this i deal with a lot more
[42:25] people
[42:29] but one of the things i noticed
[42:32] in dealing with a lot more people ian
[42:35] and uh
[42:38] is the different views that different
[42:40] people have
[42:41] no telos diferentes preceptions
[42:44] i noticed that everybody thinks just
[42:46] even just a little bit different
[42:50] different every single person no matter
[42:53] if
[42:53] who they are no important persona they
[42:56] view things a little bit differently
[42:59] so i'm used to working with people that
[43:01] kind of have similar views than i do
[43:10] but in this in this new environment
[43:14] there's there's extreme views on both
[43:16] sides
[43:17] vistas the extremes
[43:20] and this can be
[43:21] any little point
[43:24] but
[43:39] it seems like they're able to prove
[43:40] their points
[43:43] they have a certain perspective of a
[43:45] subject
[43:48] and everybody has facts to back it up
[44:21] truth
[44:23] and i'm kind of like it kind of leaves
[44:24] me a little bit stunned
[44:27] but then i began to give them my facts
[44:33] i began to give them my truth verdad my
[44:35] perception
[44:37] my interpretation of whatever subject me
[44:39] the interpretation
[44:41] and it just seems like we go round and
[44:42] round
[44:46] it's back and forth
[44:48] whether
[44:54] something even a simple like brother
[44:56] william preached one time
[45:00] if you're a sports fan
[45:12] kobe bryant or michael jordan again like
[45:14] i said it's from one spectrum to the
[45:16] other
[45:18] from something so insignificant to
[45:20] something more important
[45:23] even things in in the in the job duties
[45:28] someone always has a better way of doing
[45:43] so it brought me to
[45:45] a thought that i've had entonces
[45:48] that everyone's perception
[45:52] it's a it's a thought that's out there
[45:54] yes
[45:57] everyone's perception is the reality
[46:02] everyone has certain beliefs
[46:06] and everyone sticks to their gun
[46:11] man we ran into that before
[46:15] and that's the question
[46:18] okay
[46:19] the reality is that facts
[46:23] they don't care about perception
[46:26] only important the bottom line is that
[46:28] facts are facts
[46:32] and even though
[46:33] everybody has a certain perception of
[46:35] facts
[46:38] facts are still facts los echos son
[46:41] no matter what
[46:43] what side of the spectrum we're on no
[46:45] important
[46:47] for how we're sitting
[46:49] so that's the things how do you change
[46:51] that and tosses
[46:53] you know that's the thing and i'm going
[46:54] to say this respectfully
[46:59] i don't understand how no entiendo como
[47:02] they want to push
[47:04] the tape ministry
[48:05] different countries differentes
[48:08] are obviously have have had different
[48:10] stimulus in their life
[48:13] estimulos and suvida so everybody's
[48:15] going to think differently
[48:18] everybody's going to formulate an idea
[48:21] an idea for example you're hearing me
[48:24] this morning for example
[48:26] right now your perception of me or
[48:30] me it's going to be different if i ask
[48:31] the sister here
[48:32] different
[48:47] thinking maybe maybe some are thinking
[48:48] yeah i know he's speaking the truth
[48:53] maybe other others are saying not so
[48:55] much
[48:58] so everybody's background plays a part
[48:59] in
[49:48] each individual person that hears a
[49:50] message
[49:52] reads the bible
[49:54] is going to get something different
[49:56] different
[50:10] because we're going to read a scripture
[50:14] and we're going to disagree on it
[50:17] and remember
[50:19] everybody loves to push their agenda
[50:23] everybody is always right
[50:27] more than a brother or yo
[50:29] especially in today's society especially
[50:32] today society is very educated
[50:36] and if they're not educated they have
[50:38] google
[50:53] i eat a youtube i can fix computers
[50:57] i can learn how to public speak
[51:00] you can you can figure out just about
[51:01] anything
[51:04] you can you can it'll help you with your
[51:05] homework levi are you
[51:18] hard to get something across to them
[51:43] [Applause]
[51:49] and the problem is an idea how things
[51:51] should be
[51:52] problematic
[51:55] each individual
[51:56] has his own perception of reality
[52:14] so it's mental impressions of something
[52:16] so
[52:32] let's define the word perception even
[52:33] though we know what it means
[52:39] we're on sunday school right
[52:42] so i know even uh
[52:44] bologna sandwiches are good even when
[52:46] you're hungry right
[52:47] [Music]
[52:50] so just bear with me for a little bit
[52:51] okay
[52:53] i promise we'll get into some good stuff
[52:54] here in a bit
[52:57] it's not what i say knows
[53:24] which means it's flawed from the
[53:26] beginning
[53:38] did you see something from by your eyes
[53:40] see if this alcocos your eyes will
[53:43] deceive you
[53:44] you hear something with your ears
[53:47] it will deceive you
[53:49] right
[53:50] it's a flawed system already
[53:54] incorrect
[54:09] because there's five senses
[54:12] but we have to be driven by that success
[54:16] which is faith
[54:18] which is revelation
[54:20] revolution
[54:22] revelation
[54:50] that
[55:32] it
[55:34] we're going to make it
[55:37] we're going to make it together
[55:39] but not just because you're together in
[55:41] a group
[55:43] but of one mind
[55:45] that's why it's important
[55:47] important to have a pastor
[55:50] the pastor is the head of the church
[55:53] that won't allow all these different
[55:55] perceptions
[55:58] because you'll bring the doctrine to the
[56:00] church
[57:08] this man subjects himself to the holy
[57:10] spirit
[57:17] and then and then the the female part of
[57:18] the wife part subject yourself to the
[57:20] holy spirit also and to the head
[57:50] [Music]
[57:52] and the
[58:05] definition of
[58:06] perception is the ability to see
[58:09] es
[58:11] or become aware of something or they
[58:13] start attento de algo through senses
[58:17] the state of being
[58:19] or process of becoming aware of
[58:27] the other definition of it
[58:31] okay here's some other ones a result of
[58:33] perceiving observation
[59:44] nobody
[59:52] check how you are are you guided by
[59:54] these senses
[59:58] if we are guided by the five senses we
[1:00:00] have a perception of the world so
[1:00:05] but if we're guided by the sixth sense
[1:00:09] by something else
[1:00:12] there's that the control tower
[1:00:16] control the holy spirit inside of you el
[1:00:18] espirito santos moving
[1:00:22] showing you how to be
[1:00:24] telling us how we should be
[1:00:42] the rights of the people
[1:00:45] or the people's perceptions
[1:00:48] the people's views
[1:00:49] vistas
[1:00:50] that's why they come out with all these
[1:00:52] things
[1:01:35] i hear a lot of these different views
[1:01:38] vistas different but one of the most
[1:01:40] outrageous views
[1:01:42] they will not define what a woman is
[1:01:47] the craziest thing is
[1:01:50] what is
[1:01:56] they will not put
[1:01:57] gender pronouns on somebody else
[1:02:02] so one of the big things right now is
[1:02:04] luna las cosas
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:33] they or them entonces
[1:02:36] i'm like that's that's strange to me
[1:02:41] it's not even good grammar
[1:02:43] grammatical a singular person una
[1:02:46] persona singular
[1:03:14] following me okay
[1:03:16] before he said unto him come out of the
[1:03:18] man that one clean spirit
[1:03:22] actually
[1:03:23] um that was late i'm sorry
[1:03:26] i didn't i didn't give you this yeah hey
[1:03:28] that this is 9. and and i'll read 9. and
[1:03:30] he asked him what is thy name
[1:03:33] and he and he answered saying my name is
[1:03:35] legion for we are many.
[1:03:46] you see how the singular person vest
[1:03:48] is singular you see that spirit today
[1:03:52] he referred to himself
[1:03:55] in a plural
[1:03:56] sentence
[1:03:58] and i'll read this just because you're
[1:04:00] going to need this later
[1:04:04] and then verse 10 and he besought him
[1:04:06] much that he would not
[1:04:07] send them away out of the country
[1:04:10] yes
[1:04:17] unto the mountains a great herd of swine
[1:04:19] feeding
[1:04:24] established and all the devils we sought
[1:04:27] him saying send us into the swine that
[1:04:30] we may enter into them
[1:04:53] la sistema it's the spirit sl
[1:04:56] that's that's what we're after yes
[1:04:59] never after a person
[1:05:01] people are precious
[1:05:04] everybody has the right to hear the word
[1:05:21] went off the cliff and went into the
[1:05:22] water
[1:05:25] you know if you know your symbols in the
[1:05:26] bible you see
[1:05:28] symbols
[1:05:29] one of the symbols of water means people
[1:05:31] under the symbols
[1:05:34] so remember scripture has compound
[1:05:36] meaning
[1:05:39] it's not a history book no esun
[1:05:42] when you read the scriptures
[1:05:45] number one you better see jesus in every
[1:05:46] single daughter title number
[1:06:30] so
[1:06:32] the just the craziest thing i mean just
[1:06:34] the ideas
[1:06:38] so a woman now is not a woman
[1:06:42] so now it's a child bearing person
[1:07:40] a he's a jewish person yes yes
[1:07:44] and he's a sharp guy yes
[1:07:47] he means more to the conservative side
[1:07:51] conservatives but i'd like to hear him
[1:07:53] speak
[1:08:03] he says why are they taking the
[1:08:04] superpower away from the woman
[1:08:23] about that
[1:08:24] so i started to think now in this in a
[1:08:26] spiritual sense
[1:08:30] so what happens
[1:08:33] now when they try to do that in the
[1:08:35] church
[1:08:50] to be able to bring and assist the new
[1:08:52] birth
[1:08:55] well they try to do that
[1:08:58] the natural types of spiritual natural
[1:09:00] typical spiritual many times things that
[1:09:03] happen in the natural muchas versus la
[1:09:04] cosas
[1:09:58] a man
[1:10:02] me see where i'm at here
[1:10:04] oh where am i at
[1:10:07] half an hour okay all right
[1:10:09] a little bit of time
[1:10:11] all right
[1:10:12] so
[1:10:13] young people
[1:10:28] like i said i know we're in a mixed
[1:10:29] audience
[1:10:33] but there's certain things this is what
[1:10:34] we always tell you but
[1:10:37] you don't want to do certain things
[1:10:41] you don't want to go out into the world
[1:10:42] and find
[1:11:24] that's not supposed to almost
[1:11:28] what happened
[1:11:29] he marks the cell in your memory
[1:11:33] he burns a file in your mind
[1:11:37] so now say years later i owned another
[1:11:40] quest okay now i'm going to go to church
[1:11:41] and i'm going to serve god
[1:11:44] i'm going to get married i'm going to do
[1:11:45] this
[1:11:47] but all of a sudden you're at the store
[1:11:50] and a song comes out you started
[1:12:06] i
[1:12:19] and keep you from obtaining that birth
[1:12:21] that you need
[1:12:24] that's how he holds you back
[1:12:27] you'll say it's okay to go to church
[1:12:31] but remember what you did
[1:12:33] remember the duck
[1:13:30] it was the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:13:32] evil
[1:13:35] that was good
[1:13:54] you brought a certain understanding
[1:15:22] a little bit
[1:15:24] so how do we how do we get rid of this
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:29] watch this
[1:15:32] the right mental attitude towards god
[1:15:51] when i look at brother abraham
[1:15:54] maybe i have a certain perspective of
[1:15:55] him
[1:15:57] but if i look at her now through the
[1:15:59] lens of the word
[1:16:02] that's not brother abraham
[1:16:04] that's the son
[1:16:18] i'm not speaking to nobody
[1:16:48] remember that's the goal
[1:16:50] the goal is to save the people
[1:16:54] to help the people
[1:16:57] what does our pastor always say
[1:17:15] to just show that he knows this or that
[1:17:16] hermanos
[1:17:20] don't let those emotional drivers
[1:17:26] mold you into something else
[1:17:28] because
[1:17:42] i'll get to my point here because i
[1:17:44] i don't want to run out of time
[1:17:46] just a little text
[1:17:47] if i could call it that um
[1:17:51] i want to speak for a moment
[1:17:53] of uh of two
[1:17:55] a moment or two on the word expectation
[1:18:01] we always get what we expect expectiva
[1:18:04] we always get what we expect
[1:18:24] maybe there's a bit of a hatred there
[1:18:26] for someone you don't even know why
[1:18:32] you're going to you expect that that's
[1:18:33] what you're going to get
[1:18:36] i expect that that's what i'm going to
[1:18:38] get is
[1:18:52] get what you look for entonces
[1:18:56] the mental attitude that you have
[1:19:00] remember this all right
[1:19:03] it's uh sorry brothers i forgot to tell
[1:19:05] you it's the
[1:19:06] quote and expectation so they can follow
[1:19:07] along
[1:19:12] you say when it says remember remember
[1:19:14] this
[1:19:16] and never forget it
[1:19:18] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:19:20] promise of god
[1:20:02] how does attitude effect
[1:20:07] watch this simply a perception
[1:20:10] attitude
[1:20:13] which by expectation
[1:20:16] expectation triggers certain reactions
[1:20:22] information received by a person
[1:20:24] information received a person any of the
[1:20:26] human senses
[1:20:29] stimulates sensations sensation which he
[1:20:33] or she
[1:20:36] interprets to generate an understanding
[1:20:40] it all depends on what we see today
[1:20:44] it all depends on what we want to see
[1:20:48] attitude
[1:20:51] towards the person
[1:20:58] now we say we're going to spend eternity
[1:21:00] eternity together
[1:21:07] can we say that with a straight face
[1:21:12] recta well it's hard brother he or she
[1:21:15] did this to me
[1:21:20] through the five senses
[1:21:23] and remember that system is
[1:22:08] from the beginning the principle is
[1:22:11] torsido watch this article and i'll read
[1:22:13] it really fast
[1:22:15] young people i want you to hear this
[1:22:17] okay
[1:22:19] this is just a person and i found it
[1:22:20] interesting is
[1:22:23] interesting not paraphrasing here so i
[1:22:25] don't know if this is true for everyone
[1:22:28] for me when i'm having a bad day
[1:22:32] sometimes i focus on on on everything
[1:22:34] that's bad
[1:22:35] muchas versus
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:11] and when this happens he says it's a
[1:23:13] terrible thing
[1:23:16] i could be having a great day
[1:24:00] watch your
[1:24:26] and certain situations in my outlook
[1:24:43] chronic headaches
[1:24:46] insomnia insomnia anxiety
[1:24:49] you know that anxiety is a killer
[1:24:52] anxiety
[1:24:54] anxiety is affects many people today
[1:25:01] and
[1:25:02] last night like i said you talk about
[1:25:05] maybe this is why
[1:25:06] yeah i had an issue last night
[1:25:10] and i felt anxiety
[1:25:13] i'm not an anxious person
[1:25:15] i think a lot yo
[1:25:17] but i try not to let the anxiety the you
[1:25:19] know the tapping you ever seen
[1:25:24] you see people clinching their jaws
[1:25:27] moving
[1:25:29] anxious
[1:25:30] i'm worried about someone
[1:25:33] oh my god this is going to happen
[1:25:36] even things we have no control
[1:25:38] no need to
[1:25:52] one
[1:26:02] you ever come and you tell a young
[1:26:03] person something on the outside
[1:26:20] so the pastor gave us the formula
[1:26:24] formula he says so this person goes on
[1:26:27] in the article
[1:26:31] the first step in changing your
[1:26:32] perception imagining who you want to be
[1:26:34] el prime
[1:27:00] if i had the power to flip my life into
[1:27:02] chaos
[1:27:30] is
[1:27:43] and what the depression
[1:28:12] young
[1:28:40] yeah i see but he let me feel that for a
[1:28:43] reason
[1:28:51] not with not on our watch
[1:28:54] the message of the
[1:30:18] uh
[1:30:48] called illusory truth effect
[1:30:53] an illusory truth effect
[1:31:01] is that what that does
[1:31:03] or what that is
[1:31:05] is it's a it's a tactic it's used
[1:31:09] by marketers today
[1:31:14] and what it is is he constantly bombards
[1:31:17] you with information
[1:31:20] information maybe
[1:31:22] it's even false
[1:31:25] but what illusory truth effect does
[1:31:27] is
[1:31:41] i have the tendency to side with it now
[1:32:24] he actually gave pastor gave the formula
[1:32:30] take the recipe
[1:32:32] we just have to apply it
[1:32:35] for me to hear it
[1:32:38] but i have to apply
[1:32:52] said
[1:32:56] if you have that thought
[1:32:58] just because it was for you
[1:33:04] so it's the two extremes in the country
[1:33:06] that brings
[1:33:25] excuse me
[1:33:33] i'll get to my last part
[1:33:34] here so what is it to remain if we
[1:33:37] remain
[1:33:39] with our own perception yes
[1:33:47] this is an example
[1:33:50] of scriptures
[1:33:53] they're not stories
[1:33:55] they're here for our benefits
[1:34:02] watch this thought it's just an angle
[1:34:04] okay
[1:34:06] there was a there was an abomination
[1:34:08] done in the times of daniels
[1:34:14] in 168 bc
[1:34:31] he marched into the jewish temple
[1:34:34] he erected a statue of zeus
[1:34:38] watch the abomination
[1:34:43] just means something disgusting
[1:35:06] historians say that's that was the
[1:35:08] fulfillment of daniel 9 27. it is
[1:35:22] my goodness
[1:35:24] so i i think of that and i'm like wow
[1:35:26] what a what a story huh
[1:35:39] as the fulfillment of daniel
[1:35:46] says and he and he shall confirm the
[1:35:48] covenant with many for one week
[1:35:54] in the midst of the week
[1:35:56] he shall cause the sacrifice
[1:35:59] and the oblation to cease
[1:36:02] and for the overspreading of abomination
[1:36:08] he shall make it desolate
[1:36:11] even until the confirmation
[1:36:15] and that determines shall be poured upon
[1:36:16] the desolate yes
[1:36:20] so i started to think oh my my goodness
[1:36:22] fiancee
[1:36:24] he sacrificed the pig in god's altar
[1:36:26] sacrifice
[1:36:29] in the temple of god
[1:36:32] brought me to something
[1:36:34] and it says first corinthians 3 16
[1:36:36] primer de corinthios
[1:36:39] 3 16
[1:36:49] and it reads
[1:36:50] know ye not the ye are the temple of god
[1:36:54] and that the spirit of god dwelleth in
[1:36:56] you
[1:37:00] if any man defile the temple of god
[1:37:03] him shall god destroy for the temple of
[1:37:05] god is holy which temple
[1:37:11] is
[1:37:23] follow me here okay
[1:37:25] we are the temple of god
[1:37:27] so it is imperative to be born again
[1:37:32] why
[1:37:46] serve the lord cerebral preach the
[1:37:48] gospel
[1:37:49] go out and do the same thing again or
[1:37:51] whatever whatever
[1:37:52] issue
[1:37:56] again
[1:37:59] and then go back out and do the same
[1:38:00] thing
[1:38:02] what does brother brandon say about a
[1:38:03] pig
[1:38:09] faith without works is dead
[1:38:13] can you imagine taking a hug from its
[1:38:15] wallow this is the word hog
[1:38:21] you could take a hog out here
[1:38:24] and bring this hog in it
[1:38:27] scrub it with salt soda
[1:38:30] whatever you wanted to do
[1:38:34] do that painting of her toenails
[1:38:37] like women do on their fingers
[1:38:41] and mix up with he makes carlos with
[1:38:43] with clothes
[1:38:46] put it on a hardwood floor
[1:38:50] give it grape nuts
[1:38:54] and that hog would die
[1:38:56] yes
[1:39:08] [Music]
[1:39:10] could go
[1:39:24] i'm not calling
[1:39:39] whatever nature calls
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:43] the nature that's inside of us
[1:39:46] what are we doing
[1:39:47] we're bringing a sacrifice
[1:41:03] do you think he has you young people
[1:41:04] sitting up in the front for nothing
[1:41:08] preparations are being made
[1:41:12] without their new birth
[1:41:14] changing of a nation
[1:41:16] we're
[1:41:58] otherwise
[1:42:11] that will bring us to what's called the
[1:42:13] cup of iniquity yes
[1:42:16] filling up that cup
[1:42:19] with inequity
[1:42:20] what is inequity yes
[1:42:22] to know that something's wrong and
[1:42:23] continue doing it
[1:42:39] sometimes we feel like it's those giants
[1:42:41] right
[1:42:46] watch this and i'll finish with this
[1:42:49] the amorites
[1:42:51] because he says the cup of the gentiles
[1:43:22] the amorites were known los amores
[1:43:26] and if the musicians want to come up um
[1:43:30] they were known as the lord of the
[1:43:32] mountains
[1:43:36] they were known
[1:43:38] for being in the mountains
[1:43:47] they were known for those
[1:44:03] it's a giant to somebody that's dealing
[1:44:05] with it
[1:44:08] depression is a giant depression
[1:44:11] maybe a person has a certain issue with
[1:44:13] something
[1:44:16] that's a giant in their life
[1:44:30] el camino
[1:44:34] does it do
[1:44:36] what keeps us from climbing
[1:44:41] of a statue
[1:44:45] of a perfect man
[1:45:01] we can finish up here
[1:45:03] watch brother branham or not hermano
[1:45:05] branham god talk to moses
