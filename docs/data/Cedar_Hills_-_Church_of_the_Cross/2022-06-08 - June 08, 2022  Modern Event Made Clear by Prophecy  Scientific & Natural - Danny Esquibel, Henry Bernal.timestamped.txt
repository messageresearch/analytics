[24:01] [Music]
[24:17] lord has done
[24:20] [Music]
[24:38] the lord
[24:44] [Music]
[24:48] is
[24:53] [Applause]
[24:54] [Music]
[25:04] oh
[25:09] [Music]
[25:17] is
[25:20] [Music]
[25:50] uh
[26:18] as we've been
[26:19] talking on
[26:20] modern events made clear by prophecy
[26:28] uh
[26:29] it was our part to talk about the
[26:31] scientific nostoka diablo
[26:34] a natural heavens open the
[26:54] [Music]
[27:19] for the lord says
[27:23] and there shall be signs in the sun
[27:25] and in the moon and in the stars and
[27:27] upon the earth the stress of nations
[27:30] with perspective perplexity
[27:32] the
[27:50] men's heart failing them for fear
[27:53] and for looking after those things which
[27:55] are coming on the earth for the powers
[27:57] of heaven shall be shaken
[28:13] [Music]
[28:19] [Music]
[28:30] all right god bless each and every one
[28:31] of you
[28:34] so
[28:36] it fell on our lot to
[28:38] speak on these subjects and say is
[28:44] and uh
[28:45] so i i kind of started you know
[28:47] kind of going through it a little bit
[28:52] and i kind of just didn't really
[28:53] understand like you know just talking
[28:55] about
[28:56] nature
[29:09] right so then you start thinking about
[29:11] nature and just the things that are
[29:13] natural things going on
[29:18] and so i really didn't know what or
[29:20] where to start
[29:24] but then the holy spirit came
[29:28] to santo and as he opened it up
[29:34] it's nothing like what you think
[29:38] right so we just read right now in the
[29:40] scripture
[29:43] that uh
[29:44] there would be signs right
[29:48] and so we heard last wednesday uh
[29:50] tremendous by brother abraham
[29:52] is
[30:01] and so
[30:02] um
[30:03] we see here that as the scripture says
[30:05] that men's hearts are failing for fear
[30:12] and we found out sunday in controversy
[30:15] domingo right that fear
[30:20] um
[30:21] what would cause fear
[30:24] right
[30:26] well the bible says as we heard on
[30:27] sunday
[30:30] domingo that my people perish for the
[30:32] lack of knowledge
[30:36] right so for the fact of
[30:39] knowledge
[30:43] right you you become very fearful if you
[30:45] don't have the knowledge of what
[30:46] something's going to be you're you're
[30:47] very fearful
[31:03] in the message
[31:06] the knowledge is there
[31:09] our founding pastor says many people
[31:11] have fear of death
[31:16] they're so fearful they're scared
[31:19] of biting their nails
[31:22] pulling their hair out
[31:24] destroying themselves
[31:27] why okay for the lack of knowledge
[31:55] right and so
[31:56] that's the key is
[32:13] if you go into politics it's a it's a
[32:14] fight between two two
[32:17] opposing
[32:18] um
[32:20] yeah opposing um
[32:23] ideologies or
[32:25] political stances
[32:43] and they accuse the other side of
[32:45] being against science
[32:49] yeah and then so the other side says
[32:53] it's um
[32:55] is propaganda
[32:56] and politically
[32:58] based established in the political
[33:00] scientific science
[33:02] the sense yeah okay so the great debate
[33:05] is whether global warming is true
[33:30] so they're trying to suppress those
[33:32] they're trying to do away with those
[33:33] things
[33:36] when the other site says is this how can
[33:38] this be man-made
[33:43] so the element that they're missing
[33:51] well they they i mean is the earth
[33:52] heating up
[33:56] right
[33:57] is it g oh brother brown says and
[33:59] motherboard
[34:00] how old is uh global warming then
[34:17] it was nothing but a big ball of water
[34:32] went off like that and moved into space
[34:36] the millions below zero immigrants
[34:40] it formed moisture
[34:44] so
[34:45] the heat from the sun began to to melt
[34:48] off or heat the earth
[34:53] so then global warming was from the
[34:55] beginning
[35:00] so it ran in perfect harmony
[35:04] right it was in god's plan
[35:07] but then because of the interruption of
[35:09] nature
[35:12] because of sin
[35:57] well that's natural eso is natural right
[36:00] so
[36:01] what's causing all these fires
[36:05] right so some scientists say algunos
[36:08] decent that just the heat of the earth
[36:13] right
[36:14] and so the earth has gotten so hot
[36:18] right and so what causes natural fires
[36:35] they planned these like some of these
[36:36] fires were prescribed fire yeah
[36:41] but what the scientists or
[36:42] meteorologists didn't realize
[36:48] and couldn't predict
[36:52] was
[36:55] right and so what causes wind
[37:00] right it's it's caused by the barometric
[37:03] heat it is a color barometric
[37:13] right and and it causes
[37:16] more unusual wind than what you normally
[37:18] see
[37:20] abnormalities
[37:24] so that was one thing that they didn't
[37:26] um
[37:27] foresee
[37:31] and then there's also um
[37:33] um natural
[37:57] right and so
[37:58] so i was like well what is having fires
[38:00] what is fires
[38:02] enthusiasm
[38:44] we live in such a watered down society
[38:51] that you can't even speak the truth
[38:56] without them blowing up
[39:30] was did you start it by arson on your
[39:33] own
[39:38] how did this forest fire start inside of
[39:40] you
[39:43] now what are these forest fires
[39:47] what are these fires that have been
[39:48] started
[39:51] so just as a little side note is
[39:57] so
[39:57] these fires not only of these forest
[40:00] fires going on
[40:05] since january of this year
[40:08] i'm not going to go
[40:21] 21
[40:23] food processing plants
[40:30] in the u.s
[40:32] now how coincidental is i mean is it
[40:35] just
[40:37] and if coincidence
[40:37] went through the list
[40:40] they're meat packing
[40:42] meat packing processing plate facilities
[40:47] poultry
[40:50] las
[41:19] okay so
[41:20] so then now so we start to find out back
[41:22] to the spiritual part
[41:26] what are these fires
[41:29] can you read it brother julian
[41:32] it's going to be in uh ephesians first
[41:34] we'll go to ephesians 1
[41:37] 431
[41:40] 431
[41:42] it says
[41:44] little bitter bitterness oh bitterness
[41:48] that's a forest fire
[41:50] it says it's in the u.s
[41:53] wrath
[41:55] and anger
[41:57] anger how many here get angry
[42:00] oh okay go ahead and clamor
[42:04] glamour and evil speaking
[42:07] evil speaking wow
[42:10] be put away from you with all melees
[42:13] okay
[42:24] so these fires have ignited inside of us
[42:27] entonces
[42:31] right this is what caused a lot of fires
[42:33] to go on in the in the in the people
[42:38] bitterness
[42:41] anger
[42:56] what we listen
[43:08] okay so let me go ahead and read first
[43:11] corinthians then
[43:13] into first corinthians
[43:16] chapter 7
[43:19] 8 and 9.
[43:21] and i say therefore to the unmarried and
[43:24] widows
[43:25] is good it is good for them if they
[43:28] abide as i as
[43:30] even as i dico
[43:32] los solteros
[43:37] fuera que darse
[43:40] but if they cannot contain
[43:42] let them
[43:43] marry for it is better to marry than to
[43:46] burn but
[44:17] no but the very word married
[44:20] casado
[44:47] to have a fire burning inside of you
[44:53] and what is this what is this burning
[44:57] passion
[45:02] desire and the sails for the things of
[45:04] the world
[45:06] for the world system
[45:09] what's going on in the world
[45:12] right and those fires begin to burn
[45:13] inside of us
[45:17] and then the wind of doctrine that we
[45:18] listen to logo
[45:21] that's going to determine how big that
[45:23] fire gets inside of it
[45:28] so we have all these fires that are
[45:29] burning
[45:50] and what is it it is there are these
[45:52] these fires that have been burning
[45:54] inside of us
[45:57] because we don't marry ourselves to the
[45:58] word of god
[46:01] because we're not married to him
[46:04] we haven't given ourselves to him
[46:08] he hasn't become our lord
[46:12] these fires are burning with inside of
[46:14] us
[46:16] you begin to
[46:17] become destroyed
[46:20] because of lack of knowledge
[46:23] because of the lack of of joining
[46:26] yourself to the lord
[46:39] right
[46:40] we think that god's going to just
[46:42] wave some kind of wand over us
[46:48] and he's going to put out these fires
[46:51] he's going to be the fire extinguisher
[46:56] but what does he say
[46:58] what does first peter tell us
[47:02] peter 2 1. says
[47:05] where for lane aside all malice oh wait
[47:08] wait laying aside
[47:11] right so that's something that you got
[47:12] to do
[47:15] you got to lay it aside
[47:18] an old guy
[47:19] and hypocrisy and envy and all evil
[47:22] speakings
[47:28] so you got to rid those cell things out
[47:30] of out of yourself
[47:35] you got a work to do
[47:39] god's not going to wave a wand over you
[47:44] the only thing god's going to do
[47:47] is he's going to give you his word
[47:50] and then you gotta conform yourself to
[47:52] that word
[47:56] right so if you have a forest fire of of
[47:58] lust burning in science
[48:04] then the word of god says
[48:07] through a prophet
[48:11] turn your head
[48:15] that's the remedy
[48:18] oh god
[48:31] right if you have a problem in your life
[48:35] women they say oh well this is always
[48:37] following me or this is after me
[48:41] conform yourself to the word
[48:44] the word tells you how you should act
[48:46] and dress
[48:59] because god has placed in the church
[49:03] he has placed a spiritual husband
[49:07] but what happens to people
[49:10] they go around everywhere else
[49:55] the things of the world the natural
[50:11] okay so it signifies these three
[50:13] different things significa
[50:17] so when the world is falling apart
[50:21] what's it talking about the cosmos
[50:23] established cosmos is it talking about
[50:26] the planet
[50:28] or is it talking about the human being
[50:31] that's why in the message that our
[50:33] pastor has been preaching
[50:37] and the message of our founding pastor
[50:53] what are you referring to
[50:55] are you referring to the end time
[50:58] to the end of the world
[51:00] to the times of
[51:02] of of trouble
[51:07] so because they're they're they're all
[51:08] different they're they're different
[51:10] events
[51:12] different so if the world's falling
[51:13] apart
[51:16] right let's find out what falling means
[51:18] to fall down
[51:35] okay so then our pastor our founding
[51:37] pastor gives us illustrations
[51:41] it's him and brother abraham and brother
[51:43] abraham's interpreting him
[51:46] so so say we're walking together
[52:03] me
[52:04] he just fell out of his place
[52:09] his world fell apart
[52:12] right
[52:13] so right away that
[52:15] sends to my mind
[52:23] right and unless you've
[52:24] solely committed yourself to god
[52:29] right
[52:31] these fires that are inside of us
[52:34] are gonna continue to burn wanna
[52:36] continue
[52:38] we think like god's gonna just magically
[52:40] fix our marriage
[52:57] going to sprinkle some magic dust on
[52:59] your waist
[53:03] no you have a job to do
[53:06] right you must read yourself of if
[53:08] you're jealous
[53:11] you gotta rid yourself of them and what
[53:14] is the reason that we don't get
[53:16] ourselves don't rid ourselves of those
[53:21] too much tv
[53:22] television
[53:24] too much concert mucho
[53:40] sometimes we're sick
[53:43] and and and it's it's because of where
[53:45] what the things that we do
[53:48] the places that we we visit
[53:52] and then we imagine we automatically
[53:54] think i expect god to rid off of those
[53:56] sicknesses
[54:02] the fires of depression
[54:05] why is it today
[54:08] we got so much
[54:10] word
[54:13] right so much worship
[54:16] and yes so much depression
[54:21] huh
[54:22] why but it can because there's two
[54:24] forces that work in this world
[54:28] and it's good and evil
[54:31] [Music]
[54:32] right so
[54:34] man this gets really it gets deeper and
[54:36] deeper it says
[54:38] but how many know what the difference is
[54:39] between black magic
[54:45] because we're dealing with we're dealing
[54:46] with demonology
[54:50] all these things that you see going on
[54:52] out here are demons
[54:56] right and brother branham even says that
[54:58] some of these things that are caused
[54:59] these earthquakes and and all these
[55:00] things
[55:04] are caused by
[55:08] what's the difference between black
[55:10] magic and white magic
[55:14] right
[55:16] okay so black magic is used for evil
[55:32] is right it hides itself says
[55:36] right so it uses a lot of christianity
[55:40] it uses a lot of christian words
[55:43] christianos right it uses a lot of
[55:45] christian lyrics
[55:59] if i got up here and said anything
[56:01] contrary to this
[56:05] anything contrary to brother branham
[56:08] anything contrary to our founding
[56:09] pastors
[56:11] anything contrary to what our pastor has
[56:13] said yeah
[56:28] so
[56:42] feet to the
[57:26] a lot of them are our
[57:28] trinity doctors
[57:31] right
[57:32] they're trinity doctrine
[57:35] so what happened to the old song que
[57:38] paso con los
[57:52] or what happened to uh is there's a
[57:54] fountain flowing dripping with blood
[58:00] oh those are old-fashioned
[58:02] then perish in your own knowledge then
[58:05] entrances perez
[58:19] the angel of the lord has loved only
[58:34] rather you get married
[58:38] it's better for you to marry
[58:40] me
[58:42] so marry yourself to the word
[58:46] let's conform ourselves to the words
[59:30] it draws you closer closer to him
[59:34] it draws you to him
[59:37] so in closing yes
[59:39] um
[59:41] we need to find out
[59:44] that
[59:45] okay
[59:46] it's time for us to conform ourselves to
[59:48] god's word
[59:52] right there's no reason to be fearful
[59:56] the things that are going on
[1:00:11] was that you should not perish
[1:00:56] you bring to us a message
[1:00:58] and that message yesterday
[1:01:00] is the fire extinguisher
[1:01:05] and i'll turn it over to brother henry
[1:01:10] [Applause]
[1:01:19] amen i've been
[1:01:21] how many love that
[1:01:48] and whatever you think you got somewhere
[1:02:17] and they have they're under our command
[1:02:20] and their purpose is to fulfill the word
[1:02:22] of god
[1:02:25] and and that's that's the beauty of it
[1:02:29] uh
[1:02:30] talk about fires
[1:02:46] i had a little fellowship with him
[1:02:51] and we were talking about this thing
[1:02:54] that uh for uh for a fire
[1:02:57] to naturally take place
[1:03:09] or how they determine how they want to
[1:03:11] do a prescribed fire it comes
[1:03:17] which we understand that there's a lot
[1:03:19] of seeds in the woods that need heat
[1:03:23] in in bosque
[1:03:28] to
[1:03:28] burst there's some kinds of pine tree
[1:03:32] that if if the seed doesn't get so hot
[1:03:35] it doesn't come out
[1:03:41] that doesn't mean
[1:03:57] see what comes out
[1:04:00] of me was going to come out
[1:04:03] just a bad piece of charcoal
[1:04:08] but naturally
[1:04:10] there is there is there are some seeds i
[1:04:13] see me and this uh of certain pine trees
[1:04:15] that require
[1:04:17] spinos
[1:04:19] so nature
[1:04:22] uh during the during this time of the
[1:04:24] year
[1:04:26] what we know as monsoons
[1:04:30] when the rains come
[1:04:32] in
[1:04:33] that's when the fire starts
[1:04:36] keep this in mind
[1:04:38] because we haven't had a rainy season
[1:04:43] we have more fires
[1:04:46] nationwide
[1:04:49] worldwide
[1:04:51] how many
[1:05:08] it has them so worried that they're
[1:05:10] seeking the lord now
[1:05:14] so
[1:05:15] how they prescribe a fire come on
[1:05:20] they said okay okay in this region right
[1:05:22] here
[1:05:25] we haven't had a natural fire in so long
[1:05:32] so we need to burn this area right here
[1:05:34] we're gonna mark it and we're going to
[1:05:35] come back
[1:05:39] to allow that seed to burst
[1:05:44] so naturally
[1:05:48] there has to be some elements for there
[1:05:50] to be a fire in the in the in the forest
[1:05:56] and and that is of course the
[1:05:58] drought
[1:06:02] but then there's also there also has to
[1:06:04] be some humidity
[1:06:07] that the rain brings
[1:06:09] right and and a lot of times brings
[1:06:12] enough uh dude that um
[1:06:14] uh the dew drops come to us
[1:06:23] if the same amount if the the right
[1:06:25] amount of drought and the right amount
[1:06:27] of of humidity is in the area
[1:06:45] waiting for the reigning seasons to see
[1:06:47] how they're going to handle the fire
[1:06:48] esperanto
[1:06:52] and then they look behind them
[1:06:56] where there's none of these elements
[1:07:13] and then that mountain just burst up in
[1:07:15] f in flames
[1:07:19] so what they're looking here how to
[1:07:21] handle that fire
[1:07:25] behind them pirates are
[1:07:39] but they are starting without those but
[1:07:42] elements and that is because the crust
[1:07:45] of the earth is so hot yes
[1:07:49] we we call it as for the only red at the
[1:07:52] global warming commodity
[1:08:35] and this harmony was just perfect yes
[1:08:39] as we know when sin came in
[1:08:44] he broke the harmony
[1:08:47] everything
[1:08:48] was broken
[1:09:02] but he never lost its relationship with
[1:09:04] the lord
[1:09:24] and try to
[1:09:25] explain one thing or the other okay
[1:09:30] and brother branham says that in this
[1:09:32] they think they know better
[1:09:37] but it's not so
[1:09:40] the earth knows better
[1:09:42] he never lost his relationship with his
[1:09:44] mate
[1:10:04] and those are things that we we don't
[1:10:06] consider as much eso
[1:10:10] no wonder why the scripture says
[1:10:13] the god will destroy
[1:10:16] those that destroyed europe
[1:10:20] so all these things happening
[1:10:24] when they do fracking
[1:10:29] they're breaking they're messing with
[1:10:31] the fountains of the deep stun
[1:10:36] they get water out of the deep
[1:10:40] they want to put it back in
[1:10:56] tell you what if you ever want to know
[1:10:58] for sure
[1:11:02] how hot
[1:11:03] the earth is underneath
[1:11:06] take a cruise by
[1:11:08] the yellowstone national park
[1:11:36] there was a book that we were looking at
[1:11:37] with my dad yeah
[1:12:01] i
[1:12:02] had a documentary
[1:12:04] a documentary it's called new mexico it
[1:12:07] is
[1:12:08] mexico the land of sacred fires
[1:12:14] because new mexico
[1:12:16] mexico has one of the youngest volcanic
[1:12:19] activity in the united states it didn't
[1:12:39] that i don't know if you how many how
[1:12:40] many are locals from las cruces
[1:12:45] all right
[1:12:46] i would say that everybody because we're
[1:12:48] here in las cruces
[1:12:51] how many here know the place called
[1:12:53] kilburn hall
[1:12:56] kilburn hall
[1:13:00] it's a minority but there's some there's
[1:13:02] i
[1:13:16] energy suspicion
[1:13:20] and and and uh
[1:13:23] volcanic power it will produce
[1:13:26] that if that was to go off
[1:13:45] i agree to that you study
[1:13:48] because the closing statement of that
[1:13:50] scientist that did that study
[1:13:56] he said we know it's going to go off
[1:14:16] and just like that all over the united
[1:14:18] states and the world yes
[1:14:23] but this is just the earthly stuff
[1:14:50] you know rain is born
[1:14:53] rain is born in a jagged rugged lining
[1:14:56] stroud la you guys
[1:15:04] thunder is skies
[1:15:08] and if we didn't have rain we wouldn't
[1:15:10] leave
[1:15:11] isis
[1:15:14] but you see what it takes to bring rain
[1:15:17] best location
[1:15:20] thunder
[1:15:21] renos
[1:16:04] that's
[1:16:33] all this anger
[1:16:35] yeah
[1:16:37] that the company is fired
[1:16:42] and we need it
[1:16:45] um
[1:16:46] the scripture says
[1:16:49] in in in the books that we've been
[1:16:51] reading the book of luke
[1:16:54] lucas but also reads in the book of acts
[1:17:01] right after
[1:17:02] the pentecostal experience
[1:17:06] of pentecostal people was wondering
[1:17:09] what's going on with this bunch of
[1:17:11] crazies here
[1:17:12] questions
[1:17:16] are they drunk so early in the day
[1:17:21] so in the book of acts chapter two
[1:17:23] echoes capitals
[1:17:31] verse 16. mercedes he says
[1:17:34] but this is that which was spoken by the
[1:17:36] prophet joel
[1:17:42] foreign the lord
[1:17:46] i will pour out of my spirit upon all
[1:17:48] flesh and your sons and your daughters
[1:17:49] shall prophesied and your young man
[1:17:51] shall see visions and your old men shall
[1:17:52] dream dreams
[1:18:08] in heaven above
[1:18:10] and signs in the earth beneath
[1:18:12] blood and fire and vapor of smoke
[1:18:22] not only in the new testament it is said
[1:18:52] during that time
[1:18:56] as we understand uh
[1:18:59] they were
[1:19:00] in in prison they were really uh
[1:19:03] slavery established
[1:19:05] incarcerated in
[1:19:09] and
[1:19:11] the lord was
[1:19:13] was
[1:19:14] talking through brother branham the
[1:19:15] other day
[1:19:20] speaking of of those days
[1:19:22] diaz what the lord had to do look at
[1:19:25] senor tucker said just to descend and
[1:19:27] take care of business here on earth
[1:19:48] i am babylonia and brother branham says
[1:19:51] i don't want to run on this if you can
[1:19:53] if you can
[1:19:56] just if you can read uh
[1:19:58] just uh
[1:20:00] this second quote
[1:20:02] yeah that one
[1:20:06] i can i can hear him say
[1:20:10] woodworm
[1:20:11] you can do it
[1:20:14] that's right but i can i can't let you
[1:20:31] i can see him reach over there and say
[1:20:37] come here
[1:20:38] to a big thunderhead
[1:20:41] hanging back yonder
[1:20:42] venga come on
[1:21:12] i'm going to drive you like horses
[1:21:17] i'm going to set you on this thunderhead
[1:21:23] this morning
[1:21:24] like a chariot
[1:21:26] i'm
[1:21:39] and crack it across the skies
[1:21:51] we could keep reading but i'm just gonna
[1:21:53] because of time's sake i'm gonna
[1:22:04] do you really think he was just trying
[1:22:05] to illustrate a good drama oh okay yeah
[1:22:11] there is no making up when it comes to
[1:22:13] the word of the lord
[1:22:18] you really
[1:22:20] can you see that
[1:22:23] that
[1:22:24] the heavens obey him
[1:22:28] when he called that and then there's
[1:22:29] another place where he's with michael
[1:22:31] wanting to come down
[1:22:35] and he told him the same thing he
[1:22:37] macosa so michael you have obey me since
[1:22:39] the day i created you miguel
[1:22:43] i can't let you go because i'm go i'm
[1:22:45] going myself
[1:22:48] this is a man-sized job
[1:23:04] intends no not to learn it takes
[1:23:06] something natural
[1:23:09] to manifest the supernatural
[1:23:12] all they know is the heavenly father
[1:23:16] but they don't know this part
[1:23:32] over there in the north
[1:23:36] i can see great big white thunderhead
[1:23:39] you know
[1:23:40] like hear him say come here
[1:23:44] everything in heaven obeys him
[1:24:14] chariot
[1:24:17] reach up get hold of a zigzag lining
[1:24:22] out of the skies
[1:24:24] and crack it across the sky
[1:24:48] was he making that story is established
[1:24:52] or what he's talking about things that
[1:24:53] we just don't see
[1:25:39] you know how much supernatural things
[1:25:40] take place before us
[1:25:42] all day long
[1:25:51] because we're too busy
[1:25:58] all those useless things that don't
[1:26:00] bring us anywhere yeah
[1:26:02] okay no syrian cannot give an immunity
[1:26:05] i'm talking to the christian estonian
[1:26:07] i'm not talking to a person that walks
[1:26:09] in civilization like a blind man
[1:26:14] i'm talking to christians that believe
[1:26:16] that we are of the supernatural world
[1:26:20] conquest
[1:26:31] see those things are things that we need
[1:26:32] to take
[1:26:34] personally
[1:26:47] it is an ongoing event
[1:26:52] you're looking at something to happen in
[1:26:54] the future
[1:26:56] like you said brother danny coming here
[1:26:59] you can go ahead and burn in your own
[1:27:00] forest fire you stepped
[1:27:37] but the scripture says uh it's not there
[1:27:43] and we see all this event when it rains
[1:27:45] and thunders
[1:27:49] this is what we see
[1:27:51] let me show you what we don't see if you
[1:27:53] show me a picture of a sprite
[1:27:58] how do you say
[1:28:01] well that's that's what i'm sorry what
[1:28:02] he's showing there is actually it's
[1:28:04] called that's called a super jet
[1:28:06] unsuper jet
[1:28:09] while thunder and lightning
[1:28:11] happens underneath
[1:28:34] they can reach up to 60 miles above the
[1:28:37] clouds
[1:28:40] they can reach across 60 miles 100 miles
[1:28:43] wide
[1:28:47] but they happen so fast
[1:28:53] and we're so entertaining the cloud and
[1:28:55] the thunder estamos
[1:28:59] that we missed the event above
[1:29:05] so when brother branham said he took
[1:29:07] lining off the sky
[1:29:34] all right that's that's the blue jet
[1:29:36] it's
[1:29:44] he actually breaks through the cloud and
[1:29:46] shoots up about 40 miles
[1:30:00] and those are greater
[1:30:01] greater events
[1:30:05] that even science don't know what to do
[1:30:06] with them
[1:30:08] you can turn the light the light on now
[1:30:10] that's that's just for illustration
[1:30:14] because the book of genesis
[1:30:16] genesis genesis 1.
[1:30:30] in the same verses he says of heaven to
[1:30:33] divide to divide the day from the night
[1:30:38] and let them be for signs
[1:30:43] for days
[1:30:45] and years
[1:30:46] we
[1:31:13] just for a testimony
[1:31:20] and we can't really enter into the depth
[1:31:22] of this or
[1:31:24] what brother daniel was speaking off
[1:31:43] and every time you see a large
[1:31:44] thunderstorm
[1:31:48] all that's happening
[1:31:52] there are signs in heaven
[1:31:55] and what brother branham was saying here
[1:31:57] local man
[1:31:59] what he had to do
[1:32:02] it was he was displaying all that just
[1:32:04] goal
[1:32:09] bring those children out of the fire
[1:32:25] in heaven
[1:32:28] something's got to be happening here on
[1:32:29] earth
[1:32:32] there is a miracle taking place
[1:32:34] somewhere
[1:32:36] there is the hand of the lord reaching
[1:32:38] out somewhere
[1:32:41] the lord is dealing with someone in
[1:32:43] particular
[1:32:45] in particular but he's showing it up
[1:32:47] here in heaven
[1:32:50] so let us open our eyes
[1:34:21] where are we oh right here okay so
[1:34:23] i found something interesting
[1:34:26] i don't know if it's a misprint no
[1:34:29] malin primeiro
[1:34:31] i i don't i don't believe it is
[1:34:34] but it had the topics which we went
[1:34:35] through
[1:34:38] and then on the side here
[1:34:41] it says ministers did you say ministers
[1:34:44] henry henry dan dan julian julian caleb
[1:34:48] nicole all right so i don't think that
[1:34:50] was a misprint
[1:34:53] oh there's more to come amen i must give
[1:34:55] up all right so so something great to
[1:34:57] look forward to algo bueno porque
[1:35:00] and as we continue with the uh the
[1:35:02] subjects it's like brother henry said
[1:35:07] it all comes together
[1:35:09] modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:35:14] so what a privileged people that we are
[1:35:17] that god sent us a prophet
[1:35:21] right and that we believe that prophet
[1:35:24] how many believe the prophet this
[1:35:25] morning
[1:36:10] heavenly father we we we beg that these
[1:36:12] words that were spoken
[1:36:16] that there may be a fertile ground
[1:36:19] and there may be life
[1:36:22] lord what you
[1:36:36] until we meet again
[1:36:39] we bless your name and we thank you for
[1:36:41] everything
[1:36:42] in the name of the lord jesus amen amen
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:56] amen let us all stand
[1:36:58] [Music]
[1:37:02] there is none like
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:10] no one else can touch my heart like you
[1:37:15] do
