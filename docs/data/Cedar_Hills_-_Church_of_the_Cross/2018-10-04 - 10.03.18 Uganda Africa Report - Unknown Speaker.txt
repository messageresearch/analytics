seated man want Omar sus asientos a man God surely is great in this Grandin man we wanna give a our testimony today on our trip come some testimonial in story okay and just to share with you what why I saw through my eyes become part is the lucky Oviatt reverse me so close mm eight times we wanna see through God's eyes which I was a los ojos de Dios but if I could just translated a little bit so you could kind of see through my eyes super Auto God did for us to pull over hollow pocket if the see look of the denominator let me so close a man now we we I I know we have heard part of the testimony just like a mosquito part a little testimonial and I think I believe it was Wednesday that I had gone to see our founding pastor before we left Duke located miracle is on Thursday if we are no stop Assad from the Lord and one of the things he he said no let's go scaled a home told him we're going to Africa he muskie you almost Africa we know how much he loved Africa the African people it's almost killed I'm a mutual and the Africa know you know he one of the things he said he said I'll see you on Friday una cosa que dijo dijo you lose your royal air it'll be honest you know and where they're stuck in in in New York for about four hours this almost all also know by Oracle cuatro horas we didn't know we're gonna be delayed no somos he almost said that the needles but there was an outbreak on the plane that we're supposed to get on but a via come on infection in lobby okay almost a severe so by the time we got to do by antis they gotta do by the flight that was going to Uganda and we'll okay Eva pie Uganda was delayed there another Toledo so instead of getting there on Thursday together there you got a me and webOS we got there on Friday you got myself be honest you know and sometimes it too many people may seem like nothing but a much identical surgeon was another but you know to to me it really it really made a big difference for a part of me so not grant diferencia you know cuz we don't go on our own merits okay no emotional appropriate males we we've always had confidence in our pastor champion almost confianza and Westropp a story and one thing you know it's sometimes as as his people nosotros somos gente it's frustrating no screw stir because we want a pastor to move on our merits and we want no Super Soaker Samoa and rosemary - so one thing is always showed us champion and know something other he ain't getting movement a guy shows him to move and also more varus again you know and well and so we many people we go many places vamos a muchos de Juarez and many people ask are you afraid to go in which Anton was prone to tell us me though they've you know but when we know we're confident inside but one of the most confusing to know so true that God is sending us somewhere Ocean Austin beyond Oh their love is no fear no wait the motor because we know we serve a God so musky said Remo zone Dios that's alive and now his Wow you can study were kissing them we serve a god that's real Theory Muslim Dios people you know we we see with our own eyes demo school knows propios ojos you know we've gone with our pastor our founding pastor you know pastor pursue food or we've seen the dead raised myrtles Levantado we've seen the blind see you know she was almost over we've seen the crippled walk with them and I know what more do we need a see church image necesitamos a very you know so we go on these trips and we have all confidence so much Olivia used in most law confianza that God is gonna be on the scene at the Ausmus not in the center you know a it's amazing a service-oriented it was a totally different type of trip and what many people may have expected we're here to tell me two different L Aquila hunters parada we show up to the south llamo self parte del suitor and we expected about a hundred and fifty passengers but almost commotion cincuenta Pistorius and 215 pastors show up those meal kantos and then we start hearing that fifty pastors here wanted to come but they couldn't get there Yoshio cincuenta notice no puedo throws no puedo llegar then we heard on how many pastors the King had that wanted to come you know to scoot on was los Pescados kids because someone who then rake a hoe stomach area many and just to see the happening in our myths namaz para ver lo que esta canción de nuestros medio seen the gospel being taken window and among helicase your other to 215 pastors who have just accepted the message from mozilla-central soulless chemical element circuit I don't know what that does do you church so secular so Stiglitz here but to me but I mean to know that I had part of that but also very can you do a part of this you know because we go and we see the scriptures look you've almost iva-mos iva-mos Lester scooter how we try to imagine if the thumb was in making ours how was it in the days of palm when we're done knows the other Pablo how Paul had to a fault Kokomo Cynthia Pablo knowing that he took this gospel sorry know clearly a woman killed you who the Gentiles concealers but you know I go back and reflect on that your regretfully maybe a pencil Nestle I see I had pardon that you mean opiate them into a part and I go back and I said brother how hot part of that your regular so he pills were Noel to a partner each and every one of you had part of the system but all that contributed rasca theorem in a mighty mighty way nuna grand gunman era we look at it just like something small Lumos Lumos elbows pequeño but because of what we've done her little circular looking at almost a chewiness each and every one of those pastors all of the kills pastoris now they can't take the gospel or dope when you have a dilemma Helio now they can't see it from a different light hearted open where they're all too loose amen amen so just seen and being part of that it was amazing viendo you share part of this with a solar salient you know we in the south when we started in a Sudan the Principia most we saw her started the teaching the ministerial meetings or miss Ombudsman sandy answerless law so they were known as a ministerial I don't think I've ever been into a ministerial meeting like that you know kid okay inter-ministerial de semana you know the the brothers that we are associated with those hermanos que estamos also cielos it's an honor and a privilege to know each and every one of these men that went with us sooner or later one of those dos hombres que for nosotros to see the gift that God has placed inside of them but I really don't care if you look other than throw their you know are pastor started off mr. pastor cumin saw with these meetings versus kudos and he was incredible and I Inc really you know the the people the ministers are want to hear and get that gospel so bad when this was getting catalysis they say even kiddo that one word three hours they were pulling it out of him or this was look allow on the end you know he you know I've never been to it I don't know how to explain it I'm sorry because of it but alone by but he we're expecting teaching estamos promotes an answer where he's explaining things and it's possibly kind of cautious but he was on fire but it is you know for him for three hours he was sort of hitting it they were pulling it slow sunken land oh you know and we that were there our mouths are open Luke on Okinawa Kabir will you ever seen anything like this luckily most of this video was he seen how much they wanted it v end ok time to look Aryan and how the wisdom was coming forth through our pianist of earlier than suppose here all those three hours price seemed like about 20 or 30 minutes justice or about saying can I come over here Oh windows when you're preaching or even talking in Africa well nobody can go blonde another preach on brother isn't predict hermano he one is so bad getting mono Menten you know so it was just just amazing in a service-oriented to see brother Jimmy hermano Jimmy for the tidus hermano Tito brother William mana William brother mark mano mark brother who yon monopoly on man it was it was um I don't know if I'm missing anybody buddy or brother Billy Tommy jr. it was incredible to see each person give their give their part ed another god hombre that's about it the brothers talked about the new birth los hermanos along the northern answer of a perfect man that's the tuna the lumber perfecto just to see these brothers said hermanos just grasp it no market I don't know you know we we got done with some of the conference's that I mean almost who knows juntos and Atticus and a lot of the a lot of the pastors mucho dolor one of the things that they kept on saying that really stuck to me you know the scores of scales repeat en que se quedó conmigo their how why it took you so long to get to us porque the rat is done to tiempo para llegar nosotros why did it take the gospel so long the carbon pool among hadoo para para ser contact to come you know and and you see how when you have put the word in to their hands when i supposed to it la palabra and and las manos nails you know it it's so sad just on Teresa you know one aspect you know in a spectrum because you know sometimes it seems like we take this gospel for granite por que hace mucho mama says they about hailey oh come on oh she knows nada there's some over there that are barely putting their hands on this cos I'll just get a pianist uncapped understand won't kill you and then we have here in the US you know socially those many trying to defame this message we're trying to get it get it a lot of mildest this women second you know it's what a privilege it is Reba let us dig less you to know what God gave us you look at knows the old you know and many times I asked myself which ever says met but I wonder why didn't he choose me or get my school me why did he choose me or chemist go here mean to give the gospel to but other eleven okay how did it happen to me no more Malcolm to show me and they tell me yes why me muchos is polluted porque on how come I came in contact with the gas or do you contact a good 11 kill you know what we have is mighty it's powerful glimpses gran they pulled it also you know and the whole world don't have it it's old mundo no latina you know I believe they're gonna have that opportunity okay one at Anila Fortuna Don but they don't have it for no lieutenant so when you see them touch the first book when most America talk a little bit premiere libro that was translated in their language was real honest with you my oh what a sight to see Sergei course other very gracious to know that you have part in it so Eric you said to a party that all day we did as a church the solo kazuma tsukumo Gliss yes who put that it changed their lives para para ponerse para cambiar sus vidas which we gave the books we were in the north demos real divas gonna try and parte del Norte they're just a different people but animus some gente diferente people that has been damaged we're not going to consider with any others through the trials and the tribulations of their land for those privacy that will as soon as the soup is there barely coming out of it especially you know where we're driving from the north to the South manaconda little northern food and many and we're complaining is tomorrow's kick on the nose man this road is long yesterday the community a lot of them who designed these roads this in yours to come you know but it's a bit it's a place for a salut garden that they've been damaged Nancy those Daniella there's so many years behind he's done muchos anos up because they were controlled by a murder or confirm control Osborne asesino that the roads nothing has been updated now ask you are regardless come you know see that in person but awareness from persona now imagine what they're going for a my heinous Lucas compass on the whales mentally they've gone through these things in San Mateo some pasado por esto so it was a great teacher but a Long Island Coast eggless now the gospel was placed in their hair another killer Anzio puestos Natalie have something that in an algo they have something that will pick them up in an article of relevant are they have hope not signal what this message given look at estimate circular though they have hope there's nothing greater but answered algo mas Grande see can't tell many not a personal differences you know I think those brother Titus that was talking about it amazi toast all on the list he said what would you do get up there with two drops on those waters of the literal blood of Jesus and a little Anika Seuss or will take care of it all of water that almost we're withholding clothes let's do it on the circuit but you know what the prophet of God says have a look at he could provide but what's given to us look at Osakis greater than that blast must grab that gets us we were what was purchased by that blast Bobo put a socket purchased uh sending a strong bro that's the gospel yes is a level that we take to this way of almost we show them that there is home vamos vamos cash Bonanza that the gospel is alive evil we have paid the word almost we put the world when it was not beloved into their hair in Sue's Manos because what happens in Uganda echo echo intestine Uganda every denomination I mean that's young many preachers pastors political spots and Buddhist about everything that is given to these people oh no kids otherwise de gente they have no way no tengo ninguna manera who search it like they they dig the school to see if it's the truth thought of a sphere is never done maybe don't have the Bible to back it up which I know nothing I love you yet but of the spolano but you Church do you put Bibles in many hand signals a push so fearless and as Manos there here's what the message of the hour in their hands don't miss reckon that all this was Manos you've given them hope listen listen odd Oh Esperanza many times we see the final product whichever most el producto tell me nothing but we don't see the price that was paid but no a muscle press ok ok for peridot to see where we've come from they don't every must to get to where we're almost you take every one of your lives so my god oh no this was Vitas what have you had to go through yeah pasado stay to be where you're at but up let us not on this not way it's easy to look and take for granite especially the malaria must tomorrow a la tierra but years ago in years ago oh I know so trust when our pastor or alder most once you know they had to fight for this casket destiny and capella report is the one they had to pave the road for us okay settle Camino para so it's easy to see the final product is Fosse developer look to therapy nada well you know I I had read Yoli and I was talking to her brother about this sudden Oakland hermanos sobre esto about John Newton the John Newton he's the one who wrote amazing grace - give video so we'll simply Meghan asked you
