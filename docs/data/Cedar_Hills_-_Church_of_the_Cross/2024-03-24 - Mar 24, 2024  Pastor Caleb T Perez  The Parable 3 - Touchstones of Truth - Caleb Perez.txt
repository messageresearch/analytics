perfect his strength is perfect his strength is [Music] perfect for oh first I'll do a testimony uh November of Thanksgiving I went into the hospital with double pneumonia and then kind of got over that my breathing hasn't caught up yet but Christmas day I could not breathe and uh Thanksgiving they said that I was getting about went from 30% down to 20% activity of my heart when I went in Christmas they said I had complete heart failure and uh that wasn't good news but they also changed doctor and I got another doctor and he gave me a cardiac [Music] catheterization and he said that no my bottom half of my heart was putting out at 50% which is what it's supposed to that there was just a mixup at the top of my heart uh electrical and uh so I'm going to probably be going in pretty quick for uh called an oblation but I'm not worried about it uh and uh so if I'm I get breathless real easy and that's why I'm sitting down but this one song it's an old song and uh it's written by Chris kristopherson everybody knows he's not really that great but he did have a uh he had a religious experience where he he went to church and they were preaching and you know everybody started raising their hands and these think ain't no way I'm going to do that hands start going up and and then they call for people to come up to go to the front to you know give their heart to the Altar and he said in his mind ain't no way I'm going to do that next thing he knows he's up at the front at the and the preacher starts talking to him and he says what you know are you going to accept he says I don't know I don't even know why I'm here and uh he said he felt such a sense of relief and forgiveness that he was just sitting there crying and three days later he came up with this song I've heard it way back and I kind of like [Music] it why me Lord what have I ever done to deserve even one of the pleasures I've known tell me Lord what did I ever do that was worth Ling you for the kindness youve shown Lord help Mees I wasted so help me Jesus I know what I I am but now that I know that I needed you so help me Jesus your C me Lord if you think there's a way I can try to repay all taken from [Music] you maybe Lord I I can show someone else what I've been through myself on my way back to [Music] you Lord help me Jesus I wasted it help Mees I know what I am but now that I know that that I need you help me Jesus my in your Lord help Jesus I wasted it so help me Jesus I know what I [Music] am but now that I know I've need you so help me Jesus my soul in your so help me Jesus my

is for sparing the life of brother Lorenzo senior last night we're grateful to God that he's still with us amen and uh grateful to God that each one of you were able to make it this morning amen this is the parable we might as well get into the word this is the parable number three with the subtitle touchstones of Truth anybody here know what a touchone is hi sister Heidi God bless you it's nice to see you good to see all the visitors that are here this morning also anybody know what a touchstone is so it doesn't mean much this morning then until you know what a touchstone is right but that's why we're here like unclean says that's why we're here amen God bless the wonderful message on Wednesday we were able to hear it where we were at we don't take vacations from church we were in church Wednesday just in case you wanted to know wonderful service wonderful sermon God bless God bless our brother pastor touchstones of Truth we're going to find out what these touchstones are everybody with me this morning we we we won't it's pretty bad out there we won't have an evening service but uh so then uh and I'm going to try not to go too long either but we just want to get right to the grain of it and see what the Lord has for us before we go on just shake your neighbor's hand good to see you neighbor your neighbor it's good to see them through all the hardships through the through what we've been through this week how many are glad we have a place to come to but no matter where we are we have a place and that is in Christ amen we've learned that anytime we read about the heavens and the Earth they're in the Bible we're speaking about the parable you talk about heavens and earth and the Earthly and the Heavenly it's about the parable it's about the great story and the parable is the plan it's the whole Plan of Redemption that was unfolded there's Mya God bless you Sister eie and eie God bless her that's a familiar face amen it's a plan the parable is the plan and it is the unfolding of the greatest story that's ever been told turn to your neighbor and say and you are part of that great story you are part of that great story how many know that the that the message has levels huh you know when you think you got a hold of the message good he comes and gives us another level and he says come up a little bit higher and we thought that we were on a pretty high level and and then all of a sudden we see man there's we can go up a little bit more amen and that's what we're grateful to God for Mark the 4th chapter and the 33rd verse and the 34th verse so you got to pinch yourself this morning okay best brother brother Uncle Chuck and a Paula and sister Carmen and they Brave the snow and the wind to get this morning Sil City amen that's what you call presenting your body a Living Sacrifice it says like this and with many such Parables spake he the word which is the logos unto them as they were able to hear okay how many of you are able to hear he spake these Parables as they were able to hear right because Faith only comes One Way by hearing and the hearing of the word of God Amen but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated what a thing it is to get alone with him amen I'm going to say it again what a thing it is to get alone with him how many of you have gotten alone with the Lord before how many of you can say I want to get more more more with him Parables as we say and we'll we'll we'll say this just just to to to remind us but I think we all know it now a parable can you define it for me somebody what was that very good an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning and it also means to place one thing side by side with another for the purpose of what for the purpose of comparing amen all right putting things side by side for the purpose of comparing and with such Parables he spake the word unto them one writer states this the one who spake in many parables is the same one who inspired holy men of old to write the Old Testament right everybody got that who spoke all these Parables Jesus spoke all these Parables right and he who spake all these Parables once again is the same one who inspired holy men of old to write the Old Testament that's why he says we can therefore expect to trace the same mind running through the whole scriptures all right in another I'm going to say it again you can see the same mind so many things that Jesus had said you go back to the Old Testament you find out many things that that were said back then men were inspired or these scriptures were God breathed but the same mind that breathed these thoughts into these men of old is the same mind that had put on flesh and blood and began to preach and to teach in Parables many of The Parables types the Shadows the visions of the old were Illustrated and light was placed on those things in the New Testament which proved one thing there was a Unity there in the scriptures now parables are fascinating and the more that I look into it the more that I'm like wow parables are fascinating in that one cannot receive Revelation without the parable we want revelation how many want more Revelation I think we all raise our hands because we want more revelation God bless you brother Henry good to have you home amen we want more Revelation and that's the thing that Satan hates the most he hates Revelation he hates when God reveals himself to you and he even hates it more when he reveals himself through you the par is the wrapping of the Revelation how many understand that I'm going to say it again there is a revelation that comes from the mind of God but it has to be wrapped in something and the wrapping of the Revelation is the parable okay this is why the parable is so important you don't catch the parable you don't catch the symbol you don't catch the right Revelation oh you can get some revelation or some understanding of things but it won't take you very far once again it is the wrapping of what was in the mind of God God great plan lies in the Revelation hi once again and wrapped in the parable brother Bram writes a letter to a man that he had had services with his name was Reverend C Parker Thomas Parker Thomas many of you have ever read that letter he was a pastor there in South Carolina South Carolina I I'm not going to read the whole letter but I I want to highlight this this part of the letter that he's writing to this man he States this he says being a Bible student you know that the infinite omniscient God there's two things there right the infinite omnis God had a plan brother brandom is writing to this man he had a plan now to me that's that's the parable is the plan and then he says that he not only originated in his wisdom but by his omnipotence he put it into effect now we can have the wisdom of God this originates the very plan of God but without the omnipotence of God the plan just stays a plan the word just stays word there's no action to it there's no unfolding to it now notice notice this now watch as he continues in this letter being God he could not fail he is Sovereign thus it must stand that this Sovereign God could predestinate men or otherwise his purpose would fail and God cannot fail so he predestinated men what to unfold the plan put the plan into action to put the word into action he had men that brought the word he had men that would unfold or make the word or put it into action a plan that he originated in his wisdom parables are speeches and sentences Stories full of spiritual wisdom and truth but yet at the same time they carry conviction and divine Authority parables are the touchstones of Truth now we all that we're going to get into our message you to tell your neighbor because repeating it it helps you very much me very much touchstones of truth touchstones of Truth par right the parable has the Touchstone of Truth in it once again Parables have the touchstones of Truth all right Parables as we said is placing one thing side by side for the purpose of comparing now I hope you you're with me this morning when you begin to compare something you have to be able to compare apples to apples they say once again now it's my you have to compare apples to apples you can't get a banana and say well let's compare a banana with an orange totally different characteristics different different taste different different shapes different nothing comparable only that you can put them under the same category of fruit but other than that so it is in life when we try to compare things we we are so good at trying to compare things right that that when you put things side by side how many of you have suffered in in one form or another in life I I think we should all be able to raise our hands right sickness or or hardships or whatever it is we've all suffered in some form or another now now if I were to get our sufferings and I would compare them with the with the glory that's that is to be revealed in us could you compare those two things wait wait a minute why then do we compare this why in our life do we always compare I've had it rough oh I mean if we really knew by the touchstones of faith that you cannot compare your suffering with the glory that shall be revealed us scripture says this it says in Romans 8 for the suffering of this present time are not even Worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us oh my my then now we have something that we can't compare you cannot compare one thing to another unless you have a basis to compare it I'm going to say it again you have to have a basis for comparison or else your comparison is in vain think about this we must take the Heavenly truth and the Earthly truth and we must compare them together can they be compared yes only under the parable yes sir are you with me come on now you got to yourself this morning you can you can compare the Heavenly truth with the Earthly truth because it has the same Touchstone okay here we go take two people if I were to say okay I'm gonna take brother brother Isaac and then I'm going to take Nate and I'm going to see them them side by side and I'm going to say I'm going to compare these two what's my basis for comparison is my bases see who's taller is it to see who's the better basketball player basketball he said you were shake his hand say thanks all right is it I mean what is it what what's the comparison is it maybe music I don't know maybe how to work or different kinds of work I mean I have to have a basis for comparing them now if I see two people that go to church and I try to compare them my comparison it will always fall short because I'm using my own Touchstone my own idea of what I think a Christian should be so then I'll say oh that brother he more holy and more more saintly than the other brother oh that sister wears longer skirts all the way to the ground so she's got to be more holy what's my comparison is it a long skirt is it how long hair grows some people's hair don't grow as long as others some of us our hair is just falling out it's part of life but but the thing is is that there's got to be some kind of comparison that both of them are compared to instead of comparing people to each other that's the error we make you don't compare two people to each other because each one has had a different path in life yet they both have come to one thing and that's the word therefore I can't compare the people not even myself to anyone I have to stand or lay side by side with the word and use the word as my Touchstone am I am I getting across this morning we have to do that this morning not look at your neighbor look at yourself by the word I I I say all this for this this brings us brings to light the word Touchstone truth the touch Stone here's here's the definition now you'll know what a touchone you won't forget after today Touchstone is the basis of comparison once again you cannot compare two things unless you have the same bases it is a reference point against which other things can be evaluated for its quality or Excellence it is the Criterion it is the gauge or the standard once again the Touchstone is the standard now in old times they would take a a piece of Jasper this Stone then somebody would come to me and say brother Ethan would say uh I've got some gold coins brother Ruben would say I've got some silver coins bring them over here this Stone of Jasper was the Touchstone in other words this was the way I would evaluate their Stones because as I took the stone the the the the coin and I would I would I would scratch the top of this rock it would leave a certain type of Mark now if it was only 10% gold it would leave a certain kind of Mark it was 50% silver it would leave a certain kind of Mark if it was pure silver or pure gold it would leave a different kind of Mark so by me taking your coins and running it over the Touchstone I tell if your point was worth something or not now Christ is the Touchstone because Christ is the word and no matter what revelation we claim to have you got to take the Revelation and You' got to rub it against the stone and to see if it's worth anything or not to see if your Revelation is from God or if it's just a Creed doctrine of a church we all got to go to the touch Stone and we've got to scrape it here for we're making that our standard our truth I am the way and I am the truth and I am the life he's the standard now come on now look look at this you look online you young ladies you look online and you get on YouTube and you get on all these different sites and you have fashion you see fashion everywhere right W I want to look like that anybody ever ever do that oh what a nice dress wow you guys are leaving me hanging this morning do you guys ever do knowbody yeah I'm just want to see if you're if you're going to rub your stone up against the the rub your coin up against the Jasper we bring these things and in in in in seeing this we we look at that and we say man I would like to dress and look like that and without realizing we uh we are making that style and that fashion we're making that our Touchstone right that's our point of reference that's our standard well if I leave it a little bit low okay where did that standard come from who lowered the standard well if I chop it all who lowered the standard well if I paint and I get all these big long where you getting your standard from well if I just just it's okay if I just cuss a little bit what what's your Touchstone your standard that's right how many are with me this morning we're getting to something here I want you to really understand what and who your Touchstone is you can look at a lot of things but everything we compare ourselves to well well well she's prettier than me you're making her your Touchstone so you're going to try to do your hair like her and dress like her and be like her and sing like her and act like her be like him and and and lift the weights like them and the next thing you know it your touch Stone has changed and when your touchone changes your standard goes down when the standard goes down the enemy walks in the enemy doesn't even have to fight in because the standard was lowered who's your Touchstone the error of our ways the error of our ways then when it comes into Christianity we can talk about these other things that that's just carnal stuff the real thing is the unbelief we do those things because we don't believe so we've got to come and bring ourselves back not to compare with someone but compare it with the pattern of the word are you with me yes or yes now now now notice this now when we see the Parable with a touchstone it makes all the sense in the world because now you have the correct bases touchstones of Truth now keep that in mind as we go forward everybody knows what a touchstone is now right the basis it's what you judge everything by and until the Touchstone is established in our Parable we simply just have an Earthly story right this is why people say this is a very common phrase now now this is my truth Your Truth probably so what a low standard when when I think that my ways are the truth dirty standard Jesus said I am the weight and I am that's my standard the word not the brother or sister is the standard now the word has to come in flesh we understand and Paul would say be ye followers of me why because the word had come to their time in flesh and blood and the messenger became the standard to that age now that's the parable unfolding now notice this now Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says reveal is to make known in Divine truth ah he didn't leave out the Touchstone did you get it reveal is to make known and then he says in Divine truth something can be revealed to us I can say I bet you all don't know what I have inside this Bible I have a picture here and I'm going to reveal to you what was in there a picture you can't see it you know who gave me this picture sister Bera in my Bible it is the picture and it's hard for you to tell what it is but it's a squirrel a scroll not a squirrel man I'm in trouble huh yeah it's a scroll am I saying that right scroll scroll I'm having trouble with squirrel scroll today it is a scroll and it says a is coming forth out of the scroll and it and in there it says the word became flesh oh well now now you know but now it's not just a revealing there is a Divine truth in this how that from a scroll a man can come for see that's the Divine truth in all this how that from the letter of the Bible come forth a bride that is the word why it's a touchstone of Truth this is the Touchstone but when it comes into the individual you then can become the Touchstone let me not get ahead of myself here it's in Divine truth the Revelation it is Christ's way of making himself known to his church the Revelation is how Christ makes himself known to the Revelation is how Christ makes himself known to oh Caleb this is how he makes himself known to me let's let's go on he's making himself known but before he can do that he has to establish truth in US truth has got to be established now now if I asked you how many of you have been established in truth how many believe that yeah yeah kind of I don't know let me see your hands like you believe it raise your hand I believe established in truth we thank God for this message for a prophet that he sent for an apostle that was sent to establish what the prophet said in order to establish truth men of God were sent to do this work what is a sent one an apostle he is the sent one he said men of God were sent forth to do this work to establish truth in you and I Christ the mystery Wesley was a man of God all right is that truth truth whether somebody likes it or not it's truth he says but what followed him said this many times but what followed him Fallen Angels got into it what were these Angels first they were creative beings of God but they fell for Lucifer's wisdom and you see what they become fallen angels and organizations from Men of God who was sent forth to establish truths in the in the Earth come on now men of God sent forth to establish truth in Earth Caleb right right now now watch what he says here but before the truth could go on and proclamate and get onto the real revelation of Christ the Fallen Angels come in and took it over and they made denominations out of it that's the reason watch what brother Bram says this that's the reason the revelation of the seven mystery had to be unfolded a little at a time the parable had to be unfolded because if it was opened all at once Satan could do great damage with this here's here's where it comes to if Luther would have went on he would have been here Wesley Pentecost Wesley but now there's only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there's nothing else can follow it come on now there has to be a message did that message come yes it did did it come in word yes it did did it come in action yes it is yes or yes watch there has to be a message at the end time when there's nothing else can follow it what the message on paper no the message in flesh that when it takes you to go up higher nothing else can follow you there's no devil in hell can follow you where you're going that's what the message came to do take us up higher into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this message is the only message that established the touchstones of Truth nothing else there's no other message I'm sorry but there's no other message Man placed his church his organization his Creed his dogmas he placed them as His touchstones well my church says well my pastor says watch it there could be some truth in there but if you don't watch it you're going to go off the deep end your touchstone's going to be wrong and then you'll find yourself in the gutter God has only one Touchstone of Truth tell your neighbor God has only one Touchstone of Truth and that is Christ the word all right God has a way of establishing the truth in you you know where it all starts are you ready where does it start it starts in prison all right you want to know the Touchstone or not now now this is this is to change our mentality about a lot of things it starts in prison we all want to sit in Rain amen how many amen nobody wants to sit in Rain those that don't want to sit in rain can you can leave now this message is for the ones that want to sit and rain let me ask again how many of you want to sit and rain I think that's why we're part of why we're here because there's a position there's a place that God has for us but it all starts in prison the parable continued in prison the parable started in prison and if we do not handle prison and know what to do in prison without prison you cannot Reign and without the pit you can't have the prison you know what story I'm going at huh you already know terrible which story am I talking about of Joseph handle the pit first oh look at me what did I do I didn't do nothing wrong all of a sudden you're taken out sold how many you ever had somebody sell you out real nice to you when you turn your back sell them out it happens right people really nice to your face so nice when you turn but notice this now it all starts or it continues but but with us it starts in prison and I want this to really really settle the parable gets going in the prison house but it's where nobody wants to be I thought I was going to rain with you Lord character to rain yet talking about myself I shouldn't just say you I say I should say we don't have the character to rain you don't suffer you can't rain you don't suffer you can't rain okay okay let's get somewhere with this this morning are you with me let's see where where the Holy Ghost takes us this morning every person born by sex is in the same prison look around that you don't think you're the only one that got put in prison look around as when you finish yawning look around all right all right now now look look around every single one of us was born into the same prison so quit the booing about being in prison and I have it so rough we were all born in sin the world speaking lies we are all born into a prison house and the faster we get that in our heart F the parable can unfold even before we did anything wrong we were born and born through sex of our mother and father we didn't do anything wrong yet and we're already in prison he says you're in a prison House of sin and death we were born to die who could keep the law any one of you who could keep the law no man is justified by the law no flesh can be saved by the law the law had no salvation the law was a prison house the law come and told you that you were a sinner but I go to church but you're a sinner but I I I help the widows and the orphans but you're a sinner it's good that you do all these things but you're still a sinner that's what the law came to do the law is what put us in in jail to begin with but it has no power to take us out of jail I wouldn't want to be a prisoner and that's what the law does shuts you up let me tell shut up you're going to hell but I I my my mom and my dad they were good you're going to hell shut that's that's what the law does I don't want to be a a a prisoner he says like that it condemns you Thou shalt not and if you do you're in prison no way of getting out I don't want the law God wanted to bless his children he couldn't do it under the law neither could he under judgment and justice but the only way he could do it was under the love of his son Christ Jesus this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased what is it all the law is finished maybe we'll get our crosses up all the law was finished he fulfilled it all when he gave his life on the cross we're coming into Easter got a lot of meaning but watch this now all the law was finished all the judgments is finished my beloved Son hear him all those other things are done this is him now in PR prison we have the word I'm going to say it again in prison we have the word I'll tell you what brother Brown says tell you what the word what the Bible says in prison you have the word good m in prison we got the word that's not goody through the hearing of the word we have to understand this that there is a key to Salvation listen closely Church there's a key to Salvation for those that are in the prison house was me is that anybody else there's a key here for Caleb there's a key to the door to liberate us from it and establish the truth in us that through the hearing of the word conviction and divine Authority are activated God's goal is for this great parable to unfold in his mind he knew we would be in prison in his mind he already knew how he was going to open your prison wait a wait wait a minute I'm GNA say it again in his mind he knew when and how your door of your prison would be every one of our brothers it seems like was in prison yes you're looking at me like you don't know read your Bible I think the first one in prison in the Bible was Joseph right and on and on you go and John the Baptist and on and on you go in Paul and Peter and and I think there was probably more people in the New Testament in prison than in the old they were all in prison but God had a way of opening the prison door how was Peter's prison door open because there was people praying and when all of a sudden the angel of the Lord comes down SE Peter in prison opens the door for him he walks right out all right now it wasn't that easy for for for for Joseph Joseph was in his prison but God has a way because in his mind and I'm going to go through these three scriptures real quick Isaiah 611 the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to Caleb that was bound oh can you put your name there all right Psalms 102 and let's go to Just verse 20 to hear the groaning of the prisoner to lose those that are appointed to death Isaiah 42 says say to open the blind eyes to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house you see you must take control of your prison before he lets you out of it oh come on come on now is there anyone else with me you can't even get on the throne unless you start to control your prison Paul and silus were there and what did they do did they cry about being in prison they sang songs and worship what were they doing the parable was unfolding church I hope that you get this this night you must rule your prison before you can Ascend to the throne you get it come on now in his wisdom in his mind is the way you break out of prison prison break sounds like a good movie huh bre luck there probably is one called that do you get it if you don't believe me ask all your brothers that were in prison Hallelujah [Music] Glory here's the parable Parable doesn't sound good at times we're brothers with with a bunch of excon right amen the parable reads Paul was in prison and Peter was in prison this one was in prison and Joseph and Daniel was in the line guilty guilty by representation yes but notice this now the attorney brother Bram says one of the attorneys said you got Brothers in federal prison I said I did have who were they one was brother John in Alcatraz or on the aisle of PM the other was Paul in a Roman jail prison house jph because he was accused of something he didn't even do condemned and laid in prison for years that's a good reason to be bitter I didn't even do it you get people today I didn't even do it I didn't do nothing why you blaming me well you're lucky we're blaming you and not putting you in prison usually the one saying I didn't do nothing is the ones that that usually I know I used that before I was Jung at one time I was Jung and I and I said things like that then I had to I grew up a little bit and I I had to say things the way they they should be said he said I didn't do but he didn't stay there he knew that there was a purpose for him being there he had a job to do in prison and before he could Ascend to the throne he had to make sure that the word was established in him what was the word that was established in somebody help me he's sitting in prison word got to be established what was the word so his he knew what was taught him by his father but as he sat there it was the dreams that he had right amen that was the word of the Lord to him so he began to think about that now you all remember this the message that I preach right if what you see is not what you saw then what you see is just temporary all right that that was that was what he that was the way he looked at it but in prison this is this is what brother brandham says in his prison he con constantly remembered that's where the devil gets us think about it one time we think everything's okay we go back to our default mode it happens to all of us we're going to do better now we got it now we're Victorious doesn't even take a day and we're back to our same old s what Happ we we can't control the prison oh you know who I'm talking to we can't control it we always hit default mode back to the same thing again and we get to church better church we to the same old thing you know why brother Bram says he constantly remembered Abraham says he was born for a purpose each one of us has got to believe we are born for a purpose how many believe we are born for a purpose you got to constantly remember that every day every hour every minute Satan don't take vacations we do oh we have a good time good church service how many of you have kept the victory from last Sunday how many of you have kept the victory from Wednesday Keep it going how constantly remembering I have a purpose watch this now Joseph put him side by side with Christ here's the parable it means to compare side by side Joseph was in prison the Butler and Baker were in prison too one was saved and the other lost man that's a mirror image Christ was on the cross brother Bram says that was Christ's prison house for those of you that didn't know Jesus had a prison house and his prison house brother brah says was his cross CU he couldn't move move from there that was his prison house until I'm going to say it was his prison house until his soul and his Spirit were ripped from that body and then he went down to prison and he took captivity he brings them up from the dead and he goes back up to the right hand of the father sounds like Joseph huh he was in prison but then he sat next to the he was the right hand of pharaoh and no one could come to pharaoh and no one can come to the father said no one comes to the father except through me perfect parallel perfect parable how about your life uh oh uh oh how about your life where are you at before his vision could be completely fulfilled he had to become a prisoner and then he became a ruler oh when we see the lives of these men who they they they perfectly parallel we were condemned in the chains of sin in the prison of House of Hell guilty to be destroyed forever and then somebody took Hallelujah does the cross get old to you does the blood has it lost its power the song says it will never lose its power it has to be powerful until the last one is dipped into the blood and comes out white as s this is what gets me that he would even hold back the coming until you and I got the Holy Ghost blows my mind church because when people just want to throw at the message oh brother BR missed it in 197 oh brother BR missed it about the California this and that thinking oh brother brand is that what you see then you need to go back to the Cross to know that his grace his grace was so sufficient and Powerful that he even held back his coming till you and I got ready brother Todd can you imagine he even held back his coming until Todd would come in give himself to Christ he did did that for you and I he held everything back so that we could come out of our prison house and we could re with him if that doesn't excite us still today then we should get back to the altar get a hold of the heart don't never let his blood dry up in your life rise up it can do no good for no one else this is this is where we're coming to are you with me now watch now he not only did what he did but this is tremendous to me he stripped the enemy he stripped it of its power and authority over us okay okay might not mean a whole lot sometimes in King James version it's hard to understand but I'm going to pull a brother Danny here Colossians 2 13- 15 I'm going to read this real quick and then and then I'm going to go to another version and Caleb put your name there being dead in his sins and the uncircumcision of his flesh he quickened together with him having forgiven all C's trespass blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against Caleb come on are you putting your name there which was contrary to me and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it that's tremendous huh but let me read it in a different way God stripped the spiritual rulers and powers of their Authority with the cross he won the Victory and showed the world that they were powerless he publicly shamed them and made a public spectacle of them wait wait wait wait a minute where is he where is he I want you to get this okay we can't run through this you got to get this part you think God forgot the look of Adam and Eve was taken off and they were naked and they were shameful and they walked in the garden trying to hide themselves hover themselves do you think God forgot that to look into the eyes of his children the pain and the hurt and the suffering that there would be a Chasm between them but that was part of the parable but he didn't forget that now I'm going to read you a different version and I pray that you get with is good stuff are you ready you take it to yourself when you were stuck in your old sin dead life you were incapable of responding to God so God brought you alive right along with Christ think of it okay here we go now this is this is the this is the part think of it he says says all sins forgiven oh is that [Music] enough all able sins forgiven okay if that's not enough I'm going to give you another one the Slate wiped clean the old arrest warrant has been [Music] cancelled and they have been nailed to the cross then he stripped all the spiritual tyrant in the universe of their sham Authority when he died on the cross and then he marched them naked through the streets Hallelujah can we give one to the Lord Jesus this morning wow that's what he did for you and I how did he March them naked they naked in that they have no power stri them of that they have no power anymore only the ones that you give him because you're the one that gives them clothing without your body they have no body to work through there is therefore now the Bible says zero condemnation the Slate is wiped clean come on tell your neighbor the Slate is wiped clean the old arrest warrant is cancelled there's nobody looking for you anymore there is no Authority looking for you because Christ already paid the price he made a way for you and I to come out of the of the prison house so that we could then Ascend the throne oh my my time is gone already can I just have like 10 minutes oh please help me this morning I need some help what a storyline what a parable wait a minute wait a minute this is the way the story reads he took us out of the prison house we're no longer prisoners wait wait wait wait wait wait wait a minute story goes on I Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ w oh come on church I'm going to say it again we go from being a prisoner to a prisoner that doesn't sound very that brother AJ how is that I thought we were free are but we are his prisoner of love and you know what makes us prisoners is that it's not us that speaks anymore it is him that speaks through us it is no longer us that do what we do but it is Christ in you the hope of glory this is a little sermon to get us ready for Easter notice this now just just a few few minutes okay amen hear that wind he wishes huh there's another wind going on right now the wind that was on the day of Pentecost this is this is where we're at now the parable starts as a word Parable say it again it starts as a word Parable but it ends as an action Parable pares don't stay in word form true Parable becomes an action parable come on now the mechanics don't can't just stay mechanics it's got to become the Dynamics here we are now it's got to move from word Parable he knew what he had to do he knew and he reminded himself of what God's plan was for him but then the Bible says that while he was in prison the Jailer the one that was the head of the prison said the prison's yours all the prisoners are yours do whatever you want you control everything come on somebody's got to be with me this morning you got to control your prison first because in your prison or in the prison there's a lot of other people that are still prisoners and it's your duty to then take these prisoners and bring them out of prison here's what brother brandham says he said now that he's taken me out now I go from cell to cell letting the prisoners out what we do in life we let the prisoners out who who is he using today we got the word but do you have the action to take people out of prison control the prison first we've been in prison bondage of many things you feel in the blanks I can stand St for hours feeling in the blanks of your life brother BR says Don't Preach me a message live me a message and then he says Don't Preach any higher than you live you know why because we're always telling stories about somebody else yes or yes in the 1700s don't get me wrong I like good stories I love good stories but if I can't take like brother Abraham always says if I can't take that story from back there and make it alive in my day something wrong I missed it somewhere I love good stories I love the history of where how things came I love even more God does something in my life that I can have a passion about I can say he is alive this is what he's doing in my life I was lost but he found me he saved me he washed me he has perfected me he has made me ready for the Rapture now I'm bringing it to myself it's not just about a good story it's beyond that when you tell your story nobody can tell it like you you don't even know what happened in the first years of my life you don't know what happened when I was growing up you don't know what had happened in our marriage you don't know what happened in my in my childhood only you can tell the story and the passion you give with it and you know what Christ did for you brought you out of your prison house to do what put you in touch with the touchone I got to skip some of this I'm coming to a little not an end but set me up for my next one when I look at how this unfolds without a parable he spake not to them when they were alone he expounded all things to him everyone can say we have the word Parable but not everyone can manifest only the bride can as the action of par listen to this if I can't take the message and bring it to my day to my life what good is the message now if I can read the message and I find myself here oh here's the passion I can tell you about it in my day are you ready for this one this is in the message influence what we've seen happen should put every soul in action I don't know why things just don't go right you're not in action that's the answer we're in action for everything else but not the things of I don't feel called to do that brother that's okay not everybody's called to go on the mission yet everybody's called to go on the mission field because the mission field is right outside the door I'm getting something here with you what we've seen happen should put every soul in in other words it should make a church I can't look at some of church I got to look at this church it should make Cedar Hills Church of the cross that would make a Revival he's talking about he's preaching it in Phoenix Phoenix would make a Revival here in Phoenix Phoenix and I'm going to put here in Lo crues is there a revival going on oh come on church is there a revival going on where is it going on who the Revival I'm the Revival you're the Revival you got to see it in the scriptures listen listen to this because the scriptures the Holiness of the scriptures is what impregnates the parable there's a mouthful right there I'm going to say it again the Holiness of the scriptures impregnates the parable in words it causes it to produce I'm not done waitting I don't feel that Revival we get it it should put put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a Revival here in Los crues now listen I didn't I I didn't I didn't make this up this is the way the parable goes then some people get mad they think they're Revival I don't that's the attitude of people why are they all happy why don't you get happy what if we went around saying why are they all sad that's not the way to be that's a false comparison this is his word a Revival here in Los Cruses that people would be flying in from Europe I didn't say that brother Bram said that part of the parable because this weekend we'll have brother Morton from Europe flying in what's the purpose of him flying in keep on reading I want to keep on reading here sorry I got to keep on reading with something else here because they would should be flying in from Europe to see what taking place I was talking to brother Marcus couple days ago we wouldn't be where we're at if we had not come in connection with the with the team with the body there in Los crus he's excited he's got a revival going on in well they would be flying in from Europe what was taking place they say there's a place in Arizona oh New Mexico I mean the Mia Valley City I mean Los Cruses there's something broke out there listen until the seven thunders of Revelations 10 that's not even wrote in the Bible is being manifested there that is what our our founding pastor preached and preached and preached he said it's not written John was not permitted to write he said because God said he would write it with his finger in the heart of the believer that's where it's been written oh my manifested revealed is one thing manifested is another this is the great Parable here's what he says and he's quoting Isaiah 53 no beauty that desire of him he is despised and rejected of men Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted now that's good in the time of Jesus he fulfilled that but now a prophet took it from then brought it to the Masterpiece of today oh come on now I'm GNA say it again I'm finishing now he brings it to the Masterpiece of today and he says this the word living and in action and then he says the Bible bride hello Bible Bride come on shake your neighbor's hand hello Bible bride Bible bride good to see you Bible bride oh look at what he says the Bible bride not some man-made bride the Bible bride and then watch as he goes smitten and Afflicted of God who is the Bible bride but I thought that was Jesus but today it's him in his body called the Bible bride and Afflicted of God I don't know why this is smitten and AFF no beauty that we should desire her but yet we did esteem her fitten and Afflicted of God that's right she stands alone she is SM from all the denomination to Revelations three smitten out of the lean church that she was raised up in that became a prison she was raised up in the prison house you see but now she stands alone like the bridegroom rejected of men despised and rejected of the churches the bride stands that way what is it it's his Masterpiece see it's the word that he can work through make manifest rejecting how many of you ever felt rejected all the time but that's okay that's her she just like her hubby she's just like the bridegroom the Holiness of the scripture brother will if you come stop now but but the Holiness of the scripture once again impregnates the parable wow this Holiness called us to a life of Holiness to a people of Holiness this Holiness breathes in Prophecy it thunders in the law yet it Whispers In The Promise it supplicates in the prayers it sparkles in the Poetry it resounds in the songs speaks in the types glows in the imagery voices in the language Burns in the spirit and it challenges in the parable as you stand to your feet this is the great parable once again this is the great Parable and it is his story in future ages now is present time what a God we serve do you love him I said do you love him I just I just want to want to thank him and praise him today and I just get ourselves ready for for this week coming weekend we want to be ready we want to bring our lights so we're going to join you with other parts of the body we can have this big light and the parable can continue you don't have to be in prison no more he already made a way out sent an angel to open the door for you do open this morning just always

here with the pastor I was like what why am I coming up but anyhow uh I had actually asked uh this morning to give you guys a testimony on a Friday the Lord had given me a revelation that I hadn't even been aware of which I guess is what a revelation is but anyhow I had a I had written a song Last year around the time of August and it was called the end time Carol and uh as a writer you know if I'm being honest with you guys sometimes when I write things I have no idea what I'm talking about but you trust in the inspiration you see where the Lord takes it so anyhow I wrote this song and again this is August and I wanted to read you guys the lyrics because of nowhere the Lord told me to listen to the song on Friday and remember this is a Christmas song okay I'm like Christmas songs in March all [Music] right so I I listened to it and I heard these lyrics I want to just read them for you because I didn't even know what they meant when when I wrote them but I realized what they meant after the preachings that our pastors been bringing these past couple of weeks it's going to get a little Christmassy but I'm just going to read it and just listen to the words like in Pros it goes it was on that night God's lamb was sent to man in nowhere's manger deep in [Music] Bethlehem a cave of dark hid that great gift of light his only son those chosen he ignites recall the U tide day uh when Christ the holy came I don't know what yultide would be in Spanish from being honest to Live to Die to Save a tomb across a babe sing praises of his name carols and and Gifts Proclaim born to die he did rise he's coming back again this is where things got really crazy for me the cross ran red the trees were soaked in blood the Lion's cometh like a flood redeemed and saved we serve the highest King one and all be found Zion's Bells now ring return Noel again the world with Satan reign Heaven and Earth proclaim the great terrible day Messiah returns with flames only he'll remain bride of Christ though who are those who are saved bride with him the same and from that point on there's just a bunch of Hallelujah so that's all I wanted to share but God bless [Applause] youen God bless his
