[37:30] wonderful thing this morning
[37:34] amen I have kind of a little strange
[37:36] subject
[37:37] it's very very simple
[37:41] we should know these things
[37:44] sometimes a reminder is is good
[37:48] but but I as you can see there where do
[37:51] you stand number six
[37:54] subtitle and God remembered
[37:57] and God forgot is
[38:01] I want to preach this message I I think
[38:04] it's thought provoking
[38:07] but the central idea of this message is
[38:11] this
[38:13] can our God that
[38:18] is omniscient
[38:21] that knows all things
[38:23] that is eternal
[38:26] can that thought
[38:28] or that mind
[38:30] forget is
[38:33] how is that possible
[38:36] that that mind could actually forget
[38:39] and at the same token that mind can
[38:43] remember
[38:46] let's see what the Holy Spirit has to
[38:49] tell us today
[38:50] ready to go into the word amen
[38:56] Philippians the second chapter and the
[38:58] fifth verse Cinco
[39:07] have it you can say man this thing
[39:09] working yeah
[39:16] it reads like this let
[39:19] this mind be in you
[39:27] which was also
[39:30] in Christ Jesus Christ
[39:33] Jesus that's good stuff we could we
[39:37] could we could leave church today and be
[39:39] satisfied
[39:41] let this mind be in use turn around to
[39:46] your neighbors a neighbor let this mind
[39:48] be in you
[39:51] turn to the other side and tell your
[39:53] other neighbor
[39:55] let this mind be in you
[40:00] first Corinthians chapter 2 and verse
[40:03] 16. we made according
[40:06] what the clock is at all righty
[40:10] second First Corinthians chapter 2 verse
[40:13] 16 says
[40:16] yes he says for who hath known the mind
[40:20] of the Lord
[40:23] the question
[40:25] who hath known the mind of the Lord that
[40:30] he may instruct him
[40:33] this is
[40:38] but we have
[40:40] the mind of Christ
[40:44] I want everybody to repeat after me but
[40:47] we have
[40:49] the mind of Christ
[40:51] good to see brother Jacinto sister
[40:53] Maggie and sister Dory God bless you
[40:55] also that are here amen we have the mind
[40:58] of Christ tell your neighbor now
[41:00] we have the mind of Christ you believe
[41:04] that though raise your hand
[41:06] amen you may be seated may God add His
[41:10] blessings to the reading of his word
[41:14] and uh we ask that God would give us our
[41:17] daily bread
[41:20] and according to the scriptures that we
[41:23] have just read
[41:25] the mind of Christ
[41:28] is the only access
[41:32] ISO that we have into the mind of the
[41:34] Lord
[41:36] can I get a witness
[41:39] you cannot even begin to comprehend the
[41:43] mind of God
[41:47] without first receiving the mind of
[41:50] Christ
[41:51] how you say brother is that the same
[41:54] thing it should be the same thing
[41:56] in one sense it is
[41:59] but in another sense it's a
[42:01] dispensational thing
[42:04] now now how many of you enjoyed that on
[42:07] Wednesdays
[42:09] what a wonderful panel it was
[42:14] enjoyed that how these portals and my
[42:16] goodness
[42:17] and there's there's so much more so so
[42:20] panel panel gentlemen we're gonna have
[42:22] to have another one because that one can
[42:24] keep on going for some time
[42:27] we just barely got the surface through
[42:29] the surface of that one but man that
[42:31] that can get deep in a hurry
[42:34] therefore the human being
[42:38] now that includes me and you the human
[42:41] being has been the privilege
[42:45] to enter in and know and have the mind
[42:50] of Christ
[42:52] how many deemed that a privilege this
[42:54] morning
[42:55] let me see your hands to make sure that
[42:57] you're all awake this morning
[42:59] okay okay it is the ultimate privilege
[43:03] to have the mind of Christ
[43:07] because that's the only once again the
[43:10] only access is
[43:12] we have to this great
[43:15] Eternal omniscient Mind Of God
[43:18] so the mind of Christ
[43:21] can only come into a
[43:24] Persona that has died out to themselves
[43:28] no other way will you get the mind of
[43:31] Christ
[43:33] because the holy spirit
[43:36] is the mind of Christ and if you don't
[43:40] receive the Holy Spirit
[43:42] you can never have the mind of Christ
[43:46] the Bible tells us or brother Branham
[43:49] actually says this
[43:50] that all that God was he poured it into
[43:54] Christ
[44:05] so Christ had the power
[44:09] that God had is
[44:12] and the church has the power
[44:16] that Christ has
[44:18] yes or yes
[44:20] we all have to agree with this before we
[44:23] can go on
[44:25] so so understanding then
[44:29] when the mind of Christ comes into your
[44:32] heart
[44:34] it's simple it's simply then you'll
[44:37] think like he thinks
[44:40] did you get that say it again because we
[44:43] got to build this Foundation this
[44:45] morning
[44:46] when the mind of Christ comes into your
[44:49] heart
[44:51] then you'll think just like he thinks
[44:58] amen I want to know how many believe
[45:00] that this morning
[45:03] because a lot of times we talk and
[45:05] that's not what the word says
[45:08] we think things and that's not what the
[45:10] word says
[45:17] according to what his mind says
[45:21] every time I pick up a book
[45:24] I listened to a message
[45:27] it's the mind of Christ speaking to me
[45:31] how many know that how many want to know
[45:34] what's in the mind of Christ
[45:41] you'll know what's in the mind of Christ
[45:45] do we really believe that or not
[45:48] then why don't we do it like we should
[45:53] we're okay with filling ourselves with
[45:56] what Hollywood has to say is
[45:59] Kay was feeling ourselves with what the
[46:02] world is saying
[46:04] but why aren't we feeling ourselves with
[46:07] what Christ is saying
[46:10] so then the question is
[46:14] do we really think like Christ thinks
[46:20] that's a good question this morning
[46:23] things happen we freak out
[46:27] don't think that way
[46:31] I was talking to to one of the men here
[46:33] brother Al yesterday
[46:35] and he was telling me some things that
[46:37] he was going through
[46:40] and when he left
[46:42] I finished up and we we had met there at
[46:45] the car wash
[46:46] car wash and brother Al as as you as as
[46:49] I left the car wash
[46:52] the holy spirit says
[46:57] I am pleased
[46:59] wanted me to tell you that brother
[47:02] because as we were he was talking he
[47:04] said now I could have fought this way
[47:08] but I thought this way instead
[47:11] like this and I said wow and then me I
[47:16] said I I can I could understand when
[47:18] when the holy spirit says tell him I'm I
[47:21] I am very proud of him
[47:27] there is nothing greater Church than
[47:30] when you know that Christ is pleased
[47:32] with you
[47:34] when you could have done something or
[47:37] made a decision
[47:40] based on Greed or based on on your
[47:43] feelings
[47:45] but you made a decision based on God's
[47:48] words
[47:52] so as we as we unfold this this message
[47:56] this morning
[47:59] how can I think like
[48:03] Christo if I don't have his spirit in me
[48:06] that's producing those thoughts
[48:10] it's why there is so much frictions in
[48:13] the church foreign
[49:27] it is the mind of Christ being voiced
[49:30] out
[49:36] the prophet is the voice of God to us
[49:42] if that Pastor in Ministry
[49:45] don't say what the prophet said I didn't
[49:48] say just repeat no no no no
[49:51] say what he said
[49:54] if they don't they're off the word
[49:58] how many believe in the faithful
[50:00] Ministry
[50:01] how many believe that that Satan also
[50:04] has a faithful ministerio
[50:09] he also has pastors
[50:11] an evangelistas
[50:16] teachers maestros prophets prophetas
[50:20] apostolis he has them all too and they
[50:23] speak very similar in a lot of things
[50:27] but notice this now where
[50:30] we're we're wanting to know more about
[50:33] this mind this great mind
[50:36] this great mind that is
[50:39] omniscientism we can we can sit the rest
[50:42] of our lives in church
[50:47] Nobody Knows the mind of God
[50:50] that's absurd that somebody would know
[50:53] it
[50:54] it's absurd that it has been open and we
[50:57] don't understand or know it okay
[51:00] that's what's up that is it's opened
[51:04] right to us
[51:05] we don't want that
[51:08] one of the smartest men in the 20th
[51:11] century
[51:12] everybody has heard of him no matter
[51:15] where you go
[51:16] we were in Israel with all these
[51:19] paintings of Einstein
[51:22] where you go everybody knows Einsteins
[51:25] well it was in Israel because everyone
[51:28] know that Einstein was a Jew right
[51:31] there in Israel he's well known
[51:35] he was actually they had pointed him
[51:37] wanted him to become the president of of
[51:39] Israel
[51:42] and of course he refused but he was not
[51:46] he didn't consider himself an atheist
[51:50] he considered himself an agnostic
[51:54] and he did however
[51:57] believed that there was a God
[52:00] he was The Mastermind behind all
[52:04] creations
[52:06] and he made this statement
[52:39] the brains of the world
[52:43] but we don't try to use our brains
[52:47] we left the mind that was in Christ be
[52:51] in us
[52:53] now now brother Branham he has some good
[52:56] things to say about Einstein
[52:59] Christ is revealed in his own word
[53:04] he says this if Einstein this is the
[53:07] Einstein had only had of the spiritual
[53:10] applications
[53:12] as he had the physical applications
[53:17] as he studied the laws of light
[53:21] he could have told us something
[53:26] once again he could have told us
[53:28] something
[53:30] when I heard his message brother Brahm
[53:33] says
[53:35] on that great Center somewhere into the
[53:38] skies
[53:40] that if it was ever contacted
[53:44] you make contact with that Center
[53:48] you could create Earth
[53:53] you could do anything
[53:56] and the power would be unlimited
[54:01] if only he could have applied what he
[54:04] knew in the physical
[54:06] application
[54:07] to the spirituals
[54:10] my question is
[54:13] what was Einstein's error de Einstein
[54:19] I have to know this thing I I ask these
[54:22] questions even to myself but these
[54:24] questions come I got to know the answers
[54:27] because if they made an error somewhere
[54:31] they could not take the physical and
[54:34] apply it to the spirit
[54:37] I don't want to make the same
[54:39] errorism I don't stand where I'm coming
[54:42] from I don't want us to make the same
[54:43] error
[54:44] why couldn't he apply what he knew to
[54:47] the spirituals
[54:50] let you think about that person
[54:52] what kept Him from applying it in the
[54:55] spiritual Realms here
[55:01] anybody want to answer I'll let you
[55:03] answer today
[55:10] okay
[55:11] he was using the wrong mind that's
[55:12] that's true he was using his brains
[55:14] brother branstead instead of mind of
[55:15] Christ
[55:20] he didn't have a new birth
[55:22] all those things are part of the answer
[55:26] which brings us to the the the the the
[55:29] answer
[55:31] because he didn't believe in a personal
[55:35] God
[55:37] now that's that's his that's his words
[55:43] I don't believe in a personal God
[55:48] who concerns himself
[55:51] with faith
[55:54] and actions of human beings
[55:58] that's naive
[56:01] this is Einstein the brains
[56:04] it's naive to think that he's a personal
[56:08] God
[56:11] and because he wasn't interested in the
[56:15] details what Einstein said okay
[57:13] if you
[57:18] don't believe in a personal God personal
[57:22] you can't believe in predestination
[57:27] you can't believe in calling an election
[57:32] you can't believe in destiny and
[57:35] foreknowledge
[57:38] these are the details
[57:42] I want to say this morning
[57:44] that I believe in a personal God okay
[57:48] I don't know about you but tell your
[57:50] neighbors say neighbor I believe in a
[57:53] personal God
[57:55] you believe see I believe in a personal
[57:58] God
[57:59] I believe in having a personal
[58:02] relationship
[58:04] I believe in a God
[58:07] that cares about us
[58:10] and has laid out a plan for you and I
[58:14] plan for me it's called The Plan of
[58:17] Redemption
[58:19] and that's why I believe that we come to
[58:22] church
[58:23] because we want to know more about his
[58:27] thoughts or towards us
[58:30] at least that's why I come to church
[58:35] so this is why where we get into our
[58:37] message now
[58:39] let's see how personal our God is
[58:45] how many want to go with me
[58:47] let's see how personal promise get some
[58:51] personalities Genesis chapter 8 and
[58:54] verse 1.
[58:58] just the first
[59:00] or
[59:01] words
[59:06] and God remembered
[59:11] it don't get no more personal than that
[59:15] put your name there
[59:17] God remembered Caleb
[59:21] God remember AJ yawning in church
[59:30] and God remembered
[59:33] calebster come on you got to say it
[59:36] again put your name there
[59:37] God remembered
[59:40] that's a personal God personal
[59:44] I'm going to say it again that's a
[59:46] personal God
[59:48] and God remembered Dory
[59:52] yes he did come on now
[1:00:17] that thinks about us
[1:00:22] I don't know but that excites me this
[1:00:24] morning
[1:00:26] what condition you're in this morning
[1:00:29] you could get the Revelation
[1:00:33] that the god of Glory yeah
[1:00:37] he didn't just thought about you way
[1:00:40] back then
[1:00:41] he's still thinking about it
[1:00:46] this is something that I don't ever want
[1:00:49] to overlook
[1:00:54] let's stop for a minute and understand
[1:00:56] the word remember here
[1:01:01] remembers the word zakar
[1:01:04] it means to remember our call to mind
[1:01:09] it also means to properly Mark is
[1:01:13] so that it is easily to recognize
[1:01:17] to
[1:01:21] think on
[1:01:23] and God thought is your spend so no way
[1:01:30] you're getting it
[1:01:34] when our name is mentioned
[1:01:38] he knows who we are
[1:01:44] you guys aren't excited are you excited
[1:01:46] brother Moses
[1:01:48] what about you my brother excited
[1:01:53] when God
[1:01:55] thinks about you smiling
[1:02:00] vehicle
[1:02:04] come on you excited
[1:02:08] you excited
[1:02:10] okay smile at me so I know you're
[1:02:13] excited buddy
[1:02:18] all right
[1:02:19] how about you sisters over there
[1:02:23] good
[1:02:25] remember remember
[1:02:30] when our name is mentioned he knows who
[1:02:33] you are
[1:02:34] we are Mark Thomas so that we are
[1:02:39] that he easily recognizes us
[1:02:43] and thinks about us
[1:02:45] the word remember in the dictionary
[1:02:49] is to have or keep an image in your
[1:02:52] memory of an event is
[1:03:00] or be able to bring to one's mind
[1:03:04] an awareness of someone or something
[1:03:09] now in order for us to remember
[1:03:11] something or someone
[1:03:14] they have to have been out of our
[1:03:17] immediate thinking
[1:03:23] you remember all of a sudden you get a
[1:03:25] phone oh I haven't I don't I hadn't
[1:03:28] heard from that that person for a long
[1:03:30] time
[1:03:33] with that person yeah
[1:03:36] I hadn't thought about them in years
[1:03:39] that's so that's the way we remember
[1:03:42] because we've been busy doing things
[1:03:46] other things happening in his life
[1:03:49] but with God that's not the way he views
[1:03:53] it
[1:03:54] there is not a moment that we are out of
[1:03:57] his mind
[1:03:59] I don't know about you but
[1:04:02] I fall in love with him more every time
[1:04:07] I'm gonna say it again there is not a
[1:04:10] moment that you are out of his mind
[1:04:14] oh I hadn't thought about about brother
[1:04:16] Emilio for a while oh I remembered
[1:04:19] brother Emilio oh this is
[1:04:22] not with God no condios no and that's
[1:04:26] why in order to understand the mind of
[1:04:28] Christ
[1:04:30] we must first get rid of our thinking
[1:04:34] this is where the question of the day is
[1:04:37] derived from
[1:04:41] how can an infinite Infinity
[1:05:08] it don't seem like it's possible
[1:05:11] then how can an infinite Eternal mind
[1:05:20] of something or someone
[1:05:22] if it doesn't forget
[1:05:26] we tend to think of remembering
[1:05:29] simply as a mental activity
[1:05:35] you got to get all these things to know
[1:05:37] where we're going this is
[1:05:40] to think of remembering
[1:05:45] as a mental activity
[1:05:48] that is triggered
[1:05:54] by something or someone's input
[1:05:58] for example
[1:06:01] our attention span today is not very
[1:06:03] good
[1:06:07] is that anybody here
[1:06:09] it doesn't even matter if you're young
[1:06:11] or old anymore
[1:06:13] that's they're getting old they forget
[1:06:17] our young people are forgetting more
[1:06:19] than the old people
[1:06:23] do this do this before you go hi guys
[1:06:26] how come you didn't do it I forgot
[1:06:29] foreign
[1:07:07] wow that's right
[1:07:10] oh I forgot the Frijoles right
[1:07:13] it's the smoke in the air
[1:07:16] and oh I forgot I left the stove on
[1:07:21] the light comes on in the garden
[1:07:24] I forgot to put gas yesterday
[1:07:28] did you call the brother for his
[1:07:29] birthday oh I forgot what it's our our
[1:07:33] memories being triggered by something
[1:07:38] I'm remembering forget and forgetting
[1:07:42] to us in our finite Minds that are
[1:07:45] intertwined together
[1:07:48] but when we talk about the mind of God
[1:07:53] remembering and forgetting according
[1:07:56] it's not simply a mental activity no
[1:08:00] it's implemented
[1:08:02] come on now I'm trying to get you to see
[1:08:05] things on a different on a different
[1:08:06] level
[1:08:08] with God he doesn't need some kind of
[1:08:11] input to remember
[1:08:15] to God the word remember
[1:08:19] not just a mental activity
[1:08:23] it is or focuses on the action okay
[1:08:29] now that might not make a lot of sense
[1:08:31] to you but let me just tell you the way
[1:08:34] the Hebrews understand the word
[1:08:38] when it says that God remembered Noah
[1:08:45] um
[1:08:46] here we go us
[1:08:49] if this would have been us I forgot
[1:08:54] here I am doing all this over here
[1:08:57] no one's in the middle of a flood with a
[1:09:00] bunch of animals
[1:09:04] no no no God that's not the way that
[1:09:07] God's mind works
[1:09:09] oh we gotta get these things now
[1:09:11] straightened out
[1:09:13] no God when he remembered Noah
[1:09:17] it means that he was acting Faithfully
[1:09:23] fell upon his promise to his promise us
[1:09:27] to protect and deliver his seeds
[1:09:33] so when we read that God remembered
[1:09:36] it simply means that God is on the scene
[1:09:42] present and ready for actions
[1:09:46] oh my it's totally different now it's
[1:09:49] not he remember oh no oh shoot I got to
[1:09:52] go make sure Noah's okay
[1:09:55] God remembered and it means he's there
[1:10:02] I got you it is
[1:10:06] hello everybody
[1:10:08] and we think so many things the wrong
[1:10:10] way
[1:10:11] so that's why I said and God remember
[1:10:14] put your name
[1:10:16] what is he saying God remembered Caleb
[1:10:20] simply means that God is present in my
[1:10:23] life
[1:10:29] that has been deposited in my soul
[1:10:33] this is what it's supposed to produce
[1:10:39] cares about the details
[1:10:43] you're getting it
[1:10:45] so can God remember
[1:10:48] absolutely absolutely and God forget
[1:10:54] oh
[1:10:56] we're going down the line here because
[1:10:58] we're getting to something here
[1:11:00] can God forget them
[1:11:03] the title of my message and God
[1:11:05] remembered
[1:11:08] thank God for God is yourself let's see
[1:11:11] if God forgets
[1:11:13] what it really means to forget is here
[1:11:19] Jeremiah 23 39.
[1:11:24] haremias
[1:11:25] I'm there with me this morning
[1:11:28] let's let's learn this
[1:11:31] have a greater mind Amazon
[1:11:34] therefore behold I
[1:11:37] even I
[1:11:39] would utterly
[1:11:47] and I will forsake you
[1:11:50] and the city that I gave you
[1:11:53] fathers and cast out of my friends
[1:12:03] when we speak about forgetting
[1:12:06] we automatically think about the mental
[1:12:10] capacity of a person
[1:12:14] if one has dementia or Alzheimer's
[1:12:17] dementia Alzheimer's then the ability to
[1:12:20] remember things begins to
[1:12:22] diminished forget things
[1:12:26] and many times they can remember things
[1:12:28] from years and years ago
[1:12:32] they have a hard time remembering
[1:12:34] day-to-day things
[1:12:38] can have short-term or long-term memory
[1:12:40] loss
[1:12:44] considered forgetting
[1:12:47] but you see when God says
[1:12:50] I will utterly forget you this is
[1:12:54] not in any way that his memory is
[1:12:57] diminishing
[1:12:59] that's not the way the Hebrews
[1:13:02] understand it
[1:13:04] means that he will ignore you okay
[1:13:12] it means that
[1:13:13] you'll have no regards for you
[1:13:17] that you'll be deprived of his presence
[1:13:27] that's the word forget it
[1:13:31] God is saying I will utterly forget you
[1:13:36] that's why when the children of Israel
[1:13:41] God would forgive them
[1:13:44] no not put them out of his mind
[1:13:47] completely
[1:13:49] but he would forsake them for a moment
[1:13:53] the enemy will come in here because they
[1:13:57] had no protection
[1:13:58] they will conquer them
[1:14:01] but when they repented
[1:14:04] he would remember his Covenant
[1:14:08] he would remember the Covenant that he
[1:14:10] had with his people
[1:14:13] and he would come on the scene
[1:14:16] and we'll deliver them see
[1:14:27] step to the side for a moment yeah and
[1:14:30] then we're saying Lord why
[1:14:32] Lord where are you Lord I pray and I
[1:14:36] don't get an answer
[1:14:37] call him back on the scene repentance
[1:14:45] oh
[1:14:50] but let that one sit in oh that one that
[1:14:53] one like oh
[1:14:59] you talk too much repentance
[1:15:02] and you think things you shouldn't
[1:15:04] repentance
[1:15:05] they'll remember you that means he'll
[1:15:09] come on the scene
[1:15:11] amen watch this now you see God's mercy
[1:15:14] and Grace has been extended
[1:15:17] but there comes a time when mercy has
[1:15:20] been exhausted
[1:15:23] and then God will remember all the sins
[1:15:26] and iniquities
[1:15:28] that has been accumulated
[1:15:31] because of our lack of repentance
[1:15:36] Revelations 18 tells us
[1:15:39] and I heard another voice from Heaven
[1:15:42] saying come out of her my people
[1:15:45] yes
[1:15:47] be not partakers of our sins
[1:15:51] and that ye received not of her plagues
[1:15:58] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[1:16:02] and God hath remembered her iniquities
[1:16:07] God can only remember sins and
[1:16:10] iniquities that have not been confessed
[1:16:15] and when he says he'll remember her
[1:16:18] iniquities
[1:16:21] it means that he is present and in
[1:16:24] action again
[1:16:26] bring punishment and revenge upon those
[1:16:31] that were against his word and his
[1:16:34] people
[1:16:38] he remembers her iniquities
[1:16:42] it's time for judgment now
[1:16:46] when God remembers
[1:16:50] but to his people that have confessed
[1:16:52] their sins
[1:16:54] washed in the blood of the Lamb yes
[1:16:57] that's what he says
[1:17:00] Hebrews 10 17 and 18.
[1:17:04] and their sins
[1:17:06] and iniquities
[1:17:09] I remember no more
[1:17:16] now where remission of these is
[1:17:19] there is no more offering for sin
[1:17:23] and when he says I'll remember your sins
[1:17:26] and iniquities no more
[1:17:29] it means that there is nothing in his
[1:17:33] mind
[1:17:35] nothing to grasp nothing to Bear there
[1:17:40] is no punishment there is no
[1:17:42] condemnation
[1:17:43] for those things that have been remitted
[1:17:48] I'll remember your sins no more
[1:17:52] oh my goodness
[1:17:54] Church
[1:17:56] I get sick and tired
[1:18:00] of Satan constantly
[1:18:04] accusing God
[1:18:08] it gets old to me
[1:18:13] constantly reminding us of our failures
[1:18:19] our sins our transgressions
[1:18:23] it's time we learn how to fight back
[1:18:28] in contrast
[1:18:30] come on church I speak to people after
[1:18:33] people whether here or abroad wherever I
[1:18:36] go
[1:18:38] and it's the same thing yes I just can't
[1:18:41] get over the things I've done this is
[1:18:46] am I talking to anybody here
[1:18:49] am I talking to anybody here
[1:18:55] let me see your hands I mean you really
[1:18:57] I'm not going to get over things coming
[1:19:00] back coming back I don't know how to
[1:19:02] fight it
[1:20:01] let's start fighting him with the word
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:38] there's a constant struggle everybody
[1:20:43] we struggle with so many things
[1:20:46] we struggle with how to deal with
[1:20:49] someone that has hurt us
[1:20:52] am I talking to anybody
[1:20:55] we struggle to deal with those that
[1:20:57] speak evil of us
[1:21:01] hello everybody
[1:21:03] that's I don't care who you are you're
[1:21:05] not exempt from them
[1:21:07] whether you say Amen or not it's not
[1:21:10] neither here nor there it is
[1:21:12] and we struggle with how to deal with a
[1:21:15] person
[1:21:16] that has hurt us Time and Time and Time
[1:21:20] the author asks
[1:21:23] does forgiveness mean
[1:21:26] that we should act like it never
[1:21:28] happened
[1:21:30] in order to try and get over it
[1:21:33] that's the way people deal with things
[1:21:36] nowadays
[1:21:38] like it never happened
[1:21:41] no there is no repentance
[1:21:44] there's no repentance there's no
[1:21:47] confession and I confessions
[1:21:52] but every time we see that person
[1:21:56] is activated in US hello
[1:22:00] something is activated
[1:22:03] all the bad feelings memories
[1:22:17] foreign
[1:22:39] here we are
[1:22:41] and we come hello in Nemos
[1:22:45] we're gonna
[1:22:46] have these people over
[1:22:48] and then
[1:22:50] um
[1:22:51] we're thinking of every reason why
[1:22:54] kind of excuse can I come up with
[1:22:57] um
[1:23:03] nobody does
[1:23:06] you're giving it away because you're so
[1:23:08] quiet
[1:23:10] it's reading my mind I'm not a mind
[1:23:14] reader no no but I dealt with too many
[1:23:16] people
[1:23:17] and I'm here to tell you yeah
[1:23:20] how do we know when we've truly forgiven
[1:23:23] someone
[1:23:27] say yo
[1:23:32] and
[1:23:33] my mind you did that just to say faith
[1:23:37] but how do I know when I've really
[1:23:39] forgiven my brothers
[1:23:42] when we no longer seek revenge
[1:23:46] or punishment
[1:23:52] wait till you have your kids
[1:23:59] to pay for what you did you want revenge
[1:24:03] you want punishments not the mind of
[1:24:06] Christ
[1:24:09] hello everybody
[1:24:10] when I don't desire that for my brothers
[1:24:14] and I know that I've begun the
[1:24:17] Forgiveness of the forgiving process
[1:24:24] does God remember does God forget
[1:24:28] when we forgive a person
[1:24:31] it takes work to forgive a person
[1:24:35] I'm giving you the tools so that you can
[1:24:37] overcome these Devils
[1:24:41] they said this or they did this
[1:24:44] I'm going to say it again it takes work
[1:24:47] to forgive
[1:24:50] [Applause]
[1:24:53] here's the misconception of the mind of
[1:24:56] God
[1:24:58] oh God he just says takes it puts it in
[1:25:01] the sea of forgetfulness
[1:25:05] right that's the way he's God's
[1:25:07] all-powerful
[1:25:09] praise God listen listen closely because
[1:25:11] we're getting to the good part of them
[1:25:15] God can just take it and put it in the
[1:25:17] field
[1:25:19] and then we're free
[1:25:22] no no it don't work like that just so
[1:25:26] that you understand
[1:25:28] before you hurt someone
[1:25:30] there's a process do things right
[1:25:36] you don't want to have to go back and
[1:25:38] try to amend these things
[1:25:42] closer to this because this is this is
[1:25:45] where the message we're coming to now
[1:25:48] it takes time to forgive them
[1:25:55] to overcome those thoughts and memories
[1:26:03] they'll always come at us
[1:26:06] until we learn how to forget
[1:26:12] and to forget is not so easy
[1:26:17] but the only way to really forget
[1:26:22] only through love
[1:26:25] why do you think that brother Brown says
[1:26:28] nothing short of perfect love will be
[1:26:30] there
[1:26:33] why do you think the Bible says that the
[1:26:37] love of many will work
[1:26:40] yeah it's wax so cold nowadays
[1:26:44] that they don't know how to forgive
[1:26:45] anymore
[1:26:49] you can't forgive without love nope
[1:26:59] it takes more love
[1:27:03] to choose
[1:27:05] not to remember something
[1:27:09] to seek punishment or Revenge
[1:27:13] it takes more love
[1:27:16] once again to choose not to remember
[1:27:19] something
[1:27:21] then if we could just erase it from our
[1:27:24] minds and be done with it
[1:27:29] we all wish we could do that at times
[1:27:37] you're not willing to go through the
[1:27:39] processo
[1:27:42] oh we're gonna get something good right
[1:27:44] now I'm gonna say yeah
[1:27:47] in our finite Minds
[1:27:50] once again we think God just takes our
[1:27:54] sins
[1:27:59] no no there was a process to that
[1:28:04] you say well these thoughts and memories
[1:28:06] come at me constantly
[1:28:08] yes but we're always trying to deal with
[1:28:11] them
[1:28:13] with our finite carnal minds
[1:28:16] and our carnal finite Minds cannot
[1:28:20] forget anything
[1:28:23] talking about when it comes to what
[1:28:24] people did do to you
[1:28:28] then how does God
[1:28:31] how does God do it
[1:28:33] when Satan is constantly
[1:28:37] every day follows the accusing us before
[1:28:40] him
[1:28:44] look what they did
[1:28:46] Supermarket
[1:28:49] look what they did yeah God's standing
[1:28:52] there what is he doing the process has
[1:28:56] already has already been a process of
[1:28:59] Justified
[1:29:01] oh Church you gotta get this this is the
[1:29:03] message
[1:29:05] when we try to do it
[1:29:08] the way we fail
[1:29:11] but when we do it the way that God does
[1:29:15] Satan is constantly reminding him
[1:29:20] mystery here for you and I I Mysterio if
[1:29:24] we can get into his mind
[1:29:26] and understand the process to forget
[1:29:30] and through the holy ghosts more
[1:29:40] we're gonna bring it closer now
[1:29:43] this is our personal God is personal
[1:29:46] this is our personal God who Einstein
[1:29:49] didn't know
[1:29:51] and as smart as he was important knew
[1:29:55] nothing about this
[1:29:57] can a human being remind God of
[1:29:59] something
[1:30:04] come on
[1:30:06] can a human being remind God of
[1:30:08] something
[1:30:12] amen amen
[1:30:14] here David is remembering his youthful
[1:30:16] years
[1:30:18] he's probably writing this Psalm El
[1:30:22] Perales
[1:30:23] during the time that Absalon his son
[1:30:27] was rebelling against him
[1:30:30] and in Psalms 25 6.
[1:30:34] David simply says remember
[1:30:39] oh Lord
[1:30:41] a human being telling God remember
[1:30:47] remember thy Tender Mercies and thy
[1:30:49] loving kindnesses
[1:30:53] for they have been ever of old
[1:30:56] does God forget so he has to be reminded
[1:31:01] no no when a Son of God asked God to
[1:31:05] remember
[1:31:06] it is with all humility
[1:31:09] that he is asking him
[1:31:12] come on the scene in their time of
[1:31:14] trouble
[1:31:16] remember Lord thy Tender Mercies
[1:31:22] and after asking God to come on the
[1:31:24] scene
[1:31:26] David then asked God to forget something
[1:31:30] and remember not the sins of Mike
[1:31:35] oh how many of you this morning can just
[1:31:38] say that Lord remember not the sins of
[1:31:41] my youths
[1:31:44] aggressions
[1:31:45] how can
[1:32:06] to ask God to wipe his sins from his
[1:32:10] mind
[1:32:14] I don't know if you get that or not but
[1:32:17] this is not this is before the Messiah
[1:32:19] came
[1:32:20] this is before the Lamb of God came
[1:32:23] he knew it was coming
[1:32:26] and he's asking God not just to wipe his
[1:32:29] sins away
[1:32:31] to wipe them from his mind
[1:32:37] is it even possible
[1:32:40] that an infinite all-knowing God okay
[1:32:48] who knows the beginning from the end
[1:32:52] and knows all your sins
[1:32:54] and all our iniquities
[1:32:58] and our transgressions to actually
[1:33:01] forget them
[1:33:04] is that possible it's a mind that knows
[1:33:07] everything
[1:33:09] to finally forget something
[1:33:14] where did David get that thought from
[1:33:18] I'm reading this it floored me yesterday
[1:33:23] where did David get that thought from
[1:33:27] the thought that our sins could be
[1:33:30] forgotten
[1:33:36] be justified with God
[1:33:40] that's not an everyday thoughts
[1:33:47] something from God's mind could be
[1:33:49] removed
[1:33:57] you have a spiritual cap you know where
[1:33:59] I'm going with it
[1:34:02] our founding Pastor in the message
[1:34:05] Physicians
[1:34:10] only God has the power to forget
[1:34:15] all right
[1:34:17] if that power stayed in God
[1:34:21] I would not be an heir with God
[1:34:29] everything that God is
[1:34:31] he poured it into Christ everything
[1:34:40] so he had the faculty
[1:34:45] everything that Christ was
[1:34:48] he poured it into the church
[1:34:51] and one of the things he poured in
[1:34:54] was the power to forget
[1:34:59] and it's got to be in his church now
[1:35:05] David knew it was going to come
[1:35:09] inspiration
[1:35:11] that's why he says God
[1:35:14] justify me at some point
[1:35:19] I know you can do that
[1:35:21] he was waiting for that Redeemer to come
[1:35:26] why don't we see it in action the church
[1:35:29] today
[1:35:30] because the love of many has wax codes
[1:35:35] no justification
[1:35:37] then there has to be a process
[1:35:41] whereby we're not only
[1:35:44] forgivenado we're Justified
[1:35:47] that process of justification listen
[1:35:50] closely to this and that process of
[1:35:53] justification
[1:35:55] not only for The Sinner
[1:35:58] it is also for the Savior
[1:36:01] I don't know if you get that but I'm
[1:36:03] going to say it again
[1:36:05] is of justification
[1:36:07] because not just for the Sinners
[1:36:10] for the Savior
[1:36:13] justifies The Sinner
[1:36:16] not the same process
[1:36:19] wipes it from his mind
[1:36:22] there is nothing there ever
[1:36:25] what you and I did
[1:36:28] listen to this now this we got to get
[1:36:30] this now
[1:36:31] let's see how his mind works now
[1:36:35] I want the morning Stars sang together
[1:36:39] when they sing together and the sons of
[1:36:43] God shouted for Joy
[1:36:45] way back before the foundation of the
[1:36:48] world
[1:36:49] how do we know that that wasn't at the
[1:36:54] same time
[1:36:55] that the lamb was slain
[1:36:59] and when God
[1:37:02] in his great things
[1:37:05] Cena shouting and rejoicing in our
[1:37:08] Salvation
[1:37:11] was through Jesus Christ Jesus you see
[1:37:16] he says then they say the book actually
[1:37:18] was planned
[1:37:22] the book actually was planned and
[1:37:25] written before the foundation of the
[1:37:27] world
[1:37:28] this book the Bible is
[1:37:31] really written before the foundation of
[1:37:34] the world
[1:37:37] being the lamb Christos was slain before
[1:37:41] the foundation of the world
[1:37:45] and the members of his bride
[1:37:49] their names were put in the Lamb's Book
[1:37:52] of Life whose number foreign
[1:38:00] and now it's being revealed
[1:38:04] whose names were
[1:39:05] Christo
[1:39:23] I'm gonna say it again
[1:39:49] now he says I've justified
[1:39:55] by the time it's manifested now
[1:40:00] Lord I I made a mistake
[1:40:03] says let me tell you that bride is not
[1:40:09] forgiving
[1:40:12] she's Justified hey yes
[1:40:16] he said that word Justified is
[1:40:22] because if I did something wrong
[1:40:24] and I correct it I can be forgiven but
[1:40:29] I'm not justified
[1:40:30] I'll always remember what I did
[1:40:33] but the Bride of
[1:40:36] Christopher
[1:40:38] says as if she never did it to begin
[1:40:44] she's Justified
[1:40:46] he never did it
[1:40:49] she was trapped into it
[1:40:56] sorry
[1:40:58] brother Branham and Emmanuel Branham
[1:41:00] this young lady she did this and this
[1:41:02] and this okay maybe God will show you
[1:41:04] something
[1:41:05] he prayed about it and they said did God
[1:41:09] show you something about it
[1:41:10] but he had repented he said nope there
[1:41:15] are some things that God won't even show
[1:41:17] his propheta
[1:41:21] and that's those things that have been
[1:41:23] confessed and placed under the blessings
[1:41:27] cannot show them to His prophets
[1:41:37] oh brother Diego I feel fantastic right
[1:41:40] now
[1:41:44] the word became flesh and dwelt amongst
[1:41:47] us
[1:41:48] the event began to unfolds
[1:41:54] justification in its fullness
[1:41:59] the process to justify us
[1:42:03] and when Jesus died
[1:42:21] now you get it Justified
[1:42:29] come on now you gotta fight get what I'm
[1:42:31] saying then again
[1:42:33] enemy with the word
[1:42:35] you remember you did this no he's
[1:42:38] Restless I never did it have been
[1:42:42] Justified how will you ever completely
[1:42:45] get a new purse
[1:42:49] understand what justification really is
[1:42:53] you understand it they've been Justified
[1:42:58] for the foundation of the world
[1:43:01] the fundamental foreign
[1:43:24] the process o he was wounded for our
[1:43:29] friends
[1:43:32] he was bruised Ferrari foreign
[1:44:02] you think he didn't go through a process
[1:44:04] so that he could forget
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:45:00] no man knows that but those that have
[1:45:03] his spirit
[1:45:06] my Lord I'm running out of time already
[1:45:09] who cares is right
[1:45:12] but the word justify
[1:45:14] as though you've never done it at all
[1:45:18] and then the blood of Jesus cleanses us
[1:45:22] from sins
[1:45:29] that's forgetfulness
[1:45:31] I didn't get that I'm sorry
[1:45:35] because we write things in a book
[1:45:39] remember things
[1:45:43] how many of you have a diary
[1:45:45] don't raise your hand
[1:45:48] Nobody Does that no more huh yeah of
[1:45:51] course not there's nothing to Daddy no
[1:45:52] more everything's on Facebook oh Stan
[1:45:54] Facebook
[1:45:55] check it out check it out what I'm doing
[1:45:58] there's no shame anymore there's no
[1:46:02] secret things yeah forget it don't even
[1:46:05] let me go we'll just we'll go off on a
[1:46:07] deep end over there
[1:46:10] we write things in a book
[1:46:14] and then I read brother Branham say that
[1:46:17] the Rapture
[1:46:19] it's put in the book
[1:46:22] of God's forgiveness
[1:46:27] and I said wow
[1:46:30] he said he's the only one that can do is
[1:46:35] I said Lord you put it in a book we
[1:46:38] think it was just be out there
[1:46:41] is
[1:46:59] that's not a good thought
[1:47:02] not that it's a bad thought either but
[1:47:05] so when you think about this put it into
[1:47:07] a book
[1:47:08] of the sea of forgetfulness
[1:47:11] I said wow
[1:47:14] the book of God's forgetfulness
[1:47:20] how he wipes it from his mind
[1:47:26] look
[1:47:27] at what he went through
[1:47:30] when I realized
[1:47:32] so easy
[1:47:34] you know what the book of God's
[1:47:36] forgetfulness is
[1:47:40] Jesus Christ
[1:47:43] the same book it's the same Lamb's Book
[1:47:46] of Life
[1:47:50] how does he how does he wipe it away
[1:47:54] puts it into the book what's the book
[1:47:57] Jesus Christ what does he do he makes a
[1:48:01] way for you to be in Christ and when you
[1:48:05] come in Christ
[1:48:10] the same as the drop of ink yes
[1:48:15] that when it hits the blood
[1:48:21] goes back to the elements
[1:48:24] nothing left of that ink
[1:48:27] church that he went through the process
[1:48:32] when we come into him
[1:48:37] say it again when we come to him
[1:48:40] and dwell in him it is sins being put
[1:48:45] into the sea of forgetfulness
[1:48:51] he pulls us back out of him
[1:48:55] say it again he pulls us back out of him
[1:48:59] says this is my bride now this is
[1:49:02] Justified
[1:49:05] accusing us
[1:49:08] because they don't know they didn't no
[1:49:11] no I don't know
[1:49:19] they are Justified fungus difficult
[1:49:24] placed in that books
[1:49:28] been a wonderful audience
[1:49:31] a few more minutes
[1:49:34] just make sure you guys are on your toes
[1:49:39] brother Branham says this is
[1:49:43] you say well let me tell you what
[1:49:45] brother Brandon says
[1:49:47] I'm hearing you message the Rapture is
[1:49:51] as humans we can forgive but not forget
[1:49:57] I can forgive you but I'll always
[1:50:00] remember that you've done these evil
[1:50:01] things
[1:50:03] and you're not just
[1:50:05] you're just forgivenando
[1:50:09] and I say
[1:50:10] go back and read it again as
[1:50:16] humans
[1:50:17] we can forgive
[1:50:22] I'm going to say it again as humans we
[1:50:26] can forgive
[1:50:28] but when the mind of Christ runs into us
[1:50:32] we no longer use our finite brains
[1:50:36] Christ comes into us
[1:50:40] now we can forgive
[1:50:43] now we've learned the process of health
[1:50:46] is
[1:50:48] that right of God she's Justified
[1:50:52] it reminds me of Rock
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:12] chops off his ears
[1:51:16] take that one
[1:51:18] Jesus said put that away
[1:51:20] put the sword away you want to use this
[1:51:23] word it's going to be used on you
[1:51:28] and justifies Peter Pedro
[1:51:32] foreign

[1:53:06] the Lord hath forsake now how many
[1:53:09] spirituals I in
[1:53:11] the Lord has forsaken me
[1:53:13] and my Lord hath forgotten me
[1:53:18] God's response
[1:53:21] and a woman forget her sucking child
[1:53:25] that she should not have compassion on
[1:53:28] the son of her womb

[1:54:04] there was a man by the name
[1:54:06] he was a rabbi named Rabbi Akiva is
[1:54:11] he lived in the First Century A.D
[1:54:15] siglo and he was tortured to death
[1:54:19] publicly by the Romans
[1:54:22] why porque because he had refused to
[1:54:26] stop preaching
[1:54:28] and studying the Scriptures
[1:54:33] it was the time
[1:54:36] of saying the morning
[1:54:42] those of you know what the Shema is
[1:54:45] that's that's the prayer they make three
[1:54:46] times a day
[1:54:50] it was the time of the morning prayer
[1:54:54] during his torture
[1:54:57] his students heard him reside in the
[1:55:00] prayers
[1:55:04] rather than crying out in pain
[1:55:08] students called out to him and said
[1:55:13] even now
[1:55:15] you're being tortured to death and even
[1:55:19] now you're praying instead of crying out
[1:55:21] and that's that's uh

[1:55:45] privilege of doing it
[1:55:47] and now the chance has come to me
[1:55:52] shall I not grasp it with joy
[1:55:56] and he repeated the first verse
