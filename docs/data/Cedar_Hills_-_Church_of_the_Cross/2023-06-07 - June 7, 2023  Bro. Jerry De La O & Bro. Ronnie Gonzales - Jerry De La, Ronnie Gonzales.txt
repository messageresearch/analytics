amen God bless us you this evening what a good song service amen we should be ready for anything now right I don't know why but I'm a little nervous today but God is good right amen all the time God is good thank the pastor for the confidence to speak to you the bride of Christ this evening amen you know we I always always want to know who's preaching but one of the last times I asked brother Caleb who is preaching I found myself up here today at the barbershop is he must have read my mind because I didn't ask him but he called me a few minutes later but no matter what right amen we should always be ready you know maybe just a small thought maybe whatever but but we should always be ready and myself I have no excuse because I haven't been up here in a while so I should be ready amen but in the end it's not me it's not my word no it's me it's God's word I could say a lot of things and they probably won't mean much but if I let God use me and let the Lord Jesus Christ speak to you tonight just so I won't have you standing too long starting with verse 11. and it reads put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil it is for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places foreign wherefore taken to you a little part of the armor of God wherefore taken to you the Armor of God they don't read I don't read that right it says word for you taken to wherefore taken to you the whole Army of God that you may be able to withstand the evil day that we stand in the evil day and having done all to stand there for having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate blessed breast plate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith where you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God may the Lord now if I put my focus I would like to focus on verse 17. and 17 instructs us to put on the whole armor of God not just a little bit you know when when you're in the military and you're getting ready for battle you know you you put on a uniform and you put on certain gears you know a lot of them we're the the bulletproof vests they have their boots that they that they put on but as they get ready to to go on to that Battlefield I guess you could say one of the last things they put on is is there is their helmet because it provides a certain protection and we and we know and you know your covers you know comes down here maybe you have a little round so you can hear it's covering your head but it's a protection but it's not protection but it also can be used to identify somebody identification well you know if you know me you know I like football of course my team ain't doing too good but that's a different story but when you're on that that football field you have that helmet on it identifies who your teammates are yeah it identifies who's for you and then it also identifies who's against you but that's the way the devil works because he's studying you right now he's studying you and I right now if you have that helmet of salvation he's going to know your son and daughter of God but what we all know Salvation is a gift right salvation is the gift of God it comes free maybe we don't have to work towards it it comes free but is it really free because it comes with a cost the salvation of God comes with a cause we have to be willing to pay a price Amigos it might cost us certain things it might even cost us our family sometimes but we got to be a separate people this evening because the Salvation is is can we lose it I don't think you can lose it but the devil can get you to doubt the devil can get you to doubt and one of those things that that is on the battlefield or one thing we can use is to renew our minds the outcome of those battles determine the course of our lives in Romans 1 and Romans 12 1 and 2 and Romanos it instructs us it tells us it tells us I beseech you therefore brethrenos Oswego that by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice the presentation purpose and sacrifices which is your reasonable service an acceptable perfect will of God perfecta and how do we renew our minds of course we we got to accept and believe God's word but God's word is going to wipe out anything contrary to God's word in our mind we can't have what's contrary to God's word it must be replaced it must replace the world's views we must allow God's truth to continually wash away the world's filth Associates and confusion from our minds and we see all this going on in the world today there is so much filth in garbage out there against the young people now but not even the young people it's targeting the children you know the the the big thing in the world right now is is the transgender and if you walk into Target the the big backlash now is that they're targeting clothes for for that type of personas but they even have them for the young children so there's this world is nothing but fields and we cannot let that set in our minds because Jesus died on the cross he died for our sins he gave us our salvation and we must keep it in our minds we must battle every day we must the devil's going to come and try to get you to doubt God's word but I can tell you now by his stripes today by his stripes we are already healed it it didn't it didn't happen I didn't get healed today yeah was healed two thousand years ago I didn't give my salvation today I was like my salvation was 2 000 years ago we didn't just get saved today but today we accepted it so the day you accepted your salvation that's when it came into you being upstairs but it happened on the cross Jesus died for our sins Jesus if if right now I shouldn't be here because we must reject doubts that arise from circumstances God rewards our faith with the helmet of salvation firmly and peace in place and we can choose to believe what appears impossible impossible I thought it was impossible that God thought of me I thought it impossible that God could save a man like me I didn't know God's word I didn't know the message I didn't go to church I thought it was impossible that he could save me but it's not impossible when God knows from the foundation of the world knew you were going to be here this day he knew and I you and I were gonna be here and that's what the devil don't like yes he's gonna try and plant that seed of doubt in you and I mean he's gonna battle you for your salvation daily I can't battle you for different things daily maybe to a fault I love sports and I always want to know what's going on but but when I get up at 5 30 in the morning because I get up in the shower and I'll go and I'll make me a cup of coffee and my first thing is to pray but as soon as I sit down to pray there comes a thought turn on Sports Center because he doesn't want you to start out your day thinking of God he doesn't want you to start out the day with the blessings of God he wants to try and stop you every single day that's why we got to get God's we can read God's word we can read the messages we can read the Bible but if we're just reading it because normally if you get you got to protect your heart from the things of this world and you're gonna have things come around you and sometimes things are going to fall apart things are going to fall apart but remember the victory is already won LA Victorious the Battle Is Over Victory is already won there's victory in the camp I have Victorian campamento because he died on the cross but not did he just died he resurrected and if I believe in him and I believe on his word and I have resurrected with him and I can do anything in Christ Jesus we can do anything in Christ we can defeat any Devils you can defeat anything that comes our way we can defeat doubt we can defeat satanas but remember it's going to come with a cause are we willing to pay the cost this evening we gotta find put all our hope in him and as I finish can can we can you pull up Psalm 73 25. all our hope is in Christ Jesus this evening who might have whom have I in heaven and there is none upon Earth that I desire desire besides whom I have in heaven who do we have in heaven but the Lord that's all we need is we know and rely on him this evening the devil's going to come and he's going to try and knock us down he's going to try and stop us to to to realize who we are young people he's going to battle you every single day he's going to try and stop you because he knows when you realize you're a child of God then he really can't stop you and this is going to keep our mind filled with the word of God you gotta keep our hearts filled with the word of God because he wants to destroy you this evening he doesn't want you to seek God's word he doesn't want you to seek God's salvation because he thinks he can get you but there's Victory this evening there's victory in the Lord Jesus Christ and anything is possible as long as you believe on him [Applause] and God bless you let's play like a fifth time that's happened to me so I woke up to the front my jacket pocket gets caught on that maybe I should start walking a little further away from that right amen God bless you good to see each and every one of you if you would all stand to your feet as we read the words let's turn to uh John chapter 14. in Verse 18 and it says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you know a little while and the world seeth me no more but yes you see me because I live you live also because verse 20. at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I and you know Padres amen well I had no idea what brother Jerry was going to preach on Mr Jerry well we're in the same spirit and I believe today because seen hearing what he had said I believe that godska has great things in store for us this evening if we're willing to accept that what he has for us you know brother Jerry we're going to talk a little bit about sports today too I'm not as big of a fan sports fan as Jerry but um you want to talk a little bit about it and you know for about a year now I've been watching baseball and uh I never liked baseball never even gave it a chance I thought it was the most boring sport that there was you know so one day we're uh was working with brother Jerry brothers and the Dodgers were going to play those Dodgers and I was like you know what I'm gonna check to see what this is all about he went away I saw a few uh pictures and I'm like Ah that's boring did you see the picture here he's just rubbing the ball I'm like oh yeah last time I just throw that balls you know so I gave it a chance that I I liked it and I actually I like it even more now because they just they made some real changes one of the changes was that now there's a a pitcher Squad and this picture at this clock it's it's one 15 seconds I believe it is so the game's a lot faster now it's a lot more exciting now yes and a lot shorter amen so so now the the picture just can't be there rubbing the ball and doing whatever he's doing frustrating the batter is I think that's what it was I think I think uh brother Jerry can correct me if I'm wrong I think there was this one picture I think he's like 45 seconds he would just sit there just rubbing the ball wait you know before he even pitched the first one you know so again frustrating the batter but yeah you know uh you know and uh and uh somebody was knocking in the back door again um so so the baseball field for those that don't know it's called a diamond is you know so we have your home plate the memos and I think I'm you know pretty much everybody knows this right but for just in case there's somebody that might not know it see there's a there's a first base second base third base and then back home you know so so you know as as we heard from our founding Pastor how he preached the message brother Branham says now you can even get to first base unless you believe the word so you're at home you don't believe the word of God you're struck out before you even get the chance to bet yeah so the first thing we got to do as Believers we have to believe that this is this is the word of God and it's nothing but the truth is no matter what anybody says about it this is the truth this is God in print form and it's the truth yes so now so now everybody believe that that this is the this is the word of God if you believe that okay now you're ready to bet now you're able to listen to get on to first base now now as brother Jerry was saying this is Jerry there was there's uh this so this ball game here is it's the Saints Los Santos versus the devil Diablo and the devil has his team also you know so so before before let's say uh brother brother Isaac gets up to bed well their sane has one of his little minions right that he goes and he hangs around us that's why the angel of the Lord Camp about those that fear you because we have an opposition daily daily at the audio daily each and every one of us there's no escaping that at the area so so there he is he's kind of scoping you out brother Paul and monopol he struggles with this a little bit brother Isaac call you in school I see you struggle just a little bit with this oh the devil sees us and she struggles with that just just a little bit so the minion goes to the pitcher which is another devil and he gives us all the weaknesses he's got a list of all the saints with all your weaknesses everything that you struggle with Okay so so uh snap again away from the public behind us so before he's gonna pitch brother Angelo's gonna brother Angela's up to bat Manu Angelo is okay so what does the devil do inside his hat the picture he has he has a piece of paper here okay so so last time in school he struggled with this so before he pitches takes off his hat and this is Angela struggles with a with a fastball Angelo he struggles with the changeup sister Ruthie you struggle with the changeup struggle with the slider for those that don't know those are different those are different types of pitches there's a bunch of different ones these are just a few that I know so so the the pitcher knows all your weaknesses were not your weekend says our weaknesses where we struggle with that Joe you struggle with the Sinker so he's gonna throw a sinker at you so so now so that that's just at home plate this is before we even swing yes so so but but then but then the good thing is that there's a coach and and there's a what's called a batters coach also so he teaches the the batter don't swing at just any pitches okay so so this picture he likes to throw this and he knows your weakness don't swing at that so we hit it boom it's a grounder so now we can go to first base because first of all we believe the word of God now we now we can run to first base which is recognizing the Lord Jesus Christ Brothers recognizing that we're in dire need of Salvation there is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ we got to recognize that he paid the price for me for you and for all of us he paid the price to redeem us to take us out of the pawn shop and so that we can get to second base so now so now so now the only way that that brother Angelo can make it to second base now he's depending on brother Noah depended oh but but the pitcher knows he struggles with the force him he also struggles with the change but don't worry because we got a coach amen so so so so so so so Angelo needs to get to second base and it's dependent on brother Noah now now now now we know we know this that that our our leader determines our Eternal destination right destination right so but are also are also our attitude towards our brother also determines our his destination and the message the Great Commission and what about a brother that's made a mistake oh I see he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong well if we take him to the throne of God your shoulder to shoulder with him knowing that he's Immortal and maybe his destination rest is Upon Our attitude towards him when we come back from the Throne of God we'll realize that everyone guilty and we all need help from one another way to do it is so now brother Angelo's destination is resting on brother Noah what he's going to hit that that's that's if he's not if if they don't get him out yes and second base is recognizing who the prophet is we recognize that Jesus Paid the price for us Jesus with a message of restoration and he begins to I I this is one of my favorite quotes right here and blasphemous names brother Branham says he's repeating the the dream of sister Shepard is so brother Branham is in work overalls in so he's got a bucket of most Crystal Clear pure water so he begins to pour into this rock box right so he's beginning to pour out the message everything that's in that rock Box all the trash begins to boil out and and that's that's what happens to us right when the message comes forth it begins to take out all our garbage everything that we're out of a leperous hand that was we heard on Sunday right he begins to Output right what was poured into him he's a dispenser right [Music] we can recognize all what God God sent us a mighty message of restoration now now now brother Ethan he's up to bat yeah now Angelo's destination and brother and brother Noah's is also depending on what Ethan's gonna back where so the goal is home right that's our goal is as a as a group of ministers as a body of ministers that's our goal is our goal is to be able to live the faith of the people amen that's the goal of the faithful ministry right it is man but there's a danger now there's a short stop right now now the shortstop is probably responsible for the most double plays there is because most right most batters are right-handed they throw the ball that way so that that's the place where where they're gonna strike you out the fastest or to get you out the fastest second and third man man so brother so brother Ethan hits it boom it's a it's a pop life Angelo's running to third one no one's running to seconds running the first and they're all safe now what happens in third base he says I will send you another comforter right because and from there and from Sister Shepherd's dream is Shepherd from The Prophet Del profeta dumps out the rock the water into the Rock Box all the trash comes out now now from that rock box comes five streams of the most Crystal Clear pure water but where's this going to it's on top of the mountains he's dumping the water from the top it's five streams all the way down who's the beneficiary for what for the for your Perfection for my perfection again for the unity of the Body for the edification do we come to the unity of the faith again from Faith to Faith as I said our goal as a Ministry is to lift up again another one of my favorite quotes because what's what's the purpose here the purpose is to get Angelo home that's the purpose that's our purpose as a Ministry to get everyone home we want to get Angelo home we want to get Ruthie home you want to get Ethan home we want to get you home that's our no if I can just sacrifice just to you him who is in scoring position just sacrifice just a little bit so he can run home because the team with the most points wins is that the goal to come home why what happens at home yeah now Angela can recognize who he is he's seen Jesus Christ you recognize the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made he's accepted a prophet acceptable prophet he is a center of faithful Ministry that faithful Ministry is pointing them to me to who he is the goal to reach that to get for him to reach to recognize who he is that's the goal to get him home but he must recognize who he is brother Branham says we're not building an organization and I'm going to say tell you Church building an organization organization he says I'm not here but I'm going to say we're not here to build an organization to build an organization Christ sent us huh to build individuals not not not not just just the boys or the or the menones to build individuals Hermanas to build to build individuals for my individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ it might be the powerhouse oh I feel it now and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word build up the individuals not build an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to a son and a daughter sorry that's the goal that's our goal as a Ministry is Sons and Daughters what West what our goal should be to build up individuals to recognize who we are God put his power his power in his church yes Christ poured himself into the church that's why he says I'm not looking at a fat day no more bro Tommy would always say about about his father yeah oh it says all at that day what day is that he says I recognize that that day is that day is this day for it's the whole planet that's the whole thing is one plan of redention coming down coming back to living coming back to living and dwell with immoral and commune as he did at the beginning so what's the deal to come back home the restoration of Eden the restoration we were with him and we can only do it when we recognize who we are it's great to recognize the sacrifice that he did it is prayed to recognize our prophets it's great you recognize the ministry we must know who we are going nowhere I have no idea how long they've been going for it tomorrow sometimes we feel like cowards right this is because maybe some maybe one time we you struck us out but if he struck you out don't worry it's okay you're gonna be up too bad again don't don't get stuck don't get stuck that he struck you out you struggled with something and it's okay we all struggle with a certain thing but we have coaches we have a coach there's a coach at first base also don't worry don't worry you struck out it's okay with our help we don't make it home that's that's our goal that's our purposes so that you can make it home who's the most famous baseball player ever again all this even the sisters Babe Ruth right Babe Ruth he's got a he's by part of probably the by far the most famous uh baseball player there is brother Jerry what's he famous for he's the Home Run King right and Ray de los home runs the Colossus of clouds the Great Bambino El Gran Bambino Terror what was he what was he known for for his home runs right home runs but did you know Babe Ruth struck out 1 000 pero Babe Ruth 1330 times can you believe that he struck out 1 330 times he's not known for his strikeouts almost double the amount of home runs that he had and it's all right you strike out once you strike out twice it's all right he's not known for his foreign this evening if you struck out you know but this is this is the one of the things that I like about Babe Ruth's stats the 714 home runs that's awesome but did you know that he had twice as many RBIs breakoutsadas was an RBI so Church Iglesia if you play something soft brother will go now that was the Holy Spirit I had no idea what brother Jerry was going to preacheri the unity of the spirit of what we're talking about you just got told this morning that he was going to preacher it's the same spiritu and that spirit is here this evening you struck out we got lots of coaches here we have a lot of brothers that can help you that can instruct you then if you feel in your heart and you want to come up to the front where the ministers can pray for you that's fine if you fill in your heart if you can believe the vessel he is here tonight you might say brother Ronnie he says I have Jesus in my heart thank God Jesus he's there brother he was also on the ship with the disciples while the storm was raging Jesus on the boat didn't change the storm Jesus and maybe this evening maybe you're in a storm maybe the devil keeps on striking you out he says maybe he's throwing things your way maybe your ship is rocking back and forth you're struggling maybe you're lonely fastball that he throws you yes maybe you're anxious you're alone solo and the devil keeps on throwing that ball at you and you're throwing the Sinker at you and maybe we've sunk down so much that we don't think that there's hope for us but as long as there's a man of God which there is we will go down in the mud and take you out Jesus on the ship didn't change the outcome of it Jesus it's not until Jesus speaks when you have when you make it home you recognize who you are you recognize that you also have the power of the spoken word all you need to do is Wake Jesus up Jesus and speak the word yeah that's what changed the outcome of the storm is not Jesus being on the ship but him speaking the word peace be still pass nature knew its maker la natural is there somebody here that would help me with brother my brother here mano [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]
