[24:19] amen
[24:22] who was
[24:23] this elijah
[24:26] we have heard many messages many many
[24:28] messages on elijah is that right
[24:32] you got your notebooks ready you make
[24:34] sure that you write these things down
[24:38] where was he born and donde nacional
[24:43] where did he come from
[24:46] what are his characteristics
[24:50] let's find out real quick in first kings
[24:53] 17 and verse one
[24:57] how many know that there's not a whole
[24:59] lot
[25:00] about elijah where he came from
[25:05] but we know right away in verse one it
[25:07] says and elijah
[25:09] the tishbite
[25:12] who was of the inhabitants of gilead
[25:16] and that's all we know about it
[25:18] we find out he comes right into the
[25:21] palace
[25:23] and he tells ahab
[25:25] okay
[25:26] it's
[25:45] but other than that there's no record of
[25:47] his genealogy
[25:50] and there's a reason for that is that
[25:52] right
[25:54] no record of who his father was
[25:57] uh
[25:58] she was a candidate no record of who his
[26:01] mother was
[26:03] he was a prophet
[26:05] a miracle worker
[26:07] he lived in the northern
[26:09] part or the northern kingdom of israel
[26:14] during the reign of king ahab and
[26:17] his queen jezebel
[26:22] now elijah in the greek can someone tell
[26:24] me what elijah and the greek is
[26:28] can you help me out here
[26:30] elijah and the greek what what would it
[26:32] be
[26:33] in griego
[26:39] maybe you had a worse week than i did he
[26:41] says
[26:43] not that mine was bad
[26:45] maybe you had a rough week
[26:48] okay somebody i i somebody got to answer
[26:49] me this morning
[26:52] elijah and the greek is what elias
[27:00] you better phone a friend or some
[27:02] something this morning
[27:16] thanks guys appreciate that
[27:20] and the greek is elias well somebody
[27:22] could have read it at least
[27:26] elijah once again in the greek is elias
[27:28] elias and elijah means and this is so
[27:31] important to the message
[27:34] yahweh is my god
[27:39] or
[27:40] yahweh
[27:41] yeah or my god is jehovah
[27:44] says
[27:45] this is very important to understand the
[27:47] message here in a little bit
[27:51] i want you to tell your neighbor
[27:52] neighbor
[27:54] elijah means
[27:56] my god is jehovah
[28:00] okay this is this is so important for
[28:02] the message now
[28:05] this man's characteristics were so
[28:08] amazing
[28:11] that even jesus was thought of as
[28:13] possibly being elijah reincarnated
[28:20] i mean stop for a moment
[28:23] that's the messiah
[28:24] the christ
[28:27] many thought that he maybe could be
[28:29] elias come back again
[28:33] when jesus asked his disciples who do
[28:35] men say that i the son of man
[28:41] that was their answer right
[28:44] say that you're john the baptist
[28:47] some say that you are elias
[28:51] jeremias or one of the prophets
[28:54] and this spirit of
[28:56] elijah speed today there has to be souls
[29:00] associated
[29:03] or so bound to christ
[29:07] that you you can't even tell the
[29:08] difference
[29:11] i don't know about you but i want my
[29:13] spirit so close to christ
[29:17] they can't tell the difference between
[29:19] us and christ
[29:22] and god loved the spirit of elijah so
[29:25] much
[29:28] that he used it five times
[29:31] now i won't ask you that because the
[29:33] guys already put it up
[29:38] but let's go over them just real quick
[29:40] we we know them by by heart already but
[29:43] number one elijah the tishbite
[29:47] can you can you say it with me elijah
[29:49] the tishbite
[29:51] number two
[29:53] elisha
[29:56] number three
[29:58] john the baptist
[30:00] number four
[30:02] elijah to the gentiles
[30:05] and number five
[30:08] elijah to the jews again
[30:12] for a moment we're gonna we're gonna
[30:14] focus on the third coming of the spirit
[30:16] of elijah and that is in john the
[30:18] baptist
[30:21] how many know that he was the first the
[30:23] forerunner of the first coming of the
[30:25] lord amen
[30:27] those are
[30:29] kindergarten questions
[30:32] we'll get to the primary ones a little
[30:35] john the baptist forerunned the first
[30:37] coming of the lord
[30:40] but he couldn't do the job of forerunner
[30:44] by himself
[30:48] i mean think about that for a moment
[30:50] here comes a man on the scene john the
[30:52] baptist
[30:55] but there was certain characteristics or
[30:57] qualities that he needed that he didn't
[31:00] have
[31:15] and so therefore anton says we see the
[31:19] spirit of elijah coming upon john
[31:24] juan once again the spirit of elijah is
[31:27] coming upon john ellis
[31:30] to help him forerun the first coming of
[31:32] the lord
[31:35] he needed the spirit of elijah on him
[31:40] watch this now matthew eleventh chapter
[31:43] and verse seven
[31:44] mateo
[31:49] when you have it you can say man
[31:54] you need to stretch a little bit
[31:56] i think you need to wake up a little bit
[31:58] more
[32:02] and as they departed this is verse seven
[32:04] per society jesus began to tell
[32:08] to say unto the multitudes concerning
[32:10] john
[32:19] i think he's asking the same questions
[32:21] today
[32:24] what do you go what do you go to church
[32:25] looking for a queue
[32:46] and more
[32:48] than a prophet
[32:50] for this is he
[32:53] of whom it is written and this
[33:09] so the first thing jesus does
[33:11] jesus he places john the baptist in the
[33:14] scriptures
[33:17] amen or amen amen once again the first
[33:19] thing he does he places him in the
[33:21] scripture
[33:36] but they cannot place john the baptist
[33:39] in those scriptures
[33:43] so the word which is jesus
[33:46] christ
[33:47] to place him in the scriptures
[33:58] whoa
[33:59] and they're like whoa it isn't wow we
[34:01] didn't catch that when we read malachi
[34:03] 3. no captain
[34:10] he said he is the one that would come
[34:13] to make the path straight
[34:16] to prepare the way before me
[34:19] i'm just i'm just
[34:21] voting
[34:22] he's the one that would prepare the way
[34:24] hey
[34:25] el camino he is my forerunner el esme
[34:27] precusor now now this is important
[34:31] because after john had identified jesus
[34:36] jesus
[34:37] the lamb of god
[34:39] takes away the sins of the world
[34:43] brother branham says his eagle i had
[34:45] filmed over a bit
[35:04] he begins to imprison he he calls his
[35:06] disciples that are visiting him
[35:10] and he says go and ask
[35:13] the christians
[35:23] [Music]
[35:42] he's thinking about the prophet malachi
[35:45] and what he prophesied
[35:50] because john the baptist knew what
[35:51] malachi had prophesied
[35:55] and him knowing that he is
[36:10] another oh esperamo
[36:13] now jesus never told them to tell john
[36:15] that he was the one jesus
[36:19] that's unlike most people today huh
[36:20] escomo
[36:22] i'm the one
[36:24] i'm the one you're looking for yeah
[36:26] that's me
[36:27] not jesus
[36:29] no jesus he begins to tell them
[36:32] he answered them and said unto them they
[36:34] answered and said unto them
[36:51] watch how he's approaching john now this
[36:53] is important
[36:56] he's approaching john
[36:58] knowing that elijah
[37:01] was a miracle worker
[37:04] so that's how he's approaching him
[37:06] the blind received their sight
[37:10] and the lame walk
[37:12] the lepers are cleansed
[37:16] and the death here
[37:18] the dead are raised up
[37:21] and the poor have the gospel preached
[37:23] today
[37:25] why did jesus tell him that
[37:29] because elijah did miracles
[37:32] and in john's heart
[37:53] ah this is this is good stuff now watch
[37:55] this now es esta bueno
[37:59] matthew 11 verse 11.
[38:02] verso jesus continues and says verily i
[38:05] say unto you
[38:07] among them that
[38:09] are born of women
[38:11] there hath not risen a greater than john
[38:13] the baptist
[38:31] wouldn't that include elijah no
[38:32] including
[38:34] us
[38:37] would it
[38:38] well we don't know who his mama was but
[38:42] we don't know who his papa was
[38:57] which was for to come
[39:00] in other words jesus just made a
[39:02] declaration jesus
[39:05] not about himself
[39:07] what about this man john
[39:10] jesus said he is
[39:16] this kind of gets a little bit um
[39:19] makes you scratch your head a little bit
[39:23] but jesus was not telling them that john
[39:25] was
[39:26] elijah the tishbite jesus
[39:30] but what he's saying is that the spirit
[39:32] that was in john
[39:36] juan but that that spirit is espiritu on
[39:40] john
[39:41] juan was forerunning the coming word or
[39:44] the messiah
[39:47] and jesus is pointing to the forerunner
[39:51] [Music]
[39:57] he was pointing to the forerunner that
[39:59] was prophesied to come
[40:03] so it almost looks like john and jesus
[40:07] jesus the forerunner and the christ
[40:11] christo are not on the same page
[40:16] that's hard to to think about that
[40:20] here's christ
[40:22] jesus
[40:38] you see the religious people of that day
[40:41] knew the scriptures
[40:45] because they couldn't place him in the
[40:46] scriptures
[40:49] they got
[40:50] confused john chapter 1 verse 19. juan
[40:54] capitulo
[40:56] and this is the record of john
[41:00] how many of you have a record
[41:03] you know you can have a good record too
[41:04] not just a bad record
[41:07] this is the record of john when the jews
[41:09] sent priests and levites
[41:15] from jerusalem to ask him
[41:18] who
[41:32] i'm not the messiah
[41:45] but now they're asking john
[41:56] jesus said he was elias the elias that
[41:58] was to come
[42:00] and john said i am not juan dijon
[42:03] arthou that prophet
[42:07] nope no watch jesus said that
[42:10] said he was he said
[42:12] john said he's not
[42:15] but notice the way that jesus said it
[42:18] and i'm going to go back to verse 14.
[42:22] he's talking about john avlando juan but
[42:24] then he says if ye will receive
[42:28] it
[42:30] it never says if you will receive him no
[42:34] iel
[42:36] this is this is good watch this now
[42:38] if ye will receive it
[42:41] what is it
[42:42] the
[43:07] no no you're making me an antichrist
[43:09] because
[43:24] what he's
[43:36] and what john was saying
[43:38] elias
[43:52] rather than the spirit that was
[43:54] anointing the man
[43:57] and that's why so many people even today
[44:01] they say you people think that brother
[44:03] branham is elijah
[44:06] no no he was not the tishbite
[44:10] but if you can receive it
[44:15] amen come on but if you can't receive it
[44:20] this is the elias
[44:34] behold i send you
[44:38] elijah the prophet
[44:40] before the coming of the great and
[44:41] dreadful day of the lord
[44:44] let's put it like this
[44:46] if i wanted to write music
[44:49] i would want the spirit of beethoven on
[44:51] me right
[44:54] yes see
[44:56] or some other artist that you like
[45:00] if i had the spirit of dillinger brother
[45:02] branham says
[45:04] i would be a thief and a killer
[45:06] yesterday
[45:12] the question is being asked to you know
[45:31] are you me and it's too
[45:33] yo
[45:34] i said yo oh you're good
[45:36] okay you are you and i am me yeah
[45:39] all right who are you
[45:42] why do we act like everybody else
[45:46] [Music]
[45:47] we act like the world we dress like the
[45:49] world we live like the world who are
[45:51] almost
[45:53] yeah it's like the people in church and
[45:55] i live like the people
[45:56] actually
[46:00] sometimes we get the spirit of the
[46:02] pastor rather than the holy spirit
[46:07] then the spirit that john the baptist
[46:10] had
[46:12] and that william
[46:21] and that's why that spirit will always
[46:23] stand up and bring corrections
[46:53] he turned and says it's not lawful for
[46:55] you to have your brother's wife
[46:59] corrects the error
[47:03] but nowadays you don't find it
[47:05] they are no longer the homes
[47:08] not in the churches
[47:16] nowadays you can't tell people
[47:21] they'll fly off the handle just like
[47:22] that
[47:24] i'm not going to church
[47:26] why you didn't like the spirit of elijah
[47:28] no
[47:29] elias
[47:32] come on
[47:35] did it go against your thinking
[47:44] let me ask you a question
[47:47] why did eli the high priest why did his
[47:49] sons get in trouble
[47:53] and leo they were doing all kinds of
[47:54] stuff in the temple that they shouldn't
[47:56] be doing
[47:59] you know why they did that
[48:01] because eli babied them too much
[48:18] oh
[48:33] you all were part of that we'll go here
[48:35] and there and everybody was excited
[48:42] i'm so tired of services
[48:45] maybe you should go and make it not a
[48:46] service he says
[48:49] maybe you should make it a relationship
[48:52] because when it's a relationship
[48:54] you know no matter what you got to go
[48:56] important
[48:57] there with him
[48:59] i want to be there with the body
[49:11] and sometimes the sister said well
[49:12] brother why can't you just get up there
[49:14] and say we
[49:42] a sister in your church older sister in
[49:44] my church
[49:46] a certain family in your church
[49:50] that is sickening to my stomach
[49:55] and i say where's the correction for
[49:57] that you understand
[50:01] now elijah elias just call it out
[50:06] he said you're the one that did that
[50:08] look i know who you are
[50:10] but yet giving a little grace you say go
[50:12] correct that sister
[50:15] you know what you're talking about
[50:18] go and correct that
[50:23] it's a sister from fort collins that was
[50:24] told that so just so that you know who
[50:26] you are
[50:29] wow
[50:30] wow would trash another family in their
[50:32] own church
[50:35] let themselves look good
[50:38] oh come on where's the spirit of elias
[50:42] we gotta get it right church
[50:45] we stand here sometimes
[50:48] you wanna preach nice messages
[50:50] nobody wants the corrections
[51:23] [Music]
[51:31] it was to the bobbed hair women the
[51:33] denominations
[52:17] god loved
[52:19] because love is correct
[52:23] but we don't want to be corrected well
[52:25] let's start being correct
[52:30] i deal
[52:46] really
[52:47] the other person did the same thing
[52:51] talking to each other
[52:53] let me get off that because
[52:55] then i will get into the rest of my
[52:56] message
[53:07] said he said i am the voice of one
[53:10] crying in the wilderness
[53:27] and now the scribes had read this
[53:29] portion of scripture before
[53:32] identification
[53:34] read the part of elijah
[53:37] but they had never seen the name
[53:40] it's the same as when the seals were
[53:42] opened
[53:44] it didn't declare the name
[53:47] only the position of the body of christ
[53:52] feel those things that the seven
[53:54] thunders uttered and write them not say
[53:56] yes
[53:58] i will reveal them in my time
[54:03] watch the spirit of elijah in action
[54:07] there will be no rain until i call for
[54:09] you
[54:11] in other words there will be no thunder
[54:13] either no
[54:14] until i call for it
[54:16] there will be no do until i call foreign
[54:36] so he must have been the father of the
[54:38] reign
[54:41] hath the reign of father
[54:43] or who have begotten the dru the drops
[54:45] of dew
[54:47] tine
[54:56] this is first kings chapter 18 verse 43
[55:00] and he said to his servant
[55:03] go up now look toward the sea and he
[55:06] went up and looked and said
[55:07] there's nothing
[55:09] and he said
[55:10] go again
[55:12] seven times
[55:23] and on the seventh time
[55:26] he knew
[55:27] where he had to go
[55:30] think about this is all pipes and
[55:31] shadows now
[55:33] on the seventh time or the seventh angel
[55:35] messenger
[55:38] it came to pass at the seventh time
[55:42] that's when he saw behold i see there
[55:45] arises a little cloud out of the sea or
[55:48] the people
[55:51] it's like a man's hand
[55:54] and he said go up this is the super and
[55:56] say unto ahab
[55:58] prepare thy chariot preparation
[56:27] and the hand of the lord was on elijah
[56:32] and he girded up his loins
[56:35] and ran before ahab to the entrance
[56:39] of jezreel
[56:56] so
[57:08] or how many of you can say the message
[57:10] got to me
[57:13] the sowing got to me
[57:17] before ahab got there
[57:20] before jezebel got there
[57:22] the message got to me
[57:49] are you sure it got to you
[57:52] because if not
[58:09] why then do the scribes say then that
[58:11] elias must first come antos
[58:15] truly elijah shall first come and
[58:17] restore all things
[58:49] was to turn the hearts of the fathers to
[58:51] the children
[58:54] and the hearts of the children back to
[58:55] the father
[58:59] but it could not be done without the
[59:01] spirit of elijah
[59:24] are you are you hearing me
[59:26] without that spirit of elijah
[59:30] we never would have received the message
[59:33] we never would have received the word
[59:37] that's what the spirit of elijah did
[59:40] notice this now
[59:42] the old orthodox order is what what was
[59:45] here
[59:47] but when christ came here
[59:50] he never broke the law
[59:52] he only fulfilled the law
[59:55] and he brought forth a new covenant
[59:58] that the same spirit of elijah
[1:00:02] that it took to turn the hearts of the
[1:00:04] fathers to the children
[1:00:08] is the same spirit of elijah
[1:00:11] spirit that it takes to turn the hearts
[1:00:13] of the children back to their father
[1:00:17] jews can receive the same message
[1:00:24] the bible doesn't say that elijah saw
[1:00:26] the seventh angel
[1:00:29] it says that he saw the cloud
[1:00:33] where someone was coming
[1:00:39] he knew that he had to
[1:00:41] accompany
[1:00:42] the seven things
[1:00:47] this is just stop for a moment here
[1:00:49] because i wanted to get this
[1:00:51] he knew that he had to accompany
[1:01:07] yes they do see
[1:01:09] imagine
[1:01:10] moses and elijah imagine
[1:01:12] having a conference
[1:01:15] in the conference conference yes what
[1:01:17] about you moses
[1:01:19] oh moses says
[1:01:21] i'm a lawgiver
[1:01:37] that's the spirit of elijah he was a
[1:01:39] prophet to all nations
[1:01:44] but he was a prophet to all the gentiles
[1:01:48] the message has gone forth around the
[1:01:50] world
[1:02:06] watch this now pikacy you say well elias
[1:02:08] or elijah was just a man
[1:02:11] yes he was cecilia james 517 tells us
[1:02:15] santiago cinco de si
[1:02:16] elias was a man subject to like passion
[1:02:26] and we're taught in the scriptures
[1:02:30] that elijah was not an immortal being
[1:02:36] did you get that lo
[1:02:38] elijah was not an immortal being
[1:02:42] he was a man subject to like passion
[1:02:46] has
[1:02:51] oh i think we need a lot of help in the
[1:02:52] praying earnestly
[1:02:56] god help us to pray earnestly
[1:02:59] but elijah never died
[1:03:02] because before he he would die
[1:03:06] he was taken in a chariot by a whirlwind
[1:03:10] for the spirit that was of elijah
[1:03:14] is
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:33] notice this now he could say
[1:03:38] we this is in the message spiritual foot
[1:03:40] in due season
[1:04:11] is the same porquez
[1:04:13] el mismo
[1:04:14] i'm going to believe the message that
[1:04:15] brother branham brought him
[1:04:18] up
[1:04:19] then are you one and the same with it
[1:04:23] do you love the spirit of elijah
[1:04:40] a denominational man under
[1:04:42] denominational auspices
[1:04:49] a theologian under theology
[1:05:06] they're all one with their messages
[1:05:09] but then when a man comes with thus
[1:05:12] saith the lord
[1:05:15] he and the message
[1:05:16] is one eliot
[1:05:19] and when elijah come with thus saith the
[1:05:21] lord
[1:05:24] he and his message
[1:05:26] became one
[1:05:28] just as jesus
[1:05:30] jesus when he comes
[1:05:32] he was the word
[1:05:34] the word
[1:06:12] we have come in the spirit of elijah
[1:06:15] el espirito delias
[1:06:18] now a lot of people won't take that in
[1:06:19] the message
[1:06:21] i don't come every sunday
[1:06:24] domingo
[1:06:26] perez como caleb perez if i did lucia i
[1:06:30] come wrong
[1:06:32] i don't go to the places the lord sends
[1:06:34] us
[1:06:40] the men don't go as their names and who
[1:06:42] they are
[1:06:48] i am not a separate entity from the
[1:06:51] message
[1:06:53] and that spirit or anointing of elijah
[1:06:56] speak to him i'm going to tell you has
[1:06:58] not left us
[1:07:02] because the message and the messenger
[1:07:03] are one in the senate
[1:07:06] and god takes the man
[1:07:08] but never his spirit
[1:07:12] oh
[1:07:23] but yet he was not just the man
[1:07:26] on hombre
[1:07:28] i see these things and i say wow
[1:07:31] lord help us help me to understand these
[1:07:33] things better
[1:07:36] we're coming around the corner
[1:07:38] matthew 27.

[1:07:52] grace always says dad you didn't say it
[1:07:53] right
[1:07:54] grace
[1:08:36] my god my god why has thou forsaken me
[1:08:41] and some of them that stood there
[1:08:42] when they heard that they said
[1:08:45] this man calls for elias
[1:08:50] why would jesus the word
[1:08:54] be calling for a mortal man yesterday
[1:09:00] don't make sense to me
[1:09:08] my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
[1:09:13] oh what she said the wrestler they say
[1:09:15] let be
[1:09:17] let's see whether elias will come to
[1:09:20] save him
[1:09:23] mark 15 tells us marco the same story
[1:09:27] let us see whether elias will come to
[1:09:29] take him down
[1:09:32] jesus did not die as god jesus
[1:09:36] he died as a man
[1:09:39] spirit went back to the father
[1:09:42] paul went to preach in the in the
[1:09:44] prisons of hell
[1:09:57] oh i want to know that this morning
[1:10:00] this is where the message comes together
[1:10:01] nowadays follow me
[1:10:04] once again elijah elias means my god is
[1:10:08] jehovah
[1:10:10] says
[1:10:10] watch why it had to be elijah
[1:10:54] my god is one with his family
[1:11:52] i am the
[1:12:18] and then he says jehovah means
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:29] and he made man an amateur guy
[1:12:32] so he isn't self-existent
[1:13:38] do you think he wanted elijah to come
[1:13:40] take him off the cross
[1:13:44] it was his
[1:14:12] thou forsaken
[1:14:23] there was a separation from the son and
[1:14:25] the father
[1:15:08] but only because through that sacrifice
[1:15:10] could the family of god be restored
[1:15:16] to the rightful place
[1:15:18] where was the family of jehovah
[1:15:22] we were in
[1:15:29] we were in jeopardy of losing the whole
[1:15:31] world
[1:15:34] was given to his children
[1:15:36] as
[1:15:47] or if the lamb would not come forth
[1:16:08] notice this now can i have just a few
[1:16:10] more minutes i don't even know when i
[1:16:11] started
[1:16:12] just a few more minutes
[1:16:13] let me just finish this
[1:16:18] my god is jehovah media
[1:16:24] and jehovah of the old
[1:16:27] testamento
[1:16:29] is jesus of the new yes jesus
[1:16:32] oh my my mind oh there's meal and i can
[1:16:34] hear him once again crying why is that
[1:16:36] not forsaking me
[1:16:39] not to save him as we think
[1:16:43] but save him from being alone again
[1:17:00] restoration
[1:17:03] or only through the spirit of elijah
[1:17:05] could a prophet come
[1:17:09] through the ministry of the son of man
[1:17:13] it would be manifested again
[1:17:17] that wasn't elijah yes
[1:17:19] watch what he's saying now he's talking
[1:17:21] about elijah doing the miracles and all
[1:17:22] that he did in his life
[1:17:26] that wasn't elijah
[1:17:28] that was the spirit of god on elijah yes
[1:17:31] elijah was just a man
[1:17:34] now we've had elijah's coats
[1:17:40] everything
[1:17:42] elijah
[1:17:57] according to matthews or luke 17 30.
[1:18:01] man is to be revealed again
[1:18:06] not a man
[1:18:10] it'll come through a prophet

[1:18:55] but before he went he said i pray for
[1:18:57] them
[1:18:59] i pray not for the world
[1:19:02] but for them which thou has given me
[1:19:05] they are mine
[1:19:24] through thine own name
[1:19:26] those whom thou has given
[1:19:28] that they may be one as we are one
[1:19:33] while i was with him in the world i kept
[1:19:35] them in thy name
[1:19:42] and none of them is lost
[1:19:45] but the son of perdition
[1:19:48] might be fulfilled
[1:19:50] verse 21 that they all may be one person
[1:19:57] that they also may be one in us
[1:20:01] the world may believe that thou has sent
