thinks this is [Music] is [Music] but in the days of the voice of the seventh danger my knees shall begin to sound the mystery of god probably finished says he'd have to create to receive the prophets 7 rooted up and built in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding then and abounding therein with thanksgiving [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for me [Music] i stood on the bank of a wide ranging river trusting that i'd get across and i paid my way [Music] through every trial each test and temptation one thing for sure every time [Music] over and over again and again through it [Music] couldn't win but jesus isn't with me so i'll take the victory [Music] you ask me why i have no hesitation god does what he said he will do [Music] why should i dwell on the hardships and struggles just beyond them i see the way this will land is a great celebration deep in my heart i believe over and over again and again god is faithful over and over [Music] over and over again [Music] i couldn't win but i'll jesus the big [Music] [Applause] now the fifth seal begins the sixth chapter of revelations the ninth verse and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh lord holy and true does not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given un unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled notice there is no mention of another beast or a living living creature to this announcement of the fifth seal we know that see there's no living creature notice but here when we come to this fifth seal now [Music] there's there's there's no rider goes forth and there's no beast to announce it that is that the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time the mystery of the antichrist is revealed at this time the antichrist took his last ride and we find him on this pale horse mixed with these many colors and rides all the way into traditions right there they're waving at churches the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of revelation and does not return until it comes back with this king in the 19th chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be see notice when the antichrist they are them them revelations and the presence of that ball of fire hanging out in a room to oh brother although i've seen since a child it every time it comes near me to alarms he almost popped in an unconscious condition now the fifth seal begins the sixth chapter of revelations the ninth verse and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh lord holy and true does not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given on unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled notice there is no mention of another beast or a living living creature to this announcement of the fifth seal we know that see there's no living creature notice but here when we come to this fifth seal now [Music] there's there's there's no rider goes forth and there's no beast to announce it that is that the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time the mystery of the antichrist is revealed at this time the antichrist took his last ride and we find him on this pale horse mixed with these many colors and rides all the way into your traditions right there they're waving at churches the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of revelation and does not return till it comes back with this king in the 19th chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be see notice when the antichrist they have them revelations and the presence of that ball of fire hanging there in a room to the whole brother although i've seen since a child every time it comes near me the larger he almost puts in an unconscious condition you never get used to it you can you're sacred now notice not in the ninth verse souls under the order now here's where i'm going to get some real disagrees but i just watched yesterday yes see i thought that too but it didn't come that way we've i've always thought that these souls are the altar or the the the martyrs of the early church and i'm sure that well dr uh smith and everyone says it is but i thought so myself but when the holy spirit showed the vision to it it wasn't and isn't the soul now who are these souls that's the next thing who are they that if they're not the early church [Music] this is israel that's to be saved as a nation all them that are predestinated that's israel that's israel itself for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of the mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceit [Music] the blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulfilling fullness of the gentiles become in as it is written there shall come out of sound or deliver and shall turn away ungodliness for jacob what israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved notice now i want you to watch this real close they were given robes they didn't have they were given robes white robes each one of them now the saints [Music] now i have already had one they get it here [Music] but there they were given roles and the saints already had theirs and gone on okay see they had these uh souls understanding now that's under the altar why they were martyred by sinful men like eichmann see they're holding out on millions of them but they remain jews now remember what was it they were killed for the word of god say not for the testimony of christ did you understand that but remember the church come in also the martyrs of the church was for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ i mean it was that your condition all right now but these didn't have a testimony jesus christ for the word of god and for the testimony which they helped the jews and hitler hated them so tonight started stalling all the rest of the world but they stayed true to what they believed and they killed them because they were jews [Music] that's right and for the testimony they held they were martyred and your souls are the altar after the church had been gone now what [Music] they had in their blindness martyred their messiah and now they were reaping for it they realized that they recognized edge has gone on they've seen them when they come before the altar of god but now watch the grace of god comes to them and jesus gives them each one a white robe [Music] watch well over after the church is gone like joseph did to his brother a time look when joseph stood there and when he finally he made himself going there with the altar his own offer and his balance his throne he said everybody leave amen his wife was over in the palace [Music] and he said john he said don't you know me hey speaking of hebrew now i'm your brother joseph god did that for a purpose i had you to throw me out in order to save life don't be angry with yourselves remember joseph said that which is the type of 144 thousands we'll get later what he did he just run right quick to when fellow his name started hugging his little brother that had been born into the family after he had been gone by his mother the first church the orthodox church the 144 000 for the barn in his asses while he's away [Music] oh my don't let this do something so we see who they are these jews 144 000 is to be called out by the two witnesses of revelation 11. now remember there was the prophesy notice these souls are to wait a little season for the 144 to be martyred oh isn't that isn't that just puts the bible together well listen i just got something to tell you it's just so good it's just burning right in my heart i hope you haven't forgotten [Music] let me say this in the presence of him by his grace he also let me see my people not long ago and white ruins you remember you remember the story not long ago the gentile bride they're there now they're always in white robes notice this now now if there's no altar of sacrifice in heaven where is a sacrifice for sin land the land there has to be a place for that slaying lamb bloody and laying there or the blood or i do think rather by the opening of this fifth seal as i believe that it's open good i did it with good conscience with clear revelations before god not trying to just make it think because i always was against the organization never would belong to him but it's open to me now [Applause] 17 um [Music] so [Music] good morning i'm going to ask you all please to stand we have a few visitors here this

one we had a wonderful time last last sunday how many enjoyed them you thank the brethren god bless you can you just wave at them god bless you and uh thank you once again for coming blessing us job well done brother brother jerry and brother jonathan lord bless you for that on wednesday we uh happy fourth of july the independence day how many are free this morning amen we are free this morning it's almost leaving amen it's good to have of course i know he was here but brother abe back heard a great testimony from sister jen and uh he's still amen and he's here with us and we thank the lord for that first corinthians the second chapter in the first verse and it reads like this and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god there's a there's there's it all goes together but there's a difference where i determine not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him the next scripture would be we're going to be reading a lot of scriptures hebrews 11 5 and 6. remember this is we're talking of the testimony of jesus christ says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased to he had this testimony amen what was his testimony was it that he did this or he did that or this where he came from he only had one testimony that mattered that's all i want care about anything else i just want this morning to make sure that i please god or without faith the bible says but without faith which is revelation it is impossible to please him or he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him necessary amen for you young people i i gave you those notebooks of course if you have your own notebook you can use your milk but i gave you those notebooks so that you could write some notes so that you can go back home and you can you can remember what was spoken and over and again again and again there's something that is connected with this testimony bible says once again that he had this testimony that before his translation he pleased god and there's nothing greater to me once again like i said than pleasing god you see all the heroes of the faith the revel of hebrews the 11th chapter they all had a testimony that it was by faith by faith that all was accomplished i'm going to say it again all the heroes of the faith had it their testimony was by faith they did these things they had the testimony of god for the word is the testimony of god this is what paul is talking about in first corinthians i didn't come with to you with nice words i didn't come to you with polished words or with some great education i came declaring unto you the testimony of god once again the word is the testimony of god i want us to reflect on our lives this morning what has our testimony been testimonial is our testimony look what i've accomplished in my life think about that that does not please god i want you to get that this morning because it's very important where we're going says in the message god hath the provided way like you are is oh how great it is when god does the miraculous in our lives and we testify about what god did in our lives i think of abraham and sarah waiting wait a minute that was their testimony mary had a great testimony she was the first and only one to ever be overshadowed by the holy ghost and to produce us a son nobody had never happened to anyone this is the son your this is why it's so important young people old people middle aged people it's so important to guard our testimony i the testimony was all the things that god had given in commandments when he gave the ten commandments there was more of course we know than ten yeah but they were kept in an ark that god even placed two cherubims over it can can grasp where we're going this morning jesus said in john 14 15. he loves me see my mice keep my commandments how it means to build a fortress around it but for future generations you will abide in my love now that is the response or that is what jesus said now we're building a platform here today don't forget everything that i've said so far young people any of the young people here what is the testimony of god you're sure all right brother abe says the word you agree with him all right the word is the testimony of god exodus 25 20. and as the holy spirit puts this together we pray and thou shalt put into the ark okay here we go i want to make sure we get this right and thou shalt put into the ark what what what is going to be put into the yard the testimony any testimony it's the testimony that i will give you testimonial what's going to be put into the ark we understand that jesus was the art is that right it's typing christ he already said if you love me keep my commandments now watch this and thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which i shall give you in testimony and the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings and their faces shall look one to another toward the mercy seat which shall towards the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be lost and thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that i shall give thee verse 21 here is the here is another version then you shall put the atoning cover on top of the arc you shall put the testimony which i will give you [Music] can he meet us there if the testimony is not there now watch this now this this is so good to me and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which i will give thee in commandment unto the children of israel out what are the three things that were inside the art quest anybody number one hey gay brother elijah the knot okay the next what is it all right thank you young people amen you're young it's all relative huh there you go you compare yourself to methuselah you're really young yes that was natural bread for a natural man but today we have spiritual bread for the spiritual man now number three then we have numero tres okay we got the pot of manna for the next was what you got to speak louder [Music] once again remember all these three things must be in the arc my question is how many of you have all these three things in your heart how many have a testimony that he or the arc of the testimony and you'll find it you'll find all these three things and they they're all go together but what's important to understand is that wherever the testimony was placed i want you to get this the testimony was so sacred testimony that anything or wherever it was placed but the moment that the testimony was placed in the arkansas testimony in other words the testimony was laid in the ark but because the ark was in the tabernacle now the tabernacle became known as the tabernacle of the testimony now now this i want you to get this okay it's so important to understand it's important how sacred once again how sacred this testimony is but thou shalt appoint the levites over the tabernacle of the testimony and they shall minister unto it and shall then camp round about the tabernacle wow if you have if you're spiritually minded this morning thou shalt appoint the ministers which is the levites over the residence is what tabernacle is i'm going to appoint them over the residents that's how important this testimony is testimony we're getting to some i'm going to get to something good hold your horses the testimony the testimonial is the words of the covenant make sure you write that down young people i'm going to say it again testimony the words of the covenant that's why together yes it's the ark of the covenant and we the bride of christ look at your neighbor and say neighbor you are the words on the pages of the lamb's book of life can we give one to the lord jesus this morning my goodness watch how this all comes together revelations 15 5. cinco watch how it all comes together now how many remember that that moses built the tabernacle according to the pattern that he saw of the temple let's see how powerful this testimony is not only this is how contagious the testimony it's all about the testimony your your understanding of religion and of christianity is so different than mine i don't care what your gender is important [Music] or or what color hair you have okay and all you can see is him vomiting it out that's right how sacred it is to keep yourself young ladies how sacred it is to to watch and keep your eyes things that you're not supposed to do raptured he had a testimony this testimony is god okay we're going to get to this now the testimony the testimonies [Music] the testimony of god himself on mount transfiguration this is god's testimony this is my beloved son hear ye kim that's god's testimony this is the testimonial and when the when so many in the world say ah jesus don't exist why is this so significant significant because the earthly tabernacle in the wilderness it is typing you and i lo it's types the church that's right a tabernacle is a habitation and a testimony in testimonial is something that's evidential when i look at this we read it the way it should be read a sacred place of the habitation of the testimony or the evidence it is cry it is god in christ amen is the word of god in seed form and that was the word of god in the old testament it was the word of god once again in siege form foreign and was manifested before then manifesto from law to grace they could not fathom that think about this i'm going to try to try to uh dramatize this just for a moment right it's so small you can fit it on your finger right that's the word of god in seed forms what is the seed waiting for good ground to be planted it finds the good ground and it grows and it's manifested in your lifestyle wow out of this little seed you should say wow this doesn't mean it's a big old tree all these apples wow that's amazing you preach what you have promise of the promise but right before their eyes see now the word becomes flesh and produces manifest what it is if you would have known your prophet become see he was a man after god's own heart came forth god's own heart did you get that why because it was still a seed in him says that seed needed the rain is the holy ghost but the holy ghost had not [Music] when it begins to produce it no longer is a mystery it is what it is ah that's right when i look at this growing up in the message i find out found out real quick that doesn't give are you listening to me how many of you young people grew up and have grown up in the mess okay i'm going to give you an alert growing up in the message does not give you a free pass into heaven sometimes oh my mom and dad will stand for me so people find me myself all that you love and never love will be there and so they'll stand for me don't look at the job all twisted up that's not the way it is testimony must be inside the ark okay let's stop here for a moment each must have their own experience in the church you'll find all kinds of different people that never grew up in a christian home now is that anybody here praise god look at the hands then there's others that were raised in church and returned back like the prodigal son come on what happened to the hands and it always seems like the worst sinners they got the best testimonies and the one that's been sitting in church their whole life is yeah wow wow that was awesome what happens the wheels start turning maybe i need to go out and taste of the world what a lie of the devil there was a preacher that once said that he was raised in church he always thought that he had to go into the world and sin so he could have a testimony you know as human beings we have everything so backwards all the time okay why do we cry at funerals and are happy when babies are born the bible says that a man born of a woman um and they're coming in they've come home they've graduated that's the way we should be why are we are we wired wrong foreign satan likes to play both sides as well as i do never been out in the world you got to go out and sin and it is a powerful testament he plays both sides is that's awesome but how is it that it's lesser in our minds that in this most wicked age god could keep you guarded from going out there now that doesn't make somebody greater or better than someone else that's been out all right or he wants to deposit in your heart can you protect it with everything this testimony is testimonial what he's trying to do this morning trying to get you to focus on this testimony is not my testimony that's what we focus on too much sure we all have a story sure we all have a testimony but what good is that testimony without the testimony testimonial watch this now find yourself in this and quintus is and i'm going i'm going to go down these my lord i don't know don't worry about water watch this now they can say the rich young ruler el rico him to sell all that he had to take up your cross follow me he went away he couldn't sell out have you done all these the commandments all of them then you still have just the seed now i'm inviting you to get the seat to grow okay chris come follow me but you got to get rid of everything here comes the woman jesus to the woman at the well jesus she must have been a church member at one time because she knew about the father father jacob maybe she thought there was no hope for her she had been married five times the one she was living with now was not her husband maybe in the eyes of man she would never be justified maybe he came from a broken home no one could teach him not in lansing no one to raise him in the admonition of the lord but he recognized that the man on the cross next to him then you have a ruler of the jews a man of experience a man of dignity of authority amongst the religious people may be raised to be a ruler yet knew nothing about being born again i always scratched my hair we would have preached the message of worship to nicodemus this woman that's been married you need to be born again but he preaches to a ruler he must be born again [Music] without who were form the seed the word had become flesh and he's persecuting the ones that are following the manifestation of this again get somebody that maybe matches or we can we we can we can see and say you know that that sounds like me and each one had their testimony there was a point at which jesus showed up there was a point at which jesus came to them he is the word and they either accepted him or they rejected it and those that accepted him are the ones that fulfill the scriptures thou shalt put into the ark the testimony that i shall give thee testimonial let me tell you something saying don't fear your watch how i say this very important well i came from this walk of life or that walk of life do you mean i used to do this i used to do that and be that kind of person because if a person really wants to be morally speaking burning you leave start doing things better the testimony that pleases god and that is the testimony of jesus christ that's the thing that he fears the most think about it god call the disciples train them still they were not witnesses oh no i'm not saying that they have to throw that away because that didn't matter don't get me wrong they would not become witnesses till later on something was still missing all right how many are still with me this morning this morning amen watch now now you can see when we see this and we see what how god does returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us this is their own testimony it is well like it's like i got it now subject unto us praise god we've got it we're not even witnesses yet when jesus but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven your names are written in heaven so don't get excited because some spirits are they they're subject to you and you see so many people think yes because they cast out devils pray for the sick too many miracles didn't let's take away our funny little ideas watch this now no wonder jesus said in acts 1 8. but you shall receive power after but not until after the holy ghost has come upon you especially is one that has a true testimony think about it it wasn't the acts of the apostles because then they would have said look what we're doing especially foreign in this is this is something so good to me then when i see the word unfolding yes two thousand years ago yes it was missing the same lord jesus and forever he perceives the same in every detail yes he is cece okay we're all witnesses now someone's told this now revelations chapter 1 verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass he sentenced signified it by his angel unto his servant john then let me go to verse 2 and then you can you can open me there who bear record of the word of god that's the jews yes yes who bear record of the word of god and of all things that he saw [Music] and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was on the isle that is called patent patmos for two things for two things i was on the owl of patmos because of the old testament and because the new testament that's why he's there what is this he says for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ he was on the isle of patmos because of the things that he bare record of foreign this testimony of jesus christ is the most incredible thing brother says in the message of witnesses and in court in cortes a witness has to know something just anybody can't be a witness that's the way it is when we are witnessing for the lord isaiah 43 8-12 says this write them down and read them again at home this is the testimony of god bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the death that happens is let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth let me go to verse 10 now and you can start ye are my witnesses say it and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after what is testimony this is the testimony of god or me there was no god formed nor will there be one after this quest that's my testimony testimonial but i will say that hey yo this is my beloved son i am so pleased we have too much of that in the church sometimes the pastor said this or the brother said this is [Applause] therefore no man can exactly witness to the resurrection of christ only who are professing to be christians the professors are christians i'm not living like it is that's the thing see yes living with partners and not being married it's the thing that's hurting us and i have some of them come time come to me sometime i'm talking to him and witnessing him about the words that's right you're trying to tell someone of god's word and of church and all these things totally contrary to the word [Applause] you can't be a correct witness without living right yet they want all the benefits of getting married in church with a minister and a white hello everybody and let every man examine himself convictions are happening it's emotion for the majority of the time in church it's nothing but emotion i'm sorry lord [Music] the road testimony of jesus christ [Music] this is the trial going on that's right oh no we just want the mercies of god you want a real trial you want him to try your case we stay a lot this is what we say a lot in church yesterday and then after the investigation there's an indictment formal charges there's a hearing on the system then where is the person this is a courtroom this morning i'm going to understand that this only through the testimony of jesus christ forgiveness of sins there be help time of need i want it more than life itself many people say oh somebody that dies in sin oh they're burning in hell right now no they're not no they're mad can see how many can i have like 10 minutes 15 or 20. hallelujah glory you shall be my wife after you get to seminary school after you are a pastor after you have received the holy ghost then you shall be my witnesses with power throughout the entire world second timothy one second i'm sorry let me go to revelation chapter 6 when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony we just we just saw this right the drawing earlier see the souls but they never had the testimony of jesus christ they were blinded they have not received jesus christ and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death verse 17 and the dragon was wrath with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimonies the remnant of the woman's seed i want you to notice that's the jews watch the dragon coming forth which keep the commandments of god those are jews you have the testimony of jesus christ very important you get that and neither one of these is talking about the bride when i see this and they have the testimony of jesus christ and when i look at this lord i i don't get it i thought the bride was the only one that had the testimony of jesus christ that's the way that i lord how can they have the testimony of jesus christ the testimony yes testimonial i don't know about you but i gotta give one to the lord jesus this morning i looked at that and i said wow [Applause] he doesn't just she's the only one that is the testimony is the testimonial because in her is his spirit he dwells what is his testimony testimonial that i'll never leave you nor that's the testimony of jesus christ he is living proof yeah of jesus christ that's has your deed been cleared potentially you're going to be raised against it has been stricken off abstract to it now you've got the seal it's yours john 3 33 says this is that testimony of jesus christ you are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge even as the testimony of christ i have the testimony testimony he says you will recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message this book we are studying actual revelation of jesus in the church and his work but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven but the word to them is still in seed form then a prophet comes on the scene oh church this is it i'm finishing here then a prophet comes on the scene you know what he says he said that's thus saith the lord [Music] divine interpreter of the word testimony which is the word the life of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy that's why he can say thus saith

testimony of jesus christ but somebody sent this to my wife i think it might have been so successful but it's a little story of a person that had land had had some sheep says that one of the lambs got bit by a rattlesnake in its face said that it's they swelled is see what the serpent also doesn't know venom is most often made with sheep blood and after two days the blood of the lamb destroyed the
