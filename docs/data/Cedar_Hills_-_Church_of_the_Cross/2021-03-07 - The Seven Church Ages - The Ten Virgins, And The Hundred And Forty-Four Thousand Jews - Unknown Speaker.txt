========================================

now this morning we're going to try to tie the lord willing some of those things in of the uh between the church ages these right in here there's something goes in 144 000 the rendez the sleeping virgin the wise virgin and the ceiling of the holy ghost marking of the beast all those things in the and the dark age of 1500 the uh catholic hierarchy when they was established in united church and state together that was a post-millennium they thought that they were they were absolutely in the millennium because the church had received its biker one like christ to sit on a throne and uh it was united with the church and state all had become well and the great millennium is on they still believe that but that's an era because the millennium can't come can't be issued in without the coming of christ christ brings in the millennium amen he's the son of prosperity and when he comes in will be a thousand years and what it is it'll be the rapture the church shall go up and then the return of christ and remember now what's the next thing we're looking for the rapture of the church now remember we're going to deal on that sharp this morning you're either in that body or out of that body no halfway between them there's no pretty good christians and and uh they're either christians or you're not christian we have this new birth now which is a spiritual that breeds out all the cult and we are new creatures in christ jesus born again of the spirit of god new creatures there is a remnant of jews to be saved and there is a jew which is a cast off because giving us a chance there is a lukewarm church and there is a spirit-filled church now this remnant was the sleeping virgin the unbeliever of that you be unbeliever and that's the center and here is another one which is a formal upper f-o formal church and then here is the other one which is the saved church sk the sage church now keep them in mind all the time now in this saved church there's two classes in this church right here right here which was type of christ one was a sleeping virgin and the other one had oil in the land now first before we do that we're going to 144 000 of revelation 7 so that it can really be understood after these things i saw four angels standing on the four cars the earth holding the four winds that they should not blow up on the earth or on the seer any tree and i saw another angel descending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was hurt he was given to hurt the sea and the earth saying hurt not the earth neither the sea or tree until we have sealed the servants of our god in their forehead now remember the servants has always been god's servants is the jew abraham was his servant the gentile is not a servant it's a bride it's a son this is the son the churches the jews are the servants so just remember trace that through the bible you'll find that the jew is god's servant now you see and then all of jerusalem was destroyed now that now this year is perfectly a parallel revelation seven now watch from the time of tightest besieging jerusalem within the world there hasn't been a time down to history that all the world went to war until 1914. now listen close and so then uh this all of them was marching toward you well remembered at 19 and 14. now is this strange right in the decline of the world's war i have the volumes of it volume 2 about page 44 that they do not know to this day who stopped that war it's god that stopped him the fulfillings were just at the breaking of pentecost back in 1906 1914 down there now to see whether this message that we got is connected with it or not the very hour that israel was signed in to be a nation it was the very same hour very same day very same month everything else i was at greensville indiana when that angel there appeared to me and sent me out on the deal with this i actually met me down on the river and told me what would take place that commissioned me 11 years later at the same hour that israel was signed in as a nation it's all connected together see the age of the lord is on earth now see he's moving around fixing everything for the coming of the lord and one angel went down in one state with abraham the elect sodom was down here and lock was inside and two angels went down there and preached to them and brought that little bitty group out sleeping virgin all right but see without intellectual preaching the thing your ears here but he's trying to jerk out solomon try to jerk out or give grace to that sleeping virgin amen but here was abraham and his christ and jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and then there was a space given then for the gentiles and they come down to this age then there's three and a half years left yet for the jews now i want to prove that there are jews now i'm going to take the same hurt not the earth neither the sea or any tree until we seal the servants of our god in their forehead now to prove that this revelation is right watch this the fourth verse and i heard the number of them were sealed and there were sealed [Music] 144 000 all of the tribes are the children of israel israelites for the act they're just now gathered they're up there already waiting for the ceiling time to come of the tribe of jude was sealed twelve thousand tribe of reuben twelve thousand tribe of gab twelve thousand eight through twelve thousand neptune twelve thousand and one simeon and on down to benjamin the 12 tribes and 12 times 12 is 144 000. see now that's the one now if you look in the 14th chapter just a moment here you see and i looked and lo a lamb stood on mount sinai and with him 144 000 having his father's name written in their forehead mount sinai the lamb had come back from the rapture and come back as we tucked the other night and joseph dismissed all the gentiles when he stood by his brother the jews always believed their prophets we all know that because god told him that the messiah would be a prophet you'll be a secret coming no one know what's going to happen we don't we don't meet him first we meet one another first and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive that it remains shall be changed standing in the field of change come on the gray hair go out the wrinkles all away be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and we shall meet our loved ones first and then together with them that we're dead says the scripture will be caught up in the air to meet the lord the order they're coming that comes 144 000. we'll receive the gospel after we can't receive it the same time the light is on the gentiles the jews are denying it hiding now when the gentiles is taken up then the spirit comes up on two to give witness to them then the jews receive it which is 144 000 of the lost tribes of israel will receive the gospel and the bride is taken away now there's 10 virgins let's strike matthew 21 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom now and five of them were wise and five were foolish and they that were foolish took their lamps and took the aura with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried let's see these church ages they're slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him and all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said said unto the wise give us of your oral for our lamps are gone out but the wires answered saying not so unless there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves pardon me and while they went to bob the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us i see there wasn't unbelievers just good people open to us but the answer but he answered and said dearly i say unto you i know you not once therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man shall come now watch the both of them were virgins if you take that name virgin and run it down it means that means holy clean sanctified so the greek word for clean is sanctified the hebrew word is holy holy clean and sanctified is all the same word so this was not a filthy dirty church it was a sanctified clean church 10 virgins went out to meet the bridegroom what does it mean all these churches not now not down here in the roman but down into the denominations all of them well to meet the bridegroom right now that was the virgins went out to meet him and the foolish virgins now did not have oil in their lane but they had everything else they were clean they believed in christ they preached the word they believed their denomination let him preach this one could not go in or there was no oil in the land they went back to pray up to receive the holy ghost but while they were gone it's all over amen now you get it while they went to buy they're trying to buy now all the church is trying to have a revival revival is trying to go back here goes the church home it goes home here is the remnant that's left over and here is the 144 thousand on mount sinai are the jews not three different brides it's the pride b remnant and 144 thousand exactly i remember as i said everything's a tree his coming is in a three the first time he came to redeem his bride the second time he comes to catch away his bride like a love affair comes around feels right at night time takes away the world eating in the air the secret coming of the law the second time he come is to receive his bride first time to redeemer second time to receiver and the third time winter king and queen oh don't you love him
