[27:00] Felipe

[27:13] Jesus
[27:16] 45 45
[27:20] we have found him who who Moses and
[27:24] Allah and the prophets did right Jesus
[27:27] of Nazareth the son of Joseph
[27:33] Felipe and Nathaniel said unto him can
[27:37] there any good thing come out of
[27:39] Nazareth
[27:55] behold in Israelite indeed in whom there
[27:58] is no goal
[28:01] Jesus
[28:11] thou me Jesus answered and said unto him
[28:14] before that Philip called thee when thou
[28:17] was under the Fig Tree I saw thee
[28:19] respond
[28:28] where the where are the Thou Art the Son
[28:32] of God Thou Art the king of Israel
[28:35] Lord good evening
[28:37] we report for service
[28:40] testifying Lord
[28:42] that we believe your word
[28:46] and we believe the message
[28:50] we hunger and thirst for righteousness
[28:55] lift our faith this evening
[28:59] so that we can receive healing
[29:01] liberations
[29:04] and all good uh Redemptive blessings
[29:09] we send a blessing to our pastor and
[29:12] those who their men that are with them
[29:15] name of the Lord Jesus amen
[29:21] make yourselves comfortable
[29:28] now for a second here I want to open up
[29:31] this picture here
[29:32] now here is Nathaniel is
[29:39] the scripture says that this is a man
[29:41] that there is no no
[29:46] Felipe
[29:48] now I want you to notice how Philip
[29:51] comes to Nathaniel means
[29:55] now look at the message that Philip
[29:57] brings to Nathaniel
[30:00] verse 45.
[30:05] we will find it Nathaniel and saith unto
[30:08] him
[30:14] we have found him who Moses in Allah
[30:19] and the prophets are Jesus
[30:24] did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of
[30:27] Joseph is
[30:29] now these four things here is
[30:36] now this was too much for Nathaniel
[31:29] they all were dressed the same and they
[31:31] all had beards
[31:33] but when Nathaniel comes to Jesus
[31:36] now notice what Jesus says
[31:42] Behold a true Israelites
[31:46] who in their heart there is no deceit
[31:49] Jesus
[31:50] Jesus being the word
[31:53] identified
[31:56] identifies a predestinated seed
[32:00] now Nathaniel he is surprised
[32:04] Jesus no hold on
[32:07] how do you know me
[32:09] from where no it's not me
[32:13] and before Philip called you
[32:19] when you were praying underneath the Fig
[32:21] Tree I saw you
[32:24] that proved that Jesus
[32:30] was manifesting the signs
[32:37] for the people of Israel
[32:47] the words of Nathaniel
[32:49] Ravi they are they're Rabbi tueres
[32:54] the Son of God
[32:56] the king of Israel
[32:59] that confession
[33:04] that what Jesus declared of Nathaniel
[33:08] And he was a genuine Israelite
[33:11] it was the truth
[33:13] because when he saw this
[33:17] in his heart
[33:21] now if Jesus was here
[33:24] oh it would be something fantastic
[33:28] will be something great that it will
[33:30] reap that she will repeat itself
[34:19] [Music]
[34:38] being made
[35:01] the king of Israel
[35:04] Glory
[35:05] Lafayette faith
[35:08] seem very simple
[35:10] without faith it is impossible to please
[35:12] God this is
[35:16] the scripture says that we can even
[35:18] approach god without faith
[35:23] but what kind of Faith are you speaking
[35:25] of Brothers
[35:28] when I read the message of brother
[35:30] Branham I can see
[35:33] the desperation that brother Branham
[36:00] same words
[36:04] now that is where I'm going to speak of
[36:06] the faith
[36:09] foreign
[36:12] I'm going to say this with all respect
[36:16] I can see so many things that are absurd
[36:18] that look us crazy
[36:21] because
[36:23] it doesn't have limits
[36:27] you might say oh brother Diego I have a
[36:29] serious problem
[36:31] nobody can help me
[36:33] oh brother I'm sick
[36:37] the doctors cannot help me Hermano
[36:44] oh brother only God can help me in this
[36:47] situation
[36:48] the only thing that you need is is Faith
[36:53] because
[36:55] you cannot burn it
[36:59] you can't uh imprison it Lafayette
[37:05] you cannot just put it in one small spot
[37:10] it is
[37:25] now for a second here I I asked a
[37:28] question
[37:31] how is it a seraphenician woman here in
[37:33] the Bible is
[37:36] she came from uh the area of Tyrion and
[37:40] uh
[37:41] silence
[37:45] now this place was such a low and wicked
[37:48] place at the time
[37:52] that the Israelites were called the
[37:54] people that live their dogs
[37:58] that's how bad it was
[38:02] and the story says that even Jezebel
[38:06] came out of there
[38:07] and it has has a reason
[38:11] when
[38:13] this woman approaches Jesus
[38:18] the Bible tells me that the whole world
[38:20] ignores her
[38:22] while this woman is
[38:27] a woman that doesn't have a problem
[38:56] son of David
[39:29] and I give it to the dogs do you
[39:32] understand that
[39:34] you understand
[39:36] says
[39:58] [Music]
[40:08] that she overcame God
[40:14] you know listen
[40:15] Jesus
[40:17] never prayed for this woman
[40:20] now if you go to the scriptures
[40:24] Jesus never even gave her a word he just
[40:28] said woman
[40:29] as thou has believed
[40:32] let it be done
[40:34] Jesus didn't do nothing
[40:37] Jesus didn't heal the woman
[40:44] healing yes that's
[40:47] the faith of the Gentiles
[40:52] that would you confess in your heart
[41:00] he didn't even pray for her
[41:03] but she received what she what she
[41:07] believed
[41:09] there's another woman here in the Bible
[41:12] this woman lived in hell
[41:15] for 10 years
[41:17] she had a blood issue
[41:20] she had wasted all her money
[41:24] the doctors told her we cannot help you
[41:26] anymore
[41:29] we're such a miserable life of this
[41:31] woman
[41:34] I believe that this woman she was even
[41:37] separated from the fellowship
[41:39] because it was part of the law she was
[41:43] she was unclean
[41:45] and everything that she would touch
[41:47] would be honest
[41:49] now if you talk about desperation
[41:52] depression is
[41:55] [Music]
[42:04] I already said
[42:06] like
[42:08] you are in the same experience
[42:13] this woman she had reason
[42:15] pero
[42:17] is
[42:18] now but she knew something better
[42:22] she believed in her heart
[42:26] can only Touch the Hem of His Garment
[42:29] now listen
[42:32] we have read this many times but I want
[42:36] to shake you
[42:39] where did this woman
[42:41] where does women get that inspiration
[42:46] of Jesus
[42:48] he was going to receive the healing
[42:52] I don't read that in the Bible
[42:56] now here comes Jesus and his disciples
[43:03] when all of a sudden Jesus
[43:06] they have to hold them they have to lift
[43:08] them up
[43:09] who touched me is
[43:43] His Garment
[43:45] she can be healed
[43:51] when Jesus finds her he says
[43:53] great is thy faith
[43:58] as the second you touch it it left you
[44:03] Jesus never prayed for this woman
[44:08] you see that Jesus never prayed
[44:12] she received what she believed
[44:17] yeah
[44:18] hola
[44:20] foreign
[44:51] [Applause]
[45:11] [Applause]
[45:21] now let me take you to this in this
[45:24] picture here the scene
[45:27] I believe that the apostles they were
[45:30] here they were busy
[45:33] maybe they were somewhere
[46:20] I'm able to see this
[46:59] [Applause]
[47:19] when the service was over
[47:53] that's Faith
[47:57] the Bible says
[47:59] Paul
[48:04] Thomas
[48:05] that they took of his body
[48:08] is
[48:13] they took it to the sick and they were
[48:15] healed
[48:16] we've read it many times
[48:20] Let Us return
[48:22] because there was one
[48:24] there was one crazy
[48:27] that was out of his mind
[48:31] maybe he said Paul
[48:35] my mom is really sick
[48:51] would you let me borrow your
[48:53] handkerchief
[48:57] what do you want to do with my
[48:59] handkerchief
[49:00] I believe
[49:03] that's the same anointing that is
[49:05] going to be upon this this handkerchief
[49:09] I believe that Paul says
[49:20] she got better
[49:23] when this man goes and testifies
[49:29] it worked for him
[49:32] it can also work for me
[49:34] that's right that's right
[49:41] he says these words
[49:46] when a man is Guided by the Holy Spirit
[49:50] he is a messenger of God
[49:52] e
[49:54] ustaceans if you're a messenger of God
[49:58] you are an angel of God
[50:02] brother Brandon says that you can't
[50:04] separate these two words
[50:07] he says who has more Authority
[50:10] an angel from heaven or an angel from
[50:14] behind the pulpit
[50:16] says to the angel behind the pulpit
[50:21] because Jesus said all power
[50:24] in heaven
[50:28] first so much
[50:32] Jesus Jesus
[50:34] that overcame
[50:36] before he ascended
[50:50] now go
[50:54] brother Branham says
[50:57] that when he sends you he goes with you
[51:01] oh Brothers
[51:04] oh that makes me feel good but
[51:07] brother Brandon says
[51:15] the church this great church what can
[51:17] only comprehend
[51:21] has power to be able to do these things
[51:24] pero estan
[51:27] but they are trying to deny to doubt
[51:30] more they have beer
[51:33] is
[51:36] and they asked themselves the question
[51:38] is it really going to happen
[51:40] brother Branham says
[51:47] as long as the church exists in this way
[51:53] she can never stand to her feet
[51:56] the musicians will come
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:57] I have all these problems
[53:23] on a
[53:24] we suffer too much
[53:26] you only have two options
[53:30] you have a miserable life
[53:33] or take a step of Faith
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:38] Lord this message
[53:51] Daniel chapter 12 El Pueblo the the
[53:55] people
