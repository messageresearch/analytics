[33:13] [Music]
[33:23] i wanted just to see them dance and get
[33:25] me pumped up
[33:25] [Applause]
[33:36] i know
[33:37] we probably didn't eat enough so
[33:39] okay
[33:41] [Music]
[33:46] tell me your faces my goodness
[33:50] it's okay me too
[34:03] foreign
[34:14] amen
[34:17] all right now that we all giggled and
[34:34] and
[34:37] you know this is the fifth time i've uh
[34:39] been
[34:40] blessed to go
[34:42] yes
[34:45] so it was really um it was really a
[34:48] pleasure and honor to be able to see all
[34:51] the the
[34:52] young men that have gone for the first
[34:54] time
[34:59] and i sure did enjoy it to see the lord
[35:01] jesus christ work in them
[35:08] and you begin to see an establishment
[35:10] within the body
[35:14] in each one of them
[35:17] and and for
[35:19] for
[35:19] for any of us that have the holy spirit
[35:26] we have
[35:27] we have one desire and that's to serve
[35:29] the lord jesus christ
[35:34] all we want to do is stay in his perfect
[35:36] will
[35:39] and our main
[35:53] but the most precious thing to him on
[35:55] this earth
[36:02] so when you see
[36:04] the body start to get established
[36:09] in yourself in others
[36:14] and you you start to see another half of
[36:16] you coming
[36:18] together
[36:25] i just
[36:26] very
[36:27] very proud of
[36:28] just to be part and to be side by side
[36:31] with each and every one of the men that
[36:33] went
[36:34] on
[36:39] you know brother
[36:40] going with brother jimmy the endocrine
[36:42] jaime
[36:43] he uh he just never ceases to amaze me
[36:48] i mean this guy deserves a hand of a
[36:51] cause honestly
[36:52] este
[36:56] he said he said he's never been uh
[36:59] spoiled before like he was this truth
[37:16] and it's because the spirit of jesus
[37:18] christ is in him
[37:21] and so as that maturity starts to grow
[37:23] it just starts to pour out
[37:29] so
[37:31] it was just a pleasure with our brothers
[37:33] in colorado
[37:46] you think it's over and they come in and
[37:48] just start just letting off rounds out
[37:50] of their their mouths
[37:53] okay
[37:58] yeah yeah so if we can stand and you
[38:01] know
[38:05] and if we can turn to the second book of
[38:07] timothy
[38:11] chapter two capital dose
[38:22] go for it
[38:32] thou therefore my son be strong in the
[38:35] grace that is in christ jesus
[38:42] jesus and the things that thou has heard
[38:45] of me among many witnesses the same
[38:47] commit thou to faithful men
[38:50] we shall be able to teach others also
[38:58] edonias
[39:02] thou therefore endure hard hardness as a
[39:05] good soldier of jesus christ
[39:12] no man that worth entangled
[39:14] tingleth himself with the affairs of
[39:17] this life
[39:19] that he may please him who have chosen
[39:21] him to be a soldier
[39:39] you know that um i read that scripture
[39:42] up there in in africa
[39:45] in africa
[39:47] that scripture has always stood out to
[39:49] me
[39:54] recently the lord's been
[39:57] working with me on that scripture
[40:04] and if i can i want to read it in the
[40:06] new kings james version
[40:12] just so maybe some of our young
[40:14] or some of a soldier can
[40:18] grasp it a little bit but i can just do
[40:20] something
[40:21] to try to break it up in phrases and
[40:23] i'll just okay
[40:25] i don't have to read it
[40:28] you then my son be strong in the grace
[40:34] that is in christ jesus
[40:36] jesus and the things you have heard of
[40:38] me say in the presence of many witnesses
[40:45] entrust to reliable people who will also
[40:48] be qualified
[40:50] against
[41:07] no one serving as a soldier gets
[41:09] entangled in civilian affairs
[41:18] but rather tries to please his
[41:20] commanding officer
[41:27] we heard we heard brother tommy this
[41:29] morning say that we are blessed
[41:34] and i know we hear that time and time
[41:36] again
[41:39] and i know we say yes we are
[41:41] you simply give us almost and i believe
[41:43] that most of the time we believe it
[41:46] is
[42:05] if this was let's say i hadn't had a
[42:08] bottle of water or i had to drink water
[42:10] all week long this is my first bottle
[42:11] yes
[42:27] well after that it's gone and probably
[42:29] by the end of the night i'll forget that
[42:32] hunger or desire that i had for that
[42:34] water especially
[42:39] i know i can go pick it up and drink it
[42:40] any time
[42:49] but
[42:52] if i could if if that can be a type of
[42:55] what i'm trying to say siesta
[43:10] i made this statement up there
[43:12] i have been five-fold trained
[43:15] every one of you also has yes
[43:24] and
[43:26] for me but i mean you can see paul
[43:29] instructing his his men
[43:34] telling him to
[43:35] at first when i read this i thought uh
[43:37] he's just telling timothy to be
[43:46] but the reason why he's telling timothy
[43:48] this is because he's starting to feel a
[43:50] little bit of pressure there
[43:52] is
[44:13] and going up there i was able to see
[44:17] i was able to see the pieces of the body
[44:19] it wasn't just cedar hills
[44:26] and and we know that because our pastor
[44:28] never says it's just us
[44:45] they both taught us to be servants uh
[44:52] and to be a servant to the lord jesus
[44:53] christ we have to be servants to his
[44:55] children
[44:59] so you you start to put yourself aside
[45:01] instead commence your opponents
[45:04] and you start to just focus on
[45:07] his children
[45:12] and
[45:13] i could see
[45:15] i could see the man up there
[45:18] basically the same thing
[45:23] i think i've said that before it's the
[45:25] same thing that goes on up there that
[45:26] goes down over here
[45:31] maybe in a different
[45:33] level as far as poverty
[45:39] corruption of the world the word
[45:44] but as i i was able to see it um
[45:47] it really started to hit me
[45:54] because
[45:56] you start to hurt for people's souls you
[46:03] and
[46:04] brother branham even faced the same
[46:06] things while he was going you got to say
[46:07] what you got to say what we're going to
[46:09] tell you or we're going to cut you off
[46:10] you can't be part of it
[46:24] [Music]
[46:33] sometimes i don't
[46:34] get it because maybe
[46:40] it's not just that reason but maybe i
[46:42] wouldn't be here i wouldn't be coming to
[46:43] church if it wasn't just to praise the
[46:45] lord jesus christ
[46:52] i mean if we're not coming to serve the
[46:53] lord and to praise him
[46:59] to me it's to me it's just a waste of
[47:01] time
[47:03] but we know that we come over here to
[47:06] serve to listen to fill ourselves to
[47:09] praise him
[47:15] and we know that it shouldn't stop when
[47:17] we leave these four walls
[47:22] and there was a within saying all that
[47:27] there was this young man
[47:30] that
[47:31] would always be around us
[47:36] but since
[47:38] money came into the picture with him and
[47:40] his family
[47:47] he he couldn't be with us
[48:00] and i was able to see just the hurt
[48:02] inside of him
[48:14] i was able to see all the
[48:18] the lies and the deceiving
[48:21] tongues that have been
[48:22] put inside his ears
[48:31] it just wasn't my same little buddy no
[48:32] more yeah
[48:36] and
[48:38] it really hurts
[48:42] strange
[48:45] it was strange to see
[48:51] but
[48:51] then i i caught myself and i said well
[48:53] don't you you see the same thing over
[48:55] here too
[49:01] so what i'm going to end with saying
[49:08] is the missionary doesn't stop or start
[49:11] and stop once you leave the country
[49:14] i don't
[49:28] man
[49:30] these people that the grandest of us i
[49:33] have a pastor that
[49:36] i know that we may
[49:37] for me
[49:41] when when correction comes all the time
[49:43] i'm not like oh yeah okay
[49:50] no i'm not
[49:51] you know you'll see sometimes i might be

[1:06:16] life

[1:06:55] officer saying
[1:06:56] restore all that was hers and all the
[1:06:59] fruits of the field since the day that
[1:07:01] she left the land even until now
[1:07:08] or not
[1:07:26] and now matthew chapter 13.
[1:07:30] verse 45 and 46.
[1:07:36] again the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[1:07:38] a merchant man
[1:07:40] seeking goodly pearls
[1:07:42] who when he had found one pearl of great
[1:07:44] price
[1:07:45] went and saw all that he had and bought
[1:07:47] it
[1:07:53] buenos
[1:08:08] like to thank our pastor for the
[1:08:09] opportunity
[1:08:13] and for the opportunity to be able to to
[1:08:15] go on this trip with all these great men
[1:08:21] and before before we left
[1:08:26] our pastor he he gave me this discern
[1:08:28] word a certain phrase
[1:08:32] which by now you have heard
[1:08:36] for this cause have i come into the
[1:08:38] world
[1:08:41] now
[1:08:43] you hear certain things
[1:08:47] and you you may say well you know that
[1:08:49] sounds good yeah
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:56] oh it sounds so good but it's not until
[1:08:59] you you get the revelation of it
[1:09:04] it takes someone to receive that word
[1:09:09] and to catch the revelation of it
[1:09:13] so that it can change your life
[1:09:18] it's life changing it can be
[1:09:20] right about a a year and four months ago
[1:09:23] i arrived here in las cruces i said
[1:09:28] in las cruces and and i would have never
[1:09:30] imagined myself here perhaps two or
[1:09:32] three years ago
[1:09:37] much less to to go on a trip like this
[1:09:44] for this cause
[1:09:46] i
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:10:28] it'll be
[1:10:41] it's a different kind of food it's not
[1:10:44] the food of denominations
[1:10:46] it's not the food or nothing else no
[1:10:48] it's the food of the world
[1:10:50] and christ is the word
[1:10:52] so when you start to change
[1:11:08] and then we go home
[1:11:16] oh
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:26] so
[1:11:27] when you see something like that
[1:11:32] you see all these seasoned ministers
[1:11:38] or pastors
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:06] and you begin to ask yourself
[1:12:09] you begin to to take inventory
[1:12:14] but the lord has restored all things
[1:12:19] right all the things that that you need
[1:12:21] that the lord needs from you
[1:12:26] they're already inside of you
[1:12:29] they just need to be stirred you need to
[1:12:31] stir the gifts
[1:12:35] i don't believe isaiah felt very worthy
[1:12:40] a man of unclean lips
[1:12:44] but yeah he said lord here am i
[1:12:48] send me
[1:12:49] on me
[1:12:50] i hope it's something i i can relate to
[1:12:52] our youth today
[1:12:57] right we we i i came from georgia
[1:13:00] georgia and i found a pearl of great
[1:13:02] price
[1:13:06] you come here and and the word doesn't
[1:13:08] come back
[1:13:13] there's a substance here are you not
[1:13:14] substantial and a lot of times we can
[1:13:17] take it for granted
[1:13:20] but i i hope that you can say
[1:13:24] that you've sold everything so that you
[1:13:26] can buy this pearl of great price
[1:13:45] also justified
[1:13:48] in whom he justified
[1:13:51] them he also glorified me
[1:13:54] and it is the reason why we've come into
[1:13:56] this world
[1:14:25] and every day there was a brother there
[1:14:30] and he would say
[1:14:32] he'd say thank you for loving us
[1:14:36] each day he would say the same thing
[1:14:38] thank you for loving it
[1:14:40] gracias
[1:14:53] it is a pearl of great price
[1:14:57] they were able to to come into these
[1:14:59] meetings
[1:15:02] and they were able to hear from these
[1:15:04] great ministers
[1:15:22] and i believe it's done the same for all
[1:15:24] of you
[1:15:27] right
[1:15:29] it was such a tremendous trip
[1:15:33] it changes the way you the way you look
[1:15:35] at life
[1:15:39] we take all these things for granted
[1:15:43] and you think you have you think you
[1:15:45] have problems you say
[1:15:48] but you go over there and you step up
[1:16:01] but if you take something from from what
[1:16:04] i speak today
[1:16:18] someone from the outside looking in
[1:16:21] post
[1:16:24] i can tell you first hand
[1:16:26] this is the best there is
[1:16:29] so god bless
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:48] you all want to know the story of who
[1:16:49] are you
[1:16:52] brother william and william i i was very
[1:16:55] impressed by brother william
[1:16:59] william not only the way he spoke in
[1:17:00] uganda
[1:17:15] tell them william i i saw i saw my
[1:17:18] grandpa preaching
[1:17:21] my grandpa preaching through brother
[1:17:22] williams
[1:17:26] i had no words to try to get him an amen
[1:17:28] to encourage him or nothing
[1:17:31] all of a sudden brother alex comes
[1:17:33] through
[1:17:35] alex and he says who are you bro
[1:17:38] nobody can believe brother william was
[1:17:40] just like oh my gosh who is this guy
[1:17:46] and that's how i felt towards every
[1:17:48] person that went on this trip
[1:17:52] i watched brother noah's speak
[1:17:55] via manonova
[1:18:13] and i and i would hear him say that time
[1:18:15] and time again
[1:18:18] i would hear our pastor
[1:18:20] say the same thing
[1:18:22] i'd hear brother benji brother benji
[1:18:24] would get a little bit more forceful
[1:18:25] with me
[1:18:28] what is your problem bro let's go
[1:18:32] and uh and and you know what
[1:18:35] you can hear all day long the greatness
[1:18:37] of god
[1:18:52] to build up a thing in your
[1:18:55] on the trip
[1:18:58] that you know we are made up of many
[1:19:00] members
[1:19:03] not just one of us could do it by
[1:19:04] ourselves
[1:19:34] it pushes you to limits that you didn't
[1:19:37] think you could go
[1:19:40] i i as i went on this trip
[1:19:44] i i used to be upset at every missionary
[1:19:46] trip to africa
[1:20:02] i had a dream
[1:20:04] and in this dream
[1:20:06] i saw all these african people
[1:20:09] and i could see like a far away off
[1:20:13] i could see our pastor brother caleb
[1:20:16] i could see
[1:20:58] and i turned and i
[1:21:12] million dollars
[1:21:15] it was not dollar-wise
[1:21:19] i want you to give me all that you are
[1:21:22] okay
[1:21:24] give it all to africa
[1:21:52] you can hear daddy and mama do all these
[1:21:54] great things for the lord
[1:22:00] year after year
[1:22:04] and you know i'm gonna tell you
[1:22:05] something
[1:22:06] you will die in your pew vara
[1:22:22] that you'll never be as great as them
[1:22:25] you have no business giving god all your
[1:22:27] heart
[1:22:30] and let me tell you something
[1:22:32] don't make mistake
[1:22:34] after mistake
[1:22:36] after mistake
[1:22:44] you start losing your desire to want to
[1:22:46] do the will of the lord
[1:22:50] that's where
[1:23:17] i found god in africa
[1:23:31] and i'm going to read this in a
[1:23:32] different version
[1:23:36] but it says this verse 5
[1:23:39] it says for i
[1:23:41] the lord your god
[1:23:43] am a jealous god
[1:23:46] punishing the children of the sin of
[1:23:48] their parents to the third and the
[1:23:49] fourth generation of those who hate me
[1:23:56] quebecois
[1:24:03] but
[1:24:05] but showing love to a thousand
[1:24:09] generations
[1:24:11] of those who love me and keep my
[1:24:14] commandments
[1:24:24] we always like to think that it's just
[1:24:26] the iniquity that visits us
[1:24:41] because one thing that we know in this
[1:24:43] church
[1:24:45] is that our parents
[1:24:47] and our grandparents
[1:24:49] they serve the lord no matter what
[1:24:56] grandchildren you got to get your mind
[1:24:59] right
[1:25:01] and say this
[1:25:03] that's the love of god
[1:25:05] and this tender mercies jesus
[1:25:08] because of what my grandparents had
[1:25:10] loved
[1:25:23] that's the same love
[1:26:06] and i couldn't stop crying
[1:26:09] you see levels of poverty that
[1:26:13] that shouldn't exist
[1:26:18] you see them have nothing
[1:26:43] you came to church because you wanted to
[1:26:45] us
[1:26:47] mama and daddy grabbed you and yanked
[1:26:48] you into church
[1:26:51] when's the last time
[1:26:53] ultimate came with an expectancy in your
[1:26:55] heart
[1:26:58] nowadays
[1:27:00] you have to force people in the door
[1:27:16] hey bro what'd you get drawn for it
[1:27:21] what do you want to eat afterwards
[1:27:24] no no no no that's not what they're
[1:27:25] talking about
[1:27:27] they were already singing praises to the
[1:27:28] lord
[1:27:30] they were already
[1:27:42] i never been so excited to go to church
[1:27:44] in my life like that
[1:27:55] they don't look at you the way you're
[1:27:56] looking at me right now no no no no no
[1:27:58] no
[1:28:12] what's going on
[1:28:37] and i thought they get crazy when
[1:28:39] they're worship like they get like
[1:28:40] charismatic with their worship
[1:28:46] they don't no but
[1:28:48] i'm sorry but they don't know
[1:28:50] no there's a sincerity to their worship
[1:28:54] and
[1:29:35] that was the moment i waited for my
[1:29:37] whole life
[1:29:39] i never wanted to preach in any country
[1:29:41] of the world
[1:29:44] but i wanted to preach in uganda
[1:29:47] in uganda and let me tell you becoming
[1:29:49] the civilized it was hard
[1:30:04] as i began to minister
[1:30:07] i saw the very thing that held me back
[1:30:10] my life
[1:30:13] and i saw him standing in the middle of
[1:30:16] the aisle
[1:30:19] and it was a demon it wasn't none of the
[1:30:21] brothers from africa it was the demons
[1:30:24] in africa and i went to him
[1:30:27] and i told him today
[1:30:29] i used to be a little boy and i used to
[1:30:31] be afraid
[1:30:45] you know the devil comes
[1:31:23] when you see what these brothers
[1:31:24] sacrificed just to be in church
[1:31:53] you know i don't feel too good today
[1:31:55] maybe i'll go maybe i won't it's not
[1:31:57] boring
[1:31:58] it's not their expectations
[1:32:02] as they waited all week long to go to
[1:32:04] church
[1:32:07] and when you see them
[1:32:09] and their hunger
[1:32:25] but i'll tell you this as i get ready to
[1:32:27] close i got a few few minutes here
[1:32:32] i i had never
[1:32:35] never been so happy to be there
[1:32:38] be a part
[1:32:49] because brother mark's background is
[1:32:50] he's a fighter
[1:32:52] i
[1:33:06] as i got sick over there
[1:33:09] i didn't need uncle caleb to tell me
[1:33:10] quit being a baby and go up there no no
[1:33:12] no
[1:33:14] no no
[1:33:15] i had brother mark to tell me
[1:33:17] the question brother mark just looked me
[1:33:18] in the eye
[1:33:21] he said you know it's just the devil
