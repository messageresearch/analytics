[9:30] a helpless man flying from birth
[9:33] the only one who saw his worth didn't
[9:37] pass
[9:37] in my he
[9:40] heard his cry
[9:42] [Music]
[9:43] he rubbed his eyes with a handful of
[9:46] clay then he said go
[9:48] washing the pool today and the blind man
[9:51] knew
[9:53] that's what he had to do
[9:57] you know along the way he couldn't help
[10:01] but trip and fall
[10:07] [Music]
[10:16] is faith

[10:23] oh i'm gonna just believe he hears my
[10:28] prayer

[10:33] the miracle promised by my father
[10:38] is waiting in the water
[10:46] i walked in darkness i won't lie
[10:50] just like that blind man sometimes i
[10:53] felt all alone like all
[10:57] hope was gone
[11:00] i know that his word is true and no
[11:04] matter
[11:04] what i'm going through he promised me
[11:09] that he would never leave

[12:42] is waiting in the
[12:45] [Music]
[12:51] the water
[12:56] it's waiting in the water
[13:09] [Applause]
[13:19] now we notice now as we go into the
[13:23] sixth seal now may the heavenly father
[13:25] help us as we settle down now
[13:27] to this sixth seal now
[13:31] this twelfth verse of the sixth chapter
[13:35] and i beheld when he opened the sixth
[13:37] seal and roll there was a great
[13:39] earthquake
[13:40] and the sun became black as sackcloth of
[13:44] hair and the moon became his blood and
[13:47] the stars of heaven fell onto earth
[13:49] even as a fig tree cast her untimely
[13:53] figs when she's shaken
[13:54] of a mighty wind and the heavens
[13:57] departed as a scroll when it's rolled
[13:59] together
[14:00] never a mountain every island were moved
[14:02] out of
[14:03] their places and the kings of the earth
[14:06] and the great man and the rich man
[14:08] and the chief captains and the mighty
[14:10] man and everybody
[14:12] and every free man hid themselves
[14:15] in the dens and in the rocks of the
[14:17] mountains
[14:18] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[14:20] on us and hide us from the face of him
[14:23] that set up on the throne and from the
[14:27] wrath of the lamb
[14:28] for the great day of his wrath has come
[14:31] and who
[14:32] shall be able to stand
[14:35] if we find out now john said i'll be
[14:38] held when he
[14:38] opened the sixth seal that was a great
[14:41] earthquake
[14:43] then all nature was interrupted
[14:46] see but we find out here that
[14:49] nature tucker tumble
[14:52] yes all nature look what taking place
[14:55] the
[14:55] the earthquake the sun went black and
[14:59] the moon would give its light the stars
[15:01] shook
[15:02] and found while everything happened
[15:06] right at the time of the opening of this
[15:09] sixth seal
[15:10] that's why it takes place probably
[15:13] immediately
[15:14] after the announcing of those martyrs
[15:19] the martyrs have been finished now you
[15:21] see we're right close
[15:22] into that hour now we could be at any
[15:24] time
[15:28] because the church is just about ready
[15:31] to take its flight
[15:33] but remember when these things happen
[15:37] the bride won't be here
[15:40] just remember the bride's gone you don't
[15:43] have to go through any of it
[15:45] this is a time of tribulation
[15:48] purification
[15:49] of the uh of the church it's put up on
[15:52] her board go do it
[15:54] not the right it takes his sweetheart
[15:57] out of the way
[15:58] that's cersei done redeemed her
[16:02] see it's kind of a that's his own
[16:05] selection
[16:05] his own choice like any man who takes
[16:08] his bride
[16:09] now the earthquake compares scriptures
[16:13] of this
[16:13] great event that we will see
[16:17] that this great secret or
[16:21] mystery that was under the sixth seal
[16:25] of the book of redemption
[16:28] now remember these are hidden
[16:31] mysteries and the six seals all together
[16:35] is one great big book
[16:38] this six scrolls rolled together and
[16:41] unwinds the whole book of redemption
[16:44] that's how the whole earth was redeemed
[16:48] that's reason john wept because if no
[16:51] one could get that book
[16:52] all creation everything was gone she
[16:55] just simply
[16:56] turned back to the atoms and
[16:59] molecules and so forth and cosmic light
[17:02] and not even be creation person nothing
[17:04] else
[17:05] because adam lost the rights of that
[17:09] book
[17:10] he forfeited it when he listened to his
[17:12] wife
[17:13] and she listened to satan's reasons
[17:16] instead of the word of god
[17:19] it was far but then it couldn't go back
[17:21] into the dirty hands of satan who
[17:23] tempted her out of the way so therefore
[17:27] it went back to its original owner like
[17:31] for any see goes right back to its
[17:33] original owner and that was god
[17:35] the creator who made it and he holds it
[17:39] now here let's start out now
[17:43] and let's read uh saint matthew
[17:46] the 24th chapter i just like to give you
[17:49] something here i've just
[17:50] looked up defined now saint matthew from
[17:54] one to three well it's where we go to
[17:57] read first
[17:58] and jesus went out and departed from the
[18:01] temple
[18:02] and his disciples came to him for to
[18:04] show him the building of the temple
[18:07] and he said unto them see not all these
[18:10] things verily i say unto you there shall
[18:12] not be one
[18:13] be left here one stone upon another that
[18:16] shall not be
[18:17] drawn down these three verses
[18:20] it took place actually on tuesday
[18:23] afternoon
[18:24] april the 4th 80 30. and the first two
[18:27] verses
[18:28] took place on the afternoon of the
[18:32] of april the fourth at 80 30 and the
[18:35] third verse taken place
[18:37] on tuesday evening of the same day
[18:40] see now notice here is
[18:44] there is three questions are asked by
[18:46] the jews
[18:48] here's the science three questions you
[18:49] asked what what
[18:51] um uh first verse was
[18:54] when shall these things be when there
[18:57] won't be one stone that flipped upon
[18:58] another
[18:59] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[19:01] second question
[19:03] and of the end of the world see these
[19:06] three questions
[19:07] see just exactly comparing what jesus
[19:10] said in matthew 24
[19:12] and what the revelator here opened up in
[19:15] the sixth seal is just exactly and jesus
[19:18] was speaking
[19:19] of the tribulation theory
[19:22] this sixth seal is the tribulation
[19:25] period
[19:26] that's what takes place the bride
[19:29] has gone there's no
[19:32] living creature nothing there to say it
[19:34] it's just now god is not dealing with
[19:36] the church the more it's been gone he's
[19:38] dealing with israel
[19:40] this is the other side this is when
[19:42] israel
[19:43] received the message of the kingdom
[19:47] by the two prophets of revelation 11.
[19:50] remember israel is
[19:54] a nation god
[19:57] servant nation and when
[20:00] when when israel is brought in
[20:05] it'll be a national event
[20:08] and uh that's when they're supposed to
[20:11] be delivered
[20:12] now look lest we get to daniel 12 here
[20:14] just a minute
[20:16] and at that time michael shall stand up
[20:19] the great prince which stood for the
[20:21] children
[20:22] for for the children of thy
[20:25] people see that's
[20:29] jews and there shall be a trouble such
[20:31] never was since there was a nation
[20:34] even to that same time now compare that
[20:36] exactly what jesus said matthew 24.
[20:40] there shall be a time of trouble has
[20:41] never been since there was a nation
[20:43] look at this sixth seal see the same
[20:46] thing a time of trouble
[20:48] notice since there wasn't even to the
[20:51] same time
[20:52] and at that time five people now in this
[20:55] seven
[20:56] last part of the seventh year thou
[20:58] people shall be delivered
[21:00] every one that shall be found written
[21:04] in the book the predestinated you see
[21:08] that's written in the lamb's book of
[21:09] life shall be delivered
[21:11] at that time and many of those asleep in
[21:15] the dust the earth shall await
[21:18] and some everlasting life and some of
[21:20] the evolution shame and contentment
[21:22] now and then shall the wise shine
[21:25] as the brightness of the permits and and
[21:28] they're going to turn many to righteous
[21:29] shall
[21:30] shine the stars forever and ever and i
[21:33] will give power unto my two witnesses
[21:35] that they shall prophesy a thousand two
[21:37] hundred and three score days cold and
[21:39] sackle
[21:40] these are the two olive trees and the
[21:42] two candlesticks that stand before the
[21:44] god of the earth
[21:45] if any man hurt them father proceedeth
[21:47] out of their mouth
[21:48] divide their enemies and if any man
[21:50] shall hurt them
[21:51] he must in this manner be killed hey
[21:54] there it is
[21:55] they can speak what they want to and
[21:57] that happens
[21:58] [Music]
[21:59] hey amen brother god rides on the scene
[22:02] here
[22:04] they have powerless uh power to shut the
[22:08] heavens
[22:08] that it rain not in the days of their
[22:10] prophecy and have power over the waters
[22:13] to turn them to blood and to smite the
[22:14] earth with flags as off as they will
[22:19] what is it god can bring these things
[22:21] but the word
[22:23] they can do nature any way they want to
[22:26] here it is they are the one who brings
[22:28] on this sixth seal
[22:30] they uncover and open it up it's a power
[22:33] of god
[22:36] this interrupt nature
[22:39] see the sixth seal is completely an
[22:41] interruption of nature
[22:45] do you get it now there's your seal
[22:48] who does it it's the prophets the other
[22:51] side of the rapture and here he is
[22:54] with the commission from god despite the
[22:57] earth
[22:58] whatever he wants to do
[23:01] stop the heavens and he does what's the
[23:04] matter
[23:04] he's fixing to take the 144
[23:08] thousand out for redemption out of the
[23:10] foot of redemption and that's under the
[23:12] seal of redemption
[23:14] and the sixth seal that's it my dear
[23:16] friend
[23:17] that's that sixth seal it's so

[50:16] refreshing course
[50:20] okay sister go ahead
[50:24] into them then he said unto them o fools
[50:27] and soul of heart
[50:28] to believe all that the prophets have
[50:30] spoken all that who have spoken
[50:34] the prophets have spoken
[50:38] and beginning at moses and all the
[50:40] prophets he expounded
[50:42] unto them in all the scriptures the
[50:44] things concerning himself
[50:45] amen may god add his blessings to the
[50:47] reading of his word you may be seated
[50:52] because we have so many scriptures to
[50:53] read this morning
[50:56] we probably won't be won't won't be
[50:58] interpreting all the scriptures
[51:02] spanish just take the scripture and you
[51:03] can read it as they're reading it
[51:06] is
[51:19] to these two disciples
[51:22] and once again he is he is trying to get
[51:25] them to identify
[51:27] him
[51:31] not by their sight no perseverance but
[51:33] he wants them to identify him through
[51:36] the scriptures
[51:39] now once again everybody understand that
[51:42] he is the word jesus christ
[51:45] is the word therefore everything that he
[51:49] says and does
[51:54] foreign exactly what it says
[51:59] he was and is the identified christ of
[52:11] these are scriptures that you you should
[52:13] know young people
[52:14] and always always repeat them and get to
[52:17] know them
[52:22] surely the lord god will do nothing some
[52:24] things alguna's vessels
[52:27] young people some things there is
[52:29] encuental gunas
[52:30] i'm sorry maybe you're you're not awake
[52:33] this morning
[52:34] okay the lord your god will do
[52:39] some things
[52:42] we'll do what
[52:52] he will do nothing
[52:56] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[52:58] servants the prophet the who
[53:01] akin the popes los papas
[53:06] the cardinals who
[53:09] kin the prophets
[53:12] now we know that noah was a prophet amen
[53:17] but does anyone know the first time that
[53:20] the word
[53:21] prophet was used in the bible
[53:27] this is anyone can answer okay called
[53:48] i want to know a specific time that the
[53:50] word prophet
[53:53] that's why i said noah was a prophet
[53:58] and it was mentioned before this
[54:02] but the bible doesn't say prophet about
[54:05] noah brother branham says noah was a
[54:08] prophet
[54:11] where the very word prophet was used for
[54:13] the first time
[54:18] who said it and who were they who were
[54:20] they talking about
[54:22] lava
[54:32] a little bit before that antecitos queso
[54:36] was
[54:46] that's exactly right wow i think she
[54:48] deserves a clap this morning
[54:52] that's exactly right was when he had
[54:56] told king abimelech that
[54:57] that sarah was his sister
[55:01] and the king was going to marry her
[55:03] right
[55:05] so who's the one that called abraham a
[55:07] prophet
[55:12] in a dream and therefore genesis 2
[55:15] 7 who's got it mr
[55:24] i'm sorry genesis 20 verse 7 that's my
[55:27] fault
[55:31] now therefore restore the man his wife
[55:33] for he is a prophet and he shall pray
[55:36] for
[55:36] thee and thou shalt live and if thou
[55:39] restore her
[55:40] not now know thou
[55:43] that thou shalt surely die down
[55:46] and that or
[56:00] is the mouthpiece of god here on earth
[56:05] one more time the lord god will do
[56:08] nothing
[56:10] he will not speak outside of his mouth
[56:26] and in the old testament
[56:43] the first one is nabi and it means to
[56:46] bubble up it describes one who is
[56:50] stirred up in
[56:51] spirits
[56:54] when the sense of bubbling up is applied
[57:10] one who pours forth the declaration of
[57:12] god
[57:15] sounds a lot like the story that brother
[57:17] branham talks about
[57:20] of that spring that keeps bubbling is
[57:22] that right there is
[57:38] it describes one who is a revealer of
[57:41] secrets
[57:43] once again the lord god will do nothing
[57:48] but he revealeth his secret to his
[57:51] servants the prophets
[58:19] a prophet is a prophetess
[58:24] a foreteller one who speaks for another
[58:30] when you break down the word it is one
[58:33] who speaks for god
[59:03] because many times you have people that
[59:04] think that they're
[59:06] that god's going to change his way of
[59:08] doing things
[59:12] but god does not change the way he does
[59:14] it
[59:15] it is his plan it is his system
[59:19] and does god ever change his mind about
[59:21] his word
[59:24] now watch this now he doesn't reveal to
[59:27] no one
[59:28] else but his spokesperson
[59:58] everybody wants to be the pastor of
[1:00:00] spokespeople
[1:00:02] and and uh you know i i i
[1:00:05] that doesn't honor me okay i don't feel
[1:00:08] like wow
[1:00:12] you know you hear it all the time well
[1:00:15] the pastor told me
[1:00:17] well good it's for you just keep it at
[1:00:20] that it's not
[1:00:23] right man
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:33] well the pastor said
[1:00:36] okay really did he say it like that
[1:00:57] we always want to try to get the upper
[1:00:59] hand in a conversation with people
[1:01:01] well the pastor told me
[1:01:06] if i have anything to tell you i'll tell
[1:01:08] you myself
[1:01:33] did he send you to tell me that
[1:01:36] oh
[1:01:43] i mean i have people that hold grudges
[1:01:45] against me
[1:01:48] because somebody told them that i said
[1:01:50] something
[1:02:05] yo you appreciate let me get back to my
[1:02:07] message
[1:02:09] let's continue luke who's got 2427 lucas
[1:02:15] did i give that to anybody
[1:02:20] okay i'm sorry luke 16. who's got that
[1:02:24] lucas yes okay now now watch this now as
[1:02:27] he begins to read this
[1:02:30] how many know that the jews only listen
[1:02:31] to their prophets right
[1:02:45] it should be a good thing
[1:02:48] right people should listen to what the
[1:02:51] pastor has to tell them
[1:02:55] they should hear what the ministry what
[1:02:57] god gives the ministry to
[1:02:58] christians but look and look at this now
[1:03:02] and as long as somebody reads moses and
[1:03:05] the prophets they're okay with that
[1:03:09] but when the manifestation of what moses
[1:03:11] and the prophet said
[1:03:24] look at the story of the rich young
[1:03:26] ruler which we're about to read
[1:03:36] so much for well i'll just keep the
[1:03:38] commandments and be a good person
[1:03:43] he lifts up his eyes in hell and begins
[1:03:45] to have a conversation with
[1:03:47] father abraham
[1:03:51] go ahead brother verse 26 let's start
[1:03:54] with verse 27.
[1:03:57] then he said i pray thee therefore
[1:03:59] father that thou would have send me
[1:04:01] him to my father's house all right five
[1:04:03] people talking about sending lazarus
[1:04:05] right you send lazarus to his father's
[1:04:07] house go ahead right
[1:04:09] brethren that he may testify unto them
[1:04:11] thus they also come into this place of
[1:04:13] torment
[1:04:14] and what it what watch what what watch
[1:04:17] what abraham tells them
[1:04:21] abraham saith unto him they have moses
[1:04:23] and the prophets
[1:04:24] oh my that's the conversation that jesus
[1:04:28] is having with those on the road to him
[1:04:33] he started with moses and began to go
[1:04:36] expound all through the prophet
[1:04:53] and he had kept what moses and the
[1:04:54] prophet said
[1:04:57] he found himself
[1:05:02] so he knew that it wasn't just that he
[1:05:05] had kept moses and the prophet
[1:05:15] the one that moses and the prophets were
[1:05:17] speaking
[1:05:20] go ahead verse 30. and he said nay
[1:05:22] father abraham but if one went unto them
[1:05:25] from the dead
[1:05:25] they will repent and then he says
[1:05:29] and he said unto them if they hear not
[1:05:31] moses and the prophets
[1:05:32] neither will they be persuaded though
[1:05:34] one rose from the dead
[1:05:36] if they hear not moses and the prophets
[1:05:40] that's why it says having ears they
[1:05:42] don't hear then
[1:05:44] having eyes they don't see november if
[1:05:47] the rich young ruler would have believed
[1:05:49] really moses and the prophets
[1:05:53] he would have had to believe jesus
[1:05:57] it's no different today that we claim to
[1:06:00] believe the scriptures
[1:06:15] only scriptural people will understand
[1:06:20] what shall i do to inherit eternal life
[1:06:28] what's the torah anybody
[1:06:44] you're close it is part of the bible
[1:06:49] what is it
[1:06:52] it was a scroll in those times it's
[1:06:56] pretty
[1:06:56] pretty good though
[1:07:00] the young girls the torah
[1:07:04] very good the torah is the first five
[1:07:06] books of the bible
[1:07:08] all right now now watch this now this is
[1:07:11] he had read the torah
[1:07:14] because he knew the commandments and had
[1:07:15] lived by them
[1:07:19] i see some of you some of the adults
[1:07:22] i didn't know but i ain't gonna tell
[1:07:26] nobody i didn't know that yeah i knew
[1:07:28] that
[1:07:30] write it down it's okay it's a refresher
[1:07:32] course
[1:07:34] he had lived and abided
[1:07:37] by the commandments
[1:07:54] he knew that there was something special
[1:07:56] about it
[1:07:57] he knew that he was a master a teacher
[1:08:01] but when he looked at him it didn't
[1:08:04] actually
[1:08:05] click that he was the one moses was
[1:08:07] talking about
[1:08:20] because they all pointed not to a
[1:08:23] prophet
[1:08:26] they all pointed to the prophet
[1:08:30] how many know that go back and read the
[1:08:33] old testament
[1:08:36] and everybody
[1:08:50] then
[1:09:05] beginning to speak or prophesy
[1:09:09] it was probably the greatest prophecy
[1:09:12] ever uttered by moses
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:17] it was the greatest god-breathed
[1:09:20] utterance
[1:09:24] tremendous that moses
[1:09:27] had ever uttered
[1:09:30] if you stop for a moment this morning up
[1:09:33] and you think about what is the greatest
[1:09:35] thing you have ever
[1:09:36] uttered in your life
[1:09:40] what is the greatest thing you've ever
[1:09:41] uttered in your life think about it
[1:09:44] parents others what is the greatest
[1:09:46] thing that's ever come out of your of
[1:09:48] your mouth
[1:09:52] i'll give you a time
[1:09:58] think about it
[1:10:15] there's so many things that come to mind
[1:10:19] the greatest thing you can tell your
[1:10:21] brother and sister is god bless you
[1:10:24] there's a lot of tremendous things that
[1:10:25] can come out of our mouths
[1:10:28] there's a lot of maybe not so good
[1:10:29] things that have come out of our mouth
[1:10:32] but here is moses
[1:10:36] and he begins to to bubble up
[1:10:40] he's bubbling because something in him
[1:10:42] is happening
[1:10:45] he's about to speak on behalf of god
[1:10:51] and i can just imagine him
[1:10:54] as he begins to speak
[1:11:09] he begins to bubble over
[1:11:15] utterance he begins to utter something
[1:11:23] deuteronomy 18 15.
[1:11:27] the lord thy god will raise up unto thee
[1:11:30] a prophet hold him hold hold on hold on
[1:11:33] here he is okay this
[1:11:36] this is so this is so awesome
[1:11:53] oh from the midst of thee now
[1:11:58] of thy breath
[1:12:04] and this is the part that gets me like
[1:12:05] unto me oh
[1:12:15] that's why i say it's probably the
[1:12:16] greatest thing that he ever uttered
[1:12:34] i don't know i i i could just i could
[1:12:37] close my bible and say god bless you
[1:12:39] because
[1:12:40] it's a wonderful day with you and that's
[1:12:42] enough for me yes
[1:12:45] imagine that a man a man like you
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:02] who said
[1:13:16] now here comes a spokesperson
[1:13:21] on the scene now he turns it around and
[1:13:24] says
[1:13:26] under inspiration
[1:13:30] he's going to raise up a prophet
[1:13:34] like me he's going to be a
[1:13:37] a man like me
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:13:41] i don't know about you but that gets me
[1:13:43] excited this morning
[1:14:13] he was that prophet that was
[1:14:16] just like moses
[1:14:20] what is so important about that
[1:14:24] is that the scripture is compounded
[1:15:00] would reveal jesus christ again
[1:15:04] at the end of the gentile dispensation
[1:15:21] he's not just speaking this because it
[1:15:22] sounds
[1:15:36] and this is gonna and he sees him coming
[1:15:39] and this is gonna happen and this is
[1:15:41] gonna happen
[1:15:43] sounds a lot like my life
[1:15:48] later he spoke these mighty inspired
[1:15:50] words
[1:16:03] greater than riches
[1:16:18] aj
[1:16:32] maybe we're going a little bit too high
[1:16:34] huh because we got to go down a little
[1:16:35] bit more
[1:16:37] who wants to answer what's that
[1:16:42] it is christ jesus christ right this
[1:16:45] is the messiah
[1:16:55] okay got to make sure that we get it if
[1:16:58] if we have to stop we'll stop
[1:17:02] now watch this now we know then that
[1:17:05] messiah was to be a prophet
[1:17:12] he's to be the god prophet
[1:17:20] he wasn't just a prophet
[1:17:23] no solo prophet he wasn't just the
[1:17:25] prophet
[1:17:28] he was the god prophet
[1:17:32] jesus jesus
[1:17:41] he was to be
[1:17:44] the god super prophet
[1:17:51] that's in the message we would see jesus
[1:17:55] once again tell your neighbor
[1:18:06] now i'm going to ask you another
[1:18:07] question so
[1:18:09] what was the sign of the messiah
[1:18:16] okay you you adults can answer too this
[1:18:24] is
[1:18:28] the discernment that was part of it
[1:18:34] who knows what the messiah sign was to
[1:18:36] be insane
[1:19:18] we're going to go out acts chapter 3
[1:19:19] verse 20 through 24.

[1:20:52] said
[1:20:52] unto the fathers a prophet shall the
[1:20:55] lord your god raise up
[1:20:56] unto you of your brethren like unto me
[1:21:01] him shall ye hear in all things
[1:21:04] whatsoever he shall say unto you
[1:21:07] and it shall come to pass that every
[1:21:09] soul which will not hear that
[1:21:11] wait a minute here a moment
[1:21:18] this is why it's so important this is
[1:21:20] why we believe that
[1:21:22] that god sent a process this is why we
[1:21:25] believe it
[1:21:26] is
[1:21:53] ah brother caleb didn't say that this is
[1:21:55] the scripture
[1:21:57] but brother caleb is saying this now
[1:22:01] shall be destroyed from among the people
[1:22:06] verse 24 and all the prophets from
[1:22:10] samuel
[1:22:11] and spo and those that follow after
[1:22:14] as many as have spoken have likewise
[1:22:17] foretold the date they've all foretold
[1:22:20] of these
[1:22:20] days yes it is speaking of jesus christ
[1:22:26] but now in these last days my question
[1:22:29] is
[1:22:29] what form did he take
[1:22:32] in order to reveal himself again
[1:23:12] had he been a great pillar of fire that
[1:23:14] come down
[1:23:18] and showed them that so that that's what
[1:23:21] he was
[1:23:22] that he was a great pillar of fire
[1:23:26] they might have believed that
[1:23:32] say that again
[1:23:55] when out of the light steps forth a man
[1:23:59] it blinds them loci
[1:24:13] he could not do one thing in his life
[1:24:17] contrary to the scriptures
[1:24:20] so moses had already spoken
[1:24:23] the lord your god will raise up a
[1:24:25] prophet like
[1:24:26] unto me so he knew
[1:24:40] he couldn't go against the scriptures
[1:25:02] okay brother abraham you got we're going
[1:25:04] to give you ezekiel chapter three
[1:25:06] ezekiel capitol
[1:25:15] once again son of man yo the only time
[1:25:18] you read it
[1:25:20] deals with a prophet
[1:25:24] but there is only one viscera
[1:25:28] these others are sons of men
[1:25:32] but can somebody tell me your young
[1:25:34] people who is the son of man
[1:25:39] anybody jesus christ that's right
[1:25:43] he is the son of man but all the
[1:25:46] prophets that he sent
[1:25:48] us were sons of man
[1:25:53] you got it my brother okay we're just
[1:25:55] going to read the first part of these
[1:25:56] verses okay
[1:25:59] in ezekiel 3 we find it one
[1:26:02] two three four five times
[1:26:10] he said unto me son of man stop right
[1:26:13] there
[1:26:14] okay moreover he said unto me
[1:26:20] so ezekiel was ezekiel a son of man
[1:26:24] yes he was a prophet

[1:26:31] verse 4
[1:26:33] and he said unto me son of man verse 10

[1:26:52] hear the world at my mouth and give them
[1:26:56] warnings notice how god views

[1:56:25] and he came to nazareth where he had had
[1:56:28] been brought up and
[1:56:29] as his custom was he went to the
[1:56:32] synagogue on the sabbath day
[1:56:34] and stood up too wow
[1:56:37] here's jesus you never sat down when he
[1:56:40] read the problem
[1:56:45] oh my i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna go
[1:56:47] into the mercy seat a little bit and
[1:56:49] then we'll stop
[1:56:52] and i'm gonna i'm gonna keep on reading
[1:56:54] this but but this is so tremendous
[1:56:57] he goes on the sabbath day and he's
[1:57:00] standing up to read the prophets
[1:57:03] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:57:05] book of the prophet isaiah
[1:57:08] yes and when he had opened the book he
[1:57:11] found the place where it was written
[1:57:16] was looking through it and he found
[1:57:18] where it was written
[1:57:20] and then he began to say the spirit
[1:57:35] deliverance to the capitol
[1:58:30] and all the eyes of them that were in
[1:58:32] the synagogue were
[1:58:34] fastened at him
[1:58:39] something was going on here he was doing
[1:58:42] things a little different
[1:58:44] watch this now the eyes were all
[1:58:46] fastened
[1:59:12] to believe all that the prophets have
[1:59:14] spoken
[1:59:27] jesus was to fulfill that later jesus
[1:59:31] in a different form
[1:59:35] and all bear witness
[1:59:39] that one went and wondered now watch now
[1:59:42] gotta get
[1:59:51] i'm sorry brother david i know this is
[1:59:53] worth a lot of money i'll
[1:59:55] take care of it
[2:00:02] they sit down judging everyone
[2:00:08] they sit there listen they tell
[2:00:10] everybody
[2:00:21] [Music]
[2:00:24] th this is important churches it's very
[2:00:27] important to understand
[2:00:29] because he as he began to say this day
[2:00:32] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[2:00:36] and they wondered at the gracious words
[2:00:39] that proceeded out of his name
[2:00:46] how can such words come forward
[2:00:50] all gracious words
[2:01:46] once again who is the lamb of god
[2:01:56] jesus christ good job please everybody
[2:01:58] know that right
[2:02:00] jesus christ the lamb of god and as
[2:02:16] why
[2:02:30] now watch this now this
[2:02:33] is contrary to what the scribes and
[2:02:35] pharisees
[2:02:39] they were sitting on moses
[2:02:42] did not pertain to them
[2:02:56] for sitting on a seat that does not
[2:02:58] pertain
[2:03:08] i got to tell you this again that moses
[2:03:10] would return
[2:03:24] do not think that i will accuse you to
[2:03:26] the father
[2:03:29] there's one that accuses you in whom
[2:03:33] you trust huh we have moses and the
[2:03:37] prophets
[2:03:39] and the one that you trust
[2:03:58] there was the mighty god standing in
[2:04:00] full view
[2:04:04] mercy he died
[2:04:08] when his own
[2:04:35] as long as the sprinkled atonement was
[2:04:37] there
[2:04:40] but when the blood was removed
[2:04:45] amen amen as long as the blood is on the
[2:04:47] mercy
[2:04:50] showed that something
[2:05:00] come on now this this comes comes to us
[2:05:02] now
[2:05:03] when the church is raptured
[2:05:18] and he shall take the blood of the
[2:05:19] bullock
[2:05:22] i'm sorry leviticus leviticus 16 14
[2:05:25] yesterday and he shall take the blood of
[2:05:28] the bullock
[2:05:29] and sprinkle it with his finger upon the
[2:05:31] mercy seat
[2:05:44] in the cloud of glory where does the sun
[2:05:47] rise the s-um
[2:05:52] where will the s-o-n rise
[2:05:55] in the east in the list where was the
[2:05:57] mercy seat city
[2:06:00] force the east
[2:06:27] is sufficient
[2:06:57] have mercy the blood had to lay on the
[2:07:01] altar
[2:07:06] and that's where you kneel and ask god
[2:07:08] for mercy
[2:07:38] and today
[2:08:34] and
[2:08:47] because they see the lamb getting off
[2:08:48] the mercies

[2:09:44] william branham
[2:09:47] it wasn't just a prophet but when
[2:09:50] christ came and dwelt in that
[2:09:54] prophet it was more than
