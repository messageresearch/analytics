[43:00] driver and how do we start a new
[43:02] Pentecost if it will commence a Muslim
[43:04] Pentecost is no by coming back to the
[43:06] original scripture he got the multitude

[43:46] and those ascent and demos as we said
[43:48] last time this picture is use
[43:51] many times Esther's Couture Azusa when
[43:54] we disagree with someone when the
[43:56] state's done this acuerdo and we don't
[43:58] want to make an effort to walk with them
[44:00] in okay must settle it first of all they
[44:01] come and we simply say we cannot walk
[44:03] together because we disagree
[44:05] Cemal no point was coming that con usted
[44:07] porque estamos then it's easier just to
[44:09] say it and do it that way it's faster
[44:11] they see the lawyer said listen yes I do
[44:13] realize that no we cannot all and
[44:16] everyone around the world walk together
[44:18] Tendo canto santol mundo plane and there
[44:21] who does not everyone believes the same
[44:23] thing porque no tow screen la misma cosa
[44:25] but we do know it'll sister them that
[44:28] someone has taken the time alguien
[44:31] septum others to help raise our faith to
[44:35] another level but up we're live at mr.
[44:37] Farrell Toni this so that we can begin
[44:39] to walk one with the other but I am
[44:41] pathetic I mean I tell uno con el I
[44:43] thank the Lord for our founding pastor
[44:45] Lego Sinestro pastor so much time into
[44:48] helping us come tonight bringing our
[44:52] faith to another level I know what mr.
[44:54] felony they the same faith that was
[44:57] delivered to the Saints I miss my
[44:58] philosophy is the same faith that is
[45:01] continued is its continuing to be
[45:04] delivered to the Saints is the mismo que
[45:06] continúa en toda Dallas it has not
[45:08] stopped no Appa Rado and I believe that
[45:10] our children then their faith must be
[45:12] raised the same way our faith has been
[45:14] raised he can associate a means to
[45:16] fairly necessarily vada we many times
[45:18] think we because we come to church that
[45:20] we are Christians which erases grandmas
[45:22] Kippur kill any mustard we send my
[45:24] question is do you walk with Jesus he
[45:26] preguntas come in here walk with Jesus
[45:29] what does come in and conquer Seuss I
[45:31] must learn to walk with him I must learn
[45:34] to did I come in there because you
[45:37] cannot walk together with Jesus but you
[45:39] still awake I mean that okay so until
[45:41] first of all there has been an agreement
[45:43] between you and Jesus I stuck a pre
[45:45] matter I got you though not we're done
[45:47] anybody here made an agreement with him
[45:49] are they shown a quitter the constant
[45:50] can be agreement yet not quite as simple
[45:53] as simple it is an engagement assume
[45:55] compromise though a man if you have not
[45:58] made an agreement or been engaged to him
[46:01] denied
[46:01] come from Miss Torrell you'll never ever
[46:03] walk with him the way you're supposed to
[46:06] look Erica Mena Konerko most 0.07 he may
[46:08] be your savior and that's many people he
[46:11] is their Savior muchos notice he does
[46:15] not become your Lord then he can't you
[46:17] cannot walk with him except to senior
[46:19] know us because how can two walk
[46:22] together unless they be agreed first of
[46:25] all oh come on and those who knows you
[46:27] knows Tonya when I have to learn to walk
[46:29] with Christ who is the word they were
[46:32] the upendra caminar con Cristo and there
[46:34] I must learn how to walk with my
[46:37] brothers and my sisters
[46:39] slow up indirect caminar con mis
[46:40] hermanos this is where many people even
[46:43] in the message they miss it I can tell
[46:46] one element circulate I'm not throwing
[46:47] at anyone you're looking at anyone I
[46:49] look in the mirror yeah nothing invalid
[46:51] if you learn the particulars is because
[46:52] there's always there has always been
[46:54] this stigma thirteen possessed a stigma
[46:57] and it sticks with people yes they can i
[46:59] connect it and though they may say they
[47:01] I don't believe that you know can you
[47:02] and you're not Creole but there are
[47:03] things that stay with us even from the
[47:06] denominational realm there are courses
[47:08] case I can and you know sort of on the
[47:10] low denomination and things that have
[47:11] been taught through the years versus
[47:13] case an insane yellow Trello such as the
[47:15] rapture is simply one of these days
[47:17] we'll be driving in our car and wound
[47:19] work will be out of here but a hip
[47:21] looking were trapped on the almost human
[47:22] hand we know so I must say well though
[47:24] we may say we may say well I don't
[47:26] believe it like that no more young Kenny
[47:28] got most general career because God sent
[47:30] a prophet and in this message he has
[47:32] taught us what the rapture really is
[47:34] because you're some moments ahead on
[47:35] profit diagnosis then you'll come well
[47:37] but yet in our own actions fairness the
[47:40] sexy honest we live like the
[47:43] Pentecostals believe it came was como la
[47:45] créme los Pentecostal is because we try
[47:47] to or or many times we want to get to
[47:50] ourselves only porque tenemos que
[47:52] nosotros not loss
[47:53] we really don't believe that a rapture
[47:55] is a whole body of believers it's some
[48:00] way we still think it is I'm gonna fly
[48:03] off one of these days it was a twelve
[48:04] men take Karami sidewall and Ono's
[48:06] that's not the way the Bible teaches it
[48:08] there are no estelle merkulov is not the
[48:10] way our prophet taught it let's draw a
[48:11] prophet and Allah say no then why do we
[48:13] in
[48:14] this many times on bean by ourselves and
[48:16] never join in our hearts and souls as
[48:19] one para por que nos vemos per sec I'm
[48:21] gonna swing and lower the entire nose
[48:23] believe me about a Sonia I try to study
[48:26] another subject can't make it at this

[50:22] the ladies see myristate oil as de mas
[50:24] and husbands you know this is true in
[50:26] they perceive so many things so
[50:29] different than the men perceive intent
