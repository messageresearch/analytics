grace this morning so before we before we start we would like to bow our heads a moment for a word of prayer there are some special requests that have come in this morning specialist one of them is brother tommy junior called this morning that uh sister debbie gallardo hermana debbie gallardo she is there in phoenix and she's very sick in phoenix istanbul in ferma and we want to remember her bring her before the lord this morning also sister mona uh bernal she's not feeling well this morning brother henry is gracious enough to be here it is post of duty and we we should thank the lord for that today amen and uh and uh lastly we have a request from sister cynthia she she has an ear infection so with that let's just uh if you have a need this morning just just close your eyes and just raise your hands our heavenly father is celestial [Music] full on calvary and in the name of the lord jesus christ by the blood sacrifice that was made for us for our sins we are already healed in the name of the lord jesus christ what she can't claim this morning because of what she might be going through in our hearts and faith today suppose make sure that the people that cannot speak english can can understand this morning we don't ask you because of that but lord we bring her before you this morning father that ear infection that she has in the name of the lord jesus christ we believe your word this morning and know that the healing power is already released and it is already done yes it's just [Music] jesus christ amen amen amen you can be seated if you like who is the tartan uh we are there's already a beautiful presence of the lord here we pray that you can you can experience that there where you're at experiment but there are a few things we want to mention before we get into the word first of all we want to to wish uh brother caleb and sister lorena caleb lorena a very happy anniversary feliz anniversary i believe it was yesterday yesterday was their anniversary also my wife reminded me this morning it was also brother tommy and sister biola's anniversary yesterday whether tommy is our father in the gospel we love him with all of our hearts we're thankful for for their anniversary today or yesterday and lastly it was also sister ruth hill's birthday yesterday no not sister ruthie hill that sister ruth nolan ruth la that is also my wife's grandmother is there will be no service this afternoon but at 4 o'clock that we all join together in our homes cuatro and uh have a prayer meeting there with in your home we'll all be doing that at the same time so that would be something great for us please uh be prepare yourselves and and be prepared to do that at four o'clock and also uh this week at nine o'clock p.m uh that we have a prayer meeting in our homes at 9 00 pm but and we know that they'll be great things that will result from those things because we can do a lot of things but we can't pray too much so with that connesto um let's move on into the words and we sure have quite a a thing today telling brother henry the minute you start reading god's word it's like you just go to the store for for a uh or a loaf of bread yes but you go ahead and uh get your loaf of bread and butter pan and you then you get to get uh a meat lego carne and then you get avocado and then you get uh all the things and before you know it you got your basket full his blessings are abundant more than we can contain our scripture that we'll read to start with if you'll stand for the to honor the reading of god's word it is hebrews and god's word reads like this wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which that so easily beset us who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for considering him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest we be wearied and faint in your minds just bring a little glass of water to somebody that might be thirsty you know time and days and days go by there's always somebody that brings me a little glass of water there's always somebody there to bring that to us and today with the lord jesus we would like to do that for you today so many of us are suffering i wouldn't even begin to know what to say but the only thing that i can say this morning is that god's word is true it is sufficient this morning for whatever we're going through in life i'm not interested this morning in religion and i've grown tired of man's words but i am interested this morning i'm convinced i'm concerned if you need power it's in his word if you need the holy ghost it's in his word if you need assurance it's in his word and when we receive god's word we get all of these things and so what more can we want today the last several months have brought the world to its knees under the weight of affliction there have been big changes in a short period of time and yet no change at the same time the research of infections has seemed to move the world backwards but in all those things you gotta find a little humor here and there i can go through i'll go to you more yeah i'd like to share with you something that's a little bit funny help us relax protest political unrest political people anxious for the 2020 presidential elections in hopes that they'll get something better esperanto [Music] and all those people that didn't think homeschool was a good idea we've been spending the last several months in delay after delay all the world's powers are on delay and i'm not saying this to be funny you know but so those things aren't funny but this is the funny part the other day somebody people are totally stressed out right and i'll tell you what if you don't if you're not standing on the rock of ages you are going to be totally stressed out somebody that was real stressed out came up to me he told me i laughed the only thing that's predictable about our monsoon seasons in new mexico those of you that don't know what monsoons are because maybe you're not from here from the southwest of the united states monsoon season we're not like the rest of the world we don't get a lot of rain all the time we live once a year from the south from the gulf it comes in [Music] a the storm fronts and they carry with them what we call monsoonal rains [Music] and most of our rain comes at this time but if you try to predict that and don't ever make a bet on what monsoon is going to bring but in all this it has become clear es claro that we can't depend on ourselves but god has all matters under his control including your delayed amazon orders including amazon amen this message this morning is very simple estimate but it's something that's helped me we have been fighting for a long time all those things are the full armor we can't afford to take them off and i know we get tired but i've been inspired by the thought of endurance endurance and the life of a christian is essential we'll get into into that about why in a little bit vamos ave del porque but if you don't get anything else jesus said this jesus in matthew chapter 24 verses 12 and 13. and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax called mucho but he that shall endure unto the end perseverance the same shall be saved amen amen can you say amen to the lord jesus christ endurance is not something you ever associate good times you never hear somebody saying man i had to have a lot of endurance to drive my new car all day long oh my goodness the air conditioner on that thing is so cold i had to wear a sweater you never hear anybody say man it was a a real test of endurance to to finish that ribeye steak wanted you never hear anybody say it took a lot of endurance to to have a a binge night on on netflix to watch movies all night man i had to endure a lot for that never heard anybody say that two-week vacation took some endurance with all those hotels and the eating out and entertainment i just wanted it all to end endurance isn't something you think of in in terms of good el aguantes but there's a mystery in it but are you my stereotype because even though you don't think of it in terms of good but endurance is good endurance is a test of limits it's a struggle to finish something the endurance efforts they exhaust the body a complete endurance is usually tied to anything opposite of good part you don't endure you don't endure that is what god requires it takes away the weariness and faintness of our minds that's what we just read in hebrews because when we consider what our lord did to endure sin but it takes away the weariness and faintness of our mind endurance god there are 12 that describe god's endurance there's 12 of them that means for every day of the we're not going to get to all 12 of them today but we'll get as far as we can at least we're going to read them all these are so refreshing we pray that this refreshes you this morning there these are the examples of what we should do or do to endure his righteous judgment to take away our weariness and our faintness in our minds are you ready for the first one established let's turn to the to the book of psalms nine verse seven capital and this is the lord shall endure but the lord shall endure forever he had prepared his throne for judgment forever now as we just said this isn't always talking this isn't talking about something that's so good this isn't talking about god's eternal state and perfection this is talking about a struggle it's talking how would you like to fight right alongside the lord of hosts this morning question is how long will the lord endure because he cried it is but i do have a question for you then why does the lord endure as the bible says why does he struggle why does he still suffer because god's long suffering is salvation his will is that none would be lost because although he saved you [Applause] our how long will the lord endure in my life and in your life till it is finished oh my what an assurance we have this morning to know that i can't be lost because my god my lord he is still enduring for me still enduring for you this morning i need to endure example that he has given us we need to fight the good fight and we carry and now you fight the good fight right alongside the lord of hosts and you endure amen can you wave your hands and say thank you jesus and it says like this or his anger endureth forever did we read that right no no we did not read that we didn't read that right rewind for his anger endureth but a moment in his favor is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning oh my i want to live in his favor this morning or in his favor there is life i don't merit his favor but i thank him that his love projects to me pero his anger isn't like our anger is but forgot is one day with goddess is a thousand years have you ever picked up the phone and you call you said yama you want to get technical support technically you say uh please be on hold for a moment especially because we're experiencing high call volumes well sometimes god is very busy and we might get him in a blink of an eye and we might have to wait for 25 years but his anger only lasts a moment what a lesson we learned from that we get angry and the bible says to anger but to sin not but all too often our anger endures forever we just don't let things go you know we so why should ours endure forever if you think you've been in the holy of holies we got to stop playing the blame game let your anger have an expiration date believe me brothers and sisters i'm taking so that we can put on the mind of christ let's go to the next one the next one is the goodness of god like i said a lot of this goodness doesn't sound so good psalms 52 verse 1 there's a note in my bible i don't know if it's there in yours but this is uh this is david this is david you're the chief musician this is the psalm of david when doug the edomite came to and told saul when and he also gave david goliath sword he didn't have any any room to bring weapons so when he went to the priest the priest gave him goliath's sword out of the rage when dog told saul of this saul ordered the soldiers to kill the priesthood to destroy them but this is what a soldier does a soldier when son when the trumpet gives an uncertain sound the bible says my sheep know my voice stranger's voice they will not that's a spirit that we see working in the world today it's a spirit of rage i've ever seen rage in my life oh we might say well we're gonna do this and we're gonna do that all these things we can do that's not a war strategy i'll tell you this if you're planning to do things in your own mind do we think we're going to win based on the good things that we do that is a recipe for defeat but if you want our strategy for victory this morning the goodness of god endureth continually as these chargers they gain their strength god's who's gonna fear guinness those two hundred thousand thousand demon chargers he'll they'll fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun glory when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him we lift up that standard today that's what doug wanted he wanted to do something that he wouldn't sell all that he had and would wouldn't give what he still holds both of them in his hand but it's his goodness that matters important doesn't matter how good we are his goodness that matters this morning we're complaining against his goodness when we do encounters and then everything give the king of kings all the praises my goodness the clock is going faster than i am that's okay i'm not going to keep you over an hour today but we want to get to another one i got to see what things we're going to get to okay psalms 20 psalms 72 17 en salmo his name shall endure forever his name shall be continuing as long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall call him blessed be scripturally his name is the lord jesus christ and this morning he is the same yesterday and today and forever yesterday we are healed in the name of the lord jesus christ we are saved it's almost we go from victory to victory in the name of the lord jesus christ his name shall be continued we are blessed with his name the bride doesn't do anything and her name is because she is in him and anything that we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ my name in the name of the lord jesus christ if that pertains to you this morning raise your hand and in the name of the lord christ it is already done just accept it and receive it in his name this is the gospel it is god's word it's power it has the holy ghost and what a oh my goodness praise the lord i've got about eight or ten more minutes but all the scriptures have a compound meaning real son the jews told him it took it took solomon 46 years old to build this temple and you're going to build it in three days and and the real son of david for god to tear himself from the very body that he created that had no sin and to let that's the eternal was exhausted he had physically and mentally reached his limit physically god's will begin to try to tear away god's language tried to tear away god's endurance god's will would be that none would be lost when he saw the scene in the vision he wept because no fan no man was found worthy at that moment jesus cried as a man jesus father and at that moment in this moment satan by all rights as a near kinsman had his hands ready to hermano mayor the lamb of god el corderon he stepped forth el salvador and he took the book and he said nevertheless nevertheless father father i don't rely on my own will no repository i'm not relying on my own will lord no repository that's what satan could never have that the real son of david has today he died more at gethsemane than when he then what he died on golgotha because there in gethsemane he died to his own will what a lesson there's so much more to say but maybe you feel torn today that's okay we get torn down and it'll be lost but like the real son of david if we rely on god's will even if our temple gets torn down even if our temple gets torn down we have the power within us to our lord jesus christ raise it back up again the same spirit that raised up jesus the same spirit spirit that raised up christ from the dead will also quicken your mortal body i can already feel the weariness leaving my mind take these scriptures and apply them let me let me read them to you because i'm be because i'm done but i i this would be good for you to go and go back and read on your own i'm going to read all the scriptures to you so that you you have them actually yeah i'm going to read all these to you once again the lord endureth el senor to glory his mercy endures his righteousness his praise endureth his righteous judgment his dominion now let me let me read you the scriptures that we didn't get too if this wasn't important i wouldn't do this concerning his truth you want to read this on your own write it down it's psalms 100. verses 4 and 5. you want to read about his glory gloria psalms 104 salmo siento cuatro verse 31 if you want to read about his mercy i wish i could get to his mercy can i just say this give thanks to and all the all the the ark and the mercy seat and all the musicians he told us and everything the people were assembled together the ark was handled the right way the shoulders of the priest the people were in a spirit of worship and as that was happening the music was playing in one accord they just said because it occurs 43 times it's important for us to know it's important thanks to the lord for he is good for his mercy forever as the people begin to give that together power heads lord jesus jesus we're so thankful this morning we're thankful lord god you have given that your word doesn't give us the answer your people take these twelve things lord this is your word that it may remove the faintness and
