[47:22] if you can be so kind let us all stand
[48:24] Supernatural inspiration
[48:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Our
[48:48] Lord amen
[48:51] we are going to turn in our scriptures
[48:56] First Corinthians that's the first first
[48:59] book of Corinthians of the Apostle Paul
[49:04] and we are going to read verse two
[49:16] Corinthians 2 15 and 16.
[49:21] it says this way
[49:32] but he that is spiritual judges all
[49:36] things yet he himself is judged of no
[49:39] man okay
[49:43] foreign
[49:51] that he may instruct him but we have the
[49:55] mind of Christ
[49:56] you may be seated
[50:01] we are going to try to consider tonight
[50:11] we want to entitle it as the scripture
[50:14] tells us
[50:16] it is according our scripture is the
[50:19] mind of Christ
[50:21] the mind of the Lord or of course
[50:25] we understand today
[50:29] the brother Brandon when he speaks about
[50:31] the human part
[50:35] he tells us he shows us that the mind is
[50:37] in the spirit
[50:40] the intelligence is also in the spirit
[50:46] and he says that the mind is the womb of
[50:49] the spirit
[50:53] womb is where the thoughts are begotten
[50:59] comes to our mind
[51:04] the prophet of God says that we cannot
[51:06] we cannot uh disturb okay
[51:11] that the birds will come to the tree
[51:17] but we can disturb or or they that they
[51:20] won't make a mess
[51:25] that there are thoughts that come from
[51:27] God and thoughts that come from the
[51:29] devils
[51:32] and we also have to be not only in the
[51:35] capacity
[51:36] but also in the decision
[51:43] which thought we will let govern our
[51:46] minds
[51:49] that is in our mind when those thoughts
[51:52] are begotten
[51:54] when they are begotten
[51:57] we start to speak them
[52:00] when we speak them they are words
[53:05] the twain thoughts of God are the devil
[53:07] they come to us and
[53:12] and second
[53:15] two yes
[53:18] and verse verse 5. they say
[53:24] s
[53:29] casting down in imaginations and every
[53:31] High thing that exalted itself against
[53:33] the knowledge of God is
[53:38] and bring it into captivity every
[53:41] thought to The Obedience of Christ
[53:45] the scripture there is
[53:51] tells us that we should take into
[53:53] captivity
[53:56] and bring them to the mind of Christ
[54:02] it means that we should be in that
[54:04] capacity
[54:08] to bring the every thought that is
[54:11] against the word of God
[54:15] to bring every argument there arises
[54:18] against the word of God
[54:21] and bring it to to The Obedience and
[54:24] captivity to Christ
[54:26] it means that the people
[54:30] we should be in the capacity
[54:35] wrap everything
[54:38] not to argue
[54:42] the prophet of God says you don't
[54:44] resolve anything by arguing
[54:49] there are a battle of quotes and
[54:53] scriptures here and there you know
[54:55] and we have not called
[54:59] to argue with no one
[55:04] throw a quote here or there
[55:07] no but to maintain ourselves
[55:15] with the sufficient understanding of
[55:20] what of the Lord
[55:23] not just of the text
[55:26] not just the knowledge of the of the
[55:29] message or of the scriptures
[55:32] Apostle Paul spoke to the to the
[55:35] Ephesians
[55:38] that we should come to the knowledge of
[55:40] the Son of God
[55:44] revelation of the Son of God of who he
[55:47] is to you
[55:51] the capacity of the bride of Christ
[55:56] to be able to discern the thought that
[55:58] comes from God
[56:01] the thought that is against God of what
[56:05] God is
[56:08] to be able to capture or to Captivate
[56:11] every contrary
[56:14] objected to the word of God
[56:18] now in order for us
[56:22] to have the thoughts of Christ
[56:26] we have to have the mind of Christ
[56:31] and how can we have the mind of Christ
[56:36] the Bible tells us in Philippians
[56:42] that we should have the same mind that
[56:45] was in Christ
[56:48] the same mind that was in him
[56:53] has to come and humble ourselves
[56:56] and to become servants
[57:01] not for us to do away and for us
[57:10] but to be able to have the capacity to
[57:13] take the form of a servant to fulfill
[57:16] the Divine Purpose
[57:21] maybe today and
[57:30] to be able to surrender ourselves to a
[57:33] physical death
[57:37] maybe we feel like that is the only way
[57:40] they said
[57:42] to be able to serve the purpose of the
[57:45] Gospel no neces
[57:49] but it's not necessarily talking about
[57:51] going and surrendering your physical
[57:53] life
[57:59] so that Christ will be born in me
[58:04] I am crucified with Christ
[58:09] and he would say who shall deliver me
[58:12] from this
[58:16] he said what I want to do that's what I
[58:18] don't do what I don't want to do that's
[58:20] what I do
[58:22] Paul then was dying every day
[58:27] what was he dying to as he means to
[58:30] himself
[58:32] and when he died to himself
[58:36] for him to die to himself
[58:40] first of all he had to die to his own
[58:43] mind
[58:47] because until we become right to our own
[58:50] things
[58:53] until we capture them and subject them
[59:00] we can then never receive the thought of
[59:03] God
[59:05] a woman that is pregnant
[59:10] she cannot receive a seed there is
[59:16] and to have a double pregnancy when
[59:19] she's already pregnant
[59:22] that's why Paul said he would become it
[59:25] would become
[59:27] that old seed has to die
[59:31] so that a new or a clean seats
[59:35] every word is a seed
[59:39] originated in the mind of a person
[59:44] and for the mind of Christ for it to
[59:47] come to us
[59:50] it cannot be begotten though the the
[59:53] word of God cannot be begotten in me
[59:58] until I die to my own thoughts
[1:00:04] now the way that we should die daily yes
[1:00:09] it's to die to our own ideas
[1:00:13] through our own arguments
[1:00:17] because the scripture says
[1:00:20] it has to be brought
[1:00:51] with a mind that's always bombarded with
[1:00:54] all kinds of different things
[1:00:57] the greatest battle ever fought and has
[1:01:00] always been foreign
[1:01:13] [Music]
[1:01:19] we should then go have to go back to how
[1:01:22] the mind of the man operated before
[1:01:26] and when we find Adam in the garden
[1:01:33] something was interrupted When sin came
[1:01:36] into the garden
[1:01:37] and what was interrupted
[1:01:42] many things could have come to pass
[1:01:47] but there was something that had to come
[1:01:49] first
[1:01:51] for the other things
[1:01:56] come to manifestation before sin is
[1:02:03] the manifestation
[1:02:06] and now manifestation is the expression
[1:02:09] Revelation is the Revelation it's to
[1:02:13] make known
[1:02:14] manifestation
[1:02:17] a manifestation of the of the thoughts
[1:02:20] of God
[1:02:22] the prophet of God teaches us
[1:02:26] that the first son that was going to
[1:02:29] come in the garden
[1:02:30] was Jesus
[1:02:35] and he was going to come through The
[1:02:37] Incorruptible seed
[1:02:40] he would come through the word of God
[1:02:44] what interrupted them
[1:02:49] what's the manifestation of the sons of
[1:02:52] God
[1:02:55] the sons of God that were to be made
[1:02:59] where only them
[1:03:03] that were in the mind of God they
[1:03:26] he was going to express that seed over
[1:03:30] the Earth
[1:03:32] that's the first thing that had to come
[1:03:34] yes
[1:03:39] and that was the first thing that was
[1:03:41] hindered because of sin in the garden
[1:03:47] when God then was going to take over
[1:03:50] again what was hindered
[1:03:53] he takes it again where he left us
[1:03:58] if you are then writing the numbers from
[1:04:01] one to ten
[1:04:03] and you go to the number three
[1:04:30] the plan was interrupted in the precise
[1:04:34] moment
[1:04:37] when the sons of God because I'm part of
[1:04:40] that
[1:04:44] because you are also part of that when
[1:04:47] the sons of God
[1:04:50] where we would be made Manifesto
[1:04:55] and and sin disturb them
[1:04:59] but the plan of God did not change
[1:05:04] and when God foreign
[1:06:21] Son of God
[1:06:25] Oda okay
[1:06:29] what does God await for us to do today
[1:06:37] what does God await for us to speak
[1:06:44] what God awaits of us wants from us is
[1:06:49] for us
[1:07:00] concerning you
[1:07:05] it's real easy for you and I today
[1:07:11] to to identify the manifestation of the
[1:07:14] Son of God
[1:07:15] of the only begotten son foreign
[1:07:33] that is fine but I for them
[1:07:48] when Adam was going to call for Jesus
[1:07:52] the plan was was held up
[1:07:56] but in the time of God in this plan
[1:08:03] he's gonna retake those those thoughts
[1:08:07] that maintain themselves in his mind
[1:08:11] that they stayed in an abstract
[1:08:16] then he retakes them and he speaks them
[1:08:19] for manifestation
[1:08:22] and Jesus appears upon the face
[1:08:27] Jesus had the mind of God
[1:08:32] the thought that God had
[1:08:36] which was before the foundation of the
[1:08:39] world
[1:08:40] for him
[1:08:46] it's to say that Jesus knew what he was
[1:08:49] supposed to do
[1:08:51] when brother Branham comes today
[1:08:55] he's manifested as a Son of God
[1:09:01] and he identifies what God thought look
[1:09:04] at the other ones to maintain what God
[1:09:07] had in his mind
[1:09:09] before the foundation
[1:09:12] concerning himself
[1:09:33] and I was not manifested then because
[1:09:36] sin interrupted
[1:09:39] but in the God's plan
[1:09:44] he retakes in the order that God had
[1:09:50] those thoughts to be made manifest on
[1:09:53] the earth
[1:09:54] come to my day
[1:09:57] then the Lord he encounters himself to
[1:10:01] me
[1:10:02] I remember or recognize
[1:10:05] the mind of God
[1:10:09] the thoughts that God has
[1:10:13] before the foundation
[1:10:16] concerning me
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:11:17] is to be made
[1:11:32] that God will take care of each and
[1:11:34] every details
[1:11:37] then I need to understand
[1:11:44] that every word that man speaks he will
[1:11:48] take be accountable be it good or evil
[1:11:50] okay
[1:11:57] you know when brother Brown would speak
[1:11:59] to his wife concerning of the three
[1:12:01] great greatest men that that were born
[1:12:03] in Kentucky
[1:12:06] and his wife would say Billy you're
[1:12:09] gonna start
[1:12:10] and it was a very innocent uh joke
[1:12:16] every one of us we play jokes on our
[1:12:19] children
[1:12:20] but brother Branham
[1:12:23] but he said I had to leave that is
[1:12:28] he said because he would cite because
[1:12:31] every every word that comes out of the
[1:12:33] man we will be held
[1:12:35] because every word brings a seed
[1:12:40] the prophet of God says it doesn't
[1:12:42] matter how your children walk
[1:12:46] tell the very best of them
[1:12:52] because every word is a seed
[1:13:24] and express through our own existence
[1:13:31] to express everything that was was
[1:13:34] detained because of sin
[1:13:37] and we should then be careful what we
[1:13:39] speak
[1:13:41] and before we spoke we had to think
[1:13:47] about them the idea or the locals had to
[1:13:50] come foreign
[1:13:56] that the greatest company that there is
[1:13:58] in the world
[1:14:01] the most that is the most outstanding
[1:14:03] and lucrative
[1:14:06] is the company of the entertainment
[1:14:10] industry
[1:14:14] and it maintains the people entertained
[1:14:18] in in in in in all the the networks
[1:14:21] social networking entertainment in there
[1:14:25] in video games
[1:14:39] because what he wants to do is warp the
[1:14:42] mind of this generation
[1:14:48] and no longer have the mind of God
[1:14:55] that's why this generation is a
[1:14:57] generation there they're a mind of
[1:15:00] thinking
[1:15:02] they are captivated by thinking of hell
[1:15:08] but the people of God are young or older
[1:15:12] people
[1:15:14] we should be willing
[1:15:18] to renounce all of that activity
[1:15:25] takes away my mind from the thinking of
[1:15:28] God
[1:15:30] and I should occupy myself daily
[1:15:37] of every Saturday to captivity for the
[1:15:41] word of God
[1:15:46] and then you can go and use the social
[1:15:49] workings
[1:15:52] to find your identity before the my the
[1:15:56] before God I wanna
[1:16:10] he pays attention to the mind
[1:16:17] and Christ is the head of the body of
[1:16:20] Christ of his church
[1:16:24] then the body of Christ foreign
[1:17:20] the feminist part of God
[1:17:25] and being that the that the head came
[1:17:28] down it spoke through its meaning
[1:17:32] and the mouth of God is a prophet
[1:17:36] he spoke to us the word of God
[1:17:42] and the word of God has made us known
[1:17:46] the thoughts of God
[1:17:49] now today
[1:17:52] taking the message that God brought us
[1:17:57] a
[1:18:00] doubt what God has brought through us to
[1:18:03] through his mouth
[1:18:06] being that if I understand or don't
[1:18:09] understand
[1:18:12] it's the mind of God being expressed
[1:18:16] through his word
[1:18:20] and we trap the mind of God and subject
[1:18:23] ourselves
[1:18:24] how then is
[1:18:29] the lord of the earth
[1:18:34] and when he created all the animals the
[1:18:37] Lord created all the animals upon the
[1:18:39] face of the Earth
[1:18:43] and he brought them to Adam to see what
[1:18:46] he would name them
[1:18:50] and Adam put place the name to Every
[1:18:54] Creature
[1:18:56] why did he call the horse a horse
[1:19:04] I want to bring your attention to this a
[1:19:06] moment
[1:19:10] how did Adam encounter the word horse
[1:19:17] why isn't the horse called an eagle
[1:19:21] but it's
[1:19:25] why is the ego named an eagle
[1:19:32] remember the atom at that moment
[1:19:35] had not Fallen
[1:19:42] it was to disturb man
[1:19:48] for him not to capture the thought of
[1:19:51] the mind of God
[1:19:54] and in capturing the thought of the mind
[1:19:57] of God
[1:19:58] for him to speak
[1:20:02] but when the Lord brought the animals to
[1:20:05] Adam
[1:20:06] Adam had not Fallen as of yet
[1:20:12] he was in that condition of it
[1:20:15] sufficiently in the image of God
[1:20:18] and when each animal was brought to
[1:20:21] Atlanta
[1:20:24] Adam had in himself the inspiration
[1:20:30] that's Supernatural elements
[1:20:35] you and I call today Revel
[1:20:47] and he identified Every Creature
[1:20:50] according to its characteristics
[1:20:54] because of the appearance of how he
[1:20:57] appeared to adamant
[1:21:00] but because Adam had the mind of God
[1:21:05] as Adam had the mind of God
[1:21:09] the thought of God
[1:21:14] and him by inspiration capture the
[1:21:17] thought
[1:21:20] and he spoke and it does not matter how
[1:21:23] much time passed by
[1:21:27] what of God is expressed correctly
[1:21:34] there will not be enough demons in hell
[1:21:37] that can ever be
[1:22:14] hey the sons of God to be made
[1:22:17] manifested today
[1:22:21] that means that there will be no one for
[1:22:23] there is a Son of God that would not
[1:22:25] that would fail to be there
[1:22:29] but everyone that was in the thought of
[1:22:32] God that before the foundation of the
[1:22:34] world
[1:22:36] they will not failed to make sure that
[1:22:40] they will come forward
[1:22:42] as the horse cannot stop from being a
[1:22:45] horse
[1:22:47] and no one can change its mind
[1:22:53] the son of God has always been and will
[1:22:56] always continue to be a son
[1:23:00] and it does not matter what hell calls
[1:23:03] you is
[1:23:06] that will not change the name that God
[1:23:10] gave you
[1:23:17] Joshua was there with all the Giants in
[1:23:20] that battle
[1:23:21] and and the light of the day was going
[1:23:24] away
[1:23:27] Joshua knew that if the the sun would go
[1:23:29] down
[1:23:31] that the enemies would regroup
[1:23:36] they would have time to eat and recover
[1:23:39] their strength
[1:23:41] it would be very difficult to destroy
[1:23:44] them
[1:23:47] but in the inspiration of God
[1:23:53] Joshua knew that God had given them the
[1:23:56] Victory
[1:23:58] and he could not let that moment
[1:24:03] and Joshua by inspiration of God
[1:24:06] inspiration is inspiration of God is
[1:24:11] not a killing spoke
[1:25:16] prayer was the cause foreign
[1:26:27] and the thought of God was manifested
[1:26:34] Moses before the Red Sea
[1:26:37] because
[1:26:39] and when he was before the Red Sea he
[1:26:42] said Lord what what should I do
[1:26:45] and Lord help me what should I do
[1:26:48] and you and I we know what happened
[1:26:53] Moses didn't need to ask God but he says
[1:26:58] I've already showed you if I've already
[1:27:00] trained
[1:27:03] in private and in public Moises the
[1:27:07] Moses speak
[1:27:15] how did Moses know that what he had
[1:27:18] would open up the Red Sea
[1:27:22] why didn't he ask for both
[1:27:24] foreign
[1:28:14] look at these Egyptians I want you to
[1:28:18] see them very good because from here on
[1:28:20] today you're never going to see them
[1:28:21] again
[1:28:22] he says and Moses are looking
[1:28:36] because Moses entered into the Divine
[1:28:39] channel
[1:28:42] that took him straight to the mind of
[1:28:44] God
[1:28:47] captured the mind of God
[1:28:51] he knew exactly what he is
[1:28:59] so sure
[1:29:05] he knew that no one would would pass
[1:29:09] except those that were under him
[1:29:14] where were the squirrels that were
[1:29:17] created today
[1:29:21] brother Branham didn't put God into a
[1:29:24] problem
[1:29:27] and God didn't say uh where am I going
[1:29:31] to get these squirrels from
[1:29:36] when he said the first one came to being
[1:29:39] he said he didn't say that was enough no
[1:29:41] no no no no God said no no no no
[1:29:45] I have I have kept these squirrels from
[1:29:49] the beginning
[1:29:51] I can no longer hold them best
[1:29:57] it's the day that you have to come and
[1:30:01] speak those
[1:30:15] a squirrel came from a place that there
[1:30:18] would never be a squirrel
[1:30:23] it didn't matter the adversity
[1:30:32] that is
[1:30:36] he cannot remain with it he has to let
[1:30:40] it goes
[1:30:43] when you are under sickness and Hell
[1:30:46] pressures
[1:30:50] the devil will always try to confound
[1:30:53] your mind
[1:30:56] the hurt of your body
[1:30:59] he tries to confound your mind
[1:31:03] he black foreign
[1:32:04] principio
[1:32:37] against two the one we read at the very
[1:32:40] beginning
[1:32:43] but I'm not going to read it from the
[1:32:46] very beginning
[1:32:48] and I didn't read it from the very
[1:32:50] beginning so that I could save time
[1:32:53] but look at verse 9.
[1:32:59] that says that the spirit and the bride
[1:33:02] say the same thing
[1:33:07] how is it that the bride says the same
[1:33:10] thing that the spirit says
[1:33:14] she has the mind of God
[1:33:23] but brother how do I I work that out how
[1:33:27] do I get to that place
[1:33:30] first Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9
[1:33:33] it says is
[1:33:34] it but it is written
[1:33:37] as it is written
[1:33:41] I have not seen
[1:33:48] ombre
[1:33:49] neither have entered into the Harvest
[1:33:54] the things which God had prepared for
[1:33:57] them that love him
[1:33:58] forgive me for saying what I'm going to
[1:34:01] say
[1:34:04] I know that all the revelations forgive
[1:34:07] me for what I'm going to say I know that
[1:34:08] all the Revelation that the prophet is
[1:34:12] you could know that all that description
[1:34:15] could be applied to all of that
[1:34:18] is
[1:34:20] but I want I want to put us into a into
[1:34:23] the hard place
[1:34:26] do you know that there are three kinds
[1:34:28] of Believers
[1:34:33] and the three kinds of believers they
[1:34:35] can they can go and admire the the
[1:34:36] revelations of the of the Middle East
[1:34:40] but this scriptures
[1:34:44] in its Essence it does not speak of
[1:34:47] three kinds of
[1:34:58] if there was something that could go out
[1:35:01] to three kinds of Believers
[1:35:04] classes
[1:35:07] there there are two kinds that will
[1:35:10] never understand
[1:35:14] and only the genuine Believers will
[1:35:17] understand it that's why verse 10 says
[1:35:21] he said Peru says but
[1:35:24] half
[1:35:56] now listen less it does not say no in
[1:36:00] espanol they say no as us
[1:36:03] knows
[1:36:06] God hath revealed them unto us for Real
[1:36:10] Estate by his spirit
[1:36:14] for the spirit searches all things
[1:36:20] yay the Deep things of God
[1:36:26] what is deeper than the God's own mind
[1:36:32] and the Holy Spirit comes
[1:36:38] so that you would know the deeper things
[1:36:41] of the mind of God
[1:36:45] according concerning your
[1:36:47] s intended
[1:36:50] I didn't I didn't I don't think that I I
[1:36:52] got you today
[1:36:56] what was the Holy Ghost given foreign
[1:37:54] Spirit witches of God
[1:38:00] that we might know the things that are
[1:38:02] freely given to us
[1:38:06] the holy spirit is given to me
[1:38:09] so that I will know okay
[1:38:13] that what God has given to me
[1:38:18] and what how do I know what God has
[1:38:21] given to me
[1:38:25] that's the same thing that Adam that
[1:38:28] Moses that Joshua that William Branham
[1:38:30] they kept it is
[1:38:36] the holy spirit will reveal to us the
[1:38:39] things concerning about us before the
[1:38:41] foundation
[1:38:44] that's why the Holy Ghost was given to
[1:38:47] us
[1:38:49] and why do we hear so much words how
[1:38:54] how come we have so much services and we
[1:38:57] hear so many tapes
[1:39:00] the Revelation comes by the hearing of
[1:39:04] the word of God
[1:39:05] not knowledge
[1:39:08] the Revelation
[1:39:15] heard but it did not profit
[1:39:20] because it was not mixed with faith
[1:39:23] those that hurt it
[1:39:27] and Revelation is the supernatural
[1:39:37] albums of God is
[1:39:41] and it permits you to know or to
[1:39:45] recognize
[1:39:49] the purpose that God had about you is
[1:40:05] the prophet of God says that God took a
[1:40:08] picture of you before the turn of the
[1:40:10] world
[1:40:13] and when I find myself and I know what
[1:40:16] God said about me
[1:40:21] shall know even as also I am known and
[1:40:24] foreign
[1:40:42] and that's why the spirit and the bride
[1:40:45] say come
[1:40:55] they're doing me
[1:40:57] forgive me
[1:40:59] I want to respect the time uh
[1:41:03] Juan Cinco John
[1:41:06] is
[1:41:13] strawberries are on top of the case
[1:41:18] 19 of John
[1:41:24] yeah
[1:41:27] if you reset him tell me it was so good
[1:41:29] here
[1:41:31] I would say I can't speak there okay
[1:41:33] because I'm not going to finish yeah
[1:42:17] how many sons does God have
[1:42:26] the second question is how many of us
[1:42:29] are sons of God
[1:42:32] but how many sons does God have
[1:42:36] uh God only had one
[1:42:40] they only begotten of the Father
[1:42:45] the only begotten of the father makes
[1:42:49] God reveals
[1:42:53] but the reason that you and I are sons
[1:42:56] of God is
[1:42:59] that is because we are part of the only
[1:43:02] begotten
[1:43:04] and if the only begotten son
[1:43:10] does not do anything unless the father
[1:43:13] show him
[1:43:15] and I am in only begotten son of the
[1:43:20] father
[1:43:22] I am a member of the body of Christ
[1:43:26] Anton says
[1:43:28] then I can do nothing
[1:43:32] [Applause]
[1:43:41] how to then I get to the place where I
[1:43:44] see the father do it foreign
[1:43:46] [Applause]
[1:44:13] [Applause]
[1:44:51] he didn't ask me to do that that's why I
[1:44:55] don't do that
[1:44:57] do you understand me oh he says
[1:45:00] Moses go and Liberate the people
[1:45:04] Joshua don't let them go over there
[1:45:07] Adam go and put them names Thomas
[1:45:13] what would he tell him
[1:45:18] what who would know what God has for the
[1:45:21] brothers
[1:45:22] is the business of food of him
[1:45:28] and God will reveal to him
[1:45:32] by the holy spirit that he gave to him
[1:45:38] and he will know the depth of God
[1:45:44] individual and there is nothing that
[1:45:48] nothing deeper for the individual
[1:45:52] than to know who he is
[1:45:56] and when he knows who he is
[1:46:02] in the Bible that anyone can ever have
[1:46:07] it doesn't matter it does not deal with
[1:46:09] who is everybody else
[1:46:13] to Abraham it was fine what God asked of
[1:46:16] it
[1:46:18] but God is asking something of me
[1:46:22] God wants something of you is
[1:46:28] simply by the depth of God
[1:46:33] which the holy spirit will take you in
[1:46:36] your life
[1:46:40] Can you capture the thought of God
[1:46:43] concerning you foreign
[1:46:46] that's why the body has many members
[1:46:50] everyone in particular
[1:46:54] what God has given to you concerning you
[1:46:58] do it
[1:47:00] but just assure yourself that it is
[1:47:03] God's thoughts
[1:47:06] it is not the manifestation of the sons
[1:47:09] of God in the future
[1:47:11] that is a full videos
[1:48:02] it's the correct inspiration in the
[1:48:05] correct channel to the correct
[1:48:06] individual
[1:48:09] for you to know what is the mind of God
[1:48:14] when God reveals to you by divine
[1:48:16] inspiration
[1:48:18] the purpose which he has for you
[1:48:22] there's nothing that can is take it away
[1:48:26] it's a seal
[1:48:30] no one can find it
[1:48:32] no one can go against it there's no
[1:48:35] words it's
[1:48:37] an explosion of Life foreign
