[23:09] is
[23:13] [Music]
[23:19] thank you
[23:21] foreign
[23:25] [Music]
[24:30] his position to position and
[24:32] responsibility
[24:34] irresponsibility with a subtitles
[24:39] armed and dangerous
[24:47] armado
[24:49] armed and dangerous
[24:52] in the Book of Genesis people of the
[24:54] Genesis for we just read
[24:58] we see a picture here
[25:03] how God made Man In His Image
[25:08] and you notice that God gave man
[25:12] Dominion
[25:15] over all the creation that God made
[25:21] he made man to have dominion is
[25:32] lost Dominion
[25:36] God said to them to be fruitful and
[25:39] multiply
[25:44] and have dominions
[25:48] it's a it's a
[25:52] but because of the Fall we understand
[25:58] when I when I see and read the
[26:01] newspapers
[26:05] and I see
[26:07] all the people and how the children are
[26:11] just doing bad
[26:16] and the parents have no control over
[26:19] them
[26:21] the nation has no control over them
[26:26] because the nation the world suffers
[26:30] from parent delinquency
[26:35] I hate to see parents
[26:40] there
[26:43] that say something to their children
[26:47] and for example they say if you do that
[26:50] again I'm going to spank you yeah
[26:55] and kids when they grow up
[26:59] the child says you hit me and I'll hit
[27:03] you back
[27:06] parents don't even have dominion over
[27:10] their own
[27:11] householders
[27:14] but to attain
[27:16] the position
[27:20] we must have responsibility
[27:25] and having this responsibility
[27:31] what's a great load upon us
[27:35] we are not made
[27:37] by God
[27:40] to just have different children
[27:44] but to bring them up in the admonition
[27:48] of the lord
[27:51] we must understand
[27:55] our rights and our privileges
[27:59] if we don't then the enemy will rob us
[28:03] of them
[28:06] I like to consider a few scriptures and
[28:09] if you would open your Bibles to the
[28:11] Book of Psalms
[28:15] and Psalms 8 Salmo Ocho
[28:19] we wonder sometimes who man is
[28:26] and we know that no matter how strong a
[28:31] man is in life
[28:35] by the age of 60 the Bible says
[28:40] he begins to fall away
[28:45] and some that are very strong
[28:50] make it to the age of 80.
[28:55] very few make it to 90 or say even a
[28:58] hundred
[29:01] and over a hundred
[29:04] they can be counted
[29:08] but the times
[29:11] that we live in you know
[29:15] they are very
[29:17] dangerous times
[29:20] a very hard times
[29:23] and as a minister
[29:27] I feel I have a responsibility
[29:32] to try to help people foreign
[30:10] and he said thou art mindful of him
[30:17] I don't know what that scripture does to
[30:20] you but it it filled me that I want to I
[30:23] want to cry with gratitude
[30:26] when I cry I don't cry because of Sorrow
[30:30] no Euro I have a joy in me
[30:35] it's like brother Jody was singing and
[30:38] we were singing thy loving kindness
[30:43] can you imagine that God is mindful of
[30:47] men
[30:50] and also the son of man is
[30:58] he paid this son of man a visit
[31:03] and then he said thou has made him a
[31:07] little lower than the Angels
[31:11] a little in other words he made him a
[31:14] little lower than God
[31:32] how many of you truthfully thinking put
[31:37] your thinking there used to be a teacher
[31:39] you used to say put on your thinking
[31:41] apps
[31:44] can really
[31:46] say
[31:48] God has crowned me with Glory and Honor
[31:54] I can raise my hands
[31:57] and I can say your brothers here that
[32:01] God has crowned me with glory and honor
[32:05] and when I think of that and I think
[32:08] that he was mindful of me
[32:12] I have no no words
[32:16] I had no sufficient words
[32:18] to describe what I feel
[32:23] okay
[32:25] I I want to get a picture for you and I
[32:28] don't want to put the card before the
[32:30] horse
[32:33] but I wanna
[32:35] I wanna just take it slowly and and
[32:37] bring out a picture for you on man and
[32:40] his responsibility and
[32:42] positions
[32:45] and I gotta tell you that this man that
[32:48] has honor and glory is
[32:51] armed and dangerous
[32:56] in in the Book of Genesis again
[32:59] chapter 3
[33:02] we find a very sad picture here
[33:07] verse 24. cuatro
[33:11] he drove out the men
[33:15] I'm gonna paraphrase that of the Garden
[33:18] of Eden
[33:20] and a flaming sword which turned every
[33:23] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[33:30] he plays cherubim there we know that
[33:34] but but what What a Sad picture
[33:38] to see God's representative
[33:44] a man that he had crowned with glory and
[33:48] honored
[33:50] Gloria be driven out
[33:53] now that's a sad picture
[33:56] to me the saddest thing in the world
[34:01] for me would be
[34:04] not to lose a mother or father nope
[34:08] not to lose my children
[34:11] not even to lose my wife
[34:14] but to find out in that day that I
[34:18] cannot go in foreign
[34:38] no wonder the Bible says Heaven and
[34:41] Earth
[34:42] flesh from them
[34:46] okay now
[34:48] we as people
[34:50] Gente we ask God a lot of things if
[34:57] you don't know God
[35:01] the Bible says him that loveth not
[35:04] knoweth not God
[35:06] because God is love okay so then if we
[35:11] don't know God
[35:13] much less will we know our privileges
[35:20] we will never have the position of
[35:23] responsibility
[35:26] it is not just coming to church and
[35:29] trying to be a Christian
[35:32] piano many many people try that
[35:36] it's to know him
[35:40] and to know him and know what he has
[35:44] given us
[35:47] we we
[35:49] sometimes see people having a repeat uh
[35:54] repetition of a a prayer
[35:59] you know they they repeat prayer
[36:03] and then you find other people that are
[36:06] always asking God for the same thing
[36:10] and then you find other people that say
[36:13] well God didn't give it to me he gave it
[36:15] to them but he didn't give it to me
[36:19] and I say well who in the world put all
[36:22] those thoughts in your mind
[36:26] now in our minds
[36:29] we try to think like people in the world
[36:36] but we cannot if we are Christians
[36:41] we are not of this world
[36:45] our thinking is not like any ordinary
[36:49] man
[36:51] we are armed and dangerous
[36:57] now the world thinks they have the
[37:00] Armament yeah
[37:15] this lesson that I have gets better as
[37:19] it and I didn't misuse English when I
[37:22] say gooder I like to say that I know I
[37:24] know properly you would say it gets
[37:26] better but I'm gonna say it gets cuter
[37:29] yeah
[37:32] in the book of the Ephesians
[37:36] chapter 2
[37:38] and verse 12.
[37:41] that at that time you were without
[37:45] Christo
[37:49] when you find the word Christ
[37:54] it simply means the anointed one
[37:58] now let me rephrase some say don't turn
[38:02] to but let me rephrase it for you
[38:06] who is
[38:09] and the son of man whom thou visited
[38:15] we were without Christ
[38:18] we were
[38:20] away from god
[38:24] let's finish reading being aliens from
[38:28] the Commonwealth of Israel
[38:32] and strangers from the covenants a
[38:35] promise
[38:40] without God in the world
[38:43] that is pretty sad
[38:46] when you don't have God
[38:49] you don't have God because you go to
[38:52] church
[38:54] in other words you come to worship Him
[38:57] in spirit and in truth when you have him
[39:03] you come into church
[39:06] to seek help
[39:09] so that you can also worship him
[39:13] because he only accepts one kind of
[39:16] worship
[39:17] it's got to be spirit
[39:21] in other words armed and dangerous
[39:26] right
[39:27] without God in your how how terrible I
[39:31] don't know have you ever been in a
[39:33] hospital
[39:34] I have been in hospitals where men are
[39:37] dying
[39:40] the most pitiful side
[39:44] is to see people dying they don't have
[39:47] Christ in their heart Hombres
[39:53] I saw a man he was real big
[39:57] I went I went to to the hospital I
[40:00] walked into his room
[40:02] he was dying when I went in he was
[40:06] sitting on on the bed
[40:09] and he was going ahiba
[40:13] he didn't have Christ in him
[40:17] outside the nurse went inside
[40:20] she came out
[40:22] two minutes later
[40:24] he was dead
[40:26] without crying
[40:29] this woman was dying one day
[40:34] she had told the prophets
[40:39] give your religion to the cows
[40:44] two days later she was dying
[40:46] she could only remember one name
[40:50] bring me brother Branham
[40:53] bring me the man whom God visited
[40:58] now she knew them
[41:03] that she needed that Christ
[41:09] but when the man reached the hospital
[41:16] what a terrible condition
[41:20] in the Book of James you don't have to
[41:22] turn to it chapter 4 and verse 7 says
[41:24] resist the devil
[41:26] Diablo this is Santiago now a lot of a
[41:29] lot of people have a hard time resisting
[41:32] him
[41:36] to resist him
[41:39] you you gotta know him
[41:42] and you gotta know God
[41:44] and then you gotta know who you are
[41:48] you cannot resist him if you aren't
[41:51] armed
[41:53] when you are armed the devil says I
[41:58] ain't going near him
[42:00] he's dangerous
[42:04] he can put the demons out because he's
[42:08] got the armaments
[42:10] but if he knows that you don't know
[42:16] oh he'll make hamburger out of him
[42:21] there was a collared player
[42:25] some of you older people remember him
[42:27] Satchel Paige the most sexual page
[42:30] he said one day
[42:33] only
[42:34] he said
[42:36] how can a man know how old he is
[42:41] if he doesn't know how old he is
[42:47] except for a minute I scratch my head
[42:51] repeat it again
[42:54] how can a man know how old he is
[42:59] if he doesn't know how you know
[43:04] it doesn't make sense but it does
[43:07] now
[43:10] the word of God
[43:12] you'll see how this saying of such a
[43:15] page here
[43:16] um
[43:18] the Bible says meditate
[43:23] whatsoever things are pure and lovely
[43:26] just meditate on them
[43:31] we find people in control
[43:34] don't have a chance to meditate
[43:39] you know why
[43:41] too much television television
[43:45] their their minds are constantly being
[43:48] entertained by television
[43:52] you give me a television set and this is
[43:55] what I'll do with it
[43:57] I'll get this thing and I got
[44:00] changing channels
[44:02] they say we'll leave it in one is
[44:09] now the heavens soap operas adulteries
[44:12] fornications
[44:17] and then the cartoons are worse
[44:21] oh my kids don't watch nothing but

[47:31] obedient
[47:32] am I going to pray that that be taken
[47:34] away from me
[47:35] because he's going to come back on you
[47:38] because you've never learned your
[47:41] position you don't have your position
[47:44] you don't have you don't have
[47:46] responsibility responsibility so you are
[47:49] not armed and you are not dangerous
[47:51] Devils you say the Devils he says
[47:56] foreign
[48:04] because you
[48:06] said this claim something that you don't
[48:10] have positions
[48:12] then you wonder why you're gonna you got
[48:14] problems
[48:16] you don't know how to resist the Devils
[48:19] try to resist him by yourself
[48:32] in second Corinthians
[48:37] I don't have a spicy message like you
[48:39] heard last Sunday
[48:44] mine is
[48:46] strictly doctrinal and Mio is
[48:51] second Corinthians five
[48:57] it says
[48:59] therefore
[49:01] the mode okay
[49:03] If any man be in Christ
[49:06] what is
[49:10] he was without Christ
[49:13] without hope
[49:18] sounds
[49:19] [Applause]
[49:21] cries
[49:24] in other words he already has received
[49:28] the Covenant of Promise yes
[49:31] let's see what he says he is a new
[49:34] creature is
[49:36] can everybody repeat with me he
[49:39] is ah you creature
[49:44] he's a new creature
[49:47] or is that false where's false
[49:50] his new creature
[49:55] old things
[49:59] old things he's still doing those things
[50:02] that you did before you claim to be this
[50:05] all things
[50:08] you don't have positions you don't have
[50:10] responsibility you're not armed you're
[50:13] not dangerous
[50:16] it says
[50:18] oh things are passed away all
[50:27] I become new
[50:32] yes
[50:35] he's a new race
[50:40] he's a super
[50:42] Breeze Jesus
[50:47] and it wasn't so much what we gave up no
[50:50] I look at the hummus but it's what we
[50:52] received that's what we take on hey
[50:56] Ruth Ruth in the Bible
[50:59] was in a land that was suffering with
[51:02] famine
[51:04] actually Israel was suffering with a
[51:07] famine
[51:09] that's how Naomi went into the land of
[51:12] Mohamed
[51:14] well when Ruth came back with Naomi
[51:27] she only
[51:30] took on boaz's riches
[51:35] and the poverty went away
[51:38] she didn't give up her loneliness
[51:43] she only took on the companionship
[51:48] you understand
[51:51] so then when we are in Christ
[51:54] it's not so much that we leave this
[51:57] one
[52:02] automatically makes all
[52:06] and everything everything comes to do
[52:09] it's a better breed of people
[52:15] it's a great species
[52:21] that's right
[52:25] now
[52:28] I want you to think for a minute
[52:31] because I want you to defeat the Devil
[52:36] but you're not going to defend him by
[52:38] saying I know who you are no no because
[52:41] let me tell you he knows who you are yes
[52:44] too
[52:46] and he knows what you like
[52:49] he knows more about you than you think
[52:57] everybody goes to church there's a bunch
[52:59] of church girls that are going to hell
[53:02] going to church don't make it
[53:06] I don't come to church to be saved
[53:09] come because I'm saved
[53:12] is that what I did what he did for
[53:15] foreign
[54:05] you're still with me
[54:09] Jesus
[54:12] was so
[54:14] he triumphs so much Jesus
[54:19] that is spoiled
[54:23] he spoiled principalities principals
[54:27] and powers
[54:29] and he made a show of them openly I mean
[54:32] second chapter of Colossians 2 15 color
[54:35] senses
[54:37] he Triumph in over themes
[54:43] if the devil Diablo knows that we don't
[54:47] know what belongs to us is
[54:53] he can have us by the neck
[54:59] because he knows
[55:03] that you don't know
[55:06] how old you are
[55:09] who you are if a man doesn't know how
[55:13] old he is
[55:15] he doesn't know how old he is
[55:21] yeah
[55:24] if the devil knows
[55:27] listen you're sick you feel bad you got
[55:31] stress
[55:33] if he knows
[55:39] I'm a Christian I I'm by myself and I do
[55:41] this and God knows that I'm a Christian
[55:43] yeah God knows what you are yeah
[55:46] and the problem is that you also know
[55:48] but you want to be a pamparone
[55:52] but if the devil knows that you have
[55:56] been translated
[55:59] from the kingdom of darkness
[56:03] to the kingdom of God
[56:06] you become a threat to him
[56:11] because he knows your arms
[56:16] a Christian is harmed
[56:19] you think a Christian is an armed
[56:23] you take me the best in this church I
[56:26] hear some people here are bullet karate
[56:27] they're Tapas
[56:30] I can knock you down before you can even
[56:32] raise your hands
[56:34] I'll have you in a hospital bed before
[56:36] you know what's going on
[56:47] all I gotta do is speak one word
[56:49] [Applause]
[56:54] amen but we don't do that
[56:56] because our Warfare is not for them
[57:00] but if you're a good karate fighter
[57:04] someday you'll be late in the hospital
[57:06] in hospital and you're gonna want a man
[57:09] that's armed and dangerous to be at your
[57:11] side
[57:13] because you might have learned karate
[57:16] but you never learn about Christ
[57:20] position and responsibility
[57:23] under a New Covenant now
[57:28] in I'm not gonna read it and I don't
[57:30] turn to it just mark it down but when
[57:32] you go home I want you to read psalms
[57:34] 105.
[57:38] and you'll notice David writing this
[57:41] Psalm how he describes what God did with
[57:45] his people
[57:48] the Bible says there was not a people
[57:52] one amongst them
[57:57] he
[58:02] may made water come out of a rock
[58:06] he made Nations fear when they came
[58:12] they were armed and dangerous
[58:16] he made a harlot is because
[58:24] she knew they were armed and dangerous
[58:29] she he made he brought him a man
[58:33] to guide them and this man was armed and
[58:37] dangerous
[58:44] to hit the people
[58:47] [Laughter]
[58:52] he could speak
[59:35] and the devil knows it
[59:39] now a lot of times when you pray
[59:42] um
[59:43] you you pray to God for the same thing
[59:46] all the time
[59:49] what if God
[59:51] has already done that
[59:53] you're asking him for something he has
[59:56] already done
[1:00:01] it's not up to God no depends
[1:00:24] but the Bible says submit yourselves to
[1:00:28] God first
[1:00:29] the fear of God
[1:00:34] you cannot resist him until you submit
[1:00:39] adios
[1:00:43] that's when you become armed and
[1:00:45] dangerous now
[1:00:50] Jesus Jesus is here estaki let's put him
[1:00:54] 2000 years

[1:01:03] there
[1:01:05] the storm was still on Jesus was there
[1:01:08] the storm was on yeah
[1:01:16] but Jesus Jesus
[1:01:19] he had to speak a word
[1:01:22] let there be light he says wins
[1:01:29] arms
[1:01:31] and when the winds heard that certain
[1:01:35] sounds
[1:01:42] it never changed the complexion of
[1:01:45] things because Jesus was there
[1:01:50] but it changed the atmosphere
[1:01:54] and everything else
[1:02:00] you can be sick
[1:02:05] until Jesus speaks the word Jesus
[1:02:10] every demon has to back up

[1:10:38] he was before the shearers
[1:10:42] but he opened not his mouth
[1:10:47] the only time he opened it
[1:10:50] was when the Covenant was taking hold
[1:10:53] cuando El pacto
[1:10:59] and he said one of his last words
[1:11:07] for they know not what they do as in
[1:11:12] all right

[1:14:53] there will be a blockage amen
[1:14:58] why can't I receive the Holy Ghost
[1:15:01] you have answered it in the process of
[1:15:04] asking
[1:15:07] because you can't
[1:15:09] because you can't believe it that is for
[1:15:12] you
[1:15:13] prophet of God says
[1:15:16] if you believe
[1:15:18] that it is for you
[1:15:20] then you will know what results it
[1:15:25] brings
[1:15:26] comes to you if you cannot receive it
[1:15:30] and you are answering it's not the guy

[1:15:36] unbelief will not let you receive the
[1:15:39] Holy Ghost

[1:15:56] is his word

[1:16:02] but he visited the son of man because he
[1:16:05] was mindful of him
