was brother Ben that had made the prayer and he was supposed to be online but for whatever reason he wasn't able to be online so we really didn't hear from him anymore after that um I was actually thinking about him during the week-long services if you know I thought maybe he had passed or something well Monday he walked in the door and he had the biggest smile on his face he looked good and he came right up to my chair and he says will you cut my hair um he said well first of all I just want to tell you that I am cancer-free you said that he had um he went to Dallas to see a doctor and they gave him one treatment of a chemo witch he said it was just like uh some kind of beads they put in him and while he was there anyway in Dallas they found a tumor in his pancreas tumor pancreas pancreas and they told him he was he more than likely had pancreatic cancer as well he came home to Cruces and they started doing his blood work to test it is and his white and red blood cells kept getting higher and higher and higher so they said well you know what we're going to send you back to Dallas so they can to check you again and they told him there that he was cancer-free that he had no sign of cancer in his body and he wanted to thank that's him and he just wanted to thank everybody for the prayers and I would like to thank the ministry of church and is and I feel very very

take any we don't take it lightly amen but let's get into the word tonight many are uh how many uh came expecting from the Lord amen so this uh this evening it's um uh it's a it's a thought I I've been having for for a few months and it's called the hiss or the python amen amen we're going to go into the book of Isaiah chapter 47. they start with the 12th verse and it reads like this yes stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou has labored from the youth less if so be thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail Mental Health Thou Art wearied in the multitude of thy councils let now the astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up foreign thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou has labored even thy Merchants from the youth loss they shall Wonder everyone to his quarter None Shall save may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated well you might ask brother what what does that uh what does this verse have to do with uh python we'll get into that in just in just a few minutes but how many have uh have ever gone into the newspaper foreign [Music] what's my Fortune for today and say Well it always gives something pretty vague right thou shall you're you're going to be prosperous uh in in a while what you've been working for is going to come to pass right so we always we're always looking at what what is our fortune and sometimes the way we act this is sometimes uh somebody will say well you're you're this way because you're a Virgo Pisces that's why that's why you have an attitude like that but the Bible talks about something a little bit different he says it says None of these things these are not none of this does course us shall save you yes amen amen so no matter what you do no matter how many horoscopes you look at none of it none of it will save you we have all that in uh so when you go to someone who is uh who may who was talking about maybe reading your fortune they read your future they bring out uh tarot cards and many times we look at that says and as a as a society I remember when I was young and I was a kid anything like that well that I that I even talked about this my mom would be so upset do not bring that witchcraft into my house we see it so it's so prevalent in our in our daily life exactly it's so common now it's infiltrated our Our lives our everyday occurrences and where does it start at it you see cartoons nowadays and it's a bunch of Witchcraft yes but when we see it the way that Society has portrayed it they have portrayed it in a way where witchcraft sorcery they they try and make it look pretty they try and make it look as it's good they try and make it look cute and believe me they have succeeded in doing that because no matter where we turned no matter what we see on TV on social media in in everyday life we see that it doesn't do anything to us we have become so desensitized to it we even say that is harmless we see that so many times in cartoons Disney cartoons we must not question those cartoons the Disney my my children have watched it yes I'm not I'm not uh I'm not uh I'm not saying that nothing has happened in my home like that you know but as you get older and as you as you look at things more and more um [Music] you really find out how slice Satan is he's made what the scripture is telling us that it shall not save you and he's made it as something that is adorable but it wasn't so that I see enough way in the time of Paul De Pablo and Silas amen amen it wasn't so back then we're going to turn into the book of Acts chapter 16. I'm going to start with the verse 16. and it came to pass as we went to prayer there's always it seems like there's always something happening when we're doing something for the Lord right when we're going out clubbing when we're going out doing doing our doing our things it seems like we're having a good time but Paul says as we went to prayer I'm high a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divinations in control which brought her Masters much gain by sooths saying now if she wasn't good at her profession this would not be a big deal yes would not be a big story but she was excellent in what she did now the word the Divination if you look in the Greek see the best griego you find the word python now if you look at Python and if you're familiar with Greek or Roman mythology and by the way Paul and Silas were in Philippi inglesia so the python was a it was a mythical serpent or dragon and this Dragon it guarded the temple yes in the Oracle of Apollo the Apollo now it was located on the Southern Slope of Mount Parnassus it was to the north of the Gulf of corintho recording the current yes the Corinthians now what's interesting about this if you look at what at uh at who Apollo was so you send me that Apollo as many of you know he he is a Greek god who says but he was the god of poetry he was a god of musica he was the god of healing but he was also a god of prophecya so as you see this young lady she had this Spirit of the Python Del piton all right she had a spirit then he owned Espiritu that if you looked at her she said if you met with her I should say she could tell you the past the future the presence and like I said she was excellent at it when she saw Paul and Silas there was something that caught my attention on this scripture she cried out in verse 17. she didn't cry out oh my gosh these are these are these are men that are not right these are men that are foolish but she cried out that's these men are the Servants of the most high God when a man of God or someone that is filled with the Holy Ghost comes into contact with the spirit like this people this spirit is can't do anything else but declare what the truth isn't in the truth that she was proclaiming she was still in the wrong so yes what she was trying to do is that spirit that was inside of her then through the area spirit that possessed her I did not want to come out it did not want to come out of this woman so what he was trying to do it it was trying to say nice things it was trying to take the attack was that it continued for many days the Bible says finally or Pablo he got tired of it after someone is proclaiming these truly these men are are men of God he even went as far as saying which show us a way of salvation well you say well well how can that be bad I mean what she's speaking is is the truth what she's speaking is right so why should why should she uh why should she be uh called out for this you know many times business the devil El Diablo is full of flatteries the oh there's no word for it labios Lagos he's full of flatteries it's like you know they are Lagos he will tell you it's the nicest things to tell you how great of a Christian you are oh you're doing great look what happened on the on the week-long uh service how the spirit of the Lord fell on you oh wow I'm so proud did you see me jump up and down oh did you hear me say amen amen oh did you hear me do this and that is and what happens we have listened to the hiss of the pieces we have listened to it and where has it brought us it has brought us to a place we don't even know what the difference is of what the message is and what the what the preacher on YouTube is saying YouTube oh it's just as good as the message oh they're they're preaching so well oh and these and these uh these these ministers on YouTube in YouTube my goodness oh yeah can we tell the difference or are we so caught up in just hearing the good things finally Paul got sick and tired because he knew he could tell what type of spirit she had yeah amen amen you know it's something Satan works a lot in in Bright Lights it works a lot like I said in flatteries he works a lot and he wants he wants everything to be a spectacle spectacular but you know how Jesus Cameo Jesus sister uh sister Ruth you know how Jesus came here they come in Bright Lights he didn't come the way that they thought that he was going to come and eat but he came in a very very humble way and here is p here is uh Paul and Silas and this did she many days Verse 18 vessels but Paul being grieved must this turned and said to the spirit as they said he he wasn't turning to the the damselves because he knew it wasn't the damn Soul he knew he knew it wasn't the girl but he turned to the spirit that I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour isn't that amazing but what does it take it takes an ear it takes sight what that Spirit was we get so drawn in by spirits around us at our enticing spirits and when her master saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught Paul and Silas and Drew them unto the marketplace unto the rulers you see the devil people don't mind it but you do things for the Lord don't mind what you're doing but many times you take any profit from him you take anything from him there's going to be a fight yes anytime there's somebody that's true that is standing up what Satan is trying to say where Satan has the problem and we're gonna go down to uh verse 20 to almost and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them is and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the Jailer to keep them safely now I want you to see a difference between what this woman or what this girl was doing establaciendo and what another man was about to do is who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks in El sepo now here's the Jailer he has seen everything that had gone on seeing what what went down I don't even know what they did he said really didn't seem anything different to me and he even put them in in the Deep part of the prison and he made their feet fast in the stock again but I want you to notice something as bad as it was for Paul and Silas they still sing and they praised God even when they were in prison when they had cast out a demon and we're stuck in prison they were beaten you and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed remote and The Keeper of the prison awakened out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been the prisoners had been fled isos so notice something else he understood that if something happened to these prisoners was responsible but I want you to know on verse 30. after all this is happening earthquake and all these walls falling down he wakes up out of his sleep first thing he says what must I do to be saved what must I do to be saved what must I do to tell the difference he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved in thy house to me that that is amazing because here's a man of of Greek knowing what could happen he's asking at that moment what must I do to be saved that is the question is what must I do to be saved here's brother Branham now notice these gifts and callings are without repentance it's your subconscious in connection with God is that force shows you things that was and will beings you get what I mean Jesus of Nazareth Jesus if he was here on Earth he looked over his audiences he could see people and he'd tell them just what they done and what was wrong what was wrong with them he talked to a woman at the well and told her he said to Philip he knowed where he had been many places where a fish was foreign one thing here in finishing terminal we are going to be Zechariah 10 6. zacarias Dias face I didn't give this to uh to the guys out in the back today you know Satan has is his so obviously but God also has his his okay thank you and I will strengthen strengthen the house of Judah and I will save the house of Joseph and I will bring them upon bring them again to place them for I have mercy upon them and they shall be as though I had not cast them off for I am the Lord their God and will hear them and they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall rejoice as as through wine yea their children shall see it and be glad their heart shall rejoice in the Lord is for he says I will call for them and gather them for I have redeemed them and they shall increase as they have increased so brother and sister we know the devil has his hair he has his way of dealing with our young people dealing with us with us people he has things he wants to tell us oh but if we can notice the difference if we can understand that God almost Mighty also has a history and his his is not to divide us is to gather us and to redeem us God bless [Applause] Ed thank you Lori can we give another one to the Lord Jesus [Applause] I said told brother Jerry back there I said did they call us up already and pray for the offering or yeah I'm under a lot of great pressure today brother Abraham said it better be good I'm under a lot of pressure and uh so today I get the call right and I was telling my wife the other day I was thinking about how I had been suffering for about probably about 26 years [Music] and suffering with back conditions it wasn't uh you know like you get a sore back it was uh disabling I mean it would put me out like exactly what sister Tabitha was talking about that that's my testimony and so I was thinking the other day I said you know God it's been about a year since I've had not even one back pain yeah I mean not even one I'm talking I've been I've been good I mean and so I guess maybe the devil thought he was going to do something to me right yes so last night I couldn't even I couldn't even hardly walk I mean you should see me I came home from work I was walking like this I want to sit down and so today well last night I ended up taking a pain pill uh and so well my daughter says you better just take half of it because you know you're not a drug addict though me me so she said you better take half so then so I took half and I felt all right this morning I was a little sore right so then the phone rings and I look at my phone and says and I had picture there in that night to ask him if I could take a whole pill you know [Music] and so so I get the call right and I let's see and I think Oh Aaron must have told Brother Caleb that my back was out oh I don't basically he's probably calling to check on me you know see how I'm doing and so I say hello hello how you doing oh good you yeah oh good good yeah yeah you think you got one in the chamber for tonight all right so uh I pulled out my revolver foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] host there was two I think they were pallets right Charlotte said it was like uh uh wood fence [Music] and so I I opened my eyes and I I just saw this thing in front of us and I went what are you awake right did I did I do that sir all right and and she kind of swear there was two of them so she swerved to the right and the other one was gonna hit us head-on I don't know if I was still like still half asleep or what the deal was okay but that palette or whatever it was in front of us but it is should have hit the grill head on the vehicle and I'm telling you God is my witness I don't know where that palette went it didn't hit the car it didn't hit under the car they hit over the car I don't know where it went no sleep on discipline so I I think it just went through the car I'm not sure but all praise and glory to the Lord Jesus and so as brother William was talking about Orlando how Jesus came right Jesus and so the Bible says that he came lowly and humbly right [Music] so in Zechariah 9 9 and they don't have these scriptures but I just want to bring this to your remembrance and it says Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation and lowly and riding upon an ass and upon the cult and upon a cult the full of an earth is right and so he came lowly and humbly amen you know um well all of a sudden well can you imagine like I've told you the story before that uh every Donkey from the time that this prophecy was made like you know you know how women how I've told you a story how some ladies like it says uh you know he's going to choose a lady right so every lady starts to prepare herself and a virgin shall conceive right right and so oh man right right away all the donkey started you know buffing themselves up and they they began to uh prance around and they'd go to the horses and the stallions stallions stud whatever you want to call them I just no okay but they would say uh did you hear what they said that the king is going to come riding on a donkey right and so every donkey was like preparing themselves but it wasn't until they don't know so there's one donkey he just so happened to be thinking himself is this is he said I I know that's me oh you're sick that's gonna be me I'm going to be the one that's going to carry the king well as he started getting up in age he began to think uh well I mean maybe it's next year right and so they they would put stuff on his back they would put them loads of wood and he would take a step and he'd be oh oh [Music] right and so another day another year went by and he said man I'm wondering if that's gonna be me man I think it's going to be me right and so he they put something on him and he just couldn't do it he got tired right but a lot of times we get tired right we get tired and on our walk with the Lord right and so then this donkey yesterday the Bible says so this donkey he he started the next day is he just closed his eyes and he died right and he died in shame he died telling everybody oh I'm going to be the one to carry the king but then we find out over in judges that one day there was a man that was walking around and he heard the footsteps of about a thousand soldiers um he went over to a newly fresh dead donkey foreign I am quick everything's going good right but like we heard brother William says the devil's very shrewd right and so he knows exactly he knows you better than you know yourself right and so all of a sudden we say oh we're gonna go do this we're going to go do that but the Bible says that we need to exercise ourselves into godliness [Music] right but we forget to do our exercises right we we don't forget to do the worldly exercises or the physical exercise right we say oh I'm gonna I'm gonna go walk a mile today I'm going to start walking every day you know like I've always said diets just don't work [Music] but you have to do it with uh you have to make a decision now we're talking about the day that I died right and so like we've heard many testimonies testimonials mainly brother Jerry right his testimony is though I used to want to go hang out with friends out in the world and we would do this well I didn't I didn't do that my friends weren't in the world my friends were in church and so we did some bad things right not to throw anybody under the bus but you remember brother Matthew we used to do some bad stuff right install my friends weren't out in the world we were in church but we thought we were good because we came to church and then we would look at guys like brother Jerry he's hanging all the guys down in the world and here we were inside the church right and so that's the way it went and so you know as a young teenager right we I started to make wrong decisions right and I started going down roads probably well not probably but roads that I shouldn't have gone down right and but one day I remember I was 17 years old right and I was sitting in the Pew and if we were back in Cedar Hills I was sitting on this side of the church and I didn't I wasn't going to go to church that day in fact yeah you know because I I got real smart because at my house like you didn't tell my dad that hey you're not I'm not going to church right so if anybody knows my dad he wasn't the kind that says okay you know for you oh foreign [Music] you know not to throw nobody under the bus oh but Gene's going to come pick me up um right and so sometimes I didn't make it to church and then my dad would say were you were you at church and so I I started so that that one Sunday night I wasn't going to go to church but something compelled me to go and it was a youth service right and so I had already had my mind all made up I was going to go to Colorado Rivera Colorado and I was going to go ranching out in Colorado right I had been up to Colorado Springs I was like oh man this is this is where I want to live right here Colorado Springs right and so there I was in the corner over there and it was a youth service and uh the speaker for the night was the speaker from the morning and so we get to use service I said okay we're gonna ask brother Tommy to come and come up to the platform yo okay we heard him this morning going to be a long service right and so there I was in the corner and so I remember when he was talking right after the service he called up the youth to the front this position and he called me to come to the front image and so I came up and I was just standing there like everybody else you know and all of a sudden he came over to me and he just like like put his hands on me well I don't know what happened I I can't tell you you know but like brother Jacob was giving his testimony something just started shaking inside of me well then I I like I just just grabbed him I just was holding on to him like for dear life and I don't know what it was but I just said save me but from that day forward I had never been the same the world died out it just completely died out to me and so that was the day that I died and so you like I said you know I had these big plans and so I remember one day I said a friend of mine he owned a a horse ranch there in Silver City Rancho in Silver City he was a doctor of mine I used to go visit him and I was gonna buy a horse from him and he says hey look at my facility I said what do you he rents out all these stalls and so I said uh he said you know Danny I'll sell this to you um he said on our owner financed it for you and it makes this amount of money and uh so you you know you can just take it over and I'll help you out and so I said oh that sounds good and so I remember uh brother Tommy happened to come to my house and uh he he one day I just came home from work and his car was there and I said uh I said uh you know we he came into the house and we visited and so when he was getting ready to leave I said uh brother Tommy yeah I was young I mean I was I just got married I must have been what I got married at 18 so I must have been like 1920 around there the whole engine because maybe a little older Skype was living in Tyrone so nice so anyways I said brother tell me there's this guy you know I told him the whole story and he says uh oh okay yeah let me let me let me pray about it and I'll get back to you and so a couple weeks he didn't say nothing and uh so I thought well I'm gonna go and ask him he's been saying I said uh so uh brother Tommy had you had any time to pray about what I asked you all right and he said uh he just like looked at me like if I had fallen out of a tree oh man he forgot what I asked him and then he just stay quiet like you know that awkward silence yeah and so he turns and looks at me and he says follow me I go to church and so he said uh why don't you get a passport and gold me to Colombia Colombia no no no sorry it was to Mexico City Mexico [Music] and I didn't know what I was getting myself and so I said yes I will I forgot all about the horse right and so I said yeah I'll follow you see this eagle and I've never been the same now have I gotten tired be like the eagle that renews its strengths right because we're living in a time where this is Showtime this is this is what we've all worked up to this is what we're this is our our Super Bowl it's the initial Super Bowl right it's not time to get tired right now it's not time to be thinking that we're going to be leaving church it's time to be thinking that we have a better idea this is Showtime because the Bible says I saw the Lord high and lift it up it was the year if he's flying at us and fight this joke they say tell us this joke that man died don't be trying to resurrect me right let's just go on fight forward let's love one another one another it's time to unite ourselves I want to read to you two quotes here now brother Brown was reading out of the book of Exodus and he said now so now the book of Exodus is one of my favorite books of the Old Testament the very word accident this means the called out in other words it means the church itself they were called out the people of God while they were down in Egypt so they were called the people of God how many people of God right they were called out they were called the people of God down in Egypt and then when they were called out they were then the Church of God foreign there's only one Church and that's the Church of those who are born again and that's the only church yes you're you're never joining God's Church there's no way of doing it at all and you're born in God's Church Jesus says except a man be born again he cannot understand the Kingdom of Heaven there's no way of understanding until you've been born again and then God reveals himself to you and then you know that you've passed from Death onto life because no man can call Jesus the Christ Jesus Christ only by the Holy Spirit the only way that you'll ever know that Jesus is the Christ Jesus Christ is when the Holy Spirit personally witnesses to you personally test difficult state that he is the resurrected Lord Jesus no matter what he would do what kind of signs what kind of Miracles you'll never know it until your personal experience with God you say well I believe it you look real because the Bible says well that's good is the Bible is true well the preacher said so perhaps he knows but what do you know about it you'll never know it until it's revealed to you individually by the Holy Spirit individuals and then by accepting it you become a new creature and Christ Jesus Christ Jesus born the second time now you can't live and twice you have to die once in order to be born again so when you die out to yourself when you are born the new of the Holy Spirit you say is there's no reasoning the word of God you just take it for what it says that proves it so the last scripture as we've been taught that we need to include ourselves in the scripture right so I'll leave you with second Corinthians 5 17. therefore if Danny be in Christ let's repeat it so you just say your name therefore he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new amen God bless
