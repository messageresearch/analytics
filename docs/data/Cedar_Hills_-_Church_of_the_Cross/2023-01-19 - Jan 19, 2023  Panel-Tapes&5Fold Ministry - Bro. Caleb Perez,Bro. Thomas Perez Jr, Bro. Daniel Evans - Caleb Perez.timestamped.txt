[8:33] would you just uh tell us a little bit
[8:36] about yourself and and uh whatever the
[8:38] Lord has put on persona
[8:42] I feel like I'm telling a little bit
[8:45] about myself to my family
[8:54] you all are absolutely precious it is
[8:58] we're going to talk about a little bit
[9:00] about
[9:01] um some of the Tate Ministry and and
[9:04] things that have to do with the tapes
[9:06] and um
[9:09] the first memory I have is a child
[9:13] is pulling myself up above a piece of
[9:17] furniture
[9:20] and looking down and seeing the
[9:22] reel-to-real tape goes
[9:27] and and I remembered when when the one
[9:30] side got small yeah
[9:34] that was my favorite part because that
[9:36] was the prayer line is it uh
[9:46] and in growing up we didn't we never
[9:48] went to church
[9:50] until I was about 18 years old
[9:54] and then my uncle Ronnie Evans was
[9:57] healed of cancer Ronnie Evans was
[9:59] another cancer and he gave a testimony
[10:02] at brother Mark condos church
[10:07] and then we started going to church to
[10:10] we we went to hear him speak and then
[10:13] after that we stayed at church
[10:18] and that church was a tape Church
[10:21] there was never a minister that ever
[10:23] spoke
[10:26] and I was there until uh moved to
[10:29] Jeffersonville yeah yesterday
[10:32] and it was in Jeffersonville for 17
[10:34] years
[10:36] and now I'm back home in Tucson
[10:40] my grandfather many of you know him as
[10:43] Welch Evans
[10:44] um
[10:46] I gave the testimony to some of the
[10:49] youth about
[10:50] um him getting bit by the rattlesnake
[10:52] one of those so many stories that you
[10:54] all know
[10:58] my other grandfather was Carl wheeler
[11:01] who was a deacon of brother Brown's
[11:02] church
[11:03] [Music]
[11:06] so I had both sides of my family were
[11:09] with brother Branham from the early days
[11:16] and recently uh two weeks ago I was
[11:20] elected pastor of the Tucson Tabernacle
[11:22] um
[11:28] well I wanna I wanna tell them what I
[11:31] told you
[11:32] I got to be honest
[11:35] when he texts me I said
[11:38] I don't know whether to congratulate you
[11:44] but better I'll congratulate you
[11:48] because I believe that you're a man of
[11:51] God
[11:53] amen amen thank you for that brother
[11:56] I appreciate that in approaching this
[12:00] subject we approach we approach it with
[12:02] all humility
[12:04] it's not an easy subject many times uh
[12:08] to talk about it
[12:10] because there's there's such a back and
[12:14] forth going on with this uh throughout
[12:16] the whole world
[12:19] there there are many many questions
[12:22] concerning this in the ranks of the
[12:24] message
[12:30] should we then just listen to tapes or
[12:32] should we listen to the ministry
[12:36] and and I want to make this clear to to
[12:39] you that are here
[12:42] those that are on online via internet
[12:45] and those that will hear this later
[12:48] we're not here to try to take sides
[12:55] we're not here to try to pull you to one
[12:58] side or the other no Thomas
[13:00] I believe the prophet made it clear when
[13:03] he preached the message taking sides
[13:05] with Jesus
[13:08] and and and he Jesus is the word
[13:12] and so we understand that there's this
[13:15] big debates that go on
[13:20] we know through the years
[13:23] there are people can come up with a
[13:26] quote
[13:27] with the script
[13:36] but after a while we we come to a
[13:39] realization
[13:41] everything must line up from Genesis to
[13:45] Revelations
[13:47] or something is wrong
[13:52] so you know when when we when we look at
[13:55] this subject
[13:57] we realize this
[14:00] is that amidst it all
[14:03] can you still disagree with someone and
[14:07] still love them
[14:09] I I want to just just reiterate
[14:14] experience I had with the brother that
[14:17] that was trying to tell us that we
[14:18] should become a tape
[14:24] and I can tell you I bitterly disagreed
[14:27] with the brother
[15:13] that's many many times many people
[15:15] cannot do that yeah
[15:17] so when we as we approach this subject
[15:21] and I ask if you would turn your Bibles
[15:23] in your Bible
[15:24] First Corinthians
[15:27] the first chapter
[15:29] and the 12th and the 13th verse
[15:34] now reads like this and we're sorry that
[15:37] that our our overhead projector
[15:43] but that's all right
[15:45] we are not going to be stopped tonight
[15:48] First Corinthians 1 verse 12 and 13 says
[15:52] now this I say
[15:55] that every one of you saith
[15:58] I am of Paul
[16:00] and eye of Apollos and eye of cephas and
[16:04] I of Christ
[16:12] what a tremendous question the next
[16:14] verse is
[16:17] Christ divided
[16:21] we're talking about about
[16:24] the mystical body of the Lord Jesus
[16:26] Christ
[16:28] divided is
[16:30] that what we have come to in the message
[16:34] have we come to well you're on that side
[16:37] of the aisle or you're on that side of
[16:39] the aisle
[16:41] you come to the point really is
[16:44] Christ divided it is
[16:48] Paul crucified for you
[16:51] or were ye baptized in the name of Paul
[16:54] okay
[16:56] and that's the question we're asked
[16:58] today is Christ divided
[17:03] how do you think about that scripture
[17:08] well turn back one page
[17:12] and start with First Corinthians
[17:14] uh
[17:16] with the first verse
[17:19] now remember who's writing this letter
[17:23] this letter is written to a church
[17:26] that's having issues
[17:29] and Paul is going to address these
[17:32] issues in this letter
[17:34] is
[17:36] now remember Paul is a very educated man
[17:40] is a very very good writer as we already
[17:44] know yes
[17:46] and there are certain rules in writing
[17:48] that never change no matter what
[17:50] language that you're in yes
[17:54] if you study writing you know that there
[17:57] are these things called pronouns
[18:04] and pronouns are used to make the
[18:08] writing flow better to sound better yes
[18:14] so we use g in it we use those almost to
[18:19] make the conversation flow better
[18:20] conversation unless we're trying to make
[18:23] a point
[18:25] exception and then we will say the name
[18:29] over and over again
[18:32] to make a very specific point
[18:37] listen to what Paul wrote
[18:40] Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus
[18:43] Christ through the will of God and
[18:45] sustani is our brother
[18:51] unto the Church of God which is
[18:53] according to them that are Sanctified in
[18:56] Christ Jesus called to be Saints with
[18:59] all that in every place call upon the
[19:01] name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both those
[19:05] and ours
[19:06] is senor
[19:16] Grace be unto you and peace from God our
[19:19] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:26] I thank my God always on your behalf for
[19:29] the grace of God which is given by given
[19:31] you by Jesus Christ
[19:38] he's making a point declaration
[19:43] that in everything you are in enriched
[19:46] by Him in all utterance and in all
[19:48] knowledge
[19:53] even as the testimony of Christ was
[19:56] confirmed in you a secret
[20:00] so that ye come behind in no gift
[20:03] waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus
[20:06] Christ
[20:12] who shall also confirm you unto the end
[20:15] that ye may be blameless in the day of
[20:18] our Lord Jesus Christ
[20:25] God is faithful by whom you were called
[20:28] under Fellowship of his son Jesus Christ
[20:31] Our Lord
[20:36] now I beseech you Brethren by the name
[20:39] of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye speak
[20:42] the same thing and that there be no
[20:45] divisions among you but that ye be
[20:47] perfectly joined together in the same
[21:07] it had been declared under me of you my
[21:10] brethren by
[21:12] them which are the house of Chloe that
[21:15] there are contentions among you say
[21:18] foreign
[21:23] do you see how brother Paul laid the
[21:26] foundation that it is all about one man
[21:33] it's about Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ
[21:37] and then we mess it up
[21:40] and and we make it about the man
[21:44] right and then brother Caleb just read
[21:47] the scripture that he read and he and he
[21:49] addresses it
[21:54] this is the thing that we want to make
[21:56] sure that we get across
[22:00] we understand and realize
[22:03] there is no eighth messenger
[22:07] thing there's a lot of men that raise up
[22:10] and people raise them up
[22:13] and after a while
[22:15] a man
[22:18] they they they want to they want to put
[22:20] him in place of brother Brown
[22:23] we're here to tell you
[22:25] we believe there was only seven stars
[22:33] and we believe the messenger to our age
[22:36] foreign
[24:35] foreign we do understand that there are
[24:39] people that have been called to give out
[24:41] tracks
[24:45] videos CDs cities etc etc we've also
[24:51] done that
[24:52] but we do believe that God has called us
[24:57] in this day to preach the gospel okay
[25:01] you cannot separate the message from the
[25:03] messenger
[25:07] like you cannot separate and you you
[25:10] elevate the tree as our our pastor was
[25:12] saying a while ago
[25:15] and say what a great tree
[25:18] and deny the fruit
[25:21] or say what grapefruit
[25:24] but deny the tree
[25:26] but I want you to know that the fruit is
[25:30] the product of the tree
[25:32] we're not separate from from from what
[25:36] people think that that we try to
[25:37] separate ourselves
[25:41] all we say is that we are a product of
[25:44] the message
[25:47] was to produce
[25:50] there was no other time
[25:53] outside of this time were the sons of
[25:57] God were to be made
[25:59] and we are manifested Sons and Daughters
[26:05] by the message that brother William
[26:09] Miriam Branham brought to US foreign
[26:36] foreign
[27:11] and the question was how will you
[27:15] unlearn what you have learned
[27:23] think about that
[27:26] I said brother sister whoever wrote the
[27:28] question I'm not going to unlearn
[27:30] anything
[27:34] this this is the same message I was born
[27:37] listening to is
[27:39] I love it as much now as I ever had
[27:44] the difference is that God has called me
[27:47] into to a different office now
[27:51] and that is to preach this gospel yes
[27:54] so that's how I answered that question I
[27:56] know that good with you but yeah
[27:59] you know to to to let people know
[28:03] you know when when people get together
[28:07] to go against something else
[28:11] and their only agenda is
[28:15] the something else it's a false Unity
[28:19] it's not only that we didn't get
[28:21] together to put this table together no
[28:23] foreign
[29:12] and he would put his arm around and we
[29:14] know this about around the methodists
[29:19] and he'd always says they're my brothers
[29:23] you know and it's it's it's such a shame
[29:26] many times
[29:28] that if you don't if you don't if you
[29:31] don't go to church yeah
[29:35] and we flip it to the other side listen
[29:38] to tapes
[29:41] Christ is not divided
[29:44] I'm going to say it again Christ is
[29:48] very important that we that we that we
[29:50] that that should be the basis of
[29:52] everything that we are and all that we
[29:54] do
[29:56] and we know the message as it has come
[29:59] forth
[30:01] brother Henry you know this very well
[30:03] from our founding pastors
[30:05] and he would say if we cannot we we must
[30:09] make the message
[30:12] what it says it will do
[30:14] if everything else
[30:17] they say well brother Branham the
[30:20] messenger one
[30:21] and so the way that they view it brother
[30:25] Brandon passed on
[30:27] that would mean that the message also
[30:30] died also
[30:32] the message and the messenger are one
[30:34] and the same
[30:36] because now watch where that message is
[30:40] this is very important that we
[30:42] understand this is
[30:44] and and there's things that you'll hear
[30:46] over and over again
[30:48] but remember it is going out to
[30:51] different places
[30:54] and I will reiterate through the whole
[30:57] thing
[30:58] I talked to someone that just listens to
[31:00] tape
[31:02] they're my brothers I love them the same
[31:05] I don't look at them any less
[31:08] my brother is and I remember our
[31:11] founding pastors
[31:15] and he he made that that statement if
[31:19] you're called to hand out a track yes
[31:26] and then he says but I was called to
[31:30] preach the gospel
[31:31] I can't do anything else
[31:41] we see so many divisions and let me read
[31:44] to you a couple quotes from the prophet
[31:46] and they might have you raise your
[31:48] eyebrows when I read them
[31:54] we get things in our mind
[31:56] and we think we have an understanding
[32:00] but we have to be open to the word
[32:04] changing our thoughts
[32:10] in 1956
[32:15] Jehovah Jireh
[32:17] 5604-29 in
[32:19] the ram says he said Margaret now we are
[32:22] not here to argue somebody's theology
[32:27] whether they're Methodist or Baptist
[32:29] Baptist or Presbyterian
[32:32] okay we've all heard that
[32:37] or baptize this way
[32:41] or that way or sprinkles
[32:45] don't pay no attention to that
[32:49] I'm here to say that Christ has risen
[32:52] from the dead
[32:55] that's the main thing is and I hope it's
[32:59] not in vain
[33:01] can I read another one oh read it
[33:05] 53 1018
[33:09] Elijah Elias brother Brahm says this he
[33:12] said mono Branham you say well the
[33:14] method is sprinkle and we baptize so
[33:17] they says
[33:20] you ready
[33:22] that don't have nothing to do with it
[33:26] this isn't me speaking
[33:29] yeah this is the prophet yes
[33:33] the thing to do brother
[33:36] if in your heart you can't recognize
[33:39] that to be your brother
[33:42] you need a trip to God's altar to get
[33:45] right with them
[33:48] and I look at the prophet said that
[33:50] about the denominations
[33:53] all the way to baptism
[33:56] and how important baptism is to us
[33:59] we have the revelation of the godhead
[34:03] and we know that baptizing in the name
[34:06] of the father Son and the Holy Ghost is
[34:08] not baptizing in a name
[34:13] and yet the prophet himself
[34:18] and we divide ourselves over listening
[34:22] to a
[34:23] tables
[34:27] how far have we slipped back
[34:33] okay brother you go ahead no no that's
[34:36] good you know brother brother calebra
[34:38] you you mentioned it in a in a sermon
[34:42] when they when the when the the one is
[34:46] separated from the Trinity
[34:49] and and in that period and brother Brown
[34:52] says the problem was that they made an
[34:55] issue
[34:57] so
[34:59] once once one one we understand that the
[35:03] truth
[35:04] but but I think that what what we we
[35:06] have maybe not understood okay but in
[35:09] general because
[35:11] we're not non-denominational
[35:17] we are inter-denominational
[35:21] that's what brother Branham tells us
[35:24] because we've made things issues
[35:29] to the point that again authors won't
[35:33] talk to brothers
[35:35] because they've made issues of certain
[35:37] things
[35:38] because they said certain things are
[35:41] true
[35:42] once we make issues of it
[35:45] we make barriers
[35:49] and we can't go back and forth to each
[35:51] other
[35:54] remember that story where there was a
[35:56] brother
[35:58] he had given a a book of brother Branham
[36:01] to a certain man
[36:03] but remember when that man said I don't
[36:06] want this book
[36:07] because when I read it
[36:10] or it calls me a what is it
[36:29] you know what's and the reason I say
[36:31] that is
[36:32] because in the book of Second Kings the
[36:35] second chapter if you can turn to it
[36:38] this is talking about and and we
[36:40] understand the difference through the
[36:42] message of Elisha and Elijah
[36:47] Elijah and then you have Isha Elijah
[36:53] verse 13 he says he took
[36:55] up also the mantle of Elijah
[37:00] is
[37:02] that fell from him and I went back and
[37:06] stood by the bank of Jordan
[37:16] here's Elisha with the mantle of Elijah
[37:22] and it goes on in verse
[37:25] and he smites the waters
[37:28] and says where is the Lord God of Elijah
[37:32] I think about right now
[37:35] the Church of the Living God
[37:37] needs to take that mantle
[37:40] Smite the waters which is death
[37:43] because it's bringing a lot of death the
[37:45] way that people are on earth bring in a
[37:48] lot of death
[37:49] those that even claim the message
[37:52] but it's time that we say where is the
[37:55] god of Elijah
[37:57] where is the god of William Brands
[38:02] this is the point that I want you to get
[38:04] is that the very mental that means
[38:08] Elisha picked up or got from Elijah
[38:12] the very man the word man to there means
[38:16] responsibility
[38:18] responsibility now this is important
[38:21] because because brother Dan
[38:25] if somebody reads the message
[38:27] and they feel inspired to go do a
[38:30] certain things
[38:37] but when I read the message
[38:40] I don't know what it calls you you know
[38:44] but it tells me go and preach the gospel
[38:48] that's what I get out of it
[38:51] so in understanding this then
[38:54] I want to take the responsibility that
[38:57] the message has placed on me
[39:01] every individual individual should read
[39:04] the message and find out what the
[39:07] responsibility the the message the word
[39:10] of God puts on you
[39:13] want to know what what the
[39:15] responsibility
[39:16] responsibility when we see this
[39:19] responsibility
[39:20] you know it comes to this and I said
[39:24] this before foreign it's not how much
[39:27] responsibility we feel responsibility
[39:30] every True Believer
[39:33] every time you read the message
[39:36] of responses
[39:38] but the question now is this
[39:41] how much responsibility are we willing
[39:44] to take on I want the responsibility
[39:47] that's the question
[39:49] and so what do you get out when you read
[39:52] the message
[39:54] what does it do for you what is it
[39:57] prescribe you what passion
[40:00] that's a mystery each one of you must
[40:04] come to that
[40:05] but when we see this to understand the
[40:09] responsibility responsibility you know
[40:12] it it takes us to this
[40:14] because sometimes they they'll they'll
[40:17] use the phrase us tape church
[40:20] not against anyone that has it no
[40:22] Australia
[40:24] but when I look at this
[40:29] and I and I read the conduct order and
[40:34] it lays out the plan for us
[40:38] and it shows that there has to be
[40:41] holy ghost-filled men
[40:45] to fill the offices in the church
[40:48] how can a tape fill in office
[40:55] it shows you the requirements
[40:58] what you must do to be able to fill
[41:01] those different offices
[41:03] but there's got to be a holy
[41:06] ghost-filled people
[41:08] that will take God out of his words
[41:11] and come to their office
[41:14] fill that office
[41:20] Eternal sonship
[41:22] those two words don't go together
[41:35] when our lord Jesus was here
[41:38] he was teaching his disciples
[41:41] disciplos and he went to the place this
[41:43] pool of Bethesda
[41:46] Bethesda and he healed this this man
[41:48] that couldn't get into the water you
[41:50] know the story
[41:52] and he raised the dead he raised Lazarus
[41:55] from the dead
[41:56] he did many mighty Works Jesus did Jesus
[42:01] but there was one issue
[42:04] the people had to get to that man
[42:10] the flesh there was only one
[42:14] they had to get to Jesus and and he had
[42:17] to heal them
[42:20] but then we see in the book of Acts we
[42:23] see when the Holy Spirit came down
[42:27] in that same spirit that was in Christ
[42:30] entered into men okay
[42:35] that they went out and they did the
[42:38] exact same thing that Jesus did
[42:42] Jesus the gay called Beautiful he did
[42:45] Peter and John did this exact same thing
[42:47] that Jesus did
[42:53] Paul raised eunuchs from the dead when
[42:55] he fell from the rafters and died
[43:01] example after example after example of
[43:03] how the disciples did the same thing
[43:06] that Jesus did
[43:09] you see the scripture
[43:12] just got this
[43:14] you see the scripture at the beginning
[43:18] I am a
[43:22] Palace
[43:26] I am of Christ
[43:29] We only listen to Jesus because because
[43:32] in just what he said back there we don't
[43:34] want to listen to his disciples
[43:38] and the disciples were preaching the
[43:40] same thing that Jesus
[43:44] Spirit was upon them
[43:48] and if we deny that
[43:51] as they did here in First Corinthians
[43:54] it divides the body
[43:57] so that same spirit that was on Christ
[43:59] Came Upon most people it means
[44:03] and I want that same relationship that
[44:06] brother Branham had with Jesus
[44:10] Jesus and I want those same gifts to
[44:13] operate in the church that brother
[44:15] Branham showed us
[44:19] for the people's sake so that they may
[44:22] be here so that they may give their
[44:25] hearts
[44:29] you know everybody believes the visions
[44:32] of brother Branham
[44:34] feel it comes the time to do something
[44:37] about it
[44:39] everybody talks about
[44:42] the great visions that he has
[44:46] such wonderful where are you going to
[44:48] find Visions
[44:51] but when brother Branham does this
[44:54] he says now we're going to start off
[44:57] with the early church
[44:59] and just bring it for about five minutes
[45:02] down to what they did
[45:05] and then I can show you the vision
[45:09] that I
[45:11] that just let me interrupt you they're
[45:13] coming into a little bit I just want to
[45:15] make sure that they got this
[45:17] we're gonna go and uh we'll start off
[45:20] with the early church
[45:23] start off with the earlier
[45:26] and uh down to see what they did
[45:29] and then in ton says I can show you
[45:34] it's the early church
[45:36] okay go ahead
[45:40] wow how God works
[45:43] then I can show you the vision
[45:47] sure
[45:49] that I have for the future
[45:53] from the early church from the early
[45:55] church
[46:01] now at the beginning the church was
[46:03] inaugurated at Pentecost
[46:06] and they're the Holy Spirit fell upon
[46:11] them
[46:14] where Jesus had chosen 12.
[46:18] this is his vision or the future
[46:22] and what does he start telling us
[46:26] and there the Holy Spirit fell upon them
[46:29] where Jesus had chosen 12.
[46:35] this is what people is and especially
[46:40] maybe maybe people that claim the
[46:42] message
[46:44] this is the work where they get stuck at
[46:47] this is the vision of the future
[46:51] in the message taking sides with Jesus
[46:56] you know we went to to Norway this last
[46:59] year
[47:00] and and we were privileged by God
[47:03] you plant a church
[47:06] as we did it according to the plan and
[47:09] the offices that that brother Branham
[47:12] speaks
[47:15] one of the brothers says
[47:18] Nobody Does it like that
[47:21] and maybe maybe in the majority of
[47:24] message churches they don't do it
[47:28] that is immaterial from the early church
[47:38] and if people don't do it the way
[47:40] brother Branham laid it out
[47:44] well that's up to them but don't hinder
[47:48] US foreign
[47:58] foreign
[49:32] because when the Revelation that the
[49:35] seventh angel brought
[49:37] and he begins to to tell us about this
[49:41] Throne of God
[49:43] the throne started in heaven
[49:45] they came down to Jesus Christ
[49:48] from Jesus Christ he says now it has
[49:51] come into the heart of man
[49:55] in this this series of the Revelation
[50:01] so plainly you know this is how he sets
[50:05] up the Tabernacle
[50:07] and how there were guards there was
[50:10] three three uh tribes on each side
[50:14] but when he comes and he brings it to
[50:16] the New Testament
[50:19] what is
[50:28] El Toronto
[50:31] is this this is
[50:33] importante why it is so important to
[50:36] follow God's plan
[50:39] the vision that he had for the future
[50:43] the message
[50:45] the vision he had for the future
[50:48] is not future anymore
[50:51] the future is already has become the
[50:54] president
[50:56] now you want to add something there
[50:58] brother back to what I said brother
[51:01] braham's vision of the future
[51:04] brother Brandon brought a message
[51:08] Jesus brought a message
[51:10] and Jesus when the Holy Spirit came into
[51:14] the disciples the same spirit that was
[51:16] on Jesus was on them
[51:21] then and only then was it able to go
[51:23] around the world and
[51:27] know
[51:28] we send tapes around the world brother
[51:30] Branham said that you can't visit every
[51:32] country but you can sense
[51:38] but don't use that quote to say that we
[51:41] shouldn't preach the gospel
[51:44] let me read you a quote
[51:48] by the way what we're talking about
[51:50] today
[51:52] it's not new
[51:55] this question was way back in 1964.
[52:02] in fact it was August the 30th
[52:08] listen to this our question is that
[52:11] we're talking about today
[52:13] is it the tape Ministry is or is it the
[52:17] five-fold ministerial
[52:20] that perfects the bride the Perfection
[52:22] questions and answers
[52:24] brother Adams reading the question he
[52:27] says this is beloved
[52:31] about the scripture of Ephesians 4 11
[52:33] through 13.
[52:36] [Music]
[52:39] let's see do we all get the perfecting
[52:42] of the Saints through the tapes
[52:46] or should we be here where the gifts of
[52:49] the Spirit are operating in different
[52:50] offices of the church
[52:57] same question
[53:01] and whoever wrote it says our hearts
[53:03] have believed all the word of the Lord
[53:08] Brother Branham tells tells he the names
[53:11] on the on the question
[53:13] and he tells who wrote the question
[53:16] and then he answers so the question is
[53:20] is it the tapes that perfect the bride
[53:22] or is it the five-fold ministry
[53:28] no no
[53:31] foreign
[53:33] thank the Lord he explains a little
[53:35] further
[53:37] they want to come to the church
[53:41] for the perfecting
[53:45] that we get Fellowship one with another
[53:48] here at church
[53:51] but the perfecting comes between us and
[53:55] God
[53:57] the blood of Christ is what perfects Us
[54:01] in the Holy Spirit
[54:04] in that question is
[54:11] [Applause]
[54:20] the other question that it then is asked
[54:23] would the bride of Christ have a
[54:25] Ministry before the Rapture
[54:29] before the Rapture Hunters
[54:34] before the Raptors
[54:37] before before the Rapture brother Brahms
[54:42] just simply says sure
[54:44] that's what's going on right now
[54:47] the bride of Christ
[54:50] certainly it is the message of the hour
[54:56] see the bride of Christ
[54:58] certainly it is the message of the hours
[55:03] the bride of Christ what is the message
[55:06] of the hours the bride of Christ it is
[55:10] the message of the hours
[55:12] the bride of Christ
[55:15] is consist of Apostles
[55:18] prophets prophetas teachers maestros
[55:22] evangelists
[55:24] is that right correct that's the bride
[55:27] of Christ
[55:32] the ministry of the hour the problem is
[55:36] the problem is is where those that
[55:38] believe in a five-fold get off
[55:43] because now they think they don't need
[55:45] no one else
[55:47] and they began to raise each other up
[55:51] and the next thing you know it our
[55:54] ministry in this church is better than
[55:55] the ministry and that church over there
[55:59] we're the only ones that have a fightful
[56:02] Ministries
[56:04] do you go to everybody else's church or
[56:07] what you still body glitter okay
[56:11] do you know what goes on in in in other
[56:13] churches
[56:16] God has been gracious
[56:19] absolutely
[56:22] think that we're the only ones
[56:26] there should always brother Brandon
[56:29] brother Daniel everyone should listen to
[56:32] that message over and over again
[56:36] respects respect us
[56:56] respect the law
[56:58] even if you disagree with him God bless
[57:02] him because he's trying to do something
[57:04] for them
[57:10] this is why it's so hard
[57:13] because there's many people that preach
[57:16] that have no business
[57:22] there are many that try to fill in
[57:25] office in the church
[57:27] do not do not fulfill the requirements
[57:33] that's what gets us in trouble
[57:35] when we get off the word
[57:38] out of the vision
[57:41] this is the vision for the future
[57:47] this is uh what we what we have said yes
[57:50] when we have heard
[57:54] the ministry of the hour it will be so
[58:15] this is what when people might say that
[58:20] Ephesians 4 11 and 12 has Faith
[58:24] that's why we went back to the tape
[58:28] and my our response is this
[58:31] that there are people that men that have
[58:35] failed
[58:37] yes
[58:41] God would even allow a man to fail so
[58:44] you get your eyes off the man
[58:50] and God will allow that as you heard our
[58:52] password
[58:54] but remember
[58:56] that the word of God is eternal
[58:59] and the word of God doesn't failure
[59:02] and so we we understand
[59:05] that the word of God that God has given
[59:07] to us
[59:08] when they say Ephesians
[59:12] this word of God that we preach
[59:15] here in this scriptures is the Eternal
[59:19] Word of God
[59:20] the thoughts of God printed
[59:24] but there are men that have failed
[59:27] say God will even permit that man
[59:32] brother Daniel in our first campaign
[59:38] and and you said
[59:40] me and brother Caleb looked at each
[59:42] other
[59:43] at the same time
[59:45] can can you can can you tell us about
[59:48] that that incident when
[59:58] how many have heard in listening to
[1:00:01] tapes how many have heard brother
[1:00:02] Branham say that these tapes are
[1:00:04] translated and sent around the world
[1:00:11] you've heard him say that
[1:00:17] um
[1:00:21] he spoke as a prophet spoke
[1:00:26] which means he may be prophesying but
[1:00:30] speaking he may be speaking in present
[1:00:32] tense but he's actually prophesying
[1:00:34] something that will happen years from
[1:00:36] now
[1:00:40] Isaiah did that when he said a virgin
[1:00:43] shall conceive is
[1:00:46] the city was under attack
[1:00:49] and he was under siege and he was
[1:00:52] talking to the king
[1:00:55] the king says you seek for a
[1:00:59] signal and Isaiah says behold the Lord
[1:01:02] will send you a sign
[1:01:07] so he and it didn't happen for 700 years
[1:01:12] so we've heard brother Branham say that
[1:01:15] these tapes are translated into so many
[1:01:16] different languages and sitting around
[1:01:17] the world
[1:01:22] when I worked the voice of God I worked
[1:01:24] with a man named he just passed away uh
[1:01:28] brother Jim the tape boy
[1:01:31] brother Jim what's his last name brother
[1:01:33] Jim McGuire
[1:01:37] McGuire brother random called him the
[1:01:39] tape boy
[1:01:42] he was the one that was making the tapes
[1:01:44] while brother Brandon was preaching
[1:01:48] so I'm listening to these sermons and
[1:01:51] I'm thinking brother Branham is sending
[1:01:52] these tapes all over the world
[1:01:57] and they're being translated and they're
[1:01:59] going to South Africa and all these
[1:02:01] other places
[1:02:04] so I asked for the gym
[1:02:06] I said how many tapes did you send
[1:02:09] overseas Ultramar
[1:02:13] he said
[1:02:14] I remember sending a package to Germany
[1:02:20] and I remember sending a few tapes to
[1:02:24] South Africa Africa
[1:02:28] I said that's it
[1:02:30] he says yeah I don't remember sending
[1:02:32] anymore
[1:02:33] I said how many were being translated
[1:02:37] he said oh none of them we never
[1:02:39] translated anything
[1:02:43] today oi we are seeing what the prophet
[1:02:47] spoke come to pass
[1:02:50] today we are seeing these translations
[1:02:52] go foreign
[1:03:23] and
[1:03:25] brother Brandon's Vision comes to pass
[1:03:29] the acholi people they think
[1:03:34] friends they thank the Lord all over the
[1:03:37] world I've been to many different places
[1:03:41] let me tell you they love brother
[1:03:43] branham's message as much as we do yes
[1:03:48] and we have all had a part including
[1:03:51] that message
[1:03:53] and I'm grateful anybody that comes
[1:03:56] against the Tate Ministry
[1:03:59] you're coming against something that is
[1:04:01] dear to my heart
[1:04:05] I have seen with my own eyes amen
[1:04:14] why it's very important to find your
[1:04:16] place in the body
[1:04:19] another question
[1:04:23] 1963.
[1:04:28] should evangelists continue on the field
[1:04:32] so when we ask when we hear that
[1:04:34] question well
[1:04:38] that goes to the Evangelista
[1:04:41] the Bible says are all Apostles
[1:04:45] so if you're not called to be an
[1:04:50] Evangelista he says in this hour
[1:04:53] of course
[1:04:56] certainly by all means
[1:05:00] don't change a thing
[1:05:03] this is the questions and answers on the
[1:05:05] sales
[1:05:06] change a thing
[1:05:09] Jesus is coming in the morning
[1:05:11] Preach Today like if it was going to be
[1:05:14] 10 years from today
[1:05:17] but live like it's gonna be at this hour
[1:05:22] it says don't get scrupled up now
[1:05:25] I think that's our problem today
[1:05:29] so many of us have gone scrupled up
[1:05:33] don't look at anyone else
[1:05:36] because we within our own selves
[1:05:39] oh
[1:05:41] yeah well we don't believe in that
[1:05:44] he said who said we don't believe in
[1:05:46] that candy okay I believe there is a
[1:05:48] Ministry
[1:05:49] it tapes around the world
[1:05:54] do it with all your heart foreign
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:48] no
[1:07:11] brother Neville another man and many
[1:07:14] different Brothers
[1:07:16] but he's saying don't change nothing
[1:07:21] but if you're doing something wrong
[1:07:24] or doing evil
[1:07:27] repentance
[1:07:29] come back to God
[1:07:31] and continue on your evangelist
[1:07:34] Evangelistic Service
[1:07:37] as you always did
[1:07:40] and then he says just keep on he says
[1:07:44] see continue as you are then he says
[1:07:47] everybody understands
[1:07:49] everybody understands we are not against
[1:07:53] anyone else
[1:07:55] God bless them
[1:07:57] and I mean that from our hearts as the
[1:08:01] pastor of this church I want the church
[1:08:04] to know
[1:08:05] don't change a thing
[1:08:08] what our Prophet the example that he
[1:08:11] left
[1:08:13] add something there to that or either
[1:08:15] one of you
[1:08:17] let me just add a little bit you said
[1:08:20] don't change a thing
[1:08:28] to pull the ministry out of the message
[1:08:34] you have to change what brother Branham
[1:08:36] says
[1:08:37] you have to take out things that brother
[1:08:41] Branham said about preaching the gospels
[1:08:45] and as we said brother Brown's message
[1:08:48] is perfect
[1:08:51] I believe it was exactly what God wanted
[1:08:54] to say
[1:08:56] and to take out preaching the gospel you
[1:09:00] have to take out things that brother
[1:09:02] Brian
[1:09:06] brother Brandon brought the message and
[1:09:09] then he gave it to be preached
[1:09:14] that's a sore spot
[1:09:17] let me read your quote
[1:09:20] this one is uh and this is right before
[1:09:23] brother Brown passed away
[1:09:26] 65 11 21 what house will you build me in
[1:09:30] November
[1:09:33] to think that only brother Branham could
[1:09:36] preach the message let me let me tell
[1:09:38] you what brother Branham says
[1:09:42] speaking of brother Perry green pastor
[1:09:44] of the Tucson Tabernacle London
[1:09:47] but the green preaches the same thing
[1:09:50] and same message that I believe in
[1:09:57] hey
[1:09:59] he is left talking about your church yes
[1:10:02] sir
[1:10:02] all right making sure funny you should
[1:10:06] say that yeah yeah yeah okay go ahead
[1:10:09] he has left his home he left his people
[1:10:12] he left his church
[1:10:14] he left his home he left his people he
[1:10:16] left his church
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:19] he was I believe he was a district
[1:10:21] superintendent or something
[1:10:24] one of them organizations and he give
[1:10:27] the whole thing up
[1:10:30] you gave the whole thing up when he
[1:10:32] heard this
[1:10:33] he left everything that was dear to him
[1:10:36] also to come to the desert
[1:10:41] just to support what God is giving to us
[1:10:44] now
[1:10:47] now I listen to what the prophet says
[1:10:51] about a pastor pastor
[1:10:55] I say I believe it's not only should be
[1:10:59] in our hearts
[1:11:02] it should be our duty to back him up
[1:11:07] everything that we can
[1:11:12] to attend the services
[1:11:17] to come here to worship
[1:11:20] and to make this place a place where God
[1:11:24] can reveal to us the things that he has
[1:11:27] for us
[1:11:32] one of many quotes that brother Branham
[1:11:35] said that these brothers preached the
[1:11:37] same message I do muchas
[1:11:42] why do I have to throw that part out of
[1:11:45] the message
[1:11:49] we shouldn't no evidence
[1:11:53] right
[1:11:55] you know the Apostle Paul believed in so
[1:11:57] much what
[1:12:01] he had instructed the people what God
[1:12:03] had showed him
[1:12:06] and he held it to to what he he was had
[1:12:10] been revealed so much
[1:12:13] that he even included himself when he
[1:12:16] made these words
[1:12:21] or an angel from heaven
[1:12:23] preach any other gospel and what we have
[1:12:27] preached
[1:12:28] let him be a curse
[1:12:33] there cannot come he cannot come and say
[1:12:35] one thing
[1:12:36] and then and and then we say we say
[1:12:41] something else
[1:12:43] but we understand through the scripture
[1:12:46] and through what brother Branham says
[1:12:49] he says now God fortified his army
[1:12:55] himself
[1:12:57] in the form of profits
[1:13:00] Apostles apostolis teachers maestros
[1:13:03] pastors pastors what did he do what was
[1:13:07] God doing
[1:13:08] listen did you ever
[1:13:11] what that offices of the church
[1:13:16] it's God's dress yes
[1:13:21] inside dress
[1:13:27] for seeing it before
[1:13:30] satanas ever gets to it yo
[1:14:25] to an office holder
[1:14:31] let me put you on the spot
[1:14:34] office holders
[1:14:35] it goes on first apostles
[1:14:41] they are gods for ordinations
[1:14:47] by predestination
[1:14:51] by foreign
[1:15:26] Cinco
[1:16:24] who wanted to preach I wasn't there I
[1:16:27] don't know you know
[1:16:29] but people sat around
[1:16:31] everything seemed to be dead
[1:16:39] I'm gonna say it again until last time
[1:16:44] somebody arose
[1:16:46] somebody began to wake up
[1:16:50] a star exploded
[1:16:53] and then another star is and the first
[1:16:56] thing to explode
[1:16:58] wasn't pastors
[1:17:00] first thing that explodes
[1:17:05] and then prophets teachers
[1:17:10] yeah they it exploded what was it
[1:17:14] putting forth
[1:17:16] it was the same he says as in the
[1:17:19] beginning when the Earth was in chaos
[1:17:23] it was in the darkness and it began to
[1:17:27] explode
[1:17:28] and the sun came out and the moon came
[1:17:32] out and the stars came out
[1:17:35] same thing happening in our time
[1:17:40] can you give one to the Lord Jesus what
[1:17:44] a tremendous thing
[1:17:46] I love
[1:17:49] brother Daniel go ahead and take it you
[1:17:52] I'm sure you have a lot of things that
[1:17:54] you can you can yeah
[1:17:56] friends it makes me so sad Amigos to see
[1:18:00] the division that comes into the
[1:18:02] churches
[1:18:04] to see churches split and divide over
[1:18:07] these things
[1:18:10] I do not believe that it pleases the
[1:18:12] Lord
[1:18:15] brother um brother Caleb just said he
[1:18:18] says what was produced from the rocket
[1:18:23] and we have to look at the fruit of
[1:18:26] things
[1:18:27] and when a spirit comes in and it's a
[1:18:31] divisive spirit
[1:18:35] I don't believe that it's from God
[1:18:38] when that Spirit comes in and tries to
[1:18:41] divide our churches
[1:18:44] I don't feel that that divisive spirit
[1:18:48] is from God this is not his way
[1:18:52] the prophet spoke he said come out of
[1:18:55] the denomination
[1:18:57] but then he said don't leave
[1:19:01] don't leave your church he said he said
[1:19:05] come out of the denominations that
[1:19:07] church can't save you
[1:19:10] he said if you are counting on the
[1:19:14] church to save you you are lost
[1:19:19] and it's the same thing for us if we're
[1:19:21] counting on a a Doctrine to save us is
[1:19:27] we're going to find it's gonna be a
[1:19:30] great disappointment at the end
[1:19:33] we should be together
[1:19:36] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:40] was with his disciples
[1:19:42] coming down from the Last Supper
[1:19:46] he gets down into the valley right
[1:19:49] before the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:19:52] and he prays and he said Lord may they
[1:19:57] be one as we are good
[1:20:03] I know the word I study the word every
[1:20:05] day
[1:20:06] it's very hard for me to separate the
[1:20:10] father from the Son
[1:20:13] and yet he prayed that they would be one
[1:20:17] as he and the father
[1:20:22] if we see a division come into the
[1:20:24] church
[1:20:28] it can't be right
[1:20:30] it can't be friends he wants us together
[1:20:34] United
[1:20:37] amen let me read a quote here from the
[1:20:41] prophet and trying to do God a service
[1:20:42] without it being said
[1:20:48] foreign we see a lot of people when they
[1:20:51] when they divide they leave the church
[1:20:53] and they don't come back
[1:20:58] people think that I don't even believe
[1:21:00] in people going to church
[1:21:05] that's a million miles from the truth
[1:21:10] we must assemble ourselves together and
[1:21:13] that much more as we see the day
[1:21:14] approaching
[1:21:18] see we must come together in unity
[1:21:24] if I lived in a city and they had
[1:21:27] nothing there but a well-some church
[1:21:32] I don't want to call any name
[1:21:35] but just any church
[1:21:38] if they only believed one thing
[1:21:43] that is that was Jesus that Jesus was
[1:21:47] divine
[1:21:49] all the rest of us wrong
[1:21:53] I'd go to that church
[1:21:57] if I can't get a whole loaf of bread
[1:21:59] I'll take a slice
[1:22:05] I'll go listen Worship the Lord
[1:22:10] and show him that I'm doing my part
[1:22:16] I want him to know
[1:22:19] I'm alive
[1:22:22] thank you
[1:22:23] I want everybody to know what side I'm
[1:22:26] on
[1:22:28] I assemble with the Christians
[1:22:32] and their worship and serve the Lord
[1:22:36] when we don't go to this is me speaking
[1:22:40] when we don't go to church we may be
[1:22:43] able to get fed at home by the tapes
[1:22:46] but it's not all about me
[1:22:49] it's not all about you
[1:22:52] when you don't come to church you remove
[1:22:56] a gift from the church
[1:23:04] someone other than yourself
[1:23:07] amen amen amen I believe that's what the
[1:23:10] prophet comes
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:15] a little
[1:23:22] yeah we'll wrap it up
[1:23:25] I'd like to close with or or on my
[1:23:28] segment with you'll get us with our what
[1:23:31] our pastor gave us for the theme of this
[1:23:35] of this week
[1:23:38] you just put one or two good members in
[1:23:41] the church
[1:23:44] that's really on fire for God
[1:23:47] it'll do something for that church
[1:23:51] more than 40 revivals you could have um
[1:23:56] correct a good clans member
[1:24:00] is that an example
[1:24:03] with a with uh the face shining with the
[1:24:07] Glorious
[1:24:09] with sweetness and humility
[1:24:12] to stand there in the power of God
[1:24:16] and watch when somebody gets sick
[1:24:20] they'll call that person to come pray
[1:24:38] but let death strike you one time
[1:24:43] you'll find out when them struggles
[1:24:47] began to come
