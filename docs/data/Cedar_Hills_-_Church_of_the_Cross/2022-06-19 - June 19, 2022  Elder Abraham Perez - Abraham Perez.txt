ministry how they progress all through these years where is my friend carlos but i remember when they hit him with the kids in in sunday school but look where he is now and not only him also now he almost has catch me he is going to have as much grandchildren as i am saint john 4 19 san juan cuatro yes the woman said unto him sir i proceeded thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped on this mountain and you say that in jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship in jerusalem jesus said unto her woman believe me the here he goes the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet in jerusalem worship the we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews here he says it again but the hour cometh and now is when the true worship worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father happy father's day seek as such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship we must worship him in spirit and in truth is necessary the woman said unto him i know that messiah cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all these things jesus said unto her i saint john 5 25 san juan cinco de vinticinco vero vero lis i say unto you here it is again the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they they hear shall leave yeah and you need to know what that and you say well we're waiting for the coming of the lord he already came in you didn't know that he said and those that are in the grave shall hear the voice when did you hear the voice of the messiah you heard the voice when you were in the grave yes we're gonna find out and to come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation a resurrection she said when messiah cometh he will declare all things to us jesus said i who speak to you am not even in this mountain or in jerusalem will you worship the father in jerusalem but the hour is coming when jesus was here one of jesus he prophesied the prophet he preached he did miracles and the scriptures identified him and the people rejected him so he preached then after they rejected him because he when he was preaching there was a possibility of anybody being saved but after the days of his preaching his [Applause] now judgment isn't going on right now because there is no burning hell okay [Music] now either you wait through hell here espera a don't you live in hell here no vive it's nothing but hell out there fires have seen are all around us and the natural times the spiritual natural typical spiritual you have never seen so many forest fires in your life the fires in new mexico los and nova mexico they say they are as big as the whole state of rhode island rhode island so why are there so many forest fires porque tantos incendios i went i called my daughter in phoenix in phoenix i said i don't go i don't have to go to phoenix to stand all that hit like you have in phoenix but support go to phoenix and i'm already in there the heat there was a man in phoenix and phoenix he said i'm not gonna waste electricity or natural gas to do my cooking his eggs and he's sausage and he cooked his nose very wise man amen so then that is a place of torment and since the devil rules all the world so it's hell up here but sometimes we act so holy and pious actor you said i have the holy ghost well let me ask you the question did the apostle do you have the spirit of the father because an hour is coming i wish i had the time to go into what i'm going to say here but i don't have that time today you know but hopefully next time i can go into it do you know that the law is spiritual spiritual paul said i find the law encuentro that when i will do good evil is everyone sitting here every day you have an evil thought you don't plan it is satan putting obstacles in front of you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen that's the job of saying is the job of satan and brother says this late hour it is you are going to be troubled by a carnal nature in problems that is going to bother you every day until you die so there's a carnal nature in you are you ayuna naturalessa de carne you know why there is a carnal nature in you because when the serpent came out of that of their water a wounded serpent is the most dangerous animal he's all around us he's here when we come to church and because that's what gives the carnal nature i ask the question do all of you have a guardian angel to guard you those who stand how can you have a guardian angel a sinner does not have a guardian angel because the angels of god los angeles around those that fear him so if you don't have a guardian angel i beg you to repent the speedo how many times were on the road and if it wasn't for a guardian angel republic hit somebody head-on i gotta confess something a confession you know years ago maybe about seven eight years ago you know what ronnie i was going up a one-way street there was a red light coming on a one-way street you know there one way this way and one way the other way you know i was going yo eva and thank god there was a the little the sidewalk i would turn around on the sidewalk and up there too for there was an office of i don't know what graciasmus god taking care of my ignorance ignorance you know i guess i had must have blacked out something you know i was working in the open pit in el camino and you know you many drivers on the holly trucks have gone down those berms and killed themselves i it was in the dead of it was so hard and the motors of those trucks are so big and those trucks didn't have ac i was about this close to the burn out of hidden [Music] you [Music] turn the tv on maybe change the channels when i sing at home even the cockroaches get scared god bless you yes but the lord gave me something greater the lord gave me something greater than any instrument you pray for me amen let's amen on going you know that your body is seen don't try to perfect your body no perfection so when you're born you are a sinner by nature and the sinner has to stand judgmental and christ stood god's judgment or not you are free from judgment esta libre de juicio because if god will look down on this earth in his condition now or any other way then [Applause] i don't care in what condition some of you are no important condition if you are doing your thing if you are in drugs if you like liquor it is and you only come to church whenever you feel like it is the mercies of god let us record yes there for you the mercies of god last missed recordings that we will still a tone for your sins hope i hope that you give your life to christ today you will have to give an account some of you know baby you have to give an account today search i'm not saying that god said that maybe if it be so that today is your day of reckoning how do you know that you'll be here on this earth tomorrow you don't know about tomorrow we only know who holds tomorrow but the minute your soul leaves your body you have passed over mercy into judgment first timothy 3 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received off into glory in description can you see that godliness is a mystery revelation 10 7. apocalypse siete but in the days of the voice of the seven angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants of prophets should there be any mysteries amongst this congregation you had the best teacher of this message where would you hit the founding pastor was hitting on all eight cylinders and you hear the teachings that come behind here you'll see these young ministers on the panel the way they minister estus ministers what mysteries let me tell you romans 16 25. romano's he says benticinco not to him there is a power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world begins there is no excuse but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandments on the everlasting god made known to all of you for the obedience of the revelation of faith it's a previous previously hidden truth now divinely revealed with a supernatural element [Music] in christ so that he could clean the church in order to get it into for fellowship because he dwelt along along with the cherubim's cherubims you and i were in his thinking in the beginning and the only thing we are is an expression word you become a son or daughter notice in the beginning was the word but before it was word it was attributed in the beginning was the expression in the principle expression the word so those that worship god must worship him this was a state when abraham met melchizedek he was in the form of theophany in the form of something that you could not see the angels of god are here los angeles he is here in the form of spirit in the form of the spirit and then he comes in the form of morphine he will tell us all things declaration i am he who talks to you if this earthly body be dissolved he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end will absolutely do the same thing absolutely now we see the air tributes the sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word waiting for the earnest change of the body esperando por las arras el cambio del cuerpo now the difference between him and you as a son the difference he was at the beginning the word el estaban el principio la palabra in morphe he came and lived in the person of melchizedek [Applause] because in that form it is a form he knowed all things elsa and you have never been able to know that yet because you come just like adam [Applause] but you see in order to stem temptation we have not yet the bodies but when this body receives the spirit of god receiving the spiritual the immortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to god first john 3 9. whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god how can you sing i plant the seed in you and then we see these wonderful preachers that we have which i could preach like them [Music] romans 8 1 romanos ocho uno there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who will walk as not after the flesh but after the spirit [Applause] all ready started the people are waiting for the rapture el pueblos i've been in the rapture since i accepted this message and they say well that's jesus christ to the souls those that are in the grave are not the ones that are dead the ones that are there that are walking and when you go to walmart or to target you walk among them those are the deaths but the hour comes [Applause] i heard foreign and you know what the voice of archangel is they first used to say that it was jesus christ i mean you people are not so nice you know you cannot take jesus christ off the it was jesus william branham and then in the condensation again because brother venom did not come to you so you never can take jesus christ especially if he lives in your heart a place aaron for my father happy father's day jimmy you you started like that and and all of a sudden you wanna go that way the world is so rich and what god gives me i love to give to you people so then the rapture is here do you know that when elijah was picked up in the chariot elisha said because elijah said what do you want elijah fell he took that cloak went to the river jordan and he took it and he threw it on the water of thomas perez man god was not only god of william branham god was not only god william branham god was not the only the amen amen the earnest of the resurrection resurrection what is it yes this body will be raised again because it already started in the flesh first corinthians 15 45. and we'll turn the corner here so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made of quickening spirit acetaminophen which is spiritual but that which is natural and after that that which is spiritual maslow spiritual es primeros spiritual the first man is of the earth earthly the second man is the lord from heaven is the heavenly such are they also there are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earth we shall also bear the image of the heavenly yes let's find out so aaron became a living soul so what happened god who formed the heavens and the earth [Music] and everything took its right position what do you think when the pastor gets behind here sufficiently everything came in its right position the earth the moon the luna the stars planets all swung into their place because your spirit is in your heart and you had your spirit before you ever came to this world and they they take the scripture from genesis too you know what kind of breath was he breathing respirato before that god breathed this breath of life into him if that be so see then every animal is a living soul animal because they breathe a human soul then jesus would not have to die jesus because the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient now animals breathe the wind los angeles which still love the things of the world then you are not a living soul you are breathing what the devil is the breath of eternal life and he became a living soul a soul that cannot die well you see if god had provided a lamb to redeem him god had to provide the lamb because already in his nostrils jesus never preached a funeral jesus but an hour is coming on this mountain or this city well you say that was for them and i said it was for you foreign the the man that was possessed by legion the gathering says he would hide behind the tombstones the tombstones so don't exo holy empires all of you and you blame only the man with the head the legion oh when i was a young guy and i like i'm confessing and i liked a girl gustavo muchacha and most girls were catholic so they invited me to church i wouldn't go to see jesus i go to see mary untruthful so then as then you you you i start going to the tombstone that said baptist bautista i would hide behind the baptist tombstone and finally i went and hid behind the apostolic tombstone apostolica the invaluable says all those denominations are dead and should be buried then when the ceremonies and the is nothing but blasphemous names he says they are churches with their their doctrines are without foundation amen now why seek the living amongst the dead now the breath of life and respiratory that adam received is different it's different than when a baby is born let's see which one are you a young girl why did the spirit of adam was different to when a baby is born when a baby is born is he not a living [Music] and then he breathed the breath the and he became a living song have you ever thought why a baby that is born he is not a living soul yeah only the sin of his father because when when the baby's in the womb of the mother it's only begotten it's only begun so as as a christian as we get older christians they say that you are what you eat but it should be you supposed to eat what you are saying so you to eat a diet comparable with your blood type so you can see that the animals are more intelligent than us animals how many lions do we have in this congregation congregation don't raise your hand chuck no levantes don't raise your hand roster carlos carlos i know in my house my daughter there's no meat there's no food in the house you say in me in la casa she takes after my mother and how many you you gotta have meet uh so i can see we have a lot of lions and lionesses in this congregation there's me that's fine if there's not that's fine i'll eat what there is that's my what my wife used to say to some of these sisters that's why i love my husband whatever i put on the table i if i was your wife i left you silly you tried to fit an apple or a carrot to the lion a leon he won't need it other animals buying sting otros animals for instinct will not eat meat no comedy humans including los humanos the problem is the problem is he is a problem you humans said humans are so domesticated domesticated it solo comment what is instantly good for them listen to me is a result the animals don't go to the hospital for diabetes or heart problems or or whatever hospital humans heart disease diabetes and other diseases problems diabetes is virtually non-existent in animals virtually non-existent in los angeles and notice nothing most animals die around the same age and allow them to live to the potential of the species another thing most animals not killed by predators they die of old age or natural causes wherein raise your hands you would not raise your hands i've hit that road jack before too i'm i'm turning the corner but i gotta give a testimony and uh give me about seven eight minutes and half first danny martinez here danny martin martinez oh just leave him alone i don't need him no no necesito there was this young couple hoben and they had come from california california and they were this a little they were in their 30s he and his wife they would go to the parking hatch and uh they he would take his guitar in a little amplifier and they would sing he and his wife and then he would preach to them so then he told him once when he was giving him in her catering head he said i have a brother church that would like to talk to you no i never i didn't know who they were you know so they lived in rincon in rincon so we went to their house they received us real well but i noticed we were around the table and i was answering their questions they took turns one would leave the kitchen and go into the garage then he would come back and then the so when the husband went to the garage the wife said they're between me and danny he said uh is it wrong to smoke and then is it wrong to smoke marijuana esta fumar marijuana oh in her face that means her her she looked at us like this and she would look at danny she would look at me and she it was not her voice a voice came from inside as a result of our improper diets so our immune system fails to operate properly and we become susceptible to diseases [Music] so the inspiration of the holy ghost is here the inspiration of spirit to sin you know or if they want to sin that's what you are but use if you say you're a christian christian and you believe it god will make your body obey your confession so when a man is inspired and here is the inspired word the two inspirations together as those inspirations gives a result so no matter how well you study the words it will never do you no good and then the word being brought into the spirit of inspiration then miracles will happen when the two inspirations come together when those inspirations especially which was the material we got here go ahead and play something is there anybody here ayali naki they they need a touch from the lord [Music] [Music] [Music] the world is inspired it's been preached now it's in your hands cause the hour is coming and now if anybody needs prayer you can come to the altar where is the song leader go ahead daddy [Music] go
