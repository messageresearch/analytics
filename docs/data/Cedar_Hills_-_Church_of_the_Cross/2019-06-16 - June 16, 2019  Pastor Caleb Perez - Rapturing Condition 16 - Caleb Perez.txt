know whether to put and their eyes were open or or the image and the likeness in this day so didn't open any will have to today and the rise were open here toes and then another subtitle of image and likeness so detail is like let's get right into the word if you would Genesis the first chapter very well-known verse Tennessee capital o who know are so conocido 1:26 and 27 when you have it you can say Amen oh no it is a cVTC it and we pray that the Lord would add his blessings to this word and that he would open it to our understanding Lippe masaccio's canyon 11 this you only ever linton and that he be the one this morning that opens our eyes God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth entonces dijo diosa gamos al hombre Nostra margin conformance Tresemme Hansa señora sobre los meses de lamar las llaves de los cielos las bestia seat or Tierra and to animal case a Rasta sobre la tierra so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them he also long really ma him imagine it was clear but only umbrellas creo Amen may God add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated suppose your sister that's how her dad is brother David I know that and it's good to have her what's your name me um Valentina yes good to have you here god bless you amen as we get into this to this message we find two words here and that is image and likeness encontramos la palabra mechanism and the word image simply means and I hope that they have it up there I think they do have it yep 11 marking the word images sell them to means to shade is they darkness embrace a phantom is an illusion Malusi own a resemblance resembling a representative would represent a figure in a Fukuda an idol and the image marking then the word likeness in regular panellist in my hands is the word mousse which means a resemblance system but it isn't some model is when mozilla or a shape una forma it's a fashion it's not more than it is something that is like a Celica Casey it was similitude same a honza Bible says in John 1:1 that in the beginning was the word la policía que el disappear a la palabra and the Word was with God la palabra estaba con Dios and the Word was God in la palabra amen where do we know those scriptures and as we look into this we understand it meet the same assistant and demos that when we look at ourselves in the mirror we can see an image of a mostly marking but if it there is a Rek copy of us standing next to us this is a copy of the director ala pardon that one next to us is one like the one that is standing there I like his town that's easy enough something that is like okay see you Alito and so we look at this and he says let us make man in our image after our likeness in fact almost alone mr. Mahina cement water command came under me and I wasn't just a few words that he put out that was a command dose alone an illness Banaras Edelman Damien and not only a command but it is a responsibility in Hoonah response I believe that God created man in His image and then form the man if formal hombre and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life he supply and so Providence and man became a living soul alambre egos their own alma vivian the glory that surrounded that man like Gloria Tara theorize their own was unlike anything that had been seen before come on go Kemosabe a beast one when God finished creating his highest order in creation but ke kanaka what they did they are so he said it is very good I imagine God for a moment telling all the Angels Tollison come and take a look at man Lincoln even a lumbering but what a sight it was at first to be sterile princey to be able to see a man there alone and I could walk a man I could talk no break up with you and Daddy but there was something in the man of Yale Cornell hombre that was not in Angels in northern yes there was something in man that was not in the cherubims nor the Seraphim yes Cyril um break in this time I lost had a feeling it was a glory Rodya that even the angels knew nothing about they could never understand what it would be like to be a son no no carry on intend ayer keroh said llegar a ser única when man fell he lost it that image when the lubricant tells us a man and that's why each one of us we are born in sin Vanessa moss in Picasa we are shaped in iniquity for mouse nd Nikita and we come to this world speaking lies londo minty we are not in his image miss Thomas instrument we are in a fallen state his thumb was in mr. okay then yeah we are still sons of God you don't this morning what the seven is though no matter what condition we are in we were thinking of this you understand what condition were born in om quant a CMOS we are all still sons and daughters of God oh yes almost equals a we are just in a fallen condition no my system was there not going but my command remains let us make man in our image the mental permanent almost a London that was not just for the first creation in Essaouira para la première but it was for a new creation also definitely a skeleton this is exactly why saying hates us so much what the no sodium I know that saying hates you but design cannot change your neighbor say neighbor you know saying hates us pretty states of the lodge yes he does saying hates us oh yeah because he's jealous of the relationship that we can have with God in disgusted look at most and I wanna say that again he is jealous of you and I as Timmy say knows their media stay why else would he fight us so much failure Tonto jealousy instead it all started in heaven woman saw Nancy alone he's jealous once again is a loss because of the relationship that we have or letter let's look at the memos or we can have with God okay play most an air con Dios he's jealous it is a loss and he wants those sons he'll get a case of seekers that are to be made in His image just ambitious in so imagine because he wants to form those sons into his image or kick in for - because he's jealous of us emptiness said oh I don't know if that makes you excited this morning let's just look on my way upstairs but you know when you when you know you got something but let's do Stephanie Alex you know and there's a little jealousy there in Pocatello and some people I guess I don't want that no more because somebody jealous about of me thank you says he said you know you're gonna get up okay well as you looked in it'll get old fast to what you have but you stay that thing that look is done when God what God gives you that gives the very best to his children now watches this message unfold here because if I so much elmo's peloton because his whole purpose of existence for castrates his things here the air list you break you it's brother no all he wants Adam knows care about nothing else but he wants to break you ask in order to make you into another kind of image class today marking once again Genesis 1:26 let us make man in our image after our likeness because ii was a lumber industry man esteemeth Hanson and the image that was to be created first was the spirit man I think he was somebody know that I'll own breast he had ABC's a man mr. Saab they say the image was to be like makhani was there in the shade la sombra or the heavenly representative world represented represent that he was celestial that was to lead the likeness he by some hands I want to say that again once again one of his mass the image back which we read the definition was the shade or the heavenly representative la sombra a lot representacion synesthesia that was created first if we clear the Primera lead the likeness not actually but I get less than the likeness was the form less than my hands that unaffordable model el Modelo the shape that lasts la forma similitude of the image that seemingly to the layman but when man fell he lost the image farrakhan del hombre que yo Paris you're lame and therefore when the genealogy of Adam was written in yellow here their feet on the image of God was not mentioned Lima those general women's you're nada you with me that could me go see now we can go read it with let's go to Genesis the fifth chapter verse one through three so you know that brother caleb is not just making it up vamos a heinous distinct over stone the park area kill him this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him as Easter male and female created he them I don't bless them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created he lost your number they fought yeah Adam lived in hundred and thirty years if you go them seem to think Tanya and begot a son we got a son in his own likeness and only one who said my hands that after his image comfort ministry man he called his name Seth in the Liam Wow now there seems to be flipped around from Genesis 1:26 and 27 amen it's the place it can you hear oh the henesys 126 so God created man in His image after his likeness know what to say the henesys o Simhadri my can say but after the fall now fine Adam Odin cannot Masada be getting a son in his own likeness and condemned only once was that man saw his image as this remark in now now i remember one of the preachers and one of the minister's here i remember who who was preached about that stake in the eliminators pray quirky but but genesis one says no they say that it was image than likeness my he lost at my hands but after the fall as i said it is now likeness and image it others said my hands they lower my legs are backwards oh I'm in a fallen state or a falling condition okay team was interested okay then oh so now when a child is born oricon dunya wanna see the way first of all are in our likeness we made a sin in this test in the Hansa yes sir yes you see yeah that's why Oh Juanito beautiful baby even if the baby is ugly or pretty don't matter is the Fela and they look at the baby and this oh looks got a nose like it's daddy's eyes like it's its mama and whatever else the baby they look at it it's like how many have seen that commercial it's an insurance I think does the commercial de la Segura Anza and and it says you know we we can't keep you from being like your parents my mom at the netiquette they mean is comment Papa because after a while we started to act just like them what case boys act one more thing that we're always mad about when we're young huh my mom okay that wasn't a hologram I am just like him yes boys act almost meiosis yes sir yes still see that - I'm bra no want you silos that to see Hosea amen we are in the back ting just like our parents right it's place that traumas not coming that we didn't wanna be we start acting like emissaries termina when you look at those you see then in a likeness you know Muslim SMI Hansa and and as time goes on emit the sky papasa you know it's I don't know people's here's the parents speaking I get on those parties I just don't know why my children they holler so much it was a poor kicking it on Tonto wow really there it is you haven't heard yourself lately I know either stays miss most I don't know why they do this or that you look in the mirror being in a special and you'll see a likeness but it means a lot of different ways you see that when you when you look at these things we we understand in tandem most but we're asking the question what image then does that child begin to have little Oprah with Thomas a Fema camp you noticed anything there is a likeness there is a man sorry but now will come the image about being a layman what that child will grow up to be okay look away you're gonna say this and many of those things well it depends sources cause depending if there's some man there to make a man in our image you got along great but I said I mean you asleep that's why I'm so thankful this morning to my father I mean father day there was a man that was there I mean hombres told us and to help us and to raise us I do that Rose is there a person or a man there ain't nobody in a person mold an image of this for this person this young person or my only market but it's not homeless what image will they have my baby hairs on the influences defend their late friend yeah it depends on the atmosphere unless most fit on it depends on the seed whether it's in them or not yes remember once again we are all sons of God just in a fallen condition so muster than that on this young guy now we can approach this subject from many angles but watch as we come in from a few different angles they're physically fit this Angulo somebody know that Eve was bone of his bone of Adam's bone flesh of his flesh police whistles he cut her she was not the image Ian literally Martin is that right I mean she was the likeness of that man at all SME Hansa is the hombre amen amen she was to be the glory of that man glorious nobody made in his image he was to be made in the image of God he was suddenly my fundació she was to be his likeness that was made in His image you gotta get that for him very important to understand that as we important think of she was the bride or as the Bride of Christ hey come on I know ya the Keystone we are bone of his bone almost weightless we are the last of his flesh is that in the spirit of his spirit we are ISA samosa teacher and Isha is not the image Church it's a noise like mahisha is the likeness is less than my hands that he got that so far what does look up you gotta get you if you don't get these parts you will you'll lose you or lose whatever later on it's disparities there is one image of the invisible God I only imagine they'll go Simba simply right and then and who was that somebody tell me here in this morning yeah give me that who was the image of the invisible God generally mark indigo Simba Steve Lee the Express image was and is Jesus Christ like any system Oh making sure you know that mosquito say good at minutes we are made in the image of God I'm essentially Martin de Dios but we are not the image there are no somos Lima we are the likeness of that image so more less than my hands are they say nothing for the likeness is the female part working as an aperitif a mini that's why he made both male and female whiskey so I am both Boronia this is why many people do not understand this the Ministry of the son of man and let me tell you anyway because he was called the Son of Man in femal really long because he had to take on the likeness let me handle hombre yes sir yeah that's that's very easy it was fast once again Jesus was called the Son of Man it's just where mother could because it took on the likeness of this of man look at the Melissa my hands are they long do the work of redemption but I said other words you know we when we look at this cuando me Ramos says we understand that the son of man was to be revealed in the last days he was a oh man I know that I know sweetie most yes has he been revealed a story bolado or is he going to be revealed Oh hacer de helado I guess it would depend will you talk to you right the pentacon cannot leave huh it's revealed to you or not since a wheel of stairs and you gotta answer that question people say although brother branham was the son of man oh well oh no he was not no no era he was not the image in no era Leymah him are you with me esta conmigo come on that's why he's not the son of man what does this kid noise but he's in the likeness of man son of man that was to reveal these son of man knowing that the very image of the invisible God camis mother that from here we're gonna be taking the likeness hey now that's you and I is this we got to know where we come from watch watch as this unfolds this is why many people today when we shall hit the oil they go after the worship of a holy man they're on después de la Lala one side you nobody and they start worshiping the likeness more than the the image Lavar my husband to our dilemma him yes sir yes si o si find that a lot even in the message own and then missing went through raised up brother branham levanta la mano Brandon wait a minute interesting we understand who he is sent then there was chemistry we honor and respect that man yo Z damn that he also came forth the most I mean sorry wrong that image they say ma him but I understand that oh we came from that nosotros vivimos yeah II watch there's your worship is that's what asked you but it's got a that way yes it is a because the same way that the beginning of the Gentile dispensation began is the exact same way that it has to and will end is it mismo okay whatever me neither we understand then that he is part of the likeness in most cases less than the like this is what came forth out of the side of Jesus a pierced him bundle already know that on you that's easy right it's the stuff first once again here was the image of the invisible God I keep tellin markandel using Bastille a he was pierced halfway core time to cross the garden water yes la laa LAAS with that keep waste that's the bride of Jesus Christ yes that is his likeness the only way for the likeness to come forth to be a breaking of something I gotta say you're gonna need that later on once again the likeness can only come forth hustle up where's Holly but there is a breaking of something with Lucas they wrote down the original hello Tina or the break-in or the pulling out here we go now as we get into the message Occupy movement in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like a man our elder has preached on this so many times time after time one like the son of man alone brother Branham says in the seven churches in around one like him well it was this he says his bride in a sanajeh is one like him no yes no no come well she is in the likeness is the likeness daniel 7:13 you can go and read it at home then is it that listen in love with night vision one like the Son of Man we go on and on we can see it through the scriptures very low polesky to us and then in hebrews 1 let's read that if you can turn in your bibles keep whenever there's VBS ivory rails and I hope that you that are making sense this morning you're her
