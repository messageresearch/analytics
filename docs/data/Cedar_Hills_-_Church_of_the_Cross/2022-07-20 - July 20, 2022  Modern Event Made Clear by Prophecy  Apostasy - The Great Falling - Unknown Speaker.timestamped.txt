[34:20] lord jesus christ
[34:24] uh it's our
[34:26] fellow lot this evening
[34:30] for these panels of uh current events
[34:33] made clear by prophecy
[34:40] to speak about the apostasy
[34:45] and uh it's quite the subject
[34:49] and uh pray that uh be a blessing
[34:54] here in a little bit we're just gonna
[34:56] switch to spanish
[34:57] momentos
[35:00] but we'd like to well you're standing
[35:01] read the second book of
[35:03] thessalonians
[35:13] 3
[35:14] verse
[35:16] so let not let no man deceive you by any
[35:20] means
[35:21] for that day shall come shall not come
[35:24] except
[35:25] there come a falling away first
[35:27] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[35:30] of perdition he said
[35:42] you may be
[36:11] our pastor he encourages us
[36:14] to to partake
[36:17] so we can realize
[36:19] where
[36:20] we're at
[36:23] and what's happening
[36:38] yes
[36:41] henry it is an honor to be with my
[36:42] brothers
[36:49] when they uh asked me to speak of that
[36:52] subject of apostasy
[36:56] i started to think how this
[36:58] came about
[37:01] where did it
[37:03] begin
[37:05] we had to have a beginning
[37:20] word as such
[37:23] it comes from the greek
[37:33] apostasia is
[38:03] and i started to ask myself where did it
[38:05] all start
[38:09] they tried to track something
[38:13] and who was the first apostate in the
[38:16] bible
[38:46] and i started to search his qualities of
[38:48] this angel
[38:51] and found out that he was a rebellious
[38:54] angel
[38:57] based on his own beauty he revealed
[39:00] rebelled against god
[39:03] causing a riot in heaven
[39:09] the supreme of suffering
[39:26] that it rebels against power and
[39:28] authority
[39:34] and then i searched what does his beauty
[39:37] mean
[39:40] it found out that is the quality of a
[39:42] person
[39:49] thing to cause
[39:51] upon those that look upon them
[39:58] a certain sensorial pleasure
[40:00] intellectual intellectual pressure
[40:02] spiritual spiritual pleasure
[40:08] and he was able to achieve this with his
[40:10] beauty
[40:16] it was in such a way that he brought two
[40:18] third to third parts of the campaign
[40:22] so i started to see what was he
[40:24] preaching to them
[40:27] and he started to convince them
[40:33] because he forced he made a riot
[40:35] up there
[40:50] know he was cast down
[40:54] he was in the garden of eden
[40:59] [Music]
[41:04] and i can i can see that he was very
[41:06] upset
[41:08] he was looking impressed
[41:11] and as i was reading
[41:15] i went to the book of genesis 2 verse 9.
[41:35] and out of the ground may the lord god
[41:36] to grow every tree that is blessing to
[41:39] the site and good for food
[41:43] also in the midst of the garden and
[41:45] tree of knowledge of good
[42:00] commandments
[42:02] he tells men tells the man and and
[42:05] kennedy says
[42:07] yes he says this is genesis 2 16 and 17.
[42:13] human doctrine
[42:19] and the lord god commanded
[42:20] the man saying of every tree of the
[42:22] garden thou mays freely eat
[42:33] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[42:35] and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in
[42:37] the day that thou eat is thereof thou
[42:39] shalt surely die
[42:53] but according to the message there is
[42:54] someone that is observing
[43:11] looking to see how he could also become
[43:14] a creator
[43:16] because he went against the lord
[43:23] because he went against the principles
[43:29] and when he was observing he realized
[43:32] there was a being there
[43:34] that he could use
[43:49] you know the bible says
[43:52] that the serpent
[43:55] was the most
[43:57] shredded animal of all the animals in
[43:59] the garden
[44:01] the messenger teaches us
[44:04] that it was the closest thing to adam
[44:20] now i see
[44:23] that he did the same thing as he did in
[44:24] heaven
[44:30] wrapped by the serpent
[44:33] he wrapped the serpent and anointed
[45:02] it was a
[45:03] intercourse that took place
[45:06] and from there
[45:08] there was two seeds
[45:15] eve partook with the with the serpent i
[45:19] mean
[45:21] he made also adam to partake of it
[45:25] and from that act
[45:27] from that action there's the seats that
[45:29] came out
[45:30] yeah
[45:44] and the son of the wicked one was always
[45:47] against
[45:48] the son of adam
[45:51] he went also against it
[45:55] how how did all this came walking across
[46:34] because that seed will always go against
[46:36] the seed of god
[46:38] there was jealousy there
[46:53] because of the one that became uh an
[46:56] apostate
[46:59] so i just follow him as he comes
[47:02] and he start to manifest himself
[47:06] as he comes through generations
[47:22] we don't have enough time but as we try
[47:24] to follow
[47:27] after he killed his brother the lord got
[47:29] him out cursed him
[47:33] he gets married
[47:35] he starts his generation
[47:45] god substitutes that seed that uh
[47:48] was killed by cain
[48:24] [Music]
[48:33] that satan had to always go against the
[48:35] things of god
[48:38] always contradicting
[48:42] as he continued
[48:44] the generations come
[49:14] so we can see how it all started
[49:18] my brother's here
[49:19] next to me
[49:20] they're going to continue
[49:25] i know what what is my capacity
[49:28] i can get it
[49:31] but i'm just following here how this
[49:33] apostasy started
[49:35] how it's manifested yesterday
[49:38] and as he comes walking vienna iran
[49:40] comes abraham
[50:14] and he was afraid because he he knew
[50:16] that his wife was as beautiful
[50:21] said he did it
[50:24] to
[50:36] was he an apostate an apostate
[50:51] is
[51:05] but there was two
[51:08] rebecca and rebecca was so worried
[51:12] because
[51:13] such a struggle
[51:16] only she knew what she was feeling
[51:21] only you ladies during pregnancy know
[51:23] what you're going through
[51:27] so she she got desperate and she
[51:29] inquired of the lord
[51:34] i believed he told her
[51:37] you know don't don't worry about it
[51:41] well there is two nations in your womb
[51:44] esau is
[51:53] what i'm wondering is that what were
[51:55] they fighting about
[51:57] to see who will come out first
[52:01] there was a fight going there
[52:16] as i'm telling you i don't want to go
[52:17] into too many details
[52:23] his seed comes forward
[52:28] but remember that god changed
[52:31] the name to jacob
[52:33] for israel
[52:37] and that was the beginning of nation
[52:42] and as you know you have to understand
[52:44] the bible
[52:47] to find out
[52:49] how would this begin
[52:54] and he had his brothers
[52:59] and the bible says that he his brother
[53:02] didn't love joseph because they were
[53:04] jealous of him
[53:08] they had jealous of joseph because he
[53:10] was the spirit
[53:12] they tried to kill
[53:27] as you know joseph ended up in egypt
[53:34] because that seed within within him
[53:37] how to be shown
[53:40] but there was a purpose behind all this
[53:44] that it was to preserve life
[53:50] and as this goes as i'm closing
[53:54] all
[54:16] at such a
[54:17] number that the bible says that
[54:19] pharaoh was afraid
[54:23] they start to get a little heavy
[54:24] supremiento you're suffering
[54:27] they will cry out
[54:31] they will pray sacrifice sacrifice
[54:35] and the lord remember them
[54:39] and he said i will get you out.
[54:44] and then
[54:46] moses comes to the scene
[54:49] to bring his people out
[55:18] as the plan of god starts to develop
[55:23] the people of israel rejected the
[55:26] prophet
[55:28] because they were always murmuring
[55:32] always
[55:32] criticizing in particular
[55:35] there were
[55:35] in part they were with it in part they
[55:37] were against it
[55:40] when it was for their convenience they
[55:42] were with them
[55:44] it was inconvenient for them
[55:46] they
[56:29] for me just pray for me
[56:32] but let us not go against anything
[56:39] against the prophet
[56:41] and the message
[56:43] god bless you
[56:50] each one of you
[56:54] yeah brother nervous but very very good
[57:22] that god got tired of it
[57:33] why would he get tired
[57:37] he was making his patients run out
[57:44] it got to such a point
[57:46] israel
[57:48] dealing so much with israel
[57:51] and israel would not accept
[57:54] the way god was doing it
[57:58] what did god do then
[58:03] he he
[58:05] wrote out a a letter of divorce
[58:08] you stop in san diego
[58:10] i was thinking about this
[58:12] basis because many times
[58:16] us as christians
[58:23] sometimes legally it seems like we're
[58:25] almost in the same circumstance
[58:29] and when we receive the counsel of god
[58:33] okay
[58:49] i've already warned you i gave you the
[58:50] medicine
[58:52] and you you just won't take the medicine
[59:00] my question came to me is this
[59:07] [Music]
[59:23] [Music]
[59:32] we can see here how these two seeds
[59:36] from the womb
[59:40] they were already fighting
[59:43] and they always were there
[59:49] even when they ask jesus
[59:53] what do we do with this seed
[59:57] are we gonna just rip it out of the
[59:59] ground no
[1:00:01] leave it there
[1:00:04] no not knowing it plucking it up
[1:00:08] we also pluck up the the wheats
[1:00:15] according to this what we must be most
[1:00:17] conscious of then is
[1:00:21] the apostasy
[1:00:23] has always been
[1:00:39] the bible says it is
[1:01:19] they're the ones that know me more
[1:01:22] um
[1:01:38] and that's the way i've been able to
[1:01:41] remain standing
[1:01:43] since a little child
[1:01:47] testimony olympia i've always tried to
[1:01:49] keep my testimony clean
[1:01:54] and maybe look like i've been a little
[1:01:55] religious
[1:01:58] but that's what it sustained
[1:02:06] you know how we have confidence with our
[1:02:08] wives
[1:02:11] yeah i tell them you know what this is
[1:02:13] just not right
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:17] and maybe
[1:02:18] to somebody that happened this has
[1:02:19] happened the same thing
[1:02:24] how does the sister zone so do this it
[1:02:26] does this okay
[1:02:28] then i just become silent
[1:02:31] i say
[1:02:32] lord
[1:02:34] there's an alarm that goes off
[1:02:40] if there was something
[1:02:50] when god made such an accusation against
[1:02:53] or something against
[1:02:56] because everything began fine in ephesus
[1:03:27] it looks like everything is beautiful
[1:03:33] as the journey begins then
[1:03:42] then they begin to find that the weight
[1:03:44] becomes very full of stickers very
[1:03:46] sticky the way
[1:03:50] okay
[1:03:51] here i go with this
[1:03:54] here that the apostasy
[1:04:02] the word apostasy means to go back or to
[1:04:05] fall away
[1:04:25] because of these sticky
[1:04:27] paps or things that we go through in the
[1:04:29] way
[1:04:32] and then
[1:04:33] many say oh i don't want to go that way
[1:04:39] the example we have in the scripture
[1:04:42] is uh lot's wife
[1:04:48] even though she came out with this
[1:04:50] they came out of sodom and gomorrah
[1:05:21] counsel as as your brother
[1:05:25] flee from that
[1:05:28] flee from
[1:05:30] from all appearances
[1:05:32] of sin
[1:05:43] automatically the spirit of god will
[1:05:44] tell you this is not right
[1:06:40] it was now in the church already
[1:06:48] and the council that he gave them was
[1:06:50] love one another
[1:06:54] the best thing that you can do is to
[1:06:55] love one another
[1:07:04] i said this to the pastor and i hope
[1:07:06] this will help you
[1:07:08] because antichrist
[1:07:11] is something that goes against christ
[1:07:17] it's everything that opposes itself
[1:07:24] against everything that is called god
[1:07:31] god had something in favor with the
[1:07:33] church of ephesus
[1:07:37] they had tried the apostles
[1:07:40] it said
[1:08:07] moved so easily
[1:08:36] that's what paul gave counsel to not be
[1:08:39] easily moved from that faith
[1:08:46] when the false apostles entered into the
[1:08:48] church of ephesus
[1:09:01] you're not speaking the same thing that
[1:09:03] paul spoke
[1:09:18] the devil's not really going to come out
[1:09:20] and just reject a truth
[1:09:23] what does the devil do
[1:09:28] when the devil says something is really
[1:09:30] good is happening in the church
[1:09:32] is
[1:09:52] you're very far away from the world
[1:10:28] speaking of the gentiles
[1:10:31] being the first church of the gentiles
[1:10:35] from there the this apostasy began
[1:10:39] brother branham says
[1:10:42] significant
[1:10:56] backslidden
[1:11:00] the the backslidden church
[1:11:08] brother branham says ephesus was not a
[1:11:10] deceived church
[1:11:13] but a church that fell on its own
[1:11:18] but not to continue in perfect love
[1:11:24] and he says here episode
[1:11:26] as a summary
[1:11:30] are fruits without love
[1:11:33] it's what brought them to apostasy
[1:11:38] that the
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:12:04] there's the danger point right there
[1:12:26] i always ask that question to myself why
[1:12:28] did paul say it if he calls that you are
[1:12:31] built
[1:12:34] upon the foundation
[1:12:47] you come against that
[1:13:03] except they be in agreement
[1:13:04] jesus jesus
[1:13:08] he knew judas was
[1:13:11] did he cast him out
[1:13:13] no
[1:13:17] he was right there with him
[1:13:21] but sooner or later
[1:13:24] he had to give up forth his fruits
[1:13:44] to us than this
[1:13:46] work is more important
[1:13:50] so many things that we could add to that
[1:13:54] it's more important than congregating
[1:13:56] together
[1:14:00] i think it's time to take inventory of
[1:14:03] our conditions
[1:14:05] because if there's something that paul
[1:14:06] says
[1:14:09] don't
[1:14:10] forsake the assembling of yourselves
[1:14:13] together
[1:14:19] accustomed to do that
[1:14:23] they don't have their revelation
[1:14:26] it's
[1:14:56] they were going to get so comfortable
[1:14:58] with so many commodities
[1:15:01] in in this career
[1:15:04] to go out of the way
[1:15:07] they relaxed oh
[1:15:22] the preacher
[1:15:25] if you need to speak about love you can
[1:15:27] just hit a few buttons and talk about
[1:15:29] love
[1:15:31] yeah
[1:15:32] and that's there's everything's there
[1:15:36] but we forget to look for the more
[1:15:38] important thing
[1:15:41] it's that is the divine inspiration of
[1:15:43] god
[1:15:47] everything seems to be so easy for us
[1:16:04] we didn't even have the beds
[1:16:10] they just like had pillows or
[1:16:12] there or something
[1:16:17] but we would pray
[1:16:33] they would ask me about the resurrection
[1:16:34] i knew what the resurrection was about
[1:16:38] i i know what healing is
[1:16:42] what a miracle is
[1:16:48] nobody can tell me about healing or
[1:16:50] miracles even though that's okay but
[1:16:52] because i already experienced it
[1:16:55] but as time goes by
[1:16:57] you know
[1:16:58] and you relax
[1:17:00] it
[1:17:14] the result of all of this
[1:17:18] it begins in one person
[1:17:24] it begins just with one person
[1:17:28] and then they can make a competitive
[1:17:30] commentary and they say
[1:17:34] we can relax okay oh okay that's okay
[1:17:52] you could get to their homes and say how
[1:17:54] are we
[1:17:55] how are we doing
[1:18:08] your young man's up with a worldly
[1:18:09] girlfriend la nina
[1:18:18] oh god what happened here
[1:18:22] because something
[1:18:38] the most tremendous thing about this is
[1:18:41] is it the devil
[1:18:45] he always goes coach to the head first
[1:18:50] the devil always want to look to
[1:19:05] israel looks at everything being at
[1:19:07] fault what happened to them
[1:19:10] but god tried
[1:19:13] to to bring them back
[1:19:16] that they would rise up
[1:19:19] they didn't want it
[1:19:32] the apostasy so much entered into them
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:20:15] oh yeah
[1:20:30] a condition or something
[1:20:36] when i was 16 years old they asked me
[1:20:38] that question
[1:20:39] christian
[1:20:40] are you a christian i said
[1:20:59] want one of my friends to know that i
[1:21:00] was a christian
[1:21:03] no brother afterwards what a pain what a
[1:21:06] suffering i went through
[1:21:08] i felt like peter
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:52] until it reaches into a complete
[1:21:54] apostasy
[1:22:19] and speaking on this of apostasy in
[1:22:22] espanol
[1:22:36] is
[1:23:04] it refers to
[1:23:18] our brothers have tremendously brought
[1:23:22] us
[1:23:27] we have about 25 pages of quotes and 25
[1:23:30] verses
[1:23:31] at all
[1:23:49] we're not speaking to a people that have
[1:23:51] never heard of the lord
[1:23:54] but we'll quickly quote them
[1:23:58] as our brothers have quickly quoted
[1:24:00] certainly
[1:24:17] and we do not give it the importance
[1:24:18] that we should
[1:24:22] persona because we always see it in
[1:24:24] another person
[1:24:28] i
[1:24:36] when the scripture speaks of apostasy
[1:24:40] it also uses the term iniquity muchas
[1:24:43] versus many times
[1:24:51] it's not speaking of the sinner that has
[1:24:53] never heard the word
[1:24:56] but when it speaks of inequity
[1:24:59] it speaks of those that know to do well
[1:25:02] not to do right and do not do it
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:09] the majority of times where it refers to
[1:25:11] apostasy
[1:25:16] it refers to acts of inequity
[1:25:24] the the book of micah the lord speaking
[1:25:27] of israel
[1:25:31] and we'll mention it very quickly
[1:25:36] in the book of micah the lord's the lord
[1:25:37] says
[1:26:11] and i'd like for us to read this in the
[1:26:13] book of jeremiah chapter 2.
[1:26:19] the lord after all that the the brothers
[1:26:21] have spoken
[1:26:26] israel how many times the lord had to
[1:26:28] deal with israel
[1:26:33] it is an incredible question
[1:26:37] because let me ask you something
[1:26:41] has any of you read the bible
[1:26:46] i imagine yes
[1:27:02] have you read of the people of israel
[1:27:07] have you reached the conclusion where
[1:27:09] you ask what's wrong with these people
[1:27:13] have you ever had that thought
[1:27:29] that better describe the condition of
[1:27:31] israel
[1:27:34] well what if someone saw us in this
[1:27:36] moment
[1:27:37] what would they say
[1:27:43] israel had now crossed
[1:27:59] but before that he he began with this in
[1:28:02] jeremiah chapter two
[1:28:08] the lord says
[1:28:22] the word of the lord came unto me saying
[1:28:25] and i come along
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:28:53] in a land that was not sown israel
[1:28:58] israel was holiness unto the lord
[1:29:02] the first fruits of his increase
[1:29:08] all that devour him shall offend
[1:29:11] us
[1:29:12] evil shall come upon them saith the lord
[1:29:14] yes
[1:29:17] how the lord begins
[1:29:21] to begin to tell them that
[1:29:23] he's tired of that that's enough
[1:29:28] and until it comes to verse 17.
[1:29:37] procured this unto thyself and that thou
[1:29:40] has forsaken the lord thy god
[1:29:47] what have you in in the way of the lord
[1:29:50] that you drink the waters of denial
[1:29:56] and
[1:29:57] what have you
[1:29:58] and on the way of assyria that you drink
[1:30:01] out of the water of the euphrates
[1:30:05] your wickedness shall
[1:30:06] punish you
[1:30:09] i rebellious
[1:30:19] know how wicked and bitter it is that
[1:30:20] you have left the lord thy god
[1:30:24] and have lacked my fear in you
[1:30:27] el senor
[1:30:28] saith the lord the lord of hosts
[1:30:44] and graces and mercies that had existed
[1:30:50] but israel is only a type
[1:30:53] we are not israelites
[1:30:56] what does this have to do with us
[1:31:00] in the same way
[1:31:02] in the book of timothy
[1:31:04] chapter four
[1:31:09] first timothy
[1:31:12] chapter four
[1:31:14] and
[1:31:29] some shall depart from the faith
[1:31:30] escuchando espiritus en canadores giving
[1:31:33] heat to seducing spirits
[1:31:35] and doctrines of devils
[1:31:41] speaking lies in hypocrisy having their
[1:31:43] conscience here with the hot iron
[1:31:45] case
[1:31:55] forbidding to marry and commanding to
[1:31:57] abstain from meat which god had created
[1:31:59] to be received with thanksgiving of them
[1:32:01] which believe and know the truth we're
[1:32:03] running out of time but
[1:32:05] as we continue i'm going to tell you a
[1:32:06] second timothy 3 estamos parden del
[1:32:09] tiempo pero
[1:32:10] continum
[1:32:25] the lord speaking to the gentiles
[1:32:31] the same terms
[1:32:33] as he spoke to the the people of israel
[1:32:35] in jeremiah
[1:32:42] this know also that in the la in the
[1:32:44] last days perilous day perilous times
[1:32:52] we know we live in in perilous times
[1:32:57] right search this scripture
[1:33:02] go here to finish my time
[1:33:06] i want to bring something that's very
[1:33:07] significant
[1:33:13] and firstly i want to bring the
[1:33:14] definition of apostasy
[1:33:17] according to the dictionary
[1:33:20] which is to abandon the faith
[1:33:24] the act of leaving behind
[1:33:29] or to stray from a political belief or a
[1:33:31] principle
[1:33:33] or that is or religious
[1:33:54] the word apostasized also comes from the
[1:33:56] word of apostasy apostasion apostasize
[1:34:00] significa
[1:34:01] which means separated divorce
[1:34:04] divorce
[1:34:12] i i i found uh something curious with
[1:34:15] this uh apostasy the word apostasy
[1:34:23] there's two definitions and one of them
[1:34:25] is written a bit different yes
[1:34:32] a criminal offense of heresy by not
[1:34:34] believing a religion
[1:34:37] now
[1:34:38] an apostate
[1:34:42] one who has abandoned the religious
[1:34:44] faith
[1:34:46] a political party
[1:34:49] someone guilty of apostasy
[1:34:53] someone who has abandoned the principles
[1:34:56] los unanimos de la posta the synonyms of
[1:34:59] apostate
[1:35:02] is strayed backslider her backs
[1:35:05] backslider
[1:35:06] cafe one of little faith
[1:35:10] uh disloyal renegado
[1:35:12] uh
[1:35:56] if you're not associated with a certain
[1:35:58] religion you're a mugwoman
[1:36:03] someone who has reversed infidel
[1:36:08] incredulous
[1:36:29] a lot of men in the old testament as
[1:36:31] apostles
[1:36:32] as was abraham
[1:36:36] he denied the faith to save his own skin
[1:36:40] david
[1:36:41] david fell in apostasy
[1:36:45] to seek something
[1:36:49] to to go out of the faith
[1:36:54] automatically becomes apostasy
[1:37:01] but it's not condemned as such because
[1:37:02] he has not completely left
[1:37:19] it would fall
[1:37:22] back up a little slower
[1:37:28] and they thought whether they had to get
[1:37:29] back up or not
[1:37:32] especially the fall didn't feel so bad
[1:37:36] after three four times
[1:37:39] it's not necessary to get back
[1:37:44] perhaps being fallen is better than
[1:37:47] being upright
[1:37:51] they continued in that way
[1:37:53] as a people
[1:37:56] until they reached a condition
[1:38:01] they entered into a complete apostasy
[1:38:06] and they denied the lord jesus christ
[1:38:09] when the uh
[1:38:11] this son of sin it's judas
[1:38:30] i want to go into something that i
[1:38:31] thought was very interesting
[1:38:38] when we speak of apostasy by denying the
[1:38:40] the faith or being backslidden or such
[1:38:56] i don't believe every case is the same
[1:39:00] some may fall in inequity
[1:39:03] if they do not know right no no
[1:39:09] you have to know what's right for it to
[1:39:11] be iniquity
[1:39:15] many come to church and then they leave
[1:39:18] and they go back to the things of the
[1:39:20] world
[1:39:23] and you said well they used to help
[1:39:24] insurance they used to sing and yes
[1:39:29] that does not mean the brother or sister
[1:39:31] had a new birth
[1:39:36] can someone fall again if they never
[1:39:38] really had an experience to begin with
[1:39:45] a church is a very kind social club
[1:39:52] and there's people that go to churches
[1:39:53] for to to socialize
[1:40:05] this
[1:40:06] yeah especially they go to church they
[1:40:09] have a very nice car they go very well
[1:40:11] presented
[1:40:15] that's where the arrow is committed
[1:40:19] because there is
[1:40:57] of those that they they stand and then
[1:41:00] they say well we are we stand faithful
[1:41:02] here in the faith
[1:41:13] don't come here
[1:41:29] that's an identification
[1:41:40] many people are rising up right now
[1:41:44] because they're my friends
[1:41:48] and you say well brother if you don't
[1:41:49] believe like that
[1:41:51] you're not a bride
[1:41:55] i don't pay attention to that
[1:42:14] will the ones with paul will they enter
[1:42:16] in when brother brynn would be on the
[1:42:18] curtain of time
[1:42:20] what did the boys tell him
[1:42:22] yes or no
[1:42:24] yes
[1:42:41] we're going to be fine
[1:42:46] the word is the only thing that will
[1:42:47] keep us
[1:42:53] the church cannot do the work for the
[1:42:54] individual
[1:42:58] nor can the church do the work for the
[1:43:00] home is
[1:43:02] iglesias
[1:43:04] problem says the churches that are
[1:43:06] falling in apostasy
[1:43:08] they become foreign
[1:43:40] we're making the people come and
[1:43:42] accumulate and stagger stagger
[1:43:46] and confess
[1:43:47] and they leave
[1:43:50] and what we need is
[1:43:54] a
[1:43:56] moving uh an old-fashioned a breaking up
[1:43:59] old-fashioned breaking up old-fashioned
[1:44:01] breaking up
[1:44:04] uh
[1:44:46] but the failure
[1:44:48] many times begins there
[1:44:52] we bring the children to be dedicated
[1:44:54] presented unto the lord
[1:44:58] as all you young people have been here
[1:45:00] in the first few years
[1:45:17] but you have to blame someone the the
[1:45:19] son is not walking in the ways of the
[1:45:20] lord well iglesia well it's the church
[1:45:24] or it's the ministry okay
[1:45:29] the thing is we don't understand the
[1:45:30] word when it's said unto us
[1:45:37] bless you to
[1:45:38] raise them in the admonition of the word
[1:45:43] we have entered as israel had been this
[1:45:46] year
[1:45:48] to say we presented you we dedicate you
[1:45:50] as a good so
[1:45:53] i have to go to work to give you what
[1:45:54] you need
[1:46:36] is there a family altar at home
[1:46:44] let the holy spirit inspect because the
[1:46:46] answer we receive we know is not the
[1:46:48] truth
[1:46:50] how many of the holy spirit is
[1:46:52] all
[1:47:07] heareth and knows to do right
[1:47:09] and does not do it
[1:47:13] it is apostasy
[1:47:17] because iniquity is being done
[1:47:37] to be able to
[1:47:39] teach them enough so that they reach a
[1:47:41] point
[1:47:45] where they can walk the same hallway
[1:47:46] evening
[1:47:47] come to the same
[1:47:50] and dedicate their own life
[1:47:53] unto the lord
[1:47:56] through a personal experience
[1:48:00] when the parents have not left that part
[1:48:13] our time has left but we'll make a point
[1:48:15] here regresando israel returning back to
[1:48:18] israel
[1:48:22] when they went into babylon in alexillo
[1:48:24] babylonio in the babylonian exile
[1:48:30] it was a difficult condition
[1:48:34] but it's not as bad as as you may think
[1:48:39] because as they arrive to babylon
[1:48:44] yeah
[1:48:46] a different government they no longer
[1:48:48] had authority over themselves in
[1:48:50] babylonia in babylon
[1:48:53] it was death mientras
[1:48:56] as long as they did not do like the
[1:48:58] babylonians
[1:49:04] babylonians did not bring them as egypt
[1:49:05] used them
[1:49:09] now this is history
[1:49:12] they understood
[1:49:37] as long as you do it as the way of the
[1:49:39] babylonians
[1:49:45] so the priests caviar babylonia that
[1:49:47] there was in babylon
[1:49:52] they
[1:49:53] they stood
[1:49:54] at their
[1:50:46] they mix themselves with the cultures of
[1:50:48] babylon
[1:50:50] says
[1:50:58] what happened after babylon with the
[1:51:00] jews
[1:51:02] it is said
[1:51:04] to israel israel the religion of israel
[1:51:07] or israel as as as such
[1:51:11] came to an end
[1:51:14] but their judaism began
[1:51:32] because moses said uh the lord will uh
[1:51:35] lift up a prophet his eye
[1:51:39] as they were in babylon
[1:51:43] in the priesthood
[1:51:45] speaking
[1:51:50] they came out with the principles of the
[1:51:52] faith of the jews
[1:51:57] and they believed the creator blessed be
[1:52:00] his name
[1:52:05] creator of all things only he made them
[1:52:08] and will make them
[1:52:12] that the creator blessed
[1:52:29] the the prophecy of moses our teacher
[1:52:32] that he rest in peace
[1:52:36] his prophecy shall remain forever
[1:52:42] that the torah would not be changed or
[1:52:44] replaced
[1:52:51] and with all these commandments to
[1:52:52] punish all that uh trespass these
[1:52:55] commandments
[1:53:04] the lord began to show something about
[1:53:05] the gentiles
[1:53:08] where the faithful man
[1:53:09] is
[1:53:25] and began to show unto him a
[1:53:27] dispensation of a people that were not
[1:53:29] jewish
[1:53:37] we know that in in the way of a symbol
[1:53:39] began to show itself unto the gentile
[1:53:42] people
[1:53:44] as the lord did this with daniel
[1:53:49] the ministerio los levitas the priest
[1:53:51] the ministry the levites
[1:54:34] a heretic and an idolater
[1:54:42] and unto this uh judaic religion jesus
[1:54:45] is the greatest apostate ever
[1:55:02] thing
[1:55:04] the third principle
[1:55:10] of the principles of the
[1:55:12] judaic belief
[1:55:14] this in
[1:55:15] it says
[1:55:20] i believe completely that the faith of
[1:55:22] the creator blessed be his name
[1:55:28] nor affected by physical males
[1:55:42] they blinded themselves since babylon
[1:55:58] but in their mentalities back then
[1:56:01] wanting to do what is right
[1:56:04] in apostasy
[1:56:06] without entering into the world
[1:56:09] and doing things the right way
[1:56:11] and return unto the lord they continued
[1:56:15] in their era
[1:56:16] their error continues
[1:56:20] until they entered a complete apostasies
[1:56:26] they did not deny the lord when they
[1:56:27] crucified him
[1:56:35] they they denied him when and amongst
[1:56:38] themselves they uh formed this norm
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:54] we know
[1:57:20] something i'd like to clarify real
[1:57:21] quickly
[1:57:24] the difference between christ
[1:57:27] and the antichrist
[1:57:29] is that christ
[1:57:36] and christ is made a man
[1:57:40] god can become a man
[1:57:43] that's christ
[1:57:45] but the antichrist
[1:57:48] is when man
[1:57:50] tries to make himself god
[1:57:56] when man wants to be come god
[1:58:32] and in babylon the people were mixed
[1:58:37] there was a remnant that did not mix
[1:58:43] brother branham then praise says
[1:59:00] and live the life of christ
[1:59:03] because for there to be apostasy
[1:59:06] there has to be someone
[1:59:08] that stands for the truth
[1:59:11] to identify apostasy
[1:59:22] [Music]
[1:59:53] [Music]
[1:59:57] there are so many things that happen
[1:59:59] around us
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:04] lord i don't ask that you take away our
[2:00:06] trials
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:09] but only that you help us to remain in
[2:00:11] your word
[2:00:13] because by your word
[2:00:17] is how we can overcome
[2:00:19] jesus
[2:00:20] as jesus overcame con la palabra with
[2:00:23] the words
[2:00:38] [Music]

[2:01:12] please help us and give us encouragement
[2:01:14] to continue forward
[2:01:16] as that elder said
