the rock [Music] there's honey in the rock for you [Music] family amen but the title of the message is brotherly love how many know what brotherly love is we're going to start with the scripture i'm not used to this and having the way to me to put the mic up i'm sorry brothers psalms 119. we're going to read verses 104 and 105. first we're going to go into a little bit what a lamp is what is the lamp amen amen and it's very simple here seems it is simple but it's tremendous right brother no we simply i keep it we tremendous let's start with verse 104 through your precepts i get understanding therefore i hate every false way your word is a lamp unto my feet and as a light and to my path dear lord jesus we just thank you lord jesus for this grand prix to be before your children we thank you lord jesus so how does it say noah in spanish verse 5 105 yeah 105 and the grammar it says it what we would call in reverse order in the way we said in english in english in spanish gram it's just the opposite that's why we can't sometimes just say a sentence this straight the way it is in english it doesn't make sense and a lot of times to the way the grammar is in spanish how the saying goes it gives it a little more flavor right lamb and to me es du is your word wow so first of all what's the lamp we're talking about the word okay now let's turn to matthew 25. and for right now we're just going to read the first four verses and you know what this is talking about right how many want to be wise virgins puentos quieren said uh virgines prudentes how many want to be foolish virgins in sensatas i'll leave it to you there okay hello then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom entonces el reyno de lucia but they took and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them notice how it says they took their laps but they took no oil with them what does the word emmanuel mean significant god he has to be with you amen i'm in so they took their lamps they had their words their word but they took no oil with them but now notice the difference in the wise version in in prudente and the wise took oil in their vessels with their laps you notice how it said in spanish it's it's a little container as we heard from brother sammy a reserve right now they just didn't have oil in the word that they had and at the end of this message we will see what that vessel is we have a lot of ideas and they're fine many of them are very i have some too yo very good maybe but we're going to find out what takes the first part of psalms 119 105. thy word is a lap into my feet notice i'm going to see how it goes from that comma then there's a comma there that means time a significant oh you you gotta that that light that's gonna come to your path it's not just gonna come like like that there's gonna be time that goes by but then that same word it says ants there's something that's going to join with it is now based on what i just said i believe this person that's got this far vasado and lo esta este punto i believe this person is born again how many are born again maybe [Music] oh my let's try again again he said putting your thinking caps on and here it's talking about the seven churches and so forth iglesias i would recommend that you read the whole chapter i'm measuring on these lamps verse 20 the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels or messengers the greek word there is earthly messenger angels and the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches los angeles notice here in english it uses the word candlestick in english have you ever been in a wedding where they put this lamp stand with and they put seven candles on it and i don't know now let me see somebody that has done this before do they put a match to every one of those seven our opponent they get that one they like the second second one iconessa segunda they put the first one back regression they pick up the second one that's got light fourth fifth sixth and seven let's go to zechariah in the person you you can't be a lamp until you can reflect light nope but you have a vessel that needs to be filled before amen so zechariah four verse two sacrifices and he said unto me what sees thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and it's seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof so go ahead and give me the picture there well we'll just read that one verse what we're talking about so it's not a candle stick like we think where you put a candle on it and you see how it all connects together it's more like a lamp stand or in so the seven churches then are represented here uh or do you pertain to one of the seven church ages the foolish virgin had a lamp and she knew which church age she was in i want you to notice here these first four verses that we read estos primeros cuatro versiculos they said the wise had oil and the foolish didn't have oil it's a declaration of god's foreknowledge is a declaration this is what's going to happen from now on to the coming of the lord that each of these seven church ages is going to produce talking about the body right established from now until the coming of the lord how many understand that this is you got while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept a lot of people try to connect the first four verses with verse five and they just don't understand it he's seeing how these ages go by brother rem says it in 10 versions in 144 000. and they live out their age of events with us finished their purpose on earth and they go on to be ivana uh and brother branham says that verse five is so now you begin to see the time that he's talking about is he talking about you establish your stance how many believe he's talking about you want to scream establish death try to watch that clock i'm doing good so far watch now here from between verse five and six comes a complete change of age and it brings us all the way that to the time he and how he showed the eclipse of each age he took the the moon and the eclipse electricity which of the seven eclipses was a total blackout juan de la siete all right well how is it did it get any light then entonces loose yeah amen amen now brother ben said about 1977. people can get all critical about that all they want i couldn't see past 1997 of night yeah 1977 excuse me no no no no then i didn't know how anybody could live in a condition like that but who put that little bit of light in there [Music] so that there wouldn't be total darkness for is if you have a portion out the pastor's light in that essence we have a life comes through him he's the candlestick we don't want god to ever remove that no no no no no we don't want god to ever remove that no no no god ever did that that would show something real bad but that's not going to happen if we stay with the words we gather it says it gathers more all along and makes that body of the pillar of fire yes so it starts off as a little light and that little light is what's going to help fill that vessel that's what's going to convert the word being a lamp onto my feet and like unto my path can you put up the picture for me the other stature the church ages and the statue of the perfect man you below that we have what justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit is justification and then the prophet says when you get that you barely have faith now becomes a light and to your path from the bottom from the time of the apostles all the way to the time of brotherly kindness i'm not going to go into the colors that's what peter says robert branham said brotherly love hermano now i didn't give this quote to you all up there but it's out of discernment of spirit of spiritus i would rather see brotherly love existing existed i like the way he says that in other words it's not just something that's here and then it leaves and when we feel good we're nice we love one another and we love the people that come in i like that expression i would rather see brotherly love existing the church if we didn't and then people take that out of context and say see so if somebody doesn't get healed in the surface if the holy ghost doesn't come down amen amen praise the living god let's go back to the our photo there so you get up to brotherly kindness more fraternal what age was that pertaining to aqueduct what does the word mean anybody that's a simple oh a little problem happens among a brother or sister or among family um i've only been at this over 35 years is way up here oh man love one another we can put up one another with one another little crazy like me locos and everything is fine and then other times our brotherly love is way down here problem happens between two families especially when the young people get to where they're going to start dating problems i don't want to get into pastor's place but all i can say is i've been god bless you sister i love you then it doesn't work like if the person doesn't even exist you know i respect the name of hill your respected hill hill but i i look at my brother julian hermano julian i see more than a hill velmasque un hill i see the blood of jesus christ i see i might get in trouble for this one problem we need to get over the last name syndrome if your buddy buddy was so-and-so that has the last name of this then you're in the end amigos but maybe you don't quite understand that other person so then you're the out on a person oh you've never felt like that before huh this has happened over more no probably closer to 40 years right but now let's focus here so we want our bill why do we want our brother love to be at such a high level now the only thing i don't see in between the top of the pyramid and the bright age are love what's your other photos the prophet puts holy spirit so you have to have all this and light until your path all the way to the top but then when you get to brotherly love if you truly have brotherly love then the holy spirit unites it with the headstones now just before we go back to matthew 25. how many really enjoyed that message on wednesday message of grace the twin sisters orthodox church israel orthodox he says that in one place another place he's saying is the church coming into existence brother branham says this is like iglesia existencia and she's in the headstone esta en la piedra de corona my goodness i just loved it so much zechariah four zakarias cuatro where it says let's go to verse six vamos a verso says we're eventually going to get to the rock box we're doing good then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by my nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts responding great mountain put them out well let's put the mountain back up and i'll just read it amen before zerubbabel amen this great mountain is thank the lord jesus christ jesus let me finish reading it here oh and you look at that and you think you say i gotta get all the way up there to make it in the rapture okay in order to make the rapture well that's looking at it in the corner ways because the only reason we can go up this great mountain is because we're already in the rapture the lord himself shall descend with a shout out message of preparation amen let's get in let's pick it up right here then verse 7 who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel ye shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof anymore now this grace that's coming is producing shoutings and why did we hear a lot of it on wednesday producing this [Music] can you remember how many times i listened to that when i could listen to it but watch this crying well i got the figure up there but if you are are you following in your bibles with shouting of grace gracias but not just to hurt no solo but now this grace gracia this lamp that was the words just put that other back up there again now [Music] what do you think paul said be followers of me as i am of gamelgyo pablo di jose he was one of the most tremendous teachers saul ever sit under one of those maestros of me as i am of christ how many follow the christ of our pastor pastor well it's not just the crust of our pastor this and the nature and the character of a pastor not just a man that stands up and says he's something which he never does that no solo number are we happy so far now brothers i would like to go to that quote out of blasphemous names and i'm almost forgetting something here forget me up there i'm getting ahead of myself as usual let's go back to matthew 25. yes i wanted to hit on those from verse 5 you know but another three or four verses now in verse five we saw this the aegis went to sleep and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom comes go ye out you meet him in estrella he's not just seen this age he's seen the whole thing all the way till now that helps me understand a little bit hebrews 11 31. i could never understand before and there's no poliente that says having provided a better thing for them having provided a better thing for us so now when he starts to talk in the scripture here he's stuck in specifically to this time established he's speaking to leo established but not know and himself out into the bright age amen amen that's what who's talking to you now now notice how it seems like it changes i don't says the foolish virgin had no oil in her lap she didn't have any holy spirit in the word that she received nothing else god's spoken word of the original seed amen in her vessel praise the lord jesus watch this then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps verse 17 and the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out oh see how the scripture balances itself off what was the oil that ran out it's because she stayed in sound that's a little the loudest yeah this little light of mine can you lose mia i'm gonna let it shine oh yeah god we gotta let it shine yeah naked the numbers gonna be the light it's almost like loose but the wise answered in saying not so lest there being not enough for us and you but go rather to them that sell how many can say that you i don't i that scripture is hard to understand how many because if that's hard to understand go to them that cell arabian uh because you rejected the way that god wanted to give you that little light bring you out of leonis do it for yourselves but now i want to go to the rock box oh this is where it's going to get sticky amen rock it's called a blasphemy as names is talking about sister shepard established a shepherd ringing lord do i have the holy ghost that was the most important thing to her have i got the holy ghost can you prove it to me wait a minute how many of you when you believe you received the holy ghost you have that question about whether you receive the holy ghost you can say lord can you prove it to me let's put that up that picture done clear it up there again and then we'll go back to the description i'll have you bring that right back no what do you receive the holy ghost well brother right here well after i was justified sanctified i received the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] it's not just our baptism of the holy ghost baptism after baptism all the way to the top all the way to the consummation you received a new spirit and now you have a holy spirit not the holy spirit no at the top no el espirito santo questa amen amen praise the lord how many want baptism after baptism baltismore and i'd forgotten oh there's honey in the rock for all you and me okay blasphemous names back to that because i spoke with tongs and we believe in all that but have i really got it and after this resistance when she had this dream paragraph 102 through 104. and she dreamed she was up on a mountain yes the best i haven't got the paper before me but uh then like this she dreams she saw a rock box my husband was just behind her and she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on established the most pure water that she'd ever seen pouring it into this box this rock box is and this rock box would not hold the water and it rolled out of there and just boiled up all the trash and sticks and everything throw all the way back to the beginning of the statue of a perfect man at the bottom of the mountain and looked back what did she look back [Music] she was wanting to know where she was amen she turned and went down she stopped in the bottom and looked back she saw five streams of this pure crystal water not contaminated by the things have you been contaminated by the things you've been you passed i'm not saying you have no they go see sometimes we get a little dirty we have an advocate watch this in the crystal water not contaminated by the things that had went large crystalline it went through no contamination coming swiftly and she was wondering would it ever reach the bottom of the mountain and she says will it ever get to in other words will it ever get to me amen let's go to the next paragraph brothers paragraph 121 through 124. now i'm reading a lot so therefore the rock the latter-day pentecostal church which has received the holy spirit like they did it first of all down to the ages they receive the holy spirit but not in the measure they have it now how they lit that first candle and it went higher and higher and got dimmer and dimmer then come back again see first and last and so forth candles the message is is being poured into the church but the church body itself all together like the el cuerpo de lectres next paragraph paragraph now here's where it gets down to ability love and some of the things some of our ideas you're this tabernacle right now our church's tabernacles right this tabernacle is not a holy ghost tabernacle there is no such a thing no existed individuals that come into this church is holy ghost tabernacles individuals the spiritual sun they are tabernacles that contain the holy ghost but not the church in the uh the body a group no neglect and watch how he types this with her dream where the water almost didn't make it therefore it runs out why because we think that just by coming here pensamos and solo veniraqi that we're a holy ghost tabernacle yes right the holy ghost is here it is he wants to be tabernacled the messenger to the church pouring the message into the church but what's the water doing it was boiling out all the trash that was in it now paragraph 129 and 130 and we'll finish reading that so much that she come down here down the hill to the bottom of the hill now this glorious water was gushing over the hills in five streams in cinco arroyos now five is the number of grace where when it gets so high it's before it becomes five streams it's one stream then it split into five minutes let's go back now to the rock box and there's more quotes but i don't want to read it because i'm at 55 minutes so in her dream when she saw that this rock box wouldn't hold the water in [Music] why won't this rock box hold the water or quest and what was the rock box it was your rock confession the same confession that peter made she was water for no contagion agua then the same messenger gets a big bucket of honey el mensahiro este mis moments and then he um to pour the water back in it regressed and that's when it started to fill up and hold the water yeah it wasn't just coming out of the seams it is fair the doctrine of the apostles and prophets and she was wondering what that water get to where she was at to us to many of us that water has reached us to the pastor our founding pastor on wednesday he says what is honey yes anybody tell me what honey is according to what we're reading what is the see if you can put it up there i don't know if you're able to get it up there there it is okay combined action or operation operation and what are the what is the result they're looking for yes cause it to work together what a pair together how many believe that's why our pastor tries so hard to get us to work together juntos the synergy now brother could you read the definition you have in english and i'll translate it to spanish because it opens up i didn't give this to you but thank you go ahead it says to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects apart now honey has healing properties how many know you can take honey for this and they cut in especially if it's virgin honey right they have a saying about honey we know it's not exactly true but it's just saying it says that it has an eternal almost an eternal shelf life we know it's not eternal we know what the word eternal means right it just doesn't and it takes this example the prophet gives it in like four or five minutes this pastor has a sick sheep and he wants it to lick the limestone he has in his little pocket now that sheep is not going to just lick that sour ugly tasting limestone now does he just lick it off until he gets the limestone because you don't like the taste of the limestone but it combines it it takes some of the lime perotoma apart starts to combine it with the honey it's a combination now let's put our picture back up and we'll finish and we'll go to our next our last vote this rock box is at the top of the pyramid river we have the holy ghost with elijah what's the holy ghost is actually between there tenement study history brother hector you know more about this than i do yes and many of you that were in the apostolic church what really destroyed overall the pentecostal movement why did they divide into so many little isms and clicks because they lost brotherly love fraternal they had different ideas they had no honey differences do you think it'll be any different why do you think and we're not throwing at nobody tell us never to do this why so many churches in the message instead of having brotherly love embezza tenera more fraternal and sit down and cry out to god and bring in the honey until god can come down into the honey we should be like sister shepard a shepherd can you confirm it to me i gotta know for sure she he was such a loving person he would invite brothers into her home last quote out of the conflict between god and satan and that's i'll be done [Music] yeah now remember my word is a lamp and to my feet a light unto my path i want you to have that in mind as we read this thomas is this fire was wanting a confirmation watch this fire is the confirmation that the lights coming from the words coming forth from her lamp quebec yes because thy word is a lamp and to my feet it's this light that's coming this fire that's coming this light the prophet brought esta professor [Music] amen god is the word the oil is the holy spirit and the fire is the gospel light on that oil why do you believe you're constantly striving to get people to receive the holy ghost way to make me walk correctly spirit the fire is the gospel light of that oil god said so see oh my goodness that could go crazy on that and it was on the outside estaba fuera had no oil she stayed in laodicea and they couldn't reflect nothing but just their church nopodian the pentecostal church couldn't hold it english but it didn't forgive my cut-up way of trying to bring this lord i don't ask forgiveness for bringing your word your word is the word we believe it with all of our hearts control amen amen [Applause] amen can we give one to god's servant this morning i'm gonna enjoy that can you just raise your hands this morning you need something from the lord i believe we've heard from the throne of god i sing praises to your name can you just tell them that this morning church [Music] i sing praises through your name oh lord [Music] for your name is great and great praised [Music] just reach out

name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb it was named of the angel before he was even conceived predestination and when the in the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord and as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall

dark world that we live in may he be a light to his generation bless his parents brother nate sister shelby father may they raise him in the admonition of the lord lord that only thing in his heart
