will bless them tonight i was going to speak on something tonight and i might not i might incorporate it but i want to to to maybe just do this really quick i'd like to entitle my message tonight the and we want to turn into first john the the third chapter in the second verse and then from there i i to the book of isaiah or i'm sorry to to first chronicles uh the 25th chapter and verse 1. so first of all we are going to go to to first john and then we're going to go to first chronicles the 2015. brother brother michael perez from from phoenix sent me this scripture i thought it was a very fitting scripture first john the third chapter in the second verse beloved amalus now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be doing but we know that when he shall appear and this is the musicians david and the captains of the hosts separated to the service of the sons of aesthetic and of haman and objection and who should prophesy with harps with sultries and with symbols and the number of the workmen according to their service was happens lord we're thankful for your presence that is has has never left this building and also as everyone knows our our family are are very musical if this does not come by by coincidence does not come by chance no no it comes by a lot of practice it comes by a lot of passion it comes by by a lot of uh loving the lord jesus jesus you know when when i was growing up growing up we had no tv at home what we did was we we found out how to have recreation ourselves and we didn't we we would eat dinner and after every dinner this was a catastrophe my dad would get the guitar me papara and you see the great musicians that my brothers are the best losers we we would they would we would we would sing almost my dad would play the guitar and we worship the for 18 hours a day he said it become to the point of that he would just hear the real to real just go on and on and after a while then you might hear my dad shout out and you might hear might even maybe see him run we all knew that he had just got a revelation that's the type of atmosphere where we we grew up in people cursing was not allowed in our home watching different magazine was not allowed nowadays you can't even open up your phone nowadays you can't even open up your ipad something might come to you and influence you but no wonder in heaven they have these great musicians these great musicians are called the angels the bible says that all they do is the seraphims all they do is say holy holy unto the lord they know the great songs of heaven but they don't know the songs of the redeemed so they know not the words of that song but i want you to go into the scripture as we read it beloved a mouse how many are god's beloved [Applause] david chooses the captain of the host separated [Music] everybody's hands should be raised [Applause] [Applause] me something that's prophecy right there when somebody gets up and says amen prophecy [Music] anybody outdoors that loves to go hunting [Music] [Music] you have just [Music] i say [Music] somebody gotta say glory to god how can telling us the glory of god you gotta raise their hands now i'm going to give you a quote that's going to knock your socks off it's rolling right now somebody else want to prophesy you you say well i i don't have a special revelation yeah you do jesus loves me excuse me [Applause] you know why i'm not and there's more to come on yes you come over here thank you all right jesus christ we believe is the same yesterday forever all right now oda right out in front of you stands the person all right just like you was a few minutes ago here i am i come to the altar i'm sick i look at that person and that person was me a few but there is a well person there i'm going to tell you again now we are the sons of god but it has not yet appeared a few minutes ago but there is a well-person standard jesus christ it's calling to that well person thank you [Applause] [Applause] already gloria glory so then jesus jesus is calling to that well person so he sees you now all right young person all right he sees you now as a well person a victorious person brother victorioso a redeemed person on a [Applause] so you start with your musician your musical instrument and every time you give praise to god it's the right note that's the only way when it comes but it has not yet appeared what you shall be jesus doesn't call for your old self jesus calling for the new you start calling you to him and that brings music to the house of the lord [Applause] brother branham is in the desert of arizona they've made this a big controversial point but to us that are musicians there's no controversy they just don't know how to play hey [Applause] and there's seven angels me waiting to meet him shall be the redeemed son of god does not know any of that thing is he that is born of god the world's not treating me right now the politics is all over the world and we can focus ourselves in the negativity of the world but let me tell you the lord tells jeremiah not too many people are excited tonight diaz that's what the word of god does to a redeemed person okay okay let's try this again before i form one of my musicians in this last vietnam he says no weapon you don't know what it is okay we're gonna go home brother sam we're gonna go home the majority of us people are gonna put on the tv and find out what they're doing when in heaven [Applause] but there is not a musical person in heaven that can find that key in the musicians playing their instruments here on earth right now they're sitting down not to be sacrilegious they might have a big old box of popcorn how do you say popcorn and they're eating popcorn you find out what you're doing yesterday and they're hearing the word no weapon ninja they're looking at us and they say well i guess that wasn't a powerful word but then somebody gets it and they hear the word of the lord again no weapons can i tell you this no problem no authority nothing on the world none of them no weapons no weapons so they get excited wow can i write that lyric well it's this video solution i write it and their pen won't even write it on the paper you know why they can only be written in the heart of the laborers have been redeemed it's all right you just don't know the song you can't you can't you cannot you cannot you cannot look it down at somebody that does not know the song but when you know the song and you start hearing i've been reading already [Music] what i've been reading i'm a musician i love the musicians musicals because they play so beautifully here i can't play you know i can clap my hat say glory a man to give it to other men to infect them but can i say it again no weapon mean
