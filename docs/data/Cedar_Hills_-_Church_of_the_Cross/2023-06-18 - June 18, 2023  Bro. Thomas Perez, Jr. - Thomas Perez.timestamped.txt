[28:09] testimony before I share what I'm gonna
[28:12] share
[28:18] um I was looking at this um
[28:24] and I was drawn to two places in the
[28:28] face
[28:32] uh the eyes
[28:35] and the bottom the mouth
[28:41] I saw the eyes that were deep set
[28:45] foreign

[29:08] it was like
[29:10] like a dark clouds uh
[29:16] tormentors
[29:19] but
[29:21] as he was doing as he was looking that
[29:24] was my take on it as he was looking the
[29:28] bottom part of his mouth was curled a
[29:31] little bit down
[29:38] like he wanted to laugh
[29:43] and and to me it was like he was saying
[29:46] I see you devil out there stirring some
[29:50] problems in the future

[31:09] one because they believed

[54:49] the world is bright since I got right
[54:56] and so so we sometimes might focus on on
[55:02] the negative around us
[55:06] I I challenge us
[55:10] I challenge myself
[55:13] to uh to to start looking at the
[55:17] positive of what God's given us
[55:22] you know uh and I thank God for
[55:25] everything that he's given me
[55:28] I got I got the best family in the world
[55:32] and I I attributed all of all those
[55:35] things to to to to to Sister Laura uh
[55:41] that has been such a great help
[55:44] throughout the years
[55:46] and uh we we here in a few weeks
[55:51] we will be celebrating our 39th wedding
[55:54] anniversary
[55:58] but a lot of that is
[56:04] thank you but but a lot of that is not
[56:07] attributed to me
[56:10] it's attributed to her
[56:12] uh she sometime is a glutton for
[56:16] punishment is
[56:20] because you you you're you quote unquote
[56:24] we don't live a normal life
[56:29] our life since we were born was never
[56:32] ours
[56:35] our life since we were born was born to
[56:39] serve the Lord and God's people
[56:44] and so we're grateful to to God or or
[56:48] what he's done for us
[56:51] now now the Book of Malachi is
[56:55] is the book and I won't take very much
[56:59] of your time this morning
[57:01] but I will take enough
[57:04] people that you could get what you need
[57:07] foreign
[57:40] and that's all right
[57:43] but but but uh we aren't just Malachi
[57:46] four five Believers
[57:49] we're Bible Believers
[57:52] we believe that the whole word of God is
[57:55] the inspired word of God
[57:58] it is inspired and it is infallible from
[58:02] cover to cover is
[58:26] can you put me the the the first the
[58:29] first uh
[58:32] and the the first slide there you go
[58:35] lucky
[58:36] now this if you see it is and I pray
[58:41] everybody I get everybody's complete
[58:43] undivided attention
[58:47] is is I want everybody to understand
[58:51] you know
[58:53] when when we as as Believers
[58:57] and I I always ask the question
[59:01] when I speak to couples
[59:05] I always ask the question who's the head
[59:08] of your house
[59:13] I also I also do believe that you do
[59:17] need a father in your home
[59:32] all right
[59:34] you don't know it
[59:35] you do need a father at home okay
[59:41] they're the the national statistics
[59:44] that's the statistics
[59:46] of fatherless children the Eagles
[59:50] are astounding is
[59:55] that's why I I want to thank and and
[59:58] those that that step up to the plate you
[1:00:01] cannot says
[1:00:08] that they have had have had to act as
[1:00:11] mother and father
[1:00:14] to those that have maybe taken in
[1:00:17] children that are not their children
[1:00:21] and have raised them as their own
[1:00:25] you should be applauded this morning
[1:00:30] we're grateful to those
[1:00:33] that love God's people
[1:00:37] but the statistics and the facts are the
[1:00:40] same
[1:00:43] a husband and a wife
[1:00:46] they can't get along
[1:00:49] and they separate
[1:00:51] guess who suffers
[1:00:54] the children
[1:00:56] now I always tell people this thing
[1:01:01] we as adults
[1:01:04] and especially us as men and as fathers
[1:01:10] have got to do a better job than maybe
[1:01:14] we might be doing
[1:01:18] but I want to applaud each and every
[1:01:20] father this morning
[1:01:23] that has not skirted their
[1:01:26] responsibility
[1:01:29] but has taken the responsibility of head
[1:01:33] of their house
[1:01:37] and has said the buck stops here it is
[1:01:41] because it's easy to say well Lord the
[1:01:45] wife that you gave me now
[1:01:48] or the
[1:01:50] serpenter or whatever it may be
[1:01:54] and all of that might be true
[1:01:57] but it's so important when you see a man
[1:02:01] stand up
[1:02:04] and he will say you know what Elizabeth
[1:02:07] here I am I take full responsibility
[1:02:12] responsibility that's what happens at my
[1:02:14] home
[1:02:16] Happy Father's Day
[1:02:21] amen thank you
[1:02:23] children born in fatherless homes are
[1:02:26] two times greater risk of infant
[1:02:29] mortality is
[1:02:36] two times more likely to drop out of
[1:02:39] schools
[1:02:43] so you think you just hurt yourself
[1:02:47] three times more likely to go to jail
[1:02:51] test message
[1:02:54] six and ten youth suicides yes
[1:02:59] are because of children born in
[1:03:01] fatherless homes
[1:03:05] seven in ten high school dropouts
[1:03:11] comes from fatherless homes
[1:03:15] having an involved father in the lives
[1:03:18] of our children
[1:03:21] has a profound impact on society
[1:03:27] children with present and positive
[1:03:30] relationship with their dads
[1:03:35] are half as likely to show signs of
[1:03:39] depression
[1:03:42] two times as like to go to college and
[1:03:45] find a stable job after school
[1:03:50] eighty percent less likely to spend time
[1:03:54] in jail
[1:04:00] this
[1:04:01] things that we as a society do yesterday
[1:04:06] that that that that the programs in our
[1:04:11] in our world
[1:04:12] systems
[1:04:14] in the United States
[1:04:17] they compensate a lady
[1:04:22] or a woman to have more children out of
[1:04:27] wedlock
[1:04:29] so they can get more funds
[1:04:33] dinero that makes the person or the
[1:04:37] father is
[1:04:39] not responsible okay
[1:04:42] responsibly but what a father it is
[1:04:47] that he loves his children
[1:04:50] that loves his wife I must disposal that
[1:04:53] loves his family to do as Christ did for
[1:04:56] us
[1:04:57] Christ
[1:04:59] is the head of the church
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:57] are the different questions that that
[1:06:00] are different than Maybe
[1:06:14] some of the first questions you should
[1:06:16] ask a boy is this
[1:06:20] do you like girls foreign
[1:06:30] this is the world we live
[1:06:34] now the world outside says that you can
[1:06:37] do whatever you want
[1:06:40] if a man with a big old beard comes in
[1:06:43] one day
[1:06:46] and he says I'm going to use the woman's
[1:06:48] restroom
[1:06:51] because today I Feel Like a Woman
[1:06:56] right
[1:06:58] and they identify themselves
[1:07:02] as anything they want to come
[1:07:06] but as our our pastor says
[1:07:09] just because you stand in the garage
[1:07:15] does not make you a car
[1:07:18] just because we sit in a Pew
[1:07:23] does not make us a Christian Cristiano
[1:07:26] there are responsibilities with that
[1:07:29] title my responsibility
[1:07:31] anybody can make a child
[1:07:34] but there's only your father
[1:07:37] I can take that responsibility
[1:07:40] just say this is for me and my house
[1:07:47] that's responsibility and character it
[1:07:50] is
[1:07:56] there are over a hundred gender
[1:07:59] identification is
[1:08:05] you can marry yourself
[1:08:08] you can marry a rock
[1:08:11] you can do whatever you want to is
[1:08:15] you want to get a a a
[1:08:19] legislator
[1:08:21] or a person of politics
[1:08:27] ask him what is a man
[1:08:30] number
[1:08:32] what is a woman
[1:08:33] well if they have the XX chromosomes and
[1:08:36] the XY is
[1:08:39] what is it today that makes a man a man
[1:08:45] what is it that makes a woman a woman
[1:08:49] what makes a woman a church
[1:08:54] what makes a man a man yes
[1:08:57] because he puts on pants
[1:09:00] anybody can put on pants
[1:09:03] anybody can identify themselves as
[1:09:06] whatever they may be
[1:09:08] but who do who do we that claim
[1:09:12] malachiophore
[1:09:18] well our church don't teach that
[1:09:21] and you guys that are there while you
[1:09:24] follow a man
[1:09:26] I want you to notice that when God sent
[1:09:30] forth to us
[1:09:36] send forth a man
[1:09:38] he didn't send us another church
[1:09:42] he sent us a man
[1:09:44] take responsibility of that church
[1:09:49] responsibility of that family
[1:09:52] first take responsibility for the word
[1:09:55] that he would produce now
[1:10:00] God tells us this
[1:10:03] behold I send you us
[1:10:10] what has been given to me
[1:10:13] what has been given to us
[1:10:16] what has been given to you
[1:10:20] he gives us something in life
[1:10:23] is so a vast importance
[1:10:28] again any man can make a baby
[1:10:34] any person can make a baby a man can
[1:10:37] make a baby
[1:10:39] I gotta say this right any man can make
[1:10:42] a baby
[1:10:43] I think that any person can be get
[1:10:46] pregnant
[1:10:51] you know it's the most crazy
[1:10:57] that anybody can pregnant
[1:11:00] my goodness gracious oh why anything can
[1:11:04] happen
[1:11:05] anything goes
[1:11:07] do whatever we want to say
[1:11:12] yeah
[1:11:15] because it's a people's right
[1:11:18] but in between Philadelphia and laodice
[1:11:23] there's an open doors
[1:11:26] another church that has been called from
[1:11:30] that church yes
[1:11:39] we we look at ourselves
[1:11:42] and I I I find that that myself I lack
[1:11:49] you're in control
[1:11:51] and I looked to the messages that that
[1:11:55] of the economy your middle name
[1:11:58] that our pastor's been speaking on they
[1:12:01] call it and I say Lord help me
[1:12:05] help me
[1:12:06] if you don't help me I I I I don't know
[1:12:10] if if all this time
[1:12:15] that I that I preach your words
[1:12:19] that I I need to come to the
[1:12:21] understanding of the of I need to grow
[1:12:25] in your words
[1:12:28] well you see brother I have a lot of
[1:12:31] Revelations
[1:12:33] that might be soul
[1:12:35] but but the Bible speaks to us
[1:12:39] that Jesus grew okay Jesus
[1:12:46] if today I'm I'm the same as last year
[1:12:52] I have not grown but the Bible again
[1:12:56] says
[1:12:57] that Jesus Jesus grew in wisdom and in
[1:13:01] stature Jesus Christ
[1:13:04] even the prophet of God would say this
[1:13:09] God was evolving all the time
[1:13:14] he was learning more all the time
[1:13:22] then he made everything that was in
[1:13:35] everything that he
[1:13:37] is and it was good there came a time
[1:13:42] that he had learned the maximum that he
[1:13:45] was going to learn
[1:13:53] his own name is
[1:13:56] so that he could dwell inside
[1:14:01] what what does that show us
[1:14:05] that all that was in God he poured into
[1:14:08] Christ
[1:14:10] and everything that was in Christ he has
[1:14:12] poured into the Bible because
[1:14:16] so should we grow
[1:14:20] I say yes because a person that don't
[1:14:23] grow is dead
[1:14:26] you can't expect for that person to grow
[1:14:29] anymore
[1:14:31] but a person that's alive
[1:14:34] there's always something better around
[1:14:36] the corner
[1:14:39] there's a better relationship
[1:14:42] I want to be a better
[1:14:45] I wanna
[1:14:47] say foreign
[1:14:59] we look at our at ourselves
[1:15:03] and I look at the scripture
[1:15:06] and the scripture does not fail
[1:15:10] the scripture does not failure when it
[1:15:15] says this
[1:15:16] I must decrease
[1:15:20] he must increase
[1:15:24] you know
[1:15:26] sometimes I'm talking about myself
[1:15:30] sometimes there's too much Tommy Jr is
[1:15:34] there Michelle Tommy Jr
[1:15:38] yes my wife is sometimes there's too
[1:15:40] much
[1:15:43] and I saw myself 20 years ago
[1:15:48] and I see myself today that's too much
[1:15:51] of me yes
[1:15:55] I got fatter
[1:15:58] I got uglier
[1:16:00] I got older
[1:16:03] but when the scripture says I must
[1:16:07] decrease
[1:16:10] what does that mean
[1:16:12] what does that mean in our lives
[1:16:16] when we always
[1:16:19] says
[1:16:21] yo yo
[1:16:23] and we all have eyes
[1:16:25] and I'm just me me I I and I I I I yo yo
[1:16:31] yo yo yo but the scripture doesn't miss
[1:16:33] it brother Jacob
[1:16:35] I yo not talking about you doesn't say
[1:16:38] you no no it doesn't say us doesn't say
[1:16:42] them it says I we say yo
[1:16:49] doesn't speak about to anybody else
[1:16:55] he speaks about my person I don't speak
[1:16:58] about any other family
[1:17:00] because we all live in a glass house
[1:17:04] if you live in a glass house
[1:17:08] growing rocks
[1:17:14] I tell this to the couples
[1:17:18] there's three pointing right back at it
[1:17:23] you cannot you cannot get away from it
[1:17:26] is there things that should be better
[1:17:30] yes see but the first one that needs to
[1:17:34] be better
[1:17:37] and you can't get away from it
[1:17:42] I must decrease
[1:17:49] well I got a lot of Revelation brother
[1:17:52] you still got to decrease yeah
[1:17:56] you know why because you got that
[1:17:58] revelation
[1:18:01] and sometimes the revelations that we
[1:18:04] that I get obviously
[1:18:06] might not be the revelations of God
[1:18:11] again
[1:18:14] I got your thing goes when there was the
[1:18:17] last time that you read the Bible
[1:18:20] the pillar of fire came into the room
[1:18:26] what I was supposed to do
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:32] this is this is the problem with me is
[1:18:36] too much Tommy Jr Tommy Jr there's too
[1:18:41] much of me
[1:18:42] Persona and and not enough of him
[1:18:47] I must decrease
[1:18:52] yo
[1:18:58] must decrease
[1:19:01] he must increase
[1:19:05] this is where where where where where
[1:19:08] where the eighth Messengers get get
[1:19:10] really twisted up okay
[1:19:14] there's been many stand up and say you
[1:19:17] know after brother Branham left they're
[1:19:19] the ones
[1:19:23] and they start saying this
[1:19:26] he must decrease
[1:19:29] I I must increase
[1:19:32] I must increase
[1:19:37] and then they take out the quote that
[1:19:40] says this is
[1:19:41] maybe this ministry is
[1:19:44] that I have tried to take people
[1:20:05] because they get this quote
[1:20:08] to promote them
[1:20:16] must be mistakes
[1:20:29] if all you see is Tommy Jr Tommy Jr then
[1:20:33] Tommy Jr has not has not done enough
[1:20:36] until the time so that you can see
[1:20:40] Christo
[1:21:00] foreign
[1:21:17] in my home in
[1:21:20] my church in me Iglesia in my life
[1:21:24] in my friendships
[1:21:27] when I think that I'm always right
[1:21:32] and everyone is wrong
[1:21:35] I must decrease
[1:21:44] not only my pork skins really make a lot
[1:21:47] of noise
[1:21:50] when I walk into my house
[1:21:53] and I think that I am the big big
[1:21:57] somebody
[1:21:58] and my wife
[1:22:04] oh I'm talking to you fathers father
[1:22:10] s
[1:22:13] Happy Father's Day that is
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:20] we had nothing but the best not even
[1:22:23] most much
[1:22:24] we had the best father we have the best
[1:22:27] father before God
[1:22:29] maybe he wasn't your father in the flesh
[1:22:33] but in the gospel you knew how to treat
[1:22:36] your wife
[1:22:41] you know how to take responsibility
[1:22:46] God had become number one in his life
[1:22:50] decreased to such an effect
[1:22:54] and God increased in his life
[1:22:58] I look at my papa's life
[1:23:02] I see a life that was
[1:23:09] it was that was so that was so where you
[1:23:14] saw nothing but God is
[1:23:18] and I looked at him
[1:23:21] I said I want to be here
[1:23:26] I look at our pastor Pastor I close my
[1:23:30] eyes and when I do because I hear my
[1:23:34] papa speaking again
[1:23:36] I want to be him
[1:23:42] where it was so so close to be
[1:23:50] that people thought that brother Branham
[1:23:53] was Jesus Christ
[1:23:56] and he would say I am not Jesus Christ
[1:24:00] I am not the son of man I am a Son of
[1:24:05] God
[1:24:09] your brothers
[1:24:13] that even John in the Book of Revelation
[1:24:17] all this Revelations
[1:24:25] he had been with Jesus
[1:24:36] that somebody confused you with Jesus
[1:24:39] Christ

[1:25:46] because if you don't believe her the
[1:25:49] mother girl that don't care about
[1:25:50] anything of your responsibility
[1:25:54] that you look good
[1:25:57] believe yourself like if you're Arnold
[1:26:00] Schwarzenegger for this Arnold
[1:26:02] Schwarzenegger
[1:26:04] and you're gonna believe it is somebody
[1:26:08] else told me I've been watching Jesus
[1:26:11] tell you
[1:26:12] guys
[1:26:14] love you there ain't nobody like you
[1:26:17] know who's dead
[1:26:22] when Jesus died on the cross Jesus
[1:26:26] Bible says
[1:26:29] they had him in between two thieves
[1:26:32] he had his arms spread like
[1:26:36] why did he do that foreign
[1:26:47] now I'm not much of a hugger yeah

[1:27:02] you ask my wife if I get good hugs
[1:27:10] you might not be a hugger through the
[1:27:13] world

[1:27:21] there ain't no God like my god
[1:27:27] there ain't nobody so
[1:27:42] but I chose this Father's Day yes
[1:27:46] since I was a little little little guy
[1:27:51] that I was going to follow Jesus
[1:27:54] and especially now since he sent me
[1:27:57] Elijah the prophet is
[1:28:02] Elijah the prophet in the Bible says was
[1:28:05] a man
[1:28:09] the Bible says he was he he he he was
[1:28:12] not confused of his identity
[1:28:16] right right brother Dave he said nothing
[1:28:19] confused

[1:31:16] don't tell me that because you've seen
[1:31:19] the statistics
[1:31:21] what happens yes we think that we are
[1:31:25] just a solitary unit
[1:31:29] solitary you know what happens when
[1:31:33] somebody Winks at you that's not your
[1:31:35] wife
[1:31:53] it doesn't mean I don't smile yes
[1:31:56] but that's for a different reasons
[1:32:02] when you
[1:32:04] come to the understanding
[1:32:07] I might finish with this is
[1:32:17] this is my papa it's just me Papa in the

[1:32:50] papa says
[1:32:51] it says all things
[1:32:54] are passed away
[1:32:58] behold all things are become new
[1:33:03] he's a new species of being
[1:33:07] special
[1:33:09] he's a new race
[1:33:12] he's a new breed it is
[1:33:16] in general he's a super breed it is
[1:33:19] stupid you know why he's Jesus people El
[1:33:24] Jesus Jesus
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:28] that's why I say this church here this
[1:33:30] church don't save you
[1:33:32] Tommy Jr was not crucified on the cross
[1:33:35] for you
[1:33:37] Jesus Christ was crucified
[1:33:41] we are bought we are purchased by God's
[1:33:44] own blood foreign
[1:33:58] all right
[1:34:01] and it isn't so much
[1:34:04] what we gave up
[1:34:13] brother Jacob I gotta let that one just
[1:34:15] just yes
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:17] he says
[1:34:19] it is not so much what we gave up
[1:34:24] you know if I if I if I am a better
[1:34:28] person
[1:34:29] yeah you're going to be better till
[1:34:31] tomorrow until you get upset
[1:34:34] until somebody tells me you're not a
[1:34:38] Christian we're going to show them that
[1:34:40] you are not a Christian right
[1:34:45] Michael
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:58] I thought you just got out of church
[1:35:04] he's a new racea
[1:35:11] that's why God raised up brother Jesus
[1:35:15] Jesus not because I prayed for him not
[1:35:20] because brother Abraham prayed for him
[1:35:22] and because he's a new race
[1:35:25] he's a Jesus people Jesus
[1:35:35] he's a new
[1:35:39] breeders super
[1:35:44] It Isn't So Much what we gave up
[1:35:49] but it's what we receive is located
[1:35:56] well we'll baptize them
[1:35:59] if they get right with God
[1:36:02] and and they stop smoking and drinking
[1:36:07] drugs
[1:36:09] we're gonna clean them before God cleans
[1:36:13] themes I know the church does a better
[1:36:16] job you know
[1:36:20] oh where a new breed
[1:36:24] it's not so much what we gave up
[1:36:28] but it's what we received
[1:36:31] it's what we take on
[1:36:35] Ruth in the Bible
[1:36:38] was in a land that was suffering with a
[1:36:40] famine
[1:36:43] Israel was suffering with a family
[1:36:47] that's how Naomi went into the land of
[1:36:50] Moses
[1:36:52] well when Ruth came back
[1:37:01] he didn't give up her poverty
[1:37:07] she only took on Bo as his riches
[1:37:13] [Applause]
[1:37:16] where's Abraham You Gotta Give me an
[1:37:19] amen right now give a mentor not to me
[1:37:22] to the word of God not to meet to the
[1:37:24] word of God
[1:37:26] Ruth was in poverty
[1:37:29] he didn't give up her poverty she only
[1:37:33] took on Boaz is riches
[1:37:36] and the poverty went away
[1:37:41] [Applause]
[1:37:43] we got it so backwards
[1:37:46] that if I read and I read and I read and
[1:37:49] I hear and I hear it
[1:37:56] the first thing that we got to do
[1:37:59] she didn't give up her poverty
[1:38:02] she only took on bow as his riches
[1:38:06] and the poverty went away
[1:38:11] yeah
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:13] Gabe get get Felipe a high five just
[1:38:16] right right now
[1:38:18] in his hand okay
[1:38:24] she only took on companionship of Boaz
[1:38:30] you understand
[1:38:32] so then when we are in Christ
[1:38:36] it's not so much that we live leave this
[1:38:40] but it's what we take on is
[1:38:47] automatically makes all things pass away
[1:38:52] everything becomes new
[1:39:02] because you found out that there were
[1:39:04] other words in the English language
[1:39:10] because he lets you speak in tongues
[1:39:14] can you imagine that some people cuss so
[1:39:16] much
[1:39:17] that when they speak English for the
[1:39:20] first time they actually think that
[1:39:22] they're speaking in another town
[1:39:28] because it's a clean language
[1:39:31] when you speak about what God does for
[1:39:34] you
[1:39:35] it's a clean language
[1:39:38] it is
[1:39:40] another language and I don't have to say
[1:39:43] combination plates
[1:39:48] people talk what they don't even know
[1:39:51] they use curse words like if they're
[1:39:54] anything
[1:39:56] but when I became a new person in Christ
[1:39:59] Jesus Christ
[1:40:07] hmm
[1:40:09] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:40:11] it's bad I think I think this will just
[1:40:14] be good now now maybe if I find it maybe
[1:40:16] I don't know I need to be a better
[1:40:19] better organized
[1:40:22] but if I became too organized
[1:40:26] and I wouldn't be
[1:40:28] yeah
[1:40:30] then if I'm not who I am
[1:40:32] going to be somebody else
[1:40:35] and then we have problems I might not
[1:40:39] know who I am okay
[1:40:41] but I but I
[1:40:43] I I can't find it you say it but it's
[1:40:47] it's it's some good stuff
[1:40:49] you know
[1:40:51] when we become
[1:40:53] new and I'm going to finish with this
[1:40:55] one
[1:40:56] in Christ Jesus and Christopher Jesus
[1:40:59] the Bible says
[1:41:01] old things
