just our father he was our father in The Gospel the founder of this church and I want to give my condolences to you the church that was founded by our founding Pastor Brothers we give you our condolences in a good way though it hurts in one sense we are so much at peace everything that he taught us what he showed us why this is our time right it's our time to put out what we have received is and as we have heard many times what are you going to do same thing we've been doing what was the Holy Ghost given foreign [Applause] we thank you once again Psalms 116 15 says you'd be surprised how many people sent me this scripture Psalms 116 15 116. it says precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints now I many times don't understand why I do what I do I don't understand many times the decisions I make though I do all that I can to make sure that I'm in the will of God I found myself in San Diego this past weekend those of you that know uh know our founding Pastor that was his favorite place to go and uh thank you for the Tommy and his his uh family my wife also yeah me esposa um we we found ourselves there in San Diego looking and remembering at all of all the things that we had done there he would tell us those of you that know of course he was in the Navy there we're thankful to brother Jimmy Garcia and brother brother Steve Phillips and they were they took us I had never been there they took us to Los Angeles and uh I I got to see something I had never seen before and that was the sculpture of Moses that that Michelangelo did you know everything that everything is there's a purpose and there's a reason behind it all yeah and uh thank you Aaron and Abby that went with us also as we as we saw him and and then we saw the sculptor of David and looking at those things I knew that uh that uh my pops uh is the Earthly Journey was coming to an end I came across it there at and it's called Uh it's called Forest Lawn is that right or islamencionado and uh and there I saw there was this sculptor of a bunch of images different people and on the bottom of that sculpture those sculptors were there was it was engraved The Mystery of Life and there I I received some some consolation some comfort because I remembered at my mother's funeral I believe it was brother that preached that message and there I was standing in front of this sculpture is the message The Mystery of Life the next day brother Bernie preached the message at her funeral the mystery of death he just to see that it brought so much comfort to me and uh there as as brother Tommy had had driven and I was I had we had gone in the uh through the airplane he was able to make it back I'm over there on Monday everyone and uh anyways we we uh we were grateful to the Lord there's there's a purpose behind it all and I'm gonna let you all know later on I just want to throw this out for you but God is our witness the moment I cross this Valley is he left and Henry says you were on that Southwest Air uh that that that Airline weren't you yeah you were it was about 236 or so that you crossed the valley I said yes sir you can see he says I was up there too lying around I was up there at the same time he said I felt I knew when he had left and so to let you know we did make it but I'm I I'm grateful to the Lord as I know we all are for his life and I think we are all indebted to the Lord because of such a man that he that he uh placed us under yes we have said the greatest man that I have ever met ever seen that I have ever known my Pops I we sure will miss him what a man a great Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ wonderful and great pastor pastor God gave us the best whether some say it or don't say it is not neither here nor there is he did not give everyone Apostles the Bible said he gave some of them and we are the sum yes I'm grateful to God for that he gave us the very best and you know I can always say and I can I can say this well because our founding Pastor so many people always thought he was just some proud man but he was proud there was not a man there was not a man who who always said that God gave him the best you would always say no matter where he was at God gave me the best children Familia he gave me the best Church in the whole world he would say those things oh he's just a proud man not in a bad way oh my sons are the best my children are the best and everywhere he went that's what he would say the very best he bragged about every one of you is that I have the best friends and boy has that been shown true we thank the Lord for for his life we thank the Lord for a wonderful friend that he that God gave him and uh he has been a true friend we're grateful to each one of you look around and if I probably start naming and I and I'll I'll leave somebody out this is people that have been faithful that are still here you look at those things by Uncle Mike and sis and hanika Mike brother Abraham Ruth and uncle Ross and and on and on we can go that were with him from cochio days yes all the way to all of you that have been here Silver City the Silver City cruises Las Cruces and through it all you all have stood and I as your pastor take my hat off to you all know I will say thank you for loving us gracias thank you for loving our father thank you for loving us we appreciate you and I just want to give you a clap and if you want to clap for yourself and we can go on and on as I said geez sister Bell he's wow Brother Jimmy's sister Anna sister Rosita and here I am and all of you I'm going to leave somebody out but all of you the Carlos back there that's you it's awesome great to be able to look out and see what God has done brought us from and where he's still taking us tonight it's going to be a little bit different I uh I I have a list of men and if you're not on the list just just we'll we'll try to do this again on Sunday a little Memorial um that okay with everyone just to remember tonight and Sunday of the great man that God placed but before before we do I simply I simply want to put a for the Ronnie sent us an audio of our pastor uh we want to play it and if they got the words up there also we we want you to hear this from him foreign already it's already already yeah [Laughter] yeah amen amen may God bless you amen we'll give you the information on the funeral and so forth at the end some of the men to just say a few words and what what he meant amen God bless you all this evening you know they always say what do you what do you say about a man like brother Tomas Peres but you know I never I never ran out of things to say about him like our Pastor said he is the greatest man I've ever known I think to quote my uncle Tommy he's the greatest man ever put on boots do you ever wear pants or socks he is the greatest man I've ever known and you know he had he had four boys but in reality he had a whole lot more because he adopted me he was my dad he was my lawyer he was one of my best friends Amigos he meant the world to me yes and I I I can't think of a time in my life where he wasn't there I look back as far as I can think uh Ben biens and I just see the chief he was he was our leader he's our leader and and and I I just I thank the Lord I'm so grateful to God because everything that he taught us all those years that we sat under him was for this momentum it was for the moment that he wouldn't be here anymore and it was so that the work that he started will continue and I I thought about what scripture that would that would work in in in this situation is Luke 24 32 Lucas did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us along the way you know we we have we can share a lot of stories and things that that you know what happened in the mission field and so on yeah but to me the most valuable time I ever had with him was was after the preaching was over the big meetings would dismiss this was and we'd all go down just a group of menones and he would relax and he'd just start to talk and it reminded me of when Jesus would talk to the disciples because the words and the things that he would say they were so profound profundas he was so far ahead of all of us that a lot of times I think we struggle to keep up yeah this is but he was just such an incredible man I'm sorry is and he touched all of our lives in in not just one way I think that's what made him so incredible yes was that no matter where you were at in your life what you were going through he was the high priest he was the one that became God in flesh and you just knew that if you could get to the chief yes no matter what it was in life didn't matter the challenge or the problem if you could get the chief just that it would be all right I just want to say I love him and he meant the world to me significa [Applause] is I want to read a scripture but before I do as we read this scripture I want you to realize that the person that's important to me is the man that represents Paul the person as we heard from our pastor it was our pastor our friend and Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ Apostles and as I was thinking in scripture came to me is second Corinthians chapter 3 verses one through three do we begin to commend ourselves or need we as some others the Epistles of commendation for you are letters of commendation from me recommendations this is me brother Tommy speaking to me ER our epistle escritas in our hearts nuestros corazones known and read about Los Hombres Juarez we are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ o ministered by us otrus written not with ink is but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables my personal testimony with testimonial personal just want to mention one little part of it to you um very crucial time in my life I was in a message church in El Paso Texas so nobody get any thoughts I mean this was way brother Adolfo was in Fort Worth Texas somewhere it was almost seven Fort Worth Texas and my wife and I went through some trials the enemy came in to try to destroy the church and I remember men like brother Fabio Romano Fabio brother Tommy no Tommy in November after the meetings in Phoenix in Phoenix they would come and minister to us many many memories but on our personal note not that personal it came to a time in my life where I had to make a decision or I could see that our spiritual life might die spiritually and I remember my wife being pregnant with Lydia is every Sunday or seven months 5 30 in the morning to go to services in Silver City at Silver City when I came to that crucial time to make that decision not knowing what would happen not knowing whether he would even accept me in Silver City in Silver City or accept me you know and so I had this conversation with him one Sunday after service we went to his house to eat and then we got in his band and we rode in the neighborhood result it's a church so he parked because you know and he looked at me straight in the eyes and I said I I would like to be under your ministry ministerio I made this decision that we we need to to move he is [Music] but I don't know what you think about it respect he didn't say nothing can I just look let's implement the middle and looked at me and he said I don't want you here I'll never forget that is I said well maybe I better be quiet and you should try he's doing this because Iglesia but I don't Prosper like Noah I don't know number two you identify yourself with me the identification and what God has given me the ministry that God has given me the administered he goes all hell will break loose he said you think I want that for you he's very direct muy director something that I I always loved about him he would just tell me the way it is but if it's a revelation of God to you soon welcome to Soccer City and I'll never forget that then I knew that I would be written in his heart and as I finish I can say from that time on he never treated me any different than even his own son yes he treated me this like what I was one of his and that's why this scripture means a lot to me is [Music] nobody was going to take us out of it we're so thankful to speak a few words there so much that could be said [Applause] laughs man God bless you love them amen I think one thing that you're gonna find in common tonight is everyone that comes up here is going to tell you how close they were to him he always made us feel very special each one of these men sombres he gave them their value there's the old uh we could tell many stories you know I remember one time we were here I was here with brother Caleb recording and brother Tommy had came into town and he was so excited and he was telling us about the message that you have preached on Mount Transfiguration and it was he's like that that to him brother Danny was the greatest man we don't choose he gave us our value I remember one of the greatest memories I have another this Memorial I was a young Minister I think it was 1999 and we're we're in Peru estamos in Peru and we're all lined up behind the pulpit in time for the minister to come up and he looks down the line it looks the other way attention you know we don't have time to get ready I got behind the pulpit and I started preaching I was nervous you know and I was I I was going to town yes and all of a sudden it repented I hear someone yelling behind me and he said hit him with the Roar of the lion he said that is and talking about the power of God falling you know that's the value he gave us but to give you a vision of that story that message that I preach is you know a young man had got this tape and and he said that he gave that's all he had for a year he was in the jungle two years he was in the jungle and that's the only thing he had to sustain himself all because he gave us our value he was so proud of us no I remember when I went into the Marine Corps I still go back and I look back and I wonder is because he was so proud of me you know when I would come back home he would take me to his office and it was my picture that was in his office because we had a special connection you know when I was in sin he would write me one letter every month and that's what keep me keep me alive but today we stand as men and a saints of God you know we're we're not no little boys anymore but he showed us how to be men of God he showed us how to fight he showed us how to love God's peoples and that's why we're able to stand today because that very seed that he planted inside of us it's already produced life and it's my privilege yes you call my pastor yeah Pastor you call my friend you know I tell this to the guys all the time you know I never knew him as Uncle Tommy we never had that opportunity none of us here he was always our pastor always our friend Mr Amigo and today we could stand and the Very life that we have today because of that man I want to give all glory can you give one to the Lord foreign [Applause] foreign amen and I bless each and every one of you man I'd like to start off by reading this uh very familiar uh Bible scripture is uh Psalms chapter 23 verse 1 Salomon the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he may get me to Lion Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leads me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake amen amen what a what a Shepherd we had amen and I'm not going to say we had because we still have a an incredible Shepherd amen you know one thing we could all say a bunch of things about brother Tommy Tomas well one of the things that always stood out to me was how balanced brother Tommy was he knew when to be a certain way at a certain time he knew not to be he wasn't too religious he would stick with the word of God he would he was a jokester sometimes he knew how to get he knew how to get he knew how to be at your level to to get to you I I one of the things that that stood out to me it's kind of funny but I remember I had broke my hand once he my hand was all wrapped in a in a cast uh you know I was like and if he if he sees this and and he finds out that I punched a telephone pole is I was young and I didn't know how to handle some problems okay but anyway he um here I ran into him in the hotel room in the hallway and I said oh my Lord he's gonna get me in his room and he's gonna get the scriptures he's just gonna Hammer me with it and I was like all right I'm going to be ready for it because I deserve it but he did the complete opposite he said uh we're walking one way together we're walking like this and he says hey let me let me see your let me see your arm your hand and I went like so you know he gets my hand and he's like what happened and by then I'm like oh man I know brother Caleb told him say oh yeah so I'm like um uh he uh I gotta tell one more just just real quick but I remember one time he was a jokester too right so uh I had bought a truck a real bright colored truck and I'm a pastor's already shaking his head so I'm not gonna look that way but uh where I go to his house you know and I'm all proud I'm gonna show brother Caleb yeah come over remember my dad's this is I go in the house and me and brother Caleb are going to come out through the garage brother Tommy was still I don't know two minutes behind us or whatever getting ready and uh so we go out and I show Bill Caleb I'm proud you're right check it out Pastor oh mira mira Pastor he's like wow that's a nice truck and he said it like that yes do that oh no well in that time as he says so brother Tommy's come coming out right next to brother what a beautiful color it is hey tell them well brother Caleb said he don't like it to him he likes those boring colors that was the balance that he had yes he knew how to be at somebody's level and you know I remember one time going through a hard time going through a rough time and this was the kind of person that he was when he when he had to be and I had some problems that I was dealing with and uh uh I'm telling them a certain something and when uh some somebody had come into the room and said hey we need to do this at this time and he looked at what the most serious face he said cancel it one of my men needs help so we're not leaving here no no until we fix it and and that touched my heart is something that I'll never forget and just just in closing here I remember uh years ago if it's okay brother Caleb I had a uh years ago right before he got sick I had a small dream um I um I'm gonna say probably about seven to eight months before before he got sick um and I never I never said it because but today today just when they asked me to speak it came back to my my remembrance and I remember in this dream I saw brother Caleb and brother Tommy they were kind of hugging keep in mind this is seven to eight months before he got sick and uh I just heard brother Caleb say no and then I blink and then I got I was closer to them and I could hear what he was saying brother Tommy was telling him I have to go yeah I have to go and brother Caleb was holding him he was he was grabbing I still need you here and right when you got about halfway equals he got about halfway and um brother Caleb I'm sorry he looked at him and he looked to his left brother Caleb was on the left hand side now it's your turn to take care of church when he said that brother and brother Tommy kept on walking yeah he walked forward he never looked back it's time for the unfolding of that is [Applause] amen God bless you this evening yeah and my brother Tommy I believe I was about 16 or 17. you know and uh you know I I don't know if it's just yes I don't know if it's good or bad yes but there's times I see people and I investors not now okay don't not not any of you here no not in the aqui but I would say you know what I I don't care for that Persona you know and and the first time the first time I met brother Tommy La primeroes I felt a connection and and this is and myself I I was never I never knew the message or see me for me you could say I was Catholic but I never went to church but but I felt a connection and you know and getting to know him you know you know as a pastor of the church you know I I I've come across certain you know maybe before that certain certain uh I guess you could say they they would go to church you know but but what stood out to me was he never made me feel that he was above me um that he was better than me even though I was doing what what I was doing at that time he never looked down on me but he he came to my level and he made me and he made me feel I was just as good as he was you understand what I'm saying he never walked around with his nose up in the air yeah but he made me feel better that he was at my level and that's what drew me to him I guess I could say he didn't know me but I felt the love from him already because he was a loving man you know you the first time I went out on a missionary trip with him you hear you hear all these stories when you actually experience when you actually are out there and you experience then you know that God is real and out in the mission field yeah is where I saw the god in this man yes how much he would give what he would give for the people the love he had for the people not just in here but for the people out there the love El Amor and that's what I saw in this is because I was in lovable but he loved me Amo he gave his life for me he sacrificed for me he sacrificed for you and I that we could be here today and not stop the work but we can continue because what he left us we can go and run with it also tambien that was the man that I knew is that he would give you the shirt off his back you know I I remember one time I I had just gotten married and I lived paytech paycheck to paycheck the the I believe I had my first child but uh I didn't have money to buy a stroller and he says you don't have a stroller I said no no here go buy a stroller that's the love for the people yes but not just the money but giving the words giving the giving the word of God and I would like to read this scripture because I believe that this is the life that he that he that he lived Romans 8 1 Romanos Uno there is therefore now no Camden condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit is for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death Jesus you know we we have many we can have many examples in this world you know they you know the Sports everything there movie stars Los Deportes de Hollywood we have many examples we can have many examples but to me the greatest example that I have ever seen is our founding pastor Pastor there can be no other greater example to me you know probably the greatest man that I have ever known you know because I I never had a really close relationship with my father and I I literally hated the the man I I I hated him law or the other for years and I talked with our founding Pastor one day and he said he says I don't know what you your situation but whatever your father has done you still gotta honor him he says you got to forgive him whether he asked for it or not and one day I just said you know what Lord take it away and I felt such a pressure come off my shoulders those are the words of wisdom you know um when when uh talk about being prepared Orlando preparado I remember the first time I ever spoke we came down from Silver City Benin was the Silver City I think it was in in Messiah right brother Dan uh in Messiah so I'm driving down and I'll say yeah I'm gonna hear a great message so I walk in the building and he says so you're going first is and uh brother Tommy hermano Tomas it's not he always I I preached the service uh for my grandfather and now at the end I I told my grandfather I'll see you later and he was quick to get me as soon as I got down he said let's not see you later brother Tommy until we meet again amen God bless [Applause] God bless you tonight I'm going to try to maintain my composure here because just like everyone else greater man I have known I look back you know as I as I pondered on brother Tommy Tomas not thinking about his death the impact that he had on everybody and I look back and I always remember this is when we moved to Silver City we had a hard time here in Las Cruces my dad at the time was was really heavy on drugs brother Alex Solis and sister Vita in our past Solis and told us just go to visit us in Silver City stay with us in Silver City stay with us for two weeks I want you to come to church with us just to see what it's about lo and behold he so so we get there we got the privilege and the honors to go to church and and from that day the first time my mother fell in love with the message so my mom was not leaving anymore so we ended up moving to Silver City Silver City so you know just to look at the man that he is you know like I said my mother fell in love with the kind of person that he was you know one of the greatest things that I know is I remember one time in Colombia in Colombia it was after a service and he was praying for people praying for people as he was leaving praying for people outside we had to physically restrain him and get him into the bus so one of the greatest scenes I've ever seen so he's fighting with us because he wants to get to the people he says just fighting to get to them I remember how blunt he was when his wife passed away remember that time and it was a sad times but I was already hooked I had to get to him I would hang around him I would hang around hang around outside his office Junior would take me to the office just to say hi to him so because there's something a long lasting impression Impressions because there was a truth to him the scripture says yes you receive a righteous man and he told more than ever before you know so many things and discussed that and I don't want to get into because I won't even finish rough times in our lives when things were happening when I needed something was
