14th message on the rapturing condition it's a condition that rap and I want to put a subtitle this morning two of the crowning of our life a poor subtitle okay dopin le leçon oracion that's my prayers is that we we make the rapture Corona Corona and I believe that we are in the rapture you know que estamos en el grabber the first part and la première birthing but I believe or I as I say I I don't want anyone to be lost nokey dokey now didn't appear that and I don't want us to miss it in okay Rimouski later in order to get into rupturing condition if I'm threatened condition thereafter we got to make sure that we examine ourselves tenemos que ser Serrano's they examine our to see who is crowning our life mister Nando nostra Vita so if we can turn to the book of first Corinthians it was Diego a primera equity into 11th chair during the 28 verse copy Thrones ever snow in Kyoto you have it you can say men when the low tendency point they see the man I bless my friend brother Jerry you know me amigo he just joined the 50 club I come and throw a group of us in Quentin it's a man bad so man first Corinthians 11:28 reads like this 170 or shortly se but let a man examine his neighbor what a private cockiness we see no no we're good at that huh let him a man examine the brothers and sisters in the church I mean I lost hermanos in nicosia my Bible says let a man examine himself me release a portal to privacy cada uno cities and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup Akuma see del pon de la copa me God had his blessings to the reading of his words you may be seated supposing there's nobody that's in a hurry this morning are you nothing by the priests esta mañana the very word examine la palabra examine are simply means to test get a sip robot to approve yep revoir it means to discern the certain need or try oneself oh no miss mom and we examine ourselves you know sex I mean ammo as I said is because by doing so porque se endo tally it is showing us who is the one that is crowning our life okay so my striking is that qhorin and honest and it's either God or saying Amen also there's no other there's no one else that's who it is nothing masters either God or say in his crown in your life is the oh so certain task or know something I want them to before we get going I want them to put up there they would the the the definition of crowning here kapangan a a finish there's so many different different definitions but I wanna I want you to catch this one here ok Captain esta crowning is representing a level of surpassing achievement Coronado is represented only veiled a Sabra an attainment supreme I go to stake I'll cancel or are Suprema and when you talk about crown cuando la coruna crown then means an ptosis Coronel KITT is here do you have the the word crown up there there we go crown is the distinction that comes from a great achievement these things Bianca viene después de un grande Lago crown is the power or dominion of a sovereign a still poder of the Meno that goes over I know it is the highest or most nearly perfect state of anything SLS Thomas Alto Oh Cassie todo it is the supreme source of Honor excellence and beauty it lets - pretty much went to the or not excel in severe Masuda crown is to be at the top or the highest part of this territory lastima the last part is myself tests and crown is the leaves and living branches of a tree so unless no has eluded us was do not will when we talk about crowns and Thrones in the Bible when the lamas they throw knows the corona they're not associated with angels no Stella so Sione no that is Qantas Arianism talk about angel and there's no crowns and Thrones are not associated with them Laura Secord honest you know sittin crowns and Thrones are associated with men turn no Sakura associate an hombre we I have been partakers of flesh and blood and Macedo participant is Academy and to him that overcometh ya quelques win Sierra will I grant to sit with me in my throne narek se siente allow the olden crowns and Thrones have to do with you and I don't know Sakura not me believe me I couldn't legally could instead amen and we're here this morning for that one reason is that most a kiss the man up what is the rest because we want to examine ourselves heroic sent me not me you know those miss I think it's a good time to preach on this your case tiempo de pista because I believe all the graduates could not have graduated porque ellos no lo que mi Leslie had taken their exams no for the mother never I mean and through life we we have a lot of different achievements I mean most muchos locos we can go back as far as when we first learned to walk what an achievement huh come on Kandra siena planned demos that come in our film gram they went to school and now it nowadays they have G you can almost go from the hospital to take your child to a school somewhere all right I got as soon as this Allendale hospital they have okay free pre-k and and all these other schools that they have for the children didn't predict ended and every time they do they they finish up their Chiefs they they finish the year they graduate because I didn't do nine your sake another one so then then then they go to kindergarten and then they graduate from kindergarten you know what I mean then they go to to the fifth sixth grade and they graduate they graduate class do they graduate you know you're gonna last I go on and on then you go to two different levels of college you know what you got was Nevada are you waiting or looking for that final exam so that we can show what we have achieved thirteen point you can don't spin out examine it's no different with the things of the Lord know if I didn't take honors courses the deal that is from faith to faith porque almost a fair way we go from achievement to achievement almost a no I'll go we come so far in our life and and then it's up to us to decide whether we're gonna we're gonna have a continuing education or not to seek a the most continued all different in the spiritual no I difference in who's coming to that place with God and then we're gonna have to decide do we want to go any farther or not check Amazon lugar con Dios I was in up here we've have to be here do we really want to go farther Misaki okay I much continue and when we look at that you can do me Thomas we have to realize then I must get word here once again to examine ourselves it's almost a keeper X I mean are these message that are coming forth attention to explains all about getting a bride prepared the trattoria prepared I wanna know via they hurt they hurt really yeah these messages its dwelling time before they hurt how many how many how many know that what does have a nice home see it was everybody's had they hurt they're uncomfortable in stone the second so mean como ellos dwelling yes I mean especially in church you see the message come forth and people are hoof got me there miss Ellen but let me tell you ain't nobody escaping right there are nice they mask upon we hear these messages or emotions that make us uncomfortable it has been weaned oma but one thing that they do really do is they cause us to take inventory I don't know cause I see cows on cameras they seem bent at ease they cause us to examine ourselves you know six M&M Mo's and not just the bodies no sólo los cuerpos but we must examine our body our spirit and our soul good honest with speed to yell at them it is so important that we examine ourselves it's an important text I mean and we gotta see where we are failing the name is karellen don't tell estamos they run the relations five and I have many scriptures so I pray that you have your your Bibles ready but Galatians 5:13 says for brethren ye have been called unto Liberty was what was there - anyway that is you're my only three people do we have a sense more and Evi we have been called to Liberty it was the gemellus eleven only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh como Castillo para la carne but by love serve one another she knows that we para el amor de who knows what is it telling us here chemist is don't use your Liberty gnosis will avert and see how you can benefit your flesh but America move on and if these years to come but use your Liberty notice to leave and see how you can serve someone else with love from you know cause your parents that we
