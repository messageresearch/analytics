bless you before i begin he's been very very good to us to be here in this church that is so special to us we appreciate the invitation brother caleb gave to us and to the ministry that backs him up he for the invitation to be able to be here with each one of you [Music] it's an honor and a privilege for me i bring a greetings from the church alvaro lagos he has much respect for each one of you my wife is accompanying me at this time and my children [Applause] is i'm originally from guadalajara mexico [Music] i was born in the year 1974 many years ago and in my infancy possibly in during my my teenage years i remember when they would do the conventions in guadalajara phoenix university i would see the ministry of phoenix and silver city many ministries [Music] [Music] during that time i can say that we were part of that that seed that was planted back then how god raised up a man and did a great impact in our lives during our teenage years that impacted our lives every time a brother thomas palestinian would go tommy junior would accompany him brother jimmy and sometimes our maybe you're a lot more familiar than i am when you preach the atomic bomb of god they caused a revolution preaching on inheritance but the way to know our brother caleb for standing at that time he was still in silver city that should be the name of the lord this i asked if you would stand to your feet let us read the scriptures the word of god reads said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul brothers close your eyes let us pray to god this morning beloved heavenly father thank you lord for giving us the opportunity to speak a little bit on my word now that you would take complete supreme control of our lips and also our ears i also asked for my interpreter bless him while he speaks so the people can hear in their own language and they can also be blessed to you will be the honor of the glory after the service thank you for all your blessings we love you mr this morning i have a small thought uh this i was inspired [Music] i was hearing a tape or brother a brother bernie garcia and from there i got to start the word controversial comes from the word controversy there's a problem about something then we can say when a person controversial than a controversial person someone that provokes a debate [Music] automatically is converted they're made into a controversial person because the religious system we have today on the earth it has its everything they think that they're successful in a way organization they're organizations the way that they function by the grace of god the prophet is not that way or an agreement with them because at this time we believe that the holy ghost is for many people it causes problems where are you from how do you identify yourself i'm a christian you say automatically that creates controversy is an image of how the religious world should act when you identify because it wasn't given to them we go against the current of the religious realm by the grace of god he has permitted us to know the gospel in a supernatural way that the rain was not known at that time it wouldn't rain how is it that your message says we're going to die by a flood there's going to be a great flood we're even when the lord jesus christ was here he had the god of because they went against the it was a controversial that accepts the if anyone wants to follow me now that's controversial brother what are the conditions and if i'm a young person to have my own cell phone car my own car those are my rights i'll leave that there to serve the lord yeah why do you dress this way or do you have very big muscles maybe or yes oh that closes features so you can show off your fingers oh you're you're back the one that tells you more is the mirror it is given you to kill responsibility your responsibility take your cross take it with you establishment you deny yourself why against the current at work we'll lose it and whosoever will lose his life for myself shall find it this causes more controversy all the world wants to save their life what do you mean we're going to lose it i want to save my own life but if i want to save it it says i'm going to lose it but if you lose and he speaks on a character in the message of leadership going out and he he came and he bounced off to the lord he says good master he tells him what shall i do to inherit eternal life watch what he asks him good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life jesus is the man that's that's bowed down for him good master master all these things all these things i have done since i was a young man he was a man that knew the word he was a special man jesus looking at him he said jesus loved him says well tells him he said okay it's okay so all that you have give it to the poor and you have the treasure in heaven come and follow me commando taking up your cross the scripture says that he went away very afflicted or sad because of these words because he had much possessions it catches my attention the qualities and the characteristics of this man a tremendous man since his youth special very special principal he was a principal a prince or a like an important person and this time we could say maybe a certain ruler reputation with knowledge of the scripture educated in the word of god and obedient but one thing that he lacked he didn't have nothing he did not have eternal life all these qualities maybe each one of us would have said with those qualities look at the way he the way he uh uh the way he is is a the prophet tells us in the message leadership that this young this uh the rich ruler yes it's the one with that that's that's with a rich man and with lazarus every day was just poor it's not unfair he was sick he said he had boils all over his body he said the scripture says that even the dogs would come in with much influence you know yeah and another one over here like like a like a wanderer sick or in our sight or eyes so look at this poor man and look at this great man over here man it was controversial the scripture says that this man died the prophet says that this this person this rich man what am i going to do i'm going to put all these things into the storehouses and when i live all these years i could say oh just for your soul rest rejoice i have much goods what are they going to do with all you've accumulated the prophet says this man was the same man with the rich man in lazarus when he was in hell he was being tormented and he got to see allah he got to see lazarus who is hermano you you don't think it's just a parable if you abraham being refreshed he was a son of abraham a tremendous man brother certain just to put an example when a person has a genuine encounter with the lord your life changes completely intellectual but when you have an intellectual encounter it also that also has its fruits and you yourself are going to identify with those fruits mental conception intellectually maybe you're not going to say it but you're going to feel it why because you want to be better than someone else he's not humble elevated person of a formal person so so formal and so so he thinks that no one can teach him maybe he doesn't say it but when whoever extends up behind the pulpit what is the brother gonna teach me today there's people that get irritated very quickly you can't tell him anything because he's it's not his fault always they're not a mass nothing else the grace of god he has a tendency to to care for others he celebrates it's allegra and he he's joyful when somebody achieves something this person is a servant he's humble and he's ready he's ready to learn from everyone [Applause] a genuine the scripture uh is there's no juvenile delinquency father delinquency because that puts it on us yes what is my position what is my position if you're a housewife god has called you but you help your family you put your stand before your husband great take care that's your position is to try to get everyone in everyone that i can get i'm trying to get them in this life you only have a short we're people that cause problems he's had so many sayings that they had a much significance in my language one of the things that he would say it's better so that's why my notes every time someone speaks that way it's by experience the experience of god has given them with this all close brothers yes and these messengers and they all had a purpose look brothers there was an apocalypse he says we read in revelation 16 what the vials represent is on the euphrates river this is cool and it dried up the receptive one hand but the seventh angel and here i was speaking to the brother jerry the back there on the back uh uh before my accusers when it's filled up the teaching when the prophet brothers the same thing jesus said it is finished it is finished it's done what does he say that's what it says the voice of the days of the voice of the seventh angel and that convincing you become a voice told the greatest blessings that the bride of the lord jesus christ is the grace of god the grace of god supporting the people sent you free please pray to the lord [Applause] let us pray brother the greatest thing which is the holy spirit let us pray brothers father

you know you know they they as this war started you know they they uh were looking for the young men from 18 all the way up to 60 years old and many of the of the sons of different believers were taken to defend their country yeah your prayers there was something in one of the testimonies that they sent testimonies even though we don't we don't want war and we want want to be peace all the time if we could put all our differences to one side you know that that's why there will be there'll be even though we've been squeezed this whole time we're going to taste a little bit of it the

to the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord amen what i think it is as we bring these little ones to him as they put him into when jesus was here they would put him these children into his arms jesus the lord had given the life of these babies now the parents were coming back to give the life of the baby back to jesus when they come back with their baby and they say thank you lord for the life of my child i want their life to be a blessing

sharon and brother marcos marcos i'm going to ask you to come we don't do things like we do in like they do in the world we uh we don't we we don't date ah no we uh record and that so a while back as our pastor was was doing a presentation or or 25-year something something of that nature or just an anniversary by by uh brother titus and it was something that was so so outstanding to me and she says i prayed for you before i even knew you and so we we are trusting in the lord today the book of colossians tells us that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding and of the father and of christ in whom are here all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walking in him asian rooted and built up in him and and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving the prophet of god told us this now the church now is engaged to christ for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the lamb so we see that the church is now engaged like a man engaged to his wife what does he do while they're engaged he's just bestowing all kinds of things sending her presents making her feel good well that's what christ is doing to his church he's sending us gifts of the spirit how can we you be engaged engaged then when you're denying these gifts exist it's the very love tokens it's god's token to the church jesus said these signs shall follow them that belief so we're grateful my grandmother would say my grandmother would say every part has its own lid so we're grateful to the lord for that happy i pray that that the lord will give you what me and my wife have experienced we will celebrate 38 years this year my papa is the one that that they got us together i didn't have i he told me that that's your wife and we're very happy today is yes brother you happy sister let's see the gifts of the engagement wow is a nice one don't be blinded brother mark i know that little spark god god but it's beautiful and uh we're going to pray pray with you for you god will bless you
