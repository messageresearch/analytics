kids is excited to be in children's church yeah awesome awesome you may be seated you maybe see it it's such a privilege to be here I am a man sent from God a man sent from God and I want to see if you guys can guess who I am so I'll give you a hint I'm uh I'm a character from the Old Testament kind of the Old Testament clothes clothes I think we all have beards back dance solid they all look the same but uh okay little bit after Moses Hughes maybe he was one of the judges and God called him to be a mighty man of Valor mighty man availeth Joshua you were close someone said it in the back say it again no it starts with a G up I'm al parents oh you're wrong okay I am Gideon and I am a man sent from God you know back in my time it was hard let me come down talk to you during my day it was pretty rough you know why because the children of Israel they were like the world like this today the children of Israel they turned their back on God they decided hey I got a better idea I want to get a another God so they adopted a god named veil which is not so there's a there's a commandment right says thou shalt have no other gods before me and they were doing the opposite so God what God did he sent in some Midianites he sent in the Midianites and what they did is they were like grasshoppers they were everywhere come on boys come help him out come on hop I'm out there a grass life they were every a Michael Ben and they were Scotty just plundered villages left things around you know hey Scott this is my food for winter hey and so they would come through the VIP and they would take more than just little fruit they would take cattle hey what's going take they would take the joy that I have with the lure you know they like the devil when he comes you young kids in school right does anybody have a hard time in life or school or yeah what do you struggle with brother okay I can't help you there but anyways just like the world what do you struggle with maybe with kids at school that make fun of you right maybe they fool you does anybody get bullied yeah yeah my brothers would bully me all the time you can't cry about it but just like just like the Midianites would come they would bully the children of Israel why because they chose the Israelites chose you serve a different God so God says fine I'll teach you a lesson so they did this for about seven years seven years kind of a long time so they're Gideon is kind of sick of it you know someone was sick of it some of are sticking to their gods and so here comes Gideon and one day there's a man that meant it Madame underneath an oak tree it was an angel I met him from an oak tree here's my angel come in the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor o Lord if you're with us then we're bein Thal your miracles you know we know you Lord we know we knew God that came and you brought it the children out of Israel or out of Egypt Egypt was the mightiest nation on the earth and God did that where be you go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hands of the Midianites have not i sent thee said o my lord but i am poor I'm the poorest family Manasseh and in my father's house I was the least surely I'll be with thee and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man Oh Lord if I found grace in thy sight let it be that I can bring a present for thee so here comes here I get in I went and I made a kit of cake cakes prepared a kid for this for this angel and it knows that the angel at the time and so I came in I and I I brought it to the angel and he told me to place it upon this rock because they asked him ask the angels prove to me that you're from the Lord so he told me to place it on this rock and there on the rock the angel put his staff and the and the the offering burnt up and was consumed this man is from the Lord take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth so that's what I did so now so sounds funny right so I just wanted a sign from the Lord okay Gideon's got it no hey this guy's not just pulling him around alright cuz I've been messed around by a bunch of these guys over here so I got to make sure you know so the so the angel the Lord is commissioning Gideon to go out and save the Lord is commissioning Gideon to go out and save his people right and his people don't want to even be saved they want to turn to bail and so what a Gideon did God said don't be afraid so he goes to this big ol statue of bail and he takes it and he tears it all down and then he takes his father's his father's animals and offers it as a burnt offering to the Lord and so what do you find in the morning that the people of the city are mad they're super mad they're like hey would you do to my statue what you do to my xbox I loved it why'd you take it away from me but Gideon was happy because he said because before you could do anything before the Lord could use them you got to take all the garbage out all right you got to take all the garbage whatever that's not of the Lord that's talking back to your parents it likes to talk back to their parents hey I won't look you know when I was a kid and my parents right there yeah I was very disrespectful yes God take that garbage out that's a bunch of garbage and I look and I see my parents right they're wonderful people and I thank God for them every day but you got to go and take the garbage out Bible says honor thy father and mother so alright checkmark so here we go so so we go and we take all the garbage out now we're ready to fight we want to get some people to for battle who's ready to fight in the army of the Lord who wants to fight in the army of Lord can I get some participants don't be shy don't be shy so come up if you want to fight even all that yeah come on the kids come on children let's fight let's fight assemble we're gonna be the army of the Lord all right so this is what happens so so brother Josh can you play that trumpet so Gideon comes come on kids come on kids come on children if you want to children giggle army good job for the Josh can you play that audio clip so what Gideon got was was a horn [Music] [Applause] [Music] so was a declaration to gather all who ever wanted to fight we're tired of these Midianites let's get a kick him out right so there was about like 32,000 of them there was a lot all this is not 32,000 but okay well work with this is just first symbol so so God is looking I'm like wow 32,000 do you know how many people that is that's a lot right you can't even count it right there's not even there's like 250 200 people here okay so what happens God tells God tells Gideon there's not gonna work if you guys would go in triumphs then all the Israelites will go a think oh I did it check out check what I did God has nothing to do with me beating the enemy so sometimes Christians think that right God gives you a blessing and then you you're like oh God didn't do that I do that yeah so think guys like okay we'll see we'll see how you feel after something so what they did is they said you told the children of Israel if you guys are scared who's scared here not not okay just just just say let's say let's say let's just say you ladies you guys are scared to go in the back just say just say oh go ahead go ahead and sit down thank you thank you give my hand given half oh so that took about like twenty two thousand twenty two thousand trained army just left and everybody else is like why'd they do that we need we need the numbers we don't want to get beat so all right so God's like uh we still we still the vision isn't complete yet this is not what I saw so let's go to the let's go to the stream follow me let's go to the stream alright fine the stream there's a stream right here and if you guys we're gonna tip we're into a test those that are gonna drink for the stream how about you guys you guys can drink get on your knees and act like you're that good laughing it like a dog like a dog and you gentlemen get on one knee get on one knee and then pick the water up from you I mean those stream to your mouth okay keep doing so God said oh we're gonna do a test we're gonna see who's who's paying attention you guys are really good I gotta lie so you guys are done you guys so the Lord the Lord said those that are actually laughing like a dog those that don't care what's around them and they just see water I gotta get the water I gotta get my blessing first nobody else matters uh I gotta get it said those we don't we don't need no I I do need you but not right now okay I need you guys but not right now so those all right now we got about 300 men 300 men okay it doesn't look too good right come on guys come over here Coria oh yeah oh yeah so now guys like okay you got your army together we got your arm again we're doing pretty good and here I was confused Lord we started off with 32,000 why are we down to 300 you know why God did that so he could show his greatness to Israel so I can show him who was God right who was the greatest God on the universe not BHEL BHEL got knocked down by a man and didn't do anything about it cuz he's not real but God wanted a show man look you still are the apple of my eye still love you you still are my people you started the children of God let me show you what with me we can do so here we come here we come come on in the same come on this I and here we find the Midianites so you guys count there and before they went to battle Gideon said I need another sign from You Lord I need another sign from you so what he did he said lord if there be when I wake up in the morning if there be doo doo if there would be some rain some water droplets on this on this fleece if I have it here on the ground or give me a sign that you that I know you're with me that you given me the confidence and if there be do on on the fleece and the ground be dry I know that you have sent me so I woke up again that morning and sure enough the Lord never fails because the Lord miracles are not dead okay the days of miracles are not past I come to tell you I don't know if anybody else believes that but it sure happens so alright so the miracle happened but then I said Lord just one more sign or don't don't be angry with me one more sign so I can have my confidence with you I asked in the morning that if if that we do on the ground but the mic police will be dry then I know you truly has sent me so I woke up in the morning and sure enough the ground was sopping wet and I greet and my fleece was dry wow what confidence that the Lord had in me and now the Lord always had the confidence in me who knows that the Lord has confidence in you does anybody here you know sometimes we think or maybe maybe it's just me you know the Lord is like hey you can do this son I called you to do this and he's called you you people to serve Him and a lot of times were like no Lord you don't know what you don't know what I've gone through the Lord and he's like I actually do know what you gone through and so but he says that's why I have the confidence you because I know what choices you would make I know that you would choose to believe in me and so that's what I did the Lord had faith in me so I had faith in him so it's time to get the devil out right we had the Midianites common many nights come over here and you guys can camp around here so what the Lord told me all these Warriors were trained had swords big weapons but the Lord told me and I don't have any trumpets but this is my trumpet and I am my men I gave every man a trumpet the trumpet that we used you guys can kind of like sit down in the middle the trumpet thought we use what's called a shofar shofar and it was like a either sheeps horn around sworn I got a pronghorn sheep horn so we're close we're close but uh he gave every man a horn and he give every man a pitcher it was like a little pop okay like a clay pot and he also gave him a torch with an inside another clay pot and he said I want you to surround the Midianites meeting nights were camped in a in a in a big Valley and they were sleeping so let's surround the Midianites come on so you told him didn't camp around him and everyone had their their torch guys right there and there they were steep you know they were from the day they were enjoying our food our water probably eating our you know or beef our steak something like that anyways we were mad all right we want them out of our land so we don't care about them but right right now we're right with God we're doing what God has told us and we're gonna take back our land so he tells us what I want you to do you guys got to be willing to shout with me you ready we're gonna play our trumpet now yeah brother Josh we're gonna play the trumpet really loud I'm gonna break our pot I don't have a pot but we'll break it and we'll sound sound the trumpet really loud and we'll say the sword of the Lord end up Gideon you guys got it that's the plan so I want you guys to come over here camp around them this is what the Lord told me to do and there were thousands of them everywhere a huge old city and just over there on the mountain type so there they come for the Josh can you play the trumpet and the trumpet sounded a sword of the Lord and of Gideon a throne of the Lord and of Gideon a sword of the Lord and the Gideon you guys were scared and here the Midianites were confused they were so confused they started to fight him against themselves you guys can fight against yourself do it with honesty they were fighting against themselves they didn't know the Israelites didn't even touch him and here they come come over here guys come over here guys and they're running don't run foot and they were scared so then we chased him we hit him and they start running off and they were scared because they thought that every but there was about a billion of us coming after them get on or out of there devil and so that's what you got to do sort of the Lord and of Gideon thank you gentlemen can you all say it a sort of the Lord and of Gideon thorn of the Lord and of Gideon thank you gentlemen [Applause] you know what was amazing to me I've I've heard this story and hopefully I made sense to you all but what I saw is that you can kick the devil out anytime you want I don't know if you heard me you can kick the devil out anytime you want if you're feeling discouraged in your condition and say hey maybe you get picked on as a bully from school I don't know maybe that boy is the devil maybe it was the Midianites maybe it's your boss at your job maybe it's maybe one of your friends that is telling you to turn away from God and do bad things I don't know but what you need to do is is this they would use the shofar the shofar was a trumpet it was the Word of God and what it would have used to it would it sound symbolised it was this it would have symbolized the awakening of slumbering Souls I don't know if there's any so slumbering here that are sleeping that are dead that are dormant dirty souls that are like that year no okay good good I'm glad but if what it would do is awaken somebody's souls and give you courage and also it was meant to chase the devil away so in every what aspect of your life young kids you have the greatest weapon that our our pastor the ministers have that God has ever given us and that is his word and if the devil's bothering is eat maybe he's picking on you oh no today whenever I needed some I needed some encouragement today and just like Gideon an angel of the Lord visited me today you know what that angel was those are faster maybe maybe you only visited me maybe not anybody else here but you visited to me and he says Seth no mighty man of Valor who me you're talking about me I said yes you're the Bride of Christ Wow me you know but the Lord I did all these things how be it so if God is if God is with us where's all his miracles and he sure did show us today two nd you see all the people coming down and he says you want something you want to take back your joy well just it's right here you just have to come and grab it there's a song that says I'm taking back my joy taking back my peace I'm taking all the the things the devil stole for me I'm a blood-bought bonafide child of the king he wrapped me in his loving art made me royalty no matter what may come my way you can't turn me down I'll be sure ten hallelujah well I'm dancing on solid ground I'll take him back my joy I don't know about if a does anybody got their joy taking away from
