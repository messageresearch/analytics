[19:46] amen we want you to feel relaxed here
[19:48] tonight
[19:53] what you'll be able to get into God's
[19:55] word but where we could you know
[20:01] get to it but to understand it
[20:06] imagine I we're going to talk about the
[20:09] cup of the amorites a couple of the
[20:11] Gentiles and the cup of iniquity amen
[20:17] amen let's start and approach the author
[20:20] of this
[20:26] was gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[20:30] Celestial Senor or truly it's a
[20:32] privileged Lord that you've given us
[20:33] Lord
[20:35] you just come and Lord dig into your
[20:38] word
[20:40] find out where it puts us today lord
[20:44] it's not us but we know it's you tonight
[20:49] and your word is as much alive today as
[20:52] it was 2 000 years ago
[20:56] Lord we rely on you tonight
[21:00] take over and just bless your people
[21:03] tonight
[21:06] in your precious name we asked
[21:10] amen amen let's read the scripture let's
[21:13] turn to the Book of Revelations
[21:19] verse 4
[21:22] foreign
[21:29] and the woman was arrayed in purple and
[21:32] scarlet color
[21:34] and decked with gold and precious stones
[21:36] and Pearls have them golden having a
[21:39] golden cup in her hand full of
[21:41] Abominations and filthiness of her
[21:44] fornications
[21:59] amen you may be seated
[22:04] amen we have a lot of scriptures I don't
[22:06] want you standing um
[22:11] Danny so much let us turn to the Book of
[22:13] Matthew
[22:17] chapter 24 verse 12.
[22:32] and it reads like this and because
[22:34] iniquity shall bound the love of many
[22:37] shall wax hold it
[22:43] but he
[22:44] that shall endure until the end the same
[22:47] shall be saved messages
[22:52] and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be
[22:55] preached in all the world for a witness
[22:58] unto all nations then shall the End come
[23:01] is
[23:11] when ye therefore shall see the
[23:13] Abominations of desolation
[23:15] spoken of by Daniel the Prophet
[23:18] stand in
[23:19] the holy place
[23:21] whoso readeth let him understand
[23:31] in Tienda amen so if we could
[23:36] just
[23:39] try it all starts with the cup of the
[23:42] amorites and I know brother Abram's
[23:44] going to touch more on that
[23:46] is
[23:50] but we want to paint a picture tonight
[23:55] because God came to Abraham
[23:59] and he tells Abraham
[24:02] in four generations
[24:05] the people will be in bondage
[24:09] and he says but the cup of iniquity is
[24:12] not yet full
[24:16] he said I've given you this place
[24:21] but don't think about that right now
[24:27] that's not coming for four generations
[24:31] he says but when
[24:33] that cup is full
[24:37] then I'm gonna come
[24:39] and he says don't you worry about those
[24:41] amorites
[24:44] I'm going to take care of them
[24:46] so that's the picture we we want to
[24:50] to paint today
[24:53] but what if we change
[24:56] just one word
[25:00] just so we could better understand it
[25:06] of the Gentiles
[25:10] is not yet foreign
[25:17] we see
[25:18] vemos
[25:21] how God is telling Abram about
[25:27] but we want to look at the cup of the
[25:30] Gentiles so we could see what pertains
[25:32] to us
[25:37] as if we see and we say that the cup of
[25:40] the Gentiles is not yet full because
[25:45] but when it's full
[25:47] then there's an exit that's coming right
[25:51] that's why that's why we hear that
[25:54] that's why we come to preach the gospel
[25:58] we want to we want to be
[26:02] taken away right
[26:06] he's telling us
[26:10] don't worry that's not for you to worry
[26:13] about it
[26:14] because when the cup of the Gentiles is
[26:17] full foreign
[26:28] [Music]
[26:31] where does the Gentiles start what's the
[26:34] difference between the Gentiles and the
[26:36] and the Jews give us a little bit of
[26:39] influence
[26:46] but we want to be able to ask you
[26:48] questions so yeah
[26:50] it's ready for us
[26:53] so when you start to when I you start to
[26:56] think of the Gentiles and discussions
[27:00] and the Jews
[27:02] us as as Believers we always
[27:06] um we know
[27:08] we're Gentiles
[27:11] we understand that the Jews were were
[27:14] the Gods chosen people
[27:20] when I started to look at this I started
[27:22] to to kind of dig a little bit
[27:25] of who
[27:29] who the where the Gentiles came from
[27:31] yeah
[27:34] through my study
[27:37] I started to dig a little bit
[27:41] when through the through the scriptures
[27:45] through the scriptures as you start to
[27:48] see where the Gentiles began
[27:53] of course this is you know after the
[27:57] flood you know
[27:59] but through the word of God you start to
[28:02] to narrow it down uh
[28:05] [Music]
[28:08] and for Carlo so you you find that that
[28:12] there was just one race you know this is
[28:16] the name of it was it was the family of
[28:20] man yeah
[28:22] and it stayed that way
[28:27] until the promise that that God gave to
[28:30] Abraham
[28:32] so where you start to see this is as it
[28:37] is
[28:41] so let's let's just read it real quick
[28:46] so Genesis 12 verse 1 it says
[28:50] now the Lord had said unto Abraham yet
[28:53] thee out of thy country
[28:55] and from thy kindred
[28:58] and from thy Father's House onto a land
[29:01] that I will show thee and this is
[29:13] and I will make thee a great nation
[29:16] foreign
[29:21] well
[29:25] um
[29:26] where he was I believe it was the the
[29:29] Amorite located
[29:32] but what else
[29:34] as I started
[29:37] as I I wanted to provide to see that
[29:40] picture yes
[29:42] so as you start to see like um that's
[29:46] the promise that we're talking about
[29:50] you know if you
[29:52] follow the the lineage of Abraham
[29:56] you began to understand like understand
[30:01] where Abraham who his father was and
[30:04] where what was going on in the land
[30:06] during that time
[30:11] so we we all should know who Nimrod was
[30:15] right
[30:17] he was he was the king of
[30:21] Babylonia he was the one who built the
[30:24] Tower of Babel well
[30:27] and Abraham's father is
[30:35] um he was he was the chief general of
[30:38] his army
[30:42] and so Tara was uh he he worshiped idols
[30:49] and this is where Abraham came from yeah
[30:54] so when you see that you understand more
[30:57] that when Abraham was was how God called
[31:02] Abraham out of that
[31:07] because God couldn't deal with Abraham
[31:10] in a place like that foreign
[31:25] okay so
[31:28] um we knowing that his father worshiped
[31:31] idols
[31:38] [Music]
[31:41] so there was times in in Abraham's Youth
[31:44] of the end
[31:48] his father would leave him there to to
[31:51] tend to the store selling idols
[31:56] and you just love the part to see how
[32:00] that seed that was inside of Abraham
[32:03] Lincoln is
[32:07] he refused to to do that
[32:11] he would break the idols
[32:14] and he would tell the people that were
[32:17] there to buy the idols how wrong it was
[32:26] this is Abraham in his youth okay it's
[32:29] just you know dude it was all always
[32:32] there like yeah you have to understand
[32:35] who Abraham was
[32:39] in the Bible we find that every promise
[32:43] that God gave to Abraham
[32:47] he believed it as it already was
[32:53] that's the the type of servant that
[32:58] Abraham was to God
[33:02] I say all of this for a reason
[33:06] because when you start to look at that
[33:09] you understand
[33:12] in the scriptures
[33:15] Abraham was referred to
[33:18] he was the first one that was referred
[33:20] to as Hebrew
[33:25] I say all of that about his Youth and
[33:28] everything
[33:30] because when Abraham came out
[33:36] he already knew God was going to bless
[33:38] him
[33:40] and he was going to raise a nation out
[33:43] of him
[33:45] God's word as if it was already
[33:51] when you see Abraham
[33:54] in the Hebrew language
[33:58] it means a crossover or to pass through
[34:03] significant
[34:06] so in chapter 14
[34:10] Genesis is where he's referred to as a
[34:13] Hebrew
[34:15] the first one that was referred to that
[34:18] way
[34:21] and the reason why they referred to him
[34:23] as a Hebrew is
[34:26] because they already knew
[34:30] that Abraham was not like any other in
[34:33] the land yeah
[34:36] it was completely different
[34:39] so when they would refer to him they
[34:42] called him the Hebrews
[34:46] if you follow the lineage down from
[34:49] Abraham to Jesus Christ
[34:53] [Music]
[34:55] Jesus we know that out of Abraham came
[34:58] Isaac
[35:00] out of Isaac came Jacob
[35:04] and out of Jacob came Judah
[35:08] and out of Judah is
[35:12] where that was the lineage that God
[35:15] chose
[35:17] to to bring where Christ was to come
[35:21] foreign
[35:33] now Judah
[35:36] he
[35:38] they were the Hebrew
[35:40] that they took it to the next level and
[35:44] that's where the Jews were formed from
[35:46] foreign
[35:52] let me explain
[35:54] so when I say the next level
[35:58] they believed it so much
[36:01] that they identified themselves and this
[36:05] is where the Jews came from yeah
[36:09] they identified
[36:11] because they changed the definition of
[36:13] what the Hebrew was at this point is
[36:19] and they changed the Hebrew definition
[36:23] do they want it to be identified as that
[36:27] is the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[36:29] yeah
[36:34] the Gentiles you can say they were they
[36:38] were there before the Jews
[36:42] and
[36:44] out of the Jews out of the Gentiles came
[36:47] to Jews
[36:49] and everything that you look at
[36:54] Gentiles
[36:56] everything that you're gonna see
[36:59] is everything but a it's non-jew is
[37:04] that you look up the definition
[37:08] everybody else is Gentile
[37:12] and that's the segregation there that
[37:15] that's the difference between the
[37:17] Gentiles yes
[37:22] do you have any doubt good examples of
[37:25] what is where some of the Gentiles that
[37:29] the lineage came the um
[37:32] for the line that Jesus came from
[37:37] um
[37:38] David Navid David from David came Christ
[37:44] some good stuff though
[37:47] some that that we would never think
[37:52] okay
[37:57] oh yeah
[37:58] um there is a harlot
[38:00] that game um
[38:03] but you always put me on the spot like
[38:05] this
[38:07] but I I believe her name is Rahab the
[38:10] Harlot
[38:12] from that vintage as well
[38:26] salmon that's right yeah
[38:30] for a little more had spoken that before
[38:33] I mean to put him on the spot but it it
[38:36] is when we get into
[38:38] the lineage it is it is so amazing
[38:43] [Music]
[38:44] you know and if we have time for able
[38:47] get into a little he has a code just a
[38:49] little bit on the grafting but it is
[38:52] amazing
[38:54] because it makes it real to us
[38:58] you know you because many times we think
[39:01] that God is so far away
[39:04] and we're never going to reach him
[39:07] but when we look and we see
[39:09] foreign
[39:24] God used some of the most common ways
[39:28] the common people
[39:31] to show that there was Grace
[39:34] because we could always go back to the
[39:36] scriptures
[39:38] he came to his own and his own received
[39:42] them not you know but now that opened
[39:44] the door for us
[39:46] now there's hope for us
[39:49] because we look at this and we see you
[39:53] know many times we don't even we hear
[39:55] many times in church about the Gentiles
[39:59] but many of especially I I say young
[40:03] people but
[40:06] there's a lot of us that come to church
[40:09] here
[40:10] I really don't understand where the
[40:13] lineage came from
[40:14] and the difference between Jews and
[40:17] Gentiles
[40:18] so we wanted just to paint a picture a
[40:22] little bit of
[40:23] go back in time
[40:27] we're talking about this
[40:29] you know we have to get get all our
[40:32] bases down before we even get into it
[40:37] the other thing was with that that
[40:39] always got me was
[40:42] when you see the Jewish perspective
[40:46] on a gentile was was they were known as
[40:50] unclean
[40:51] they even called them dogs
[40:54] the uncircumcised
[40:56] considados they kind of really like
[40:59] really degraded the Gentiles
[41:03] um and and when you see Jesus like Jesus
[41:06] he could have had that attitude
[41:11] you know you find you find the woman at
[41:14] the well
[41:16] where she's like you have nothing to
[41:20] draw from this world
[41:23] if you only knew who you're talking to
[41:26] you
[41:27] well one time
[41:31] you just see it all over like how you're
[41:33] saying it
[41:35] how yet God in his foreign
[41:40] that God saw you and I because
[41:43] you know without him seeing us
[41:47] we don't have a chance if you know
[41:52] but but to see how you're saying
[41:55] no I I don't know if you ever studied
[41:58] this you know
[41:59] but uh did you know that Caleb wasn't
[42:02] considered uh he was actually a Gentiles
[42:07] and you see the mighty Caleb and Joshua
[42:11] Josue well they were a tribe that got
[42:16] put into to with the children of Israel
[42:19] I believe they're called the kennesite
[42:22] tribe
[42:24] was part of that tribe's father
[42:29] and so so when you see calebel his name
[42:34] was the faithful dog they
[42:40] there there is that thing
[42:43] that one thing that always stirred my
[42:45] heart is
[42:47] how we say no matter how low we can get
[42:51] no matter how unclean we feel Our Lives
[42:56] yeah God provides an exodus for each and
[42:59] everyone
[43:03] the most amazing part to me
[43:06] just that Jesus would go to a gentile
[43:11] speak to a gentana gentile say speak the
[43:14] word
[43:18] the words
[43:31] my mind
[43:33] so if we look from the other perspective
[43:36] now okay
[43:38] if this God is so great like you say
[43:41] that he he went out and found
[43:45] so then what what purpose would they
[43:47] need laws for you know so great
[43:51] he found this gentiles
[43:56] what happened
[43:58] that's where mercy and Grace comes
[44:02] I mean because by our own merits foreign
[44:34] all they did after you
[44:37] know but you know you see that when
[44:40] Jesus is is there with the Gentiles
[44:42] Jesus it blew me away
[44:47] how much he just loved and knew what his
[44:50] purpose was
[44:54] he could have said my life
[44:57] it's only for my people
[45:00] he knew that his life
[45:02] for a bigger Ministry
[45:07] what
[45:08] metal
[45:09] yeah what I was trying to
[45:12] trying to get out here is you know
[45:15] we see what the what the end result was
[45:19] with the Jews
[45:21] we talk about the Pharisees
[45:26] were more holier than Jesus
[45:30] Jesus because God had all the chosen
[45:33] people
[45:35] but then you lift your head
[45:38] but there's a there's just one thing
[45:40] that started from the beginning
[45:44] and never stopped following them
[45:48] and that was the trail of the serpent
[45:51] right yes
[45:53] never get away with it
[45:56] that's why God through this whole whole
[45:59] ordeal was telling Abraham foreign
[46:05] many many
[46:10] 400 years or 400 Generations
[46:16] they will go to captivity
[46:19] uh
[46:21] so what went wrong in all this
[46:25] you know and and we're leading to is
[46:29] what we call iniquity
[46:32] I kind of want to bring bring that point
[46:34] out
[46:36] but what is Iniquity yes
[46:39] can we have anyone honest here
[46:43] just so we could get to the bottom again
[46:48] which one of you young
[46:50] um
[46:53] [Music]
[46:58] I know Ruby got Ruby or because
[47:05] yes just answer whatever whatever the
[47:09] answer is going to help someone else
[47:20] not a bad answer
[47:26] hello
[47:29] you you see these answers from these
[47:33] from the these these young men
[47:38] these are answers that help us so much
[47:41] you know I I had ran to this definition
[47:45] of iniquity yeah yeah
[47:47] and I liked it because it was you know
[47:51] it painted a different picture than what
[47:54] we're used to hearing
[47:57] and when we look into iniquity
[48:01] you know it it ties right into sin okay
[48:04] you know there's sin written all over it
[48:08] [Music]
[48:09] but this definition it reads like this
[48:12] definition the Bible speaks of
[48:16] and alludes to God measuring the sin is
[48:19] in the uh
[48:22] an iniquity of each person yeah
[48:25] each nation and the world
[48:28] iniquity is a type of sin
[48:32] that is international and shows
[48:38] so when we're reading this we we as
[48:41] message Believers
[48:47] this next part really
[48:50] got my attention
[48:54] is this the difference between sinning
[48:57] and secret life
[49:00] because we are ashamed and sinning
[49:04] in the full light of day in LA
[49:09] and ignoring ignorando or renouncing
[49:13] God's sovereignty foreign
[49:16] [Music]
[49:25] the iniquity that that abounds and we we
[49:29] know
[49:30] the Bible talks about the mystery of
[49:32] iniquity
[49:35] we think if we sin in private then
[49:39] somebody
[49:41] or we sin and no one knows
[49:46] that it's okay
[49:47] but we go back
[49:50] to the times in the old
[49:54] testamento they didn't have the blood
[49:57] they had to come with their yearly
[49:59] sacrifice
[50:02] and the innocence of that sacrifice
[50:06] would then come upon them
[50:10] and that's what was required
[50:14] but their nature wasn't changed
[50:20] so you you could kind of see they were
[50:22] up against the battle
[50:25] that's why he he starts talking about
[50:27] the cup of iniquity
[50:33] and many times we look and is we we have
[50:36] to look at ourselves is
[50:40] that cup of iniquity full in our lives
[50:45] because really what is it
[50:49] once that cup is full
[50:52] you know we look at that's God's
[50:55] tolerance
[50:57] you know through the blood of Christ he
[50:59] looks away
[51:01] because he sees that blood that's
[51:03] covering
[51:07] but you see this world that we live and
[51:09] when is God going to stop tolerating
[51:13] sinus
[51:17] when are we going to stop tolerating
[51:19] sins
[51:22] you know we look at this great promise
[51:26] but when are we going to stop our
[51:28] Readiness
[51:31] we think just because we don't smoke and
[51:34] drink that everything is fine
[51:37] the prophet God says it's the little
[51:39] things
[51:44] oh I don't feel like going to church
[51:50] when you know where you should be
[51:51] because I don't understand when you know
[51:54] that's where your strength is
[51:59] the thing just alluding off of what
[52:00] you're going off
[52:03] because there's three there's three
[52:05] words that gets associated with iniquity
[52:07] and
[52:09] that is transgressions
[52:15] it's also it's almost like levels of
[52:18] Disobedience
[52:21] so one of the Hebrew words
[52:24] of of uh of iniquity
[52:28] it means guilt worthy of punishment
[52:34] which we realize that that it when we
[52:37] have iniquity
[52:41] we are all given a choice
[52:45] and there's a choice to choose to find
[52:48] forgiveness
[52:54] oh now I get to put Benji on the spot
[52:59] Benji was telling me of this
[53:01] illustration that he saw yeah
[53:04] I want you to explain it okay
[53:08] so we dig into a lot to try to come with
[53:11] different ideas
[53:15] I don't think I was more thankful that
[53:18] God sent us a prophet then
[53:19] okay I was watching you know this a
[53:24] video had popped up because when you
[53:25] search something on YouTube on YouTube
[53:29] everything on that topic pops up
[53:32] so there was this um I don't know if his
[53:36] Pastor I don't know what he was
[53:43] this is what the Lord told me
[53:46] he says this is unique this is how
[53:49] iniquity works
[53:52] you poured water in a cup
[53:55] a put dye in the cup
[53:58] he said this he says this is sin he says
[54:04] it's iniquity
[54:06] but all you got to do is
[54:09] repent is
[54:13] start all over
[54:14] that sounds pretty good
[54:17] he continues
[54:20] he says but then your spirit builds up
[54:24] again
[54:28] he says don't worry
[54:30] start all over again
[54:34] I I began to see the pictures that he
[54:37] was painting
[54:40] and it was to me it was picturing a
[54:43] perfect picture of iniquity
[54:48] that we continue to do the same thing
[54:50] over and over
[54:53] oh God ain't coming for a long time
[54:57] my whole life I've heard the ministers
[55:02] God will be here tomorrow
[55:05] and you know so you you see that and
[55:08] you're you're like man why did Life to
[55:10] Live
[55:13] here you know without completely
[55:15] dedicating our whole lives to him
[55:21] we think that God is not going to come
[55:23] to that point
[55:26] where he's completely can't tolerate sin
[55:29] no more
[55:31] you know but but I have this code and
[55:33] I'm kind of glad brother Omar brought it
[55:35] to that point
[55:37] this is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[55:40] it says and when the whole thing begins
[55:43] to leak out
[55:46] and the righteous seed began setting on
[55:50] the side
[55:54] Delgado
[56:03] and the wicked just keep on very
[56:05] religious
[56:09] just keep getting Wicked and wicked and
[56:12] wicker he continues
[56:16] and nothing to do but to destroy the
[56:20] whole thing like he did back in the
[56:22] Andalusian destruction
[56:29] every thought of men continually full of
[56:32] sin
[56:33] is
[56:36] everything man thinks about today is
[56:40] a bottle of whiskey or some woman
[56:45] or out running around
[56:49] can't live true to their wives
[56:53] the boys can't live true to their girls
[57:00] can't live through to the boys
[57:05] why they're in such a place till the
[57:08] devil has got them so bound and
[57:10] possessed with evil spirits
[57:16] and the whole thing has just become a
[57:19] conglomeration of sins
[57:23] he says that's why we're in this day
[57:27] and that's the reason yes that Russia is
[57:31] playing exactly in the hands of God
[57:35] is
[57:36] to rock this thing right out of here
[57:41] the Bible says so certainly
[57:44] God using communism
[57:46] don't you think that it that is so crazy
[57:51] the prophet of God preached this many
[57:54] years ago
[57:56] but that's why God said a prophet
[57:59] to see ahead of time
[58:02] I don't know if you caught that
[58:04] scripture the first scripture I read in
[58:06] Matthew 24.
[58:11] oh it went here but but
[58:14] through all this
[58:16] he he talks about you you jump to verse
[58:19] 14 24 14.
[58:22] and this is the part this is the light
[58:24] that we have to look for yes
[58:27] you know we start talking about these
[58:30] cups and how they'll eventually be full
[58:32] in business
[58:35] but what's going to happen until that
[58:37] time
[58:39] where is the glory that the bride is
[58:41] going to have
[58:43] and I like this part chapter 14 and the
[58:46] gospel of the kingdom is
[58:50] shall be preaching in all the world
[58:54] for a witness unto all nations
[58:58] that's the part we really that that
[59:01] part's got to fire us up
[59:04] that through all this bad yeah
[59:07] that true gospel is still being preached
[59:12] that's the part that's being made alive
[59:29] and then you start be getting we feed
[59:32] off each other
[59:34] we get wound up
[59:36] like we heard Sunday
[59:38] where's the devil
[59:40] if he gives me if he gives me a punch
[59:44] he's going to have one coming back
[59:48] most definitely because because
[59:50] in this we find we find like like like a
[59:55] brother Adonai said
[59:58] you find that this iniquity
[1:00:01] your answer was
[1:00:05] you know you see that these sins
[1:00:09] they can come and iniquity can Define
[1:00:12] your life foreign
[1:01:26] the blood of Jesus is strong enough to a
[1:01:30] day to obliterate any of them
[1:01:34] you see that when Jesus Is In The Garden
[1:01:37] of Gethsemane Jesus
[1:01:39] he's saying father
[1:01:41] take this cup away
[1:01:44] like was it was it a cup like
[1:01:47] the drinking cup
[1:01:50] what was it
[1:01:52] it was a measurement
[1:01:55] it was something that he did not want to
[1:01:58] take part of because
[1:02:02] as he consumed our iniquity
[1:02:06] I don't know about you but I'm thankful
[1:02:09] our iniquity
[1:02:12] got swallowed up by his blood
[1:02:15] just like you and I never did it
[1:02:19] but the thing is for us now oh yes is
[1:02:24] okay now go and sin no more
[1:02:26] and that's the part that that as you go
[1:02:29] to brother brother Abraham sorry brother
[1:02:32] Benji's illustration
[1:02:35] that's what's wrong with the Gentiles
[1:02:39] that's why we're considered an unclean
[1:02:41] race
[1:02:45] we're a bunch of pigs
[1:02:48] came to church on Sunday
[1:02:51] thank God I feel so much better now
[1:02:54] yeah but we haven't even left the door
[1:02:58] right back to it
[1:03:01] then you have been engulfed with
[1:03:03] iniquity
[1:03:04] and we're blind and don't even know it
[1:03:08] is
[1:03:09] but when you accept that perfect
[1:03:11] sacrifice
[1:03:14] and you truly let the blood wash you
[1:03:19] God puts us get your sin and throws it
[1:03:23] into the sea of forgetfulness
[1:03:26] libido and he puts a sign up and it says
[1:03:28] no fishing
[1:03:31] this doesn't even happen
[1:03:34] move forward with your life
[1:03:39] hey man I I have a quote here but we're
[1:03:41] pressed on time because Brothers
[1:03:47] this is the code of when brother Branham
[1:03:50] is going to go to Israel
[1:03:54] Israel but the Holy Spirit tells them no
[1:03:57] it's not time yet
[1:04:00] I was looking at it right now
[1:04:05] he saw this for his day
[1:04:07] but it was meant for this day
[1:04:11] and this is just the last part of the
[1:04:13] quote the Gentile church is now in the
[1:04:16] ladies yeah
[1:04:17] end of the lady of CN age
[1:04:22] the Jews are in their Homeland
[1:04:26] already there as a gentile apostasy has
[1:04:30] already taken place
[1:04:33] and we have a president like we have is
[1:04:37] this is for us we have a nation is broke
[1:04:41] up like we have
[1:04:44] we have atomic bombs hanging in the
[1:04:47] hangers
[1:04:50] we have a church that's lukewarm the
[1:04:54] remote
[1:04:56] we have a church of people
[1:04:59] that draws themselves together
[1:05:02] that's us now
[1:05:05] we have a Ministry
[1:05:08] that patterns the ministry of Jesus
[1:05:11] Christ
[1:05:12] do you believe that church you know we
[1:05:16] we have to to me and and
[1:05:19] my words I have to place these right
[1:05:21] okay
[1:05:21] because what God has given us
[1:05:25] you know to me but I mean God gave this
[1:05:28] ministry to me
[1:05:30] so it better be the greatest ministry
[1:05:32] that's here on Earth
[1:05:36] and every church should see it that way
[1:05:40] you know because that's what gives us
[1:05:42] life here
[1:05:44] it's the leadership
[1:05:47] that God gave us just like Abraham was a
[1:05:51] great leader to his people
[1:05:54] we have to see that and our propheter
[1:05:58] was seen this day
[1:06:00] because I see a church that's ready
[1:06:03] I see a church that has a Unity
[1:06:07] I see a church that has a Ministry
[1:06:10] and if when we can look at that
[1:06:13] then Romans chapter 12 tells us
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:43] is receive his word and accept it
[1:06:49] for the Abraham
[1:06:51] Manorama
[1:06:53] well Bueno
[1:06:58] we're gonna find out who the amorites
[1:07:01] were Obama says
[1:07:03] and why God hated so much the amorites
[1:07:13] they were one of the Seven Nations that
[1:07:16] occupied Kane
[1:07:21] before the conquest by the Israelites
[1:07:28] now Canaan was the land that the lord
[1:07:30] gave to Abraham
[1:07:33] when he came all the Earth
[1:07:37] but let's go back a little
[1:07:40] so we can follow the spirit
[1:07:44] and see why God hated the Emirates
[1:07:49] now the MRIs
[1:07:54] God did not produce Giants
[1:08:00] but saying you something that God had
[1:08:03] created to produce
[1:08:08] there was the serpent yes
[1:08:12] Genesis 9 18 and it says
[1:08:17] and the sons of Noah that went forth of
[1:08:20] the earth were damned ham and japheth
[1:08:22] and ham is the father of Canaan he knows
[1:08:31] we want to follow the seed and what it
[1:08:35] produced
[1:08:40] Genesis 9 22 Genesis
[1:08:44] and him the father of Canaan so the
[1:08:47] nakedness of his father and told his two
[1:08:50] Brethren without Yan the father is
[1:09:00] Genesis 10 14
[1:09:05] yes some of these words are hard to
[1:09:07] pronounce but
[1:09:12] the first path through some and castle
[1:09:15] in Allah who came the Philistines where
[1:09:19] Goliath was a Philistine he eat a
[1:09:22] partridge
[1:09:30] remember we want to see where those
[1:09:32] giants came from
[1:09:38] and
[1:09:40] Canaan begets he done his firstborn in
[1:09:43] half
[1:09:44] as
[1:09:48] now notice the territory from the Dead
[1:09:53] Sea is
[1:09:56] of Jordan to Mount Hermon yes
[1:10:10] he was a
[1:10:13] giante he had a bed made of iron
[1:10:18] there was 13 and a half feet long
[1:10:24] the MRIs were notorious for
[1:10:29] superstitions
[1:10:32] for witchcraft
[1:10:35] or black magic
[1:10:38] their area was between the Euphrates
[1:10:41] River and the Mediterranean season
[1:10:47] we see that Abraham's descendants have
[1:10:50] been enslaved for 400 years
[1:10:56] and after Moses set them free especially
[1:11:01] they Journey to the promised land Canaan
[1:11:04] is
[1:11:07] it was the land of the Emirates
[1:11:11] because the Lord had told Abraham
[1:11:14] that is the fourth generation
[1:11:18] your descendants will come back here
[1:11:23] for the cup of the sin of the human
[1:11:26] rights has not yet
[1:11:34] why okay
[1:11:36] they were so afraid of them
[1:11:40] they build walls for
[1:11:44] protections
[1:11:47] one of the Kings built a
[1:11:52] wallet there was a 170 miles long
[1:11:59] from the Tigris River to the Euphrates
[1:12:05] a lot of those tribes viewed those MRIs
[1:12:08] with disgusts gusto
[1:12:14] this is what they said about the
[1:12:16] amorites
[1:12:18] they said his companion is his weapon
[1:12:23] companies
[1:12:25] he knows knows the mission
[1:12:31] he knows no grain
[1:12:35] in other words
[1:12:37] if they didn't have food they ate grass
[1:12:43] does the King Nebuchadnezzar when he was
[1:12:46] turning to appease
[1:12:52] thank you
[1:12:55] he knows no house or Town
[1:12:59] Pueblo and he is nothing but raw meat
[1:13:05] and he is not buried after death
[1:13:10] where they died or in battle they just
[1:13:13] left the body
[1:13:16] the MRIs were barbarians
[1:13:22] so even when they reached
[1:13:28] foreign
[1:13:32] barbarians
[1:14:21] Leviticus 18 1 levitical Uno
[1:14:26] and the Lord spoken to move the Saints
[1:14:34] speak unto the children of Israel and
[1:14:36] say unto them I am the Lord your God
[1:14:46] after the doings of the land of Egypt
[1:14:48] for in you dwell shall ye not do and
[1:14:52] after the duties of the land of Canaan
[1:14:54] whether or I'm gonna bring you shall you
[1:14:58] not do neither shall you walk in their
[1:15:01] ordinances
[1:15:23] notice where the spirit comes from he
[1:15:26] can say that donde is a spiritual verse
[1:15:29] 7
[1:15:30] Mercedes the nakedness of thy father or
[1:15:34] the nakedness of thy mother shall thou
[1:15:36] not uncover cheese thy mothers thou
[1:15:39] shall not uncover her nakedness
[1:15:52] thy father's nakedness is
[1:16:01] the spirit that they got that came from
[1:16:04] their great grandfather
[1:16:07] um
[1:16:16] and then his grandson of him
[1:16:21] he married his own mother
[1:16:25] but that's another story
[1:16:28] no he can say
[1:16:30] verse 21 versus
[1:16:39] Allah profane the name of thy God I am
[1:16:43] the Lord but
[1:16:48] foreign
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:35] or an observer of times or an intender
[1:17:39] or a witchero
[1:17:59] with familiar spirits or a wizard or a
[1:18:02] necromancer means
[1:18:09] for all they do these things are in
[1:18:11] Abomination unto the Lord and because of
[1:18:13] those Abominations the Lord thy God does
[1:18:17] try them out from before thee is
[1:18:28] that's why God could not destroy them
[1:18:32] until that cup or Bible
[1:18:42] in a place they call it the cup
[1:18:46] or another place they call it the ball
[1:18:48] uh
[1:18:51] or the bio or
[1:18:56] a a Bible is what we used in a
[1:19:01] laboratory
[1:19:05] it and that violates us a thin little
[1:19:09] skinny little thing that where we mix
[1:19:12] acids is
[1:19:18] that we needed when we were gonna
[1:19:21] analyze what we would analyze analysis
[1:19:29] it was a God that they had
[1:19:34] where they would sacrifice children
[1:19:39] I asked the question to you people
[1:19:45] and you might probably say is
[1:19:49] brother Abraham
[1:19:52] that Spirit of a sacrificing uh uh
[1:19:57] children
[1:20:01] that that have been way back then
[1:20:06] I tell you people they are sacrificing
[1:20:09] more children
[1:20:20] and he was the head of a bull
[1:20:23] with his hands like this conscious
[1:20:27] and they would make a fire
[1:20:30] and put the baby there on the arms of
[1:20:33] that then a God that they had made
[1:20:41] sacrificing children
[1:20:44] is that Spirit still in effect
[1:20:48] every year
[1:20:50] they sacrificed children all around the
[1:20:54] world
[1:20:56] how many times have you seen you heard
[1:20:59] or read
[1:21:02] well a woman will go into a bar and
[1:21:05] leave the baby in a car with over 100
[1:21:07] degrees weather
[1:21:13] how many children died because of that
[1:21:16] in the in in the United States
[1:21:21] how many mothers drawn their children
[1:21:24] when they don't want to take care of
[1:21:26] them no more cuantos matters
[1:21:31] do you know that 40 percent of
[1:21:34] pregnancies are terminated by abortions
[1:21:42] and they're having a big debate in the
[1:21:45] United States about abortions
[1:21:50] a woman that a balls
[1:21:54] are under the spirit of the Emirates
[1:22:02] there are about 3 000 abortions daily
[1:22:08] abortiones and those are the old those
[1:22:12] are only the ones that they reported
[1:22:15] because many don't report it much is
[1:22:23] practice child sacrifices
[1:22:29] there has been a Resurgence of child
[1:22:32] sacrifice Caleb in Uganda I uh and
[1:22:40] Uganda which doctors have been
[1:22:42] implicated in mutilation and death of
[1:22:47] children Los brucos is
[1:22:54] who were killed in an effort to bring
[1:22:57] good portion and wealth to those that
[1:23:01] were willing to pay foreign
[1:23:10] so there's more child sacrifice now than
[1:23:14] in those times
[1:23:17] the spirits don't die
[1:23:21] Spirits stay here
[1:23:23] and they've been traveling all this time
[1:23:26] yeah
[1:23:33] when the Israelites israelitas they got
[1:23:37] to the border of the promised land
[1:23:41] they sense
[1:23:45] and then they came back all scared
[1:23:51] we look like grasshoppers
[1:23:57] they saw the MRI Giants right there they
[1:24:01] don't know
[1:24:03] but thank God for
[1:24:06] calebos
[1:24:11] he said we are more than able to take
[1:24:14] this lamb this is
[1:24:21] we are able to overcome
[1:24:25] only he in Joshua were the only ones
[1:24:29] that brought great background
[1:24:33] foreign
[1:25:09] but it's not for me
[1:25:11] there are they're afraid
[1:25:14] no we can say
[1:25:20] none of them were permitted to go over
[1:25:26] and they perished in their own land
[1:25:31] but
[1:25:34] once they crossed over into the Promised
[1:25:37] lands
[1:25:41] years later
[1:25:49] they went and married more about women
[1:25:57] right woman
[1:26:01] and history repeats itself
[1:26:05] yes many have come into this message
[1:26:10] and like the woman
[1:26:13] Methodist Lutheran
[1:26:16] foreign
[1:27:00] and on and on
[1:27:04] and they're they're afraid

[1:27:18] they have committed fornication among
[1:27:21] them foreign
[1:27:35] Gentile woman
[1:27:40] they polluted the bloodstream EOS
[1:27:43] contamination
[1:27:46] which is the life
[1:27:50] because they had to keep the bloodstream
[1:27:54] clean for catanic
[1:27:57] limpia because the Jewish blood is the
[1:28:00] cleanest blood in the face of the Earth
[1:28:02] is
[1:28:08] you know we've already insane look
[1:28:10] amazing and San Lucas that Jerusalem
[1:28:13] shall be trampled by the Gentiles
[1:28:21] so then why is Jerusalem
[1:28:25] being trampled by the Gentiles
[1:28:31] no questions

[1:29:58] land of Canaan the father was an Amorite
[1:30:01] and the mother of hitters
[1:30:19] it is for thy Nativity in the day that
[1:30:22] thou was born thy neighbor was not cut
[1:30:25] neither was thou washed in water to stop
[1:30:28] stop only that was not something at all
[1:30:32] nor swallow you know foreign
[1:30:47] now this is God talking about Jerusalem
[1:30:54] Caleb you were in Jerusalem
[1:30:57] correct me if I'm wrong
[1:31:01] did you say that only one fourth of
[1:31:04] Jerusalem was the Jews lived and the
[1:31:07] other three sectors were were gentiles
[1:31:17] of the old city
[1:31:21] so we're gonna we're gonna see why only
[1:31:24] one fourth were Jews
[1:31:31] I'm gonna be jumping this this verse is
[1:31:34] very long and so we don't have time to
[1:31:36] you know
[1:31:38] I'll be dumping boys
[1:31:42] and we're talking about Jerusalem is
[1:31:46] to do any of this unto thee to have
[1:31:49] compassion about thee but thou was cast
[1:31:52] doubling to an open fuel the loathing of
[1:31:55] thy person in the days the thou was born
[1:32:16] I said unto thee when thou was in thy
[1:32:21] blood
[1:32:21] Vivek
[1:32:41] I have called it to multiply as the bird
[1:32:44] of the field and thou has increased and
[1:32:47] works great and thou will come to
[1:32:49] excellent ornaments thy breasts are
[1:32:52] fashioned and thy hair is grown for as
[1:32:54] thou was naked and bare foreign
[1:33:40] Mia
[1:33:47] and I'm working with water yay I
[1:33:50] thoroughly washed away the blood from
[1:33:53] the and anointed thee with oil
[1:34:02] let's jump to verse 14.
[1:34:07] and thy renowned went forth among the
[1:34:10] Heathen for the beauty for it was
[1:34:14] perfect through
[1:34:15] through my calmliness which I had put
[1:34:18] upon these days the Lord God is is
[1:34:33] why so many Gentiles are there
[1:34:40] in trust in thine own Beauty and played
[1:34:44] the Harlot because of thy renounce he
[1:34:47] became so famous they opened so
[1:34:49] everybody wanted to build Jerusalem and
[1:34:52] pour out thy fornication on everyone
[1:34:55] that passed by you know confessions
[1:35:03] to foreign
[1:35:15] El capitolo moreover thou has taken thy
[1:35:19] Sons and Daughters whom thou has borne
[1:35:22] unto me and this is of the sacrifice
[1:35:26] unto them to be devoured is this
[1:35:30] of thy whoredoms a small matter is
[1:35:47] claimed my children and delivered them
[1:35:49] to cause them to pass through the fire
[1:35:53] for them is
[1:36:01] consumeria
[1:36:03] the jump to verse 44.
[1:36:07] he called everyone that uses power shall
[1:36:11] use this proverb against the saying s is
[1:36:15] a mother so is her daughter
[1:36:19] is
[1:36:26] thou art thy mother's daughter they lost
[1:36:29] her husband and her children and thou
[1:36:32] are the sister of thy sisters which lost
[1:36:35] their husbands and their children your
[1:36:38] mother was a hittite but your father was
[1:36:40] in MRIs
[1:36:56] elder sister is Samaria she and her
[1:37:00] daughters that dwell at dying left hand
[1:37:03] and the younger sister that dwelleth at
[1:37:05] the right hand is Sodom and her daughter
[1:37:08] is
[1:37:22] you see why God hates the Hemorrhoid so
[1:37:25] much
[1:37:27] but they get to Jerusalem
[1:37:31] but now why was Israel in Egypt okay is
[1:37:36] when God had given them a land
[1:37:42] he gave us a book of act he knows your
[1:37:45] own liberal the edges the Holy Ghost to
[1:37:47] lead us and guide us
[1:37:50] he gave us a land and why are we all
[1:37:53] love them
[1:37:56] we are in the most terrible condition
[1:37:58] that Christianity has ever seen
[1:38:04] the Hamas we are right on the brink of a
[1:38:07] great terrific judgment
[1:39:04] and Benjamin never got the recognition
[1:39:07] until he met Joseph foreign
[1:39:29] God dealt with him more than his
[1:39:31] brothers
[1:39:33] and they hated him with all the cause
[1:39:38] and eat the same thing in this message
[1:39:43] the way God used Brotherhood brothers
[1:39:48] let's not go too far
[1:39:53] they jealous of Thomas Perez
[1:39:57] Perez because of the ministry and gift
[1:40:00] that God gave him
[1:40:07] it is nothing but pure jealous
[1:40:12] celos and then brothers and nothing pure
[1:40:15] about it
[1:40:17] it's nothing but filthy dirty jealous
[1:40:22] God could not bless Israel yes
[1:40:26] until they were in their homelands
[1:40:29] Joseph taken away Jose so the
[1:40:34] persecution would rise
[1:40:38] it was the wheel in the wheel moving
[1:40:41] [Music]
[1:40:43] and 44 told Joseph lay down with me oh
[1:40:52] doesn't the MRIS
[1:40:54] tell the people there
[1:41:00] who is the Emirates now how old is
[1:41:05] don't they want you to lay with them
[1:41:11] I'm talking about these Giants
[1:41:16] are giants
[1:41:19] and who am I talking about
[1:41:22] I'm talking about the the lutherans the
[1:41:26] methodists
[1:41:33] they are the MRI Giants now India
[1:41:39] foreign
[1:41:49] they reject it remember that they
[1:41:51] rejected the prophet Moses
[1:41:56] and because they didn't receive him in
[1:41:58] Egypt okay
[1:42:01] they had to spend 40 years more
[1:42:08] in finishing yeah
[1:42:14] they had to stay those extra holy years
[1:42:20] extra so why are we still here in Egypt
[1:42:25] because the people have rejected the
[1:42:27] message and the prophets
[1:42:45] the Amorite condition is about right
[1:42:53] said this in 1963.
[1:42:59] try they're trying to unite the presence
[1:43:05] and bring them into into a confederation
[1:43:13] don't reject the advances of of these
[1:43:17] giant churches
[1:43:22] and don't be caught in that
[1:43:24] Confederation
