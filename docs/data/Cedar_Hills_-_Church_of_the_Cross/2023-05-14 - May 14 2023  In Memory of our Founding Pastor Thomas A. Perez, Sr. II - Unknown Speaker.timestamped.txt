[23:59] uh
[24:03] a scripture came to me also and I'd like
[24:06] to share it with you
[24:08] in Psalm 71 8 old and gray-headed
[24:12] oh God forsake me not
[24:15] until I have showed thy strength unto
[24:19] this generation
[24:21] and thy power to everyone that is to
[24:25] come
[24:26] the title of this poem is until that day
[24:32] when God's Saints have left this world

[24:49] dear ones for now your loved one's Joy
[24:53] is full
[24:55] would they come back if they could

[25:11] but the day will be when our great
[25:14] reunion will bring such Joy amen amidst
[25:19] great cheers
[25:20] yes or now their Works will follow
[25:25] and their legacy lives on
[25:27] until the day when there will come
[25:31] the breaking of the Dawn
[25:35] their lives produced a stronger faith
[25:39] and also brought fire and Sparks
[25:44] how blessed are those who have lived in
[25:47] faith and left us this precious mark
[25:53] what they were in life and their
[25:56] inspired spoken word
[25:58] will always say
[26:01] within our hearts
[26:03] their absence is but a moment of God's
[26:07] time
[26:09] that we will be a part
[26:12] and distance is but a step away
[26:16] and God's eternity
[26:20] yes a life well lived will always be
[26:23] their gift to all yes their testimony
[26:30] but keep in mind
[26:32] though their Earthly eyes are closed
[26:36] so their tent is but in slumber
[26:39] as those on the road to Emmaus
[26:43] we too Are Not Alone
[26:46] and we are not outnumbered
[26:50] when Christ left his dear disciples
[26:54] and he ascended

[27:02] and the angels spoke and gave the word

[45:14] give a little testimony before we get
[45:15] going
[45:18] and uh you know our founding pastor
[45:21] Pastor the heart that he had
[45:25] and uh there was a plot that he had
[45:29] purchased for my mother and and himself
[45:35] and so when when my after my mother
[45:39] passed away and then my grandmother
[45:41] passed away that would be Grandma Virgie
[45:43] yeah
[45:47] our founding pastor says I'm going to
[45:51] give her my spot
[45:55] they put my grandma Virgie right next to
[45:58] my mother
[46:00] so now we were we were looking to see
[46:04] well what are we going to do now
[46:08] and of course we had a few options
[46:12] and or we could have put him in Fort
[46:15] Baird
[46:17] there at the cemetery there for the for
[46:20] the veterans
[46:22] and uh but the Lord moved on brother
[46:25] Tommy's heart
[46:40] let's see if we can get that little plot
[46:43] right right next to to the to Mama and
[46:46] Grandma
[46:49] brother Tommy and brother Omar they they
[46:52] worked and talked to some of the people
[46:53] that they knew at the city
[46:57] and so we met them out there
[47:00] and uh we uh we were talking to two of
[47:03] the the men that were there yeah
[47:06] and then when all of a sudden a man
[47:09] comes
[47:11] he's the main the main man
[47:15] no he's he's our supervisor
[47:19] so he came in and we're talking with him
[47:21] and yeah they measured and see if they
[47:24] could do it
[47:26] and at the end the man says yeah we can
[47:29] make this work
[47:32] you all can buy this this plot right
[47:35] next to to your moms
[47:38] and we will praise the Lord
[47:42] we're looking at the man
[47:46] he had a name badge International
[47:47] numbers you know what his name was
[47:50] his name was Jesus
[47:55] I you know
[47:59] you you see the Lord moving in so many
[48:01] ways
[48:04] he honored his mother
[48:07] father
[48:08] he also honored his wife's mother it was
[48:13] his mother-in-law gave her his place
[48:16] and Jesus showed up and said I have a
[48:21] place for my servant
[48:23] to the Lord for those things
[48:29] and you know
[48:31] I was thinking this morning and and uh
[48:34] or or yesterday
[48:36] or what do we do for the mothers
[48:39] we appreciate all the Mamas
[48:42] and our mama we're thankful to God for
[48:45] the mother that he gave us
[48:47] what do I do Lord
[48:50] and I opened up this message
[48:54] Holy Spirit led me to this message
[48:59] I said wow yo just one last time
[49:03] let our founding Pastor preach to the
[49:06] mamas
[49:09] he happened to preach this message
[49:14] on Mother's Day 2001.
[49:18] and he entitled the message
[49:22] time tested memorials
[49:25] and just the way that it goes so perfect
[49:28] with this with with the event right now
[49:33] and the celebration that we're going to
[49:35] have in a couple of days for his life
[49:41] he talks about about what we take when
[49:44] we die
[49:52] how it came together we're grateful to
[49:55] the Lord
[49:58] get comfortable the message is not very
[50:01] long
[50:03] but after the message we have the rest
[50:06] of the ministers
[50:08] and some of the deacons
[50:11] continuing what we did on Wednesday yeah
[50:15] and we'll do that and then we have the
[50:17] the children have their little program
[50:19] for The Mamas also
[50:22] if you can stand for the reading of the
[50:24] word I want to just read the scripture
[50:26] that our founding Pastor he reads
[50:31] and then we will put the message on
[50:36] Amen it's Matthew the 24th chapter
[50:40] and the 35th verse
[50:44] and it reads like this when you have it
[50:46] you can say Amen
[50:50] here's some pages still going and we'll
[50:52] let you catch up
[50:56] and it reads like this
[50:58] Matthew 24 35 heaven and Earth shall
[51:02] pass away
[51:04] but my words
[51:06] shall not pass away
[51:12] the blessings to the region of his word
[51:17] as we introduce our founding Pastor God
[51:19] bless
[51:42] thank you
[51:44] foreign
[52:53] uh
[52:54] kind of speak to you and if we get to
[52:57] preaching will that be fine
[53:02] but it's time tested is
[53:07] I would never criticize
[53:15] of someone the alien take flowers to the
[53:19] graveyard the ivara Flores
[53:22] I would never criticize anyone for
[53:26] adorning the graves
[53:32] and I take it because our
[53:37] propheta he says this esto if you do
[53:41] that
[53:42] we appreciate that
[53:44] that's where I get my thoughts
[53:48] so in a time like Mother's Day
[53:52] Madre we we go maybe to the cemetery
[53:59] and we see the ground where they're
[54:02] resting
[54:05] wasn't too long ago we were in Texas
[54:18] but you know as as I looked at Russ's
[54:22] mother as we buried her there in Texas
[54:24] actually
[54:31] her body looked peaceful
[54:38] and and we hear these comments in uh in
[54:42] in funeral services
[54:46] she looks or he looks so good
[54:50] of course that's the body where they
[54:54] lived
[54:56] but a consolation
[54:59] uh to brother Ross and and the rest of
[55:03] the people that have their mothers have
[55:05] gone on
[55:07] consolation
[55:12] she lived to be a good age
[55:17] according to the Bible segun La Biblia
[55:20] if you live to be 70.
[55:23] you're doing all right
[55:26] if you live to be 80.
[55:29] why are you doing much better
[55:32] the thing about it is
[55:35] it seems like we fear death so much
[55:43] we don't want to leave
[55:47] now
[55:48] brother password
[55:51] was not like that
[55:55] right
[55:57] brother Bosworth and hermano Bosworth
[56:01] said that was the happiest time of his
[56:04] life
[56:08] he says because I'm finally going to go
[56:11] meet Jesus
[56:15] the one I've talked about all my life
[56:19] [Music]
[56:21] my wife is as we come to church
[56:26] while we were driving this morning
[56:29] she says
[56:31] why do we cry so much
[56:35] and the reason she gave that thought is
[56:38] because
[56:41] we were hearing a tape on her CD is
[56:48] and the tape or the song goes something
[56:50] like this
[56:53] our friend or our mother is going home
[57:00] so let's party
[57:03] let's have party time
[57:06] and you know it might not sound so good
[57:12] but in in the in the Christian walk
[57:17] Christiana everything is based on death
[57:20] burial and Resurrection
[57:25] everything is based on that
[57:29] no matter how good we treat our bodies
[57:34] no matter how good a medicine we have no
[57:38] no no
[57:40] matter how good doctors we have when
[57:43] medical we this will pass away
[57:47] it will pass away so we might as well
[57:51] get ready Fiesta
[58:04] Bible says it looks like I'm preaching a
[58:07] funeral message instead of a Mother's
[58:09] Day message
[58:20] my theme is
[58:24] is time-tested memorial memorial
[58:30] but my text is
[58:33] the body of Jesus El cuerpo De Jesus
[58:37] between the sixth and seventh Dimensions
[58:39] Memorial
[58:45] keep that in mind
[58:47] maybe you can catch the meaning of time
[58:51] tested memories
[58:56] Paul said Pablo dijo
[58:59] camos
[59:04] case
[59:07] like those that have no hope Esperanza
[59:12] we were coming from
[59:16] somewhere is
[59:19] my wife it's been hard for her the loss
[59:23] of her mama
[59:29] and her and sister
[59:50] and uh
[59:52] we heard some sobbing like little
[59:56] subbing
[1:00:01] and I I asked Jamie
[1:00:04] Jamie you're thinking about your mom
[1:00:06] again
[1:00:08] she said I can get her on my mind
[1:00:13] and uh brother
[1:00:17] was I I I told him why Unity had put it
[1:00:22] in sorrow
[1:00:26] and brought together this real politely
[1:00:31] he said these words
[1:00:35] he said
[1:00:36] sister Jamie but in Spanish
[1:00:44] thank God
[1:00:52] that you had a mother Madre that race
[1:01:05] thank God for that that delegation
[1:01:09] because porque
[1:01:26] a mother to love me
[1:01:30] I was raised by my aunt and uncle
[1:01:35] they were very hard with me
[1:01:40] they I would come home
[1:01:43] he would beat me up
[1:01:46] and for supper he put it he would give
[1:01:50] me a piece of bread
[1:01:53] and he would give me a cup of coffee
[1:01:58] then he made me work
[1:02:03] and I would cry
[1:02:06] when I went to school
[1:02:09] I had torn trousers pantalones rotos I
[1:02:15] sometimes was dirty
[1:02:18] and I would see other children
[1:02:23] their mothers would hug them and kiss
[1:02:27] them as they went into the schools
[1:02:36] she said so sister Jamie Jamie
[1:03:05] there's separation
[1:03:10] that there are
[1:03:12] memories that linger with us
[1:03:17] they just stay with us memories
[1:03:23] something that we have in our Spirits
[1:03:27] Memorial
[1:03:31] it is God is Bueno to send our children
[1:03:36] to school
[1:03:38] that's very good
[1:03:40] commandable is
[1:03:58] foreign to give our children
[1:04:02] as heritage
[1:04:05] is to show them as the most starless
[1:04:08] that there is a Jesus Jesus that loves
[1:04:13] us I I remember
[1:04:16] being in the Navy
[1:04:18] I passed through a few rough spots
[1:04:26] and uh
[1:04:28] I I would always when I was in danger
[1:04:32] I could hear my mother's voice
[1:04:40] first the kingdom of God
[1:04:45] and it's righteous
[1:04:47] and all these other things shall be
[1:04:50] added
[1:04:52] and you know that that gave me strength
[1:04:56] I believe I I passed through a lot of
[1:04:58] things
[1:05:00] and I and I made it
[1:05:03] because of the prayers of my mother
[1:05:09] so I hope that
[1:05:12] and in memory

[1:14:55] from under the protection of the blood
[1:14:59] protection and the only way to bring it

[1:15:05] is
[1:15:08] to confess or else for forgiveness of
[1:15:12] what you have done or offended a person

[1:15:21] the other day a man called me
[1:15:25] sometimes when you try to do good
[1:15:30] try to help a person
[1:15:32] seems like a lot of people take

[1:19:44] something's wrong
[1:19:49] we could speak on that but
[1:19:53] I I say that because the Lord Porque el
[1:19:58] Senor will give us
[1:19:59] he gives us things and he's trying to
[1:20:03] form the characters
[1:20:09] the Lord to form our characters

[1:21:12] stand
[1:21:15] watch it baby
[1:21:19] people
[1:21:20] not old people
[1:21:22] but a lot of people are a bunch of
[1:21:25] babies
[1:21:30] something goes wrong in their lives
[1:21:35] and right away they blame God
[1:21:41] right amen yes that's right they say
[1:21:45] well I don't know why
[1:21:47] things aren't going right
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:51] do you know that God loves to trials
[1:21:58] and when God sees you
[1:22:03] and you're a certain mold a certain way
[1:22:10] God sees that part in you
[1:22:14] and he permits a trial
[1:22:18] that will come
[1:22:21] to take that bad part out of you
[1:22:27] and you call that bass
[1:22:31] oh that's better than gold
[1:22:39] in you

[1:22:46] because we're supposed to be taken to
[1:22:49] heaven in a bed of roses
[1:22:57] everything's gotta be all right
[1:23:01] the church itself
[1:23:04] the church Iglesia
[1:23:07] and I'm speaking about the church
[1:23:10] Iglesia
[1:23:17] a lot of world needs worldliness comes
[1:23:20] in
[1:23:24] the Bible says that worldly things
[1:23:26] cannot come in there
[1:23:33] but in the church world
[1:23:39] it's it's become materialistic material
[1:24:01] good Furniture foreign
[1:24:05] [Applause]
[1:24:22] it's not wrong to have a good home I
[1:24:24] have as good a home as anybody

[1:24:31] anybody
[1:24:34] buenos vehicles
[1:24:38] it lets you live that's comfortable
[1:24:43] but the focus is
[1:24:48] in something and
[1:24:51] algo that has been tested
[1:24:55] it's been tested for 2 000 years
[1:25:05] that Hollywood takes a fable in
[1:25:08] Hollywood
[1:25:09] and makes it look real it was
[1:25:15] that preachers take the word of God
[1:25:22] we were in a funeral here in Cedar Hills
[1:25:26] I can't Cedar Hills and it was a
[1:25:28] beautiful funeral
[1:25:30] and some people as they went out of the
[1:25:33] church
[1:25:35] they said those people preach and sing
[1:25:38] like they believe what they're doing
[1:25:44] absolutely absolutely
[1:25:47] it's been tested
[1:25:49] through the time and we believe it has
[1:25:55] outdone anything
[1:25:58] we believe it's been proven
[1:26:01] that Jesus Christ he died
[1:26:26] amen amen
[1:26:30] people don't see Jesus Jesus
[1:26:36] some people believe that he's going to
[1:26:38] show that
[1:26:41] I believe it but I want you to I want to
[1:26:46] be a witness
[1:26:48] and I want you to know
[1:26:52] how come I believe
[1:26:57] I don't believe
[1:27:05] orange juice scars
[1:27:18] secretary says
[1:27:25] the punch line of time tested Memorial
[1:27:28] just a few moments
[1:27:34] Prophet speaks
[1:27:37] about a bridge they wanted to build over
[1:27:40] a river
[1:27:45] but they they found out that the
[1:27:50] bottom of the creek was nothing but
[1:27:52] quick sentence
[1:27:58] so they said that it's impossible to
[1:28:03] build a bridge
[1:28:05] but they needed that bridge
[1:28:08] so they they call for a man from England
[1:28:13] to build this bridge is
[1:28:18] and he came
[1:28:21] and they asked him can you build a
[1:28:24] bridge here
[1:28:28] I believe so
[1:28:31] but I have to test a lot of things
[1:28:40] that quicksand Isa goes so far down
[1:28:45] but there has to be a foundation
[1:28:49] somewhere down there
[1:28:52] of solid rock the the Tierra film
[1:28:57] so he ordered for big pumps
[1:29:04] to come and pump this quicksand out of
[1:29:09] the riverbed
[1:29:13] and he was sure
[1:29:16] and they inspected that it was Solid
[1:29:18] Rock
[1:29:20] that's where they put their big old
[1:29:23] bowls and things
[1:29:25] and and and the story is long but let me
[1:29:29] just listen just
[1:29:34] give you a little bit on it
[1:29:35] he build the bridge
[1:29:42] and as he said
[1:29:47] Los criticos dijeron
[1:29:50] that get in one stand okay
[1:29:54] that's what they said
[1:29:56] they were wrong
[1:29:59] everybody showed up for the great
[1:30:01] ceremony
[1:30:05] to see if
[1:30:08] that person would cross that bridge
[1:30:13] they they said it won't hold he don't
[1:30:16] know
[1:30:19] well he put the train
[1:30:24] and he said I'll cross it first
[1:30:28] and he went yeah
[1:30:45] [Applause]
[1:30:49] come on over
[1:30:56] Jesus when he was here
[1:31:00] he said there's a place
[1:31:02] you know
[1:31:04] it is a bridge
[1:31:07] that's a bridge
[1:31:13] he said there is a place prepared
[1:31:19] I'm or I'm going to prepare a place

[1:39:19] a text message that was sent to me
[1:39:22] it's sent to our pastor and then
[1:39:25] Pastor and then he wanted me to read
[1:39:27] this for you
[1:39:29] um
[1:39:31] he says
[1:39:32] I just wanted to express a few thoughts
[1:39:35] on the passing of your dad
[1:39:43] this is from Brother Jim Matthew Jim
[1:39:46] Matthew
[1:39:47] my thoughts go back
[1:39:49] to myself cruising along as a senior in
[1:39:52] college
[1:39:57] I thought I had everything I needed to
[1:40:01] have a successful
[1:40:03] life successful family
[1:40:11] and a successful career exitosa
[1:40:15] I had all the training
[1:40:18] education education and examples in my
[1:40:21] life
[1:40:22] to have what would have been considered
[1:40:25] a great life in this world
[1:40:31] God interrupted my life
[1:40:34] and showed me that even though I had all
[1:40:37] these things
[1:40:40] to rely on moving forward really moving
[1:40:44] forward
[1:40:46] I did not have the main thing principal
[1:40:51] and he gave me the opportunity to have a
[1:40:54] Christian Life
[1:40:56] Christiana to hear the message brought
[1:40:59] by the 20th century prophets
[1:41:03] to contend for the faith that was once
[1:41:06] delivered to the Saints
[1:41:12] to strive to obtain the new birth
[1:41:18] and to have a pastor that was a pastor
[1:41:21] in every sense of the word
[1:41:26] what a rock solid foundation he gave me
[1:41:34] I remember one one service
[1:41:38] when he was about to open
[1:41:44] I remember one service when he was
[1:41:46] preaching
[1:41:49] it felt like another dimension was about
[1:41:51] to open he says
[1:41:58] I remember and appreciate the many times
[1:42:00] I had a chance to spend time with my
[1:42:02] pastor yeah
[1:42:08] I consider knowing your dad one of the
[1:42:10] greatest blessings and privileges of my
[1:42:12] life
[1:42:16] I should have done better for him
[1:42:20] better for God
[1:42:23] but through my many failings
[1:42:26] I am still enduring uh
[1:42:33] condolences are for those suffering
[1:42:36] sorrow
[1:42:37] um
[1:42:45] to me this is the graduation that your
[1:42:48] dad strive for all his life
[1:42:54] I cannot express condolences at a
[1:42:57] graduation like this
[1:43:01] I have a feeling of contentment knowing
[1:43:04] that your dad is free from the from this
[1:43:07] past house
[1:43:12] he fulfilled his part in the Christian
[1:43:14] drama of God
[1:43:18] his legacy continues through everyone
[1:43:21] that he reached
[1:43:25] I believe that even greater
[1:43:28] and he has in parentheses more words
[1:43:35] um Ras will be done for the kingdom of
[1:43:39] God after his passing is
[1:43:52] hey man
[1:44:00] for me it was one of the one of my
[1:44:03] greatest privileges in being able to sit
[1:44:04] under him um
[1:44:09] please forgive me okay I'm gonna try to
[1:44:11] keep it together
[1:44:15] you know there's a movie called 300 uh
[1:44:19] and when the King was killed
[1:44:22] he was about to die yeah
[1:44:25] and some of his men were
[1:44:28] were dying also along his side
[1:44:32] the servant tells him
[1:44:35] he says
[1:44:36] it's an honor to die at your side
[1:44:40] and the King responded
[1:44:43] and he said it was an honor to have
[1:44:46] lived at yours
[1:44:52] to you and I can say with all of my
[1:44:55] heart
[1:44:56] it was an honor to have it at his side
[1:45:01] forgive me I'm trying not to be a baby
[1:45:02] here okay
[1:45:04] well done this really it it hits me hard
[1:45:07] because as a young man
[1:45:10] I didn't have an example of a father of
[1:45:13] that was a minister as Jerry said
[1:45:16] Jerry you know and we were talking tom
[1:45:20] me Jerry and my mom were talking yo
[1:45:22] Jeremy mama and he says oh man so many
[1:45:24] things to say Where Do We Begin
[1:45:28] and as they said
[1:45:32] hombre
[1:46:01] and uh
[1:46:03] I remember it was it was after his it
[1:46:05] was after a Wednesday service
[1:46:09] it was his birthday
[1:46:11] my mom says me and Jerry were there
[1:46:16] we hadn't started helping out in the
[1:46:18] church or anything
[1:46:20] like listen now and my mom says oh look
[1:46:23] today's brother Tommy's birthday
[1:46:26] I remember Jerry we used to wear the
[1:46:29] chains
[1:46:31] so now the chain that he had on
[1:46:35] the Chain was his uh
[1:46:45] standing right next to him
[1:46:53] for your birthday he looks at it he says
[1:46:56] what is this is
[1:46:58] oh it's a chain
[1:47:00] oh thank you gracias now for me for me
[1:47:05] that's where the story began
[1:47:08] and I say that for this reason
[1:47:10] because that pendant that was on there
[1:47:13] we heard a while ago that he was in the
[1:47:16] Navy
[1:47:18] now now that Panda was an anchor
[1:47:23] and that anchor had a ship's wheel on it
[1:47:50] never in my life have I ever seen a man
[1:47:53] speak with such Authority
[1:47:57] many times that we would eat breakfast
[1:48:01] every time we eat lunch together
[1:48:05] and that Authority just wasn't from
[1:48:07] behind the pope yes
[1:48:09] many times that we'd be there at
[1:48:11] different restaurants
[1:48:16] you were there we were crying like
[1:48:18] babies
[1:48:20] the waitress would come and look at us
[1:48:25] two men with tears coming down their
[1:48:28] eyes why
[1:48:30] me
[1:48:42] so little time
[1:48:45] so much to say and so little time
[1:48:48] and I just wanted to say this as I said
[1:48:51] at the beginning
[1:48:53] for me but I mean it was a privilege for
[1:48:56] the kids
[1:48:59] I know he was your father in the natural
[1:49:03] but that was my spiritual father is
[1:49:08] seeing that my where my anchor would be
[1:49:11] cast
[1:49:16] man
[1:49:47] thank you
[1:50:00] Elizabeth
[1:50:01] amen God bless you this morning
[1:50:06] as I was driving to church I was
[1:50:09] thinking
[1:50:14] I wanted to read a scripture that would
[1:50:17] maybe remember I could remember brother
[1:50:19] Tommy
[1:50:20] or Pastor I know
[1:50:25] and there wasn't a scripture that stood
[1:50:27] out to me more than this
[1:50:29] Hebrews 11.
[1:50:34] the chapter of the faith Eva
[1:50:41] there's not a chapter that speaks of a
[1:50:43] living faith like in this chapter
[1:50:48] we have many memories
[1:50:53] many memories that that have out that
[1:50:57] were outstanding to us
[1:51:03] Maybe
[1:51:07] they are Earthly and one of these days
[1:51:08] they might erase
[1:51:10] there's an impression is
[1:51:14] an impression that anchors me and it's
[1:51:17] Eternal
[1:51:18] it's the faith that he had it's always
[1:51:22] that made a great impression in my life
[1:51:30] [Music]
[1:51:32] I remember one time when he was just
[1:51:34] finished preaching the service
[1:51:39] oh how we know our brother Tommy was in
[1:51:42] the Navy yes
[1:51:45] he would always mention things of the of
[1:51:47] the sea and of ships
[1:51:51] one time he mentioned of a ship
[1:51:56] a ship of no matter how big it is how
[1:51:59] strong it is how good it looks
[1:52:02] it wasn't made to be in court
[1:52:08] and after that a message he called me to
[1:52:11] his office
[1:52:20] yeah the correct straightened me out
[1:52:22] so I got there yes
[1:52:26] he knew that I had just barely finished
[1:52:28] buying a house
[1:52:30] and he asked me
[1:52:33] how would you like to move to Las Cruces
[1:52:38] and I told him sure wherever you send me

[1:53:08] and I told him well I'll give the house
[1:53:10] back to the bank

[1:53:17] bank I know it was hard for me to get
[1:53:19] this house

[1:53:25] I said here here's the keys to this

[2:07:47] Lord have mercy on him
[2:07:53] and that impacted me so much
[2:07:59] I
[2:08:04] only want a portion of what he has
[2:08:10] impacted

[2:08:39] and people started pressuring him
[2:08:44] all right
[2:08:48] let's make a circle with her hands so
[2:08:50] they don't pass
[2:08:53] so they cannot pressure him
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:55] to have that confidence to speak to me
[2:09:58] the way he did yeah
[2:10:01] [Applause]
[2:10:09] amen God bless you this morning
[2:10:12] first of all I want to thank the Lord
[2:10:14] remember
[2:10:16] just to
[2:10:18] I met brother Tommy foreign
[2:10:55] and I know reading in the Bible
[2:10:59] not worshiping the man
[2:11:01] we all know that
[2:11:04] we all know that
[2:11:05] what Paul says in Galatians
[2:11:08] they glorify God in Me Okay and me and
[2:11:13] that's and it's still continuing so
[2:11:17] one of the one I would testimony when we

[2:18:48] style where he's at we're going to be
[2:18:50] there
[2:18:52] okay
[2:18:55] he's in Heavenly places
[2:19:06] in Silver City I had to take our time to
[2:19:09] be over here because I have to wait till
[2:19:10] the Christmas clothes in Silver City
[2:19:15] it's time
[2:19:17] I close the doors
[2:19:20] for the grace of God we are here
[2:19:24] you believe in me
[2:19:27] foreign
[2:19:41] [Applause]
[2:20:06] I bless each and every one of you
[2:20:09] I want to thank my pastor foreign
[2:20:34] I'm sorry for getting emotional
[2:20:37] but I'm not no
[2:20:41] but uh as I started to try to think of
[2:20:45] what to share
[2:20:50] there's so many memories
[2:20:54] he was uh
[2:20:56] he was my uncle
[2:20:59] and uh for
[2:21:01] some reason he he loved me
[2:21:06] and uh Deacon here
[2:21:10] I'm a deacon here
[2:21:13] I was ordained by God by by our Apostle
[2:21:17] Paul
[2:21:20] um and
[2:21:22] there's a old Indian saying I will not
[2:21:26] um
[2:21:29] that it would say too many chiefs
[2:21:32] Indians which will have a noise
[2:21:35] and as you look at that that that's a
[2:21:38] saying that there's no water here
[2:21:41] it's a saying that holds no water here
[2:21:46] because we all knew who are who our
[2:21:48] chief was
[2:21:50] and it was a privilege for me
[2:21:53] to serve as uh one of the many many
[2:21:57] faithful Indians here
[2:22:01] as I started to think of a story to tell
[2:22:04] or or something to share
[2:22:08] the only the only story I could remember
[2:22:12] because my uncle he loved he loved to go
[2:22:14] hunting
[2:22:18] and one year God blessed us to where we
[2:22:21] can all go together
[2:22:23] and uh
[2:22:25] I had a I had killed my dear early
[2:22:31] um thanks to brother Caleb
[2:22:33] he uh shot this deer out of the mountain
[2:22:38] and chased him right to me now
[2:22:46] but uh so I had killed my dear early and
[2:22:49] my family went out and so I started to
[2:22:53] help the other brothers to go out and
[2:22:55] try to find the deers
[2:22:58] and the reason why I chose this story
[2:23:01] because
[2:23:05] it displayed the character of of our
[2:23:08] pastors this
[2:23:10] is what he was to me
[2:23:13] and so I was getting ready to leave with
[2:23:17] this other brother and
[2:23:20] um
[2:23:27] I said yes sir I sure will he's in New
[2:23:29] York so we we went out I didn't have a
[2:23:32] rifle or nothing
[2:23:35] and this certain brother lo and behold
[2:23:38] run into a nice little buck
[2:23:42] so I said brother give me your rifle so
[2:23:45] I could so I could kill it for for the
[2:23:47] chief
[2:23:49] he goes no bro let's let's let him get
[2:23:53] bigger
[2:23:55] I was like bro bro I need to kill that
[2:23:58] deer for the chief
[2:24:01] and uh he's like no let's let him get
[2:24:05] bigger
[2:24:07] he was a little bit older than me
[2:24:10] you know I was like all right Bueno I
[2:24:13] guess
[2:24:15] so we get back to Campo and I knew
[2:24:19] you didn't know the chief I knew he was
[2:24:22] going to be looking for me so I was like
[2:24:25] like a tail my tail between my legs
[2:24:29] trying to not be where he was at you
[2:24:33] know
[2:24:35] sure enough
[2:24:37] come over here
[2:24:45] so I go and he says hey did you see
[2:24:48] anything I said
[2:24:51] I'm so sorry Uncle I I did see one I'm
[2:24:55] not gonna lie to you
[2:24:57] I said but I I didn't have my rifle and
[2:25:01] I asked the brother to
[2:25:02] you know
[2:25:05] how many pastors do you have
[2:25:09] man he he you know you know if you know
[2:25:12] if you've been there before
[2:25:14] you know how the chief he would he would
[2:25:17] hello
[2:25:20] um
[2:25:21] I took it you know and and so here I am
[2:25:24] building
[2:25:28] and he says uh he says hey
[2:25:31] come over here I got something for you
[2:25:34] so we're going to his uh he had a RV at
[2:25:38] that time
[2:25:41] he just starts talking to me like like
[2:25:43] nothing just happened
[2:25:46] Cooks me this big old steak
[2:25:51] and that's how he was yeah
[2:25:54] he didn't hold anything
[2:25:58] anything like that and uh everything he
[2:26:03] did he did for his people you know
[2:26:07] um there's a there's a saying he would
[2:26:09] always use
[2:26:10] he would say
[2:26:12] don't wait for somebody to die tomorrow
[2:26:17] my whole life all I've ever seen him do
[2:26:20] is give roses
[2:26:25] and uh
[2:26:27] Jefe
[2:26:29] for the last time on this Earth
[2:26:33] these are my roses to give to you
[2:26:37] I love you yeah
[2:26:47] wow what an awesome man
[2:26:49] what an awesome Pastor that we have
[2:26:51] founding Pastor
[2:26:54] what a very great man
[2:26:57] and everybody knows that
[2:27:01] I
[2:27:02] have the privilege and honor to be
[2:27:04] called his grandson Nieto
[2:27:07] [Music]
[2:27:09] and what a love a lot of love he showed
[2:27:11] me
[2:27:14] for whatever reason
[2:27:17] I just love to sing to the Lord ever
[2:27:19] since I was a young little kid
[2:27:23] and I think I was mainly just more loud
[2:27:25] than any good the uh
[2:27:28] yes
[2:27:30] but my grandfather would always
[2:27:32] encourage me to sing
[2:27:37] and when I was uh I think I was probably
[2:27:40] 11 or 12 and they put me up to song Lead
[2:27:43] after church
[2:27:47] and I remember going to uh to Lotaburger
[2:27:50] with him
[2:27:52] a Lotaburger in the family we always
[2:27:55] like going there
[2:27:57] and he would just say mijo just just
[2:28:00] give the Lord all your heart
[2:28:05] just don't ever be afraid of that
[2:28:08] so just open your heart
[2:28:14] and I would say Okay Grandpa yeah okay
[2:28:16] okay so yeah yeah
[2:28:18] and the more and more as you grow up
[2:28:21] he would keep telling me that
[2:28:24] and about the time they they he moved
[2:28:27] over here
[2:28:29] I I just knew for some reason
[2:28:33] I just had to be here with him
[2:28:36] and so as I was talking to my parents of
[2:28:39] what we're going to do after graduation
[2:28:44] what are you going to do with your life
[2:28:47] I just said I would surely love to be
[2:28:50] with my grandfather
[2:28:54] and as I told him that
[2:28:57] so why he welcomed me with open arms
[2:29:03] and he made a room in his house for me
[2:29:06] and also many great times that I've had
[2:29:10] with him
[2:29:12] and maybe some new foods that I learned
[2:29:15] to eat
[2:29:18] because one time he said we're gonna
[2:29:20] have tacos
[2:29:23] I'm not gonna say in Spanish I'm gonna
[2:29:25] mess it up
[2:29:26] um with the the cheek of the sheep
[2:29:31] and I said okay cool
[2:29:35] and so I said okay where's the where's
[2:29:37] the dinner at I think oh okay
[2:29:40] and he said well you see the head of
[2:29:42] sheep right there they say oh but I bet
[2:29:44] like
[2:29:45] just grab yourself a tortilla tortilla
[2:29:49] and help yourself it's right there and
[2:29:51] I'm like
[2:29:52] oh man
[2:29:54] even the eyeball was looking at me yeah
[2:29:59] okay
[2:30:02] wow what an awesome man my grandfather
[2:30:06] is
[2:30:08] and just how you just it just impacted
[2:30:10] me so much
[2:30:13] that he'd always encourage you to give
[2:30:15] your bestie
[2:30:19] and the potential that he always saw on
[2:30:22] you
[2:30:23] know even when you didn't see it in
[2:30:25] yourself
[2:30:26] and he would encourage you
[2:30:29] just keep giving your best to the Lord
[2:30:34] even when I get so nervous to sing
[2:30:39] and he at one point would say
[2:30:43] you gotta sing with some fire yeah
[2:30:53] but I think I started understanding as
[2:30:56] you grow up
[2:30:58] when you do give your heart to the Lord
[2:31:01] you're not scared of anybody
[2:31:04] you're just in fear for the Lord
[2:31:08] and you want to give the very best that
[2:31:10] you can
[2:31:12] because the lord gave us the very
[2:31:15] on us
[2:31:17] he didn't hold back on us he didn't hold
[2:31:19] out on us
[2:31:21] he gave us the very best founding Pastor
[2:31:24] yeah
[2:31:27] he gave us the very best pastor
[2:31:30] very best Ministry ministerial and the
[2:31:34] very best people that we could serve
[2:31:37] I just want to thank the Lord
[2:31:40] allowing me to be in his life
[2:31:44] to be one of his servants
[2:31:47] I thank the Lord very much every day for
[2:31:50] him
[2:31:52] I just want to tell you grandpa is
[2:31:56] sure do love you with all my heart
[2:31:59] and we'll see you very soon
[2:32:02] God bless you
[2:32:04] [Applause]
[2:32:23] amen God bless each and every one of you
[2:32:27] I always I'm sure glad brother Abraham
[2:32:29] came up before me oh yes
[2:32:32] all right because every time he's going
[2:32:34] to speak
[2:32:36] I see tears in his future
[2:32:40] and so I'm gonna try to stay away from
[2:32:43] that but
[2:32:45] in a ways uh it's it's a privilege
[2:32:50] um I wanna I didn't know what to say
[2:32:52] because there's so many things to say
[2:32:55] but probably back in about 1978 um
[2:33:01] was looking for the Lord
[2:33:04] and he had met a man else
[2:33:12] and he had gone to church with the
[2:33:14] apostolic church
[2:33:15] apostolica and there he met Brothers
[2:33:20] Well through that he ended up going to a
[2:33:23] message
[2:33:27] there in Grant County Grand County and
[2:33:31] uh one day they were going to have a
[2:33:34] guest Minister
[2:33:36] special and
[2:33:39] um
[2:33:41] my dad had been at work
[2:33:45] and he had been seeking the Lord yes and
[2:33:48] the Lord he had a vision
[2:33:50] and the Lord told him turn
[2:33:54] and as he turned a look
[2:34:06] and he saw a man in a white suit
[2:34:10] well that's Sunday ese Domingo the guest
[2:34:14] minister is
[2:34:17] and he said I heard that man one time
[2:34:28] well he ended up going to church
[2:34:34] and I thank God
[2:34:45] I thank God for my mother
[2:34:50] because I don't know how long my dad
[2:34:52] would help
[2:34:58] but because of her
[2:35:00] we're still here today
[2:35:03] and I remember
[2:35:06] I remember when I was about six years
[2:35:08] old
[2:35:11] my dad said he said Danny medical Danny
[2:35:16] I saw it you're gonna be brother Tommy
[2:35:19] song reader said
[2:35:22] I never forgot that so in my life I
[2:35:26] ended up
[2:35:27] I ended up going astray a little bit
[2:35:30] Yeah if we uh
[2:35:32] well one day as you've heard the
[2:35:34] testimony
[2:35:37] at a youth service
[2:35:40] the Lord changed my heart
[2:35:43] and I remember when I was 17
[2:35:46] years
[2:35:56] and I started I was so scared
[2:35:59] and I started singing
[2:36:01] and I looked to the back of the church
[2:36:04] yeah he was in the back with just
[2:36:11] I would end up
[2:36:22] for over 13 years
[2:36:25] and I can only remember maybe one time
[2:36:29] that he ever asked me to sing another
[2:36:31] song
[2:36:32] [Music]
[2:36:33] and it was they come from the East and
[2:36:35] West
[2:36:39] well and so I can't go without saying
[2:36:42] this
[2:36:43] is
[2:36:48] you say what do you mean by that okay
[2:36:51] he went and got my wife
[2:36:55] permission to marry me
[2:37:00] yeah he went and did I told him brother
[2:37:03] Tommy
[2:37:04] Tomas I want to marry Charlotte
[2:37:07] he said okay okay have you talked to her
[2:37:10] parents
[2:37:12] he said okay call me
[2:37:33] he said I don't know what they're coming
[2:37:35] foreign
[2:37:51] first of all I won't be here
[2:37:54] and I just want to thank the Lord for
[2:37:56] him
[2:37:58] I remember when I was first gonna preach
[2:38:01] I didn't know I was going to pray he
[2:38:05] just said one day where him and I had
[2:38:07] gone for a ride to the black range
[2:38:09] right and he said you're a good driver
[2:38:12] it is a
[2:38:46] and so lastly yesterday I was going home
[2:38:51] and I was listening to a message of his
[2:38:54] and he was talking about the uh
[2:39:01] that did me
[2:39:05] and so he was talking about how the
[2:39:08] blood was sprinkled on that bird yes
[2:39:12] and as I was driving
[2:39:15] there was a bird on the road
[2:39:18] that's right no it wasn't dead
[2:39:21] and so I turned around and I got out and
[2:39:26] I let me pick it up
[2:39:29] and so it was kind of wounded and so I
[2:39:33] took it home and Leona started
[2:39:35] researching uh how the doctor wounded
[2:39:42] had a doctor wounded um
[2:39:49] and it said for many but and this is
[2:39:52] what came up it said for many bird
[2:39:53] lovers the sign of a cardinal holds
[2:39:55] special meaning
[2:40:03] they say that the vibrant red bird is an
[2:40:06] uplifting happy sign that those who have
[2:40:08] lost
[2:40:16] who we have lost will live forever
[2:40:21] so long as we keep them in our memory
[2:40:24] keep their memory alive
[2:40:30] was driving right there
[2:40:33] brother Tommy began to sing this
[2:40:37] let's see if I can get it going here
[2:40:40] here
[2:40:56] foreign

[2:42:48] [Applause]
[2:42:57] good afternoon God bless you
[2:43:01] in 2006
[2:43:04] someone asked me
[2:43:07] significance
[2:43:09] brother Tommy mean to you
[2:43:13] I looked in his eyes and I said I said
[2:43:16] brother
[2:43:37] since that time my life has changed
[2:43:42] a H I remember one time my brother Tommy
[2:43:45] was preaching to me
[2:43:51] what do you see when you look at the
[2:43:54] cross
[2:43:56] and I wanted to put a little bit of
[2:43:59] drama to
[2:44:03] itself
[2:44:09] what a horrible hard day
[2:44:14] Tommy said
[2:44:17] Diego Diego you're airing there
[2:44:20] you know how he is
[2:44:43] because I'm saying through the cross
[2:44:48] I can see what he's made of me
[2:44:54] since that time I knew he was a
[2:44:56] different man Durant
[2:45:01] I was a soldier I was in a military
[2:45:04] service for 16 years
[2:45:07] and I know a man when he has Authority
[2:45:11] when he spoke in
[2:45:15] I said with all respect can I share
[2:45:17] something with you he said sure yo share
[2:45:20] with me
[2:45:22] I said brother Tommy I'm a military man
[2:45:29] I want you to be my general can I call
[2:45:31] you my general
[2:45:35] he heard me said sure I will be your
[2:45:38] general
[2:45:39] I'm remember months later
[2:45:44] brother Tommy was preaching on a Sunday
[2:45:46] it is
[2:46:02] because I am I am his general
[2:46:06] you know how to give you courage
[2:46:13] and went to a restaurant
[2:46:17] we were just barely gotten here to the
[2:46:19] states
[2:46:23] I had a lot of respect for everyone and
[2:46:25] I always have it
[2:46:27] and everyone began to sit in the tables
[2:46:30] around us
[2:46:35] I told my wife let's sit over here in
[2:46:38] the corner nobody else is over here in
[2:46:39] the corner
[2:46:40] he
[2:46:44] is implementation
[2:46:46] he says
[2:46:51] my heartbeat started to go up real fast
[2:46:53] always
[2:47:14] my heart
[2:47:17] is
[2:47:25] I've never known a man with such a
[2:47:27] Supernatural Ministry like brother Tommy
[2:47:29] has
[2:47:32] one time when we were speaking outside
[2:47:34] of the church
[2:47:37] when he sees my wife from a distance
[2:47:42] as I was speaking to my general
[2:47:45] he was looking at my wife that was
[2:47:48] standing far off
[2:47:51] I don't know what's going on and I keep
[2:47:53] speaking
[2:47:57] I had 10 years that we had we hadn't had
[2:47:59] any children
[2:48:04] and tell your wife sister
[2:48:10] you see her pregnant and I see her
[2:48:12] carrying a little boy yes
[2:48:15] 10 years later
[2:48:19] there he is
[2:48:31] you know how he would speak Diego Diego
[2:48:36] I don't understand
[2:48:39] how the pastors or the ministers
[2:48:42] they're scared of the gifts
[2:48:46] I am not scared because
[2:48:49] I prove that they're right
[2:48:52] and if they're wrong
[2:49:04] a few days before my general went home I
[2:49:09] was there with him
[2:49:11] I said my general
[2:49:14] it was a pleasure
[2:49:17] to serve you yeah
[2:49:20] and as I served you General my general
[2:49:24] I'm going to instruct in the life
[2:49:27] and your son Kayla Perez

[2:50:46] before there was a group of people over
[2:50:48] ring of protection it was just him
[2:50:52] the first time I gonna have memories of
[2:50:55] him as a kid
[2:50:59] I was very very afraid of him
[2:51:03] because of the gift
[2:51:06] how he will preach and how he how he
[2:51:09] will how the Lord will use him
[2:51:12] and not just me I mean I remember in one
[2:51:16] of the services
[2:51:17] as a kid I'm looking how the Lord is
[2:51:19] using this man
[2:51:24] just one of the occasions this
[2:51:29] lady comes up to be prayed foreign
[2:52:29] so then he says
[2:52:32] sister you need to confess that to your
[2:52:34] husbands if you want your healing
[2:52:38] and then he looks in the audience yeah
[2:52:41] no I know for a fact he didn't know
[2:52:43] these people
[2:52:46] and and then he looks and then out of
[2:52:49] the other he said you brother you're the
[2:52:51] husband
[2:52:56] and then calls
[2:52:59] and then he said she's sick
[2:53:04] and because of an issue that led that in
[2:53:08] it
[2:53:11] so she needs to confess something
[2:53:15] but she can't do it until you confess
[2:53:18] something because you're the one that
[2:53:20] caused this
[2:53:23] so there was no way around it they
[2:53:26] confessed
[2:53:28] to each other that was into the church
[2:53:31] but you could see that
[2:53:38] but because of the fear that the Lord
[2:53:41] will call out the sin foreign
[2:53:59] I was afraid of the man
[2:54:02] until I met him
[2:54:10] that changed
[2:54:14] um
[2:54:15] to see the Lord
[2:54:19] at a greater level
[2:54:23] um
[2:54:34] they work with my father okay it was
[2:54:39] before there was anybody else
[2:54:44] um
[2:54:45] was very impactful very impactful
[2:54:49] as a kid
[2:54:52] I witnessed ego
[2:54:55] how him and my father became such good
[2:54:58] friends
[2:55:01] and I never seen friendships like that
[2:55:07] I know my dad
[2:55:10] I grew up with him
[2:55:13] and uh I know the type of person he is
[2:55:17] later on later on in life
[2:55:21] I got you
[2:55:23] um
[2:55:24] meet brother Tommy and live with him
[2:55:29] and it's impossible you could get two
[2:55:31] people of those of those characters
[2:55:36] that could ever really be friends
[2:55:40] totally opposite in so many ways
[2:55:46] we have nowadays in the even in the
[2:55:49] message forget about the nominations but
[2:55:51] the message
[2:55:54] discrepancy and separation
[2:55:57] they can
[2:55:59] brother brotherly
[2:56:01] uh disagree on something
[2:56:05] well we're talking about my dad they
[2:56:08] could yeah
[2:56:10] I remember we were living in in Silver
[2:56:13] City in Grandview yeah
[2:56:18] and in one of their many meetings
[2:56:23] as they're just talking to each other
[2:56:26] some subjects that I don't even remember
[2:56:31] and if I wish I wish I would have been
[2:56:34] so dumb you know be able to write down a
[2:56:36] lot of that yeah
[2:56:39] so many things
[2:56:42] they even spoke of this day
[2:56:45] but in some of this there was there was
[2:56:48] arguments between them
[2:56:50] argument yeah there was arguments
[2:56:54] they have the differences
[2:57:08] [Music]
[2:58:00] foreign foreign
[2:59:21] um
[2:59:22] much more we could say
[2:59:26] um
[2:59:27] there's certain sadness
[2:59:30] but he said when this day comes
[2:59:34] he said rejoice and be glad
[2:59:39] you know people in the world don't have
[2:59:42] what we have
[2:59:45] here we are in our day

[3:00:09] or parents or Elders are dealing with
[3:00:12] mortality
[3:00:16] and uh but we all have a promise
[3:00:21] and that promise it just does not change
[3:00:24] is
[3:00:27] promise of restoration just that much
[3:00:30] more greater now
[3:00:33] the Lord permitted me to live with him
[3:00:37] the fellowship of his sufferings
[3:00:42] and what much was learned through there
[3:00:46] times that I feel very contrary
[3:00:50] I will talk to him about it
[3:00:55] expecting you know some some you know
[3:00:57] help me out I feel contrary to a lot of
[3:01:00] things

[3:16:08] [Music]
[3:16:22] ER is so great
[3:16:25] you know the first one that receives you
[3:16:29] is this life is your mother
[3:16:33] no one can touch it because you're
[3:16:37] conceived
[3:16:39] and she Bears you under her heart
[3:16:44] and she is the first
[3:16:47] to know you and the first two in this
[3:16:50] life tooth to hold you
[3:16:55] then when you're born she is a one of
[3:16:58] the first hands that touch and wipes
[3:17:02] back to tears out of your eyes
[3:17:06] she's the first one to patch you to love
[3:17:10] you and to coo over you in this life is
[3:17:15] your mother
[3:17:17] now I think that there is not enough
[3:17:20] honor that we could give to a mother
[3:17:26] mother is
[3:17:28] a first with the child and she's a great
[3:17:32] responsibility of what that child will
[3:17:36] be will be based upon the way that
[3:17:38] mother starts that child
[3:17:41] on the path that it must travel
[3:17:45] mother has the responsibility from God
[3:17:50] to place that child on the right Road
[3:17:56] now I think that's why mothers has a
[3:17:58] special little touch
[3:18:01] you see a child listens to its mother
[3:18:05] some little touch about that mother
[3:18:09] that a child will listen to
[3:18:12] when it's hurt it'll go to the mother
[3:18:15] for consolation
[3:18:17] before it will go to the father
[3:18:20] because she was first with it you know
[3:18:25] and there's some gift that God gives the
[3:18:28] mother to be that way I mean a real
[3:18:30] mother
[3:18:33] I believe that mothers are honorable and
[3:18:36] godly but I believe such as mother days
[3:18:39] like this is a racket
[3:18:41] make a lot of money out of Flowers and
[3:18:43] Things
[3:18:44] but Mother's Day should be every day
[3:18:47] not to send her a bunch of flowers on
[3:18:50] Mother's Day
[3:18:51] but the lover and care for our
[3:18:54] 365 days and nights
[3:18:58] through the year
[3:19:19] don't make Mother's Day a once in a year
[3:19:22] vocation
[3:19:25] okay love your mothers
[3:19:28] visit them as much as you can see them
[3:19:31] be good to them and do as the scripture
[3:19:33] says honor thy father and thy mother
[3:19:36] thank you very much
