[12:28] no more
[12:30] I ain't gonna study War no more ain't
[12:34] gonna study War no more
[12:37] anga study War no more
[12:42] we'll gonna lay down my burden down by
[12:48] the riverside by the river down by the
[12:53] riverside gonna lay down my burden down
[12:58] by the riverside bring a body warm no
[13:04] more a man god bless you
[13:26] I'm going to read Jonah 1 verse 1 now
[13:29] the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the
[13:32] son of Amitai saying arise go to Nineveh
[13:35] that great city and cry against it for
[13:39] their wicked for their wickedness is a
[13:42] had come up before me but Jonah rose up
[13:45] to flee to Tarshish from the presence of
[13:49] the Lord you may be seated
[13:57] how many of you know the story of Jonah
[14:00] Wow what happens in the story of Jonah
[14:10] yeah now in the story of Jonah the Lord
[14:18] asked him to go do something playing
[14:20] brave they were asking to go preach to
[14:23] the people of Nineveh and interval at
[14:25] that time was a really bad place
[14:26] everyone there was really mean and
[14:29] they're all a bunch of crooks so he got
[14:34] scared and he didn't want to do it so he
[14:36] were he ran away and went the completely
[14:38] opposite direction he went to go take a
[14:40] vacation at Tarshish so in this story he
[14:45] goes he gets on the bow with more people
[14:48] that were leaving and then well there
[14:54] they were selling to Tarshish a big
[14:57] storm came and hit them and all the men
[15:01] on the boat were scared and afraid so
[15:03] they all cried unto the other gods and -
[15:07] Jonah what do we do and later and
[15:10] general was asleep at the bottom so they
[15:13] asked him why aren't you crying to your
[15:14] God and he went up and he saw the storm
[15:17] so then he told everyone he said this is
[15:20] my fault
[15:21] throw me throw me overboard and God will
[15:24] stop the storm and they didn't want to
[15:26] do it but when the storm got louder and
[15:29] louder they had no choice but they threw
[15:32] him over and asked God for forgiveness
[15:33] and Jonah go parently couldn't swim he
[15:39] thought you
[15:39] drown well he was drowning he saw a
[15:43] great fish come out from the sea and it
[15:46] swallowed him do you know how long Jonah
[15:51] was in the fish he was in there for
[15:54] three days and three nights so then the
[15:58] fish went back to land and spit Jonah
[16:00] out and Lord came and told him again go
[16:03] to Nineveh and preach the gospel so this
[16:06] time he went to Nineveh and listened to
[16:07] God now the reason that this story was
[16:15] in the Bible is to for us to relate to
[16:16] and sometimes God is going to ask us to
[16:21] do stuff that we don't want to do he's
[16:24] going to ask us to do things that will
[16:25] push us beyond our limits but the story
[16:32] of Jonah shows that even impossible is
[16:35] possible with God like for example
[16:40] whenever my dad asked me to preach for
[16:42] Sunday school for children church I
[16:44] didn't really want to I was a little
[16:48] nervous until I just finally decided to
[16:52] do it so no matter what God asked you to
[16:58] do just do it and be just disciplined
[17:01] because if you have God on your side
[17:03] anything is possible
[17:05] god bless you
[17:06] [Applause]
[17:24] amen
[17:27] this time we're going to ask receive our
[17:30] Minister for the brother will it is I
[17:33] can get you guys to come back up here

[19:54] or
[20:24] Jesus feeds 5000 after these things
[20:28] Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee which
[20:31] is the sea of Tiberias and a great
[20:33] multitude followed him because they saw
[20:35] his miracles which he did on them that
[20:38] were diseased and Jesus went up into a
[20:40] mountain and there he sat with his
[20:43] disciples and the Passover a feast of
[20:46] the Jews was 9 when Jesus then lifted up
[20:49] his eyes and saw a great company coming
[20:52] to him Philip where shall we go to buy
[21:00] food for all these people to eat he
[21:04] asked this only to test him for he
[21:06] already had in mind what he was going to
[21:09] do it'll take more than half a year's
[21:14] wages just to buy enough bread for each
[21:15] one to take a bite
[21:28] Master here's the boy with five low five
[21:30] loaves of bread and two - two fish but
[21:39] how how will we feed this menu with just
[21:44] this much
[21:54] that everyone stood down now there was
[21:58] much grass in the place so the men sat
[22:00] down in number about five thousand and
[22:03] Jesus took the loaves and when he had
[22:05] given thanks father we ask that you
[22:10] would bless this and that you would
[22:13] multiply it Amen Jesus then took the
[22:17] loaves and distributed to those who were
[22:19] seated as much as they wanted he did the
[22:22] same with the fish
[22:42] gather up all the fragments so that
[22:46] nothing may be lost so they gathered
[22:49] them and failed twelve baskets with the
[22:51] pieces of the five barley loaves left
[22:53] over by those who had eaten after the
[22:56] people saw the sign Jesus performed they
[22:59] began to say surely this is the prophet
[23:01] who has come into the world Jesus
[23:03] knowing that they intended to come and
[23:05] make him king by force withdrew again to
[23:08] a mountain by himself Jesus looking
[23:13] Marty's boat to step out in and Jesus
[23:15] never Barras nothing unless he pays you
[23:17] back devil for what he uses if you've
[23:20] got a little faith let him have it
[23:22] awhile he'll make it great I tried like
[23:24] the fishes in the little boy's hand is
[23:26] this stick it only fed him but in Jesus
[23:29] hand had fed 5,000 it may be a little
[23:32] saying with you but just give it over to
[23:33] him and watch him bless it and bless
[23:35] others with it while little faith you
[23:37] have tonight give it over to him and
[23:39] he'll bless it and he'll use it for his
[23:42] glory amen isn't God good then did you
[23:53] enjoyed the little drama just just in
[23:56] just a minute or so a couple minutes but
[23:59] it shows what God can do not with
[24:03] somebody great did you guys notice did
[24:10] you guys notice who brought the fish and
[24:13] the envelopes who was it I'll tell
[24:20] everybody they're laid out boy it was a
[24:22] little boy can you imagine that a little
[24:27] boy just look around we see a little
[24:31] boys here just a young guy that God
[24:35] could use to do something so amazing did
[24:42] you hear the little boy talk did he have
[24:45] any words to say did he have a big
[24:49] sermon to preach but I bet
[24:53] when he left after Jesus fed the 5000 I
[24:57] bet that's that's the only thing he said
[24:59] the rest of his life imagine that he
[25:05] said guess what I did when that was a
[25:09] little without was a little guy maybe
[25:12] about undresses age brother Branham says
[25:15] one thing maybe he went fishing that day
[25:17] maybe he played hooky from school maybe
[25:21] he did other things but what he did is
[25:25] was something so great
[25:26] something that could stay with you for
[25:28] the rest of your life and that one thing
[25:32] you know you know kids that has great of
[25:36] a miracle as Jesus did that that day he
[25:40] could not do it without not only the
[25:44] little boy but without the rest of
[25:46] everyone having a little bit of faith
[25:50] now what's so incredible about the story
[25:53] is that when we read it
[25:56] they weren't inside of a city you know
[26:01] where they were out in the middle of
[26:03] nowhere they were out in the wilderness
[26:06] in a desert place you might see while
[26:09] there's there's trees and green well
[26:12] look we're in the desert right now and
[26:14] it's green right but they were in the
[26:18] middle of nowhere and you know what they
[26:23] were in church all day long whoa okay we
[26:33] went to church this morning right right
[26:36] what time did we come to church about
[26:40] nine o'clock right some of you got here
[26:42] at 9:00 awesome some of you got here
[26:44] 10:15 try again next time but it's okay
[26:49] we still got here but imagine they were
[26:51] still having church at this time Jesus
[26:55] comes then he's and he's telling it and
[26:57] he's and he's sharing things with them
[27:00] all day long yawn dead all day long what
[27:05] have you done all day long have you
[27:06] played video games all
[27:07] long maybe watch TV all day long is this
[27:12] guy
[27:13] she says he tries to play games all day
[27:15] long fries doesn't say that he does it
[27:19] but he tried but imagine she's he's
[27:23] still there in church all day long it's
[27:26] hot
[27:28] who they don't have comfortable chairs
[27:30] like you guys have some might be sitting
[27:33] on a rock some might be sitting on the
[27:35] grass so my bike some might be sitting
[27:40] on on dirt all day long and after a
[27:45] while who sometimes after 30 minutes or
[27:50] like man George is getting long right no
[27:55] no right after an hour oh my goodness
[28:00] two hours Wow but imagine after 910
[28:05] hours

[28:09] have breakfast they didn't even have
[28:14] lunch and dinners approaching oh my
[28:19] goodness what are we going to do oh
[28:23] maybe we could order some Domino's it
[28:29] was out of the delivery zone abdominal
[28:31] runners they were in the middle of
[28:34] nowhere there was no restaurants there
[28:36] was no place where they could eat so
[28:41] what were they going to do Jesus as he
[28:44] sees this multitude that has followed
[28:47] him from the city
[28:49] the disciples were like oh my goodness
[28:52] how in the world are we going to feed
[28:54] all these people that's when Jesus says

[29:11] a job how can you buy buy food without
[29:16] having a job who disciples I hope you

[29:33] half a year's wages just not just to
