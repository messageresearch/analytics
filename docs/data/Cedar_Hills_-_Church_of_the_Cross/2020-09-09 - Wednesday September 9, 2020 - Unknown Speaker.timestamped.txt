[27:52] amen i believe those of us that have
[27:56] well maybe some have more years behind

[28:04] road you've come through
[28:06] take a look at the hills you take a look
[28:10] at the valleys
[28:12] and not of our own merit but by

[29:16] to be able to hear from god himself
[29:20] through the mouthpiece of our brother
[29:21] jerry de lau
[29:24] i'm excited i can't wait to hear what he
[29:27] has in store for me tonight
[29:31] let's sing that song
[29:38] and i don't know about you but that's my
[29:40] prayer
[29:41] i just want to be submerged by him
[29:49] that's a little too low for me brother
[29:50] will or maybe a little
[29:52] higher
[29:55] [Music]
[30:15] [Music]
[30:20] oh
[30:24] [Music]
[30:49] foreign
[30:53] [Music]
[31:08] [Music]
[31:16] know
[31:19] [Music]
[31:45] [Music]
[31:54] [Music]
[32:02] [Music]
[32:07] [Applause]
[32:08] [Music]
[32:10] [Applause]
[32:12] foreign
[32:14] [Music]
[32:21] [Music]
[32:26] is
[32:30] [Music]
[32:32] amen god bless you this evening
[32:38] the pleasure this evening to address the
[32:40] bride of christ
[32:59] i don't want to say throw this together
[33:01] quickly but i had to put it together
[33:02] quickly
[33:08] but god is good amen amen as long as
[33:11] we're obedient to his word
[33:16] god when we realize that it's not us but
[33:18] that it's him
[33:21] it's not my words my words will fail
[33:26] but god's words
[33:29] god's word will never fail us
[33:34] just uh we won't have you standing too
[33:36] long if we can just open our bibles to
[33:38] first peter 1 13.
[33:44] pedro uno dresa
[33:52] and it reads wherefore
[33:56] gird up the loins of your mind
[34:01] be sober and hope to the end
[34:04] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[34:06] you
[34:07] at the revelation of jesus christ
[34:24] and also if we go to first peter 5
[34:27] starting with verse 8 pedro cinco
[34:35] and it reads be sober
[34:38] be vigilant because your adversary the
[34:42] devil
[34:43] as a roaring lion
[35:06] amen may the lord add the blessing to
[35:07] the remnants word and you may be seated
[35:13] so we see in in in these first two
[35:15] scriptures
[35:19] number one it says gird up the loins of
[35:21] your mind
[35:26] that might sound kind of strange right
[35:31] because normally when you say gird up
[35:32] your loins you want you want to put a
[35:34] belt around your waist
[35:39] but here he's saying gird up the loins
[35:41] of your mind
[35:55] especially in these last days
[35:59] but but both of them have the word sober
[36:05] so so so when we think of the word sober
[36:12] we go to uh like i used to do a lot of i
[36:15] used to drink a lot
[36:18] and i guarantee you i wasn't sober
[36:22] but being sober you want to be in your
[36:24] right
[36:35] of that same scripture first peter 1 13.
[36:38] yes
[36:48] therefore with their minds that are
[36:50] alert
[36:51] and fully sober
[37:06] and then there's another version that i
[37:08] read
[37:10] and it says therefore prepare your minds
[37:14] for action
[37:18] so in other words we're preparing for a
[37:21] battle estamos
[37:22] preparanta right that's correct
[37:27] let me read this quote from brother
[37:30] branham
[37:32] the greatest battle ever fought
[37:57] and he says i believe that the greatest
[37:59] battle that was ever fought
[38:02] is
[38:18] [Applause]
[38:29] you know the bible says gird up the
[38:31] lines of your mind
[38:33] [Music]
[38:38] um and this phrase girl up the loins
[38:42] yes yes
[38:46] comes from the greek word forgive me if
[38:50] i don't pronounce and write but it says
[38:56] what it's referring to it's it's the
[38:58] oriental's back
[39:00] in the day
[39:03] they were dressed in long robes
[39:08] they had to lift up the ropes
[39:11] they had to get the loose ends
[39:15] and tuck them into their waist
[39:18] so when they would run korean it was in
[39:22] track and field and different running
[39:23] events
[39:34] so we're in a race right now we're in a
[39:36] battle right now
[39:39] and we've got to have our minds clear
[39:43] we can't have any hindrances
[39:47] that that that is clogging our minds
[39:52] brother branham says we've got to keep
[39:53] the channel free it is
[40:06] then you can't get the word of god
[40:08] inside of it
[40:21] right can i name a few
[40:25] algunos
[40:30] that's a hindrance yes
[40:33] it's a hindrance yes it impedes me from
[40:36] what i need to get done
[40:40] and if doubt doesn't line up with god's
[40:42] word
[40:45] then we gotta get rid of it because
[40:48] doubt is gonna come in
[40:55] when i got sick with the virus
[40:59] it was it was pretty rough
[41:02] and um the first few days los primeros
[41:05] diaz i was up and down
[41:06] estaba um but there was three days
[41:12] that i was at my weakest guest
[41:15] i didn't want to do nothing i wanted to
[41:18] sleep
[41:20] i pretty much slept day and night
[41:23] i couldn't eat i was at my weakest
[41:28] and the devil comes to me
[41:31] and he he tries to give me a loose end
[41:35] and he says i thought the lord was going
[41:37] to take care of you
[41:41] look at your condition look at what he
[41:45] i went with this for three days
[41:49] because it wasn't just a physical battle
[41:53] it turned into a spiritual battle
[41:57] and he attacked me at my weakest
[42:02] and finally the second or third day
[42:07] and i said devil your
[42:10] your words do not line up with god's
[42:13] word
[42:15] because whether i'm in this condition
[42:19] the bible says in isaiah
[42:22] yes by his stripes we are already healed
[42:26] so no matter what you say
[42:41] out of your mind
[42:56] eve and he disarmed her when she started
[43:00] to reason with god's word
[43:07] right we want a question and we want to
[43:10] why this
[43:10] why
[43:54] say you plant the seed of faith
[44:00] because faith is a seed
[44:02] [Music]
[44:03] and you got to plant it
[44:06] you
[44:31] but if our mind is all clogged
[44:48] because
[45:13] what's one of the worst inventions ever
[45:16] made
[45:27] and maybe it didn't look right what they
[45:29] were doing
[45:30] no
[46:25] and in that day i hope i've had my mind
[46:28] clear yes
[46:31] i've had my channel open my canal
[46:34] to to to have god's word
[46:38] the seed of god's word
[46:53] because the greatest battle ever fought
[46:55] is going on
[46:59] and satan chose the mind
[47:03] he chose the mind why
[47:07] probably because you have ears
[47:11] you know i i i always uh
[47:15] when i go to work i have the radio on
[47:21] my i love sports so i'm listening to
[47:23] sports radio yo
[47:24] alma los de portes esta estoy but i find
[47:28] out when you're listening to
[47:29] to different things like that
[47:33] whether it be news whether it be radio
[47:37] csl
[47:38] radio whether it be christian music yes
[47:41] musica cristiana
[47:42] whether it be worldly music music
[47:45] there's always something that sticks
[47:46] with you
[47:49] and that's the last thing you hear yes
[48:39] pretty soon there's no difference
[48:40] between you and them because you're
[48:41] talking like them
[48:58] every day of the week we gotta keep our
[49:00] minds filled
[49:02] with this word
[49:05] because when you fight your enemy you
[49:07] gotta know your enemies
[49:11] and you gotta know your enemy is out to
[49:14] destroy
[49:27] utterly just destroy
[49:42] then you will have the tools to fight in
[49:44] this battle
[49:46] because when you go out to fight in a
[49:48] war
[49:50] you have weapons you have protection
[49:54] and god wants to disarm you of your
[49:56] protection
[50:22] you have no protection
[50:58] but you can't just fill it up with junk
[51:00] but
[51:03] you can't just fill it up with junk no
[51:07] you can't just watch tv all day
[51:10] television you can't just deal with the
[51:12] world all day
[51:15] young people i don't know if you have
[51:17] trouble with this but you can't listen
[51:18] to worldly music all day long
[51:49] no no no uh don't do
[51:52] god's word keep your mind in your heart
[51:59] you're gonna need these weapons
[52:04] brother branham he he speaks hermano
[52:06] brandise and he says
[52:08] you have your five
[52:11] yes senses
[52:29] and he says they're all they're they're
[52:32] all right
[52:36] but he says but don't trust him unless
[52:38] they agree with god's word
[52:43] so you have all these senses these
[52:46] hearings
[52:48] the smell the see
[52:51] but what if what you see doesn't line up
[52:53] with god's word
[52:58] he says you gotta get rid of it
[53:01] if what you're hearing doesn't line up
[53:03] with god
[53:06] then you gotta get rid of it so we gotta
[53:09] gird up the loins of our mind this
[53:12] evening
[53:26] to hear what you're not supposed to hear
[53:29] but to hear god's word
[53:34] brother branham also says now you have
[53:36] imaginations
[53:40] you have a conscience unconsensual you
[53:42] have memories
[53:43] memoria reasons and affections
[53:47] affection they're all right
[53:52] if they agree with the word
[54:23] whatever disagrees with god's word
[54:28] get rid of it don't hang on to it
[54:33] because the scripture says straight is
[54:50] when you get in there when you're
[54:53] walking through
[54:56] you can't have all the garbage hanging
[54:58] on
[55:01] you can't have all this baggage hanging
[55:04] on
[55:06] that's where the sword of the spirit
[55:08] comes in
[55:10] and he's got to cut that garbage
[55:15] he's got to cut the doubt off he's got
[55:18] to cut the unbelief off
[55:21] he's got a cut talking about your
[55:23] brother and your sister off
[55:26] he's got a cut talking about the pastor
[55:27] in the ministry
[55:38] because we don't keep our baggage and
[55:40] make the gate fit us
[55:46] uh
[56:10] but then you bring all that garbage
[56:12] inside with you
[56:28] so if we want to be successful in our
[56:30] spiritual life
[56:34] and truly walk with god
[56:38] that we must start dealing with the
[56:40] loins of our mind
[56:44] in other words we must seek to deal with
[56:46] all the loose ends
[56:51] in our thinking that haven't yet been
[56:55] been submitted to the word of god
[57:02] are surrendered to the holy spirit's
[57:03] power
[57:10] if we deliberately see uh
[57:16] if we deliberately allow wrong thinking
[57:24] game
[57:28] and wrong thing and wrong believing
[57:33] to continue in our lives
[57:36] that'll be the biggest mistake ever
[57:44] you know how many how many has come into
[57:45] a situation in their lives
[57:50] whether something happens
[58:05] i'll deal with it another day yeah
[58:08] the next day comes oh i'll leave it
[58:10] there i'll deal with it later
[58:15] before you know it you haven't dealt
[58:17] with it
[58:18] [Music]
[58:20] almost and it started off as a little
[58:23] pile
[58:26] next thing it's a big old mess
[58:31] from the beginning
[58:34] because fighting the battle is not how
[58:36] long you can make the battle okay
[58:42] but it's to put a stop to it right then
[58:43] and there yes
[58:46] don't make the battle longer than it has
[59:25] you can't ask for something and live any
[59:26] kind of life you want to promote
[1:00:14] but don't disbelieve god's word this
[1:00:16] evening but know this
[1:00:19] because god's word is true
[1:00:23] god's word will keep you la palabras
[1:00:34] i can read john 10 10 1 the sds
[1:00:45] the thief cometh not before to steal
[1:00:49] and to kill and to destroy
[1:00:54] el dorado
[1:01:08] but not just life
[1:01:11] and it says that they that they might
[1:01:14] have it
[1:01:14] more abundantly
[1:01:18] he doesn't just want to give you life
[1:01:21] he wants to give it to you more
[1:01:22] abundantly
[1:01:25] because a thief is going to come to your
[1:01:27] mind
[1:01:30] and he's going to try and steal
[1:01:34] he's going to try and rob you and take
[1:01:35] you away from god's word
[1:02:01] and he's going to try and bluff his way
[1:02:03] into your inside of your heart
[1:02:23] [Applause]

[1:02:32] this
[1:03:00] but that didn't end right there
[1:03:06] he says i didn't get you
[1:03:09] but i'm gonna try and take somebody
[1:03:10] close to you
[1:03:14] and he attacked
[1:03:28] because i stand on god's word
[1:03:31] and he know i know what he can do if i
[1:03:33] just believe
[1:03:37] and i saw my mom today
