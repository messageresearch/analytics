[23:26] doesn't sound like it goes with the
[23:28] season tonight a little
[23:32] bit Yeah but it
[23:36] does and it's called the Great Center of
[23:44] power in the
[23:47] universe turn to your neighbor and say
[23:50] would you like to know what that great
[23:52] Center of power
[23:56] is oh maybe it's way off in space
[24:02] somewhere
[24:05] my praise the
[24:08] Lord so I guess this isn't working
[24:11] tonight so end up turning around don't
[24:13] want to do
[24:17] that so let's go ahead and turn in our
[24:19] scriptures we going start with
[24:26] Luke the second
[24:29] chapter and we're going to
[24:31] start with verse 6 and read through
[24:33] verse
[24:35] [Music]
[24:37] 11 and this is the scripture used for
[24:40] the Christmas
[24:44] message and and we all understand that
[24:48] uh Jesus was not born on the 25th of
[24:51] December we understand
[24:56] that what we're going to read here that
[24:58] the Shepherds were watching their sheep
[24:59] by
[25:04] night and in the winter time there in
[25:09] Palestine there's about two or three
[25:11] feet of snow on those
[25:16] mountains and the Sheep are in the
[25:21] coral number
[25:23] two when are lambs
[25:26] born
[25:29] Springtime but I don't want to go into
[25:31] that just just so we
[25:35] understand when Jesus was really
[25:38] born let's start reading with verse
[25:42] six and so it was that while they were
[25:45] there the days were accomplished that
[25:47] she should be
[25:53] delivered and she brought forth the her
[25:57] firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling
[25:59] clothes laid him in a Manger because
[26:03] there was no room for him in the
[26:13] end and there were in that same country
[26:15] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[26:19] watch over their flock by
[26:26] night and Lo the angel of the Lord Came
[26:29] Upon them and the glory of the Lord
[26:32] Shone round about them and they were
[26:34] sore
[26:42] afraid and the angel said unto them fear
[26:45] not for behold I bring you good tidings
[26:47] of great joy which shall be for all of
[26:51] the people in Los cres New
[26:56] Mexico
[27:01] and let's let's read verse 11 together
[27:04] real
[27:07] slow for unto you is Born This Day in
[27:12] the city of David which is savior which
[27:16] is Christ the
[27:25] Lord let us pray Lord
[27:28] Jesus we love you with all of our hearts
[27:32] Lord we bless your holy name God we
[27:35] thank you for this privilege
[27:39] Lord and we just commit oursel into your
[27:42] hands Lord
[27:45] Jesus in the precious name of our Lord
[27:47] and Savior Jesus
[27:51] Christ amen you may be
[27:56] seated where would this great Center of
[27:59] power
[28:03] be in the
[28:06] universe let's give the definition of
[28:08] the word Universe
[28:12] first and one of the more humanly
[28:16] definitions of
[28:20] universe is the world of Human
[28:26] Experience so if you're in God's
[28:31] Universe you've got to be in his
[28:35] world where you can have an experience
[28:37] with
[28:39] him how many came to have an experience
[28:42] with him
[28:44] tonight amen
[28:46] amen now this next definition of
[28:48] Universe I'm going to read real
[28:52] slow so that you can pick up on
[28:54] something
[28:56] here it states this is Webster's
[28:59] Dictionary by the way Webster and man
[29:03] does the very best he can to try to
[29:06] understand these
[29:09] things even though he's
[29:12] limited so we're not saying that all
[29:14] these definitions are exactly this this
[29:17] way
[29:19] right but part of it shows what's inside
[29:23] of
[29:25] man and what he's crying out
[29:29] for and why he feels the way he
[29:33] feels how many of you have ever felt
[29:40] powerless
[29:42] nobody oh you have hands okay how many
[29:46] of you have felt
[29:50] powerless well I could do this too
[29:53] right but God has a great Center of
[29:57] power in the
[29:59] universe how many would like to tap into
[30:02] that
[30:05] tonight my we could get into some good
[30:08] stuff
[30:10] here now this definition says a
[30:13] systematic
[30:17] whole words all that's complete that
[30:19] makes a hold o l
[30:25] e a systematic H held to arise by and
[30:31] persist to the direct
[30:34] intervention of divine
[30:43] power wow wow everything is going to be
[30:47] held
[30:50] together it's going to be able to rise
[30:53] up by and and it's going to be able to
[30:56] persist
[30:59] by the divine intervention of God's
[31:04] power and that's why you and I are here
[31:08] tonight now as we start this I want to
[31:11] read this first
[31:16] quote praise the Lord
[31:18] Jesus I think they're going to put it up
[31:24] here yes that's it but let me get it on
[31:28] my tablet since this isn't
[31:30] working I got it right
[31:33] here oh it's in the back if I can see it
[31:37] okay now we could have God get in
[31:42] continuity amongst the Medics and
[31:45] amongst the scientists and different
[31:47] ones
[31:54] no if Einstein only had the spiritual
[31:59] application as he had the physical
[32:08] application as he studied the laws of
[32:11] light and so forth he could have told us
[32:22] something when I heard his message on
[32:25] that great Center s somewhere in the
[32:32] skies oh man he heard a message from
[32:37] Einstein well he was tremendous in the
[32:39] Physical
[32:41] Realm but the prophet saying if he could
[32:43] have got the spiritual application of
[32:46] what he was
[32:51] seeing watch what would
[32:53] happen that ever contacted with that
[33:00] Center you could create
[33:03] Earth do
[33:06] anything and the power would be
[33:11] unlimited my how many still want to get
[33:15] into the center of God's great power in
[33:18] this
[33:19] universe
[33:24] somewhere okay now going to go back
[33:27] before there was
[33:31] light we've got to find out where this
[33:33] great Center
[33:36] is let's go to Exodus chapter
[33:41] 20
[33:43] amen praise the Lord
[33:46] Jesus and we're starting with Verse 18 I
[33:49] believe
[33:52] yes and all the people saw the Thunders
[33:55] and the Lightnings and the noise of the
[33:58] trumpet and of the mountains smoking and
[34:01] when the people saw it they removed and
[34:04] stood a far
[34:16] off they got
[34:18] scared do you still know today that most
[34:21] people are
[34:24] scared of the super natural moving of
[34:29] God and in a symbolic way
[34:33] we we let God come this close and we go
[34:39] okay that's far enough that's far
[34:44] enough next verse
[34:46] 19 and they said unto Moses speak thou
[34:50] with us and we will hear but let not God
[34:55] speak to us lest we
[35:04] die well that's how serious it
[35:07] was imagine seeing the mountain
[35:11] shaking
[35:13] lightning and
[35:15] smoke and they say hey hey we don't want
[35:18] nothing to do with
[35:21] that next
[35:23] verse and Moses said unto the people
[35:26] fear not for God is come to prove
[35:30] you and that he his fear may be before
[35:35] your faces that ye s
[35:47] not oh he wants to prove what's on the
[35:50] inside of
[35:53] us he wants to prove that we are elect
[35:59] yes he he want as much as he declared
[36:02] that this is my beloved Son hear ye
[36:07] him he wants to declare this is my
[36:09] beloved
[36:12] bride pleased to
[36:15] dwell don't listen to me no
[36:18] more listen to
[36:21] her and you understand in what sense I'm
[36:23] saying
[36:25] that without going into
[36:29] details verse
[36:32] 21 and the people stood a far off and
[36:36] Moses Drew near unto the thick Darkness
[36:40] where God
[36:48] was I thought God was
[36:52] light he's dwelling in
[36:55] darkness
[36:57] then what's all this lightning and smoke
[37:03] and and pillars of
[37:06] fire those things are just a sign that
[37:09] he's real close
[37:13] by but Moses had to go into the thick
[37:19] Darkness where God
[37:21] was and many people say how is it that
[37:24] God is light and yet he he was in
[37:29] darkness that word dark there or
[37:31] darkness in the Hebrew does not mean
[37:33] night like it is right
[37:39] now it's referring to enter into a place
[37:44] of the
[37:48] unknown and he was the only one
[37:50] predestinated of
[37:53] God to go into that place
[37:57] where there was
[37:59] nothing all these manifestations that
[38:01] were happening on the
[38:04] mountain show that he was
[38:07] there but there had to be somebody that
[38:10] could go in there where he
[38:13] was and it was unknown to the
[38:17] people it's not that it was night
[38:20] time let me ask you could that be the
[38:24] great Center of power
[38:35] Universe oh I got you thinking that's
[38:39] good amen
[38:42] amen we'll get to
[38:44] that give me that the second quote we've
[38:47] got up
[38:51] there
[38:55] amen then when I came back to this
[38:59] place and I had been thinking when I
[39:02] said
[39:06] limit that meant five
[39:09] squirrels which is the limited
[39:12] Indiana indana but I remember last year
[39:15] when he asked me how many did it take
[39:19] for me a mess I said
[39:25] three
[39:28] I just got the
[39:31] three how manyan you know he killed
[39:33] Three
[39:34] Squirrels they appeared he with a rifle
[39:37] and he
[39:41] goes is that a vision and then he goes
[39:43] and picks it up
[39:44] oh Visions don't
[39:47] bleed how many
[39:50] remember three and I just got the three
[39:54] so yesterday I went back and and was
[39:56] going to the same place again and
[39:59] something said do not go cross the
[40:09] road was he couldna go into the great
[40:12] Center of
[40:15] power what was going to
[40:18] happen now God was going to move in a
[40:21] different
[40:24] way and it wasn't going to even be in
[40:26] the same place where he killed the first
[40:29] [Music]
[40:31] three amen let's
[40:36] continue amen and exactly 10:00 on the
[40:40] exact dot 10 o00 with my watch I shot
[40:44] the Indiana limit of five and I want you
[40:47] to not notice there was there
[40:55] rainbows
[41:03] and there was three things
[41:08] said three Scrolls
[41:11] gotten Three Squirrels by 10
[41:15] o00 and the Sun was
[41:19] shining and 30
[41:21] minutes and there were three things to
[41:24] give Witness
[41:27] brother Woods Bank Woods Bank brother
[41:30] Billy Paul Billy Paul and his son David
[41:36] and they gave witness to
[41:38] it amen and he goes on to
[41:42] say that these three rainbows all came
[41:47] into
[41:49] one and as he was walking through the
[41:52] canyon he heard a
[41:55] voice
[41:58] Jehovah of the Old
[42:02] Testament is Jesus of the
[42:06] new oh Father Son and Holy
[42:10] Ghost Lord Jesus
[42:13] Christ I want you to notice in the
[42:15] scripture in
[42:17] Luke after this baby was born
[42:21] this this gift that had been wrapped in
[42:24] human flesh
[42:28] the announcement was he is Christ the
[42:33] lord from the time that named
[42:38] Jesus from the time that Jesus was
[42:41] spoken by the angel to
[42:44] Mary and mared to
[42:47] Joseph and mared to
[42:49] Elizabeth
[42:51] Elizabeth they were the only ones that
[42:53] had heard the audable name of
[43:01] Jesus it was still a secret to the
[43:06] public and God here wants them to know
[43:09] when he declares it and the angels come
[43:11] down and
[43:17] sing he wants them to know what this
[43:20] baby really
[43:23] is before the human name of God is
[43:27] spoken to
[43:31] them because otherwise if Jesus was
[43:34] [Applause]
[43:38] born he's just a man his name is
[43:42] Jesus but this baby that was
[43:45] born was Christ the anointed
[43:49] one the
[43:51] Lord God that spoke to Moses
[43:56] in thick
[43:58] darkness that was
[44:00] unknown that was beginning to form a
[44:03] great Center of
[44:07] power oh that great Center had not yet
[44:10] been formed
[44:12] yet he didn't want them to hear the name
[44:14] of Jesus
[44:16] yet he want them to know what Jesus
[44:22] was he was the Anointed God
[44:28] Christ the
[44:30] Lord praise and living name of our
[44:36] God so was that the great Center of
[44:42] power in the
[44:44] universe oh that's right where it
[44:47] started oh but I don't want to leave
[44:50] nobody
[44:52] out let's read our next
[44:54] scripture
[44:57] in
[44:58] Psalms
[45:02] 139 11 through
[45:06] 15 to see what this thick Darkness
[45:11] was and why you you couldn't understand
[45:15] it and how God hid
[45:21] it verse
[45:23] 11 now everybody know here that David
[45:26] thealist is speaking in the personal
[45:32] pronoun I if I
[45:35] say and when he says if I
[45:39] say that's talking about
[45:43] Christ
[45:45] Lord is talking about the anointed
[45:49] one he's talking about the
[45:53] Messiah if I say surely the Darkness
[45:56] shall cover
[46:00] me no wonder what Moses had to go into
[46:02] the thick
[46:05] Darkness that's where you are going to
[46:07] find the anointed Messiah beginning
[46:14] formed next
[46:19] verse yes the darkness hideth not from
[46:24] thee but the night shineth as the
[46:30] day and the Darkness as the light are
[46:34] both alike to
[46:42] thee they're the same to you it is the
[46:44] same in other words God's not it's not
[46:47] okay it's night time no no
[46:50] signific oh it's
[46:52] daytime Cosmic light he's not going
[46:56] doing anything based on what we know as
[46:59] light and darkness as
[47:04] humans but it's something that's
[47:07] unknown it's something that's never
[47:10] happened in the human race
[47:13] before next
[47:17] verse I will praise
[47:21] thee for for thou Hast possessed my ring
[47:30] thou has covered me in my mother's
[47:37] W you couldn't see
[47:40] him he was
[47:43] hidden God covered
[47:45] him God protected
[47:48] him God created his own incubator as our
[47:51] founding Pastor would
[47:54] say there was a womb created inside of
[47:57] her
[48:00] room no cell that was contaminated with
[48:03] sin could touch that Holy
[48:08] thing so God covered him in his mother's
[48:14] womb oh do you see the great power
[48:16] coming forth
[48:19] yet what do you think James James is
[48:23] that the great Center of power
[48:27] what do you anybody
[48:29] else is that it is that is that all
[48:32] there is to
[48:34] it
[48:36] amen let's read the next
[48:39] verse I will praise thee for I am
[48:42] fearfully and wonderfully
[48:48] made marvelous are thy
[48:52] works and that my soul knoweth right
[48:55] right
[48:58] well and all many see right there is the
[49:04] Messiah but do you want to know where
[49:07] you are at this
[49:11] point in the
[49:13] scripture where are you where is the
[49:17] life that God was going to put in
[49:20] you and this point of the
[49:24] unfolding
[49:26] of this great Center of
[49:30] power something that would be in
[49:32] relation to Human
[49:36] Experience something that would hold
[49:38] this world
[49:40] together and help us
[49:43] persist and only persist by God's divine
[49:49] intervention have to come from this
[49:51] great Center somewhere out there that
[49:54] like Einstein said
[49:58] Einstein but if it just stayed out here
[50:02] somewhere you couldn't have contact with
[50:06] it then it would do you no
[50:09] good God was going to have to bring
[50:13] it to where you could touch the H of His
[50:18] Garment where you could touch
[50:21] him and he could be touched of
[50:24] you touched by the feeling of your
[50:30] infirmities hallelujah

[51:26] form this great Center of
[51:30] power and bring it from the god of the
[51:34] universe to an amateur God on
[51:38] Earth so that that power that was way
[51:40] out some where like Einstein
[51:44] said Einstein would no longer be way out
[51:47] there
[51:48] somewhere it would be made
