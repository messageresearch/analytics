bless you amen you may be seated we're going to be asking our brother Julian Hill to come read his poem uh following what would be uh our sister Lula nahida amen and God bless you it's cold and there's a lot of people out sick but uh you all still look great so I'm happy to be here as long as you're happy to be here uh my Spanish poet is not here tonight he's actually out sick too brother no Reyes and so uh unfortunately I have to do this just in English tonight but um as with all the poems I want to give a bit of backstory for this one uh when I first started doing my poetry about a year ago I started to create works that were for for folks who weren't necessarily Believers but also for folks who were and uh when I would send them out and give them to people a lot of times uh I'd get statements like you know uh I'm an atheist but uh when I read your poetry I think about it and so it was it was an interesting thing and I really started to kind of identify where my work was meant to help and how to how to use it more but um this the reason why I say that is because this piece is is very much in line with that uh with that with that message and so uh for you all I have a book that I haven't published and I'm going to start reading it today and then in about five months we'll be done with it um but this is uh the book is titled all things natural a series of unnatural Poetics and this is the first poem in that piece and it is called in the beginning it is said that God made the heavens and the Earth through Power of the spoken word further he States let us make man in our image within the days of this creation that is to say if nature is of God and we are of God nay the spitting image of God then who is it we see when gazing upon such landscapes to gaze upon a landscape is breathtaking wondrous whether that be a landscape of Earth us or others regardless of what we look upon we still look at one thing the ever-living god in all his creation is like looking at someone's art that hangs in the museum wall we do not believe that the painting painted itself and hung itself there we believe that the artist who painted it hung it after making such a beautiful painting thus if we can extend our faith to an unknown unseen and unheard artist who uses the elements of oil and color then how can we not extend our faith to God creator of nature he who painted the greatest Beauties upon the greatest canvas a canvas of universal proportions defying all known knowledge it is terrible how much Faith some have in things that are it is terrible how much Faith some have and things that won't save them it is tragic that they will not once Ponder the existence of God they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder so who do we behold when looking upon the vastness of nature to whom was this piece sold Sid a while in this patch pasture and break the common mold turn the pages read the poems in search of precious gold God bless you [Applause] foreign I like to share a testimony with you for a few years ago and I think brother Caleb for allowing me to share it with you a few years ago I was asleep madrugada I don't remember if it was early in the morning and a voice uh woke me up and they told me Mr Lula do the thing with caution and through Bay the Veil there's something for you and when I woke up I said Lord is it was the voice of brother Tommy speaking and I am sure that it was his voice and I said Lord I don't know what it is but I know that it said caution but I don't know what by year they they um it sounded like the see yes and I went to the dictionary to look up this word and it means that this arrest for the ship is [Music] and I started to think well what is this is it that I am the ship and after a few years has passed and at my house I was sweeping the living room [Music] and when I was sweeping I looked to my table yes [Music] and I saw there sitting down brother Tommy and brother Bernie yeah and I was ashamed because when I was sweeping I turned and I looked and then I saw them sitting there yesterday I was kind of ashamed because they wouldn't speak or say anything to me [Music] yes and then after that a few years passed there were some conventions there in Albuquerque and brother Bernie was there in the hotel at the restaurant [Music] and I would pass back and forth and I really wanted to go tell him that I would see him and brother Tommy restaurant and I was a shame because he was there at the hotel in the restaurant by himself and I didn't want to go there after a while the brothers [Music] and I asked him brother may I speak to brother Bernie I'd like to ask him something he said yes sister go ahead there's no one here now you have the time [Music] and I told him I want to tell you something brother I've seen you and brother Tommy in my house you begin to speak to me other things and he wouldn't tell me within my heart I was asking if he was going to tell me but he didn't say tell me yesterday [Music] we begin to speak of brother banham and his family is and I forgot because I liked what he was telling me and at the end he finally told me and at that time the restaurant began to fill up and a lot more people started to come in with time I don't know how to sing I don't know how to write songs or to play musica but I love music [Music] one day I was playing uh [Music] and at the moment words begin to come down to my heart I began to write what came down to my heart yesterday and not knowing at that time at the bay the ship was coming to the bay and the next time I'm here I would like to share that song with you that was inspired by God to me and in that song it says what happened thank you [Applause] hey man God bless the poem and the testimony and ask that you would please stand without further Ado we'd like to introduce our our founding Pastor tonight he's going to be bringing you forth we're going to be hearing a message things that are to be part for all right [Music] foreign [Music] oh such [Music] as [Music] across where I first saw the lights and the verdict foreign [Music] [Music] today I'll give Safeway so [Music] we're still I went home [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we lost muchas [Applause] [Music] I oh [Music] hey evidence Holy City amen you may be seated [Music] if you would just open your Bibles to the gospel of Saint John music and we're going to read verse chapter 14 first two verses and it says like this if you would stand to honor God's word and may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of this word let not your heart be troubled a lot of trouble in the heart right now huh you believe in God people say I believe God well here it says believe also in me well I believe God but I don't believe you understand you can't make it I believe in both you'll see why in My Father's House are many mentions we were translated in my father's domain our many palaces are all these branhams no no they're your converts but they're not Brandon that's why in my father's house if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place amen you may be seated now it's good to see you Carlos with your precious wife there and it's good to see you Mr Wilson good to see you here with us this is hey man Peggy's husband God bless you it's good to see brother have brother Fidel back with us he was in the hospital for three four days got kind of a virus but we thank God and been so much going on I you know I I stay busy all day and practically half of the night you know but I don't complain because God gives me the strength to keep on Amen the Millennium the millennium what a good message Wednesday tell that brother Abraham can really teach I really enjoy him when he's up there he said he's he said he's not a preacher and now he's a preacher teacher Maestro he's a pretty good preacher for me I I I was talking to brother Bernie one day and brother Bernie told me he said I'm not a preacher I said you're pretty good to me and it depends who's hearing them it depends escucha amen I like men that know what they're talking about and in these times that we live in United States it's hard to find this man they they were talking to a man from Albuquerque and he goes to church with brother and he said I this this friend of mine came from Arkansas and he said that he's his Pastor really teaches the truth he preaches that doctors are of the devil Diablo and brother said hold it one minute he said we we've heard the very best come from Silver City and he said and uh we've been taught that doctors and Medicine ate nature and and medicine was given by God and people say well I don't need medicine that's good but don't blame somebody I don't need coffee I drink it but I don't need it and many people they need it God bless them hope it perks them up amen don't criticize some people say I gotta have a Coke today no Cokes are no good for you well if he likes it let him drink it amen nothing against it we we get trouble with very minor things but it says here in the word don't let your heart be troubled you know the secret of life is success it is to not be burdened by so many little petty little things amen most of the diseases that we have in the world today come from stress being in the stress stress and stress can kill yeah they the doctors will tell you they don't know what causes high blood pressure but [Music] their clothes and the closest thing they come to is that stress causes high blood pressure is sometimes we're stressed because we're not sure we know where we're going we're not we're not certain and people say I don't want to go to hell nobody wants to go to hell no no we don't want to go to hell but don't let your heart be trouble believe in God you believe also in me and that in my father's house there are many mansions there's many mentions not just one no Solona so we we come to a very puzzling uh uh theme this is foreign and and and and and uh people will read it in the Bible and uh they come up with different little ideas of to how it's going to be in my Bible immediately in my Bible in media and the message that I read from the prophet I don't see how people can go without having the faithful Ministry if you just hear tapes and you should hear tapes but you're not you're not gonna get it because after the prophet because the apostles Apostles and the apostles so so churches that have pastors but don't believe in apostles sets the thing in order foreign because that's God's plan and he gives it he don't let just any preacher put it in order can preach but he cannot put it in order to get it from the apostles because he is the one and sets the thing in order I I heard a preacher in Mexico City one day say yes he said I don't believe brother Bernie is in a puzzle and I said why do you say that he said he doesn't have the qualifications I said sir may I ask you what is the qualifications of an apostle this qualifications I said you go here brother Bernie's tapes and see if he doesn't put the church in order hello I'll get scared with me right away I'm just telling you what the word says God gives it to everybody yeah in in its order of course he gives it to everybody but but you can be sitting in the in the church and you think you know more than the passengers well you might well but you won't rise any higher than him that's what the prophet said don't blame me for what he said I'm just repeating what he says so then we find that when we come to the to a theme like the Millennium like I heard a preacher not long ago said that the New Jerusalem was was going to be here in the millennium I said but if if you're referring to me that we all will live in that City in that City the New Jerusalem in in the Millennium in a millennium you got it all wrong he says Tang he said brother Tommy hermano Tomas I had never seen that I said that's why you must wait for the ark foreign it's like brother Branham with marriage and divorce you they asked him questions but when he went up the mountain and he came down he brought the answer to marriage he would not give it until God gave it to him first and then now we have it amen all right it's a theme that is so confusing with the people in this message they try to figure things out you can't figure that out you stand up it comes by revelations and it comes by representation and it comes by being by for ordination and it's something that is pre-planned of God and it's predestined yes and it's given by the word of knowledge amen yeah when you get it you got it and when you got it your heart is not troubled my heart is in trouble at all how's your heart brother I went to the doctor the other day and he says you're in good shape for 61. I said yes uh good lord is good is good with me and I I come from a line of longevity yeah my father lived to be almost 92. and my mother almost the same that's longevity I I remember when they checked my father his body when he had deceased the mortician said he he is a fine specimen he said all his organs work good correct good kidneys good liver that's good but no matter how good it is still has to die a man so we we come to to our a very puzzling uh scene and I I study this it's your studio is so under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and when when he opens it up for me I don't want to preach it I said they're not going to believe this you guys he it's easier to believe a lie than to give the truth away even with Christians uncle cristianos they they see this thing about God well I I don't have to please nobody I just have to please God well in the first place they've never seen God but they've seen the expression of God that's all we see God expressing himself so then if God expresses himself through a Persona you have to believe that Persona ah watch carefully when when it comes to the throne the throne is not something that is up in heaven no the throne is in the heart of the Believers explain that to me explain for God enthrones himself well then there's other people that say God has never in not yet enthroned himself speak for yourself don't speak for me for me there's no way that a man could take this out by himself it's like brother Branham said the Visions come he says now you know that I don't know you he says but it is not my thought anymore it is God's thoughts and I'm only expressing his how could I tell you what you did 10 years ago when I never have seen you come over then wasn't brother that was God but you say you believe God Has Changed amen amen so then when you get that little piece straight out in your mind then you look to another thing that are kosas and things that are to be understood now a lot of people look to things that are coming or they study and they say oh when this comes Miracles and but they ignore one God is here today all they know is what he did yesterday what he's going to do tomorrow but ignoring what is happening right now amen could say so much on that because stay right there but I don't want to stay there things that are to be understood but things that are not things that happened but things that are happening they're happening but you have to have a spiritual eye to see them people say well when I get to the Millennium Millennial what if I told you I am in my Millennium oh people want to go out of the church tell us another brother Tommy believes the Millennium is here let me ask you a question first what is the Millennium Castle Millennium it's a thousand years of Peace amen it's peace in the valley but it is still time it is not Eternal the Millennium is not eternal Reposado are you resting or are you working well what about the scripture with the the Day comments where no man can work amen but we'll we'll get to that to that just keep that in in you what are we doing here in church because we believe some people say well I I don't believe it but if you ever believed then you would be different I I cannot be without being in church or with God's people believes because I believe and I congregate with Believers and this is my life this is not my life that I used to have this is a new life and this is the token yesterday the the blood is not the tokenya that was the blood age there was the water age there was the water age blood age and now the token age now the the blood of Jesus we know it went back to the elements but we we weren't looking for the blood of Jesus we were looking to the life that was in the cells of that word and that life yes returns back and you you have people of your own household amen that's why he that does not take care of his own and those of his own house whole is worse than an Infidel and the faith he is denied foreign amen because you have you you have right right now you say well but what what's going with me uh anyway when when uh the time comes uh God is going to anoint us here [Music] I'm not going to wait till that time comes to have to be anointed happens right now until I get to it you're waiting for something to happen when it's happening this is the Tabernacle this is a tabernacle no no no no no no no let me say it again is the Tabernacle now when when when people when confused little things here like we see the natural in the natural we see Israel Israel but in the spiritual spiritual we see the bride Muslim it's happened it's happening spiritually while we look at the naturals so why do they fight so much in Israel the Israelites the Palestines the Islamic Palestinians they all want control not so much of the city of Jerusalem they're just getting control no much they want control of the temple we're just getting control the temple there's a Temple there are you in temporary you can go in the Bible and find out about the temple you find that the temple was erected it's called Solomon's Temple Builders and then you find herod's Temple foreign was a figure of the Tabernacle in the wilderness and and the pattern that God gave for that Tabernacles it means a tent or a dwelling place and it had its specifications specifications as to how the temple was laid out that's why David said it is not right for us to to live in in have homes and my Lord he has his Abode in a tent is and that's when David said I'll build him a temple and the Lord and and that was inspiration by God yes when David said it so for Inspirations but God told David you cannot build me a house because you've shed so much blood but out of your loins there shall come for they sons and he shall build the temple now when when you see that we see that the temple was built very much like the tent or the Tabernacle in the wilderness right right but we Pere Nosotros don't have Tempo Temple build by the hands of a man we are cats templates watch carefully as we enter a little bit more into this Millennium and and put the what is separate separate the temple in Jerusalem or for Israel Israel and the Temple of the Holy Ghost now one is natural and the other one is natural but it's it's a spiritual Temple spiritual a man and when you speak about a throne you won't see it because you're you're going you're going to get I see so many preachers in this message and they say Well when some of them that believe on the return it is but it is connected and this pertains to the Jews yes that's why he speaks of the trumpets foreign Israel and we will sit on the throne of David and we'll we'll handle the Affairs of uh of Israel and we'll handle the Affairs if that be the case yes then why didn't God take this prophet and take him to Israel Israel to preach to the 144th house but when they find out which Moses and Elijah will introduce Ivan introducer this son of man is now here's the thing so you can put it together foreign and and in a party says he rested for a thousand years uh he didn't rest a thousand years his rest was interrupted so then he limited a day that he would rest Israel rest Israel this cancer how can they rest the other day they took 50 tanks and moved them to a city and they shot killed a teacher with three students a man they're they're at war is they fight Belen for every inch of ground and that's the way a Christian has to be this is there's not a word in the Bible that will confirm that we are holy rollers but I'd rather be a Holy Roller than a non-holy rollers but I'm not a Holy Roller either I'm never alone where'd he get that word from Diablo people say well I have rolled and I've screamed he said that's fine nothing against that and that's not what makes the Christians there are many people who can't understand why we are so happy and free because we crossed over Jordan to canaan's Fairland that's what's the matter with me man so so we find this is that the the seventh day he Sanctified it showing that there has to be a seventh day for us that has to be a sanctification period sanctification sanctification amen and then and then the Earth receives a baptism of fire receiving bautism amen but the believer the bride La Novia she's getting her seventh day right now when she's raptured she's really not raptured to the seventh day paralysis she's raptured in the in until the 18th yes but she comes back because watch closely because the people that have died they are in the eighth it's done in in it's a holy convocation but they want to come back to the Earth they want to build homes hello why do you need to build a home if you've got a city you say well in the Millennium they won't kill but then they'll be and they'll let you know they won't die the Bible says the infant shall die at a hundred years old read the 65th chapter of the book of Isaiah say well well the bride won't die I never said she's not the only one is going to be in the Millennium there are nations that are going to be there are people but God would have established his throne amen and then and then you find other people and they say well Jesus I'm sorry I'm gonna give you a name good friend of mine it with him [Music] good good friend I stay in his home when Amigo Jamaica in Su Casa and that's brother rightly yes sister his wife baked me a pecan pie like he baked brother Brandon pecan pieces [Music] and and she said now brother Tommy she said I make the best pecan piece and she said because the prophet said I did yeah sister I believe that so she made me a pecan place and I I I I slept in his home a few times he joined me in muchas very very good people to me but he said brother Tommy you bother me when you preach he said Jesus I was preaching for brother carpenters and he said you said Jesus literal body will not sit in the throne in the Millennium I said not not the little body of Jesus Jesus I said I I I can show you the description brother Tommy I can show you where brother Brown said he was Jesus I said who's that living in your heart he said Jesus thank you very much [Music] [Applause] I said you gotta be Jesus Jesus he's resting and that Jesus in me is resting is that's the Jesus this is Jesus inside of me and he says Cali Bartow already picked these things up same messages he says I don't hear very many people preaching on that I said because they don't believe it they they can separate said Jesus lives in you absolutely absolutely well what what lived in brother random this is Jesus Jesus Jesus had an office for brother Brown Jesus I said absolutely the absolutely but Jesus says in office for me I said you see sir in my father father's house there's vocation a man asked me one day what I don't like about you when you Minister brother Peterson sometimes you go into discernment he said you tried to copy brother I said no sir I could never copy brother I don't get into his house in the first place that's his office that's his house but this is my house this is my household that's his house he does in his house what God ordains him to do but in my house foreign [Music] he didn't even know him Paul never met Jesus yet he said he was crucified how could he say that because he came to the visions and Revelations and he says when it please [Music] that became a house he was a house it takes a man to build a house the pattern given to Moses Moses had men foreign [Music] I will receive you save me that's where I am okay okay you will be awesome where is he then the style question he's in the desert Bible says don't believe him he's in the silver chamber he said don't believe them where is he don't understand he's in the heart of the Believers preparing a placebo well the New Jerusalem we're not we're not there yet let's not get ahead of ourselves amen you come to the blood again and a lot of people and people understand the token I'm sorry I have to keep saying this is well I'm going to take the blood of Jesus and put it on the lintel of the doorposts well the blood went back to the elements what was required today was the life come on people yeah was alive that was in that blood well in a church like this what blood do you apply come on people it's got to be the the blood the blood of a dead animals here's where people get scared well the blood was the blood of Jesus Cordero all right I said no it wasn't but then I'm gonna say yes that was a type Jesus and God represented Jesus as an animal come on put it a Little Lamb s right we would he would it would forfeit it right well whose sacrifice was Jesus it wasn't your sacrifice that's why when when that life went out foreign foreign Santo I get so burned out at home and when I go to churches and I hear them well which blood are you gonna apply to this church it has to be a sacrificial lamb um but the blood don't save you oh yes where does it come from the one that was in his body went to the elements where's this one going to come from oh my I shouldn't bring this to the church even foreign get close to somebody follow through I am partial in the church I take sides with certain families I Have Become himself Islam which we know is in the veins it's your life it's your life and he says apply it is what does the door pose do okay go to the scriptures the shepherd IL Pastor he's the door Elizabeth yes or no see oh no if if he's the doors has braces that keeps the building up all the weight of the building is upon the linto and the Lord that's why Jesus said my burn is easy and he says put put the Lord upon me or put your Burns upon me well then when you have a burden don't you pray and put him to Jesus and wonders and Men become Prophet says it's a burden carrier it is for the burden of the people amen now if you'll understand it that was something that died and to become a linto that tree had to die to make the lentils a man so you take something dead and apply it to something dead yes they say well he required the blood of Jesus absolutely absolutely for Redemption amen nobody else could do it Lord Jesus Christ is it still the Lord yes see when the person dies he becomes self-sacrificial so that that blood can be applied me [Applause] amen I believe we can do better than that this evening let us all stand amen God is so good this evening amen let's sing that song bless the Lord O my soul and
