[25:34] norte
[25:35] king of the south
[25:37] i think we got your
[25:39] your
[25:40] vines
[25:55] we've been doing a pretty good job to
[25:56] get to our youth and our children and
[25:59] especially to
[26:01] you adults here that
[26:05] is
[26:09] let's start off with the word of prayer
[26:10] as we approach the author
[26:14] gracious most heavenly father lord
[26:16] father
[26:17] celestial or truly it's a pleasure to be
[26:20] here in your presence
[26:23] nor we don't take lightly what you've
[26:25] put upon our shoulders tonight lord
[26:30] let us speak of your goodness
[26:35] amongst one another
[26:41] take us out of the way lord and just let
[26:43] your holy spirit take over my name
[26:48] and we give you all honor and praise
[27:00] we talked about the king of the
[27:03] of the north quite a bit last last
[27:05] wednesday
[27:09] and so we want to dig and and our focal
[27:11] point to tonight is going to be the king
[27:13] of the south
[27:18] and with the help of the lord i believe
[27:21] we're going to get somewhere tonight
[27:25] and try to understand god's word a
[27:27] little bit better
[27:31] amen we want to try to relax a little
[27:34] bit
[27:36] don't don't go by you know our emotions
[27:38] up here because it's
[27:40] this is a good one
[27:43] you start we start digging into it
[27:47] and and you you really
[27:50] sometimes we take for granted the life
[27:52] of the prophet
[27:56] the life of our pastor
[27:59] you know
[28:00] we
[28:01] things that our prophet brought to us i
[28:03] know he he was a major prophet
[28:08] but he had to dig into it just like we
[28:10] have to okay
[28:14] the revelation that god gave to him
[28:17] he had to dig into the scriptures
[28:21] you know just because something came to
[28:23] him he didn't just run with it
[28:27] he had to dig into history
[28:48] and so we you know just want to thank
[28:49] god can you give one to the lord tonight
[28:51] just for
[28:53] the work that they put into it
[28:58] forgive me brother henry if i
[29:00] if i
[29:02] go too fast
[29:05] so let's turn to psalms 83. i read this
[29:07] last wednesday
[29:09] three
[29:10] years but we're going to get to the
[29:14] meats and potatoes why we read this last
[29:16] wednesday
[29:22] psalms 83
[29:32] and they that hate thee have lifted up
[29:35] the head
[29:40] they have taken crafty council against
[29:44] the people
[29:46] and consulted against thy hidden ones
[29:55] you know now today we're really going to
[29:57] get into to daniel 11 here
[30:01] but it's real tremendous on how here
[30:05] in in the psalms how it prophesied
[30:11] what's going to happen and then daniel
[30:13] prophesies about the same thing
[30:18] you know how that that it's
[30:20] when we get to to the nitty-gritty of it
[30:25] you know it's spirits that control son
[30:28] you know we talk about the king of the
[30:30] north we talk about russia
[30:34] but it was all spirits that we're
[30:35] controlling
[30:38] we could say gorbachev
[30:42] we just go all the way to putin
[30:45] but it's a spirit that was going and it
[30:48] was moving across
[30:51] and when we talk and we bring out who
[30:54] the king of the south was
[30:57] have that mind frame
[31:00] spirits that have gotten a hold espirito
[31:03] santomalo company began to control
[31:07] this was the perfect scripture here
[31:10] that showed how they all come against
[31:13] god's chosen people
[31:17] they have said come and let us cut them
[31:19] off from being a nation
[31:24] which we saw this take place when israel
[31:26] first became a nation
[31:31] that the name of israel may
[31:34] no more be in remembrance
[31:37] of israel they wanted to take that
[31:40] completely out
[31:43] for they have consulted together
[31:47] with one consent
[31:50] they are confederate
[31:52] against the case
[31:55] you could really you could really see
[31:57] that taking place in the world today
[32:01] because the prophet of god said
[32:04] he says when you talk about how
[32:06] catholicism goes and begins
[32:10] this was in his day
[32:12] he says it's already in effect here yes
[32:15] how much more now than it was back then
[32:19] now verse 6
[32:21] the tabernacles of edom
[32:24] and the ishmaelites of moab
[32:26] and the
[32:40] the philistines with the inhabitants of
[32:43] tyra
[32:46] so if we if we just go and just see
[32:48] those
[32:49] identify each one of those names and
[32:51] those two verses we just read
[33:08] is
[33:12] and i'm trying to hand this over to to
[33:14] our
[33:16] brother abram as fast as we can here too
[33:19] [Music]
[33:21] i'm just trying to lay a foundation for
[33:23] him fundamental
[33:26] so remember the six day war
[33:30] how all these arabic countries came
[33:34] and they went against israel
[33:36] israel we read in
[33:38] chapter 83 of psalms
[33:42] all these arabic countries how that they
[33:45] the scripture prophesied on how they
[33:46] would go against israel
[33:50] it's
[33:51] israel because you know you you look
[33:53] white why the king of the north
[33:57] why was he so adamant
[34:00] about going against israel
[34:04] he was rounding up all these countries
[34:06] to do this
[34:09] and i believe through the spirit brother
[34:11] jimmy is is going to kind of break the
[34:13] history down on that part
[34:17] but this really when we're digging into
[34:19] this and we see the history this
[34:21] scripture these next two verses
[34:25] is what brought light to me on on on
[34:28] when we go and what we see look at what
[34:31] it looks to be hey
[34:39] and the king of the south
[34:41] shall be strong
[34:44] okay
[34:46] you you look at all those out all those
[34:48] countries when you put them together
[34:52] they're small countries or countries
[34:54] that you can't compete with countries
[34:56] like russia the united
[35:01] but don't forget st part that brother
[35:02] carlos had brought up
[35:05] carlos
[35:06] about saudi arabia
[35:08] now that they have control of the united
[35:15] little st points start to come out
[35:18] the king of the south shall be strong it
[35:20] says
[35:22] and one of his princes
[35:26] and he shall be strong above him
[35:30] and have dominion
[35:32] his dominion shall be a great dominion
[35:37] so you can see
[35:38] scripture thomas he he he could be a
[35:42] a big player here
[35:45] and in the end of years
[35:49] they shall join themselves
[35:52] and and with that i'm going to ask ask
[35:54] our brother abram you know because you
[35:56] know how that they're uniting the
[35:58] scripture shows us how they join
[35:59] together
[36:04] so brother abram when when we talk about
[36:06] the king how he starts to come down to
[36:08] the south you wanna
[36:25] about the north
[36:26] king of the north and the king of the
[36:28] south
[36:29] northeast
[36:31] but
[36:32] something had to anoint the king of the
[36:35] north to come
[36:37] down to the south i'll go
[36:42] let me have revelation 16 12. an
[36:44] apocalypse
[36:57] and the sixth angel poured out his vial
[37:00] upon the great river euphrates
[37:04] and the water therefore was dried up
[37:06] that the way of the kings of the east
[37:08] might be prepared
[37:22] in another message the prophet said
[37:26] the euphrates river dried up so the king
[37:30] of the north
[37:31] could
[37:32] could pass
[37:41] there were two hundred thousand thousand
[37:44] demons spiritual charges they had their
[37:47] cross over also those
[37:53] and notice
[37:54] that the euphrates
[37:58] is passes through egypt
[38:11] israel so how is that your faith is
[38:13] going to dry up
[38:17] isaiah 11 15.
[38:25] and the lord shall utterly destroy the
[38:28] tongue of the egyptian sea
[38:31] and that egyptian sea is the red sea
[38:36] and with his mighty wind shall he shake
[38:38] his hand over the river which is the
[38:41] euphrates
[38:42] and shall smite
[38:44] it in seven streams and make the men go
[38:47] over dry
[38:49] shots
[38:55] um
[39:05] and anybody you used answer me who was
[39:08] the first one to cross the euphrates
[39:11] river
[39:25] said
[39:26] that abraham everybody was afraid to
[39:29] cross over nobody had crossed past there
[39:31] and he said that abraham crossed it
[39:35] but we leave that alone
[39:40] notice the king of the north which is
[39:42] russia
[39:45] what is the emblem
[39:48] emblem on the flag of russia can you
[39:51] show it up there question
[40:07] so what is
[40:08] the king
[40:21] daniel 7
[40:23] three daniel
[40:26] uno aldress
[40:28] in the first year of bell's chaser king
[40:30] of babylon daniel had a dream
[40:33] and visions of his head upon his bed
[40:36] then he wrote the dream and told the sum
[40:39] of the matters
[40:52] daniel speaking said i saw in my vision
[40:54] by night and behold the four winds
[40:58] which will hit later of the heavens
[41:00] stove above upon the great sea daniel
[41:12] and four great beasts
[41:14] came up from the sea diverse one from
[41:16] another
[41:18] vestis grandest
[41:24] and behold another beast a second light
[41:27] to a bear and he raised up itself on one
[41:30] side
[41:31] and had three ribs on his mouth between
[41:33] his teeth and they set us into it arise
[41:37] and devour
[41:39] much flesh
[41:46] they
[41:55] a
[42:02] revelation 13 2
[42:04] apocalypses
[42:07] and the beast whose eye saw was like
[42:09] unto a leopard
[42:11] and his feet were as the feet of a bear
[42:14] and the mouth of a lion and the dragon
[42:17] gave him the power
[42:19] and he sit in great authority
[42:22] quebec
[42:28] el
[42:33] so we know the scripture is compound
[42:38] but what we're trying to get this night
[42:40] okay
[42:54] and which in
[42:56] of all the vicious animals which is one
[42:59] of the strongest there is
[43:02] animals
[43:06] we know there is a bear
[43:09] so that's russia
[43:12] and he comes eviene
[43:14] and he's going to conquer
[43:17] vienna
[43:18] okay
[43:21] i was going to say something but i'll
[43:23] hold it
[43:26] because some of your brothers wouldn't
[43:28] like if i would see it
[43:36] look at the grizzly and the kodiak
[43:51] revelation 7
[43:53] apocalypse
[43:57] and after these things i saw four angels
[44:00] standing on the four corners of the
[44:02] earth
[44:03] holding the four winds of the earth that
[44:05] the wind should not blow on the earth
[44:08] nor on the sea
[44:09] nor
[44:10] on any tree
[44:14] angles
[44:25] and i saw another angel ascending from
[44:27] the east having the seal of the living
[44:29] god and he cried with a loud voice to
[44:32] the four angels to whom it was given to
[44:34] hurt the earth industry
[44:48] is saying heard not the earth neither
[44:51] the seeing nor the trees kill we have
[44:53] sealed
[44:54] the servants of our god in their
[44:56] foreheads
[45:11] [Music]
[45:16] until the angels let
[45:19] the wind with the dead wind
[45:21] blow and they then could come down
[45:25] los angeles
[45:28] and we know that it's going to happen
[45:30] during the great tribulation
[45:36] daniel 11 40.
[45:41] [Music]

[49:23] there have been many wars in the history
[49:26] of israel
[49:27] visto munchas guerras
[49:41] the four angels let loose one wind los
[49:45] cuatro angeles
[49:47] viento that was world war one
[49:52] it was a horrible war on uh
[49:55] [Music]
[49:56] they
[50:06] the battlefield looked like a desert
[50:09] because everything died
[50:21] november the 11th 1919
[50:35] 11 minutes to 11 o'clock
[50:38] has
[50:53] would have started right there
[50:57] but it wasn't time
[51:02] the king of the north head to come
[51:06] north
[51:21] because in the time of their first war
[51:26] the turks ruled jerusalem
[51:30] jerusalem so as the british forces
[51:33] advanced all the way to
[51:46] so the commander of the british forces
[51:49] wired the king of england
[51:59] and he said what shall i do
[52:03] because he didn't want to fire into a
[52:05] sacred city
[52:10] and the king said pray
[52:14] so
[52:16] general ellenbee
[52:18] general ellenby the commander-in-chief
[52:21] of the british forces
[52:24] britannicas he got in a small plane
[52:29] pequeno and as they were flying over
[52:31] jerusalem
[52:35] the people who were not turks or
[52:37] mohammedans
[52:42] they said l b is coming lmb is coming
[52:48] vienna but the turks and the mohammedans
[52:55] they heard something else
[52:59] the allies are coming the airlines are
[53:02] coming
[53:07] they got scared and right away they
[53:10] hosted the white flag
[53:12] sustain
[53:27] when he entered the city
[53:30] because a conquering generals entered on
[53:34] horseback going into the conquered city
[53:52] paying tribute to this sacred city
[54:00] he was the first christian in many years
[54:04] to control jerusalem
[54:20] each year they went by
[54:27] as they went by i'm sorry
[54:31] the nations build more weapons
[54:37] and got more wicked is
[54:40] entrepreneurs malicia
[54:42] but in 1941
[54:46] the
[54:48] angels let loose another wind
[54:57] and that war ended in 1945.
[55:03] and in may 14 1948
[55:10] israel declared its independence irrele
[55:13] declare independencia and right away the
[55:16] following day el diante
[55:21] syria syria iraq iraq and jordan
[55:26] entered palestine and right away they
[55:30] took control of many areas entrance
[55:35] attack the forces of israel who were not
[55:38] prepared
[55:42] and i take a lot of settlements in
[55:44] israel yeah
[55:47] in israel and one of them they call it
[55:49] the jewish quarter you know they us
[55:56] of the old city
[56:00] and there was east jerusalem
[56:03] jerusalem
[56:05] and when they came in
[56:09] they destroyed
[56:11] almost everything in east jerusalem
[56:13] destroyed casito
[56:18] and all the residents of jerusalem were
[56:21] expelled
[56:27] 58 synagogues were destroyed
[56:35] some of them were hundreds of years old
[56:40] and they were looted and
[56:43] it is what on the sagrados if we're on
[56:46] guitars this was
[56:48] the total
[56:50] some jewish religions religious sites
[56:53] were turned into chicken coops algunos
[57:09] the jewish cemetery on the mount of
[57:12] olives
[57:17] where the jews had been burying their
[57:20] dead for 2
[57:22] 500 years
[57:32] [Music]
[57:34] can you imagine the desecration that
[57:36] they did
[57:38] in my
[58:04] the tombstones were smashed and used as
[58:07] building material
[58:12] material
[58:14] and many more uh prosthetics that they
[58:16] did
[58:35] and next
[58:36] these territories and they are next is
[58:40] jerusalem
[58:48] after 10 months of fighting israel to
[58:51] control also of certain areas
[59:00] proposed by the united nations
[59:12] and of course jordan took control of
[59:14] east jerusalem
[59:17] jerusalem occidental also known as the
[59:20] west bank or east jerusalem was known as
[59:23] judea
[59:28] occidental
[59:30] judea
[59:39] strip
[59:41] then in 1967
[1:00:02] and from egypt the west bank
[1:00:09] occidental
[1:00:10] and
[1:00:11] israel god is jerusalem again israel
[1:00:17] jerusalem oriental took it away from
[1:00:19] jordan
[1:00:21] and the golden heights they took it away
[1:00:24] from syria
[1:00:25] and heights i mean
[1:00:36] because the united nations negotiated a
[1:00:40] ceasefire
[1:00:46] an estimated twenty thousand arabs were
[1:00:49] killed unestimated
[1:01:04] many conflicts continued munches
[1:01:07] conflicts continua
[1:01:13] israel returned the sinai peninsula to
[1:01:16] egypt
[1:01:21] [Music]
[1:01:28] and then they withdrew from the gaza
[1:01:30] strip in 2005.
[1:01:47] how many believe his word is
[1:01:52] this phrase king of the north and king
[1:01:54] of the south
[1:01:58] speaking on the king of the south of
[1:02:00] london
[1:02:01] and we just heard about
[1:02:03] the part that jordan played
[1:02:09] and how is it today as you as you look
[1:02:12] at jordan at israel and egypt
[1:02:18] you see how
[1:02:19] the pope of rome
[1:02:21] papa the roma
[1:02:24] is embracing islam
[1:02:26] islam
[1:02:29] they are trying to unionize everything
[1:02:31] so all these different religions can
[1:02:33] coexist
[1:02:39] in the last couple of years
[1:02:41] the pope met the king of jordan at
[1:02:45] the wailing wall el papa
[1:02:58] time goes by and he meets with the prime
[1:03:00] minister of israel
[1:03:03] minister of israel
[1:03:05] at the same place
[1:03:07] now
[1:03:08] what does that have to do with the king
[1:03:11] of the south
[1:03:13] we know as
[1:03:15] brother ben read
[1:03:16] in psalms 83
[1:03:21] and started to name all those
[1:03:24] countries
[1:03:25] that were
[1:03:26] the arabian countries
[1:03:30] we know then that these people these
[1:03:34] leaders
[1:03:36] leaders
[1:03:37] jordan is islam
[1:03:39] is islam
[1:03:41] israel
[1:03:42] is jewish israelis
[1:03:45] the pope
[1:03:46] claims to represent both catholicism and
[1:03:50] christianity
[1:03:55] just as the scripture says
[1:03:58] of all these arabian countries there is
[1:04:00] no spices out of it now with all the
[1:04:02] religions of the world
[1:04:06] are beginning to unite
[1:04:09] now
[1:04:10] through that i want to go back into
[1:04:12] history just a little bit
[1:04:16] to show you where these powers
[1:04:18] originated
[1:04:22] in the natural natural because the
[1:04:24] spiritual is always going to type the
[1:04:27] nazis
[1:04:30] young people what does that mean
[1:04:33] what you see happen in history
[1:04:37] repeat again and again
[1:04:42] in the spiritual spiritual and as we get
[1:04:45] into this a little bit we will see what
[1:04:48] we're talking about
[1:04:51] now and daniel 11 and daniel
[1:04:55] god begins it's the angel that's
[1:04:57] reciting all of this
[1:05:02] and if you go back to chapter 10
[1:05:06] this angel gabriel is the angel gabriel
[1:05:10] he asked daniel
[1:05:12] do you understand
[1:05:14] what's going to happen
[1:05:17] i have come to make you understand what
[1:05:19] is going to happen even
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:34] for
[1:05:35] for example brother mike what's north
[1:05:37] from here
[1:05:39] in new mexico
[1:05:43] santa fe albuquerque
[1:05:47] so if you just say king of the south
[1:05:49] king of the north
[1:05:51] del oro
[1:05:53] north
[1:05:54] or south from where
[1:05:56] there's depending on where you're at
[1:06:00] but when the angel declares this to
[1:06:02] daniel that it's in reference what will
[1:06:04] happen to his people
[1:06:10] in the last days
[1:06:12] he's talking about israel
[1:06:14] israel amen man so the king of the south
[1:06:18] would be south
[1:06:20] of israel
[1:06:23] israel and the king of the north of
[1:06:25] temple would be north of business
[1:06:29] israel being sandwiched in between
[1:06:32] israelis
[1:06:33] and what i want to go to now is
[1:06:36] when daniel's
[1:06:38] interpreted the vision
[1:06:40] of kim nebuchadnezzar
[1:06:45] he said oh king you are the head of gold
[1:06:51] you are
[1:06:52] the king of the babylonian kingdom
[1:06:58] so then we understand in the history
[1:07:02] that the babylonian kingdom came to its
[1:07:05] end
[1:07:08] and i would like you guys to put up that
[1:07:10] quote
[1:07:12] uh
[1:07:13] that same quote that we read last week
[1:07:15] out of the beginning and the ending of
[1:07:17] the gentile dispensation
[1:07:23] where we talked about how the king of
[1:07:25] the north is going to come down
[1:07:27] and go through
[1:07:29] and lead all the way to armageddon
[1:07:35] but now i'm down about three paragraphs
[1:07:38] in paragraph 103.
[1:07:43] what is it all those prophecies are
[1:07:45] fulfilled
[1:07:48] everything right down to this time today
[1:07:52] notice what the prophet just said
[1:07:54] okay
[1:08:09] the prophecies that happen to have to
[1:08:12] happen
[1:08:13] afterwards
[1:08:16] or the prophecies
[1:08:18] that are happening
[1:08:35] 105 succeeding that he
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:09:02] and the romans broke up
[1:09:04] to
[1:09:19] brings in
[1:09:20] the
[1:09:21] alexandria the great with the christian
[1:09:23] empire
[1:09:25] alexander
[1:09:27] so we see in daniel 11 and then when you
[1:09:29] get to verse 3
[1:09:33] let's go to verse 3 and daniel 11.
[1:09:39] it's going to start talk about the rise
[1:09:41] of a king
[1:09:45] and let's read
[1:09:47] and the it
[1:09:48] king shall stand up that shall rule with
[1:09:50] great dominion
[1:09:52] and do according to his will
[1:09:58] and when he shall stand up his kingdom
[1:10:00] shall be broken
[1:10:05] and shall be divided
[1:10:07] toward the four winds of heaven
[1:10:12] notice from where he's speaking at he is
[1:10:25] his kingdom would be divided
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:31] now we heard from
[1:10:33] the children asking or the youth asking
[1:10:38] who is the king of the east and who is
[1:10:39] the king of the west
[1:10:43] if we can get to this part
[1:10:45] it explains itself
[1:10:49] by itself
[1:10:50] based on what happened
[1:10:53] so
[1:10:54] this kingdom would be divided
[1:10:59] not to his posterity
[1:11:04] the four winds of heaven and not to his
[1:11:06] posterity
[1:11:09] did you notice how in spanish it said
[1:11:11] to his descendants
[1:11:14] english it uses the word posterity
[1:11:20] or lineage
[1:11:22] in other words these that will take over
[1:11:24] his kingdom
[1:11:34] okay
[1:11:36] so
[1:11:37] going into history entrance historia
[1:11:40] we find out that
[1:11:43] alexander the great encounter alexander
[1:11:45] is grande
[1:11:47] that in his first 15 years of his reign
[1:12:10] many years later
[1:12:12] this place now remember he's a young man
[1:12:14] it says
[1:12:15] he started his kingdom when he was 18
[1:12:18] years old
[1:12:33] a little bit into his
[1:12:44] [Music]
[1:12:49] sight
[1:12:50] they got married
[1:12:52] a few months after his death
[1:12:57] roxanne gave birth to alexander iv
[1:13:01] roxanne
[1:13:12] and at that time alexander he had
[1:13:14] studied many different religions
[1:13:21] such a point with the religious
[1:13:23] anointing that was on him
[1:13:27] that he called himself the son of zeus
[1:13:43] now alexander's death was a mystery
[1:13:46] alexander
[1:13:48] mysterio remember he's a young man
[1:13:51] he dies when he's 31 years old
[1:13:55] his wife roxanne
[1:13:57] roxanne is pregnant
[1:14:00] at this point when he dies
[1:14:02] with alexander the fourth alexander
[1:14:05] and he dies
[1:14:07] then alexander iv is born
[1:14:10] alexander
[1:14:12] but his death was a mystery
[1:14:14] for mysterio
[1:14:16] after dr downing a whole bowl of wine in
[1:14:18] a party
[1:14:21] fiesta
[1:14:23] two weeks later he was dead
[1:14:27] at the ripe old age of 33 years old
[1:14:31] and as you see these spirits you may not
[1:14:34] be able to correlate this with what
[1:14:35] we're talking about
[1:14:38] but remember
[1:14:40] the ones that we're
[1:14:54] but when alexander died
[1:14:56] alexander his son was born
[1:15:00] alexander died the suspicion fell on
[1:15:03] general and antipater
[1:15:07] this is
[1:15:12] cassandra later would order the murders
[1:15:15] of alexander's widow and son
[1:15:22] now you can
[1:15:35] would not be
[1:15:36] his
[1:15:43] amen
[1:15:44] did you get that for me up there the
[1:15:46] four generals if you can put it up there
[1:15:48] i don't know if you're able to get
[1:15:50] it
[1:15:52] see these were the four generals
[1:15:55] that
[1:15:56] took each wanted to take or
[1:15:58] take a part of the empire or kingdom of
[1:16:02] alexandria tomorrow
[1:16:05] alexander and i may not be pronouncing
[1:16:06] these words right
[1:16:09] but it's seleucia
[1:16:14] follow me
[1:16:17] and this
[1:16:25] here's why there's no king of the east
[1:16:27] and king of the west
[1:16:30] when these
[1:16:32] these generals started to take over
[1:16:34] certain areas of the kingdom
[1:16:40] of alexander could you put that back up
[1:16:42] there for me
[1:16:45] celukas ended up taking the part of both
[1:16:50] simulators and cassandra
[1:16:57] so the kingdom of
[1:16:59] solicious was much greater
[1:17:02] than the kingdom of ptolemy
[1:17:07] what does this have to do with the king
[1:17:09] of the north and king of the south
[1:17:13] the kingdom was divided among these
[1:17:15] generals
[1:17:19] ended up with both the part
[1:17:21] of cassandra and
[1:17:24] chest
[1:17:27] that's why there is only king of the
[1:17:29] north
[1:17:30] especially
[1:17:31] he had all three of those
[1:17:33] and king of the south del sur now as
[1:17:36] they came down in
[1:17:38] to the middle east what we know is the
[1:17:39] middle east today
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:17:58] now
[1:17:59] what's really interesting is you studied
[1:18:00] the history on this
[1:18:02] story
[1:18:03] history states
[1:18:06] that the kingdom
[1:18:08] of the son or or the king of the south
[1:18:11] queen del rey del sur started with
[1:18:14] ptolemy in peso and ptolemy in egypt and
[1:18:17] hypto
[1:18:18] and all the historians will say
[1:18:20] egypt was the king of the south
[1:18:37] history states that from there began
[1:18:41] the seleucian
[1:18:43] empire
[1:18:44] history
[1:18:47] to the north
[1:18:49] all the historians will say
[1:18:51] the king of the north is
[1:19:06] would then begin to extend to the
[1:19:07] generations
[1:19:10] of all
[1:19:12] the arabian countries
[1:19:15] and i had a map up there but i
[1:19:18] i don't think they were able to get it
[1:19:20] i know josh i had it for last week and
[1:19:22] we just never never got to it
[1:19:26] it shows the ptolemy kingdom to the
[1:19:28] south starting in egypt
[1:19:32] but it didn't stay in egypt
[1:19:46] but it extended all the way across
[1:19:50] into lower russia
[1:19:53] and china
[1:19:56] so when the prophet stands up under the
[1:19:58] anointing
[1:20:01] and and says
[1:20:15] but what the holy spirit is saying to
[1:20:17] the prophets
[1:20:20] now god knows exactly where all these
[1:20:23] kingdoms have come to yes
[1:20:27] and now these spirits
[1:20:29] are being incarnated
[1:20:32] and you've seen the same characteristics
[1:20:37] as being a murderer
[1:20:40] if you didn't agree with his politics
[1:20:41] you were a dead guy
[1:20:58] one
[1:20:58] religious
[1:21:00] one
[1:21:01] ecumenical wanting to gather and unite
[1:21:04] everything even though they don't agree
[1:21:06] on nothing
[1:21:09] and the other one that would kill
[1:21:11] anybody that disagreed with him
[1:21:15] that was the beginning of the king of
[1:21:17] the south this is the principle
[1:21:19] but where is the king of the south today
[1:21:23] what coalition does that have with
[1:21:25] jordan
[1:21:40] do you see the pope going and talking to
[1:21:42] putin
[1:21:45] no you see the princess
[1:21:48] principes of the king of the south the
[1:21:51] lost is the yeah
[1:21:53] and makes an agreement with them
[1:21:57] a little over 15 minutes
[1:21:59] but i want to get to a park here
[1:22:02] that shows something so tremendous
[1:22:06] and it's
[1:22:08] the ben read it
[1:22:12] i'm going to skip verse 5 because he or
[1:22:13] he already went over there
[1:22:16] but i want to go to verse 6.
[1:22:20] and in the end of years
[1:22:22] they shall join themselves together
[1:22:27] did you notice how it said in spanish
[1:22:29] alliance
[1:22:33] in english it says agreement or they'll
[1:22:35] come together
[1:22:37] another word is covenant they would make
[1:22:39] a covenant
[1:22:42] and the king's daughter of the south
[1:22:44] shall come to the kings of the north to
[1:22:47] make an agreement
[1:22:53] this is something that is so tremendous
[1:22:59] the the grandson
[1:23:02] of celusius
[1:23:04] is
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:16] but the reason they had to make an
[1:23:18] agreement or an alliance
[1:23:23] is that his grandson no longer wanted
[1:23:26] her for wife
[1:23:31] and he had to
[1:23:32] make an alliance because he wanted to
[1:23:34] marry
[1:23:35] the king of the south's
[1:23:37] daughter
[1:23:45] and the reason they had to make an
[1:23:46] agreement or an alliance
[1:23:52] is because
[1:23:54] this
[1:23:55] the children are sons of
[1:23:57] late ladies
[1:24:00] the ladies if he put her away
[1:24:06] he marries
[1:24:07] another casa
[1:24:10] it had to be a marriage alliance
[1:24:14] had
[1:24:15] to be a marriage according to the
[1:24:18] government
[1:24:22] and what does this take us to i cannot
[1:24:24] just take us to the spiritual
[1:24:25] application of how church and state are
[1:24:48] but guess what happens
[1:24:50] after a while he gets tired of her
[1:24:55] and he wants to take back his original
[1:24:57] wife
[1:25:00] so here they go again here the king of
[1:25:03] the north and the king of the south
[1:25:05] in history
[1:25:07] where this began
[1:25:09] they begin to go at it in peace
[1:25:12] because of a marriage alliance
[1:25:18] to not go any further than that
[1:25:21] into the spirit
[1:25:25] when brother branham said
[1:25:27] branham yet the early church
[1:25:30] in the system of the church
[1:25:33] put away christ
[1:25:35] and married the papal system
[1:25:52] that's in the spiritual
[1:25:54] spiritual
[1:25:56] and where is that work going to come now
[1:26:00] it's happening right before us
[1:26:03] because the alliances are are covenants
[1:26:05] that are being made right now
[1:26:09] are not only against israel
[1:26:12] israel
[1:26:12] the ones over there in the middle east
[1:26:15] but against us here as the bride of
[1:26:18] christ
[1:26:20] so this is just a little basic history
[1:26:23] on these four generals
[1:26:27] and you can see how as the solution
[1:26:28] empire grew como este imperio
[1:26:32] all the way into russia esta russia
[1:26:35] and all those generations all those
[1:26:37] spirits this is a small way over yes
[1:26:42] we've heard how that russia rejected the
[1:26:44] revival of the holy spirit
[1:27:02] but guess
[1:27:14] of confederation that ben read about in
[1:27:17] chapter 83
[1:27:25] and who is this confederation
[1:27:28] that's coming from the south
[1:27:40] that are gathering everybody together
[1:27:43] and guess what
[1:27:45] of the religious people that are in
[1:27:46] russia right now
[1:27:50] three or four percent are catholic
[1:27:54] very
[1:27:55] small percentage of what we would we
[1:27:57] would call christian when a
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:11] and the king of the south making
[1:28:14] alliances together
[1:28:16] to coexist
[1:28:19] something happens that causes them to
[1:28:21] break that alliance
[1:28:26] exactly the way this
[1:28:28] grandson
[1:28:30] of
[1:28:31] um
[1:28:32] celsius i always forget that name
[1:28:37] and i personally believe this is me now
[1:28:46] of unity of confederating everything
[1:28:48] together including russia
[1:28:51] yes one in the great tribulation
[1:28:56] rome roma
[1:28:58] and israel israel make a covenant
[1:29:02] in the midst of all this alliance
[1:29:06] and that is going to cause repercussions
[1:29:08] in the homemade release all through the
[1:29:10] europe
[1:29:13] will affect russia
[1:29:15] it will affect everything
[1:29:18] and then we'll see what happens
[1:29:21] after that covenants broke
[1:29:34] 30 minutes i better stop right there
[1:29:43] pretty good
[1:29:45] will you be in there
[1:29:47] so i i i hope it painted a good picture
[1:29:50] you know just just how these
[1:29:52] because a lot of times we it's easy to
[1:29:54] lose track on
[1:29:56] on we start talking about history start
[1:29:58] talking about what this general did
[1:30:00] because you know when we started first
[1:30:02] started we kept on running into dead
[1:30:03] ends
[1:30:14] but when we look at the whole picture
[1:30:16] why did why does everything leading to
[1:30:21] [Music]
[1:30:22] and that's what the prophet tells us is
[1:30:24] when this covenant is broke
[1:30:30] because one thing that we didn't cover
[1:30:32] and i know our time is just about up is
[1:30:34] when the scripture in chapter 11 talks
[1:30:37] about how that these there would be a
[1:30:39] lot of flatteries
[1:30:48] and these covenants that are joined
[1:30:51] together
[1:30:54] and the scripture actually tells you
[1:30:55] that
[1:30:56] they sit at the same table
[1:31:01] and they began to talk mischief
[1:31:07] and speak
[1:31:08] lies one to the other
[1:31:12] because that's what it is
[1:31:13] if you read real quick
[1:31:15] verse 27 chapter 11.
[1:31:18] this is talking both of the king of the
[1:31:20] north and the south london
[1:31:24] because
[1:31:25] they all have their own agendas you
[1:31:27] that's one thing we got to look at they
[1:31:29] have their agendas
[1:31:32] they're all looking for the same thing
[1:31:34] when you talk about the king of the
[1:31:36] north and the south island
[1:31:40] both these king's hearts
[1:32:24] you gotta look right let's try to just
[1:32:27] think of it
[1:32:29] realistic
[1:32:33] you know when rome comes in roma entra
[1:32:37] the
[1:32:39] russian people government
[1:32:42] all the arabics los arabis ain't going
[1:32:44] to take their agenda
[1:32:47] because what is their agenda
[1:32:50] religion
[1:32:52] and to take all the money from the
[1:32:53] people
[1:32:55] so both the muslims
[1:32:58] and the communists
[1:33:00] are not going to buy it
[1:33:03] so that's why the scripture says they'll
[1:33:05] begin to sit at the same table
[1:33:09] and they'll begin to speak lies
[1:33:12] why just to get and it the scripture
[1:33:14] says with flatteries
[1:33:18] they began to make this bond one
[1:33:24] you know so at the end of the day we
[1:33:25] look at it what is it
[1:33:28] it's the spirits that are controlling
[1:33:31] each region
[1:33:34] fernando pueblo and it begins to govern
[1:33:37] it
[1:33:39] that's why i like what our our
[1:33:41] our elders said how why why are they
[1:33:43] coming to the that euphrates river
[1:33:48] abram
[1:34:17] you know we got about five minutes
[1:34:23] you know we're here i don't know if you
[1:34:24] all want to throw some questions at us
[1:34:28] regarding the king of the north where we
[1:34:31] we've been studying this for quite some
[1:34:32] time
[1:34:34] i'm sure i got i got both the atomic
[1:34:36] bombs on each side
[1:34:42] any questions out there yeah
[1:34:51] no questions
[1:34:54] yes sister
[1:35:07] you know i know we talked about that
[1:35:08] part with the laptop jim you want to hit
[1:35:11] hit that part of it or tomorrow
[1:35:18] but when this comes to what the prophet
[1:35:20] calls comes to the head
[1:35:25] to give you an example
[1:36:06] it happening and forming right now the
[1:36:08] same with the king of the south
[1:36:13] which started in egypt
[1:36:16] but it went up in
[1:36:19] arabia
[1:36:21] saudi arabia
[1:36:24] all those different arabian countries so
[1:36:27] when this really goes down and the king
[1:36:29] of the north goes in
[1:36:33] to the city of jerusalem
[1:36:36] he goes the bride will be gone
[1:36:41] just remember the great tribulation we
[1:36:43] know is three and a half years so
[1:36:45] there's that's a lot of events that are
[1:36:47] going to be taking place especially when
[1:36:48] you look at daniel 11. so we see that
[1:36:59] on how the king of the north starts to
[1:37:00] come down so there's you know it it's a
[1:37:03] process that he's going to do to come
[1:37:04] down but you gotta take take the years
[1:37:06] that
[1:37:07] that when the bride's gone
[1:37:10] of all these events that will be taking
[1:37:11] place
[1:37:16] uh
[1:37:25] one thing that i had asked i had asked
[1:37:28] the elder if he could
[1:37:30] just bring down a little bit lower to us
[1:37:32] just because the questions
[1:37:39] when because on chapter 11 one of the
[1:37:42] the greatest parts that really impacted
[1:37:45] this was when he starts talking about
[1:37:48] the abomination that make it desolation
[1:37:55] and he had talked about the mosque of
[1:37:57] omar
[1:37:59] you know a lot of people don't really
[1:38:01] see the concept of of what all took
[1:38:04] place there
[1:38:05] nobel concept
[1:38:07] i had asked him because he when me and
[1:38:09] him were talking about he brought it
[1:38:10] down to earth
[1:38:43] he's got a gift
[1:38:45] he's got a gift you know
[1:38:47] and
[1:38:48] what i say i say it in short you know
[1:38:54] i know our time is up but the mosque of
[1:39:03] and the question was
[1:39:07] why
[1:39:08] did the
[1:39:10] muslims and and uh
[1:39:12] they build a
[1:39:14] mosque of omar
[1:39:19] because there was a most sacred place
[1:39:23] and when they built the mosque of omar
[1:39:26] la mesquita del mar they didn't let the
[1:39:29] jews
[1:39:30] come to the
[1:39:31] uh
[1:39:33] enter to that place
[1:39:51] it started right there because that was
[1:39:54] they said the center is the most sacred
[1:39:57] place
[1:39:59] and that god started there
[1:40:03] but the mosque
[1:40:05] is history
[1:40:07] we have a prophet who brought him out of
[1:40:09] history
[1:40:11] so the question is
[1:40:13] what is
[1:40:15] the obama nation of desolation
[1:40:19] because he said he will continue unto
[1:40:22] the consummation
[1:40:25] and it will be the over spreading of
[1:40:28] desolation
[1:40:32] what is the opposition spreading of
[1:40:34] desolation
[1:41:02] because we see it as a battle but when
[1:41:04] you go there to the to the mosque of
[1:41:06] omar
[1:41:10] here you have israel and and the jordan
[1:41:13] fighting over rights who who's going to
[1:41:15] protect it who's going to get to worship
[1:41:28] it's a battle just like it is with us
[1:41:29] with that confederation
[1:41:44] god's word
[1:41:47] and i believe that um
[1:41:49] there's many more that are coming now
[1:41:52] you guys have got the good news
[1:41:58] but we're continuing on
[1:42:02] [Applause]
