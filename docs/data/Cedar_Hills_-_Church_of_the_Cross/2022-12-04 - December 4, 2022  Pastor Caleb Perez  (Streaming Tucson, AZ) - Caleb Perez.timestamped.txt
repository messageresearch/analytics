[1:17:43] he fills it with with what
[1:17:51] he fills it with what
[1:17:53] he fills it with himself
[1:17:59] the same thing today
[1:18:01] God will fill every Temple
[1:18:05] that will thoroughly dedicate itself to
[1:18:08] him
[1:18:11] the temple is not this little building
[1:18:15] it's not the one in Salt Lake City
[1:18:19] not the one in Rome
[1:18:21] the temple is you
[1:18:25] tell your neighbor the temple is you
[1:18:29] are the temple that God wants to dwell
[1:18:32] in
[1:18:35] and express himself through yes
[1:18:39] that all nations might know him
[1:18:45] you can open your Bibles to the
[1:18:47] Ephesians the fourth chapter and we'll
[1:18:49] get into the word
[1:19:01] Ephesians 4 and we're going to go from 7
[1:19:03] to 13.
[1:19:09] when you have you can
[1:19:13] you can say Amen if you got it
[1:19:15] amen but unto every one of us is given
[1:19:19] Grace according to the measure of the
[1:19:23] gift of Christ
[1:19:30] before he said when he ascended up on
[1:19:33] high he led captivity captive and gave
[1:19:36] gifts unto men
[1:19:44] now that he ascended what is it but that
[1:19:48] he also descended first into the lower
[1:19:51] parts of the Earth
[1:19:59] now watch once again the infilling of
[1:20:02] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:20:04] and he that descended is the same also
[1:20:09] that ascended up far above all Heavens
[1:20:14] that he might fill all things
[1:20:27] in Spanish it says complete which is
[1:20:29] right but but in English it's to fill
[1:20:33] all things
[1:20:37] let's see how he was going to feel all
[1:20:39] things
[1:20:41] and he gave some Apostles
[1:20:48] and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:20:52] and some pastors and teachers
[1:20:59] for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:21:03] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:21:07] edifying of the body of Christ
[1:21:10] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:21:13] faith
[1:21:15] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:21:19] unto a perfect man
[1:21:23] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:21:26] fullness of Christ
[1:21:30] as we bow our heads father almighty God
[1:21:34] we are here Lord at your command
[1:21:38] in obedience to your word Lord
[1:21:41] with all humility
[1:21:43] with all humbleness and sincerity Lord
[1:21:48] we approach this subject today
[1:21:52] we have read the text
[1:21:55] now we ask that you give us the context
[1:21:59] and Grant this morning Lord
[1:22:03] that the angel of the Lord
[1:22:05] we'll encamp about this place
[1:22:08] will come to every heart
[1:22:11] and make ready the infilling of the Holy
[1:22:14] Spirit
[1:22:16] and divine faith that all the sick Lord
[1:22:21] and Afflicted might be healed
[1:22:24] may all the Sinners be saved
[1:22:27] May the Saints be blessed and may all
[1:22:32] the backsliders return home
[1:22:34] for your honor and Glory we ask all
[1:22:37] these things as we place this service in
[1:22:40] ourselves in your hands in the precious
[1:22:43] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:22:46] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[1:22:49] seated what a subject we have this
[1:22:52] morning
[1:22:53] on the infilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:57] the word very word infilling
[1:23:00] it means to fill in
[1:23:03] it is the material bill that is used to
[1:23:07] feel something
[1:23:10] it's the material that is used to fill a
[1:23:13] space or a hole
[1:23:17] now there's a lot of different kinds of
[1:23:19] materials out there
[1:23:22] that we can fill ourselves up with idea
[1:23:27] that's my mom's sister
[1:23:30] there's a lot of things out there
[1:23:33] that we can feel ourselves as I said
[1:23:37] but when we look at this we're not
[1:23:40] interested this morning in all the
[1:23:42] materials that you can fill yourself
[1:23:43] with
[1:23:46] we're interested in only one kind of
[1:23:49] materials
[1:23:52] brother Brown says so when a man lives
[1:23:55] by faith
[1:23:58] it is the fifth day right
[1:24:02] and we know this already
[1:24:03] f-a-i-t-h is
[1:24:08] j-e-s-u-s
[1:24:11] g-r-a-c-e Jesus
[1:24:13] amen or amen amen amen so when a man
[1:24:17] lives by faith and walks by faith
[1:24:21] I mean a substance Faith all right
[1:24:26] now we're gonna start to feel
[1:24:29] it's a substance Faith
[1:24:33] he is isolated from the entire world
[1:24:38] and becomes a new creature in Christ
[1:24:44] there he says
[1:24:46] now you're getting into bride materials
[1:24:52] okay dial your neighbors
[1:24:54] now we're getting into Pride materials
[1:24:59] see you're getting into rapturing
[1:25:03] condition right now
[1:25:08] you're getting into rapturing condition
[1:25:11] right now
[1:25:14] now now how many know that the Lord will
[1:25:17] not share his glory with no one is
[1:25:21] but therefore there cannot be an
[1:25:24] infilling
[1:25:27] until first there has to be an empty now
[1:25:33] it's the biggest mistake that people
[1:25:36] make today
[1:25:37] they're always Lord feelings
[1:25:41] and we go on and on and on through the
[1:25:43] years
[1:25:44] but we never want to empty out
[1:25:48] and we say Lord come into my heart
[1:25:52] I'm going to tell you again he will
[1:25:55] share his throne with no one
[1:25:59] this is where I believe that the problem
[1:26:01] lies
[1:26:04] this is where I believe the problem Lies
[1:26:08] We like to empty out a few things
[1:26:13] and then we try to
[1:26:15] fit God in
[1:26:18] see if he fits somewhere
[1:26:22] all right yes or yes TLC
[1:26:28] others empty out but then they make the
[1:26:33] mistake of not filling themselves all
[1:26:35] the way up
[1:26:39] being empty can be a good thing
[1:26:43] or not so good things
[1:26:45] depends what you do after that
[1:26:49] but I'm going to take for instance a a
[1:26:51] chair
[1:26:53] for example an empty an empty chair
[1:26:57] there's a couple of empty chairs and I
[1:27:01] want to use this as a maybe as an
[1:27:02] example to
[1:27:05] the preacher
[1:27:07] the empty chair says
[1:27:10] your sermon has no value
[1:27:19] hello everybody
[1:27:25] to the visitors
[1:27:27] the empty chair says uh I think they're
[1:27:30] losing ground here
[1:27:35] to the one looking for a church to
[1:27:39] attendance
[1:27:41] an empty chairs tells them
[1:27:45] I better be I better wait a little bit
[1:27:50] you see what's really going on here
[1:27:54] to The Treasure of the church
[1:27:58] an empty chair says we're gonna be in a
[1:28:02] deficit talk about it
[1:28:05] yes come on Empty Chairs
[1:28:10] to the members of the church
[1:28:12] they see an empty chair
[1:28:15] and it tells them you can be absent next
[1:28:18] Sunday dude
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:24] empty chair says
[1:28:27] I'm not interested in your hours of
[1:28:30] practice and discipline
[1:28:33] the empty chair
[1:28:36] testifies against the church services
[1:28:41] it kills inspiration
[1:28:44] and it chokes out hope
[1:28:49] I stop here for a moment
[1:28:52] one time my grandmother was in church
[1:28:56] and there was a lot of empty chairs
[1:28:59] and my grandfather was preaching
[1:29:02] and he said oh if you could just see
[1:29:05] right now
[1:29:07] there are angels sitting in every Empty
[1:29:11] Chairs my grandmother said ah I don't
[1:29:15] see nothing
[1:29:19] she said when all of a sudden
[1:29:21] her eyes were open
[1:29:24] and she saw angels sitting everywhere
[1:29:29] she was looking beyond what these eyes
[1:29:31] could see
[1:29:35] when we see this we understand
[1:29:39] that when man fell
[1:29:41] he didn't show up that day
[1:29:45] in the call of the evening
[1:29:49] to sit down and talk with the father
[1:29:53] that was the first time there was an
[1:29:56] empty chair on Earth
[1:29:59] and then as time went on
[1:30:03] Cain kills Abel
[1:30:06] and for the first time
[1:30:09] outside of the garden
[1:30:11] there was an empty chair at the dinner
[1:30:14] table
[1:30:16] for the first time
[1:30:19] Adam and Eve looked across the table one
[1:30:28] he had been killed
[1:30:34] our chair our Throne is our position
[1:30:39] it is our place it is our inheritance
[1:30:44] the empty chair groans
[1:30:48] listen to me closely this morning the
[1:30:51] empty chair groans
[1:30:55] waiting for the rightful owner is
[1:31:00] to take it and sit on it
[1:31:03] come on now I'm not just talking about a
[1:31:06] literal chair anymore
[1:31:08] I'm talking about The Throne of your
[1:31:10] heart
[1:31:12] oh creation is grown in the Bible says
[1:31:17] what a manifestation of the sons of God
[1:31:21] because only a son or daughter of God
[1:31:26] will invite and make ready
[1:31:37] on that seat or on that throne
[1:31:42] that's the purpose that the throne was
[1:31:44] created foreign
[1:32:13] to him that over
[1:32:24] even as
[1:32:26] overcame
[1:32:28] and I'm sat down with my father in
[1:32:30] history
[1:32:32] this is not just written here to work us
[1:32:35] up
[1:32:39] it's for us to take a rightful place
[1:32:44] for Christ to take his right
[1:32:48] correct now this is something tremendous
[1:32:51] because it's so true
[1:32:54] whatever your background might be
[1:32:57] especially if you come from the
[1:32:59] apostolic or Pentecostal realm is
[1:33:05] the people have been trained
[1:33:08] we were brother her brother Jerome
[1:33:10] talking about that yesterday
[1:33:12] the people have been trained
[1:33:16] that if you don't jump or shout in a
[1:33:18] church
[1:33:21] the Lord wasn't there
[1:33:26] right and it's exactly what was going on
[1:33:28] right yes
[1:33:29] everybody waiting for the climax
[1:33:33] why do you have to wait for it
[1:33:37] the climax should be the moment you
[1:33:39] walked into the church
[1:33:43] when your heart is prepared
[1:33:47] the climax already
[1:33:49] now now this is tremendous because it's
[1:33:52] just tremendo it makes us check
[1:33:54] ourselves
[1:33:56] I learned that as a young preacher
[1:34:02] I had just started to
[1:34:04] preacher and I preached in
[1:34:08] and it was very solemn if
[1:34:11] and then the next morning
[1:34:14] it was a fiery preacher
[1:34:18] and man the people were just wow
[1:34:21] it was it was so tremendous
[1:34:27] but it was tremendous
[1:34:30] and I remember my father saying there
[1:34:34] was a lot of movement today
[1:34:39] in the soul he says
[1:34:42] there was more and so thick the presence
[1:34:45] of the Lord yesterday
[1:34:48] that most people didn't even know what
[1:34:51] was going on
[1:34:54] that's when I learned not to judge a
[1:34:57] service
[1:34:59] by how much movement there is by how
[1:35:03] much dancing
[1:35:06] here's
[1:35:35] [Applause]
[1:35:42] we've been trained to think the opposite
[1:35:45] way
[1:35:48] an invasion of the USA
[1:35:51] he says they just got the people to just
[1:35:54] a bunch of worked up
[1:36:01] come on
[1:36:04] right
[1:36:06] and we gotta just keep on going keep on
[1:36:07] going until something happens
[1:36:12] we work the people up
[1:36:16] then as soon as the workup is over
[1:36:20] the first thing you know
[1:36:23] you can't find one of them
[1:36:29] what happened it was a great service
[1:36:33] brother Brown says you can have the
[1:36:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:38] 24 hours a day
[1:36:41] let's still go to hell yeah
[1:36:45] because he promised to pour His Spirit
[1:36:47] upon All Flesh
[1:36:51] not all flesh is saved
[1:36:55] but if that Holy Spirit
[1:36:59] goes beyond this flesh
[1:37:03] passing the spiritual and goes down into
[1:37:07] the soul
[1:37:08] then you can now no more die than God
[1:37:14] thank you
[1:37:16] he says you can't find one of them
[1:37:19] and the church is sitting empty like
[1:37:24] like
[1:37:26] and then he makes this statement
[1:37:31] if a man loves Gods
[1:37:35] men women children
[1:37:39] if a man loves God
[1:37:45] his seat in the church
[1:37:52] he can't stay away from it
[1:38:00] how many of you have a responsibility
[1:38:03] we have a responsibility
[1:38:06] the message puts a responsibility on us
[1:38:10] but it's not how much responsibility we
[1:38:14] feel
[1:38:16] that yeah but it's how much
[1:38:19] responsibility
[1:38:22] that we're willing to take on is
[1:38:27] they mad there's the difference now
[1:38:30] how much responsibility
[1:38:32] just enough to be called a Christian
[1:38:36] Cristiano oh
[1:38:40] wow it's time it's Tiempo we stop trying
[1:38:43] to work people up in the church
[1:38:48] we don't want to be a bunch of
[1:38:51] sensationalists
[1:38:55] amen amen
[1:38:59] amen
[1:39:00] right did I get off on the right exit
[1:39:06] we are not sensationalists
[1:39:09] we are imparters of eternal life
[1:39:15] we have a responsibility
[1:39:21] you still want the infilling of the Holy
[1:39:22] Ghost
[1:39:25] it doesn't come because we jump and
[1:39:27] Shout
[1:39:28] it doesn't come with because we're
[1:39:29] jumping showers
[1:39:32] but we'll do that later too
[1:39:36] don't go away with it because then
[1:39:38] you're going to be late
[1:39:41] in our church we can't even say Amen
[1:39:44] no no now you're going to the opposite
[1:39:49] come bring it to the middle now
[1:39:56] you love the Lord
[1:39:57] all right
[1:40:01] it's about you coming to your place
[1:40:07] and the person
[1:40:11] how many know the Holy Ghost is the
[1:40:13] person
[1:40:14] and the person of the Holy Ghost coming
[1:40:17] and sitting on the throne of your heart
[1:40:22] no more Empty Chairs
[1:40:25] we've leaned too much on Sensations
[1:40:30] but this was one of the great Mysteries
[1:40:32] of the seventh Angels
[1:40:35] The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:38] Ghost
[1:40:41] without a sensation
[1:40:45] this is a mystery
[1:40:47] how could the Holy Ghost baptize me
[1:40:51] without a sensation it's a mystery
[1:40:56] because when you're looking for this
[1:40:59] you're looking for emotions
[1:41:01] you're not looking at the right thing
[1:41:06] I was telling a young man the other day
[1:41:09] I said your giant comes to the valley
[1:41:13] for one reason
[1:41:19] he comes to die
[1:41:23] [Applause]
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:24] [Applause]
[1:41:26] I'll say it again this giant comes to
[1:41:30] the valley for one purpose
[1:41:36] but then I asked him the question
[1:41:40] what is the valley what is it buddy
[1:41:42] what's the valley he comes to die in
[1:41:44] what is
[1:41:48] going to answer the question
[1:41:53] and I said I'll tell you what that
[1:41:55] Valley is
[1:41:57] giant dies in The Valley of decision
[1:42:04] come on now
[1:42:06] come on now we got to go a little
[1:42:07] farther now
[1:42:09] in the valley of decisions
[1:42:12] that's why brother Brown preaches the
[1:42:14] message
[1:42:15] the power of decisions
[1:42:20] that's right you have to decide that you
[1:42:22] want to serve the Lord
[1:42:26] you can't just stand here
[1:42:29] and just come to church
[1:42:31] thinking that's all there is
[1:42:34] no English you've got to make a decision
[1:42:40] you will serve the Lord
[1:42:43] everything else will die out
[1:43:02] it's the power of decisions
[1:43:05] and that's all the power you need to
[1:43:07] overcome the giant yes
[1:43:11] let's go on here
[1:43:13] yeah
[1:43:15] how many want to be filled
[1:43:17] are you sure okay tell your neighbor
[1:43:22] come on
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:28] prophet of God says this
[1:43:30] he says
[1:43:33] and we can all say it
[1:43:36] all that God was Era
[1:43:42] yes or yes yes can you say it with me
[1:43:46] oh God
[1:43:50] what did he do Israel he poured it into
[1:43:54] Christ
[1:43:59] but there's a problem with that
[1:44:01] because then that would have left God
[1:44:05] empty
[1:44:09] goes on and says
[1:44:11] and says Christ was
[1:44:15] he loaded into the church
[1:44:17] the problem is
[1:44:20] that would have left Christ empty
[1:44:23] but brother says that's not the way he
[1:44:27] does it
[1:44:29] oh that God was
[1:44:36] he became Christ Church
[1:44:53] oh yeah
[1:44:57] she's not a separate entity from here
[1:45:02] he is him
[1:45:04] she's born
[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:23] don't try to make us a separate entity
[1:45:32] we are the message of William Brown
[1:45:37] oh man
[1:45:40] how many want the in Philly
[1:45:43] the kenosis
[1:45:46] she became that is
[1:45:51] let me see how much time I got here
[1:45:55] all right
[1:45:58] what does the little bride then become
[1:46:04] Christ into the church
[1:46:06] what does that little bride become
[1:46:10] Messiah is the anointed one
[1:46:13] and if he was the Messiah by being the
[1:46:17] anointed one
[1:46:19] the Redeemer
[1:46:21] then when God raised up that body
[1:46:26] his bride is the anointed one for this
[1:46:30] day
[1:46:33] that's the Easter seal hello everybody
[1:46:36] the bride is the anointed one for this
[1:46:39] day
[1:46:41] and it's already raised with him in the
[1:46:44] resurrection
[1:46:47] because there are two of the two have
[1:46:50] now become one
[1:46:54] she tell your neighbors the anointed one
[1:46:57] for this day
[1:47:00] now tell your neighbor we are the
[1:47:03] anointed ones
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:08] almost
[1:47:58] [Music]
[1:48:07] all right okay now watch now our sermon
[1:48:10] it's what he did now and the first thing
[1:48:14] then when Christ the anointed one in
[1:48:16] this age
[1:48:18] when he poured it all into the church
[1:48:21] the first thing that he poured into the
[1:48:24] church
[1:48:27] a good feeling
[1:48:31] a sensation
[1:48:34] he poured into the church first apostles
[1:48:38] that's right
[1:48:41] nobody in the message hardly wants to
[1:48:43] talk about Apostles no more
[1:48:46] well then they don't want everything
[1:48:49] that he poured into the church
[1:48:54] well what we don't need apostles
[1:48:59] the Apostle is the setter in order of
[1:49:01] the church
[1:49:03] how can you even have a church without
[1:49:06] an apostle setting it in order
[1:49:13] come out
[1:49:14] that's like saying I just want a little
[1:49:17] bit of it Lord
[1:49:19] I don't agree with that well the Bible
[1:49:22] says where he put it in the church
[1:49:25] where did he take it out
[1:49:31] the Apostle is the sent one
[1:49:34] and from the prophet that's the first
[1:49:37] thing that came forth that he said in
[1:49:39] the church is
[1:49:40] the first apostles
[1:49:43] then prophets
[1:49:46] teachers evangelist pastors
[1:49:49] notice this now and I want you to get
[1:49:51] this this is important
[1:49:54] when we find Philip
[1:49:57] Philip then is taken to who
[1:50:02] to the eunuch yeah
[1:50:04] yes that's right right
[1:50:08] hello everybody
[1:50:10] the eunuch was reading
[1:50:14] a prophet
[1:50:15] um
[1:50:18] named Isaiah he said yes and he's
[1:50:21] reading them
[1:50:23] he was taken to as a sheep to the
[1:50:25] slaughtered
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:28] he was wounded for our transgression
[1:50:30] bruise foreign
[1:50:37] could he understand the Prophet
[1:50:40] this is the problem we have today
[1:50:43] we don't need preachers anymore
[1:50:47] we have the message
[1:50:49] but the eunuch was reading the message
[1:50:54] [Applause]
[1:51:01] now I want you to know how he reads in
[1:51:03] English
[1:51:05] he says he said how can I
[1:51:10] accept
[1:51:12] some man
[1:51:15] say it again
[1:51:17] except some Mansion guide me
[1:51:25] no guide me guys
[1:51:29] that's right amen I'm gonna say it again
[1:51:32] how can I understand what the prophet
[1:51:34] said
[1:51:36] let some man guide me
[1:51:41] who is the some man
[1:51:45] I'll tell you who the some man is
[1:51:50] placed in the church

[1:52:26] okay
[1:52:29] [Applause]

[1:52:52] [Applause]
[1:52:54] wow not even the batteries could put up
[1:52:58] like where's the Energizer
[1:53:03] we have the real Energizer
[1:53:06] will the bride have a Ministry
[1:53:10] yes see it's going on right now
[1:53:17] oh
[1:53:18] sure it's made up of Apostles
[1:53:27] but it would be a very humble Ministry
[1:53:59] it gets heavy
[1:54:02] all right but I know something else is
[1:54:03] going on in here
[1:54:07] you must accept the person of the Holy
[1:54:09] Ghost
[1:54:12] hello everybody you must accept the
[1:54:15] person of the Holy Ghost which is Jesus
[1:54:19] Christ in spirit form
[1:54:21] working through his body here on Earth
[1:54:25] now now watch this now I don't
[1:54:28] understand why how they say Don't Preach
[1:54:30] no more
[1:54:32] well if they're not called to preach
[1:54:34] that then Don't Preach
[1:54:36] that's okay if they're called to hand
[1:54:38] out a track
[1:54:41] I'm not against anyone that doesn't do
[1:54:43] that
[1:54:47] but when they try to get into our lane
[1:54:54] sorry I already took my place
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:04] maybe it's a good thing maybe it's
[1:55:07] weeding out a lot of those that really
[1:55:09] weren't called to to
[1:55:11] preachers
[1:55:13] watch what brother Branham says in the
[1:55:15] message putting on the whole armor of
[1:55:17] God
[1:55:20] God fortified his army
[1:55:44] did you ever think what the office those
[1:55:46] offices in the church is
[1:55:52] God's dress is
[1:55:56] oh yeah
[1:55:58] amen
[1:56:00] this is this isn't exciting huh
[1:56:04] oh no I'm not feeling it no more oh yeah
[1:56:09] come on pinch yourself
[1:56:11] it's God's dress
[1:56:16] an apostle an apostle a prophet
[1:56:21] um
[1:56:22] foresee before Satan ever gets to it
[1:56:27] it's God dressed up in his church
[1:56:32] these offices is God's dress wear is
[1:56:38] that's God's dress where he says
[1:56:41] it's God's presence
[1:56:44] it's God's spirit
[1:56:47] working through man
[1:56:51] yeah come on now how many still want to
[1:56:54] get filled
[1:56:55] I know the Pastor said this but I don't
[1:56:58] think it's like that oh yeah
[1:57:06] the other day it was really funny a man
[1:57:10] who was watching this this man come to
[1:57:13] the to a doctor and he says is it okay
[1:57:15] if we take this my baby takes this
[1:57:19] and the doctor says yeah that would be
[1:57:21] okay but but you don't understand that
[1:57:23] you know I we did this and we did this
[1:57:25] but but should we still yes it's okay
[1:57:30] why did you even go to the doctor for
[1:57:32] her
[1:57:33] you had your own idea of what it is why
[1:57:37] did you even go to the pastor you have
[1:57:39] your idea of what you want to do anyway
[1:57:43] power of decision
[1:57:51] your idea to one side and you're willing
[1:57:55] to hear from God
[1:57:57] the power of decisions
[1:58:02] Jesus said he that receiveth you Jesus
[1:58:06] foreign
[1:58:22] [Applause]
[1:58:34] oh that was I read that I was like
[1:58:36] let me read that again I think the
[1:58:39] church has been preached to death
[1:58:43] he's not saying Don't Preach no more
[1:58:46] but what he's saying is that we we've
[1:58:49] gone just preaching preaching preaching
[1:58:50] and that's all good there's a place for
[1:58:52] that is
[1:59:00] to come back to the teachings
[1:59:06] amen the church has been preached to
[1:59:09] death
[1:59:10] and all they know is Sensations
[1:59:15] that's okay if you have no emotion you
[1:59:19] should be buried
[1:59:21] right we're not we're not robots
[1:59:25] oh but wait now he says the thing it
[1:59:29] needs is to come back to teaching
[1:59:33] and get in on the foundation
[1:59:37] fundamental so you know how to build
[1:59:39] yourself up in Christ
[1:59:47] Lord that's what the Apostle does in the
[1:59:50] church
[1:59:51] he places the foundation fundamental the
[1:59:56] scripture tells us that the foundation
[1:59:59] of Apostles and Prophets
[2:00:01] Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone
[2:00:06] they've rejected what Christ has put in
[2:00:09] the church
[2:00:11] we had a good time
[2:00:13] Holy Ghost but I don't care what the
[2:00:15] brother says
[2:00:17] I don't care what the but what the
[2:00:19] pastor says
[2:00:22] you're way off somewhere
[2:00:25] that's right right hello everybody
[2:00:29] come on now Thomas what'd you think you
[2:00:32] were going to get at the climax
[2:00:35] what did you think you were going to get
[2:00:36] on the fifth day okay
[2:00:38] what are you what were you expecting
[2:00:41] there is an expected end
[2:00:44] I better hurry up Ryan going to get to
[2:00:46] that
[2:00:48] they've been preached to death they got
[2:00:51] to get back on the foundation
[2:00:53] now show me where they even mentioned
[2:00:56] many times even mentioned in church
[2:01:00] that's all wonderful but don't take part
[2:01:04] of the word take all of it
[2:01:07] and watch what he says and we've built
[2:01:09] our churches
[2:01:14] our churches upon Sensations
[2:01:18] and upon different things
[2:01:20] but it can't be built upon nothing else
[2:01:27] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:01:32] might fill all things
[2:01:38] oh we're full of religion Church
[2:01:42] come on church we are full of religions
[2:01:46] I've been going to church for 40 years
[2:01:49] I've been going to church for 50 years
[2:01:52] what does that mean
[2:01:54] I don't understand what that means
[2:01:57] it's one of the worst spirits to get
[2:02:00] into the church
[2:02:04] come on you know you know what one of
[2:02:06] the one of the worst spirits in the
[2:02:08] churches
[2:02:10] the spirit of entitlement
[2:02:14] I've been in church and I I'm entitled
[2:02:16] to this
[2:02:19] the instruments
[2:02:32] all obedience to the Token
[2:02:36] is the only thing that will entitle you
[2:02:42] other than that there is
[2:02:47] you know I was I had gone to Israel a
[2:02:50] few months back
[2:02:55] I picked up a book
[2:03:01] was entitled listening to the language
[2:03:04] of the Bible
[2:03:09] it was a better understanding of how the
[2:03:11] Hebrews think
[2:03:15] I want you to do this because yeah okay
[2:03:18] I want you to see how shallow we are
[2:03:22] you know I I I'll say this
[2:03:25] in MIT MIT
[2:03:29] they did a study
[2:03:32] and they started to see if people could
[2:03:34] multitask yes
[2:03:39] I can do a lot of things at one time oh
[2:03:41] your person like wow that's amazing oh
[2:03:45] yeah I can do this
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:51] and we feel good because we feel like
[2:03:53] we're doing something
[2:03:55] well the study came out and the results
[2:03:58] was this it is impossible for a human to
[2:04:03] multitask
[2:04:08] he said because the moment you
[2:04:11] try to do more than one thing
[2:04:16] the mind gets out of depth mode
[2:04:22] [Music]
[2:04:25] it gets out of Death Mode and goes into
[2:04:28] shallow mode
[2:04:30] so now we're doing a lot of things
[2:04:34] come on this is exactly what goes on in
[2:04:38] the homes
[2:04:39] this is why we fail in the holders there
[2:04:43] is no depth
[2:04:45] you're talking about church and we
[2:04:48] expect the pastor to do wonders yes
[2:04:53] but when they go back home
[2:04:56] to the same circumstances
[2:04:59] the same atmosphere
[2:05:01] what happens they lose all the traction
[2:05:05] they got at church
[2:05:07] [Applause]
[2:05:10] where's the depths
[2:05:14] David began to write
[2:05:20] calleth
[2:05:22] that's why we don't hear from God
[2:05:25] yes and the shallow calls into the
[2:05:28] shells
[2:05:30] come on
[2:05:35] this this is so tremendous to me in the
[2:05:39] Hebrew the word yada
[2:05:49] so then rather than just knowing
[2:05:51] information
[2:05:55] the Hebrew idea of Yara
[2:06:00] it stresses knowing from experience
[2:06:07] watch this now watch this now this is
[2:06:10] this is just so what the brother brought
[2:06:12] yesterday
[2:06:13] he just goes so good together
[2:06:16] now now watch this now we are a western
[2:06:20] people
[2:06:22] trying to understand an Eastern books
[2:06:28] let me put it in another way we are our
[2:06:32] religious people
[2:06:34] trying to understand the supernatural
[2:06:37] message
[2:06:40] come on Church
[2:06:45] notice observing when we do that it
[2:06:49] doesn't work
[2:06:51] we stress the intellectual part of
[2:06:54] hearings
[2:06:55] but we minimize the doing that
[2:07:00] the Bible says be not only hears of the
[2:07:03] word but doers
[2:07:06] so when we as westerners
[2:07:11] I hope you get this when we as
[2:07:14] westerners
[2:07:16] we use the word to know
[2:07:20] we think of our mental grasp of facts
[2:07:27] we think that the more facts we know
[2:07:30] about a subject
[2:07:33] the more we know about it
[2:07:36] do you know
[2:07:38] yeah let me explain to you in the
[2:07:41] beginning
[2:07:47] all of the old cheese I know all those
[2:07:49] things
[2:07:50] Hebrews don't look at it like that
[2:07:54] oh come on I'm getting something here
[2:07:56] with you now so then rather than just
[2:07:59] knowing information
[2:08:04] it stresses experience
[2:08:08] it stresses
[2:08:10] relationships
[2:08:12] and it stresses on acting on the
[2:08:15] knowledge you have received
[2:08:19] this is where the the biblical idea or
[2:08:22] concept comes from
[2:08:25] the knowledge of God
[2:08:29] what knowledge of God do you think you
[2:08:32] have
[2:08:33] or do I think I have come on it's for me
[2:08:38] too
[2:08:39] I know a lot about God brother
[2:08:41] okay let's see how shallow or deep your
[2:08:45] relationships
[2:08:48] Jesus said call upon me
[2:08:51] and I will ask
[2:09:02] watch this now observing this is where
[2:09:06] we learn
[2:09:07] they think
[2:09:09] the knowledge of God
[2:09:12] is to prove God's existence
[2:09:16] and establish a theological model to
[2:09:19] explain God's nature
[2:09:24] but the knowledge of God to the Hebrews
[2:09:28] is the relationship with God
[2:09:36] they view it
[2:09:38] having a life that is in relationship
[2:09:41] with him
[2:09:43] it's not just knowing who someone is
[2:09:47] that's even the problems in the homes
[2:09:50] been married 30 years and they still
[2:09:52] don't know their wife
[2:09:55] they still don't know their husbands oh
[2:09:58] they know them when they jump in bed
[2:10:01] forgive me I know there's children but
[2:10:04] that's all they want to know about it
[2:10:06] who is that person next to you
[2:10:10] I I know my wife
[2:10:13] I know my husband do you if you did you
[2:10:17] wouldn't have the problems that you have
[2:10:20] there's no depth in relationships
[2:10:24] [Music]
[2:10:27] a life in relationship
[2:10:29] it's not just the knowledge of knowing
[2:10:33] someone
[2:10:34] it is your Devotion to him
[2:10:42] you see Ben the juicy knowledge of God
[2:10:46] as intimacy with God
[2:10:51] that's why when we read Ephesians
[2:10:54] so we all come to the unity of the faith
[2:10:58] and the knowledge of the son of God
[2:11:03] that's right
[2:11:05] sonship
[2:11:07] the position
[2:11:11] it's an office
[2:11:13] come on now when you come to the
[2:11:15] knowledge of the Son of God
[2:11:17] what's your intimacy with him
[2:11:20] how deep does it go
[2:11:25] oh
[2:11:27] are we okay still Yes
[2:11:30] you want me to go on I can stop
[2:11:35] it's not to know how much facts or have
[2:11:38] how many facts about him
[2:11:42] you want to see how much you know
[2:11:44] how much do you know about his nature
[2:11:48] his character
[2:11:51] his mind
[2:11:54] now we're getting deeper you still want
[2:11:57] to get filled come on you still want to
[2:12:00] get filled
[2:12:03] it's the greatest message that has ever
[2:12:05] hit this planet Earth
[2:12:08] what did he come to do was to raise
[2:12:12] Jesus out of History
[2:12:20] I don't need anything else
[2:12:26] Christianity brother Branham says of
[2:12:29] today has become so shallow
[2:12:32] Oh but there's many a man he says
[2:12:36] coming down the road End of the Road
[2:12:40] we'll find out that that little shallow
[2:12:44] religion
[2:12:46] that you've been holding on
[2:12:49] it won't work
[2:12:52] nothing short of being born again
[2:12:58] it's got can't be a shell Affair
[2:13:02] something deep
[2:13:04] when I see this
[2:13:07] he says in the message Oneness
[2:13:10] what is it okay you've got to get with
[2:13:14] the word
[2:13:15] get yourself killed out
[2:13:19] here's the prophet
[2:13:21] I'm persuaded
[2:13:25] that many of us friends
[2:13:28] or you think it's enough because you're
[2:13:30] the friends with the pastor is
[2:13:35] friends with the propheta
[2:13:39] that many of us friends
[2:13:41] have received the Holy Ghost
[2:13:44] but
[2:13:46] we just received just enough holy ghosts
[2:13:51] to take us to a place where we don't
[2:13:54] want to lie
[2:13:56] and we don't want to steal
[2:14:00] we don't want to do anything
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:03] but God wants to feel better
[2:14:07] God wants to feel
[2:14:10] every fiber of his church
[2:14:13] come on tell your neighbors neighbor he
[2:14:17] wants to fill every fibers
[2:14:21] he wants to feel your thinking he wants
[2:14:25] to fill your mind he wants to fill every
[2:14:29] bit of you
[2:14:31] make you totally get to yourself
[2:14:35] and if the power of the Resurrection
[2:14:39] The Very life of God
[2:14:53] as well
[2:14:58] that's what the Holy Ghost was given
[2:15:01] foreign
[2:15:37] that comes at such great speeds
[2:15:43] that there's a collision that takes
[2:15:46] place
[2:15:49] oh come on church if you open yourself
[2:15:51] up right now there's a collision that's
[2:15:54] about to take place
[2:15:56] come on now there's a collision
[2:15:59] because they're going right head on to
[2:16:02] each other
[2:16:04] I hear the sound of thunder
[2:16:08] I hear the sound of collisions going on
[2:16:12] there's a fight there's a battle going
[2:16:14] on
[2:16:19] let me see where I'm at
[2:16:22] oh yeah
[2:16:25] The Mercy Seat
[2:16:27] I won't get to this other part but
[2:16:29] that's okay
[2:16:31] but I want to just turn the corner and
[2:16:33] then I'm gonna I'm gonna end with this
[2:16:36] kingdom comes
[2:16:38] but I want to say this
[2:16:40] now we're take talking about the chair
[2:16:43] of the throne
[2:16:45] it's over a domain
[2:16:48] now the first Throne was where
[2:16:52] in heaven and it's yellow the second
[2:16:55] throne
[2:16:57] was in Christ amen
[2:17:00] the third throne
[2:17:06] maybe this is some maybe this is one of
[2:17:09] the problems
[2:17:12] you should know he says
[2:17:15] the third Throne is where is
[2:17:18] you you don't sound excited about it
[2:17:22] the heart
[2:17:24] Corazon but when we're watching football
[2:17:27] games
[2:17:31] oh yeah we're jumping up and down and we
[2:17:34] get to church
[2:17:40] yeah what happened to that person that
[2:17:42] gets all excited
[2:17:44] and then I hear people say all the time
[2:17:47] I just don't feel oh no I don't know I
[2:17:51] don't feel like the Lord even even knows
[2:17:53] about me I feel like the Lord has left
[2:17:56] me let me ask you you know where he
[2:17:58] lives
[2:18:00] come on Church come on now
[2:18:02] do you know where he lives
[2:18:06] if you don't know where he lives
[2:18:13] let me ask you where he lives he lives
[2:18:16] in my heart really see
[2:18:19] not like that he don't know
[2:18:31] the Bible tells us
[2:18:33] you know where he dwells
[2:18:36] I usually tell people it's the last time
[2:18:39] you praise and worshiped the Lord
[2:18:44] I don't remember the last time I raised
[2:18:46] my hands
[2:18:48] you don't know where he lives
[2:18:52] the Bible says he inhabits
[2:18:56] [Applause]
[2:19:10] Praise Him
[2:19:16] so why are we acting like we don't know
[2:19:18] where he's where he lives come on
[2:19:19] worship Him Praise Him
[2:19:22] and see if he doesn't come on the scene
[2:19:28] it moved from Heaven to Christ
[2:19:30] and Christ into
[2:19:33] um
[2:19:44] we're coming around the corner here so
[2:19:47] let's let's get this now
[2:19:49] why did the throne move
[2:19:55] it didn't move just because he wanted to
[2:19:57] move it from one page to the other part
[2:20:04] he had a plan
[2:20:12] he had a plan
[2:20:15] the throne moves
[2:20:19] because the life is moving
[2:20:24] yeah
[2:20:27] the throne moves because the life is
[2:20:31] moving
[2:20:34] creation
[2:20:47] all right let that one soak in for a
[2:20:50] little bit
[2:20:51] and because it's moving all the time
[2:20:59] had to have Wills oh
[2:21:05] oh yeah the throne had to have wheels
[2:21:11] it ain't by a chance that you put wheels
[2:21:14] on this baby
[2:21:17] I walk in and I'm like yeah brother
[2:21:20] Caleb
[2:21:21] those got to be like 26s
[2:21:24] oh yeah
[2:21:26] yeah baby roll
[2:21:31] it it ain't by chance
[2:21:34] nothing happens by chance
[2:21:37] but rolls it has wheels the throne has
[2:21:40] wheels
[2:21:42] it's settled in a tabernacle one day
[2:21:45] and then it went to another tablet
[2:21:49] but some days
[2:21:51] the holy spirit will come to dwell in
[2:21:54] the hearts of the people
[2:21:58] and one word against it will never be
[2:22:02] forgiveness
[2:22:05] The Mercy Seat
[2:22:08] when he was sitting on The Mercy Seat
[2:22:12] the seat spoke
[2:22:15] it said
