my burden down by the riverside by the river down by the riverside gonna lay down my burden down by the riverside bring a body warm no more a man god bless you I'm going to read Jonah 1 verse 1 now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amitai saying arise go to Nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wicked for their wickedness is a had come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord you may be seated how many of you know the story of Jonah Wow what happens in the story of Jonah yeah now in the story of Jonah the Lord asked him to go do something playing brave they were asking to go preach to the people of Nineveh and interval at that time was a really bad place everyone there was really mean and they're all a bunch of crooks so he got scared and he didn't want to do it so he were he ran away and went the completely opposite direction he went to go take a vacation at Tarshish so in this story he goes he gets on the bow with more people that were leaving and then well there they were selling to Tarshish a big storm came and hit them and all the men on the boat were scared and afraid so they all cried unto the other gods and - Jonah what do we do and later and general was asleep at the bottom so they asked him why aren't you crying to your God and he went up and he saw the storm so then he told everyone he said this is my fault throw me throw me overboard and God will stop the storm and they didn't want to do it but when the storm got louder and louder they had no choice but they threw him over and asked God for forgiveness and Jonah go parently couldn't swim he thought you drown well he was drowning he saw a great fish come out from the sea and it swallowed him do you know how long Jonah was in the fish he was in there for three days and three nights so then the fish went back to land and spit Jonah out and Lord came and told him again go to Nineveh and preach the gospel so this time he went to Nineveh and listened to God now the reason that this story was in the Bible is to for us to relate to and sometimes God is going to ask us to do stuff that we don't want to do he's going to ask us to do things that will push us beyond our limits but the story of Jonah shows that even impossible is possible with God like for example whenever my dad asked me to preach for Sunday school for children church I didn't really want to I was a little nervous until I just finally decided to do it so no matter what God asked you to do just do it and be just disciplined because if you have God on your side anything is possible god bless you [Applause] amen this time we're going to ask receive our Minister for the brother will it is I can get you guys to come back up here and play a song real quick

no more or Jesus feeds 5000 after these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee which is the sea of Tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased and Jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples and the Passover a feast of the Jews was 9 when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company coming to him Philip where shall we go to buy food for all these people to eat he asked this only to test him for he already had in mind what he was going to do it'll take more than half a year's wages just to buy enough bread for each one to take a bite Master here's the boy with five low five loaves of bread and two - two fish but how how will we feed this menu with just this much that everyone stood down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand and Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks father we ask that you would bless this and that you would multiply it Amen Jesus then took the loaves and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted he did the same with the fish gather up all the fragments so that nothing may be lost so they gathered them and failed twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten after the people saw the sign Jesus performed they began to say surely this is the prophet who has come into the world Jesus knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force withdrew again to a mountain by himself Jesus looking Marty's boat to step out in and Jesus never Barras nothing unless he pays you back devil for what he uses if you've got a little faith let him have it awhile he'll make it great I tried like the fishes in the little boy's hand is this stick it only fed him but in Jesus hand had fed 5,000 it may be a little saying with you but just give it over to him and watch him bless it and bless others with it while little faith you have tonight give it over to him and he'll bless it and he'll use it for his glory amen isn't God good then did you enjoyed the little drama just just in just a minute or so a couple minutes but it shows what God can do not with somebody great did you guys notice did you guys notice who brought the fish and the envelopes who was it I'll tell everybody they're laid out boy it was a little boy can you imagine that a little boy just look around we see a little boys here just a young guy that God could use to do something so amazing did you hear the little boy talk did he have any words to say did he have a big sermon to preach but I bet when he left after Jesus fed the 5000 I bet that's that's the only thing he said the rest of his life imagine that he said guess what I did when that was a little without was a little guy maybe about undresses age brother Branham says one thing maybe he went fishing that day maybe he played hooky from school maybe he did other things but what he did is was something so great something that could stay with you for the rest of your life and that one thing you know you know kids that has great of a miracle as Jesus did that that day he could not do it without not only the little boy but without the rest of everyone having a little bit of faith now what's so incredible about the story is that when we read it they weren't inside of a city you know where they were out in the middle of nowhere they were out in the wilderness in a desert place you might see while there's there's trees and green well look we're in the desert right now and it's green right but they were in the middle of nowhere and you know what they were in church all day long whoa okay we went to church this morning right right what time did we come to church about nine o'clock right some of you got here at 9:00 awesome some of you got here 10:15 try again next time but it's okay we still got here but imagine they were still having church at this time Jesus comes then he's and he's telling it and he's and he's sharing things with them all day long yawn dead all day long what have you done all day long have you played video games all long maybe watch TV all day long is this guy she says he tries to play games all day long fries doesn't say that he does it but he tried but imagine she's he's still there in church all day long it's hot who they don't have comfortable chairs like you guys have some might be sitting on a rock some might be sitting on the grass so my bike some might be sitting on on dirt all day long and after a while who sometimes after 30 minutes or like man George is getting long right no no right after an hour oh my goodness two hours Wow but imagine after 910 hours whoa oh my goodness and they didn't even have breakfast they didn't even have lunch and dinners approaching oh my goodness what are we going to do oh maybe we could order some Domino's it was out of the delivery zone abdominal runners they were in the middle of nowhere there was no restaurants there was no place where they could eat so what were they going to do Jesus as he sees this multitude that has followed him from the city the disciples were like oh my goodness how in the world are we going to feed all these people that's when Jesus says you're gonna feed him what do you mean we're gonna feed them we don't even have a job we're following you Jesus will even have a job how can you buy buy food without having a job who disciples I hope you know how much it's going to cost to feed everybody not just to feed everybody but just for somebody just to have a one bite of food it's going to cost us a half a year's wages just not just to feed any feed everybody but for them just to have one little bite imagine half a year's wages you've got five thousand men not including the women and the children oh my goodness what's going to happen now you got to have something you got to have a little bit of faith and that's what we're going to do tonight we're going to challenge the faith of the young children tonight to see what we can do to see how many that we can feed tonight now you look who brought the food was just a little bitty guy but just a little bitty guy did so much for the rest of the people so we're going to challenge each and every one of you guys every one of you ladies we're going to take you to a challenge we're going to see tonight how it was done back then we're going to see how God can multiply the food that we have right now because how many how many young people do we have read about 25 or so so all right so
