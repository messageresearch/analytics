[39:35] special program prepared for you all and
[39:38] uh instead of just saying what's going
[39:41] off the top of my head I decided to
[39:43] actually write you all a Pros tonight to
[39:46] introduce the the program so I'm going
[39:49] to start reading it for you and as soon
[39:51] as I'm done we'll get this
[39:53] started Hebrews 11374 reads they were
[39:58] stoned they were saw asunder were
[40:01] tempted were slain with the sword they
[40:04] wanded about in sheep skins and goat
[40:06] skins being destitute Afflicted
[40:08] tormented of whom the world was not
[40:11] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[40:13] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[40:15] earth and these all having obtained a
[40:18] good report through faith received not
[40:20] the promise God having provided some
[40:22] better thing for us that they without us
[40:25] should not be made
[40:27] perfect 2023 has been a great year has
[40:31] had great results a great increase and a
[40:33] great trial though we have seen heard
[40:36] and felt the adversaries WS it has only
[40:38] made the testimony of Jesus Christ
[40:40] greater in our lives and the lives of
[40:43] hundreds of thousands but on a smaller
[40:45] scale not to be contrasted in saying one
[40:47] is lesser than the other we have seen
[40:49] this exact change progress and challenge
[40:53] in the youth 40 some members give or
[40:56] take have not only accepted the
[40:58] suffering of Christ but his reward
[41:01] Against All Odds persecution and
[41:03] Temptation the children of God the
[41:05] generation to come Stand Tall against
[41:07] the evil of this world Rising above and
[41:09] holding to the Lord
[41:11] steadfastly I as a member of the
[41:13] teaching Community can attest to how
[41:14] great a miracle it is that our youth
[41:16] retain their inheritance in the times
[41:18] we're living in parents along with all
[41:20] members of the body of Jesus Christ you
[41:23] should be proud of them to those of you
[41:24] who consider yourselves neither if you
[41:26] are looking for a miracle the children
[41:28] of God are one
[41:30] walking these same children the youth
[41:33] have not only chosen to carry their
[41:34] cross but have combined their Collective
[41:36] gifts for the edification of the body of
[41:38] Jesus Christ creating what you see today
[41:42] this play you are about to see has been
[41:43] carefully curated by your very own every
[41:46] prop you see was Handmade by one of them
[41:48] every stage piece was made under the
[41:50] inspiration given to everyone the music
[41:53] acting special effects and even some
[41:55] aspects of the script that needed an
[41:57] edit were done by the best of the best
[41:59] the Cedar Hills Church of the Cross
[42:01] youth I find this to be no surprise
[42:03] given the inspiration and center of
[42:05] study given to us this year by our
[42:06] pastor which was the study of the
[42:08] martyrs to those of whom the world was
[42:10] not worthy we give you the best we have
[42:13] to offer is the least we could give for
[42:15] those who gave everything for us the
[42:17] faith and this message showing us that
[42:19] it was and is worth dying for though
[42:23] today we may not face persecution on the
[42:24] physical plane we see it on the plane of
[42:26] principalities who seek to kill us
[42:28] spiritually and yet the children of God
[42:31] Stand Tall dying to ourselves and
[42:33] continuing our walk with the Lord this
[42:35] leads us to stevenh the first recorded
[42:38] martyr in the Bible the Holy Ghost
[42:40] filled man who didn't care what the
[42:42] world status quo was how dangerous it
[42:44] was to Believe In Christ or how
[42:46] unpopular being a Christian could be
[42:48] Stephen said what needed to be said
[42:50] regardless of the consequences in the
[42:52] words of the modern generation quote he
[42:54] stood on business he was about his
[42:57] father's business still the price of
[42:59] perfection is death primarily of Christ
[43:02] exemplified in the lives given for his
[43:04] sake and ours unknown and known this
[43:07] play is dedicated to the one who gave
[43:09] his life for the Lord from Cedar Hills
[43:10] Church of the Cross to you may your
[43:12] story Inspire those here today and those
[43:15] who will see this tomorrow as it did for
[43:17] us and myself this latter half of the
[43:19] Year may this play be a spark to light
[43:21] our fire for this coming year and punch
[43:23] the Antichrist spirit in the face as
[43:25] Steven did fighting the spiritual battle
[43:28] that was and is and will always be
[43:30] called the good fight that Antichrist
[43:33] spirit is still here as wrathful as it
[43:35] was then seeking whom he may devour we
[43:37] do not go forward fearing it but rather
[43:39] stand against it loving as God has
[43:41] commanded and being sound in our
[43:42] thinking just as Stephen did in his time
[43:45] as you will soon see and on that note
[43:48] brothers and sisters I pray you enjoy
[43:50] this play from our youth to you now
[43:52] presenting the story of a man who was
[43:54] full of faith and power was a work
[43:56] worker of Miracles and dedicated his
[43:58] life to the Lord the Martyr anthologies
[44:00] Steven of whom the world was not worthy
[44:02] the first of many plays to come God
[44:05] bless
[44:07] [Applause]
[44:25] you
[44:27] [Music]
[44:29] justes has a great
[44:31] embodiment jeski knew and admitted that
[44:34] Christianity had been defeated by
[44:36] rational faculty by the intellect the
[44:39] genius
[44:40] himself I'm a Christian ask me about my
[44:43] faith gosh these people never get old
[44:47] man so you're one of those people huh
[44:51] nice to meet you too I don't think nice
[44:53] is the word I would use well what word
[44:56] would you use um annoying annoying yeah
[45:01] what about this is annoying oh oh you
[45:05] hate reading huh um no actually I read
[45:08] quite a lot that's how I know that that
[45:10] little book of yours is nothing but a
[45:12] farce really your book says that sure
[45:15] does which ones oh you know science and
[45:18] constant change the Big Bang explosive
[45:21] guarantee of the real world of science
[45:22] that we made up I could go on explosive
[45:25] guarantee
[45:26] look I didn't name the books I just read
[45:28] them I mean I get that but the real
[45:31] question is which editions did you read
[45:33] uh fourth fifth I don't know why does
[45:36] that matter just seems like a lot of
[45:38] change for something so
[45:40] constant funny and bull talk for someone
[45:43] who has 50 different versions of the
[45:45] same Bible look the translations may
[45:48] change but the text is the same besides
[45:50] I don't own 50 different versions of the
[45:52] Bible I just have the one right shows
[45:55] how educated you
[45:57] are look not that I'm not enjoying our
[46:00] conversation but may I ask what brought
[46:02] you over here could have kept walking
[46:04] eating your sandwich and enjoy the rest
[46:07] of your day but instead you came over
[46:09] here to well discuss the fses of my
[46:12] faith does something about it bother you
[46:15] bother me no I'm just sick of you people
[46:17] and your oppressive Faith
[46:19] oppressive what's oppressive is it you
[46:23] no it is your people and by association
[46:25] you me yes I'm not oppressing anyone but
[46:29] I may be ooling
[46:31] someone okay okay look you actually seem
[46:34] pretty nice from what I can tell thank
[46:36] you and that's the problem why I just
[46:39] don't get it I don't get how you can sit
[46:40] there with the smile on your face
[46:42] feeling the breeze admiring the blossoms
[46:44] as a bird's tweet as if there weren't a
[46:46] thousand problems in the world it's so
[46:48] frustrating and the truth comes out and
[46:51] what of it nothing nothing as a matter
[46:53] of fact I heard that the truth can set
[46:55] you free who says that at this point I
[46:58] don't think you want to know what would
[46:59] be important for you to know is that the
[47:02] issues you have with me seem to be more
[47:04] issues you have with yourself what no
[47:08] you want to talk about
[47:10] it sure don't worry I don't
[47:16] bite but make sure not to touch my Bible
[47:19] just can I start to S what actually no
[47:22] no of course not it's just a joke it's
[47:25] just leather and pain
[47:26] okay let's start there leather and paper
[47:29] how can you believe in that well simply
[47:32] speaking it's about
[47:35] faith proceed well simply speaking it's
[47:39] about faith believing it taking God out
[47:42] his word and the rest will follow see
[47:44] that's what bothers me saying just
[47:46] believe it what are the facts to back it
[47:48] up how can you prove to me that that's
[47:50] real well the same way that you believe
[47:52] your science books are real you take it
[47:54] on faith but that's different because my
[47:56] books are based on facts not
[47:59] Faith proven facts that have been built
[48:01] over thousands of years your book was
[48:04] written by a bunch of dudes without any
[48:05] documentation to back it
[48:07] up kind of like how your books were
[48:09] written by a bunch of dudes with facts
[48:11] that change every year requiring new
[48:15] additions almost
[48:16] annually sounds like you have a lot more
[48:18] faith than me to me that seems a lot
[48:21] more
[48:22] unbelievable all right touche but's
[48:25] still there has to be something more
[48:27] surely what else do you have to prove to
[48:29] me that what you have is the truth well
[48:32] something that adds to my faith is the
[48:33] sacrifice of it all now I'm not just
[48:35] talking about Jesus even though his is
[48:37] the most important I'm talking about the
[48:38] martyrs known and unknown the ones that
[48:41] sacrific their life for our
[48:43] life Faith through sacrifice that seems
[48:46] a bit backwards it's not backwards it's
[48:48] a provided way okay whatever about these
[48:52] Martyrs who are these people you don't
[48:54] know about the martyrs
[48:56] and you call yourself a reader look I
[48:58] never had a reason to look into them nor
[49:00] a desire up till well now so you're
[49:03] saying you have an interest I'm saying
[49:05] is that for now you can call me a fish
[49:08] cuz I'm hooked good
[49:11] one thanks you got any stories well one
[49:13] comes to mind well I I have I've got
[49:16] I've got time and sustenance well then
[49:19] you're all set this is the story of
[49:22] Stephen in those days when the number
[49:25] number of disciples multiplied there was
[49:28] muming of the grecians against the
[49:30] Hebrews even their widows were neglected
[49:32] in the daily
[49:34] Ministry because of this the 12 stated
[49:36] that instead of serving tables they
[49:38] should bring the word of God they
[49:41] commanded the multitude to bring forth
[49:43] seven Men of Honor support who are full
[49:46] of the Holy Ghost and wisdom to send
[49:50] Stephen was among those seven why you
[49:52] may ask Not only was he full
[49:56] of faith and the Holy Ghost but also
[49:58] power of both Mind and Spirit because of
[50:02] this he did great wonders and worked
[50:03] many miracles among the people like what
[50:06] oh I don't know you name it I guess he
[50:09] made the lame wall the blind see and the
[50:12] deaf to hear you expect me to believe
[50:15] that no not really but other men
[50:17] certainly did enough to make them very
[50:22] upset
[50:24] interesting
[50:27] [Music]

[50:38] you oh my goodness Sirus can you believe
[50:42] what Stephen has been doing whether want
[50:45] to believe or not libertine the things

[55:09] is Steven speech oh you carry his speech
[55:12] around it's a good speech all right now
[55:17] unlike me Stephen said all this under
[55:19] the inspiration without any paper
[55:21] necessary and what he said when a little
[55:24] something like
[55:26] brothers and fathers listen to me the
[55:30] glory of God has appeared to Our Father
[55:31] Abraham while he was still in
[55:33] Mesopotamia before he lived in haran
[55:35] leave your country and your people God
[55:37] said and go to a land where I will show
[55:39] you so he left the land of Chalin and
[55:42] settled in haran after the death of his
[55:45] father God sent him to this land where
[55:48] you guys are now living
[55:50] in he gave him no inheritance here not
[55:53] even not even enough ground to set his
[55:55] foot
[55:56] upon but God Almighty promised him
[56:00] through him and his descendants would
[56:02] possess this land which you guys are
[56:03] staying in even though at the time
[56:06] Abraham had no
[56:07] child God spoke to him in this way for
[56:10] 400 years you and your descendants will
[56:13] be strangers in a country not of your
[56:14] own and they will be enslaved and and
[56:17] served as slaves God said afterward they
[56:20] will come out of that place and worship
[56:23] me then he gave Abraham the Covenant of
[56:26] circumcision and Abraham became the
[56:28] father of Isaac and circumcised him
[56:31] eight days after his birth later Isaac
[56:34] became the father of Jacob and Jacob
[56:36] became the father of the of the 12
[56:38] Patriarchs because the Patriarchs were
[56:40] jealous of Joseph they stole him as a
[56:42] slave into Egypt but God Almighty was
[56:45] with him and rescued him from all of his
[56:48] troubles he gave Joseph wisdom and
[56:50] enabled him to gain Good Will from the
[56:53] Pharaoh king of Egypt so Pharaoh made
[56:56] him ruler over Egypt and all of his
[56:59] place but then Great Famine struck Egypt
[57:03] and Canaan bringing forth great
[57:05] sufferings and our ancestors could not
[57:07] find food when Jacob heard these things
[57:10] and great when he heard that there was
[57:11] things in when he heard that there was
[57:14] grain in Egypt he sent our forefathers
[57:17] and the on his first visit he went on
[57:20] the first visit on the second visit
[57:22] Joseph told his brothers who he was and
[57:24] the learned about Joseph's family after
[57:27] this Joseph sent for his father Jacob
[57:29] and his whole family 75 and all then
[57:33] Jacob went down to Egypt where he had
[57:35] our an where all our our ancestors have
[57:40] died where their bodies were brought
[57:43] back to shech and placed in the Tomb
[57:45] that Abraham had bought for their sons
[57:48] for some for a certain sum of
[57:51] money as the time Drew near for God to
[57:53] fulfill his Almighty Pro promise to
[57:56] Abram Abraham the number of our people
[57:59] greatly grew in Egypt then a new king to
[58:02] whom Joseph meant nothing came to power
[58:04] in Egypt he dealt treacherously with our
[58:07] people and oppressed our ancestors by
[58:09] forcing them to throw out their newborn
[58:10] babies so that they would
[58:13] die what at this time Moses was born oh
[58:17] he was an ordinary child for 3 months he
[58:19] was Cared by his family but then he was
[58:22] placed outside Pharaoh's daughter took
[58:25] him and brought him up as her own son
[58:27] Moses was educated in all the wisdom of
[58:30] Egyptians and was powerful in speech and
[58:36] wisdom when Moses was 40 years old he
[58:39] decided to visit his own people the
[58:40] Israelites he saw one of them being
[58:42] mistreated mistreated by an
[58:46] Egyptian so he went into the fence and
[58:49] by killing the Egyptian Moses thought
[58:51] that his own people would realize that
[58:52] God was using him to rescue them but but
[58:54] they did not the next day Moses went
[58:57] upon two Israelites that were fighting
[58:59] and have you and he had to try to
[59:01] reconcile them by saying men you are
[59:03] brothers why do you guys not want to
[59:05] hurt each other but the man who was
[59:08] mistreating the other pushed Moses and
[59:10] said are you thinking of killing me as
[59:12] you killed the other Egyptian yesterday
[59:15] when Moses heard this he fled to Midian
[59:17] where he settled as a foreigner and had
[59:20] two
[59:20] sons after 40 years had passed an angel
[59:24] appeared to Moses in flames in a burning
[59:26] bush in this desert near Mount
[59:30] Si when he saw this he was amazed at the
[59:33] sight as he went over to get a closer
[59:36] look he heard the Lord say I am the god
[59:38] of your fathers the god of Abraham Isaac
[59:41] Jacob Moses trembled in fear and did not
[59:43] dare to look but then the Lord told them
[59:47] take off your sandals for this place
[59:48] where you are now standing in is
[59:51] Holy I have indeed seen the oppression
[59:54] of my people people in Egypt I have
[59:56] heard their groanings and have come down
[1:00:00] for you to set them free now come I will
[1:00:03] send you back to
[1:00:04] Egypt this is the same Moses keep in
[1:00:07] mind this is the same Moses that they
[1:00:09] had rejected with their own words who
[1:00:11] made you ruler and
[1:00:13] judge he
[1:00:15] sent he sent there to be the ruler and
[1:00:17] delivered by God himself through the
[1:00:20] angel who appeared to him in that bush
[1:00:22] he led him out of Egypt and performed
[1:00:25] wonders and signs into Egypt at the Red
[1:00:27] Sea for 40 years in the
[1:00:29] wilderness by his own
[1:00:32] people but he he was an assembly in the
[1:00:35] wilderness when the angel spoke to him
[1:00:37] on Mount Si with their ancestors and
[1:00:39] received living words to pass on to us
[1:00:43] but our ancestors refused to obey him
[1:00:45] instead they rejected him in their own
[1:00:48] and they return their hearts back to
[1:00:50] Egypt so they told Aaron make us God who
[1:00:54] will go before us as for this fellow
[1:00:57] Moses who led us out of Egypt we don't
[1:00:59] know what has happened to him that was
[1:01:02] the time when they made an idol form of
[1:01:04] a calf they brought him sacrifices to it
[1:01:08] and revealed in what their own hands
[1:01:10] have made oh but God turned them away
[1:01:13] and gave them over to worship the the
[1:01:15] moon and the
[1:01:18] stars this agrees with of what is
[1:01:20] written in the book of the prophets did
[1:01:22] you bring sacrifices an offering for 40
[1:01:24] years into the Wilderness people of
[1:01:26] Israel you have taken up the Tabernacle
[1:01:28] of Mo and the star of your God refin the
[1:01:31] idols you made to worship therefore I
[1:01:34] will send you into Exile Beyond Babylon
[1:01:38] I don't even know those words our
[1:01:40] ancestors had the Tabernacle of Covenant
[1:01:43] law with them in the wilderness it had
[1:01:46] been made the scene after receiving the
[1:01:48] Tabernacle of her ancestors under Joshua
[1:01:51] brought it with
[1:01:52] them then they took the Land from the
[1:01:54] nation that God drove out of them before
[1:01:57] it remained into the into the land until
[1:02:00] it was time of David who enjoyed in
[1:02:02] God's favor and asked that he might
[1:02:04] provide a dwelling place for God of
[1:02:07] Jacob but it was Solomon who built the
[1:02:09] house however the most high does not
[1:02:13] live in houses made by human hands oh no
[1:02:16] as the prophet said Heaven is my throne
[1:02:19] and Earth is my foot stol excuse what

[1:02:54] betrayed and murdered him you who have
[1:02:58] received the law that was given him

[1:03:19] Antichrist but where are they taking him

[1:04:35] the truth is love God's love and God's
[1:04:38] love is overwhelming when you really
[1:04:40] take him at his word take him in that's
[1:04:44] when you really see him that's when he
[1:04:46] becomes more than just a religion or an
[1:04:49] old book he becomes real then once you
[1:04:52] feel the gravity of the sit situation
[1:04:55] cannot Escape his pool the same pool the
[1:04:58] planets to the Sun s similar to the pool
[1:05:01] you felt walking by the
[1:05:05] stand I see I just I I don't understand
[1:05:10] that after all they did to him he didn't
[1:05:12] want them to be held accountable for
[1:05:13] what they did that's love God's love a
[1:05:18] true man of God who is filled with the
[1:05:21] Holy
[1:05:23] Spirit that's what Christianity really
[1:05:25] is that's who God really is don't get me
[1:05:29] wrong I hear what you're saying but I
[1:05:31] this I fail to understand to see how
[1:05:35] this is supposed to add to your faith
[1:05:38] personally I'm more terrified now than
[1:05:40] what I was from when I first got here I
[1:05:43] get that look the Lord doesn't give us a
[1:05:47] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[1:05:50] and of a sound mind though the devil
[1:05:53] would want us to to live in fear or
[1:05:55] martyrdom we don't because we don't fear
[1:05:58] him but God we believe that all things
[1:06:01] work together for good to those who love
[1:06:04] God to those who are called according to
[1:06:06] his purpose and if we believe in him
[1:06:08] regardless of the trials and
[1:06:10] tribulations we
[1:06:12] face then we will receive eternal life
[1:06:15] the protection of God and the promise
[1:06:16] that is in the Kingdom of Heaven the
[1:06:19] death of the Saints ask our fa Faith
[1:06:21] because it it humbles us
[1:06:24] it makes God so much more real and
[1:06:27] there's very few real things in this
[1:06:29] life than blood blood has been shed for
[1:06:32] me time and time again that tells me
[1:06:35] that though the world may doubt and
[1:06:37] disagree the Saints knew that the word
[1:06:39] of God was worth dying for if nothing
[1:06:41] else but for my sake for whosoever will
[1:06:46] the same as Christ and those who have
[1:06:48] spiritually died after Faith your
[1:06:51] sacrifice is Faith in what's real
[1:06:55] it's kind of beautiful when you put it
[1:06:57] that way a relationship with the Lord
[1:06:59] It's a romance it's beautiful if you
[1:07:02] just let him show you how beautiful it
[1:07:03] can be not only through you but through
[1:07:06] those who stand for
[1:07:08] him man I see that now but you know
[1:07:11] those men didn't deserve him he was far
[1:07:13] too good for them he was of whom the
[1:07:17] world was not worthy of I'm guessing
[1:07:19] that's another scripture you're quoting
[1:07:21] it is Hebrews
[1:07:22] 11:38 nice
[1:07:24] you know um I'm sorry for how I treated
[1:07:27] you I've realized that I've held in a
[1:07:29] lot of bitterness towards God and it's I
[1:07:32] can see now that I was wrong not only
[1:07:34] for how I treated God but for how I
[1:07:35] treated you I'm really sorry can you
[1:07:39] forgive me as Heil so can I how could I

[1:10:21] was kind of cool to present it that way
[1:10:24] um you know our pastor always tells us
[1:10:26] to put ourselves in in shoes right and
[1:10:29] to make it personal so I kind of put
[1:10:31] myself in her shoes and I wrote it in
[1:10:33] the first person so I'm going to read it
[1:10:34] for you guys yeah okay
[1:10:37] go I am Jonah Arc a humble servant of
[1:10:40] God chosen to fulfill a Divine Mission
[1:10:43] from a young age I felt a deep
[1:10:44] connection to the Divine hearing the
[1:10:46] voices of saints and receiving visions
[1:10:48] that guided me God's presence in my life
[1:10:50] was palpable guiding my every step and
[1:10:53] fing filling me with unwavering faith it
[1:10:55] was through his grace that I found the
[1:10:57] strength and the courage to lead the
[1:10:58] French army into battle despite the odds
[1:11:01] stacked against us I knew that God's
[1:11:03] will was at work and I trusted in his
[1:11:05] plan in moments of doubt and uncertainty
[1:11:08] I turned to prayer seeking guidance and
[1:11:10] soless from the almighty through these
[1:11:13] conversations with God I found Clarity
[1:11:15] and the conviction to persevere even
[1:11:18] when faced with skepticism and
[1:11:20] betrayal throughout my journey I relied
[1:11:23] on God's strength to overcome the
[1:11:25] challenges that arose he provided me
[1:11:27] with the necessary skills and knowledge
[1:11:29] knowledge to lead the troops inspiring
[1:11:31] them with his divine presence I
[1:11:34] understood that my role was not only to
[1:11:35] fight for France but also to serve as a
[1:11:37] vessel for God's will even during my
[1:11:39] darkest moments such as my capture and
[1:11:41] subsequent trial I clung to my faith in
[1:11:44] God I knew that he was with me providing
[1:11:46] me with the strength to defend myself
[1:11:48] against the false accusations and face
[1:11:50] my impending death with unwavering WI
[1:11:53] resolve God's presence in my life
[1:11:55] continued to shine even after my passing
[1:11:58] my story became a testament to the power
[1:12:00] of faith and courage that comes from
[1:12:01] trusting in God's plan I am Jon of Arc
[1:12:04] forever grateful for God's pre for God's
[1:12:07] guidance and unwavering faith that
[1:12:08] carried me through the my extra
[1:12:10] extraordinary Journey my life serves as
[1:12:13] a reminder that when we align ourselves
[1:12:14] with God's will anything is possible and
[1:12:17] his presence can carry us even through
[1:12:19] the most challenging of circumstances I
[1:12:22] lived a life that this world was not
[1:12:23] worthy of did you
[1:12:28] guys awesome right yeah yeah so did you
[1:12:31] guys like study anybody or just me cuz I
[1:12:35] know it couldn't just be
[1:12:37] me have y'all ever heard of Ann huton
[1:12:41] Hutchinson sorry so I happened to write
[1:12:46] something in her point of view as well
[1:12:49] go something like this I am I am an
[1:12:51] Hutchinson a remarkable woman who lived
[1:12:54] in the 17th century I was born in
[1:12:56] England and later later immigrated to
[1:12:58] Massachusetts Bay Colony in America with
[1:13:00] my husband and children I was known for
[1:13:03] my strong religious beliefs and
[1:13:04] involvement in the Puritan Community I
[1:13:07] became a prominent figure in the colony
[1:13:09] holding religious meetings in my home
[1:13:11] where I discussed and challenged sermons
[1:13:13] of the Puritan ministers I believe that
[1:13:16] salvation came through faith alone
[1:13:18] rather than through good works which was
[1:13:20] controversial stance at the time this
[1:13:22] led to conflicts with the religious
[1:13:24] leaders and the established church
[1:13:26] despite facing opposition I fearlessly
[1:13:28] continued to express express my beliefs
[1:13:31] my influence grew as PE as people were
[1:13:34] drawn to the Bible studies and meetings
[1:13:36] I held in my home in December of 1936 a
[1:13:39] group of opposing clergymen called upon
[1:13:42] me to try to convince me to to deny my
[1:13:44] beliefs after being exiled from the
[1:13:46] Puritan Church my response was the Lord
[1:13:49] judges not as a man judges better to be
[1:13:51] cast out of the church than deny Christ
[1:13:53] Christ after my Exile I settled in Rhode
[1:13:56] Island where I continued to practice my
[1:13:57] faith and advocate for a belief in the
[1:13:59] personal relationship with the Lord my
[1:14:02] legacy lies in challenging the authority
[1:14:04] of the established the established
[1:14:06] church for they would not allow me a
[1:14:08] place to live only a place to die in
[1:14:11] summary Ian Hutchinson was I'm a
[1:14:14] courageous and influential cre figure in
[1:14:18] colonial America who stood up for her
[1:14:20] beliefs and lived a life not worth
[1:14:24] of whom the of whom the world is not
[1:14:27] worthy of sorry than wow that was
[1:14:29] amazing well see I went a different
[1:14:31] route I is a third person so what I did
[1:14:35] was I wrote about you guys know who
[1:14:37] anpus
[1:14:40] was hey you guys so anpus was a very
[1:14:44] faithful man to the Lord Jesus during
[1:14:47] the perg church age of course he was a
[1:14:50] loyal martyr and wasn't ashamed of his
[1:14:52] beliefs and what was inspiring to me
[1:14:55] about him is was his faith he gave his
[1:14:58] life everything to God everything but
[1:15:01] not even death was a power enough was
[1:15:04] powerful enough to interrupt The Works
[1:15:05] of God he was killed during the reign of
[1:15:08] Nero by burning in a Brazen bull bull
[1:15:11] but shaped
[1:15:14] altar it was what what a
[1:15:18] faith I also wrote mine in third
[1:15:21] person have you guys heard the story of
[1:15:25] Victor I know tell us tell us brother
[1:15:29] well Victor was a gentle charitable
[1:15:33] Christian and this Christian still
[1:15:35] happen to live in the worst time of the
[1:15:38] 10 persecutions of the Roman
[1:15:42] Church and many of the killings of the
[1:15:45] martyrs were written as
[1:15:47] unspeakable and well Victor in spite of
[1:15:51] all this
[1:15:54] Victor spot this was a charitable
[1:15:56] Christian he often spent most of his
[1:15:58] time visiting the poor giv to the poor
[1:16:01] visiting the sick and the needy and he
[1:16:04] did this so much that his reputation as
[1:16:06] a charitable Christian got so grew so
[1:16:10] widespread that it even reached the
[1:16:13] emperor and the thing was that Emperor
[1:16:17] hated the
[1:16:19] Christians and up in hearing this the
[1:16:21] emperor sent him to be dragged through
[1:16:23] the streets and he was stoned and beaten
[1:16:25] by hateful
[1:16:28] pagans and when he was thrown
[1:16:31] in like in back in the ancient Roman
[1:16:35] days the martyrs were examined examined
[1:16:38] basically like a it's like court and in
[1:16:41] this court they would give him the
[1:16:42] ultimatum Freedom or recent your faith
[1:16:46] recent your faith and
[1:16:49] well Victor he stood steadfast he was
[1:16:52] beaten he he was stretched on the rack
[1:16:54] and tortured at the same time but he
[1:16:57] didn't let go he was so courageous that
[1:17:01] he he was so courageous that even the
[1:17:03] even his tormentors were tired of
[1:17:05] torturing him that's how courageous and
[1:17:08] that's how strong he was in his
[1:17:11] faith and Well
[1:17:15] on
[1:17:21] yeah and it so happened that I think on
[1:17:24] his second
[1:17:25] examination right after it was tortured
[1:17:28] he was thrown in prison and this prison
[1:17:30] it wasn't like a nice pretty ones that
[1:17:32] we
[1:17:34] have was the worst of the worst and
[1:17:39] well he would he was thrown in there
[1:17:43] beaten and bruised and
[1:17:44] hurt but even though he was
[1:17:48] hurt he still had the courage and they
[1:17:51] couldn't beat the life out of of them
[1:17:53] and that same life he preached to his
[1:17:56] same captors he converted three of his
[1:17:58] jailers to Christ can you believe
[1:18:01] that and those three and when the
[1:18:04] emperor heard of those well they they
[1:18:06] were beheaded and Victor was yet beaten
[1:18:09] again it was brutally beaten this time
[1:18:12] but his third examination that's where
[1:18:15] Glory came his third examination he was
[1:18:19] presented to a pagan altar with an idol
[1:18:22] on top of it
[1:18:23] and well he was given incense and he was
[1:18:25] told he was given this ultimatum either
[1:18:28] you sacrifice to your God or you die and
[1:18:31] for some this could have been a hard
[1:18:33] question but for Victor his Godly Zeal
[1:18:36] made him kick over that
[1:18:38] altar oh I can't believe this I can't
[1:18:42] believe it oh my goodness he kicked over
[1:18:44] the Altar and this made the emperor so
[1:18:47] mad oh my goodness and well they cut off
[1:18:49] his
[1:18:51] leg and he was later Taken to a grain to
[1:18:54] a Mill and it was crushed under the
[1:18:57] millstones I'm sorry I'm taking so much
[1:18:59] of your time but it's just so amazing I
[1:19:02] me
[1:19:04] and he didn't let go that's what's
[1:19:06] amazing he identified himself with the
[1:19:08] word he became the word that's amazing
[1:19:12] what do you think well I didn't write
[1:19:14] one but one does come to mind you know
[1:19:17] when we think of Martyrs especially the
[1:19:18] disciples we think mostly of well Peter
[1:19:21] Steven uh do you all remember the story
[1:19:24] of
[1:19:25] Andrew well just for a facts if you need
[1:19:28] a refresher Andrew was Peter's younger
[1:19:30] brother and uh tradition has it that he
[1:19:33] preached to many Asiatic Nations and he
[1:19:35] was crucified in Essa now this story
[1:19:38] takes place in about 66 ad Andrew was in
[1:19:42] Greece and he voluntarily went to the
[1:19:45] governor and his name was agias and he
[1:19:47] was trying to persuade him not to
[1:19:48] persecute the Christians and then he was
[1:19:51] also telling him that the things that he
[1:19:53] and his people were doing were wrong
[1:19:55] they were worshiping Idols false gods
[1:19:58] and he told the governor he said it is
[1:20:00] good for you a judger of men the first
[1:20:03] know your judge who sits in heaven all
[1:20:06] this saying along with all the other
[1:20:07] words that Andrew was saying made the
[1:20:09] king mad and he said are you the same
[1:20:12] person who has overthrown the Temple of
[1:20:14] the Gods and is persuading and telling
[1:20:16] the men to be superstitious and go
[1:20:19] against the thing of Rome things of Rome
[1:20:22] and he answered the king and he said the
[1:20:24] Romans don't understand the truth he
[1:20:26] said Jesus came down from heaven into
[1:20:29] the world to teach you that the things
[1:20:31] that you are doing are wrong he said the
[1:20:34] false gods and uh Idols you worship are
[1:20:37] not Gods but they are devils he said you
[1:20:40] teach the people to do the very things
[1:20:42] which are offensive to God so he turns
[1:20:44] away from you I mean can you believe
[1:20:46] that and not even know you're doing it
[1:20:48] like that's that's crazy so then he said
[1:20:52] at this point he said when they serve
[1:20:55] Devils the people fall into wickedness
[1:20:57] and after they're dead the only thing
[1:20:59] left for them is their evil Deeds at
[1:21:02] this the governor was enraged mad
[1:21:05] Furious and he said enough he said if
[1:21:07] you ever preach or teach your Doctrine
[1:21:09] again he said we will fasten you to a
[1:21:11] cross with haste and this is the good
[1:21:14] part I can imagine Andrew he probably
[1:21:17] you know took a breath in knew what he
[1:21:18] had to say and do and I can imagine he
[1:21:21] maybe squared his shoulders a little bit
[1:21:22] looked the governor boldly in the eye
[1:21:25] and told all the people and he said sir
[1:21:27] if I was afraid of the cross I would not
[1:21:30] have taught the glory majesty and honor
[1:21:32] of it at these words it was done he was
[1:21:36] sentenced to be
[1:21:37] crucified as they were nearing the place
[1:21:39] of the execution he wasn't sad but he
[1:21:42] was he was filled with joy to go out of
[1:21:46] this world the same way his Lord did on
[1:21:48] a cross he said the nearer I am to the
[1:21:51] cross the near near I am to God the
[1:21:54] farther away from the cross the farther
[1:21:56] I am from him for 3 Days Andrew was hung
[1:21:59] on this cross he was instructing and
[1:22:01] telling the people around to steadfast
[1:22:03] hold steadfastly to the words of the
[1:22:06] promises of God and the doctrine they
[1:22:07] had received from him after 3 days the
[1:22:11] Christians went to the governor to ask
[1:22:13] him for his release so they can he could
[1:22:15] be released to them at this point he
[1:22:17] said oh Lord he said let not your
[1:22:20] servant uh to be be released to dwell
[1:22:23] among men again he said I have known you
[1:22:25] I have loved you and I have kept your
[1:22:27] ways he said you are the one I desire to
[1:22:30] see he said it is in you I am what I am
[1:22:35] having said his final words on this
[1:22:36] Earth he committed his Spirit into his
[1:22:39] Lord's hands and what stood about what
[1:22:42] stood out to me about Peter uh Andrew
[1:22:44] sorry was he wasn't afraid to tell the
[1:22:46] people yeah I'm a Christian I will
[1:22:49] willingly take up my cross and follow
[1:22:51] Christ and I think that's it's a good
[1:22:52] lesson for you know not only Us but make
[1:22:55] it personal me we shouldn't be ashamed
[1:22:57] afraid or embarrassed to take up our
[1:23:00] cross and follow Jesus and well that's
[1:23:03] what I had to
[1:23:04] say this gospel really is dripping with
[1:23:07] blood isn't it it

[1:29:58] place and um I knocked on the
[1:30:01] door and I went

[1:31:09] sorry okay one
[1:31:11] um my my husband brother Ross would go
[1:31:14] to church with me once in a
[1:31:20] while and um

[1:31:42] car those nice cars where your honey you
[1:31:45] could sit next to your
[1:31:50] honey
[1:31:57] yeah I like those
[1:32:00] cars
[1:32:03] anyhow so uh my husband
[1:32:07] drove and then was Tommy and L in the
[1:32:11] front
[1:32:17] seat sister Viola sister Ruth and myself
[1:32:20] were in the back seat
[1:32:27] we were going through the black
[1:32:36] range
[1:32:39] and brother r a
[1:32:45] cigarette and I told him what are you
[1:32:48] doing he I want to smoke I says no
[1:32:50] you're not cuz then we going to
[1:32:55] stink and Tommy turns back and tells me
[1:33:08] hello
[1:33:13] okay and then we already get to TC and I
[1:33:17] know he knew what was up well that was
[1:33:20] our pastor he knew
[1:33:22] dealt with
[1:33:29] him or we got there to Sister Lucy's
[1:33:34] house and we all started
[1:33:38] praying and the power of the Lord came
[1:33:41] down real
[1:33:45] strong and
[1:33:47] um the presence of God was so thick it
[1:33:51] was this was something new for me and I
[1:33:53] had never witnessed that
[1:33:58] before and a prophecy
[1:34:02] came by
[1:34:04] God he used Freddy py if any of you
[1:34:07] remember Freddy
[1:34:08] pel
[1:34:13] fredd and
[1:34:16] um he gave he prophesied or the Lord
[1:34:20] prophesied to
[1:34:22] brother
[1:34:28] Ross and he told him a lot of things but
[1:34:31] I I don't remember
[1:34:35] them but one thing he did say that had
[1:34:39] SLI my
[1:34:44] mind he told brother
[1:34:47] Ross I give you your
[1:34:50] son
[1:34:53] I had forgotten about this
[1:34:58] prophecy and uh about a month
[1:35:04] ago my pastor and sister uh La came to
[1:35:08] our
[1:35:10] house and
[1:35:13] um he was talking with my
[1:35:17] son and the Lord spoke to me and
[1:35:20] said
[1:35:22] remember the
[1:35:24] prophecy that I was going to give you
[1:35:26] your
[1:35:27] son so I started telling
[1:35:32] Pastor he said you got to give this
[1:35:36] testimony the reason why
[1:35:40] um our founding Pastor didn't want me
[1:35:42] there at the at the meetings at the
[1:35:49] houses because he didn't
[1:35:52] want uh my pastor then Nick to think
[1:35:56] that he was proel
[1:36:06] liting anyhow after we left that prayer
[1:36:12] meeting my brother rush through the
[1:36:15] cigarett out the
[1:36:20] window
[1:36:21] and after that he never touched a
[1:36:25] cigarette or a
[1:36:30] beer he was delivered
[1:36:35] completely and I'm pretty sure our
[1:36:37] founding Pastor knew what was up that's
[1:36:39] why he invited
[1:36:45] us where we continued going with brother
[1:36:50] Nick
[1:36:52] Nick and um I we passed in front of a
[1:36:56] sword Tabernacle where they were
[1:37:04] meeting and uh sister Lucy told me I
[1:37:07] would honk at them and they would wave
[1:37:09] at
[1:37:15] me and she said you know
[1:37:18] what you know what brother Pettis said
[1:37:24] She's mine and she'll be here with us
[1:37:26] pretty
[1:37:28] soon and I said after she told me that I
[1:37:31] said okay I got some work to
[1:37:37] do so I made a meeting with brother
[1:37:41] Nick and I told him we're we're
[1:37:45] moving he says where are you
[1:37:49] going where I'm going to go to church
[1:37:53] with brother Tommy my
[1:38:00] brother and he said but why what have I
[1:38:03] done to hurt you or
[1:38:08] what I said nothing but I belong over
[1:38:14] there I said I belong with him because I
[1:38:17] am his
[1:38:20] sheep
[1:38:23] so he said okay I I hate to see you
[1:38:30] go but I you go with my
[1:38:34] blessings that was my pastor told me to
[1:38:37] do do it the right
[1:38:41] way anyhow we we went and we started we

[1:50:19] evening
[1:50:20] amen let us turn to our scripture really
[1:50:23] quick that way we are not standing so
[1:50:27] long Matthew
[1:50:32] 2717 maybe a little bit of a strange
[1:50:35] scripture for for such a time as
[1:50:40] this but hopefully the Lord willing that
[1:50:43] we can uh express to you the thought
[1:50:46] that the Lord has
[1:50:49] given
[1:50:52] and our pastor thank you for the the
[1:50:57] confidence H for the ministry thank
[1:51:01] you amen and it
[1:51:04] says therefore when they were gathered
[1:51:07] together isas said unto them whom will
[1:51:11] ye that I release unto you barabus or
[1:51:15] Jesus which is called
[1:51:18] Christ
[1:51:27] man you may be
[1:51:28] seated a little strange
[1:51:31] H amen I I really youth I really enjoy
[1:51:35] the
[1:51:38] drama you know that's one thing when I
[1:51:41] when I first read the uh the fox's book
[1:51:43] of
[1:51:46] martys FO yeah some sometimes you can't
[1:51:49] help but think man your your testimony
[1:51:51] is nothing compared to these
[1:51:56] brothers bet to
[1:51:58] Lions
[1:52:03] beheaded it was rough time that our
[1:52:06] brothers went
[1:52:08] through whom the world is not worthy
[1:52:12] amen but they overcame him by the blood
[1:52:14] of the
[1:52:16] Lamb word of their testimony amen you
[1:52:20] know I I the lord gave me this this
[1:52:22] quote right here from from brother
[1:52:24] Brandon I had no idea
[1:52:29] why I put it on
[1:52:31] there and as the drama's going forth and
[1:52:33] I'm hearing the hearing them talk here
[1:52:34] in the table I I understood
[1:52:38] why because a lot of times we think that
[1:52:41] right or am I the only one that that our
[1:52:44] testimony can't compare to
[1:52:48] that am I the only
[1:52:51] one no I have thought that I've read
[1:52:54] that book several times and it it hits
[1:52:55] me every time can't help but shed
[1:53:02] tears Now Youth are you taking
[1:53:06] notes now now we all know what over the
[1:53:10] what the meaning of to overcome means
[1:53:15] right to keep life in
[1:53:18] you with there's more to it than
[1:53:22] that brother brandham says here in the
[1:53:24] message how can I
[1:53:28] overcome he says overcome means to
[1:53:31] recognize the devil and every one of his
[1:53:38] tricks imagine that to overcome is to
[1:53:41] know the devil and every one of his
[1:53:45] tricks he goes on to say a lot of people
[1:53:48] say there is no devil
[1:53:53] it's just a
[1:53:54] thought don't you believe that there's a
[1:53:58] real
[1:53:59] devil he's just as real as you are or
[1:54:04] anybody a real
[1:54:06] devil and you must recognize
[1:54:10] him recognize him real you must know
[1:54:14] he's a
[1:54:15] devil then the same time that you
[1:54:17] recognize him
[1:54:20] and know that he's a
[1:54:22] devil and he's against you I like this
[1:54:25] part right
[1:54:26] here then here's the here's the another
[1:54:29] definition for you of the word
[1:54:32] overcome then to
[1:54:34] overcome you must recognize that God in
[1:54:38] you is greater and mightier than he
[1:54:45] is you're not acting like your God is
[1:54:47] your God is great and M come on
[1:54:51] now you're not acting like that are we
[1:54:55] defeated are are are do we think our
[1:54:58] testimony can't can't compare to these
[1:55:02] brothers our brothers our brother Steven
[1:55:05] how he was
[1:55:08] stoned the first
[1:55:10] martyr recognize the tricks that the
[1:55:13] devil pulls on
[1:55:15] us that is a trick that he uses all your
[1:55:18] testimony is nothing
[1:55:23] that is a trick that he uses pulls pulls
[1:55:25] on on
[1:55:27] us but you must recognize that God in
[1:55:30] you is greater and mightier than he
[1:55:35] is the one that's in you has already
[1:55:38] overcame
[1:55:41] him and Christ in you makes you an
[1:55:46] overcomer amen amen
[1:55:51] now for
[1:55:52] me now I want Ronnie of 2023 to
[1:55:58] die now I'm not just saying that because
[1:56:00] I'm up here it's the end of the year
[1:56:02] it's something good to
[1:56:05] say stimulate you a little bit kind of
[1:56:08] get you moving move the
[1:56:11] crowd no no no no I want Ronnie of 2023

[1:56:25] this because I want Ronnie of 2023 to
[1:56:30] die R Ronnie of 2023 he wasn't a good
[1:56:34] brother he wasn't a good guy Ronnie Was
[1:56:40] Defeated Ronnie was seeing things in a
[1:56:42] negative light that he shouldn't have
[1:56:44] been seeing things
[1:56:46] in can I get a witness
[1:56:51] that's
[1:56:52] Ronnie I want that Ronnie to
[1:56:58] die you're you're not going to hear no
[1:57:00] flow flowery message from me as you all

[1:57:07] die this nature of Ronnie the
[1:57:13] Gonzalez he's got to
[1:57:16] die okay your nature our natur has to
[1:57:23] die as I said I'm tired of seeing of
[1:57:25] things in a negative light all the
[1:57:29] time I don't I me I'm talking about
[1:57:32] myself I'm opening up my heart a little
[1:57:33] bit to you

[1:57:40] experience if I get up here and preach

[1:57:53] all the time they say oh brother Ronnie
[1:57:55] she there he goes saying he's nervous
[1:57:59] again it's a delicate thing to stand
[1:58:02] behind it makes me nervous because I
[1:58:04] handled the
[1:58:06] word not because I don't
[1:58:08] know because I don't want to purposely
[1:58:11] or maliciously lead somebody in a way
[1:58:13] they shouldn't shouldn't be
[1:58:17] led that is never an intent for a
[1:58:20] minister shouldn't be there should never
[1:58:23] be an intent of a
[1:58:26] minister I'm not trying to make myself

[1:58:44] way brother time we were talking to H I
[1:58:47] said I was going to mention this
[1:58:51] I'm tired of seeing the things as half
[1:58:57] full looking at the glass half
[1:59:01] full right because we have two
[1:59:03] perspectives
[1:59:04] right you can see it as half full or
[1:59:07] half
[1:59:09] empty I'm tired of seeing things half

[2:04:18] morning
[2:04:20] and we as we heard the prophet of
[2:04:23] God if we we're reading the scripture
[2:04:25] and we see something if we don't see
[2:04:27] Christ in that
[2:04:31] scripture we have to go

[2:04:36] back and and see if we can see Christ in
[2:04:37] it
[2:04:40] again there's nothing wrong with the
[2:04:44] scripture now if I don't see Christ in
[2:04:47] there there is something wrong with the
[2:04:48] way that I saw
[2:04:51] that maybe my interpretation of of what
[2:04:54] I think that is is
[2:04:57] wrong I must see Christ in every
[2:05:01] scripture now brother Noah raised his
[2:05:03] hand that he's the fourth
[2:05:06] Bible now when I read it the
[2:05:10] book I must see Christ in every
[2:05:16] scripture there's not something wrong
[2:05:18] with with the word of God as per
[2:05:23] se there's nothing wrong with the
[2:05:26] word now if I don't see Christ in the
[2:05:29] way I read the

[2:07:29] it you separated that
[2:07:32] scripture as we heard this
[2:07:34] morning
[2:07:36] now time's almost
[2:07:39] up okay going back to the
[2:07:46] scripture pilot said to the religious
[2:07:49] people of the
[2:07:51] day he
[2:07:53] says whom will
[2:07:57] ye that I release unto
[2:08:01] you
[2:08:03] barab or Jesus which is called the
[2:08:08] Christ now Christ is in us which is the
[2:08:12] hope of glory
[2:08:14] right amen amen now if I can't see
[2:08:18] Christ brother
[2:08:19] Noah but you know what but maybe God
[2:08:22] just maybe he did something to offend
[2:08:26] me maybe he did something to offend me
[2:08:30] now I'm reading that
[2:08:32] scripture with a hybrid
[2:08:36] condition oh God no no no no no brother

[2:08:59] know brother Ronnie has Christ brother
[2:09:01] no I
[2:09:03] don't no half
[2:09:11] empty what are we going to release in US
[2:09:13] is the power to to
[2:09:16] loose or in the power
[2:09:19] bind are you going to lose barabus which
[2:09:22] was a carnal
[2:09:24] man am I going to lose Noah the carinal
[2:09:28] man or I going to lose Noah which is
[2:09:32] called the
[2:09:34] Christ not that he's Christ no no no no
[2:09:38] no no no then it makes me it makes him
[2:09:40] an
[2:09:41] antichrist to say that Christ dwells on
[2:09:44] him now that's a different
[2:09:47] story who who will you

[2:10:23] I'm going end with this
[2:10:26] because whatsoever you lose will God
[2:10:33] lose don't be
[2:10:35] guilty of putting the lid on the jar
[2:10:38] brother
[2:10:39] will that was good I enjoyed
[2:10:42] that you don't know what I'm talking
[2:10:43] about go back and listen to brother
[2:10:44] William's
[2:10:46] message what we need what I need what
[2:10:48] Ronnie
[2:10:49] needs what Ronnie
[2:10:52] needs is this right here in the message
[2:10:55] evil Age golden
[2:11:01] age when the enemy comes in like a
[2:11:05] flood raise a standard against
[2:11:08] it why his word but I've read the seal
[2:11:14] books I've read all the Bible
[2:11:16] Lord I've read the Hebrews Lord and I'm
[2:11:20] still lacking still lacking
[2:11:23] Lord this is the standard that he is
[2:11:26] raising he is raising you and he is
[2:11:29] raising
[2:11:31] I you and I but you have to respect me
[2:11:37] and I have to respect
[2:11:39] you and when you and I get
[2:11:42] together that's the standard that God
[2:11:46] that's God's standard
[2:11:49] because without you and I God doesn't
[2:11:52] have a
[2:11:56] standard God doesn't have a
[2:11:59] standard he says are you with
[2:12:01] me can I get a
[2:12:05] witness and I'm GNA leave you with this

[2:12:30] has here to make
[2:12:33] it and outside of you and die there will
[2:12:38] be no Resurrection
[2:12:41] here so the standard has to be
[2:12:45] raised how is it by respecting one
[2:12:50] another if I did wrong forgive
[2:12:54] me am if you did wrong I forgive
[2:13:16] you

[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:22:03] [Applause]
[2:22:15] amen amen God bless brother Jim Virginia
[2:22:18] for that give another
[2:22:24] round stand if you
[2:22:29] would tur in your Bibles to the book of
[2:22:31] Philippians chapter
[2:22:37] 2 and if the if they would put that that
[2:22:40] same title what what think ye of
[2:22:45] Christ because I find I find in this in
[2:22:48] this title in this in this
[2:22:53] phrase I find that
[2:22:56] that we we we misunderstand a lot of
[2:23:00] times because when we hear the word
[2:23:04] [Music]
[2:23:07] think
[2:23:11] automatically we we go back to Webster's
[2:23:15] Dictionary weer and we make the
[2:23:19] assumption that when Jesus asks what
[2:23:22] think
[2:23:26] ye that he's looking for a thought in
[2:23:28] their
[2:23:31] brain that he that he wants to pick
[2:23:34] their brain for the
[2:23:40] thought book of Philippians chapter 2
[2:23:42] verse
[2:23:45] 5 and it says let this mind be in
[2:23:50] you which was also in Christ
[2:23:55] Jesus and if we go to Book of Proverbs
[2:23:58] chapter
[2:24:02] 23 we find out a detail here that only
[2:24:06] Believers
[2:24:10] know the Book of Proverbs chap 23:7
[2:24:13] tells
[2:24:16] us for as he thinketh in his
[2:24:23] heart so is
[2:24:25] he and may the Lord add his His
[2:24:27] blessings to the reading of the word and
[2:24:29] you may be
[2:24:34] seated you see when when when Jesus asks
[2:24:38] the
[2:24:40] disciples what think ye of
[2:24:45] Christ he wasn't looking for their
[2:24:49] brain many people think that we think in
[2:24:53] our
[2:24:55] brain and you know you realize that that
[2:24:58] is the greatest deception the devil has
[2:25:01] ever pulled
[2:25:04] over it is the root
[2:25:08] cause of all of the issues that we run
[2:25:11] into in our
[2:25:15] walk the greatest battle that's ever
[2:25:19] fought it's in the
[2:25:22] mind and it's
[2:25:24] because in the
[2:25:26] brain is where all information is
[2:25:32] stored
[2:25:34] Good the Bad and the Ugly it's all in
[2:25:39] the
[2:25:41] brain but it's not in the
[2:25:44] mind so when Jesus asked the
[2:25:48] disciples what think ye of
[2:25:52] Christ he wasn't looking in their
[2:25:56] brain he was looking for the mind that
[2:26:00] they should have
[2:26:03] had he was looking for his
[2:26:07] mind he wanted to
[2:26:09] see if they really
[2:26:13] knew that stood in front of
[2:26:15] them that stood in
[2:26:18] front could they identify
[2:26:21] him why because that mind that they
[2:26:25] should have
[2:26:28] had his
[2:26:30] mind it wasn't their own
[2:26:33] thought he wasn't looking for their own
[2:26:35] thought
[2:26:39] process you know I realized that when I
[2:26:41] was sitting back there in the
[2:26:45] back and I'm not throwing at
[2:26:48] anybody but this is why I say it's the
[2:26:51] greatest deception that devil has pulled
[2:26:53] over on
[2:26:57] us because when the minister asks the
[2:27:01] question who's the bride of
[2:27:04] Christ half of us
[2:27:10] go who's
[2:27:12] saved half of us
[2:27:15] go
[2:27:18] why because we're accessing the files in
[2:27:21] our
[2:27:26] brain because when we're thinking about
[2:27:29] the
[2:27:32] question we're thinking about
[2:27:34] it and we're referencing all the bad
[2:27:37] things that we've
[2:27:40] done we're looking at all the things
[2:27:42] that we messed
[2:27:45] up we're we're thinking about all the
[2:27:47] people that have offended
[2:27:50] us we're thinking about all the bad
[2:27:53] things that we've said and
[2:27:57] thought we're thinking about all the all
[2:27:59] the negative
[2:28:02] things and that brother
[2:28:05] Ronnie is why we get Negative
[2:28:10] Tendencies is because we process the
[2:28:14] questions from our brain
[2:28:18] but not from our
[2:28:20] mind and a Believer was never
[2:28:24] called to process
[2:28:27] things from your
[2:28:29] brain you were
[2:28:32] called to process
[2:28:35] things from the abundance of your
[2:28:38] heart that's where the mouth
[2:28:41] speaks you want positive things in your
[2:28:45] life you want positive
[2:28:48] things speak from the abundance of the
[2:28:52] heart from the abundance of your
[2:28:55] brain that's why the fight is always
[2:28:59] there because Satan's always trying to
[2:29:01] get
[2:29:03] you process it from your
[2:29:06] brain remember all the things that you
[2:29:09] did are you the bride of
[2:29:12] Christ and your brain registers I did
[2:29:14] this I did that I
[2:29:17] I could possibly be the bride of
[2:29:20] Christ but out of the abundance of the
[2:29:23] heart when the Mind
[2:29:27] speaks when the
[2:29:29] mind the Mind
[2:29:31] speaks from
[2:29:33] Christ and when the Mind
[2:29:36] speaks the brain speaks
[2:29:39] first remember what the brother did to
[2:29:43] you but then the Mind
[2:29:45] speaks oh but I forgive
[2:29:48] him remember what the sister did to
[2:29:51] you but then the
[2:29:54] mind oh but glory to God I forgive
[2:29:58] them remember what you did
[2:30:02] yesterday but then the
[2:30:05] Mind by his
[2:30:11] stripes when the brain
[2:30:14] speaks your daughters
[2:30:18] sick then the Mind
[2:30:22] speaks but he said she'd be
[2:30:28] healed when the brain
[2:30:30] speaks and it tells you you're not
[2:30:34] worthy remember that on that
[2:30:38] cross then the brain then the Mind
[2:30:41] speaks then the Mind
[2:30:44] speaks by his stripes
[2:30:47] he was wounded for your
[2:30:50] transgression when the brain speaks
[2:30:52] remember all the bad things that you
[2:30:57] did the Mind
[2:30:59] speaks but he was wounded for my
[2:31:03] iniquity by his
[2:31:06] St I am
[2:31:09] healed because until we can
[2:31:12] speak until we can
[2:31:15] process the
[2:31:17] revelation of what think ye of
[2:31:21] Christ from the
[2:31:23] mind will never be able to
[2:31:27] come to the full
[2:31:31] realization of the
[2:31:34] answer because it's not
[2:31:37] here it's not up
[2:31:40] here it's
[2:31:42] here so when the minister
[2:31:45] asks
[2:31:47] are you the Bride of Jesus
[2:31:49] Christ don't process it
[2:31:52] here process it
[2:31:54] here let here speak
[2:31:57] forth what think you of Christ in your
[2:32:01] mind not in your in your
[2:32:09] brain I never understood brother
[2:32:11] branham's
[2:32:15] statement when he that he makes in the
[2:32:17] 70 weeks of
[2:32:20] Daniel and he says there'll be a famine
[2:32:22] for spiritual
[2:32:26] food and I always thought that maybe we
[2:32:29] should be like a
[2:32:33] prepper the ones that prepare a
[2:32:36] lot that maybe we should just store up
[2:32:39] all the books and all the
[2:32:43] tapes and that's good there's nothing
[2:32:45] wrong with that
[2:32:48] but then I hear the
[2:32:51] chief oh thank God for that
[2:32:54] man then I hear the
[2:32:57] chief and he
[2:32:59] says it's not that you need all the
[2:33:02] books and the
[2:33:04] tapes that's not
[2:33:07] enough all the books and the
[2:33:10] tapes you got to store them in your
[2:33:15] computer you got to take them all into
[2:33:18] your
[2:33:19] mind that's why it's so important and I
[2:33:22] understand
[2:33:24] that when you read the
[2:33:27] word you hear the
[2:33:29] word pay
[2:33:31] attention don't be doing other
[2:33:34] things because you have to record it in
[2:33:37] your
[2:33:39] mind it has to override all the
[2:33:45] negativity
[2:33:46] and when you begin to fill up the files
[2:33:49] in your
[2:33:51] brain then my little boy asked me a
[2:33:54] question this
[2:33:56] morning he said Dad how does a minister
[2:34:00] get himself out of the
[2:34:03] way and it took me a
[2:34:06] minute because I couldn't explain
[2:34:09] it but all of a
[2:34:11] sudden I remembered what the chief
[2:34:14] said it's when you get the
[2:34:19] mind when a minister speaks from the
[2:34:23] mind not the
[2:34:25] brain when he speaks from the
[2:34:28] mind then the anointing of
[2:34:31] Christ begins to access the files that
[2:34:34] are St in the
[2:34:36] [Applause]
[2:34:37] bra he begins to take
[2:34:41] control it's no longer your
[2:34:45] words just accessing your
[2:34:49] file he's assembling it and putting it
[2:34:54] together so when we go out and we
[2:34:56] witness to
[2:35:00] people the Bible says don't worry about
[2:35:02] what you'll
[2:35:05] say why because the
[2:35:09] files should be
[2:35:11] here so that
[2:35:14] Christ can access what's
[2:35:18] inside he'll assemble the
[2:35:21] words he'll put it
[2:35:25] together what think you of
[2:35:28] Christ not in your
[2:35:30] brain don't think Christ in your
[2:35:35] brain think
[2:35:38] Christ using that
[2:35:41] mind and when you
[2:35:43] do you will begin to act answer every
[2:35:49] question with such
[2:35:53] Aur that no demon in hell will move
[2:35:58] you because it's no longer I that
[2:36:03] liveth it's no longer I that
[2:36:07] think no longer I that
[2:36:11] speak it's no longer I that
[2:36:14] walkth no long I
[2:36:18] thatth no longer I that
[2:36:21] worship it is
[2:36:23] Christ in me in me the hope of
[2:36:28] glory god bless
[2:36:31] [Applause]
[2:36:43] you Hallelujah

[2:40:12] no let me make a small correction
[2:40:17] brother Diego does not have a

[2:40:28] promise you know what cancer
[2:40:32] means cancer means
[2:40:35] death you know how cancer
[2:40:38] is the Lord showed
[2:40:40] me it is a dark
[2:40:43] shadow brother BR was
[2:40:46] sister there's a a dark shadow around
[2:40:49] around you you have
[2:40:55] cancer and cancer means
[2:41:00] death and I have news for for this
[2:41:04] cancer because the Bible tells
[2:41:07] me of one that said oh death canc oh
[2:41:13] cancer oh death
[2:41:16] I will be your
[2:41:18] death why I speak this
[2:41:21] way because I'm not
[2:41:23] afraid and if someone has
[2:41:26] cancer someone has a sickness let me
[2:41:29] tell
[2:41:31] you I understand
[2:41:34] you but I believe in
[2:41:36] him that said one
[2:41:39] day I
[2:41:41] am the
[2:41:43] resurrection and the life
[2:41:47] if we open the scripture R in
[2:41:52] Romans chapter
[2:42:01] 5:3 and the scripture
[2:42:06] says Apostle Paul chapter 5 verse3 in
[2:42:11] Romans here you'll understand my
[2:42:14] craziness
[2:42:18] says and not only
[2:42:24] so but we glory in the good times no no
[2:42:28] no
[2:42:32] no we Glory when everything is
[2:42:36] good no here's the Apostle
[2:42:39] Paul we
[2:42:42] Glory let me let me say something
[2:42:46] I will speak as a
[2:42:50] missionary do you not believe I'm a
[2:42:55] missionary I I know you you seem a
[2:42:59] bit but I'll say for the first
[2:43:04] time because I want you to understand
[2:43:06] this
[2:43:07] point I am also a
[2:43:12] missionary and when the team from here
[2:43:14] goes I
[2:43:17] even I'm the first one that
[2:43:20] goes let me tell
[2:43:23] you I could glory in that no
[2:43:28] no C can can a
[2:43:31] sheep glory in himself and
[2:43:35] say oh look at my
[2:43:38] wall what a beautiful wall no
[2:43:43] no that is his nature
[2:43:48] we can't Glory ourselves in those things
[2:43:51] but as a
[2:43:52] Christian there's one
[2:43:55] thing that we can glory
[2:43:57] in and that's in Tri in the
[2:44:01] problem
[2:44:03] difficulties because that's where where
[2:44:06] we can
[2:44:08] glory and
[2:44:10] see the hand of
[2:44:14] God
[2:44:16] that's the
[2:44:18] trial when
[2:44:20] dieo or when no can tell
[2:44:24] God how much I love
[2:44:27] him how much I need
[2:44:31] him the trial does not change
[2:44:35] anything but also the
[2:44:38] trial it helps
[2:44:40] me to prove to
[2:44:43] Satan who I'm
[2:44:46] on brother Branham
[2:44:49] said if
[2:44:53] Satan through the through through
[2:44:55] through the law of
[2:44:59] sin can can can put a
[2:45:02] Cancer and
[2:45:06] man recognizes it and accepts
[2:45:12] it he he didn't get it
[2:45:16] listen here's the
[2:45:19] key
[2:45:21] Satan through the law of
[2:45:24] sin he can put a
[2:45:27] Cancer and
[2:45:30] man
[2:45:32] recognizes and accepts
[2:45:35] it that is why
[2:45:39] Satan sent me a
[2:45:42] letter a
[2:45:43] cancer uh my friend Diego forgive me but
[2:45:49] that letter is not for
[2:45:51] me I don't recognize it I don't accept
[2:45:56] it
[2:45:58] Satan through the law of
[2:46:01] sin he can do these
[2:46:04] disgraces how much
[2:46:06] more
[2:46:08] Christ dwells in
[2:46:12] us who
[2:46:14] died
[2:46:16] when Jesus was
[2:46:19] here he showed his
[2:46:22] power Jesus said I have
[2:46:24] power to lay down my
[2:46:27] life and I have power to take it up
[2:46:30] again when Jesus came he cast out demons
[2:46:35] when Jesus came he healed the
[2:46:38] sick now I
[2:46:40] asked when Jesus dies on the
[2:46:43] cross what happened with that that
[2:46:46] power where is that
[2:46:49] power did that power go
[2:46:51] away let me help you Jesus said
[2:46:57] now all
[2:47:00] power all
[2:47:02] power not
[2:47:04] only did he had the
[2:47:08] power receed more
[2:47:10] power brother brandham
[2:47:12] said he received more power
[2:47:16] and where is that
[2:47:18] power everything that was in
[2:47:21] God he pour into
[2:47:25] Christ and where is that power
[2:47:28] now everything that was in
[2:47:30] Christ he put it he P it he pour it here
[2:47:37] that's why can
[2:47:39] cancer I am your
[2:47:43] cancer
[2:47:47] the word
[2:47:50] chaos it's it's the worst
[2:47:52] definition we
[2:47:56] say oh it went out of
[2:48:00] control this happened this happened and
[2:48:02] that
[2:48:04] happened and it was a
[2:48:07] chaos as an expression to
[2:48:10] say no one had
[2:48:13] control the Bible tells me
[2:48:16] of a
[2:48:18] place where there was a
[2:48:24] chaos there is no way for man to
[2:48:28] be a region called
[2:48:32] Gad that region was
[2:48:34] famous because one
[2:48:37] man that had a
[2:48:41] legion more than 6,000 demons
[2:48:45] this region was it was
[2:48:53] crazy the these this man would go where
[2:48:55] they were
[2:48:57] cultivating and the people would run
[2:49:00] they would find it
[2:49:02] destroyed this man was a
[2:49:07] chaos his Fame it had gone
[2:49:11] out nobody wanted to go to gader
[2:49:15] and everybody knew what happened in
[2:49:17] there in
[2:49:18] gadera
[2:49:21] Satan through 6,000
[2:49:24] demons had placed a
[2:49:27] chaos the word
[2:49:30] demon it means
[2:49:32] Tormentor it was a
[2:49:35] chaos but here comes a
[2:49:38] man that gets down
[2:49:40] from the first thing that
[2:49:42] happens this demon
[2:49:45] this
[2:49:46] man the scripture
[2:49:49] says these demons they cried out and
[2:49:54] they
[2:49:56] said Jesus why have you
[2:49:59] come son of the
[2:50:02] almighty to to torment
[2:50:05] us just wait wait a
[2:50:09] moment there was a
[2:50:11] chaos but here comes a man who is the
[2:50:15] chaos to the
[2:50:17] chaos yes brother
[2:50:21] Jesus you come to torment us oh

[2:50:39] economy it's time to look
[2:50:43] back begin to

[3:02:43] for
[3:02:45] forward how can we not be
[3:02:48] grateful if you are
[3:02:52] sick after you have seen God

[3:02:59] sick believe

[3:03:07] word may the Lord bless
[3:03:10] you it was the best year God bless
[3:03:14] [Applause]
[3:03:27] you what a time we've
[3:03:32] had I want us
[3:03:34] to I thank the the ministers this this
[3:03:40] today and I am grateful for the their
[3:03:45] lives grateful for each one that
[3:03:49] that has taken a part today and
[3:03:52] throughout the
[3:03:55] year I'm grateful to our pastor for what
[3:03:59] he means to
[3:04:02] us and um as we draw uh at the end of
[3:04:07] this
[3:04:10] time and enter into the new new new time
[3:04:15] uh Joshua would tell the
[3:04:19] people uh follow the
[3:04:23] ark because you haven't been by this way
[3:04:27] before and so as we we go into new
[3:04:32] territory and we go into the newness of
[3:04:37] life we we want to go in with full
[3:04:40] assuredness of
[3:04:42] faith
[3:04:44] that he which started good work in
[3:04:47] us will finish
[3:04:50] it and I uh am grateful
[3:04:56] tonight for the
[3:04:59] opportunity that he has given
[3:05:01] us I don't want us to to have go into
[3:05:07] this year
[3:05:12] haphazardly
[3:05:14] but we go in with full
[3:05:17] vision and uh I appreciate the word of
[3:05:20] God so much this
[3:05:23] morning and I I thank God every day I
[3:05:27] I've I've learned so much through the
[3:05:29] ministry of of of our
[3:05:35] pastor I'm
[3:05:38] um a person that that has probably been
[3:05:43] caught or in a bridge between
[3:05:50] two um at uh a character I'm a
[3:05:57] revolutionary um but in in in
[3:06:02] position we've got to make
[3:06:05] sure that there is an establishment of
[3:06:08] the
[3:06:10] Kingdom we cannot be
[3:06:13] as Paul says one that beateth the
[3:06:19] air every every every blow we
[3:06:26] throw has got to hit the
[3:06:29] mark we we cannot be pcha
[3:06:35] style we have to be the third part of
[3:06:38] Christ the
[3:06:41] mystery to restore rest the
[3:06:44] kingdom and as we draw an eye to
[3:06:48] this we must draw an eye with full
[3:06:51] assuredness of
[3:06:54] Faith Jesus in the 16th chapter of the
[3:06:58] book of St John says
[3:07:02] this in the world you will have
[3:07:09] tribulation but be of good
[3:07:12] cheer
[3:07:13] I have overcome the
[3:07:15] world if I can can can leave you with
[3:07:18] some thoughts
[3:07:22] tonight I want to leave you with uh some
[3:07:26] encouragement the encouragement uh uh of
[3:07:29] uh of that what we will be
[3:07:34] facing this year was uh in one way was a
[3:07:38] was a difficult
[3:07:41] year but in in uh the most glorious of
[3:07:45] all the
[3:07:48] years because we understand the
[3:07:50] scripture
[3:07:52] says that that the sufferings of this
[3:07:55] present
[3:07:58] world are not worthy to be compared with
[3:08:01] the glory which shall be revealed in
[3:08:04] us so whatever sufferings we may have
[3:08:07] gone
[3:08:10] through they are not the equal of the
[3:08:12] glory that God wants to reveal in
[3:08:16] us because the glory of the latter house
[3:08:20] is more glorious than the glory of the
[3:08:22] former
[3:08:26] [Music]
[3:08:30] house and so we we
[3:08:33] understand through all our ups and our
[3:08:38] Downs that it all depends on our
[3:08:42] attitude
[3:08:43] and I've learned this so much from our
[3:08:45] our
[3:08:47] pastor of how to keep our
[3:08:51] attitude I I I want to more than ever
[3:08:56] before as we see the lights of that City
[3:08:59] coming towards
[3:09:02] us and as we're going to that
[3:09:06] City I want us to understand
[3:09:10] this that we as as a
[3:09:13] people have got to make the clearcut
[3:09:20] decisions as for me and my
[3:09:24] house we will serve the
[3:09:27] Lord and as we draw nigh to two
[3:09:32] 2024 again may we draw nigh with auress
[3:09:36] of
[3:09:38] faith of
[3:09:40] attitude what is our attitude
[3:09:43] I appreciate all the messages that were
[3:09:45] spoken
[3:09:47] tonight and what more could we
[3:09:51] say than what has already been
[3:09:54] said but I want us to check our
[3:09:58] attitude I need to check my attitude
[3:10:01] every
[3:10:02] day am I a person of a
[3:10:07] negative or will I be a positive
[3:10:11] person not posit and only
[3:10:15] Doctrine but bringing the word of God to
[3:10:18] pass in my
[3:10:21] generation but it starts off with our my
[3:10:26] attitude and I want to read this for you
[3:10:28] a little
[3:10:30] bit in part of this country in the
[3:10:37] 1980s when the Wolves were in danger of
[3:10:41] extinction
[3:10:44] there was a special Bounty offered for
[3:10:47] wolves caught
[3:10:52] alive each live wolf brought into
[3:10:56] captivity would bring
[3:11:01] $5,000 that turned two
[3:11:05] men Sam and Jad into Fortune Hunters Sam
[3:11:09] and
[3:11:11] jam they headed for the
[3:11:15] forest day and
[3:11:17] night they looked for their
[3:11:19] $5,000
[3:11:22] wolf but they couldn't find
[3:11:25] him it was
[3:11:27] hopeless one night as they camped in a
[3:11:32] clearing Sam awoke to find more than 50
[3:11:36] wolves surrounding the
[3:11:41] camp their eyes were
[3:11:44] flaming and their teeth were
[3:11:48] Beed he nudged his friend and
[3:11:52] said Jed wake
[3:11:55] up we're
[3:11:57] rich that's a pretty good
[3:12:01] attitude or what of the two men who were
[3:12:04] sent by a shoe manufacturer to a remote
[3:12:11] country
[3:12:14] to sell
[3:12:15] shoes one wrote back I have terrible
[3:12:20] news this is a god forsaken
[3:12:25] country nobody here wears
[3:12:28] shoes I'm coming home the other man
[3:12:33] wrote this is a wonderful
[3:12:36] country I am so grateful you sent me to
[3:12:40] this
[3:12:41] territory
[3:12:43] nobody here wears
[3:12:46] shoes send me 5,000
[3:12:50] pairs what about the
[3:12:52] day when attitude won't carry the
[3:12:57] day what about our
[3:13:01] circumstances what about Paul and
[3:13:04] Silas cast into
[3:13:08] prison and you would just be crying to
[3:13:11] the Lord
[3:13:13] you would think we would be crying to
[3:13:15] the
[3:13:17] Lord Lord I am in
[3:13:20] prison but at
[3:13:22] midnight they started singing a
[3:13:26] song they started saying
[3:13:29] hallelujah they started praising the
[3:13:32] Lord they started giving him
[3:13:35] honor giving him
[3:13:38] glory and the prison chain started
[3:13:41] breaking
[3:13:43] you know why it is by
[3:13:46] attitude that we serve
[3:13:49] God what does he call us
[3:13:52] for why does he call us
[3:13:55] for he calls us to be a special
[3:13:59] people he calls us to be a royal
[3:14:04] priesthood he calls us to be a new
[3:14:07] generation so when St Matthew tells
[3:14:11] us barely barely I say unto
[3:14:15] you this
[3:14:17] generation shall not pass till all these
[3:14:21] things be
[3:14:23] fulfilled what he's talking about he's
[3:14:26] talking about this
[3:14:28] race he's talking about this
[3:14:31] kind he's talking about this
[3:14:34] family he's talking about this
[3:14:37] St he talking about this breed of
[3:14:41] people never passed away until the
[3:14:47] purpose of God would be fulfilled in
[3:14:49] their
[3:14:52] life The
[3:14:54] Rock The
[3:14:58] Rock there is a
[3:15:01] rock a distracted man tripped over
[3:15:07] it a violent man used the rock as a
[3:15:11] weapon
[3:15:14] an industrious man built a house with
[3:15:19] it a tired farmer sat and rested on the
[3:15:27] Rock but David used it to beat
[3:15:33] Goliath Michel Angelo used it to create
[3:15:36] a
[3:15:39] masterpiece all these men had the same
[3:15:41] thing a
[3:15:44] rock but how it was
[3:15:46] used was up to each
[3:15:50] individual you can have the revelation
[3:15:52] of the
[3:15:54] hour but how you use that
[3:15:58] revelation will determine upon your
[3:16:02] year likewise this new year will be the
[3:16:05] same
[3:16:08] year that everyone is
[3:16:11] granted what we do with
[3:16:14] it is what will make the
[3:16:18] difference what does he call us
[3:16:21] to he calls us to a New
[3:16:24] Creation he calls us to a new a a new
[3:16:28] life he calls us and he says now this is
[3:16:32] my
[3:16:33] creation this is what I have
[3:16:36] created but now he is standing in the
[3:16:39] midst of the
[3:16:41] church
[3:16:43] stands there revealing who he is in this
[3:16:47] last
[3:16:49] day self the author of the creation of
[3:16:54] God this is another
[3:16:57] creation this has to do with the
[3:17:00] church this is a special special
[3:17:04] designation of
[3:17:07] himself he is the creator of that
[3:17:11] church knowing if he is the creator of
[3:17:14] that
[3:17:16] church then we understand
[3:17:18] this I love when my papa would tell us
[3:17:22] this we are the best of
[3:17:26] God we are the best of
[3:17:29] God we are the best of God he said again
[3:17:34] tell your neighbor I am the best of God
[3:17:38] you are the best of God you are the best
[3:17:41] that God has
[3:17:43] you are the best that God has in this
[3:17:48] world this is my
[3:17:51] papa as everyone has
[3:17:53] said we miss him so
[3:17:59] much you
[3:18:02] know he gave us and he said
[3:18:06] this this is the best of
[3:18:09] God not the best of me
[3:18:13] the best of
[3:18:14] God this is the best that God has to
[3:18:17] offer
[3:18:19] you he
[3:18:20] says why did you turn that water into
[3:18:26] wine do you know that they keep the best
[3:18:29] for
[3:18:30] last was that do you know that they keep
[3:18:33] the best for
[3:18:36] last and this is the
[3:18:38] best it's the best wine you can
[3:18:43] find because it's the only
[3:18:47] wine that can give you the stimulation
[3:18:50] of
[3:18:52] Revelation nothing stimulates us like
[3:18:55] the real
[3:18:58] wine this is the wine you can get high
[3:19:03] on this wine it's good stuff you know
[3:19:08] they
[3:19:09] say the wine the older it
[3:19:13] gets the better do you know do you know
[3:19:18] how long God has stored this
[3:19:22] wine God has stored it for thousands of
[3:19:27] years in this church
[3:19:29] age in this time he pulled out the
[3:19:37] car he reserved it for
[3:19:41] you for me take this
[3:19:45] wine take this cup drink it for this is
[3:19:50] my
[3:19:59] blood do not fear he says this not
[3:20:03] demise I am with
[3:20:05] you do not be
[3:20:08] dismayed for I am your God
[3:20:12] I will strengthen and help
[3:20:15] you I will uphold you with my righteous
[3:20:19] right
[3:20:22] hand do you know how many people depend
[3:20:24] on
[3:20:27] you around the
[3:20:30] world they know who you
[3:20:34] are they know your
[3:20:37] names they know where you
[3:20:40] stand they know how you you
[3:20:43] worship they call me and they
[3:20:46] say where is that person that
[3:20:49] worships where is so and so I don't see
[3:20:52] him no more in the
[3:20:55] video or them I don't see them no
[3:20:59] more they know who you
[3:21:01] are they know your
[3:21:03] light they know your
[3:21:05] Fame they know your
[3:21:08] stance they know your position
[3:21:12] Philippians tells
[3:21:13] us do not be anxious about
[3:21:17] anything but in every
[3:21:20] situation by prayer and
[3:21:23] petition with
[3:21:25] Thanksgiving present your request to
[3:21:29] God and the peace of God which
[3:21:32] transcends all
[3:21:35] understanding guard your
[3:21:37] hearts your mind Christ Jes
[3:21:42] I never want us to make this
[3:21:46] common I never want us to think that
[3:21:49] this happens
[3:21:52] everywhere what you've seen our young
[3:21:54] people do
[3:21:56] today last week when you seen our
[3:21:59] children do
[3:22:01] here can I tell you something about the
[3:22:04] teachers of the of our little
[3:22:08] children one of the little children
[3:22:12] that had only been coming to church a
[3:22:14] couple of
[3:22:17] times she happened to go to a a family
[3:22:22] outing and she says we cannot we cannot
[3:22:25] eat till we
[3:22:29] pray and she didn't let them eat until
[3:22:32] they
[3:22:33] prayed know what the people of that
[3:22:36] place
[3:22:37] said those people in that church are the
[3:22:40] real thing
[3:22:44] that is a
[3:22:46] testament of what God has done in your
[3:22:50] life without us really realizing the
[3:22:54] effect that we have
[3:22:58] worldwide Matthew tells us so don't
[3:23:02] worry what shall we
[3:23:05] eat or what shall we
[3:23:07] drink or what shall we
[3:23:10] wear for the pagans run after these
[3:23:15] things and your heavenly father knows
[3:23:18] what you need
[3:23:21] them seek ye first the
[3:23:24] kingdom and his
[3:23:26] righteousness and all these things will
[3:23:29] be given to you as
[3:23:31] well therefore do not worry about
[3:23:36] tomorrow tomorrow will worry about
[3:23:40] itself each day has enough trouble of
[3:23:44] its
[3:23:47] own but Solomon tells
[3:23:50] us trust in the
[3:23:53] Lord with all your
[3:23:56] heart and lean not unto your own
[3:24:00] understanding all your ways acknowledge
[3:24:03] Him and He will straight your
[3:24:06] path and Paul captures that
[3:24:10] revelation and he says this may the god
[3:24:14] of Hope fill you with all
[3:24:17] joy and peace as you trust in
[3:24:21] him so that you may overflow with
[3:24:25] hope by the power of the Holy
[3:24:29] Spirit Solomon goes back and
[3:24:33] says my
[3:24:35] people which are called by my
[3:24:38] name humble themselves
[3:24:42] pray and seek my face and turn from
[3:24:46] their wicked
[3:24:48] ways I will hear from
[3:24:50] heaven will forgive their
[3:24:53] sin heal their
[3:24:57] land when we do
[3:25:00] that this is what I want is hearing the
[3:25:04] ministers
[3:25:07] tonight I don't want to say it's I or we
[3:25:11] or us did
[3:25:14] it that's when we did when we were in
[3:25:19] infancy but now as we become
[3:25:24] older When We Were Young when I was
[3:25:26] young I did as I wanted
[3:25:29] to but when I became an old
[3:25:33] man when I became an older
[3:25:36] man someone else tied my
[3:25:40] waist
[3:25:42] somebody else told me what to
[3:25:45] do somebody else told us let's go to
[3:25:50] Colombia somebody else told us let's go
[3:25:52] to
[3:25:54] Poland somebody else told us let go to
[3:25:58] UGA somebody said let's light the world
[3:26:02] on
[3:26:04] fire know why the revelation of the hour
[3:26:09] is not just to anybody
[3:26:12] to the new
[3:26:14] race this is a super
[3:26:17] race this is a super
[3:26:20] creation because it is God in his
[3:26:27] creation why we look at at at
[3:26:32] ourselves I look and I
[3:26:35] see can
[3:26:38] we at this point
[3:26:43] reach to what we H we have to
[3:26:48] reach I was driving the other day on on
[3:26:57] 70
[3:27:00] I have never considered myself that I'm
[3:27:04] a missionary or a or anything of that
[3:27:07] nature of a
[3:27:10] title
[3:27:12] or any title that there
[3:27:14] is when somebody asks me what are
[3:27:18] you I am a
[3:27:22] help I looked at my papa I helped
[3:27:28] him and I helped him according to what
[3:27:32] he and I tried to be as faithful as I
[3:27:38] could when the time came that he could
[3:27:41] no longer do the
[3:27:47] daytoday and we there was we we we we
[3:27:51] went to the what was God
[3:27:56] called and what God had instituted and
[3:27:59] placed in this
[3:28:03] church the foundation of this
[3:28:06] church is
[3:28:09] sure sure
[3:28:11] there's no other Foundation that can be
[3:28:14] laid that's what's already been
[3:28:19] laid the foundation is
[3:28:22] laid this is an established
[3:28:30] headquarters and I and and as as as as
[3:28:34] we went through our
[3:28:37] process I told our pastor as I was with
[3:28:40] my papey will be with
[3:28:44] you and I've tried to be as faithful as
[3:28:47] I
[3:28:49] could even if I even if I don't feel to
[3:28:55] go I go
[3:28:58] anyway because I know that what God is
[3:29:02] obligated to is
[3:29:05] this he's not obligated to
[3:29:08] me but he is obligated to his
[3:29:13] and this word has been established
[3:29:16] here we don't look anywhere else for any
[3:29:20] word the word has already been founded
[3:29:24] in our
[3:29:25] heart already sealed with the Holy
[3:29:29] Ghost and it is not sinking
[3:29:34] sand is the rock of eternal
[3:29:38] life eternal salvation
[3:29:44] as I'm driving on
[3:29:47] 70 after doing missionary work for 35
[3:29:55] years I'm
[3:29:59] driving and I
[3:30:02] hear the Lord
[3:30:05] say for me say to
[3:30:08] God I finally felt what my papa
[3:30:20] felt and I ask myself the
[3:30:25] question what I what are you doing
[3:30:29] here what am I doing
[3:30:31] here should be out
[3:30:34] there I should be out there helping
[3:30:38] people and I don't want cedar heels to
[3:30:41] get to the place of
[3:30:46] jealousy where they think when we we're
[3:30:48] going out that we don't
[3:30:52] care oh we go out because we do
[3:30:56] care and we leave you in very capable
[3:31:01] hands we never leave you as
[3:31:04] orphans and our heart is to be
[3:31:08] here but our heart is to be out
[3:31:12] there where they've never heard one
[3:31:15] time they've never heard the name of
[3:31:19] Jesus much less the name of William
[3:31:22] brandham William Bram but in this new
[3:31:26] creation it causes a chain
[3:31:31] reaction and it causes us to take the
[3:31:35] Great
[3:31:37] Commission into all the
[3:31:39] world the
[3:31:48] gopel when we do
[3:31:51] that I tell Mya
[3:31:55] this I feel my papa more in the mission
[3:31:58] field than I do anywhere
[3:32:03] else because that's where his heart was
[3:32:08] at we as people of
[3:32:13] Promise must got to understand
[3:32:16] this I I'll leave you with
[3:32:19] this when those who are called to fish
[3:32:22] don't
[3:32:25] fish they
[3:32:27] fight when energy intended to be used
[3:32:30] outside is used
[3:32:36] inside the result is
[3:32:39] explosive instead of casting
[3:32:44] Nets we cast
[3:32:47] stones instead of extending Helping
[3:32:52] Hands we point
[3:32:55] fingers instead of being Fishers of the
[3:33:00] Lost we become critics of the
[3:33:04] saved instead of helping the
[3:33:09] hurting we hurt the
[3:33:13] helpers the
[3:33:15] result church
[3:33:39] scrooges this this is what captured she
[3:33:43] the queen of sheba's
[3:33:48] attention she saw Solomon in his in his
[3:33:54] in his
[3:33:56] throne the Bible says that the
[3:34:00] streets were lined with bars of
[3:34:06] silver and when she saw the wisdom of
[3:34:09] Solomon
[3:34:13] she was so OD by that
[3:34:17] wisdom but that's not the only thing
[3:34:21] that captured her
[3:34:24] attention she says your
[3:34:28] servants are so happy when they serve
[3:34:34] you we're having another church
[3:34:38] service wow we have prayer meeting on on
[3:34:42] Saturday
[3:34:45] wow we have church service on Sunday
[3:34:47] morning now they want to have one on
[3:34:50] satday
[3:34:52] night oh that's too much but your
[3:34:55] servant she
[3:34:57] said we're so happy to
[3:35:00] serve this is the attitude that we must
[3:35:05] have when we that are called to fight
[3:35:08] the
[3:35:09] enemy
[3:35:11] start fighting each
[3:35:13] other because we are the best fighters
[3:35:16] in the
[3:35:19] world and we come to
[3:35:21] church ah the bunks are too
[3:35:24] hard ah the pews they're so they're
[3:35:28] they're they're too
[3:35:30] hard oh the song worship was too
[3:35:34] long first service was why was too
[3:35:38] long and then we have to go visit the
[3:35:42] brothers can you
[3:35:44] imagine if Jesus
[3:35:47] Christ he's on the cross and instead of
[3:35:51] saying I didn't have to come
[3:35:54] here not my will but thy will be
[3:35:58] done but he opened up his
[3:36:01] arms and he said this is how much I love
[3:36:06] you he got a hold of the cross
[3:36:11] for you and me and it became a
[3:36:16] joy lay down his
[3:36:20] life at that moment of
[3:36:24] suffering when he couldn't get when his
[3:36:26] body it seemed could not take it
[3:36:30] anymore and the Bible
[3:36:33] says that drops of sweat like
[3:36:37] blood what had happened he died of a
[3:36:41] broken
[3:36:45] heart his his heart had torn in
[3:36:50] two and when he couldn't no
[3:36:53] more he started looking in
[3:36:57] time and when he looked down the
[3:37:00] corridor of
[3:37:02] time saw
[3:37:04] you
[3:37:06] you stand you stand
[3:37:13] cuz he knew without
[3:37:16] you you would only see to the
[3:37:20] Cross to the
[3:37:22] suffering but he
[3:37:24] knew that we wouldn't just see to the
[3:37:28] Cross we would see through the
[3:37:32] cross on the other
[3:37:35] side the
[3:37:39] resurrection
[3:37:41] no wonder he
[3:37:43] says I
[3:37:45] am don't look for it anywhere
[3:37:48] else I am the resurrection and the
[3:37:52] life you might be tired right
[3:37:55] now because it's almost
[3:37:58] midnight but let me tell you if you can
[3:38:02] just go a little bit
[3:38:08] farther without the holy
[3:38:11] ghost without the Holy
[3:38:14] Ghost the Bible
[3:38:16] says David encouraged
[3:38:22] himself he didn't need for Tommy Jr to
[3:38:25] preach him a
[3:38:28] message he might have felt
[3:38:31] down he knew the Lord is my
[3:38:36] shepherd not
[3:38:38] want encour en himself in the
[3:38:43] Lord when you feel
[3:38:46] down when you look
[3:38:49] at men of
[3:38:53] renowned men in our
[3:38:55] time we have been blessed by
[3:38:58] God to live in the apostles
[3:39:06] generation what you are receiving now
[3:39:10] is the apostles
[3:39:16] rain and that's what we are looking
[3:39:22] at searching for RO for warts on an on
[3:39:28] others while ignoring the warts on our
[3:39:33] nose crooked
[3:39:36] fingers that bypass
[3:39:39] strength
[3:39:40] and point out
[3:39:43] weaknesses poor
[3:39:45] testimonies broken
[3:39:48] hearts legalistic
[3:39:51] Wars and sadly the poor go
[3:39:56] unfed confused go uncounseled
[3:40:01] confused go uncounseled
[3:40:04] and the loss go
[3:40:08] unreached when those who are called to
[3:40:10] fish don't
[3:40:15] fish they
[3:40:17] fight but when those who are called to
[3:40:22] fish
[3:40:25] fish they
[3:40:27] flourish an afternoon
[3:40:32] project an afternoon service
[3:40:36] project a visit to the
[3:40:39] hospital God bless you my
[3:40:41] brother I just came to see how

[3:59:37] I
[3:59:42] [Music]
[4:00:07] for I have re received of the Lord that
[4:00:10] which also I delivered unto you that the
[4:00:13] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[4:00:15] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[4:00:18] given thanks he break it and said take
[4:00:22] eat this is my body which is broken for
[4:00:25] you this do in remembrance of
[4:00:28] me after the same manner also he took
[4:00:31] the cup when he had SED
[4:00:34] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[4:00:37] my blood this do ye as of as you drink
[4:00:41] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[4:00:45] you eat this bread and drink this cup it
[4:00:49] he show the Lord's death till he come
[4:00:52] where so wherefore whosoever shall eat
[4:00:55] this bread and drink this cup of the
[4:00:57] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[4:01:00] body and the blood of the Lord but let a
[4:01:04] man examine himself and so let him eat
[4:01:07] of that bread and drink drink of that
[4:01:09] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[4:01:11] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[4:01:14] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[4:01:17] body for this cause many are weak and
[4:01:20] sickly among you and many
