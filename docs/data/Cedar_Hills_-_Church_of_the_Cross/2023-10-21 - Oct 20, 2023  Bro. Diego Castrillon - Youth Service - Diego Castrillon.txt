believe he wants to get your attention you have to look for him in the detail I want to give thanks to God for this opportunity that to our pastor brother Caleb you give me the honor to be able to direct myself one of the most valuable recourses that the churches the church has and that's the young people we want to greet those that are watching us through the internet I have such a tremendous invitation to give you tonight if we would be so kind to open our Bible in the book of St John in the book of the Bride how many can say Amen all these books are the books of the Bride but John he has such a special characteristic let's turn in our Bibles John 16 Verse 33 I want to invite you to stand to your feet and let's read the word of God remember that the Bible is the word of God brother heavens and earth will pass away but this word will remain forever it will never pass away those are the words of Jesus these things have I spoken unto you that you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world and let us pray Lord very good evening thanks for being in our midst Lord we are waiting for great things because when you come Lord things that are so marvelous and wonder happen we confide in this word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ would you please take your I would like to ask you a question are you ready are you ready not me yet I'm going to get ready I I want to get ready I want to get nice and comfortable tonight's going to be something different the scripture that we read it cannot be written read correctly unless I would have taken that off here I am brother I'll just now I'm going to read correctly this scripture now I feel like I'm ready before we read this scripture again I want you to understand the context when and how that our Lord and savior said these words he did not speak these words in a synagogue or in a temple he Jesus did not say these words in the midst of a big Campa in the midst of a multitude no no these words that Jesus said he said these words in a specific place and they were directed to a special people and a specific people Jesus was he was in a place in a room with his disciples these words he he had kept these words and he could not pronounce them until he sat down at a table and there were his 11 friends the ones that he had chosen Judas was no longer there but so I want you tonight I want to bring such a big table where we can all sit down and we can see Jesus before saying this I want you to say brother Diego I'm already sitting at that table and now are you sitting at that table now you can see the other 10 disciples and you can see Jesus there in that intimacy now God wants to speak to your soul Jesus said these words these words have I spoken that in me you might have peace who is Jesus speaking to in the world you will have affliction or tribulation young people Jesus knows everything and he was telling us that in the world we would have affliction the word Affliction it's something where you you feel like you've been misled or deceive it that somebody has has been a traitor to you that means we would be hurt in our emotions to such a way that our friends would deceive us and and and they they would turn their backs on us and Jesus knew how you and I would feel he was telling us in the world you will have affliction but don't fear because I have overcome the world these words Jesus said these words to his intimate to his disciples to his [Applause] friends when I read these words I have to read chapter 13 chapter 14 and chapters 15 and 16 and even chapter 17 because all of these things happen in this one place Jesus with his friends with his disciples telling them that in the world you will have affliction and the world there's deceit and there's pain but don't be fearful because in him they would find peace therefore young people sometimes when we feel hurt and we feel like our friends our parents they they let us down we get frustrated and we begin to get depressed those emotions they don't have a place in a Christian because Jesus said these words he says never well I will never leave you I will never abandon you ge two words that Jesus used to to what to leave and to abandon Jesus when he was on the cross he said father why have you forsaken me you know what the word forsake means it's what it's when somebody could help you it's when you you confi in somebody that has the capacity and the recourses to help you and he turns his back on you and leaves he abandons you he forsakes you Jesus the son of God when he was on the cross he took your sin he took your sin he took my sin for that cause the father forsakes him the father because God is Holy and there's no communion between Holiness and sin Jesus being innocent he had never committed sin for you and for me he became sin and God forsook him but he tells you and me I will never I will never will never psake you our parents can maybe let us down we're hum our brothers in the flesh can let us down our friends they they can like turn their backs on us sometimes but there's one that promised that he would never abandon you that he would never forsake you isn't he worthy to receive all our wor ship and all of our confidence our our confidence friends it should not be in the in the people when I speak of confidence sometimes we we give oursel completely to a person and and and when when they turn their back on us we remain without any foundation that's what I'm referring to we have to confide totally in him that promise that he would never abandon us that he would never forsake us we are young people and we have a testimony for this world God confides in you and you and you and you that you will be able to maintain your testimony because you're not going to be alone he would be with you because he would never forsake you your friends can put you to the side your friends can reject you even maybe your parents could reject you but there's one that will never abandon you I want you to go with me first Chronicles 1 Chronicles 28:9 I believe I have your attention now we can know the Bible from cover to cover we can know all the message and go to hell what is the thing that guarantees us eternal life it's not just to know the Bible because we've got to know the Bible but brother Benham told us that eternal life is to know him him him he is the the interested person he's the one that wrote the Bible why wouldn't we want to know him the one that said he would never forsake you the one that said he would be with you the one that said he would walk with you when they reject you they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me he says well he doesn't like the women because he doesn't flirt with the women they're not discriminating against him they're discriminating against him that is walking because he has an objective to be obedient to the one that has called him when she walks down the street and the people make fun there goes that one with the dress look at that hair they're not making fun of her they're making fun of the one that is walking with her because he's speaking of those that which the world is not worthy of them what a privilege what a privilege not just to know him but to live for him stand for him as you stand for him one day him over there will stand for you the King David oh I love so much that that character of David because he was a man that knew the heart of God I love that so much she knows what I like and when she does the things that I like she doesn't only have my attention she has everything that is in me because she pleases me now David he he he put so much effort into knowing the heart of God you know what David found out that God loved one thing is that we would worship Him you didn't get it David found out that God loved that they would worship Him brother Bram said and God loves for you because God cannot be God if he's not worship if I don't worship him he's still God but he is waiting on that his children that his daughters that would worship him and that pleases him when that worship gets to him as my wife she has my attention when she pleases me when you please God worshiping him you have the attention of God you know that David he was the only King in the Bible that never lost not even one battle brother Diego what is that have to do with it we are in a battle we get sick we have problems situations we know the success that David had imagine how old are Imagine to live all your life and all of your problems and all your sickness in every situation you would go through vict going to Victory to Victory to Victory to Victory imagine can you get that a hold of that he has a a smile that's the way David smile there was no enemy that could stand in front of David when hundreds of soldiers would come against David David would not look at the number how many of they were David would worship God and God would only send one angel that would fight the fights of David imagine that God would send an angel that he would fight your fights that angel would fight your fights what kind of life would we live then yeah he's going to say I'm going to get draw a pathetic picture for you now when brother benam speaks about that is is how Jesus is outside of the church of his own church his own business they left him outside that's a pathetic picture brother now I'm going to bring a pathetic picture to see a young man to see a young person sad frustrated depression all those symptoms that's a pathetic picture when God he hasn't only given us just the Bible but he has sent us a prophet he sent a prophet he sent a prophet to you he sent a prophet to you William Mariam brandham with a revelation then you see this pathetic picture what do not be a part of that picture because of that we're going to erase that pathetic picture and today now we're going to write the history correctly come here Li stand here look over there when the book of the life of sister Eliza is read it's going to be read like this Ela lived the life the Victor and Victor and Victor and Victoria and Victor and Victor and victory and victory and victory and victory and victory she never knew what defeat was because she found out how to please God and God B all of her battles and that book will be [Applause] closed let's go to our last scripture it's in Proverbs Proverbs 8 verse 17 it's us that are going to write how our history is going to be read and when there is a problem what when Satan sends you a cancer when Satan sends you a destroyed life you're going to look him right in the face you going to say Satan that's not what I want for my life and I'm going to erase it because I'm a daughter of God because I'm a Son of God and my history my story you're not going to write it my story it's going to be written like this Proverbs 8 17 I love those that love me and I found of those that look for me early I love those that love me you know how David prayed David would say oh God Lord you're so wonderful Lord You're So Delicious lord it's such a rich thing to walk with you lord lord I wanted to talk with you oh how I love you Lord as the currents of water flow and as that little deer is thirsting today I have a thirst Lord give me to drink of that water you're so wonderful David would worship him he would worship him he made him God thank you so much David would make him God you know what God means the almighty God all powerful God when he was sick there the power was there when David was sad because David his friends inos his most intimate friends they turned their backs on him he knows how it feels and tastes for his best friend to turn his back on him that's part of life but he never left God I love those that love me why not fall in love with him when you are in love with him everything is is provided all the recourses are provided for you the new birth baptism of the Holy Ghost after Victory don't be afraid tell the fear now I am your fear because he that lives in me is the all powerful God and he is with me I ask you to stand upon your feet and let's give an Applause to the Lord
