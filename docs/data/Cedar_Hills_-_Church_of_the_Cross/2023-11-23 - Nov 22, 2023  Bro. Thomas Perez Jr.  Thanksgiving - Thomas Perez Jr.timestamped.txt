[6:27] money and time and energy just on one
[6:29] meal
[6:37] tomorrow okay all right well we

[6:43] energy you know and you got to make the
[6:47] turkey you got to make the
[6:49] gravy you got to make the
[6:52] stuffing got to make the mashed
[6:55] potatoes you got to make the

[7:06] if you get
[7:08] blessed one one one year brother Caleb

[7:16] rib what one one year we ate
[7:20] ribs we we like we like to shatter the
[7:23] the whole myth of
[7:27] everything but we but but we but we
[7:30] understand in all of
[7:32] this that it's so important to give God
[7:37] thanks the man complained and I always
[7:39] say
[7:42] this the man complained about having no
[7:46] shoes until he saw the man without any
[7:52] feet now I want you to to to to
[7:56] visualize yourself in 1620
[8:05] there was a there was a boat with a
[8:08] bunch of pilgrims on
[8:12] them and they were crossing the
[8:17] Atlantic they they were fleeing uh
[8:21] religious
[8:24] persecution if they could see us
[8:28] now
[8:31] sometimes we'll come to church if we
[8:32] want to sometimes
[8:34] not but if they see us now
[8:37] they they came across in this big old
[8:42] ship no no no less that they took a
[8:45] months and months and months to get
[8:48] here but they were going to a
[8:52] land that they could have better hope
[8:57] in they knew that many would
[9:00] die many would starve to
[9:03] death many many people would would would
[9:06] would would not understand why they're
[9:10] going they went for one
[9:13] purpose and that was to maintain their
[9:16] way of
[9:18] life and the freedom to serve God the
[9:22] way they wanted
[9:25] to
[9:27] now what Journey would you take
[9:33] tonight what what kind of Journey
[9:35] Journey would you
[9:38] take if somebody told you you could not
[9:40] raise up your
[9:44] hands somebody told you you could you
[9:46] couldn't sing No
[9:48] More would you go just gently into the
[9:54] night and say well I I guess I won't do
[9:57] it no
[9:58] more
[9:59] or would you try to find a way that you
[10:02] could raise your
[10:06] hand would you find a way where you
[10:08] could say
[10:11] hallelujah would you find a way that you
[10:14] would have Liberty to serve the Lord any
[10:17] way you want
[10:21] to now that winter they were about ready
[10:24] to
[10:26] die without a shadow of a doubt
[10:30] there there that was not the first
[10:34] Thanksgiving in
[10:40] 1564 the Spanish came to a place that is
[10:43] called that is close to San Austine
[10:49] Florida and they then had their what was
[10:52] called the first
[10:56] Thanksgiving this was a new life
[11:00] in a new place and no one knew about
[11:05] it can you imagine to have that type of
[11:10] vision spend everything that you
[11:13] have leave your house leave your family
[11:18] to go to a place you've never been
[11:21] before knowing that you might
[11:25] die but it meant everything to you and
[11:28] to your
[11:31] family that's why the Bible says
[11:34] again in everything give
[11:37] thanks for this is the will of
[11:41] God in Christ Jesus concerning
[11:46] you as we talk about
[11:51] Thanksgiving there are three types of
[11:57] givers the
[11:59] Flint the
[12:03] Flint the
[12:05] sponge and the
[12:10] honeycomb there are three types of
[12:14] givers again the
[12:17] Flint the
[12:19] sponge the
[12:23] honeycomb to get anything out of the
[12:27] Flint you have to have
[12:29] it then you mostly get chips and Sparks
[12:32] out of
[12:34] it to get water out of the
[12:39] sponge you have to squeeze
[12:42] it and the more you squeeze the more you
[12:46] get but the honeycomb is
[12:50] different it's simply
[12:55] overflows you don't have to beat it
[13:00] you don't have to squeeze
[13:01] it automatically it just oozes
[13:06] out when a person truly
[13:11] realizes what God has done for them in
[13:15] their
[13:17] day they're they want to be a
[13:22] honeycomb we ourselves live in a
[13:27] time that depends what our approach to
[13:30] anything
[13:34] is should we need a hammer to get
[13:36] anything out of
[13:40] people should we go and squeeze
[13:45] people or should we just let them
[13:50] give now I want I want to I want to read
[13:53] something here for
[13:55] you and I think that it will help you
[13:58] imen m
[14:00] s now you just deal with me
[14:05] tonight just deal with me just just a
[14:09] second all
[14:16] right I heard this the other
[14:19] day actually yeah it must have been
[14:24] yesterday one of the largest and
[14:27] strongest horses in the world is the
[14:30] Belgian draft
[14:35] horse one of them by themselves can pull
[14:43] 8,000
[14:46] okay two of them can pull how
[14:51] many
[14:54] 16,000 somebody else want to back him
[14:57] up 16,000 going
[15:00] once twice okay sister they're back
[15:04] backing him
[15:05] up and even every one of us would say
[15:08] the same
[15:11] answer that's what I would
[15:15] say but if these two Belgian
[15:20] horses if they are raised
[15:24] together they learn how to pull
[15:27] together and learn how to be unified
[15:31] together they can pull
[15:34] 32,000
[15:37] lb that's why the scripture
[15:40] says one can put 1,000 to
[15:45] flight to 10,000 to
[15:50] fly pulling in the same
[15:54] direction what would happen if everybody
[15:58] in our
[16:00] Church pulled in the same
[16:09] direction what would
[16:11] happen if we would pull in the same
[16:15] direction one group will pull this
[16:18] way another group will pull that
[16:21] way and as our pastor
[16:24] says if you want to go
[16:26] fast go by yourself
[16:29] but if you want to go
[16:31] far you got to travel
[16:34] together what concept is
[16:37] this it's the concept or the mathematics
[16:41] of
[16:44] God no wonder the psalmist would say
[16:48] this A thousand shall fall at my at thy
[16:54] side and 10,000 at thy right hand
[16:59] but it shall not come n
[17:02] thee so when you go into what is God in
[17:06] his
[17:09] mathematics this is something that we
[17:12] should understand very
[17:16] plainly in the Book of
[17:19] Revelation chapter 5 and verse
[17:23] 11 we want to do some simple
[17:27] math
[17:30] and it says and I beheld and heard the
[17:32] voice of many angels round about the
[17:36] [Applause]
[17:37] throne and the beasts and the
[17:43] elders and the number was 10,000 time
[17:52] 10,000 and thousands of
[17:56] thousands if you put the numbers to the
[18:02] scripture 1 + 1 equal
[18:08] 2 1 + 1 equal
[18:12] 2 but in the
[18:15] scripture if you you get what the
[18:18] Apostle John is is telling
[18:21] us that round about The
[18:25] Throne there was 10,000
[18:29] time
[18:32] 10,000 thousands of
[18:36] thousands so there was
[18:38] 10 so there was
[18:41] 10 to the power of
[18:47] 13 what is
[18:50] that makes
[18:53] it
[18:55] conservatively there are aund thousand
[18:59] billion
[19:03] Angels now when you when you when you
[19:05] look at that
[19:07] number you find out that that there is
[19:11] there is a also when Satan takes a third
[19:15] of the
[19:18] angels and then you look around and you
[19:21] say well why is the world so heavy and
[19:24] and and so
[19:27] Lawless
[19:31] because if you take the sum of the
[19:36] numbers there is 10,000
[19:40] demons for every
[19:46] Christian that's why you have such a
[19:49] battle but let me tell you what the
[19:51] scripture
[19:53] says greater is he that is in
[19:56] me than he that that is in the
[19:59] world so if we just take
[20:03] conservatively there's 50,000 Angels
[20:07] just in charge of
[20:18] you okay again there's 10,000
[20:22] angels that are there just to make your
[20:25] life
[20:27] miserable make sure you don't come to
[20:30] church make sure that the clock doesn't
[20:33] doesn't doesn't
[20:36] sound make sure that the car doesn't
[20:40] start make sure that that nothing
[20:43] happens your your clothes aren't
[20:47] Iron you can't come to
[20:49] church but let me tell you there's
[20:51] 10,000 of them that are trying Every
[20:54] Which
[20:56] Way get down
[20:59] but
[21:01] conservatively there's
[21:04] 50,000 that every day they say you can
[21:06] do it come on on in everything give
[21:11] thanks don't don't Focus about what you
[21:15] don't
[21:16] have Focus about what you do
[21:20] have and I when I when I see the these I
[21:25] say what a great God we serve
[21:29] you know you know one day Elisha was
[21:32] looking and at Dothan and and and and
[21:35] there was there was a a there was the
[21:39] the city was encamped about with a bunch
[21:43] of
[21:50] soldiers tells his his his his
[21:55] servant look there's more with us than
[21:58] there is against
[22:02] us and he's looking
[22:04] around he's
[22:07] surrounded we look
[22:09] around every day and we're
[22:13] surrounded Lord open his
[22:17] eyes and when he opened up his
[22:20] eyes thousands and thousands and
[22:23] thousands of angels around on the
[22:25] mountain millions millions and millions
[22:29] no
[22:30] wonder the scripture
[22:33] says are they not ministering Spirits
[22:37] sent forth for them who shall be Heirs
[22:39] of
[22:45] Salvation so according to the math of
[22:49] God if one
[22:52] believer believes God he chases a
[22:56] thousand away
[23:01] pretty good
[23:03] huh but if two get
[23:06] together 10,000 are chased
[23:10] away if three Believers get
[23:13] together a 100,000 demons go back to the
[23:17] pits of
[23:20] hell if four Believers got
[23:25] together they chased a 100,000
[23:29] forgive me a
[23:31] million if five Believers got
[23:34] together they chased 10
[23:37] million if six Believers got
[23:41] together I don't know if you believe me
[23:43] tonight but that's right a 100 million
[23:46] would be chased back
[23:49] home and if
[23:51] seven
[23:53] Believers is there seven Believers
[23:56] here stand to your feet if you're a
[23:59] Believer 1 2 3 4 5 6 say oh we got more
[24:02] than
[24:03] seven if seven Believers got
[24:07] together taste a billion Devils Back to
[24:13] the you may be
[24:16] seated now that's how much power that
[24:18] there
[24:22] is the word of
[24:25] God is very rich
[24:29] whatsoever things Ye Ye are that are
[24:35] pure and
[24:37] lovely meditate on these
[24:43] things okay I I I ran into the the
[24:49] post that's not
[24:52] lovely uh the the brother didn't didn't
[24:55] say hello to
[24:56] me
[24:58] that's not
[24:59] lovely so I'm going to think about that
[25:01] the whole
[25:04] day whatever things are
[25:09] pure whatever things are
[25:17] lovely meditate on
[25:21] them the problem is my papa said problem
[25:25] Pap people don't have a CH to
[25:31] meditate because they have their their
[25:36] phone iPad IP
[25:39] computer
[25:41] television they don't have no
[25:44] time if you don't make
[25:49] time there's no time to come to
[25:53] church sometimes we drag into church
[25:56] right
[25:58] it's because brother you don't know I
[26:00] got a lot of
[26:02] business wait a minute there there comes
[26:05] a time when we create the
[26:10] atmosphere where the Holy
[26:13] Spirit outside of number one cannot
[26:19] operate well we need to be here 30
[26:21] minutes
[26:24] before we don't but you know why we do
[26:28] need to be here 30 minutes
[26:31] before whatever things are
[26:36] pure whatever things are
[26:40] lovely it wouldn't be so wouldn't it be
[26:43] so
[26:46] good that instead of talking about
[26:50] somebody and immediately open the door
[26:52] and come into
[26:55] church if when I open up the church
[26:59] door I went straight to my
[27:03] seat and I started
[27:07] reading for God so loved the
[27:11] world behold I shall send unto you
[27:14] Elijah the
[27:17] prophet blessed is he that readeth and
[27:20] heareth the prophecy of this
[27:24] book John saw the bride
[27:29] wow who did he see John didn't see a
[27:35] bride
[27:42] me
[27:44] but doesn't become pure
[27:47] yet not lovely
[27:50] yet do you remember and I don't I don't
[27:53] want to be like like like brother
[27:54] brother has his own style but
[27:58] you know we heard a great a great
[28:00] message on
[28:02] Sunday he's very
[28:05] romantic I I think if I did that my wife
[28:08] wouldn't know who I
[28:11] was but I have been romantic with her a
[28:14] few
[28:21] times but everyone has their own style
[28:24] and that's great that's
[28:26] wonderful
[28:28] he he said that he had a brother said he
[28:30] had a
[28:34] bonon or however he said and I I said
[28:37] Well mine's vanilla Mine mine's she
[28:40] white
[28:43] chocolate we can get real real real uh
[28:46] real there and I I I
[28:48] don't but I but I want to take you to
[28:51] this yes cuz as much as I love it that's
[28:54] that's not
[28:56] me how she got together with me is
[28:58] because you know how they
[29:02] say who who who's crazier the the the
[29:05] crazy man or the one that got married to
[29:07] the crazy
[29:10] person all I know is that she's St Peter
[29:14] is not gonna have no problems
[29:16] recognizing Sister
[29:20] Laura ask as he opens up the doors who
[29:24] are you she'll come straight in
[29:29] if if you would know the day the time
[29:32] that you f first fell in love with
[29:38] Jesus hey it might have been a service
[29:41] like
[29:44] today you you you the preacher heard do
[29:47] you know that God loves
[29:50] you and you you yourself heard that for
[29:53] the first
[29:56] time oh somebody loves
[30:00] me and your head your heart
[30:04] melted with the love of
[30:07] God and so every time that we we we we
[30:12] go and and I and I and I you you you
[30:16] come into the newness of
[30:19] life and you look at the
[30:22] scripture and then and then you say oh I
[30:24] wish I could do
[30:26] this
[30:28] I I wish I could do this other
[30:30] thing and you can if you start
[30:33] meditating upon
[30:36] it now now people don't know what really
[30:41] what God
[30:43] is they they they have an a a a figment
[30:46] of their
[30:49] imagination and until it came to the
[30:53] time that brother brandham
[30:56] said I used to think that God hated
[31:01] me but that Jesus loved
[31:05] me until I found
[31:08] out that
[31:10] Jesus was the very Heart Of
[31:13] God so we start thinking about
[31:18] him and when you start thinking about
[31:21] him you start thinking about how great
[31:24] he
[31:25] is have you ever seen the
[31:29] mountains have you seen the organ
[31:32] mountains somebody had to create
[31:37] those have you seen the
[31:40] trees somebody had to put the seed there
[31:43] so that tree could Sprout
[31:46] out have you seen your brother or your
[31:49] sister L
[31:52] lately somebody had to preach the gospel
[31:55] to them
[31:58] in order for them to understand the the
[32:02] the reality of
[32:05] God but we found out that after a
[32:09] while we don't we don't we don't we
[32:12] don't meditate or we don't we don't get
[32:14] into the idea of what it
[32:19] is and our wife gets a little bit
[32:23] older you get a little bit
[32:26] older
[32:28] except that the majority of men think
[32:30] that they never get
[32:33] old I looked at myself in the mirror a
[32:36] while
[32:38] back and I said who's that old man
[32:40] looking
[32:41] at well it was
[32:44] me but we think we don't get
[32:47] old but every day we get
[32:51] old we get old
[32:54] here and we get newer there
[32:59] but we have to start thinking about
[33:03] it we start thinking about his
[33:08] word maybe I don't feel
[33:11] good but then all of us sudden
[33:14] says if this Earthly body be
[33:18] dissolved we have another one waiting
[33:21] for
[33:22] us I feel
[33:24] sick but there's another body body over
[33:27] there that's not
[33:30] sick I can't
[33:32] walk but there's a body over there that
[33:35] needs no
[33:37] help I can't
[33:40] smile but there's a body over there that
[33:44] you cannot stop it from
[33:47] smiling but it all depends of what you
[33:50] meditate
[33:53] about will tomorrow be better than today
[33:59] it all depends what you
[34:01] think it all depends of what how you
[34:04] prepare
[34:06] today now there are some things that you
[34:08] prepare today for
[34:13] tomorrow
[34:15] something and and and you say well you
[34:18] know you know things that let are left
[34:25] marinating yeah they get
[34:28] better is spaghetti better the next
[34:32] day is enchiladas better the next
[34:35] day there are certain things that are
[34:37] better the next
[34:40] day there are certain things but you
[34:43] think about
[34:45] it whatsoever things are
[34:49] pure whatsoever things are
[34:52] lovely meditate on
[34:55] them
[34:58] I've come to the understanding of
[35:01] this maybe not
[35:05] fully but to meditate on what God has
[35:07] given
[35:10] me and meditate on what what our future
[35:15] is because it doesn't matter what
[35:17] happens to this
[35:20] body but when we constantly
[35:25] think I'm nobody
[35:28] I'm just a just a
[35:31] run-of-the-mill there's nothing special
[35:33] about
[35:34] me I I love our pastor and our and our
[35:38] founding
[35:40] Pastor because they had no junk
[35:47] drawers they had no junk
[35:50] drawers each and every one of you were
[35:53] the best of
[35:55] God
[35:58] my dad would say I have the best
[36:02] church I have the best
[36:04] preachers I have the best
[36:07] family because if somebody doesn't
[36:09] believe
[36:10] it nobody will believe it you are the
[36:15] best of
[36:16] God and when you get
[36:18] down and the enemy tries to saturate
[36:22] your
[36:22] mind whatever things are
[36:25] pure
[36:27] whatever things are
[36:29] lovely I start thinking about these
[36:33] things it says the Bible says
[36:36] this
[36:38] therefore If any man be in
[36:42] Christ he is a new
[36:44] creature all things are passed
[36:48] away behold all things are become
[36:52] new but how is
[36:54] it you know I I can tell you the past of
[36:57] that
[36:59] person and that's what everybody
[37:02] remembers is the
[37:09] past you remember when Uncle when they
[37:12] they killed this
[37:14] dog that day
[37:17] forward they called him a dog killer
[37:19] just by killing one
[37:21] dog and the next
[37:25] time here comes the dog killer and he
[37:28] only did it one
[37:30] time you remember uncle in in in the in
[37:33] the mines and there at the Coby
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:38] mines there was a man that went that
[37:41] went down the
[37:42] mine he worked
[37:45] underground went through the
[37:48] tunnels by the time they found
[37:50] him he was in
[37:53] Sita from that day on he was known
[37:58] as he was known as the lost one
[38:02] yeah cuz everybody has a
[38:05] past even if you if you if you
[38:08] straighten
[38:11] up you know I had I had a I had a I had
[38:14] a
[38:15] customer and and he he he he liked to
[38:18] drink
[38:20] wine and his his nickname was Willie
[38:25] wine well I I never had the courage to
[38:28] to to tell him will he
[38:30] whine willine till one day I
[38:34] said is it all right if I call you
[38:36] willly
[38:40] wi he said you already because he wanted
[38:44] to bury his
[38:46] past but the only thing that can do away
[38:49] with your
[38:51] past is the blood of Jesus
[38:54] Christ but there are people in the
[38:58] church that are
[39:02] resurrectionists and every time they see
[39:05] you they bring it back to your
[39:08] memory remember when you used to do
[39:12] this remember when you used to do
[39:15] that but whatsoever things are
[39:19] pure whatsoever things are
[39:22] lovely think on these
[39:25] things
[39:28] our our our our pastor would say
[39:32] this it says that all things passed
[39:37] away behold all things are become
[39:43] new Happy
[39:46] Thanksgiving he's a new species of
[39:51] being he's a new
[39:55] race he's a new
[39:59] breed he's a super
[40:02] breed you know why he's Jesus
[40:09] people you
[40:11] know when you when you when you
[40:15] understand
[40:17] this It Isn't So Much what we gave
[40:24] up but it's what we have
[40:28] received it's what we take
[40:31] on Ruth in the Bible Ruth she was
[40:35] suffering and in
[40:39] famine actually Israel was suffering
[40:41] with
[40:44] famine that's how Naomi went to the to
[40:47] the land of
[40:50] Moab well when Ruth came back with
[40:55] naomii Ruth was in
[40:59] poverty this might this might make you
[41:01] say
[41:04] Amen she didn't give up her
[41:08] poverty she only took on boaz's
[41:15] riches Happy
[41:19] Thanksgiving and the poverty went
[41:23] away she didn't give up her
[41:29] loneliness she only took on the
[41:31] companionship of
[41:35] Boaz so then when we are in
[41:39] Christ it's not so much what we
[41:44] leave but it's what we take
[41:49] on become
[41:51] new so we come to
[41:54] church I'm I want to be a a better
[41:57] person take on
[42:00] Christ he's better than
[42:03] me he's
[42:05] good you know when Isaiah could not
[42:08] describe him
[42:10] anymore I'm gonna finish
[42:12] now when Isaiah could not describe
[42:16] him and he says he's the Mighty
[42:20] God he's the Everlasting father he's the
[42:24] Prince of Peace of his Kingdom there
[42:26] shall be no
[42:28] end when he could not give him
[42:31] anymore he just raised up and his hands
[42:34] and said
[42:36] this his name Shall be Called
[42:43] wonderful I was wondering
[42:46] today is he still
[42:54] wonderful me and my brothers in our
[42:58] family my mama passed away almost 28
[43:01] years
[43:04] ago Jesus is still
[43:08] one our Papa passed away this this year
[43:11] in
[43:19] May you know why because we know where
[43:22] they went
[43:24] to do you trust me
[43:28] that if I take you through the
[43:30] fire do you trust my
[43:33] word do you think that whatever things
[43:36] are
[43:38] pure have you put on the
[43:41] word have the word have you become the
[43:45] word have you spoken the
[43:48] word has Life come out of your
[43:52] mouth then it's not what you have left
[43:58] it's what you have put
[43:59] on no wonder the scripture
[44:02] says put on the whole armor of
[44:10] God we are in a in a great place
[44:15] today but God wants to take this church
[44:18] to where it's never
[44:23] been I'm G to say it again
[44:26] God wants to take this
[44:29] church higher and higher
[44:33] places plain than I
[44:36] have but what does it
[44:39] require all of us
[44:43] together well you see we'll see what the
[44:47] ministry is
[44:48] doing we'll see what the trusty board's
[44:51] doing we'll see what the Deacon board's
[44:54] doing we'll see what the men are
[44:57] doing what everybody wants to
[45:01] do whatsoever things are
[45:04] pure if one can pull 8,000
[45:10] pound can
[45:13] two
[45:17] 32,000 if one Believer by
[45:21] himself he can put a thousand enemies to
[45:24] fight en you imagine if seven men got
[45:30] together a billion demons would fight
[45:34] over themselves to get back to
[45:39] hell because every time that you wake
[45:44] up brother brother
[45:46] Elijah every time you wake up in the
[45:49] morning 20,000 demons are shaking in
[45:52] their
[45:54] boots because they know it's not going
[45:57] to go good for them today you know why
[46:00] cuz I'm going to be early to
[46:02] church and I'm going to think about oh
[46:05] Hallelujah I'm GNA and oh Hallelujah I
[46:08] can't wait to hear what the pastor's
[46:09] next message
[46:12] is praise the Lord I have put on the
[46:15] word I want to put on more words I I
[46:18] want to think the things of God and when
[46:21] I do I don't have time to talk about
[46:25] nobody
[46:26] if you want to talk about somebody talk
[46:30] about
[46:33] [Applause]
[46:34] him talk about
[46:37] him and you watch a billion
[46:41] demons cry like babies all the way back
[46:47] home because God wants to take
[46:49] you higher and higher
[46:53] plac but we have to to do
[46:58] it tell your neighbor we got to do it
[47:04] together you know Spanish say it in
[47:08] Spanish you know Chinese say it in
[47:11] Chinese now don't look at me because I
[47:13] look Chinese and I can speak
[47:17] Chinese all right I wish I could and I
[47:20] would talk to you in
[47:22] Chinese but I will tell you
[47:26] together there is nothing that can
[47:29] defeat this great Army
[47:33] of
[47:34] separate he'll pick us off one by
[47:37] one where did so and so go to I don't
