amen you may be seated we're going to play a video of the Sunday School he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed Deuteronomy 31:8 Psalm 168 I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand and I shall not be moved but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint Isaiah 40:31 fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay I will appold thee with the right hand of my righteousness Isaiah 41:10 Jeremiah 29 verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I speak to you say the Lord thoughts of peace and notal to give you an expected end Romans chap 15:3 and the god of Hope fills you with all joy and peace with him that he may abound of the Holy Ghost Philippians 4: 19 but my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen God bless the Sunday School brother Jacob if you please share your testimony with us amen praise God praise God here we go just want to share a couple of testimonies with you this morning that they may glorify God and lift up his name and I want to thank brother Hector every time we talk he encourages me to share and um when I was a little boy in elementary school I had three words right here on my right hand and when I would go to school I'm right-handed I was trying to learn how to write with my left class I would hide my right hand under my desk when I go to lunch I would also hide my right hand under the table I taught myself how to eat my left hand and I remember one day getting home from school or or one morning talking to my mother she was a woman of faith and I had constantly for months been telling her mom take me to the doctor so they can burn them off or cut them off she was over there turning the pot she was always cooking for 19 people and and she stopped for a second and she looked at me and she said go into your room get on your knees pray to God and he's going to take them off they're not here I never had to go to the doctor I went to the doctor of doctors cuz my mom told me to and since that day my faith in God grew started to grow your parents know know God listen to them listen to their counsel so God bless my mom I hope God allows her he pulls a curtain of time as she can see that her son is here praising God second one happened to me at work uh as many of you know now because the training that we had was a my job is security and and and facilities for the for the bank I walked into the main lobby into a situation one day I walked into the lobby to a main situation and there was an i rate customer and uh he was very upset we had to close his account and it takes time it takes it's a process you just can't get the money out of the Vault and hand it to him there's a process he was in the lobby just cursing and upset and constantly just yelling I tried to calm him down I says look this is my responsibility this is who I am if now we're going to call the police or we're going to have to escort you out of the building thankfully they were able to complete the process we gave him his cash we gave him his cash he starts to walk out he's still upset he begins to destroy bank property Planters and pictures off the counter and uh so I started I put my hands on his waist and and I started escorting him out of the bank Bank pushing through the lobby and out the front door and as we get out to out the front door now I'm you got to go you got to go we're on the sidewalk he STS off the sidewalk and he crosses the little the little driveway there and we have a we have zero skap there's a little island with rocks and he stops and he turns and he looks at me he squats down and he gets a handful of rocks and he's looking right at me and I said if God permits you if God permits you you will throw him at me and if he does doesn't you will not you know what happened to him he cramped up and he started to shake I was just looking at him and he just stood there shaking and he throw the rocks on the floor and he walks away I know who lives in me I know who walks with me and I know who protects me it's the god almighty God bless you Amen Let Us stand to our feet that same one that brother Hector was or brother Jacob was talking about he's here this morning don't let him pass you by you don't know him this morning here for you and it's a great honor this morning to

to be alive yeah a lot of people out we want to continue praying for our men that are in Mexico City God bless them and bring them safely amen what a what a week it has been huh I I tell you everywhere we look there There Are People Dying by the thousands whether it's from a hurricane from a war from a deranged man shooting up shooting people but not just physical death so much spiritual death is going on as well and how serious should we be how close are we to the end we are at the end but I'll tell tell tell you what it's those angels that are holding the wind it wasn't for that we would be in a in in it would be World War II already but because of the sake for the sake of the Bride of Jesus Christ those angels continue to hold back the winds before we go I want to see if these young people if you remember the threefold purpose we got one person did we learned something or okay nobody on this side no don't remember okay go ahead and tell them one of what was the first one the first one was God was going to reveal himself in Christ amen okay number two give me a young lady here that have preeminence in his bride number three restore the kingdom very good proud of you all today good [Applause] job that is the great mystery that God had in his mind God in Christ CH Christ in his church and then a restored Eden amen let's if you can be so kind turn to the book of St Matthew the 22nd chapter and this is the scripture we are using in this series you have it you can say Amen verse 41 2241 it reads like this while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ one more scripture before we sit down second First Corinthians the 2 chapter and the 16th verse have it you can say Amen good to have my children back seven weeks is a long time amen glad to have morning amen you have it all right for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ am I talking to anyone here today said but we have the mind of Christ can can you repeat that with me but we have the mind of Christ tell your neighbor neighbor we have the mind of Christ very important to understand this this morning we have the mind of Christ if we don't have it well it's time to get it right amen God may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated without the mind of Christ we will never answer the question what think ye of Christ we can give answers but we'll never answer the question within ourselves what we think of Christ the little scripture as we have we had had uh had uh quoted the other day this little scripture tonight it says holds a decision for people what think ye of Christ and then he says your decision on what that scripture asked that question will seal your Eternal destination in other words if we don't answer that question not beat around the bush let's just say it like it is without answering it we ain't G to make it yeah amen I think some of you are still have as sleep all right make sure you get awake okay neighbor nebor good to see you neighbor the battle today is hot and heavy and the crisis is everywhere you would have to be blind not to see the crisis in every aspect every place you look I don't care if it is politics I don't care if it's doesn't matter if it is Family Life there is a crisis going on everywhere there is not one thing or one place where there is not a crisis going on can I get a witness today there's a crisis everywhere you look at people people are in crisis don't know how to deal with things that they that they're going through and as you see these things and they they they are not approaching they have approached already and our understanding of the word is always dependent on the on the mind that we have we can answer a lot of questions but the question is are we using the mind of Christ or are we using our own mind that mind will determine how we handle the pressures of the crisis we are going through if you don't have the right mentality the right frame of mind the right mind you cannot handle the pressures of the crisis that are going on in the world you go crazy more you you turn the TV on and you look at the news the the worse it is and we ask the question is how much worse can it get I remember asking these questions 20 30 years ago we were like it can't get any worse and boy have I been wrong crisis everywhere everywhere we turn the headlines are crisis the world in crisis the nations in crisis the church in crisis the family unit in crisis marriages in crisis the individual in crisis and if there ever was a crisis it is now and you would think that we would we would run to the word you think that people would run to Christ but instead yeah they they they have gotten into this into this realm and they think they're okay but as the pressure continues to come upon us it gets harder and harder even to maintain your thoughts brother bradam says in the message the second coming of the Lord now notice then just before that he prophesied here and said the walls of Jerusalem will be Trot down by the Gentiles until the Gentile dispensation would be finished the muhammadans have took it over we realize that and I want you to look at the crisis tonight he says how Ishmael and Isaac are still at his each other's neck right at Jerusalem where it's predicted they would be that was 1957 now 2023 Isaac and ishma are still at each other's neck when we when we see this crisis I want to go to another another another message that he speaks of God keeps his word and how timely it is and he says our thought this afternoon is dealing with Israel in a time of and then he says such as the church is going through today all things come to a place of Crisis before it hit hit the climax diseases usually go through the crisis and after the crisis then you may get well it turn one way or the other you'll either die or you'll get well but when we see these crisis we see what Israel where they're at we cannot lose sight of what the prophet of God said that Israel and the church they parallel they have not stopped paralleling this morning they have not stopped paralleling Israel and the church continue to parallel each other in seeing this when you see Israel at War then you see a church at War also yes yes when you see a crisis in Israel you see a crisis in the church and we don't ever want to talk about those things we want to act like everything is okay but we have to face the crisis we have to be ready and we have to have the right mind in order to deal with the crisis correct the word crisis was created to describe things that we cannot understand or things that are out of our control whenever things are out of our control oh I'm in a crisis what is the person person saying I have no control over this no more we go to the doctor we wait for the results and it's sometimes things out of our control but when you when you let's define the word crisis now it says it's a time of intense difficulty it is trouble or danger it's a time when a difficult or important decision must be made a crisis is therefore the moment when a situation will either turn for the better or for the worse now once again homes are in crisis because they can turn for the better or for the worse at any time people are in crisis because they can turn from better or worse at any time you don't know who's going to lose it at any time you'll see somebody oh this very they're very nice people and the next thing you know it they turn what happened crisis happened now notice this now it comes from the Greek wordis and it means something of a decisive moment because when you're in a crisis it's it's a moment of decision am I going to seek what the will of God is am I going to seek what the purpose is for me going through this or am I just gonna say why is this happening to me it's sad to say but we as humans are programmed already to automatically say when we're in crisis Lord why Lord Jesus why are you punishing me and they don't realize that God has sent the crisis because in the crisis is where you're going to find Christ are you with me I'm I'm going to say it again we are pre-programmed already I don't understand why you're punishing me Lord you need to put on a different mind because under our carnal mind we'll never understand the purpose but under or with the mind of Christ we'll begin to answer the question what think ye of Christ because when you answer the question why you think of Christ it'll answer the question of what you think of yourself the Bride In Christ is not two different entities in all reality crisis is the moment of decision and it's how we view the situation and our decision of how to proceed from that point you see you see we look at it crisis always as a negative but did you know that the Japanese language they have no word for chrisis they didn't make a word for Christ why because they don't teach that to their people are you with me but the word that's closest to them that they use for crisis they use the word opportunity what a what a different mindset not the word crisis as negative but when something happens it's it's it's an opportunity now can we can we this morning permit that the that the Lord would would help us change our mentality how many want to make sure that we have the mind of Christ on we never understand the the message we can't understand the scriptures without having the mind of Christ once again the scripture says we have the mind of Christ Christ is Crisis comes in many forms the death of a loved one I know I'm speaking to to to to everyone here failed Health losing a job or a business drug addiction on and on you go you can go just fill in the blanks and it not only affects the person involved that's directly involved but it it affects everyone that is around that person everyone that's connect you get somebody that that that that that's into drug that has maybe drug abuse or alcohol or whatever it is the family around is the one that that takes the load takes the hit what do people do they need relief and the only relief that they have if you don't turn to Christ is alcohol drugs and porography everything else you want to fill in the blank all these things are just a temporary fix because we can't see any further than the crisis we get so caught up with the crisis that we can't see Christ in it all finding Christ in the crisis Paul had a different mentality Paul said all things work together for good now this is different now this is a different mind frame all things work together for good to them that are the called according to his purpose now we're going to get somewhere we love to quote scriptures about blessings amen we love scriptures that say oh you are worth so much God forne you you are you are now a Son of God you're a daughter of God oh we love those scriptures but why don't we take a hold of scriptures like in the world you shall have tribulation hello everybody what do we do with those scriptures amen I believe that and we but we don't want to read it all the time right imagine every morning we'd wake up and say in the world you will have tribulation you know what that would help us do change our mindset but not just change the mindset but change the mind in this world we will have tribulation in this world we will have crisis and we can't get away from that but then he goes on and says but be of good cheer for I have all overcome the world come on church we will have tribulation he already overcame the world we really think that because we are believers and we follow this great message we actually think that we're immune to crisis that we're immune to tribulations let's deprogram that I'm going to say it again we're he's reprogramming us this morning we're here for a purpose we're not here just to hear a good message and say good job Pastor I don't care about that though I appreciate it when you say it but we're after something changing of a mind this morning God wants to do something so great with us he cannot do it when we have our own mind we got to put on the mind of Christ now now let me see your hands if you're with me today you want to change the mindset you want to change the mind okay then don't think like that no more nothing can happen to me because I'm a Christian are you serious somebody lied to you you want to become a Christian be ready for the fight of your life be ready for crisis be a good cheer though for I already overcame the world now notice this as we as we get into this subject you will have crisis for it's through the crisis that our character is formed and our faith is perfected it will not come any other way we're all always trying to find the easy route yes or yes we're always trying to find the easy way around things but only through the crisis is our character formed because it's through the crisis that we fight the good fight what have we ever learned when time times are good help me this morning what have you ever learned when times are good absolutely nothing there times of refreshing sent to God to help us on this trip be a good cheer in the middle of the crisis be of good cheer oh that's hard to do yes it is we are humans and we hurt we're not robots we hurt deep down in our soul there got to be something that is anchored this guy will go back and forth this guy can question everything in my soul I cannot question the word I cannot question God I can just say Lord give me strength to go through this crisis be of good share brother Bram says but God will answer in a time of Crisis we're always when things are good Lord Lord help me answer me Lord call upon him in the time of Crisis and then brother Bram says he will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of Crisis if uhoh he will make manifest in the time of Crisis if the people assemble together where are we going to assemble together in church here we can be sitting in the same church and it's a church to some it's a lodge to someone else did I say that out loud watch this now if the people assemble together and there is a meeting place where we assemble together and that meeting place is in Christ let's follow this for a moment manifestation in the time of Crisis then everything that needs to be manifest can only be manifested in a time of Crisis yes or yes you're looking at me like you don't know what I'm talking about watch watch our carnal man gets in the way oh no I don't want to go through through those things you don't want to be a Christian some of you looking at me like man this is what I signed up for you need the mind of Christ those Martyrs that gave their life it was an honor to give their life are you with me it was an honor to do things for the Lord suffer whom the world was not worthy how many of you are in the middle of a crisis I thought we weren't going to play Church we're playing church I already told you if Israel parallel and Israel is in crisis church is in crisis and if you don't think you're in a crisis right now you are lying to yourself right you want me to be honest with you or you want me to be one of those one of those preachers that just put the sugar on it and just let me see how many how many here are truthful are in crisis I I have to raise both of my hands I'm in a constant crisis all the time it's okay you don't have to ask to me to God turning a blind eye towards it and the enem is telling you no you're not in the crisis everything is fine you don't understand what crisis okay we're going to play church or we're going to be serious not to not for the Cale but but but toist the key is not whether we will have crisis but what are we built upon for the Cris or the storm doesn't come to destroy you amen it comes to prove what you're built on the wind doesn't blow just to blow it's to prove what you're built on you built have you built your house on the sand or have you built your house on the rock you want to know let the winds blow let the crisis come then you'll find out if you have built your house correctly we are in a battle brother brand I'm in the message adoption I feel that you want me to do it this way to the Lord that it's your Divine will it's in your order it's the order of the day to let the people positionally find their place and be ready for the hour of battle and as our brother said in his prayer oh you have trained us so long Lord come on now we've all been through crisis I don't care who it is we have been through many crisis you have trained us so long Lord chis after crisis but now father give us our ranks put us out there to what we're supposed to do so that we can be about our father's business do you see the purpose of a crisis it's God sending the crisis telling you it's me oh come on Church he's sending the crisis to say it's me is there such a thing as a crisis for God exactly it depends on what mind you have on listen listen closely to this now a crisis is the only way or the only thing that will produce a promotion give us our ranks give us a promotion then come through the crisis with uh oh my think about this for a moment think about this there's a promotion he wants to give you crisis produces promotion imagine God caused a national crisis he caused a national crisis in the greatest country at that time he destroyed the very economy of Egypt just so that a young man can could Ascend to the throne no I I don't think you believe that took a young man out of prison sent them through seven years of plenty and then seven years of of famine in theis he went to the throne became the number two man in all of Egypt he got a promotion his brothers hated him they were tried to kill him and then they sold him off was in prison wrongly accused and then he got a promotion I don't know about you but Joseph was the answer to the crisis he had the answer to the crisis in Egypt who Do You Think You Are the answer to the crisis what's the problem sounds good huh until you're going to the the crisis until you're sitting in prison how did this happen many of us are sitting in our own little prison wondering why am I in this condition you don't have to be in that condition you're in your condition because you have not recognized Christ is the answer in the crisis church I hope that this this is making sense to you your gift comes alive in the middle of a crisis tell your neighbor say neighbor your gift comes alive in the middle of a crisis it stirs you inside why is this what but when it IT stirs you that gift starts to get active something is going on the gift is being stirred that's the problem with so many people are you with me that's the problem with so many people I'm not enthusiastic about nothing I feel like I have no purpose you're in the middle of a crisis but in that crisis he's trying to manifest something in you he's stirring something inside of you because when that gift begins to operate oh you have contentment yes sir I just come to church and did it you're in a crisis line to yourself you hear too many and it brings you into a crisis a state of [Music] confusion no it brings satisfaction there's no greater satisfaction to me to preach the gospel help the Bride of Jesus Christ do what I can no greaters my sa is to go out there in the world and and preach the gospel my gift has been stirred already crisis upon crisis your faith is only as strong as the test it survives come on church I'm going to say it again your faith is only as strong as the test it survives we have crisis every our home lives the husband don't get along with the wife at what's the matter we don't take care of things need if you don't take care of your body what happens they get sick easy we don't take care of our children they'll leave we don't take care of our marriage and ends up in divorce we mismanage our money we'll go bankrupt we lose anything that we don't take care of Amen wow and that's why we don't get answers to our prayers because God will not give you the answer to your prayer just because you asked him he won't answer you according to what you ask for he'll answer you according to what you can manage or what you can take a million dollars can't even manage $100 and give God a 10 from there many are going through what is called the god crisis anybody ever heard that term God crisis God they call that when a crisis of faith is a painful experience in a Christian's life when he or she begins to doubt what they have claimed to believe and it causes grief and confusion as well as a sense of disconnection from God I know that here today there are people that feel a disconnection from God but you've come to the right place come on now church if I were to ask how many of you feel disconnected in one way or another we got some hands we got a few hands you feel disconnected why going through a crisis we don't know what to do don't know where to we [Music] should that's why when I started getting those phone calls brother there there's going to be a great falling away in the message and I'm like what are you talking about oh brother Billy Paul passed away yeah there's going to be a great falling away and I'm like well if they fall away is because they have not been taught correctly [Applause] where in the message did Brother bam ever say brother Billy would not die that's right it's exactly the same way church it's it's exactly the same problem that Jesus had with his disciples right they were quarreling one with the other here Peter and John huh about what about that guy he was pretty sassy about it what about that lays on your bosom sure he called him a brown noser whatever you and Jesus comes to John and says looks at Peter and saysed what is it to you he terries I you know what they did the Bible says they they went telling everybody guess what I got I got the news John's not going to die yes or yes everybody was like No And then they they went and told their friends and they told their friends and next thing the Bible says it went out abroad and the word abroad there is not just in Israel they went to all the countries went around the world's not going to die it's exactly what we have done with the message he was told this and what's the problem this is what I'm talking about when our mind is not correct we'll take anything that is said twist it misconstrue it and then we want to go tell others about it what do you mean when did he say he wasn't going to die and yet some years later John is on the aisle of and he's taken in the spirit and he sees the coming of the Lord and then after that he passes on he fulfilled what Jesus said but they had misconstrued it come on trick are you with me this morning let's let's let's be serious about this people in Cris is everywhere and I'm talking to every one of us from the pastor to the deacons the ushers to the trust youth leaders and children teachers Sunday school I'm talking to everyone listening M and daddies yeah I'm talking to every one of you take what you can from it there's a crisis going on it's a church I don't have to pull no punches I was placed here for that purpose it's a critical moment right now where some can turn for the good or turn for the worst come on you you better know where you're standing I'm going to say it again you better know where you're standing because in this crisis you're either going to go one way or the other it's critical a crisis comes to show who is in the heart who is in the control room who is the real believer notice this now in the message seven compound names of Jehovah compound name Jehovah Martha and Mary Mar leaving the church and they had believed on Jesus and Jesus walked away left them in the crisis brother he left them in the crisis the boy was sick that was horrible they sent for him and he went further they sent again for him he still didn't come and after all hopes was gone Lazarus dies in The Crisis what he said he can go one way or the other way but it was never a crisis for Jesus I'm G to say it again it was never a crisis for Jesus my goodness I'm gonna tell you again it's never a crisis for Jesus it's at The Darkest Hour when all hopes are gone that Jesus came and as the thong says he was four days late and he was right on time hallelujah amen watch the mentality in the crisis Jesus too late he's dead no he's not no no no he's dead no put him in the already in the Tomb no he sleep he was dead to them because they couldn't do anything about it he was asleep to Jesus because he could do something about up and that's what he did when we see this that's when we come to these crisis and when we come and we're at that point where we don't know what to do we're turn brother Bram says Sovereign Grace Steeps in can you give one to the Lord for his sovereign we don't need more power we need more faith to use that now watch in the message I have heard but now I see now sometimes there's what we're looking for these great pulsations of Faith yeah it's it's heart to heart boom it it it's he sending faith the Revelation boom he's sending it to the to the body boom boom he says these great pulsations of Faith they come right in the time of Crisis it's usually crisis that drives us into this it was a crisis that drove job into it end of his life and his children dead the camels and so forth all the goods destroyed gone and his own life was broke out from the crown of his head to the SES of his feet with boils it was a crisis and then he pressed or that pressed his and there's where the inspiration struck him amen amen now in this hour this great crisis is on when we know that this nation is shaking not only the nation but the world is shaking it's at the end time there is not an another thing that I know to happen but the Rapture the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it's already ready my question is are you looking for it or does the crisis have you so bound that you can't see Christ now I'm GNA turn the corner here okay you still with me or you I can wait till next Sunday to finish it then let's turn this corner because this this is where we want to get to once again we have to have the right mind in order to handle the crisis the problem is is that we've got to be reprogrammed not with our own ideas not with the ideas of the professor in the University ideas of this motiv speakers something greater than this and go let's go back to Matthew the 22nd chapter and please follow me on this because this is the the message really that that we it settles in now and we read that what think you of Christ whose son is he that's verse 42 this is what got me here because without realizing these men that were so smart and so wise in the in the law and here comes Jesus first thing he does he challenges their think say that again what he's doing to each one of us today challenging your thinking what think ye of Christ the only way to think you have a have to have a mind and your answer depends on which mind you have right what think he of Christ he's gonna show them right away thinking is caral yeah that's right he's proving this to them and right in their faces what think he of Christ whose son is he that's son of David yeah through the carinal lineage watch where the answer comes now he said then how does David in spirit now in other words you've answered it according to the flesh but then how does David in spirit call him Lord the Lord said unto my Lord verse 45 if David then call him Lord how is he his son the more that I thought about that the more blown away I was Christ the word is challenging their thinking he's showing them that their thinking is carnal and not spiritual for that which is born of the flesh is flesh but that which is born of the spirit is Spirit this morning he's challenging our Thinking by hearing people talk you can tell whether they're using their mind or the mind of Christ the greatest well I think I'm sorry but I'm going to say it again he challenging our because if we were spiritual minded we don't answer well I think nobody cares what I think brother Caleb thinks but now Christ I want to know what Christ thinks about it now if brother Caleb has the mind of Christ then I can't help you under well I think I get that all the time brother Caleb what do you think about this I don't know if I give them what I think I haven't help but when the inspiration can come his mind comes on the scene and he says and and I say well this is what the word says this is what all the thing changes now the atmosphere changes the answer changes why it's no more a carnal way of thinking it is him now this is this this got me so good and I want to make sure that I can convey this to you what time is it I can have about 15 20 minutes still 30 minutes or so somewhere in there watch this now because Jesus knew their hearts he would catch their thoughts and the first thing he would say is don't think that way how many read that in the Bible what do you think of Christ he already knew the answer he knew where they were going follow me closely right now Jesus would say don't think that way you've been programmed by religion to think a certain way you may be been programmed to believe or to think that there are three Gods you may programmed to believe different things that you believe Jesus would come back and say but don't think that yes or yes you read your Bible imagine the religious people looking at Jesus and say who is this guy trying to come and destroy the law and the prophets religion that but when Jesus catches it Matthew 57 first thing he tells them think not I don't even have to go any further I don't have to go any further than that think not you're using your carnal brain stop stop what do you think well I think are you with me or not come on now this is what Jesus is telling them think not stop thinking that way that I am come to destroy the law or the prophet I am not come to destroy but to fulfill now you're putting on the mind of Christ he's re trying to reprogram their thinking he can't tell them to think not unless he gives them something better to think about oh I'm going to say that again he cannot tell them don't think like that he doesn't give them something better to think about think that I come to destroy the law fill it I came to magnify it now you're thinking the right way now well the pastor he he plays favoritism in church wow think not oh come on I I believe the pastor but not I don't know if I lost some of you or what here's Jesus Matthew 10:34 Jesus the prince of peace there he goes again think not think not that I am come to send peace on the earth oh I'm gonna be a Christian and we're g to be so peaceful think not I help us I came not to send but a sword I didn't come to send peace I came to send a sword I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law uh what does this do come on it causes the crisis it causes crisis in the home you go to that church but don't talk to me no more Cris is in the home Jesus said I have come to send a sword and I've come to set at variance a man's foes shall be they of his own household a crisis he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me he that love his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it I thought everything was going to be fine when I became a Christian they would all be and Roses I I wouldn't have no problems sorry you were misinformed but now you're in a battle so you might as well fight I didn't come to send peace to the Earth but a sword in other words if you want peace Pi up the sword Hallelujah and that sword is the word and with that sword you drive out all the squatters that are living in your land there a lot of squatters on our land right now when we're looking at things we're not supposed to there's a squatter on your land when we're thinking a certain way there's a squatter in take out the sword dve them out of your it's the problem we don't use the word god do everything for me he's already done it all but take him at his word now this is we see this we see the reality of Christ in the crisis for the word of God is quick sharper than any two edges are you getting it you can't have peace without CH that sounds like like it doesn't go together he's in a crisis of course because when we understand this Jesus said in John 16:33 these things I have spoken unto you that in me in me you might have peace that's why I can be in the crisis but if I am in Christ I'm at peace I didn't come just to send peace you want peace he's he's inviting you in me that's the meeting place in Christ is the the peace watch what he says that in me you might have peace in the world you will have tribulation but if you want peace come in me be of good cheer I have overcome the world watch how it changes this next one Luke 12:40 blew me away be therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when you think not we say usually the son of man comes at an hour when we least expect it my question is is he gonna come when we least expect him the bride of Christ isn't least expecting him we are expecting him oh come on now the son of man will come when you least expect it said the son of man will come at an hour when you think not words at an hour when you're no longer using your own thoughts you think not that the son of man comes comes on the scene to do what to take us to make us to mold us to prepare us that's what the ministry of the son of man did it was to get a bride prepared so that we could be in expectation of the groom I don't know about you but he's not coming in an hour that I least expected he's coming the moment that I stop thinking my own thoughts I don't know if you get that or not stop thinking I had to stop thinking my thoughts a long time ago let this mind be in you was also in Christ Jesus the moment we put the put on the mind of Christ that's the hour he comes you want healing who needs healing today let me see raise your hand if you be afraid it don't matter if it's spiritual if it's physical you need healing think notah what else am I going to tell you think not well the doctor said there's no cure you're thinking is being influenced who needs salvation today don't think not just receive him doesn't need you to think of how how it's going to happen you're in the middle of a crisis but I already overcame world the mind of Christ comes it flows through the channel that's where the anointing through that mind comes the word flowing but there's no cure but he was wounded for oh come on think not this way but in his mind he was wounded for my transgression he was bred for my iniquities the chastisement of his peace was upon me by his stripes I Caleb Bettis am healed we could have the purest intentions we can have the purest intention and somebody will mistreat us why' you look at me like that like me how did I look at you kind of like sry I don't think about forgiving listen to this I went to the Lincoln Memorial this this is all needful for this message and I I I saw some quotes of Abraham Lincoln that I that really struck me how many of you know why the Civil War was fought the majority of the people would say it was fought for slavery slavery fighting over the issue right TR to one side trying to abolish slavery and the other side was maintain that and though that was one of the great issues that Mo motivated both sides that was never the focal point of Abra because this this is this is the message Abraham Lincoln said this abah you know I dislike slavery and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it but my enemies pretend that I am now carrying on the war for the sole purpose of abolition to abolish the slavery he says but so long as I am president it shall be carried on for the sole purpose of restoring the union oh Church get get the spiritual application of this I would save the union he said my Paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and it is not to to save or destroy slavery if I could save the union without freeing any slaves I would do it if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that it wasn't about that issue it was about the Unity come on church it was about the unity it was about the union and when we when we understand this and we see what was the purpose of sending a Prophet come on CH what's the purpose we sit around say look I don't believe it like you I don't believe it like you I want to ask everyone who claims the message was the purpose of this message being brought to us was it to start a civil war amongst Brothers was it to fight over doctrinal points was it to prove that my way of thinking is better than yours and that I have more quotes than you was it to start a fight between those that hear tapes and those that want to hear the fold Ministry what was the purpose of all these Visions so that we could fight about the tent Ministry the return or the Thunders but they're revealed or not no no no no no we have made issues of those things and by doing so we have divided the Brotherhood what was the purpose the message and the messenger one and the same being one and the same what was the purpose of this message brought to us as the eagle stirreth her nest my Min is a Ministry trying to unite the body of Christ yes not to unite denomination to another denomination but unite brothers and sisters as one group of people one in purpose one in heart one in unity in order to see the coming of the Lord oh church church what are we doing with this we Have Made issues of everything in the message turning northward because the church cannot go with an arm in one place a head another foot another you got to have prophesying and a noise of coming together that's all I can tell you till the whole body of the Lord Jesus Christ stands up as one great unit of God then we'll leave this mountain and we'll go over and possess the promised land I'm your brother and I'm only fighting for that one purpose to unite the Church of the Living God one heart and one Accord the purpose of the ministry of the seventh angel to open and reveal the Mysteries that under that Revelation the complete revelation of the whole thing it would restore the Union what is he doing what is the message doing we seem like we get farther and farther away from each other what what message are we following shame on [Music] us it was to bring the bride the body together and then to unite the head which is Christ to make one if that's not what's going on in our lives missed the whole essence of the message that's why he preaches uniting time and sign he preach the invisible Union why that was the purpose was for the you when I see this and I and I'm gonna I'm gonna just pass over a few things there's so much here I want to just if I open up this one I will be here for a long it's not what was said that was wrong it's that the way we interpreted F what think ye of Christ I feel led to close we'll carry it next Sunday we're in the midst once again of the greatest crisis in the history of man but at the same time we're in the midst of the greatest manifestation of all time we are in the midst of the greatest expression of God in Christ and Christ in his church we're in the middle of it and the crisis and the pressure we feel what's the purpose of it for him to manest what he's doing right nows and daughters man when I see this and and I see all that is going on I simply say this brother BR preaches the message what think he of Christ a few times and in there one of the things he says if I were to he's manifes say it again he's manifesting right said if I were to call some people to ask them what they think he said I

us today amen I'd like to read the scripture in St Mark the 10th chapter we don't just believe in presenting we believe in [Music] dedicating we we want to dedicate her to the honor and glory and to the service of the Lord we don't baptize because there's no scriptural reference to that and this church is based upon what the scripture says St Mark the 10th chapter in the 13th verse says and to 16 and they said and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuke those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall receive the kingdom of God as little child he shall enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them we we simply say they are God's gift to you J she is God's gift to you what you make of her is your gift back to God don't send her to church bring her to church and we do believe in raising a child in the admonition of the Lord and upon those basis we dedicate Ariel Marie Bradford to theice wow she is beautiful and I've never had
