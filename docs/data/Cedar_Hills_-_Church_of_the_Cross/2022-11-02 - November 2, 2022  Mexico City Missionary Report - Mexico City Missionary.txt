Marcos therefore I say unto you what things so ever ye desire when ye pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them uh you may be seated first I want to thank the Lord for giving me the opportunity of going on this trip foreign but I prayed and the Lord made a way for me to make a friend amigo he knew Spanish in English so he helped me with things I was able to do everything and have a good time God is so good and he hears us when we pray God bless you [Applause] thank you foreign [Music] I guess one of the main things principales that uh really impacted me on this trip gave me impact was really the reason I went to go foreign I don't know if all of you know but some of you may know I tore my ACL like three weeks before the trip no says and um my surgery could be scheduled for October 24th which would make it and it would basically make me miss my entire trip so I am very stingy because and I was like I don't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't I don't know but um I don't know I just had this really like tug on my heart to go so I talked to my pastor Uncle Caleb of lake and he kind of he gave me an answer without giving me an answer and we talked it through a little bit and at the end of the day he kind of just you know LED it up to me for me to decide so I I went on the trip and it was it was um it was a really good experience um I throughout the entire Camp I mean they were just amazing people and I think one of the things to me was that it hit more close to home than I thought it was going to um because I thought I was gonna make I guess friendships with other people but really I made just deeper friendships with the people that I went with it was me brother Noah Isaiah and yeah us for a loan in the camp when we knew nothing about anyone else so we kind of used that and we bonded a lot closer than we ever have same with you know the other people who went brother Robert I didn't know he speak Spanish that was very interesting same with um and sister Debbie that was very nice to be able to get to know them a lot better and they were like my second parents but just uh being able to bond with the youth was honestly one of the best things ever and that's all I got God bless you yes [Applause] man God bless you all this evening let us stand and we're gonna read a scripture first Peter 2 9. but ye our chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation of peculiar people that he should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness into his marvelous life is foreign this this scripture here was the the scripture for the camp yes and the scripture really really hit home uh talking about the chosen generation and there was a total of about 144 youth that were there from different parts of Mexico and you got to see a chosen generation at this campus escojillo and the preachings that went forth were were just they all just came together so beautifully it was our brother Seth that preached on Friday night it was Brother Carlos on Saturday Night Carlos and it was brother Enzo that gave us a teaching on Sunday morning Lorenzo Jr and it was uh my dad that preached the Sunday service and it was a privilege for me to be able to play the piano throughout these services to be able to meet brother Paco and his wife I got to play the piano while brother Paco LED some songs and overall it was just an amazing trip to me all these all the different youth there is and it was it was something and I know it was the grace of God that it seemed like there was absolutely no language barrier between us and them and we were able to talk to all the Brethren and have Fellowship um and it was it was just a beautiful trip getting to go with my with my whole family getting to see my dad preach there in Mexico getting to see the the generations from my grandpa Demi Abuelo down to my dad um getting to see if my cousin Seth preached it was just being able to see the lineage and being there with all the people seeing the lineage of God is this was a trip that that has changed my life and I can't wait to be able to go on more trips that is all I have for you yeah [Applause] amen God bless you Joseph it is uh so good to be back home yes and uh first of all I'd like to thank our pastor for this opportunity thank the Lord Jesus for such a a wonderful trip we went on um it is uh no coincidence that this Camp que Este Campo was held on the weekend of Dia de los Muertos and let me tell you is I am one of those one of those uh young people that died that weekend that died out to the things of this world and I am also a witness of many lives being changed amen this was uh like our brother said it was just absolutely amazing and um for me I was just I was uh very nervous over the language but as my brother Ethan said there was absolutely no language barrier absolutely we got in there with them everything just went smoothly and it was just so good to get to know people from devida and to hear their testimonies of what God has done for them and uh foreign and I just thank the Lord for Illinois for his grace his Mercy for everything done for me and I would uh I could give you anything is hirago to the young people a Los jovenes I would really urge you to go on one of these trips they are they're life-changing gambian La Vida amen God bless you Jose [Applause] I'd like to take the opportunity to thank her for faster permitting me to go you know speak right now at this moment I've been wanting to go to Mexico City since I was abroad 16 or 17 years old and uh that finally happened in God's time for those who win s take five minutes so I like to read the scripture I'm a borrower from Brother Ethan um first Peter foreign generation a royal priesthood holy nation and peculiar people people should shoot forth Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light is foreign 21 million 804 515 I mean people in the greater Mexico City area [Music] and I rounded that up to about 150 youth being there in the camp yeah yeah and that is about point zero zero six eight nine percent is talk about being called The Peculiar people all right getting to know brother will sister Deb yeah um brother Enzo or Lynch says Lynch so I was blessed and I'm moving to see you I can't explain to you you know how blessed I was to be able to interpret no whether it's because it had been 30 years it means a lot is so if I have anything to say to you I was 20 years old when I went through a difficult trauma in my life and I always try to fix it on my ownismo foreign don't ever try to fix them on your own persimismo run to your pastor run to the ministers run to your family don't wake up 30 years later no the spirited doing what you need to do I gotta look at things because God's gonna bring your fear your son the daughter of God will bring you when you're a son or daughter of God so take the better way take the good way take the life don't feel you need to carry the Burger on your own it's not yours to carry noise so God bless each and every one of you it was wonderful to spend that time with you listen to me you yes they say wisdom is an accumulation of Errors I think it's wiser to learn from errors of others if you could take something away don't wake up 30 years later it has been a difficult world but I thank God for it because you have the confidence that one day I'd be able to carry it off and I'm grateful for that and it was a privilege to meet our brothers and sisters in Mexico City they're awesome I know God permits it won't be my last time going I love each and every one of you always turn to God for everything you're not alone foreign [Applause] what a privilege it was to go to Mexico City Mexico I got I gotta say it again what a privilege it was to go to Mexico City Village because I got to follow the path foreign and I just kept thinking what a privilege it was that God in my time would choose me we hear this a lot but for this trip it impacted me in such a way that I realized what other thing what other great thing in this world do I have that I have to do many times we get caught up or I get caught up in the daily life things that I need to accomplish in my life take care taking care of my family and such things but nothing's greater than to serve God's people no nothing's greater than is to serve you notice to serve your young people each and every one of you are very special in my life I try to balance the work and Family Church in my life I have done that all wrong because all I have to do is place the Lord Jesus as number one in my life you gotta replace the Lord Jesus is number one in your life and everything balances out but we get ourselves into trouble when we try to balance it for him but I would like to read a scripture and and that is found in the Book of Revelation apocalypsies 15 3 and 4. and the Bible says and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and a song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways now king of saints Frey de los Santos the theme of this Camp is we are called to be different we are called to be different when I found out the theme this is the the phrase that kept repeating in my mind a declaration to my members a declaration to my problems that I am called to be different that the youth are called to be different people are called to be different we had a good time in the Lord indeed I come back with a good report and a witness I come back with other witnesses that the Lord is still calling calling his children and you can see the impact of the Holy Spirit there with the young people I was just so happy to be a part of it is so happy that I was given the confidence and the opportunity to be able to go on this trip I I believe it impacted Me Maybe maybe more than than them because we were called to be different what a privilege to be called The Chosen generation the royal priesthood who else in the world can say that a revelation not just to read it and say that's a nice scripture take that that inside their heart to know that God has called us we are privileged we were the most important people on this Earth what a good report that I believe it's about five right brother a handful of young people decided to give their hearts to the Lord you know if it was for the five well done they'll get old is it doesn't it Thrills you you're going I can see why our pastor is missionary minded God is still working and he's using us we should be over joyous and I'm so happy to be a part of it is I I was able to hear the testimonies of the youth on the Friday nights and the things that they struggle with and see where they're at now I was happy to be a part of it today you see that they that we could encourage them and that God gave me the strength to encourage them his bottom line is Ultimo Lemma I've had a lot of encouragement yo but I mean every Sunday you've had a lot of encouragement every Sunday uh Domingo every Wednesday by the ministry Pastor what encouragement and I just want to tell you let's get on the seed God's still calling what a joyous time it is alive and doing very well I love you with all my heart may God richly bless you [Applause] this this evening they're wonderful to hear all the reports and to to see what God is he's still doing in our generation you know what uh uh if we can just turn to uh to our scripture and that was in second Peter yeah excuse me first Peter Primera de Pedro to to uh 210 yes uh verse nine was was read and uh but verse 10 it says which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy foreign that was that went on this trip foreign sometimes we're sometimes we think uh we're we're a little crazy but uh it was funny when the when the camp started the youth were kind of uh there was there was uh there was about 140 some youth there have you had approximately and as things are kind of everybody's trying to get to know each other a little bit [Music] a little timid um and then uh once the game started going a little bit you know people be like Yay but uh but our group just got right in it they were they were they were chest bumping it says it was going crazy and they were just just screaming yelling and and it and what it did was it made everybody kind of loosen up a little bit and all the other youth were like wow I guess we could do that too so it kind of started a good chain reaction and after that all the all whatever chains they had on them whatever shyness was it was thrown out the windows oh and everybody just had a marvelous marvelous time to when we when we got there on when we got there to the camp on uh on Friday morning you know sometimes we think well we we came from Far uh this is well you know we came from America you know and we got there about 11 30 in the morning there had been uh there had been youth from Saltillo that had traveled all night 12 hours and got there at eight o'clock in the morning we're waiting all day until I think we got into the camp about 12 30 or so media but when people are in expectation of that is you can travel all that time you know we're we're going to have a good time bring greetings from but from Brother Paco yeah he's the pastor there at Virginia is from him and his and his wife sister Olga uh saludos and they just wanted me to tell you that they they love you very very much and I uh I'm thankful for for the uh all the brothers and sisters that that went that gave their time and efforts Italian you see through all I think brother Robert said there was there was 20 some million people there in the greater Mexico City but when you see all that all that's happening and how how this generation is just uh it's just so perverted it's it's so crazy but when you see a group of young people that that are going there for a specific purpose that purpose is to draw closer to God yes a proposito is you see the lives that are changing right in front of you and afterwards on Sundays you see five people five brothers and sisters that have raised their hand in is and say yes I I am different I'm different for a reason I'm different because of what happened on Calvary difference that is why we're different accepted that great sacrifice you see five young people give their hearts to the Lord in such a time as this is [Music] then you understand why our pastor sent us it wasn't because of us but I'm glad and I'm thankful for the story content we can be a part of that and I'm so glad as well as you saw my three boys Muchachos coming up here to see what what God has done true in the life of my grandfather in the life of my father in my life and me
