ariel and sister sarai they got married yesterday [Applause] and they'll be um and they'll be getting baptized here at the end of the service too so in del cervicio amen let's let's get right into the word if you would open your scriptures we want to see where the lord takes us today amen we if you can be so kind to turn into your scriptures to hebrews the fifth chapter where do you stand this morning and everyone is asking where do you stand on certain issues everywhere you go where do you stand well the answer is simple it depends on your maturity amen how many believe that we're at the end how many believe that we are that fruit at the top that has been ripening and should have been ripened how many believe that you are a mature son and daughter of god is the state of being fully developed let's see where we go hebrews chapter 5 and verse 12. for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat is necessary for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe meaning he is not mature at all but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age once again how many are of full age sunday that's plenty to see your hands full age means that it's that you're mature even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil foreign your senses have been exercised to discern both good and evil one more scripture hebrews the sixth chapter it's the very next the next chapter watch watch how paul goes in from you should by this time you should be teachers talking about milk and then the meat and then he starts hebrews 6 with this wonderful scripture therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection little teaching here this morning therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ unto perfection the word perfection there is teliotis which means the state of completeness is it comes from the base word talios it means that you're wanting or you lack nothing that you are a grown adult you are mature now we got that out of the way now let's go on and see where we are at as far as maturity yeah how many of you believe that you're once again that you are a mature person let me see the young people because sometimes we think that when we get to the age of 18 somehow some way we think sometimes like that this has been some oh i can't wait till i get to be 18. oh no puerto right it makes us reflect upon our our lives let's be honest with ourselves and let's be honest with god this this morning that's what the holy spirit is after today for us to make an assessment of our maturity and since our emotional development is not necessarily on track with our natural age no necessary necessary because you might be 50 or 60 years old and still not be mature in a lot of things oh it is in the spiritual spiritual that the number of years you've been going to church the number of years that you have been in the message doesn't necessarily reflect our spiritual maturity not necessarily somehow sometimes we're just over ripe sobre maduros let that one sink in for a little bit i've been in the message for 30 40 50 years not equal maturity maybe even that we get married finally that we should be on the cover of mature magazines because we have our first child all of a sudden we we should be mature that doesn't equal maturity either i'm here to try to help you and help myself believe me i get a good gospel whip and whenever the holy spirit comes into the room as i go down this list put on your spiritual and let's see if we're really mature and in what areas we're mature go on this little journey with me let's see really where we're at because we we act like we're real mature let's start with those young people writing notes god bless you immature people are not capable of being quiet you might not like some of these but that's okay the bible says that you must study to be quiet first thessalonians 4 11. james 1 26 santiago if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue no reference but deceiveth his own heart for in many things james 3 2 santiago tresdos in many things we offend all but if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man is perfect and able also to bridle the whole body so it's possible to be perfect don't you get tired of the same old thing from people well nobody's perfect let me see how many of you have ever used that phrase nobody's perfect no we all make mistakes usually the ones that say that are the ones that just made a mistake that's their way of trying to get out of it nobody's perfect but if you can hold your tongue how do you respond to adversity you gotta you gotta bring those questions to yourself do you lash back every time someone tells you something negative negative the way that we respond to things shows a lot about our character it shows a lot about our maturity when someone speaks evil of you nobody needs to answer the question don't be looking at anybody else word how do we respond when someone speaks evil of us usually the immature person the person will gather all that they know this happens in the churches quite frequently i don't think they like this message let me see if i find another message that's okay but i want you to hit home today because we're at the end is that we respond the same way that we did 20 30 years ago in the church that's why he's saying when by now you should be teachers we're having to go back and teach the same things why are we do we still respond the same way has there not been any growth [Music] insulting someone else that doesn't happen with us you're immature immature people don't think about the consequences of their actions why because they don't think of anyone else but themselves isn't eternal life to live for seem so much more outstanding than everyone else's sobres they don't know how to complement someone else they use whatever they can use their success su exito their physical being susan they are anthony stick that's why they all they that's why they only measure themselves up against people that they think are inferior to them and yet in all points it shows them it shows really that they're insecure about themselves are you with me okay making sure again the lord blesses someone with something in the church and right away the immature person wants to compare the media but you should see the one i got praise god and then most people even they don't even say when when they see you with something they would rather see you without the preview and they'll even go as far to say oh well somebody i know has a better one than better truck than that it is all you see across their forehead immaturity and you look at them you're like the i have to look in the mirror first before i what just ask yourself where do i stand in all this because it's always someone else's fault yes even in the church all these things i know you'll say yo yo pastor immature people do not have the ability or the discipline to forgive anyone else immature people are always looking for an excuse immature people are always looking for someone to support them but they do not want to ever support anyone else make the same mistakes over and over and over and over again hello everybody hola why because they're not disciplined enough to do anything about it you're lucky we got a good interpreter he said he wants it to go on the writer states maturity is patient la madures espaciente it can endure without complaining james 1 4 says but let patience have her perfect work santiago but it's not saying that being perfect you'll never make a mistake maturity is perseverance never stop despite the opposition that's against you maturity is humility maturity is dependability keeping your word for you're only as good as your word maturity is to live maturity is to stick with what you started let there be a knowledge just because we know what it takes to be a christian does not make us a christian christian we hear the message the tapes and so forth as a message of the hour does not make us the message and maybe gained a little understanding of maturity do i have your attention a little more now yeah all right let's see where and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job there is none like him i've told you this but i asked my father one day the question how could he be perfect when the perfect sacrifice hadn't come he was perfect to what was required of him at the time and god is telling saying he is perfect upright man to hold your integrity when all hell is coming against you integrity integrity listen closely escuche is the state of being whole or undivided in integro and mature man job was an immature person they question their beliefs every time a tough situation comes oh come on now i'm going to say it again an immature person the person questions their belief any time a tough situation comes in a situation any time someone comes and gives them a better idea they think they just question their belief every time hey yo students here it is today that's not integrity have you considered my servant that's considered there's none like him come imagine the on speaking that about you and i imagine i'm i'm starting to feel pretty good right now it's the state once again of being undivided and therefore to find your purpose in life foreign other than that you're trying to be mature in something you're not called to do puerto rico come to a conclusion a conclusion why so many people don't like to empty out when we talk about about the holy spirit and and the new birth and and getting filled with the holy ghost we don't realize that first of all we got to empty ourselves out no no you gotta empty yourself out first you know and even though you empty out and you feel clean but a lot of times white people don't like to empty out because there's a certain feeling of loneliness that comes with it did you get that i'm going to say it again there's a certain feeling of loneliness when you're emptying it out you see the feeling of loneliness though now listen young people get this many times with loneliness comes loneliness is not necessarily a bad thing it is if you dwell there too long but loneliness is actually could actually be a good thing brother brother coyote because it was in elohim's loneliness when that prompted him to think about you and i yellow than me i'm going to say it again it was in elohim's loneliness that got him to begin to think no i but you got to make sure that when loneliness that's why it's so important that when loneliness hits it's important to do something about it don't just sit there i don't know life is just not you're already in in no man's land it's then that we must fill ourselves up but the loneliness is actually the deep calling i can't talk to you when there's a lot of noise [Music] that's what we're aiming for to grow to come to a spiritual maturity problem is is that we don't like the process let's see what luke 180 says lucas this is talking about john there's something real simple but you're talking about maturity watch and the child not only did he grow but he whacked strong in spirit how many of us here don't don't just look this as babies like the little unborn natural baby look at yourself maybe sometimes we're babies in church for years but then amen hire your neighbor then he grew up the child grew and waxed strong in spirits and was in the deserts yes you know what the word desert there means it's a solitary place solo no one likes the desert very much do they know they like in the mountains and in the ocean over here [Music] through the sexual relation between a man and a woman sexuality in all manner just like you and i watch and in favor with god and man must go through that process brother jimmy the other day i had him make a teaching for brother or brother morton taking on the apostles generation the apostles generation would be till the end of the when you study a generation it can be 40 years it can be 70 years it can be i mean write this down the holy spirit through him made this statement that just wowed me how long is a generation is it a certain amount of time he said no no for the gentile gentiles it's not based on time it's based on maturity espacado in la madres my that's a mouthful yes israel was given a specific amount of time are appointed to you and your people daniel but to the gentiles there's no time but he's waiting for maturities he wants to see that much that fruit matures he wants to see the pride tree come to a complete maturity wait brother says yes it's based on maturity for us established how many mature people do we have here we're in trouble brother alan we're in trouble how many mature people do we have here you i know some of you are like algonos i'm gonna raise it by faith raise your hand by faith i see the end product he sees the end product the maturing process el proceso de madures is the process that the revelation goes through in order to take us back to where we came from it's been the maturing of the harvest that's why he says should we go and take the tears out no because when when it's still immature or it's still young the wheat and the tears look exactly the same let them grow together and these 6 000 years has been the maturing of the harvest now the seed has become a seed itself it went back to the blossom from blossom to the fruit where they they said florida flores and it's the gathering time now the harvest time all the great things that started las grandes cosas and the antichrist that started in genesis el antichristo campus i'm going to believe that that's speaking of us it's right on the top esther and sima but there's a danger of being but i'm going to say it again there's a danger of that of that fruit that's on top i'm the danger is that those birds love to go pick the fruit that's on the top brother be careful there's some maybe some birds poking at your head the last church age is here he says he is coming to full mature allegations paradox it's a bright tree it's jesus was the tree of life from the garden of eden how else could we reach maturity jesus christ would come to dwell in us jesus christ it is the rising of the sun the waving of the shift what was the sheath the one that come to maturity first la que vino madures primero come on church who's being waived here i'm not going to guess too much of that because that's one of our panels we have coming out panels we could maybe prove began foreign it was the first one to come to maturity and it was waved as a memorial i'm going to say it again believing that the rest of griendo the rest problem then many times we try to understand god with her now i'm going to speak for myself corinthians 13 11 tells us when i was a child when i was immature maduro how many of you were born mature and maduros same way in the spiritual right [Music] when i was a child you had a nino i did things backwards you always say las cosas paul's telling the corinthians i spake as a child first i understood as a child and i thought as a child i did things backwards oh yeah yeah sometimes you get thoughts and like i better not say that so when i was a child i spake first as a child man i shouldn't have said that but when i became a maduro i became perfect perfecto the process of it i fought first spencer follow him thought for hello then he understood the very plan that he we should have kept our mouth shut and i began to see things in the word ephesians 4 11 through 14. and he gave some apostles when did he take that out of the church see where he gave some but i don't see where he took them some prophets oh i know more prophets not major prophets without this for the perfecting or maturing of the saints i i i mean i'm not making this stuff up no invention the maturing of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ but now we should be teachers we're still having to be taught how else do you want to get there unto a mature man measure of the stature of that word stature means maturity of the maturity of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children or immature but carried 3 15 says philippe says you want me to go to the next one i'm like oh oh that's for you guys philip 3 15. let us therefore as many as be perfect or mature and if anything ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you is that you all had a good time the other day and fishbowl those who don't know is this bowl and they have a bunch of questions and they pull them out and then they discuss it and like anything else you guys tell me if i'm wrong yes like anything else you always seem to get two sides and the first thing you do is first thing you do is that let's see where she stands so they got into some good subjects good stuff anything from you know how much makeup should i put on or can i put on or not and you hear these questions first thing everybody does what should we do or not do is it wrong or not it is immaturity imadures it doesn't matter what the subject is someone told brother tommy one time again foreign i ain't going to get into those those things anyway but after a while it's like you can pick and choose whatever you want to do or don't do well because look for loopholes but don't try to get everyone else to live to your standards your revelation you hold on to that yes that's pretty clear young people this is cloud well well look what it says here bueno what are you looking for and the worst thing about it is that when you see who's on the other side of the aisle now you don't want to talk to them immature immaturity let's grow up a little bit poco but i let's go on because then we get into little side things and then what's your take he's going to turn his church into manhood now we have played and frolicked like children but now we're coming in childish things who wants to go with let's go to maturity perfection now vamos al maduro can bitterly disagree with anyone against them god's honest truth in me that would hold it against them because they see it or don't see it like me but sure i'm going to talk to them and you think you're all grown up yeah revelations 1 14 his head and his hairs were white and you read that with me in english his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow in the exposition of the seven church ages exposition brother brown says john first notices juan primero and mentions the whiteness of his hair it was white blanco and his brightest snow this was not because of his age oh no no the brilliantly white hair does not signify age no significa like that but experience maturity madurese and wisdom means so when he says nothing short of perfect love will be there but without perfect faith you ain't going to be there either what is perfect faith mature faith i don't even want to get into that at the age of maturity he had he goes now you can go and let my people go oh what happened you can go deliver my people reach the age of maturity because you want to do what god's called you to do it's time you go back to the back side of the desk conversation with him we refuse to mature the church is in its complete maturity now that's the evening messenger 1963. it is in its complete maturity now estancia sometimes we think we've accomplished a little something and then i hear this from our founding pastor because when we think we've done a lot and we've left our kindred gladly some have left their kindred kicking and fighting and screaming familia but i want to know i'm closing now there's too much to say we'll we'll continue it next sunday but here was abraham he had done everything he had been asked to do where do you stand our founding pastor he mr pastor he preached this message the final test where do you stand up we got lots of revelations no matter what you do lord i'll bless you yes you're an important location everything's going good it's easy to say that you want to find out how mature you really are in contract [Music] winds blow against [Music] long as we got our spouse there oh yeah some of the ones that that that are not appreciated are widows judas maybe someone that their their husband has left them and they're the ones that are least appreciated they sometimes feel like a like a lesser of citizens and i know you've loved me here and there yes i know you've done this for me i know you've done this but i want to make sure that what you have is worthy of the promises that's what god is doing this morning he wants something make sure yeah what you have is worthy of the promise he left us all your qualities will be determined everything he wants to make sure we're worthy to sit with him can you imagine going through a test where god would say now now now this day i know that you love me it is he offered a sacrifice there on the altar oppression abraham that's where the final test comes that's spiritual maturity is spiritual as we finish i'm going to ask brother will to come in you know god still has gifts in the church and he uses people you lose he'll use and i want brother enzo to come here you're okay the lord deals with him a lot in dreams and things more and more he's becoming more more open more to what what god is that shows him to help us establish but i want him to tell you a little bit about what our pastor has shared with a few of the brothers that uh this yeah fire was up here you understand what i was saying i was standing right over here on the side and uh they can get ready to play play that brother well then um there was a row of angels all at one end to the choir all the way to the other side [Music] [Music] i could just be the outlier [Applause] became more visible [Music] at that point right there [Music] god bless you guys [Music] [Applause] that at that specific point they stopped singing it's a tiempo he's here to bring a maturity god permitted but that should give you more more courage [Music] to come up here and sing with all your heart the [Music] and cometh down from the father this morning whether you can see something or not is neither here nor there whatever i'm done with all this childishness i'm done i want to grow to a maturity with god i want to be what he what he wants me to be here you're willing to let all this childish stuff die out now would you raise your hand that's me brother es me hermano sometimes i'm hot and sometimes i'm cool oh no
