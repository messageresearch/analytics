defeated oh it's the church I oh Lord and is f by the hands of the Lord I'm talking about the church in the Book of Revelation build on the Rock God of foundation it's been through the blood and it's been through the fire oh one of these days we're going to move move up higher is [Music] Lord amen how about another one a mighty one to the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] amen how many belong to that church [Music] how many belong to that church hallelujah hallelujah don't you love the Lord Jesus tonight amen God bless each and every one of you it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight how many are happy amen amen God bless you you ever heard the term he was shaking in his [Music] boots I'm literally shaking in my boots he's here amen amen let's read a scripture real quick we don't have you standing for too long and so what's going to be found in Leviticus 17 chapter 17 verse 14 for it is the life of All Flesh the blood of it is for the life thereof therefore I say unto the children of Israel ye shall eat the blood of no manner of Flesh for the life of All Flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut [Music] off amen you can be seated so we just read that the life of the flesh is the blood right that's the life of the flesh right so how many knows that you are at the mercy of the blood right so every single person that's sitting here tonight your body lives at the mercy of the blood all right so let's naturally speak amen so your blood provides nourishments to every cell of your body right now we can get into the medical terms which I have them all here right but uh I I ain't no doctor right I'm just I'm just a little a backwoodsman uneducated backwoodsman there all right so some of the words I would probably mess them up I I was reading them I I came into church a minute ago and I told my son I said how do you say this word and he told me and I forgot already what the word was all right so so I'm not going to get into the medical term but you ask me anything about a horse well I can tell you anything about him right I could be a veterinarian an equin veterinarian right but I'm not a medical doctor right so your blood provides nourishments to every cell of your body so you have red blood cells in your body and it flows through every every part of the body right so it provides for you so your blood tonight as you're sitting there it's providing for you life the life is in the blood amen the life the is the the blood is the flesh the is the life of the flesh so it's providing right now for you provid oxygen to your your bloodstream right it's it's applying it's it's applying amino acids nitrogen sodium potassium right right sister if you're looking at me and you're just staring at me I'm like okay make sure I'm so it's it's providing these these nourishments for your body everything that you need to operate inside of yourself or to live is provided to you through the blood okay that's pretty simple right so not only is your blood A supplier it also cleanses right so it's a cleanup it's kind of like being the Milkman and the garbage man all in the same truck right and the garbage man yeah it provides you what you need and then it just comes right behind and starts cleaning up all the toxins your body now what happens if you if you cut off the supply of blood to your one of your extremities right so you you how many have ever gotten their their blood pressure checked right right and they they start to squeeze on your arm right and all of a sudden you start feeling like a a a stinging feeling going through your body right well what what's happening what's happening to the body when the blood flow gets cut off right it starts to build up toxins right [Music] it starts causing pain and if you if you hold it there long enough you're probably gonna scream out right so no no matter how tough you are right so when the when the blood supply is cut off to the body there's pain right for many times we live in pain because we stop the flow of blood to the body right we we suffer through through toxins we allow toxins to build up inside the body without allowing the blood to flow through the body so it's a supplier it's a it's a supplier of Life the blood supplies it it cleanses right and it's also has power right the blood also has power so inside of you right now is a warrior running through the through through through your bloodstream because the the biggest uh uh threat to human beings a human being is is not war it's not an atomic bomb right it the the the greatest threat to you right now in your body is bacteria and viruses right that that's the biggest threat to you right now so as soon as your body because as you have these red blood cells there are also white blood cells in your body and as soon as your your your your body as soon as it detects a virus or a bacteria right away it goes to war it goes straight into battle right and it starts to call on these uh antibodies right antibodies right and so these antibodies and that's where I'm not going to get into because like I said I I'll mess it all up I I I used to laugh at my dad sometimes he would be talking right and then he would just say share and so that sounds like let's share something like what it talking about Shar and then and then I you mean a chair yeah that's what I just said a chair chair I'm like this guy who's never been close to Mexico and he's got that an accent on right and so I would probably do the same thing right so that's the natural okay so we got that out of the way right okay so now let's open up our scriptures to Mark 10:1 17 and it's a familiar scripture that we've all read and we read many times right it was Jesus and the Rich Young Ruler and when he had gone forth into the way there came one running and kned to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I might inherit eternal life now notice right there notice right there that uh as we've heard many times there was nothing that he could do right but the scripture we're going to find out doesn't say that right right away we we we we get real religious right we oh oh you can't depend on yourself nothing that you could do done right but Jesus is going to answer it for him so there's something that can be done tonight now how many are seeking eternal life right so half of us here are seeking eternal [Music] life the other half have the cuff on their hand on their arm and it's got a lot of pressure on it so let let's just let off the pressure amen so how many here want eternal life okay so Jesus answered unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and [Music] mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him so I want you to just get this is to me this is awesome here right look look at this version of of of the scripture here he tells Jesus uh these laws uh I've obeyed since my youth and it says here in 21 Jesus fixed his gaze upon the man with tender love he fixed his gaze on him right and that was Jesus beholding him loved him and he said unto him one thing thou lackest one thing thou lackest he was asking what must I do to inh inherit eternal life Jesus gave him part of the key right you know the Commandments okay I I've done that part one thing thou lackest what was that one thing that he lacked right okay one thing thou lackest go thy way you want eternal life tonight go thy way uh go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up your cross follow me so he just gave him uh observe all the law so that one step right and then he says you lack one thing okay I I lack one thing tell me what that one thing is go thy way sell whatever thou Hast give to the poor so that you can have treasure right so it he was telling him now now now there's got to be a transfer of the heart right he said uh you got to lot of possessions but we're not going to get into the possessions just yet right away our minds he had a lot of possessions he had uh maybe he had the finest cars 4,500 foot home well history says that he was a land owner he was a land owner right so he owned a lot of land right and so we're not going to get in the possessions just yet but he said basically have a transfer of heart you need a heart now remember the life of the flesh is the blood and the heart is the main organ where the blood pumps so he's saying now have a transfer of heart the reason he said that so that you'll have treasure in heaven he already had treasure on Earth he had a great church to go to he had all the law he had maybe a lot of friends in church he had all these good things right but were your treasure where your heart is there your treasure is Jesus said transfer your treasure from Earth so that you'll have it in heaven so get a blood transfusion it was a transfer of heart not possessions so the greatest possession that you have right is is the possession of your nature right you say oh I got a lot of possessions I got I got a car I got a house I got a good job I got this and that no your greatest possession that you have right now is your nature you own that you're the owner the bank doesn't hold the note on that one the Bible says we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking Lies We own that nature right so that that that's the nature that that's that's what we own but there has to be a change a change Paul's going to tell us over in Philippians if we if we turn over to it it says over here in Philippians if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any Batts of Mercy fulfill the my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord and one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves so it I'm gonna speak it plainly to you so Paul's saying so I'm asking you my friends that you be joined together in perfect Unity with one heart one passion and United in love walk together with one harmonious purpose and you will fill my heart with unbounded joy be free from Pride verse three let nothing be done through Strife or vain in verse five let this mind be in you let this mind be in you what must I do to inherit eternal life let this mind so the mind of a man is a possession right your mind is a possession but when there's a transfer of the heart he says let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus so he's saying and consider the example that Jesus the anointed one has set before us let his mindset become your motivation so God he has many possessions right right away we oh we can't have no possessions got to sell all that we have no it's a transfer of heart it's a changing of the mind he said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus that being in the form of God and man thought it not robbery to be equal with God so God he had a lot of possessions the greatest possession that he had was Elohim he was self-existing of himself so many times we say in the beginning God created no God did create nothing God did not create anything brother Bram says you got to watch the words now you got to watch these words these English words when they're translated God didn't create nothing he said in the beginning Elohim a possession that God had his greatest possession was self-existing of himself he created the world he created light he brought all these things into existence but he transferred his possession to become God he transferred it to become an object of worship it was a transferring of the heart I can be Elohim by myself what good does that do me if I have attributes inside of me that I want to express so I got to transfer that possession lack you lack one thing s all that thou has give to the poor transfer your treasure and take up your cross but God he had another possession he he he was God himself there with himself now he had angels to worship him he became God right and he gave up that possession we hear it many times imagine if I was God if I was God I would just do this I'd just do that right right we we all say that right don't don't look at me like a dear in the headlight right oh especially Hunters right man if I was God I would just put a big old 400 class right God send me right we do that right or just me all right so so God he became Christ he he went from Elohim gave up that possession became God and then now he becomes Christ so it looks like he's coming down the scale right and and so now he becomes Christ the Bible says it was God in Christ reconciling himself back to the world right to the world to himself God in Christ it was God in Christ Jesus the man so he became a God man what a possession right he became a God man that's a possession what a possession right but but we we're we're looking for eternal life though right we we're looking for another possession well I thought if I had God or Elohim I was I had eternal life right I I thought if I had the law I I had eternal life but he found out he lacked one thing what did he lack what was it that he lacked that one thing what must I do to inherit eternal life right so Jesus says we just read in Leviticus right now it was said do not eat the blood of the flesh right but Jesus told this Rich Young Ruler don't eat the blood of the flesh life of the flesh right and so he said do not eat it the scripture said that and so all of a sudden Jesus says I am the bread of life that came down from heaven right right so the Rich Young Ruler he he didn't he didn't stick around long enough right but Jesus said uh cuz there was a lot of people that stuck around they they stuck around but Jesus began to explain to them and he says I am the bread of life that came down from heaven and he who eats me e of this bread has everlasting life right what must I do to inherit eternal life what do I got to do to inherit eternal life tonight I got to have communion I have to have communion Jesus said unless you eat the flesh the son of man or drink his blood you have no life in you no life this Rich Young Ruler he was looking for life he wanted eternal life he had everything else but Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood so the Orthodox Jews that were following Jesus as soon as he said that no s no way what does he want us to do be cannibals what does he think we are vampires eat his flesh and drink his blood that's gruesome that's barbaric the Bible says drink can eat the Flesh of no blood we're out of here right and the Bible says that perceiving his disciples knowing what they were thinking inside of him this this message that we preach is hard so if you like to wear kids gloves kids gloves Don't Preach this message right because this message is for grown-ups it's hard you're going to say things that are hard and it's not to throw at nobody it's like brother Abraham said trying to help people brother Braham says if you see your child on the street you're not going to go over there all put come on me come on honey all right you're not going to do that right so Jesus said does this offend you does this one thing that was lacking one thing that you lacked to eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood does this offend you it offended them they were offended so sometimes we're going to get offended right right but how many peers do we have in the crowd tonight Peters because he turned to them then because the 70 walked with him no more but he said to the 12 he says will you go also right and the one that gets so much talked about or FL or or or he he was he spoke before he thought Peter was this I want to see the day when we see Peter I want to see these bold people I talked about Peter I want to see that right Peter said to whom shall we go to whom shall we go only you have the words of eternal life Jesus said he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood he have eternal life what must I do you lack one thing to eat my flesh and drink my blood that is to say to let my life live in you it's got to be living in you my blood because the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit they are spirit and they are life they are life it's eternal life Jesus is to my spirit what my blood is to my body if my blood if it supplies me Jesus provides my spirit he provides my spirit he is everything that my spirit needs Jesus if my blood is a cleanser Jesus for my spirit is the cleer he cleanses my life the Bible says we are cleansed in the precious blood of Jesus we are cleansed tonight Jesus that one thing he lacked was the transfer of the Life of Christ Living inside of him you can go to church all your life you can give all you want give to the poor but unless the life of Jesus Christ the blood of God flows inside of you there is no transfer of there's no transfer so if so if my blood is a warrior if my blood is a warrior Jesus is the all time he's the all time Undisputed all time Undisputed Champion he's a great warrior The Greatest Warrior that can wipe out any sickness can wipe out any toxin and not like my own blood because if my antibody comes in contact with a virus because antibodies they have memories right and as soon as they see a virus when they recognize that virus they have a memory they say oh I know who you are I know where you're coming from I know your serial number and all of a sudden he goes and tells the other antibodies hurry up start creating start fighting let's go to battle right but if a virus enters into my body that's not recognized by these antibodies the Warriors they going to go tell the other ones okay there's this virus I don't know what it is never seen it before when you start making some some antibodies but there's a lapse of time in there there's a there's a little lapse of time and you can't create the antibodies fast enough you cannot because it's fighting an unrecognized enemy today you will not go nowhere without a pastor because there's a lapse of time there and you might know this book frontwards and backwards you might read brother brandham frontwards and backwards but there's a lapse of time in there there has to be an antibody injected into you that has already affected another person in order for it to get its memory back that memory is the mind of Christ that memory goes all the way back to Elohim self-existing of himself in the beginning eloh in the beginning eloh El it was Elohim and then God being one with his family transferring himself to Christ the God man the god man and the Bible says that this man Jesus this man every knee every knee shall bow to the name of Jesus all of Heaven name name has been transferred to Jesus God man God before the cross it was before the cross Jesus what did he do he he denied himself he he he he he died to he became a he he died a criminal's death he gave himself he gave his life he gave his life for us the reason I'm here is because there was a man there was a man that gave his life that had gotten a transfer he received a transfer that's why people when they say oh hear the tapes hear the tapes every one of them I I hear them all every day I hear a tape but but what about and people say well brother Bram is my my my pastor I'll do respect to brother Bram I'll do respect but there was another man there there was a man that was transferred I didn't get this on my own I didn't receive this on my own there had to be a transfer of heart I would be a disgrace if I didn't give my life that would been a disgrace to to my to my to brother Tommy that that would be a disgrace that he he gave his life that that he gave his life for me and then I would say I would say I don't have a message today in other words you're you're just like the Rich Young roer or I would be like the Rich Young roer because to have eternal life is to live for others so in other words the Rich Young laer he was saying he was saying living for others doesn't concern me taking up a cross and dying that that doesn't concern me let's think about it that that would be a disgrace that would be a disgrace i i people I I I don't understand how how how people say or or or ministers say I don't have a message today you don't have a message today what were you doing that now that's just me now now forgive me I love you right but but what are you doing I I can't think of one scripture in a morning that a message don't come I I didn't I didn't ask to be a minister I I I I didn't I didn't choose to that that I remember of according to the prophet I chose it right but I I don't have no remembrance of it right I I I didn't ask for this God just gave it to me all I know is that one day I was in sin I was walking one way and all of a sudden something happened where I I I just turned around H it had nothing to do with it it was God that was holding me and then he just turned me around I was the chiefest of Sinners I was I was the worst and violist among you but Come Ye Sinners Come Ye all you Sinners Jesus blood Jesus blood can cleans you it'll cleanse the viest of sinners it'll take you from the mud and pick you up and guess what it's going to it's going to uh express its life through you so unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood unless you have communion you have no life in you now there was a talking about Peter Peter said he said Thou Art the Christ Peter said when Jesus asked will you leave too Peter stepped up and he said where are we gonna go right and then Jesus said whom shall we go and then Jesus said uh if any man leave his father and mother and all his house and [Music] job and Peter said we we've left it all Lord right so Peter right he was in The Garden of Gethsemane and and they went to apprehend Jesus and Peter took out his sword and and cut him and you can type that however you want to what it's basically telling you is that Peter had something different about him and so one night think about this there's 12 disciples 12 so just take 12 amongst you right 12 amongst right they're they're all in a boat and you know how how we are you know you know how we are or you know how I am right oh man went through such trial nobody has problem wow there nobody knows my trouble right so there was these 12 men they were in a boat they were in the dark all 12 of them were in the dark it was dark for all all 12 the waves they were they were high the waves in our life they were hard for they were high for all 12 of them and then the ship began to rock it was it was rocking for all 12 of them and then all of a sudden all 12 of them saw the same thing they all saw the same vision they all saw the same thing but Peter was the only one that decided he said is that you Lord what about the other 12 it was one Peter he said is that you Lord if it's you B me to come they were all in the same boat they were in the same trial it was rough for all of them but Peter was the only one that night that walked on water he was the only one and they were in the same situation tonight we can be in the same building have the same message see the same vision but some of us aren't walking on water some of us aren't walking on water why because it takes a transfer it takes a changing of the Mind a change of the mind now it was given a Chinese scholar in closing it was he was he was given a copy of the New Testament how how many heard this no no this Chinese scholar chines he he he was given a copy of the New Testament right and and and he said hey would you would you read this read it out and uh uh he he had read the Quran he he had read the vas he he had read the all the sacred books and and so the man came back to him the true story and so the man comes back to him and he says did did you read the New Testament he said I did I read it all the way through so what was the most amazing thing that you you read in [Music] there and the man says Oh I thought he was going to say the the the most amazing thing that I read was that Jesus was born of a virgin right and I thought to myself well no no no maybe maybe maybe maybe he's gonna say that a man died and resurrected that that was the greatest thing that that that that maybe that he was going to say that he had ever read and he said so so what did you find out was the most amazing thing and and and he said over in Ephesians 2 he says I I I found the most amazing thing that I I've ever read if you can give me Ephesians 2 in closing I got to find it I I got I got to read it from my Bible sometimes I get too excited this excites me and then and then I end up saying share as I get excited and if I had one of the Sunday school's children is it in English like my my grandson says we're going to go visit certain people the kids speak Spanish he said the most amazing thing that I've ever read was and ye who ha he quickened who was dead in trespasses and sin where in times past you walked according to the course of the world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience and he says but what what really got me was the end of that chapter he said now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens and stay with the Saints and the household of God he said I've read the Quran I've read all the sacred books but I've never read where a man's God where a man's God makes the man his habitation so my question is does your God does your God does he live in you are you feasting on his flesh are you
