a chance to talk about these meetings I just worked out on my schedule to be here and I know this is my first time here but I trust it won't be my last name amen praise the Lord uh so the the pastor let me know about the inspiration or the theme of the meetings and anytime a pastor has a theme I try to do all I can to stay underneath that anointing amen and I believe that the the Lord knows what

family is spirit and Truth Tabernacle you know the father's seeking those that will worship Him in spirit and Espirito and in truth our Glory Gloria and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them praise the Lord amen Joshua chapter 8. we will start reading at verse 16. the Bible says and all the people that were in I were called together to pursue after them and they pursued after Joshua and were drawn away from the city and there was not a man left in I or Bethel that went not out after Israel and they left the city open and pursued after Israel Hombres Israel and the Lord said unto Joshua stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward I the eye will give it into thine hand and Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the City Anthem says praise the Lord amen let's just have a word of prayer uh Lord Jesus we're grateful for the opportunity to be able to read the word of God but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to make the word live for our day so God speak to us through your words take control of everything take control of every action may you be glorified can you be magnified there's magnification in this place father we give the service to you in Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you can be seated praise the Lord amen so uh the theme of the meeting is the amen and I wanted to use for a title it is praise the name of the Lord It's time for eye to die yes I've preached this sermon back home and uh when I preached it back home I had a different title and as we were fellowshipping today at breakfast and he was saying uh he was preaching some sermons on worship and in one of those sermons he made a commentary it says uh often times in families uh maybe the parents uh have something against the children maybe the us parents have something against each other and oftentimes we fail to realize that is a spirit behind that yeah that is causing the people to be separated and then we begin to attack the person rather than attacking the real problems and brother Caleb said we have to find the cause and when he said find the cause I said that was my sermon title when I preached it at home he said I knew I was in the right channel to fit with the things and if you have not come to a death I pray that this would be the day that you can establish foreign [Applause] and I want to say this to you uh this evening may be acceptable in society and sometimes it's acceptable to you but it's still not acceptable to God hallelujah hallelujah we don't want to walk in the permissive will of God we want a 12 daily amen amen when you come to a stop sign you have to yield amen and understand that yielding it's for your protection it is amen and I want to I want to just inject this the Bible tells us lay aside foreign [Music] oh no I asked my church to uh pause and ask a question yes Lord show me something that I can lay aside this year and I want to pause here today just to give you a chance to say that same prayer to God lord show me something that I can lay aside something that would allow you and I I'll go draw closer together I'm pausing yes for you to think about it but like you said Lord what can I lay aside closer together as you're yielding you died John 12 SE there were some bricks and I won't I won't read for the sake of time oh I I usually keep a little timer so I Don't Preach too long but I forgot to set the time so that was free everything I just said but in John 12. express some Greeks that were coming to worship at the feast they encountered Phillips and uh they they made a statement to Philip Felipe we would see Jesus hallelujah hallelujah Philip went to Andrew and both of them together went to Jesus and these men that travel very far I heard about Jesus but they finally got to the spot where they could see them for themselves we don't want to see anybody else but we want to see Jesus and when they got to Jesus who made the statement praise God in verse 23. he says the hours that the son of man personal [Music] the Bible goes on to say he that loving his life shall lose it and he that hate this life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life eternal brother Brandon told a story he actually called him an old dorky and uh that's I'm just giving you the quote please don't go around and say words but it's just a quote I'm just giving you the quotes this man had an experience with God recognized that he had an experience there was something different about this man is realized the difference and it says you know I gotta have that same Holy Ghost experience if God could change then I know he can change me and it's in the beginning it says I want that same Holy Ghost and we are a design we are dessert that we see in the book of animals yes [Applause] [Music] he says he says you can't get it here the boss said okay if we can't come to the Corn Crib let's go up to the Halos he said maybe I can get it up there he says Moe's walked into the Halo you can't give it up here it says we went to the Corn Crib take me where I can give the Holy Ghost he said follow me this is a single man and he rolled up his pants you can get it right here what was he trying to tell about yeah you've got to be willingness [Applause] brother random says this in the message it says anything's got to die before you can get life and life only comes by death you take a grain in a corn and you plant it except that grain of corn will lay there and Minos que is out of that rotten mess all the human-made psychology beat out of them by the Holy Spirit to their rotten to their own ideas then they will receive the Holy Ghost when you can get all the Creeds and stuff brought it out of you yes he said that's all for bad it gets fail but that's the only way I know to say it you understand it till it rocks to a place amen where they're dead as I thought about that quote amen I thought of the in the scripture let's be through that Naaman was not willing to his thoughts he wanted healing but in order to receive healing he had to be willing to die he heard the testimony of a living God for the servant girl she spoke of a prophet in Israel oftentimes we have people a man that's not willing to die to their denominational thoughts listen to the thoughts of a problem if you're gonna understand the words you have to look through [Music] seven times and here's the thing yesterday naming cocked an attitude and I'm here to tell you tonight you must die to your attitude you must die to your thoughts and ideas [Music] foreign [Music] come on Amen in a man you had a really bad attitude they said no no I said I finally got some men around here the man said look if he would have told you to go here yeah well why don't you just listen to what the prophet is here down there to the Jordans do you want to be healed yes yes I know name him do you want to be set free yes do you want to be delivered yes baby sticks one foot into water and maybe he's holding his nose then he goes down one time and it comes up that's it I'm out of here and his men would tell him he says name it my mind not one time no no seven times goes down twice Damon come on the prophet says I don't care how you feel names I don't care maybe your skin is not feeling well you feel so dirty I feel like you gotta go take a bath don't feel right goes down to six times one more time goes down to seven times and it comes up clearly man pray that this will be somebody seven times amen was alive too he left it in the truck he died foreign let me just read a quote here out of why brother Branham makes this uh statement oh it's a new birth they are afraid of that the new birth is like any other person it's a mess I don't care what kind of birth it is it's a mess is a mess it'll make you do things but out of that mess comes alive [Music] that's it it's us he says out of a mess Comes Alive comes out of a mess life comes out of death except the corner we except okay to the ground and die guys [Music] bring forth the new birth of glory and Praises of God that make him active it changes his nature changes his life changes his motives objective [Music] you know there's a little video passing around article that people are reading about this revival that's happening in Kentucky and uh and the students are going to school yeah just worshiping with their hands lifted uh but as you see him worshiping they come in Worship in short pants and it's one thing to come that way but it's another thing to stay that way [Applause] so a real Revival where have you changed your objectives [Music] Hallelujah there was another scripture out of Genesis 12. and I'll just quickly uh read and refer to okay now uh Genesis 12 in Genesis Thou shalt a bless foreign hallelujah hallelujah amen as the Lord has spoken to him and lot went with him and Abraham Abram was 75 years old when he departed out of harassment yeah but um and Abram took Sarai his wife and a lot of his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered Allah and the souls that they had gotten Iran and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they came here and Abram passed through the uh through the land unto the place of shechem Unto the plane of Mora and the Canaanite was then in the land will I give this land is where Abraham ends up here first he had to obey God he had to die out to some oh my ideas and he followed God by faith and notice where it ends up in verse and he removed from dense unto a mountain on the east of Beth Bethel illegal and Pitch this tip having Bethel on the west east I want us to follow something in the scripture and before we get there I just want to make one comment about Abraham leaving amen haran and then going to this place that God called him brother Brandon made a statement he says we're fine you cannot be blessed and cannot do nothing he says and God cannot do nothing for you till you completely obey him I want to say that again you cannot be blessed Abraham did not receive His blessings until he actually disconnected from life you know I want to tell you somebody's got some friends in our life that are hindering us from receiving our blessings some of us have a career means more trust in our relationship with God [Music] there are a lot of things that come into our lives and sometimes it replaces God yeah this is but I'm here to tell you this afternoon it is get it I'm not we look at Abraham brother Brandon made a statement out of the message Abraham and his seat after him he says separate yourself from your Kindred from all your Associates come out of the pool room come away from the things of the world God calls for total separation Abraham because that's what he called Abraham they are things of the world that we have to Die Young lay aside every sin and every week that's always I want us to just kind of follow something here in Scripture we're reading from The Book of Joshua now there's a couple things that we need to understand first of all there was uh the children of Israel walking through the Wilderness for 40 years and God began to bring them into the promised land after 40 years and the very first battle that they would have in the promise place would be the battle in Jericho hallelujah hallelujah and I love the way God does things when God brings you to various battles he often gives you different strategies to overcoming that battle as they face Jericho amen God gave them a strategy and in this strategy he says walk around the walls of Jericho go one time around Milwaukee seven times foreign [Music] [Music] tell the people don't say a word but when you beat them see what happens then on the seventh time Joshua told the people and the people let out a great job that the world came down and it was a mighty move everybody saw the supernatural wow they were in the mystery there was one man I was not moved by the superman was moved by Babylonian government the thing that impressed him okay foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] so you have to bring your thoughts on the subjections [Music] [Applause] his name meant trouble significa problema this Great Mighty manifestation the walls have come down Supernatural God but how could I get the Babylonians I got a question what banquet e what is it okay vento that Aiken could go to and where the Babylonians he was an Israelite era is Right could he have come out with the Babylonian government and say everybody look at me he had something in his tent then he is that he couldn't even wear and he said yes how many sisters [Music] whatever [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] amen ain't gonna let you pull me like that brother Brandon make some statements about these things and I want you to I want you to get it foreign here's a statement out of the message adoption part 2. brother random said Remember the only way that Israel ever lost a man is When sin got in the campus that's the only way we could ever lose a victory is for Santa is something wrong somewhere when Aiken stole that way and that Babylonian government sin was in the camps and the battle went wrong I want to just inject one thing here I'll try to read the scripture for you a little bit later when they went to Jericho they weren't supposed to take anything what that represented was that was the the first battle and all the spoil was to go to God it was the first battle hallelujah hallelujah it's time for us because the same way brother random says you give me this spotless church tonight perfectly in the promise of God with the holy ghost walking in the spirit challenge any disease [Music] or anything that there is every Joe Louis there is in the country with all of its infidelity and all of the unbelievers to bring in his sickness or Affliction In This Storm God gave the promise only sin of unbelief can keep it away it goes on in this quote yes there's where the church is failing today on that walk [Music] [Music] without even getting Maria [Applause] foreign Miracle with the walls coming down the first battle was Jericho but the Second Battle so I well I yo and they fail when they were trying to conquero brother Brandon said the greatest enemy it's William Brown It's William Branham so can I tell you your husband sues your wife is your children yeah man true after they went to fight I this place and the uh the soldiers told Joshua we don't really overcome this with no problems and they went up there is [Music] [Music] they begin to fast [Music] and then they begin to bring people one by one what happened bacon again tell us what happened you know remember when the wall fell down I saw a little witch and I saw some garments they weren't selling that in Israel You Realize by you taking that again where are these things buried in my tent is all these belongings [Music] if he would have been willing to die to himself he would not have been killed by somebody this is why it's so important is after he made the confession he was killed now I want to just show you something in scripture go to Joshua eight and verse Uno Bible says the Lord said unto Joshua yes see after they got rid of it now they can go back into battle hey yes take all the people who are with me see I have given into the hands hallelujah hallelujah don't be afraid to rise [Music] look at verse two verses our distance forget this statement only the spoil thereof loses for a pray unto yourself notice this because if Aiken would have waited he would have had to spoil for free he didn't have to steal the time [Music] speaking to many acres the blessings of God [Applause] now God gives a different strategies when they marched around Jericho it was walk around the wall seven uh six days one time on six days but on the seventh seven times but now in this battle against we're not marching around walls lady and Ambush for the city behind it God uses a different strategy and and I won't take time to read it but you know when you get home tonight this this new strategy is Joshua gets to gather the Army and they begin to move at night foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord he says I want to encourage them get up and move at night get the Army together they said they're camps and they did it at night starts to begin to give instructions I'm gonna take a few men with me the others praise God Amen so Joshua they were waiting in the sunrise [Music] [Applause] and yeah [Applause] when he turned the spear on eyes the soldiers that were laying in Waiting ran into the city they burned down the city and when the king of our terms [Music] sometimes it looks like the devil has you surroundings [Applause] [Applause] turn the word on yourself oftentimes we spend so much time much of this is trying to get a moat out of somebody else's eyes we don't see the big two by four I don't know it's time for eyes to die I'll read one more quote this is out of the message Jehovah jirehide program says when God Saves a man it is now at the bottom it's got everything the name of Jesus Jesus wrote on it at the bottom of the checkbook whatever you're asking my name Abraham's C believes that just fill out the check and send it in the deposit has been made it's in the bank how did it come through not through your righteousness but through the righteousness of the righteous he was the one put the deposit in there the deposit is in the bank then don't be afraid to write out the bank will pay it off and the funds will return to you just as soon as she passes through the clearance that's right it's corrective down in your heart you truly believe that's the promise of God and you've accepted it is you haven't lost your Covenant sister brother you haven't lost your Covenant you lost the blessings come back up here in the promised land come in where God said that you should abide you abide in me Saint John 15. Saint John 15. and my words abide in you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] come on back into the promise it's time it's simple foreign [Applause] you give the Lord another hand of Praise Worship be seated for just a moment brother Caleb that is Pastor here in Tommy Jr want to thank you all so much for the confidence just saying to be led to the Lord we had thought for tomorrow and some things that we were going to do and then we we got together on it brother Caleb said brother Jack you preach and let's just see what the Lord wants to do so here we are so I waited for a sign that his sign was so how many is ready to die tonight are you sure dying means that you're not going to go back to whatever you're dying to you never see a dead man walk up die and say well oh thank you thank you you don't see a man when a man when a man or woman died they don't partially die no partialment and they don't keep alive certain things that they want to keep alive that's true I want you to come up with me and so tonight to get ready for the climax service if the Lord is willing tomorrow I heard my brother Jackie say hermano Jack is here talking to a lot of Akins tonight I love the beauty of what he pointed out if he would have just waited if he would have just waited God would have given him more than what he stole we're too instantaneous of a society everything right now our brother said last night you develop a picture it's a process and cell phones don't do the processo he said Satan was the the developer of technology so go ahead with your selfies and your uh what do they call that when they uh they improve the picture right you start off like this by the time you're done you look like a baboon your own mother doesn't recognize who you are because you're trying to beautify yourself without following the process of developing the devil wants to give you an instant Beauty but if we'll just wait on God makes everything beautiful is that right so tonight if there's anybody
