[22:34] believe that we are in the rapture
[22:36] you know que estamos en el grabber the

[22:43] anyone to be lost
[22:44] nokey dokey now didn't appear that and I
[22:45] don't want us to miss it in okay
[22:47] Rimouski later in order to get into
[22:49] rupturing condition if I'm threatened
[22:50] condition thereafter we got to make sure
[22:52] that we examine ourselves tenemos que
[22:55] ser Serrano's they examine our to see
[22:57] who is crowning our life mister Nando
[23:00] nostra Vita so if we can turn to the
[23:02] book of first Corinthians it was Diego a
[23:04] primera equity into 11th chair
[23:06] during the 28 verse copy Thrones ever
[23:09] snow in Kyoto you have it you can say
[23:11] men when the low tendency point they see
[23:13] the man
[23:13] I bless my friend brother Jerry you know
[23:18] me amigo he just joined the 50 club I
[23:22] come and throw a group of us in Quentin
[23:24] it's a man bad so man first Corinthians
[23:33] 11:28 reads like this 170 or shortly se
[23:37] but let a man examine his neighbor what
[23:40] a private cockiness we see no no we're
[23:44] good at that huh let him a man examine
[23:49] the brothers and sisters in the church I
[23:52] mean I lost hermanos in nicosia my Bible
[23:55] says let a man examine himself me
[23:57] release a portal to privacy cada uno
[23:59] cities and so let him eat of that bread
[24:01] and drink of that Cup
[24:03] Akuma see del pon de la copa me God had
[24:06] his blessings to the reading of his
[24:07] words you may be seated supposing
[24:09] there's nobody that's in a hurry this
[24:11] morning are you nothing by the priests
[24:13] esta mañana
[24:19] the very word examine la palabra examine
[24:23] are simply means to test get a sip robot
[24:27] to approve
[24:29] yep revoir it means to discern the
[24:32] certain need or try oneself oh no miss
[24:36] mom and we examine ourselves you know
[24:38] sex I mean ammo as I said is because by
[24:40] doing so porque se endo tally it is
[24:43] showing us who is the one that is
[24:46] crowning our life okay so my striking is
[24:48] that qhorin and honest and it's either
[24:49] God or saying Amen also there's no other
[24:52] there's no one else that's who it is
[24:54] nothing masters either God or say in his
[24:57] crown in your life is the oh so certain
[24:59] task or know something I want them to
[25:00] before we get going I want them to put
[25:02] up there they would the the the
[25:03] definition of crowning
[25:05] here kapangan a a finish there's so many
[25:07] different different definitions but I
[25:09] wanna I want you to catch this one here
[25:11] ok Captain esta crowning is representing
[25:14] a level of surpassing achievement
[25:17] Coronado is represented only veiled a
[25:19] Sabra
[25:20] an attainment supreme I go to stake I'll
[25:24] cancel or are Suprema
[25:26] and when you talk about crown cuando la
[25:28] coruna crown then means an ptosis
[25:31] Coronel KITT is here do you have the the
[25:33] word crown up there there we go crown is
[25:39] the distinction that comes from a great
[25:41] achievement these things Bianca viene
[25:43] después de un grande Lago crown is the
[25:46] power or dominion of a sovereign a still
[25:49] poder of the Meno that goes over I know
[25:51] it is the highest or most nearly perfect
[25:55] state of anything SLS Thomas Alto Oh
[25:59] Cassie todo it is the supreme source of
[26:02] Honor excellence and beauty it lets -
[26:05] pretty much went to the or not excel in
[26:07] severe Masuda crown is to be at the top
[26:09] or the highest part of this territory
[26:12] lastima the last part is myself tests
[26:15] and crown is the leaves and living
[26:17] branches of a tree so unless no has
[26:19] eluded us was do not will when we talk
[26:22] about crowns and Thrones in the Bible
[26:25] when the lamas they throw knows the
[26:26] corona they're not associated with
[26:28] angels no Stella so Sione no that is
[26:30] Qantas Arianism talk about angel and
[26:32] there's no crowns and Thrones are not
[26:34] associated with them Laura Secord honest
[26:36] you know sittin crowns and Thrones are
[26:39] associated with men turn no Sakura
[26:41] associate an hombre
[26:43] we I have been partakers of flesh and
[26:46] blood and Macedo participant is Academy
[26:48] and to him that overcometh ya quelques
[26:50] win Sierra will I grant to sit with me
[26:52] in my throne
[26:53] narek se siente allow the olden crowns
[26:56] and Thrones have to do with you and I
[26:59] don't know Sakura not me believe me I
[27:01] couldn't legally could instead amen and
[27:02] we're here this morning for that one
[27:05] reason is that most a kiss the man up
[27:06] what is the rest because we want to
[27:08] examine ourselves heroic sent me not me
[27:11] you know those miss I think it's a good
[27:12] time to preach on this your case tiempo
[27:15] de pista because I believe all the
[27:17] graduates could not have graduated
[27:19] porque ellos no lo que mi Leslie had
[27:22] taken their exams no for the mother
[27:24] never I mean and through life we we have
[27:27] a lot of different achievements I mean
[27:29] most muchos locos we can go back as far
[27:32] as
[27:33] when we first learned to walk what an
[27:35] achievement huh come on Kandra siena

[27:55] didn't predict ended and every time they
[27:57] do they they finish up their Chiefs
[27:59] they they finish the year they graduate
[28:01] because I didn't do nine your sake
[28:03] another one so then then then they go to

[28:32] things of the Lord know if I didn't take
[28:34] honors courses the deal that is from
