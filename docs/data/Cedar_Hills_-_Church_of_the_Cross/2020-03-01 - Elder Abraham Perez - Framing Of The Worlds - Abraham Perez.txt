TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus you may be seated and migrate sure the warmest of Christian Fellowship and love of cranks today honey knows the song he cares for thee you know it or this for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] our Heavenly Father we thank thee that thou does care for us and as manifested thy love towards us and so much that you sent your own beloved son there the innocent Son of God to take the place of guilty sinners how we thank thee that thou take care for us in this mindful of us to do this and we're so appreciated largely happy together here this afternoon under the canopies of the skies and asked your blessings upon this service grant Lord that every man woman boy or girl it's year may study deeply now in the scriptures we're facing a world that's controlled by Satan and father we pray as we study the power of demons and what they do to people that you will give us great faith and made many great signs and wonders d-roc for we asked it in Christ's name and for God's glory amen where our study this afternoon quickly into it I get about 15 minutes early is still on demonology and I just got a message a while ago brother Baylor from my friends and start in Africa the middle of July so that settles that we got a fish down and brother Baxter can't go at that time so grab go to Africa by myself so going over there but maybe though yet to pray for me now that the Lord will help me well I really go to need it now over there amongst I'm expecting at least 200,000 people in that meeting and I've got a vision road out here I won't do to people just the benefit of it it happens in December I was in the room one morning when the angel the Lord came in I you see when I was over there I just obeyed God and I picked up amoeba a man naught amoeba is a parasite that gets near the kid and because I'd done something God told me not to do how many's heard the story of it I guess somebody's here I know the folks around the tabernacle heard the story of what happened God told me to go a place and to stay away from this place and then go back over to another place and I'll let the preachers talk me out of it preachers are wonderful and they're my brothers but you mind what God tells you that's Ryan Smith you got one mission how many remembers one time there's two prophets in the Bible and one of them the Lord Twigg did you go to a certain place and don't choose don't you come to you go back another way and so forth of them and said don't you I eat or drink while you're there and another true prophet met him and said the Lord met me after he met you and said come to my house and the Prophet listen to what the other and said and lost his life I see you do what God tells you to do regardless or what anybody else says now we're in this vision he it woke me up 13th of September December and as I was sitting on the side of my bed I was wondering what would be my future I want to come back over here there's rays throw me in a pest house parasites that just stopped taking me and they give me examination when I struck this land and by God's grace this let me go home because it's very scattered and I prayed and I went to those ministry so the Lord said me not to go that way so all God talks somebody besides you I said Cora had that idea one time offend them so but I went and got some leaves and laid it over their feet and I said remember in the name of the Lord if we take that trip there it's going to be a failure and we'll all pay for it and we sure did a hole we're all like to die so then coming back you have so much to contend with in those foreign countries for instance a little flea would bite you it calls you have tick fever and that little thing when it bites you if you feel yourself sitting you can't scratch it you're looking with the little black fellow don't pull it off it's got a little head it bores its way into the skin turns around like this and fastens itself but you'd pull it you'd pull the head off in there it's got a virus thing of the paralyzed you so you don't scratch or don't pull him all just take some towel and he breezed through he's back drop towel aren't and it comes off Mesquita he doesn't make a bit of noise he comes right through the air you just touch it that's all you've got malaria and then there's what they call the Mumbai snake if he hits you you live just about 2 minutes at your any issue and there's a yellow Cober you live about 15 minutes after his bike and one of us close enough to my son is he could ladies hand on his head already up to strike before we got the shot like that and there's the black hole bro there's just everything and then the wild perils of the animals of course line tiger or leopards and everything else to contend with in the jungle and then their diseases is this all kinds of diseases in there and you have all that to face when you go beside that and here's the witch doctor to challenge you oh never hand thing and all their superstitions and things but how or what a marvelous thing to see our Lord just wave it away from side to side like I ain't going and that day I remember standing there how well what taking place I'll tell you sometime in another meeting cause I want to get almost subject this afternoon of demonology but now in this I was thinking about singer what will the end beam and we're coming back across the sea I know we had around a hundred thousand conversions while we was in there my old brother Bosworth come to me said I said well brother Bosworth he said I'm so proud of you brother branham he said you're just you're just the beginning of life I said well I guess it's all over I said I'm past forty years old and I guess I fought a good fight and finished the course he said past 40 years old today's that old four I got converted said I'm still going good he was prettier going into his 80 just I thought well maybe that's about right so he said no you're just a brand new brand and now you just know how to control your meetings better than everything said just if you ever strike America in its right way to the right set up meeting where you could stay six or eight weeks in a place and get it set up an advertised around said you do something but and for our Lord so we went ahead just on like that so it was very very nice then takes a while I saw a vision when I was an American had come to me and return me back to Africa and it showed me that same meeting sitting there in front of Durban in the first meeting faded away into history going towards the west the second meeting rolls up and when it did it was still larger than the first meeting look and he her scream and an angel was coming out of heaven they had a great light and the age of the Lord which stands by Cheverus that always stands by my right over on this side and they were standing and it was it was milling around and I've seen this one man standing armies he's not now that's not vision when you see him it's just as real as you're looking at maybe y-you can hear him walk and talk to you and when he anything it just is really it's not a vision the man is just standing there just same as you are his voice is just the same as mine would be or yours to be but a vision something breaks before he and you see it like that but this man is Falk something stands ever so he told me that what was going to take place and he said that this angel came down and he told me to turn and look this away and it looked towards you India now now I don't say it's in India but it's near but they were Indian people called the Africans or big burly heavy fat like people some of them in nearly seven foot tall weights or 280 or 300 pounds burly Zuma's now the shunga the suta and all these many different tribes there's 15 different tribes sitting there that day I was speaking to I'd save one word like Jesus Christ the Son of God I'd go get a drink of water pour it went through all interpreters wanted sake and all noises I used to think when I heard Pentecostal people speaking in tongues that maybe one speaking in one kind of sound and one speaking other how the world could that be but I'll be the vitals right and orders or said there's not a sound without significance some of them would say one of them go blue blue blue blue that met Jesus Christ the Son of God I go not the Jesus Christ the Son of God in his language so no matter what kind of sound it is it's the meaning somewhere that's on no matter what type of noise it is it means something to someone somewhere and when he was a they'd give that out and I noticed that over to my left when that angel came down and I seen a swarm like there and there were a man with looked like they had a sheet around him like it and it wrapped up and tied like around a small baby the napkin and it was now I could just see as far as I could see with other people and then this angel turned on a great oscillating light and it began to sway back and forth like that and I never seen so many people in my life and then this other angel came real close to me and he said these 300,000 of them in that meeting now I've got it written down here you write it in some kind of piece of paper like I told about the little boy been resurrection Finland you write that on the Flyleaf or your Bible or somewhere and in this meeting there is going to be a meeting and you'll hear through some outlet of 300 thousand people attend that meeting that's it that is not that would be three times the size the other month see three hundred thousand people to attend the meeting and I'm just so happy to get to get there I don't know what to do for I like to win souls to our Lord and there at one time seeing seeing thirty thousand raw heathens come to Jesus Christ someone over call thirty thousand are all hidden now let's go to our subject right quick yesterday we studied the Technic of demons I've been thinking today as God dealing you don't know what a liberty it is to get out now I'm not a teacher I'm a long waist and being a bible expositor and i am my education is limited to a seventh grade so that's and that i come out of school about twenty-five years ago so that's a long time all and the oh not have very much of an education but all that I know is water received through inspiration and if that inspiration doesn't compare with the Bible then it's wrong see it's got to be the Bible no matter what inspiration it is it's got to come here is God's foundation no other foundations laid but this and what this is if what I would say would be contrary to this you let my words be alive because this is the truth see see and if an angel would tell you something it would be different than this pulsar letting be unto you a curse even an angel of light now there's many great things only the only two days calls to get this subject to the people that was yesterday and today of the afternoon meetings now the reason I did this is to give myself a little try to see if God would help me there's something all my heart and this is that actually this great message and after God Himself confirming what as I have said to be the truth in his word by his word first and then through signs and wonders now I think with the gospel truth to the church I'm under obligation to God to bring this to the church that's right there so broke up and so many different organizations and sectarian parts of it so that's wrong we're all God's children when we're born again that's the thing and the truth of the thing is that God wants us to know that that we're his children now remember the Temple of Solomon must cut out all over the world and here comes one Rock twisted this way and one Rock twisted that way one cut up this when one cut that way but when it come together there wasn't a buzz of assault or sound of the hammer everything went right to its place God was the instructor that God's got a church call this families them on the Church of God and ones of this and the wonder that but when they all come together there'll be one big group of brotherly love and God will hurt symbol that church together and take her on up into the sky ever famous picture before it's ever hung enough Hall of art it has to be hung go through the Hall of critics first the man who painted that gust or pardon me I can't call his new painting the Last Supper anyhow it cost him his life time he painted that picture there's about twenty years or ten years of lead between paint and Christ and Judas and did you realize that famous picture that the same man pulls for Christ ten years later pulls for Judas that's right it is ten years of sin from a great opera singer to take the place of Christ come to the place of Judas you don't have to take ten years to take ten minutes we'll do the same thing to you it'll change your character in sin but anyhow that picture went through all the critics and that's what I think about the gods church the group that's called well I don't mean this to any slam I've sailed the seven seas in a moment third trip around the world and the people say Holy Roller Holy Roller and I've searched the world and I've never found a Holy Roller yet that's a name that devil has tacked on to the people that's all there's no such a thing as the Holy Roller now I have statistics of ever 668 different churches that there is an organized in the world is not what I'm called holy rollers that's from the government there's not one Holy Roller Church I know of so it's just something the devil's Hall but now and all of this all these things God has painted a picture and one time these little old churches used to be out here some of you I watched these gray-headed man my boy yesterday I was in the room studying and a minister came by and said like shake hands with your dad course my boys been raised up with brother Baxter now who just oh that's it quickly I don't like that see no matter if I of course I can't be serving a man in God too but I think I like to shake hands with my brethren I like to do that there's something about it I like to shake the hands of a minister not only a minister but any child of God I like to do it I didn't know about it until my wife had told me a little later well if he could have told that Minister just a minute he's back there in prayer and I'll see why didn't say well that that would have been better so I give him a little correction on that not to do that see and so on it's true you can't just be right out as the brother said a while ago if you do then at night time I'm worn you see the people go to talking and everyone has maybe a sickness and when they go to speaking about it quickly there's the angel of the Lord right there to tell about it there's someone said looking right at me now knows that to be true for mister few minutes ago or about a hour and a half ago a lady sitting here who didn't know what it was that the angel Lord spoke to her other night and told her something and she couldn't understand it but today it happened so she knows now what it means when he was speaking to her and how standing there talking to her the angel or butt right spit back out and told her what our trouble was and what was all about and and what she was thinking about one of her loved ones and how God had spoken said he'd confirmed it and what was going to take place so that's just exactly way it'll be see God has said so but now what about a few times that ever and then in each vision just weakens you that much more thing and the first thing you know when you get to church at night you're just so completely wore out here you just don't know hardly what to do and you pray for me now see because it's out of one meeting to another to another this was the only meeting it would be different if I was going home now bugs building up for a couple months well to get my fishing line and go fishing but I got to go from one meeting right to another from one right to another you see that's what makes it and you all pray you people back here in the audience they told me last night and the person who did not respond to the call that's pretty dangerous to see when is said it but sometimes these life don't shine is a dark spot in between there now watch the angel Lord when you're standing here I can feel it then I'll feel it moved from me now watching it'll leave me and it'll go over somewhere stand there a little bit I can see it it'll flash on and there be a vision come then I'll see the vision I'll watch what a kind of looking person it is around there I find the person and I speak that's what takes place that's what happens you don't have to tell everybody that but that's that's what takes place you see it's all in the spiritual rim then if that person don't respond and be like reading the Bible here and saying there's nothing to it walk away from it see so that makes it pretty bad so be on alert be listening be watching when he speaks answer he's just be ready to answer at any time and so my wife and brother of dealer and many of them this morning was telling me about it that it was calling a man bought his brother somewhere that had something wrong with him and so forth and the man did not respond to the call so that can't be helped that's between God and the man division left me then I couldn't find it no more because it didn't answer so be watching be on alert now I'm taking this subject of demonology and speaking about Dean now people when you say demon right quick they begin to thank or some fanaticism or something but demons is just as real as angels there are just as real and the devil is just as real a devil as Jesus Christ as the Son of God he's a devil heaven is just as real answer is no such a thing as hell there's no profession thing is heaven if there is the eternal blessed eternal punishment rather there's no eternal blast if there's the old days there's no night thank you but it sure there's a there's night if if there's as the church as a Christian there's bound to be a hypocrite if fears there's somebody that's genuine from God there's somebody to impersonate that see it's just exactly pro and con black and white right on down through life on everything true and false everywhere and there's the false gospel there's a true gospel there's a true baptism there's a false baptism there's a make belief and there's a real there's a true American dollar there's a false American dollar there's a genuine Christian there's a genuine hypocrite see it's just impersonating so will you find that so it all goes together now we can't separate it God lifts the rainfall may let me speak to your just a little bit how many preachers is your raise up your hands all around preachers let's see your hand well god bless you brethren now now you don't take this for a doctoring now but just before we approach this vital subject I tell you one how many Pentecostal people's yours raise up your hands all around everywhere here all Pentecostals all right I'll tell you what I had when I first come into your room ring I Drive up here in Indiana at a certain place called Mishawaka the first group of Pentecostal people I've ever seen is called the the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ I believe or something like a wonderful bunch of people now they organize together and call in United Pentecost they break up from the rest of the calls with an issue of water baptism that don't make them any hypocrites is many a genuine real genuine Holy Ghost born-again Christian in the ranks and God gave them the Holy Ghost but being baptized in Jesus name they give the others the babbage's the Holy Ghost in baptize and father son only go so God gives them the Holy Ghost to obey Him so who get who got who obey ting are you hard if you just forgetting them it wants to be one way let them be and you go ahead be brothers that's all don't what done it was breaking a month of breaking away see what is breaking tearing up breaking that Brotherhood setting out and separating yourself no sir we're not separated we're one that's right but when I was standing there I was watching those people now me just come out of a regular little old Southern Baptist Church luck I'd see those people I went in there and they were clapping her hands Lorne one of them glad I'd say I'm one of them I thought my first thing they were here comes somebody down through there a dancing as hard as they could dance I thought what church manners I never heard such things as that I kept watching around wondering what in the world the matter with those people now you've heard me tell my life story where I hit that needing her but this is one thing I've never told never told it before in public so they now if you want to rub it off your recorder while you can do so yeah all right now in this I watched and I thought well then people is the happiest people I ever seen in my life they wasn't ashamed of their religion we Baptists give this little did a shame much the wrong on see and when they go to pray you know get behind the fan you know and but we but then people wasn't brother they they they had religion all inside outside and all over him well I remember that night when I got on the platform said all preachers on the platform is the convention they had to have it up here in the north on account of on kind of colored problem the Jim Crow law of the south so there's all met there from everywhere so I was setting up there and said oh now there's I heard all preachers through that day and that night it said
