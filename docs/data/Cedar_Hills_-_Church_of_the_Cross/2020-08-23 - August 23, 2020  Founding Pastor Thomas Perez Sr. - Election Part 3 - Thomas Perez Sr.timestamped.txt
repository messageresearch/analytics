[9:52] second message on
[9:58] election and we had Las crues on
[10:00] Telephone
[10:03] hookup amen very
[10:06] very tremendous
[10:09] messages not preaching the
[10:13] message it's uh I started maybe month
[10:17] and a half
[10:20] ago in fact I was in Lake Tahoe
[10:24] California cnia when the inspiration
[10:27] came to
[10:28] me
[10:31] and it's quite a
[10:34] subject amen so not to take more time
[10:38] and go right into the
[10:41] word if you w would open your Bibles to
[10:45] The Second Epistle of
[10:50] John chapter one and verse
[10:54] [Music]
[10:58] one
[11:01] children it's always good to see
[11:08] William of course when I was in Lake
[11:10] Taho I remembered William because
[11:11] William is from that area
[11:19] from I've always said
[11:23] this I do not like
[11:26] cities but if I was to live in
[11:30] City the first place I would pick would
[11:33] be San Diego
[11:38] California and the second
[11:41] one Sacramento
[11:44] California Sacramento is a very
[11:46] beautiful
[11:48] city do you know that the city of
[11:50] Sacramento has more trees than any other
[11:54] city except for one place in the
[11:57] world
[12:02] and now that I discovered Lake
[12:04] Taho Sacramento just doubled and in my
[12:08] take over first place with San
[12:17] Diego if you ever have a
[12:20] chance go
[12:23] toake it's a freshwater
[12:27] lake and it's it's quite a sight to
[12:34] see it's so beautiful there you I think
[12:37] I think that's the closest thing to the
[12:44] Millennium they tell me Hawaii is
[12:49] pretty people go to Alaska they say it's
[12:52] very
[12:55] nice I'll tell you Hawaii has has
[12:57] something to prove to to be as pretty as
[13:00] Lake
[13:04] Taho well brother P you've never been to
[13:09] Hawaii if going four times isn't going
[13:12] then I haven't been
[13:16] there it's pretty but not as pretty as
[13:21] lakeo so my wife wants me to take her to
[13:24] Lake or to
[13:27] Hawaii
[13:30] I guess one one of these days I'll take
[13:34] her but I tell her I I told her I've
[13:37] taken you to a much prettier
[13:40] Place
[13:42] amen anyway enough of that
[13:46] nonsense
[13:49] okay second John chapter 1 verse
[13:56] one it reads this way
[13:59] the children unto the
[14:03] elect lady and her children whom I love
[14:07] in the truth and not I only but also all
[14:12] they that have known the
[14:25] truth may the Lord add His blessings to
[14:27] the reading of the word you may be
[14:32] seated
[14:35] sometimes when we read the
[14:38] Bible and we are surrounded by different
[14:47] churches
[14:48] everybody wants to be a possessor of
[14:55] this and if you read the Bible correctly
[15:01] this
[15:04] Bible is not addressed to
[15:09] unbelievers that's why it said to all
[15:12] those that love the
[15:17] truth and clearly it
[15:21] says the Elder unto the elect nobody
[15:27] else nobody else to this letter is to
[15:32] the elect
[15:36] lady and to her
[15:40] children so right
[15:42] away I don't think people have any
[15:44] business reading my
[15:49] letters do you know it's it's bad to
[15:52] read somebody's open somebody's
[15:57] letter so if you're not
[16:00] elect you don't have a right to read
[16:03] these
[16:06] letter it's unto the elect lady and her
[16:13] children now I don't know which way I'm
[16:17] going I just wait for
[16:20] God but maybe I'll start this
[16:25] way I have more nose and Carter's got
[16:31] pills but I'll read a few and
[16:34] then we'll see what God has for
[16:39] us but one of the the the things that I
[16:43] want to start
[16:46] with is concerning the church and the
[16:53] bright there's a lot a lot of difference
[16:56] between the church and the
[17:02] there are scriptures that go to the
[17:08] church but there are scriptures that go
[17:11] only to the
[17:14] bright even brother Bram on the S says
[17:18] I'm going to call you
[17:22] bride so then it's to the elect
[17:27] lady and and and in
[17:31] reality no one is going to understand
[17:34] this
[17:36] Bible no matter no matter if you
[17:38] memorize
[17:41] it you will not understand
[17:44] it unless it's directed to
[17:48] you that much I
[17:52] know all right when when we speak of the
[17:57] church
[17:59] many people are
[18:02] confused theologians are
[18:05] confused and they they this friend of
[18:09] brother
[18:11] brandham did not agree with Brother
[18:13] brandham on his approach to the
[18:22] church brother Bram said he he he does
[18:25] not agree with me and that's fine he
[18:27] said
[18:31] he's still my
[18:33] brother he says but I do not agree with
[18:36] him
[18:38] either so then two can't walk together L
[18:42] they
[18:45] agree now he says
[18:48] this he sees that the church has to go
[18:51] through the tribulation period for
[18:57] purification
[19:05] I say the blood of Jesus Christ purifies
[19:08] the
[19:11] church I believe that the church goes
[19:14] through the tribulation
[19:19] period Church
[19:23] organization but the bride does
[19:27] not would you choose a woman you had to
[19:30] purify before you married
[19:38] her Christ Christ bride is
[19:44] chosen and she is
[19:47] elected she's God's
[19:51] bride the Bride of Jesus
[19:55] Christ so that settles that
[19:59] for me it settles
[20:00] it the only thing it does it opens a lot
[20:04] of
[20:06] questions concerning the new
[20:10] birth concerning many
[20:14] things and I see
[20:18] God I see
[20:20] him well I know I know you got scripture
[20:23] to kind of counter me on
[20:27] this
[20:32] that's fine contradict me all you
[20:35] want but I also have a
[20:38] right to voice what I
[20:41] see since a child life I've wondered
[20:45] many
[20:47] things and since being as a minister or
[20:51] a
[20:53] pastor that's been 40 years
[20:56] now uh I've always had questions when I
[20:59] hear preachers preach not all preachers
[21:01] but some
[21:05] preachers and they make statements
[21:08] like like uh because of the fighting of
[21:12] Israel in
[21:16] Lebanon the end is almost
[21:22] here and I don't accept
[21:25] that and I'm going to tell you why I
[21:27] don't accept it
[21:29] I am 65 years
[21:32] old ever since I've been in
[21:36] church it's been the end
[21:40] time it's doomsday
[21:45] preachers well uh I'm I'm going to I'm
[21:48] going to go back I I have to say this to
[21:50] get to
[21:53] elect a man comes to
[21:56] me with a m
[21:58] message and it's concerning that Los
[22:02] Angeles was going to S this was last
[22:04] year in September of last
[22:11] year and uh he asked me that he would
[22:14] that if I gave him permission
[22:18] to I said
[22:20] sure s he couldn't get
[22:24] him then he asked me the question
[22:29] do you believe that what these scientist
[22:32] said that in September I don't forget
[22:34] what date Los Angeles is GNA
[22:42] sink I didn't have to think about it I
[22:46] didn't have to pray about it I didn't
[22:48] have to meditate about it I said
[22:51] absolutely
[22:53] not Los Angeles ain't ready to
[22:56] sing
[22:59] and I'll tell you I'll tell you
[23:01] why we there are still succession of
[23:06] events that need to
[23:10] happen before that event takes
[23:15] place then somebody asked me well do you
[23:18] have for
[23:20] knowledge I said well what do you think
[23:22] I'm speaking to you
[23:25] now then he said what only God God has
[23:28] for
[23:30] knowledge I said yes God had for
[23:34] knowledge everything that God
[23:37] was he poured it into the church or he
[23:40] poured it into
[23:42] Christ and everything that
[23:45] christed into the church then show me
[23:49] where the foral
[23:51] is that's why a lot of people are going
[23:54] to they don't know what's going on
[23:58] I said as far as the end
[24:01] time we have been in the end time for
[24:04] many
[24:06] years we even preach the end time
[24:11] message that's why I did not accept what
[24:13] that preacher had to
[24:16] say I will not accept it unless it's
[24:19] Bible
[24:23] truth and I have a for knowledge of
[24:26] it
[24:28] so so the thing goes on and on and on
[24:33] with
[24:34] preachers that's why preacher should
[24:36] have a
[24:38] pastor by yourself you ain't going to do
[24:41] it you see that everything that Christ
[24:45] was he poured it into the
[24:48] church now where's the
[24:51] church well I am part of that church I'm
[24:55] elected I'm chosen I'm
[24:59] predestined to be
[25:01] there that's God's
[25:04] predestination so what does
[25:05] predestination
[25:07] do it looks to for
[25:11] knowledge because predestined means to
[25:18] foree so it points to forn
[25:23] knowledge and then that points to
[25:26] Destiny
[25:28] you mean there's Destiny for all of
[25:33] us sure is you're here
[25:36] today you know where you're going to be
[25:40] tomorrow somebody asked me well that
[25:43] means that you can do
[25:45] anything I said
[25:48] absolutely I can do anything that I want
[25:52] in fact I'm in Colorado Springs this
[25:55] morning because I
[25:58] to I preach because I
[26:01] want I read the word of God because I
[26:04] want to that's why I do
[26:07] it I want to do it amen amen all
[26:13] right you're with me
[26:17] elect for knowledge looks
[26:23] predestination do you believe there's a
[26:25] lot of people going to be saved
[26:30] and the answer would
[26:34] be
[26:36] yes are you saved brother
[26:40] pis yes I will not be saved I am
[26:46] saved when were you saved Brother
[26:51] P I'll tell you when I was
[26:56] saved I was wasn't saved when I got
[27:01] baptized or I went through all these
[27:04] rituals in
[27:06] church I wasn't saved
[27:10] then then when were you
[27:17] saved I was
[27:20] saved and I became a
[27:24] Christian let me read something to you
[27:26] here
[27:29] put on your jackets get your helmets
[27:35] ready this will turn you around for the
[27:39] children being not yet
[27:46] born this is Esau and
[27:49] Jacob neither having done good or
[27:55] evil that the purpose of God according
[27:58] to the
[28:01] election Esau and Jacob before either
[28:05] child was
[28:09] born before they even knew what was
[28:12] right and
[28:15] wrong that the election of God might
[28:18] stand not of works but of him that
[28:26] call brother Brown says I thought you
[28:29] quit in meat to get
[28:35] saved you have nothing to do with
[28:40] it if you're
[28:42] saved God called you listen God called
[28:46] you before the foundation of the
[28:51] world that's the
[28:53] problem to much
[28:56] religion
[28:58] Shepherds telling you that you got to do
[29:00] this or that don't have to do
[29:04] nothing not what we do what God
[29:10] orain that's all there is
[29:13] doing there's nothing we can do about
[29:16] it some guy said I like to
[29:21] smoke religious person will tell him no
[29:23] don't
[29:25] smoke I don't tell them enjoy
[29:29] it yeah that's what they enjoy enjoy I
[29:33] like to drink
[29:36] beer religious Shepherds say no it's
[29:40] wrong to drink
[29:43] beer not if he likes
[29:46] it let him have
[29:50] it let him let him let him enjoy it
[29:53] that's what he likes it's like I told
[29:56] you I do what I
[29:59] want why because that's what I want to
[30:04] do nobody going to tell me what to
[30:09] do my nature speaks for
[30:13] itself I preach cuz I want to preach I
[30:18] sing him cuz I want to sing
[30:21] him I do all these
[30:23] things because it's my nature to do
[30:29] then you when you were saved since you
[30:32] were saved brother
[30:34] pis since I recognized that I was
[30:41] elected I left all religion behind
[30:46] me I don't need
[30:48] religion all I need to
[30:52] know is that God elected me
[30:58] yeah
[31:00] elected GL brother pis you don't know if
[31:03] you're
[31:05] elected speak for
[31:11] yourself don't interpret the word to
[31:14] me it's already been
[31:17] interpreted already come to
[31:20] pass I'm
[31:22] elected I don't have to prove nothing to
[31:25] nobody I don't even have to prove it to
[31:28] God I don't have to prove to God nothing
[31:31] he elected
[31:33] me that's all there is do it can you
[31:36] understand that you are
[31:39] elected I was
[31:41] thinking as you open your Bibles to St
[31:43] Matthew the third
[31:46] chapter I was thinking on this
[31:50] scripture and it's Matthew
[31:54] 3 and it says this
[32:09] 10 now also the ex is laid unto the root
[32:13] of the trees therefore every tree which
[32:16] bringeth not forth good fruit is heun
[32:19] down and cast Into the
[32:26] Fire
[32:32] I indeed baptize you with water unto
[32:35] repentance but he that cometh after me
[32:38] is mightier than I whose shoes I am not
[32:41] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with
[32:44] the Holy Ghost and with
[32:56] fire
[32:59] just for a minute catch your
[33:02] attention can you
[33:04] imagine can you imagine if you were
[33:08] John and you already had for knowledge
[33:12] of this one that was
[33:16] coming and when he's
[33:19] baptizing he sees
[33:22] Jesus he knew who Jesus
[33:25] was and what was his
[33:28] reaction he said no way am I going to
[33:31] baptize
[33:33] him he's mightier than
[33:36] I there's no way I'll
[33:39] baptize what did Jesus say to
[33:43] him suffer
[33:49] Johnn for it becometh us to fulfill all
[33:55] righteousness
[33:59] right amen he didn't want to baptize
[34:01] him he knew he was
[34:05] mighty he knew that that he was a Son of
[34:10] God and he was not worthy to
[34:14] baptizing until Jesus used the
[34:18] words it becometh
[34:23] us now you don't don't miss the word us
[34:30] now I'm going to
[34:31] read I'm going to read from Brother
[34:35] Bram often times I've have
[34:38] wondered why the Jesus of
[34:41] Nazareth and many times he's been asked
[34:45] me why would a man like Jesus have to be
[34:52] baptized why would this person be
[34:55] baptized
[34:58] as an act of repentance and of
[35:07] confession when he was the Holy spest
[35:10] unadulterated son of the Living
[35:15] God why would this person have to be
[35:18] baptized like a man
[35:24] coming and he why would he have to be
[35:28] baptized like he had unto
[35:33] repentance because he needed no
[35:36] repentance he was the infallable
[35:40] god he was in the
[35:42] world the world was made by
[35:45] him and the world knew him
[35:47] not did you notice the phrase before
[35:50] that said thus it becometh us to fulfill
[35:54] all
[35:55] righteousness
[35:59] in other words it must be
[36:02] fulfilled all the word that God has
[36:07] spoken pay attention because it's it has
[36:10] a
[36:11] real awesome point
[36:14] there all the word that God has
[36:17] spoken it must be
[36:20] fulfilled God cannot say anything
[36:23] without having it
[36:25] fulfilled
[36:27] when he was spoken
[36:29] it it is a finished
[36:32] work it's already
[36:35] finished when God speaks
[36:37] it God never speaks it until he's ready
[36:40] for it to
[36:44] be and when he
[36:46] speaks it's just as well as already
[36:52] happened if that would wouldn't give us
[36:54] basis to put our faith on the this
[36:59] morning when God speaks a
[37:02] word it's already
[37:04] finished what about his promises that
[37:07] he's given to
[37:09] us see everything that he has
[37:12] said it's already a finished
[37:15] work so
[37:17] therefore when we receive this word into
[37:20] our
[37:21] heart it's already done it's
[37:25] completed
[37:27] here I'm going to get a little
[37:31] heavy
[37:33] amen natural
[37:36] birth spiritual
[37:40] birth we know we were born of
[37:44] corruptible
[37:48] seed but when you were
[37:52] born I'm going to ask you a question why
[37:55] and I'm going to quote brother randam as
[37:59] saying the physical birth or the Virgin
[38:02] birth is more mysterious than the the
[38:05] spiritual
[38:12] birth I never understood
[38:14] that but by God's grace I do
[38:18] now but I I always
[38:22] wondered here's God or not God Elohim
[38:27] Elohim now he was by
[38:30] himself when all of a sudden he had
[38:34] thoughts which we would call an
[38:38] attribute there are
[38:40] thoughts they're not words there are
[38:44] thoughts and when he had these
[38:47] thoughts he had to have thought of
[38:51] you let me tell you one
[38:53] thing if he didn't have you in his
[38:56] thought you ain't going
[39:01] nowhere you have to have been in his
[39:06] thoughts now in his
[39:09] thoughts he knew that he had to be a
[39:13] savior so then in his thoughts he
[39:17] crucified the Lord Jesus
[39:20] Christ and he knew at what time we were
[39:25] going to be born
[39:30] in the first age or the last
[39:34] age he knew
[39:36] this he didn't just think of Jesus
[39:40] Christ he had lot of
[39:43] thoughts and to express
[39:46] them he couldn't do
[39:48] it unless he had the right people to
[39:53] deposit these thoughts
[39:55] in
[39:59] so then when you were conceived in your
[40:02] mother's
[40:06] womb where were
[40:08] you you were in your mother
[40:13] also I am speaking about the real
[40:17] you but it was
[40:20] J you could not touch it nobody could
[40:25] handle it
[40:27] you couldn't touch
[40:29] that it was hidden by
[40:32] God it's what is called the hidden man
[40:35] of the
[40:37] heart but it was in your
[40:40] mother that's why Nicodemus
[40:44] said is it possible that I can go back
[40:47] into my mother's
[40:50] womb no he couldn't go back into his
[40:53] mother's
[40:54] wom he was already
[40:58] expressed but he was in his
[41:01] heart and God had it
[41:04] there God wasn't going to bring it
[41:07] out until it was
[41:10] time in the fullness of
[41:13] time out of a woman God would bring this
[41:17] out and then would become the
[41:21] spiritual the spiritual birth couldn't
[41:25] come time message
[41:29] came when we heard that something
[41:32] happened to us it was not physical it
[41:37] was spiritual it was inside of
[41:40] us there was a germ there and the had to
[41:45] find its way to
[41:51] the and that's what where we
[41:55] find
[42:02] iine that's
[42:05] mine
[42:08] salvation is it
[42:10] yours will you have to claim it as
[42:14] I I has a personal pronoun is a
[42:20] name I
[42:23] tomasz have been
[42:25] born amen amen this seed is not
[42:31] corruptible it's Incorruptible
[42:35] seed nothing could bring it
[42:39] out except except the spoken word of
[42:46] God let me read it to you again when God
[42:50] speaks
[42:51] it God never speaks it until he's ready
[42:54] for it to be
[42:59] and when he
[43:01] speaks it's just as well as already
[43:07] happened when he speaks it it's
[43:11] there it
[43:13] happens nothing's going to stop it cuz
[43:16] God spoke
[43:18] it when God spoke his word to the Virgin
[43:24] Mary then Jesus
[43:27] came now let me stop for a
[43:30] minute was Jesus the
[43:34] holy incarnate
[43:37] God what brother said he
[43:41] was well then let me ask you a question
[43:44] and who are
[43:47] you stop for a
[43:50] minute now Jesus
[43:53] came and he had to come
[43:58] first but he wasn't the only one that
[44:00] God thought
[44:01] of or what Elohim thought
[44:04] of but he was the one that had to come
[44:11] first what for to pay the
[44:15] price so that Sinners could be
[44:20] saved
[44:22] amen then why so many different in
[44:29] churches
[44:31] because of man-made
[44:35] ideas amen I have a hard time with
[44:37] ministers you know that I'm very I have
[44:40] more trouble with ministers than I have
[44:42] anybody else because they think they
[44:43] know
[44:48] everything and they really the majority
[44:50] don't know
[44:51] nothing they have big
[44:54] words but I like a
[44:57] man that knows what he's talking
[45:00] about that's why I love brother Bernie
[45:04] Garcia he don't just
[45:07] talk he knows what he's talking
[45:10] about I just had supper with him two
[45:13] days
[45:15] ago I was in Mexico W with
[45:20] him a week before that I was in Rosarito
[45:23] with
[45:24] him
[45:26] and what services we
[45:28] had but here's the
[45:31] thing that when God speaks
[45:35] it he can't speak
[45:38] it in other
[45:40] words Jesus Christ paid the
[45:44] price right amen sure he
[45:48] did when when Jesus Christ paid the
[45:53] price I
[45:56] became
[46:01] available yes I became
[46:07] manifested there was nothing I had to
[46:11] do I didn't have to get
[46:14] baptized I didn't have
[46:16] to be
[46:19] Sanctified why should I why did I need
[46:23] sanctification when the blood of Jesus
[46:25] sanctifies
[46:28] me when when the penalty for sin was
[46:34] paid he paid it for me so then why did I
[46:39] need these
[46:40] things I didn't need
[46:42] them but since he told
[46:46] me look Thomas it becometh
[46:51] us that's all it is it's not it's not
[46:55] the you have to do it you are you are
[46:59] Sanctified in
[47:00] me you are saved in
[47:04] me I I was saved when I got
[47:10] baptized no sir I wasn't I was saved
[47:15] before the foundation of the
[47:17] world when he elected
[47:21] me now insert yourself there when he
[47:24] elected me
[47:29] nothing I had to
[47:30] do before the children were
[47:35] born he knew
[47:38] you
[47:39] before they did any good or
[47:42] evil he knew that and he chose them and
[47:47] he told them say to
[47:53] them I love you
[47:56] and to the other one I hate
[48:00] you you know why God never had them in
[48:04] his
[48:07] thoughts and if somebody hasn't been in
[48:09] the thoughts of
[48:12] God they won't be
[48:14] there see all that God
[48:19] has is for
[48:22] us because it is really God
[48:27] God God With
[48:31] Us God in
[48:34] us so then if it's God in
[48:38] us who are
[48:40] we a part of what is called
[48:44] God now you tell me that Jesus Christ is
[48:47] the object of
[48:50] worship he is not God is the object of
[48:55] wor
[48:56] it has to be I me and mine possessive
[49:03] action that's why people like if you go
[49:06] to
[49:08] job and and job said if I knew where he
[49:12] live I'd go and knock at his
[49:17] door one man is not
[49:20] God it takes the
[49:22] whole everything that God want
[49:26] when he pour into the church what did he
[49:29] pour into the church he pointed he P the
[49:34] nominative or the person that are
[49:37] nominated for
[49:44] office amen that's why I orain you to be
[49:48] a
[49:50] prophet that's why Paul
[49:53] said Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[49:58] the will of
[50:01] God and if you don't recognize your
[50:05] office I feel sorry for you because you
[50:08] don't have it you might think you have
[50:11] it you don't have it because it's an
[50:15] office and that's what God F was the
[50:19] office I've heard preachers that don't
[50:22] know what they're talking
[50:24] about they say well I respect his office
[50:27] but I don't respect the
[50:30] man you don't respect the man the man is
[50:34] what makes the
[50:36] office how can you not respect that
[50:40] man man I can say to
[50:44] you an apostle of Jesus Christ what am I
[50:47] telling you that I am an
[50:50] apostle now let me do the work of an
[50:54] apostle you know how many churches and
[50:56] missions I
[50:58] have I have over 100
[51:03] Missions and I have
[51:05] churches in the last week i' I've had 15
[51:09] come come into my
[51:14] leadership it's the Holy
[51:17] Ghost the Holy Ghost
[51:21] feels he feels it he he is not upon
[51:26] everybody not upon All Flesh but upon
[51:30] the elected
[51:32] lady the elected lady she's the one that
[51:37] has the jeans of God nobody else no
[51:42] church person office it's God in the
[51:49] person God in the person so the person
[51:53] walks where are you his
[51:56] thoughts his thoughts are with
[51:59] God God is with him he's a very nervous
[52:03] person if you don't think I'm nervous
[52:05] talk to my
[52:07] wife very very nervous I don't know
[52:11] tomorrow where I'm going to be preaching
[52:13] I know I know I have to go to
[52:16] Africa I have to go to South America I
[52:19] have to go back into Mexico and then
[52:22] missions here in the United States you
[52:25] don't know sometimes the only thing that
[52:28] keeps me in
[52:30] sanity is that the nature of
[52:34] God I
[52:36] know that God needs me to go to these
[52:41] places now who do I preach
[52:43] to to the elected
[52:46] lady and to the sav
[52:48] church because there's many
[52:51] people that are not going to be in the
[52:54] bright but they will be saved that's the
[52:58] same
[53:00] church but they're not going to be saved
[53:03] unless they hear the
[53:05] message of the king the end time
[53:10] message by the elected
[53:13] lady there's people that's all they want
[53:16] to do today is take they don't need
[53:20] leadership they don't know what they're
[53:22] talking about the devil has this receiv
[53:25] their
[53:26] minds because everybody has to
[53:30] hear the message now do I have to
[53:35] hear I've already heard it there's
[53:38] nothing you can tell me that I don't
[53:42] know you know why I know it because God
[53:46] is in
[53:47] me I have for knowledge my
[53:53] predestination I I know my Destin
[53:56] I know where I come from I also know
[53:59] where I'm going that's my
[54:02] reward but I have to go
[54:06] out to the people I feel sorry for
[54:09] people everywhere I
[54:12] go trying to make it with
[54:15] religion they asked me do you have
[54:18] religion I said I sure do the blood of
[54:23] Jesus that's my religion
[54:26] nothing
[54:27] else nothing more I don't care what
[54:31] anybody tells
[54:32] me I know who I
[54:34] am I know where I come from I know where
[54:38] I'm
[54:39] going I go to
[54:41] places people surround me they said
[54:45] brother pis are you going to
[54:47] minister I said no my sons
[54:50] are I they say but I but we want to hear
[54:52] you brother P I said you will when you
[54:56] hear my
[54:57] son they're good and they're the best
[55:01] amen amen so that's the way it
[55:05] is so then if I do
[55:09] something it's because it becometh me
[55:13] and Jesus to fulfill
[55:18] that amen you you understand it has
[55:22] nothing to do with
[55:24] religion this will scare the scarecrows
[55:27] birds away and everything this
[55:30] scarecrow it's not
[55:32] that the beautiful thing
[55:35] is that he
[55:37] knew just say it to
[55:41] yourself he
[55:44] knew how he loved
[55:47] me can you
[55:50] comprehend how much he loved
[55:53] you and and see what a bunch of gripers
[55:56] we
[56:00] are always griping about
[56:04] this when I was I don't know where I was
[56:08] but as I was meditating on
[56:12] Election I
[56:14] thought I thought of a
[56:16] word that comes to
[56:19] me and the Word
[56:21] was
[56:23] depression
[56:25] and I began to look into
[56:31] depression
[56:33] and I looked of course I looked it up in
[56:35] the
[56:37] dictionary it says the state or feeling
[56:41] of being
[56:46] depressed in
[56:48] spirit not in
[56:50] physical when you when you're depressed
[56:53] it's not a physical problem
[56:58] it is spiritual
[57:01] problem you you you've seen because
[57:05] had
[57:08] depressed my wife many times she says
[57:11] aren't you feeling
[57:14] good I said I feel all
[57:16] right well you look
[57:19] sad you look
[57:22] depressed I said I am far from being
[57:27] depressed what is
[57:29] it is that when I meditate on
[57:35] him I I look
[57:38] sad is that I'm thinking about
[57:42] him or maybe I am getting a message from
[57:47] him he says brother pis you get messages
[57:51] from
[57:53] God what do you think you're you're
[57:57] hearing this is a message from
[58:00] God that God gave to
[58:03] me to bring it to
[58:06] you so then when you find a
[58:10] person depressed in
[58:14] spirit it means he has a lost state of
[58:21] strength or
[58:23] energy a period of subnormal economic
[58:32] activity as I wrote that down in my
[58:36] notes I wrote many other things in my
[58:39] notes which I numbered or letter from a
[58:43] to I
[58:49] think and I and I and I and I go through
[58:52] them because I just
[58:55] performed a 50th wedding
[59:04] anniversary and I I made a
[59:08] statement which maybe didn't go good
[59:10] with a lot of
[59:12] people but I I
[59:15] asked I asked the
[59:17] lady I said you've been married to this
[59:20] guy for 50
[59:23] years she said
[59:25] yes I said now is your chance you're
[59:28] free to
[59:32] go and then and then maybe a religious
[59:35] guy would this say well how would he say
[59:40] that I just took it from the
[59:43] scriptures everything that was in
[59:46] bondage was set
[59:49] free it said
[59:51] everything that was in bondage when the
[59:54] trumpet sounded to sound the Jubilee be
[59:58] set free but if they didn't want to go
[1:00:02] they would Mark
[1:00:04] him is that
[1:00:06] right and she said
[1:00:09] no I would never leave him I said well
[1:00:12] then they'll never complain because you
[1:00:14] had a second
[1:00:18] chance I said many couples never get to
[1:00:23] 50 I never got to 50 with my first
[1:00:28] wife she was 32 years old when she
[1:00:33] died right now we' have been married 43
[1:00:38] years but I I began to think on
[1:00:45] depression and I think my wife shared
[1:00:47] this with me that she got from the
[1:00:52] internet but she told me that 60% of the
[1:00:58] people that reach the age of
[1:01:04] 60 are
[1:01:06] depressed so you know the people that
[1:01:08] are depressed they usually have to give
[1:01:11] him some kind of
[1:01:15] pills
[1:01:17] amen amen amen but you know what is it a
[1:01:22] crime to be depressed
[1:01:26] our Spirits are
[1:01:28] low so then I begin to
[1:01:31] think what is it that keeps us
[1:01:36] going I mean there has to be an energy
[1:01:40] field
[1:01:43] somewhere to keep us from being
[1:01:49] depressed do you know why so many people
[1:01:51] take
[1:01:53] drugs cuz they're
[1:01:55] depressed and it gives them a
[1:01:58] highight yes they they they feel good so
[1:02:01] when the drugs starts woring
[1:02:05] up they have to take more drugs to come
[1:02:09] up
[1:02:11] again is any difference taking those
[1:02:14] drugs than going to a drug store and
[1:02:17] taking what they call illegal
[1:02:23] drug it's the same thing but why is it
[1:02:27] that people cannot find and escape from
[1:02:32] this because they're treating it
[1:02:37] physically it's not a physical
[1:02:39] problem it's a spiritual
[1:02:43] problem something's going on inside of
[1:02:46] you something maybe God is trying to
[1:02:49] move inside of you and you fight
[1:02:53] that best thing to
[1:02:56] do stand
[1:02:58] still take just heed to
[1:03:01] God see what God has for
[1:03:04] you and then act on what he
[1:03:08] says because if you don't act on it
[1:03:12] you're not going to be
[1:03:14] liberated what you want is
[1:03:17] Liberation
[1:03:20] deed do you think having having money
[1:03:23] will take you a
[1:03:26] depression money has nothing to do with
[1:03:30] depression it has to do with
[1:03:33] it when that's all you think about is
[1:03:35] money money
[1:03:37] money be content with what you
[1:03:41] have give God thanks for what you
[1:03:44] have give him honor and
[1:03:48] Glory it's not what you have it's who
[1:03:52] has
[1:03:53] you
[1:03:55] if if God has got a hold of
[1:03:58] you recognize it that when something's
[1:04:02] happening inside of
[1:04:04] you something spiritual it is not
[1:04:08] physical it is God trying to tell you
[1:04:12] something stop and
[1:04:16] listen no matter how much your body
[1:04:18] wants to
[1:04:20] move make it sit
[1:04:23] down be subject
[1:04:26] by that would stop a lot of people from
[1:04:28] doing a lot of things they
[1:04:32] do this
[1:04:34] depression
[1:04:36] 60% of the people over 60 years old are
[1:04:45] depressed so you that are in your 50s
[1:04:47] watch
[1:04:49] it but some of you already got a head
[1:04:51] start on it so some of you
[1:04:55] amen is
[1:04:58] depression
[1:05:00] amen is that
[1:05:02] pretty that's
[1:05:04] election when when God elects
[1:05:07] you when you recognize
[1:05:10] it like I said a while ago who elected
[1:05:15] us the church no it's not the church
[1:05:19] it's God when did he elect us before the
[1:05:23] foundation of the
[1:05:24] world who is the only man that knew he
[1:05:27] was
[1:05:30] elected that was Jesus Christ how come
[1:05:33] we didn't know because our minds were
[1:05:38] darkened we couldn't understand
[1:05:41] it something had to
[1:05:43] happen for us to get to the place that
[1:05:48] Jesus Christ
[1:05:50] is why do you
[1:05:53] think we see in
[1:05:56] heaven Christ
[1:05:58] Jesus we not everybody sits
[1:06:01] there but when you recognize who your
[1:06:05] Savor
[1:06:06] is Lord is you sit in Heavenly
[1:06:11] places you are with him you're
[1:06:15] enjoying all the
[1:06:17] promises all the
[1:06:19] blessings everything he
[1:06:21] promis you receive them
[1:06:24] in Heavenly
[1:06:26] places what is the difference
[1:06:29] between into
[1:06:31] natural or
[1:06:34] Supernatural hardly
[1:06:36] nothing hardly nothing they're both
[1:06:40] natural when brother Bram called for the
[1:06:46] squirrels was that natural or
[1:06:50] superal it was superal superal
[1:06:55] Supernatural produced the
[1:06:57] natural and the
[1:06:59] natural was a
[1:07:01] squirtle don't kill me it's a
[1:07:04] Hony I'm I'm in space and I'm
[1:07:07] Supernatural and I got giftes of this no
[1:07:11] you have that what we have is a
[1:07:16] natural doing
[1:07:19] Supernatural don't know
[1:07:22] about that's why he don't
[1:07:25] N I tell you Earthly
[1:07:27] things you don't believe me what if I
[1:07:31] was to tell
[1:07:33] you the
[1:07:36] supernatural what if I was to tell
[1:07:39] you where is your
[1:07:41] body you say this is my
[1:07:44] body yes but that body is going to
[1:07:48] Decay Paul saw the
[1:07:51] supernatural he said I know
[1:07:54] that if this body
[1:07:57] be I have a more
[1:08:01] excellent
[1:08:03] Supernatural Wai for me in the
[1:08:06] heaven Supernatural is not something
[1:08:08] just just you know like you know how
[1:08:10] people want to get religious oh I I
[1:08:15] Sawan that's what you
[1:08:19] saw when I see God doing
[1:08:22] something it's
[1:08:25] natural and because God did did
[1:08:27] it it's super super but it's still
[1:08:32] natural he told Brother
[1:08:34] Brom how many squirrels did you say you
[1:08:38] wanted didn't you say you wanted
[1:08:42] three he said that's only
[1:08:44] two and he got another
[1:08:47] one and he shot it and then he said
[1:08:50] Visions
[1:08:52] don't
[1:08:55] but the
[1:08:56] natural don't get so
[1:08:59] religious to be a
[1:09:02] fanatic just be humble but you can't you
[1:09:05] cannot be what you're
[1:09:08] not when you have the nature of
[1:09:12] God you will do God's
[1:09:16] things only
[1:09:18] that and solely
