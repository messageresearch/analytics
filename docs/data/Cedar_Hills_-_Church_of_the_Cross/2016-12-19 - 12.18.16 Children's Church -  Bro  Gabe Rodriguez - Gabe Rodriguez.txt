doing tonight good that's good uh we had a great service this morning didn't we like to thank brother Tommy for that and today I'm going to talk to the children about something everyone's mothers probably have on the ring can you guys guess what that would be he's quick exactly diamonds and we've heard the story of the wheat before how it's crafted and what it goes through but today I like to talk about the diamond so diamonds are made from one thing it's pure carbon and carbon is the most abundant the fourth most abundant element in the world so why aren't diamonds everywhere if they're abundant you guys have any idea cuz not all carbon goes through What It Takes and can take all the struggles of being a diamond and us as children of God are like carbon and so is the world but we are a special kind of carbon and we get to be shaped into diamonds and carbon what it takes to make carbon is has to be at least 2732 de F now I'll go open oven when my mom's making a cake and it's to like 350 and I'll feel like I burnt my face off but 2700 de I don't know if I could even take that and then it takes oh my good so much pressure to make a diamond it takes 78,000 lb 7 8,000 lb that's that's a lot I'll Jam my toe in like a table and I'll cry myself to sleep it's like equivalent to 400 men stepping on your pinky toe I don't even think you'd have a pinky toe after that and then besides the extreme circumstances to shape it it takes 1 billion to 3.3 billion years to make so oh sorry I'm a little nervous okay thank you [Applause] Ronnie so it's not an easy process and it's not a quick one either neither is it to be a child of God and the word Diamond comes from the Greek word adamus which means proper unalterable and Unbreakable which I believe are also characteristics that can be used to descri describe any true Christian so what makes a diamond a diamond well first you got carrots people like oh I got a one carrot and stuff like that and then you got cut there are so many types of cuts and hardly any are ever the same they're all unique in their own special ways and then there's color which is usually judged by how close it is to White and then you have Clarity usually when they judge Clarity they go by if there's any blemishes in it most diamonds are blemish free and if you got a perfect diamond it is called a paragon how many here believe that they are Paragons diamonds are the hardest known natural material in the world they're not made just to look pretty they also can take pretty much anything you can throw at them and diamonds the interesting thing is because diamonds are made from carbon and carbon is known for being it likes to bond with other elements and it can make up to 10 million compounds so as just carbon it reacts with almost pretty much anything but once carbon is turned into a diamond it won't react with any other chemicals in the world so now I'm going to talk about how diamonds are shaped diamonds at first they they look like a normal Rock if I was to throw a diamond say outside you'd probably wouldn't even pick it up because you wouldn't think anything of it cuz it's raw and it hasn't been shaped yet so it's almost worthless that brings me to read a scripture from or a quote from brother brandham if the guys put it up for me says Kimberly South Africa once I was looking at diamonds how they brought up out of the ground and I seen them laying there as while the superintendent of the plant or the mine was one of my ushers in the prayer line and I noticed the diamonds valued at tens of thousands of dollars piled together but they didn't Sparkle even under the light and I said to the superintendent of the mines I said why don't they sparkle he said sir they haven't been cut yet you see diamonds can't reflect light until they're cut because they can't absorb that light until they've been cut and each and every Christian before they can reflect God has to be cut and shaped you see there are three different methods to cutting the Diamonds the first one which is the oldest recorded is cleaving it's nothing difficult it's actually pretty simple it's chiseled at the point of of weakness you just get a chisel and it doesn't make sense because diamonds are the strongest naturally thing in the world but you see the gem cutter which would be God in our case he finds that point of weakness and with a simple tap cuts it off and then he begins to shape us more delicately and then you have a skade which is a polishing wheel which this is pretty nice I think it's with oil and the only thing that they use to finally cut another diamond is Diamond itself just like how steel sharpens steel and then for even more precise shaping we have a diamond saw which is also oil and diamond dust and you see the gem cutter they have to be very careful with what they're doing because as they're cutting and cutting you can't just keep going because you see the saw makes friction with the diamond if you get friction you get heat you see if you put a diamond through too much heat it'll explode actually with that I'd like to read First Corinthians 10:13 if you like to turn to it and it reads there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are evil but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it so as they're cutting this diamond they don't just hammer it and Hammer it cuz they know that diamond won't be able to take it all just as God knows that he'll only give us what we can bear because if you just keep hammering and hammering it sooner or later you're not going to have a diamond anymore it'll just be dust so how many here believe that they are diamonds any of you some of you kids might still be carbon and that's all right because all Christians start as something don't we you see that's the thing about God's grace is he takes us from being nothing to being something beautiful and Priceless and we as Christians we're much more than a diamond the Bible says 20,000 worlds and I don't know about you but that's just amazing how we can be I don't sometimes we don't feel worthy or like we can be valued as such a thing but we don't value ourselves is that God who values us I'm sorry I'm very nerv so as I was talking about how many of you kids ever feel like you're under a lot of pressure a lot of troubles in life you guys ever feel like that I know you're just kids but it's pretty tough life isn't it kids got problems too and maybe if you don't got problems right now I'm going to tell you right now if you're going to be a Christian it's not an easy walk you're always going to have pressure if you think that 78,000 lbs is a lot for a diamond you're in for a whole lot more but you see it's the rough things that make Christians so unique and special and do you guys think any like let's say if carbon could talk which it don't but if it could do you think any carbon like all carbon might look at a diamond and be like oh yeah I want to be a diamond why not it's beautiful perfect but if carbon was to know what it would go through do you guys think it'd ever want to be a diamond see the thing is carbon doesn't choose to be a diamond it's chosen to be [Applause] and the thing about diamonds is what makes them so special is how it's hard to find them it's not like they just pop up out of the ground if they did it be no different from dirt it wouldn't even be special anymore diamond is hidden thousands of miles under the Earth's crust so it doesn't just come out it's not easy to find you have to work for it you see the diamond never looks for the minor it's always the minor that has to find the diamond and just like that that's also God looking for us we we've never sought God but see it's cuz that Miner knows that that diamond is worth so much more takes 1 billion to 3.3 billion years and it's crazy because that's probably just as old as the Earth is see as Christians it's not an easy walk you know we all go through our struggles and I know you guys are just kids right now but I just want to let you guys know that it's not going to be easy and it's never easy to be a Christian and it's going to be tough for you all but you all will eventually and I know each and every one of you if you stay in God's perfect will you all will become so much more than what you you are now and you will be valued in the eyes of God thank you wow for someone to think of us as diamonds praise the Lord praise the Lord amen that's my little brother as I like to refer him as amen if we're going to sing a song but if any of the young children has a a special or testimony we're going to have a little testimony service right now so you just keep that in mind if when we finish the song if you have one just come on up amen would you please stand and we'll sing a song His Banner Over Me Is Love I feel l so much today
