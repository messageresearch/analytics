be for you have abandoned yourself totally to me now there is no more fear of the future you've truly believed you have opened your heart to the truth and cannot be deceived deliver me O Lord you cried you bowed low and opened your heart when you were tried how much more will I deliver one who humbles himself and surrenders all to me for I try the hearts and souls of men and nothing is hidden and I see man shall receive his recompense when he is humble and bow slow pray for mercy for my people that eternal life I may bestow I long to gather each one up that none be lost but child there's a lot to do so come but come the cost it will mean you giving up your time your freedom for theirs laying down your life in prayer to snatch them from hell's fire what do you do what you do now eternal will be so count the cost and take up your cross and follow me the eleventh hour is here each one willing will have a work to do some will fast and pray others will speak and many will give their

Nicki Minaj them Esperanto because we don't have a lot of time left I remember our founding pastor one time say acuerdo de snack God will be able and he is able doses capacity to justify sanctify and baptize a person with the Holy Ghost all at the same time who stiphu cars let's be carry about the cell con el acento Ptolemies man and that's quite a sane because we understand the three stages of grace is a process for content demos God is not in time temple though time is in God okay how many understand that there are many times that that he been God I wish a this is KL Co Co we think of a process as time and someone was a new process it was so good when when we were talking to to brother John brother King John I call him Kondo Lamas goodness terminal John hey and brother Abraham was speaking and he asked the question and he says did Jesus did he resurrect on Saturday or Sunday so la pregunta necesito kazoos el sábado el domingo and of course then you have people that'll say well he resurrected on Sunday in which I hit the aisle Domingo he said no he didn't no notices he did not resurrect in a time body well he did not resurrect on a Saturday or Sunday notice it or none don't he resurrected into eternity necesito in that tell me that when you understand those things content in this course I realize that God is able to take the whole process and and and fulfill it right away you experimental process we completely missed about five 10 15 years to do the three stages of grace no necesita I'm use para completed once again he can justify sanctify and filled with the Holy Ghost the person at the same time a la persona who syphilis even was guests to sit am undercover because they don't have the time to to gradually ripen over a period like we have had por que no tenemos tiempo para que realmente Madrid much we are seen is the former and the latter rain falling in the same season lo que temos yendo a la misma temporada is that you get their prana la lluvia tardy and will get that in a moment you know a minute is 81 11 and 12 he say yes mean you know on same birthday of Douma he called callers to me out of seer watchmen what of the night watchmen what of the night Kazuma madam boss says they said they say I require that k ID esta noche what is that ki de la noche the watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if you will inquire inquiry return come it could what that espanol la mañana viene this president noche si priyo entire is pregunta was then even eat and the question that arises is how is the morning coming in the night at the same time hey como es que la mañana la noche beer thank God for a prophet that he clarifies those things let's just wouldn't profit that cat and he says the reason being it is al lettuce or is that right before the Sun comes out is kept as a kiss and let's hold it is the darkest part of the night is no muscle sciutto de la noche he said and that's why the morning and the night cometh for this was que la noche de mañana en and when we look at those things Amira Moses makes us so aware of where we are at right now let's se step tanto el puntal on this that was that though the Sun of righteousness has arisen with healing in his wings I'm here actually speaking he has already risen ESP tourism yes le o then we also are waiting then for a coming his coming entonces Jimenez paramos to Juanita and that would be as sometime in the morning early in the morning algún tipo de manana and and looking and understanding what time and what our we are living in Nando and Katie employ already the most we realize that it is the most deceptive time that there has ever been in all of humanity that was Quinta kissing him coming and your son Katie because it is the darkest time of the whole night or kissing Laura mussels good at it right before the coming of the Lord we realize all hell has emptied out all in fear knows that it has enlarged its mouth anger and this used to work but all my all of heaven parity mental and still has now prepared now does that refer now or the greatest event that will let that there will ever be parallel into Muslim de cabrito and that is the return of Jesus Christ to catch away his bride that regressors in your case ooh Cristo para tomar su because of this time that we are living in yes at least attempt linking we must constantly be trying the spirit comentate spiritus it is such a dark time that that you don't realize many times where the spirits come from a school of Isis cannot say that Quentin has we preached last Sunday como pre-cum who seldom restore in the laity mr. Brando Allah it has a believer come okay again we must be able to discern the spirit in each person their aim was the player this little is peter las personas we must be able to discern the spirit in us in his people noonim and we must be able to discern the spirit that influences us los the speaker cannot seem flew in because many times we're always looking at the spirit that that if that that is in our brother or sister must be to kiss time that's why we must discern those things also yes thank you no promises there but it always must begin at the house of God and you are the house later on I want to tell you this morning that each one of you is fearfully and wonderfully made this heedless care how many believe that each one of you has been given a gift you know sighs I don't don't to help the body of Christ how did you that what if Pleiades and I said once again every one of you here Caillou no you stay Sachi how many believe me what was McCain every one of you has something to to edify and help the body of Christ I don't know very difficult yet she says I can like yellow and maybe you're embarrassed about your gift just independent is maybe you've been hiding your gift she said little tusks on the end maybe somebody told me told you that you would amount to nothing but let me tell you that every one of you is important to the body of Christ I don't find el puerto Christos we're asked as important as the other one I see como la trobe but the question is are you using what you have been given penile apprentices Dowson the location is do to benefit the body of Christ beneficial quit playing the question is la pregunta and you submit your gift to the gift well yes Amaterasu don't I don't that's where many people fail eyes on them which identified is that many people we are as I said have a gift but we are not willing to submit it to the gift they don't look at em so make they're loyal because of that yeah those are this we go back to it - just a moment of last Sun from last Sunday vamos I'm in second Domingo pasa because we have to understand that that in the church and it was kept in their killing list there is an order that has been established by the Holy Ghost I in order than Estella sido for list and if we work outside of the realm of those of what he has already placed is he grandma's wear that is his plan then we are out of his will and does the most of what I assume once again remember that the highest authority in the local church is the pastor what is the killer Tony that myself and only less yell is Laurel and that's what brother BAM calls the past or the elderly man around your Bible you know what I'm talking about she's telling us where we look at that Wendell me Thomas and we realize you know that most weather there's where people get their funny ideas I use them they like him personally consciously that's where they go off thinking that their unit all by themselves Olympus and okay so not only that they use and that they don't need anyone else he can no necesitan and I'm here to tell you that though gifts and callings are without repentance okay your mellows now you doing this one scene that all they can work when Oh Brad but let me tell you if they are not in the perfect will of God see no Stan and I will hold up perfect and you're out of the of the perfect wheel it's the federal and that God has placed in the church they leveled up they'll Plunkett use DNA / that's when we began to think that we don't need no one else because we have it all ourselves it's something but someone's up in second no necesitamos nothing I'll tell you from me they can best utilize their me without you seen Estella it's out the Holy Spirit is on why because I'm part of the same body orchestra parte del mismo and are my whole mentality in me mentally their whole mentality mentally that should simply be they what am i doing to edify that body that I'm a part of history haciendo pattern if you can see cuerpo del cual sweet but our duty then is to discern the spirits and Cosa Nostra where is the middle quarter we don't just take someone's word for it just because they're a Reverend so-and-so no sort of almost pull up a lot of the alien gravity or because they're older than us or focus on my illness or because one seems more spiritual than us so for goodness I mean I'm a City know we must try the spirits no one knows his spirit watches brother branham begins to show us he is a common laminar anyhow that we must discern the spirits of all is there any law says in the message to sermon a spirit in a second now remember this PDT we are talking about the former and the latter rain that was a blunder like you know if a man comes you know Bolivian and he has a great gift Atheneum grant no matter if he belongs to our to a denomination or another denomination no participant in this he says don't judge him by what denomination he comes from whose get purple diminish unity how he dresses of almost every state but what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift look it's tequila various cannot pretend receptionist what purpose he has a propósito tea if he's trying to take his influence seto mile that must be in flames and build himself a great name out of it TCK si quieres aroun grande nombre de I would have discernment of spirit enough your tent Els Taunton is gonna be music know that that's wrong no matter how great a teacher he is they put the kitten grandma wanna share watch how great a teacher he is he's a kitten when maestro say that's what former rain is looking rain this when a you've no matter how great a teaching here is input that getting and maestro's how powerful he is ok Tampa later how intellectual he listened intellect or how gift operates he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of Christ sees Ruth in tumors looking at a group identify your spiritual discernment' will tell you that that's wrong please sentiment appropriately that cases that don't matter how accurate or how perfectly protected on perfecto it's wrong if it is not used for the body of Christ Amalia necessarily it is to achieve something but I look at that maybe he's got a great gift that he could draw people together with great instance intellectual or spiritual power openness intellect while they could draw people together Helana looking maybe he's trying to take that gift and make himself famous so that he'll have a big name is that the metaphor mostly know that other brother will look at him as some big person but I cannot remember Lumira and communal and person that's then that's wrong s tamale what is it's it's not hard to discern how easy it is to discern the Lord's necessary to discern the spirit of a man listening what if he has a gift of God is trying to edify the body of Christ such as if you couldn't work but I don't care what he belongs to Newport Anandapur to Niska because you're not discerning the man porque no studies in the end all your discerning the spirit Tyson in doing the lies that is in the man let me like a standalone but and that's what God told us to do not one time was we ever commissioned to discern the man's group and he won't give wasn't as coincidence you know group but we were constrained and commanded of God medicine as a manned or by God to discern the spirit in the man for those things what he's trying to do and what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to look at his business would be that now we're starting to hit the target okay that's what we're trying to do this morning and look if we're trying to focus in and and see and hit the target the bull's eye and it was apparently that Lancome if we go and we're hitting everywhere íbamos it that much because we need to focus in a little bit Jenna most we need to adjust here a little bit to the right or left and up or down boost and this will pocket the lady show up and so it is with us yes if we're going to Africa si vamos a tonic you try to make a name for ourselves instead of just didn't know but it but also that we can be puffed up when I stand around in flower I'm against they all look what we've done you mean I look cameras hey Cho we are totally wrong estamos totalmente malli you with me church it's not why we go but it's not noise can we go to edify the body of Christ over there vamos eyes if you can't work play Chris play and when we look at this we realize then as we read the book of Joanne Bemis Kelly mustn't leave that he promised to pour out of his spirit upon all flesh Oh mr. master speed to Soviet Academy and we realize though that was the rain falls on the just and the unjust Castle Houska we all know we've heard many messages on that yeah I mean so when we speak about rain but mostly do we speak about the spirit that's falling along as LSP to kiss and there's so many people throughout the years in which they talk about the former latter rain island alike you get them prom night this day they really pushed the latter rain movement Emporia how many I've ever heard on the of the latter rain movement what does I know either like you yet yeah yeah big it's it's a big movement it's a momento grande and it's called the latter rain movement isn't moving into like you yet the bottom line is that people in general they want to be part of something bigger than themselves Gundam they want to be part of some great movement so what do they do it Duchess can see they joined themselves into different movements say only naam which is moving me and the movements that maybe have the same ideas or viewpoints as them mementos que tienen los mismos i it is he that mo came in as course and those of you that go into into to social network you know nowadays it's called the hash tag every time there's a movement going on how this can hashtag and whatever the movement is has taken moving into every but oh I'm part of this hashtag movement testimonial and what it does then that then it brings people supposedly you look at together trailer hit their own ear as well because it is a tree of knowledge of good and evil but cuz you never will they they cannot see me again in this these social media outlets it's the lowest they use it as a way of showing their support for a certain cause let's assemble a panel responders whose progress countless the point is to share certain issues el punto de compartir steatosis with a friend or if you have followers soon amigo city nice Aikido raised in hopes that they will share the same information as parents are given a compartir la misma and what they're trying to do is they're trying to activate you look at that the active at or get a discussion going or concerning that matter oh come on Sarah because I want you to realize once again that it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil you may see the little kissing let go till the end that in one way it brings people together like emptiness but in another sense it incites good or I'm sorry it incites evil you know motivate losing your mind because the mind or the purpose or or or what what what is produced from this I should say but que lo que si producer holidays though is that if someone does not share my point of view you know compared to me Punto at least then they are the enemy and this one is that right then and we have that is just dividing not just the nation it divides the world oh the villainous you hashtag this oh you're not part of that hashtag you're the enemy then the way that we look at things as they look a bit more less but it's no different in the religious world in realms in Iran rarely here soon worried it's Oscars former rain and latter rain too many people it's just a movement of the spirit but if what you hit this movie into a list but they are not just movements there's no sort of Sun it's not just a movement of the spirits one of them we need to make you feel better than than everyone else but us never said this to me hotel does it man that's the carnal way of thinking there's many movements I muchos moving but when you look at this little former latter rain pero cuando Mira's thank you umbria you to an understanding of what it really is no Simonton immune to the look is the former rain isn't and and lateral rain is not just some movement like you get them yet no no Masterson movie even though it causes countless movements I'll get a muchos moving by all especially impersonators that lost in person if you can notice but the real former and latter rain Juliet the planet that these are the seasons of the word sole assassin is de la palabra now once again I'm gonna say it again cuz I want you to get this it's not about a movement most rapid move even though it is a movement okay soon move money it's about the word and the season of each of the word that a true believer understands that and Carolyn yes there has to be a season for every word that God has spoken they didn't give any

hmm show me by the Bible brother Ram says he said munro waster me por la vie de cinéma no Brandon what's greater in the Bible case mas Grande than a local elder to a local church Lana look Alden what this whole and complete authority of the church is the pastor completely this is there are no one above that alder knowing I am I so understand you know even though there are many elders don't catch up which is something the church in the ELISA but the elder it'll aliens the former one is a battle tablished the church in the right teaching and establish telling this you're not unless against a charissa I'm gonna say it again I'm gonna say it again the former one along today it is the one that established the church in the holy through the Holy Ghost established early list you had a brother before armor rain to the local church is that what I do yet temprana unlikely she a local you'll understand that it's not a different ministry is a ministry it's el mismo ministerial at a higher

leadership there's no capacity listen let's go the elegant which moves with political - yes - guess it mindedness Kasem where a political men yes men placed his church in the care of God ordained who saw cigarette filled their own little world a living men hombres que una vida pull through feeding them the word begin a la Pueblo he has not elaborated the people into classes nor said but I like

us like you wiggle out of it nothing that there are some far days though oh yes she says further there is no place no I you lugar in the world where priests or ministers mediate between God and the people nor with you nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord zip analysis now that I understand you God wants all to love and serve Him together and what nikolay anism does he look at nikolay it destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people's the perilous ministers l well that makes the leaders overlords the instead of servants yes yellow status of Moscow del signore else this doctrine actually started as a deed in the first church in Athena comenzó como a chosen and it appears is that the problem lay in two words jealous palabras can send those palabra Hauser's which is press preachers and overseers which is Bishop then though the scripture shows a look at that there are several elders in each church pasensya knows and emigration began Uno's MPs the Ignatius among them English isn't to teach that the idea of a bishop and circulate there they obese was one of preeminence or authority the preeminence territory that control over elders control so little since he knows now the truth of the matter is the word elder lalala signifies the person significant a person ah it signifies who the person is in his lap and once again alder and signifies who the person is akin is that while the word bishop the pilar adobe signifies the office of the same man significant official emizner purse the elder is the man the bishop is the office of that man yellow bees buzzing official elder always has and always will refers simply to a man's chronological age in the lord alcaman tennyson your he is an elder it's not because he is elected or ordained no but Casilla he ordered a not because he is older for kissing he is more seasoned brain not a novice noise know what he's reliable and dependent because of its experience across the experience and long-standing proof of his christian experience is in the premise that paralysis piano connect spanish that's why of all of the elders here the tone of the older one is the elder here that's right because of his experience to experience not a novice please one that teaches but he does not teach his own better new thing yellow the end is what we got to understand I don't teach my own man understand you me procurement I've gotta take what was originally planted October local authority now maintain what's what's where we're getting to once again the

you don't understand what former in little radius they throw it way out in left field or just right yeah it's bad the elder I may believe that that's a criminal so then I understanding then yes as we as we as we go we turn a corner Skeena brother Brown said I believe in the sovereignty of the local church in the manner and the sacredness to Eternia then the one who establishes the local church sister literally less yellow kyle is the elder for the former one well in theory order he established this church in established English through the Holy Ghost Travis del Espino son that's what we're
