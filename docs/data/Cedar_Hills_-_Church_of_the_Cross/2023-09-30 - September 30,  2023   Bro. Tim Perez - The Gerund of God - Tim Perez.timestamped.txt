[1:04:20] you with me okay now that I got your
[1:04:23] attention
[1:04:24] it says that I am called by thy name
[1:04:30] the Lord God of hosts okay and when you
[1:04:35] see God of hosts
[1:04:37] he's talking about an army
[1:04:39] and you are the Army
[1:04:42] all right you're the Army I haven't even
[1:04:45] started the guy oh my goodness here we
[1:04:48] go let's go let's go with that Luke
[1:04:50] chapter 24 verse 45 Lucas
[1:04:53] 24 45 of Luke because
[1:04:57] slide number five
[1:05:01] gotta get going all right

[1:05:08] slide number five
[1:05:10] please
[1:05:12] I gotta be nice
[1:05:16] okay Luke chapter 24 45 I'll just read
[1:05:20] it
[1:05:21] he
[1:05:23] then he opened their minds
[1:05:26] read it with me okay then he opened
[1:05:29] their minds
[1:05:31] so they could understand the scriptures
[1:05:35] okay so so when he opens the minds
[1:05:39] he's opening the mind that are in the
[1:05:43] heart
[1:05:45] okay he's opening the mind
[1:05:48] that's in the heart okay the mind is in
[1:05:54] the heart is
[1:06:21] and in the house there's many spaces
[1:06:24] and one of those spaces you know this
[1:06:27] was the spot you call a bedroom is that
[1:06:30] right
[1:06:31] and you call it a kitchen
[1:06:34] laundry
[1:06:35] the living room they're all spaces okay
[1:06:39] God did the same thing in your heart
[1:06:46] and in that space
[1:06:50] foreign

[1:21:13] is the Supernatural is
[1:21:16] okay you've got to be seeing him

[1:22:33] shame on you
[1:22:35] expect us
[1:22:39] you have to be training them jealous
[1:22:43] that's not our job
[1:22:45] but we spend so much time
[1:22:49] putting out fires
[1:22:53] okay fires incendios
[1:22:59] your house is on fire
[1:23:03] okay
[1:23:07] you follow what I'm saying
[1:23:17] you hear me
[1:23:19] all right I haven't got your attention
[1:23:21] all right
[1:23:22] the problem is we're thinking too much
[1:23:25] with this
[1:23:26] instead of not thinking with it the
[1:23:29] problem is okay and the greatest battles
[1:23:38] wants to do something and this one down
[1:23:42] here
[1:23:44] doesn't want to do it there's the battle
[1:23:51] foreign
[1:24:28] shalom
[1:24:54] do you know why there's a battle
[1:24:56] there's no Mutual consent
[1:24:59] um
[1:25:03] this guy here going one way yesterday
[1:25:06] and the other guy
[1:25:17] how many of you have over 20 years
[1:25:25] wow that's a lot how did
[1:25:29] how did we become so critical
[1:25:31] um
[1:25:46] look
[1:25:48] I've been born and raised in the church
[1:25:54] I remember
[1:25:55] my cousin
[1:25:57] way back the preacher from eight years
[1:26:00] old
[1:26:02] we grow up in the church
[1:26:06] we know
[1:26:10] you can say whatever you want to say
[1:26:13] but we see it but
[1:26:16] why is it and the longer you stay in
[1:26:20] church
[1:26:21] the more critical and judgmental you
[1:26:24] must critical is
[1:26:29] and and it's it's so it's so contagious
[1:26:33] it's a virus that is stronger than covet
[1:26:37] because
[1:26:38] let me tell you something brother Baron
[1:26:40] says that the Nations will be producing
[1:26:43] a germ bomb okay
[1:26:47] that will kill
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:10] I have seen death in the face
[1:27:15] I've seen death in the face
[1:27:19] it is
[1:27:30] come finger
[1:27:34] here get out of my way yeah
[1:27:40] you've gotta work together
[1:27:42] you got no business worrying about any
[1:27:45] viruses
[1:27:49] you got something so strong
[1:27:51] you've been inoculated
[1:28:16] all right
[1:28:19] and she wanted coven
[1:28:21] so that she could know how to treat her
[1:28:24] patients
[1:29:02] and I can't touch them
[1:29:07] there's the reason why I Don't Preach
[1:29:10] because I don't like to be on YouTube
[1:29:12] and if you preach the message in the
[1:29:15] fullness the way it is
[1:29:24] too many weak Focus this is
[1:29:29] okay
[1:29:31] are you tired
[1:29:33] all right
[1:29:34] are you enjoying this is
[1:29:38] let's give God a cash problems
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:48] okay so there's the battle right
[1:29:52] that there's a battle going on
[1:29:54] you got a person up here
[1:29:57] you got a battle going on okay you have
[1:30:00] two people driving your ship coming up
[1:30:04] which one drives the ship
[1:30:07] is
[1:30:10] the one that got his hand on the rudder
[1:30:17] okay the captain of the ship he sits out
[1:30:19] and he can see the Seas
[1:30:22] right and he's the captain
[1:30:25] and and he says turn it to the left
[1:30:29] and Israeli and the guy down at the
[1:30:31] bottom
[1:30:33] so he can move the rudder
[1:30:36] so the boat can go to the left
[1:30:39] and I'll let you Ellie it's not the
[1:30:41] captain that's running that's driving
[1:30:43] the boat
[1:30:46] it's the guy at the runners
[1:30:52] Iglesia
[1:31:02] in the church in Iglesia that believe
[1:31:04] the message okay
[1:31:07] one group
[1:31:08] um
[1:31:10] and there's another group that believes
[1:31:15] and this is a fuss that's going on in
[1:31:17] the church
[1:31:18] and I'm telling you the ones the ones
[1:31:20] that'll receive the messages
[1:31:22] okay you're messing it up
[1:31:48] in your mouth why do you got a cigarette
[1:31:51] in your mouth
[1:31:54] and right away
[1:32:00] what does the Bible says
[1:32:27] it's okay
[1:32:29] just keep on the face okay
[1:32:40] is
[1:32:42] to fall in love with you
[1:32:47] oh Jesus
[1:32:50] if you know my friend
[1:32:52] I want to introduce you to me
[1:32:58] that friend is Amigo
[1:33:02] he's going to help you in everything
[1:33:06] and he's going to help you
[1:33:08] overcome
[1:33:13] all you have to do is
[1:33:16] all in love
[1:33:19] Jesus all right
[1:33:21] you got it
[1:33:23] okay so the person at the Mind la
[1:33:26] persona he says I believe it pastor
[1:33:29] pastor and he does
[1:33:31] and he's here helping yes okay at least
[1:33:35] you're helping and he's he's putting
[1:33:38] sweat and labor
[1:33:40] okay he's there help him
[1:33:45] you love this
[1:33:46] yeah he says I believe this is but
[1:33:50] unless the person that's down here
[1:33:53] then that person is a Persona is not
[1:33:56] going to receive they're healing or
[1:34:00] their request
[1:34:08] all right
[1:34:12] and when you doubt yourself
[1:34:16] the Holy Spirit takes place
[1:34:21] where I'm going right okay but when you
[1:34:25] have a mutual consent between the minds
[1:34:30] and
[1:34:31] the mind
[1:34:34] then faith is activated
[1:34:40] and then your word
[1:34:43] become materialized
[1:34:46] did you hear what I said
[1:34:49] the Bible says
[1:34:51] and they will be given unto you
[1:34:54] you have to eat
[1:34:56] with faith and it will materialize
[1:35:01] I'm
[1:35:03] here to tell you that when you turn on
[1:35:07] the switch
[1:35:10] it's gonna run brutal body
[1:35:14] and it's going to cause a resurrection

[2:02:19] that's the way we grew up
[2:02:22] sons of the pastors
[2:02:29] sometimes you would get brother Bernie
[2:02:31] not you
[2:02:32] know
[2:02:33] brothers
[2:02:36] and then they would go home
[2:02:39] yeah
[2:02:45] the members of the house
[2:02:48] yeah we took we took it
[2:02:55] I said you know what
[2:02:58] I'm here to help you
[2:03:00] I'm here to help you
[2:03:01] and and uh just tell me and I'll I'll
[2:03:06] take care of it
[2:03:07] so it doesn't put you in a position
[2:03:10] that's bad
[2:03:15] I don't know if you understand
[2:03:18] okay but let me tell you something
[2:03:21] selfie has has to be crucified on the
[2:03:24] cross itself and he has to die and run
[2:03:29] again until he brought yesterday the
[2:03:32] Holy Spirit can't come in
[2:03:34] all right you with me all right and so
[2:03:39] so
[2:03:44] I'm wondering if I should give an
[2:03:45] example
[2:03:48] Give an example do you have time
[2:03:53] all right
[2:03:56] the parents
[2:03:58] tells the child
[2:04:00] go throw the trash honey
[2:04:05] foreign
[2:04:14] amen
[2:04:24] amen amen can't hear you okay the office
[2:04:28] of authority told you to throw the trash
[2:04:33] the office of the authority told you to
[2:04:36] lean the kitchen officials
[2:04:41] okay we're talking about the Battle of
[2:04:43] the mind right
[2:04:45] what is the child going to do
[2:04:48] huh
[2:04:49] it depends on who's running the ship
[2:04:51] dependent they can't accept it depends
[2:04:54] it depends on who he listens and yields
[2:04:58] his body too
[2:04:59] it depends on what's planted in the
[2:05:02] bottom of his heart depends
[2:05:04] and if that child is strong wheeled uh
[2:05:11] strong will
[2:05:13] strong-will
[2:05:15] you're going to have problems
[2:05:18] if you've got a docile child that's
[2:05:21] that's a pleasure
[2:05:24] it's probably gonna pay you more than
[2:05:26] the other one
[2:05:31] you hear me
[2:05:33] because the Bible says as as the child
[2:05:36] think is in his heart
[2:05:41] okay so the majority of time
[2:05:44] the child is going to fire
[2:05:50] slide number nine
[2:05:52] okay why is it going to why is it going
[2:05:55] to failure
[2:05:56] it says they're trained the child in the
[2:05:59] way
[2:06:00] he should go and when he is
[2:06:06] all right okay so so what's happening
[2:06:10] what's happening with this problem here
[2:06:13] the child has been told to go through
[2:06:15] the trash
[2:06:16] and he don't do it
[2:06:19] and what's your attitude where are you
[2:06:22] pointing him too
[2:06:28] are you pointing him to the way
[2:06:33] are you training him in the way
[2:06:37] or are you are you forcing him
[2:06:42] are you are you forcing him are you
[2:06:45] forcing her the stuff for Sunday yeah
[2:06:46] I'm trying to get you to think
[2:06:48] there's a reason why you got problems in
[2:06:50] your home problems
[2:06:54] is not the child the delinquent is
[2:07:00] the child is disobedient
[2:07:02] the parent is
[2:07:09] you got a greater problems yeah
[2:07:19] I can stop
[2:07:24] I'm trying to help you
[2:07:32] where's the problem
[2:07:34] where's the problem
[2:07:36] the parent is not doing his job
[2:07:38] correctly
[2:07:40] the parent is not doing the job
[2:07:42] correctly
[2:07:44] okay watch this scenario is how I can
[2:07:48] get away with doing it with you
[2:07:49] somebody else might get hurt
[2:07:56] just be yourself
[2:07:58] [Laughter]
[2:08:01] I got his back
[2:08:06] I
[2:08:08] got your back
[2:08:10] always right
[2:08:14] go through the trash
[2:08:20] I told you today
[2:08:24] are you listening
[2:08:28] what are you staring at kamiras
[2:08:32] in my talking English so I've learned
[2:08:34] English
[2:08:39] with you
[2:08:41] are you dumb it is
[2:08:43] are you a donkey it is it is
[2:08:55] this is the trash that goes here the
[2:08:58] trash cans out there
[2:09:01] did I tell you
[2:09:03] the trash did I tell you
[2:09:06] come on
[2:09:11] thank you
[2:09:15] but some of your parents are
[2:09:16] heavy-handed okay
[2:09:22] and the anointing
[2:09:24] that's on you just understand is a
[2:09:27] million
[2:09:28] worse is pure then the spirit of
[2:09:31] disobedience
[2:09:36] and what what are you planting
[2:09:40] what way are you showing
[2:09:43] that is not the way
[2:09:48] [Applause]
[2:09:53] is that right okay
[2:09:57] if the parent gets upset angry critical
[2:10:00] it bothers is
[2:10:02] critical judgmental
[2:10:05] heavy-handed and a nagger yes
[2:10:12] you hear me are you hearing me parents
[2:10:14] the Holy Spirit don't find you
[2:10:16] attractive Santo

[2:10:32] to them right
[2:10:35] you you all look very beautiful
[2:10:37] you look all very attractive
[2:10:41] but when you start being an anger is
[2:10:46] attractive to the Holy Spirit
[2:10:49] you have breathed the Holy Spirit uh
[2:10:53] you have greed the Holy Spirit okay
[2:11:00] you've grieved away your best friend

[2:11:19] civilizations already swallowing him up
[2:11:23] he don't stand a chance
[2:11:27] there's a way put that put that up there
[2:11:30] take it down there's a way and you're
[2:11:34] not showing him the way
[2:11:37] I told you to do it because I said to do
[2:11:43] it
[2:11:43] you know why you know why I say that
[2:11:46] because the young people process
[2:11:49] I don't have to do it
[2:11:52] because they start they got a spirit
[2:11:54] start talking back okay
[2:12:03] if you've done it say amen
[2:12:10] and I'm ashamed of it
[2:12:12] I'm confessing I'm trying to help you
[2:12:16] you know what and my mom I mean my mom
[2:12:19] told me something and I got that Spirit
[2:12:21] of talking back
[2:12:24] I don't have to do it

[2:12:48] you know my nickname was sorry SGP
[2:12:53] STP you know what STP is
[2:13:03] all right and then when I make a mistake

[2:13:28] okay I'm one who believes in spanking
[2:13:31] I'm one who believes in spankings
[2:13:34] because there's a spirit within the

[2:45:53] and in a little town we grew up in there
[2:45:55] they bottled Sodapop
[2:46:00] that's where they bought it
[2:46:02] yeah and and and and the ones that were
[2:46:06] the reject
[2:46:08] instead of throwing them away
[2:46:12] because in that in those days it was it
[2:46:16] was it was told
[2:46:19] that that
[2:46:20] soda with sugar okay
[2:46:23] was another form of energy
[2:46:27] and so that the parents bought into it
[2:46:33] well I drank soda after tomorrow
[2:46:36] they're in the back
[2:46:38] of water
[2:46:41] I drank so many sodas fill all my teeth
[2:46:45] will run
[2:46:46] I have another nickname
[2:46:49] you know what they used to call me
[2:46:53] molacho
[2:46:57] you hear me
[2:46:59] I say all of that you know why because
[2:47:04] the Bible says that the two Spirits
[2:47:06] would be so close together
[2:47:12] the pale horse rider
[2:47:15] the world is following him
[2:47:17] okay and he's corrupted the food
[2:47:20] industry
[2:47:23] so now you grab a soda pop
[2:47:26] that's the worst thing you could put in
[2:47:28] your body is
[2:47:31] because what I drank was real sugar
[2:47:34] but you're drinking is a synthetic drug
[2:47:38] is
