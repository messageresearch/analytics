[52:38] to the family to the church
[52:42] uh
[52:43] a great man was promoted to a greater
[52:47] life
[52:48] amount of vision
[52:50] a teacher
[52:52] a pastor an apostle
[52:55] a person that
[52:58] his legacy will live on through
[53:00] Caleb through time
[53:03] for the servants that he taught
[53:07] how to be simple
[53:09] but how to be the best you could be
[53:13] I met brother Tom in the mid 70s
[53:18] traveled with the team
[53:20] in the late 70s
[53:23] and became a gopher I'd go for the
[53:26] coffee I'd go for their soda pop I'd go
[53:29] for many things for them at one time
[53:32] brother Tommy just giving a small
[53:34] testimony a one-time brother Tommy
[53:37] stopped me in said brought him a boy
[53:41] this is your training this is where
[53:43] you're going to start to train
[53:45] serving
[53:47] the greatest thing that man can do
[53:50] to be humble is to serve others and this
[53:53] is what he taught me he says Great Men
[53:55] start at the bottom they work themselves
[53:58] up to the top and they have to be the
[54:00] best they can be if you're if they think
[54:03] that they're hot you need to be hotter
[54:05] if you preach a message a message has to
[54:08] be a message to save a message to him
[54:12] and a message to teach
[54:15] what needs to be taught within a
[54:17] congregation brother Tommy was uh
[54:21] a great lawyer someone that could tell
[54:24] me what I needed to know
[54:27] and we're going to miss him a lot but we
[54:30] have a memory that is embedded
[54:33] that is embedded in our hearts
[54:36] uh our thoughts
[54:39] and with this
[54:41] I believe with all my heart that right
[54:44] now he and brother Bernie and brother
[54:46] Paul brother Pepe brother burunda those
[54:51] individuals that have paved the way for
[54:54] us are looking at us making sure that we
[54:57] are continuing uh this Apostolic message
[55:02] throughout the world and that's what I
[55:05] loved about brother Tommy he'd go into
[55:08] Mexico they knew him as Omas he'd go
[55:11] into other countries in the United
[55:13] States
[55:15] foreign countries internationally
[55:18] and then you'll miss Tommy
[55:20] brother Thomas
[55:21] he never made himself something to be
[55:23] big
[55:24] but never called himself anything above
[55:27] brother but we all know that he paved
[55:30] the way for the future of uh Latinos
[55:36] that spoke only English and that's why
[55:38] I'm proud to know that I had contact
[55:42] with with a man that was inspired a man
[55:45] that was anointed a man that showed me
[55:47] how to do what I'm doing today and
[55:51] that's live for others and at the same
[55:54] time understanding that our time is
[55:57] limited here on this Earth and what we
[56:00] should be doing is training those that
[56:03] will follow us those that will continue
[56:06] when brother Branham started those that
[56:09] would continue with brother burning
[56:11] started those that will continue what
[56:13] brother Tommy has started so I thank God
[56:16] for those great memories I go back
[56:19] through Memory Lane I can sit down and I
[56:22] can say praise God for individuals like
[56:25] brother Tomas Perez not only does he fit
[56:29] the bill of the faithful Ministry but it
[56:33] was all in him all the five offices in a
[56:37] man just like brother Bernie just like
[56:39] brother Brennan I'm not putting them at
[56:41] their level of brother Brown I'm putting
[56:43] them at a level that God called them to
[56:46] be the best they could be I want to
[56:49] thank you for this opportunity that you
[56:51] give me to greet you uh
[56:54] honoring this this great man of this
[56:57] Visionary so God bless you I'm praying
[57:00] for you I'm praying for the church and
[57:02] always remember
[57:04] uh if Tommy wanted to come back like

[1:04:54] good afternoon God bless you this is
[1:04:57] Brother Rod Rohde I first met brother
[1:04:59] Perez in 1978 in Sacramento California
[1:05:04] when I was just a 21 year old young man
[1:05:10] this was someone that I was immediately
[1:05:12] drawn to
[1:05:13] a matter of fact two years later I had
[1:05:16] the privilege of marrying the first
[1:05:17] youth that brother Pettis had in this
[1:05:21] message it's my wife's sister Carol
[1:05:24] I want to say that when I heard
[1:05:27] him voice the word of God I knew this
[1:05:30] was
[1:05:31] truly a special servant that God had his
[1:05:35] ministry was out of an apostle
[1:05:37] I saw that clearly early on his example
[1:05:40] as a Christian his attitude as a Son of
[1:05:42] God
[1:05:43] to just to to teach us how to stand I'm
[1:05:48] so grateful for the example that he put
[1:05:50] before us and so so so grateful to have
[1:05:54] been able to have our paths across
[1:05:59] which I do believe those things I don't
[1:06:01] believe in coincidence I believe that
[1:06:03] God ordains these these things that take
[1:06:06] place in our walks in our lives I'm just
[1:06:08] going to read one verse here of
[1:06:10] scripture First Corinthians chapter nine
[1:06:12] says are ye are not ye my work in the
[1:06:15] Lord this is the Apostle Paul speaking
[1:06:16] he says if I be not an apostle unto
[1:06:18] others yet doubtless I am to you
[1:06:21] for the Seal of mine apostleship are ye
[1:06:24] and the Lord I rest on that I
[1:06:29] always have but
[1:06:31] God bless you
[1:06:37] greetings from Brother Jody in Alaska
[1:06:40] it's good to be here today and talk
[1:06:42] about brother Tommy I met him back in
[1:06:44] the late 70s he was on his way to
[1:06:47] Oklahoma and Arkansas where he had sheep
[1:06:49] there he was a pastor of some people
[1:06:51] that weren't in Silver City where he was
[1:06:53] a professor he stopped by to talk to me
[1:06:56] because my cousin Charlie had given me a
[1:06:58] book called footsteps on the sense of
[1:06:59] time which didn't have a front cover or
[1:07:02] back cover and I had trouble
[1:07:03] understanding the book and I told
[1:07:05] Charlie I need to talk to Tommy or
[1:07:07] somebody about a prophet I I'm having
[1:07:10] some issues there well Tommy stopped by
[1:07:12] and he talked to me and he gave me
[1:07:13] scripture after scripture how God still
[1:07:16] used prophets well that was awesome but
[1:07:19] I said I need more of this he says why
[1:07:21] don't you come down to Silver City and
[1:07:23] we'll talk and I go yes sir so I went
[1:07:25] and I visited when I got there to Silver
[1:07:27] City I went into a place called sword
[1:07:30] Tabernacle where he was a pastor and as
[1:07:32] I entered the front door I saw a picture
[1:07:35] of him and Viola and he was standing
[1:07:38] right underneath the picture but there
[1:07:39] was also another picture to the right of

[1:07:47] my dreams he goes you had dreams about
[1:07:49] this man I go yeah he's a hillbilly well
[1:07:52] to make a long story short I ended up
[1:07:54] moving to Silver City when I got there
[1:07:57] everything was on shut down this the
[1:08:00] mine was on strike so anyways we're
[1:08:02] having a rough time during that time he
[1:08:05] stopped by for me one day and he said go
[1:08:07] with me to Demi which is about 50 miles
[1:08:10] 40 miles right in there to Deming we
[1:08:13] went we went to Deming and we we many of
[1:08:16] you know the story of the Whirlwind with
[1:08:18] the money in it we'll sit down and talk
[1:08:19] about that later I want to talk about a
[1:08:21] miracle the first miracle I ever saw was
[1:08:24] in Guadalajara Mexico at Pepe Hernandez
[1:08:27] church we were praying for the sick
[1:08:29] after brother Bernie finished preaching
[1:08:31] his message and as we went down to pray
[1:08:33] there was an elderly woman who had her
[1:08:35] hands raised she had her hands raised up
[1:08:37] high and she had her eyes closed when
[1:08:39] Tommy focused on her and he went down
[1:08:41] there he says come on God's fixing the
[1:08:43] move we went and he with one finger he
[1:08:45] being opened her eye one eye open the
[1:08:47] other one was shut when he opened it the
[1:08:49] socket was dry
[1:08:51] when he prayed for her he said what do
[1:08:54] you want she said he said
[1:08:58] Christo and when he opened her eye again
[1:09:00] I saw a
[1:09:02] eyeball I swear on my mom's grave that's
[1:09:07] the first miracle I saw little pockets
[1:09:09] of light begin to drop and people were
[1:09:11] coming out of wheelchairs people were
[1:09:13] praising God uh running around it was
[1:09:16] just unbelievable let me say this about
[1:09:19] brother Tommy he's one of the greatest
[1:09:21] men I ever I don't think anybody could
[1:09:23] have a perfect family like that look at
[1:09:25] their lives right now they're men of God
[1:09:27] they're the daughters married Godly men
[1:09:31] I'm going to tell you we need to sit
[1:09:32] down and talk and I can tell you many
[1:09:35] many stories of things that I witnessed
[1:09:37] myself and saw God bless you from Alaska
[1:09:44] God bless you I want to thank you for
[1:09:47] this honor given to me to remember
[1:09:49] brother Tommy
[1:09:51] the burunda family first crossed paths
[1:09:53] was really taught me way back in 1941
[1:09:55] that was with my dad
[1:09:59] was an Apostolic Pastor a pastoring
[1:10:02] there in the Bayard area 1941 he
[1:10:05] dedicated brother Tommy
[1:10:08] we then saw him in the early 70s at the
[1:10:10] Fillmore Church Phoenix Tabernacle in
[1:10:12] Phoenix on Fillmore we're all very
[1:10:15] familiar with the Supernatural Ministry
[1:10:17] the discernment and the revelation of
[1:10:19] the word praying for the sick and so
[1:10:20] forth that by the time we received from
[1:10:23] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:25] I saw brother Tommy minister in Mexico
[1:10:29] Arizona
[1:10:32] New Mexico and we developed the family
[1:10:36] all the blessings of of being able to
[1:10:38] know brother Tommy and to be over that
[1:10:41] and tell you to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:42] first
[1:10:44] then uh of course you are dead he moved
[1:10:48] us dad moved us from California to
[1:10:50] Phoenix in 1948 when brother Banner
[1:10:52] ministered to him yeah that had cancer
[1:10:55] of the throat
[1:10:56] 17 years later in 1965 dad moved us to
[1:11:00] Arizona
[1:11:01] and then in 1970 brother Bernie came
[1:11:04] from it was then that I first met
[1:11:06] brother Tommy I was blessed to speak
[1:11:08] with him a lot
[1:11:10] in 1977 through 1978
[1:11:13] when he lived here here in Phoenix for
[1:11:16] around eight months I was blessed I
[1:11:18] visited brother Tommy several times in
[1:11:20] his home in Silver City what a
[1:11:23] tremendous sense of humor he had several
[1:11:26] times I was really honored to preach to
[1:11:28] this church there in Silver City
[1:11:30] the last time I met with Brother Tommy
[1:11:32] was in August of last year when I went
[1:11:36] to uh Las Cruces to visit brother
[1:11:39] Abraham
[1:11:40] I want to thank you for allowing me to
[1:11:41] publicly remember brother Tommy
[1:11:44] the great warrior of Faith a man of
[1:11:46] power Faith love
[1:11:49] Shalom God bless you
[1:11:55] Lord bless you this morning I greet you
[1:11:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:00] one to make a couple comments for the
[1:12:03] family may the Lord give you peace and
[1:12:05] rest and a time not a Mourning but of
[1:12:11] joyful and that our loved ones can be in
[1:12:14] the presence of the Lord I think of a
[1:12:17] poem that my father always used to like
[1:12:20] to quote
[1:12:21] it said the hand of time is wound but
[1:12:24] once and no man had the power to know
[1:12:26] just when the clock will stop at later
[1:12:29] early hour
[1:12:30] to lose one's health is sad indeed to
[1:12:34] lose one's soul is more
[1:12:37] to lose a soul is such a loss that no
[1:12:39] man
[1:12:40] can restore
[1:12:42] only one life will soon be passed and
[1:12:45] only What's Done For Christ will last
[1:12:47] and we think of the passing of our loved
[1:12:50] ones and many times there's no way to
[1:12:53] explain it or anything to say but
[1:12:56] we'll see you tomorrow I think of our
[1:12:58] our brother Thomas and and the time that
[1:13:02] we had in fellowship and around the
[1:13:05] country and on missionary trips
[1:13:07] and I know that when we're doing the
[1:13:10] mission work we're we're in the will of
[1:13:12] God and so how many times do we find
[1:13:15] that the lives that he impacted and
[1:13:18] looking to these Elders that we had
[1:13:22] we know that they give us courage and it
[1:13:25] also give us Footprints to follow
[1:13:28] and I think then of another quote that
[1:13:31] the prophet of God quoted the lives of
[1:13:33] Great Men all remind us we can make our
[1:13:36] lives Sublime and departingly behind his
[1:13:39] footprints in the sands of time
[1:13:42] footprints that perhaps another selling
[1:13:45] or life solemn's Maine a foreign brother
[1:13:50] scene she'll take heart again let us
[1:13:54] then
[1:13:55] be up and doing and with a heart
[1:13:58] for any fate still achieving still
[1:14:00] pursuing learn to labor
[1:14:04] and to wait
[1:14:06] knowing that the prophet of God said
[1:14:07] that
[1:14:08] when we've had
[1:14:10] a part in a saving of a soul and and
[1:14:13] when we've and when we've been part of
[1:14:16] that that our name would be attached to
[1:14:19] that when there's no more Moon and no
[1:14:21] more star and we spend out into eternity
[1:14:25] that our name will be attached to those
[1:14:28] things and it brings me a great comfort
[1:14:32] to know that our brother name will be
[1:14:36] attached to many many lives and many
[1:14:39] souls and and we won't say goodbye but
[1:14:42] we'll say God bless you and we'll see
[1:14:45] you
[1:14:46] down the road Lord bless you family Lord
[1:14:49] bless you brother Caleb brother Tommy
[1:14:51] your wives and your families and mom and
[1:14:55] all of those that are part of the Great
[1:14:57] economy of God we love you and we give
[1:15:01] you our our greatest thing we could say
[1:15:04] is God bless you may his peace be with

[1:31:25] I was ugly bad he had a fairy in Milo
[1:31:30] and uh Tommy was bad
[1:31:35] but not bad the way you might think
[1:31:39] and then you might say how come your
[1:31:42] brother Daniel was good than Tommy come
[1:31:45] on
[1:31:49] better than able
[1:31:52] wasn't he so better than Jacob
[1:31:58] but I'm not talking about that kind of a
[1:32:01] you know yeah
[1:32:06] I was an Apostolic Ministry
[1:32:13] that man was so good he was good for
[1:32:16] nothing
[1:32:19] and hell is going to be full of good
[1:32:21] people you know God doesn't want good
[1:32:24] people
[1:32:26] he wants to consecrated holy people
[1:32:30] um
[1:32:31] that's what God wants
[1:32:34] that was what my brother was
[1:32:37] he was consecrated
[1:32:40] you know In the Flesh
[1:32:44] I'm gonna miss him a lot
[1:32:48] he had a purpose in life
[1:32:51] you know why he had a purpose in life
[1:32:54] because
[1:32:56] my mother Maria Perez
[1:33:28] and you know what he was because all
[1:33:31] these ministers have already testified
[1:33:36] we shared many things we and him
[1:33:41] me and my brother Danny
[1:33:44] then he was uh older than me
[1:33:49] was younger than me
[1:33:53] but we pulled rank on him
[1:33:57] oh he us
[1:34:00] brother he was his life paralleled the
[1:34:03] life of William Branham
[1:34:07] we were so poor
[1:34:10] we didn't even have indoor plumbing
[1:34:14] we didn't have no no not even a phone we
[1:34:19] didn't have television
[1:34:21] television of course we were born during
[1:34:25] the times of the cavemen
[1:34:30] way back
[1:34:32] so what did we know about about cell
[1:34:36] phones or color TV or nothing
[1:34:43] the children now
[1:34:46] they don't know how what it is to be
[1:34:48] outside no so many cases
[1:35:01] what would we play with
[1:35:04] we play Kick the Can
[1:35:42] Mijo
[1:36:03] anyways
[1:36:06] we will climb houses
[1:36:32] would take nothing from no one nothing
[1:36:36] I would always beat him up
[1:36:40] but he would get the last punch
[1:36:44] one time he kicked me outside of the
[1:36:47] house
[1:36:49] and I ran after him
[1:36:52] he went inside the house and hid behind
[1:36:55] the door everybody
[1:37:00] yes
[1:37:13] we he got married
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:16] and he came with a razor blade
[1:37:20] he told my pants
[1:37:27] Oh the girls nowadays would like a pen
[1:37:30] with holes
[1:37:38] in those days you were ashamed to have a
[1:37:42] little tear on the pants
[1:37:46] thank God I wasn't born in this
[1:37:49] generation
[1:37:52] we were poor but we had a lot of lives
[1:37:57] we we held just for entertainment
[1:38:02] we had a big radio like that
[1:38:07] and in those days
[1:38:09] I'm talking about the 1940s
[1:38:14] so I go as far back as Methuselah
[1:38:21] so we hit a big radio
[1:38:28] the program came out
[1:38:31] that bought Goldman you might miss me
[1:38:34] you spoilers
[1:38:37] Silver Spurs
[1:38:40] anyways oh we everybody would huddle
[1:38:43] around that radio
[1:38:47] and you will put here over the radio
[1:38:51] waste
[1:38:56] you have to use a lot of imagination in
[1:39:00] those days
[1:39:02] no no since the devil is reigning
[1:39:07] they don't hide nothing
[1:39:10] even the woman naked on movies and you
