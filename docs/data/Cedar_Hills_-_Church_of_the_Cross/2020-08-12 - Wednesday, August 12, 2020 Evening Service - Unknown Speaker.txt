god amen amen how many how many enjoyed that message on sunday god's word is so rich amen amen we're going to get right into it this evening god bless those that are online god bless you [Music] that are watching online god bless you this evening and it says then jesus then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then ye are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen amen you may be seated okay so it says here that you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen now the question was asked by pilate what is truth amen amen jesus said everyone that is of that by knowing the truth alone and the first thing they do instead of getting out of the house they start grabbing things to take with them out of the house so you and you would ask or you would say will god let someone die in a burning house yes see if it's their choice yes we say oh god's going to save me oh you got to make a choice whether you're going to stay in the house on fire once the lord makes you free so if you turn over to john 5. juan capitulo we see here in this scripture that jesus jesus had healed a man what man is this which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk yes and he that was healed with not who it was findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou are made whole sin no more no lest the worst thing come upon thee he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you must continue in him now we heard on sunday that we are dealing with a defeated enemy fox yes if i could catch him i'd put him in a box lock that box and throw away the keys but we find out in judges 16 4. i'm going to give you some scriptures i don't have time to give you the foundations of these scriptures so and the lords of the philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see where in his great strength and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us 1100 pieces of silver platter and delilah said to sampson tell me i pray yo where is my great strength goliath consisted and wherewith thou mighty mightiest be bound to afflict thee and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green wits and she said unto him how can this thou say i love thee when thine heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and hath not told me we're in thy great strength to and she urged him importantly so that his soul was vexed unto death we are dealing with a defeated enemy he's whatever the virus says there's a spiritual they're making us wear masks [Applause] crystal take up your bed and go i think it's time to get back to church and then all of a sudden everybody is willing to die until it's time to die we're if it's the holy ghost i'll go yes santo boy do you think you're here is the truth is of the trust and i saw them bringing her in it did not look comfortable it didn't look like she that she was in pain you're too sick that you're this big tough christian yes now i'm sure coronavirus is bad one day i got food poisoning that was of your soul the man that is appointed to watch over the sheep of the fold i think it's time we get back to church let's go over to exodus 3 7. exodus 3 7. and the lord said i have surely seen the afflictions of my people foreign and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians so god has heard our cries yes now i had a hard time with this message because the lord gave it to me and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return into egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have put yeah in thine hands he said to moses i have heard the cry of my people i am sending a deliverer go to pharaoh and tell him go i almost fell out of the car there would have been no need for pestilence there would have been no need for all these other things that's all i want to take so we think oh god's going to come deliver us no sorry no no sir no senor he said i have hardened thy heart of pharaoh these were pharaoh's slaves for the people because we were so tied up we're so tied up in technology technology we're so tied up in egypt in the world that he said it was easier for the world or this virus separate yourselves go into your secret chamber but it was easier for god to left pharaoh you have pharaoh let the people gotta follow oh how in the world am i going to make a living i better start working from my house i gotta start doing that no no and we claim to trust god [Music] and they don't want that no kidding they didn't want him then no location then we're falling apart [Applause] and it could stop here oh i could stop here for hours on men and women christians even that's that's what brother branham says you look at each other branham go into your secret chambers he didn't say take a second job he didn't say go do this go to here uh in the answer to their prayers but they didn't want him i wonder today if our prayers you hear them say pray for a great revival but when god sends it in the way that he wants to but then it's not according to our tastes and therefore we won't receive it no and that's the way it was in that day if he was not in the taste of their beliefs they would not receive him again today that's the reason i asked the question who is this right so we pray and we pray to god now right and we hear the scripture i mean we we we phrase the scripture all the time i have never seen the righteous forsaken um or god's seed begging bread hold on right and we always think that begging for bread i always think yo my mind goes to i'm never going to be begging for money then jesus went dance and departed into the coast of tyree and syria said on quinceanera how fair is that here here's jesus jesus sent to the lost sheep of the house of israel israel and he's about to tell somebody in their own town in supropio uh sweden that it's not right that he gives her any bread right well then why didn't you stay in the children's city right isn't he went where the gentiles were right and here's a woman have mercy on me oh lord so the bible says that she was crying out to him yesterday have mercy on me thou son of david have mercy on me she was like she was begging him she was begging for him have mercy on me let me see recording but we do that many times so much but we don't know the difference i'm begging lord mr dicor mikasa right you're done have mercy on me let me see so we beg any answer not a word [Applause] that's why jesus told peter jesus when you're converted strengthen your brothers i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel right but she continued begging that it is not right is oh i i could really go into the seventh angel right here well yeah now over here in john sixth okay so we just read that he had gone up now we we just read that he had just he went over to the sea of galilee right okay so we're going to take up the same that he had jesus went over to the sea of galilee which is of the sea of tiber's and there was a great multitude yeah via grand multitude now in verse 6 again it says here so right after that incident with the woman that was begging for breath and he said it's not meat that i give you bread um and he didn't give her bread but he gave her bread and then he felt bad for the people and he said let's feed the people get every man to sit down phillip said where were we gonna buy bread and then we find out that jesus jesus multiplied the bread multiplication and then we find out that the children we find out that jesus goes over to the other side of the mountain and then we find out that in the morning when did you get here augustus the common answer would have been oh i got here last night or i got here early this morning right but no jesus didn't say that jesus can you imagine this conversation hey william hey william brother romano when did you get here well new augustus okay okay fairly very i say unto you imagine that conversation is a that's rude right you didn't come here because you were looking for me but labor not for the meat which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed that day unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god [Music] jesus tells them he told the woman the same thing it's not me for me to give this to dogs right and she said okay lord but i'll take the crown shall jesus answered them what's greater than oh man greater than raising the dead yes jesus did that brother branham did that and i'm not a brethren that's already been done yesterday oh but the greater word is my honest jesus said these are the works of god believe on him if you can get them to believe all right the conversation went back to bread then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven unto the world then said they unto him lord evermore give us this breath then jesus said jesus unto them i am the bread of life to me version i don't know if they got it or not but let me read it jesus said to them i am the bread of life come to me daily we read over here that's the enemy they pressed samson they pressed them daily the problem that's the key it was like like that's the secret es el secreto he says you gotta come to me if my word abides in you and you abide in me you the christ oh let me tell you one thing david's man david david was standing there and he said do you remember that water this hour how many of
