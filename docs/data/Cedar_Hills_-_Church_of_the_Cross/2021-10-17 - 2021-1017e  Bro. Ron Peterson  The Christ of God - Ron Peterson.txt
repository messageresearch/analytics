father to say something that will be a blessing to your people that we might know you better that we might be drawn closer to you that we might love you more how can we serve a god that we don't know therefore come and reveal yourself to us it's uh been a real blessing to be here with you i bring you greetings from our church in phoenix arizona in phoenix arizona um and i want to thank brother christophe and also brother caleb god i want to thank he and his family for their christian hospitality hospital and to all of you your warm welcome to you yeah [Music] pbs i want to be like timothy was to paul just put them in remembrance of what's already been said aren't you thankful to god that you have recognized your day and it's messy amen that your eyes have come open to understand amen amen let's turn in our bibles to the book of revelation chapter 19 apocalypse revelations 19 verses 9 through 10. and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not. for i am thy fellow servant of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophet testimony if god were to do something in this hour if god were to fulfill prophecy the evidence that you have the spirit of god yes you would have the testimony of the spirit of prophecy you would catch what's being said so the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peter's brother uh he first findeth his own brother simon and he says unto him we have found the messiah which is being interpreted cry turn with me now to luke chapter 9. verses 18 through 21. there's and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying whom say the people that i am notice as he questions and others say that one of the prophets is risen again do you see all the interpretations and he said unto them but whom say ye that i am. and peter answering said the christ any man that has an education can read the bible it is hidden from the wise and prudent that we might know how to live a life that is pleasing to you or without faith it is impossible to please god the christ of god and i want to take a subject is we have found the cry now understand that the jews had the old testament teachings they had the bible in their day they had the teachings of moses and of the other prophets and we see that there was all kinds of interpretations of what god was going to do and how he was going to fulfill his word but we see that god is his own interpreter now understand that the bible says that in second timothy 3 16. all scripture is given by the inspiration just imagine the prophet isaiah how the anointing came came upon him behold the virgin shall conceive if he would have stopped and thought in his carnal mind he wouldn't have spoken see god's ways are above our way his thoughts and as they were moved by the holy spirit but when they were anointed amen even the apostle paul said now what i say this is me this is not the lord they ask brother branham things and you know in questions and answers uh he says now now look i'm going to answer this question but he says i don't have a word of the lord for this. he says now this is just me well i would rather take a prophet's opinion than my opinion now in second samuel 23 verse 2. the bible says the spirit of the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue the spirit of that anointing gave and if he ever helps the people it wasn't him so many times people come up and say oh brother ron that was so wonderful you answered all my questions but as the anointing comes upon the menace sometimes he's answering a question of somebody in the back that has been praying somebody's been asking god for an answer and many times as we minister the word it's not me it's not brother caleb it's [Music] and the more that you have confidence in that gift the more you operate the gift you see if you pull he will preach he said if there's no pulling there's no preaching he says now listen to this exclusion it's my voice it's me boss and i'm listening to myself talk just as you're listening to me and he says when i'm under that anointing i asked brother billy paul because he told billy he said billy god's called you to work with me and you will know when i've been under the anointing too long he said so i asked him billy tell me what was it like what were the signs that you look for for your daddy if you leave me under the anointing too long i can't preach tomorrow night so he says he would come behind his daddy take his right hand and put it right here and if brother branham wanted to continue on brother branham would touch yeah you see him back and he's holding him up he reaches around and grabs the prophet's bible he lets the host minister know hello now listen to this this is a part that you never have heard before he says i would take daddy to the car and place him in the car he said many times he's so tired he would just lay down in the in the back seat i said [Applause] he kept [Applause] and he he would start crying he says oh billy i'm so tired take me home i don't want to preach no more and he says here billy he says i'm driving i want to go home and he says after about 20 30 minutes he would look in the rearview mirror and he would see brother branham sit up in the backseat [Music] he says i don't even remember what i said he says how many services do we have left he said we have three more services he says take me to the motel billy [Applause] you see when it comes upon a minister he speaks as the mouthpiece of god in the sermon the roman nobleman brother brenham says this is it was jesus christ using my voice and he says it depends on your approach to it amen it depends upon your approach to it and that's how it is even when you have a gift of god that's among you [Music] any ask abundantly have you ever gone to one of those help yourself buffets have you ever seen somebody go up there and they have one little plate and they just take a little bit and you know they get just a small serving and they bypass all of the they go for the meat they go for the good stuff and you know what it depends on how hungry you are if you're asking god god fill my cup i want you to i want you to feed me tonight i just don't want a small blessing i don't want just a little tiny blessing but i lose it before i get out of it but give me something that all next week i am still feeding on the world amen amen he says no he says in the sermon faith he says watch i am just yielding myself to the holy spirit and as i get myself completely yielded to the holy spirit [Music] l when brother branham would have the discernment and the prayer lines they always had the people come from the right because the angel stood to brother branham's right and as they approached the gear conformity now a prophet doesn't stay in just this present time period he can go back into time he says i see you as a young woman and he now begins to discern her and then he he comes out of this vision and he says are those things true that's the moment your husband is here too and he has something wrong with him and he the prophet said your prophet i to look over the that's why he said i can't stay under that anointing the bible says that whatsoever you yield yourself to you become the servant thereof either to righteousness or to unrighteousness it's a law of god do you not deceive god is not marked or whatsoever spirit you yield yourself to you become the servant thereof it depends on who you're yielding to todd why can you come how can you come to god and ask him to bless you and you're not you're not seeking him ask and it shall be given [Applause] you want more of god give more of you to him when when you pray do you know what it does to your spirit softens your spirit they called the prophet elijah hey come and give us the word of the lord and he says uh he says if it wasn't for this man i wouldn't even be speaking to him he said bring me a minstrel the right kind of music brings the right kind of spirit music hey man amen you and then listen it's pushing the wrong kind of music brings the wrong kind of spirit brother what kind of music your children listen to you he said without the holy spirit when they listen to rock and roll it catches their spirits i was driving in phoenix one day and i had one of the young brothers from my church in the car in front of me i could hear the music he's got [Music] and he [Laughter] i said yeah i was born at night but not last night it's whatever you yield yourself to it listen i can see all of you have a halo while you're here on your cell phone the word of the lord is used 234 times in your bible and i began to look this up the first time that it's used is in genesis 15. and it says in the word of the lord came to abram in a vision you see god making himself known to abraham and even the the next time i see it is in first samuel chapter 3 the child samuel ministers before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days and he eli went and laid down and now samuel goes and lays down and he hears the name samuel he hears a boy somebody's calling he runs the eli yes did you call me no no i i didn't go no you're not yummy because it lays back down but and the bible says in verse 6 and the lord called yet again and said here am i or thou didst neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him we see so much of the time that the word of the lord comes to once in the scriptures is and you see in the word of the lord comes to jeremiah and i told you that the correct word in hebrew it says the word of the lord became jeremiah do you know that god speaks in first person singularly i am going to speak to you i have heard thy prayer do you see what i'm saying it wasn't it wasn't isaiah it wasn't jeremiah sometimes people think that he that spoke it has got to do what the prophecy said god is his own interpreter i want to show you something go to saint john chapter four yeah san juan capitulo just have a little bible study tonight how many of you love to read your bible now let me say something about reading your bible do not read your bible like you read a book you must anoint the word first before you read your bible anoint the word father speak to my heart does christ come among us oh don't let church become common to you and the closer she got to him the more her heart just began to melt before god and she reached up she took a pin out of her hair and her long hair she got close to him and she had an alabaster box full of anointing she had sold her body i heard that he spoke to other women a one a woman who was caught in the act of adultery i've heard these stories he's never spoke to me m he let her come to him brother branham said if he would have moved his foot she would have run [Music] now the word has been silent her whole life is [Music] and now the word speaks to her woman your sins which are many are forgiven [Applause] that's the god i know how dare we look down at those people in the world as you know we're yeah they got their hair spiked and they got i would be worse than them there was a there was a brother that invited a young man off of the street to come to church the church was full like and this man he had long hair he wasn't nice and as he came into the church he's looking for a place where he does it and the deacon is following there's nowhere to sit the whole church is watching the deacon he said thank you for coming to church we should never become self-righteous you can't judge your book by its covenant amen the bible says go on to the highways and the byways compel them the whole the lame the blind and there was young men there that they'd been message believers for probably four or five years and i looked at these young men and different things like this and i and get them to love the lord and so i just began to talk about the washington the water of the world and i said if you look like the world and you act like the world the love of god is not even and all of a sudden while i'm preaching [Music] not some compromising gospel you're afraid to offend somebody preach from truth amen i i had a an old pentecostal sister she was the mother of of her pastor [Music] and um you know she come out of pentecost she had a big hairdo yeah she had all the rings on her fingers and she met me after service and she says they say ronnie baby i want to talk to you ronnie baby i thought oh man i am in trouble [Music] he says you preach the truth of god's word and then i must have the decision on whether or not i want to serve god she says but you preach to me truth amen how many of you want your pastor preached to me hallelujah [Applause] and there was a a woman sitting like on the second row where you small little group of people he has big earrings he's not dressed very modest and i thought do i hit against all of that do i speak again and what i did that i just bit god saw the elect seed inside of her oh [Applause] that you give your life to him and the lady came to me after yesterday he says i was invited to this service i've never heard this before yo nunca is [Music] do you take it as an offense or do you say oh god forgive me i don't want to be like the pharisee who looks down at that publican i'm glad i'm not like this republican sitting there would not even raise up his eyes and he said oh oh god have a place we realize that god that great logos he said that pillar of fire that followed the children of israel through the wilderness that was christ that was the anointing and brother branham i just heard it the other day he said watch the gentile dispensation with the pillar of fire that is israel was not following moses is god he said christ was that anointing that logos that went out of god he says the angel any bible reader knows that that angel was christ colossians 1 verses 25 through 29 in colossians wherefore i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from the ages and from generations to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory is christ when we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus jesus wherefore or where unto i also labor striving according to this working which worketh in me mightily galatians 2 and 20. how can you but christ delivereth in me [Applause] he wasn't [Music] [Music] he [Music] in the old testament do you know that the high priest never looked at the man he only looked at the lamb god's not looking at you he's looking at your lamb hallelujah hallelujah none of us are going to go to heaven because of our words none of us earned our way to heaven it wasn't anything you did when we get over there you do not keep god how many times have you made a mistake how many times did you do wrong and yet god still loves you when we look at moses and david and joseph when their lives are living out and expressing jesus christ he says why would you condemn me when i say i am the son of god when you call those who the word of the lord comes to god abraham was considered a god elijah was a god isaiah was a god because the word of god came to him when the man was anointed like joseph when david was anointed it was not david [Music] if everybody out in the world is looking more like their their god and we look at them they're getting so crazy but if they're getting more like the image of their god [Music] [Applause] let me ask you a question when brother branham looked beyond the curtain of time and he saw do you remember the vision he saw of the bride he says all my heart was so so swelling up within me he said here comes the modern-day church division all these years of preaching he says watch here comes the bride again i wonder how many within the message you're getting out of step and the prophet said get back it's your walk with god i want to ask you is your dress getting more holi or more like the world is the dress getting shorter you see holiness is not something you put on [Applause] modest because once you catch the revelation once you know it's wrong to cut your hair how many times do you have to be reminded no once they catch it i got it sometimes that's how the church does hey honey i got it all the years and yet there is still a small group hallelujah for the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who when he has heard the word applies the word but a foolish man is likened to one who hears the word and doesn't do it god help us to hear what god wants us to hear in this stage christ means the anointed one he says when a man is anointed by the spirit of christ his flesh being anointed with the spirit of god produces the word of god made manifesto brother branham said he says we don't judge one another but he says we can be fruit inspector you tell me you're an orange tree until i see orange fruit i don't believe it it is have we so reduced this message down to to laws and to regulations the listen i've been in the countries where the women wear a long dress you see it's it's not what you put on it's what you have on the inside hey man amen i've kind of bounced around here a little bit man brother branham said that we are messiahs when do you become a messiah i'm just talking to you right now yes brother but when you sit on the white throne with god and you have supreme knowledge and you were just like him he said and there comes up somebody before the white throne did you lie did you steal [Music] and under that great light you cannot lie and the voice was yes but there will be somebody on the throne my lord may i speak senor hallelujah they did something for my family do you mean to tell me that in a time when you are in need for even a cup of water the god could give someone eternal life because they gave you a cup of water [Music] has anyone ever been good to your family and sometimes you want to pay him back and say hey and they say no no no wait we just did it i ask you how many of you can say the word of the lord has come to you you've heard the message of the ow you didn't go looking for it [Applause] [Applause] the bible says he that's forgiven much [Music] love i'm a muslim that's why i love him the way i do it because god forgave me [Music] showing us that listen every one of us are human beings we make our mistakes we do things wrong but we need god every day pero canada so when the christ of god comes to you what does that mean that makes you an anointing not because of your work i so appreciate all of you yo certainly i'm sorry i went from here [Applause] you have a wonderful group of people here i feel the most i feel a kindred spirit yes if we sat down long enough we might find something that we don't agree on [Applause] again [Applause] up there together [Applause] [Music] you love the word of god thank you for the word i'm amazed that you love me i'm amazed that you love me [Applause] [Music] [Music] washed [Music] that you love [Music] and through your precious [Music] [Music] is [Music] lord you know so many times i've gone astray but i have heard your love is stronger than my weakness and your ear is [Music] could never be as cold to me i'm not afraid and you wake your hands to my are heart i'll ever [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is oh [Music] [Music] [Music] how you care [Music] yes my sins away [Music] hey [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] before oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i am happy [Music]

did you see him now [Applause] [Music] [Music] go down to the river [Applause] everybody [Music] the water [Applause] amen i'm glad i'm a christian and i'm glad i came to church what a what a word we have heard which is nothing but the truth i'm going to say it again it's nothing but the truth [Applause] what a word you know we sometimes we hear a lot of preaching and a lot of jumping and shouting and that's okay it's got its place but oh when a servant of the lord just tells us what's in his heart just listening and listening to brother brother brother ron you weren't here and there everywhere the only way you were here and everywhere was in every heart that you were it was the word of god was coming you were hitting here you were hitting there [Applause] oh my my aunt you know i'm telling you the the first time i met brother ron and and as he said i i fell in love with him i said well i i always told my wife what a fine spirit he has but brother ron he is a a very special man if you ever get a chance go on youtube and there there is brother ron's testimony i style testimonial on youtube i tell you young people even in all of you but you young people go listen to it and uh where the lord brought him from and sister sandy his wife you know when i when i see that i i thank the lord that before his coming yep that he would let me meet another part of the body of christ ron he has been around and and uh he has traveled to 97 countries and boy the testimonies he was telling us and how we we were wow and i say i appreciate men that have gone out and have preached the gospel and i want to say that i am honored to to uh to know and have been able to know now and his wife and to be identified with them god bless you brother ron your little run and that he would take his time from his church and from all the work that he does and come visit us i don't take that lightly means a lot to us and and so we we ask that you greet the rest of the congregation for us significa amen we we also want to before we leave thank you so much for for coming and amen for coming and gracing us with your presence before we leave we do want to say uh we want to keep brother brother lalo uh sanchez and sister yolanda yolanda sanchez your mama passed away yesterday that god would comfort them the family during this time amen at the same token we want to congratulate brother david and sister lyanna and the baby boy that was born i believe on friday thursday and his name is brother david elisha so we want to also welcome him amen and uh last but not least uh i will be gone this weekend or this this week yes amen you know and and that's the thing that i really love you know sometimes we we get a lot of a lot of doctrines in the way and this and that every church has to have their doctrines but when that becomes a separating point if we become so dogmatic about something that it divides us with our brothers there's another spirit there i out respiratory you know it's like some sometimes we're here or wherever the lord lord has had us and it's like let me explain this i think many times people don't get this i think because you start fellowshipping or having fellowship with a certain brother or a certain church you have to turn your back on everybody you ever knew i wonder sometimes what message they read but then we get a little bit bitter towards the ones we used to know i hear the wrong no brother run out as i was saying to brother ron earlier sometimes we jump to the unity of the faith without first of all coming into the unity of the spirit we can come into that first century the rest it comes so when you see another part of the body and you meet another part of the body wow it makes you fall in love more and more with the lord that's why he's saying god would rather us love one another because he knows we love each other we love him one more time brother ron thank you again a blessing to us and that's the key brother and sister never ever let a root of bitterness ever come into your heart it'll choke the holy spirit out that's how it's been a wonderful sunday a wonderful day it's a time of refreshing that the lord gave us and i'm grateful to him almighty god oh lord how you know how to lord how you touch our hearts lord and the gratitude that we have lord is gratitude we seem to always fall short in our words lord but if we can say thank you from the depths of our hearts for thinking of us we're making us sons and daughters for lord i pray for brother ron that you continue to bless him and his wife peter ponos [Music] so that this word can go to so many different countries to so many people lord bless him i pray lord share of him lord his health lord jesus lord there's years we raise them up in prayer and we say thank you lord for their lives thank you for using them lord gracias father to help us in our walks and we thank you lord our hearts rejoice hearing not the voice of a man but hearing your voice thank you once again in the precious name of jesus christ we ask it all and amen god bless you until we meet again it's been a [Music] the pleasure of jesus with you a child of sorrow and a foe oh it will joy and comfort give you take it everywhere you go oh precious [Music] oh precious [Music] shield from every snare and if temptations round together just breathe that holy name and pray precious [Music] precious [Music]
