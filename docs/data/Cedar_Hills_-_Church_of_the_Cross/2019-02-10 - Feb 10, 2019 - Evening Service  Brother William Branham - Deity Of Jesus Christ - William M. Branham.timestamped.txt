[24:51] second chapter let's read it then it
[24:53] came to pass and in those days that
[24:55] there went out a decree from Caesar
[24:57] Augustus wall the world that they should
[25:00] be taxed and this tax it was first made
[25:02] it by the governor of Serbia and all
[25:06] went to be taxed everyone to his own
[25:08] City and Joseph went also up from
[25:11] Galilee into the city of Nazareth the
[25:14] Judah the City of David which is called
[25:16] Bethlehem because he was of the house
[25:20] and lineage of David to be taxed with
[25:23] Mary mystic spouse wife being great with
[25:25] child and so it was that while they were
[25:29] there the date of her accomplishment
[25:31] that she should be delivered and she
[25:34] brought forth her firstborn son and
[25:37] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[25:40] laid him in the manger because there was
[25:42] no room for him in the end now just as a
[25:47] background
[25:48] till we get up to the part of it that I
[25:51] would use this morning now let me just
[25:53] let yourself be in the spirit of the
[25:56] Lord we heard today all over the world
[26:03] as being self celebrated the birth of
[26:06] Jesus which now it's just traditional
[26:09] Jesus was not born on or December the
[26:11] fist or nothing not our December the
[26:13] 25th we know that it's impossible the
[26:15] hills of Judea is full of snow at that
[26:17] time so how could it be that Jesus
[26:19] commonly by astronomers is so forth and
[26:21] by all of us born and first around 1st
[26:23] of April so when in springtime but this
[26:26] is a date which is all right just set
[26:28] aside to worship in Memorial of his
[26:33] coming to the world one of the greatest
[26:35] gifts that God ever give to the world
[26:37] was Jesus Christ that we know then and
[26:40] now I want to speak this morning upon
[26:43] his deity who he's so many hands with a
[26:47] little baby laying out there to cradling
[26:49] so forth
[26:49] but that fact was just one of the
[26:51] pictures just one of the set forth of
[26:53] the drama to bring it after what he
[26:55] really is his deity and he said in the
[26:59] scriptures of his coming he has been
[27:01] since the days of of John plumb back to
[27:05] even into Genesis it was prophesized
[27:08] that the woman's seed would bruise the
[27:10] serpent's head promise in this tribe a
[27:12] child Christ Jesus and he's been that
[27:17] all the prophets most ever probably that
[27:19] was ever wrote in the Bible spoke of his
[27:23] first and second has been when he has
[27:26] come to the world Jesus comes three
[27:27] times he came the first time to redeem
[27:31] his church he comes the second time to
[27:34] receive his church he comes the third
[27:37] time with his church everything in the
[27:40] Bible travels and Trinities trees but
[27:43] all in one crimes he can remember the
[27:46] first time to redeem his church the
[27:50] second time to receive his church the
[27:53] third time with his church as king and
[27:56] queen now but on his first coming will
[27:59] speak off just a little bit and then all
[28:01] his being here and then on his second
[28:04] coming his own it and then on the third
[28:06] time if the Lord willing now in these
[28:10] days there was the great persecution
[28:12] against the church cesar augusto has
[28:16] made a great plans that he attacks all
[28:19] the people and that was only done for
[28:21] one purpose that god's great prophecy
[28:24] would be fulfilled only thing you have
[28:27] to do when you see something in the
[28:29] Bible but it sounds just a little mystic
[28:30] you a little superstitious to you just
[28:34] give God a little bit of time God's nor
[28:37] hers we're the one gets in a hurry just
[28:39] give God just a little bit of time and
[28:41] you'll see the old prophetic wheels cogs
[28:44] run right into the picture Isabella just
[28:47] like a bringing up of a picture like
[28:49] some of us speak the other day said God
[28:51] what would be one of the back of
[28:53] millions and millions of years ago when
[28:56] he was told just like this space here
[28:58] and then he's gathered up into the logos
[29:01] and then he came from the logos down
[29:04] into Christ see it's just God coming
[29:08] down like this to the earth then going
[29:11] right back into God again don't you see
[29:13] what I mean
[29:14] just revolving coming down from space
[29:17] from eternity rolling together coming
[29:22] down into the low cost low cost down
[29:24] into man then returning right back again
[29:28] for one purpose to redeem that man that
[29:31] is fallen now that's what he came far to
[29:34] be our Redeemer and the for God could be
[29:37] a redeemer he had to be according to the
[29:40] law of Tennyson Redeemer he had to be
[29:43] kinfolks to us and God in the beginning
[29:46] made his first man he made him out of
[29:49] spirit and spirit is the invisible part
[29:52] of man that you don't see now if God
[29:55] made man in his own image
[29:57] are you listening all right God made man
[30:00] in his own image and God is a spirit
[30:03] that the Bible and the first man that
[30:05] was made had the government over all the
[30:08] creation just like the Holy Spirit has
[30:11] government over the church today he led
[30:14] the creation he led the animals but
[30:16] there was no man that feel with sorrow
[30:18] so god made man out of the dust of the
[30:20] earth and that man he might have give my
[30:24] hands like a monkey he might give him
[30:26] feet like a bear
[30:27] whatever he did he distorted together it
[30:29] made a man but this man he put this in
[30:32] Mortal spirit that never dived into this
[30:34] manatee become more than a fruit he
[30:36] became a man then this man here that's
[30:39] what I think of atheist and some of the
[30:41] standing around organ but the hours come
[30:43] when got for his life through the
[30:46] hour here they were not doing things
[30:47] that's right and so now when the Oregon
[30:51] while he meets the facts a bear his
[30:53] hands will look like a eight for a
[30:55] monkey or so forth they try to say his
[30:57] RG cup that that has nothing to do it
[30:59] this is the body of planet that he's
[31:01] just living in like a house it's going
[31:03] back to the dusty earth but the Spirit
[31:05] is in Marvel it comes from God that's
[31:08] the image of God God in the spirit that
[31:12] and lost is arching in the Garden of
[31:14] Eden his relationship communion with God
[31:16] was cut off there because of sin and
[31:19] unbelief unbelief is why the Word of God
[31:23] a picture was painted one time to even
[31:26] told her how much brighter would be if
[31:28] she just just discard the Word of God
[31:30] look over here to reason you can't go
[31:32] there's a difference between reason and
[31:34] God's Word God's Word is true reasons
[31:37] Falls you can't reason out nothing
[31:39] that's right our minds not see is not
[31:42] good enough or never will be to fathom
[31:44] God's eternal wisdom and therefore you
[31:48] can't read this you just got to believe
[31:49] until then the picture was painted out
[31:52] back there - our first father and mother
[31:54] and they fell and that broke off
[31:57] relationship with God and was drove for
[31:59] the Garden of Eden from that hour God
[32:02] begins to scream up and down the gardens
[32:03] hunting for his lost child and then the
[32:06] only way that God then could ever redeem
[32:08] him would have to be to make to come
[32:11] down and redeeming himself not in
[32:13] another or not send somebody else he
[32:18] could have sent an angel that would be
[32:20] right but only way God could redeem the
[32:23] man was come down himself and read even
[32:25] if somebody stands here and my Allah the
[32:28] judgment of this this group of people
[32:30] and I had the jurisdiction over you all
[32:32] and if I have someone sinned and I said
[32:36] now opera the groom I want you to pay
[32:37] the prize that would be just if I said
[32:41] my own boy
[32:42] to pay the price that still wouldn't be
[32:44] on the judge the only way that I can be
[32:46] just just for me myself to take his
[32:49] place and what house one pass the
[32:52] judgment and then if I want to redeem
[32:54] the man I've got to take his place
[32:55] myself
[32:56] are you still listen at dollar I want
[32:58] you to notice something thin ones that
[33:00] the only way that God Himself could ever
[33:03] redeem this man was to come down and
[33:05] take his place and that was the hall
[33:08] that was given by Moses of radition
[33:11] that had to be to a kinsman redeemer on
[33:14] man / - was worthy a man who was worth
[33:17] the prize a man then who would make it
[33:19] to public testimony and redeemed the
[33:21] losses think of somebody that had fought
[33:23] and then God was word he came down some
[33:27] 1,900
[33:28] years ago in the form of a baby born in
[33:31] a manger overshadowed by the Holy Ghost
[33:33] not for my sexual desire he was God to
[33:37] God's blood position the baby is always
[33:41] the blood of its father never of its
[33:43] mother we all know that without I've
[33:45] taught that before your times and you
[33:47] know that the baby has not one speck of
[33:49] its mother's blood in it
[33:50] not a bit no nothing done it's always
[33:52] the blood of the male a hand can lay an
[33:55] egg but if it isn't fertile
[33:56] it'll never hatch no matter how pretty
[33:58] the egg is and how well she warms it
[34:00] it'll always be unfertile early right
[34:02] there and rock that's right
[34:04] unless the male bird has been with the
[34:06] female bird and the germ of life comes
[34:09] from the male
[34:10] therefore when Mary knowing not a man
[34:12] she was with the male God Almighty
[34:16] Jehovah and he overshadowed her and God
[34:19] is the creator that created a blood cell
[34:22] in the womb of Mary no one no man at all
[34:24] and fat brought forth of very creative
[34:27] role of God to redeem us from our life
[34:30] coming in years being born of sexual
[34:32] desire and then that blood was drawn out
[34:36] of Emmanuel's veins on Calvary's cross
[34:38] and today has the same saving redeeming
[34:41] holy power that it did the day the
[34:44] transmission was made out of cow reach
[34:46] agreement hey pal that's right we're
[34:50] redeemed by the blood of God the Bible
[34:52] says we are bought by the blood and
[34:54] redeemed by block God's own blood how
[34:58] was it God's good God has no blood how
[35:00] could it be because it was God's
[35:02] creative blood and he created in order
[35:05] to redeem us and came and lived in the
[35:07] same body that he created therefore he
[35:09] could not Godhead in summer temptation
[35:11] he could suffer temptation he had to
[35:13] suffer sexual temptation he had to
[35:16] suffer all kinds of temptations to be
[35:19] tempted by the devil and riches and
[35:21] powers and the minions and so forth he
[35:24] had to suffer all of that in order to do
[35:26] it he couldn't be his God in spirit he
[35:28] had to be God in flesh I'm speaking this
[35:30] morning on the deity of Christ so it
[35:32] you'll know who he is we're worse
[35:34] not if they did a major not sanicball
[35:36] but we're worshipping Almighty God in
[35:40] the deity of his son and notice then
[35:42] that blood came down analyst was Christ
[35:45] Jesus and God Himself coming out of
[35:48] spirit went into Christ Jesus and the
[35:50] Bible says that God was in Christ
[35:52] reconciling the world to himself in that
[35:54] right God himself
[35:56] Jehovah lived in Christ and was made a
[35:59] kinsman to us because he was born in
[36:02] human flesh like we are that right the
[36:04] blood cells were developed by God and
[36:07] the flesh cells were developed in the
[36:10] womb of Mary the soft worth the child
[36:12] and God came down and lived in human
[36:15] flesh and was tempted in every manner
[36:17] just like we are do you believe that
[36:18] honey
[36:19] all right Wow then when he did that he
[36:22] freely gave his but he didn't have to do
[36:25] it he made that sacrifice he could've
[36:27] went right on up into glory he could
[36:28] have been transfigured like he was on
[36:30] that Transfiguration went all into
[36:32] Hammond and never dies first but to be
[36:34] willing to die for us he gave freely his
[36:38] blood at Calvary
[36:40] that's right and he picked out even the
[36:42] manastar I played with grease and he
[36:45] made a public testimony and those brute
[36:47] Book of Ruth is a very beautiful picture
[36:48] there how this Boaz type of Christ
[36:51] Haledon truth won over a strange country
[36:54] as the backslide one out of the land and
[36:57] brought back with her I mean the old man
[36:59] brought back room and when Ruth came
[37:01] back she was a country boy Evan when she
[37:05] came back she was a moment I absolutely
[37:08] assured the Gentile bride of the church
[37:10] and when she went to leave the OMA and
[37:13] the OMA told her said kiss her told her
[37:15] go back to her people she said I will go
[37:18] with you to your people venture people
[37:21] be my people and let your dwellings be
[37:24] my dwellings that your God be my god and
[37:27] nothing but death shall separate us
[37:29] where you dive dive where you're buried
[37:31] I'll be buried now that is a picture of
[37:33] the Gentile church coming into Christ
[37:36] cause we were once aliens away from God
[37:39] was what the ones the Beast ate but we
[37:42] beat Danny Christ take only for him see
[37:44] that our heirs according to the promise
[37:46] and Christ got a Gentile bride that's
[37:49] exactly right
[37:50] now in order to redeem Boaz to redeem
[37:53] the oldest lost with space after the
[37:54] fact played the State of Israel Ben boy
[37:58] that boy had to come out and when he did
[38:01] a boy has brother and when he came out
[38:03] he had to kick off his shoe before the
[38:05] gates that before the elders to make a
[38:07] public testimony that he had received
[38:09] that lost woman in her estate and in
[38:12] doing that they need fought back also he
[38:15] got in there his bride the woman he is
[38:17] looking for if you had to redeem the
[38:18] woman first in order to get the bride
[38:20] don't you see and that's the same train
[38:22] Christ it he made a public testimony at
[38:24] the gates of Jerusalem when he was
[38:27] beaten smitten depleted and regretted up
[38:30] calories calico Gambas heel and baby
[38:33] they deal with his own blood as a public
[38:36] testimony that he had redeemed all the
[38:38] call of the state from back down her
[38:40] beginning and has redeemed his people
[38:42] from the curse of sin and from the
[38:45] clutches of hell and annoying as she
[38:47] would eat something more in a way states
