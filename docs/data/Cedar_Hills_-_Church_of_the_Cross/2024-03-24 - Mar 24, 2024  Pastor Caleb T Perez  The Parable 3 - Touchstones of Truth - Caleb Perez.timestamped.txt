[36:26] for
[36:57] oh first I'll do a
[37:02] testimony uh
[37:05] November of
[37:07] Thanksgiving I went into the hospital
[37:09] with double
[37:11] pneumonia and
[37:13] then kind of got over that my breathing
[37:16] hasn't caught up yet
[37:20] but Christmas
[37:23] day I could not
[37:26] breathe and
[37:28] uh Thanksgiving they said that I was
[37:31] getting about went from 30% down to
[37:38] 20% activity of my heart when I went in
[37:43] Christmas they said I had complete heart
[37:47] failure and
[37:50] uh that wasn't good news but they
[37:55] also changed doctor and I got another
[37:58] doctor and he gave me a cardiac
[38:04] [Music]
[38:06] catheterization and he said that no my
[38:10] bottom half of my heart was putting out
[38:12] at 50% which is what it's supposed to
[38:16] that there was just a
[38:21] mixup at the top of my
[38:24] heart uh
[38:26] electrical and uh so I'm going to
[38:30] probably be going in pretty quick for
[38:34] uh called an
[38:36] oblation but I'm not worried about it
[38:41] uh and
[38:43] uh so if I'm I get breathless real easy
[38:48] and that's why I'm sitting
[38:53] down but this one song it's an old song
[38:58] and
[38:59] uh it's written by Chris
[39:04] kristopherson everybody knows he's not
[39:07] really that great but he did have
[39:10] a
[39:13] uh he had a religious
[39:16] experience where he he went to
[39:19] church
[39:21] and they were preaching and you know
[39:24] everybody started raising their hands
[39:26] and these think ain't no way I'm going
[39:29] to do
[39:32] that hands start going up and and then
[39:36] they call for people to come up to go to
[39:38] the front
[39:40] to you know give their heart to the
[39:46] Altar and he said in his mind ain't no
[39:49] way I'm going to do
[39:51] that next thing he knows he's up at the
[39:54] front at the
[39:57] and the preacher starts talking to him
[40:00] and he says what you know are you going
[40:02] to accept he says I don't know I don't
[40:05] even know why I'm
[40:10] here and uh he said he felt such a sense
[40:14] of relief and
[40:16] forgiveness that he was just sitting
[40:18] there
[40:21] crying and three days later he came up
[40:25] with this song I've heard it way back
[40:28] and I kind of like

[49:49] to come
[49:52] to but no matter where we are we have a
[49:54] place and that is in Christ
[49:59] amen we've learned that anytime we read
[50:02] about the heavens and the
[50:06] Earth they're in the
[50:08] Bible we're speaking about the
[50:12] parable you talk about heavens and earth
[50:14] and the Earthly and the
[50:16] Heavenly it's about the parable it's
[50:19] about the great
[50:20] story and the parable is the
[50:25] plan it's the whole Plan of Redemption
[50:28] that was
[50:30] unfolded there's Mya God bless you
[50:34] Sister eie and eie God bless
[50:39] her that's a familiar face amen it's a
[50:44] plan the parable is the
[50:46] plan and it is the unfolding of the
[50:49] greatest story that's ever been
[50:53] told turn to your neighbor and say and
[50:55] you are part of that great
[50:59] story you are part of that great
[51:03] story how many know that the that the
[51:05] message has levels
[51:07] huh you know when you think you got a
[51:10] hold of the message
[51:13] good he comes and gives us another
[51:16] level and he says come up a little bit
[51:20] higher and we thought that we were on a
[51:23] pretty high level and and then all of a
[51:25] sudden we see man there's we can go up a
[51:27] little bit
[51:30] more amen and that's what we're grateful
[51:33] to God
[51:34] for Mark the 4th chapter and the 33rd
[51:37] verse and the 34th
[51:51] verse so you got to pinch yourself this
[51:53] morning
[51:54] okay best brother
[51:57] brother Uncle Chuck and a Paula and
[51:59] sister Carmen and they Brave the snow
[52:02] and the wind to get this
[52:07] morning Sil City amen that's what you
[52:12] call presenting your body a Living
[52:16] Sacrifice it says like this and with
[52:18] many such Parables spake he the word
[52:23] which is the logos unto them
[52:31] as they were able to
[52:34] hear okay how many of you are able to
[52:37] hear he spake these Parables as they
[52:40] were able to
[52:42] hear right because Faith only comes One
[52:46] Way by hearing and the hearing
[52:49] of the word of God Amen but without a
[52:53] parable spake he not unto them
[52:58] and when they were
[53:01] alone he expounded all things to his
[53:06] disciples may God add His blessings to
[53:09] the reading of his word you may be
[53:11] seated what a thing it is to get alone
[53:14] with him
[53:15] amen I'm going to say it again what a
[53:18] thing it is to get alone with
[53:20] him how many of you have gotten alone
[53:23] with the Lord
[53:25] before how many of you can say I want to
[53:27] get more more more with
[53:31] him Parables as we say and we'll we'll
[53:34] we'll say this just just to to to remind
[53:38] us but I think we all know it now a
[53:41] parable can you define it for me
[53:45] somebody what was
[53:48] that very good an Earthly story with a
[53:51] Heavenly
[53:53] meaning and it also means to place one
[53:56] thing side by side with
[54:00] another for the purpose of
[54:05] what for the purpose of comparing
[54:09] amen all right putting things side by
[54:12] side for the purpose of
[54:15] comparing and with such Parables he
[54:18] spake the word unto
[54:21] them one writer states
[54:24] this the one who spake in many
[54:29] parables is the same
[54:31] one who inspired holy men of
[54:36] old to write the Old
[54:39] Testament right everybody got that who
[54:42] spoke all these
[54:45] Parables Jesus spoke all these Parables
[54:49] right and he who spake all these
[54:53] Parables once again is the same one
[54:56] who inspired holy men of
[54:59] old to write the Old
[55:03] Testament that's why he
[55:05] says we can therefore
[55:09] expect to trace the same
[55:13] mind running through the whole
[55:17] scriptures all right in another I'm
[55:19] going to say it again you can see the
[55:21] same
[55:23] mind so many things that Jesus had said
[55:28] you go back to the Old
[55:30] Testament you find out many things that
[55:32] that were said back
[55:34] then men were inspired or these
[55:38] scriptures were God
[55:43] breathed but the same mind that breathed
[55:46] these thoughts into these men of
[55:51] old is the same mind that had put on
[55:54] flesh and blood
[55:57] and began to preach and to teach in
[56:01] Parables many of The
[56:04] Parables types the
[56:06] Shadows the visions of the
[56:09] old were Illustrated and light was
[56:13] placed on those things in the New
[56:16] Testament which proved one
[56:19] thing there was a Unity there in the
[56:24] scriptures now parables are
[56:27] fascinating and the more that I look
[56:29] into it the more that I'm like
[56:33] wow parables are
[56:36] fascinating in that one cannot receive
[56:41] Revelation without the
[56:43] parable we want revelation how many want
[56:46] more
[56:47] Revelation I think we all raise our
[56:49] hands because we want more
[56:53] revelation God bless you brother Henry
[56:56] good to have you home amen we want more
[57:00] Revelation and that's the thing that
[57:02] Satan hates the
[57:04] most he hates
[57:06] Revelation he hates when God reveals
[57:09] himself to
[57:12] you and he even hates it more when he
[57:15] reveals himself through
[57:18] you the par is the wrapping of the
[57:22] Revelation how many understand that I'm
[57:25] going to say it again
[57:26] there is a
[57:28] revelation that comes from the mind of
[57:31] God but it has to be wrapped in
[57:35] something and the wrapping of the
[57:39] Revelation is the
[57:41] parable okay this is why the parable is
[57:44] so
[57:45] important you don't catch the
[57:48] parable you don't catch the
[57:50] symbol you don't catch the right
[57:53] Revelation oh you can get some
[57:55] revelation or some understanding of
[57:59] things but it won't take you very
[58:01] far once again it is the wrapping of
[58:04] what was in the mind of
[58:08] God God great plan lies in the
[58:14] Revelation hi once again and wrapped in
[58:17] the
[58:18] parable brother Bram writes a
[58:22] letter to a man that he had had services
[58:25] with
[58:27] his name was Reverend C Parker
[58:29] Thomas Parker Thomas many of you have
[58:31] ever read that
[58:33] letter he was a pastor there in South
[58:36] Carolina South Carolina I I'm not going
[58:38] to read the whole letter but I I want to
[58:41] highlight this this part of the letter
[58:43] that he's writing to this
[58:47] man he States this he says being a Bible
[58:51] student you know that the infinite
[58:54] omniscient God
[58:59] there's two things there right the
[59:02] infinite omnis
[59:05] God had a
[59:07] plan brother brandom is writing to this
[59:10] man he had a plan now to me that's
[59:13] that's the parable is the
[59:15] plan and then he says that he not only
[59:18] originated in his
[59:22] wisdom but by his
[59:25] omnipotence
[59:26] he put it into
[59:28] effect now we can have the wisdom of
[59:33] God this originates the very plan of
[59:38] God but without the omnipotence of
[59:42] God the plan just stays a
[59:45] plan the word just stays
[59:48] word there's no action to it there's no
[59:51] unfolding to
[59:53] it now notice notice this now watch as
[59:56] he continues in this
[59:58] letter being God he could not
[1:00:02] fail he is
[1:00:04] Sovereign thus it must
[1:00:07] stand that this Sovereign
[1:00:10] God could predestinate
[1:00:14] men or otherwise his purpose would
[1:00:19] fail and God cannot
[1:00:21] fail so he predestinated
[1:00:24] men what to unfold the
[1:00:29] plan put the plan into
[1:00:32] action to put the word into
[1:00:34] action he had men that brought the
[1:00:38] word he had men that would unfold or
[1:00:41] make the word or put it into
[1:00:44] action a plan that he originated in his
[1:00:50] wisdom parables are speeches and
[1:00:54] sentences Stories full of spiritual
[1:00:57] wisdom and
[1:00:59] truth but yet at the same
[1:01:02] time they carry
[1:01:05] conviction and divine
[1:01:09] Authority parables are the touchstones
[1:01:12] of
[1:01:15] Truth now we all that we're going to get
[1:01:17] into our
[1:01:19] message you to tell your neighbor
[1:01:21] because repeating it it helps you very
[1:01:24] much me very
[1:01:27] much
[1:01:29] touchstones of
[1:01:31] truth touchstones of
[1:01:34] Truth
[1:01:36] par right the parable has the Touchstone
[1:01:39] of Truth in
[1:01:41] it once again
[1:01:43] Parables have the touchstones of
[1:01:47] Truth all right
[1:01:49] Parables as we said is placing one thing
[1:01:52] side by
[1:01:54] side
[1:01:56] for the purpose of
[1:02:00] comparing now I hope you you're with me
[1:02:02] this
[1:02:04] morning when you begin to compare
[1:02:08] something you have to be able to
[1:02:12] compare apples to apples they
[1:02:23] say once again now it's my you have to
[1:02:26] compare apples to
[1:02:29] apples you can't get a
[1:02:34] banana and say well let's compare a
[1:02:36] banana with an
[1:02:38] orange totally different
[1:02:42] characteristics different different
[1:02:43] taste different different shapes
[1:02:45] different nothing comparable only that
[1:02:48] you can put them under the same category
[1:02:50] of
[1:02:51] fruit but other than
[1:02:54] that so it is in life when we try to
[1:02:58] compare
[1:02:59] things we we are so good at trying to
[1:03:03] compare things
[1:03:05] right that that when you put things side
[1:03:08] by
[1:03:08] side how many of you have suffered in in
[1:03:11] one form or another in
[1:03:14] life I I think we should all be able to
[1:03:17] raise our hands
[1:03:19] right sickness or or hardships or
[1:03:23] whatever it is we've all suffered in
[1:03:24] some form or
[1:03:26] another now now if I were to get our
[1:03:31] sufferings and I would compare them with
[1:03:34] the with the glory that's that is to be
[1:03:36] revealed in
[1:03:38] us could you compare those two
[1:03:43] things wait wait a minute why then do we
[1:03:46] compare
[1:03:48] this why in our life do we always
[1:03:53] compare I've had it rough
[1:03:56] oh I mean if we really
[1:03:59] knew by the touchstones of
[1:04:03] faith that you cannot compare your
[1:04:08] suffering with the glory that shall be
[1:04:10] revealed
[1:04:13] us scripture says
[1:04:15] this it says in Romans 8 for the
[1:04:19] suffering of this present
[1:04:22] time are not even Worthy
[1:04:26] to be compared with the
[1:04:30] glory that shall be revealed in
[1:04:34] us oh my my then now we have something
[1:04:38] that we can't
[1:04:40] compare you cannot compare one thing to
[1:04:44] another unless you have a basis to
[1:04:48] compare
[1:04:51] it I'm going to say it again you have to
[1:04:54] have a basis for
[1:04:58] comparison or else your comparison is in
[1:05:02] vain think about this we must take the
[1:05:05] Heavenly
[1:05:07] truth and the Earthly
[1:05:09] truth and we must compare them
[1:05:13] together can they be
[1:05:16] compared yes only under the
[1:05:20] parable yes sir are you with me come on
[1:05:24] now you got to yourself this
[1:05:27] morning you can you can compare the
[1:05:30] Heavenly truth with the Earthly
[1:05:34] truth because it has the same
[1:05:39] Touchstone okay here we go take two
[1:05:42] people if I were to say okay I'm gonna
[1:05:45] take brother brother
[1:05:49] Isaac and then I'm going to take
[1:05:53] Nate and I'm going to see them them side
[1:05:56] by
[1:05:58] side and I'm going to
[1:06:01] say I'm going to compare these
[1:06:05] two what's my basis for
[1:06:10] comparison is my bases see who's
[1:06:16] taller is it to see who's the better
[1:06:18] basketball
[1:06:19] player
[1:06:22] basketball he said you were shake his
[1:06:26] hand say
[1:06:27] thanks all right is it I mean what is it
[1:06:31] what what's the
[1:06:33] comparison is it maybe
[1:06:37] music I don't know maybe how to work or
[1:06:41] different kinds of work I mean I have to
[1:06:43] have a basis for comparing
[1:06:46] them now if I see two people that go to
[1:06:50] church and I try to compare
[1:06:53] them my comparison it will always fall
[1:06:58] short because I'm using my own
[1:07:02] Touchstone my own
[1:07:04] idea of what I think a Christian should
[1:07:08] be so then I'll say oh that brother he
[1:07:11] more holy and more more saintly than the
[1:07:13] other
[1:07:14] brother oh that sister wears longer
[1:07:17] skirts all the way to the ground so
[1:07:18] she's got to be more
[1:07:22] holy what's my
[1:07:24] comparison is it a long
[1:07:28] skirt is it how long hair
[1:07:31] grows some people's hair don't grow as
[1:07:33] long as
[1:07:34] others some of us our hair is just
[1:07:36] falling
[1:07:38] out it's part of
[1:07:41] life but but the thing is is that
[1:07:43] there's got to be some kind of
[1:07:47] comparison that both of
[1:07:50] them are compared
[1:07:52] to instead of comparing people to each
[1:07:57] other that's the error we make you don't
[1:08:00] compare two people to each
[1:08:02] other because each one has had a
[1:08:06] different path in
[1:08:09] life yet they both have come to one
[1:08:13] thing and that's the word therefore I
[1:08:16] can't compare the
[1:08:18] people not even myself to
[1:08:21] anyone I have to stand or lay side by
[1:08:25] side with the
[1:08:27] word and use the word as my
[1:08:32] Touchstone am I am I getting across this
[1:08:34] morning we have to do that this
[1:08:37] morning not look at your neighbor look
[1:08:40] at yourself by the
[1:08:42] word I I I say all this for
[1:08:46] this this brings us brings to light the
[1:08:49] word
[1:08:52] Touchstone
[1:08:54] truth
[1:08:56] the touch Stone here's here's the
[1:08:58] definition now you'll know what a
[1:09:01] touchone you won't forget after
[1:09:03] today Touchstone is the
[1:09:07] basis of
[1:09:09] comparison once again you cannot compare
[1:09:12] two things unless you have the same
[1:09:16] bases it is a reference
[1:09:19] point against which other things can be
[1:09:24] evaluated
[1:09:26] for its quality or
[1:09:29] Excellence it is the
[1:09:32] Criterion it is the gauge or the
[1:09:37] standard once again the Touchstone is
[1:09:39] the
[1:09:41] standard now in old
[1:09:44] times they would take a a piece of
[1:09:49] Jasper this Stone then somebody would
[1:09:52] come to me and say brother Ethan would
[1:09:54] say uh I've got some gold
[1:09:58] coins brother Ruben would say I've got
[1:10:00] some silver
[1:10:02] coins bring them over
[1:10:05] here this Stone of
[1:10:08] Jasper was the
[1:10:10] Touchstone in other words this was the
[1:10:12] way I would evaluate their
[1:10:17] Stones because as I took the stone the
[1:10:19] the the the
[1:10:21] coin and I would I would I would scratch
[1:10:25] the top of this
[1:10:27] rock it would leave a certain type of
[1:10:31] Mark now if it was only 10%
[1:10:34] gold it would leave a certain kind of
[1:10:37] Mark it was 50%
[1:10:40] silver it would leave a certain kind of
[1:10:42] Mark if it was pure silver or pure
[1:10:46] gold it would leave a different kind of
[1:10:49] Mark so by me taking your coins and
[1:10:51] running it over the
[1:10:54] Touchstone I tell if your point was
[1:10:57] worth something or
[1:10:59] not now Christ is the
[1:11:02] Touchstone because Christ is the word
[1:11:06] and no matter what revelation we claim
[1:11:08] to
[1:11:09] have you got to take the
[1:11:12] Revelation and You' got to rub it
[1:11:14] against the
[1:11:16] stone and to see if it's worth anything
[1:11:18] or not to see if your Revelation is from
[1:11:22] God or if it's just a Creed doctrine of
[1:11:25] a
[1:11:27] church we all got to go to the touch
[1:11:30] Stone and we've got to scrape it here
[1:11:32] for we're making that our standard our
[1:11:39] truth I am the
[1:11:41] way and I am the truth and I am the life
[1:11:46] he's the standard now come on now look
[1:11:49] look at this you look
[1:11:52] online you young ladies
[1:11:55] you look

[1:12:23] morning do you guys ever do knowbody
[1:12:25] yeah I'm just want to see if you're if
[1:12:28] you're going to rub your stone up
[1:12:29] against the the rub your coin up against
[1:12:32] the
[1:12:35] Jasper we bring these
[1:12:37] things and in in in in seeing
[1:12:42] this we we look at that and we say man I
[1:12:46] would like to dress and look like
[1:12:50] that and without
[1:12:54] realizing we uh we are
[1:12:57] making that style and that
[1:13:02] fashion we're making that our
[1:13:06] Touchstone right that's our point of
[1:13:12] reference that's our
[1:13:15] standard well if I leave it a little bit
[1:13:20] low
[1:13:21] okay where did that standard come from
[1:13:27] who lowered the
[1:13:28] standard well if I chop it all who
[1:13:31] lowered the
[1:13:33] standard well if I paint and I get all
[1:13:36] these big
[1:13:37] long where you getting your standard
[1:13:42] from well if I just just it's okay if I
[1:13:45] just cuss a little
[1:13:48] bit what what's your
[1:13:51] Touchstone your
[1:13:54] standard
[1:13:55] that's right how many are with me this
[1:13:57] morning we're getting to something here
[1:14:00] I want you to really understand what and
[1:14:03] who your Touchstone
[1:14:05] is you can look at a lot of
[1:14:08] things but everything we compare
[1:14:11] ourselves
[1:14:12] to well well well she's prettier than
[1:14:15] me you're making her your
[1:14:19] Touchstone so you're going to try to do
[1:14:21] your hair like her and dress like her
[1:14:24] and be like her and sing like her and
[1:14:26] act like her be like him and and and
[1:14:30] lift the weights like them and the next
[1:14:32] thing you know it your touch Stone has
[1:14:35] changed and when your touchone changes
[1:14:38] your standard goes
[1:14:40] down when the standard goes down the
[1:14:43] enemy walks
[1:14:45] in the enemy doesn't even have to
[1:14:49] fight in because the standard was
[1:14:54] lowered who's your
[1:14:57] Touchstone the error of our
[1:14:59] ways the error of our
[1:15:02] ways then when it comes into
[1:15:08] Christianity we can talk about these
[1:15:10] other things that that's just carnal
[1:15:14] stuff the real thing is the
[1:15:17] unbelief we do those things because we
[1:15:19] don't
[1:15:21] believe so we've got to come and bring
[1:15:23] ourselves back
[1:15:26] not to compare with
[1:15:29] someone but compare it with the pattern
[1:15:31] of the
[1:15:34] word are you with me yes or yes now now
[1:15:38] now notice this now when we see the
[1:15:42] Parable with a
[1:15:44] touchstone it makes all the sense in the
[1:15:48] world because now you have the correct
[1:15:53] bases touchstones of
[1:15:56] Truth now keep that in mind as we go
[1:15:59] forward everybody knows what a
[1:16:01] touchstone is now right the basis it's
[1:16:04] what you judge everything
[1:16:07] by and until the Touchstone is
[1:16:09] established in our
[1:16:12] Parable we simply just have an Earthly
[1:16:18] story right this is why people
[1:16:22] say this is a very common phrase now
[1:16:25] now this is my
[1:16:29] truth Your
[1:16:31] Truth probably so what a low
[1:16:37] standard when when I think that my ways
[1:16:40] are the
[1:16:43] truth dirty
[1:16:45] standard Jesus said I am the weight and
[1:16:48] I
[1:16:49] am that's my standard the word not the
[1:16:53] brother or sister is the standard now
[1:16:56] the word has to come in
[1:16:58] flesh we understand and Paul would
[1:17:01] say be ye followers of me why because
[1:17:05] the word had come to their
[1:17:08] time in flesh and blood and the
[1:17:12] messenger became the standard to that
[1:17:16] age now that's the parable unfolding
[1:17:19] now notice this now Christ is the
[1:17:23] mystery of God revealed
[1:17:25] he says reveal is to make
[1:17:28] known in Divine
[1:17:32] truth ah he didn't leave out the
[1:17:34] Touchstone did you get
[1:17:36] it reveal is to make
[1:17:39] known and then he says in Divine
[1:17:45] truth something can be revealed to
[1:17:48] us I can say I bet you all don't know
[1:17:51] what I have inside this
[1:17:53] Bible
[1:18:01] I have a picture
[1:18:04] here and I'm going to reveal to you what
[1:18:06] was in
[1:18:08] there a
[1:18:10] picture you can't see it you know who
[1:18:14] gave me this
[1:18:15] picture sister
[1:18:17] Bera in my
[1:18:20] Bible it is the picture and it's hard
[1:18:23] for you to tell what it is
[1:18:26] but it's a squirrel a
[1:18:29] scroll not a squirrel man I'm in trouble
[1:18:33] huh
[1:18:34] yeah it's a scroll am I saying that
[1:18:39] right
[1:18:40] scroll
[1:18:43] scroll I'm having trouble with
[1:18:45] squirrel scroll
[1:18:49] today it is a
[1:18:52] scroll and it says a is coming forth out
[1:18:55] of the
[1:18:58] scroll and it and in there it says the
[1:19:01] word became
[1:19:04] flesh oh well now now you
[1:19:07] know but now it's not just a
[1:19:11] revealing there is a Divine truth in
[1:19:14] this how that from a scroll a man can
[1:19:17] come
[1:19:18] for see that's the Divine truth in all
[1:19:21] this how that from the letter of the
[1:19:24] Bible
[1:19:26] come forth a
[1:19:28] bride that is the
[1:19:31] word why it's a touchstone of
[1:19:34] Truth this is the
[1:19:36] Touchstone but when it comes into the
[1:19:40] individual you then can become the
[1:19:45] Touchstone let me not get ahead of
[1:19:47] myself
[1:19:48] here it's in Divine truth the
[1:19:52] Revelation it is Christ's way of making
[1:19:55] himself known to his
[1:19:58] church the
[1:20:00] Revelation is how Christ makes himself
[1:20:03] known
[1:20:10] to the Revelation is how Christ makes
[1:20:13] himself known
[1:20:14] to
[1:20:17] oh Caleb this is how he makes himself
[1:20:21] known to
[1:20:22] me let's let's go on
[1:20:25] he's making himself
[1:20:27] known but before he can do that he has
[1:20:31] to establish truth in
[1:20:34] US truth has got to be
[1:20:37] established now now if I asked you how
[1:20:39] many of you have been established in
[1:20:43] truth how many believe
[1:20:45] that yeah yeah kind of I don't
[1:20:49] know let me see your hands like you
[1:20:52] believe it raise your hand I believe
[1:20:55] established in
[1:20:57] truth we thank God for this
[1:21:00] message for a prophet that he
[1:21:03] sent for an apostle that was sent to
[1:21:06] establish what the prophet
[1:21:09] said in order to establish
[1:21:13] truth men of God were
[1:21:16] sent to do this
[1:21:19] work what is a sent one an apostle he is
[1:21:23] the sent one
[1:21:25] he said men of God were sent forth to do
[1:21:27] this
[1:21:30] work to establish truth in you and
[1:21:34] I Christ the mystery Wesley was a man of
[1:21:39] God all right is that truth truth
[1:21:42] whether somebody likes it or not it's
[1:21:45] truth he says but what followed
[1:21:48] him said this many times but what
[1:21:51] followed
[1:21:53] him Fallen Angels got into
[1:21:57] it what were these Angels
[1:22:00] first they were creative beings of
[1:22:04] God but they fell for Lucifer's
[1:22:09] wisdom and you see what they
[1:22:12] become fallen angels and
[1:22:17] organizations from Men of
[1:22:19] God who was sent forth to establish
[1:22:22] truths in the in the Earth
[1:22:31] come on now men of God sent forth to
[1:22:34] establish
[1:22:35] truth in
[1:22:37] Earth Caleb right right now now watch
[1:22:40] what he says here but before the truth
[1:22:43] could go
[1:22:46] on and
[1:22:48] proclamate and get onto the real
[1:22:51] revelation of
[1:22:52] Christ the Fallen Angels come in and
[1:22:55] took it
[1:22:57] over and they made denominations out of
[1:23:01] it that's the reason watch what brother
[1:23:04] Bram says
[1:23:05] this that's the reason the revelation of
[1:23:09] the seven
[1:23:13] mystery had to be
[1:23:16] unfolded a little at a time the parable
[1:23:20] had to be unfolded because if it was
[1:23:23] opened all at once
[1:23:26] Satan could do great damage with
[1:23:29] this here's here's where it comes
[1:23:32] to if Luther would have went
[1:23:36] on he would have been here Wesley
[1:23:39] Pentecost Wesley but now there's only
[1:23:41] one thing can
[1:23:43] happen there has to be a message at the
[1:23:46] end
[1:23:47] time when there's nothing else can
[1:23:50] follow
[1:23:51] it come on now there has to be a message
[1:23:55] did that message
[1:23:56] come yes it did did it come in word yes
[1:24:01] it did did it come in action yes it
[1:24:06] is yes or yes watch there has to be a
[1:24:09] message at the end
[1:24:12] time when there's nothing else can
[1:24:15] follow
[1:24:16] it what the message on
[1:24:19] paper no the message in
[1:24:22] flesh that when it takes you to go up
[1:24:26] higher nothing else can follow you
[1:24:29] there's no devil in hell can follow you
[1:24:31] where you're
[1:24:33] going that's what the message came to
[1:24:35] do take us up
[1:24:37] higher into Heavenly places in Christ
[1:24:42] Jesus this
[1:24:44] message is the only
[1:24:46] message that established the touchstones
[1:24:49] of
[1:24:51] Truth nothing else there's no other
[1:24:53] message
[1:24:54] I'm sorry but there's no other
[1:24:56] message Man placed his church his
[1:25:00] organization his Creed his dogmas he
[1:25:04] placed them as His
[1:25:08] touchstones well my church says well my
[1:25:12] pastor says watch it there could be some
[1:25:16] truth in there but if you don't watch it
[1:25:19] you're going to go off the deep
[1:25:20] end your touchstone's going to be wrong
[1:25:24] and then you'll find yourself in the
[1:25:28] gutter God has only one Touchstone of
[1:25:33] Truth tell your neighbor God has only
[1:25:36] one Touchstone of
[1:25:39] Truth and that is Christ the
[1:25:42] word all
[1:25:44] right God has a way of establishing the
[1:25:47] truth in
[1:25:50] you you know where it all starts are you
[1:25:53] ready
[1:25:54] where does it
[1:25:56] start it starts in
[1:26:00] prison all right you want to know the
[1:26:02] Touchstone or
[1:26:03] not now now this is this is to change
[1:26:06] our mentality about a lot of
[1:26:09] things it starts in
[1:26:12] prison we all want to sit in Rain
[1:26:16] amen how many
[1:26:20] amen nobody wants to sit in Rain those
[1:26:23] that don't want to sit in rain can you
[1:26:24] can leave
[1:26:25] now this message is for the ones that
[1:26:28] want to sit and
[1:26:29] rain let me ask again how many of you
[1:26:31] want to sit and
[1:26:33] rain I think that's why we're part of
[1:26:36] why we're
[1:26:36] here because there's a position there's
[1:26:39] a place that God has for
[1:26:41] us but it all starts in
[1:26:45] prison the parable continued in
[1:26:50] prison the parable started in
[1:26:53] prison
[1:26:54] and if we do not handle
[1:26:58] prison and know what to do in
[1:27:01] prison without prison you cannot
[1:27:07] Reign and without the
[1:27:10] pit you can't have the
[1:27:13] prison you know what story I'm going at
[1:27:15] huh you already know
[1:27:18] terrible which story am I talking
[1:27:21] about of Joseph
[1:27:25] handle the pit
[1:27:27] first oh look at me what did I do I
[1:27:31] didn't do nothing
[1:27:35] wrong all of a sudden you're taken out
[1:27:40] sold how many you ever had somebody sell
[1:27:42] you
[1:27:43] out real nice to
[1:27:46] you when you turn your back sell them
[1:27:51] out it happens right people really nice
[1:27:54] to your
[1:27:56] face so nice when you
[1:27:59] turn but notice this now it all starts
[1:28:03] or it continues but but with us it
[1:28:05] starts in
[1:28:07] prison and I want this to really really
[1:28:10] settle the parable gets going in the
[1:28:13] prison
[1:28:16] house but it's where nobody wants to
[1:28:19] be I thought I was going to rain with
[1:28:22] you
[1:28:23] Lord character to rain
[1:28:26] yet talking about myself I shouldn't
[1:28:28] just say you I say I should say
[1:28:30] we don't have the character to
[1:28:33] rain you don't suffer you can't
[1:28:36] rain you don't suffer you can't
[1:28:39] rain okay okay let's get somewhere with
[1:28:41] this this morning are you with
[1:28:42] me let's see where where the Holy Ghost
[1:28:45] takes us this
[1:28:46] morning every person born by sex is in
[1:28:51] the same
[1:28:52] prison look around
[1:28:55] that you don't think you're the only one
[1:28:56] that got put in
[1:28:59] prison look
[1:29:01] around as when you finish yawning look
[1:29:05] around all right all right now now look
[1:29:07] look around every single one of us was
[1:29:12] born into the same
[1:29:16] prison so quit the booing about being in
[1:29:19] prison and I have it so rough we were
[1:29:22] all born in sin
[1:29:26] the world speaking lies we are all born
[1:29:28] into a prison
[1:29:31] house and the faster we get that in our
[1:29:34] heart F the parable can
[1:29:39] unfold even before we did anything
[1:29:44] wrong we were born and born through sex
[1:29:47] of our mother and
[1:29:48] father we didn't do anything wrong yet
[1:29:52] and we're already in prison
[1:29:55] he says you're in a prison
[1:29:57] House of sin and death we were born to
[1:30:02] die who could keep the
[1:30:05] law any one of
[1:30:10] you who could keep the
[1:30:12] law no man is justified by the
[1:30:15] law no flesh can be saved by the
[1:30:19] law the law had no
[1:30:22] salvation the law was a prison
[1:30:26] house the law come and told you that you
[1:30:29] were a
[1:30:31] sinner but I go to church but you're a
[1:30:35] sinner but I I I help the widows and the
[1:30:39] orphans but you're a
[1:30:42] sinner it's good that you do all these
[1:30:44] things but you're still a
[1:30:47] sinner that's what the law came to do
[1:30:50] the law is what put us in in jail to
[1:30:52] begin with
[1:30:54] but it has no power to take us out of
[1:31:01] jail I wouldn't want to be a
[1:31:04] prisoner and that's what the law
[1:31:07] does shuts you
[1:31:10] up let me tell shut up you're going to
[1:31:16] hell but I I my my mom and my dad they
[1:31:20] were good you're going to hell
[1:31:22] shut that's that's what the law does I
[1:31:25] don't want to be a a a prisoner he says
[1:31:28] like
[1:31:29] that it condemns you Thou shalt
[1:31:33] not and if you do you're in prison no
[1:31:37] way of getting out I don't want the
[1:31:40] law God wanted to bless his
[1:31:43] children he couldn't do it under the
[1:31:48] law neither could he under judgment and
[1:31:52] justice but the only way he could do it
[1:31:58] was under the love of his son Christ
[1:32:02] Jesus this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:32:09] pleased what is it all the law is
[1:32:17] finished maybe we'll get our crosses up
[1:32:20] all the law was finished
[1:32:25] he fulfilled it all when he gave his
[1:32:28] life on the
[1:32:29] cross we're coming into
[1:32:31] Easter got a lot of
[1:32:34] meaning but watch this now all the law
[1:32:37] was
[1:32:38] finished all the judgments is
[1:32:41] finished my beloved Son hear
[1:32:46] him all those other things are
[1:32:50] done this is him
[1:32:52] now in PR
[1:32:54] prison we have the
[1:32:59] word I'm going to say it again in prison
[1:33:03] we have the
[1:33:04] word I'll tell you what brother Brown
[1:33:06] says tell you what the word what the
[1:33:08] Bible says in prison you have the
[1:33:11] word

[1:33:22] m
[1:33:26] in prison we got the
[1:33:29] word that's not
[1:33:34] goody through the hearing of the
[1:33:37] word we have to understand
[1:33:39] this that there is a key to
[1:33:43] Salvation listen closely Church there's
[1:33:46] a key to
[1:33:48] Salvation for those that are in the
[1:33:50] prison
[1:33:52] house was me is that anybody else
[1:33:56] there's a key here for Caleb there's a
[1:33:59] key to the
[1:34:01] door to liberate us from it and
[1:34:05] establish the truth in
[1:34:07] us that through the hearing of the
[1:34:10] word
[1:34:12] conviction and divine
[1:34:15] Authority are
[1:34:19] activated God's goal is for this great
[1:34:23] parable to
[1:34:26] unfold in his
[1:34:29] mind he knew we would be in
[1:34:32] prison in his mind he already knew how
[1:34:36] he was going to open your
[1:34:43] prison wait a wait wait a minute I'm GNA
[1:34:46] say it again in his mind he knew when
[1:34:51] and how your door of your prison would
[1:34:53] be
[1:34:57] every one of our brothers it seems like
[1:34:59] was in
[1:35:01] prison yes you're looking at me like you
[1:35:04] don't know read your Bible I think the
[1:35:08] first one in prison in the Bible was
[1:35:10] Joseph
[1:35:11] right and on and on you go and John the
[1:35:14] Baptist and on and on you go in Paul and
[1:35:17] Peter and and I think there was probably
[1:35:19] more people in the New Testament in
[1:35:21] prison than in the
[1:35:22] old
[1:35:24] they were all in
[1:35:25] prison but God had a way of opening the
[1:35:28] prison
[1:35:29] door how was Peter's prison door
[1:35:33] open because there was people
[1:35:36] praying and when all of a sudden the
[1:35:38] angel of the Lord comes
[1:35:41] down SE Peter in
[1:35:44] prison opens the door for him he walks
[1:35:47] right out all right now it wasn't that
[1:35:50] easy for for for for Joseph
[1:35:55] Joseph was in his
[1:35:56] prison but God has a way because in his
[1:36:01] mind and I'm going to go through these
[1:36:02] three scriptures real quick Isaiah
[1:36:06] 611 the spirit of the Lord God is upon
[1:36:10] me because the Lord hath anointed me to
[1:36:13] preach Good Tidings unto the
[1:36:19] meek sent me to bind up the
[1:36:22] Brokenhearted
[1:36:24] to Proclaim Liberty to the
[1:36:27] captives and the opening of the
[1:36:31] prison to Caleb that was
[1:36:35] bound oh can you put your name there all
[1:36:38] right Psalms
[1:36:40] 102 and let's go to Just verse 20 to
[1:36:43] hear the groaning of the
[1:36:46] prisoner to lose those that are
[1:36:49] appointed to
[1:36:51] death Isaiah 42 says
[1:36:54] say to open the blind
[1:36:57] eyes to open the blind
[1:37:00] eyes to bring out the prisoners from
[1:37:04] prison and them that sit in
[1:37:07] darkness out of the prison house you see
[1:37:11] you must take control of your prison
[1:37:14] before he lets you out of
[1:37:17] it oh come on come on now is there
[1:37:20] anyone else with
[1:37:21] me you can't even get on the
[1:37:24] throne unless you start to control your
[1:37:29] prison Paul and silus were
[1:37:32] there and what did they do did they cry
[1:37:35] about being in prison they sang songs
[1:37:39] and
[1:37:41] worship what were they doing the parable
[1:37:44] was
[1:37:46] unfolding church I hope that you get
[1:37:48] this this night you must rule your
[1:37:52] prison before you can Ascend to the
[1:37:56] throne you get it come on now in his
[1:38:00] wisdom in his mind is the way you break
[1:38:04] out of
[1:38:06] prison prison
[1:38:10] break sounds like a good movie huh
[1:38:14] bre luck there probably is one called
[1:38:18] that do you get
[1:38:20] it if you don't believe me ask all your
[1:38:24] brothers that were in
[1:38:26] prison Hallelujah
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:32] Glory here's the parable Parable doesn't
[1:38:35] sound good at
[1:38:38] times we're brothers with with a bunch
[1:38:41] of
[1:38:44] excon right amen the parable reads Paul
[1:38:48] was in prison and Peter was in prison
[1:38:50] this one was in prison and Joseph and
[1:38:52] Daniel was in the line
[1:38:59] guilty
[1:39:01] guilty by
[1:39:04] representation
[1:39:06] yes but notice this
[1:39:08] now the attorney brother Bram says one
[1:39:10] of the attorneys
[1:39:13] said you got Brothers in federal
[1:39:18] prison I said I did
[1:39:20] have who were they one was brother John
[1:39:24] in
[1:39:26] Alcatraz or on the aisle of
[1:39:29] PM the other was Paul in a Roman
[1:39:33] jail prison
[1:39:36] house jph because he was accused of
[1:39:39] something he didn't even
[1:39:41] do condemned and laid in prison for
[1:39:45] years that's a good reason to be
[1:39:50] bitter I didn't even do it
[1:39:54] you get people today I didn't even do it
[1:39:56] I didn't do
[1:39:57] nothing why you blaming
[1:39:59] me well you're lucky we're blaming you
[1:40:02] and not putting you in
[1:40:05] prison usually the one saying I didn't
[1:40:07] do nothing is the ones that that
[1:40:10] usually I know I used that before I was
[1:40:14] Jung at one time I was Jung and I and I
[1:40:17] said things like
[1:40:18] that then I had to I grew up a little
[1:40:21] bit and I I had to say things the way
[1:40:23] they they should be
[1:40:25] said he said I didn't do but he didn't
[1:40:29] stay
[1:40:30] there he knew that there was a purpose
[1:40:33] for him being
[1:40:36] there he had a job to do in
[1:40:39] prison and before he could Ascend to the
[1:40:43] throne he had to make sure that the word
[1:40:45] was established in
[1:40:49] him what was the word that was
[1:40:52] established in
[1:40:54] somebody help me he's sitting in prison
[1:40:58] word got to be
[1:41:00] established what was the
[1:41:09] word so his he knew what was taught him
[1:41:13] by his
[1:41:16] father but as he sat
[1:41:18] there it was the dreams that he
[1:41:22] had right amen that was the word of the
[1:41:25] Lord to
[1:41:26] him so he began to think about that now
[1:41:29] you all remember this the message that I
[1:41:31] preach right if what you see is not what
[1:41:35] you saw then what you see is just
[1:41:39] temporary all right that that was that
[1:41:41] was what he that was the way he looked
[1:41:42] at
[1:41:43] it but in
[1:41:45] prison this is this is what brother
[1:41:48] brandham
[1:41:49] says in his
[1:41:51] prison he con constantly
[1:41:56] remembered that's where the devil gets
[1:41:59] us think about it one time we think
[1:42:02] everything's okay we go back to our
[1:42:04] default
[1:42:07] mode it happens to all of us we're going
[1:42:10] to do better
[1:42:11] now we got it now we're
[1:42:14] Victorious doesn't even take a day and
[1:42:16] we're back to our same old s what Happ
[1:42:19] we we can't control the
[1:42:22] prison
[1:42:25] oh you know who I'm talking
[1:42:29] to we can't control it we always hit
[1:42:33] default
[1:42:34] mode back to the same
[1:42:37] thing again and we get to
[1:42:39] church
[1:42:41] better church we to the same old thing
[1:42:45] you know why brother Bram says he
[1:42:48] constantly
[1:42:52] remembered Abraham says he was born for
[1:42:55] a
[1:42:56] purpose each one of us has got to
[1:42:58] believe we are born for a purpose how
[1:43:01] many believe we are born for a purpose
[1:43:04] you got to constantly remember that
[1:43:07] every
[1:43:08] day every hour every
[1:43:11] minute Satan don't take
[1:43:14] vacations we do oh we have a good time
[1:43:18] good church service how many of you have
[1:43:21] kept the victory from last Sunday
[1:43:25] how many of you have kept the victory
[1:43:26] from
[1:43:28] Wednesday Keep it going how constantly
[1:43:33] remembering I have a purpose watch this
[1:43:36] now Joseph put him side by side with
[1:43:43] Christ here's the
[1:43:45] parable it means to compare side by
[1:43:50] side Joseph was in prison
[1:43:53] the Butler and Baker were in prison
[1:43:56] too one was saved and the other
[1:44:00] lost man that's a mirror
[1:44:02] image Christ was on the cross brother
[1:44:06] Bram says that was Christ's prison
[1:44:10] house for those of you that didn't
[1:44:13] know Jesus had a prison
[1:44:16] house and his prison house brother brah
[1:44:19] says was his cross CU he couldn't move
[1:44:23] move from
[1:44:24] there that was his prison
[1:44:26] house
[1:44:29] until I'm going to say it was his prison
[1:44:32] house until his soul and his Spirit were
[1:44:37] ripped from that
[1:44:40] body and then he went down to
[1:44:44] prison and he took
[1:44:48] captivity he brings them up from the
[1:44:50] dead and he goes back up to the right
[1:44:53] hand of the
[1:44:55] father sounds like Joseph huh he was in
[1:44:58] prison but then he sat next to the he
[1:45:02] was the right hand of
[1:45:04] pharaoh and no one could come to
[1:45:09] pharaoh and no one can come to the
[1:45:12] father said no one comes to the father
[1:45:15] except through
[1:45:17] me perfect
[1:45:20] parallel perfect parable
[1:45:23] how about your
[1:45:27] life uh oh uh oh how about your
[1:45:30] life where are you
[1:45:35] at before his vision could be completely
[1:45:40] fulfilled he had to become a
[1:45:44] prisoner and then he became a
[1:45:49] ruler oh when we see the lives of these
[1:45:54] men who they they they perfectly
[1:46:00] parallel we were
[1:46:02] condemned in the chains of
[1:46:04] sin in the prison of House of
[1:46:08] Hell
[1:46:10] guilty to be destroyed
[1:46:15] forever and then somebody
[1:46:19] took
[1:46:21] Hallelujah does the cross
[1:46:23] get old to
[1:46:26] you does the blood has it lost its
[1:46:30] power the song says it will never lose
[1:46:32] its
[1:46:35] power it has to be
[1:46:38] powerful until the last
[1:46:40] one is dipped into the
[1:46:43] blood and comes out white as
[1:46:47] s this is what gets me that he would
[1:46:51] even hold back the
[1:46:54] coming until you and I got the Holy
[1:46:58] Ghost blows my mind church because when
[1:47:02] people just want to throw at the
[1:47:04] message oh brother BR missed it in
[1:47:07] 197 oh brother BR missed it about the
[1:47:09] California this and
[1:47:11] that thinking oh brother
[1:47:14] brand is that what you
[1:47:17] see then you need to go back to the
[1:47:21] Cross to know that his
[1:47:26] grace his grace was so sufficient and
[1:47:31] Powerful that he even held back his
[1:47:35] coming till you and I got
[1:47:39] ready brother Todd can you imagine he
[1:47:42] even held back his
[1:47:45] coming until Todd would come
[1:47:48] in give himself to Christ he did did
[1:47:53] that for you and
[1:47:54] I he held everything back so that we
[1:47:58] could come out of our prison
[1:48:00] house and we could re with
[1:48:03] him if that doesn't excite us still
[1:48:06] today then we should get back to the
[1:48:09] altar get a hold of the
[1:48:12] heart don't never let his
[1:48:15] blood dry up in your
[1:48:18] life rise up it can do no good for no
[1:48:22] one else
[1:48:24] this is this is where we're coming
[1:48:26] to are you with me now watch
[1:48:30] now he not only did what he
[1:48:34] did but this is tremendous to
[1:48:37] me he stripped the
[1:48:42] enemy he stripped it of its
[1:48:45] power and authority over
[1:48:48] us okay okay might not mean a whole lot
[1:48:54] sometimes in King James version it's
[1:48:55] hard to
[1:48:58] understand but I'm going to pull a
[1:49:00] brother Danny
[1:49:02] here Colossians 2 13- 15 I'm going to
[1:49:06] read this real quick and then and then
[1:49:07] I'm going to go
[1:49:08] to another
[1:49:12] version and
[1:49:14] Caleb put your name
[1:49:17] there being dead in his sins and the
[1:49:20] uncircumcision of his flesh
[1:49:26] he quickened together with
[1:49:28] him having forgiven all C's
[1:49:38] trespass blotting out the handwriting of
[1:49:42] ordinances that was against
[1:49:45] Caleb come on are you putting your name
[1:49:48] there which was contrary to
[1:49:51] me and took it out of the way nailing it
[1:49:54] to his
[1:49:56] cross and having spoiled principalities
[1:50:00] and
[1:50:04] Powers he made a show of them
[1:50:08] openly triumphing over them in
[1:50:12] it that's tremendous
[1:50:15] huh but let me read it in a different
[1:50:19] way God stripped the spiritual
[1:50:25] rulers and powers of their
[1:50:30] Authority with the cross he won the
[1:50:34] Victory and showed the
[1:50:37] world that they were
[1:50:41] powerless he publicly shamed
[1:50:45] them and made a public spectacle of
[1:50:49] them wait wait wait wait a minute where
[1:50:51] is he where is he I want you to get this
[1:50:54] okay we can't run through this you got
[1:50:56] to get this
[1:51:01] part you think God
[1:51:04] forgot the look of Adam and
[1:51:08] Eve was taken
[1:51:10] off and they were
[1:51:12] naked and they were
[1:51:16] shameful and they walked in the garden
[1:51:18] trying to hide
[1:51:20] themselves hover themselves
[1:51:23] do you think God forgot
[1:51:26] that to look into the eyes of his
[1:51:29] children the pain and the hurt and the
[1:51:33] suffering that there would be a Chasm
[1:51:36] between
[1:51:38] them but that was part of the
[1:51:43] parable but he didn't forget
[1:51:46] that now I'm going to read you a
[1:51:48] different
[1:51:50] version and I pray that you get with is
[1:51:52] good stuff are you ready you take it to
[1:51:57] yourself when you were stuck in your old
[1:52:01] sin dead
[1:52:05] life you were incapable of responding to
[1:52:11] God so God brought you
[1:52:15] alive right along with
[1:52:19] Christ think of it okay here we go now
[1:52:22] this is this is the this is the part
[1:52:24] think of it he says says all sins
[1:52:30] forgiven oh is that
[1:52:34] [Music]
[1:52:39] enough all able sins
[1:52:45] forgiven okay if that's not enough I'm
[1:52:47] going to give you another
[1:52:49] one the Slate wiped clean
[1:52:57] the old arrest warrant has been
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:02] cancelled and they have been nailed to
[1:53:05] the
[1:53:07] cross then he
[1:53:10] stripped all the spiritual
[1:53:14] tyrant in the
[1:53:16] universe of their sham
[1:53:20] Authority when he died on the
[1:53:23] cross and then he marched them
[1:53:27] naked through the streets
[1:53:31] Hallelujah can we give one to the Lord
[1:53:33] Jesus this
[1:53:35] morning wow that's what he did for you
[1:53:38] and
[1:53:40] I how did he March them
[1:53:43] naked they naked in that they have no
[1:53:46] power stri them of that they have no
[1:53:49] power anymore only the ones that you
[1:53:51] give him
[1:53:53] because you're the one that gives them
[1:53:56] clothing without your body they have no
[1:53:58] body to work
[1:54:01] through there is therefore now the Bible
[1:54:04] says zero
[1:54:07] condemnation the Slate is wiped
[1:54:10] clean come on tell your neighbor the
[1:54:12] Slate is wiped
[1:54:14] clean the old arrest warrant is
[1:54:19] cancelled there's nobody looking for you
[1:54:21] anymore
[1:54:23] there is no Authority looking for
[1:54:25] you because Christ already paid the
[1:54:29] price he made a way for you and I to
[1:54:34] come out of the of the prison
[1:54:36] house so that we could then Ascend the
[1:54:40] throne oh my my time is gone
[1:54:44] already can I just have like 10
[1:54:47] minutes oh please help me this morning I
[1:54:50] need some help what a storyline what a
[1:54:55] parable wait a minute wait a minute this
[1:54:58] is the way the story
[1:55:00] reads he took us out of the prison
[1:55:04] house we're no longer
[1:55:08] prisoners wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:55:10] wait a minute story goes
[1:55:14] on I
[1:55:16] Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[1:55:21] Christ w oh come on church I'm going to
[1:55:24] say it again we go from being a prisoner
[1:55:26] to a
[1:55:28] prisoner that doesn't sound very that
[1:55:31] brother AJ how is that I thought we were
[1:55:35] free are but we are his prisoner of
[1:55:40] love and you know what makes us
[1:55:44] prisoners is that it's not us that
[1:55:46] speaks
[1:55:48] anymore it is him that speaks through
[1:55:51] us it is no longer us that do what we
[1:55:54] do but it is Christ in you the hope of
[1:55:59] glory this is a little sermon to get us
[1:56:02] ready for
[1:56:05] Easter notice this
[1:56:08] now just just a few few minutes
[1:56:11] okay amen hear that
[1:56:15] wind he wishes
[1:56:18] huh there's another wind going on right
[1:56:21] now the wind that was on the day of
[1:56:26] Pentecost this is this is where we're at
[1:56:28] now the
[1:56:30] parable starts as a word
[1:56:35] Parable say it again it starts as a word
[1:56:40] Parable but it ends as an action
[1:56:45] Parable pares don't stay in word
[1:56:48] form true Parable becomes an action
[1:56:51] parable
[1:56:53] come on now the mechanics don't can't
[1:56:54] just stay
[1:56:56] mechanics it's got to become the
[1:56:59] Dynamics here we are now it's got to
[1:57:02] move from word
[1:57:04] Parable he knew what he had to
[1:57:07] do he knew and he reminded himself of
[1:57:10] what God's plan was for
[1:57:13] him but then the Bible says that while
[1:57:16] he was in
[1:57:18] prison the Jailer the one that was the
[1:57:20] head of the prison said the prison's
[1:57:23] yours all the prisoners are yours do
[1:57:27] whatever you want you control
[1:57:33] everything come on somebody's got to be
[1:57:35] with me this morning you got to control
[1:57:38] your prison
[1:57:39] first because in your prison or in the
[1:57:43] prison there's a lot of other people
[1:57:45] that are still
[1:57:48] prisoners and it's your duty to then
[1:57:51] take these prisoners
[1:57:53] and bring them out of
[1:57:55] prison here's what brother brandham says
[1:57:58] he said now that he's taken me
[1:58:00] out now I go from cell to
[1:58:04] cell letting the prisoners
[1:58:06] out what we do in life we let the
[1:58:09] prisoners
[1:58:11] out who who is he using
[1:58:14] today we got the word but do you have
[1:58:18] the
[1:58:18] action to take people out of prison
[1:58:23] control the prison
[1:58:24] first we've been in prison bondage of
[1:58:27] many
[1:58:30] things you feel in the blanks I can
[1:58:32] stand St for hours feeling in the blanks
[1:58:34] of your
[1:58:37] life brother BR says Don't Preach me a
[1:58:41] message live me a
[1:58:43] message and then he says Don't Preach
[1:58:45] any higher than you
[1:58:48] live you know why because we're always
[1:58:51] telling stories about somebody
[1:58:54] else yes or yes in the
[1:58:59] 1700s don't get me wrong I like good
[1:59:02] stories I love good stories but if I
[1:59:05] can't take like brother Abraham always
[1:59:07] says if I can't take that story from
[1:59:09] back there and make it alive in my day
[1:59:14] something wrong I missed it
[1:59:15] somewhere I love good stories I love the
[1:59:18] history of where how things
[1:59:21] came I love even
[1:59:23] more God does something in my
[1:59:26] life that I can have a passion about I
[1:59:30] can say he is alive this is what he's
[1:59:33] doing in my life I was lost but he found
[1:59:36] me he saved me he washed me he has
[1:59:41] perfected me he has made me ready for
[1:59:44] the
[1:59:45] Rapture now I'm bringing it to
[1:59:49] myself it's not just about a good story
[1:59:53] it's beyond
[1:59:54] that when you tell your
[1:59:57] story nobody can tell it like
[2:00:00] you you don't even know what happened in
[2:00:03] the first years of my life you don't
[2:00:07] know what happened when I was growing up
[2:00:10] you don't know what had happened in our
[2:00:12] marriage you don't know what happened in
[2:00:14] my in my
[2:00:17] childhood only you can tell the
[2:00:19] story and the passion you give with it
[2:00:23] and you know what Christ did for
[2:00:26] you brought you out of your prison
[2:00:30] house to do what put you in touch with
[2:00:34] the
[2:00:37] touchone I got to skip some of
[2:00:41] this I'm coming to a little not an end
[2:00:44] but set me up for my next
[2:00:50] one when I look at how this
[2:00:58] unfolds without a parable he spake not
[2:01:00] to
[2:01:02] them when they were alone he expounded
[2:01:05] all things to
[2:01:07] him everyone can say we have the word
[2:01:12] Parable but not everyone can
[2:01:18] manifest only the bride can as the
[2:01:21] action of
[2:01:24] par listen to
[2:01:26] this if I can't take the
[2:01:30] message and bring
[2:01:32] it to my day to my life what good is the
[2:01:40] message now if I can read the
[2:01:43] message and I find myself
[2:01:47] here
[2:01:48] oh here's the
[2:01:50] passion I can tell you about
[2:01:53] it in my day are you ready for this
[2:01:58] one this is in the message
[2:02:02] influence what we've seen
[2:02:06] happen should put every soul in
[2:02:11] action I don't know why things just
[2:02:13] don't go right you're not in
[2:02:16] action that's the
[2:02:19] answer we're in action for everything
[2:02:21] else but not the things of I don't feel
[2:02:24] called to do that brother that's okay
[2:02:26] not everybody's called to go on the
[2:02:29] mission yet everybody's called to go on
[2:02:31] the mission
[2:02:32] field because the mission field is right
[2:02:34] outside the
[2:02:35] door I'm getting something here with
[2:02:38] you what we've seen happen should put
[2:02:40] every soul
[2:02:43] in in other
[2:02:45] words it should make a
[2:02:49] church I can't look at some of
[2:02:52] church I got to look at this
[2:02:54] church it should make Cedar Hills Church
[2:02:58] of the
[2:03:01] cross that would make a
[2:03:06] Revival he's talking about he's
[2:03:08] preaching it in Phoenix Phoenix would
[2:03:10] make a Revival here in
[2:03:12] Phoenix Phoenix and I'm going to put
[2:03:15] here in Lo
[2:03:17] crues is there a revival going
[2:03:20] on
[2:03:23] oh come on church is there a revival
[2:03:25] going
[2:03:25] on where is it going on who the Revival
[2:03:30] I'm the Revival you're the
[2:03:33] Revival you got to see it in the
[2:03:36] scriptures listen listen to this because
[2:03:39] the
[2:03:40] scriptures the Holiness of the
[2:03:43] scriptures is what impregnates the
[2:03:48] parable there's a mouthful right there
[2:03:51] I'm going to say it again the Holiness
[2:03:53] of the
[2:03:54] scriptures impregnates the parable in
[2:03:58] words it causes it to
[2:04:02] produce I'm not done
[2:04:05] waitting I don't feel that
[2:04:07] Revival we get
[2:04:11] it it should put put every soul in
[2:04:15] action it should make a
[2:04:17] church that would make a
[2:04:20] Revival here in Los
[2:04:23] crues now listen I didn't I I didn't I
[2:04:27] didn't make this
[2:04:28] up this is the way the parable
[2:04:36] goes then some people get mad they think
[2:04:38] they're Revival I
[2:04:41] don't that's the attitude of people why
[2:04:44] are they all
[2:04:45] happy why don't you get
[2:04:48] happy what if we went around saying why
[2:04:50] are they all sad
[2:04:52] that's not the way to be that's a false
[2:04:56] comparison this is his
[2:04:58] word a Revival here in Los
[2:05:02] Cruses that people would be flying in
[2:05:05] from
[2:05:10] Europe I didn't say that brother Bram
[2:05:12] said
[2:05:13] that part of the
[2:05:15] parable because this
[2:05:17] weekend we'll have brother Morton from
[2:05:20] Europe flying in what's the purpose of
[2:05:24] him flying
[2:05:25] in keep on reading I want to keep on
[2:05:29] reading
[2:05:32] here sorry I got to keep on reading with
[2:05:34] something else
[2:05:37] here because they would should be flying
[2:05:39] in from
[2:05:42] Europe to
[2:05:45] see what taking
[2:05:50] place
[2:05:52] I was talking to brother Marcus couple
[2:05:54] days
[2:05:56] ago we wouldn't be where we're
[2:05:59] at if we had not come in connection with
[2:06:02] the with the team with the body there in
[2:06:05] Los
[2:06:07] crus he's excited he's got a revival
[2:06:10] going on
[2:06:11] in well they would be flying in from
[2:06:14] Europe what was taking
[2:06:17] place they say there's a place in
[2:06:19] Arizona oh New Mexico
[2:06:23] I mean the Mia
[2:06:25] Valley City I mean Los Cruses there's
[2:06:29] something broke out there listen until
[2:06:32] the seven thunders of Revelations
[2:06:36] 10 that's not even wrote in the
[2:06:40] Bible is being manifested
[2:06:45] there that is what our our founding
[2:06:48] pastor preached and preached and
[2:06:50] preached
[2:06:53] he said it's not written John was not
[2:06:55] permitted to
[2:06:58] write he said because God said he would
[2:07:00] write it with his
[2:07:03] finger in the heart of the
[2:07:05] believer that's where it's been
[2:07:08] written oh my
[2:07:11] manifested revealed is one thing
[2:07:13] manifested is
[2:07:15] another this is the great
[2:07:18] Parable here's what he says
[2:07:22] and he's quoting Isaiah
[2:07:24] 53 no beauty that desire of
[2:07:28] him he is despised and rejected of
[2:07:31] men Man of Sorrows acquainted with
[2:07:34] grief we hid as it were our faces from
[2:07:38] him he was despised and we esteemed him
[2:07:42] not surely he hath borne our
[2:07:46] griefs and carried our
[2:07:48] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[2:07:52] smitten of God and
[2:07:56] Afflicted now that's good in the time of
[2:08:00] Jesus he fulfilled that but now a
[2:08:04] prophet took it from
[2:08:07] then brought it to the Masterpiece of
[2:08:11] today oh come on now I'm GNA say it
[2:08:14] again I'm finishing now he brings it to
[2:08:16] the Masterpiece of
[2:08:18] today and he says this the word
[2:08:23] living and in
[2:08:25] action and then he says the Bible
[2:08:31] bride hello Bible Bride come on shake
[2:08:34] your neighbor's hand hello Bible
[2:08:36] bride Bible bride good to see you Bible
[2:08:40] bride oh look at what he says the Bible
[2:08:44] bride not some man-made
[2:08:48] bride the Bible bride and then watch as
[2:08:52] he goes smitten and Afflicted of God who
[2:08:56] is the Bible bride but I thought that
[2:08:59] was Jesus but today it's him in his
[2:09:03] body called the Bible
[2:09:06] bride and
[2:09:08] Afflicted of
[2:09:10] God I don't know why this is smitten and
[2:09:17] AFF no beauty that we should desire her
[2:09:23] but yet we did esteem
[2:09:26] her fitten and Afflicted of
[2:09:30] God that's right she stands
[2:09:34] alone she is SM from all the
[2:09:39] denomination to Revelations
[2:09:41] three smitten out of the lean
[2:09:46] church that she was raised up
[2:09:49] in that became a prison
[2:09:53] she was raised up in the prison
[2:09:55] house you see but now she stands
[2:10:00] alone like the
[2:10:02] bridegroom rejected of men despised and
[2:10:05] rejected of the
[2:10:07] churches the bride stands that way what
[2:10:11] is it it's his
[2:10:13] Masterpiece see it's the word that he
[2:10:16] can work
[2:10:19] through make manifest
[2:10:25] rejecting how many of you ever felt
[2:10:28] rejected all the time but that's okay
[2:10:32] that's her she just like her
[2:10:37] hubby she's just like the
[2:10:40] bridegroom the Holiness of the scripture
[2:10:43] brother will if you
[2:10:44] come stop now but but the Holiness of
[2:10:47] the scripture once
[2:10:49] again impregnates the
[2:10:53] parable wow this
[2:10:56] Holiness called us to a life of
[2:11:00] Holiness to a people of
[2:11:04] Holiness this
[2:11:06] Holiness breathes in
[2:11:12] Prophecy it thunders in the
[2:11:16] law yet it Whispers In The
[2:11:20] Promise
[2:11:22] it supplicates in the
[2:11:24] prayers it sparkles in the
[2:11:27] Poetry it resounds in the
[2:11:30] songs speaks in the types glows in the
[2:11:35] imagery voices in the
[2:11:38] language Burns in the
[2:11:40] spirit and it challenges in the

[2:25:10] Hallelujah God bless you
[2:25:13] everybody sorry I was a little confused
[2:25:15] I didn't know why I was coming up
[2:25:17] here with the pastor I was like what why
[2:25:19] am I coming up but anyhow
[2:25:22] uh I had actually asked uh this morning
[2:25:25] to give you guys a
[2:25:29] testimony on a Friday the Lord had given
[2:25:31] me a revelation that I hadn't even been
[2:25:33] aware
[2:25:37] of which I guess is what a revelation is
[2:25:40] but
[2:25:42] anyhow I had a I had written a song Last
[2:25:44] year around the time of
[2:25:48] August and it was called the end time
[2:25:55] Carol and uh as a writer you know if I'm
[2:25:58] being honest with you
[2:26:01] guys sometimes when I write things I
[2:26:03] have no idea what I'm talking
[2:26:07] about but you trust in the inspiration
[2:26:10] you see where the Lord takes
[2:26:13] it so anyhow I wrote this song and again
[2:26:15] this is August
[2:26:18] and I wanted to read you guys the lyrics
[2:26:21] because of
[2:26:24] nowhere the Lord told me to listen to
[2:26:26] the song on
[2:26:29] Friday and remember this is a Christmas
[2:26:32] song
[2:26:33] okay I'm like Christmas songs in March
[2:26:36] all
[2:26:37] [Music]
[2:26:39] right so I I listened to it and I heard
[2:26:41] these lyrics I want to just read them
[2:26:42] for
[2:26:45] you because I didn't even know what they
[2:26:49] meant when when I wrote
[2:26:51] them but I realized what they
[2:26:54] meant after the preachings that our
[2:26:57] pastors been bringing these past couple
[2:26:58] of
[2:27:01] weeks it's going to get a little
[2:27:05] Christmassy but I'm just going to read
[2:27:07] it and just listen to the
[2:27:11] words like in Pros it
[2:27:14] goes it was on that
[2:27:17] night God's lamb was sent to man
[2:27:22] in nowhere's manger deep in
