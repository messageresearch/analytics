breaking of the Dawn their lives produced a stronger faith and also brought fire and Sparks how blessed are those who have lived in faith and left us this precious mark what they were in life and their inspired spoken word will always say within our hearts their absence is but a moment of God's time that we will be a part and distance is but a step away and God's eternity yes a life well lived will always be their gift to all yes their testimony but keep in mind though their Earthly eyes are closed so their tent is but in slumber as those on the road to Emmaus we too Are Not Alone and we are not outnumbered when Christ left his dear disciples and he ascended the apostles work it then began and the angels spoke and gave the word that Christ and would in like manner come again we too

that's here those that are on hookup God bless you this morning simply want to say this morning happy Mother's Day Too can we give one to the mothers this morning amen God bless you and you know I want to give a little testimony before we get going and uh you know our founding pastor Pastor the heart that he had and uh there was a plot that he had purchased for my mother and and himself and so when when my after my mother passed away and then my grandmother passed away that would be Grandma Virgie yeah our founding pastor says I'm going to give her my spot they put my grandma Virgie right next to my mother so now we were we were looking to see well what are we going to do now and of course we had a few options and or we could have put him in Fort Baird there at the cemetery there for the for the veterans and uh but the Lord moved on brother Tommy's heart let's see if we can get that little plot right right next to to the to Mama and Grandma brother Tommy and brother Omar they they worked and talked to some of the people that they knew at the city and so we met them out there and uh we uh we were talking to two of the the men that were there yeah and then when all of a sudden a man comes he's the main the main man no he's he's our supervisor so he came in and we're talking with him and yeah they measured and see if they could do it and at the end the man says yeah we can make this work you all can buy this this plot right next to to your moms and we will praise the Lord we're looking at the man he had a name badge International numbers you know what his name was his name was Jesus I you know you you see the Lord moving in so many ways he honored his mother father he also honored his wife's mother it was his mother-in-law gave her his place and Jesus showed up and said I have a place for my servant to the Lord for those things and you know I was thinking this morning and and uh or or yesterday or what do we do for the mothers we appreciate all the Mamas and our mama we're thankful to God for the mother that he gave us what do I do Lord and I opened up this message Holy Spirit led me to this message I said wow yo just one last time let our founding Pastor preach to the mamas he happened to preach this message on Mother's Day 2001. and he entitled the message time tested memorials and just the way that it goes so perfect with this with with the event right now and the celebration that we're going to have in a couple of days for his life he talks about about what we take when we die how it came together we're grateful to the Lord get comfortable the message is not very long but after the message we have the rest of the ministers and some of the deacons continuing what we did on Wednesday yeah and we'll do that and then we have the the children have their little program for The Mamas also if you can stand for the reading of the word I want to just read the scripture that our founding Pastor he reads and then we will put the message on Amen it's Matthew the 24th chapter and the 35th verse and it reads like this when you have it you can say Amen here's some pages still going and we'll let you catch up and it reads like this Matthew 24 35 heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away the blessings to the region of his word as we introduce our founding Pastor God bless thank you foreign uh kind of speak to you and if we get to preaching will that be fine but it's time tested is I would never criticize of someone the alien take flowers to the graveyard the ivara Flores I would never criticize anyone for adorning the graves and I take it because our propheta he says this esto if you do that we appreciate that that's where I get my thoughts so in a time like Mother's Day Madre we we go maybe to the cemetery and we see the ground where they're resting wasn't too long ago we were in Texas but you know as as I looked at Russ's mother as we buried her there in Texas actually her body looked peaceful and and we hear these comments in uh in in funeral services she looks or he looks so good of course that's the body where they lived but a consolation uh to brother Ross and and the rest of the people that have their mothers have gone on consolation she lived to be a good age according to the Bible segun La Biblia if you live to be 70. you're doing all right if you live to be 80. why are you doing much better the thing about it is it seems like we fear death so much we don't want to leave now brother password was not like that right brother Bosworth and hermano Bosworth said that was the happiest time of his life he says because I'm finally going to go meet Jesus the one I've talked about all my life [Music] my wife is as we come to church while we were driving this morning she says why do we cry so much and the reason she gave that thought is because we were hearing a tape on her CD is and the tape or the song goes something like this our friend or our mother is going home so let's party let's have party time and you know it might not sound so good but in in the in the Christian walk Christiana everything is based on death burial and Resurrection everything is based on that no matter how good we treat our bodies no matter how good a medicine we have no no no matter how good doctors we have when medical we this will pass away it will pass away so we might as well get ready Fiesta Bible says it looks like I'm preaching a funeral message instead of a Mother's Day message my theme is is time-tested memorial memorial but my text is the body of Jesus El cuerpo De Jesus between the sixth and seventh Dimensions Memorial keep that in mind maybe you can catch the meaning of time tested memories Paul said Pablo dijo camos case like those that have no hope Esperanza we were coming from somewhere is my wife it's been hard for her the loss of her mama and her and sister and uh we heard some sobbing like little subbing and I I asked Jamie Jamie you're thinking about your mom again she said I can get her on my mind and uh brother was I I I told him why Unity had put it in sorrow and brought together this real politely he said these words he said sister Jamie but in Spanish thank God that you had a mother Madre that race thank God for that that delegation because porque a mother to love me I was raised by my aunt and uncle they were very hard with me they I would come home he would beat me up and for supper he put it he would give me a piece of bread and he would give me a cup of coffee then he made me work and I would cry when I went to school I had torn trousers pantalones rotos I sometimes was dirty and I would see other children their mothers would hug them and kiss them as they went into the schools she said so sister Jamie Jamie there's separation that there are memories that linger with us they just stay with us memories something that we have in our Spirits Memorial it is God is Bueno to send our children to school that's very good commandable is foreign to give our children as heritage is to show them as the most starless that there is a Jesus Jesus that loves us I I remember being in the Navy I passed through a few rough spots and uh I I would always when I was in danger I could hear my mother's voice first the kingdom of God and it's righteous and all these other things shall be added and you know that that gave me strength I believe I I passed through a lot of things and I and I made it because of the prayers of my mother so I hope that and in memory the sweet things but actually I can't say nothing better about my mama I can't find a foreign [Applause] yes now when a person Persona I hope you catch my first part so you guess when I give you that chunk of Eagle food is when when when we die you say we can put on a nice suit well we can but the morticians we we take to mamos maybe our Rings maybe they'll put a wrist watch on our hands and we say well he was buried in a nice garments that will Decay is you can buy the best coffin there is foreign that when we die we really don't take nothing with us you are not born with this character this character is a victory Este character is UNA Victoria it's something that you earn is [Music] something that that's yours is if you want to read it in the Bible says that the bride had made herself ready her dress is character it's what she has put on she has been taught how to talk how to behave how to be a lady that's why she is that's why the Bible says the bride has made herself ready character character character is a beautiful thing character in a person character en una Persona is you say you have characters you say you have faith well if you have faith then show me your words because your words show your characters [Music] me Fair amen amen you cannot have faith without having words if you have faces without words it's better than a door hallelujah hallelujah no matter how much a person testifies whatever you say well there has nothing is tell what you are this is tells what you are inside this is you cannot hide it from anywhere what you do okay oh what you doing that's your character in other words that's your identity identifies identity I didn't say that it comes with it I I I'm very particular in my words okay so and he's the best I got on this but one I I want you to watch the word and the sequence the things we do assemos remember one thing recorded una Cosa a lot of people don't understand the mark of the beast or the Seal of God in the forehead and in the hand yeah is what we do is what we think is that's why it's got a mark and what we think and in the hands in what we do okay we do it's looking assembles we do local assembles what we do lucky assembos so if we think one thing and we do another we don't have the mind of Christ lamented the wind of Christ and we do yeah character all right the things we do the words we say Las palabras que de simos how you treat your neighbor what you do about Christ chaos is the crystal will be vaser and everlasting Memorial the way you treat La Manera let me let me tell you a little thing here a lot of people offend much a lot of people speak evil of other people and they never make it right that thing will catch up with them you get from under the protection of the blood protection and the only way to bring it under the blood again is to confess or else for forgiveness of what you have done or offended a person is the other day a man called me sometimes when you try to do good try to help a person seems like a lot of people take advantage of it I try to help this person sell some stuff well I myself don't sell I had somebody's self with him he we sent it back to him through Federal Express for for Federal Express well he never got it so we put a claim to Federal Express because we insured it but the man insisted that I pay him that I was responsible I said sir I know I'm responsible but this and this other you you caladron [Music] yeah from South America I said I told him I did not wish to speak to him anymore the next day I was still heard I didn't I I we talked again on the phone well it was when we hung up my head hurt me because I had terrible headaches and I said Lord why are they that way and I could not feel the lord inside of me and then through the me it was silent it is you I said Lord he offended me it may offend you I still didn't hear the Lord I said Lord I feel bad then I heard the Lord and tell him you're sorry and I almost told the Lord is needless to say that's my character this was me character I did what he said I did that my headache left me the Lord I'm telling you the truth is many times the headache is not a headache it's only a warning something's wrong we could speak on that but I I say that because the Lord Porque el Senor will give us he gives us things and he's trying to form the characters the Lord to form our characters to form a character many times you hear people I hear people come to me say Pastor pray for me and sometimes I want to pray and sometimes I don't want to pray well people say well as a preacher you should always pray for the people yeah what Bible do you read usted but you don't read the same Bible I read prophet of God says if God has a curse on someone and take it away God will call that or put that on you stand watch it baby people not old people but a lot of people are a bunch of babies something goes wrong in their lives and right away they blame God right amen yes that's right they say well I don't know why things aren't going right [Music] do you know that God loves to trials and when God sees you and you're a certain mold a certain way God sees that part in you and he permits a trial that will come to take that bad part out of you and you call that bass oh that's better than gold in you but see we don't see those things because we're supposed to be taken to heaven in a bed of roses everything's gotta be all right the church itself the church Iglesia and I'm speaking about the church Iglesia a lot of world needs worldliness comes in the Bible says that worldly things cannot come in there but in the church world it's it's become materialistic material good Furniture foreign [Applause] it's not wrong to have a good home I have as good a home as anybody talk about cars I got as good a cars as anybody buenos vehicles it lets you live that's comfortable but the focus is in something and algo that has been tested it's been tested for 2 000 years that Hollywood takes a fable in Hollywood and makes it look real it was that preachers take the word of God we were in a funeral here in Cedar Hills I can't Cedar Hills and it was a beautiful funeral and some people as they went out of the church they said those people preach and sing like they believe what they're doing absolutely absolutely it's been tested through the time and we believe it has outdone anything we believe it's been proven that Jesus Christ he died amen amen people don't see Jesus Jesus some people believe that he's going to show that I believe it but I want you to I want to be a witness and I want you to know how come I believe I don't believe orange juice scars secretary says the punch line of time tested Memorial just a few moments Prophet speaks about a bridge they wanted to build over a river but they they found out that the bottom of the creek was nothing but quick sentence so they said that it's impossible to build a bridge but they needed that bridge so they they call for a man from England to build this bridge is and he came and they asked him can you build a bridge here I believe so but I have to test a lot of things that quicksand Isa goes so far down but there has to be a foundation somewhere down there of solid rock the the Tierra film so he ordered for big pumps to come and pump this quicksand out of the riverbed and he was sure and they inspected that it was Solid Rock that's where they put their big old bowls and things and and and the story is long but let me just listen just give you a little bit on it he build the bridge and as he said Los criticos dijeron that get in one stand okay that's what they said they were wrong everybody showed up for the great ceremony to see if that person would cross that bridge they they said it won't hold he don't know well he put the train and he said I'll cross it first and he went yeah [Applause] come on over Jesus when he was here he said there's a place you know it is a bridge that's a bridge he said there is a place prepared I'm or I'm going to prepare a place or I'm going to prepare the bridge and where I am foreign punchline La Costa principality there was a parade Augustus Caesar says amen yes he's fine officers passed by him they have their their shiny calves with their plume and and sword shiny swords we just shake his hand and he hit one after another pass by him all of a sudden there was a foot soldier he was walking he couldn't hardly salute garment was ripped he was dirty he was walking he passed by Caesar he kind of saluted him how in the world was your garment horns those cars that are in your face where did you get them from serving my Lord Caesar Cesar Caesar says she's the pride of Jesus Christ associated let's all stand together and give another one to the Lord Jesus Christ we can do a little bit better than that this morning since Jesus came into my life since Jesus came into my heart what a wonderful change [Music] since Jesus came into [Music] all things Jesus [Music] I'm okay [Music] your voice [Music] why am I in my life and run since Jesus amen [Music] please foreign [Music] [Music] why [Music] why did everybody said Jesus came into my heart [Music] brother Ron are you ready yes Jesus amen always foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I'd like to read here from uh a text message that was sent to me it's sent to our pastor and then Pastor and then he wanted me to read this for you um he says I just wanted to express a few thoughts on the passing of your dad this is from Brother Jim Matthew Jim Matthew my thoughts go back to myself cruising along as a senior in college I thought I had everything I needed to have a successful life successful family and a successful career exitosa I had all the training education education and examples in my life to have what would have been considered a great life in this world God interrupted my life and showed me that even though I had all these things to rely on moving forward really moving forward I did not have the main thing principal and he gave me the opportunity to have a Christian Life Christiana to hear the message brought by the 20th century prophets to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to strive to obtain the new birth and to have a pastor that was a pastor in every sense of the word what a rock solid foundation he gave me I remember one one service when he was about to open I remember one service when he was preaching it felt like another dimension was about to open he says I remember and appreciate the many times I had a chance to spend time with my pastor yeah I consider knowing your dad one of the greatest blessings and privileges of my life I should have done better for him better for God but through my many failings I am still enduring uh condolences are for those suffering sorrow um to me this is the graduation that your dad strive for all his life I cannot express condolences at a graduation like this I have a feeling of contentment knowing that your dad is free from the from this past house he fulfilled his part in the Christian drama of God his legacy continues through everyone that he reached I believe that even greater and he has in parentheses more words um Ras will be done for the kingdom of God after his passing is hey man for me it was one of the one of my greatest privileges in being able to sit under him um please forgive me okay I'm gonna try to keep it together you know there's a movie called 300 uh and when the King was killed he was about to die yeah and some of his men were were dying also along his side the servant tells him he says it's an honor to die at your side and the King responded and he said it was an honor to have lived at yours to you and I can say with all of my heart it was an honor to have it at his side forgive me I'm trying not to be a baby here okay well done this really it it hits me hard because as a young man I didn't have an example of a father of that was a minister as Jerry said Jerry you know and we were talking tom me Jerry and my mom were talking yo Jeremy mama and he says oh man so many things to say Where Do We Begin and as they said hombre and uh I remember it was it was after his it was after a Wednesday service it was his birthday my mom says me and Jerry were there we hadn't started helping out in the church or anything like listen now and my mom says oh look today's brother Tommy's birthday I remember Jerry we used to wear the chains so now the chain that he had on the Chain was his uh standing right next to him for your birthday he looks at it he says what is this is oh it's a chain oh thank you gracias now for me for me that's where the story began and I say that for this reason because that pendant that was on there we heard a while ago that he was in the Navy now now that Panda was an anchor and that anchor had a ship's wheel on it never in my life have I ever seen a man speak with such Authority many times that we would eat breakfast every time we eat lunch together and that Authority just wasn't from behind the pope yes many times that we'd be there at different restaurants you were there we were crying like babies the waitress would come and look at us two men with tears coming down their eyes why me so little time so much to say and so little time and I just wanted to say this as I said at the beginning for me but I mean it was a privilege for the kids I know he was your father in the natural but that was my spiritual father is seeing that my where my anchor would be cast man thank you Elizabeth amen God bless you this morning as I was driving to church I was thinking I wanted to read a scripture that would maybe remember I could remember brother Tommy or Pastor I know and there wasn't a scripture that stood out to me more than this Hebrews 11. the chapter of the faith Eva there's not a chapter that speaks of a living faith like in this chapter we have many memories many memories that that have out that were outstanding to us Maybe they are Earthly and one of these days they might erase there's an impression is an impression that anchors me and it's Eternal it's the faith that he had it's always that made a great impression in my life [Music] I remember one time when he was just finished preaching the service oh how we know our brother Tommy was in the Navy yes he would always mention things of the of the sea and of ships one time he mentioned of a ship a ship of no matter how big it is how strong it is how good it looks it wasn't made to be in court and after that a message he called me to his office yeah the correct straightened me out so I got there yes he knew that I had just barely finished buying a house and he asked me how would you like to move to Las Cruces and I told him sure wherever you send me would you like to go there and move to Las Cruces and help brother Caleb I said yes of course I will not only that is casa and he said what about your house and I told him well I'll give the house back to the bank I went back to the bank and I told the bank I know it was hard for me to get this house we took months to finalize it I said here here's the keys to this house I'm gonna move to Las Cruces and the banker told me why what's going on I knew he would not understand my conviction I have something to do in Las Cruces brother Tommy hat we have here the sanctuary where we can gather together and we are here with you thank you may God bless you brother your name is Emilio Perez my name is Emilio Perez my son just stepped down you know this is a mystery um a mystery that has been coming and

in 2005 2006. okay I look at my wife over there so we went to uh we started at the hotel and down the street it was like people like seven minutes walking to the church service so after you finish preaching I we got him a taxi at this position tax so whenever you could get in the car and go back to the hotel room it was crowded with a lot of people so we got them in the taxi taxi so after that picture you know he's he's not all there is so I was behind the crowd just trying to get the people they could get in the car is so I was behind a lot of people me and my wife just right quick and as he got in the car hey you looked her ankles you were looking for something so he whispered to somebody so that's when that person caught my looked at me that caught my attention where were you I was waiting for you well this was for you by the time so you could take you and your wife to the hotel yes [Music] there are so many brothers how would he notice that uh I'm not going to leave this car I'm not going to tell the taxi right to leave until you get in the car now I just want to thank the Lord for that because he had me in mind so he just shows that he hasn't forgotten us still there with us it's a continuation I want to let the devil know we're not going nowhere we're standing stronger more than ever just right quick um there is a priest Services what did you like about this hey brother this is what impacted me the most about Billy Branham that's what he said she made me love Jesus Christ you make us love Jesus Christ We're not gonna say goodbye but we're going to say till we meet again thank you I bless you foreign La Gente cibility I can see how the people perceive how he could bring Jesus on the scene is God using his servant and we're free the servant um we're trying to protect them for the people our crowds because they were coming in massive because there were hundreds of people just trying to get to him marvelous meetings um a Silver City when we just got to Silver City our first time we want to go see the house our brothers [Music] I didn't have no money I had nothing amazing would you like to have a house I was just in the process of immigration to get my papers where do you want it Becca over here yes that was my first home one night he came to my house at 10 o'clock at night you asked me I'm trying to move the headquarters to Las Cruces what do you think about that wherever you go I will follow you that same place and the study on the style where he's at we're going to be there okay he's in Heavenly places in Silver City I had to take our time to be over here because I have to wait till the Christmas clothes in Silver City it's time I close the doors for the grace of God we are here you believe in me foreign [Applause] I bless each and every one of you I want to thank my pastor foreign I'm sorry for getting emotional but I'm not no but uh as I started to try to think of what to share there's so many memories he was uh he was my uncle and uh for some reason he he loved me and uh Deacon here I'm a deacon here I was ordained by God by by our Apostle Paul um and there's a old Indian saying I will not um that it would say too many chiefs Indians which will have a noise and as you look at that that that's a saying that there's no water here it's a saying that holds no water here because we all knew who are who our chief was and it was a privilege for me to serve as uh one of the many many faithful Indians here as I started to think of a story to tell or or something to share the only the only story I could remember because my uncle he loved he loved to go hunting and one year God blessed us to where we can all go together and uh I had a I had killed my dear early um thanks to brother Caleb he uh shot this deer out of the mountain and chased him right to me now but uh so I had killed my dear early and my family went out and so I started to help the other brothers to go out and try to find the deers and the reason why I chose this story because it displayed the character of of our pastors this is what he was to me and so I was getting ready to leave with this other brother and um I said yes sir I sure will he's in New York so we we went out I didn't have a rifle or nothing and this certain brother lo and behold run into a nice little buck so I said brother give me your rifle so I could so I could kill it for for the chief he goes no bro let's let's let him get bigger I was like bro bro I need to kill that deer for the chief and uh he's like no let's let him get bigger he was a little bit older than me you know I was like all right Bueno I guess so we get back to Campo and I knew you didn't know the chief I knew he was going to be looking for me so I was like like a tail my tail between my legs trying to not be where he was at you know sure enough come over here so I go and he says hey did you see anything I said I'm so sorry Uncle I I did see one I'm not gonna lie to you I said but I I didn't have my rifle and I asked the brother to you know how many pastors do you have man he he you know you know if you know if you've been there before you know how the chief he would he would hello um I took it you know and and so here I am building and he says uh he says hey come over here I got something for you so we're going to his uh he had a RV at that time he just starts talking to me like like nothing just happened Cooks me this big old steak and that's how he was yeah he didn't hold anything anything like that and uh everything he did he did for his people you know um there's a there's a saying he would always use he would say don't wait for somebody to die tomorrow my whole life all I've ever seen him do is give roses and uh Jefe for the last time on this Earth these are my roses to give to you I love you yeah wow what an awesome man what an awesome Pastor that we have founding Pastor what a very great man and everybody knows that I have the privilege and honor to be called his grandson Nieto [Music] and what a love a lot of love he showed me for whatever reason I just love to sing to the Lord ever since I was a young little kid and I think I was mainly just more loud than any good the uh yes but my grandfather would always encourage me to sing and when I was uh I think I was probably 11 or 12 and they put me up to song Lead after church and I remember going to uh to Lotaburger with him a Lotaburger in the family we always like going there and he would just say mijo just just give the Lord all your heart just don't ever be afraid of that so just open your heart and I would say Okay Grandpa yeah okay okay so yeah yeah and the more and more as you grow up he would keep telling me that and about the time they they he moved over here I I just knew for some reason I just had to be here with him and so as I was talking to my parents of what we're going to do after graduation what are you going to do with your life I just said I would surely love to be with my grandfather and as I told him that so why he welcomed me with open arms and he made a room in his house for me and also many great times that I've had with him and maybe some new foods that I learned to eat because one time he said we're gonna have tacos I'm not gonna say in Spanish I'm gonna mess it up um with the the cheek of the sheep and I said okay cool and so I said okay where's the where's the dinner at I think oh okay and he said well you see the head of sheep right there they say oh but I bet like just grab yourself a tortilla tortilla and help yourself it's right there and I'm like oh man even the eyeball was looking at me yeah okay wow what an awesome man my grandfather is and just how you just it just impacted me so much that he'd always encourage you to give your bestie and the potential that he always saw on you know even when you didn't see it in yourself and he would encourage you just keep giving your best to the Lord even when I get so nervous to sing and he at one point would say you gotta sing with some fire yeah but I think I started understanding as you grow up when you do give your heart to the Lord you're not scared of anybody you're just in fear for the Lord and you want to give the very best that you can because the lord gave us the very on us he didn't hold back on us he didn't hold out on us he gave us the very best founding Pastor yeah he gave us the very best pastor very best Ministry ministerial and the very best people that we could serve I just want to thank the Lord allowing me to be in his life to be one of his servants I thank the Lord very much every day for him I just want to tell you grandpa is sure do love you with all my heart and we'll see you very soon God bless you [Applause] amen God bless each and every one of you I always I'm sure glad brother Abraham came up before me oh yes all right because every time he's going to speak I see tears in his future and so I'm gonna try to stay away from that but in a ways uh it's it's a privilege um I wanna I didn't know what to say because there's so many things to say but probably back in about 1978 um was looking for the Lord and he had met a man else and he had gone to church with the apostolic church apostolica and there he met Brothers Well through that he ended up going to a message there in Grant County Grand County and uh one day they were going to have a guest Minister special and um my dad had been at work and he had been seeking the Lord yes and the Lord he had a vision and the Lord told him turn and as he turned a look and he saw a man in a white suit well that's Sunday ese Domingo the guest minister is and he said I heard that man one time well he ended up going to church and I thank God I thank God for my mother because I don't know how long my dad would help but because of her we're still here today and I remember I remember when I was about six years old my dad said he said Danny medical Danny I saw it you're gonna be brother Tommy song reader said I never forgot that so in my life I ended up I ended up going astray a little bit Yeah if we uh well one day as you've heard the testimony at a youth service the Lord changed my heart and I remember when I was 17 years and I started I was so scared and I started singing and I looked to the back of the church yeah he was in the back with just I would end up for over 13 years and I can only remember maybe one time that he ever asked me to sing another song [Music] and it was they come from the East and West well and so I can't go without saying this is you say what do you mean by that okay he went and got my wife permission to marry me yeah he went and did I told him brother Tommy Tomas I want to marry Charlotte he said okay okay have you talked to her parents he said okay call me he said I don't know what they're coming foreign first of all I won't be here and I just want to thank the Lord for him I remember when I was first gonna preach I didn't know I was going to pray he just said one day where him and I had gone for a ride to the black range right and he said you're a good driver it is a and so lastly yesterday I was going home and I was listening to a message of his and he was talking about the uh that did me and so he was talking about how the blood was sprinkled on that bird yes and as I was driving there was a bird on the road that's right no it wasn't dead and so I turned around and I got out and I let me pick it up and so it was kind of wounded and so I took it home and Leona started researching uh how the doctor wounded had a doctor wounded um and it said for many but and this is what came up it said for many bird lovers the sign of a cardinal holds special meaning they say that the vibrant red bird is an uplifting happy sign that those who have lost who we have lost will live forever so long as we keep them in our memory keep their memory alive was driving right there brother Tommy began to sing this let's see if I can get it going here here foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] this is [Music] universe [Music] energy [Music] bye everybody [Music] [Music] exactly what was playing at that momento so I don't think it was a coincidence God bless you this morning [Applause] good afternoon God bless you in 2006 someone asked me significance brother Tommy mean to you I looked in his eyes and I said I said brother since that time my life has changed a H I remember one time my brother Tommy was preaching to me what do you see when you look at the cross and I wanted to put a little bit of drama to itself what a horrible hard day Tommy said Diego Diego you're airing there you know how he is because I'm saying through the cross I can see what he's made of me since that time I knew he was a different man Durant I was a soldier I was in a military service for 16 years and I know a man when he has Authority when he spoke in I said with all respect can I share something with you he said sure yo share with me I said brother Tommy I'm a military man I want you to be my general can I call you my general he heard me said sure I will be your general I'm remember months later brother Tommy was preaching on a Sunday it is because I am I am his general you know how to give you courage and went to a restaurant we were just barely gotten here to the states I had a lot of respect for everyone and I always have it and everyone began to sit in the tables around us I told my wife let's sit over here in the corner nobody else is over here in the corner he is implementation he says my heartbeat started to go up real fast always my heart is I've never known a man with such a Supernatural Ministry like brother Tommy has one time when we were speaking outside of the church when he sees my wife from a distance as I was speaking to my general he was looking at my wife that was standing far off I don't know what's going on and I keep speaking I had 10 years that we had we hadn't had any children and tell your wife sister you see her pregnant and I see her carrying a little boy yes 10 years later there he is you know how he would speak Diego Diego I don't understand how the pastors or the ministers they're scared of the gifts I am not scared because I prove that they're right and if they're wrong a few days before my general went home I was there with him I said my general it was a pleasure to serve you yeah and as I served you General my general I'm going to instruct in the life and your son Kayla Perez thank you God bless you before I start here I should like to tell the mothers Happy Mother's Day okay I have the privilege to have my mother here with me so I have my mother have my wife I have my my sister my mother-in-law [Music] so uh there's four mothers that some way someone I'm related to yeah foreign uh I got memories since since I was a kid um when it was just him before there was a group of people over ring of protection it was just him the first time I gonna have memories of him as a kid I was very very afraid of him because of the gift how he will preach and how he how he will how the Lord will use him and not just me I mean I remember in one of the services as a kid I'm looking how the Lord is using this man just one of the occasions this lady comes up to be prayed foreign so then he says sister you need to confess that to your husbands if you want your healing and then he looks in the audience yeah no I know for a fact he didn't know these people and and then he looks and then out of the other he said you brother you're the husband and then calls and then he said she's sick and because of an issue that led that in it so she needs to confess something but she can't do it until you confess something because you're the one that caused this so there was no way around it they confessed to each other that was into the church but you could see that but because of the fear that the Lord will call out the sin foreign I was afraid of the man until I met him that changed um to see the Lord at a greater level um they work with my father okay it was before there was anybody else um was very impactful very impactful as a kid I witnessed ego how him and my father became such good friends and I never seen friendships like that I know my dad I grew up with him and uh I know the type of person he is later on later on in life I got you um meet brother Tommy and live with him and it's impossible you could get two people of those of those characters that could ever really be friends totally opposite in so many ways we have nowadays in the even in the message forget about the nominations but the message discrepancy and separation they can brother brotherly uh disagree on something well we're talking about my dad they could yeah I remember we were living in in Silver City in Grandview yeah and in one of their many meetings as they're just talking to each other some subjects that I don't even remember and if I wish I wish I would have been so dumb you know be able to write down a lot of that yeah so many things they even spoke of this day but in some of this there was there was arguments between them argument yeah there was arguments they have the differences [Music] foreign foreign um much more we could say um there's certain sadness but he said when this day comes he said rejoice and be glad you know people in the world don't have what we have here we are in our day our children are growing up some are having children babies are starting to deal with with Life coming to that middle age or parents or Elders are dealing with mortality and uh but we all have a promise and that promise it just does not change is promise of restoration just that much more greater now the Lord permitted me to live with him the fellowship of his sufferings and what much was learned through there times that I feel very contrary I will talk to him about it expecting you know some some you know help me out I feel contrary to a lot of things but then he will straight me out if I was off um you know as some of our fellowship you know fellowship with brother tell me it was around food definitely and we had uh with William and William um some of the greatest breakfast a person between midnight and three in the morning eating pork chops and green chilies content so there we are all in our underwear eating Green Chile and he's preaching to us so we had a great time his last words we went to see him I asked him what hurts and then he said truly nothing said you okay brother then he said yeah all is well she's last words I heard from him what a blessing it is thank the Lord for his life for his for his many many uh testimonies and guidance testimonials but more than words it was just the action that always follow behind us we know that what he said in that message that we heard earlier it's true and when he needed to apologize as far as family goes uh brother Tommy brother Caleb brother William sister Jacqueline Noni exactly you know the scripture says to be mindful of the fatherless it's make your religion true and undefiled it is and it's scriptural yes [Applause] amen at the cross at the cross we thank all these men

[Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] ER is so great you know the first one that receives you is this life is your mother no one can touch it because you're conceived and she Bears you under her heart and she is the first to know you and the first two in this life tooth to hold you then when you're born she is a one of the first hands that touch and wipes back to tears out of your eyes she's the first one to patch you to love you and to coo over you in this life is your mother now I think that there is not enough honor that we could give to a mother mother is a first with the child and she's a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has the responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road now I think that's why mothers has a special little touch you see a child listens to its mother some little touch about that mother that a child will listen to when it's hurt it'll go to the mother for consolation before it will go to the father because she was first with it you know and there's some gift that God gives the mother to be that way I mean a real mother I believe that mothers are honorable and godly but I believe such as mother days like this is a racket make a lot of money out of Flowers and Things but Mother's Day should be every day not to send her a bunch of flowers on Mother's Day but the lover and care for our 365 days and nights through the year don't make Mother's Day a once in a year vocation okay love your mothers visit them as much as you can see them be good to them and do as the scripture says honor thy father and thy mother thank you very much Esau Theory met his mother and his father and keep my Sabbath and the Lord your God Leviticus 19
