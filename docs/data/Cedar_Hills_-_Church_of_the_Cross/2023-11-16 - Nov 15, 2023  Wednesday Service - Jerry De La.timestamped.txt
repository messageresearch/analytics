[45:59] it turned on and the blower worked
[46:01] beautifully

[48:38] Bertha so it doesn't matter the
[48:42] situation whatever we
[48:44] need if we believe in our
[48:47] heart and we pray unto God
[48:51] believing anything is
[48:53] possible amen amen just just a a thought
[48:58] I have
[48:59] [Music]
[49:00] here you know I I I I was thinking the
[49:04] the other
[49:06] day and you know we we we have a journey
[49:08] that we're
[49:11] on you know and and and and our walk
[49:13] with God it's not an easy
[49:17] one as you could say you could probably
[49:19] say it's not a walk in the
[49:23] park you know but but I but but I was
[49:27] thinking and this is just me
[49:30] myself you know every time I I I I I I
[49:35] get up here and I
[49:38] Minister the first word that come out of
[49:41] my
[49:42] mouth is I'm not
[49:46] worthy and and of course I understand
[49:48] how I'm saying
[49:51] it because it's God that has made me
[49:54] Worthy
[49:56] but when I say I'm not
[49:58] worthy then the devil can hear
[50:02] me so so I get up here and I say I'm not
[50:07] worthy and we all know who the Devil Is
[50:11] Right are we know what Satan
[50:15] means Satan means the
[50:18] accuser so so he's going to accuse us
[50:21] any way he
[50:24] can you know so so I I I myself giving
[50:29] him
[50:31] ammunition to use against
[50:34] me by saying I am
[50:37] unworthy but but I am
[50:40] worthy and you are worthy you are worthy
[50:43] of every promise that God has that
[50:45] promised to
[50:48] you but that's where Satan comes in he
[50:50] he uses three things against
[50:54] us
[50:56] one is
[50:58] deception one he likes to
[51:03] accuse and then the third he lik it's
[51:08] condemnation so so as we see in the
[51:10] beginning as far as
[51:14] deception from the very
[51:18] beginning In the Garden of Eden he used
[51:23] deception and he told her no you will
[51:25] not
[51:27] die so it started there but we know
[51:31] Satan is a
[51:33] liar he's a he's a
[51:36] deceiver and he's a
[51:39] murderer yes he's a murderer but he's
[51:43] trying to kill us and kill me every
[51:45] single
[51:48] day by trying to say I am not
[51:52] worthy by trying to say you are not
[51:55] worthy
[51:57] trying to say look at what you've
[52:00] done you've done this and this and
[52:03] this you've done
[52:05] this but it doesn't stop
[52:08] there because there's an
[52:11] accusation but there's always there's
[52:13] always another side to
[52:18] it it's like when you go to to to
[52:22] trial and you have the the the one side
[52:25] I gu you could say would be a the
[52:29] state if you committed a
[52:32] crime and then say I I would be like a
[52:35] defendant and and they have to
[52:39] prove every accusation against
[52:43] you so my accusation is I'm a
[52:48] sinner okay I'm an
[52:50] unbeliever I've been accused of
[52:52] this but we have an intercessor
[52:57] we have an intercessor that will step
[53:01] in and he says you know
[53:04] what you've accused him of this this and
[53:08] that but I forgave
[53:11] him my blood covers
[53:18] that he he wants to accuse us every
[53:21] single
[53:24] day
[53:27] the the the the the the the journey I
[53:31] said are actually it's rather a
[53:35] battle right we we we battle every
[53:39] single
[53:41] day because the enemy we
[53:46] face he's a fierce
[53:50] enemy he he's
[53:52] Fierce he he keeps on
[53:58] and he's trying to
[54:00] find and find
[54:03] ways to
[54:05] steal and
[54:08] destroy God's plan for you and
[54:13] I he he he he's trying to keep us from
[54:18] it but one day there was a
[54:22] man called Jesus
[54:25] and he went on that
[54:27] cross and he died on that
[54:30] cross and he
[54:32] covered
[54:34] blood came down to each and every one of
[54:37] us it covered our
[54:39] sins and it and and it kept
[54:42] us but that still doesn't stop the
[54:48] devil he wants to as brother Jerry
[54:51] said Jerry he wants to put fear in US
[54:57] that's one of his greatest
[55:00] weapons is to put fear in you and
[55:03] I you know because because I I was
[55:06] reading
[55:10] something or I I I came across this let
[55:13] me see if I could find
[55:20] it but it it it was kind of it was like
[55:23] a a riddle
[55:34] anyway I I I believe I can remember it
[55:36] but but anyway in this
[55:38] riddle it started off that a
[55:42] man left
[55:44] home or ran from
[55:47] home and he walked a little
[55:50] bit and then he went to the
[55:54] left and then he he ran from home a
[55:56] little bit again kept
[55:59] running he ran a little bit more and
[56:02] then he turned
[56:04] left and then he ran a little bit
[56:07] more and then he turned
[56:09] left okay the question is asked is is
[56:12] why did he run from
[56:17] home I'll ask you that why did he why
[56:19] was he running from
[56:23] home the the first thing we want to
[56:26] think
[56:28] of is that there's some crazy guy at
[56:30] home trying to to do something to us
[56:35] right because that's what the devil
[56:37] wants to do he wants to to he wants our
[56:39] imaginations to run
[56:44] wild he he he wants us to think the
[56:48] worst he wants us to think that oh this
[56:51] is really
[56:53] horrible but then the guy he as as he's
[56:56] talking to the
[56:58] people and he says well think of it as
[57:03] baseball he ran from
[57:05] home he ran to first he ran to second he
[57:10] ran to third he ran
[57:13] home and the two masked men waiting for
[57:16] him were the capture in the
[57:22] Empire so there was nothing wrong
[57:26] but right away the devil wants to put
[57:27] thoughts that that oh my gosh the the
[57:29] worst of the worst is going to
[57:34] happen like I said Jesus died on the
[57:38] cross he died for you and
[57:40] I we don't need to think those
[57:43] thoughts because in this battle that's
[57:46] that's where it is right
[57:48] here but if we have him in our
[57:51] heart if we have the love of Jesus in
[57:54] our heart
[57:56] can push all those thoughts
[58:00] aside but we got to fill up with
[58:04] something we just can't fill up with
[58:08] anything we can't fight the devil with
[58:10] just
[58:13] anything but we got to fight him with
[58:15] the word of
[58:17] God we got to come at him with the word
[58:19] of
[58:21] God I cannot fight him
[58:25] sitting
[58:27] down hearing music all day
[58:34] long I cannot fight
[58:37] him sitting down
[58:40] watching things we shouldn't be
[58:44] watching I cannot fight
[58:47] him when I have a conversation with
[58:51] somebody and I'm using words that I
[58:53] shouldn't be using
[58:56] because that's what he
[58:58] wants you know we we we we we need to be
[59:01] a separate
[59:03] people we live in this
[59:06] world we have to deal with the world but
[59:09] we cannot act like the
[59:12] world we got to carry ourselves
[59:17] different to act better and and and and
[59:20] keep your nose in the air
[59:23] no but we are children of
[59:26] God the question
[59:29] comes then what think ye of
[59:32] Christ what think you of
[59:34] Christ what think what do I think of
[59:37] Christ if I'm out
[59:40] there talking like I'm not supposed
[59:43] to listening to things I'm not supposed
[59:47] to doing the things I'm not supposed
[59:51] to acting like I'm not supposed to
[59:55] then how am I going to turn
[59:59] somebody that knows I'm a
[1:00:03] Christian how am I going to go back and
[1:00:05] testify to that
[1:00:09] person we can't be the
[1:00:12] same we got to be
[1:00:14] different we got to have the love of God
[1:00:16] in our
[1:00:18] lives we got to have the word in our
[1:00:22] heart amen
[1:00:28] in
[1:00:29] Romans
[1:00:32] R 34
[1:00:36] 33 and it says
[1:00:39] here who shall aay lay anything to the
[1:00:43] charge of God's
[1:00:49] elect it is God that
[1:00:53] justifies who is he that
[1:00:57] condemneth it is Christ that
[1:01:00] died yay rather that he is risen
[1:01:05] again who is even at the right hand of
[1:01:09] God who also maketh intercession for
[1:01:15] us who is at the right hand of
[1:01:18] God but if you read in
[1:01:22] Zechariah 31
[1:01:25] who's at the right hand right
[1:01:35] there and he said and he showed me
[1:01:39] Joshua the high priest standing before
[1:01:42] the angel of the Lord and Satan standing
[1:01:45] at his right hand to resist
[1:01:53] him
[1:01:57] so Satan's there every step of the way
[1:02:01] also and the Lord said unto
[1:02:04] Satan the Lord rebuke thee Oh
[1:02:08] Satan even the Lord that had chosen
[1:02:11] Jerusalem rebuke rebuke
[1:02:16] thee it is not this a brand plucked is
[1:02:19] not this a brand plucked out of the
[1:02:23] fire
[1:02:26] now Joshua was clothed with filthy
[1:02:28] garments and stood before the
[1:02:35] angel and he answered and spake unto
[1:02:38] those that stood before him
[1:02:44] saying take away the filthy garments
[1:02:47] from
[1:02:49] him and unto him he said
[1:02:53] behold I have caused thine iniquity to
[1:02:55] pass from
[1:02:57] thee and I will clothe
[1:03:00] thee with change of
[1:03:03] rayment it's the Lord
[1:03:05] also he has a better plan for you and
[1:03:09] I Satan has a a terrible
[1:03:13] plan he he wants to keep us from the
[1:03:15] word of
[1:03:17] God he wants to keep us from our
[1:03:21] Salvation he wants to keep us from the
[1:03:23] blessings
[1:03:25] God has a better
[1:03:27] plan the Lord Jesus Christ has a better
[1:03:30] plan for you and
[1:03:32] I the blessings are for
[1:03:35] us that that we would
[1:03:39] want we can have it do we have money in
[1:03:43] the
[1:03:44] bank do you have money in the
[1:03:47] bank I can tell you right now if you
[1:03:49] have money in the
[1:03:51] bank you can grab it right now and it's
[1:03:53] yours
[1:03:55] your healing is yours your salvation is
[1:03:59] yours the devil has no claim to this
[1:04:01] property
[1:04:04] anymore the devil not your property no
[1:04:07] more the devil we're not your property
[1:04:11] anymore we get you
[1:04:14] now he had me bound
[1:04:17] up and he had a chain and he was pulling
[1:04:21] me brother Bram says we get that chain
[1:04:24] now
[1:04:28] put in the corner we say don't
[1:04:31] move Satan this mind you might want to
[1:04:34] put a seat of doubt in
[1:04:37] it but the heart here it belongs to
[1:04:42] God the the heart that I have it is
[1:04:46] yours Lord we got to think that
[1:04:49] way we we got to act different like I
[1:04:53] said
[1:04:59] right it it it it's hard
[1:05:02] sometimes as a Christian I understand
[1:05:06] that very hard
[1:05:08] sometimes especially as young
[1:05:11] men as young
[1:05:13] ladies but even the the the the elderly
[1:05:17] the
[1:05:19] older I don't want to say you're
[1:05:22] old but we are getting
[1:05:25] older but the same goes for
[1:05:28] us we got to be
[1:05:31] careful we got to guide our
[1:05:33] steps we got to pray one for
[1:05:36] another we cannot talk about one
[1:05:40] another the time for playing games is
[1:05:44] over we're not children
[1:05:47] anymore we've
[1:05:49] matured we got to keep on keeping
[1:05:53] on as brother Ben starts to come
[1:05:58] up I leave you with
[1:06:03] this what is the biggest thing the devil
[1:06:12] fears it's a Fearless you and
[1:06:17] I we got to be
[1:06:20] Fearless we can't let him push us around
[1:06:23] anymore
[1:06:24] we can't can't let him take what's
[1:06:27] ours we can't let him take the joy of
[1:06:30] our Salvation
[1:06:32] anymore we can't let him we got to fight
[1:06:36] him and we fight him with
[1:06:39] this we fight him with God's
[1:06:41] word we fight him with the
[1:06:44] messages we don't fight him with our
[1:06:46] with our bad
[1:06:49] thoughts we don't fight fight him with
[1:06:51] our bad bad
[1:06:53] things
[1:06:55] we don't fight him with our bad
[1:06:57] language we fight him with God's
[1:07:01] word amen God bless
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:18] you man God bless you been you man and
[1:07:22] you sure have been hearing good word
[1:07:26] amen so I put the title of this message
[1:07:29] that the Lord led
[1:07:33] to this is
[1:07:36] what I've been waiting
[1:07:38] for my whole
[1:07:42] life I I want you to grasp
[1:07:46] this in the middle of all that we see
[1:07:49] all around
[1:07:52] us in the middle of
[1:07:55] chaos everything that's been preached to
[1:07:58] us everything that we've been
[1:08:02] taught leads to right
[1:08:05] now you know and many times brother
[1:08:08] Caleb comes and gives us last Wednesday
[1:08:11] some
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:15] words and everybody's heart
[1:08:19] drops everybody gets
[1:08:22] scared but this is what we've been
[1:08:24] waiting
[1:08:25] for we've talked about this
[1:08:30] day but you know what I figured one
[1:08:34] thing this
[1:08:36] church has the
[1:08:39] worst the
[1:08:41] worst repeat with me the
[1:08:44] worst sports
[1:08:52] fans don't we we have the worst sports
[1:08:59] fans you know we we we we watch TV on
[1:09:02] Sunday
[1:09:04] right you watch all these sports that's
[1:09:07] that's
[1:09:09] happening this whole
[1:09:11] world is watching and every time a ball
[1:09:15] gets
[1:09:17] dropped what
[1:09:19] happens have the odds
[1:09:22] right
[1:09:25] ah every time a touchdown happens what
[1:09:28] you
[1:09:35] have ex exactly it depends on the
[1:09:39] team but you see what I'm
[1:09:43] saying you guys are the worst SP fans
[1:09:50] ever I remember when the Eagles won
[1:09:53] Super
[1:09:57] Bowl I saw
[1:09:59] Noah he was running through the
[1:10:03] house and he was going flying like he
[1:10:06] was an
[1:10:12] eagle so we're the worst sports fans
[1:10:16] right you know if we take it to if we
[1:10:19] really believe what we
[1:10:22] believe
[1:10:24] how would we
[1:10:26] act if we
[1:10:27] knew that we were a son or daughter of
[1:10:34] God very very
[1:10:39] disappointing we don't have to talk a
[1:10:41] lot
[1:10:43] tonight but are we really God's
[1:10:48] children come on church are we really
[1:10:52] his children
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:10:55] because you know what what's been taught
[1:10:57] in this
[1:10:59] place is that we are not therometer
[1:11:04] Christians you know what a thermometer
[1:11:06] Christian
[1:11:09] is
[1:11:12] Thermometer so what
[1:11:14] happens if your temperature around you
[1:11:17] is
[1:11:19] hot then you're
[1:11:21] hot if if it's good around
[1:11:25] you then you feel
[1:11:27] good but if it's if you're lonely around
[1:11:30] if everything's lonely around
[1:11:33] you then you're
[1:11:36] lonely but the prophet of God teaches us
[1:11:41] something to be therat
[1:11:45] Christians that we got to set the
[1:11:50] temperature so that's why
[1:11:52] Church this is the
[1:11:55] day this is what I long
[1:11:59] for this is my
[1:12:01] day so why are you going to be
[1:12:05] sad why are you going to be
[1:12:08] lonely why are you going to be
[1:12:11] scared God called us for this
[1:12:16] day let us get into the
[1:12:19] word now we're ready for God's
[1:12:22] word
[1:12:24] because we forget who we
[1:12:26] are we're children of
[1:12:29] God we're that Royal priest what he
[1:12:31] talks
[1:12:33] about for that chosen
[1:12:37] generation let us turn to the book of
[1:12:51] Deuteronomy chapter chapter
[1:12:58] 4:32 and it reads like
[1:13:04] this ask
[1:13:08] now ask
[1:13:10] now of the days that are
[1:13:14] passed which were before
[1:13:18] you which were before
[1:13:20] thee since the day that God created man
[1:13:24] on the
[1:13:26] earth and asked from one side of Heaven
[1:13:29] the
[1:13:31] other whether there have been any such
[1:13:36] thing as great as this
[1:13:39] thing or have you anything be I'm sorry
[1:13:44] or have been heard like
[1:13:47] it you know this word this word excites
[1:13:51] me because he said ask
[1:13:55] now but then he it seems like he's
[1:13:57] making us go
[1:14:00] back he said ask
[1:14:02] now what has happened
[1:14:05] already so what does that tell you
[1:14:09] church he says it was before
[1:14:12] you but maybe we didn't recognize
[1:14:15] it maybe we were
[1:14:18] scared he said ask
[1:14:22] now because what
[1:14:24] happens he says you look from one side
[1:14:26] of
[1:14:28] Heaven to the other and you see if
[1:14:32] there's any been a day like
[1:14:38] this you you say what what are we
[1:14:41] looking
[1:14:42] for we're looking to go home
[1:14:45] church that's where we're at we're at
[1:14:47] that cuff right
[1:14:49] now it's time to go
[1:14:52] home so why does Fear come
[1:14:55] in because what happens we put
[1:15:00] fear in the place of
[1:15:04] urgency if the coming of
[1:15:07] God if it's at
[1:15:09] hand where's the sense of
[1:15:12] urgency if he's coming
[1:15:15] tomorrow where's the sense of
[1:15:18] urgency or are we all ready to go
[1:15:22] home cuz I'm telling you
[1:15:24] church if we're not
[1:15:26] ready you better get
[1:15:29] ready you know I was
[1:15:32] imagining the day that Noah's Ark was
[1:15:35] being
[1:15:38] closed I was thinking maybe the people
[1:15:40] were just watching it
[1:15:44] close maybe they could have ran and got
[1:15:48] up but they had no sense of
[1:15:52] urgency they didn't care what was going
[1:15:55] on it began to get common to
[1:15:59] them oh that's just Noah
[1:16:02] again now he's closing the
[1:16:05] door but little did they know that God
[1:16:09] was shutting the
[1:16:12] opportunity God was shutting the
[1:16:15] chest that they were going to be
[1:16:19] saved so he said look to the
[1:16:22] left then look through
[1:16:25] Heaven there's been no day like
[1:16:28] today the opportunity that we
[1:16:31] have we have it in our
[1:16:34] hands it's in our
[1:16:38] Gras we could almost touch the coming of
[1:16:41] the
[1:16:42] Lord but where is the
[1:16:46] urgency where is the
[1:16:48] church and I got to preach this to
[1:16:52] myself
[1:16:54] you
[1:16:55] think our pastors run ragged right
[1:17:02] now why he's going all over the
[1:17:06] world trying to find that
[1:17:09] one you have men that have backed him
[1:17:14] up you think it's easy for these men to
[1:17:18] go they have
[1:17:20] businesses they have families
[1:17:23] every time I'm sure when brother Mark
[1:17:26] leaves his business takes the
[1:17:30] hit cuz he's not there to run a brother
[1:17:33] will call me all these
[1:17:36] men what are they doing the sense of
[1:17:40] urgency our pastor doesn't care how he
[1:17:44] feels we got to take this
[1:17:47] gospel take it to
[1:17:49] Norway Poland he said let's start
[1:17:52] lighting fires
[1:17:55] everywhere but what about here
[1:17:59] church is the fire going to be lit
[1:18:01] inside of
[1:18:04] us I want that
[1:18:06] fire I want it lit inside of
[1:18:10] me why Church to preach the
[1:18:14] gospel to spread the good
[1:18:21] news Hallelujah
[1:18:23] it's
[1:18:24] time it's time we think it's a
[1:18:29] joke I I remember our founding pastor
[1:18:32] always telling
[1:18:34] us he said one day we're gonna come and
[1:18:39] you're going to say why is this brother
[1:18:41] gone why is half the church
[1:18:45] gone and he says you won't even know
[1:18:47] what
[1:18:48] happened that's where we're
[1:18:51] at so this is is what I've been waiting
[1:18:55] for my whole
[1:18:57] life this is what because in this
[1:19:01] scripture if you go to verse
[1:19:04] 30 let's start with verse
[1:19:08] 29 he says
[1:19:12] but from then Thou shalt seek the Lord
[1:19:15] thy
[1:19:17] God thou sh not find Thou shalt find him
[1:19:21] if thou seek him
[1:19:24] with all your
[1:19:26] heart with all your
[1:19:29] soul when there are
[1:19:32] tribulations and all these things have
[1:19:35] have come upon
[1:19:38] thee even in the latter
[1:19:41] days that's this
[1:19:44] day if th turn to the
[1:19:51] Lord
[1:20:03] [Music]
[1:20:14] but he said now ask ask
[1:20:16] now he says cuz what you keep on reading
[1:20:19] the
[1:20:21] Scriptures it says where have you ever
[1:20:25] seen a man go up to a burning
[1:20:31] bush and him see that fire he come face
[1:20:34] to face with the pillar of
[1:20:37] fire he says and
[1:20:41] live he says Where have you
[1:20:44] seen he says look in all Heaven you have
[1:20:46] never seen
[1:20:48] this he's trying to wake them
[1:20:51] up he says because something
[1:20:55] happened he says you go back the
[1:20:57] scripture says go back all the way to
[1:21:01] Abraham someone
[1:21:04] stood someone
[1:21:06] stood for this
[1:21:09] seed he said someone
[1:21:12] St for you you were that
[1:21:16] seed that Abraham stood
[1:21:19] for you were that promise
[1:21:23] he said now
[1:21:25] look you see it anywhere
[1:21:27] else he said no you don't see
[1:21:30] it because many times we take for
[1:21:34] granted the lineage that we come
[1:21:39] from but but I I have some nuggets
[1:21:45] here I'm to use your nugget
[1:21:49] brother I'm going to use yours de
[1:21:54] it was too good for you not to hear
[1:21:58] this brother
[1:22:00] Abraham he's telling us about the seed
[1:22:03] that you belong
[1:22:06] to sharing it with the African
[1:22:10] Ministry because so many
[1:22:13] times if we were just realize who we
[1:22:17] were we would be the best sports fans in
[1:22:21] here juming up and
[1:22:23] down we feel like the woman at the
[1:22:28] well but here here he's telling
[1:22:30] us he says when
[1:22:34] Abraham through
[1:22:37] Hagar
[1:22:39] is he says when it came to
[1:22:43] pass he says Sarah was kicked off in
[1:22:48] Camp Sarah told
[1:22:51] Abraham you take
[1:22:54] Hagar and you take that
[1:22:56] child and you kick them out of
[1:23:00] Camp so you go into Genesis and it tells
[1:23:03] you
[1:23:05] it here comes
[1:23:07] Hagar comes that
[1:23:10] child gives him
[1:23:12] water he says you're going to have to
[1:23:15] leave so they're going in the
[1:23:19] desert Water Runs Out
[1:23:23] they're at the point of
[1:23:25] death and Hagar puts the baby under a
[1:23:31] bush I cannot see this
[1:23:34] lord I can't see this baby
[1:23:37] die she begins to cry to the
[1:23:40] Lord she begins to
[1:23:43] cry she said
[1:23:45] Lord you got to do
[1:23:47] something me and the baby are going to
[1:23:50] die she was on her KNE
[1:23:54] she was begging to the
[1:23:56] Lord but the
[1:24:02] Lord the Lord heard her
[1:24:13] cry but the
[1:24:15] minute that that baby
[1:24:18] cried it woke got
[1:24:21] up
[1:24:23] and he showed
[1:24:24] Hagar turn
[1:24:26] around there's water right there you
[1:24:30] take it and you give to that
[1:24:32] baby but why did God
[1:24:36] respond to the
[1:24:38] baby because that was
[1:24:41] still the Seed of
[1:24:44] Abraham it wasn't the promise
[1:24:47] seed but how much
[1:24:50] more you're the seed of
[1:24:53] AB how much
[1:24:56] more will God answer your
[1:24:59] prayers how much more will he
[1:25:03] respond because why the scripture was
[1:25:06] being made
[1:25:09] manifest because why when you are in
[1:25:12] that
[1:25:14] will the prophet of God
[1:25:16] says then you have scriptural
[1:25:21] Authority
[1:25:23] because why on that day of
[1:25:27] Pentecost they were up in that they were
[1:25:30] waiting he said you wait here in the
[1:25:32] city of
[1:25:35] Jerusalem until you're ued with
[1:25:39] power but they were human just like me
[1:25:42] and
[1:25:43] you maybe they said brother
[1:25:46] Isaac we've been here nine
[1:25:50] days maybe we got to go go find it
[1:25:55] somewhere maybe another brother said we
[1:25:57] got to do
[1:25:59] this but the prophet of God says but
[1:26:01] Peter
[1:26:03] stood the scripture says we have to
[1:26:07] wait until we're
[1:26:10] indued power and then maybe John stood
[1:26:14] up and he said everything Jesus talked
[1:26:18] about it was something
[1:26:21] powerful
[1:26:22] it was going to be a mighty power that
[1:26:24] we were to
[1:26:26] receive so they
[1:26:28] waited but one day something
[1:26:32] happened that
[1:26:34] word became
[1:26:36] manifest and when they
[1:26:39] saw the word come to
[1:26:42] pass that was the scripture of
[1:26:46] authority that they waited
[1:26:48] for and that's when that rushing Mighty
[1:26:51] wi came down
[1:26:55] and they covered
[1:26:56] them but what happen
[1:26:58] church we do not want to take the
[1:27:02] word and let it take its place inside of
[1:27:06] us we don't want to let that
[1:27:10] happen now let's go to the Book of
[1:27:17] Jeremiah I'm sorry
[1:27:19] brother God's word is powerful
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:26] Jeremiah
[1:27:28] 29 verse 20 verse
[1:27:33] 9 this is good
[1:27:36] church you know I never understood
[1:27:41] Jeremiah but when you study
[1:27:44] Jeremiah reminds me a lot of
[1:27:48] John because he always leaned on God
[1:27:55] he would speak to
[1:27:58] God like if he was Adam in the Garden of
[1:28:03] Eden say stuff like
[1:28:06] Lord I can't do
[1:28:09] nothing unless I lean upon
[1:28:12] you but here he
[1:28:15] says verse Jeremiah 20
[1:28:21] ver9
[1:28:30] change then I
[1:28:33] said I will not make
[1:28:37] mention nor speak any more of his
[1:28:44] name hold
[1:28:46] on this is God's
[1:28:49] Prophet the same one that brought
[1:28:51] prophet prophecy upon
[1:28:54] prophecy he says I'm not even going to
[1:28:56] make mention of his
[1:28:59] name where was
[1:29:02] he where was
[1:29:04] he had he
[1:29:08] given had he given
[1:29:11] up you begin to
[1:29:14] read and you began it looks like he's
[1:29:17] beginning to lose his
[1:29:20] mind
[1:29:22] it begins to look like he's throwing in
[1:29:24] the
[1:29:27] towel maybe he preached too
[1:29:31] much but he was so in a such a
[1:29:36] depression because God's
[1:29:39] people would not
[1:29:41] follow the scripture says they were in a
[1:29:44] bad shape of
[1:29:48] idol they began to forget who they were
[1:29:53] they for forgot where they came
[1:29:55] from they forgot who God even
[1:30:00] was and the prophet was a blushing
[1:30:03] Prophet
[1:30:05] also he says but his name I won't say no
[1:30:10] more but his
[1:30:12] word was in my
[1:30:15] heart as a burning
[1:30:18] fire shut up in my bones
[1:30:22] even though he wanted a quit even though
[1:30:25] he wanted a
[1:30:27] quit there was something inside of
[1:30:30] him that began to go all the
[1:30:34] way through the marrow of his
[1:30:37] b and it was the
[1:30:40] power that came with that
[1:30:43] word that even though he wanted to
[1:30:47] quit God says you're not going to
[1:30:50] quit because when you take God and his
[1:30:55] word and you're his
[1:30:58] seed it begins to do
[1:31:01] something because the prophet of God
[1:31:03] says that
[1:31:04] Moses he went to the burning
[1:31:07] bush the burning bush took him
[1:31:12] in but then he took that burning bush
[1:31:20] in because this it's
[1:31:22] not us just
[1:31:25] taking and
[1:31:27] taking and getting wrapped up in his
[1:31:31] word it's
[1:31:33] nice to have the beautiful
[1:31:37] musicians it's
[1:31:40] nice to have the best pastor we could
[1:31:43] ever ask
[1:31:45] for to have the best
[1:31:47] Ministry to have the best
[1:31:50] youth to have the best
[1:31:54] doesn't so
[1:31:56] good that's not what we
[1:31:59] for come for to receive that Holy
[1:32:03] Ghost if you could only realize
[1:32:07] Church show
[1:32:09] me you look through the right side of
[1:32:12] Heaven to the left side of
[1:32:16] Heaven show me where off this is
[1:32:20] happening are you see brother are we
[1:32:22] better than
[1:32:25] everybody no no I ain't going to make it
[1:32:28] without
[1:32:29] them so why am I going to want to be
[1:32:32] better than
[1:32:34] them but the difference is this
[1:32:37] word it's
[1:32:39] mine and when it
[1:32:41] comes and it comes inside of
[1:32:44] you then it's all shot up in my
[1:32:48] bones begin to take
[1:32:50] over
[1:32:52] and it might tell you oh I don't want to
[1:32:55] go to
[1:32:56] Norway I don't want to go to Poland it
[1:32:59] says you're going to
[1:33:01] PO you're going here you're going there
[1:33:05] brother you're going there
[1:33:08] brother you believe it because why shut
[1:33:12] up in our
[1:33:14] bones word begins to take
[1:33:18] over and we begin to see everything that
[1:33:21] our found Pastor told
[1:33:24] us get the word inside of
[1:33:26] you get that word inside of you stand to
[1:33:30] your feet
[1:33:37] Church God's word does something
[1:33:39] spectacular to
[1:33:43] us and you might say
[1:33:46] brother it doesn't scare
[1:33:49] you I'm human just like you are
[1:33:53] of course it's
[1:33:54] SC but somewhere deep inside of
[1:33:58] us we
[1:34:00] know that the word that we've received
[1:34:03] here has made us
[1:34:07] ready we have dressed ourselves in God's
[1:34:13] word and there's nothing that's going to
[1:34:16] stop us
[1:34:18] now so this is what I've been waiting
[1:34:23] for my whole life church this is it
[1:34:28] brother Al this is
[1:34:31] it you that have been following this
[1:34:35] message year after
[1:34:38] year it's finally going to pay
[1:34:41] off we are going to make it

[1:34:48] different we're going to make it home

[1:35:06] world brother's telling every everything
[1:35:09] that's happening
[1:35:12] here why because it's an
[1:35:16] attraction what we have is an
[1:35:19] attraction there something powerful
[1:35:22] we have something
[1:35:24] great because that's what the woman of
[1:35:26] the well
[1:35:28] said she says I
[1:35:30] think that when the Messiah
[1:35:33] comes he will do these
[1:35:35] things that's not what she
[1:35:38] said she said I
[1:35:41] know when the Messiah
[1:35:44] com this is what will be
[1:35:47] produced this is that
