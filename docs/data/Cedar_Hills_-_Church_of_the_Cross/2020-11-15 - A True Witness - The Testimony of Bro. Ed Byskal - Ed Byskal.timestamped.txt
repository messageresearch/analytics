[11:03] this account
[11:05] is regarding a soldier
[11:08] boy and uh knowing that I had raised I'd
[11:13] been raised in quite a few of the Army
[11:15] Camps US Army Camps during the building
[11:19] of the Alaskan
[11:21] Highway
[11:23] now this was
[11:25] 1961 so I had not seen a US Army
[11:31] uniform but I I I in the foyer of the
[11:35] church or it wasn't the church it was
[11:38] the church Hall in Dawson Creek United
[11:41] Church Hall in Dawson Creek and I I
[11:46] looked through the people and I could
[11:48] see a staff
[11:50] sergeant on a tunic and so that caught
[11:54] my attention I thought that's nice to
[11:56] see you know and then I didn't see see
[11:59] it
[12:00] anymore then while we're in the service
[12:04] we've come to the end of the service it
[12:06] is Saturday
[12:10] evening uh and brother brandham has
[12:13] preached the service from that
[12:16] time and we've come to the end of the
[12:19] service and he begins to sing the whole
[12:22] congregation begin to saying I love him
[12:24] I love
[12:25] him right in the midst of that course at
[12:28] the first end of the course what's the
[12:31] matter soldier
[12:35] boy you're not good to commits to his
[12:39] [Music]
[12:43] sign the devil's lying to you
[12:46] boy you've only got a
[12:50] phobe he's lying to you he'll drive you
[12:53] insane if you believe him deny him
[12:56] renounce the devil I command you in the
[12:59] name of Jesus Christ to renounce the
[13:01] devil and accept Jesus Christ as your
[13:03] healer you'll go back and be a gentleman
[13:04] and a real real man do you do it raise
[13:07] up your hands to God and say praise God
[13:10] that's right oh amen now go back home
[13:12] and be well all in believing raise your
[13:14] hands and give me pra the amazing thing
[13:17] is I was there I was on the platform and
[13:22] so I immediately thought of this this
[13:26] tunic that I had
[13:27] seen and and young people were
[13:30] buying you know army uniforms and tunics
[13:34] and so on just wearing it as jackets so
[13:37] I didn't know but what it was
[13:39] that and uh so I began to look for
[13:43] soldja boy and others were looking also
[13:46] there were also some
[13:48] Canadian uh soldiers that had been
[13:50] attending the meeting one of them became
[13:53] a very very firm
[13:54] believer and uh we couldn't see any
[13:57] soldier boy at all brother brandham
[14:00] continues to talk to him and says you'll
[14:04] go home and be a real gentleman and be a
[14:06] real man deny the devil deny
[14:11] him and so it was a it was a startling
[14:14] moment
[14:16] really and the next day we were
[14:20] leaving or the following day we were
[14:23] leaving early in the morning on Monday
[14:26] morning brother brandham did not know
[14:28] where we were were taking him I was just
[14:30] taking him off the Alaskan Highway and
[14:33] we were going to go about
[14:36] 375 400
[14:38] miles so we drove as far as Fort Nelson
[14:43] which is mile
[14:45] 300 and I said to brother
[14:48] brandham I said you know maybe by maybe
[14:51] we should have a bite to eat because by
[14:54] the time we get up to brother
[14:57] southwick's place which will be my
[14:59] 375 at that
[15:02] time I said you know Sister Lyla will
[15:05] probably be done her dishes at sister
[15:07] Southwick and he said I think that's a
[15:09] good idea so we just pulled off on an
[15:12] access road on the left side and stopped
[15:16] a little little stopping place it was
[15:19] like a little
[15:20] hotel when the US Army pushed the
[15:23] highway through do through Fort Dawson
[15:26] Creek and then Fort St John they passed
[15:29] the town and then the service stations
[15:33] Etc built alongside of the
[15:36] road and so we stopped in there but
[15:38] there was a restaurant just a little
[15:40] clapboard building probably two
[15:43] stories and uh we're having
[15:47] our uh we're going to have our lunch
[15:50] brother chrisberg was with us there was
[15:53] brother chrisberg brother brandham and
[15:56] myself and we sat in a booth that
[15:59] waitress had come and taken our order
[16:01] and just after that the door opened
[16:05] which was on the side of the building
[16:07] and in came two men and I recognized as
[16:11] one as being the soldier boy that I'd
[16:14] seen in the tunic unit the T tunic
[16:17] uniform I should say and
[16:21] uh I when I looked at him I said well
[16:25] fancy seeing you
[16:27] here I had been away from this area for
[16:31] about a year and a half and brother
[16:34] brandham he just looked up over his
[16:36] shoulder like this to see who it was I
[16:39] was talking to he thought maybe perhaps
[16:41] one of my old friends I don't know what
[16:44] he thought exactly but just then a a
[16:47] kind of a stout heavy or set man
[16:51] squeezed between him and came around and
[16:54] and thrust his hand down towards brother
[16:57] brandom and said brother br
[16:59] he said remember calling out the soldier
[17:02] boy and and brother brandham was a
[17:04] little startled because he hadn't
[17:06] expected that and he said uh uh he said
[17:10] he looked across the table he said do
[17:12] you remember brother Eddie I said yes
[17:15] you
[17:16] said you'll not commit suicide soldier
[17:19] boy that's the devil talking to you he
[17:21] said yeah that's what you said that's
[17:23] what you said and he's shaking brother
[17:25] brenham's hand he said well I brought
[17:29] him all the way from Fairbanks and we we
[17:31] tried to get him into a prayer line and
[17:33] we weren't able to get him into a prayer
[17:35] line he said this is him would you pray
[17:38] for him and uh oh sure and just that
[17:41] moment the waitress came and slid our
[17:44] soup in front of us and uh so brother
[17:48] Bram said well uh perhaps and that was
[17:51] one of my
[17:52] first real shocking moments I thought
[17:56] brother Brandon was going to stand and
[17:58] pray for him cast that devil out of him
[18:00] you know because that was how I had been
[18:03] brought up and brother brandham said
[18:06] well maybe we'll just eat our soup first
[18:08] and I thought eat our soup you know here
[18:12] here's a soldier boy trying to commit
[18:14] suicide so anyway they said well that'll
[18:17] be fine we need to get something to eat
[18:19] ourselves and they went down two three
[18:21] booths and sat in uh to have their
[18:25] dinner and then brother brandham entered
[18:28] into vision and he just looked over my
[18:31] head and uh began to talk about what had
[18:35] happened in the prayer line the day
[18:37] before he said I believe there was a
[18:39] blind woman that came through the
[18:42] service
[18:43] yesterday and I said well I I can't
[18:45] remember a blind woman and brother Chris
[18:48] Berg spoke up he said yeah I believe
[18:51] there was a blind woman and brother Bram
[18:54] he's he's not really acknowledging our
[18:57] conversation he just looking over my
[19:00] head and uh he said
[19:02] yes he said let's see yes he said oh I
[19:08] understand I say now he said there's a
[19:11] young German woman that has given up her
[19:15] place in the prayer line to lead the
[19:18] blind woman through and then he he
[19:21] looked at me he said you see brother
[19:24] Eddie it may be that she's praying right
[19:27] now and and he he said uh just a moment
[19:32] and he looks away for a moment he said
[19:35] yes she's a German woman just to help
[19:38] you believe he said I'll ask him and
[19:40] he'll give me her name and he just
[19:43] looked away he said yes her name is
[19:47] Sister fair in English we would say fair
[19:51] but in German we would say fair sister
[19:55] fair and then he just moved his head for
[19:59] a little bit he said you see perhaps
[20:01] she's praying just now he said she has a
[20:06] heart
[20:07] trouble she has an uh two or three
[20:11] organs in her body and he named them and
[20:15] said she's she may be praying just
[20:19] now I asked my father if he could find
[20:23] this woman and my father found her she
[20:28] was in a a city quite a bit south of
[20:32] Dawson Creek and it would have been
[20:36] about 500 miles from where we were
[20:38] sitting and I I just found myself in an
[20:43] unusual place and now with that soldier
[20:47] boy in his need brother brandham became
[20:52] under that burden so as soon as we were
[20:55] finished eating we got up to pay the
[20:57] bill
[20:59] and brother brandham he's standing right
[21:02] in front he wouldn't he wouldn't let
[21:04] anyone pay the bill so he's standing
[21:06] right in front of the cash desk and
[21:09] we're I'm standing right beside him and
[21:11] the soldier boy came in and he's right
[21:13] behind
[21:14] him and the soldier boy just tapped him
[21:17] on the shoulder he said brother brandham
[21:20] he said just two minutes just two
[21:22] minutes oh sure he said and uh and and
[21:26] the little thought F we all in a group
[21:29] there and we walked out the door and
[21:33] outside the door was a small
[21:35] sidewalk it went down
[21:38] here uh would be to the left as we came
[21:41] out and went down to the garbage cans
[21:44] and up to the right would be where the
[21:48] cars were parked on the gravel access
[21:51] road and so I and chrisberg and the
[21:56] little heavys set fellow who drove him
[21:58] down
[21:59] uh went up we we went up there but I
[22:02] faced myself so I could watch and see
[22:05] that brother brandham what he was doing
[22:08] because I was very very curious in my
[22:12] young heart I was about 26 27 and I'd
[22:17] been preaching for several years but I
[22:20] was just I there was no such a thing as
[22:24] knowing the message yet there's no such
[22:26] a thing I had no knowledge of Malachi 4
[22:30] I had no knowledge of Revelation no
[22:32] knowledge of a messenger I only knew
[22:35] that brother
[22:37] Branham had a
[22:40] unique the unique uh part of his
[22:44] ministry was the angel of the Lord that
[22:47] was always there and I thought if that
[22:51] angel of the Lord is in attendance at
[22:54] these meetings regardless of what anyone
[22:56] has said about him or said about his
[22:59] Doctrine I would I would know by the
[23:02] presence of the Angel of the Lord that
[23:05] he would not honor something that was
[23:08] not correct or
[23:10] true and so as I was watching brother
[23:14] brandham I saw that he had his hat off
[23:18] and I knew that he was praying and then
[23:20] he slipped his hat back on and both of
[23:24] both he and the soldier boy turned
[23:26] around and they're walking very erect
[23:29] towards me the soldier boy was a bit
[23:32] quite a bit taller than brother brandham
[23:35] and I thought at that instant I thought
[23:38] now this could be a very charismatic
[23:42] moment and I'm not going going to be
[23:44] swept away by the you know the
[23:47] excitement or the emotion of the moment
[23:50] and that's what I had just had in my
[23:52] heart but the Soldier Boy's face was
[23:56] completely transformed
[23:59] formed he was he was just totally
[24:02] relaxed and he thrust his hand up into
[24:05] the air with his fist he said I'm free
[24:10] I'm free I'm
[24:12] free and they came up and the soldier
[24:16] said to me he said this man told
[24:21] me something that only I and my wife in
[24:24] this world know says and when he did it
[24:27] was gone
[24:30] so we stepped into our cars and we said
[24:32] our farewells and I guess I understand I
[24:36] took a picture of them and which I'm
[24:40] this is a unique part of this ministry
[24:43] and the unique part of my
[24:46] testimony is the Eternal aspect of God
[24:51] because here I had it on the
[24:54] platform now here we were 300 mil up the
[24:58] road and all I can really say is I was
[25:02] there on the platform I heard him call
[25:05] the solder boy out we have it on
[25:09] tape now I'm 300 miles
[25:12] away and you you have to understand
[25:15] where we were standing you probably
[25:18] could go a, or500 miles north and never
[25:23] see a human you could probably go at
[25:26] least five six 7 100 miles south and
[25:29] never see a human down the Rocky
[25:31] Mountain trench from where we were truly
[25:35] a needle in a Hast
[25:37] stack and that man had
[25:39] brought the soldier down for prayer from
[25:43] Fairbanks Alaska
[25:46] 1523 miles on a very difficult
[25:52] Journey actually believed he said I
[25:56] believed that we would find you and the
[26:00] soldier boy spoke up and he said that is
[26:03] correct this man actually believed we
[26:05] would find you today and to find two
[26:09] humans or three
[26:11] humans in that part of the world
[26:16] was is more than a needle in a hay stock
[26:20] it just had to be Sovereign almighty God
[26:22] and now he's saying his final words
[26:26] while they were down
[26:28] praying at the garbage
[26:32] cans this heavys set man was kind of
[26:35] nervously speaking he
[26:38] said uh he's tried to commit suicide
[26:41] three times he's been under the care of
[26:44] the army doctors and he said they can't
[26:47] figure out what's wrong with him he has
[26:51] he has a lovely Christian wife and two
[26:54] beautiful children and they just
[26:57] couldn't fig figure out what was wrong
[26:59] with him when we got in our
[27:02] cars brother bandam he just on the
[27:05] little access road and it was rough and
[27:10] brother brandom said to me he said
[27:11] brother ready he said uh you don't know
[27:15] this young man or I said no I don't
[27:18] really he said he's not a good friend of
[27:21] yours I said no I don't know him he said
[27:27] uh not likely you'll ever see him again
[27:31] and I I know I noticed that not likely
[27:34] you'll ever see him again and I said uh
[27:37] no I said he lives in Fairbanks
[27:41] Alaska I live in Victoria British
[27:44] Columbia not likely we'll ever see him
[27:47] again he said now just to help you
[27:51] believe he said if if you knew him if he
[27:55] was a good friend of yours I'd never
[27:57] tell you
[27:58] you but he said when we got to the end
[28:02] of the
[28:03] sidewalk he came to us there I knew
[28:05] exactly what he was talking about he
[28:08] came to us there and told him had a
[28:11] lovely Christian wife and two beautiful
[28:14] children I just heard that 2 three
[28:18] minutes
[28:19] before from his friend that drove him
[28:22] down and I wouldn't be telling this
[28:25] account to you or the world
[28:29] if he'd said he had a a Christian wife
[28:32] and three
[28:34] children but the man told me he had a
[28:37] lovely Christian wife and two children
[28:40] here's brother brandham telling me he
[28:41] has a lovely Christian wife and two
[28:44] children but he had been committing
[28:46] homosexual acts with young
[28:49] men and as soon as he said that he said
[28:53] as soon as that was uncovered Satan lost
[28:56] his power and I I learned a great Truth
[29:00] at that moment that all Satan has to be
[29:04] as exposed once he's exposed he's lost
[29:07] his
[29:08] power now here I come to a very unique
[29:13] part of this whole
[29:16] Ministry that one that was talking and
[29:19] speaking he came to us there that one
[29:24] who said what his problem was that
[29:29] God is timeless he's Eternal and it was
[29:33] 36 years
[29:35] later 36 years later a few years
[29:41] ago uh I was in my
[29:44] study and I came
[29:47] upstairs and my daughter Marilyn our our
[29:50] middle daughter her and her husband Mike
[29:54] had been down to Florida and and had
[29:58] been visiting a church and Pastor
[30:01] brother Bob Brown gave Marilyn a picture
[30:05] and said here give this to your dad I
[30:08] think it may be Northern Canada and he
[30:10] might know something about it so when I
[30:13] came upstairs from study my wife said
[30:17] Marilyn left a picture here for you
[30:20] brother Bob Brown sent it up so I went
[30:23] to the little telephone desk and I'm I'm
[30:26] holding the picture and it's the soldier
[30:29] boy and the man that brought him down
[30:31] from Fairbanks and brother brandom
[30:34] standing between them and I took the
[30:36] picture I couldn't remember taking the
[30:39] picture but I was the only other person
[30:41] except brother chrisberg who wouldn't
[30:44] know how to handle a
[30:45] [Music]
[30:47] camera and I was struck into
[30:51] silence and she and my wife said what is
[30:56] it I couldn't seem to to answer her she
[30:59] said again what is it what is it what is
[31:03] the
[31:04] picture I said it's the soldier
[31:07] boy I said I've got to call Brother
[31:10] Brown so I called him and got him on the
[31:13] phone right away I said brother
[31:17] Brown where did you get this picture he
[31:21] said well I had a young man here in the
[31:26] church he was kind of of a you know he
[31:29] wasn't really stable he didn't seem to
[31:33] be stable he was here and then he would
[31:34] be drifting someplace else I said is he
[31:38] still there no he said he's not here
[31:41] anymore he said and he was working in a
[31:45] with a construction company uh they were
[31:48] building a mall and some people were in
[31:50] there doing the floor and this young guy
[31:55] he was always wanting to witness the
[31:57] somebody so he was talking to this man
[32:01] about brother brandham and he said and
[32:05] the other other fellow said well I've
[32:08] had my picture taken with him and he
[32:10] brought him that picture and brother
[32:13] Bram had said to me not likely you'll
[32:15] ever see him again I tried to make
[32:18] contact with him but I could not I never
[32:22] have seen him since not since that day
[32:25] we in Fort Nelson British CL I and so I
[32:29] begin to realize the
[32:32] timelessness and how something an event
[32:36] will happen but it's not just a single
[32:39] event it just keeps
[32:41] unfolding and unfolding because it's an
[32:44] eternal
[32:45] God and that is the story of the soldier
[32:49] boy
[32:50] [Music]
[33:02] [Music]
[33:36] oh
[33:37] [Music]
[34:06] [Music]
[34:18] on
[34:19] Sunday uh which was the next day after
[34:23] the soldier boy had been called
[34:25] out I was once again on the
[34:29] platform and uh they had a prayer
[34:32] line and uh in that prayer line came a
[34:36] woman well well known to us she was a
[34:40] very dear friend of my
[34:43] parents and I knew her very well her
[34:46] name was uh sister
[34:49] clun her husband they didn't have any
[34:51] children that I know of her husband was
[34:54] a very Stout man and I don't what he uh
[34:59] what he actually did for a living but I
[35:01] believe he worked in the agricultural
[35:03] Department from what we have found out
[35:07] s and so she came up and she just
[35:10] standing and brother brandham says now
[35:15] here is a lady and he begins to speak
[35:19] and uh he said you're very
[35:22] nervous uh he said and you have other
[35:25] complications other problems
[35:28] uh you have I think a spiritual problem
[35:30] as well and he begins to talk to her he
[35:33] said yes you are very nervous he said I
[35:37] see you standing by a window when the
[35:41] sun was
[35:43] setting and you're rubbing your
[35:47] hands and uh then he stops and he's
[35:51] speaking to her but he's also speaking
[35:54] to the congregation speaking to people
[35:57] like
[35:58] myself he's saying
[36:01] now uh and this it means so much to us
[36:05] now he said now who could do that what
[36:10] man could tell you where you were
[36:14] standing and what you were praying and
[36:16] he said and then you prayed that God
[36:20] would help you to get a prayer card and
[36:22] when that prayer card was given to you
[36:25] you were so happy very very happy that
[36:28] you'd received a prayer card and he he
[36:32] asked you
[36:34] know how how could a man know that he
[36:37] wanted the people to see that that was
[36:39] God and the Prophet The Prophet Ministry
[36:43] for a prophet is a spokesman for God it
[36:47] was not just a gift of discernment it
[36:49] was not that but a lot of my friends
[36:53] were tended to believe that it was just
[36:56] maybe a gift of word of knowledge or
[36:58] something it wasn't that he was in both
[37:02] worlds he was in another dimension and
[37:04] he told her where she was
[37:06] standing what her prayer
[37:09] was and how her reaction when she got
[37:12] the prayer
[37:14] card and then he
[37:16] said uh now he said we'll just talk to
[37:21] the lady and he said you have something
[37:24] else now this is what was so striking to
[37:27] to me he said you have something else
[37:30] that's on your heart you're praying for
[37:33] a
[37:34] friend a man that's dying with
[37:38] cancer and they do not live and I
[37:41] noticed he said they do not live because
[37:44] it was him and his wife he said they do
[37:48] not live here they live in Fort St
[37:52] John and I knew Fort St John was just 50
[37:56] mil up the askan Highway what brother
[37:59] brandham did not know is we were going
[38:03] up the highway I was taking him early
[38:06] the next morning Monday morning up the
[38:09] highway and brother Brandon was
[38:11] preaching on show us the
[38:15] father I thought it was so
[38:18] remarkable he was actually showing the
[38:21] people the
[38:23] father he said who could tell you where
[38:26] you were standing when you
[38:29] prayed no one but almighty God and that
[38:33] you're praying for a friend and he said
[38:36] he's he's dying with cancer yes he said
[38:40] he's a a
[38:42] sinner and he's dying with cancer
[38:46] mentioned it
[38:47] twice and he said uh only believe just
[38:52] believe that seemed to be the key he
[38:56] said take that
[38:58] handkerchief that you have and give it
[39:01] to him and he'll be
[39:04] well I guess she never did get it to him
[39:07] this was the end of May he passed away
[39:11] July the 6th
[39:14] 1961 but of course I didn't know that we
[39:17] we we found that out many years
[39:20] later but the next
[39:24] day I'm in the car and you have to
[39:27] understand
[39:28] I had a lot of
[39:30] questions about brother brandham about
[39:34] his doctr about his ministry but there
[39:38] was one thing that I
[39:40] knew that is the Angel of the Lord was
[39:43] in attendance with him at the platform
[39:46] and now we were having a just a
[39:50] profound effect upon me and other
[39:54] ministers and he said
[39:58] he said as we drove down the highway we
[40:01] started coming to the town of Fort St
[40:04] John which laid up to the right hand of
[40:07] the
[40:08] highway and there was an entrance into
[40:11] Fort St John when the US Army cut just
[40:14] through the
[40:16] Farmland The
[40:17] Farmhouse was just up to the right maybe
[40:20] 100 150 yards and I had noticed that
[40:24] house so many times in my youth and
[40:27] childhood and just a big old white
[40:31] farmhouse and as brother brandom as we
[40:35] he slowed down for the speed
[40:39] limit and was just driving slowly he
[40:44] said there was a woman that came in the
[40:47] prayer line yesterday praying for a man
[40:49] from Fort St John oh I said brother
[40:53] brandham she's a very good friend of my
[40:56] parents
[40:57] her name is sister clunt and I know her
[41:00] well and and I knew
[41:02] her I was there on the on the platform
[41:06] and she was standing there and he was
[41:09] telling her these things now here we are
[41:11] driving and the house is just over here
[41:14] to my right and he said he just serious
[41:19] he he he he was in a different frame of
[41:23] mind you'd say and uh he just said as we
[41:28] were driving past the house was going by
[41:31] so he swung his arm this way and pointed
[41:33] behind my head he said the man is in
[41:36] that
[41:37] house well I was
[41:40] shocked I was startled but I didn't know
[41:43] that the man was in that house I didn't
[41:45] know his name or
[41:47] anything
[41:49] and we we continued on the
[41:52] road up to Fort Nelson and Beyond up to
[41:56] brother bud southw wi's
[41:59] Place brother Bud Southwick was just a
[42:02] new new Christian he had been saved in
[42:06] my
[42:07] church uh about a year before I was so
[42:11] anxious to acquaint him with spiritual
[42:15] things he was just uh he raised horses
[42:18] and he rode in h in the rodeos and
[42:24] things and so he didn't know anything he
[42:27] didn't know Genesis from Revelation he
[42:29] just didn't know the Bible so I wanted
[42:31] to acquaint him with what a prophet was
[42:35] I said when we went by that house I said
[42:39] brother Brandon pointed to it and said
[42:42] the man is in that house I said you know
[42:44] Sister Clint she was on the platform
[42:47] praying for
[42:49] him and and brother Southwick my friend
[42:54] he said oh I know him he's had his name
[42:57] is Ed Thomas I've known him ever since
[42:59] I've been about 8 years old and uh so
[43:02] now I had it on the
[43:05] platform on the
[43:07] highway and with brother South
[43:10] wake this was all within 24 hours it was
[43:14] like a just a divine intervention of God
[43:19] saying I will cause you to believe I
[43:22] will bring it right in front of you I
[43:25] will bring it it was so arranged I just
[43:29] could not doubt
[43:30] it I guess it was
[43:33] the grace of God to me that was
[43:37] anchoring my faith and I just couldn't
[43:40] there was one day and the next day and
[43:43] the next day and I do not know whether
[43:46] it was in that particular service where
[43:49] brother Brenham
[43:52] spoke and all of the service was not
[43:55] taped apparently
[43:57] but anyway I was standing and I'll never
[44:00] forget this I was standing on the
[44:03] platform right beside me on my right
[44:06] hand side was standing brother Paul
[44:09] Cornish the
[44:11] pastor in the church in Grand Prairie
[44:15] and he was he was just standing there
[44:17] was a very he was taller than I was he
[44:20] very
[44:21] dignified very
[44:24] scholarly and uh a man that didn't show
[44:27] a lot of emotion but he was standing
[44:30] there and brother brandham was
[44:32] facing not facing us he had his back to
[44:36] us and to the prayer line was going down
[44:39] the wall this time and up this
[44:42] way and uh while we were just standing
[44:45] there brother Venom I can't explain this
[44:48] this is so strange but he just lifted
[44:52] his head this way and cried out the boy
[44:55] be all right
[44:58] and a force went by me it was like a
[45:02] wind but it wasn't a wind it was just a
[45:05] power a force just went by me but I was
[45:09] conscious of it and and I was bewildered
[45:11] I don't what's happening the boy will be
[45:14] all right and Paul Cornish brother Paul
[45:18] Cornish
[45:20] collapses over and is in convulsing
[45:25] tears and I don't know what's happening
[45:28] here he's the voice the
[45:31] force so unusual while he's just talking
[45:34] to somebody in front of him and
[45:38] uh and and here's brother Paul Cornish
[45:42] what do you do when somebody's you know
[45:44] crying and convulsing I didn't know
[45:46] whether to pray with him or what to do
[45:49] then he straightened up after he
[45:52] collected himself he nudged me and he
[45:56] said brother ready he said you see down
[45:59] the prayer line towards the end said
[46:02] young
[46:03] lad that's standing there he said that's
[46:06] my son and he's up for a serious
[46:10] operation next
[46:12] week and to have to have those kind of
[46:15] things I I just became aware of another
[46:18] realm I became aware of Another Place
[46:22] Another Dimension this man was not just
[46:25] ministering to the people but it was
[46:28] like he was he was in contact with
[46:31] another world the boy will be all right
[46:34] and he just continues on and uh I I
[46:38] don't know anything of the lad what
[46:41] happened after that but I that was just
[46:44] a very very strange and very unusual
[46:49] event uh for me
[46:53] [Music]
[47:12] [Music]
[47:27] h
[47:28] [Music]
[47:56] oh
[47:58] [Music]
[48:28] I was in my home in Victoria British
[48:31] Columbia when I received a phone call
[48:34] from brother brandham and he was saying
[48:37] that I believe we're going to have a
[48:40] good hunt brother Eddie we're going to
[48:42] have a good hunt I had a dream or a
[48:45] vision and he began to tell me a little
[48:48] bit about it and uh said that he would
[48:51] give me the full details when we met so
[48:55] when we met in Dawson Creek he said I
[48:57] had this dream or Vision he said if it
[49:00] was a vision it'll happen exactly like
[49:03] that and in the vision he said there
[49:06] were two or three small fellows on the
[49:10] hunt I had arranged the hunt and there
[49:13] was only three of us including brother
[49:17] brandham brother Bud Southwick brother
[49:20] brandham and myself we were the three
[49:23] brother southwick's son Blaine was not a
[49:26] able to go on the hunt because he was in
[49:29] the far north in the Arctic on a survey
[49:32] crew and would not be able to be back
[49:35] for the hunt
[49:37] well uh
[49:40] so I thought well maybe it was just a
[49:43] dream I don't know but brother brandom
[49:46] said we saw I saw this large animal and
[49:49] its horns kind of went back on its head
[49:52] and I said oh that may be a caribou he
[49:55] said well I don't know I haven't seen a
[49:58] caribou before but he said this was a
[50:00] dark chocolate brown animal I said no I
[50:04] said Caribou are like Battleship
[50:09] Gray and he said well no this was
[50:12] chocolate brown and he wouldn't he
[50:14] wouldn't stray from that description at
[50:17] all it was a dark chocolate brown animal
[50:21] so then uh he said uh there was uh in
[50:25] this in this Vision or dream I saw one
[50:30] of the young men his hands were like
[50:33] this he said and they were spread out he
[50:36] said there was no hair on the arms on
[50:39] the hands he said I would say and he
[50:42] kind of stopped like that looked up he
[50:44] said probably about
[50:47] 18 18 years old now I would like to
[50:51] encourage the viewers to be real
[50:54] attentive to the detail
[50:57] because this Vision was 6 hours in the
[51:02] Fulfillment and uh he said one of my one
[51:06] of my buddies was in a a green checkered
[51:11] shirt well I had had a green checkered
[51:14] shirt and I had told my wife to before
[51:17] the hunt I said just throw that away
[51:20] because it had been tore and sewn
[51:23] several times around here on the pocket
[51:25] my husband was going hunting he had
[51:29] this pretty good shirt green checkered
[51:33] shirt but it had it was torn around the
[51:37] pocket and I had mended it several times
[51:42] and he
[51:43] said go and get me another shirt it was
[51:47] a nice shirt dokin
[51:49] soft nice hunting
[51:52] shirt and I said okay but I just didn't
[51:56] have time I didn't have a car I had the
[51:58] little girls you have to take a bus into
[52:02] town so I mended it again the best I
[52:07] could and I put it into his duffel bag
[52:12] and away he went when we got up to
[52:14] Dawson Creek I asked brother Venom if he
[52:17] would tell the vision to my father so he
[52:21] related the whole Vision that this dark
[52:24] chocolate brown animal and and he had
[52:27] gotten that animal and had gotten
[52:30] another uh a grizzly bear at the same
[52:33] time and for me that was a shock I
[52:37] thought I had lived in the north I had
[52:40] never gotten a grizzly bear myself and I
[52:43] thought that was
[52:44] outstanding and then we journeyed on the
[52:47] way up the Alaskan Highway to brother
[52:49] Bud southwick's place and when we drove
[52:53] into the yard here all the children came
[52:56] came out and including Blaine his son
[52:59] who was supposed to be in the Arctic and
[53:01] I said well your Blaine I thought you
[53:04] were away up and you wouldn't be able to
[53:06] go on this hunt well he said he just
[53:08] came back a couple of days ago and I
[53:12] asked brother Southwick will Blaine be
[53:14] able to come on the hunt well yeah he
[53:17] thought he better come on the hunt with
[53:19] us
[53:21] so suddenly now I saw that we were two
[53:25] or three little fellows on the trip and
[53:31] uh Blaine was fixing a little harness on
[53:35] the side of one of the buildings and I
[53:38] was standing there with him just the two
[53:40] of us and I asked him I said Blain how
[53:42] old are you he said 18 why I said well I
[53:46] was just curious to know now we had a
[53:49] young fellow and he was 18 years old and
[53:52] myself and when brother brandham was
[53:55] giving the Vision I asked him to tell
[53:58] brother Southwick and his family at the
[54:00] supper table tell him about the vision
[54:04] so he got to the dark chocolate brown
[54:06] animal I said brother bud I always
[54:11] thought that Caribou was a dark uh
[54:14] Battleship Gray well he said you know
[54:18] that is strange he said all every
[54:21] Caribou that I've seen on the north side
[54:23] of the highway the Alaskan Highway way
[54:27] has been a kind of a Battleship Gray and
[54:31] he used the same words he said and there
[54:34] are a bush caribou and all the Caribou
[54:37] on the south side and the west of the
[54:41] highway has been uh mountain caribou and
[54:45] they're kind of a dark chocolate brown
[54:48] color and I said well where are we going
[54:51] he said well we're going on the south
[54:52] side of the highway so things were
[54:56] coming together and I there was more
[54:59] weight to it being a vision than there
[55:02] being a dream and
[55:04] I the only thing was a young man with a
[55:09] chocolate or with a checkered
[55:11] shirt and when we got up to make our
[55:17] camp we made our camp and way down the
[55:22] valley it would be to my right
[55:26] we saw that on the skyline there were a
[55:30] few caribou and some Mountain
[55:33] shape and so brother Southwick said well
[55:38] tomorrow I think that we should probably
[55:40] go up there it was probably 2 three
[55:43] miles and
[55:45] uh so the next day we made our way up
[55:50] there and we got up on the Ridge and uh
[55:54] we ran into a few caribou and they
[55:57] scattered and one ran down this way and
[56:01] so I went on my we all split up and
[56:06] Blaine went One Direction and brother
[56:08] brandom and Bud went another Direction
[56:10] and I went One Direction and I found a
[56:14] young caribou and I I was needing meat
[56:17] and I shot that caribou and it was just
[56:21] dark chocolate brown and so Blaine came
[56:24] by and we dressed that Caribou out and
[56:28] then we went back and met together and
[56:31] then we climbed up on a Mountain Ridge
[56:34] and brother Brenham said on this in this
[56:37] Vision there was a great panoramic and
[56:41] he moved his arm this way and he said on
[56:44] this great panoramic and then he says my
[56:48] friend in the checkered shirt was way
[56:51] down this way towards camp and Camp was
[56:55] 2 three miles this Direction and he said
[56:58] he was waiting there and on the way
[57:02] there uh he said I got this large
[57:05] Caribou dark chocolate
[57:08] brown and he said on the way then we saw
[57:11] a grizzly bear on the mountain and God
[57:15] gave me that animal in one
[57:18] shot and I was just kind of
[57:23] speechless and uh then
[57:27] while the vision was being
[57:29] fulfilled we sat on this Ridge and I
[57:32] just looked at this beautiful
[57:35] panoramic I can say that I wasn't really
[57:38] conscious of every detail of the vision
[57:42] but it it was just we were caught up in
[57:44] the in the beauty of the moment and the
[57:47] great mountain peaks on this side on the
[57:49] left side and spurring off onto a ridges
[57:54] and we were ate our LUN on this one
[57:57] Ridge and brother brandham said what is
[58:00] that over there brother bud
[58:03] and he took his
[58:06] binoculars there was two
[58:09] great Caribou animals Bulls laying on a
[58:13] mountain
[58:14] glacier I think laying on a glacier
[58:17] because there was less
[58:18] bugs and there it's very nice and cool
[58:22] and they were laying there and kind of
[58:25] sleeping I I think and so brother Bud
[58:28] laid out a plan and he said well Blaine
[58:32] he said why don't you take brother Eddie
[58:35] and take the horses and go and get his
[58:39] meat and then Journey down this way to
[58:42] this Dry Creek bed and wait for us and
[58:46] we'll come down and meet you so I
[58:50] suggested that we wait till we see if
[58:53] they got this animal which in about
[58:56] another half hour they did and I came up
[58:59] over the Ridge and got this
[59:02] large uh Cariboo bull animal and so then
[59:06] we went and got my meat and we journeyed
[59:09] down here to this Dry Creek bed towards
[59:14] Camp which was strange that
[59:18] morning when we had just left the
[59:22] tent I fell into a creek and I got my my
[59:26] clothes wet and I said to the brothers
[59:29] just wait here and I will run home I'll
[59:32] run back to the tent which was a short
[59:35] very short distance and I I and I opened
[59:39] up my duffel bag and there was this
[59:41] green checkered shirt and when he got up
[59:44] hunting and had that little mishap in
[59:48] the water and had to go back to the tent
[59:51] and open up his bag and there was the
[59:54] green checkered shirt
[59:56] and he said I told Ruth to get me a new
[1:00:00] shirt and she didn't do it but I didn't
[1:00:05] know that it was all a part of the
[1:00:07] vision you just do things without even
[1:00:11] thinking that there's anything
[1:00:13] spiritual tied to it and I put it on and
[1:00:17] that's the shirt I had I had a green
[1:00:19] checkered shirt the vision and all of
[1:00:21] the
[1:00:22] details just it was not in my mind
[1:00:26] whatsoever I was cold and wet and I
[1:00:29] changed and and uh then I ran up to
[1:00:32] catch up with the other brothers and
[1:00:34] away we went so when we went down to
[1:00:37] this Dry Creek bed I had on that
[1:00:41] checkered
[1:00:43] chir we waited Blaine and I we waited
[1:00:46] for
[1:00:47] about half an hour two an hour and
[1:00:51] Blaine said if they're not here in about
[1:00:54] another half hour he said I'm going to
[1:00:56] go and find them and in the vision I was
[1:01:00] alone waiting for
[1:01:04] them in another half hour they still
[1:01:07] weren't there he said so I'm going to go
[1:01:09] and see if I can meet up with them
[1:01:12] because we didn't know what had happened
[1:01:15] we didn't know whether we missed them
[1:01:17] somehow or whatever so he leaves and now
[1:01:21] I'm waiting alone and I was waiting
[1:01:24] about another half hour and then I heard
[1:01:26] some
[1:01:27] voices and I just took a few steps to
[1:01:31] the trail and here came brother Bud
[1:01:34] carrying this big Caribou on his head on
[1:01:38] his shoulders rather we come all the way
[1:01:40] down that cck but I'm packing that
[1:01:43] Caribou cape in the head you
[1:01:47] know and he kept watching for this this
[1:01:52] grizzly well you know it was like
[1:01:54] looking on the side of that Hill up
[1:01:56] there only he want that bush on it you
[1:01:59] know just that Short Grass it was just
[1:02:02] no bear there that's all and all all at
[1:02:06] once we getting for near to where you
[1:02:09] guys
[1:02:10] was and I'd give give it up really you
[1:02:14] see a Grizzly you know finally we were
[1:02:18] sitting down resting again and he
[1:02:21] pointed up there on the side the hill
[1:02:23] and he said what what's that up there
[1:02:27] he knew what I
[1:02:29] didn't soon as I glimpsed up there I
[1:02:33] knew it was the bear so I said you know
[1:02:36] and it was a silver tip and it was about
[1:02:39] the same color as an old R milk cow I
[1:02:41] had and I said man M looks like my own
[1:02:47] mil yeah up went when he said he would
[1:02:51] shoot it you know to me it was like him
[1:02:55] shooting from here up to the top of that
[1:02:58] Cliff up there or better better than
[1:03:01] that I had no idea he he would shoot
[1:03:05] that far and I I I wouldn't have let
[1:03:07] anybody else shoot that far anyway you
[1:03:09] know they could have crippled something
[1:03:11] R all
[1:03:12] but but we had no time to to go around
[1:03:16] and come up from the back of that
[1:03:17] mountain it took us a day and so I said
[1:03:22] to him I said we'll have to let that
[1:03:24] bear go tonight come back after him
[1:03:28] tomorrow we can't get you can't get any
[1:03:30] closer this way he looking right down at
[1:03:35] us and oh he said I I can kill him here

[1:03:41] said I doubted that really cuz I hadn't
[1:03:45] seen him you know shoot that much that
[1:03:47] carriable we right on top of that when
[1:03:49] he shot
[1:03:52] that boy when he shot that old bear
[1:03:56] just was
[1:03:58] coming he he pulled that gun up and it
[1:04:03] sna man my hair stood right
[1:04:07] up that was after the first shot
[1:04:11] yeah that bear was coming he
[1:04:15] fell oh he that big big popper over
[1:04:19] there from us like and right even with
[1:04:22] us like that too he fell in that short
[1:04:25] Shank to go

[1:04:33] all dead
[1:04:35] is so he did but he was dead as could be
[1:04:40] you

[1:04:44] that going to be too late we
[1:04:47] wouldn't skin that bear out that night
[1:04:50] well I never dreamt you know leaving the
[1:04:53] trophy overnight
[1:04:55] you old bear could have come along tore
[1:04:57] that all the pieces but that's the first
[1:04:59] thing we thought about you know leave it
[1:05:02] leave it till
[1:05:03] tomorrow every every word that he said
[1:05:06] come just as true as true could be the
[1:05:09] pth you know you never even thought
[1:05:10] about it at the time but you thinking of
[1:05:12] it afterward I ran up to brother
[1:05:14] brandham brother Bram was standing there
[1:05:16] I said I put my hand out to shake his
[1:05:19] hand I said congratulations brother
[1:05:21] brandom that's that's a lovely animal he
[1:05:24] said uh
[1:05:26] I got a bear
[1:05:27] too and I just tapped him on the
[1:05:30] shoulder I said oh you didn't get a bear
[1:05:33] the same day he said yeah I did and I I
[1:05:37] felt strange I said well where is it and
[1:05:41] Bud said well we're not able to carry it
[1:05:44] he said the hide would probably wear
[1:05:46] three weigh 300 lb and I said well and I
[1:05:50] felt real strange and Bud walked over to
[1:05:53] his saddle horse which which was right
[1:05:56] there and went into the saddle bag and
[1:06:01] brought out a little round
[1:06:03] tape with a push button on the side and
[1:06:07] I was kind of amused I had lived in the
[1:06:10] wilderness all my life and had hunted
[1:06:13] and never saw anybody carry a tape and
[1:06:16] then I thought well he's a guide now
[1:06:19] probably he's interested in you know the
[1:06:21] size of the horns Etc and he brought out
[1:06:25] this little steel tape and he put it
[1:06:27] right down at the base of the horns
[1:06:30] there a little Ridge there and he hooked
[1:06:33] the tape there and then the tape went
[1:06:35] into this curve and then
[1:06:39] around and every time he started to go
[1:06:42] around the bottom flicked out and then
[1:06:45] it so he started it again and followed
[1:06:49] it around trying to measure it correctly
[1:06:51] and it flicked out about the third time
[1:06:54] he says to a son
[1:06:57] Blaine hold that tape in there and so
[1:07:00] Blaine knelt down on one knee and spread
[1:07:03] his hands Out 18yearold Boy and then I I
[1:07:07] begin to feel real strange held his
[1:07:10] hands out and brother Bud pulled the
[1:07:13] tape around and brother brandham said in
[1:07:15] the vision he just heard a voice saying
[1:07:18] it's 42 Ines and that was
[1:07:22] it and
[1:07:24] I I put my
[1:07:27] head Blaine looked up while he was
[1:07:30] holding the tape brother Bud he held his
[1:07:33] head over the tape to make sure where
[1:07:37] the black line and the black line of 42
[1:07:40] in fell at the last point of the horn
[1:07:45] and he said it's 42
[1:07:47] in and I I just felt
[1:07:51] overwhelmed and brother brandham he did
[1:07:53] not look he just stood there ereck and I
[1:07:57] was right B on his shoulder and he just
[1:08:00] said he said there it
[1:08:03] is it was all over and the grizzly was
[1:08:07] laying up on the mountain and there
[1:08:10] there the horn was and the vision was
[1:08:12] over that took
[1:08:14] about 6 hours in total for the whole
[1:08:19] Vision a dark chocolate brown
[1:08:22] animal and uh I'm standing there in a
[1:08:25] green checkered
[1:08:26] chart and uh the vision was completely
[1:08:32] fulfilled and I can say to all who hear
[1:08:36] this is a true
