[26:08] foreign
[26:15] hey man you all may be seated
[26:18] at this time we have
[26:20] a poem for my brother julian and our
[26:22] special from our sister rachel
[26:33] hello everyone god bless you i have
[26:35] another poem
[26:37] song for you today
[26:38] um and
[26:39] one of these days i'll give one of these
[26:42] poems songs live
[26:44] uh when i'm brave enough but uh today is
[26:46] not that day
[26:48] so
[26:49] so i'm gonna keep doing these little
[26:50] voice recording uh ones as long as i
[26:53] possibly can and then one of these days
[26:55] i will be brave enough to give it but
[26:57] when that moment comes
[26:59] the rapture may be happening the very
[27:00] next day so you all better be ready
[27:03] but um
[27:04] i like to give a little bit of a
[27:05] background on these pieces that the lord
[27:07] inspires me with because i think it kind
[27:09] of helps to see uh where he was coming
[27:12] from when he gave gave these to me and
[27:14] um i really enjoyed sharing that so this
[27:16] was actually inspired to me uh last
[27:19] night and um
[27:21] the
[27:22] piece when i was giving it i heard
[27:24] another tune again and it sounded like
[27:26] an irishman and this irishman who was
[27:28] singing when i heard it i saw this
[27:31] um i saw him like out on a field a wide
[27:34] open field and he was a farmer and he
[27:37] was
[27:38] farming to what i can assume would be
[27:40] potatoes
[27:41] and uh
[27:42] he was just out there
[27:44] humming this this hymn of sorts or this
[27:47] lament really
[27:48] um and that's where the piece came from
[27:50] and for those of you who don't know what
[27:51] a lament is it's basically just like a
[27:53] sad song
[27:54] um and uh when i got to writing it
[27:58] um
[27:59] the the piece was initially inspired by
[28:01] the concept of old nature versus new
[28:03] nature but it started to dive into the
[28:05] people who have gone on before us and uh
[28:08] whether that would be people who have
[28:09] passed on or people who have left and we
[28:11] no longer see any more and that would be
[28:13] people who have left the church or or
[28:15] things like that and i think about that
[28:16] a lot actually i think about those
[28:18] people
[28:19] a lot and so
[28:21] this piece is really written for them
[28:23] and um it is it is titled uh a land far
[28:27] beyond and i hope that you all enjoy it
[28:29] and that it blesses you and uh there
[28:31] will be probably an accent on this one
[28:33] so just be expecting that but uh here we
[28:36] go
[28:39] i fare in this new labor
[28:42] for that world beyond
[28:45] an earth that is clearer
[28:49] than this world i'm on
[28:52] a land that never fails or hers
[28:56] beauty not glow strong
[28:58] that land of milk and honey
[29:02] that land that's so foregone
[29:05] be made a new nature
[29:08] the old one the deceiver
[29:12] walk tall your visions clearer
[29:15] the lord bring thee believer
[29:18] i long to see men holy
[29:22] so we may sing this song
[29:25] this song of those who labor for that
[29:29] land they're far beyond
[29:32] they say i am a fisher for whom those
[29:36] men belong
[29:38] fish for our redeemer
[29:42] for he doth surely long
[29:45] to have the ever closer
[29:48] you sons and daughters lost come home to
[29:53] the defender
[29:55] the end he doth prolong
[29:58] be made a new creature the old one the
[30:03] deceiver
[30:05] walk tall your vision clearer
[30:08] the lord bring thee believer
[30:11] i long to see men holy so we may sing
[30:16] this song
[30:18] this song of those who labor for that
[30:22] land they're far beyond
[30:25] this song of those who labor for that
[30:29] land they're far beyond

[45:19] this is a very peculiar scripture
[45:25] you might say brother what does this
[45:27] scripture have to do with success
[45:42] not everyone that says that to me lord
[45:44] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[45:45] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[45:47] father which is in heaven
[46:02] many will say to me in that day lord
[46:04] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[46:06] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[46:08] in thy name done many wonderful works
[46:16] and then while i profess unto them i
[46:19] never knew you depart from me he that
[46:22] worked
[46:26] saint john chapter 6
[46:29] 6 38.
[46:34] i'm going to ask you to stand if you
[46:35] would
[46:39] thank you
[47:08] for i came down from heaven
[47:14] not to do my own will
[47:18] but the will of him that sent me
[47:22] let us pray
[47:34] show us your will
[47:50] for each one
[48:16] that you will
[48:17] hide them from every bad
[49:01] in the tabernacle of las cruces new
[49:03] mexico
[49:05] i am going to reveal
[49:09] i'm going to tell you a secret
[49:12] that will make you a multi-millionaire
[49:16] today on wednesday
[49:18] i will assure you
[49:21] that this place would be full
[49:26] all the internet the social media they
[49:56] do
[49:59] how much it's
[50:01] i want to pray
[50:03] and if i don't have the money
[50:06] i will borrow it
[50:09] i want to know that secret oh yes
[50:12] today the secret is
[50:16] will be shared
[50:18] san diego is impressed without money and
[50:21] without price cindinaro is impressive
[50:24] without money
[50:37] i want you to give me your undivided
[50:39] attention
[50:44] when jesus
[50:45] talks
[50:47] and when we see his life
[50:50] at the last time
[50:52] jesus i talked last time that jesus
[50:59] did not have what you call a successful
[51:02] because he did a lot
[51:05] because he did a lot of healing
[51:17] [Applause]
[51:19] everyone would say
[51:33] they all love jesus
[51:37] [Applause]
[51:47] jesus never was supportive
[52:02] jesus teaches us
[52:05] in saint john 6 38
[52:08] what we read
[52:11] or i came down from heaven
[52:16] not to do mine
[52:29] he started praying for the sick
[52:34] he started doing surprising things
[52:38] he started stopping the storm
[52:42] he walked upon the water
[54:08] there was
[54:36] not
[55:03] oh what a terrible
[55:18] god
[55:58] and many in that day will will tell me
[56:14] matthew 7 21
[56:20] and normally when i have heard it
[56:24] the majority of times
[56:27] they are preachers
[56:45] or people that god has given precious
[56:48] gifts for the church
[56:53] and maybe they don't have enough
[56:55] knowledge
[56:59] and then they'll say well many in that
[57:02] day will say lord i prophesied
[57:05] thanks be to god for a prophet
[57:10] because i don't believe that the word
[57:12] prophesy here
[57:15] will be just to speak by inspiration
[57:20] prophesy brothers
[57:22] in the new testament
[57:38] then we do
[57:53] they'll throw this out but
[57:55] but they don't explain it
[58:00] they just say in verse 21.
[58:03] and no one understands
[58:06] oh maybe
[58:18] but let us not take a scripture out of
[58:20] context
[58:37] not everyone that saved him to me lord
[58:39] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[58:42] but he that do it
[58:47] the will of my father which is in heaven
[58:54] what does jesus say
[58:58] who will enter into the kingdom of
[58:59] heaven
[59:01] those that do miracles prophetess those
[59:04] the prophets
[59:05] those that heal no no no
[59:07] no
[59:09] to the kingdom of heaven
[59:15] or by doing healing
[59:44] john
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:11] that was born of a woman
[1:01:34] these pharisees would come to see john
[1:01:37] no my hero juan mirandos
[1:01:39] i can imagine john looking at him and
[1:01:41] saying
[1:01:43] oh the axe is already playing
[1:01:46] to the root of the tree
[1:01:49] and the tree that does not
[1:02:30] it was to introduce the messiah
[1:02:56] all i saw him was journey
[1:02:59] through the desert
[1:03:12] of the will of god
[1:03:55] can we do miracles
[1:05:13] [Applause]
[1:05:30] john 4 34.
[1:05:45] jesus said unto them
[1:05:48] escaga
[1:05:52] jesus saith unto them
[1:05:54] my need is to do the will of him that
[1:05:57] sent me
[1:05:59] and to what
[1:06:02] and to
[1:06:16] but the
[1:06:58] the
[1:07:12] that jesus said here
[1:07:14] and many ah
[1:07:17] that day many will say
[1:07:25] lord in your name
[1:08:07] he will go with you
[1:08:22] they
[1:08:34] brother i pray and god doesn't answer my
[1:08:36] prayers
[1:08:40] there are people that have 10 20 years
[1:08:43] and they're stuck
[1:08:46] they cannot grow
[1:08:49] because they are always
[1:09:04] which
[1:09:17] will maybe
[1:09:18] raise up but somebody that will have a
[1:09:21] big business
[1:09:26] god blesses him
[1:09:30] and then everyone else will say
[1:10:27] of what god is doing through your life
[1:10:29] [Applause]
[1:10:32] you maybe might see a minister that's
[1:10:35] spiritual you know
[1:10:37] and you might see him doing this
[1:10:39] and god bless him
[1:10:41] and another minute
[1:10:56] miracles
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:24] but this
[1:11:35] you have at your disposal to make it
[1:11:54] and during this campaign never have one
[1:11:56] defeat or one soldier die or any of that
[1:11:59] man
[1:12:02] i did not have an answer to that
[1:12:06] until i understood this
[1:12:10] when you are in the purpose
