[48:35] with it but uh is how fast fear can
[48:37] start it again again I fear that we will
[48:39] do more for them discipline our faith
[48:41] has to be based upon something Lystra
[48:44] arte de Saavedra que estar Posadas over
[48:46] l go and that is the scriptures yes is
[48:49] life everybody get your Bibles would you
[48:51] have them I hope you bring them liable
[48:53] to church but okay try those who really
[48:54] Glacia the scriptures that is clear to
[48:56] us God in print form your informant
[48:59] print and our faith has to be based upon
[49:01] this you know so finicky star Posadas
[49:03] readiness to me as something so
[49:05] tremendous - for a reason cotton
[49:06] tremendo that that we cannot use
[49:08] anything without the scripture you know
[49:10] most of them are seen as discrete to us
[49:12] if we are their sin in our lives easier
[49:14] example is protect because understand I
[49:16] believe as I heard the other day a man
[49:18] say this mosquitoes will yo nombre
[49:19] disease the reason that that many people
[49:21] have a hard time understanding the
[49:24] vision of the tent
[49:25] okay Mucha gente tiene problemas in
[49:28] tenido la vision de la casa because
[49:29] first of all they have failed to real
[49:31] lives because promote oppose young Fidel
[49:33] and does it better
[49:34] every major vision at the profit has
[49:36] because you're my daughter to a
[49:38] professor is scriptural it is going to
[49:40] run and when you try to understand those
[49:43] visions without the scriptures that
[49:45] repent and there is not visually sinless
[49:47] you'll never understand them signal
[49:49] until now can you understand the vision
[49:51] of the tent comb opener a very lovely
[49:53] she owns the like without understanding
[49:55] the Feast of the Tabernacles in their
[49:57] luckiest I discover impossible
[49:59] impossible eres scripture verses the
[50:01] Torah
[50:01] now everything it's gotta be based upon
[50:03] something old in the case of asados over
[50:05] Alvin and waters what does it do
[50:07] Jesse it brings us to an understanding
[50:10] Nostra unintended means that the
[50:12] Scriptures can never be broken you'll
[50:14] ask you to does no political advisors
[50:16] can never fail you know whether by yeah
[50:18] because God can never fail videos no
[50:20] quitter for ya now we see this is very
[50:22] puzzling that many times the most
[50:24] available truth that Jesus that all
[50:27] scripture must be fulfilled
[50:29] yes you do spiritualist indicator
[50:30] complete not some of it no alguna but
