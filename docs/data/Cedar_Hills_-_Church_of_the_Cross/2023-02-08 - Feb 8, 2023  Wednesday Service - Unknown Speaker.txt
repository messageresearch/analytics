Alta garage if you will please open your Bibles to Acts chapter 16. we're going to be speaking about something that happens is be comfortable however you would like to be Acts chapter 16 starting with verse 22. this is I'm going to give you a little bit of time there it is acts 16 Verse 22 starting this is the magistrates rent up their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prisoners to keep them safely and he received such a church them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and they I'm saying Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open that came through the Apostle Paul to write these words to open these words to us that we might see Lord that you are the same yesterday today and forever we confine your word in the name of the Lord Jesus God bless you you may be seated his family wherever they might find themselves just about five or ten minutes you will give me your full attention I want to bring you to this scene tonight and then we begin to read a new momentum in a moment when Paul said this is the scripture says that they they were equipped with many times it doesn't say that they were hurt one time but many many times you see that they were wounded they were bleeding that they had been hurt they will put there in the most inner part of the prison not in just any place to put him in the very most General worst part of the jail in a place where there was no light it was so humid in that place where the wind would come in was much strength it was dripping water there where they were at the humidity that was in that place made it such a terrible place and they put stocks on their hands and on their feet that's where they found themselves but the Bible says but because they were suffering for the cause of the Gospel they were praising God but here is the key is many people praise God but they don't receive anything they teach us the correctness and receive the answer of God yes and that was to have the correct attitude does not look at the circumstances Cyrus you'll come to the service your prayer service but it was a 15.5 earthquake on the record the scripture says it shook the foundations the more
