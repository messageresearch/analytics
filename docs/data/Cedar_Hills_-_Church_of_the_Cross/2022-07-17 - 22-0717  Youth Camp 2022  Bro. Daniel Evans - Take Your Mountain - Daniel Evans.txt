daniel evans for him to come and bring us what the lord has in his heart that saved a wretch like me i once was lost but now i'm found [Music] how sweet the sound that saved the rich like me i once was [Music] grace was my heart oh first [Music] when we [Music] necessity microphone amen what did they do without microphones in the past greetings to you all in the name of the lord jesus christ he welcomes that sweet holy spirit but i wanted to be out here to hear the songs and to hear these young people singing can you imagine the army of joshua as he walked as they marched through the promised land and it gave me strength this morning i needed it god bless you all almighty god we approach you in the name of your son jesus christ [Music] it's b a blessing this morning did everybody get to sleep by 11 o'clock last night [Music] you didn't no uh i i was in i was in cabin number nine over here and uh i won't name their names but uh brother paul brother tim brother tommy jr and brother adolfo and he said that we are all going to an eternal youth camp so it's coming one day that we will go to that eternal youth champion this kid beat me at ping pong the other day i had to get back at him did you enjoy the mata brothers on on friday night man i was so blessed to see these young men that have given their hearts to the lord jesus that have dedicated their life to serving the lord and the leading souls to christ and making sacrifices and then last night i was blessed by my brother vidal and brother carlos i'll tell you if i was joshua and i was about to go over jordan i would want those two brothers on my team brother carlos he's he's going back and forth and he's preaching that you have to have love carlos and if you don't have love i'll beat it into you know uh [Music] brother caleb and you're going to have this brother priest of the young people but he did a wonderful job and i i loved the enthusiasm a man i thought about about him and if caleb was choosing a man to go up and fight one of these giants and he sees the biggest giant up there and he says i think i'll send better vidal and then maybe brother vidal's brethren said he says a familiar scripture chapter 14. a as the lord commanded moses so the children of israel did and they divided the land then the children of judah came under joshua and gilgal and caleb the son of jefun the king canozite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me foreign 40 years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from cadesparnia to spy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god and moses swear on that day saying surely the land wherein thy feet have troddened shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god the lord that my god and and now behold the lord hath kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the lord spake this word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day for score and five years is as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war or to go out and to come in today now therefore give me this mountain where the lord spake in that day for thou heard us in that day how the anakins were there and that their and that the cities were great and fenced if so the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said name remember friends caleb had to ask for that mountain was given to him and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jeffoon hebron for inheritance hebrew therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of jefun the kingzide unto this day because that he wholly followed the lord god of israel was a great man among the anakins and the land had rest from war was as we go through this morning friends many times brother caleb has asked me to give testimonies about the prophet brother branham and i enjoyed doing that my family was close friends with brother branham [Music] amigos and i've heard many many stories about this prophet of god and the mighty things that god did through him in his ministry when i was working for voice of god the power went out one day so we didn't have anything to do so we all gathered into one room joseph asked brother billy he said billy tell us something about daddy [Music] brother billy he said he said you know he says i was the closest he said i traveled around the world with him i was with him in every service he said daddy would tell me things as we traveled as we talked that no one else knew and i think about brother branham and i think about what brother carlos was saying last night and what is the greatest thing is it the power to speak storms and friends the reason that brother branham's ministry was so great is because he had that love and he gets so much criticism people dissect everything that he said and we try to find fault in it let me tell you something if half of what brother branham preached wasn't wasn't right about the seals or the ages or anything like that i would still believe him because that man has the spirit of christ but what he said is right though brother branham was an example to all of us and we may not be able to speak storms away [Music] and we've there's also failures he said joshua and caleb when they said oh we look like grasshoppers on side of them joshua and caleb said we can do it that's right god promised we could do it god said we could do it god promised our fathers that we were going to that land and they look like giants and everything else he quit looking at giants and started looking at god's word and when men and women quit looking at their sickness and diseases amen all things are subject to jesus christ and all things are subject to your prayer when you ask in his name and this is 45 years before joshua gave that mountain to caleb and god instructed moses he said to send two spies over into this promised land foreign these spies they went over jordan and they went to these mountains to this hill country and they saw that it was a good land but they saw that there were giants there were mighty warriors on that side and they saw that there were cities like jericho that had giant walls around them and they said how could we take this land it's impossible it's impossible so they came back over these twelve men and they gave a report to the people [Music] and they said let's let's read the scriptures in numbers let's go to numbers 1432 i came over and they said this and there we saw giants the son of anak which come up the giants and we were in our own sight grasshoppers and so we were in their sight so they came over to saturn and they tell the people because we felt like we were weak we were grasshoppers in their sights nosotros because god is us and it got the people stirred up and it got the people discouraged and they said we can't do it and it angered god it angered god so much that he said you will die in this land you will not go over into this promised land because you're afraid because you don't have faith in me and me am i not able to do this am i not able to conquer those giants but the people did not have faith in god and they failed is the greatest battle ever fought it's the battle and god and these men [Music] and then god's word held true that for 40 years these these men and these women wandered in the wilderness all of these children of israel and they died wandering in the wilderness and then god raised up another generation this generation wasn't with the prophet moses when he turned the nile red to blood this generation was not with the prophet when the red sea parted this generation was not in egypt when the plagues came this generation was not [Music] and this generation had far more faith in that generation where is that generation today [Music] [Applause] that will go over they were afraid of these giants gigantes but you know they thought that they were grasshoppers hey [Music] when we see giants godzilla's grasshoppers isaiah 40 verse 21 have ye not known have ye not heard has it not been told you from the beginning have you not understand understood from the foundations of the earth it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretches out the heavens as a curtain and spread of them as a tent to dwell in and whatever those obstacles are it may be fear it may be sin [Music] and it seems like we see a giant [Music] and to them that have no might he increases strength we don't have to have strength in ourselves it's god's strength that will carry us through it at night i i've seen some of the some of the young people and i've been watching and i see some of the bugs flying around [Music] and maybe as our brother said it may be a boy or maybe a girl um may be it may be drinking it may be partying it may be it may be even spending too much time on social media he says [Music] god said that those giants are grasshoppers [Music] you're like a million times bigger than it is squash it a blaster and that's the same thing that you can do is joshua chapter [Music] the people again come to this jordan river to take the land that god had promised to them [Music] joshua sends two spies over josue they go over and they go to a place the greatest city of them all called jericho they get into the city and they see the giant walls [Music] a hard life into the worst life that she could have lived sinful life but she had heard she had hope that maybe my the professor was named dr kurt richter from harvard university a professor a professor record the harvard the harvard harbor and he did an experiment with rats and what he did is he took these rats and he put them in a bucket half full of water and he dropped them in and he saw how long that they would swim so then dr richter said i'll try something different and he takes a bunch of rats and uh previous time the rats have lasted about at the most 15 minutes before they drowned and he puts this new bunch of rats and they start swimming around after about 10 to 15 minutes they started to sink and then just before they drowned he picked them up and pulled them out [Music] before they had drowned in 15 minutes what do you think happened now how long do you think they swam 60 hours they had hoped that something was going to pluck them out of that situation even a rat has hope right now and here is rahab and she hears the drum beat but then friends what happens if you just don't have the faith brother daniel and i got to go hunting with brother caleb last year and brother sammy and we didn't find any deer and the pastor had to go back and prepare for service [Music] so brother sam and brother daniel and i we went out into the field early in the morning brother caleb had showed us there was a high mountain off in the distance i said let's go up there so we can glass and find the gear [Music] i said okay well brother daniel let's just go up to this place right here can we can we make it up to there what does he got he says yeah he says okay i'll go there so we go walking up to that place and brother daniel is huffing and puffing my brother had changed he was mean and we stopped and i said now remember talk to your friends this way sometimes your brother dana what's the matter go back to where you left your sense of humor and pick it up and that's friends sometimes we need a friend to take us through she lived a bad life and she had she had sinned too far she thought that maybe she had send away her day of grace and she said maybe i'll swim just a little bit longer and she she brought those in and she she said that she said everybody melts at the sound of your coming [Music] and you know the story that that the men that the spies they gave her the token and they went back with the report to joshua let me tell you our dear friend rahab the sinner she's not called that anymore by the way that is she she changed right there she had no more sin after that she served the lord and she married one of the finest men in the world [Music] she was in the lineage of the lord jesus christ i cannot wait to meet that sister and these two spies they come back to joshua these are the same anakin anakims that were on the mountains i'm not talking about anakin skywalker darth vader i'm talking about great warriors against god's what changed between those first 12 that went over and these two it was a different generation joshua i think it'd be good if we read a scripture i believe it's joshua chapter 1 verse 8. let me find it here joshua gives instructions to his people and he says this he says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe therein for for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have success good success be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whether so ever though us is and as the people were going over he instructed he said keep your eye on that arc you said because you have not gone this way before and the children of israel they came in and they ran through the land every amalekite every every anakin every giant that stood before him they came to this river called jordan vigneron ester rio llamas the river was swollen and they had to get over to jericho the river parted on both sides just like it did for for moses at the red sea joshua tells his people he said 12 of you pick up 12 stones and carry them and bring those stones to this city called and he said pile these stones here and bring your children back to this place and when they ask what are these stones said you tell [Music] caleb stands before joshua that's the scripture that we have read earlier and he said he said joshua he said the lord has kept me alive these 85 years he said i'm as good of a man now as i was dead i don't necessarily think that his body was as good as it was when he was 40 years old but it didn't matter and you know it must have bothered busted bothered caleb for this 45 years of what they did back there in cadiz barnea he said god gave it to us it's an inheritance of ours it may be the holy spirit it's mine i can have it he couldn't have friends he couldn't have one foot in the message he couldn't do that god required a 100 dedication and friends i i know in this building we've had we've we've had some people came to the altar we had a prayer line preparing for this battle reparando god doesn't want his people going into battle sick there's always something on their mind but friends have you made the commitment amigos have you made the decision to go over jordan evil this is the most important friends this isn't just a youth camp this isn't just listening to a minister up up on the pulpit preaching predicated the person wearing your shoes right now have you made this decision you made the decision all right as we want to go over jordan okay then we'll think about this next generation or are you one of the spies that went over so i can't do it and i will go over jordan i will take that mountain that you gave me no matter what giant lays in front of you as it as the as the bible says that that we thought we were grasshoppers in in our eyes so we became grasshoppers the chosen of god stands before these evil men and women not you no there is hope there friends if you don't have the faith yet it'll turn it the hope will turn take it seriously pablo he wrote in romans was in his letter to romans he he gave them an encouraging statement he said this he said nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us foreign for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come on nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which includes in christ jesus our lord [Music] think about the giant that stands before you that that keeps you that could keep you out of this kingdom will you serve him will you put your faith in jesus christ will you be the ones that cates barnea or will you be the spies that went into jericho oh dear jesus you've been so good to us and you've brought us this far we pray oh god that we would be in your will and lord jesus that you would give us the strength to take these mountains that lay before us and she would give us the revelation these are nothing but grasshoppers in front of us oh god we pray lord that we would have the strength and lord until you place that faith in our hearts we'll just [Music] that you would give us the strength to make this choice in jesus name amen and when you take that mountain that lays before you said there [Music] and i want you to take this seriously quiet if you will squash him then put one foot in front of the other and come to this altar you are going to make that stand if you're willing to make that stand friend jesus christ is here he will honor what you said do you believe it do you believe that you are that generation i believe that i am my generation amen amen stand strong friends squash that stupid little bug that stands in front of me stupid [Music]
