[0:00] let me before we go any further go back
[0:02] genesis 1 26 i'll pick it up wednesday
[0:06] when god made man before he made man he
[0:09] called himself
[0:11] l e l l e l h l r l o him
[0:17] the word means in the hebrew the
[0:19] self-existence
[0:23] all by himself
[0:26] nothing existed before him he was all
[0:28] the existence he ever was
[0:31] self existence one
[0:34] l
[0:35] elohim
[0:37] means
[0:38] all sufficient
[0:40] all powerful
[0:43] almighty
[0:45] self-existence
[0:48] one

[1:09] created something all for myself to be a
[1:13] son of mine are a temporary are an
[1:16] amateur little one of mine
[1:22] [Music]
[1:24] why he gave man
[1:27] jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[1:31] amateur god
[1:33] because he is father god
[1:36] and he made a man an amateur god so he
[1:39] isn't self existence anymore he exists

[1:54] jehovah meaning the one who exists with
[1:58] his family
[2:00] now god made man to be
[2:03] the predominant over all the earth he
[2:05] had dominion
[2:08] and the earth was man's dominion is that
[2:10] scripture
[2:12] then if that's his domain he was god
[2:15] over the earth

[4:20] hallelujah
[4:21] when was our names put in the lamb's
[4:23] book of life
[4:24] when the lamb was slain before the
[4:26] foundation of the world when god was
[4:29] jehovah l
[4:31] eli elohim
[4:33] the self-existence one
[4:35] just like one great big diamond
[4:38] and he could not be nothing else but
[4:40] inside of this diamond
[4:43] his attributes was a savior
[4:47] amen in this attributes on the inside of
[4:50] him was a healer
[4:54] well there was nothing to save and
[4:56] nothing to heal
[4:58] but his attributes produced it
[5:02] election looks back to foreknowledge
[5:05] and predestination looks the destiny
[5:09] don't forget that
[5:11] that election
[5:13] looks back here here it is but all of a
[5:16] sudden i become a wheat grain
[5:19] how did it happen uh that what is that
[5:22] election god before the foundation of
[5:25] the world
[5:27] elected that the conqueror was to become
[5:29] a grain of wheat now i know i'm a grain
[5:32] of wheat because i'm saved how do i do
[5:34] it now let's read just a little farther
[5:37] and then we'll have to close pretty
[5:39] sharply
[5:40] according as he chose us and him before
[5:43] the foundation of the world that we
[5:45] should be holy without blame before him
[5:48] in love
[5:49] having
[5:52] predestinated us
[5:55] unto the adoption
[5:58] predestinated unto the adoption of
[6:01] children by jesus christ to himself
[6:04] according to the good pleasure of his
[6:07] will
[6:09] what did he do
[6:10] he by ford knowledge
[6:13] foresaw us
[6:16] knowing that he was a
[6:18] savior
[6:20] self-existence
[6:22] but in him
[6:24] was
[6:26] a savior
[6:28] amen well what's he going to say there's
[6:30] nothing lost
[6:33] knowing that
[6:34] that he know that this great attribute
[6:37] in him would project something out on
[6:40] her
[6:40] that he could save
[6:42] then when it did that by four knowledge
[6:45] he looked down and he saw every everyone
[6:48] that would accept it
[6:51] and while he did that he did that that
[6:54] he
[6:55] might save you who wants to be saved
[7:02] do you see what i mean
[7:05] by for knowledge amen the infinite god
[7:09] who wrote all things
[7:11] saw the lamb
[7:13] and he slayed the lamb before the
[7:15] foundation of the world
[7:17] and he put your name on the lamb's book
[7:19] of life and he seen the deceitfulness of
[7:21] satan what he would do so he put your
[7:24] name on there by election he chose them
[7:28] and by predestination they know where
[7:30] they are going
[7:35] now who could doubt that that's what
[7:38] paul said
[7:39] that's paul's
[7:41] scripture
[7:43] that's paul's writing
[7:45] that's what he taught his church
[7:47] the church
[7:48] positioning
[7:50] before the foundation of the world
[7:52] when god and his labor pain
[7:55] was bringing forth bringing forth you
[7:59] knowing what you would do
[8:01] he positionally placed you into his own
[8:04] body
[8:05] amen
[8:07] to be a housewife
[8:09] to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a
[8:12] prophet to be this or to be that and
[8:15] then on next sunday morning we're going
[8:18] into the positionally placing the church
[8:23] positionally placing the church where
[8:27] they belong
[8:29] each one
[8:30] how we're called by the adoption

[8:37] sons by birth adopted and positionally
[8:41] placed by the holy spirit
