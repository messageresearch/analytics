keep y'all standing so long let us uh jump in right into the scriptures we're going to go to John chapter 11. chapter 11 we're going to jump around here a little bit okay uh we're going to start off with verse 17 talking about Lazarus is verse 17 then when Jesus came he found that he had laying in the grave four days already this is yeti Vino pues Jesus we're going to go down in verse 24 Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at that last day Resurrection Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live Jesus Take note here that when Jesus came to Lazarus Jesus Lazarus was dead for four days and he was in the grave for four days so the same day that he died was the same day that they buried him now we're going to jump over to verse 42. and I knew that thou hears me always but because the because of the people which I stand which I stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me when he thus has spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazareth come forth yeah and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound up about with a napkin Jesus say unto and I want to emphasize on the word them he saith unto them lose him and let him go vendas Jesus now let's just go to the book of Acts chapter 9. we're going to be reading verses 36 to 39. I'm just going to read it in English just to save a little bit of time there was a there was a japa a certain disciple named Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas this woman was full of good works and all sees which she did and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had walked whom they had washed and laid her in an upper room and for his for for as much as little was night to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that he would not delay to come to them amen let's bow our heads dear Lord at this time father we just asked her that you be with each and every one of us Lord we asked Lord that you would anoint these words father um the years of your people the hearts fathers your precious Most Holy names in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated amen now the title that I have up here might seem a little odd I when I was asked to preach I started to think of a title I said man it's got to be some kind of a deep crazy title you know uh began to meditate a little bit a shopping cart hit me and it took me back to a time with with our pastor pastor we had gone to the grocery store we must uh and uh and uh we had gone a few things and we came back outside and I remember that I was pushing the the shopping cart we got the stuff down and and it landed in uh in in a parking space one of those guys so that was the wrong thing to do yeah I get back in the car and I'm like there's somebody that gets paid to do that he said but but there's there's a place for it there's a place to put it I said yeah but I'm not getting paid to do that well that was that triggered him and he said yeah you would say something uh that's the way most people are nowadays they don't want to take any responses so our pasture went on for a little bit and you know I took it and I was like okay well let me get back out and go put the shopping cart where it goes okay okay and you know at the time I thought it was just the shopping cart that he was upset but it was the beginning stages of him trying to teach responsibility so that's how I got the title of this message to talk a little bit responsible foreign she was that kind of woman just a very giving person I knew how to use what the most simplest gift that she had yes and and this lady like Lazarus is she got a sickness and she ended up dying and I remember uh uh take me back to brother Rigo um at his funeral when everybody was talking so many good things about it they were crying about how good of a person he was reminding me a lot of brothers I remember that after the funeral I was talking to our Brother Carlos and I can't remember which one of us said it but we said wow did you see how they talked about it and he was like hey I wonder what they're going to say in our funeral brother he started saying all these good things about me and I was like okay so then he finished I was like hey it's my turn you know saying all this stuff right but we need to examine ourselves and see really really who who it is what kind of a person we really are real now dorkus she was not the only disciple there but the scriptures say that there was other disciples there with her and this this death of dorkus is death of Dorcas it wasn't too the time frame it wasn't too far off from the resurrection of Lazarus I don't know if when we already for the day of Pentecost it wasn't too far off and they must have heard because they weren't too far away either they must have heard and believed that the Holy Spirit was given to men because Lazarus when Lazarus was was when Lazarus died he died and they bury him the same day as we heard what they did with her must have heard what happened on the day of Pentecost because they didn't wash and bury her porqueers and these disciples believe so much that they said go call Peter and I like what Peter does because Peter does when they go and they call him he doesn't go and say hey well there's another disciple that was Jew with Jesus too you should go call on this brother he didn't do that Peter took responsibility he went and he said take me to her and I can see Peter yeah maybe this was one of the first times that they had her in an upper room maybe he's walking up the stairs remembering what happened I can believe that he is thinking that is thinking that what happens when you come up just a little bit higher they were we were crying that's how much of an impact and just like Jesus I just see Peter maybe as Jesus weak I can't see her that maybe she that maybe Peter started to get a little bit of his eyes just a little bit watery okay he tells all of them to leave the room because Peter had been in this same exact scenario Before Peter had experienced this scenario experience and why did Peter experience this scenario experience because Peter was part of the them when they were in the Tomb with Lazarus was a part of the them sales but now here's Peter Pedro and he witnessed all these things that Jesus did Jesus he witnessed the blind to see uh but the very thing that he witnessed the very experience that he witnessed that very experience was now inside and he did exactly what Jesus and he prayed and by name he calls her we remember the rich young woman when Jesus thought when Jesus would speak to him he would always refer to him as the rich young girl yet this man wanted eternal life but the Rich Young Ruler had no relationship with God typically there he is foreign what a plan get done what a plan amen get plan now I don't know how you feel you know I don't know sometimes this this woman she was dead and I don't know if you feel dead sometimes and if you don't God bless you I'm not trying to put anything in your head is if you feel dead in anxiety if you feel dead in these things I'm telling you how important you are to God how important that you are to God because when God started creating the world God said and God said God was speaking all these things the first time that God screamed church one of his own prophecy of Psalm 22 [Applause] what is he trying to the ultimate price has been paid now it's safe for you to come out [Applause] I bless you this beautiful evening but not before thanking you first for the opportunity I believe that when a pastor let someone borrow his puppet it is and if you ever hear me saying or calling him my body or my friend and I would like to turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 42. and I we would like to see locations during that time he is the same today foreign hand I will keep Thee I will give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles I like how the King James version says for light of the Gentile just keep that part is to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison to and damn that sit in the darkness out of the prison house reading of his word um we see the purpose first the prophet Isaiah is saying is the topic we would like to share in this evening is the same that the prophet of God would preach in January 25th turn on the light always respecting the truth foreign raise your hands a person foreign has given you a call with life why through which life comes foreign there's no future foreign it's not about words but it has a power and foreign so what limits this what's happening the word of God boys rituals that are kept from Generations you want to tell the person to do it this way and they say no no because my grandfather would do it like my dad used to do it like this and I do it like this and you say but realize that there's another way well wait a moment my son has to do it the same way and his son has to do it the same way that's what a tradition is a transmission of cultures and it comes and matches the way [Music] [Applause] and it happened foreign [Applause] doing the works that was the Gospel that's just presenting is God it is [Applause] and you hear his noise we hear the noise it hears its noise but you don't know where it's coming from that's how everyone is that is born of the spirit foreign they didn't watch them you know they didn't wash them yeah did you know that what did they do is that we're looking disciples are now washing their hands what did the Lord Jesus Christ do it right now I'm gonna teach them how to wash their hands they didn't entangle him he said that which comes in does not hurt you but that which goes out because it comes out from the heart where every heart is that is what truly hurts nothing happens to you but that's why they condemned them yes and it's to the bride yes because she is but the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ she knows that she's free she's not making this word because by his word it says why and if you say do this an inch of his Jesus Christ is so real foreign the delicacy Jesus Christ is opened [Music] Jesus Christ is here and he came to deliver you he came to heal you came to help you it's just it's just not another service the power of God wants to do something in your life and I'll finish with this you shall see me and the works that I do yeah you do also he is the same God he's waiting for his people and take him out of History we have we have tested by his word and we should do it until God is real in our lives let us prayer blessed Heavenly Father full of grace and kindness we thank you your word is the truth you stay in your word that the gospel did not only come in words Lord their hands and by Your Word Lord the authority of the Holy Spirit whatever it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and Lord Jesus let your word come know that Jesus Christ is present foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] controlling time foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] the soul
