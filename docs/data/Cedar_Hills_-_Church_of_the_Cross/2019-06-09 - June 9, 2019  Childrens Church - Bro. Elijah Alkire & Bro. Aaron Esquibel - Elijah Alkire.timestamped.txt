[11:45] the children can learn something yes is
[11:47] name of Jesus Christ amen
[11:49] you may be seated have you been nervous
[11:55] or really worried about something how
[11:59] many here know that brother Branham had
[12:01] a nerves problem many of the people he
[12:05] prayed for had nervousness this is my
[12:09] testimony of how the Lord healed me last
[12:12] year I started to become nervous and it
[12:14] started to affect my body I didn't want
[12:17] to eat and I started feeling sick and
[12:19] had nausea on and off so I got prayed
[12:22] for at the altar
[12:23] it went on for about a month until one
[12:26] Sunday morning I couldn't take it
[12:28] anymore
[12:29] so my mom took me to the hospital the
[12:31] first thing they did was a test and they
[12:33] came back man's nurse said I was
[12:35] dehydrated before the doctor even saw me
[12:40] by looking at my symptoms he said that I
[12:42] had diabetes so decided to keep me
[12:46] overnight the following day they took
[12:48] more tests because my blood sugar was
[12:50] off by the end of the day the doctors
[12:54] and the nurses were confused because
[12:55] they couldn't find anything wrong the
[12:58] Lord told brother Caleb that nothing was
[13:00] wrong with me and he turned against us
[13:03] your Bibles to Philippians 4:6
[13:20] be anxious for nothing but in everything
[13:23] by prayer and supplication with
[13:25] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[13:27] known to God I want to read a quote from
[13:31] brother Branham and it's from the
[13:32] message letting off the pressure
[13:34] it was preached on May 13th 1963 and
[13:37] then a nervous neurotic age that we're
[13:40] living in and you know and all this the
[13:42] doctors don't have the answers because
[13:44] they're plagued with it too they don't
[13:47] have the answer they don't know what to
[13:49] do you say Oh doctor I am just about to
[13:52] blow my head I don't know what to do I
[13:54] well he'd say I am too well there's
[13:57] nothing you can do he would give you a
[14:00] tranquilizer when that wears off you're
[14:01] more nervous than you was in the first
[14:03] place like a drunk man taking an extra
[14:05] drink to get over snugness you see so
[14:08] you you can't do it there's no answer
[14:10] they don't have it but God has the
[14:13] answer that's what we want to take talk
[14:15] about to have the answer God has got the
[14:19] answer he is the answer
[14:20] Christ is the answer to every problem we
[14:22] got any sickness in the world yes can
[14:26] heal if you're feeling sick kids
[14:28] he already healed us it's our job to
[14:30] believe him and believe his word I hope
[14:33] you received and learned something
[14:34] god bless you
[14:36] [Applause]
[15:04] well it was a drink uh thank you lord
[15:15] they were fishing for the lower well hey
[15:26] there hey y'all doing it was cramped in
[15:39] there
[15:48] Wow what a testimony a man well for
[15:54] those of you who don't know me my name
[15:57] is burger Evans hey there and I want to
[16:04] share with you a little testimony
[16:06] something that happened with me just
[16:08] earlier today how many of you know the
[16:10] Prophet brother branham a man while I
[16:15] was out fishing with him well let me
[16:16] tell you a little story first when I
[16:18] first met brother brenell he was down in
[16:22] a hotel lobby and he came up to me and
[16:26] we stalking and then he's just so kind
[16:29] and gentle and and he said brother Evans
[16:32] can I ask you something
[16:34] I said sure brother Brown he said you
[16:37] like to go fish and don't you I said yes
[16:39] sir
[16:40] he said you caught a lot of fish the
[16:42] other day didn't you
[16:43] I said yes I did he said why'd you throw
[16:46] him away when the game warden came by I
[16:49] said well I'm sorry for the brand name I
[16:51] should have done that he said well I
[16:53] have one request for you
[16:55] I said sure brother Brown said aren't
[16:58] you take more than fish rat so I said
[17:00] all right I don't take you so we went
[17:04] and well first me and my brother went
[17:06] out and I don't know if y'all have
[17:09] shakes out here but we have what's
[17:12] called a ground rattler and my brother's
[17:15] fishing and we've been fishing all our
[17:16] lives out there and you got to be
[17:19] careful with snakes especially this time
[17:21] of year and he went to steppin and a
[17:25] rattlesnake beat him right on the leg
[17:27] and he got out like a wounded puppy
[17:30] laughs and he was scared and before he
[17:35] knew what his leg was swelling up I
[17:36] didn't know what to do so we took him to
[17:40] the house and mama put him on some ice
[17:42] and and we got him all fixed up so few
[17:46] days after that I went out and me and
[17:52] brother branham went out and we was out
[17:56] fishing and man we were catching some
[17:59] big uns
[18:00] and I threw my line out and we started
[18:03] catching ten pounders seven pounders and
[18:05] we were having a good time and I was out
[18:09] there and had my boots on and I thought
[18:13] I'd sit down for a little while because
[18:14] out where we were at there was Gators
[18:17] everywhere water moccasins cottonmouth
[18:20] so I pulled out my gun I was keeping
[18:24] them all away you gotta make sure you're
[18:27] awake now so I was so happy to be out
[18:33] there at the profit and just to see him
[18:35] fishing and so I I was all soaking wet
[18:39] so I took my boots off for a little bit
[18:40] and I was sitting there and brother
[18:43] Brandon was fishing and I just seen his
[18:45] fishing pole bend down like that and
[18:47] he's pulling one in and right when he
[18:51] was about to pull him up that fish just
[18:52] broke the line got away so I said that
[18:58] was Big Jim there brother branham why
[19:00] don't you cast that in again and get him
[19:01] so Billy brown threw his cast out and
[19:04] got him again so I said I'll help you
[19:06] brother Brown so I jumped up off my seat
[19:08] and right when I stepped I just felt the
[19:11] most excruciating pain right in my leg a
[19:14] big old snake just bit me ground rattler
[19:17] and so as soon as it hit me I fell to
[19:20] the floor and I screamed like that it
[19:24] just hurt me so bad my leg fit pillows I
[19:26] couldn't even move and I was crying for
[19:30] Mama and brother branham came up to me
[19:34] and and boy I weigh about 200 pound
[19:37] brittle Brown ain't very big you know
[19:39] and I said well Billy Brown your ain't
[19:42] gonna be able to carry me out of here
[19:43] you know it's two miles back to the car
[19:45] and we was in trouble as our brother
[19:48] just said you know you got a colon Lord
[19:52] he's an ever-present help in a time of
[19:53] need a man and the Prophet very calmly
[19:56] just came to me and he said brother
[19:58] Evans you just sit still and he put his
[20:01] hand where the stake too bit me and he
[20:04] said Lord you gave them power you gave
[20:10] us power to tread over serpents and
[20:13] scorpions and it were not harmless and
[20:16] right when he did that I started
[20:18] laughing not that it was funny because
[20:21] the pain left me and I just felt so good
[20:24] I couldn't help but laugh and I said
[20:27] well brother Brown I guess we better
[20:29] continue fishing so we did and I threw
[20:32] my line out and we just kept catching we
[20:34] caught up to 11 12 inch fish bass and it
[20:41] was some goodie and so that night we got
[20:45] back to to the cabin
[20:48] we had our string fooled fish and and I
[20:52] showed them to my brother and the story
[20:53] got brought up about that old snake and
[20:56] he was sitting there stealing a cast
[20:57] from the last weekend and he said well
[21:01] it's okay to be religious but it's
[21:03] another thing to be dumb
[21:05] he's like you'd better get yourself up
[21:06] to that Hospital and I said well he said
[21:10] you need that anti-venom
[21:12] you know what anti-venom is so when you
[21:15] get bit by a snake you got to get an
[21:17] anti-venom Slade will kill the poison in
[21:20] your body and I said well Jesus already
[21:23] did that for me at 10 o'clock this
[21:24] morning and I'm still alive at 10
[21:27] o'clock at night so if I ain't going to
[21:28] make it from here on out then I'm not
[21:31] going to make it I believe the Lord just
[21:33] going to take control so that was my
[21:38] experience with the Lord and with the
[21:42] Prophet and like our brother was saying
[21:45] we go through many things in life
[21:47] sometimes we get sick sometimes we get
[21:49] anxiety whatever it may be but what you
[21:52] got to realize kids is those are just
[21:55] symptoms the devil can't do anything to
[21:58] you because Jesus already healed you
[22:00] it's already been paid for and sickness
[22:04] all Satan can do is give you what are
[22:06] called symptoms symptoms are only yours
[22:09] if you accept them and I want to show
[22:12] you all something hopefully it'll help
[22:13] you understand what I'm talking about
[22:17] symptoms brother Brown says or like a
[22:21] gift from Satan who wants a gift
[22:26] it's from Satan and it has your name on
[22:28] it - andreas from the big ugly you won't
[22:34] open it you don't want who wants to fit
[22:37] who's brave okay really why don't you
[22:43] open up this nice dandy gift see what
[22:45] Satan has for you huh you know he's
[22:50] afraid
[22:51] who's brave huh it's a doggy so a Satan
[22:58] has for you is a nice box of
[23:00] rattlesnakes that's the kind of gift
[23:04] Satan last to give you who want some
[23:06] nice box of rattlesnakes as a pet
[23:10] full of venom sharp teeth paralyze you I
[23:16] don't think so so in one sense brother
[23:20] Brown says these snakes are sent to you
[23:23] they have your name on them and they're
[23:27] for you if you accept them that's the
[23:32] key you don't have to accept anything
[23:34] that Satan wants to give you now if the
[23:38] postman were to bring these to you you'd
[23:39] say I don't want that junk you take it
[23:42] back where you got it from and by law
[23:44] you have to take it and send it back -
[23:46] who sent it to you in this case you deny
[23:49] what Satan's trying to give you you give
[23:52] it back to him and he'll take it back to
[23:54] Hell where it came from so whatever
[23:57] sickness you got or whatever you're
[23:58] dealing with all you got to say is
[24:00] singing I don't want that trash and you
[24:03] take it back to Hell where it came from
[24:04] I am not sick I don't have anything
[24:07] wrong with me and I'm healed by the
[24:10] precious blood of Jesus Christ and
[24:12] that's what I did that day when I was
[24:14] fishing with the Prophet I could have
[24:16] looked at the symptoms my brother was
[24:18] back at home with his legs swelling up
[24:19] like a balloon and we was two miles out
[24:22] I could have thought well there ain't no
[24:23] anti-venom
[24:24] we ain't got no ambulance brother
[24:26] branham won't carry me two miles he
[24:29] would have but it were taking him a
[24:31] while and we were in a state of
[24:33] emergency and all we could do was call
[24:35] on the Lord and that's why everything
[24:38] you do you got to make sure he's near
[24:39] because brother Brown said that day why
[24:41] the holy spirit was just standing off
[24:43] waiting for that word to be coated and
[24:45] as soon as he heard it he just came
[24:48] right by and did what he wanted to do
[24:50] because when he hears that word he just
[24:52] loves to heal his children and so that's
[24:55] the lesson for today don't accept what
[24:58] the devil's trying to put on him when he
[25:00] tries to bite you at that venom the
[25:02] anti-venom is the Word of God and you
[25:05] got to have it inside of you when that
[25:06] bike come so you're immune to it because
[25:08] it can't penetrate the Word of God when
[25:10] it's in your heart how many of you
[25:13] understand that today a man let's go
[25:17] ahead and stand I'm going to call the
[25:19] song leader up and I want you all to
[25:21] worship like you never had before
[25:23] amen stay awake now
