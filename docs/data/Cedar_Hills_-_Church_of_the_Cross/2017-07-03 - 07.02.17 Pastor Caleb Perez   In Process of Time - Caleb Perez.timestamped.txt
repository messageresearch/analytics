[39:41] something also so soon David you cannot
[39:43] have an event loop will attend an event
[39:45] unless there are actors or people that
[39:47] are that are part of this event can
[39:50] actually so hint because important
[39:51] element we must know where we are in the
[39:54] process of all this event estamos en el
[39:56] proceso days and just simply this
[39:58] implementing is that I I look at people
[40:01] today Mira la gente OE and I realize
[40:03] Melek wind I see how they process things
