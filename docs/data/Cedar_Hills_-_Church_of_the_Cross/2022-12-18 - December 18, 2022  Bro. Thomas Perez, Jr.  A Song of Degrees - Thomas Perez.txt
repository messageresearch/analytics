but let us read verse one blessed is everyone the feareth the Lord and walketh in his way and once again this is a song of degrees amen let's approach the author I said gracious and heavenly father

amen and thanks to see all of our cousins Primo God bless you amongst them is my my namesake my name is brother Thomas God bless you he is on his side there's four four tomases and on mice on our side there's four also I I got to meet his son and it's just one of those things when you say hello how are you is what's your name what's your name are you serious amen but we're very grateful to the Lord you have all of them here with us this morning and thankful to our pastor for the confidence this morning last weekend you that we're here on Sunday morning what a great time we had and so we're grateful that that what God has done for us is sometimes I I I've been a Bible student my whole life yesterday and you know there's there's people that don't know what to preach for us that that have been revealed to us the message of the hours there's not enough time in a day because everything is just new the Bible speaks to us about us to speak to us about new mercies and so every time I open the pages I don't know if this this happens to you but things just jump out at you I think that one day the the prophet of God must have been reading in the Book of Malachi and he came upon the scripture behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he said that's me and you know one day you hear you read in the pages of the scripture the bride has made herself ready and you say it that one's talking about me and you know so I I look and open the Bible and at the very beginning in a lot of these Psalms have a song of degrees but this this got my attention right away uh it's Psalm 128 um song of degrees and I was looking at at uh per se our life my life and how we we aren't what we we uh had set out to be you know you know we we every day we want to be better if we don't want to be better there's something wrong with us but I I I think that a person doesn't doesn't strive one day and say I wish I was poor today than yesterday I'm really poor today tomorrow I hope I'm double poor yeah neither does a Christian should ever come out and say I don't have the Holy Ghost today I'll make sure I don't have it tomorrow I believe within ourselves you to be able to to produce what its intended purpose was foreign for this comes from the Lord who is the spirit foreign than we were yesterday and our answer should be a resounding yes in understanding God himself by the prophet of the age he first tells us that he was hell and then Elohim it was all all going into degrees unto the point that he would even say that Jehovah of the Old Testament Jesus of the news I believe that even in the ministry of brother Branham he was not not comfortable just being what the Lord had just given him at that time he was always searching and God would say I'm going to change your ministry and the angel tell told him you're going to have three pools go you go it is also a song of I believe that when the word of God comes to us it should be changing us from one degree to another from one glory to another Gloria from one face to another from one pool to another from one person to another person feel all they see is Christ we ourselves understand the opening of the word when we try to get the word of God isolate a scripture is no longer the god of degrees when we try to isolate ourselves to refuse to go into the word of God it is no longer a song but when we hear the word of God the word of God is the lake that produces the river that produces a picture that produces a Dipper to be able to take away the Revelation the word of God from its Pages we ourselves Nosotros mismos have got to understand that God has this great Treasury did you ever have a Time afternoon we were in in a in Men's Warehouse one day with the with the young men one time they they said uh this jacket is very expensive and I said to whom I can it's only expensive if you have no money if you're a billionaire a million dollar house is nothing um if you got a hundred dollars a penny is not much but the word of God goes by degrees sometimes we only want to come to church to get a chill down our streets but if you wanna go online degrados but when I see people that claim the message to live the same life that they lived last year I was living in the degrees they're still trying to figure out if they believe we already believe some people gotta pray about what they believe Joel's already come to me angels already come to you and he has produced a song of degree should we be better than yesterday well brother I believe that brother what brother Branham says yes see I believe what brother Branham says I believe that the word of God is the word of God brother branham's talking to you about his degrees his song of degrees but what about those that have believed his word this is the turning point of the message of the hours people look for something to happen and they acknowledge of what happened in the paste the time present tense so God cannot deal with them so many people that claim Malachi are foreign they tell you 32 below zero is really cold and all of a sudden you go outside you find out it's 32 below risk is but you're always cold before you go out yeah it's gonna be cold it's gonna be really cold play a song of degrees but you gotta climatize yourself dude you gotta climatize yourself you have to you you have to climatize yourself when you come to the house of the Lord and you say well it's this Sunday morning you're already trying to tell us what your degree is yes I love people that come Sunday morning and are not dragging to church and you're and they're with the attitude of you're lucky that I'm here they don't want to go in a penny higher but let me tell you when Solomon when he became what captured the queen of sheba's attention was the happiness of his people why okay silver silver was like a common brick on the road when his Chariot tears would go down the valley they would dust their hair with gold when they would hear Solomon speak it was the wisdom of God is this where we're all at I heard your wisdom and it was all great I also saw your servants let us go into the house of the Lord so I raised up my hands they went from your smile I glorify him you know why so it is a song of degrees that's why I tell people I'm going to say this again you could tell where people are when they do this number is okay but when when you love God I'll stop my boys when you love the Lord raise up your hands you're gonna sing man say man be a man if you're happy to be in the house of the Lord be happy to be in the house he rescued me he loved me when nobody loves me but no one cared for me was the song of the Greek foreign God so loved the world this is the degree is he gave his only begotten I venture to say there are texts there in John 3 16. is a lake is a river a Rio a pitcher and the word world does not mean does the the world it separates itself from God but I want you to notice this one but the great and blessed truth part here is however I may drag myself away from God I cannot drive him away from me can I say that one more time the great and blessed truth part here is that however I may drag myself away from God I cannot drive him away from me you know why he always remains brother Jacob he always remains faithfulness and he is faithful to what it is faithful to his degree is God's word is who he is when he says I will have a bride that's me faithful to that you might drag yourself away from him you can never drive yourself away go away from him he cannot get away from you from Everlasting to Everest one degree to another yeah so I look and I say you're very illegal was it it was not Christ's death that turned God from hating and being angry in order but it was God's love that appointed Christ's death no longer foreign [Music] [Music] what does the lake do can I say and what does the river do if there's no picture take out the water but from the river we live in a Time passed by yes and when we live in that time we never let God live today when he comes to our life we come to the newness of life every day it's new mercies you find out in the scripture where the Bible speaks to us that God that a man prayed to God and all of a sudden repentance the sun was moved back 10 degrees in another occasion moved forward 10 degrees and so foreign now we've done everything that we're supposed to do just believe now and have faith the prophet of God amen amen and be reverent just have faith just believe sometimes your faith is unconscious you have it and don't know it is that little woman we understand where what we need to do and today must look at them you must guess then we come to the house of the Lord we already have it programmed in our minds if I do this I'm gonna get more of God in the first place there is more of God I must reduce than you even have a desire than to know what he is it's like saying this is I'm not going to drink this much water because there might not be enough like the little fish in the ocean if I drink too much water there won't be enough for everybody else but as he himself is I've been a Christian my whole life some people might say that I've been a good Christiano is that enough for me I've been a preacher since I was five years old I'm going on 53 years of being a preacher yeah is there anything else that I would like to do no no is this the greatest calling in the face of the world yeah be a minister of this end time God let us I would become the president of the United States would be a demotion because there is no no that has greater powers that have been redeemed already knows his degree [Applause] I don't have a DD degree you know I'm not a doctorate doctor of divinity but I am well it's called a person that has been washed in the blood and I am a person that have knows that what it is to be a Christian and whatnot you say okay this is what this is where I I want to tell you six years old I was watching my papa preach in the apostolic assembly Apostolic must have been a Wednesday night or a when or or a Sunday afternoon Sunday evening the doors open and a man that had been in a wheelchair for 18 years Wheels himself to the platform where my papa is preaching my father finished he he he stops preaching he goes down to the man but he prays for the man tell them and the man gets up and he pushes this wheelchair outside you know this is a song of degrees we find out what's happening in in Uganda the great Revival could it happen here yes yes gee there's a fire burning there's a fire burning we're now waiting for the fire to come back the only thing that we need to know is how hard is it is can I tell you that well maybe I can't can I well this is New Year's Eve 50 000 ugandans are waiting for us to to have a service with them yeah [Applause] [Applause] see you understand yeah you understand you understand this it's a stronger degrees have you ever seen 50 000 people personas no we come to church we see a couple two three hundred people yeah and that's good can you imagine fifty thousand brother Mike yeah but of every person in this world has got a right to hear it once can you imagine 50 000. ugandans Africans Africans hearing what we heard last Sunday they got degrees what did their degree do is what happened on the day of pentas one degree got together with another Bravo another degree got together with another degree rather it's that you just don't know my life you know what happens that's what I tell people all the time you want to be a drunkard hook up with drunkards if you want to be a womanizer be around people that are womanizers you want to be a drug addicted but if you want to be the workmate flash you gotta hang around with words you gotta hang around with people I don't have their degree to your degree is a song of degrees Glory but brother you know hermano I'm trying to testify to them and most of the time they testify to you and win you uh but however when you get a little orange tree you put a little seat in the ground it breaks forth into a little tree and you take that little tree at one inch tall and set it out do you know that every orange that you'll ever pick off of that tree is in it right then is man amen you know brother brother you know you say you don't understand there are things that you cannot do I say yeah I couldn't even save myself you know you know so we get past all that right you know but how many events you don't you can't do it no you know it's only in Christ but you know brother Mark if my hope according to the Apostle Paul me Esperance if my hope rests only in Christ in other words Christ came and he died for us but you don't accept it you said no acceptance a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received this is the ministry of brother Branham foreign did he come was his message to come to pick up a bride and I say yes sir who's the bride it's a song of degrees so when brother Branham comes he comes not to produce who he is he comes only he comes to produce the word of God that would bring children and Daughters of God bring them to manifestations Glory again the little the little orange tree is it doesn't matter how small he is every orange that it will produce is in that tree yeah you might say brother I just got saved today and I say no in the mind of God our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life we have only recognized it today everything is free every orange that we will ever produce it's right in us right now the resurrection is inside foreign I wake up in the morning and I sit down and as soon as I sit down brother Jacob again when I open my eyes when you open your eyes the devil trembles like nobody's business does not know what's inside of you but we like to help him oh I'm nobody of course we're nobody in the eyes of God we are the word of God made flesh can I tell you one thing in the degrees in Los grados sometimes can I tell you about a story of a three Hebrew children named Elijah Leos Noah Noah and Adonai Adam but for you that are stuck in history we'll call them um you know that story but did you ever know this other story of Elijah Noah and I don't know you know your story we read Lemos that story here we read what brother Branham did we read what he will do and all that is wonderful but in the middle of the pages he said in the ladder there was things written in between the lines there was uh Nebuchadnezzar made this image of gold and to cut it to Chase it was the image of Daniel they knew who Daniel was so the story continues that they said uh they accused the Jews and he said that will King has made a decree oh Grace that every man that hear the sound of the coordinate the flute the harp the plot and it keeps on going shall fall down and worship the golden image not down the grados many people don't want to go there because it's comfortable to come to the house of the Lord yes and do the same theatrics over and over tongue leader you know even if we sing uh a song called Hallelujah everybody knows nobody sings it because they don't know the word and that's the only word okay let's change it up we're gonna sing hey hey amen amen amen yeah that's the only word to the song I didn't sing because I don't know the words see you know even if I don't know the words to the song which is it's very difficult but because I I I I've tried to learn the words to the song you know there's a song that says he loves to hear the the winds and he loves to hear the birds singing But but his favorite song is above all is this is the song of the redeemedos that it doesn't matter how hot it gets Hallelujah I had a rough week I'm with us how to raise up your hand more Generations my car broke I burned the food oh [Applause] they fired me from the job oh that just means that I'm gonna get a better one anybody don't think like that is like that like that oh yeah are you are you that excited my boy got a better job he ain't that excited they had a job that paid him a little bit of money do you understand it's a song of degrees I understood what the pastor said Sunday how Glory oh Gloria there's a stimulation of Revelations they once I pull it out of them and then they're happy now and this is where where they they said this we're not going to kneel down to that image no no no because we know what our Revelation is because we know and Nebuchadnezzar says you know why the furnace isn't hot enough it's not hot enough we're gonna we're gonna heat it up seven times every age gets hotter because yeah in Ephesus they they it was hot in episode but all of a sudden it is the hottest of all is everybody's got a right you can't tell me what to do no more friend have a right little bitty people have arrived everybody's got a right Pastor Minister you can't tell me no more what you do you know right but then there are people of God surrendered the rights and understand the degree that God wants to use and they said we will not serve any Gods neither will we worship the image that you need something he says fire it up and every day you know life is so I think I'm gonna move over there yeah the grass is greener over there but that grass still needs to be mowed and since you don't live there it looks prettier until you get there and when you get there ah it's just like where I just left oh is you know why because the problems are in here they followed you from here to there yeah this is where it all comes out of yeah this is the Fountain of there there comes lying lust murders everything is when we go and listen to the degree your wife might say I love you but it doesn't sound as good as the other girl I raise up my hands in church but it's not as good as when almonds right it's Saturday night dancing to the cumbias get going that takes you to another degree and then you you sell out your love that you have for God to the things of the world because you know they're temporary and you give up the Eternal for right now and you say whereas my relationship with God it's a song of degrees wow all right Ted we're gonna cast you into the fire yeah into the furnace you know what the Hebrew children no one Adam I said you know what go ahead go ahead and cast this into that fire there ain't nothing like the fire that I have inside of me what did this fire tell the other fire what did this thing agree tell the other degree we will not bend down we will not worship that image is able to free us from the fire yes oh somebody got a shout now and even if he doesn't okay [Applause] foreign No One Ever Loved Me Like Jesus Jesus I fall in love with him every day when they say there's 50 000 ugandans waiting for us you know why because two thousand years ago the only big Garden Of The Sun send me Lord because you're gonna have to go die yes you're gonna have to go die a man could do for another man the picture the lake illegal the river the real the picture came out of a man and he said he that drinketh from me shall never foreign with all of my heart I do it all over again and I say this to almighty God we are here hell or high water yeah we will never surrender God is given to us given to us in degrees this is the song of the Greece This is Our Song of degrees and our song has something to say when peace like a river It Is Well with My Soul you know how that song was written it was written by a man that lost everything he was on his way to to England his family was on his way to England in the middle of the uh of the ocean and every single one of his six children died and his wife on the other side I alone have survived and as he passed by on his way to England the captain says this is where that ship went down the inspiration of God hit him when peace like a river attendeth my way when Sorrows like cheese pillows roles it is that the angel s know that song brother brothers it's a song of degrees and for 20 almost 23 years followed this man to a land that he was not native to it has become his song has become his Revelation there are people here come from different countries they don't know about the United States this has become their songs this song is a song that we sing every Sunday we put our suit on and the song says this I once was lost in sin hey but Jesus took me in Jesus I don't know if you know this song but I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me here and then a little from Heaven my Souls this is my song we look upon biramos story La historia and when Nebuchadnezzar came near the mouth of the burning fiery furnace he was astani the Bible says rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors come on you don't know who's with you right resurrections inside of you restoration is inside you everything that you have need of Isis this is what they'll say did we not cast three men into the fire they do not we cast three bound men into the midst of the fires true okay over the already he answered and said [Applause] the fire that dwells in you is hotter than what you've been fought this is a song of degrees how is it I see four men loose Orlando gossiping cheese meando complaining feeling sorry for themselves not being able to raise up our hands and we not cast three men into the fire did we not cast three men into the fire how do I see four men Rocking Around free free leave their hands waving your degree looked at him and one and and they have no hurt you know brother Glenn in Ronald Glenn the devil El Diablo he said I'm gonna get him and Jesus said Over My Dead Body because he knew that that body was going to resurrect okay brother Glenn Glenn I thought that I had you you've been together and the form of one of them is the form of the son not matter your condition does not matter where where you are put into then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the Bernice and he spake and said Elijah Noah Elijah Noah Adonai Adonai ye Servants of the most highest come forth Southwest and come hither then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth to the midst of the fire and the princes the governors the captains the king's counselors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power Corpus nor was neither were their coats changed neither did they have the smell of fire on them [Applause] I love the word of God the word of God is our strength Fortress the very help in the time of church this is the song of degree is not even the smell of fire de Fuego why okay that was the fourth one in the fire well when we
