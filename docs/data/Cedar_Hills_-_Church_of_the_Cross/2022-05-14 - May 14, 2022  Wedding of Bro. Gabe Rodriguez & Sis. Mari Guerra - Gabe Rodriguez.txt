TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] in the bonds let us borrow heads in prayer our gracious heavenly father we are happy to be called your children this afternoon lord and as your children have come lord i pray that you have a special anointing upon them upon the congregation on those that have will be seen this ceremony today may your hand of grace and mercy apply abide upon them and upon this congregation in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated for the next few moments we we're going to take a portion of scripture it might be to the average person that as we go to many weddings might be out of character the scripture tells us in ephesians the second chapter and the verse eight it says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god the book of proverbs tells us who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies and in the book of saint john the fourth chapter and the tenth verse it says jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee living water i come to the marriage as we will celebrate here in a in a few minutes the oath the the bonds of what will unite these two together understanding that that it is their vow to each other that already has tied them to each other when he when gabriel asked mari and she said yes they were as good as married in the eyes of the lord you look awfully handsome today dress up real well very beautiful today known these young people for quite a while this is what we do as a body of believers we we don't believe in dating we court we don't do it according to the world we do it according to the commandments of almighty god or this that we will enter into in a few minute minutes is sacred it is something not to be entered in haphazardly but it's something that we do believe that it is until death do we part it is something that god has ordained since the garden of eden the bible says that from the beginning of the creation of god god made them male and female in today's society that is frowned upon we don't care what happens and what society has to tell we have entered into another kingdom and in that kingdom its male and female created he them the scripture tells us for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder god's motive then for marriage is for the two to become one flesh because two is better than one deuteronomy the 32nd chapter tells us says that one can chase a thousand but two can put 10 000 to flight this is what god has instituted in his word says if two of you shall agree on any on earth as touching anything that they ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven the only way that these two can become one if this god is in the middle of that relationship that's why he says he he tells us where there are two or three congregated in my name there i am in the midst of them says if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken the beginning of the creation of god how god has instituted since the garden of eden i look at our in our situation and around the world of what things that are transpiring in the political realm in the religious realm in the secular realm and to many people this is an odd occurrence today but in the eyes of god this is the way that it is supposed to happen the bible speaks to us about different things of what we are supposed to be doing today but i want to to to let everyone know this afternoon that we believe that god sent a mighty prophet i'm going to say this again we're going to we believe that god sent a mighty prophet in this 20th century and it was to take us back to eden it was to take us back to understand that from the beginning even though what might happen today but from the beginning it was not so in understanding all of these these these things then in a few minutes there's going to be an oath taken this is not until i find another one this is not until something else feels better this is until death part that's an oath there cannot be no covenant unless there is a no me and my wife by god's amazing grace have this year will celebrate 38 years together i remember a great man of god that always told us to make sure that she stayed my girlfriend as a wife you kind of things start going and see how beautiful she is today you see how handsome he is today it won't always be this way she's going to disappoint you you're going to disappoint him but in all of that the bible says that love covers a multitude of sins i remember when my papa looked down in time and he says there is a girl for you and she's from albuquerque i said dada you know i i you know you have your excuses of why he said pay attention there are things that have to happen in life for people to pay attention when you look upon the time and this is not just the time that we're gonna have a wedding and have a have a a a dinner and then all of a sudden there's a honeymoon and everything goes out the window this is a great event outside of your salvation gabe this is the greatest day of your whole life outside of your salvation this is the greatest day of your whole life this is the great decision of what god is doing and what he's doing today this afternoon this is what he's trying to do with his people amen when all of this that we're looking in for a few more minutes i made that decision when i made that decision outside of my salvation become the greatest decision that i've ever made but you're going to have to find her gift if there's any scripture that identifies the prophet of the age was jesus and the woman at the well yes and when jesus meets the woman at the well he tells her this if thou knewest the gift and who it is that speaks to you you would ask of him living waters now you're gonna have to find the gift here you're gonna have to find the gift there because by grace are we saved and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god but under the gift there are gifts and this is a gift so you're going to have to find you might not find it today might be 38 years when you find that virtuous woman her price is far above that than rupees yes the hebrew word for for oath is shiva meaning to seven one cell abraham makes the treaty with abimelech using seven you lambs and they call the place beersheba which means the place of the oath or the well of the sevens if you don't have an oath you have no covenant another word for oath is you raise your hand and how many in church do we when we're worshiping the lord and the minister or someone tells you raise up your hand what you are actually signifying is that i make an oath to almighty god we raise our hands in worship we are swearing an oath to him there ain't no god like our god there's no one that can bring two people from two separate mind thing thinkings two different concepts two different ideas and bring them together and the twain become one like god can a religion can give you a creed or a dogma but he gives you a relationship making it in all oath then is to call upon the power of god to bind satan and evil it is a mystery of drawing down the presence of god of engaging god for help in power to do whatever we're about to do so okay i was young one got gray hair now i was where you were at one time but in the name of the lord jesus christ find her price find the gift find him his gift for by grace we are saved and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god god bless you [Applause] amen god bless you god bless each one of you that have come to be here as witnesses of this great event you ready are you ready all righty let's get into the vows i'm gonna ask you both you would stand i did it both you look lovely ready dearly beloved we are gathered here together in the sight of god and in the face of this company to join together this man and woman in holy matrimony which is commanded by saint paul to be honorable among all men it is therefore not by any to be entered into unadvisably or lightly irreverently discreetly soberly and in the fear of god into this holy state these two persons present come to be joined if there's anyone here that can show a just cause why they should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony do you now speak or from hereafter forever hold your peace making sure i see everybody if not then you must hold your peace i will require and charge you both as you'll surely answer at the day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed if there's either of you that know any impediment why you should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony do you now confess it or be it assured unto you that any couples that are joined otherwise then god's word does allow their marriage is not lawful but duly believing you have considered this solemn obligation you're about to assume and that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently disgracefully soberly in the fear of god i shall propose to you the marriage covenant you will witness the same as you join your right hands gabriel rodriguez will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to love and honor and cherish and support in sickness or health riches or poverty and will forsake all others as long as you both shall live yes

long as you both shall live i do all right he said it's harder when you go first wow we're to have to have some conversations amen i will require a token up amen let us bow our heads our heavenly father as we are conscious of this act that we are performing and realize that you married the first couple that was married on the earth when you married our father and mother adam and eve and commanded them to go forth into the world and to be fruitful and multiply and down to this day lord this young man and young woman comes now to be united by the virtues of thy word and i promise as in
