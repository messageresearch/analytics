Ramos on DVD pastor funded or omalo prison arrow Paolo Paolo prisoner Paolo please your narrow enjoy company freedom Europe in the it is 40 minutes long Tamar cuarenta cinco minutos so we want open our Bibles and I hope I pronounce this book right does I have a hard time pronouncing some of these words children children and even if anymore except to the book of Titus and simply going to read the first verse how many I'd like to touch a little bit tonight on the fall a prisoner of Christ and a rigid way exactly what I said Paul a prisoner Jesus Christ would you all read it with me for a prisoner Jesus Christ what what a thing to be a prisoner is easy he is not prisoner of just anybody but he's a prisoner of jesus christ let us pray Heavenly Father we are did thankful this evening Lord the opportunity wants more to be able to be assembled together we call it a privilege we know the times will come when this privilege will be taken away from us but as long as we have this privilege it is an honor to come together and worship you together may this be a revelation to your people that someday they'll look for fellowship and they will be able to find it they'll look for somebody that just believes the word they they won't be able to find it all you can hear is somebody is stepping by your side and shaking their feet stop interfering know that there delivers hold it on the belt is getting harder every day it's waxing hot hotter it seems like it's getting two degrees up when those people children were in the fiery furnace it just keeps getting hotter and hotter the Lord in spite of all this we hang on because we have a promise and it's really not us holding on more but it's you hold it on to us we pray Heavenly Father this evening that you will be with us and just let your spirit for each one of us more and make me understand that we're not here in church just to test a few hours that we're here because we're concerned we've been convinced now we're concerned about our welfare on the welfare of the people no we're here trying Lord with everything we have in our power mode to make it takes you lord we understand that man can't do it alone then is not able to do it takes the Holy Spirit and I prayed your father that you will quicken this to us be with us lord help us father along the way heal the sick the afflicted in Jesus name you conceded as you're said to turn your Bibles over to the third chapter of the efficient and it also speaks about Paul being a prisoner and he said there in verse 1 for this cost I fall the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles now and i have therefore been have enough to finish make sure that everybody gets weak but you know it's it's quite a word of print imprisonment of christ now in some of the manners of wall it says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ in other letters it says Paul a servant of Jesus Christ and but he writes is better to Killman he impresses it as Paul a prisoner of Christ and when he wrote his letter Paul was in jail he was in jail and and he could well understand by his position what a word man that when he was surrounded by margin about how jail looks but he could only be free if someone made him free or let him freak we have incidents in the Bible world may have God in most men of God have either served in jail at one time or the other John the Baptist all silent listen Peter and what have you and John taking to thee I have a pectus and they were all there under what we would call today federal prisons but here is a man put in jail because of what he believed didn't go very well with a regular trend on what he did is the regular trend there was the Orthodox religion and it was the turning of the corner of a dispensation but it was very hard for them to see it and now the high priests day they thought that this group of people called Christians were a cult so Paul being one of them was very a very persecuted man very persecuted by religion and federal government under Roman rule we understand them but here we find Paul in such a such a predicament in a man in a prison and he saying a prisoner of Christ now I don't believe and you know you know why I say that that I don't believe that Paul was addressing this letter to Philemon about his present condition his present condition was that he was in jail he wasn't referring to that but I believe he was referring to his deal his spirit his will being a prisoner to the Lord Jesus Christ and let me just before I get started a man who would not like to be a prisoner Jesus Christ don't be so hasty in raising your hands it's not easy to be a prisoner to be behind bars but like I said I do not believe that here what you say a prisoner of Jesus Christ he's referring to his physical being but he's referring to his will first of all to get started we understand that as men and women we are under free moral agency and it has to be that way for you to choose whether you want to serve or you don't want to serve whether you want to follow that you want for life and it has to be upon the same basis that he placed underneath and if it isn't on those basis well then God isn't just but God being just he pleases you and I under a free free fall agency and I wonder all that work because later this passage of Scripture my confuse you a little bit it confuses in Damphousse theologians such as such as to prepare agency well in primo veggie you have a choice but we'll find out later what choice Paul had when he became a prison a man it gets quite tremendous that when you when you read this now right and wrong is set before us just like I said Eponine and the whole human race was under what we call the penalty of death we we were we were condemned to die no way out but God came down in the form of a man to take away that sting of death and place under free moral agency he placed on a promoted agency for you and I to make a decision now decision is decisions are hard to make we we we stand like in the valley of decisions and man we get up in the morning we have to decide whether we're gonna put on our side so or not that's why you see a lot of people with don't wear socks then what blue one hey you gotta decide whether you're gonna wash your face and comb your hair while you're find out people never comb their hair they decided to color here then you're going to side whether you believe breakfast or you're not they every minute that passes by there are decision to be made it's time to church we have to decide whether we want to go to church or we don't want to go to church right you have you have a right to choose yes you don't have to come to church people say to the church you don't have to go to church your femoral agent you can stay home and watch I Love Lucy but we choose to be here we we are I believe we're all here because we want it to be here let's have it retrieve all agency and you choose to serve God you choose to survive you know the church promos no matter what church they will do that anyone that is called Christian knows that Jesus Christ died on the cross that rider is that moment anyone that is called a Christian or the Jesus Christ died on the cross now they have to decide if they're going to follow him they have to decide what church they're gonna go to they have to make a decision but they're going to believe a man and have to decide it's a decision and nobody could make for you you gotta make it by yourself you can bring your children to church but when they grow old or get over the way they want to and usually they are depending on your church they're going to go out in the world no matter how much you bring in the church you gotta get that new birth man but we find out that each one of us must choose we must choose death or life do that life or death in our lives our lives are just a shadow and you know what brings a shadow is a certain degree of darkness and a certain degree of life man ever creates a shell so we walk in the valley of the shadow of death but the real life we see which is called plasma life this discuss per week we we have access to the Cosmo life but but then there's another life which is godlike that is not that's not possible that slowly and we've heard that over and over now when they light is present darkness flees that there's no there's no darkness they can stand there there's no darkness to stand there with it in Cosmo you can bring a shadow they create the shell two different things and a certain degree of darkness with light create the shell but you can be sound asleep and you can wake up in the middle of the night and if you happen to see the light got to see Zoe it it has no boundaries as far as darkness it makes darkness go away and that's something great have you ever seen a light I have many people have some never seen like but I think I've seen a light and the greatest I've seen is a violinist struck my heart now your life my life your life will prove what side you're on the side now listen I I make this statement is to maybe improve a little bit of the condition of the Apostle Paul now Paul as far as being a Christian he was not Christian Paul was a Jew but had come into Christianity he had seen this thing about Christianity yet Paul believed there was a god he he he serve God in way understand catch all this he served God his way he was a very trained man he was a scholar but the life that he had prove what side he was on Paul had never come in contact with light Paul had gone to to school from the age of eight years old to the age of 35 he had studied under great man like Dominion to the great man he was a god-fearing man but he had sees the light he didn't know anything about Jesus or he knew there was a sec called Christians that follow a man that was here on earth called Jesus that's all he knew so right that is that he had showed what side he was on he was on the side the way the same acronym that was Paul on the boat most of the New Testament the letters but in in seeing this you think I'm staring up there's a reason for it we certainly a little bit here but in studying this life of Paul and how he was a prisoner is something to behold as Christians we we sometimes judge our lives by how much power we seem to possess or but how many miracles can be dire ministry or by how much knowledge we have the world so if you find you you find he moved you throughout the country the vital bookstores are full books on commentaries by different men in the new boy of how they think things should be run they have their school they have her thought Heather idea they have their theology on how things should be run everybody gives you their opinion on how things should be learned what was straight under that on how things should be Ron Paul was a very ambitious man aside from being very smart and intelligent person trained under Gamaliel Paul was Amanda had a vision and one of the ambitions that he was to suddenly be a priest and someday maybe be the high priest that was his ambition so forehead paper with the Sanhedrin he found favor with the clergy of his day but his wife proved what side he was on and at that age when he had Saladin he was under this clergy he was a very old trusted man that's the reason that they gave Paul the power and documents to go to Damascus and originally the Bible how he went to the bestest any went to Damascus he went because he was given authority to bind to bring back to Jerusalem these new groups called Christians bring back so Paul went to Damascus and he was also given the authority to kill anyone that resisted him here for a deal so Paul he thought he was doing God a service he was trained he believed in God he chose to follow God but there's one thing the Pope had never encountered he had never encountered that Hellfire he knew nothing about Christianity he regards as far as the Hebrew long time as far as the Hebrew he said I am a Hebrew of Hebron and for a tribe of Benjamin circumcised the eighth day he you is a serviceman but the time came when Paul going and thinking he was doing a service he takes get on it on his horse and he goes with his man and he goes toward a master's but he took to his surprise sounds fun why persecutest thou me and he said Lord for thou is Ryan Jesus ah but na persecute you know what Jesus did you wanna be freezing children it what Jesus did to him it was needed yes it was Ida Jesus with her colleagues Isaac and that Paul or so he said you are to go to a street called straight I have a stranger than you've got proper comment of Dragon Ball but he was there how the Holy Spirit came upon him and I had the Prophet he came and anointed him and we find it as he had anointed Paul that polls are polls eyes were open to something that he had never seen before he to a degree to a certain degree you could touch him concerning the mall you you look at it once it reaches possible to the roman the corinthians thessalonians april and i said he because there's some tailors and don't think that you're on the book of peoples but I believe he will consider evil and so he wrote letters most of them dictated by man well he would dictate it they would write for him but he would write these letters and for how he expounded the that Hebrew Lord he he said zealous concerning the law he said no one was more sellers than I was support a tremendous tremendous man and I find an interesting thing here it there are and I could have tribute to my right as far as religion with we're all born with religion one form or the other we all come from different backgrounds whether Catholic Presbyterian braxton whatever and we come in we know what father's taught us we we we love God because we we with running the reason God and we learn to love him to a certain degree but as far as really being every a lot of people haven't been apprehended by this thing so they remain religious the ball was every handed and when he if I were open I believe it that Paul attended a lot of the services of man called Peter and he would sit there and hear him and he said this is tremendous the way he places this what you may never place them like this the middle of this because this was the start of Christianity yes and the Oh Lord are the thoughts and ways the religion the shortest if it pointed is a time to a deliverer from the deliverer came he knew him in with never safety just a handful Bible save about a honey but they began to grow they began to grow up that word frightened the Jewish people the same Helena the priests and everything that they had to put a stop to all this but here we find Paul he said this is tremendous the one important take in the morning this is me I got fired from myself all these things why why he intercepted why God did not permit me to fulfill my ambition you know why initiatives it makes a designer to have an owner or power or such as any career it's a life as from Webster's and in there he went to the desert with Libby went to the desert of Iranian and he studied for three and a half years and one day he said I counted to the patience and the revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ and how the Lord comes to him in such a way that the ambition that was in here and let's face it we all have a mission to do things vision something given I wonder why we're here I'm Cristiano I'm supposed to go to church and water bench for adventures a man can say man the truth no ambition but this man had wishes that's why he went to Damascus but each change fall or south which is name was given them from Saul the Lord says I'll show you how much you have to suffer you will suffer for my name's see I tell people it's easy go to church it's easy to pick x TZ here often it's hard when you come across this line and something more is demanded of you have you here young people especially especially well I'm gonna go to school I'm gonna be a teacher Ammar being a musician be a great salesman I'm gonna leave this or that well that their ambition that water of Nations try to do in our ambitions my my other ambitions that was things I wanted to do you know there are many many times to be a pastor is not easy there was many many times you you feel like going away from it you feel you feel like getting away from it all because it's hard very hard to minister and not just minister but mainly to be a pasture and their pasture almost 27 years and in ain't getting no easier but there's one thing experience and with Lord it helps us along the way to be able to cope with the situation so it's not easy so then would it be easy for a man like me just to forget about it and go get my partner doomed working hours like you know and go home and take it easy it would be easy 30 people work eight hours and they go oh I'm so tired trying to hit it it for 24 - I'm tired of the law where you can sleep from the whole burden of the church and people is upon it it gets hard but how can a man do that it is the question how can a man do that except he be a prisoner and here is for everything to see this portion of Scripture but then I look at it and I see Paul being a prisoner he's not talking about me enough in a little jail which he was but he is not speaking about that he was a prisoner to his will he had read oh he had a mission he had in him something that he wanted to excel he wanted to be a priest and maybe a high priest when Jesus comes across you understand me Jesus comes and the mind comes if your question was here triple agent when Jesus called take apart before you answer was here meanwhile agent could he choose no God that he had chosen to serve God and point number one and number two is Paul even though he was he doesn't know how to turn him over Philippians 4 which I have been apprehended or arrested it wasn't free moral agency no more he was God showing mercy to America Paul his mercy he places a yoke on him and fires and he was chained were ball could not order to his will but he was God let fall he let him with a harness and pulled him so that he could go to the Gentiles do you think the Jews or Gentiles he should have never even think that that's that's a filthy common nothing of this I'm never in these things the $1 jelly but guys Cleveland when country and Jude Jude tips of the a Gentile they're called dogs here Peter had to be given a vision and never say vision was given give it to the Tanner it was the same thing that Peter understood that God had open the way for the Gentile but the jet dog still was back without knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ so God had to arrest every but you know how deserving people annotator one thing you need men seeking for God never does the men seek for God he's got seeking men as far as to lead to our church and serving God Sherman under that free moral agency does that but when you're apprehended by the Lord Jesus Christ where you're digging from your comfort zone you have a comfort zone from this comfort zone because it's easy to go in the trend and made a comfort zone but when God ruffles those feathers of a nest makes you move and why do you do it because he's got chains on you chains of love you so much but things get hard church but please get out bearable in the church when you see man and woman pretend to be Christians and the light they leave him whatever and he gets so hot sure you feel like running away but a true Shepherd won't run behind will run but what makes you spend because it has so much knowledge no sir because you are upon you and he said my yoke is easy and my burden is light sometimes I wonder sometimes in a light side all the word is right so I have to go back and put this carnal man to the side and say it's not your son it's Jesus notice another point there was Paul persecuting Jesus [Music] I say literally a minute was Jesus Christ in corporate form then who was Oprah City they was persecuted in church the volunteers in Jesus said that's enough don't you touch em that's enough you're not supposed to persecute these my name is English you're persecuting me Paul when you touch these people it is I it is I nobody else and when we see see that and we see the road and the troubles that we have on the road and everything else with always come to thee Jesus and how many of you would love to just have those chains and love place the point but here's what's going to happen it was what I happen you got a call for in one go dear me you've gotta go or you don't want to go ha you've gotta do something but you don't want you gotta say things sometimes that you don't wanna say hey when the people throw at you it's not you today it's Jesus it hasn't changed centralism he hates the same man a man what what a tremendous thing that that he just addresses the earth for a prison price I am an prisoner a prisoner that is bound in chains of love he loved Jesus so much when he got a revelation of what it was that his chains did me why did God change what if God took his chains away from you do you think that you would go back to your evolution for the elevation so it becomes madam or the decisions comment message just a little boy what would it be tremendous to know that he loves us how do how do you find against me would you send your feet did we find how much do we do go to a certain place for I have a word for you to do would you buy a new one go he just showed that you want [Music] people as be at times but he goes to different places why do you do you have to do No I used to be [Music] whatever he says they're nothing less wet and until we get to that place yeah we deserve [Music] our knowledge oh Jesus we know we have to reach out or no he said no way [Music] he could do anything else sell the goods give it to the poor they got across follow me he was ready in his possession let us not fall into them better people give God what is God and deserve choose to up [Music] anything [Music] I want you to serve beans you don't have those chains up [Music] because our ambition is 12 we have you say [Music] Wow [Music] amen let's all stand to our feet a man what a beautiful message a man
