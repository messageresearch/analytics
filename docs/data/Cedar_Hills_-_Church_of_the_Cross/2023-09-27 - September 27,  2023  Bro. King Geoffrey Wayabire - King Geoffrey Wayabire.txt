are glad to be part of the vision summer estamos content of the said part of de la Vision I know it's going to produce something great in the continent of Africa grandios I'm so glad to be part of it you also personal your friend that let King to A Amigo left the work in Uganda and it is still going on by the grace of God we are still standing and we are grateful for your prayers in all the corners of Africa amen amen thank you for having me gracias thank you for taking care of me graciasm have been eating food male after male uh and I was telling brother Thomas that I may choose not to go back home but it's going to be therefore he said because I'm enjoying everything that I'm going through here amen amen quickly I'm going to share a word of God I just wanted to see to come and see my brothers so when you took me out after picking me from and he took me out to a Whataburger a Whataburger then he asks me do you think you came here for a holiday and I realized I'm supposed to share something okay it is sad to share one to the brothers that know the world it's difficult also the comparative that is why I'm so nervous but I pray God will help you first John 5 verses 19. Cinco versus ask you to stand up enough the Bible says and we know is that we are of God and we know that we are of God somos de dios and the world the whole world life in wickedness quickly we also go to John 8. then sparked Jesus again unto themes Jesus I'm the light of the world your soy la Luz del mundo he that followeth shall not work in that Darkness but shall of the light of Life de la Vida father we want to thank you once again we pray that you speak to us through your anointed words this evening I want to speak to us a subject I know who I am soy I know who I am soy I don't know about you but I know who I am you know I know who I am your second soy a bride of Jesus Christ when read the scripture because we belong to him his love is always winning so when John says we know cuando Juan entonces that we are of God at this time is not predicting at this time is not assuming this time he's not thinking about it at this time is not trying to understand at times I don't want to assume things when I go through challenges because you know you're of God you know you of God you are appointed at such a time like this if we must ask about you yours yesterday we are studying the Bible study with Pastor column studio is in Ephesians where it says according as he has chosen Us in him foreign is going to raise upon your way no matter what the world is going to learn do it just end generation is circumstances your face if you allow your circumstances to Define you you steady circumstance yes you need to miss out on a few things [Applause] to miss about many things if you allow challenges to Define you you study you're going to miss out on a lot of things but if you reminded yourself the light of the world I know I am of God you saw it and yours God chose me even before nothing is going to intimidate you never never intimidate nothing is going to scare you never never mind the Church of God today instead [Applause] yeah it doesn't matter how long it's going to take no important we had the Bible study for about three hours a studio biblical certain scriptures I asked you a question and I got a thousand answers the Bible says let us make like people that is I was reminded except speaking through you and me you go to Poland to go to Uganda to go on all the corners of the world man in God's image I have an assignment here today I don't want to be intimidated yours whether I am the child or not I am of God I am not for hell you're not sorry a witchcraft [Applause] I am for God yes where are you at this stage because God send us a prophet to bring the word so if you don't want to jump into what the prophet says then something is going to be missing what are you doing in such a season whose child are you when they ask you who are you [Music] when they ask you who are you you don't need to take 10 minutes to explain who you who you are nothing yes foreign Christo yesterday some of us forget who we are investors [Applause] all right who are you son who are you generous I know who I am you're saying soy it is quite unfortunate is it will be terrible for a terrible if you're getting married and then someone comes and asks you who are you getting married to is to ask your bridesmaids who am I getting married too who am I getting married it would be such unfortunate okay if you're getting married to someone you don't know you would rather leave it You Should Know Who You Are it doesn't take me time to explain who I am soy it doesn't take me time to explain who my father was it doesn't take me time no necessito Tiempo because I know who it was DNA runs in me and so is DNA runs in me so are there any Quran me whose child are you they can't son is [Applause] if Pastor Caleb didn't love my father I wouldn't be here if this church didn't love my father I wouldn't be here see yes but because someone built a foundation with this church God shows you even before the foundations [Applause] it comes to attack you it touches his heart and it says who is affecting my child okay do you remember that you're a child of God and God loves you if you want to have fear in your life remember the prophet says circumstances shouldn't Define you circumstances you go through Define it remind them that you're a child of God we shouldn't be at the place where you're just trying to assume am I am I part of the the bride nothing is just assuming if you're part of the vision the vision Sawyer and it's going to run after you elevation the Bible says and mercy shall follow me all the days Christo [Applause] foreign the Bible says said in John a now then Jesus then sparked Jesus again unto them Jesus saying I'm the light of the world he that follow with me shall not walk in that no underwriting but shall have the light of Life yesterday when we were speaking about the light I don't want I don't want to take you through my Bible study Studio biblical it is but God loved you so very much that he took this part of the light and gave it to you every place you go to school the light overshadows you lose Sombra and that light speaks for you yes because it's in you you shouldn't be scared of any Darkness you shouldn't be tired or stressed about the darkness the light lives in you llama you shouldn't be intimidated not the video necessarily who always intimidated I remind you of how good you're not for your records the enemy always remind you of your past the assets the enemy will always remind you foreign [Music] I know who I am you're second sorry I know who I am your second skin soy I know who I am your second sorry Adams we forget and we have to remind you today that you should know who you are struggle will come but he loves you so very much you shouldn't be intimidated you shouldn't be for second she shouldn't be checked away the problem we go through was a church today when God speaks you start asking yourself questions you start saying I'm not good enough who said they say was no valgo no no no tengo Valor no soy sufficiently Bueno I'm not good enough I can't do it was asking questions from all of you here to come to Uganda muchas he says 60 would be like you shouldn't go well the Ugandan food is going to make you sick you shouldn't go but because he knows who he is it takes the risk of coming guess what foreign some of you I'll go know they will say that some of us are not where we are supposed to be no estamos because all the time you want to be reminded we want to ask for people's opinions before we do what God has called us mandado if you would only change your mind and don't your eyes and you don't focus on the people around you see usted no can be as soon and focus them to the right Persona correct you're so much in trouble because you don't you won't be able to notice who you are okay because the world knows how to define us the world will tell you how bad you are the wild Warriors tell you how evil you are the world will always tell you of our poor of a family you come from don't put your eyes on people focus them to God and focus and see him do what no man can do if they can help the Bible says with men Los Hombres with menombres nothing is possible nothing is possible but with God pero con dios everything is possible foreign [Music] let us stop predicting of who we are the key and somos and know that we are for God economics we are a church it's almost like Iglesia of God that yours just the challenges will come your way lorettos but remember that we are for God we are foreign amen we are the sort of the world we are the light of the world and we are favored and we are blessed that that that part of the LIE De la Luz lives with them within us don't allow people Define don't allow challenges defined yes people will come and abuse you you're preaching the wrong
