[46:31] God you cannot know him outside of his
[46:35] word so he had a triple purpose of to he
[46:40] wanted the people to know who he
[46:45] was it's a triple purpose of him
[46:48] revealing
[46:51] himself so somebody help me real quick
[46:53] what was the number one
[46:59] was to reveal himself in Christ right
[47:03] remember what we said God that all
[47:06] powerful all omniscient this great being
[47:09] called
[47:12] Elohim he he was too mysterious for for
[47:15] us to even fathom in our in our finite
[47:22] Minds so the first thing was he was
[47:24] going to reveal himself in
[47:28] Christ number two
[47:31] is to have preeminence in his
[47:37] bride and number
[47:39] three to restore the kingdom
[47:42] am so as I reflect on on this year and
[47:46] I'm sure each one of you in one form or
[47:49] another have reflected on
[47:52] it I can say wow what a year
[47:57] all the battles as I said all the ups
[48:00] and the
[48:02] Downs all the discouraging events that
[48:08] happened all our
[48:11] failures we can focus on all those
[48:15] things or we can just focus on one
[48:18] thing we are here and we have the
[48:23] victory yes or yes
[48:27] this it's been a a a a hard
[48:30] year but a Victorious
[48:33] year because you cannot have a victory L
[48:36] you have been in a
[48:38] battle believe that each one of us in
[48:41] one way or another we have been in a
[48:43] great
[48:46] battle and I choose to look at it as a
[48:49] Victorious
[48:52] year we can look at it as a year that we
[48:55] lost lost our founding
[48:58] pastor but I don't choose to look at it
[49:01] like
[49:03] that I choose to see it as that we were
[49:09] Witnesses of everything our founding
[49:12] pastor preached and lived
[49:16] for we were Witnesses of him leaving one
[49:22] Tabernacle and going into an eternal
[49:27] Tabernacle now now we have to choose the
[49:29] way we're going to see this
[49:32] year saw my wife's father go on to be
[49:36] with the Lord as
[49:38] well that was two fathers in one
[49:42] year and we say blessed be the name of
[49:45] the
[49:47] Lord we saw babies born here in the
[49:51] church tabernacled here in
[49:54] Earth
[49:56] God being faithful to his
[49:59] word god fulfilling promises that he
[50:04] gave we saw the Lord gather 1200 Pastors
[50:09] in
[50:12] Uganda we saw the light of the Gospel
[50:14] spread around the
[50:18] world we saw things that we had never
[50:21] seen
[50:23] before we saw this blessed
[50:26] message reach places that maybe it would
[50:29] not have
[50:33] reached we were Witnesses of revivals
[50:36] breaking
[50:39] out in different countries from Norway
[50:41] to Poland as the Norway of Poland we
[50:44] were Witnesses of God's Mighty
[50:48] works we saw many Souls come to the
[50:53] Lord both here and
[50:57] abroad we saw the healing saving grace
[51:00] of God in our
[51:04] midst and as great as this year has
[51:08] been I am looking forward to this new
[51:13] year because I believe there are greater
[51:16] victories that are that lay
[51:20] ahead let this year die with our
[51:24] failures
[51:26] with our
[51:27] indifferences with our
[51:30] mentality and may a new year be
[51:34] born I'm grateful to God for
[51:36] that let us do as Paul says in the book
[51:39] of Philippians the third
[51:43] chapter Brethren I count not myself to
[51:46] have
[51:51] apprehended but this one thing I
[51:54] do forgetting those things which are
[51:58] behind and reaching forth unto those
[52:01] things which are
[52:03] before I press toward the mark for the
[52:06] prize of the High Calling of God in
[52:10] Christ
[52:13] Jesus and then I like what he said
[52:16] Here let us
[52:19] therefore as many as be
[52:23] perfect be thus
[52:27] minded and this is where we want to
[52:29] start our message
[52:31] today once again let us
[52:35] therefore as many as be
[52:39] perfect be thus
[52:42] minded and if in anything ye otherwise
[52:48] minded God shall reveal even this unto
[52:52] you he's telling the Philippians here
[52:56] as many as be
[52:58] perfect now I want to know how many is
[53:01] he talking to
[53:02] today he's saying as many as be
[53:08] perfect well we got maybe half the
[53:11] church or three qus of the
[53:14] church and then somebody can look and
[53:16] say ha I know things about each one of
[53:21] you they're not perfect they make a lot
[53:24] of
[53:26] mistakes Paul here is saying as many as
[53:30] be
[53:31] perfect when people say no one's
[53:36] perfect how many have ever said
[53:42] that let me make sure we we hit home
[53:45] with this
[53:46] today how many have ever said oh
[53:48] nobody's
[53:52] perfect yeah I think we all are guilt
[53:55] guilty of
[53:56] that no one's perfect then this
[53:59] scripture is not for
[54:06] you oh I I don't think you got
[54:09] that Paul said let therefore as many as
[54:13] be
[54:15] perfect so if well nobody's
[54:19] perfect then this scripture is not for
[54:22] anyone it's just a scripture that we
[54:26] read and we say oh it sounds good no
[54:29] one's perfect
[54:31] anyways but then if that scripture is
[54:34] not for
[54:35] us then neither is this
[54:38] scripture Matthew
[54:41] 548 where Jesus said be ye therefore
[54:47] perfect even as your father which is in
[54:50] heaven is
[54:53] perfect so why then do we use the phrase
[54:56] no one's
[55:02] perfect because of our
[55:07] insufficiencies notice this now this the
[55:10] phrase no one is
[55:14] perfect is an
[55:16] antichrist
[55:21] statement because we just read the Bible
[55:25] the Bible says Be
[55:28] Perfect the Bible says but as many as
[55:30] are
[55:31] perfect then if Christ is the
[55:35] word and we don't believe the
[55:38] word the only thing against Christ is
[55:41] the
[55:44] Antichrist Antichrist is a
[55:47] spirit and that Antichrist is against
[55:50] the
[55:54] word it's an antichrist it's anti-
[55:57] word once again listen
[56:00] closely that statement is an antichrist
[56:05] spirit that anoints people to say no one
[56:08] is
[56:10] perfect if you say no one is
[56:14] perfect you have never answered the
[56:16] question what think ye of
[56:21] Christ I abhor that statement
[56:26] I'm here to say it right to in the gates
[56:29] of
[56:31] hell I upore the statement no one's
[56:37] perfect I don't believe that
[56:41] statement why do I say
[56:43] this because that
[56:46] statement it's simply a feel sorry for
[56:49] yourself
[56:52] statement that's why people say nobody's
[56:55] perfect you're feeling sorry for
[56:57] yourself it is a self justification
[57:03] statement nobody's
[57:06] perfect that's how people justify their
[57:11] errors that's how they justify their sin
[57:14] their
[57:16] mistake nobody's
[57:18] perfect like if that gives us a reason
[57:22] to do what we
[57:23] do
[57:26] once again I abhor that
[57:30] statement and it's time this new year to
[57:33] get rid of that kind of
[57:37] mentality how many are are in this with
[57:40] me it's time to get rid of that
[57:44] mentality it's time to be
[57:47] perfect now now now let me stop for a
[57:50] moment because when we think of
[57:52] perfection we think of oh never make a
[57:54] mistake
[57:57] but the problem is is that we're always
[57:59] trying to perfect this guy out
[58:04] here that's why we don't see
[58:07] Perfection he he made a mistake oh she
[58:11] made a mistake you're looking at the
[58:13] carnal
[58:15] person but let's stop for a moment and
[58:18] see how this
[58:21] unfolds what think ye of Christ
[58:26] if I were to answer there's many answers
[58:28] we can
[58:30] give I want to clarify and I want to say
[58:34] this this
[58:36] morning he is the perfect
[58:41] one now listen closely here what do you
[58:44] think of
[58:46] Christ he is the perfect
[58:49] one and he is the Holy
[58:51] One
[58:53] period you believe that oh now we're
[58:56] getting something and if the perfect
[58:59] Holy
[59:01] One is dwelling in
[59:04] us then that makes us perfect and
[59:09] holy because the perfect and Holy One
[59:12] will not go come into a filthy
[59:17] vessel notice this as this
[59:19] unfolds don't tell me that you can have
[59:22] the Holy
[59:23] Ghost
[59:25] and not be perfect and
[59:30] holy hello
[59:33] everyone you're living in the glare of
[59:36] another
[59:38] age oh it's not us that's perfect by
[59:46] ourselves this is where we
[59:49] fail Lord how can I be
[59:52] perfect you can't without the holy
[59:56] ones you can't without answering the
[1:00:00] question what think you of Christ you
[1:00:04] can't answer those questions and
[1:00:06] therefore you cannot be perfect and holy
[1:00:08] without
[1:00:10] him it wasn't the Holy
[1:00:14] Mountain even though Peter says when I
[1:00:16] was on the Holy
[1:00:19] Mountain but it wasn't the Holy
[1:00:22] Mountain it was the Holy
[1:00:25] God that had descended onto the
[1:00:30] mountain that made it
[1:00:32] holy it's not the holy
[1:00:35] man but it's the holy God that lives in
[1:00:39] that
[1:00:41] man that makes him holy all right come
[1:00:44] on church now he's trying to change our
[1:00:49] mentality that no one's
[1:00:53] perfect amen and that's what Satan uses
[1:00:57] on the people every
[1:01:00] day you're not perfect you can't be
[1:01:04] perfect anybody deal with
[1:01:07] that let me see your
[1:01:10] hands we we all should raise our hands
[1:01:13] right because we feel that way I slipped
[1:01:17] up I'm not perfect I'm not worthy what
[1:01:21] makes us Worthy is not our own
[1:01:23] righteousness
[1:01:26] what makes us perfect what makes us
[1:01:29] Worthy is that we have a perfect
[1:01:34] sacrifice that gave his life for
[1:01:37] us and through the breaking of that
[1:01:40] blood
[1:01:42] cell bring on us another Another
[1:01:47] Life Life Is The Life of Christ in
[1:01:51] us that comes and makes us holy
[1:01:56] people it's not the outer man that we're
[1:01:58] trying to
[1:02:01] perfect the inner man that we're trying
[1:02:03] to
[1:02:05] prect if we try to clean up this
[1:02:08] person
[1:02:10] Reformation well this year I'm going to
[1:02:13] stop
[1:02:16] drinking I'm gonna stop
[1:02:19] smoking I'm going to stop looking at
[1:02:21] other women I'm going to stop looking at
[1:02:25] men I'm going to stop all the things
[1:02:27] that I
[1:02:30] do and it don't last very
[1:02:33] long New Year's
[1:02:36] resolutions a dime a
[1:02:40] dozen humans we want something
[1:02:44] better we want to start a new a new year
[1:02:49] right but it's not just about turning
[1:02:52] the page and trying to do something
[1:02:53] better
[1:02:56] it's about receiving the
[1:02:59] life that was let loose on
[1:03:03] Calvary that life has got to return upon
[1:03:06] the
[1:03:08] worshiper for the worshiper once
[1:03:13] Purge would have no more conscience or
[1:03:16] desire to sin
[1:03:19] in now now now now watch as we as this
[1:03:23] unfolds with me we're going somewhere
[1:03:28] today notice Matthew
[1:03:30] 21 and verse
[1:03:33] 10 and I pray as the Holy Spirit brings
[1:03:36] this out that he wraps it all
[1:03:40] together and it helps us this
[1:03:42] morning our last day of
[1:03:47] 2023 and when he was come into
[1:03:50] Jerusalem all the city was moved saying
[1:03:55] who is
[1:04:01] this this is the question of the
[1:04:05] day who is
[1:04:07] this ask your neighbor the
[1:04:10] question who is
[1:04:12] this if you read the story you know
[1:04:15] what's going on
[1:04:17] here Jesus is coming into
[1:04:20] Jerusalem and there's a crowd of people
[1:04:23] around
[1:04:26] and they're cheering
[1:04:27] hosana in the
[1:04:30] highest they're they're laying
[1:04:32] Palms At His
[1:04:34] Feet and the majority of the
[1:04:38] people brother Bram says didn't even
[1:04:40] know who didn't even know who Jesus
[1:04:45] was only maybe 1% of the known world
[1:04:49] even knew or even had heard of
[1:04:53] Jesus and they asked the question who is
[1:04:57] this what's all this Ruckus going
[1:05:00] on this is a real
[1:05:03] question we have said time and time
[1:05:05] again listen
[1:05:07] closely nothing can happen to
[1:05:11] us unless God permits
[1:05:15] it how many believe
[1:05:17] that and if God permits
[1:05:20] it there's a reason for that happening
[1:05:26] are you with me how many really believe
[1:05:29] that notice this now W watch this
[1:05:33] there's a reason for
[1:05:34] it then why are we always as
[1:05:39] humans crying and complaining about
[1:05:42] everything we go
[1:05:45] through that doesn't show somebody that
[1:05:48] believes
[1:05:50] him that doesn't show somebody that
[1:05:52] trusts him completely
[1:05:56] we haven't answered the question who is
[1:05:59] this things happen in life why don't we
[1:06:03] answer the question who is
[1:06:06] this all we know is all the devil is
[1:06:09] after
[1:06:10] me is that all you see is the devil
[1:06:13] after
[1:06:14] you you don't see the one that permitted
[1:06:16] him to come after
[1:06:20] you oh come on now come on now th this
[1:06:23] is where we
[1:06:25] fail we're always looking up for me look
[1:06:28] at what I'm going
[1:06:31] through
[1:06:33] allows he he allows the enemy to attack
[1:06:36] us he allows the enemy to come after
[1:06:40] us because he's trying to form his
[1:06:43] character inside of
[1:06:46] us now now now watch this now we have to
[1:06:50] answer the
[1:06:51] question no matter what we're going
[1:06:54] going through in
[1:06:55] life who is this who is this that's in
[1:07:00] control the carnal mind cannot
[1:07:02] comprehend the things that God do God
[1:07:06] does the learned and educated mind can't
[1:07:10] figure God
[1:07:13] out in the Third Exodus he says oh the
[1:07:16] loving hand of
[1:07:20] God how sometimes it looks
[1:07:26] of the way that people
[1:07:29] suffer but
[1:07:31] still it's the tender hand of
[1:07:35] God leading his little
[1:07:39] children it's only the tender hand of
[1:07:44] Jehovah that is leading us to the tree
[1:07:47] of
[1:07:51] life that that's that's where we're de
[1:07:54] defeated go through rough stretches in
[1:07:57] life and we all
[1:07:59] do we're not always on the
[1:08:02] mountain we have our
[1:08:04] struggles we have our
[1:08:07] hardships but we cannot lose
[1:08:10] sight that
[1:08:12] Perfection should be part of our
[1:08:17] makeup I don't know if you I don't know
[1:08:19] if you believe me or
[1:08:22] not we have been deceived to
[1:08:26] think that everything we consider
[1:08:32] negative it's the devil's
[1:08:36] doing once again he can't do
[1:08:40] nothing unless God
[1:08:44] permits is it the devil that has brought
[1:08:46] you this
[1:08:49] far brother you don't know what I've
[1:08:51] been through this year
[1:08:55] you're here and it has it been the devil
[1:08:58] that has brought you safe thus
[1:09:01] far who is
[1:09:03] this that's the question we should be
[1:09:05] asking this morning who is
[1:09:09] this
[1:09:11] Hallelujah brother brandham says
[1:09:13] this if you don't see
[1:09:17] Christ in every verse in every
[1:09:21] scripture what do you have to do
[1:09:26] go back and read it
[1:09:30] again I'm I'm going somewhere this
[1:09:33] morning if I lose you now I'm GNA lose
[1:09:36] you for the rest of
[1:09:39] it you've got to see Christ in every
[1:09:44] scripture amen tell your neighbor
[1:09:47] neighbor we've got to see Christ in
[1:09:50] every
[1:09:52] scripture okay
[1:09:54] if
[1:09:55] not do
[1:09:58] what go back and read it
[1:10:01] again and if we can't see
[1:10:05] Christ in every part or aspect of our
[1:10:12] lives uhoh uh it it was okay huh as long
[1:10:16] as we were using this
[1:10:18] scripture you don't see Christ go back
[1:10:20] and read it
[1:10:22] again what about this fourth
[1:10:25] Bible what about this book If You Don't
[1:10:28] See
[1:10:30] Christ in every part of your
[1:10:33] life go back to the
[1:10:36] foundation go back to your
[1:10:38] heart find out who is in the control
[1:10:44] room uh oh come on now we got to se
[1:10:47] Christ in every aspect of our
[1:10:51] life the world is falling apart
[1:10:55] we've we've hit on that the homes are
[1:10:57] falling
[1:10:58] apart churches are falling
[1:11:01] apart people are falling
[1:11:05] apart they need and want someone to save
[1:11:12] them yes or yes come on now every one of
[1:11:17] us needs a
[1:11:20] savior we are all looking for a
[1:11:29] messiah we're all looking for
[1:11:34] help they were looking for messiah to
[1:11:38] come to rescue them from the
[1:11:43] Romans and while the world is crying for
[1:11:45] a
[1:11:48] messiah the
[1:11:50] answer is here
[1:12:01] the reason they don't recognize
[1:12:05] it they don't want
[1:12:09] him why it's not according to their
[1:12:18] taste I'm okay with brother amilio but
[1:12:20] not brother
[1:12:22] Caleb
[1:12:25] he's just not according to maybe I'm not
[1:12:27] according to their
[1:12:29] taste
[1:12:32] right notice what what what's going on
[1:12:35] here The Same Spirit in the time of
[1:12:39] Jesus the Same Spirit
[1:12:42] today it's not according to their
[1:12:46] taste the the world has had
[1:12:51] Solomons wise men the world has had
[1:12:54] their David's Mighty
[1:12:57] Warriors they've been under
[1:13:00] governments
[1:13:02] kingships priests judges God sent his
[1:13:07] laws gave them a
[1:13:09] covenant they knew they needed help from
[1:13:13] heaven and they got the Messiah that
[1:13:16] they were looking
[1:13:19] for and they still rejected him
[1:13:25] so it is today we pray for
[1:13:28] help we pray for divine
[1:13:32] intervention and when God sends it we
[1:13:35] reject it why because we don't answer
[1:13:38] the
[1:13:40] question who is
[1:13:44] this how many visitations do we need to
[1:13:47] find out who who is
[1:13:50] this that was brother emo that visited
[1:13:53] visited
[1:13:54] me who is it brother
[1:13:57] emo who is it look a little
[1:14:03] deeper we're stuck
[1:14:06] here stuck in what we can
[1:14:08] see but we don't realize that in here
[1:14:11] there's someone
[1:14:14] else it's him that's
[1:14:17] coming he's here for your for your
[1:14:21] benefit but we're blinded to it
[1:14:24] because it's not according to our
[1:14:28] taste listen to
[1:14:30] this here's Jesus entering into
[1:14:34] Jerusalem who's this F who's all this
[1:14:36] what's all this racket
[1:14:38] up all these crazy
[1:14:41] people actually believe that Jesus the
[1:14:44] is the
[1:14:46] Messiah it's those crazy people that
[1:14:49] believe that God sent a
[1:14:52] prophet
[1:14:55] it's those crazy
[1:14:57] people that really believe in a
[1:14:59] five-fold
[1:15:01] Ministry those of that's making a bunch
[1:15:03] of
[1:15:03] Racket they're going here and there and
[1:15:06] and they're making racket everywhere
[1:15:07] they
[1:15:09] go but they ask the
[1:15:12] question who is
[1:15:15] this and the crowd answer that's Jesus a
[1:15:21] prophet but yet though that he was sent
[1:15:25] to are the ones that
[1:15:28] understood and Could See Beyond the Veil
[1:15:31] that was that that that was covering
[1:15:35] it once again what does Satan fear the
[1:15:40] most he said this so many times somebody
[1:15:42] help me
[1:15:43] out what does Satan fear the most that
[1:15:46] that you're
[1:15:49] religious does he fear you coming to
[1:15:52] church he's the first one in
[1:15:56] church oh we we we we go to church we
[1:15:58] sooth our conscience we feel
[1:16:01] better we go home and we live the same
[1:16:04] way man don't fear that he's got
[1:16:07] you he got a wicked
[1:16:11] cycle go to church Soo your conscience
[1:16:13] go home the same
[1:16:17] way Satan just keeps you on that
[1:16:21] Loop kind of like a record player you
[1:16:23] remember those
[1:16:25] record maybe some of you young ones
[1:16:27] don't remember
[1:16:28] whatever records now don't they yeah but
[1:16:32] it would get stuck every now and
[1:16:35] then and it wouldn't stop and you're
[1:16:39] like and
[1:16:41] then again it's the way it is in our
[1:16:45] lives so many
[1:16:46] times get stuck into the same
[1:16:50] routine what does Satan fear the most
[1:16:52] then
[1:16:54] that's an easy
[1:16:58] answer he fears that the most the
[1:17:03] revelation of who you are in Christ not
[1:17:08] outside of Christ because outside of
[1:17:11] Christ we don't have a
[1:17:12] chance he fears once again he fears the
[1:17:17] revelation of who you are in
[1:17:22] Christ oh my what was God's original
[1:17:26] purpose to reveal himself in
[1:17:29] Christ and if we are in
[1:17:32] Christ we are the ones he's revealing
[1:17:34] himself
[1:17:36] to we hear this all the
[1:17:38] time oh this one left the
[1:17:42] messagebody you hear
[1:17:45] that oh this one left the message they
[1:17:48] don't the message they never found their
[1:17:50] position in
[1:17:52] Christ
[1:17:54] oh this one left the
[1:17:56] message church we can't leave the
[1:18:00] message you know why because we are the
[1:18:04] message how do you leave
[1:18:07] yourself it's impossible to leave the
[1:18:10] message when you are the
[1:18:14] message I said help us
[1:18:16] Lord notice this now and I and I hope
[1:18:19] this this helps you
[1:18:21] today because God is much wiser and so
[1:18:25] far ahead of
[1:18:29] Satan he does things that even leave
[1:18:32] Satan scratching his
[1:18:36] head how many of you know that go that
[1:18:38] Satan is God's
[1:18:42] servant couple of
[1:18:45] you now we're getting into some good
[1:18:48] stuff write this down he is God's
[1:18:52] servant
[1:18:55] and that includes all his Devils
[1:18:59] too how is it
[1:19:02] possible that the Book of
[1:19:06] Joel
[1:19:08] 2:25 that God would call those insects
[1:19:12] that ate his brid
[1:19:17] tree he called them my great
[1:19:21] Army which I sent amongst
[1:19:26] you wait a minute wait a minute let's
[1:19:28] stop for a moment right
[1:19:30] here this is where it starts getting
[1:19:33] good once again God calls these bugs
[1:19:38] these
[1:19:39] insects there was four but there is
[1:19:41] actually one in in four stages we know
[1:19:44] that but he he he he says and he calls
[1:19:47] them he he's he knows the beginning from
[1:19:50] the
[1:19:51] end and he he sees down to time how
[1:19:55] those insects those Roman bugs how they
[1:19:57] would eat the tree of the Bride tree
[1:20:00] down to a
[1:20:05] stomach yet he calls them my great
[1:20:10] Army not his great
[1:20:14] Army not that great
[1:20:16] Army he calls it my great
[1:20:20] Army which I sent
[1:20:23] among
[1:20:24] you it was all for a
[1:20:27] purpose that's why we have to understand
[1:20:30] the the purpose of
[1:20:32] God we've got to understand his
[1:20:35] plan everything we go through is for a
[1:20:39] reason there's a purpose behind
[1:20:42] it notice can you fathom
[1:20:46] that they are
[1:20:48] eating they're
[1:20:50] eating destroying
[1:20:53] his brid
[1:20:56] Tre and he still calls them my great
[1:21:02] Army this this blows our
[1:21:06] minds you would think you would think
[1:21:08] that in our
[1:21:10] minds oh God protecting us don't touch
[1:21:14] her that's
[1:21:16] mine yet he sends the Army and go
[1:21:20] ahead down to a stump
[1:21:24] I don't know if that gets you or
[1:21:27] not I'm having a hard time getting over
[1:21:29] this
[1:21:33] scripture but he
[1:21:35] knew that if him being the groom
[1:21:39] tree would be cut
[1:21:42] down hung on a
[1:21:45] cross yet from the
[1:21:47] roots the life that had been down in the
[1:21:51] ground
[1:21:53] was going to resurrect
[1:21:55] again that the only way to show that he
[1:22:00] was the resurrection and the
[1:22:03] life he had to send his great
[1:22:07] Army down to a
[1:22:10] stump so that life could resurrect in
[1:22:17] her notice this now and there's so much
[1:22:20] that there's so much entailed there but
[1:22:21] I want to get to this
[1:22:24] point here's those
[1:22:26] bugs now if we were to go back to to
[1:22:30] Genesis here's
[1:22:33] Adam and and and we we know what happens
[1:22:35] in the
[1:22:36] fall he was not
[1:22:38] deceived he knew what he was doing but
[1:22:42] he did it because the the spirit of
[1:22:45] Christ was in
[1:22:47] him save his
[1:22:49] wife when he fell that title
[1:22:54] deed that seed left him the
[1:22:59] seed where the life was it left him and
[1:23:04] as it leaves him saan trying to grab a
[1:23:07] hold of
[1:23:10] it but the reason he can't hold
[1:23:14] it says because his filthy dirty
[1:23:18] hands cannot handle
[1:23:21] life
[1:23:23] only God is the author of
[1:23:25] life he is the author of
[1:23:28] death his Filthy Hands could not hold on
[1:23:31] to
[1:23:32] it and it went back to the original
[1:23:36] owner waiting for man to come and claim
[1:23:40] what's his one more
[1:23:44] time now I'm going a little further
[1:23:47] now here's those here's those
[1:23:50] bugs here they are they began to eat the
[1:23:54] fruit the leaves the bark and now the
[1:23:58] last one is the
[1:24:01] caterpillar and now this tree is
[1:24:04] stripped to looks like
[1:24:08] nothing down to
[1:24:10] nothing and the caterpillar comes in for
[1:24:13] the
[1:24:15] Finish soon as it puts its filthy dirty
[1:24:18] mouth on that
[1:24:20] tree Bo the life he starts to try to
[1:24:24] suck the
[1:24:27] life but he could not handle the
[1:24:31] life so the life stayed in The
[1:24:35] Roots until the
[1:24:37] season God would call for
[1:24:40] it it would start to push up through the
[1:24:44] roots and he would restor that bride
[1:24:48] tree
[1:24:50] again the same way he he was restored at
[1:24:55] C how many love him is this now now
[1:24:59] watch now we say all this for because
[1:25:01] we're we're we're getting to something
[1:25:04] here it's beyond what Satan can figure
[1:25:07] out it's beyond what the what the what
[1:25:10] the the religious world can figure out
[1:25:13] it's beyond what churches can figure
[1:25:16] out but watch now you can see
[1:25:20] why she doesn't have to go through the
[1:25:23] Great
[1:25:24] Tribulation she doesn't have to be
[1:25:26] judged at the great white
[1:25:29] Throne she's already been
[1:25:33] judged along oh church I'm going to say
[1:25:36] it again she's already been
[1:25:39] judged she has already passed from Death
[1:25:43] unto
[1:25:44] life she's already
[1:25:48] Justified she's already
[1:25:51] sanctified already filled with the Holy
[1:25:55] Ghost she is already
[1:25:59] adopted you don't believe me this
[1:26:02] morning she's already
[1:26:06] perfected she's already
[1:26:09] glorified because she came from
[1:26:12] him what do you think of Christ this
[1:26:16] morning if you don't answer that
[1:26:20] question you'll never know who you
[1:26:25] are how can you know who you are if you
[1:26:28] don't know the source or from where you
[1:26:30] came
[1:26:33] from we came from
[1:26:36] him notice this now I'm gonna throw you
[1:26:39] another
[1:26:41] one Isaiah
[1:26:44] 44:28 this is all in God's great
[1:26:48] plan when you have it you say
[1:26:51] Amen
[1:26:55] thus saith of
[1:26:57] Cyrus he is my
[1:27:01] shepherd I'm giving you so much
[1:27:04] ammunition fire at the
[1:27:08] enemy look at what God did for
[1:27:12] us thus sayith the Lord to his
[1:27:18] anointed I'm sorry thus sayith this thus
[1:27:20] sayith of Cyrus he is my shepherd I'm
[1:27:26] sorry
[1:27:28] Cyrus God's
[1:27:33] Shepherd somebody help me with
[1:27:39] this this doesn't make a whole lot of
[1:27:43] sense that God would call a heathen
[1:27:51] King
[1:27:53] his
[1:27:56] Shepherd oh the Lord is my shepherd amen
[1:28:00] mine
[1:28:01] too but he's calling Cyrus his
[1:28:09] Shepherd and shall perform all my
[1:28:14] Pleasures even saying to
[1:28:17] Jerusalem Thou shalt be
[1:28:21] built and to the
[1:28:23] temple thy Foundation shall be
[1:28:27] laid who's going to do
[1:28:29] this God using
[1:28:32] Cyrus his
[1:28:36] Shepherd I'm not done yet Isaiah 45 now
[1:28:41] we're going to kick it up a
[1:28:43] notch are you
[1:28:45] ready now he's saying to
[1:28:49] Cyrus thus sayth the Lord to his
[1:28:57] anointed to his anointed to
[1:29:01] Cyrus whose right hand I have
[1:29:07] Holden what is our right hand
[1:29:10] power the power he has I'm the one that
[1:29:13] gave it to
[1:29:15] him he is
[1:29:18] Anointed the Hebrew word
[1:29:20] there is
[1:29:26] mashia which means
[1:29:28] Messiah he just called a heathen Pagan
[1:29:32] King his
[1:29:36] Messiah what think you of Christ
[1:29:43] now his Shepherd his anointed his
[1:29:47] Messiah how do you reconcile
[1:29:50] this
[1:29:52] you don't see
[1:29:53] Christ in every
[1:29:56] verse go back and read it
[1:30:00] again are you getting it Church
[1:30:03] everything in the Old
[1:30:05] Testament is speaking of and typing
[1:30:10] Christ even King
[1:30:13] Cyrus because the temple would not be
[1:30:16] built without
[1:30:20] Christ you want another one
[1:30:24] how is Jesus known as the scapegoat when
[1:30:26] he was the Lamb of
[1:30:36] God no that's right escape goat but
[1:30:40] isn't he the Lamb of God how could he be
[1:30:43] a
[1:30:47] goat how many are getting
[1:30:49] it I'm doing that to make you think a
[1:30:51] little a little
[1:30:53] bit then it's this is the
[1:30:57] point if he can call a heathen Pagan
[1:31:01] King his Shepherd an anointed
[1:31:06] one why do we have a
[1:31:09] problem believing that we can be his
[1:31:17] bride I I I don't get
[1:31:20] it a pig
[1:31:23] and yet oh no I I'm just not
[1:31:26] worthy no I'm just not good enough
[1:31:30] nobody is asking for your
[1:31:32] goodness our
[1:31:35] righteousness our
[1:31:37] Holiness is filthy rags in the eyes of
[1:31:41] God come on church I want you to get
[1:31:44] this this morning our own
[1:31:47] righteousness is like filthy
[1:31:49] rags I I go to church
[1:31:53] and I pay my ties and I pay my offerings
[1:31:56] and I do good to the to the orphans and
[1:31:58] the
[1:32:00] widows and it can still be filthy rags
[1:32:04] in the eyes of
[1:32:06] God I'm gonna show you why in a moment
[1:32:09] now watch this this is this this is just
[1:32:11] so wonderful to
[1:32:13] me why
[1:32:15] then why are we so afraid to call
[1:32:19] ourselves the bride of Christ
[1:32:23] we came from him we died with him we
[1:32:28] resurrected with him and now we are
[1:32:31] living and dwelling in
[1:32:33] him and he in
[1:32:36] us that's what he said in that day
[1:32:39] you'll know I am in the father
[1:32:42] father you you in me all right now why
[1:32:46] are we so
[1:32:48] timid and fearful of finding our place
[1:32:50] in Christ
[1:32:53] because you made
[1:32:55] mistakes because you don't feel
[1:32:57] worthy what the enemy tells
[1:33:02] you why are we
[1:33:05] afraid picking it up a notch
[1:33:08] now why are we
[1:33:10] afraid to
[1:33:12] profess that we are
[1:33:15] kings that we are
[1:33:18] priests that we are gods are
[1:33:22] Messiahs anointed
[1:33:25] ones in Christ not outside of Christ
[1:33:30] Christ the scripture tells us that whom
[1:33:34] the word comes to are they not
[1:33:38] Gods the difference between the Old
[1:33:41] Testament and New Testament
[1:33:44] Saints in the Old
[1:33:47] Testament their lives were a
[1:33:50] shadow a type of the coming
[1:33:53] Christ the coming
[1:33:56] Messiah but in the New
[1:33:59] Testament we are not a type of
[1:34:03] Christ we are the very Temple of
[1:34:07] Christ his very Throne is in the heart
[1:34:11] of
[1:34:13] man I don't know if we believe that or
[1:34:16] not come on I'm going to say it again
[1:34:19] that's the difference they typed Christ
[1:34:23] she is
[1:34:25] Christ there's no typing here it's the
[1:34:29] reality of what it
[1:34:32] is God help us to to make this a reality
[1:34:36] in our
[1:34:37] lives change our
[1:34:41] mentality the bride doesn't type Christ
[1:34:43] she is
[1:34:47] Christ oh my how much more confident and
[1:34:51] sure should we
[1:34:54] be I want to go into this New Year's
[1:34:56] confident and
[1:35:00] sure not proud like I'm big somebody
[1:35:03] some big somebody
[1:35:05] no when she knows who she is she's
[1:35:07] humbled
[1:35:09] by but it don't take away who she
[1:35:13] is it's time we answer the
[1:35:16] question what think he of
[1:35:19] Christ he says in the message what do
[1:35:21] you say who do you say this
[1:35:23] is men and women with any Christian
[1:35:27] status at
[1:35:29] all or interested in their Eternal
[1:35:38] destination man or
[1:35:41] woman any Christian
[1:35:44] status interested in their Eternal
[1:35:48] destination they have search the
[1:35:50] scriptures
[1:35:52] and see who he
[1:35:56] was search the scriptures and then you
[1:35:59] think you have eternal life search they
[1:36:02] ought to search the scriptures and see
[1:36:05] who he was that's passed
[1:36:09] in then the question he
[1:36:12] says wouldn't have
[1:36:15] been who is
[1:36:18] this they would have had the answer
[1:36:23] he is
[1:36:26] here we're either going to get stuck on
[1:36:29] the question who is
[1:36:31] it or we're coming to the Forefront and
[1:36:34] saying he's
[1:36:35] here I'm here you're here so then he's
[1:36:43] here oh come on come on I don't know if
[1:36:46] you believe that or
[1:36:49] not I'm not looking looking anymore to
[1:36:52] answer who is this I already know who
[1:36:54] this
[1:36:55] is I I'm here to say he is
[1:37:00] here turn around
[1:37:08] here oh we're going to find out here in
[1:37:10] a moment
[1:37:11] here watch this now when you find out
[1:37:15] who he
[1:37:16] was back then then you can Proclaim
[1:37:20] today
[1:37:23] he is here remember now and I want to
[1:37:27] jump over something real quick
[1:37:29] because I don't have a clock there no
[1:37:31] more but I don't know where I'm at but
[1:37:33] but it's the last service
[1:37:35] right no second to the last
[1:37:41] service but watch this
[1:37:44] now I want to see if they can put up
[1:37:47] that that quote on who do you say this
[1:37:50] is there you
[1:37:52] go
[1:37:54] see each had their own interpretation of
[1:37:57] the
[1:37:59] word that's the reason that Israel
[1:38:02] didn't recognize
[1:38:04] Moses that's that's the reason the world
[1:38:06] didn't recognize
[1:38:09] Noah that's the reason all the prophets
[1:38:12] wasn't
[1:38:15] recognized because they have their own
[1:38:18] interpretation of the word
[1:38:22] but God in every
[1:38:25] age has had his
[1:38:32] Messiah that's some good stuff right
[1:38:34] there I'm gonna say it again in every
[1:38:37] age or some
[1:38:39] Ages Every age he has had his
[1:38:44] Messiah to reject Noah's message was to
[1:38:47] reject
[1:38:49] God to reject Noah was to
[1:38:54] perish to reject Noah was to
[1:38:57] perish to reject Moses now was to
[1:39:02] perish they were the anointed Messiah
[1:39:05] for that
[1:39:08] age oh what think he of
[1:39:10] Christ he is the identified Christ of
[1:39:13] all the
[1:39:19] ages the word that was promised for that
[1:39:22] age and when Jesus came he was the
[1:39:25] fullness of that
[1:39:27] word God
[1:39:30] himself made into a man's
[1:39:35] structure I like that with bones and
[1:39:40] flesh the Eternal
[1:39:43] God coming
[1:39:45] down and came into a man's
[1:39:50] structure bones and flesh the anointed
[1:39:54] one and
[1:39:56] they should have seen
[1:39:59] that and Moses might not have even know
[1:40:02] it
[1:40:06] himself maybe you haven't haven't
[1:40:09] haven't noticed it
[1:40:18] yourself but he was the anoint anointed
[1:40:21] word of that
[1:40:24] day he was the anointed
[1:40:27] messenger so if he was the messenger of
[1:40:30] that
[1:40:32] hour then he was the Messiah of that
[1:40:35] hour he was the anointed one and Moses
[1:40:40] went
[1:40:41] down and took these same
[1:40:44] things and showed that he was the
[1:40:47] anointed
[1:40:49] Messiah that man picked up dust off the
[1:40:54] Earth threw it into the air flies and
[1:40:58] fleas flew out of that
[1:41:01] dust and covered the
[1:41:04] Earth what could create but
[1:41:08] God that was not just a Man Called
[1:41:12] Moses that was prist in
[1:41:15] Moses come on Church he's identified in
[1:41:18] all the
[1:41:19] ages nobody else could create but
[1:41:24] God here goes Moses once again takes
[1:41:26] water out of the
[1:41:28] river he poured it upon the
[1:41:33] bank and every drop of water throughout
[1:41:39] Egypt turned to
[1:41:42] blood what could do
[1:41:46] that what was it he was so completely
[1:41:51] surrendered to
[1:41:53] God he was so completely surrendered to
[1:41:57] God's anointed
[1:42:00] word until he was the
[1:42:03] Messiah but you see they trusted in
[1:42:06] their anointed
[1:42:09] churches rather than in Christ the
[1:42:12] word so when they saw the anointed
[1:42:15] word that it was against what their
[1:42:17] Church
[1:42:19] taught they said that's
[1:42:24] fanaticism this man is a devil
[1:42:27] be why because it was contrary to their
[1:42:34] church and if Christ would walk into
[1:42:38] many churches
[1:42:40] today he would be rejected the same
[1:42:44] way it's contrary to their way of
[1:42:49] thinking
[1:42:53] they ought to have known who he
[1:42:55] was they ought to have been able to
[1:42:57] answer the question who is
[1:43:00] this Christ the anointed word of the
[1:43:03] hour he says so the Oneness of
[1:43:07] God how many believe in the Oneness of
[1:43:10] God so the Oneness of
[1:43:13] God is the word anointed in
[1:43:19] you it's the word anointed in
[1:43:26] me and
[1:43:28] then we
[1:43:31] become
[1:43:33] Sons a
[1:43:35] messiah of the
[1:43:40] age no no nobody
[1:43:44] else you're going to go through the rest
[1:43:46] of Life moping and
[1:43:49] groping we're waiting for Jesus to
[1:43:53] come where have you been who is this
[1:43:57] amongst
[1:43:58] us but we can't see him that's why it
[1:44:02] takes
[1:44:04] Faith it's the substance of things hop
[1:44:08] for the evidence of Things Not
[1:44:14] Seen are you with me or you want me to
[1:44:17] stop than I think you guys have had I
[1:44:20] think you guys have had too much
[1:44:23] holidays too food and too much
[1:44:26] everything let me just go just for a
[1:44:28] little bit
[1:44:29] more so what should we be
[1:44:33] doing searching the
[1:44:36] scriptures so that we can
[1:44:38] know he's here can you tell your
[1:44:41] neighbor neighbor he's
[1:44:43] here he's
[1:44:45] here I I I don't doubt that he's
[1:44:49] here give me a church he
[1:44:52] says that's so completely Anointed with
[1:44:58] god Till every action and
[1:45:03] move is thus sayth the
[1:45:06] Lord and walk in that Shina
[1:45:10] glory and I'll show you a
[1:45:14] messiah anointed one of God standing
[1:45:18] upon the
[1:45:19] Earth
[1:45:21] if we fail to give this and get this to
[1:45:23] the Next
[1:45:27] Generation we have failed
[1:45:30] miserably if we do not manifest
[1:45:33] it through our
[1:45:36] flesh we must transfer this to our
[1:45:39] children and that's the way the message
[1:45:42] is you can sympathize with it and say
[1:45:47] yeah it's
[1:45:48] right but you've got to take it to
[1:45:52] yourself and become part of
[1:45:55] it then you and the message become
[1:46:00] one then the anointing is with
[1:46:03] you as it is with the
[1:46:11] others when we look at
[1:46:16] this and we see what he is doing in our
[1:46:19] midst
[1:46:24] he's not a god that is way out
[1:46:28] there he's a personal
[1:46:33] God he didn't come to redeem
[1:46:37] everybody he came to redeem those that
[1:46:39] were
[1:46:42] redeemable amen amen now now notice this
[1:46:45] now time hasn't
[1:46:47] changed people are designed the same
[1:46:51] but yet Jesus Christ is the same
[1:46:53] yesterday today and
[1:46:55] forever the question he says isn't to
[1:46:58] them
[1:47:00] anymore listen closely the question
[1:47:03] isn't to them
[1:47:06] anymore
[1:47:07] no they asked who it
[1:47:11] is but in
[1:47:14] 1964 the question is who do you say that
[1:47:18] it
[1:47:19] is oh he's challenging their faith
[1:47:22] right that's
[1:47:24] them what do you say watch what he says
[1:47:28] what's this all
[1:47:30] about have you stopped to search the
[1:47:34] scriptures who do you think it this
[1:47:36] is is it mental
[1:47:39] telepathy is it some wild something out
[1:47:42] of the
[1:47:44] Wilderness like John was a wild
[1:47:47] man drowning people in water out
[1:47:51] there but Isaiah said that he would be
[1:47:54] the
[1:47:55] Forerunner and Malachi said he would be
[1:47:58] there just
[1:48:00] exactly so this Prophet finally arises
[1:48:03] on the
[1:48:05] scene
[1:48:07] forun his first
[1:48:10] coming but in this
[1:48:12] age we hear this voice from
[1:48:16] Heaven as John the
[1:48:18] Baptist ran my first
[1:48:21] coming so shall your
[1:48:23] message for run my second
[1:48:27] coming oh my we're getting down
[1:48:30] nitty-gritty now watch this as we see
[1:48:33] this unfolding in our
[1:48:36] midst they missed him in 1964
[1:48:41] too oh there were a few that caught
[1:48:45] it because God always has his elect that
[1:48:48] catches
[1:48:49] it but let's bring it to
[1:48:55] 2023 who do you think this
[1:49:00] is it's easy to talk about history
[1:49:03] huh ah look at those unbelievers back
[1:49:06] then
[1:49:12] to the Holy Ghost in you will punctuate
[1:49:15] every word with an
[1:49:19] amen says something you say that's the
[1:49:23] truth because you're agreed with the
[1:49:26] word you're agreed with God you and God
[1:49:30] are one God is in you you're his son or
[1:49:34] his
[1:49:35] daughter and that makes you a messiah
[1:49:38] for
[1:49:40] him here's the thing now once again that
[1:49:43] makes
[1:49:44] you a messiah for
[1:49:48] him the anointed word living out in
[1:49:53] you let us this
[1:49:57] 2024 I don't want to walk into
[1:50:02] 2024 I don't want to stumble into
[1:50:06] 2024 I want to run into

[1:51:02] truck then we get to the
[1:51:05] place down the road they cross in front
[1:51:08] of
[1:51:09] us they're going up this m the
[1:51:11] mountain we go after them I spp and fall
[1:51:15] and get my rifle in the
[1:51:18] scope happens Robert after
[1:51:22] that it's like the Hunts

[1:51:30] else well brother Ben brother Mark they
[1:51:32] were very nice you can use our my

[1:51:37] your own
[1:51:38] rifle you're comfortable you know what
[1:51:40] what you can do with
[1:51:43] that so we we a few times we had such a
[1:51:47] such a good uh we had a good strategy
[1:51:51] and here we see these they're at the
[1:51:53] very top of this
[1:51:56] Ridge and and well we think we're we're
[1:51:59] I don't claim to be a good Hunter but I
[1:52:01] mean I can hold my own at
[1:52:05] least we say well let's go around this
[1:52:08] mountain and by the time we get around
[1:52:10] we'll meet up with
[1:52:14] them it seems like that's the way we are
[1:52:16] in
[1:52:17] life we got all these great plans and
[1:52:20] how they're going to work
[1:52:23] out so here we go climbing this
[1:52:26] mountain around and what a
[1:52:29] climb and as we come around the
[1:52:32] corner looking and I don't see them no
[1:52:35] more there's no way they could have
[1:52:37] outsmarted
[1:52:39] me we all we always think like
[1:52:43] that no there ain't no
[1:52:45] way I've been in the message a long time
[1:52:48] no way I can be out
[1:52:50] well I'm looking over
[1:52:52] here this little Hill over here I see
[1:52:56] movement they're all covered all over
[1:52:58] this
[1:53:00] mountain right
[1:53:02] there and so we we slowly we're
[1:53:05] like each one is setting
[1:53:07] up there about 30 40 of them there 180
[1:53:12] yards like oh yeah this is going to be
[1:53:16] easy Benny was on his belly on the floor
[1:53:22] Mark was on the tripod he was
[1:53:25] ready I was by the fence ready to
[1:53:28] go and right when we're ready
[1:53:31] okay the Sun comes right over the
[1:53:34] hill and all of us are
[1:53:38] like
[1:53:39] whoa where they at they're right
[1:53:43] there uhuh no we could not for the life
[1:53:47] of
[1:53:48] us what we didn't take into
[1:53:53] consideration was that God even gives
[1:53:55] the animals an opportunity to defend
[1:53:59] themselves nature tells us
[1:54:04] that we didn't get
[1:54:08] nothing they were right there you close
[1:54:11] your eyes and you can just see them
[1:54:14] oh so the next day we try again go this
[1:54:19] mountain
[1:54:21] right we see him again this time we're
[1:54:23] on right on the line of one Ranch to
[1:54:28] another and right below I kid you not
[1:54:32] talk to brother Mark and brother Ben
[1:54:34] there was four the largest barbery sheep
[1:54:37] I we have ever
[1:54:40] seen and there was aund of them at
[1:54:43] least Valley and we were looking at them
[1:54:47] like all right they're close
[1:54:51] but what do they do Ben he calls
[1:54:55] the right on them but it's on the other
[1:54:59] property what do you
[1:55:02] do you can see that nice big trophy on
[1:55:05] your
[1:55:07] wall and then you can see a little in
[1:55:10] the
[1:55:11] future every time I would look at that
[1:55:14] thing I would I would see you killed it
[1:55:17] on private property
[1:55:22] I said Brothers we know
[1:55:24] better I'd rather have a good night's
[1:55:27] sleep and have my conscience
[1:55:30] clear to go against the
[1:55:32] law what do we do we let
[1:55:36] them but through it all we were learning
[1:55:41] something showing us
[1:55:43] something it was such a wonderful
[1:55:46] time that I got some rest that I I
[1:55:50] needed more important than a barber
[1:55:54] sheep you see how God began to move and
[1:55:56] how he tested us and and see what are
[1:55:58] you gonna
[1:56:01] do I'll let this big old giant right in
[1:56:04] front of you
[1:56:05] up and I say no Lord I've got to be
[1:56:10] disciplined so much in life we lose the
[1:56:15] discipline our
[1:56:18] wants and in the midst of all that start
[1:56:22] coming down the
[1:56:23] mountain and I'm like wow it was a good
[1:56:27] time when all of a sudden I I kid you
[1:56:31] not I do not tell you a
[1:56:34] lie I'm walking in front of brother Ben
[1:56:37] and brother
[1:56:38] Mark and the faucet
[1:56:41] opens and the inspiration comes and then
[1:56:44] I knew why I
[1:56:47] went greater than the barber sheep hunt
[1:56:51] it was a moment with
[1:56:53] God and and this is what he quoted to me
[1:56:57] Matthew 7:22 through 23
[1:57:01] M and he says this watch watch how
[1:57:04] important this
[1:57:06] is and this is the holy spirit he's
[1:57:08] quoting me this
[1:57:11] scripture many will say to me in that
[1:57:16] day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in
[1:57:20] thy
[1:57:21] name and in thy name have cast out
[1:57:25] devils and in thy name done many
[1:57:28] wonderful
[1:57:30] works and then will I profess unto
[1:57:35] them I never knew you depart from me ye
[1:57:40] that work
[1:57:42] iniquity he asked me this question
[1:57:45] then why did I not know them
[1:57:50] why will they not be
[1:57:53] accepted when they did all these things
[1:57:56] in my
[1:57:58] name what a
[1:58:00] question I said Lord what are you
[1:58:02] getting
[1:58:03] at he said read it
[1:58:05] again Lord
[1:58:07] Lord this is the way I've always read
[1:58:10] it have we not prophesied in thy
[1:58:13] name Focus has always been in thy
[1:58:18] name where did they miss it I said Lord
[1:58:21] I I I I don't
[1:58:23] know and then he said asked me this
[1:58:26] question now now thinking remember I'm
[1:58:28] walking down the
[1:58:29] mountain hear him talking to me and he
[1:58:33] says was it the Acts of the
[1:58:37] Apostles I said no sir what was it it
[1:58:40] was the acts of the Holy
[1:58:43] Ghost in the
[1:58:46] apostles that did the
[1:58:48] work them as men but it was me in them
[1:58:53] did The Works he said now read it again
[1:58:57] Lord Lord have we boom I had missed the
[1:59:01] two-letter
[1:59:04] word this is where they missed
[1:59:07] it have we not prophesied in thy
[1:59:13] name and in thy name cast out devils and
[1:59:17] in thy name done many wonders F
[1:59:20] Works he said do you see the
[1:59:23] key it is we they said we have done this
[1:59:27] in thy
[1:59:29] name and when they use
[1:59:32] we it is as filthy
[1:59:38] rags it was never me in them doing
[1:59:43] it Joel said that in the last days I
[1:59:48] pour out my spirit upon All
[1:59:52] Flesh yet not all flesh is
[1:59:55] saved so they did that because the
[1:59:58] anointing was here but they did it was
[2:00:02] never God in them doing
[2:00:05] it he said our your Holiness and
[2:00:08] righteousness is as filthy
[2:00:11] rags but my bride I dwell in her I have
[2:00:16] preeminence in
[2:00:17] her it is me that does the works through
[2:00:22] her you know what that makes you
[2:00:26] feel it makes you check your
[2:00:29] life and I'm walking down and I'm just
[2:00:32] start
[2:00:34] crying Lord have I
[2:00:36] ever said look what we have
[2:00:41] done Lord have we look what we have done
[2:00:45] over
[2:00:46] here look what we are doing Lord if I
[2:00:50] have ever used the phrase we or me or
[2:00:55] I Forgive Me Lord I don't want to get
[2:00:59] there on that
[2:01:00] day you say depart from me I didn't know
[2:01:05] you I said Lord please forgive
[2:01:08] me it makes us watch our
[2:01:12] words know who we are but we got to know

[2:11:12] of

[2:11:16] nation you you are a chosen
[2:11:20] generation a royal
[2:11:23] priesthood a holy
[2:11:25] nation A peculiar
[2:11:28] people that ye should show forth the
[2:11:32] Praises of him who hath called you out
[2:11:35] of
[2:11:37] Darkness Into His Marvelous
[2:11:40] Light that's what he came to
[2:11:44] do the sixfold purpose
[2:11:49] the sixfold
[2:11:50] purpose one of them was to anoint the
[2:11:53] most
[2:11:54] holy this is our pastor our founding
[2:12:00] Pastor the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's
[2:12:02] visit was to
[2:12:07] anoint many said oh that's
[2:12:11] Jesus brother brandham
[2:12:14] says that's not
[2:12:17] Jesus
[2:12:19] he's already been
[2:12:23] anointed he said that's the tent or the
[2:12:29] Tabernacle that will be used in the
[2:12:33] Millennium now that's the anointing of
[2:12:36] God that comes upon this
[2:12:41] tent that's why he
[2:12:43] says of all the Visions I've
[2:12:47] had all of them have been fulfilled
[2:12:50] except the
[2:12:52] tent but the tent that's where the
[2:12:55] anointing comes
[2:12:58] from I'm sorry that's where the
[2:13:00] anointing
[2:13:02] comes and the tent is not
[2:13:08] canvas it's
[2:13:11] flesh and then he says it again it's
[2:13:15] flesh so then where do they get all
[2:13:17] these little
[2:13:20] ideas that it's a tent made of
[2:13:25] canvas God don't deal with
[2:13:28] canvas God deals with human
[2:13:32] beings with
