god like you would never believe i believe of a great caliber uh they were out hunting and you know my uncle abraham knows everything about where he's at hunting [Music] but he said that mountain is called three arrow mountains and everybody would was was like in awe because you know uncle abraham knows everything else and so he looks and he says you know why we called it why i call it three arrow mountains he's a man of of great stature amongst us just just one more solomon they were going in a in a four-wheel drive even in coming coming into the contraction is is the great greatest greatest man and i i have so many stories to tell about him there was uh where we could just get in his green the green uh monster the green sherman tank i don't know if any of you that ever had a privilege to ride in that sherman tank it went everywhere over trees over mountains everywhere that's when people would still go out into the outdoors we still do but but yeah but it was a time and i tell my wife this we yeah have to do much of a great thing to to have a great time i remember my mama she she'd go and she'd uh she'd pack up some burritos burritos by the time we would eat them they were cold and to this day that's the way i like to eat a bean burrito is cold and so we would eat bean burritos and some pepsis pepsi and we just be going and park under a tree i had the privilege to have some of the greatest ants and uncles upon the face of the world people added what they needed to add to your life i i i got to say one more thing when i was a kid well [Music] well i was going to say when i was a kid i was a bad kid but but i'm i'm still bad but i did i did something really bad and i'm not going to fail but but but i did something bad if you want to know the details you can ask me after church but i did something bad and uh and this is when i really knew my uncle was he was on my my mom was like i thought we were in the message things like this were not supposed to happen my uncle is on the other side of my dad as my dad's talking to me about [Applause] we're grateful to god for what he has done for us happy to see brother kenny here welcome brother kenny [Applause] and uh we go back really far but that's brother kenny grateful and thankful to god because such a dear mama that she gave us and we actually buried her on her birthday you know the bible does not does not mince words neither does it means exactly what it says unless a corn of wheat fall to the ground and die it'll bring forth much so we're grateful to the lord day that we get closer to being able to see her one day we're grateful to god for what he's given us i'm going to ask you to stand really quickly now and in the book of isaiah in the libra de isaiah the 48th chapter in the 22nd verse and i want to thank our pastor for the opportunity for the confidence there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked lord jesus we come before you and ask you father that you'll give us our daily portion when it is all over we'll be sure to give you all the honor and all the glory [Music] for you alone deserve it we are grateful to you thankful to you you know the bible talks to us and it says casting all your care upon him for he careth for you as we were in the in the funeral of brother larry khan khan the next day uh a brother jimmy garcia from from san diego garcia de san diego made these these declarations and i want to tell you this morning that you are precious in the eyes of god as you see in the scripture there is no peace no i pass saith the lord and to the wicked and we are not here to declare who is wicked and who is not but what we want to do is to is to maybe challenge your faith just a little bit i want to entitle my our message this morning a life worth giving birth to ona in our our speaking this morning i want to for you to take at the very initial word time the the word anxiety and worry we're not going to cabbage down on it we're going to tell you just what it is anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows but only empties today of its [Music] quit worrying then because it is simple sinful and produces fear worry is a disease that causes other ills it borrows trouble that cannot be paid back about all of this can you imagine every day wondering what is going to happen tomorrow there was a story of a man that said and he put his name and you can put your name there thomas was tired of worrying so he hired a man for a thousand dollars a week so that this man could worry for him he said well how are you going to pay him mental and physical suicide is mentally physical worry is a grave digger that has no sympathy it is a needless and wasted time and effort [Music] that should be spent on worthwhile things it produces guilty because eventually then you start feeling guilty and then you have regrets of things that maybe you should have done that is called worry and anxiety like an orphan without a heavenly father the sparrows were having a conversation one day and they would say look at the humans that they're going and they're anxious and they're worrying and spinning as they go and one sparrow says maybe they yellow i wonder if god will save me he already did i wonder if he will heal me he already did yeah it's a crime against god but many people do not want to go through the problem i want you to notice it is a valley of the shadow of death even though i walk through it camping there no mr it's cruel for you to to think every day if i could only if i could only live yesterday again if i could only live back by tomorrow so don't worry about tomorrow is amnesia because we don't remember where we came from when we don't remember where we came from we don't know where we're going i was then this would not happen i can tell you why the reason that things happen it is the love of god it is the peace of god that passes all understand when then should we go home is when you got to remember the story of uh of the prodigal son yesterday how many know that the lord jesus is rich in everything and he he wanted his blessing everything right now if god was to give you all the blessings that are yours right now you couldn't contain them but we all want them right now we want to feel rich right now we want to feel important i think that sometimes we forget that and the cause is that maybe we we want to live really really what we should be in this world and as this world is a man he he he comes to the understanding what is then the most perfect thing and the most understanding thing and what what what what is that that draws you what what what is what is your priority in life when i see you i see god i see god when i see you i see life when i see you i said [Applause] amen backsliding is a form of insanity it is insane to walk away from the lord and all his blessings that's why i love we love my uncle abraham so much the only way you take me out of cedar hills foreign we might have and i do we waited for him at home and he got all the blessings the bible says that he went and acted like he was homeless and spent things like he didn't have that and that was going to be done tomorrow he's in a pig's pen when the bible says that he came to himself in other words he's right here the promise is right there he's eating with the pigs right here my father's house they have plenty to eat what should i live in is my father's when a believer is out of fellowship with the lord how do you get when you don't come to church for a little while the song says raise your hand and you try with all your heart but when there's a person that really loves the lord you don't have to say raise your hand you can put your hands in your pockets what does that show you're homeless but when you're in the house of the lord come on now man and you hear it and absolutely private you know why they returned home when he returned home he said i'll go to my father not saying father i've sinned. against thee and against heaven i'm no more than i i can't be called your your son make me one of your i gotta tell you [Applause] hallelujah [Music] we look to the scripture a man named elijah elias according to scripture brother david yes jesus christ the son of god see jesus he ascended upon him but the bible says he died he died to take away our sins so according to scripture enoch enoch and elijah elias were the only ones that did not see death [Laughter] it why is that so important to us because jesus said jesus he that believeth in me created me shall never die [Applause] you you can come home now if you believe you can come home now that believeth in me shall never die [Applause] how is it that we never die because we believed a message from a man that never died amen but when he comes to the understanding of the word of god that death to a believer is then just a vehicle i will be alive more than at that time any other oh we took care of him the bible tells us then we come to the knowledge of the truth here's the prodigal son he comes to himself but he rehearses what he has got inside of him the father has different plans for him but he already knew who to go to but but our words produce producing the tomorrow well i already knew it was going to be half cloudy yes so heart part cloudy part you won't even say part partly sunny no positive well i always knew that the cup was olives you almost drink all of it it's half empty yes it's not half full nostalgia [Music] well you just don't know my sorrows tomorrow manana they're going to be worse let's not feel tomorrow you're going to be worse eman you know you know tomorrow i'm going to be sicker than today and you're going to be sick today oh i never had a boyfriend i'm never going to have when the girl says you're but when you come to yourself i'm going to say it again when you come home to where the blessings are at today is partly sunny he already knows my tomorrow he saw his and you will never ever get anything from god until you get in he said if you see me when i go away if you see me without knowing no death so powerful was that spirit of elijah was the spirit of elias that he was going to use it five times out of sinkhole you said how come what he says he said john the baptist came in the spirit and power of [Music] jesus christ then you can have anything because i want a double portion of your spirit the bible says when he sees him the man told elijah falls and elisha eliseo had already had a life but this was a life now worth giving birth and how does he know that that spirit is with him he goes to a river called death and he takes the mantle of elijah and he cries out where is the god of elijah the river jordan which is a separation called death this was not the first time that the water divided hither and feathers because it didn't happen in the time of moses but this was another pair of gentlemen place to or towards that place okay okay so so he he divides the water he divides the water over here and over there right okay okay [Music] but it's got to bring birth to something the converter a million germs went out uh a million eggs went out of saline him in that purpose divided the hitler from the cedar and said he will accept the message and what's the parameters of the man that never die [Music] [Applause] here is the hither yaki okay okay thank you here is the hither here is an interruption of nature according to brother branham in the sixth seal don't forget [Music] of all [Music] giving i welcome home [Applause] is a plan of redemption but under the seventh seal when he manifests himself he just has what is the seventh seal to finish now what is it it is the coming of the lord then what is it to you it's when you it's going to stand are made known through the message of the hour now because i got together with other men and people of the and that's why people say we don't need this we don't know we need that no more we need it more now than ever where then did if he gave it to the church where then did he take it away that brings back the waters to one here we go to the
