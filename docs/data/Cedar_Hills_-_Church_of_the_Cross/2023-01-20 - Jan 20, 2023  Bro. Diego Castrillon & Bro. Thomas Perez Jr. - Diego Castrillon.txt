know is that this scripture was given to us for specifically for tonight we rest in his word tonight Ezekiel chapter 8 verse 6. the Ramos gracias we give thanks to our pastor for giving us the opportunity to be part of the program tonight we asked the Lord that he would help us this beautiful evening let's read Ezekiel chapter 8 and verse 6. majority he said furthermore unto me son of man see us thou what they do even the great Abominations that the house of Israel committeth here that I should go far off from My Sanctuary but turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater Abominations foreign and he brought me to the door of the court and when I looked Behold a hole in the wall images then he said then said here unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when I dig in the wall behold the door and he said unto me go in and Behold The Wicked Abominations that they do here is so I went in and saw and beheld every form of creeping thing and abominable beasts and all of the idols of the House of Israel portrayed upon the wall round about it and there stood before them 70 men of the Ancients of the House of Israel and in the midst of them stood just jazzaniah the son of saffin with every man his sensor in his hand and a thick cloud of incense went up Tierra then said here unto me son of man has thou seen what the Ancients of the House of Israel do in the dark every man in the chambers of his imagery for they say the Lord seeth us not the Lord hath forsaken the Earth he also said he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater Abominations that they do foreign then he brought me to the door of the Gate of the Lord's House which was towards the North and behold their sad woman weeping for tamus is then said here unto me has thou seen this o son of man turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater Abominations than these image oriente and he brought me to the inner Court of the Lord's House and between at the door of the Temple of the Lord between the porch and the altar were about 20 we're about Five and Twenty men with their backs towards the Temple of the Lord and their faces towards the east and they worship the sun towards the east let's go to verse 18.in [Music] therefore will I also deal in Fury mine I shall not spare neither will I have pity and through and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will I not hear them let us pray Lord Jesus good evening your Prophet Ezekiel was inspired to bring this word and Lord now you've brought it before us and we rest yes that that same inspiration father that would come on the scene and they would open these scriptures keep us keep us firm and and continuing on Lord Jesus Christ that this be done in the name of the Lord Jesus Como please take your seats and be comfortable I want for you to follow me on this journey what the prophet Ezekiel is trying to show us how God the word says Jehovah he took me in a vision and he took me in between the Heaven and the Earth and while this took place the word of God came to me and he said Son of Man see is thou not this is why do you not speak why don't you see it the Abominations that the house of Israel are doing and Jehovah said to the prophet imira looks majores because you're gonna see worse Abominations and the prophet Ezekiel said that he was taken to a place that there was a hole in the wall where he could see how the Elders of the House of Israel had found themselves with incense yes and we're doing abominable or horrible things was that they said that Jehovah did not saying Jehovah was no longer on the Earth and the prophet says okay and the Lord took me again and he said look to the Easter because they hadn't finished there's things even worse than this the women they were singing to tamus amen propheta propheteers do you not fear Ezekiel images and the Lord showed me the prophet Ezekiel said he took me inside between the temple between the entrance and the pulpitones and he saw 20 and five minutes with their back worshiping the Sun what a word for a people yes this word did not come to it this prophecy didn't come to people that didn't know God this this word did not come to people that never knew the word this prophecy came to a people okay that was called through Moses the first thing that Moses knew of God was that God told him Moses because the place that you're at is Holy Ground Santo what did that Holy Ground do Santo God made it holy foreign I want you to catch these words I don't know I didn't call you I can't heal you a people that should be serving God actually cuando cuando say yes God when Isaiah he had the vision when it says in Isaiah chapter six when I was taken and I saw God on his throne foreign you need to turn your families God demands Holiness this happened back there and tonight the lord gave me a vision Brothers I could see such a beautiful house that's a real modern house and I said wow what a beautiful Perfecto everything looked just perfect but there was something that didn't fit in the scene there was Weeds that were growing up all around the outside of this house and I could see more of the house because the because the weeds weren't there and you know what the worst part was they were greens there was something that was feeding now I ask you tonight God told the prophet Ezekiel I will judge I won't hear you I'm gonna chase you yes Here We Are Tonight with needs and petitions but if God didn't have mercy back there oh yeah I asked today are we better than the people of Israel no sir yes God no says here we're not speakers to see all the things that people do high hidden all these weeds type that there's so much resentment in the people of God a people were called to have joy preference they'd rather be bitter [Music] isn't there power foreign there's no holiness Holiness it's different everywhere difference of a holy church without spotter blemish ministros ministers proud Hermano
