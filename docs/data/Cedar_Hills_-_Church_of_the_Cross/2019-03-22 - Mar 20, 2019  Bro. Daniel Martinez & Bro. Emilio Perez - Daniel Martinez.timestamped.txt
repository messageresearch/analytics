[19:24] 2007 a group of deep sea divers
[19:27] discovered a fale octopus clinging to
[19:30] the rocky ledge of a Canyon located
[19:34] 4,600 ft below the ocean
[19:37] surface she was
[19:39] guarding 160 minut milky teardrops
[19:43] cemented to the Rock her eggs her
[19:47] children for the female octopus laying
[19:51] eggs marks the Glorious beginning of an
[19:53] inevitable end she covers them defends
[19:58] them them Wass currents of water so they
[20:01] continuously have fresh oxygenated
[20:04] water the deep sea divers watched her
[20:07] for 53 months and for 53 months she
[20:12] remained brooding over her young never
[20:16] leaving their side never even taking a
[20:19] moment to
[20:20] eat in 2011 the deep sea divers found
[20:25] that her eggs had successfully hatched
[20:28] leaving their empty capsules the husks

[24:23] love God bless you this
[24:26] evening how many are happy to be
[24:30] here tired but we're
[24:34] here nervous but we're
[24:38] here let us
[24:40] uh just right quick turn to Matthew
[24:55] 2626 and and as they they were
[24:58] eating Jesus Took bread and blessed
[25:02] it and break it and gave it to the
[25:06] disciples and said take ye this is my
[25:24] body I'm going to repeat this one more
[25:26] time just this part
[25:28] it and he break
[25:34] it let us pray heavenly father as we
[25:37] give you thanks tonight for another day
[25:39] of life giving us
[25:42] Lord thank you for being our
[25:47] provider we ask that you put me to a
[25:49] side
[25:51] Lord there's nothing good in me that
[25:53] could help your people
[25:56] Lord
[25:58] but if you speak to your people
[26:00] Lord it'll be a great
[26:03] help we thank you and we love
[26:06] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[26:09] Christ amen you may be
[26:12] SE I just want to speak a little bit
[26:17] tonight have you all ever um allowed God
[26:20] to maybe you've been broken in
[26:26] life maybe with physic
[26:32] physically
[26:34] spiritually have you ever allowed God to
[26:36] break you
[26:39] sometimes you know that's the only way
[26:42] when you go through a
[26:46] trial that's the only way God will move
[26:48] if you if you have a
[26:54] trial sometimes we want handouts
[27:02] and and it's not always that
[27:05] way and if you notice the scripture say
[27:07] that he blessed
[27:11] it and then he broke
[27:14] it sometimes God will bless
[27:17] you and then he'll break you into
[27:20] pieces if you want to be
[27:23] multiplied let them break you a little
[27:26] bit you might said why am I going
[27:28] through these
[27:31] trials he broke those five loaves of
[27:35] bread when that little kid was walking
[27:40] by he said what do you have that there
[27:42] in your lunch
[27:45] boox he goes well I have fish and
[27:49] bread for one little kid he multiplied
[27:56] 5,000 so I could just imagine when that
[27:58] kid got
[28:01] home and the mom opens the lunch
[28:05] box but mine will always be
[28:09] empty and he goes well we just say his
[28:13] name is
[28:15] John goes what happened how come you
[28:17] didn't eat your lunch at
[28:21] school mom if you only knew what
[28:24] happened but sometimes we go through a
[28:26] lot of Trials
[28:31] we become real deep
[28:36] thinkers and then all of a sudden we
[28:38] have a nervous breakdown because we
[28:39] become so great
[28:44] thinkers and that's why the devil has
[28:48] us or sometimes we think it's
[28:53] him we want a
[28:56] testimony
[28:58] but we don't want to
[28:59] test we won't compromise with
[29:03] nothing you know we got to stand for
[29:05] God's
[29:07] word we cannot stagger
[29:19] nowhere we cannot be uh just doing
[29:22] whatever we
[29:25] want and then you read in job
[29:29] 22 I like this
[29:33] part and the Lord said unto
[29:36] Satan from whence comest
[29:40] thou and Satan answered
[29:44] Lord and
[29:47] said Lord tell Satan where have you
[29:52] been oh I just been to and
[29:56] fro here in the earth
[29:59] walking up and down up and
[30:02] down did you know God is the
[30:07] one was the one that picked the fight
[30:09] for
[30:10] him andtime God will pick a fight for
[30:16] you have you considered my bride over
[30:18] here
[30:21] lastas and he'll will pick a fight for
[30:25] you and sometimes we think oh well the
[30:28] devil maybe do
[30:32] this but sometimes we don't understand
[30:34] that God is permitting
[30:38] things God is the one that's doing
[30:42] this because he has confidence in
[30:45] you that you can withstand the
[30:50] trial you know as I was reading um the
[30:53] other day in Matthew
[30:56] 26:39
[30:58] when it says
[30:59] father if it is
[31:03] possible let this cup pass before
[31:06] me but
[31:08] nevertheless not not as I my
[31:12] will but let thy will be done now if
[31:15] Jesus wouldn't have finished that
[31:22] sentence if you would have have said thy
[31:25] will you and I we wouldn't be
[31:29] here so we got to thank the Lord for
[31:32] that sacrifice that he made
[31:35] for you know God will Crown you at your
[31:38] weakest
[31:43] moment when you are tired and
[31:46] weary when you endureth all
[31:50] temptation and that's when he will you
[31:52] will receive the crown of
[31:55] life that change your body
[31:59] my question what is a
[32:04] trial is trying and testing
[32:10] claims that are made causing a person to
[32:13] prove their
[32:19] claim so faith that is never been
[32:23] tested cannot prove its
[32:26] claim
[32:28] so you have to be certain of
[32:32] God he loves to put your he loves to put
[32:35] your faith in
[32:37] action he will test you to see how
[32:41] you're going to
[32:42] react and sometimes we don't react too
[32:46] good sometimes I don't react too
[32:49] good because I let my flesh get in the
[32:54] way now you could do faith will make you
[32:57] do great
[32:59] Miracles and still doesn't come from a
[33:01] spiritual
[33:03] heart your your actions
[33:06] prove what you
[33:09] are no I was um reading the the
[33:12] sculpture
[33:18] Michelangelo mangelo of
[33:20] Moses for many years he was building
[33:23] this image or this
[33:25] sculpture
[33:30] trials sweat tears
[33:35] everything was
[33:39] criticized people tell him all kinds of
[33:41] stuff I
[33:45] imagine he had a
[33:49] vision Paul
[33:52] says we don't have
[33:55] vision people
[33:58] perish so he had a
[34:02] vision when he made this
[34:06] sculpture when he finished
[34:09] that he said this is perfect it's a
[34:12] masterpiece was so
[34:15] perfect but what made it perfect as a
[34:21] masterpiece brother bham
[34:24] said on his right above his right knee s
[34:31] Ines he struck it he hit it with a
[34:35] hammer and he said
[34:37] speak it was so
[34:39] perfect but brother bam said what made
[34:42] it a a
[34:45] masterpiece it was a flaw that the part
[34:48] where you hit it with a
[34:52] hammer he wanted to
[34:55] speak
[34:58] many times we go through a lot of
[35:01] Trials we don't have no
[35:04] job we don't have we're
[35:07] sick financial problems uh uh uh
[35:15] uh and all of a sudden we get hit by
[35:19] that and that's a
[35:22] trial what makes you so perfect right
[35:25] now
[35:27] what makes you a
[35:31] masterpiece you are a
[35:34] masterpiece you might say oh no I'm not
[35:36] cuz you're looking at the
[35:39] flesh it's your flaw your mistakes where
[35:42] you've been hit in
[35:49] life that is what makes you
[35:52] perfect you're the
[35:55] Masterpiece in God's eyes
[35:58] he just sees the blood over
[36:00] you it's the blood that covers
[36:04] Us that overshadow
[36:09] Mary it'll cover you too it will
[36:12] overshadow
[36:14] you let it be according to Thy
[36:19] word sometimes uh we go through we meet
[36:23] a lot of challenges in
[36:25] life
[36:29] you are
[36:32] predestinated to meet the challenge of
[36:34] this
[36:37] AG the Bible talks about Jesus about
[36:40] Jesus
[36:43] coming about his
[36:45] coming but the same thing it talks about
[36:48] your coming
[36:50] also we will not bow to any
[36:55] spirit
[36:58] or any any
[37:00] devil because we are people of
[37:04] Victory it's your position it's your
[37:08] anointing don't let the devil take it
[37:10] away from
[37:11] you what's inside of
[37:14] you is
[37:16] greater greater see that is in
[37:19] you he that is in the
[37:22] world it's not greater in you that's in
[37:25] you
[37:28] it's greater is he that is in
[37:31] you you know and U I was reading here in
[37:34] uh in
[37:38] James
[37:41] 122 be doers of the word and not
[37:45] hearers only deceiving your own
[37:55] selves sometimes times we just are
[37:57] hearers of the
[38:00] word but we're not doers of the
[38:04] word and that causes
[38:08] problems brother brandham
[38:11] says that we are U that he will write
[38:15] this Trail
[38:18] again he didn't say
[38:20] I he said
[38:23] we we will do it
[38:27] and that's what we're doing
[38:28] now bringing forth the
[38:35] message bringing the word
[38:38] out in its
[38:40] fullness that's what we're doing
[38:42] now that's why we are
[38:44] here we are listening to the
[38:48] messages and and that's why we're doing
[38:51] eating the
[38:54] word it's when you read the message you
[38:56] hear the
[39:00] tapes it's dead to
[39:02] us until it comes Liv in
[39:06] us that's the only way God will manifest
[39:11] himself you got to bring that dead
[39:12] letter out of the book
[39:16] book bring it inside of
[39:19] you you you might say well I'm not
[39:22] worthy of
[39:25] that you have 10,000
[39:29] losses but you're still an
[39:32] overcomer you're not a
[39:35] failer you know the Lord will help us
[39:37] through the
[39:39] battle over and
[39:42] over and the and the Lord will tell
[39:44] you now it's your
[39:47] turn it's like when you go to
[39:50] school the teacher you you you go to
[39:52] school for a whole
[39:55] year the teacher is helping you through
[39:57] the through those
[40:00] courses he's there watching you helping
[40:04] you at until the end of the
[40:07] year you have to do an exam and you're
[40:09] by
[40:11] yourself that's the way God
[40:13] is God is helping you through the
[40:17] road and he'll say Daniel I have
[40:20] confidence to you let's see what you can
[40:24] do and sometimes we get exhausted
[40:29] fatigue we we get
[40:31] tired you know and I know we all go
[40:34] through
[40:36] battles go through
[40:38] trials
[40:41] tribulations you got to remember one
[40:46] thing it's not you getting the
[40:50] victory it is God getting the
[40:54] victory you're not using God to get your
[40:59] Victory God is using
[41:02] you to get his
[41:04] victory the battle's not
[41:07] yours it belongs to
[41:09] God all you have to do is show
[41:14] up you know I was reading our brother
[41:16] bham he says
[41:19] this I really like
[41:24] this God's covenant with Abra
[41:30] paragraph
[41:34] 34 now watch
[41:37] Jesus he could have
[41:39] used his
[41:42] power but he did
[41:44] it he used his
[41:47] word he
[41:49] said it is
[41:51] written know he was so
[41:53] calm but whenever I have an issue or
[41:56] problem
[41:59] we want to start yelling right
[42:01] away but if he was so
[42:04] calm it is
[42:06] written men shall not live by bread
[42:09] alone but but every word that proceedeth
[42:12] out of the mouth of
[42:15] God and this is the part that really
[42:18] stood out to
[42:21] me and he stood there three
[42:25] times defeated Satan all three
[42:30] times three is a confirmation of a
[42:35] witness and brother says
[42:38] amen he defeated Satan on his own
[42:43] ground with the word of
[42:46] God though now this is right here it
[42:49] really it really hit
[42:52] me the weakest
[42:55] Christian
[42:56] here
[42:57] tonight can defeat
[43:00] Satan
[43:03] anywhere any place any time under any
[43:07] any
[43:09] condition and he said it's thus sayth
[43:12] the
[43:14] Lord what else do we worry
[43:17] about why do why why do I
[43:20] worry I got to get rid of my
[43:24] complex but if I to dominate
[43:27] me I will never I can't never
[43:30] walk I can't never get ahead in
[43:34] life there's another one here that
[43:40] says when you bringing
[43:50] conferences paragraph
[43:55] 148 sometimes we think it's the
[44:01] devil but it's not the devil all the
[44:06] time when he come back out bringing the
[44:09] children of
[44:13] Israel out to the promised
[44:17] land right right in the path of
[44:24] Duty lay theed
[44:31] see it's
[44:33] strange it's
[44:35] strange that
[44:37] God will lead his
[44:43] children right into
[44:46] traps sometimes in
[44:50] wheelchairs sometimes in heart
[44:54] attacks
[44:56] sometimes he leads his children
[45:03] why to see how they're going to
[45:07] react to see a
[45:11] reaction and that's how that's what what
[45:15] happens we try to
[45:17] run we see an
[45:20] obstacle we want to run the opposite
[45:24] way
[45:29] but
[45:30] tonight we have the devil on the
[45:34] Run we have the
[45:36] God in the midst of the battle right
[45:39] now you come to church
[45:42] sick
[45:44] tired
[45:46] problems and but we made
[45:48] it you said well I don't know what's my
[45:51] position I don't know
[45:54] what be here and in
[45:57] church praising the
[46:00] Lord hearing the
[46:02] message that's your
[46:04] position living a Christian
[46:07] Life you know what gets the devil
[46:13] mad when you ask God for
[46:17] something he doesn't give it to you but
[46:20] yet you can still praise the
[46:23] Lord and that's what gets the devil man
[46:28] you know sometimes we we ask the lord
[46:30] well Lord I've done everything
[46:37] right I met the requ
[46:41] requirements why why how come you
[46:44] haven't blessed
[46:46] me why I I've done everything I lived a
[46:49] Christian
[46:52] Life the trial of your faith
[46:56] is more precious than silver and
[47:00] gold and we see
[47:03] that maybe we ask God for I don't know a
[47:07] a car or a house or whatever it
[47:11] is you asked God for for something in
[47:14] your
[47:15] life God will give it to
[47:18] you Abraham waited 25
[47:23] years God will give it to you
[47:26] be still and know that I am
[47:30] God sometimes we don't
[47:33] realize I got patience wear
[47:37] out we get
[47:41] moody we get
[47:47] exhausted we react
[47:51] different and I could be the first one
[47:53] to raise my
[47:54] hand
[47:56] but we are still the Royal seed of
[48:01] ab there's nothing that could change the
[48:04] bride of
[48:07] Christ only God could do that to
[48:11] us and if you've been
[48:15] blessed and you feel like you're broken
[48:17] into
[48:21] pieces it's because those little
[48:24] pieces it's because you're helping
[48:26] somebody
[48:27] else even though you're going through a
[48:32] trial that's a
[48:34] paradox you might not know
[48:38] this you might be helping somebody else
[48:40] and you don't even
[48:44] know a paradox is brother BR said is
[48:47] something that's true incredible but
[48:48] it's
[48:53] true but you're helping somebody else
[48:57] maybe you you don't have your son here
[48:58] in
[49:00] church your
[49:02] children your father your mother your
[49:05] husband your
[49:07] wife but it it says in the
[49:09] Bible you and your off offsprings will
[49:12] be
[49:15] there don't don't never forget
[49:19] that so we go through
[49:23] problems that's all right it's just God
[49:26] is breaking you two
[49:28] pieces and he's multiplying
[49:30] you and what happened that's the case
[49:33] with a the prodical
[49:36] son his father gave him the
[49:39] inheritance
[49:41] money he went to the
[49:43] world he spent it all we all know the
[49:47] story
[49:48] right I've said this
[49:51] before but if you look at the
[49:54] story
[49:56] the father you might say it was his
[50:01] fault in a way it was his
[50:06] fault he was praying to
[50:08] God he said
[50:10] God I want my son to come back
[50:15] home so I gave him the
[50:18] money I want him to spend all the money
[50:21] right
[50:22] away so what he did
[50:27] he let the economy of Las crues go
[50:33] down just to save one
[50:37] soul and he will do that to your
[50:41] family God God will take care of them
[50:43] for
[50:45] you but I just want to thank you tonight
[50:47] just a little little short talk I
[50:52] had I just want to share that with you
[50:58] remember more
[51:04] loyal more
[51:09] testing God bless
[51:11] [Applause]
[51:24] you
[51:26] God bless you this evening God bless
[51:28] brother
[51:37] Daniel we are as a people of God tonight
[51:39] we're thankful when they speak to us
[51:41] about
[51:44] trials I was just being rejoicing just
[51:47] to see how our brother was talking when
[51:49] we were singing back there on the
[51:53] television brother Daniel was was so
[51:55] nervous back
[51:58] there and he said if he might just
[52:00] preach 15
[52:03] minutes he did such a good
[52:07] job I like it when they speak about
[52:12] trials and when one is
[52:16] broken as our brother Daniel was
[52:20] speaking I like it when they speak on
[52:22] those
[52:23] subjects because when you are
[52:28] broken you cannot get that fragrance out
[52:30] of the
[52:31] Rose unless you crush that
[52:35] Rose if it's not
[52:38] broken in this age that we
[52:42] live it it's so easy to be become
[52:48] broken if you accept to follow the
[52:53] lord if you don't want want to follow
[52:55] the
[52:57] lord God bless the brothers that are
[52:59] visiting us
[53:01] tonight if you decide to follow the
[53:04] Lord in this day that we
[53:08] live it's you have that propensity that
[53:11] you're going to be
[53:13] broken you're going to be broken you're
[53:15] going to be
[53:18] crushed the way the world is in this
[53:22] day if you just aren't careful just for
[53:25] a little
[53:27] bit and You Begin to Fall in Love with
[53:29] the things of this
[53:32] world that's the problem we have in this
[53:36] day we love so much the things of this
[53:40] day we love our houses so
[53:44] much we love our
[53:46] cars our our
[53:49] jobs the school and
[53:52] education all that is necessary
[53:57] and we're going to make emphasis that
[53:59] all that is
[54:01] needed but don't get a hold of your
[54:06] job that your life depends on
[54:11] it that your Eternal destination would
[54:13] depend on
[54:15] that the same thing with your
[54:17] house don't get a hold of your house in
[54:20] such a
[54:22] way as if your eternal life depended on
[54:25] on
[54:26] it sooner or
[54:29] later God's going to make you be
[54:32] accountable for
[54:35] it because if you're such got a hold on
[54:37] the things of this life that
[54:41] means you're not hold of God over
[54:46] here the the problem we have in this
[54:50] age let's read our
[54:53] scripture Revelation chapter
[54:57] three we're going to see that the
[54:59] condition of this
[55:02] age it's such a sad
[55:07] condition chapter 3 verse
[55:14] 13 let's go all the way to 17 to save a
[55:17] little time 3
[55:20] 17 it begins to hear to speak about the
[55:23] age of this church
[55:28] because thou sayest I am rich and
[55:29] increased with
[55:31] goods and I have need of
[55:36] nothing and knowest not that thou are
[55:39] wretched miserable and poor and blind
[55:44] and
[55:49] naked it's not just one thing here it's
[55:52] like five things
[55:54] here
[55:56] you know that's not the worst of
[55:58] it that's not the worst of this
[56:03] age because we have become so rich in
[56:05] this
[56:08] age and we have gotten such a hold on
[56:10] things in this
[56:14] world that we forget that this world is
[56:16] not our kingdom is not of this
[56:21] world we we get a hold of the things
[56:23] that are around us
[56:29] it's like if we nail down a piece of
[56:31] metal and nobody's going to move us from
[56:35] there but our kingdom is not of this
[56:37] Earth of this
[56:39] world my kingdom is not of
[56:43] here I I remember every day when I go to
[56:46] cut hair or when I go to cut my
[56:49] hair I know many of you do the
[56:52] same every time I go up to the the
[56:56] mirror I see less
[57:00] hair every morning where I go and take a
[57:05] pill I remember that I'm not of
[57:11] here then why do I want to be such a
[57:13] whole things that have me bound to this
[57:16] earth when I'm not I'm not from
[57:23] here
[57:25] I don't want to be a person that becomes
[57:27] rich and then I don't want to hear what
[57:28] God has to
[57:30] say but this is that the age of
[57:34] it the people of this
[57:39] age I'm speaking there's Christian
[57:43] people there's a Christian
[57:49] people there are programs in their
[57:51] churches and systems and programs in
[57:53] their
[57:53] churches
[57:55] they have them so
[57:57] busy they have them so
[58:00] enriched that they don't
[58:04] realize that they are
[58:09] naked and that's the worst part about it
[58:11] they don't know
[58:13] it that's the age that we live
[58:18] in this is why I would like to turn the
[58:20] corner just a little
[58:23] bit
[58:26] we have a mixed audience here and
[58:27] because of the love we have for
[58:31] Souls you know the God of this Our God
[58:33] sent us a prophet in this
[58:37] day in our day he sent Elijah the
[58:41] prophet and that was a promise
[58:45] Brothers God promised that in our
[58:48] day he was going to dress
[58:52] us he he brought the dress
[58:56] and
[58:59] we that we should be dressed with the
[59:03] word that's the
[59:07] promise we don't want to be found
[59:10] naked we don't want to be found
[59:14] blind then why don't we get
[59:20] dressed we don't want to be done like
[59:22] that that because we haven't gotten
[59:23] dressed amen
[59:28] Elijah came and he brought all the
[59:31] truth do not the scriptures
[59:35] say the disciples began to ask
[59:41] Jesus why did the scripes says that that
[59:43] Elijah must first
[59:46] come and Jesus said yes it's NE
[59:49] necessary that he
[59:51] come he's going to guide us to all the
[59:53] truth
[59:55] in our day
[59:58] Brothers what we the people
[1:00:02] need is to to become so
[1:00:06] saturated but the the message of
[1:00:10] Elijah it's the only thing it's going to
[1:00:12] take the scales off of our
[1:00:15] eyes and we won't be just going around
[1:00:17] trying to feel our way
[1:00:19] around where I
[1:00:23] work I speak PE with a people
[1:00:27] and and the people they struggle so
[1:00:31] much and then I think how blessed I
[1:00:34] am where God has placed
[1:00:37] me what God has given
[1:00:41] me then I begin to remember
[1:00:48] Israel God gave Wells to Israel that
[1:00:50] they didn't even dig
[1:00:53] them
[1:00:55] he gave them food that they thought that
[1:00:56] they weren't going to even be able to
[1:01:00] eat but before the foundation of the
[1:01:03] world he remembered me he thought of
[1:01:07] me and he put us in this
[1:01:11] day where I would be able to receive
[1:01:15] Elijah I was going to receive that
[1:01:19] food this
[1:01:23] nation
[1:01:25] this is the Most Blessed nation that God
[1:01:27] has given us where God has placed
[1:01:35] us not only in what we
[1:01:38] see but what God has raised up
[1:01:42] here God raised up Elijah the
[1:01:47] prophet I was able to receive this
[1:01:52] message from the time that I was a
[1:01:56] child I began to hear this
[1:02:00] message I have been so privileged like
[1:02:03] that all these young
[1:02:05] people you're are so
[1:02:10] privileged you don't know what it's like
[1:02:12] to be out there roaming around in the
[1:02:15] dark without a pilot to guide
[1:02:21] you let me tell you it's so sad to see
[1:02:24] the people like
[1:02:26] that but the world
[1:02:33] today they're having such an Amnesia
[1:02:36] attack of am they have an attack of
[1:02:40] Amnesia because they have lost their
[1:02:45] identity they're not tied down to
[1:02:50] anything the same thing that happened to
[1:02:53] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:02:55] he had everything at at his
[1:02:59] disposal but he had gotten so
[1:03:04] rich he forgot where all these blessings
[1:03:06] had come
[1:03:11] from this nation has forgot where all
[1:03:13] these blessings have come
[1:03:17] from Nebuchadnezzar he he got
[1:03:21] amnesia he had time to repent
[1:03:25] but he didn't
[1:03:28] repent then what
[1:03:33] happened then his heart was changed
[1:03:37] brother his heart became like the heart
[1:03:40] of an
[1:03:43] animal he forgot that he had to sit at
[1:03:45] the table to
[1:03:48] eat one day he was out in in the
[1:03:53] field he was was out there eating with
[1:03:55] the
[1:03:56] animals he couldn't think the
[1:04:00] same he forgot who he
[1:04:05] was he had forgotten where His blessings
[1:04:08] were coming
[1:04:11] from it's so sad to see somebody that
[1:04:13] has Amnesia like
[1:04:16] that he was like that for a long
[1:04:22] time after at that God brought back his
[1:04:25] reasoning his thinking back to
[1:04:29] him therefore we're going to receive
[1:04:31] from God
[1:04:35] Brothers to be under his wings to be
[1:04:37] under his
[1:04:40] care we can't go up from under what God
[1:04:43] has given
[1:04:46] us for the very moment that you get away
[1:04:48] from what God has given
[1:04:50] you then you begin to
[1:04:53] forget
[1:04:56] you begin to forget where the blessings
[1:04:57] are coming
[1:05:01] from and that has happened to all of
[1:05:04] us not just
[1:05:07] Nebuchadnezzar that has happened to all
[1:05:09] of
[1:05:10] us beginning with
[1:05:14] me for for a time I
[1:05:17] forgot but let me tell
[1:05:21] you real quick the Lord reminded me
[1:05:25] when you are of the
[1:05:27] Lord if you want to find out if you're
[1:05:29] of God or
[1:05:31] not how many want to know if you're of
[1:05:33] the Lord or of
[1:05:34] God the Lord Jesus
[1:05:37] Christ he's going to bring to you to an
[1:05:41] accountability and if you're a little
[1:05:46] forgetful he'll bring it to your
[1:05:52] Rememberance a little by little he's
[1:05:53] going to begin to take things away from
[1:05:55] you until you
[1:06:01] remember and let me tell you that's
[1:06:03] happened to
[1:06:06] me that's the way God
[1:06:09] works because he wants to try
[1:06:13] us he he wants to find out through the
[1:06:16] basis of
[1:06:19] fire he puts us in a fiery
[1:06:21] [Applause]
[1:06:23] trial
[1:06:25] as the young man that he put in that
[1:06:26] burning
[1:06:32] furnace God wanted to see if they were
[1:06:34] going to still be faithful to
[1:06:38] him God wants to know that same thing
[1:06:40] about
[1:06:42] us God wants to see that about our
[1:06:46] brother he's going to give us a little
[1:06:47] bit of sickness a
[1:06:51] pain our money is going to run out
[1:06:56] because we became a little
[1:07:00] forgetful as
[1:07:03] humans that
[1:07:07] happens he brings us to be
[1:07:11] broken as brother Daniel was
[1:07:15] speaking he begins to break
[1:07:20] you when he begins to break
[1:07:22] us
[1:07:24] the way that he does
[1:07:29] it I'm not going to say that it's pretty
[1:07:32] the way he does
[1:07:33] it because as
[1:07:37] humans we don't like any kind of thing
[1:07:40] that breaks
[1:07:42] us but let me tell you
[1:07:47] brother for that flower for that
[1:07:49] fragrance to
[1:07:50] come it has to be crushed smashed
[1:07:56] it has to be crushed and and it's like
[1:08:00] that that's what cut let's loose that
[1:08:04] fragrance and he does it like
[1:08:07] that he does it like that and he's going
[1:08:09] to continue to do it like
[1:08:12] that there are nations that God has
[1:08:14] risen up and he has blessed
[1:08:18] them and a little bit
[1:08:22] afterwards we have written the
[1:08:24] read the histories in the
[1:08:26] Bible how God blesses a
[1:08:31] nation and a little while afterwards
[1:08:33] that they
[1:08:35] forget they begin to do the things of
[1:08:37] the
[1:08:39] world and when they at least they think
[1:08:41] about
[1:08:45] it they don't know if they're from over
[1:08:47] here or over
[1:08:50] here that's what happened with the
[1:08:52] people of Israel
[1:08:55] they they left
[1:08:58] Egypt they were so emotional so
[1:09:01] happy because they were going to lead
[1:09:06] Egypt they had been in slavery so for so
[1:09:08] many
[1:09:10] years that when they left
[1:09:13] Egypt oh they were so
[1:09:16] happy they were so they were so
[1:09:21] emotional but after a little while
[1:09:25] they began to
[1:09:29] forget you know why they began to
[1:09:33] forget because God began to give them
[1:09:35] and give them
[1:09:39] more but when god holds back his
[1:09:43] hand then you raise up your
[1:09:47] head you think where did the blessing
[1:09:52] go and then God says why are you so
[1:09:59] forgetful that's when God brings an
[1:10:01] adjustment in
[1:10:02] us the the people of
[1:10:07] Israel the people of Israel were brought
[1:10:09] and God adjusted
[1:10:12] them they had to make a
[1:10:16] decision a decision decision like you
[1:10:18] and I have to
[1:10:20] make if we want to continue
[1:10:22] forward
[1:10:24] we're going to be a separated
[1:10:28] people we're not going to be separated
[1:10:30] to to be
[1:10:32] isolated but a people separated to
[1:10:36] him we we we don't want to be separated
[1:10:38] to be
[1:10:40] strange but to be separated to
[1:10:44] him what is good to be separated or or
[1:10:49] isolated we have to be separated unto
[1:10:52] him
[1:10:54] you want to be with your
[1:10:57] brother you're not going to see Jesus
[1:11:00] any better than seeing your
[1:11:03] brother I can't stand that brother I
[1:11:05] just can't stomach
[1:11:10] him then we need a trip to the
[1:11:14] altar we have to come to the altar we
[1:11:16] have to be reconciled with our
[1:11:19] brother remember that
[1:11:22] you you are the hands that God has
[1:11:28] today we are the mouth that God has
[1:11:32] today and there's not going to be a
[1:11:37] day where you're going to be a greater
[1:11:39] person than you are
[1:11:41] today you're great
[1:11:47] today but many of us have to begin to
[1:11:50] manifest
[1:11:52] that we have to put more honey in the
[1:11:56] Box to retain that
[1:11:59] water but if you don't have that that
[1:12:01] box well Anointed with the
[1:12:03] honey the water is going to run
[1:12:06] out the word is not going to stay
[1:12:10] there when you begin to put that honey
[1:12:12] in
[1:12:14] there and you come close to your
[1:12:17] brother brother brother let's go over
[1:12:19] here let's do this you begin to love
[1:12:22] your brother
[1:12:24] and the sisters begin to love the
[1:12:27] sisters the sisters to the
[1:12:31] sisters there you begin to see there's
[1:12:33] more
[1:12:35] hone if not the water is going to leak
[1:12:38] out but the honey can hold back the
[1:12:43] water that that's the problem with the
[1:12:45] age of
[1:12:47] L they have been so enriched in so many
[1:12:52] things they have so many programs and
[1:12:54] trips here and there and the
[1:12:58] honey where did the honey
[1:13:01] stay if there's no
[1:13:03] honey the water is not going to be
[1:13:07] retained don't worry about going
[1:13:12] everywhere your kingdom is going to be
[1:13:18] here my kingom is going to be here if I
[1:13:21] put more
[1:13:22] honey
[1:13:23] to be able to retain and keep that
[1:13:27] water God bless you this
[1:13:33] evening I pray that these words have
[1:13:35] been a help to
[1:13:37] you let's stand to our
[1:13:39] [Applause]
