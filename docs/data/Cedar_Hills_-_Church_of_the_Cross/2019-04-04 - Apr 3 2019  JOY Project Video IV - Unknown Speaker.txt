together now and that's a blessing and all the brothers and sisters in the church there they're just a blessing to us have known a lot of now I don't don't really know but I always pray for each one and I know they pray for us and that's one thing that really keeps us going the key of life is positive love and faith to move mountains so they're paid to do that they're no charity that myself women love for people and for Christ presentation garden or leaving the mean ancestors Taketa to last too long to hold on to I feel very well me I continue on there and so grateful for what everybody is doing for the African people there is a wedding cause I know brother Branham and I think it was 57 where he was going to go to Africa and I just praise the Lord that it's still in the hearts of the ministers today and we just love the Lord with all our heart and all the people in the church appreciate already been asked a call just keep us in your prayers [Music] we are here my sister Paula today to ask her some questions about her testimony okay so my first question is how did you come to know the Lord Jesus actually I came to know the Lord through viola and brother Tommy I was baptized and Apostolic Church first and then when we came across the message of the hour Tommy later he baptized me in brother Nick's church and from then I started my walk with Jesus and what year were you baptized to do [Music] 1973 or for actually I was going to a simply of God Church in Oklahoma and we had a brother that came to give it a revival certain services and during his ministry as he was ministering to us he said something about is that if brother Brent said he saw an angel I believe he saw an angel and I was like stunned I've never heard of angels coming to people down here on earth and so I started thinking about who brother Branham was and at the time tommy was just coming in into the message and anyway that's that's not what I came across the message okay so you said he came to know the Lord Jesus through our founding pastor so when did you first meet our family pastor [Applause] I meant oh yes when I graduated from high school by all sentient ticket to go to California and when I got to California Tommy and viola met me there so that was first time I met Tommy and when did you start attending Cedar Hills well [Music] we moved out here in 1984 but we had been going to church with Sami for a long time that as far as Cedar Hills Tabernacle that was would be 1984 of them we had already been coming back and forth from Oklahoma and having services with him what is it that keeps you going in life the what keeps me going is the message of the hour and the fellowship that I have with my brothers and sisters and just a promise that one day I'm going to see my sister my dad they're all but brother branham and that keeps me going so much but the word and knowing that one day we will be out of here how do you maintain your relationship with the Lord Jesus praying every day listening to the message every day reading our Bible and just having fellowship with my brothers and sisters what is the source of your success well baked wheat to my spouse and to the word that I have heard trying to do because as honest and faithful is that can be and what is the he delighted for you the key to life is first God then my my family pastor has a lot to do with who I am today if it wasn't for him I don't know who I'd be because he cared so much about us that when he lived when we lived in Oklahoma he would go they would go at least once a month to minister to us and I will never ever forget that is that I do like to this I love my children my grandchildren and I just thank my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren yes I have three great three boys and two girls right now at first I had my five granddaughters that started the ball rolling I guess and the one talking right now is one of the best yes what is your favorite message of brother ground on food my favorite vestige of brother branham is the Hebrews the series that he preached only people because it covers just that everything that he's ever preaching and I just love to hear it what is your favorite song operate that art and they not have another song that is very precious to me because I oh I guess I don't know what you'd call it but I was troubled for many years and and I just couldn't get the picture of the over what I was going through and one day or one night when I was sleeping I had a dream and I was thinking that song and the name of Jesus bigness will have to flee and through that song it it brought me my deliverance and ever since then I haven't had any problems with that spirit that would come against me and I thank God for it what is your favorite color my favorite color is yellow and green what's your favorite place to on vacation well actually you've not so much my favorite but where we go mostly if this to Oklahoma because that's where my husband's family's from and I enjoy seeing my old friends that that I was friends with when my girls were little [Music] do what is your advice on being a Christian my advice my advice of being a Christian well you just have to study the word and try to every so you know liquor to the best that you can and just you know putting God first let you know reading the word hear the message just all that is the key to life would you have any it by some being a life yes I this advice that would give is to me try not to be combative even in situations when you think you have to learn it too in too deep keep your your opinions to yourself sometimes and and just you know we don't always have to have the last word it's not that important life goes on and just wait on your husband and do the things that you should do and [Music] okay and advice on being a parent advice of being a parent is to raise your kids according to the message and first teaching to pray and in this video were the word and and live for God that's the best I can you know I would advise for as far as being a parent and give them all the love that you can what was your favorite thing to do when you were a youth but not look at you yeah but we're in the message yet but probably ride horses ride horses was one of my favorite things thanks to do and go to school I love school I think that about sums up all our questions so thank you for your time and being the Christian example you are I appreciate you very much and I love you I love you too [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] and then and when the military I was in Germany served six years in the service and then I met me and then I met the Lord what else you know that was born and raised in the Winston and went to school there Winston and so we would to cheer see and my older sisters Paula and Cecilia and viola they're winding up in California and that's how I only met Tommy and of course he became my brother than one that's how I got to know him at the end part of 1972 and we didn't get married until 1976 and eventually talking to Mike about because I knew about the message but to go back in 1969 is when I felt the world calling me and I went to the Apostolic Church with violin Tommy and it was there that I really got to pull from Lord and historic church in 1969 and then I I didn't stick to it I bought it all the way so actually I did I need coming to this message did and that was the year we started I had [Music] [Music] over there and okay I was baptized in 1969 the other story church but it was in I want to say that about 1982 or 83 but there was a few of us there Cedar Hills that we've got be baptized in the Gila River in February it was freezing pretty much you can probably read affected see I came in when I met Tommy assessment now when I really wanted to serve or I wanted to come into the message I got into the medicine about 77 and I was the message wasn't in me I was in the message and then in seventy seventy seven when we wouldn't do Phoenix just when Tommy baptized because I asked him to baptize me before we went to feast he said no I'm not going to baptize you and why he told me that I don't know and I said you're not gonna baptize me yes as well then I'm gonna go with each other with each of you because we had a house in El Paso and bought we couldn't sell it and when I told him that I was gonna finish so that we went home that week and the next morning we packed everything up and I was hungover because we were on the way to Phoenix don't make us as well so we get the money for the house we keep going I will give me six pack of beer is like that I have something so you got in the truck we got the Emmy I got the Deming I bought them all of them something to eat and everything else when that six pack of cokes we all drink cokes and everything else and it's more than I could have possibly in it I need my beer I'm gonna suspect for me I said it by their guidance but that the before that was the last day I ever drank a beer and the Lord just took it from before Monday together without me realizing what he does welcome back to Phoenix I took time you okay now I'm here not only get baptized he said well let me ask brother Bernie so brother Bernie said well what are you waiting for disco so brother Bernie and brother Tommy got into the pool from baptized so I got double portion I got it from Bernie and Kentucky they hadn't been for Tommy and brother Bernie I probably wouldn't be this message because I think it was about a year after that that the message was in me but till that time the message was not any too happy we got a Baptist and that's how I came to know Tommy and the message was because of himself and what is I'll start with you granny what is what is the key what is your key of life what is your source of success what keeps you going when we were going to see her heels Church I know it was God through Tommy that has kept us all these years because of how one great pastor he was to us and and through the years the word the message brother branham when I first came in a message that I used to dream brother better a lot and drove that that's what has kept me in this message and and I know without a shadow of doubt that I forgot past me and and I'm so thankful for the history for where he has placed us and that there's nothing that will take that away from us just a message without the message you have nothing that is the source of my life I did so because all the time that I was with Tommy we was a missionary crystal water hot to Mexico City to all the places that Tommy and I used to go it was all of the entire that went and then finally I think the last work trips we made is when we took my Ola and me colorless and Jody and my buddies and now and that was what we used to go to missionary trips but of course that's not the way he gave back there before anybody even usual tommy was very very was a center of the attraction then and we went it there and in the sense of speaking that's what what investment time we broke the ice of who he was in Mexico he went in there and then they accepted him because of mother birdie backed him up and they got to know who Tommy was and that's what the court was looking for us they were all the Mexico and they invited our church but I remember that so the state because we used to go to Mexico when we get there we have to find our way to get a rental car nobody was there to pick us up take us to the church we have to find the church I used to be the driver I drove what a hata to the churches and everything else and let me tell you if you can drive a lot of how they invited many more and I remember that very distinctly what we put really captured my mind about you know how that was the last time we went by all that Tommy unique I myself we stopped at this place is Tommy wannabe it was a little right outside of what other it wasn't arrested it was a truck stop the way she was oh she everything had to be perfect we sat there there was flies all over the place would be hitting the flight to set there Nathan they surprised me the chief would be one that oh no I'm not going to eat there she's with us but that was something that I'll never forget so it was the last trip that we made and because of that because what Tommy has shown me the light that mended it's the Holy Ghost was in that man and Tommy always preached don't follow me follow what's here and that so they never put a man before God I don't care for the babies God heal the man and you see the man and if you can see God in that man probably man if you don't see God in him but find somebody else and that's when I found up and Tommy made me promise him that I would not leave this church no matter what he said if something happens to me I don't want you and he made me promise in that and that's nothing to take me from the future no matter how what how everything is Tommy showed me what God can really do we have seen so many miracles so much just walking with time and that is Dennis have got me a virgin have you had maintained your relationship with the Lord and her brothers and sisters in Christ and your family because of the love of Christ that's that when we can see Christ in our brothers and sisters and and that's what keeps us not knowing that what we have is is something real and do you have I'm sorry grandma do you have any advice as a Christian is alive with grandparents anything for use I was trying to be a good example to to our youth our children and and if they if they can see if you can be a great example to them then they in turn they'll want don't want to be a Christian so it's very important to to be a good example wherever you go whatever it is you can the only advice I have for young people is don't look at anybody as our own look at Christ see the life they need not don't worry about how good-looking they are how they act see how see how how much love they project before you even want to be like anybody but what you really want to be like to see Christ if you develop somebody you love everybody you show them love no matter what I'm sure you'll get angry you'll get mad but always remember you're going to live with them for the rest of your life so you need to love them they show up above no matter what they do and especially for you see you won this bout love the shoulder that's what they need not what they're up in this day when they're down low nobody wants nothing to do the goal of they show over those you want to thank you appreciate just money but not just me but of course all of your brothers and sisters I have one more question so we'll call this one of the bonus question you guys don't have to answer because I know that there might be a few people offended by this question about what you might say but who's your favorite grandchild [Laughter] [Music] so first question how long have you been serving the look so you started serving in the Lord about 130 years but you were not in the message where were you before there you well it started to the message [Music] and where you are the timing hearing for this or were you there and somewhere else all right second question how were you introduced to the message of the hour and I surely would like to do this in that story [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that they would kind of watch over me but they didn't live close but the Lord spoke to me and told me get out of that long study group and so I got out of it and right after that my uncle comes who is a brother of my dad and he's in the message and he said come on I want to take you somewhere I want to show you a church and so he took me and my my aunt Virginia she goes to the church there and where we're at and from there on and when we walked inside the church where brother Caleb preaches we started weeping I mean we could feel the hot the Spirit of God immediately immediately and we started crying and and it was like we had it just felt like a bubble bath and so we got out and from there on we started going to church they're like my prayer was answered after going out into the mountains and and I was told get out of there at church of Cedar Hills which was not that at that time it was so your that was in it was just me my dad kind of he had received the Lord but he did not was not born again until later and and he was objecting at first and my mother came in I invited her to go to church and I invited dad too and when they came Caleb's sister still remembers if it were yesterday they had a picnic at young park I think it was and my parents went and that's where they got to talking to my started coming and then she got and then my dad started coming but he was resisting because he was deep into the Catholic Church where they were Indians you know that they believe in the Walla looping and tire and they start dancing and altering dances to her and stuff like that well my dad was involved in that he started coming to church - sure well that's good that's wonderful it's a nice story so the Lord answer your prayer out there my mother with the right sort all right next question sister what's your favorite go [Music] [Music] [Music] skip singing sister [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's your favorite [Music] [Music] [Music] he's my strength is my rock brother I tell him that I need every half hour every minute every second and in between and that's true I'm a kind of a person that I need I need [Music] hi Ruby yes I'm going to speak today about my journey to where I am today I was born into the Apostolic Faith Movement right before I was born though my mom became a Christian and before that she was a strong Catholic was married into the Catholic Church her sisters and her had been searching for the truth and were visiting other churches and they came to Las Cruces intended an apostolic meeting and there they had a true Holy Ghost experience so my mom my mother and all her siblings were baptized in Jesus name and received the Holy Ghost one after another but something kept moving them and they went on to they joined the UPC but soon left and became independent Pentecostal they used to have Church and in houses but that time my mother already had six children one of the places we've Health Services was in my uncle Robert barreras home he told my mother and her sisters if they wanted a church that he would build them one so he did and he had an insight and he built a church and it was the shape of a pyramid and we didn't even know the message at the time and we went to a revival meeting in Duncan Arizona and this brother brother Roy Mims was preaching and we heard him with us when we first heard the message of the hour and it was around 1960 1969 and so we heard him in my my uncles my mother anyone hurt and they're like this is the truth is this what we've been wanted to hear all our lives so he was just an Imagi list but there was such a spiritual connection there they asked him if he could please be our pastor and he's like no one evangelist told him to come can I be your past so no they just kept but they just kept on to him not to him to be our pastor so he finally said okay I'm gonna go and I'm gonna I'm gonna pray about I'm gonna fast and then we'll see what the Lord tells so it was like a two-week revival in the last day sure enough he said you went you went to us and told us okay I paid one more time and I guess I'll be your pastor and we were all so happy and you just we could not believe it and so he went to the to Lordsburg and that's when we first heard the message and that's when we got baptized we see the Holy Ghost we even we had a Christian school we made our own dresses and I was a choir leader it was just it was like a whirlwind it just everything happened just so fast the church was finished as a matter of fact later on it was named pyramid tabernacle from Buenavista Pentecostal church it was changed to pyramid tabernac and so then brother Jackson from Indiana over there Brown's friend he knew brother Mims and Jerry a Malone your brother man so whether Jackson came to our church and he had a he had a burden and brother Jerry a Malone also for the people in Mexico though they they just became very good friends and we started going to Indiana to visit and my mom would even go with other Jackson whoever could go to Mexico he would go to missionary over there and that's how we came became grounded in the message what year were you're baptized and you received the Holy Ghost that was the same time that was around 1968 1969 I don't know let's like around me to 12 and I was the same you accepted the message of fear yes okay all at the same time okay so what is it that keeps you going well when we became message believers it seemed like things hit us hard we went through so many trials I was kind of discouraging the word Christian school by their means have gone on to evangelize and I I just discouraging then so what happened I had a bad accident and I ended up in a coma and I the doctors told my mother that my blood pressure was dropping and it was up to me I had the will to live so my mom stayed beside me the whole time I was there like about a week or more and didn't a semi-coma and then I remember these brothers came to pray for me brother knee a customer then Mike Bennett and I remember them very important and something just stirred inside of me and then finally I just I just got up and sat up and I was fine and so you know I thank God for that and you know it just seemed like just Satan was somehow trying to maybe destroy what we added to destroy our faith but no God would always came on the scene and it made us stronger and made my mom stronger for there was for children so I just learned that you know all these things you just you just throws your faith and you just call me how do you maintain your relationship with the Lord and your brothers and sisters well I like every morning okay wake up and Horsham I listen to my music of Christian music and I just worship and my every passages of the Bible like I just stay focused and having in my mind all day he's like just there everywhere I think of him all day long of course my mother is well and my brother but it's all they're all like together so I think of them all together and I just keep my mind on him and even like town I pray constantly I couldn't pray for a good parking space and I always get it if whenever I seen you know and I God gives me songs and sometimes I I think wow this is probably for someone in and they sing and I just pray that it inspires someone or helps them in some way what is the key to life for you and the source of your success key of life is knowing that all good things come to them then you love the Lord and he's there everything that I know it's always been about him and just knowing that there's a promise and you have to keep your faith and believe really a kid life is believing hmm but maybe that you are his and he called you according to his purpose and and yours chosen one what what else can you ask for just what is your song favorite messenger for the brand oh my goodness tell em get one eat that and soon and then the English ones are amazing grace at the cross and sheltered in the arms of God and messes your brother Brennan a beautiful watchman what are the night and looking at the end having advice on being a Christian like that verse in Romans I believe what can separate us from the love of God and nothing should separate you from the love of God no matter what amount of trials you get distracted but always remember that God loves you and you are his to stay faithful and I believe okay and the lesson is when you met brother Tommy and started attending Cedar Hills while I've been here increases a long time and one time I was at Walmart and penny was there and she saw me and she's like whatever you want why aren't you going to church with us I'm like I don't even know you had a church it's just well no we're renting them so that was that was almost around the time I think when they were building the church and then they built the church and but then when they finished the church among cooking my cousin Tony he I went to visit he's like Mary we already have a church built so why aren't you there I'm like really oh okay so I went to church oh my goodness and just I was so hungry for the word and and Tony playing those beautiful songs and it was like took me back and and it's all here I am mm-hmm yeah that's all the questions so thank you for your time I think you really enjoyed that how did you come to know the Lord nothing was going to church with brother tell me but I didn't want nothing to do with the message or church so he would go by himself at first then he took Janette and Danny one day he invited me to go to it on a trip to Oklahoma with weather Tommy and sister viola they went to testify to brother Joey and sister guys I had no idea what they were talking about I have never read or even open my Bible in my life anyway they were convinced so they were just they moved to slower study a few weeks later they invited me to a service at sort a pinnacle and the preaching touched my heart and I really liked it so I started my walk with the Lord at that time [Music] when were you baptized I was baptized about 1982 or 1983 summer Roman when did you make the founding pastor and start attending Cedar Hill stretch of the cross I met the founding pastor brother Tommy as sister Cecilia's and brother Russell's house they were our neighbors and my husband's friends and they invited us to have coffee one day and brother Tommy was there [Music] when did you start attending Cedar Hills Church of the Cross I started attending church after the first service - what keeps you going believe me it hasn't been an easy road but I know that the Lord touched my heart and
