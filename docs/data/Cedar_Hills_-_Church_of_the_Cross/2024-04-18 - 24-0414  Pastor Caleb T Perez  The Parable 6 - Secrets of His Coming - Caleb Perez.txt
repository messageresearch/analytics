[Aplausos] Dios bendiga phix también Dios los bendiga Dios los bendiga estamos muy contentos de estar aquí con ustedes hemos cantado suficiente hemos hecho muchas cosas pero estamos listos para entrar en la palabra ha estado usted en algún servicio donde le pregunta le pregunta El Predicador Qué clase de servicio quiere voy preguntar quieren leche quieren carne Si algo que no enti sol comoo her a un lado comend no todo el pastel mientras entramos en este tema yo real estoy predicando un tema llamado la parábola las CR yent que vien de Las Cruces van a entender la primera parte que ya hemos hablado sido un curso de refrescamiento y luego miraremos donde el Señor nos guía este será el número se de la parábola quiero secos de su venida hace años el Señor me hizo una pregunta puedes mantener un secreto mi respuesta inmediatamente señor hayret de Nada escuchao nuevo tenemos ha no voy a tirar mi tiempo eno pero hablemos de cosas que importan los secretos de su venida agua 1so thank Entonces llegándose los discípulos le dijeron por qué le hablas por parábolas y respondiéndole les dijo porque a vosotros es concedido leáo nuevamente tiene usted que poner su nombre ahí porque es es dado a juliá porque es dado a Julián conocer los misterios del reino de los cielos má a ellos no es concebido una vez más me es dado a mí saber y conocer el misterio los reinos reinos los cielos vamos a voltear a Marcos 4:33 si lo tienen Pueden decir amén y con muchas tales parábolas les hablaba la palabra conforme a lo que podían oír y sin parábola no les hablaba más discípulos en particular declaraba todo que el señor añ la bendición su palabra pueden tomar asiento la palabra parábola viene la palabra parole simplemente significa una historia terrenal con un significado celestial Esta es la base quiero asegurarme que tod reciban esto una vez más y quiero que lo rep una parábola es una historia terrenal con un significado celestial Ahora dígale a su vecino vecino una parábola es una historia terrenal con un significado Celestial Ya lo tenemos es la manera como la mayoría de gente aprende rápido pero también significa quitar una cosa tomar una cosa y luego tomar otra y compararlas en otras palabras usted no puede tomar una manzana y una naranja usted se puede dar cuenta inmediatamente que son diferentes pero es comparar algo como mi mano izquierda con mi mano derecha son Exactamente igual la una a la otra digo eso por una razón y lo van a entender mire alrededor y mire a su vecino mire otro lado y cada uno de ustedes tiene una historia Terrenal cuando miramos en el mund vamos una historia que contar si usted supiera lo que me pasó Oh Dj contar lo quece este todos tienen una historia para contar pero no toda historia correcto muchas historias pero no todas las historias tienen un significado celestial Cuál es el propósito de la palabra la Biblia dice que Jesús no hablaba sin parábola cada vez que Jesús hablaba decía el reino de los cielos es semejante a no decía el reino de Dios daba historia tras historia tras historia pero el significado celestial de esa historia era la que la gente no podía captar Escuchaban el la historia del Sembrador y el que vendió todo para comprar la tierra La perla de Gran precio yb vamos de acuerdo de la viña y las ovejas y todo esto había un significado celestial para cada una de esas historias y el propósito era traer las cosas espirituales traerlas juntas con las cosas naturales y eso es lo que creaba una parábola todo el propósito detrás era tomar la parte natural para entender que había una parte espiritual y es lo que escuchamos hace un rato lo sobrenatural usted tiene O sea ya sea natural o espiritual pero cuando usted lo junta se llama lo sobrenatural están conmigo todos Enton vamos a pasar la lista de Cuántas Biblias hay de las que el hermano bram habla algunos dicen tres otros cuatos ya estamos divididos y apenas estamos comenzando vale que llame a un amigo o algo Cuántos creen que hay cuatro Biblias Cuántos creen que hay tres Biblias ahora los que dijeron tres ya no quieren contestar inteligente mejor que no entendemos que hay cuatro bibl ayú a recordar Cuáles son estas la primera Biblia cómo se llama zodia cor escribió la Biblia en los cielos cor están conmigo todos luego la segunda Biblia dijo que era las pirámides ahora si usted toma la función de las pirámides y la manera como fueron construidas aquí está la parábola usted podía ponerla cara con el Zodiaco Y decía la misma cosa Ahora la tercera Biblia Qué es palabra escrita la santa Biblia ahora si toma la santa Biblia y la la pone junto a la pirámide y junto al zodiaco o la constelación va a decir la misma cosa Sí o sí Ahora llegamos a la cuarta Biblia y la cuarta Biblia es Me gusta esto la cuarta Biblia usted de apuntarse s mismo hermano br dice que de todas las Biblias hay mucha gente que la única Biblia que van a leer alguna vez es usted y yo es la única [Aplausos] Biblia él aún llama la madre El quinto evangelio así lo llama porque es la primera que empieza a tomar a sus hijos y enseñarles entonces cuando nuestras vidas se ponen cara a cara a lado lado con la santa Biblia con las Pires con el Zodiaco nuestra nuestra viv nuestra nuestra vida debería decir la misma cosa si no dice la misma cosa algo no está escrito bien están conmigo todos siento que está hablando bien va a ser bueno voy a hacerles una pregunta porque la manera como pensamos muchas veces somos influenciados en nuestras vidas por tantas cosas aún así deberíamos solamente ser influenciados por algunas cosas parece que usted envía a los hijos a la escuela y regresan y son una persona diferente a lo que fueron en la escuela De dónde sacaste eso de dónde salió ese espíritu y luego Usted tiene que tratar con eso tiene que volverlos a mandar escuela estoy entrando aquí algo Porque queremos poder decir esto mi una Biblia [Aplausos] caminante quiero mostrar algo aquí bien la comparación cuando yo me paro y veo esta Biblia y tantas cosas y me encuentro falto de muchas cosas queremos podernos ver en el espejo y la misma manera como Cristo nos Mira a nosotros él quiere poder ver su reflexión en usted Cuando miro a través de las escrituras tengo que compararme justo con las escrituras porque quiero ver si esto es eso her es esto eso o no un [Aplausos] dijo que el señor derramar su espíritu sobre toda carne finalmente días después alguien se paró y fue lleno dijo Esto es aquello queremos poder hacer la misma cosa porque hay tantas escrituras que la Biblia habla acerca del tiempo y quiero poder decir esto es eso están conmigo Eso es lo que estamos buscando hoy tenemos que poder tirar arrojar ideas que levantamos muchas [Aplausos] veces y tenemos que tirar muchas cosas de lo que pensamos el mundo no basa ningunas sus ideas en nada escuchan una buena idea y Oh yo pienso que es así pero después de un rato usted se da cuenta que esas ideas no llevan ninguna parte Pero déjeme hacerle una pregunta cuántos perfectos hay aquí decirles algo siempre recibo la misma respuesta es cierto estamos estamos en Polonia la misma algunos poquitos dijeron y otros dijeron que sí porque ya saben para dónde voy usted encuentra Exactamente lo mismo como como venado relado porque lo primero que pensamos es nuestra historia Terrenal ustedes saben que les est diciendo la verdad decimos estas cosas y la primera cosa que pensamos Oh la embarré el otro día pero cómo hacemos que los hijos de Dios Cómo logramos que ellos cambien esa mentalidad para eso es que estamos aquí en esta mañana quitemos tiremos las ideas que no importan y empecemos a comparar Esa es la verdadera parábola cuando puedo comparar mi vida con las escrituras cuando puedo tomar las escrituras Y compararlo con los cielos comparar Oh entonces ahora voy a llegar aú lugar emos algunas cosas a la borda si no entendemos es la parte Terrenal que es la que no nos agarra porque batallamos cada día la llama una una naturaleza que batalla y esa es la razón que no podemos alcanzar esa perfección en un mundo imperfecto estamos viviendo en un mundo imperfecto tratando de entender la perfección escuchamos la respuesta todo el tiempo no importa si Ed está iglesia mund respuesta que es dada por el mundo la gente del mundo vergüenza a nosotros también es la misma respuesta por nosotros mismos porque esta respuesta la usamos solamente para justificarnos a nosotros mismos Dios no necesita esto para justif él nos dio su palabra la más grande respuesta es qué nadie es perfecto usted hace un equívoco con que se cubre nadie es perfecto o todos hacen equívocos pero si usted está basando su perfección en eso usted le ha errado a la parábola Esta es toda la historia bibl la tiene de quién es esta historia est la historia de Dios revelándose sí mismo a Cristo manifestándose a sí mismo a través de su pueblo Entonces de quién es esta historia Esta es mi historia Por qué no no encajan nuestras historias estoy hablándole a alguien aquí esta historia encaja dijo el hermano bram encuéntrese usted en las escrituras si usted puede encontrar el carácter en escrituras entonces usted debe identificarse con solamente Mira el resultado Y usted va a saber cuál es su resultado estamos en la misma página ahora continuemos si estamos tratando de ser perfectos por nosotros mismos usted está correcto no somos perfectos pero si sabemos si conocemos que tenemos un sacrificio perfecto somos hechos perfectos por causa ese sacrificio entonces mientras sale la palabra cuando esa interpretación Perfecta de la palabra es dada a su conciencia ahora tenemos la perfecta interpretación de la palabra Dios envió su profeta y todos decimos Amén bien hay perfección es es una palabra perfecta alguien que me trata de decir que hay errores en el mensaje vaya y árele a otro árbol es perfecta pero el problema es no entienden la parábola observen nuestras vidas nuestras vidas naturales lo que hacemos lo que está aconteciendo aquí ya aconteció en los cielos todos estos grandes eventos tendría usted que estar viviendo bajo una roca para no ver qué está pasando Sí o sí él lo muestra los cielos primero y luego viene la tierra bien tienen que haber actores hay una escena que está puesta hebreos 111 la parábola pone la lo espiritual y natural junto no importando queé tantos altibajos tenga [Música] usted un verdadero creyente tiene celal es pués la fe la sustancia las cosas que se esperan la demostración de las cosas que no se ven verso 3 Por fe entendemos haber sido compuestos los siglos por la palabra de Dios siendo hecho lo que se ve de lo que no se veía eso es lo que se trata la creación trayendo lo que no se ve del mundo espiritual al mundo natural o al mundo visible Entonces él usa las parábolas él usa el mundo visible para ilustrar el realo espiritual que no vemos que no podemos ver entonces una vez más el viste lo lo que no se ve con lo natural o lo físico que sí vemos piense esto hice la pregunta el otro día en la iglesia cuando Dios le dijo a Abraham que sacrificara a su hijo Cuántos hijos tenía Abraham es importante esto Cuántos hijos tenía Abraham estamos divididos otra vez nooses del mensaje Cuántos dicen que tenía un hijo Cuántos dos hijos bien estamos aprendiendo Gálatas 424 porque escrito está que Abraham tuvo dos hijos bien yo digo eso por una razón hay una razón por la cual lo digo de esta manera es como ha sido en el mensaje por tengo una cita Oh el hermano dijo esto maravilloso qué más dijo él qué más dijo Es todo lo que él dijo somos tan buenos para aislar citas y párrafos cuando yo era niño pensaba como niño cuando usted llega a ser un hombre Usted aprende entrara abrah tenía dos hijos uno por la sierva y el otro de la libre que de la sierva nació según la carne pero pero el de la libre nació por la promesa las cuales estas cosas una alegoría ahora tenemos una parábola y una alegoría el espíritu santo quiere que usted vea algo en esta mañana si usted aísla esa escritur usted siempre va a decir que Abraham tenía dos hijos y si usted se aisla Así mismo todo lo próximo que va a ha ver es que son solo usted va a ver sus fallas nos Qué es la primera cosa que la gente hace cuando no están viviendo bien o se aan Oh ya no vo a ir a la iglesia se aislan a sí mismo porque una alegoría siempre Mira hacia atrás al pasado y el pasado está bien si usted aprendió de él están conmigo hemos hecho tantas cosas que quizá no deos haber hecho es es nuestro pasado pero aprendimos nosotros eso es una alegoría Ahora cuando hablamos de la parábola la parábola sabe cuando usted es como una persona una mujer o un hombre o cuando una historia Realmente está siendo escrita por eso por eso es que digo esto hay eventos en la vida de Abraham que era simplemente él como hombre pero no todo lo que hizo Abraham era parte de la parábola era una alegoría ahora observe mientras que la parábola se Abraham tenía dos hijos por dice la Biblia escuela dominical Génesis 222 toma ahora tu hijo Tu único hijo ahora estamos tomando escritura de acá de allá y estamos viendo un más grande verso 16 dice y dijo por mí mismo he Jurado dice Jehová que por cuanto has hecho esto y no me has redado tu hijo Tu único pensé que tenía dos alegóricamente hablando sí parab parabólicamente hablando no parábola hebreos 11:17 Por fe ofreció a Abraham Isa cuando fue probado y ofrecía lo unigénito que hab recibido las promesas aquí está la parábola no todos la entienden no todos lo enti porque en la parábola están los secretos secreto en en algún lugar el libro de Jeremías dice que lo escondió en un hay cosas que están escondidas en nosotros que no sabemos pero las está revelando él nos da revelación dice el hermano AB mientras Así cuando él ve que necesitamos de la revelación la Biblia Entonces nos dice en Juan capítulo 5 escudriñad las escrituras 539 porque a vosotros os parece que en ellas tenéis la vida eterna todos leen la escritura es correcto y las que la leen y todos piensan que tienen vida eterna y ellas son las que dan testimonio porque sin conocer los pasajes secretos que están aquí levante su Biblia hay pasajes secretos en la Biblia que el mundo no conoce nada Ahora cuando un ministro en el mensaje cuando salen con una nueva idea una nueva doctrina nueva idea entre comillas que dice que no hay nada nuevo bajo el sol cuando salen con algo que nadie ha escuchado qu es la primera cosa que dicen tiene que leer entre las líneas Oh Eso está fácil lea entre las líneas porque usted no lee entre las líneas no usted está inventando cosas ahora si usted me puede mostrar que usted diciendo y usted tiene escritura y tiene mensaje y puede compararlo entonces lo voy a escuchar No lo escuchar por Solamente porque suena bien muchas cosas suenan bien a este a este hombre cuando usted entra al mero mero la parábola es para compararla observen esto observe lo que están diciendo acá 37 porque no hará nada el señor Jehová sin que revele su secreto a su sivo los profetas es un secreto todos conmigo es un secreto Pero de ese secreto dentro de ese secreto hay secretos porque es la multiforma gracia multiforma quiere decir que tiene muchas otras partes cuando estamos hablando de esto cuando dijo hay puertas en puertas hay secretos en el secreto y no va a hacer nada sino que que lo revele a su siervo los profetas por eso es que me gustó cuando el her estamos hablando la palabra y dijo Oh es masivo esto masivo esto Dígale su vecino está masivo esto la palabra de Dios necesita estar en el corazón El problema es que la mayoría de la gente la tiene en la cabeza están tratando de de figurar todo Oh yo s lo yo le eso todavía está aquí baja corazón suelta el secreto suelta los secretos a usted y a mí eso es lo que es masivo piense de eso la gente de diferentes mundos lo perciben de diferentes maneras como si usted no tiene una vista viviría en otro mundo en el que estamos aquí estaría usted aquí pero sin vista estaría viviendo en otro mundo Igualmente como si usted no escuchara viviría en un mundo que no hay ruido ahora tome todo lo que estoy diciendo en lo espiritual Porque si somos cados espiritualmente vivimos en un mundo diferente y no podemos comprender o entender estas cosas esto revel otra vez la escritura dice esto Los Ángeles de Jehová encampar alrededor de ellos que le temen Cuántos de ustedes ven los ángeles de Jehová de Dios mi abuela una vez estaba sentada en la iglesia casi nadie vino a la iglesia y el ministro dice todas esas sillas vacías si usted solamente pudiera abrir sus ojos podría ver que hay un ángel sentado en cas silla y ella pensó ella pensó yo no veo Ángeles cuando de repente sus ojos espirituales abrieron vi Ángeles por todas sillas ella entró a otro realo otro mundo aparte de los cinco sentidos que no podían declararlo losos Si los ángeles de Jehová campan de nosotros Usted tiene que entrar en otro realo para poder verlos El problema es que somos muy carnales Sí o sí somos muy carnales no lo podemos figurar porque usted tiene otro sentido y ese sentido es llamado fe es el sex sentido y es dado por Dios para contactarlo a él digo no Quiero salirme de mi pensamiento quiero que vean algo aquí tiene que haber un cambio de mentalidad hay muchas cosas allá cuando vemos venimos a la iglesia el hermano está enseñando usted se sorprendería Cuántas personas no entienden esto todos entienden al evangelista correcto Oh estaba en fuego Oh zando sus talones corriendo por las Islas pasillos Oh todos los estaba encendido Oh Qué gran servicio tuvimos tiene un ungimiento sea bueno o malo tiene ungimiento Depende si está en orden o no hay un ungimiento usted cambia el ungimiento y entra en la enseñanza la enseñanza un poco un poco seca y de repente sus ojos empiezan a de caer Amén hermano Amén de repente todo tiene que ir al baño en medio del servicio Qué pasa qué está sucediendo aquí usted no puede no puede manejar el ungimiento de la enseñanza cada uno de nosotros en un punto o en otro de nuestra vida hemos atrasado por eso cuando usted llega a una madurez Oh no puedo recibir suficiente deme más deme más no puedo esperar hasta que regrese otra vez está pasando hay otro ungimiento aprendiendo no solamente es saltar para arriba y para abo necesitamos eso Pero dígame una cosa que usted ha aprendido cuando usted está saltando y gritando en la iglesia nada Dígame una sola cosa que usted ha aprendido cuando todo está bien en su [Música] vida hay tiempos de refrescamiento que el Señor nos da usted ent lo profundo la palab es cuando usted realmente se da cuenta quién es usted la enseñanza lo posiciona usted pero la gente no quiere ser posicionada quiere ser solitarios quieren salir y hacer la y Lu regresar a la iglesia señor nadie está cuando siñor puesto a ser posicionado en el cuerpo vamos a entrar algo aquí cansados se voltean los ojos un poco maestro solo ven los ojos blancos he visto muchos ojos blancos a través de pero de repente la música empieza a sonar el director de canto empieza Wow se cambia su continencia Oh Qué servicio estoy diciendo esto por razón cuando nos chequeamos nosotros mismos cómo nos comparamos Ahora observen hay algo que está aconteciendo ahora mismo en esta mañana que sus cinco sentidos no se lo pueden declarar hay algo que está sucediendo con cada una de nuestras almas Y usted le va a arrar si si trata de entenderlo con los cinco sentidos observe lo que dice si usted no tuviera vista lo que usted ve sería otro mundo que usted no sabe nada respecto estos son los os lo que Dios nos dio para podos contactar uno al otro pero por fe usted empieza a subir esa escalera Lo que empezamos lo que estamos haciendo esta mañana y luego finalmente usted puede subir tanto hasta que usted entra rompe otro mundo es lo que estamos tratando de llegar entonces reclamamos conoc a Dios pero mi pregunta es conoce usted a Dios bajo sus cinco sentidos o por cómo lo conoce todos tiene que hacerse la pregunta lo conoce por sentimientos o emociones Oh la iglesia Oh me siento no base su destino eterno en eso Aunque está bien wow wow posiblemente podamos convertir a esta Corintios 4 que si nuestro evangelio está aún encubierto entre los que se pierden está encubierto vivimos en un mundo neurótico Estoy a punto parte principal vivimos en un mundo tan neurótico nervioso por qué la gente está tan nerviosa porque tienen problemas tienen verdaderos problemas cada uno cada uno tenemos asuntos Oh tengo un problema con licor Oh tengo problema con porf tengo problema con maruana usted tiene un problema de pecado usted corrige El problema del pecado Y eso cuida de todos los otros problemas es suficiente ahora yendo a la iglesia pagos y ofendas no va a arreglar su problema van la iglesia quieren que mágicamente desaparezcan no es la manera como funciona tiene que haber arrepentimiento tiene que haber un giro de un lado al otro lado usted no está viendo la parábola correctamente Pero tiene que sacar las raíces de por eso es que la gente no recibe ayuda vienen al pastor y le cuentan la mitad de la verdad yo no sé por me está pasando esto solamente me paso yo no sé en serio vemos a esto y luego figuramos porque vamos al representante de Dios y no somos ciertos verdaderos nos quedamos en nuestra condición Dios necesita un corazón limpio para poner el secreto adentro estoy hablando con alguien aquí él necesita un corazón limpio para poder establecer su palabra ahí y poner el secreto ahí vamos dando la vuelta a la esquina para los secretos ahora la Biblia dice que los secretos pertenecen a quién pertenecen al Señor Dios Dios pero estas cosas reveladas nos pertenecen a nosotros y a nuestros hijos que podamos hacer todas las obras de esta ley aquí es donde estamos en el único lugar provisto paración a través de las ciudades muchos han buscado el secreto el lugar secreto para adorar a Dios a través de todas las edades aú Job quería saber dónde vivía Si pudiera yo solamente llegar a su casa y tocar en la puerta si yo pudiera solamente ver donde él vive para encontrar el lugar de morada de Dios porque allí Dios y su familia adoran juntos J simplemente qu justo en la palabra los pasajes secretos qué justo con la palabra los pasajes secretos esta dirección de Dios está en los secretos en los pasajes secretos de la Biblia es esos pasajes secretos deben estar en usted y yo estamos comparando esto por no sabemos los secretos de Dios porque no nos puede confiar de [Aplausos] ellos me salí la salida incorrecta él se lo puede dar solamente a alguien que lo pueda guardar él nos no está mostrando Cómo buscarlo Cómo encontrarlo Cómo entrar en ese en esa cámara secreta bien Aquí está el rapto Jesús El Rapto dijo el hermano bram lo pens Como vi como una parábola lo enseñ como una parábola si usted cree que va a entender el rato sin entender la parábola nunca el rapto está envuelto en la parábola Oh estamos entrando algo bueno acá estamos ya llegando ahí el rapto es una parábola cuando Explica el sin entender la parábola él dice que la muestra y la enseñó de muchas diferentes maneras Aquí hay una manera habían 10 vírgenes que fueron a salir a encontrar al Señor esta parábola y ahí está la revelación del rapto pero no solamente la muestra en esa parábola lo mostró en todas las parábolas todas las parábolas tenían que ver con su Primera y última venida segunda venida están envueltas en esto pero esa palabra tiene que ser depositada en algún lugar necesita un corazón que sido limpio para que poder descargar su palabra en ese corazón para que el secreto puede ser revelado aquí nos encontramos los secretos de su venida están conmigo tomamos las escrituras de la Biblia y fallamos encontrar los secretos pasajes ahí tengo que irme ustedes no sabían A dónde iba Pero tenía un pasaje secreto por acá estoy llegando a un lugar con esto Ahora estoy V pasé por este pasaje secreto Oh debieron haber visto lo que yo vi cuando Pasé por ahí había muchas cosas buenas ahí Oh much muy buenas cosas en esa oficina Tom las escrituras fallamos en encontrar los secretos pases no sabemos los secretos entonces de su venida vivimos la vida y no nadie sabe es la misma la misma cosa nadie es perfecto y todo lo que Escucha es la venida del Señor la venida del Señor nadie sabe nadie sabe Aquí ya está escrito está escrito en los cielos está escrito Aquí está escrito en el libro y está escrito en mi corazón hay secretos que han sido dados para usted y yo para que sepamos vamos a ver dónde vamos con esto la mayoría de los que leen la Biblia la mayoría de los cristianos Si usted dice sabe usted Cuándo viene Jesús no no no nadie sabe puedo levar usted por unos pasajes quiero levar lugares esta mañana Oh tengo mucho tiempo todavía dijo que podía tomarme todo el tiempo en mundo esto es vida obs Quiero llevarlo por unos pasajes secretos unos caminos secretos usted no va a ver ya esto después igual después de hoy quiero que quiero introducirlo a una palabra que es tan pequeña parece tan insignificante que la mayoría de la gente lo pasa por alto pued inuc esta palabra es la entrada es el pasaje secreto es el pasaje secreto a la mente de Dios están listos están esperando por esta palabra emocion Cuántos quieren saber lo que es esta palabra es un pasaje secreto no quiere usted ir en ese pasaje secreto quiero introducirlos a la palabra pero p e r o parece tan insignificante qué tiene que qué tiene que ver con un pasaje secreto están conmigo voy a probar eso por [Aplausos] laab voy dar estoy entrando la entrada a algún lugar Génesis 67 observen porque no deben aislar las cosas y dijo Jehová hombres que he creado desde sobre la faz de la Tierra desde el hombre hasta la Bestia y reptil y todos las aves del cielo y aisle esto y diga Oh está destruyendo a todo el mundo porque no hay esperanza no hay esperanza va destruir al hombre las besas y todo lo demás siguiente ver un momento [Aplausos] pero la palabra pero ahí pero está introduciendo una frase está introduciendo una cláusula que contrasta el verso anterior el pasaje anterior voy a dejar esto que siente un poquito introduce una frase una cláusula que contrasta con el el pasaje anterior no lo anula o lo Cancela pero muestra un pasaje secreto una manera de escape para el pueblo de Dios voy a destruir a los hombres y las bestias y todas las cosas las aves pero no encontró gracia en los oos de Dios usted y yo ahora esa palabra en pero está envuelta en Gracia porque le está mostrando a usted no importar su condición la palabra de escape un camino para Ed [Aplausos] y encontraron gracia los ojos de Dios sobre el mar y sobre la Tierra levantó su mano al cielo y juró por el que vive para siempre jamás que ha creado el cielo y las cosas que están en él y la Tierra y las cosas que están en ella y el mar y las cosas que están en él que el tiempo no será más no p hasta que le diga yo el tiempo no será más Ya se acabó la parábola se acabó cuando de repente esto para pero voltea a ver y había un Cordero y de repente el Ángel dijo el tiempo no será más y de repente el siguiente verso [Aplausos] pero los días de la voz del Séptimo Ángel cuando é comenz a tocar el misterio de Dios será consumado como él lo anunció a sus siervos los [Aplausos] profetas pueden ver el contraste pueden ver el contraste eso es lo que hace la parábola real no he terminado Mateo 24 2434 Mateo de cierto os digo que no pasará Esta generación que todas estas cosas no acontezcan el cielo y la tierra pasarán Pero mis palabras [Aplausos] no vamos al 36 ahora pero del día y la hora nadie sabe ni aú Los Ángeles de los cielos nadie lo sabe no hay ningún hombre que lo sepa no ningún Ángel lo sabe Pero en contraste a eso hay alguien que sí lo [Aplausos] sabe Gracias señor solamente el padre vamos a llegar a eso ningún hombre sabe el día ni la hora pero alguien lo hace el padre lo sabe yo a es verso iré el resto de mi vida pensando que nadie nunca sabrá cuá va a ser la venida del Señor exto el padre vivimos así nuevamente vivimos así como que solamente el padre lo sabe y esierto está aislado esa palabra esa escritura y ahora usted está cerrado a todo lo que todo el resto de lo que le de la escritura dice observen esto ahora están captn Están capt algo es introducido yo no quiero quedarme solamente en una palabra aislada porque dice ningún hombre ningún Ángel pero mi padre solamente decir Oh Solo el padre verso 37 comienza con pedo otra vez aquí está su pasaje deo pero como en los días de Noé aquí le está dando una clave como los días de Noé Así será la venida del hij [Aplausos] hombre estamos empezando a entender como que un profeta es un hijo de hombre pero está está revelando el hijo de hombre tenemos algún creyente acá Aquí estamos aquí no encont donde los hombres se equivocaron trataron de calcular cuánd venía vendría Jesús si lo ponemos at trés de este año y este año y luego vamos al calendario juliano y luego entramos al calendario profético Y luego el Romano están tratando de figurar hoy todo lo que Escucha Oh viene este jueves 2002 el 2012 parece que cada año hay otro Uy y luego lo usan y luego le Pon un giro es la manera como controlan a la gente con temor Oh viene Jesús viene Jesús vale que vaya la iglesia ahora Oh si lo hace venir a la iglesia pues está bien sir su propósito pero está usted lejos usted está lejos del reino cuando usted está pensando esa manera Aquí estoy ya cuando veníamos por acá empecé a leer este verso primera de Tesalonicenses 5 le erra la venida secreta le le le erra a la aparición la aparición y la venida son cosas dos cosas diferentes está en una venida sin la aparición par un momento aquí Jesús resucita Esto es lo que está exactamente lo que está sucediendo hoy jes bibl pregunta biia dice que Jesús le apareció a Mara aparece a nosotros hay una aparición antes de su venida ella fue dijo a todos los que estab lando les dijo y la Biblia dice y no le creyeron Jesús está vivo en m el mundo de verdad no bien piens respo hac la misma cosa con nosotros primer vamos a recoger ahora despierto pero acerca de los tiempos y los momentos empieza con un empero no tenéis hermanos necesidad que yo os escriba si el empero contrasta con algo que dijo previamente tengo que regresar al capítulo anterior es el verso el primer verso de este capítulo ni siquiera me pegó hasta que ya llegó y empezamos con hermano morten a leer esto primera Tesalonicenses 4 [Música] 16 el 51 no tiene mucho sentido sol hasta que usted regrese el cuatro y tiene sentido total [Aplausos] porque el mismo señor con aclamación con voz de Arcángel y con voz de trompeta de Dios trompeta de Dios descenderá de los cielos y los muertos en Cristo resucitarán primero luego nosotros los que vivimos los que juntamente que seremos arrebatados en las nubes en las nubes para recibir al Señor en el aire Y así estaremos siempre con el señor por tanto consolado los unos a los otros con estas palabras confortos unos a los otros ahí puedo escuchar el pueblo en los tiempos de Pablo diciendo bien Te creemos Pablo cuando va a pasar la trompeta y la voz denos una sazón una etapa una temporada no les contestó de esa manera regresemos otra vez al capítulo C les pued les puedo escuchar decir Pablo cuando el tiempo para esto cuando vieron que no no lo captaron Enton dio pero pero acerca de los tiempos y de los momentos no tenéis hermano necesidad que yo escriba porque yo sé que van a tratar de figurar cuándo es pero Dios le dio un tiempo específico a los judíos pero no le dio tiempo específic los gentiles los tiempos y todo esto no le puedo decir no es Razo para que yo les diga esto y luego abre un pasaje ahora el pasaje ha sido abierto porque vosotros tamb sab perfectamente que el día del señor vendrá como Ladrón de noche viene como un ladrón nadie lo sabrá y vivimos nuestra vida así herman dice Usted tiene que vivir su vida como que viene ya ahora mismo ese es el problema si fuera como 3 años Yo me puedo tener un buen tiempo arrepentirme Oh tan ciegos tan ciegos observen esto observen mientras Pablo empieza a mostrarles esto usted no puede aislar esto porque está está preguntándose como el resto del mundo eso significa que vendrá como un ladrón para cada uno oh oh oh porque cuando digan paz y seguridad entonces vendrá sobre ellos destrucción de repente como los dolores de la mujer preñada y no escapará porque porque no saben el pasaje secreto verso cu aquí está su secreto más no le voy a hablar de temporadas y tiempos nada de eso pero vosotros Quiénes son vosotros aquí aquí má vosotros hermanos no no estáis en tinieblas para que aquel día para quea aquel día os sobrec como ladrón no para usted Usted no va a estar en oscuridad él no lo va a quitar a usted como un ladrón porque usted ha visto estrecho el camino y angusto es el camino que lleva la vida pocos la encontrarán Porque todos vosotros sois hijos de luz viene como un lón la noche eso no es para usted todos son hijos de luz hijos aquí venimos aquí es la parte que el Señor me dio e hijos del día esere un momento no somos de la noche ni de las tinieblas alabado sea Dios somos hijos del día voy a voltearle aquí un poco son los hijos del rey decimos eso usted tiene que saber quién es el rey sí Yo Soy hijo del rey Quién es el rey Quién es el rey explíqueme sa qué sabe usted el rey si ese es su papá usted debe saber todo el respecto pregúntame cualquier cosa acerca de mi padre número de segur social toda la información qué quieres saber Ese es mi papá si usted es un hijo del rey Usted tiene que conocer el rey son hijos e hijas de Dios con Dios se manifiesta seela ustedes son la novia de Jesucristo es la cosa más grande que puede acontecer Cuántos son la novia de Cristo de Jesucristo Usted tiene que conocer a Jesucristo hacer otra pregunta cuántos de ustedes son hijos del día más vale que conozca el día [Aplausos] si ustedes son hijos de la luz debe conocer si son hijos del día deben conocer el día Hero no ningún hombre conoce le dijeron hermano br ningún hombre sabía ningún hombre lo [Aplausos] sabía hermano Qué está pasando o yo le escritura pero si ustedes son hijos del día van a conocer el día la resurrección está en nosotros rapto está en nosotros Por qué piensa usted que Dios lo muestra en los cielos primero por qué lo muestra en los cielos primero no está mostrando algo por por qué todas estas señales lo muestra los cielos para mostrarles algo que hay una conferencia que está aconteciendo pue puede guardar un secreto dice me di cuenta después de un rato que era lo que él me estaba preguntando Cómo guardo yo un secreto ahora mi mente ha cambiado cómo lo mantengo un secreto Cuál es la mejor manera de mantener un secreto fcil no haga una decisión al respecto va para no por no vienes Quiz puedas Predicar el domingo posible Yo no hice una decisión pero después de un rato hace click haga su decisión su decisión es que usted va a ir nadie lo sabía hasta que me levanté el miércoles voy a ir a tuon si alguien le gustaría ir hice la decisión ahí voy a contar una historia voy a tener 15 minutos conté ya aquí antes un nuevo pastor 23 años sé yo algo de Yo soy obediente esta hermana mi padre llama y quiero todos en Silver City le dije a la iglesia el pastor nos quiere que vayamos a Silver City vamos para allá esta hermana era la mayor de la iglesia me miró los ojos y me yo no voy a ir 23 años tiene el pastor de esta iglesia yo le dije él quiere Que todos vayamos Ella dijo No yo no voy a [Música] ir tuve que alejarme la iglesia el domingo y Ah con su gran sonrisa mucho que aprender mucho que aender mucho aprender dije no voy Elm cuando estaba dormido no tuve problema llegar allá tengo mucho que aprender pue maner un secreto no ha una decisión hasto para digo eso por una razón porque cuando hablamos de esto ningún hombre sabía ni siqu pero Lu her dice hay una conferencia que está aconteciendo hay tanto más pero Toc terminar déjeme terminar estos momentos ni siquiera Los Ángeles sabían una conferencia mensaje confer her una conferen reformo para predicar justificación y loz gran conferencia loses para predicar santificación y luego dijo una conferencia para Wesley y Los Ángeles Santos de Dios pensé que no sabían ciertas cosas Los Ángeles Santos de Dios y Dios tuvieron una conferencia porque era tiempo para predicar santificación y ellos ellos seleccionaron a Wesley es profundo esto y ellos escogieron Wesley lo seleccionar y restauración en Pentecostés hubo una conferencia que el ci es tiempo de de vaciar todo del cielo y lo predicaron lo predicaron y lo captamos recibimos el espíritu santo pero ahora yo creo que estamos en otra conferencia esto es Antes de que predicara los sellos estamos en otra conferencia Esa es la venida del hijo de Dios é dijo a sus discípulos no conozco el minuto la hora nadie lo sabe Jesús no lo sabía mientras él estaba en elicio de hijo pero cuando él sube hacio al dijo vengo de Dios regreso a Dios vengo el oficio de padre y regreso a ese oficio ahora el oficio del padre empieza a enviar su revelación de regreso a la tierra nadie lo sabe ni siquiera Los Ángeles pero nuev nadie lo sabe ni siquiera Los Ángeles pero de lo que fue dicho anteriormente Esto va a ser un contraste con eso pero habrá una conferencia algún día en otras palabras el padre va a decir ese momento que regresaré Yo creo que esa conferencia está aconteciendo y una decisión está siendo hecha Oh iglesia por herman contó la historia del ranchero y su hijo buscándole una hija para él por contó la historia de esa pequeña prima esa muchacha no fue solamente para contar una historia para llenar los blancos había un propósito detrás de eso Porque ese hijo le dijo a esa muchacha regresaré por ti en un año no me importa lo que las otras iglesas digan no me importa lo que las otras primas digan regresaré por usted en un año mientras aconteció pasó el tiempo dijeron Sí ve no viene por usted pero ella nunca tió la palabra él dijo un año y llegará en un año y en los últimos minutos parece que se hubiera acabado toda esperanza empieza a escuchar Las ruedas él viene viene camino ella estaba preparada ella estaba lista para encontrarle porque ella sabía que ella era el día ella era el día que el señor había hecho y regaremos y estaremos contentos de qué día del lunes a sábado al domingo este día por eso es que dice una vez más en los días de la voz del Séptimo Ángel Cuál era el propósito de su ministerio es tomar Los Cabos sueltos tomar los días y juntarlos para qué es un gran y terrible día del señor es un gran día para creyentes es un día terrible para el incrédulo ya termino AC misterio es un secreto nadie lo sabía siqua Los Ángeles reveló rón bajo Elo misterio cuando el s sello fue abierto hubo silencio puedo entrar los siete truenos momento los siete truenos emitieron sus voces Juan se le prohibió que lo escribiera que escribiera la venida del Señor ya estoy terminando los secretos de su venida a Juan no le fue permitido escribirlo dijo Dios lo haré yo mismo lo lo escribiré en los corazones deellos Y si usted no va a encontrar lo que fue escrito en la Biblia es una palabra no escrita Mu la Biblia d dice una Polonia di pero se van dar cuenta uno de estos días que siempre estaba í y por todo el mundo Y predicar el evangelio ahí Esta es la parte que me agarra a Juan se prohibió escribir la venida del Señor es Cristo el misterio revelado es una cosa que él aún no ha revelado la palabra aún significa que algo viene des no ha revelado aún de cómo vendrá él cuándo vendrá Yo no dije eso el profeta ahora lo estoy diciendo con toda confianza una cosa que no había revelado aún Cómo vendrá yando es una cosa buena si no la hace ahora vi como voltea mostrado lo ha revelado en cada tipo en la Biblia pero si usted no se encuentra a sí mismo en la historia nunca verá los pasajes secretos usted irá por la vida diciendo ningún hombre conoce el día ni la hora pero la novia Ella no es un hombre no dijo en ningún momento que ninguna novia [Aplausos] lo que fue una vez El gran secreto de Dios el gran misterio su mente es ahora puesto en el corazón del creyente lo que fue un día El gran secreto de Dios fue hablado por su profeta ahora ha sido puesto en el corazón del creyente fue su gran secreto en su mente de la fundación del mundo pero ahora esend piensa al respecto el gran misterio de Dios lo que una vez estuvo en su mente ahora está en el cuerpo de Cristo Jesús haciendo amor a la iglesia su novia murmuro secretos a ella [Música] sabes lo que le dije sabes lo que le dije porque no era para
