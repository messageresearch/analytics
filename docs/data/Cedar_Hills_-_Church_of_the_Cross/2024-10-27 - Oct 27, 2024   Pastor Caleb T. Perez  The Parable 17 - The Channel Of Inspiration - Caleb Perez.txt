now all right make sure you tell your neighbor neighbor you ready make sure we're ready that message yesterday whoa you didn't come yet yesterday whoa yeah that's good stuff we we were hearing the message of brother brandom I have heard but now I see and wow what a message it was like he was here he was here just wow it's spiritual food and due season gr to God for that let's get into the word and and I actually got my subtitle from the message yesterday anybody remember remember him saying that the channel of inspiration and only the inspires are the channel of inspiration you know what I mean our founding pastor preached the message the inspires amen so let's get into the word and I pray it blesses you and we'll go as long as the Lord tells me and then we'll stop when he says stop Matthew 13 and verse 36 38 when you have it you can say Amen excuse me Thro doesn't matter if I cover it up or not we also greet everyone that's online God bless you wherever you're at World God bless you pleasure having you with us this morning Matthew 13:36 says then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field now we we have heard me many messages on the tears right the tears they're the What's called the Darnell weeds right remember that Darnell weeds no yeah all right well they're the Darnell weeds okay and the tears are not just some weeds that grow the pears look exactly like the wheat and you don't tell you can't tell the difference that's why Jesus said let them grow together but when they come to maturity then you can tell the difference and he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man so if the one that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man which is Jesus Christ then we are to carry his name is that right what a message we heard last Sunday the weight of Glory we were in the mountains and man it was good the weight of Glory wow and if you have his name there's a weight that goes with his name the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one Mark 14 I'm sorry Mark 4:14 just one verse here and then I'll and then one more verse and then we'll I'll have you sit down Mark 4:14 says the S Seth the word who SWS the word that's over all right 1 John 2:15 and 16 and then we will start the message wait till you get it it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world go ahead if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated I haven't been here so brother Santiago and sister Maria God bless you God bless you it's good to have you with us this morning one thing we know in this world we are constantly being bombarded with seeds SE Goes Forth to sew and there are seeds being planted all the time yes or yes I don't know about you but both good and bad and the ones that we tend to take care of are the ones that grow yeah the ones we pay more attention to are the ones that ended up end up growing bigger and that is why I mentioned the last time our belief system is always changing because we allow so many different seeds to be planted in US am I talking to anyone here we are once again being bombarded constantly with seeds remember thoughts become words and words are seeds that's why when we get a thought we either take ownership of it or we don't okay once again when we get a thought we'll either take ownership or we won't it is said and we've said this few times an idea is like a virus resilient highly contagious and even the smallest seed of an idea can grow it can grow to Define you or destroy you we heard last Sunday that uh that Satan is the father of Lies amen how many know the Bible says that is that right Satan is the F the father of Lies how many once again know that let me see your hands if you know if you don't know it don't raise your hand it's amazing if we know he's the father of Lies it's amazing how easily he gets us to believe him okay once again how many of you know that he's the father of Lies now if he's lying to you somebody's lying to you do you believe them say no right say no of course not but when he comes to you and tells you that you're no good that that you're not going to amount to nothing tells you that you're sick it tells you tells you that you're lesser than someone else it tells you you're not going to make it he tells you all these things and the first thing we do is I guess uh I guess I'm not worthy okay once again how many know he's the father of Lies so why is it so easy to believe the father of Lies than to believe the father of Truth why is that ask your yourself the question it's what we were hearing last Sunday it was so wonderful we take his word even before God's word many times God Says by my stripes you are healed says you're going to die who do we believe Satan says you're not going to make it your past sins are coming to haunt you and God said you already made it just believe me and yet it's so hard to believe that right than than to believe the other and after a while you kind of get tired of it and you're like why am I so easily deceived or or why do I so easily believe these things the Bible says you got to try the spirits right try the thoughts and see if they are of God or not and that's like very hard for us to even do that but I'm coming to something that I want I want to share with you you know as we were hearing this message last night we hear Brother brandham as he goes into the into the creation of squirrels see the the so many different ways that that that the Lord [Music] showed and and even the the the third pool the the five identifications of the third pool and so forth but when he goes into the creation of things my goodness I have heard but now I see you know and that's the thing is why no one can take it away from us no one can tell us anything different because when they say it that was just for brother brandom no brother brandom even said the third pole is to the total loss but it's for the bride now now now think about that how do we put that into action this is where we get stuck because we believe those things it's easy to believe when the enemy comes and says oh no no no that's just for brother brandham that's just for this brother or that sister everything that is written in the scripture is mine so I want you to tell your neighbor this morning everything that is in the scriptures is mine now either you believe that or you don't either you're going to believe that or you're going to believe saying when he's when he tell you but he says all that I have I've given to you but why do we not believe those things today you know after a while you kind of grow a little bit and mature in some things and you're like wait a minute wait a minute that's why I I I want to be real with you this morning a couple of weeks ago I was out jogging know sometimes it doesn't look like one's jogging or exercising believe me I was out there well I think I'm jogging know I kind of go and then I and then it's like after a while you know just like I'm not going very fast but I was out I was out let's just put it like that walk fast and as I'm walking this thought comes and here this respon says I I can't believe it I can't believe it no no I can't believe it how in the world how could a man like Solomon considered to be the wisest man on Earth had a gift of wisdom a gift of discernment how could he allow him self to have a thousand wives and concubines wouldn't he have known that if he brought all these different women from different parts of the world wouldn't he have known that they were going to come with their Idols they were going to come with their religions they were going to bring them into Israel and cause many people to to be taken away from God that it would even pull himself from God don't you think that the wisest man would have known that right I'm I'm just saying I don't know about you so I'm I'm I'm telling you the thought that came we Ponder those things and as we Ponder them we tend to always view the things in a carnal way that's our biggest problem yes or yes amen everything we look at we think it's all carnal why did they do that why did she do that why why why you're looking at it carnally but as I was thinking about that I took I took that into captivity I took that thought into captivity and all of a sudden a voice tells me it won't make sense if you look at it carnally but if you put on your spiritual eyes you'll know that Solomon's life was a type of Christ yes or yes oh now it's starting to make a little bit better sense and I said that's true Lord he says and then all of a sudden he says can't you see have not I taken all each each one of you my bride I've taken them from different parts of the world whether whatever religion they were in whatever Idols they had I brought them together to be my don't you see it was just a perfect type you you began to see things a little better now things are clear that's why many times even in our own life why did I do that what what why what was I thinking but when when it comes down to it you realize one thing that the footsteps of the righteous are are ordered of God yes or yes come on tell your neighbor the footsteps of the righteous no no no no no no no let me stop turn to your neighbor again say my footsteps are ordered of God oh now we're getting somewhere it's not just the footsteps of the righteous oh they're they're wonderful great people never do anything wrong no no they're righteous because of his righteousness not because of their own righteousness they're not worthy because of themselves they're worthy because their sacrifice is the worthy one so tell your other neighbor now say my footsteps they are ordered or ordained of God now now do you believe that the scripture says that so can the enemy tell you ah you're just a failure all you have to do is tell him no my footsteps are ordered of God that's why then why is it that their lives in the Old Testament were part of a great parable and we acknowledge it and we understand it Solomon perfect type do you believe that you know Solomon was just a man just like you I'm making a point here I hope you're getting it was just a man I hope you're getting it this morning why is it so easy to believe Solomon even after all the things that were done carnally there's a lot of things that are wo yeah read read all that he wrote he'll tell you things he went through why he chose this and this and and it's easy to believe those people why do we believe them because the Bible said so right so it makes it easier right they're in the Bible so are you hello everybody come on now tell your neighbor so are you so are you I find myself all over the Bible Well it doesn't say your name yeah it does it says Caleb and Joshua don't look at it carnally look at it spiritually we're all calebs is that right think about this though through their ups and downs they typed Christ yet we have a hard time believing that we are part of this great parable it's easy to believe the minister or the pastor another news flash the pastor is is just a Man Too Well same seems like I burst your bubble or what the pastor just a m he is oh man come on a man just like you yes I've been given something to help God's people a GI yes ab and we don't take that for granted but understand there are struggles every day young people understand this you're not by yourself we struggle we Minister struggle just like you we thoughts we get we get thoughts that come to us we got to fight them off just like you we get Spirit of anxiety attacking us but we got to fight them off just like you are you with me I want you to understand this what God thinks about you that's right this message is to tell you the things that he tells me like I said I'm be real with you as brother Bram says oh he just began to talk to my conscience he talks to my conscience more than anyone else anybody else here so I leave for my trip thank the Lord for this time he gave me and I'm on the road and you think oh relax when hunting he don't care he don't take vacations so I'm driving we're driving there and here he comes again because I was thinking now this was not the enemy this was me so you know some of the things that brother Caleb thinks about can I share it with you all right driving down the road and I began to think of all the new people that that have comeing coming in my goodness amen amen and I and I began to think more and more I was like the time is rapidly fle and then I began to think of the Pastors in Uganda and the people there Lord will will they get it they're getting it I began to see the the body of Christ coming together in different parts different countries parts and you just see this one connecting with that and the body somehow some way what man could not do God is doing but he's doing it through man and and I'm thinking about this and then I and then I start to think about Lord the people that have been in for many years can't seem to overcome and they they struggle with the same things over and over that's my mind going and then the enemy comes to my conscience and this is what he tells me you're going to run out about the back of my hair on the back of my neck standing up and then he tells me again you're going to run out of time there's not enough time now you that are new don't you get scared don't get scared but I'm thinking this and and the enemy comes to tell me this I can either take ownership of that thought or I can reject the thought I have a decision I have a choice that I can make you see when you hear a voice or or receive a thought shows that there's a channel open are you with me come on now there's a channel he's trying to get in and so he he's he's doing different things to try to to try to get in now now now this is through the message and we heard this but I'm gonna I'm going to quote what brother brandham says when you know you've done exactly what God told you to do then wait wa for that channel of inspiration to open up to you I want to know how many of you have have waited on God it's not just waiting on him it says when you've done exactly what God told you to do how many of you believe that God God can speak to you through the pastor and then and then things don't go right well I'm waiting on God when you've done exactly what the Lord told you then he says wait for the channel of inspiration to open up see he says we've got to have confidence I want this to the honor and glory of God everything we do should be for the honor and glory of God get to something good here in a moment you see faith has a channel to move into if it doesn't then you you've got mental intellectual faith and not genuine Faith from God this is one scripture brother Ram says that stumped me there you go yeah it STP me exactly a good one this is one scripture that stumped me not if I say this is the Lord telling him but if you say not if Jesus said it but if you say it of yourself okay okay how many believe this the prophet of God once again not if Jesus said it but if you said it of yourself oh that's what we want he says I thought and somehow I broke into that channel how many of you have ever been in that channel I thought we were Christians thought we were Believers you never broke into that channel oh my goodness you need to come talk to me see me and I thought somehow I broke into that channel and then he goes on and says old little H is sitting back there talking about the squirrels that brother brandom that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing and when she said that the Holy Spirit dropped over in that channel again and every one of them felt it I raised up and I said sister H thus sayth the Lord you said the right word like the serapan said and then he says now notice job needed a Channel of inspiration and he had it open he had a channel to communicate with God by his inspiration he had a way of moving himself out and let the word of God move in so if you've never been in that channel it's because you've never learned how to get yourself out so that he can come in all right but we got it yeah all right you see the reason that the channel of inspiration doesn't open to many because we don't know how to relax yes or yes I'm going to keep you awake today yeah tell your neighbor stay awake neighbor all right yeah we got to stay awake because we've got to get this okay this is important we can't relax because our pride gets in the way oh you're going to you're going to know what I'm talking about in a moment once again you can't relax because our pride gets in the way and then he goes on that's what all Divine gifts are to serve God's people with everybody's not ordered to be a prophet yes or yes all of you is not ordered to praying for the sick all of is not ordered to be pastors and so forth but it's a channel that God has open to them and as he we had this morning in the lesson one man has no business deviating in the next man's Channel tell your neighbor you got to tell your neighbor that s you going to help me Preach Today one man has no right to get into another man's Channel no matter how inspired you are I like that one think about it how many here are saved good I like that good praise God that was a channel that was revealed to you brother says that's the channel That was revealed how many of you need healing you see your hands if you need healing of something brother Ram says this it's the same channel on wait a minute we don't have to go to a through another channel to get healed how many people saved do we have you sure can anyone tell you you're not saved that's how sure you have to be for your for your healing brother says it's the same channel Hallelujah that's the same channel that through divine revelation tells you that you're healed the problem is is that the channel gets clogged sometimes and sometimes we got to just blow the channel out and get the junk out now don't forget but the devil had told me okay CU it all goes together in the message you're going to run out of time I had that one working in back of my now now now during the hunt during the huh now how many Hunters we have here a lot of hunters hunters and Hunters how many good Hunters brother Isaac I can't I can't I can't raise my hand on that one I'm just a hunter by the help of God I I I need I mean sometimes I'm out there think Lord I need divine intervention but I enjoy it but I hear that again you're going to run out of time now when the hunt started my hunt me me sharing with you as the hunt started I I had many opportunities but I had already told them the the the men that were out there I said as if I see it's got to be bigger than the last one I killed now in one sense that would be like acting like a spoiled brat no no no no everything this is what I'm getting at do you you ever look at your life really as a parable if what the prophets of old and the people in the Old Testament they type what should the reality of it be we are the parable church then everything we do in our lives should matter we're we're not just we're not just Christians at church we got we got to be the same Christian out there whether we're at work or whether we're at school or whether we're hunting that's how he showed to the prophet the third pool you want the squirrel come on is that just for him but it opened up for us to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever it wasn't brother Bram that was doing it there was something from eternity that had been deposited in that man that allowed him to speak and to bring things into existence okay now forgive me if I get excited but watch this now I had decided that you ask them it comes to Hunted I'm at least disciplined say no names I don't want to say no names but I know there's there's quite a few they purpose nope I'm holding out for the big one and as soon as something moves boom and like you really held out that one but at least I can say I'm disciplined when it comes to that and I said I'm going to wait till the last evening now all this there's there's there's a relevance to all this I'm gonna wait till the last evening I'm gonna was GNA hunt and I walked away I don't even know how many he sent ones nice ones nope I don't want that one I walked away come on that was nice for you not for me no I walked away and I decided that at the last moment because I had either sex uh my license I said at the last moment what the Lord puts in my path just so I can take home some meat that's a good plan right well during the hunt brother Omar was telling me a story about a young man who was out hunting and he did not he couldn't see he didn't see any animals and an old man that was there with him he told him simply this just relax it seems like insignificant relax he said so I did what he told me I just relaxed and the moment I did I started seeing him everywhere do that hunt you know after a while your eyes get tired you see everything moving oh there's one oh no it's after a while it just it's tiring so that became our model for the whole we won't see nothing and we and then we look at each other say relax brother Omar asked brother Omar and brother Ben if it's not true we say that and we would relax boom there they are boom there they are we would't see it for a little while just relax there's a point to all this too I'm not telling you a hunting story brother Bron wasn't just telling us hunting stor St no there was something behind what he was saying and if you're caral you're just going to see a hunt but if you're spiritual you're going to catch the spiritual application so we'd say just relax yeah it was just relaxed until it was the sun had gone down you know there's about 30 minutes left of of light before it's dark and then all of a sudden just relax huh do you start thinking well I have to go home and tell my wife what kind of story am I I wasn't always I didn't always shoot animals when I'd come home empty handed she say what's the story this don't be laughing at me that's my story he said he said that's his story too but but but through it all it's 30 minutes left before before it's dark 19 yeah two outs we count we're we're we're at the last moment now and about that time they see some in another Canyon you going to take him nope no I said I'm not going to go all the way down the canyon and go up the other Canyon for a little one like that so I get back in the side by side they looking at it 20 minutes now till dark last day of the hunt when all of a sudden the voice comes again you're going to run out of time you understand this is the same voice that told me before the hunt when I was thinking about you all when I was thinking about our Breen around the world you're going to run out of time and the voice comes one more time and says you're going to run out of time the light's gone you're going to run out of time the first thing I did I had to reject that voice I take ownership of it and the moment that I rejected that voice a channel opened up and a voice then tells me now you can believe me or not that's okay but I stand before you here before the Lord and the voice said this he says do you believe your own word and I said yes sir he said then speak it this is 20 minutes before it gets dark I said in the name of Jesus I said Lord I'm going to see one before it gets started I'm shoot it Lord but I do need your help can you please guide the bullet I did you not the GU got in it wasn't even five minutes down the road when there was an elk all by itself where it came from only God knows but there was there was an ALK by itself wow I got out so fast got out on the knee one shot and I turned around what did I say brother Omar there dropped him and I turned around I said how do you like that now I wasn't telling that to the brothers I was saying that to the spirit that told me we're going to run out of time and I said how do you like that I'm going to say it again Church how do you like that it wasn't so much about the elk it was that God is always faithful and when he says that we will make it I don't care how much light is left because what he has promised will fulfill that because the the footsteps of the righteous are already ordered of God you can believe me or not but I'm going to tell you once again just relax when the channel was open it was a to Total relaxation now let me explain this to you because it's not about sitting at home with your feet up watching television having some lemonade and said I'm relaxing no that's a carnal relaxation I'm talking about spiritual relaxation the whole world can be falling apart but in our soul should be a total perfect relaxation brother Bram says the Christian walk is based upon rest and when I'm resting in him I'm not worried about what I can or can't do I already know what he already did come on now are you with me I'm trying to bring you up to Higher Ground yeah I want to I want to go higher ground am when I see this I see what God is doing that wasn't for me I already believe I said he's never late he's always on time we're not going to run out of time come on all you young new people that had just come in you're not going to run out oh come on now you really believe that why why do you say that brother and understand I want you to get and understand this the seventh seal is the coming of Christ yes or yes the seventh seal is the end of all things it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of time that's why we can't run out how many are with me we can't run out of time because the moment you accepted him it brings you to a New Birth you are no longer a creature of time you're a creature of Eternity so how can you run out of time if you're Eternal I'm not talking about this guy I'm talking about the one that lives inside oh I love that it's the coming of Christ and my question is who is he coming to oh we're waiting for the coming of Christ clouds to open and him come through you got a denominational idea me stop for a moment because I've said this before it's just as bad to sing a lie as it is to say a lie amen right amen it's just as bad I surrender all you're not surrendered you're lying watch what you sing it would be best not to sing than to sing that's right amen All to Jesus I Surrender and then we leave and we're cussing up a storm and have one foot in the world and one and we're thinking and seeing things we shouldn't wow oh gosh help us Lord have mercy on us I'm just letting that one sink good that one that one hit good your neighbor say we're getting through it neighbor it is it don't be looking at me funny at me you see the looks you guys give me some humor me humor me I'm I'm not trying to be fun I'm telling you that's what I get this is like heaven to me I don't know why everything's going wrong when we all get to heaven oh I can't wait and you understand the denominational ideas of heaven we were not made to go live off where the angels are the ones that have passed on are dying that's not the word to use dying they're an expectation of coming back to earth oh we're going to go to heaven one of these days what's your mentality about this that we're going to go live off in a somewhere out there come on think about it we are we are Sons we were made to inhabit the Earth hallu but it's time that heaven and Earth come together this is like heaven to me and we're in the word and we're we're connected to the channel this is like heaven to me come up higher we're in a different dimension but we're here on Earth they're longing to come back come on now I could get on that for a while but that's not where I'm going relax means you're resting in Christ do you see why there's so much contention in US come on now the the fight that's going on is not we're always looking out there it's in here you know what it is our contention is our pride pride brings contention your neighbor neighbor Pride brings contention when we see this brother Bram says about the SE in the seventh seal seven straight thunders in a row heaven couldn't write them Heavens can't know it there's nothing to go on and then says it was a relax what a key I'm going to say it again what a key nothing to go on it's a relaxing time you know why we won't move until the channel until the channel of inspiration is opened up where do you want to go hunting I don't know let's try here good as any other place anybody have ideas but when it's him then we can act upon [Music] that he said it was relaxing time so great that it was kept from the Angels that's why brother Brandon would say when I relax I get myself out of the way and that's when the gift works so just relax I don't know what I'm gonna do let the channel open up and you know exactly what to do no I'm looking at it people are looking yeah I got a lot of problems get yourself out of the way because you're the reason that you have a lot of problems because you've tried to do it all your own and San Cuts you off every time but it's time not to let Satan cut you off and know that I am God then panel opens after we've moved oursel out of the way then he comes and then the thing is taken care of do you understand how our pride keeps the channel from opening to us everybody understand that I'm trying to make it as simple as possible here that's what it's all about letting him bring the answer in your life watch he says it's just a relaxing time get yourself out of the way that's what relaxing is all about not not doing nothing we don't relax because there's too much contention inside of us Proverbs 1310 what causes contention again yes only by Pride cometh content I want every one of you today and I include myself to search yourself your heart there is not one person that I've ever heard that says I got a bad Spirit upright nobody recognizes is that they have pride pride only by Pride cometh contention AER says this what what comes in our minds when we think of God is the most important thing about us we as humans we have a very hard time to bring balance in our lives try not to try not to go too long today we try to have a very hard time bringing the balance because we either think that we we either think more of ourselves or less of ourselves when you're on top of the world making some cash got some good things going on yeah we got it going on but when things are go dry no money coming in struggling then we think less of ourselves what does that show Pride you know why because we won't ask for help we won't even ask God for help I already went to him too much I prayed and he didn't answer me you're getting into some pretty Dangerous Ground this is why the hardest thing for God to do is to get one mortal to believe another mortal yes the hardest thing for God one mortal believes another mortal and then the Holy Spirit tells me and that's only half of it I'm like wait wait wait w who whoa I got to check this out is this that's only half of it one mortal to believe another and he says yes he says because first you recognize you are Immortal and you have to believe yourself you have to believe yourself if I don't believe that I'm a Son of God even though I'm Immortal even though I'm immortal but in me when Christ comes to dwell I am Immortal a lot of people ain't going to swallow that one you believe him you accept him then you cannot die that makes you immortal not this guy but the one that lives in here so he says it's hard for one mortal to believe another but I can never expect another mortal to believe me if I don't believe myself if I don't believe who I am God placed me as a pastor believe that and act like that I expect anyone else to believe how many are with me notice this is good can I have just a few more minutes I'm gonna have to like go gy speak some of my message in a prayer he's good at that he's good at that that's right that's right those are tricks of the trade notice this Glory the mistake is that pride gets in the way how many have have heard the same Pride goeth before the fall oh true Verse 18 and it says Pride goeth Before Destruction and an hotty spirit before a fall Pride or self-conceit is the opposite of humility let me say that again Pride with s got that it's the opposite of humility the first step to humility is to realize that I am proud I've got pride and most people won't won't do that because they don't have no problem with being PR right right uh oh see when everything gets quiet then it's like starts the message starts to get the story brings your attention to hear the message now yet you never hear someone say I have a spirit of Pride listen to some of these quotes that by CS Lewis pride is one of those things that we detest we hate it when we see it in someone else okay this this is the message now okay we're coming to it we hate Pride when it's somebody they think they're all that we hate it huh but when somebody saying oh you are the great hunter it's okay huh oh you're so beautiful yeah yeah I know right but if they tell that to someone else she's not that pretty he's not that handsome understand this church you'll never admit that we are ever guilty ourselves because the more Pride you have the more we dislike pride in others why is it because each person's pride is in competition with someone else's Pride I'm going to say it again that's why there's contention in a family home in a church at school at work why is there the contention because Prides are coming together and fighting each other when we want to be the center of the party and everybody's looking at someone else clown yeah but when we're making jokes and acting funny and oh yeah they're they're looking at me Pride come on now get your spiritual thinking on here I don't want you just to see this carnally I want you I'm trying to make it simple so so that you can get it in your spiritual we want to be the center pride is competitive by Nature people are not proud to be rich smart or successful they're not proud to be good-looking they're proud of being richer and smarter and better looking than others come on now it's not about yeah well I'm this no it's about that I'm more than someone else cometh before the fall greed will make a man want money greed greed somebody help usia will make a man want money for the sake of a better house a better car better food but it's Pride that makes a millionaire want to be a billionaire billionaire to be a trillionaire just to be richer than the next unchastity anger greed drunk drunkenness is merely a flea bite in comparison Pride it was through Pride that the devil became the devil yes or yes come on Church come on now you you're going to have to preach with me now the devil became the devil because of pride and pride leads to every other Vice Pride never lets you get the help that you need you're too proud to ask for help no but when we realize I need help I need divine intervention God's help now we're realizing recognizing pride in our Liv it never lets you get the help Pride listen closely write this one down pride is the complete anti-god State of Mind pride is the complete anti- good state of mind that's right why because because you want to prove that you can do it on your own am I is that a yes or a yes anti- God State of Mind is pride it never will permit you to get help I don't need help I can stop on my own we can't by Nature we can we need help we need God on the scene we need him to come on the scene we need divine intervention we can't do these things under on our own power is what Pride really enjoys nothing makes a man or a person feel Superior in power as to tell others what to do amen I don't care if it's at church if it's at work I don't care where it's at Pride causes the one to puff up you do what I tell you or else pride is the chief cause of misery Pride always brings enmity it is not only enmity between man and man but Pride brings enmity between you and God why because in God you come up against someone which is in every aspect immeasurably Superior to yourself I could stop right there and you finally come upon someone yes with so pride and unless you know God has been Superior in every way know yourself as nothing in comparison it means that you don't even know God at all that you'd have to knowledge that he is so much greater and as long as you're proud you cannot know God Church impossible to know him a proud man is always looking down on someone but while he's looking down you cannot see what's above you our pride does that to us and the real test of being in the presence of God we're in church how many like coming to church I like coming to church are you in the presence of God every time you can be in church and not be in the presence somebody is in Heavenly places and you're not but the real test of being in the presence of God is that you forget about yourself I like that one that's how you know you've been in this presence you're not thinking about me me me this I'm going through that when you're in his presence none of that matters he is the answer hello everybody you want me to stop I'll stop pride is spiritual cancer it eats up the very possibility of love and contentment pride is a death trap we test it by when whenever we find that our religious life is making us feel good and that we are better than someone else oh come on did I just go there when we feel so religious began to feel better than someone else you can surely know that you're not being acted on by God but by the devil that's my prayer today that God take every bit of Pride out of us wash me this morning Lord how many can say that this morning cleanse me from Pride Lord pride is a curse brother Brom says it's awful it leads to death my goodness when brother Jerry preached on this the Leviathan said wow wow can you draw out Leviathan with a hook cord which let thou let us down his scales are his pride shut up together as with a closed seal pride is arrogance swelling but watch who made leviathon it's all for a purpose that's why St church if you could just see the whole picture you'd know that when that serpent that leviathon comes to you you'll know it's all a set up who made a come on Psalms 104:24 through 26 oh Lord how manifold are thy Works in wisdom hast Thou made them all the Earth is full of thy riches so is this great wide sea sea is people wherein are things creeping in innumerable both small and great beasts there go the ships there is that Leviathan whom thou Hast made to play there he's got a part to play recognize simple that's the old serpent devil the liar Father of Lies he's got part are you with me he's got a part to play oh yeah he plays in the great sea but I'm here to tell you but I'm here to tell you Isaiah 271 in that day don't look very it way off in that day the Lord with his sword and great and strong sword that's his word shall punish leviathon the piercing even leviathon that crooked Serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea come on let's give one to the Lord Jesus this morning now how many of you say I Lord I I need help this morning I want to get rid of this Pride I don't want to act better than no one else it doesn't make you the Lord uses you it doesn't make you hotty the Lord's using me humility makes you more hum to get yourself out of the way he can use you open up your channel this morning church that's what he's after he wants you to open that channel he wants to open the channel to you but you got to open your channel say Lord here I am amen amen next Sunday with the help of the Lord I'm going to hit on seven women taking a hold of one man see where we're going with that that's good stuff I'm G to stop here I ask you as the as the musicians come because I can we can just go on and on and know we have seen the message in action today this message is not old or dead is more alive today than it ever has been God's people are more alive today than they ever been they have recognized who they are what they are recognize who she is in Christ she's not proud not that kind of she's humble she's look looks to see who needs help Lord I know we all another voice and then another voice says we got him turn to him today and say take that got your neighbor take that not to your neighbor but tell you know who we're talking to take that got him we made it you got it are you looking to make it we've already made it prophet of God says we made it already relax now doesn't mean that we're not going to work no we keep on working we'll work Jesus comes we'll go where he sends us but we are relaxing or resting in him now that everywhere we do go it's him sending us as you stand to your feet I'm going to ask you the question now I know because he gave me this message to preach to you I know that there's Pride in our heart small or big but I want to know how many here as you bow your heads we've got to check ourselves well I'm better than this one because I have more education and they don't that's okay you want to go but you should never feel better than anyone else because you do in your life God bless there's nothing wrong what's wrong is that when we look at others lesser you take a young girl that wants to be a housewife and people look down on that what do you mean that's the greatest thing that she could ever do you understand me I'm bringing a balance to things it's not about comparing comparing is caused by Pride to raise your brother and sister up whether you got a better job or she's got a better job or he's got a better who cares and we do all that he's called called us to do but never With Pride and where pride is not present there's no contention church because we see each other as Sons and Daughters of God so I ask is there anyone here that could say brother would you pray for me I don't want not one bit of pride in me coming of the Lord is so [Music] near so close don't let us be found with no pride in pride comes before the fall when we're too proud just to say I'm sorry come on now when we can't apologize to one another that's pride pride don't let you that's why there's contention inside of us it won't let you humble yourself and and ask for forgiveness Pride does that to [Music] us I'll wait here the Lord's calling some people he's bringing them can I get the ministers to come help me [Music] pray it's a message to check ourselves to make sure we're
