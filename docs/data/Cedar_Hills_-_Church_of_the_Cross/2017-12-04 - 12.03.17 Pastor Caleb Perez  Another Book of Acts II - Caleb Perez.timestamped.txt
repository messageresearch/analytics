[17:45] Atlanta believe she has a poem to share
[17:47] with us a man what an awesome God we
[17:51] serve amen
[17:54] [Music]
[18:06] around the middle of November and it's
[18:08] it came from the message off a super
[18:12] since and since writing this I've
[18:16] learned some really valuable lessons on
[18:19] not relying on these five senses because
[18:22] you know what they'll fail you what
[18:24] there's an old saying that goes don't
[18:27] believe anything you hear in half of
[18:29] what you see and I thought well how
[18:31] could that be if you see something with
[18:33] your eyes but you know you you can't
[18:35] believe everything you see and I had
[18:38] been prior to this I'd really been
[18:40] seeking the Lord about that substance of
[18:42] faith to possess it not to just profess
[18:47] it but to really make sure that I have
[18:49] that substance of thank you
[18:51] now I just it's just a simple poem but I
[18:54] pray it's a blessing to you now faith is
[18:59] the substance of things hoped for
[19:01] through faith we understand how the
[19:04] worlds were framed and through it the
[19:08] elders a good report obtained so that
[19:12] things which are seen were not made by
[19:16] things which do appear we cannot rely on
[19:20] what we see taste feels smell and hear
[19:24] the way our lives are controlled depends
[19:29] on what we yield our senses to by no
[19:32] means were these five image to the
[19:35] Spirit given to lead and guide you but
[19:39] there is a sixth sense superior to the
[19:42] other five which were given for earthly
[19:45] contact the sixth sense
[19:48] better known as faith given only to
[19:52] Christians
[19:53] fact it's the only one that governs and
[19:57] guides you the other five only lead to
[20:00] doubt its casting away everything
[20:05] contrary to what God said and this sense
[20:08] we can't live without for without faith
[20:12] it is impossible to please God with our
[20:16] tears and supplications he does not
[20:19] sympathize Oh
[20:21] but what touches and stops him is when
[20:24] our faith cries by his stripes I am
[20:29] healed that's what he wants us to
[20:31] testify not saying I'm not doing so well
[20:35] or I am trying to believe you are healed
[20:39] you are saved all is well do not deny if
[20:45] we could only realize the power in the
[20:48] words we speak Satan listens to every
[20:52] word we say so speak the word check
[20:57] let's check our motives
[20:59] let our yeas be A's and our nays Benes
[21:03] the correct mental attitude toward any
[21:06] divine promise of God will bring it to
[21:09] pass so we should pray daily for our
[21:13] minds to be renewed adjust our attitudes
[21:16] and simply ask being scornful and
[21:21] complaining robs us of the power of the
[21:24] Holy Ghost it drains us of oil of our
[21:27] oil I want to fix my heart mind soul and
[21:32] body on heavenly things and not for not
[21:36] toil we are his temple his chosen place
[21:41] to dwell a work in progress we stand
[21:45] let's allow him to complete the work he
[21:48] started in us till we reach the statue
[21:51] of a perfect man
[21:56] amen god bless you sister Lana for that
[21:59] this I know that my God is real and he's
[22:05] real down in my soul this morning how
[22:07] many are ready for the Word of God amen

[22:12] pastor this morning and as he comes and
[22:14] ministers to us you could please stand
[22:16] to your feet and we'll sing that song
[22:18] together my god is real before I can
[22:22] feel him deep within amen

[22:41] some places that
[22:47] but I am sure

[1:03:43] serene because he might make us and
[1:03:45] sometimes we can't even get in we can

[1:03:52] shouldn't have to tell you to raise your
[1:03:53] hand it pretty cannot move it is usually
[1:03:55] scarce but if we did it automatically

[1:09:24] brothers was speaking concerning the
[1:09:28] the seven church ages una de las
[1:09:31] hermanas Prachanda that's the lassie
[1:09:32] glaze a little bit of light that each
[1:09:34] one had either a pocket I'll escape en
[1:09:36] cada una dais and and there was some a
[1:09:38] brother there you have united memory and
[1:09:40] his wife or the Dalton Dalton into the
[1:09:44] service we were talking to them either

[1:10:48] that rejected that idea Esther predictor
[1:10:50] and about that time brother Bram says
[1:10:52] you know right now I know some of you
[1:10:54] are thinking who's projecting the image
[1:10:56] on the wall because you think a loser
[1:10:58] company alleging it and she says brother
[1:11:01] Bram says that's not anybody projecting
[1:11:04] it it is the Holy Spirit projecting it
[1:11:06] if you could hammer on a noise that
[1:11:08] ain't got that break that thing was that
[1:11:10] that last age was in total darkness in
[1:11:13] the schema-less the way it projected I
[1:11:17] seen that project Oh
[1:11:18] total eclipse only total apostasy
[1:11:21] blowing up was this yeah that's what the
[1:11:23] last age was no colloseum and Hadera

[1:11:27] these seven Church ages said oh come the
[1:11:30] remember Gandhi wholeness yet Adonis
[1:11:31] he's the one that put that little bit of
[1:11:35] light at the tip of Kenya Lucy Sita he
[1:11:40] said even though it's all has gone into
[1:11:43] apostasy is a coma central thorn on
[1:11:46] apostasy the promise is that there shall
[1:11:48] be like in the evening promises the
[1:11:51] other loose and apparent when he drew in

[1:12:10] profit that was to fulfill that part of
[1:12:13] the world and profit their computing was
[1:12:15] the only one that could put that light
[1:12:17] there a Looney cook it for your
[1:12:19] political uses he is a man who can turn
[1:12:22] on the light so longer out there yeah

[1:49:15] the look is perfect all exact witches in
[1:49:18] the art will be done away with kiss that

[1:49:36] something major was coming but can't go
[1:49:39] my jaw Ravinia I'm gonna tell you what I
[1:49:41] believe the way I said okay York I
[1:49:43] believe that everything the Holy Ghost

[1:49:47] look and especially Minister last Church
[1:49:49] and I will kill my dad he lists all of
[1:49:51] it although every sign a thing every
[1:49:54] wonder every Commission everything he's

[1:50:03] us yellow and is that the impor it
[1:50:06] doesn't just need what they gonna dump
[1:50:08] part of this nor the muscle I said he
[1:50:10] was gonna dump it all but when that
[1:50:13] which is perfect is calm it's perfect
