the ministry for the confidence that the permit is this afternoon to be able to express a little what is in our heart we bring uh greetings [Music] phoenix lighthouse the phoenix lighthouse tabernacle uh ernesto montoya and from our pastor brother ernesto montoya especially he [Music] is it a privilege but it is [Music] where god has manifested himself in a supernatural way and we cannot just pass that over lightly that's why it is an honor and a privilege to be here [Music] and i want to honor you in a special way that we could hear this glorious message yes there are stories that he tells us he always says he is my hero elizabeth he's my hero more powerful than spiderman that's right nothing in tapa from a superman they don't have a cape like superman we don't they don't need [Music] and we cannot understand it that's why i honor the ministry of tomas perez [Music] the local government god bless you i want to greet you also in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] because whenever there is a man that are there walking before opening the way there is somebody behind them backing them up and then a special greeting to the family brother caleb thank you and your family i uh whenever i see the brother i always tell my wife he always looks young i'm gonna have to ask him what the recipe is so young and so wise so prudent and he's got such a great vision and that we admire and appreciate them more than gold do you have a pastor that stands on the word of god he stands in the breach for the people there is the best thing that they can be here [Applause] and we give thanks to god for that [Applause] in the times of darkness i would like to greet many of our friends that we see here brother jimmy god bless you brother diego brother brother it is a pleasure to be able to greet each and every one emilio perez brother emilio perez to be able to stand before the bride of the lord jesus christ waking up to reality with a subtitle how can i overcome this waking to reality we have to wake up to reality and i would like to read another scripture says yes in ephesians chapter 6 verse 10. put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil where we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand firm stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith where ye wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked [Music] here it's giving us the armor of god and it says that we wrestle we fight the armor that the scriptures are giving us there's something special about them because when we speak about the armor of god automatically we think that we are going to attack pero it speaks more about about armor up for defense instead of to attack all this is to protect us to be able to have a defense system where he gives us to attack is the sword la spada the sword that's what he gives us for attack to attack what is the purpose how can there be trials in reality it's strange in this day and age of abundance and opportunity when there is so much and so much to obtain with all these inventions that make things easier for us so many things to give us pleasure llamos we see these mental illnesses coming upon the people millions and millions of people are taking pills to be able to sleep at night and to wake up when they wake up in the morning they they take pills to give them more strength they are they are running to the doctors they are running to the mental institutes and there and with alcohol they they try to calm these things but they have less confidence in this day and age they talk about knowledge and and knowledge and science but they are losing the battle because the the the spirit and the soul of the of the humans came cannot comprehend these changes that are coming upon the earth and one generation we have advanced from the horse hastal esposito the horse and buggy to space that is crying now in torment and we can call this the date of the neurotics this age can be called the age of the narrative that is the age that we're in that is the age that we are fighting that is the time that we we how are we going to cristiano as christians to be able to overcome that day and age we live in the bible tells but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god many times the devil comes and he wants to to change that he knows and he tells us shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god that's not with the scriptures every word that comes out of the mouth of god now we have to go and see what is and he is expressing his message there is not a man speaking speaking directly to us and he is now that we see that the mouth of god is a prophet proverbial proverbs 2 6 says because god gives wisdom and through his by his mouth through by his mouth by now this uh this word knowledge the puerto rico according to the dictionary significa conscience it means conscience or sense of reality what does it awakens he was over there was like he was doing the incorrect word when he got to the lowest part of his life the angel lord went to go look for him to see where he was so i'll in the middle of all this mental sickness in the middle of all this spiritual sickness and he awakened us to reality who we really are it doesn't matter the condition but i know i know who he is and the message is jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever cuatro preached in 1954. the faith of the weakest poorest person in here tonight will bring jesus christ on the scene [Music] the faith of the weakest person will bring jesus on the scene because he is the savior those who are oppressed he is still we're searching for the loss he is the same thing as yesterday he has the same it don't change and the prophet says let me tell you elijah and his nerves on the edge on the edge anyhow i always felt sorry for him always felt sorry for him his now and that great pound from jezebel finished the stroke the then he run and went into the wilderness and laid under the juniper tree oh that experience of the juniper tree muchos there is many of us find ourselves under the juniper tree yo mismo muchas versus he's here and it begins to describe us something you know people under the juniper tree is like elijah les gusta mucho they like to sleep i preach to more tired people than anybody in the world people's so tired until they're filling the insane institutes and the hospitals everywhere they went in such a nervous condition until they don't know what they do believe and what they don't no sorry they don't even know what they believe we are always in a hurry from one place to another always nervous always stressed that we did listen here my brother you can't drink it off and you can't shout it off neither can you play cards till it's dull and you could take a thousand siestas siestas all of our little remedies only thing it does is help the symptoms you've got to have a cure for the disease all the psychiatrists in the world cannot cure it it only helps the symptoms in the blood of jesus christ of the blood of jesus christ jesus why the blood of jesus christ the sickness leaders fear to the devil [Applause] to be able to understand how we can overcome in this day tengo olvio i have hate tengo rencor i have a bitterness i cannot see this person in the face because he did this and this to me [Music] i and this we have to make this personal man the prophet says now let us go another step but before we do let us review our case thus far first of all we we know most assuredly that the purpose of god stands an election a purpose it was purpose in himself it was god's purpose the foundation of the world she was for known for mother and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth for the foundation if i cannot be lost i'm going to do whatever we have to understand who we are revelation the revelation spiritual spiritual revelation spiritual revelation doesn't come from what you see outside when jesus who do you say i am when that happened only one responded you are the christ the son of the living god you are the christ the son of the living god and when he understood that there comes a blessing and he said blessed are thou simon shall not prevail against them when peter tells jesus you are the christ the son of the living god it was by revelation and the prophet said on earth here on the [Applause] when jesus curses the fig tree so many people cite the scripture and they say that whosoever shall say unto this mountain many times that's the way the scripture is told to us but the scripture doesn't say exactly like that what the scripture says that whenever you would say those things which he had said in other words many times we can believe what the brother says we can believe what the pastor says [Music] [Music] who i really am the kind of dog you're gonna have to put in your yard oh but if you live in a good neighborhood you can put a little chihuahua we have to understand that we have to understand the date and the age we live in in this age that we live in and the prophet begins to clear uh to clear out these statements because him in the same manner of jesus christ comes and begins to clear out those forces and he says there is two powers god enabled god and satan and the prophet says and how the message how can i overcome political centrist preached in 1963. he says jesus told us how to do it elven he overcame even and to overcome significa means support you'll be able to stand the test significa stand the test in other words god how tremendous god we have almost stopped him everything is fine everything is perfect but when everything begins to get hard that is where [Music] you say father lord this trial that i have mentored it's hard but you said in your words these promises selective elective elective elective but he loves his bride so much he comes and gives her a test he gives her a trial purchase because you can just give them a taste of the suffering of jesus he saved it for the last time for his bride so she can struggle tell you if you are under attack of the enemy if the enemy has uh made you sick maybe you weren't depression and anxiety you have problems in your life if you are supporting the test standing the test you are an overcomer the the the storm is still still there the storm is still there like torment there is emotional storms spiritual storms a familiarized story financial storms you cannot see where it goes in phoenix one time there in phoenix there was light all over i didn't know where to go i didn't know where i was driving on the road i couldn't see nothing nothing and that's what happens when we're in the storm emotional there is a voice they have the both of them there to make the decision and the winner raise his hand that's why the devil doesn't want you to raise your hand he doesn't like you to worship god you're the trial raise your hand we have overcomers [Applause] you know one of the main reasons why there is depression amongst the youth the social media facebook facebook instagram instagram and all these other ones because if you try to compare themselves what they say so the majority of those things are false if they see a young person felicia and they say oh look at that family how happy nobody the hospital because when you begin enter the celestial there was nobody worthy to look upon the book you get to cry we get to cry because we know we are not worthy many [Applause] [Music] a book that was opened it was the book of redemption and that changed god [Applause] don't and when he went to the and the prophet says out and he hits himself he wants to come out of the devil and he brings something he brings up what he did all the times that he failed he wants to come power over my nada there is nothing i can keep you in that cage there is only one person sorry you know who that person is elisha when afflictions got you in the corner don't give up consult the lord about it and see what he'd have to say see maybe you would say well i am a drunkard let's consult the lord about it and see what he'd have to say about it he said we're norman of random he says okay brother branham i have been i've tried to be uh i've tried for six years to be born again of the spirit of god spiritual son to receive the holy spirit he's never yet come to me well let's try again tonight [Applause] if you'll just get everything out of the way the cage of depression the la crolla the the cage of nervousness the cage of bitterness the cage of anxiety what hinders you of the cage of sickness if there is someone necessary that is the holy spirit the prophet says he is here follow foreign the restoration of my family is for me that's what i mean it's for me for me he paid the price for me he died on the cross for me the human being he became [Music] [Music] give you the holy spirit but unless you send it out we give you your healing you bring something new to your life [Music] the mouth of god has told us [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in the name of the lord oh it reaches to the high yes mountain oh and it flows [Music] from [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] is [Applause] [Music] and it dries all all my tears and all the blood that gives me strength [Music] [Applause] is [Music] and all

word of god so much tonight [Applause] wow what a presence of the lord tonight there is nothing like the presence of the lord you got to give the lord jesus one more give your neighbor a high five something like that amen wow thank you brother brothers wow thank you brother brother carlos and thank you brother this morning what a blessing they were to us and are to us this today amen we're we're going to do another engagement all right all right brother brother brother brother gabe gabriel and sister marty come on up [Applause] hello doc hello brother gabriel i won't make this too difficult on you guys i actually took it easy on the brother and sister this morning because i i i did i did because i i don't know brother marcos very well but we but we will but i know brother gabe real well and and sister muddy and they're they're they're quite the couple you you guys decided you were going to take the round about way to do this but it finally came came around so we're grateful to god for that amen first corinthians the 13th chapter it tells us charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity love never faileth so we are grateful to to the lord for that the prophet of god says says this now keep those things in mind the church must believe every word every promise every iota and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it if i was engaged to a girl and i was a single man and i sent her something an engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it then that shows that she doesn't believe me she she she doesn't want to be my bride and if christ sends his church the gifts that he promised and they refused them and say they're not soul they don't want to be the bride of christ they are espoused to some other lover and not to christ the bridegroom so the real church keeps the promise and keeps all and accepts the gifts that god sends them all right so we're thankful to the message of the hour and thankful for what god has done for us in our day so we're going to get down to the nitty gritty you see this one this is serious but she's you finally found her right all right all right well the easier you are with me the easier i'll be with you and you finally found him and when we he asked you he said good so this will this will take both of you off the market so you don't look at nobody else you don't look to nobody else you only look yeah you look to her right all right so we're we're squared with that but after you put this ring on her doesn't mean that there's any no hanky-panky no nothing right okay so you're gonna this is this is what god wants us to do because church we don't date that's right we court we don't date and this is the way that we do it in the house of god other people will do it the way they want to do it this is the way christians do it amen so beautiful ring beautiful girl and some guy guys remember god is number one in your lives and that's how you'll be to each other so let us by our heads lord and heavenly father we're grateful to be here tonight lord with assuredness in our hearts that he that started a good work in us will
