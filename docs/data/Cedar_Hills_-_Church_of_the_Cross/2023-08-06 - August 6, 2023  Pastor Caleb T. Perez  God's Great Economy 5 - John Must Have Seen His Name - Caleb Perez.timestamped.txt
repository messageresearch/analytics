[13:44] [Applause]
[14:20] and I believe that this 70 weeks of
[14:23] Daniel will bring it to our
[14:25] understanding
[14:27] now there was Daniel was concerned about
[14:31] his people because he had read Jeremiah
[14:33] the prophet
[14:35] and understood
[14:37] that Jeremiah had said that they would
[14:41] be
[14:42] in captivity for 70 years
[14:46] and then he seen men they'd already been
[14:50] in captivity for 68 years
[14:53] so he knew the time was at hand
[14:57] so he set aside all of his work
[15:00] hold out as it was the shades of all
[15:02] these daily tasks
[15:04] that he spaced the God put on sackcalls
[15:07] and Ashes and went to fasting and
[15:09] praying that he might understand when
[15:13] that time would be amen then we find
[15:17] as I have stated before now
[15:20] now let's outline Daniel 70 of weeks
[15:25] now I might repeat here again Ministers
[15:28] of the Gospel
[15:30] you disagree with this all right
[15:34] they are divided in three periods as we
[15:37] find out in Daniel 9.
[15:40] three periods first a seven week period
[15:44] then a three score and two which is 62
[15:47] and then a one week period
[15:51] they're divided in three different
[15:53] periods
[15:55] now we know about all the Gospels that
[15:59] Paul called
[16:00] and the others that God will return
[16:03] again to the Jew
[16:06] well then if he's going to return again
[16:08] to the Jew how can we apply it back in
[16:11] Daniel's time
[16:12] we've got to apply it in this last age
[16:15] and it's after the Gentile church has
[16:18] been gone
[16:18] [Music]
[16:20] because he deals with Israel as a nation
[16:24] we as an individual
[16:26] now I've got some variety here that I'd
[16:29] like to read to you as we go by now the
[16:32] going forth of the Commandment to reveal
[16:35] Jerusalem
[16:37] which was on the 14th day of March if
[16:41] any of you want to put that down in the
[16:42] Hebrew your final call
[16:44] n-i-s-a-n Dyson which means March
[16:48] the issue was given on the 14th day of
[16:51] March BC 445.
[16:56] the issue went forth the bills revealed
[16:59] the temple you understand it as you
[17:01] people have read the scriptures
[17:04] until it was completed it taken 49 years
[17:11] to complete the temple and the city to
[17:15] rebuild it and as the Bible said you're
[17:17] Daniel speaking or the angel too Daniel
[17:21] that the walls that it would be building
[17:24] Troublesome times many of us remember
[17:26] when there was filthy had a mortar Block
[17:29] in one hand and a sword in the other
[17:31] to watch the enemy and it would be built
[17:34] in Troublesome times so here is where I
[17:38] find that
[17:40] that's getting my days
[17:42] now we got two three different calendars
[17:45] we go back to the old astronomy calendar
[17:48] and we find out that in the Julian
[17:51] calendar there is
[17:54] 365 and one fourth day in a year they
[17:57] time that for the passing of stars
[18:00] the different stars and so forth they
[18:02] time
[18:04] now we find in the Roman Calendar that
[18:07] we live under now
[18:09] 365 days in a year
[18:12] by the calendar
[18:14] but in the Christian or prophetic
[18:16] calendar we find there's only 360 days
[18:19] in a year
[18:22] this last days is when gonna reveal
[18:25] these secrets to the church he hasn't
[18:27] done it before and the reason he hasn't
[18:29] done it is to keep the Church of
[18:30] watching and praying all the time and
[18:32] not knowing when it was coming but
[18:34] remember in Daniel 12 he said the wire
[18:36] shall understand in the last day
[18:39] it's been given to him
[18:42] the spirit of wisdom comes into the
[18:44] church to make no one to the church by
[18:47] the revelation of the Holy Ghost
[18:49] bring in the church in and revealing
[18:51] what data we're living in just the same
[18:54] as Gabriel come to to Daniel the Holy
[18:57] Spirit comes to the church in the last
[18:58] days to reveal these great secret things
[19:03] do you understand now
[19:04] we have 30 days in some months 30 ones
[19:07] the next 28 and some see we're all
[19:09] messed up
[19:10] but God don't have it back and forth he
[19:14] hits an exactly the same
[19:16] yes sir exclusive 30 days in a month not
[19:21] 31 then 30 something else now
[19:24] if there was seven look
[19:27] there's exactly 49 days
[19:29] 49 years brother in the time of the
[19:31] building of the temple the seven are
[19:34] seven prophetic weeks
[19:37] seven weeks closer seven weeks
[19:39] determined to the temple to rebuild the
[19:41] Temple so what do we get what do we get
[19:45] or if seven weeks means 49 years and one
[19:50] week equals seven years and seven times
[19:52] seven Forty Nine amen
[19:55] exactly
[19:56] there you are so now there's no more
[19:59] guessing about it
[20:00] we know now that each week mid seven
[20:04] years
[20:05] now we are told from the going forth of
[20:09] the Commandment
[20:13] now we are told from the going forth of
[20:15] the Commandment to reveal the city to
[20:18] Messiah and Messiah was Christ of course
[20:21] shall be seven weeks and three score and
[20:26] two weeks
[20:27] making 69 weeks
[20:30] see all right and seven times 69 makes
[20:36] 483 years
[20:39] are you getting it down if you want me
[20:40] to run over it again I'll be glad to do
[20:42] it
[20:43] now from the going forth of the
[20:45] Commandment to rebuild Jerusalem was
[20:47] determine seven weeks which means 49
[20:49] years and 49 years hit it exactly well
[20:52] from the refilling on the table to the
[20:54] Messiah was 438 years old 400 and
[20:59] 434 years and 434 times 49 makes exactly
[21:05] 483 years it hit it on the nose exactly
[21:08] [Music]
[21:12] there you are
[21:14] now we come down to we are positive sure
[21:17] that coming through the the Jewish stage
[21:19] we got them 69 weeks at exactly about
[21:22] history by the calendar by God's
[21:24] prophetic here bringing the history of
[21:26] the prophetic calendar from the Old
[21:28] Testament over to the new and shown it's
[21:30] exactly the same
[21:32] where will that set this week begins
[21:34] exactly after this church is cut off
[21:38] then God returns to the Jews
[21:40] I remember when to juice was returning
[21:42] back to them Jews down in the other
[21:44] nations and the look magazine give the
[21:46] article of it I read it clippy from some
[21:49] paper some religious magazine
[21:52] then one day of them planes going down
[21:55] there to pick up these shoes way down in
[21:57] Iran it's an optical World they were to
[21:59] scattered down now that's a true Jews
[22:02] salmon ever had an opportunity
[22:05] ah brother there's your 144 thousand
[22:08] when we get to Revelation 7 you'll see
[22:10] it he said there's 12 times again 12
[22:13] times the base you're 12 Tribes of
[22:14] Reuben 12 times and where were they all
[22:16] standing on Mount Sinai
[22:19] Jews back in the Homeland there they
[22:21] were
[22:22] they were the ones that wasn't this Wall
[22:24] Street crooked bunch
[22:26] Noster it was the real Jews and when
[22:29] this old Rabbi stood out there and seen
[22:31] this plane land them Jews you read in
[22:33] the magazine they were still piled
[22:34] wooden clouds
[22:36] now when they seen that thing sitting
[22:38] out there they were born
[22:40] little rabbis stood out there instead of
[22:42] our conferences and
[22:43] when we go back to our homeland we'll be
[22:46] carried back on the wings of an eagle
[22:51] it's time that God's gonna allow those
[22:52] Jews to start dealing with them again I
[22:55] cannot test it I don't know nobody knows
[22:57] that but listen if Israel is already in
[23:01] her Homeland already all the Rocks is
[23:03] picked up the irrigation the waters and
[23:05] everything that God promised they found
[23:07] Wells and things are big overstreams
[23:09] that's the most beautiful place you ever
[23:10] seen
[23:12] they got a City built there
[23:14] they got irrigation they got the best
[23:16] Land There is the world there and we
[23:18] find out about the Dead Sea there's more
[23:20] chemicals enough to buy the world
[23:22] see
[23:24] now and in the middle of the week the
[23:28] middle of this Jewish week see that's
[23:31] three and a half years
[23:34] the Antichrist the prince of Prince that
[23:38] is the cow and remember he comes out of
[23:40] Rome
[23:42] the prince that is to come what is he a
[23:45] pulse
[23:47] this Beast this Prince
[23:50] that shall scatter the power of the Holy
[23:53] people what will they do he'll break his
[23:55] Covenant with them after three and a
[23:57] half years you'll oust them
[24:00] how people think that's common isn't it
[24:02] that just calls you the spirit of God
[24:04] has dealt with you it's not communism
[24:07] it's religion
[24:10] the Bible said it'd be so closer to see
[24:12] the very elected
[24:14] so he were in the lake now these two
[24:17] prophets what will they do it's Moses
[24:19] and Elijah
[24:21] amen so rise on the scene
[24:24] they'll tell those user mistakes and out
[24:27] of that Jewish box is there now to be
[24:29] the 144 000 God will call for these
[24:33] Prophets
[24:34] what is it the spirit of Elijah of this
[24:37] Gentile church will just continue right
[24:39] on into that future
[24:42] call Moses with him gender
[24:44] Hallelujah
[24:47] you see it
[24:48] and he'll preach the same message of
[24:51] Pentecostal those Jews that they
[24:53] rejection the Messiah
[24:56] amen
[24:58] you see it but remember that's over in
[25:01] the 70s weekend the churches in glory
[25:04] amen the wedding supper's going on
[25:10] [Music]
[25:15] Pentecostal Prophets
[25:17] sir the spikes here now
[25:20] Jewish
[25:22] and romanism
[25:24] that is the sleeping virgin shall
[25:27] consolidate themselves together in the
[25:29] form of the Federation churches
[25:31] and it will be like Jesus said in
[25:34] Matthew 24 and from Revelations 13 14.
[25:38] thank you
[25:40] now if we know beyond any Shadow about
[25:42] who that Beast was that power that had
[25:44] the deadly wound that didn't live it was
[25:47] when Pagan Rome was killed in papyrone
[25:49] took its place when Pagan power was
[25:51] killed in Tampa power took its place
[25:53] there's not even a width
[25:55] of a knife blade between the end of this
[26:00] age and the coming of Christ
[26:03] everything there's nothing else left is
[26:06] Israel in her Homeland do you see what

[52:47] he said
[52:49] are you all really here
[52:56] to to we were just as happy to be there
[53:00] with them
[53:02] and of course they said to greet each
[53:05] and every one of you
[53:07] and he said especially brother Henry and
[53:10] sister Moana
[53:12] they've been through here a few quite a
[53:14] few times and they've always it's the
[53:16] time to stop with us and we appreciate
[53:19] that is
[53:21] also able to be there with with a
[53:25] co-family La Familia
[53:28] brother Jerry Cole senior senor
[53:34] it was good to see the family meet some
[53:36] of the people I had never heard about
[53:38] but I had never seen before
[53:42] may God continue to bless them and
[53:45] sister Ramona and and the family
[53:49] amen we we uh
[53:52] we were able to to uh
[53:55] maybe see it just for a moment
[53:59] but we were able to uh on on Wednesday
[54:02] El mercolis we were able to have a zoom
[54:05] conference with with the with some
[54:08] pastors the pastors there in Uganda
[54:14] Uganda grateful to the Tommy brother
[54:16] Jimmy and brother Abraham who were here
[54:21] it's not a wonderful time just a
[54:24] wonderful time in speaking about the
[54:25] Lord
[54:27] message and
[54:45] we then went into a few more different
[54:48] subjects but but I want to read to you
[54:51] just excerpt of of one of the texts that
[54:54] one of the pastors wrote
[54:58] says I'm here to say thanks
[55:01] for the mentorship that you all are
[55:03] giving us
[55:06] the fact is that I'm not only a pastor
[55:10] but also a a Bible teacher at University
[55:12] level by qualification
[55:18] but I've realized that I have a lot more
[55:20] to learn from you all
[55:23] the better fact is that I have realized
[55:27] that I don't know the Bible as I thought
[55:29] yeah
[55:32] meaning that I have been giving God's
[55:35] people a poisoned gospel significance
[55:40] I only request if possible to continue
[55:43] to attend these Bible study classes
[55:49] so that I can learn more I can help
[55:52] change the flock
[55:55] and I pray for a blessing to all God's
[55:58] people
[56:00] who have sold a seed in this kind of
[56:03] ministry
[56:04] the good lord always stays succeeded
[56:07] here
[56:12] very grateful to God
[56:14] or his word is just as alive today
[56:19] would you stand now as as we read the
[56:22] word
[56:25] this will be God's Great economy number
[56:27] five
[56:35] and I want to put a subtitle to this
[56:37] John must have seen his
[56:44] can I can I get you to repeat that after
[56:47] me
[56:48] John must have seen his name
[56:52] what a thing it is my question to you is
[56:55] how many of you have seen your name
[56:59] all right
[57:02] good it's a good question
[57:04] all right well let's get into it God
[57:08] bless the visitors that are here
[57:14] and I saw Mr Chelsea back there
[57:16] somewhere didn't I
[57:18] God bless you Sister good to have you
[57:21] here back home
[57:24] amen let's turn in our bibles if we
[57:26] would to the book of Saint Luke the 10th
[57:28] chapter and the 20th verse Lucas
[57:41] I don't know why I'm so dry this morning
[57:43] but
[57:45] Lord help us
[57:49] and it reads like this when you have you
[57:50] can say Amen
[58:04] let's start with verse 19.
[58:07] hold I give unto you power to tread on
[58:10] serpents and scorpions
[58:13] and over all the power of the enemy and
[58:17] nothing shall by any means hurt you yeah
[58:28] now we know the back story of this is
[58:31] that the disciples come and they're
[58:33] excited right
[58:36] they returned to the Lord and say even
[58:38] the devils are subject unto us
[58:44] excited
[58:47] you pray for somebody and they get
[58:49] healed and you're like wow
[58:52] the only problem is sometimes then we
[58:54] pray for someone else and then if we
[58:56] don't see the same results and we're
[58:57] like what happened
[59:02] so here they come and this is what Jesus
[59:05] is saying but but right away the Lord he
[59:08] turns their attention to something far
[59:11] greater and he says in verse 20.
[59:13] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not
[59:17] that the spirits are subject unto you
[59:20] but rather Rejoice because your names
[59:23] are written in heaven
[59:29] is
[59:39] but brother Abraham was speaking about
[59:41] last Sunday right
[59:43] our names written in the stars
[59:47] because your names are written in heaven
[59:49] that's what we should Rejoice about the
[59:51] answer is I want to know how many of you
[59:54] have rejoiced about that
[59:58] the disciples maybe didn't fully
[1:00:00] understand at the time what Jesus was
[1:00:02] saying
[1:00:05] they knew it was something to be happy
[1:00:07] about
[1:00:09] but there was something about the name
[1:00:12] or the word Rejoice that that they
[1:00:14] didn't quite get
[1:00:18] ourselves watch verse 21 now
[1:00:21] in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit
[1:00:47] for years and years and centuries
[1:00:52] and he says he rejoiced in spirit and
[1:00:55] said I thank thee O Father Lord of
[1:00:58] Heaven and Earth that's thou has hid
[1:01:01] these things from the wise and prudent
[1:01:03] and has revealed them unto babes even so
[1:01:07] father for so it seemed good in thy
[1:01:10] sight
[1:01:13] yes
[1:01:21] amen may God add His blessings to the
[1:01:24] reading of his word and you may be
[1:01:25] seated
[1:01:30] what would change in your life
[1:01:34] if you knew beyond a shadow of a shadow
[1:01:37] of a shadow of a doubt
[1:02:26] but
[1:02:38] when we understand what Jesus was really
[1:03:19] he said because our names were not
[1:03:22] written the the day we were baptized
[1:03:27] the name names were written before the
[1:03:30] foundation of the world
[1:03:34] you only recognize that your name was
[1:03:37] there that day
[1:03:40] that's what we want to know today he is
[1:03:43] looking I don't know how many of you
[1:03:44] would want to know that
[1:03:46] and be able to can you imagine the life
[1:03:49] we could live
[1:03:53] a doubt that our names are there
[1:03:58] imagine the worship that that we would
[1:04:00] we would put forth when we came to
[1:04:02] church
[1:04:05] the worship we could display at work or
[1:04:09] at school or everywhere we were at when
[1:04:12] Los trabajos
[1:04:14] imagine the kind people we would be
[1:04:19] knew for sure that our names were
[1:04:22] written there
[1:04:26] is
[1:04:28] but he didn't see it when Jesus said
[1:04:31] your name is written in heaven
[1:04:35] years later till John saw his name
[1:04:41] want to get ahead of ourselves but
[1:04:43] that's where we're going
[1:04:46] senior name written
[1:04:48] somewhere can be so satisfying
[1:04:54] if it's a good thing foreign
[1:05:00] not always a good thing to see your name
[1:05:03] it can be terrifying if
[1:05:07] it's for something that's not good well
[1:05:09] yes
[1:05:11] in life there are so many so many times
[1:05:15] that we have had to look on
[1:05:17] some sort of a list to find our name is
[1:05:25] looking at a list for your name is
[1:05:30] remember in elementary
[1:05:33] that was when
[1:05:36] snakes were still standing upright
[1:05:47] I remember that was that was a few years
[1:05:49] back
[1:05:51] and we would go to school and and of
[1:05:54] course we had in our mind which teacher
[1:05:55] we wanted right
[1:05:58] first thing we would do they would have
[1:06:00] a list at the entrance of the class
[1:06:03] everybody who is going to be with this
[1:06:06] teacher
[1:06:07] Maestro and we'll go right away to the
[1:06:09] class that we wanted to go
[1:06:12] we're looking um
[1:06:16] what a bummer go to the other one
[1:06:20] yeah there I am yeah
[1:06:24] then we wouldn't and after we would look
[1:06:27] at look for our name is
[1:06:29] then we try to console ourselves
[1:06:32] let's see who else is with me
[1:06:37] okay friends
[1:06:45] we're always looking for names right
[1:06:47] and we go through life looking or our
[1:06:50] name
[1:06:53] you see our names are attached to so
[1:06:56] many things in life
[1:06:59] so many things both good and bad
[1:07:03] that's the hard thing yes
[1:07:09] Maybe
[1:07:11] our name is attached to a church
[1:07:15] think about that right
[1:07:17] there are people in a denominational
[1:07:20] realm but you have to sign your name on
[1:07:22] the book
[1:07:24] and you are part of that church
[1:07:27] oh that church oh yeah I go to that
[1:07:29] church your name is
[1:07:32] maybe your name is attached to a high
[1:07:34] school diploma or a college degree
[1:07:39] it's good it shows some accomplishments
[1:07:42] right okay
[1:07:44] maybe your name is attached to a
[1:07:46] business license the business that you
[1:07:48] opened up
[1:07:51] or maybe to a driver's license uh
[1:07:55] or a marriage certificate
[1:08:00] even your children's birth certificate
[1:08:04] your name is attached to a lot of things
[1:08:09] but then maybe your name was attached to
[1:08:12] crime that happened
[1:08:16] a court case or
[1:08:18] or an unpaid debt on Casino
[1:08:22] maybe your name is connected with a
[1:08:24] family that didn't have a good
[1:08:26] reputation
[1:08:29] maybe your name is not worth much
[1:08:31] because of your past okay
[1:08:35] and sometimes things in our name that
[1:08:38] our names are attached to because
[1:08:43] and yet there are things or places or
[1:08:46] sites
[1:08:47] that we shouldn't have been to yeah
[1:08:51] that we did it to ourselves
[1:08:56] hello everybody hola
[1:08:59] that's why I was singing the song Jesus
[1:09:01] name
[1:09:03] thank God for the name of Jesus
[1:09:07] so do you know that every place and
[1:09:10] everything and everyone your name has
[1:09:11] been attached to and this is
[1:09:16] every website social
[1:09:20] oh you better not go there right away
[1:09:24] and we say
[1:09:26] you know
[1:09:28] I erased my name though I hated it
[1:09:33] but one thing that you cannot delete on
[1:09:36] your own
[1:09:38] is that the recording Angel has recorded
[1:09:41] it off
[1:09:43] and he knows every place and everything
[1:09:47] and every person that your name is
[1:09:55] are you okay everybody okay
[1:09:59] trying to reach you here is that a good
[1:10:00] little Foundation here
[1:10:03] this is why we're not
[1:10:05] why we're not sure many times
[1:10:09] whether we're saved or not
[1:10:13] this is why we're not sure whether our
[1:10:16] name is there on that book or not
[1:10:20] because of all the things we know our
[1:10:24] name is
[1:10:32] this is why
[1:10:37] our names are attached to many things
[1:10:39] that we are not proud of
[1:10:42] muchas
[1:10:45] but there is as I said one name
[1:10:53] that is the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:10:55] Christ
[1:10:57] that's why Jesus said notwithstanding in
[1:11:00] this Rejoice
[1:11:03] not because the the spirits that they're
[1:11:06] subject to you
[1:11:08] but can you voice because your names are
[1:11:10] written in heaven
[1:11:12] is
[1:11:14] the love that would be shared by Jesus
[1:11:17] Christ
[1:11:19] the only thing that can erase or remove
[1:11:22] your name
[1:11:25] from all the things sin all the things
[1:11:28] that are of this world
[1:11:32] it's the only thing that could erase
[1:11:34] your name is the blood of Jesus
[1:11:37] things that we said things that we have
[1:11:40] done things that we have thought
[1:11:42] the recording Angel has recorded
[1:11:51] and that's why Jesus said Rejoice
[1:11:54] because your names are written in heaven
[1:11:59] now the only way that you can truly
[1:12:02] rejoice
[1:12:12] is that right amen I'm gonna say it
[1:12:14] again you have to see it written
[1:12:16] I mean yeah it's good if somebody says
[1:12:19] believe your name's there brother buddy
[1:12:23] believe your name's there I believe you
[1:12:25] my name's there I believe your name's
[1:12:27] there
[1:12:29] we say Amen to that
[1:12:32] and he can rejoice
[1:12:34] and say yes
[1:12:39] but the level of rejoicing
[1:12:44] would be so much greater
[1:12:47] when he sees his name
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:56] I'm feeling good right now
[1:12:59] once again when you see your name
[1:13:04] the rejoicing is so much greater
[1:13:07] we're going to get into why I'm saying
[1:13:09] these things
[1:13:11] I don't believe that that these
[1:13:13] disciples rejoiced
[1:13:16] on the level that Jesus rejoices
[1:13:21] because your names are written
[1:13:25] verses Jesus then rejoiced in spirit
[1:13:32] happy hourly
[1:13:38] you don't know what it is to really
[1:13:40] Rejoice
[1:13:43] finally see your name is
[1:13:53] just rejoice in your flesh
[1:13:59] knowing that your name was put on that
[1:14:02] book
[1:14:04] before the foundation of the world was
[1:14:07] ever laid
[1:14:10] and so it is with us yes yes because our
[1:14:14] minds are constantly telling us that
[1:14:17] we're not good enough
[1:14:21] how many people are truthful here
[1:14:25] at one point or another has your mind
[1:14:27] says you're not good enough
[1:14:32] I'm going to raise both of my hands
[1:14:34] Manos I could raise my feet I'd raised
[1:14:38] minds are always telling us you're not
[1:14:42] good enough
[1:14:46] it's impossible for your name to be
[1:14:48] there
[1:14:49] yeah we have to deal with these kind of
[1:14:52] things
[1:14:55] but I can see John meditating about this
[1:14:58] about that statement
[1:15:02] John begins to think about it my name
[1:15:05] written
[1:15:07] so John would do something that no other
[1:15:10] person no other disciple would do
[1:15:14] what was it
[1:15:18] yes he would lay on the bosom of Jesus
[1:15:23] Jesus and he could hear the heart
[1:15:33] Jesus was the very Heart Of God Jesus
[1:15:36] he could hear that heartbeat
[1:15:40] and that never would leave him
[1:15:43] watch why I'm saying this now
[1:15:45] he meditated Rejoice because my name is
[1:15:49] there my name's written I believe it is
[1:15:56] I I went to look at for the word reason
[1:16:00] and the word is is Cairo
[1:16:04] and the word means to be cheerful
[1:16:08] it's a source of pleasure or happiness
[1:16:12] but this is where I'm going today
[1:16:16] it also means
[1:16:19] a salutation
[1:16:22] on meeting
[1:16:24] Godspeed
[1:16:30] foreign
[1:17:16] [Applause]
[1:17:30] when's the last time you walked into a
[1:17:32] room and people got excited
[1:17:35] into a room and somebody was rejoicing
[1:17:38] yeah
[1:17:42] they come
[1:17:46] is the truth is I love it that yeah
[1:17:52] see what she's wearing okay
[1:17:58] that's not rejoicing
[1:18:01] a Son of God
[1:18:04] also wants his brother and sister to be
[1:18:08] on that list
[1:18:10] that's why it wasn't just finding my
[1:18:13] name is
[1:18:20] I want every one of you to make it okay
[1:18:23] I'm gonna be there without any one of
[1:18:25] you
[1:18:26] that's why we struggle and we preach and
[1:18:29] we cry and we do all that
[1:18:31] you do what to bring you in
[1:18:34] I don't want to be in heaven without any
[1:18:39] Rejoice because your names are written
[1:18:43] they're getting my thought now
[1:18:47] get beard a little bit
[1:18:49] and that's what Jesus is telling them
[1:18:52] rejoice
[1:18:57] is telling them yes men will revile you
[1:19:01] Lord
[1:19:04] men will persecute you
[1:19:05] and say all manner of evil again
[1:19:10] falsely for my sake
[1:19:15] but you're about to welcome Benida
[1:19:22] I'm going to say that again when
[1:19:24] everyone is speaking bad about
[1:19:26] because of Christ
[1:19:29] you were messing up
[1:19:32] right not because you were Orlando
[1:19:36] oh because you're talking more a little
[1:19:38] too much
[1:19:41] and when people they falsely accuse you
[1:19:45] and when people revile yeah that's
[1:19:51] the perfect time to Rejoice
[1:19:54] because you're about to say goodbye to
[1:19:57] something
[1:19:58] I'll go to something else
[1:20:01] rejoice in this house
[1:20:04] he gave them something and showed them
[1:20:07] what they were going to Rejoice about
[1:20:10] John of Patmos
[1:20:14] not just because of what who he was
[1:20:17] but he was there because of the destiny
[1:20:21] of Jesus Christ
[1:20:30] say it again sometimes we want
[1:20:33] everything to go just perfect and go
[1:20:35] good all the time
[1:20:37] welcoming anything
[1:20:40] but when you're on the idol of Batman
[1:20:44] when you have to be straight
[1:20:47] and you seem to be all alone
[1:20:49] that's the perfect time
[1:21:04] listen to this
[1:21:06] in the fourth still brother Brown says
[1:21:09] that's the reason
[1:21:11] I think John was doing a lot of shouting
[1:21:14] together
[1:21:16] oh finally but Jesus had told him
[1:21:28] about the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:21:31] coming

[1:26:08] how many of you believe your name is
[1:26:13] or do you really know that your name is
[1:26:19] this is where the enemy plays with us
[1:26:23] plays with our minds
[1:26:26] this one did this oh yes cares about all
[1:26:30] that
[1:26:34] that has nothing to do with your name
[1:26:36] being there
[1:26:39] if it was there and you knew it is
[1:26:55] Amber but it causes so much problems
[1:27:02] these names that were prepared
[1:27:05] he has them in a special place
[1:27:15] he's got him in a special place
[1:27:17] they're
[1:27:19] not with the rest of the list
[1:27:25] you'll understand in a minute
[1:27:27] so what
[1:27:29] started
[1:27:33] the hunt is
[1:27:37] the hunt
[1:27:41] for what for the names
[1:27:47] he's hunting this morning
[1:27:50] for the names that have been prepared
[1:27:52] foreign
[1:28:01] at least
[1:28:03] candle let's see what he says the
[1:28:06] message is the faith of Abraham we are
[1:28:09] called of God
[1:28:11] no man can come to me except my father
[1:28:14] draws him first
[1:28:18] then it isn't man seeking God
[1:28:23] God seeking man
[1:28:25] and then our name is on the book
[1:28:29] The Bible said since the foundation of
[1:28:34] the world
[1:28:35] and the holy spirit's here
[1:28:47] prepared names
[1:28:53] um
[1:28:53] what's the Revelation the realities
[1:29:01] there was no symbol yes
[1:29:08] they would give away the secret foreign
[1:29:17] the prepared name los nombres preparados
[1:29:21] let me ask you a question
[1:29:23] when were the names put on the Lamb's
[1:29:27] Book of Life cuando foreign
[1:30:05] but in a message called the mark of the
[1:30:08] beast
[1:30:12] yeah brother Brown says this is
[1:30:15] and when you're born again
[1:30:19] your name is put on the Lamb's Book of
[1:30:22] Life
[1:30:32] we're in a good pickle this morning
[1:30:35] and
[1:30:37] this is where the carnal believer
[1:30:40] this is when the car where the carnal
[1:30:42] person gets stuck and says there's
[1:30:44] mistakes in the message
[1:30:48] over here before the foundation of the
[1:30:50] world and then over here says no no he
[1:30:54] says he said it's when you're born again
[1:30:56] is when your name was put on this is
[1:31:03] so do you what do we do say well I'm
[1:31:04] going to choose this one or this one

[1:31:11] in the message

[1:31:17] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:31:21] but it taken 4 000 years
[1:31:29] oh okay when was your name put on the
[1:31:33] Lamb's Book of Life

[1:39:33] but we ourselves by faith
[1:39:38] how many believe it this morning we are
[1:39:41] stopped by faith we believe it
[1:39:43] and then God himself
[1:39:47] become a man
[1:39:49] Jesus Jesus and came down the same way
[1:39:54] the lowest pits of Hell Allah
[1:39:58] picked out
[1:40:32] until we see him and within his likeness
[1:40:35] is
[1:40:39] Heavens was rolled as
[1:40:43] that was the protection is that right
[1:40:45] there when he rolled it up

[1:40:51] say yes there's a person that needs to
[1:40:54] happen
[1:40:56] that's great book and I'm going to use
[1:40:58] this example where's our local I believe
[1:41:00] it's the Bible
[1:41:03] this great book is the grand Libro was
[1:41:06] closed Revelations
[1:41:16] it was in the hand
[1:41:21] no we got to go back and we we've heard
[1:41:24] this time and time again
[1:41:26] Adam had eternal life
[1:41:29] he forfeited his rights
[1:41:32] right to save his wife
[1:41:35] and daddy life went back
[1:41:39] to the original owner in other words
[1:41:42] that life that he had
[1:41:44] to go back to the original owner or the
[1:41:47] original Giver
[1:41:54] of the original owner everybody get that
[1:41:57] it's not very needful for where we're
[1:42:00] going is
[1:42:02] in the hand of the original owner which
[1:42:04] is
[1:42:09] on your hand the lamb then goes
[1:42:14] and takes the book
[1:42:19] and transfer and it's transferred at
[1:42:22] that moment
[1:42:23] to the angel now now this is where
[1:42:27] people get confused
[1:42:32] how can Jesus be God
[1:42:35] he runs over here
[1:42:39] then he takes the book
[1:42:43] something's not right
[1:42:47] nobody ever think that am I the only one
[1:42:50] thinking that yes
[1:42:51] that he's the son of God it goes and he
[1:42:54] takes the book right
[1:42:59] this is important to understand your
[1:43:02] name is
[1:43:11] we can preach a nice little message and
[1:43:13] it's just skim milk with a little
[1:43:15] bottles
[1:43:23] this is me now
[1:43:25] see those white things coming out of
[1:43:27] your gums

[1:43:59] teeth we should yeah
[1:44:08] how many believe the lamb is Jesus
[1:44:10] Christ
[1:44:11] this is the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:44:13] the sins of the world
[1:44:16] go and take the book
[1:44:19] how is he taking it we're going to find
[1:44:22] this out now
[1:44:24] number one is
[1:44:28] where is he understand
[1:44:33] he he ascended to the office of fathers
[1:44:38] and he sends back his Spirit to the
[1:44:41] church
[1:44:42] the Bible says you receive not the
[1:44:44] spirit of the father
[1:44:46] of the sun now what he said oh power in
[1:44:51] heaven and in Earth it has been given to
[1:44:53] him
[1:44:56] when he goes back to the father
[1:45:00] he leaves the office of the sun
[1:45:02] vacancies
[1:45:05] waiting for someone
[1:45:08] aim that he has prepared
[1:45:12] a man that he can incarnate him
[1:45:17] that can go and take the book
[1:45:20] not the man it is

[1:45:32] Seven Seals no no

[1:46:00] the angel has the little book in his
[1:46:03] hand

[1:53:15] to know what's in God's mind
[1:53:17] great mysterious Mysteries that were in
[1:53:21] God's Minds
[1:53:23] oh my Lord show me your mind
[1:53:26] Lord I want to see your mind
[1:53:30] why aren't you aren't you hearing
[1:53:32] your hearings in his mind foreign
[1:54:01] I'm going to make sure that you get this
[1:54:03] today
[1:54:05] how will you know then
[1:55:03] that's where he placed it
[1:55:07] that is the body of Christ
[1:55:10] once God's Great Secret in his mind
[1:55:15] foundation of the world
[1:55:22] has materialized
[1:55:26] oh
[1:55:27] how many got that but there's no cut
[1:55:29] that on you
[1:55:31] notice what he says here
[1:55:35] it's written
[1:55:37] and then we say wait a minute
[1:55:39] it's written somewhere I thought it
[1:55:43] wasn't right
[1:55:46] oh is it rain or not
[1:55:49] this is our founding Pastor is
[1:55:54] quoting brother Branham he says
[1:55:56] one day you'll find out
[1:55:59] where it was
[1:56:04] that's a revelation that's got a chunk
[1:56:08] of meat right there
[1:56:09] better get in there and start ripping
[1:56:11] that meat up
[1:56:14] and then our pastor asked
[1:56:17] you're with me
[1:56:22] I don't know maybe that doesn't mean
[1:56:24] much to you he's asking the question is
[1:56:30] you're with me
[1:56:33] I am I see my name
[1:56:39] come on people he says don't keep saying
[1:56:42] in the resurrection we're going to know
[1:56:44] it all
[1:56:45] right everything is
[1:56:50] tomorrow
[1:56:52] but if we have resurrected spiritually
[1:56:56] it says then it happens today
[1:57:02] we're waiting for tomorrow it happens
[1:57:03] today
[1:57:06] for somebody here today
[1:57:08] one person
[1:57:11] catches the revelations
[1:57:21] it happens today
[1:57:30] as in the days of provocation
[1:57:33] tomorrow is too late if today you hear
[1:57:37] his voice oh yes what are you hearing in
[1:57:41] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:57:43] angels
[1:57:46] when he should begin to sound
[1:57:48] once again the book holds that mystery
[1:57:52] and the book is that the only unfolding
[1:57:54] it now
[1:57:55] so then when you take the book and eat
[1:57:59] all of it
[1:58:00] you begin to see the mystery material
[1:58:04] lies in your life
[1:58:07] while your name is
[1:58:17] I had never seen
[1:58:20] The Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of
[1:58:22] Life like this
[1:58:25] I tell you what it rocked my world
[1:58:30] you understand
[1:58:31] we shouldn't
[1:58:32] The Book of Life and last book of life
[1:58:35] one book or two
[1:58:38] help me out here
[1:58:45] somebody help me
[1:58:49] one
[1:58:51] there's times brother Branham says
[1:58:53] he says there's two
[1:58:56] there we go again
[1:59:06] how many books
[1:59:10] there's the Book of Genesis in here
[1:59:13] Exodus exodo Leviticus
[1:59:16] there's the Old Testament and the new
[1:59:19] testamento
[1:59:21] yes
[1:59:23] okay kind of get this picture
[1:59:27] this just rocks my world
[1:59:30] when Adam sinned
[1:59:32] that part of eternal life went from Adam
[1:59:38] where did it go I want this if we just
[1:59:40] said that it goes back to the original
[1:59:43] owner which was God
[1:59:46] now now get this good now it went back
[1:59:50] to God The Giver
[1:59:52] says or back to the Book of Life
[2:00:00] it's gonna rock your world if you're
[2:00:02] spiritual rock your world if not then
[2:00:04] you don't care about these things
[2:00:06] it went back to God The Giver
[2:00:10] it went back to the Book of Life foreign
[2:00:18] because sometimes we look at the book of
[2:00:19] life and the last book oh I I want to be
[2:00:22] the noun Book of Life
[2:00:31] watch this now we can see this is
[2:00:33] getting heavy Genesis
[2:00:49] why then would he say it went back to
[2:00:52] God the Book of Life
[2:00:58] because all life comes from God
[2:01:01] there's no life without God
[2:01:04] and His will was that nobody would
[2:01:07] perish
[2:01:09] I don't want no one to perish
[2:01:14] that he didn't create hell for us
[2:01:22] he don't want no none of us to parents
[2:01:31] watch this now it goes back on the Book
[2:01:34] of Life
[2:02:16] it went back
[2:02:21] on that side just imagine
[2:02:24] it left Adam and it goes back
[2:02:28] it was back to the original one this is
[2:02:30] a Chasm
[2:02:33] we're coming around the corner there's a
[2:02:36] Chasm here so that it could not return
[2:02:40] back over here
[2:02:42] because the blood of bulls and goats
[2:02:49] no way of getting back that what Adam
[2:02:52] had lost
[2:02:55] this is all the part of the Plan of
[2:02:58] Redemption
[2:03:00] it could not come back across the chasm
[2:03:03] foreign
[2:03:05] [Music]
[2:03:21] he's building a bridge or a bridge
[2:03:25] to connect God and man again
[2:03:29] we're coming to the end now come on now
[2:03:32] stay with me now he building a bridge
[2:03:36] that way we didn't have to stay on this
[2:03:40] side anymore
[2:03:43] we could go to the other side
[2:03:47] that's the bridge
[2:03:49] you see that's the book of life
[2:03:52] that Holy Spirit
[2:03:55] and unless Jesus left
[2:03:59] the Holy Spirit could not come back
[2:04:04] why Jesus said
[2:04:09] that comforter cannot come
[2:04:13] there's no Comfort
[2:04:15] you'll never know if your name was on
[2:04:18] there
[2:04:19] but if he went away
[2:04:32] [Applause]
[2:05:11] el padre

[2:05:16] I don't know I'm rejoicing right now

[2:05:21] just getting a little hot up here
[2:05:27] I invite you to come right now come and
[2:05:31] join in with this this with me
[2:05:33] he sees the father
[2:05:35] he sees the book The Book of Life
[2:05:43] foreign
[2:05:51] to get that book or those names
[2:05:56] and transfer them
[2:06:03] oh church church you gotta get this I'm
[2:06:07] gonna say it again

[2:06:19] confidence
[2:06:21] take this book
[2:06:24] that was on the hand of the or that was
[2:06:28] closed in the hand of the father
[2:06:30] and to flip it open you will get through
[2:06:34] the names
[2:06:35] that he was going to redeem
[2:06:39] he did not die for every name that was
[2:06:42] in the in the lamb or in the Book of
[2:06:44] Life
[2:06:46] die for all the names

[2:07:52] he has the right to get that life
[2:07:57] and transfer it to the lamb

[2:08:07] I'm gonna say that again
[2:08:10] he transfers it to the lamps
[2:08:16] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:08:20] you might say brother how can you say
[2:08:22] that this is Jesus Christ
[2:08:25] Jesus Christ
[2:08:27] but the lamb that took
[2:08:30] because it was
[2:08:35] oh now we're getting into the
[2:08:37] nitty-gritty
[2:08:39] I'm sorry I gotta put myself together
[2:08:42] here a little bit
[2:08:44] I love his word watch this now the book
[2:08:46] of life now

[2:08:51] being the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:08:55] then that become Lamb's Book of Life
[2:09:00] who is The Book of Life
[2:09:06] but now we have been transferred
[2:09:12] where is
[2:09:16] the Lamb
[2:09:21] oh come on I'm gonna say it again where
[2:09:24] is the lamb
[2:09:26] in the bride
[2:09:29] the lamb had overcome
[2:09:32] he went to the father and he says I
[2:09:35] overcame I can take it now yo yeah
[2:09:43] watch this now the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:09:47] of the name that was elected
[2:09:51] were written in that book foreign
[2:10:09] foreign
[2:10:32] Revelations 5 6. revelation
[2:10:35] I be held in low in the midst of the
[2:10:37] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[2:10:39] midst of the elders
[2:10:41] stood a
[2:10:43] immediated
[2:10:50] Jesus is not a lamb yes
[2:10:55] but the revelation of the Lamb
[2:10:58] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:11:01] and it's not just one thing
[2:11:04] it is an organism
[2:11:06] it is his body here on Earth
[2:11:10] this is now who it is
[2:11:17] as it had been slain Jesus was not as he
[2:11:22] had been slain he was slain
[2:11:24] but this lamb as it had been slain Jesus
[2:11:29] now you're seeing the complete
[2:11:31] revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:11:34] having seven
[2:11:39] it's okay
[2:11:41] the seven Church ages
[2:11:43] and seven eyes which are the seven
[2:11:47] spirits or the seven Messengers now
[2:11:51] we're not just seeing a lamb by itself
[2:11:53] I've seen everything that makes up the
[2:11:56] lamb
[2:11:57] what is the whole revelation of Jesus
[2:12:00] Christ
[2:12:06] material Rising here on Earth
[2:12:10] has been materializing
[2:12:13] and don't
[2:12:20] finishes up everything up
[2:12:23] oh my goodness my time has gone I just
[2:12:27] want to hit just a couple of more things
[2:12:29] he didn't die for the whole world
[2:12:32] died for those names that were in
[2:12:53] so he has to change Tabernacles
[2:13:00] he says to me it's easy what I mean he
[2:13:03] says fussy you have to change
[2:13:04] Tabernacles because the Tabernacle that
[2:13:07] he lived in had to die
[2:13:10] but it was different than the little
[2:13:13] lamb first Covenant
[2:13:15] because this land Jesus Christ died and
[2:13:20] had a life inside of him
[2:13:22] different from the little lamb
[2:13:24] difference
[2:13:25] could come back in another Tabernacles
[2:13:28] again

[2:14:47] a god-sent group of people um
[2:14:52] I'm going to say it again a god-sent
[2:14:54] group of people
[2:14:56] that we can be part of that group
[2:15:00] people don't get it they want to look
[2:15:03] and say oh that's the lamb Jesus Christ
[2:15:05] 2000 years ago
