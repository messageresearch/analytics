created man upon it not James James James monkey man just man monkeys we come from monkeys but how come it also says in Genesis 5:2 it says he created them m and female and he blessed them and named

Marty pants Oh What a name mighty fine so for class today one second what is this all about we will be talking about huh Bible Hallelujah I love the Bible where's your Bibles at guys in the oh great Bible Theory there you go one o Uno all right well yesterday we had James come here and tell us couple scriptures so I hope you did your homework son he always does his homework h no he he doesn't I hope he has his homework done share with us the scriptures go ahead James it to him I was thinking about what you were saying that it's uninspired but so I got Mark 16:18 here and it says uh they shall take serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them Hallelujah Glory they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover woo that's right tell them another one well you see last time I laid hands on someone they did not recover so it's very foolish son that you say something like that I don't believe it I don't believe you can lay hands and they all of a sudden they're recovering we have Evolution Evolution we have doctors we have science we have monkeys so how can you prove me wrong James tell them James tell them testify to this man all right come on boy well it was actually not too long ago I ended up tearing some tendons in my foot and I thought I broke it and I was pretty worried about it but uh I went to the doctor they said I tore some tendons on my foot couldn't walk on it for a little bit then uh one day I came to church and I got prayed for and the ministry told me he was like everything will be good is new and so I went on went back to the doctor and they did more X-rays and stuff and uh while the doctor said I was very lucky and uh we don't believe in luck but he said everything healed perfectly fine I don't need therapy I don't need a cast or nothing that everything was perfect perfect sit down yes sir what do you have to say about that Professor okay Mr Gramps let's there's this word and it's called coin ah coincidence however you spell that we believe in coincidence when the doctor tells you that you're okay and you happen to be okay that's a coincidence and then the minister prays for you and you're healed it's a coincidence that's not real boy that's where I'm going to have to draw the line there buddy which line boy in the sand buddy you have a seat I guess you see James was just brought up a good point the Bible says they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover now three weeks ago I was laying in my deathbed and I didn't let James know because I didn't want to scare him but I was very sick the doctor says I have two options I can either go home and die or stay there and die and well I said I'm not doing either of them so you know what I did I packed up my bed and I left that hospital against medical advice watch your step now and I began to walk I said you know what can't do me no good laying at home dying might as well get moving so I began to to pray to the Lord and by golly guess what I stumbled upon anybody I stumbled upon an old country church and when I walked by that church I could just hear the singing it was so beautiful and I said Lord Is this where my healings coming from and I walked in that church and they were having a prayer line and I walked up in the prayer line and the minister said what can I do for you I said well the doctor said I'm going to die with pneumonia and he says well I can pray for you so he put his hands upon me and he says do you believe Mark 16 Verse 18 and he says they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover and I said believe it and by golly if I didn't feel better that next day I don't know what else to tell you but scriptures un inspired Hallelujah did you just say what did you say I said the scripture is uninspired one more time make sure I get this right I said the scripture is on inspired glory be to God this crazy old man right if God could heal me with uninspired word what could he do with word that is inspired huh what could God do with word that is inspired so tell me Doc that same God is here today and I know you believe we came from these hairy monkeys but no God is interested in the details he knows you too doc he knows you you and you we didn't come from no monkeys God knew us from before the foundation of the world and he created us bodies we didn't come from no hairry monkey I can tell you that so you say would the god that healed you and helped my student James can heal me too and make me his son and deliver me uh I'm afraid to tell you he's already done all that he could save me he's already saved you you just got to accept it today amen do you want that GL amen glory all right now we're talking see now we're getting somewhere what I got to do all you got to do is surrender mister I Surrender Lord Jesus accept this man I don't know him but you know him Lord and you crossed our paths today and Lord I pray you receive this this Son of God back to you in the name of Jesus amen glory woo I got a no more bananas and that is how the student becomes the teacher class is now dismissed all right grams let's get out of here [Applause] [Music] grams you see James sometimes you got to stand up for what you believe in I know GRS it's just just school you know the world is always going to look at us like we're bunch of nuts bunch of weirdos but the reality is we're going to be somebody's nut yeah we'll be somebody's fool might as well be a fool for Christ what do you say uh you let me drive that there moped uh half of it missing but I mean I guess you
