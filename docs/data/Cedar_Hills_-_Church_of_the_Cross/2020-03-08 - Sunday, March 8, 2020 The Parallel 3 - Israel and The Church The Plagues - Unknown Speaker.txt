========================================

I picked up my Bible and I guess I held that Bible for 10 minutes without anybody anymore word coming I'll wait just a few minutes I heard him say again turn to Hebrews 6 and start reading and I did and it'll come down there where it said the rain come assault upon the earth to water it and prepare it dress it for witches but the thorns and thistles which is 9 to rejection whose end is to be burned and I caught it right there I thought there it is thanks be to God there it is see now jesus said a store went for storing seeds Sydney huh you're all Christian sure everyone held up their hands anyhow Pentecostals born-again Christians aren't they and he said of store wine for storing seeds and while he slept his residence team and while he slept on enemy coming so Terriers than that would heal what is Terriers wheeze rah Rose knee now and when the husbandmen the preacher saw these terrors going to let me go pull him up he's a no no you put up the wheat also let them both grow together there's a weak deal on earth there's creepers metal balls stinkweed everything else in it is that right but now in there they're sweet now the rain come off upon the earth to water it and what serene far not to water the nettle ball i watch to pay attention not the water the creeper the rain set for the week but the nettle ball and the weed is just as thirsty as the weed is and the same rain that falls on the wheat falls on the weed and the little old wheedle things are straight up like that and happy and rejoicing just as much as the little weak or stand up and stand yourself up but by their fruits you shall know them there you see now the same holy spirit can bless the hypocrite that knocks telling you Armenians out but that's the truth that's the truth then told holiness which I believe in holiness - but if the same spirit the rain falls on the just and the unjust but by their fruits you shall know them by look out you're going to get wheat get we but the weeds is all bound up and they live on the same rain that fell for the wheat and the rain was not sent far the weeds it was sent for the week but the rain being in the feet of the sweet scent weeds being in the wheat fields got just as much benefit out of the rain as the rest of a bit and the same rain that made the weak lift made that we live all things in the natural types of spiritualists we're teaching there it is demonology demons impersonating christianity yet with the blessings that's not skim milk rather than if you can take a see see it's true so I'm not saved today because I can shout I'm saved not because i feel like i'm saved i'm saved because I met God's conditions to this Bible Jesus said either heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's past and that's the life I believe that that's right now in them conditions I am saved they called God said so if you told me you're saved because somebody said a rushing mighty wind hit me in the face that's wonderful well I wanted or that rushing mighty wind comes from or hit me in the face see now what kind of a life is you go to Leah base that rushing mighty wind pitch you see see it's by your fruits your knowing so demons can work right amongst Christians you believe that look at Paul Paul said now here's where the latter-day rain if there's any of you here forgive me if I'm saying anything against you I wouldn't say the Morgan shooter with the similes or any of the Baptist or anybody else it's truth is what's truth where you got off was this you're making profits out of them man and things that's not profits profits are not laid on the hands and sent out profits are borned me in the bible there's a gift of prophecy there's where your mistake was between the gift of prophecy and a prophet the gift daughter and sundry times and divers matter spoke to the father's to the prophets in this way States through son Christ Jesus the body of Christ has nine spiritual gifts operating in it and it might be on this woman tonight prophecy may never be the rest of her life it may be on this woman the next night may be on this man the next time maybe on that one back there the next time that doesn't make her a prophet doesn't make no one a prophet it's the gift of prophecy in yin and before that man or that prophecy can be given to the church it has to be judged before two or three spiritual judges that Rider Court now Paul said you all may prophesy one by one there's something be revealed to this and let that hold his peace well that would make the whole bunch prophet saying according to the teaching of the days no Pentecostal church we've got things all scrupled up and that's reason God can't come in till we get the thing straightened out and on the Bible Ryan you got to rig up the right path I go to build a house without looking to blueprint thing you got to start right now in there a prophet you never seen anybody stand before Isaiah Moses one ditch then Korah one day and try to dispute with him and God said separate yourself we'll open up your ass and a prophet is born gifts and callings out repentance that's the foreordination of God from the baby up everything was perfectly right along exactly what he said was the truth and vindicated and brought out it's a Word of God comes to the Prophet but a gift of prophecy is in the church now you said well the prophets of the Old Testament all know the New Testament had prophets activist was a was a New Testament prophet look at the spirit of prophecy falling down and telling Paul about then here come activist down from Jerusalem and found Paul and tied up his girl around him and turned over he said thus saith the Lord a man at war this will be bound and changed when he gets to Jerusalem activist who stood up and told her foretold what would take place he was a prophet not a man with the gift of prophecy and the gift of healing and all those gifts my Pentecostal friends she got it mixed up the gifts are in the church subject to any persons in the church anybody that's baptized into the body by one spirit we're all baptized in and the Bible said well I got the gift of healing while the Bible said confess your faults one to another and pray one the other every person pray one for the other we're not a divided group we're a collective gathered guru the now and there's how demons sometimes working now watch what Paul said if one speaks with tongues and the other an interpreter and whatever it said let it be judge force for the church can receive it now won't be a quoting of Scripture something other like that God don't repeat himself but it'll be a warning to the church then if good judges says let's receive that all right I was of the Lord second one says let's receive it the mouth of two three witnesses that ever word the established then the church receive it and go make ready for it if that doesn't come to pass what that said then you got an evil spirit among you that's right if it does come to pass then thank God the Spirit of God is among you see now that's where you have to watch and be careful so don't try to press I couldn't make myself have brown eyes when I got blue see I have to be satisfied with blue eyes now there's where demons work in the realm of spiritual people now we got a deep something coming here and I hope it's not too deep now over in 1st Samuel 28 I want to read some scripture here right at this time I want you to listen closely and I don't want to bring demons show you how they work right in the church and how Satan has a counterfeit forever real there is now you can see according to the Bible that demons come among Christians and they impersonate and many times we have declared people to be Christian one day that I believe in Jesus Christ while the devil's believe the same thing and tremble that's the sign you're saved one of these nights I want to get on the election and then you'll see what salvation means see there's nothing you had to do with it in the first place or the last place are nothing you can do about it God saves the man unconditionally for that sunk deep didn't as might as well get that out of your system while we're at it alright Abraham was the beginning of our faith is that right or Abraham had the promise and God called Abraham because he was a great man I guess no sir he come down out of Babylon in the land of shall Deanna's city of era and God called him and made his covenant with him unconditionally I'm going to save you and not only you Abraham but your seed unconditionally God made a covenant with man and man breaks his covenant every time man never didn't keep his covenant with God the law was never attempt it couldn't keep the law Christ was come and broke the law himself calls grace had already provided Savior Moses providing a way of escape and then the escaped brother and then the people after that they still wanted something to do man's always trying to do something to save himself when you can't do it it's his nature as soon as he found out he was naked in the Garden of Eden he made some fig leaf aprons is that right but he found out they wouldn't work nothing a man can do can save yourself God saves you unconditionally all down to the age and then when you're saved you're saved look at Abraham there that fella once went over God give him the land of Palestine and told him not to leave there any Jews at least Palestine was back slid God told him to stay there if God tells you to do something and you don't do it then you're evacuated that right all right a drought come on the tribe or him fading and instead of Abraham staying there no he couldn't stay there he'd run off and touched Aaron one about 300 miles wish they had time to get old man down to another land and when he got down there and then he got this great King down there of emilich he was a young fellow and he was looking for a sweetheart so he found Abraham's wife Sarah and fell in love with her and Abraham said are you telling that you are my sister I'm your brother's soul that please ammok so he said all right we'll just take her over to castling I guess the women fixture up his go to marry the next day and ambach was a good man a righteous man and that night while he was asleep and the Lord appeared to him and said you're as good as a dead man he said the man's the woman that you got out there to marry is another man's wife I watch another man's wife why he said Lord you know the integrity my mark a righteous holy man you know the integrity in my heart that man told me that was his sister and didn't she tell me herself as that was my brother he said that God said I know of integrity art that's reason I kept you from sinning against me but that's my prophet how are you what was he back slid and a little wine shyster that right or doily no little white lives are either a black lives or they're not lies at all the man sitting out there telling a pine blank line saying that was his sister when it was his wife beating around the bush and back slid and there was a righteous man standing before God and said Lord you know my heart but I'll not hear your prayer emilich but take him take her back and let him play for you he's my prophet I'll hear him yes a backslider liar but that's the prophet that's rude that's survival I don't go plump too far over your Calvinistic sidewalks and grades always in grease cause you're getting discouraged see just a moment we'll get time this week to bring that up and show you how to level it is but don't think it's because you've done something wrong you're gone forever your child or God you're born the Spirit of God your sons and daughters of God and the fruits will bear record of itself there you are now here we are sitting in the land now I want to read here the six first and when Saul inquired of the Lord the Lord answered him not neither by dream are above the Urim nor by profit and then said Saul unto his servant speak native woman with a familiar spirit that I may go to her and acquire of her I could lay something to the rod right here fidgety seek me a woman with a familiar spirit any server said unto Him behold there is the woman that has a familiar spirit in indra and saul disguised himself and put on raymond other arena and he went - and two men with him and it came to the woman by night and they said I pray thee vitam to me by thy familiar spirit and bring me up whom I shall name unto thee and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest that Saul has done does know has cut off all goals that have familiar spirits and wizards out of the lane therefore Leah saw sneer for my life and caused me to die and Saul answered I swear to her by the Lord seen as the Lord liveth there shall be no punishment happen unto thee then said the woman whom shall I bring up thee and he said bring me up Samuel and when the woman saw Samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman's spacious Oh Saint why has thou deceived me for thou our soul and the King said unto her be not afraid for what sayest thou and the woman said us on to soul I stole gobs of sinning out of the earth and he said unto her what form was he off and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with the mantle and sent as a prophets mantle of course he perceived that it was Samuel and he stood with it and it his face to the ground and bowed himself and Samuel said unto Saul why has thou disquieted me and bring me up and Saul answered and said I am sore distressed because of the flesh teens make war against me and God has departed from me and answers me not neither by prophet needed by dream therefore I called unto thee that thou

important important is to go how long or to put out what the Lord has expose you and so the parallel number three but a little or no middle dressed Israel in the church with the subtitle the plagues Israeli deity - Lola Plaga and we pray that this is a benefit to you it's better kiss does that mean it will help you in this time that we live in and it's the temple give the most Romans the the verse we've been reading Romans 11:25 on say it is think of the Romano's for I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery what can all kid or Manos King know raised st Mysterio what a mystery more I look into it the more mystery as Marcel Mysterio you should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in a circus otros mismos Aragon Tezpur l en de cemento and part a a contested o in Israel hasta que entrada la plenitude of empty lists I like that word the fullness of the Gentiles be come in as the Kagan traveler Pliny to the las casillas because come in is the second part of the Exodus and when the part is helix you gotta come out here and you got to go into something feel the fullness of the Gentiles be come in ice tequila pretty to look until the second rather the exodus is not complete electrostatic on Plato I got out as blessings to the reading of his word and you may be seated great you follow me close this morning plan to eat as I believe this will be a benefit to to the body of Christ you see one cuerpo oh I want to read this same the same quote that brother that I read before Oh calientes what a great lesson okay run Lex what a great thing that we typed the natural church to the spiritual church what a grand appointive if you can't legally see are not rally God dealing with Israel in the natural the endocrine Israel in Tehran and with the church in these days he'll iglesias to see as he's calling out of the Gentile of people for his name yeah man don't Pablo Paris amis is yielding with them in the spiritual easy and Oconee Oh st. Louis PD as he dealt with them in the natural course and a parallel one to the other but a little Illinois look a man I mean now we as we as we get going in this message it doesn't give us an estimate somebody know that there there are three exodus what does having kite yes in Sunday school so I hope that you I know you've lost an hour of sleep last night well how many can say keep remember you look a little grumpy this morning I mean uh no cookie to see that not very happy this morning no muy contento you love to go to sleep or if you love to sleep silly gusta or me so if your neighbor starts to nod off you you you you be a good neighbor neighborhood stare when bastino wake up neighbor Nicholas you know inspiriting Amen no don't really do that okay yeah but there are three Exodus right there can you all help me this morning the first Exodus was to do what L primatech straight up and I said okay it's to come out of something to go into something right it is a little loop at an angle so the first Exodus yes was too take them from a natural land they were in Egypt it premiered externa per second losing that tiara natural and take them to a spiritual and I'm carried to a natural land which was the promise that the land that God had given oh yeah get it up Rometty that not too Randy man I'm in the second Exodus and still go into X somebody help me here see I'll get make you that anybody it's here nobody either again it was to take the people from a spiritual condition my way latina condiciones PT to I into the baptism of the Holy Ghost is my a man Santo I understand that he went from one covenant to another covenant where they won't back to al otro and through seven churches he brought us all the wave like I said from a spiritual condition into the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was urine which we understand came to lady saya the ending of the of the Gentile about these moisture changes Peter said many know that what to say yes I how do I even go any further como si Giri okay once again the second one was to take the people from a spiritual condition yeah my payload in a condition it is probably into a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost Onision del vallès - Peter Ianto once again this mass is paralleling way that he took them out naturally Elmo can use to monitor and maintain from one natural place to another do look at natural look he's taking us spiritually from one condition to another no Sierra Dina condition is pro2 the baptism of the Holy Ghost how about this Melissa p2 son and the last Exodus or the third Exodus if they're saying somebody help me a whole team o CI give me a you them it was to take us from the baptism of the Holy Ghost am I not the least bit but is well spit to Santos he says into the eternal millennium and the land beyond L millennia turn as a man now now if we have already heard the messages come up higher is to be that kind and those that are still down here don't suppose que una Stella struggling with the first or with the second Exodus your lieutenant couldn't say but there is a third Exodus that is going on right intersects with okay secure account and that would be come out of her my people that's right yes but we'll get to that in a moment are you thinking I'm saying but in understanding these things in Nintendo's course we understand as I said it has two parts and the most case one dose we've got to come out of something to go into something else do not party and there's such a parallel in all these things Antonio for we understand that Egypt demos Kiptyn it represents there's a couple of things that brother Branham says Egypt represents this in America by discusses K representation can you tell me what what they it represents telling me player and okay represent a hippo each up represents the world hip to represent and fry it also represents tambien representa the denominations amen and with just those two we can we can approach this message so once again equally gypped represents the world hit the represent el mundo it also represents the denomination represented as they don't mean now before the children of Israel left Egypt can't escape it will Israel day he brought showed himself in a mighty way Justin was thrown on mall yesterday you saw must say before any Exodus can happen but given entity called connect cito Gaston Pisgah God shows himself in a mighty mighty way just a Western remote Madhavi tremendo Amen we know this then as the ten plagues Cosimo's esto como las Plagas and we are all familiar because we learn that in Sunday school right there's no severe moral and emotionless robot the ten plagues what the seven de las Plagas I this should be ABC's it's to video say that we say but let's go into this for a moment you know what was internalized oh because I want it I want you to hear what brother branham has to say about these ten plagues kid okay we got Kelly marentina Casey this does he has plans in a message awakening Jesus in a mincer hey this pertinacious he says just like Israel this SE como Israel when he done all the plagues in Egypt and is the tallest like I said egipto and done the great things that he did he still has got this matter yes man when they got to the Red Sea what do they do Casey Aaron after all that God had done this and they began to cry yes ma you're they began to fear if these are not to marry they know we're gonna die here the sound I see a key vamos a morir this is what this is what Moses told them I keep your camera says he said that Moses had to scream out he's a Moses - ok Katara you've seen the 10 miracle sister lost Milagros and still you doubt God ie as he do the nasty house this is what's tremendous to me it's the Lukas tremendous because it depends on what side you're on but can you pin to the cat now Saint Quentin so whether it is a plague yes there was there on a pillow or if it's a miracle or I soon realized that all right to those that receive the plague let's get a severe on the plaque it was a playground I don't know plug up and what do those that believe God at all look skinny it was a miracle I don't realize it all right it was a miracle to come out of the the greatest nation of that time it was a year ago to to just to go from being a slave to be free this elite is there on his club was what a lyrical it was let me live it and that's what Moses is telling the people look a more sinister is hindering ten miracles and you're still doubting God yes mother yes it's all yet do them if that ain't the exact way it is today yes the no says Moloch is miracle upon miracle Milagros over to me God has showed himself your Sam was traveling yeah we still continue Victoria continue what's gonna happen at the Red Sea he went and okay opposite lore'l Morocco the rest of the world and as they or as they looked on the Egyptians I should say having done come through the plagues there was it was all open let's plug as we have to realize as they realized then that was kind of quick Tacoma you see what a parallel it is yet but a little is to be able to understand the plagues and what has gone on today depois de las Plagas lo que esta pasando oi I may want to be better prepared what the scanners tell me who knows we're here because we want to be better prepared yo creo que estamos aqui por kicking these exceptions Edisto say keeps you I tell you what these Egyptians urology what does a hips use they had over 2,000 gods then your mother those mill do sis now now I want to get you in a mind frame today yeah sound own insanity to really
