[54:18] easy to preach

[54:33] and then we have to look at ourselves to
[54:35] see where we are
[54:38] and so if you can be so kind this is
[54:40] this is
[54:41] this is the end number seven
[54:44] and with the with the subtitle respect
[54:49] so we ask if you would turn in your
[54:51] scriptures
[54:52] in the book of genesis the fourth
[54:54] chapter
[55:01] what a lovely group of people this
[55:03] morning

[55:15] you just put it to the side okay say
[55:17] hello
[55:21] you're eating cherry pie and you come
[55:22] across the seeds you don't throw the
[55:23] whole cherry pie away right
[55:28] put the seat to the side and keep on
[55:30] eating enjoying yourself
[55:40] it came to pass that
[55:41] cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[55:44] an offering unto the lord
[55:59] that an offering of fruit
[56:01] from a ground that god had curse
[56:07] where did he get that idea from the
[56:09] recipient
[56:11] he also brought
[56:13] of the firstlings of his flock and of
[56:16] the fat thereof
[56:18] and the lord had respect unto abel
[56:21] to his offering yeah
[56:35] you may be seated don't close your
[56:36] bibles because we're going to keep on
[56:37] reading a little bit here
[56:42] i can see the story unfold
[56:47] these two
[56:49] young men
[56:52] both of them
[56:54] having been in church ambose
[57:01] i believe adam and eve would instruct
[57:03] their children
[57:06] or the children i should say put it like
[57:08] that
[57:10] but when it came time then to offer unto
[57:13] god their sacrifices their offerings
[57:19] a question came to me this morning
[57:23] and the question was
[57:25] how did they know
[57:27] that god had accepted one and not the
[57:29] other
[57:31] como
[57:34] here's both of the men
[57:38] here they are
[57:52] how would they know that god accepted
[57:55] one and not the other como even
[58:00] i think it's a good question
[58:03] because it's no different today
[58:06] but i asked
[58:08] how do we know that god has accepted our
[58:12] sacrifice our offering
[58:15] sacrificio
[58:16] does we go to church
[58:19] is it because we try to live a good life
[58:23] what is it that that that showed that
[58:25] god had accepted one and not the other
[58:28] ques
[58:31] let's continue reading here and this is
[58:32] verse five now
[58:35] but unto cain and to his offering
[58:38] he had not respect
[58:40] and cain was
[58:42] very roth and
[58:44] his countenance fell most
[58:46] respected
[59:02] enraged
[59:10] good to have you back brother alexis and
[59:12] your wife god bless you
[59:14] we miss them
[59:16] i know
[59:19] now think about it again
[59:22] he's very roth he's enraged at this
[59:24] moment
[59:27] something happens
[59:29] that makes them know
[59:49] [Applause]
[59:56] why is your countenance fallen marquette
[1:00:11] because we think that things should have
[1:00:13] been done a certain way
[1:00:18] kane was it was the same with him
[1:00:21] he thought it was okay the way that he
[1:00:24] was offering or what he was offering to
[1:00:26] god
[1:00:30] but when he realized that god did not
[1:00:32] accept what he had to offer
[1:00:38] his countenance fell
[1:00:41] any of you ever had your countenance
[1:00:43] fall
[1:00:46] you're happy or whatever and then you a
[1:00:47] problem comes right in content
[1:00:51] especially when it deals with your
[1:00:52] family especially
[1:00:54] all
[1:01:35] was even willing to give cain another
[1:01:38] opportunity
[1:01:42] i didn't accept your your your offering
[1:01:46] but if you do well
[1:01:49] will i not accept
[1:02:01] [Applause]
[1:02:03] is that right come on now you and your
[1:02:05] offering must become one and the same
[1:02:08] friend
[1:02:09] i looked at this and i asked the
[1:02:11] question once again
[1:02:14] how did they know that god had accepted
[1:02:16] one and not the other
[1:02:25] in a message that brother branham
[1:02:27] preaches fellowship through
[1:02:28] reconciliation of the blood elements
[1:02:32] he goes to say he goes on to say this in
[1:02:34] the garden of eden
[1:02:37] after they was stricken or thrown and
[1:02:39] thrown out
[1:02:42] the firstborn was kane el primo
[1:02:46] the second one was able
[1:02:49] and
[1:02:49] when they both
[1:02:51] realized that they were immortal
[1:02:57] think about this
[1:02:59] they had never seen death before
[1:03:28] both of them
[1:03:57] sword atlantis
[1:03:59] and now they began their offerings
[1:04:03] for the angel
[1:04:05] watch now because our god is a consuming
[1:04:09] fire
[1:04:18] i can imagine just when that sword
[1:04:21] went down to abel's
[1:04:58] when god begins to ask him a question
[1:05:00] questions
[1:05:02] will you not be accepted if you do right
[1:05:04] now
[1:05:47] this is this is so tremendous as it
[1:05:49] began to unfold
[1:05:52] remember cain was a believer
[1:05:57] but he was a type of the carnal church
[1:06:01] but abel been a type of the spiritual
[1:06:03] church
[1:06:07] god vindicated abel's offerings
[1:06:11] brother brahm says by the supernatural
[1:06:15] the same pillar of fire
[1:06:19] notice this as as this unfolds today
[1:06:24] there were two things
[1:06:27] that we find here
[1:06:30] it said that god had respect unto abel
[1:06:35] there's the man the person
[1:06:38] and unto his offering
[1:06:43] and because of faith yeah
[1:06:47] the faith that a that abel has
[1:06:50] he was able to offer unto god a more
[1:06:54] excellent sacrifice
[1:06:57] so we find the faith
[1:07:00] the person the person and the sacrifice
[1:07:02] the sacrificio and all three together
[1:07:05] juntos showed and was proven if we
[1:07:09] provado that he
[1:07:10] sacrificed the correct thing que
[1:07:12] sacrifice
[1:07:26] a perfect god
[1:07:29] the omnipotent
[1:07:31] omnipotente
[1:07:35] the eternal
[1:07:37] invisible god
[1:07:39] could have respect
[1:07:41] to a human being
[1:07:44] like you and i come on
[1:07:46] that that that blows me away
[1:07:49] that god almighty could have respect
[1:07:52] to a human question
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:31] i don't know why this has happened lord
[1:08:33] do something
[1:08:35] are you that missing a person and
[1:08:49] impossible to please god it's impossible
[1:08:52] come to church
[1:08:54] raise our hands
[1:08:56] sing the songs of zion
[1:08:59] still he does not accept our worship
[1:09:02] we go through the emotions or through
[1:09:04] the motions i should say
[1:09:07] we say oh lord i love you
[1:09:10] but our life shows something different
[1:09:14] let's find out something is wrong
[1:09:16] somewhere
[1:09:18] that's
[1:09:25] [Music]
[1:09:27] that's exactly the problem
[1:09:30] the world wants to do it their way el
[1:09:32] mundo
[1:09:46] his ways are higher than my ways in your
[1:09:48] ways
[1:09:50] he offered unto god a more excellent
[1:09:52] sacrifice
[1:09:55] excellent
[1:09:56] romans 12 1 tells us
[1:10:00] here in this sunday school this morning
[1:10:03] romans 12 1 says i beseech you therefore
[1:10:06] brethren
[1:10:07] by the mercies of god
[1:10:09] that ye present your bodies a living
[1:10:12] sacrifice
[1:10:13] holy
[1:10:14] acceptable unto god
[1:10:16] which is your reasonable service
[1:10:56] but it's
[1:11:07] you say brother we can never be perfect
[1:11:09] nobody's perfect we're humans
[1:11:38] way
[1:11:40] i can't be made perfect because of
[1:11:42] religion
[1:11:46] because i i i repeat and i can quote a
[1:11:48] lot of the bible
[1:11:51] do not make me perfect yes
[1:12:18] that was his respect to god
[1:12:30] by revelation he gave a better sacrifice
[1:13:01] the devil comes to church and he's the
[1:13:03] first one here
[1:13:06] but watch this now
[1:13:08] this is it's where we want to get to
[1:13:10] yeah
[1:13:12] in all reality
[1:13:14] a real true respect
[1:13:30] in the offering of the sacrifice
[1:13:34] and respect on god's side
[1:13:38] is the product of an accepted sacrifice
[1:13:43] we show our respect to god
[1:13:58] by
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:11] i believe god i believe jesus christ
[1:14:15] how does he show that he's accepted
[1:14:19] what you believe
[1:14:22] that's exactly what paul told them
[1:14:26] chapter 19.

[1:16:34] ghost

[1:16:40] brother branham says hallelujah
[1:16:43] hallelujah the church this morning
[1:16:44] should say hallelujah

[1:17:02] now your countenance doesn't have to
[1:17:04] fall anymore church
[1:17:09] you don't have to be rough and enraged
[1:17:11] all the time
[1:17:14] stand up and give praise to god every
[1:17:16] morning and every day
[1:17:20] holy ghost
[1:17:23] watch as this unfolds a little more
[1:17:26] yeah kane was a believer
[1:17:28] but look where that religious spirit had
[1:17:30] its beginning
[1:17:34] he brought his offering
[1:17:37] god had no respect for it
[1:17:42] what would that do to us today
[1:17:47] if we after worshiping in church
[1:17:51] thinking we've given it our all pencil
[1:17:56] and to know god has not accepted it
[1:18:00] would make our countenance fall
[1:18:04] i don't want to be in that condition
[1:18:08] god's giving us an opportunity to
[1:18:10] correct those things
[1:18:12] and i'm grateful for his long suffering
[1:18:17] remember it was by faith that abel
[1:18:19] offered a more excellent sacrifice
[1:18:31] they both sat and heard the same message
[1:18:35] they heard they both heard what happened
[1:18:37] in the garden of eden
[1:18:55] but by the hearing of the word by the
[1:18:58] word of god
[1:19:01] faith comes
[1:19:03] and i like the way the bible says
[1:19:06] jaime
[1:19:34] by hearing one message
[1:19:36] by hearing a message
[1:19:38] after a message
[1:19:40] he's coming it's coming
[1:19:42] from him your faith has grown to
[1:19:44] whatever
[1:19:45] you don't even please god
[1:19:48] i wake up
[1:20:29] i'm going to say it again
[1:20:31] faith moves towards you
[1:20:35] the preacher is preaching right now
[1:20:38] and faith starts moving towards you
[1:20:43] it comes by
[1:20:44] hearing but right now
[1:20:47] there's a lot of people that aren't
[1:20:48] hearing
[1:20:50] people are here in church
[1:20:53] and their mind is what am i going to eat
[1:20:55] after church
[1:20:59] hello everybody
[1:21:01] i don't have enough money to pay my rent
[1:21:03] tomorrow
[1:21:06] you're in church
[1:21:07] yeah but you're not hearing by the word
[1:21:11] foreign
[1:22:00] but sooner or later you'll find out that
[1:22:02] brother caleb was just trying to save
[1:22:04] you
[1:22:08] great
[1:22:36] you
[1:22:39] is advancing to you right now
[1:22:42] there's no reason why anyone here should
[1:22:44] not have the holy ghost
[1:22:47] he's dancing to you this morning
[1:22:50] he's moving
[1:23:04] praise word of
[1:23:47] the logo that has embodied itself
[1:23:53] we don't recognize faith's advances
[1:24:00] come on you young men you know when you
[1:24:02] like little like a young girl
[1:24:06] and you start making a few advances
[1:24:11] good smile buddy
[1:24:14] like hey
[1:24:25] that's exactly what we do to the holy
[1:24:27] spirit
[1:24:49] not today i got bigger fish to fry in my
[1:24:53] life
[1:24:56] i got all these plans in my career
[1:24:59] nothing wrong with any of that
[1:25:03] is a priority over the things of god
[1:25:08] you'll find out one of these days
[1:25:23] and when you find out that you're just
[1:25:25] immortal
[1:25:28] you'll come
[1:25:30] and be serious
[1:25:37] now as we go is that okay if i go on yes
[1:25:41] faith advances towards you by the rima
[1:25:43] of god
[1:25:47] we've got to recognize its advances
[1:26:05] what shall we do that we might work the
[1:26:08] works of god
[1:26:11] believe on him that i said
[1:26:14] that's the hardest thing as i've said
[1:26:16] before that's the hardest thing for one
[1:26:18] human
[1:26:20] to
[1:26:31] so we know then that faith can only come
[1:26:33] by the preaching of the gospel
[1:26:37] what did cain end up sacrificing
[1:26:42] a strange offering
[1:26:46] strange
[1:26:48] what's happening today
[1:26:51] strange sacrifices and offerings that
[1:26:53] god has no respect for sacrifices
[1:26:58] i'm coming now to the part that
[1:27:00] the lord helped me
[1:27:02] okay
[1:27:17] there has never been a day like today
[1:27:21] where there is so much disrespect
[1:27:25] there ain't nobody that that respects
[1:27:28] anyone
[1:27:30] we love the pastor
[1:27:43] because we didn't like how we did things
[1:27:47] watch this now
[1:27:49] disrespect
[1:27:51] is the weapon
[1:27:52] of the week
[1:27:57] write that down
[1:27:58] disrespect
[1:28:26] yes
[1:29:50] to be respected
[1:30:05] a brother sent me this morning
[1:30:07] they were said they were listening to
[1:30:08] brother bernie in the 1980s i don't know
[1:30:10] what message it was
[1:30:15] said he that he said this
[1:30:17] i would rather be treated right and
[1:30:19] respected than to be loved
[1:30:28] and every person that's all you hear

[1:31:16] wrong
[1:31:17] that god doesn't respect because of that
[1:31:21] god respects on another level
[1:31:24] because there has been there has been
[1:31:26] revelation that has come forth
[1:31:42] james 2 1 says this santiago
[1:31:45] my brethren
[1:31:46] have not the faith of our lord jesus

[1:33:20] you don't want them speaking about my
[1:33:21] family no kidding cameron let me finish
[1:33:23] think about somebody else they're all
[1:33:24] right come on last family
[1:33:27] when you respect my person
[1:33:33] not because they come in with all these
[1:33:35] chains these gold chains and this
[1:33:36] raymond oh that's that's put a nice
[1:33:39] place for them here
[1:33:44] people instead of respecting god's word
[1:33:53] we are committing sin when we only
[1:33:54] respect those who are nice to us
[1:34:02] who only
[1:34:14] or what good does it do you to love
[1:34:16] those that love you
[1:34:20] come on you want to know
[1:34:22] you cannot love your enemies you can't
[1:34:24] love those that are talking about you
[1:34:25] stand up without people holy ghost
[1:34:29] and the holy ghost shows
[1:34:58] that you could tell your neighbor i
[1:35:00] don't believe you're the temple of the
[1:35:01] holy ghost
[1:35:05] brother branham says in the message
[1:35:06] respects before you can have respect
[1:35:11] you've got to have fear
[1:35:39] oh
[1:35:50] our lord
[1:35:53] i say this morning
[1:36:07] i perceive that god is no respecter of
[1:36:10] prayer
[1:36:13] god is no respecter of persecution
[1:36:19] well i'm a baptist god is not a
[1:36:21] respecter of persons
[1:36:33] personal
[1:36:52] he wants to see if you respect the one
[1:36:56] that he sends
[1:36:59] and as soon as god got his man ready
[1:37:01] down in egypt
[1:37:17] you would only be in bondage you would
[1:37:18] only be in egypt for 400 years
[1:37:22] they stayed 430.
[1:37:25] why did this stay another 30 years
[1:37:29] because they disrespected the messenger
[1:37:32] god had sent
[1:37:46] why we're
[1:38:27] you know in the camp we heard that
[1:38:30] monday morning
[1:38:32] that this generation that has risen up
[1:38:36] is the generation that has crossed over
[1:38:38] into the promised land which is the holy
[1:38:40] ghost
[1:38:54] the coming of the lord
[1:38:59] only if you and your generation can
[1:39:02] respect the message and the messenger
[1:39:05] solos
[1:39:08] you have an opportunity right now
[1:39:13] you say well how do we respect the
[1:39:15] messenger
[1:39:18] when they laugh at you because the way
[1:39:19] you dress
[1:39:22] stand up for what the word of god
[1:39:50] oh my lord that clock is moving too fast
[1:39:58] brother branham says that joshua and
[1:39:59] caleb
[1:40:01] josue
[1:40:03] moses side
[1:40:05] whether moses was right or wrong
[1:40:11] do you know brother branham made
[1:40:12] mistakes
[1:40:17] amigo
[1:40:19] i am a caleb
[1:40:48] they knew that god that he was god's
[1:40:50] messenger
[1:40:53] and when you talk about the messenger
[1:40:56] talk about god
[1:40:59] brother branham talks about a young girl
[1:41:01] elementary
[1:41:02] she said
[1:41:05] but she said i wouldn't give brother
[1:41:07] branham's religion to my pet cow
[1:41:14] the next day
[1:41:15] she realized she was immortal
[1:41:19] died in agony before brother branham
[1:41:22] could get there you know
[1:41:26] says not because she disrespected me
[1:41:30] but she disdisrespected the gospel
[1:41:35] preaching okay
[1:41:36] and that god was working signs and
[1:41:39] wonders
[1:41:41] respect the messenger i tell you
[1:41:58] and yet god don't understand how he
[1:41:59] deals with prophets
[1:42:03] a man wrote in and said brother branham
[1:42:07] or a man that's supposed to have the
[1:42:08] spirit of elijah
[1:42:11] and there you are sitting on the bank of
[1:42:13] a river fishing
[1:42:17] you know who answered that letter
[1:42:20] brother billy paul
[1:42:21] billy paul and he showed it to brother
[1:42:23] branham
[1:42:38] who could understand the things of god
[1:42:42] how that he honors and he respects those
[1:42:45] men that he sent
[1:42:47] respect
[1:42:48] it's a sad thing
[1:42:50] because you know
[1:42:52] even ministers don't even respect each
[1:42:54] other
[1:42:58] and i say this because there's a lot of
[1:43:00] people that are online
[1:43:03] but many times there is no not even no
[1:43:05] respect amongst ministers
[1:43:08] much less the
[1:43:21] that any servant of god
[1:43:24] that even names the name of jesus christ
[1:43:29] he ought to be honored
[1:43:31] for just even naming his name in
[1:43:33] reverence and respect
[1:43:41] ain't none of us
[1:43:43] has a
[1:43:44] free pass
[1:43:48] it hits all of us i thought
[1:43:58] whether you're the pastor whether you
[1:43:59] are the laity it don't matter
[1:44:03] breaks me down before it comes to you
[1:44:07] that's what he says in the message
[1:44:12] on the name of jesus christ
[1:44:15] i'm with him
[1:44:17] whether he's protestant or catholic
[1:44:22] do the ministers not read this
[1:44:25] whether he's protestant or catholic
[1:44:28] whatever he is
[1:44:30] i might disagree with him upon theology
[1:44:35] oh you don't see the you don't see the
[1:44:37] thunders and the tent and everything
[1:44:39] else like me
[1:44:41] lost
[1:44:42] you might disagree upon theology
[1:44:46] but i want to respect him as a servant
[1:44:49] of christ
[1:44:52] and as my brother
[1:44:55] no matter what he does
[1:44:58] we've got to give respect to the holy
[1:45:00] spirit
[1:45:04] where is that going on
[1:45:07] come on now
[1:45:09] pinch yourself a little bit this morning
[1:45:12] i know it's hot under there jose questa
[1:45:28] that's not important right now
[1:45:30] it's important we become very soft in so
[1:45:33] many things
[1:45:37] watch what he continues to say
[1:45:39] continued
[1:45:44] no matter what he does i got a respect
[1:45:51] if we could bind ourselves together
[1:45:55] and give godly respects to god and to
[1:45:57] the holy spirit
[1:46:01] and what he's doing in this day
[1:46:04] and respect every gift
[1:46:07] and every office
[1:46:09] that he send into our midst
[1:46:13] and god will just continue to pour out
[1:46:15] his spirit upon us
[1:46:18] we'll grow in numbers and multiply yes
[1:46:22] you believe that
[1:46:23] we've got to have respect
[1:46:42] and when he found out that he was that
[1:46:44] he was having fellowship with us
[1:46:50] that man says
[1:46:51] you be careful with those new mexican
[1:46:53] people
[1:46:58] you guys are on the radar
[1:47:05] he said
[1:47:06] they preach a man-made system
[1:47:11] and the minister says have you ever met
[1:47:12] them
[1:47:18] an 80-year-old man
[1:47:20] would think
[1:47:25] i better not say nothing until i meet
[1:47:27] them
[1:47:30] he says you've never met them
[1:47:33] he said
[1:47:34] i have heard between three and four
[1:47:36] hundred messages
[1:47:39] i have yet to see that spirit there you
[1:47:41] go
[1:47:46] imagine a pastor who i've never even met
[1:48:02] he tried to break the brotherhood
[1:48:05] when all we've ever tried to do is
[1:48:07] gather and bring them together
[1:48:11] there's little or no respect anymore
[1:48:15] not amongst the ministry not amongst the
[1:48:17] people
[1:48:21] but many times you hear things
[1:48:24] there'll be people ministers that oh
[1:48:26] that'll come and they'll invite people
[1:48:27] from the church here yeah
[1:48:30] not even the decency to call the pastor
[1:48:32] and say is it okay if i reinvite some of
[1:48:34] the people
[1:48:38] i've never i've never stopped anybody
[1:48:40] from going anywhere
[1:48:42] i've always said whatever we can do to
[1:48:44] help tell me who you want who you need
[1:48:49] i was proud of the man that that they
[1:48:52] asked
[1:48:55] as he stood up and says if you want me
[1:48:57] to go call my pastor s
[1:49:04] imagine if i were to go and
[1:49:06] invite somebody's wife to dinner
[1:49:12] that would be the greatest
[1:49:20] i'm going to say it again to that man
[1:49:21] and to my wife
[1:49:23] that's why there's no respect anymore
[1:49:29] except amongst the bride of christ
[1:49:34] lord help me because if where i have
[1:49:36] failed lord i don't want to fail are you
[1:49:37] that messianic
[1:49:38] i haven't guilty of any of this lord
[1:49:40] forgive
[1:49:51] 1961 brother branham preaches the
[1:49:53] message respects
[1:49:57] what an anointing on that message
[1:50:01] in 1965
[1:50:04] a man by the name of otis redding who
[1:50:06] knows what about the song respect
[1:50:25] but two years later in 1967
[1:50:29] aretha franklin got a hold of that song
[1:50:31] aria franken's ass
[1:50:33] she rearranged a few things
[1:50:36] she was off to the races
[1:50:40] find out what it means to me oh yeah
[1:50:42] here we go okay we're going to get after
[1:50:43] it huh
[1:50:45] what happened coming she rearranged what
[1:50:47] was all originally written
[1:51:01] for the second wave of the feminism
[1:51:03] movement in the 1970s
[1:51:08] r-e-s-p-e-c-t
[1:51:10] find out what it means to me
[1:51:15] the respect of the world is not the
[1:51:16] respect that god requires
[1:51:26] that's why i'm saying you cannot have
[1:51:28] respect without fear
[1:51:31] brother brown says i fear
[1:51:33] my wife
[1:51:35] not the way a lot of men fear their
[1:51:37] wives
[1:51:40] because if they you know they don't act
[1:51:42] right yeah
[1:52:01] to be a stumbling block to anyone
[1:52:05] i fear the people in my community
[1:52:09] because i would never want them to think
[1:52:11] that something i did or something i said
[1:52:14] to show that i wasn't a christian
[1:52:20] coming into a godly fear
[1:52:24] i feared
[1:52:26] not that i'm afraid he's going to send
[1:52:27] me to hell no porque
[1:52:38] advocated for equal rights for
[1:52:43] who would have women where that spirit
[1:52:45] would have taken them
[1:52:49] from equal rights that they were pushing
[1:52:51] for women
[1:52:56] they don't even know how to define a
[1:52:58] woman
[1:53:00] wow
[1:53:01] what about all that other we want equal
[1:53:04] rights
[1:53:08] you can't even define who it's foreign
[1:53:16] imagine they they're nominating this
[1:53:19] this this color lady for the for the
[1:53:20] supreme court nominees
[1:53:36] i knew what a woman was when i was who
[1:53:38] knows coming
[1:53:52] this is where we live
[1:53:57] they cannot define a woman
[1:54:01] but i'm thankful to god that he already
[1:54:03] defined the woman
[1:54:16] she is a woman because she was taken
[1:54:19] from man uh
[1:54:33] yeah we sit there with a finger in our
[1:54:34] mouth sometimes and they're like ah you
[1:54:36] don't know what you are.
[1:54:39] come on are you serious
[1:54:43] eden that's where the world has come
[1:54:45] together
[1:54:46] but there's a people of god
[1:55:03] they think a woman was taken from
[1:55:05] another woman
[1:55:08] oh my goodness what a shame
[1:55:11] and our children have to grow up in this
[1:55:13] world
[1:55:15] but you're given an opportunity
[1:55:26] we'll cancel the afternoon service just
[1:55:27] let me finish this case
[1:55:44] that's all they're after
[1:55:45] esto lo que estas
[1:55:47] the abortion rights and the homosexual
[1:55:49] rights and all this
[1:55:51] homosexuality they want
[1:55:53] the population
[1:55:56] by reducing the number of children that
[1:55:58] were born
[1:56:01] and it's the same way in the spiritual
[1:56:04] mode
[1:56:06] where new births are taking place
[1:56:14] themselves saying we don't have the holy
[1:56:16] ghost in our church
[1:56:21] that you shall be saved in childbearing
[1:56:25] you continue in the faith
[1:56:40] when they lose respect for the pastor
[1:56:43] they're done
[1:56:45] when the
[1:56:46] pastor loses respect for the
[1:56:47] congregation
[1:56:50] come on it works both sides
[1:57:09] this is
[1:57:10] the truth
[1:57:12] that even in the churches
[1:57:15] yes a church
[1:57:18] is a woman
[1:57:19] neglect
[1:57:20] most people today cannot define a church
[1:57:23] anymore
[1:57:26] oh take that one hmm
[1:57:30] come on now you can't define a church
[1:57:32] nope
[1:57:34] because you get together a few of you
[1:57:36] que porque
[1:57:47] god didn't call you to do that don't you
[1:57:49] dare get into that office
[1:58:04] no wonder brother brown says there's
[1:58:05] going to be a lot of surprises in the
[1:58:07] judge
[1:58:10] yet again there's going to be a lot of
[1:58:11] surprises at the judgment
[1:58:14] you're not a pastor because somebody
[1:58:16] thinks you're a pastor
[1:58:52] my brother was calling me from overseas
[1:58:53] brother they're saying that we don't
[1:58:55] need apostles no more uh
[1:58:59] god put the apostle in the church
[1:59:03] show me where he took them out
[1:59:08] i said i i guess they believe in a
[1:59:10] four-fold ministry now
[1:59:42] hello everybody
[1:59:45] and if you leave your first love
[1:59:48] you gotta find somebody else to love
[1:59:51] you lose your first love when you lose
[1:59:53] respect
[2:00:18] come on church take that to the bank
[2:00:22] not when there is respect no controversy
[2:00:26] the bible says that by faith moses
[2:00:29] is seeming the reproach of christ
[2:00:32] greater than the riches of of the
[2:00:34] treasures of egypt
[2:00:37] but why
[2:00:38] because moses had respect
[2:00:42] unto the recompense of the reward
[2:00:47] you know what the word respect there
[2:00:48] means
[2:00:50] i'm coming around the corner now i know
[2:00:52] you're tired and it's hot and all that
[2:00:53] but that's okay
[2:00:55] coming around
[2:00:57] the word respect there that moses
[2:01:02] the word respect means
[2:01:05] away from everything
[2:01:17] my love of my life
[2:01:33] what it means and look again
[2:01:36] when you turn your side off of
[2:01:38] everything else
[2:01:40] put it on your love of your life which
[2:01:42] is christ
[2:01:48] we look
[2:01:49] the people look
[2:01:51] around trying to find something that
[2:01:52] they say they don't have
[2:01:56] to get into their pornographies
[2:01:59] they'll look at immoral things
[2:02:01] in morales no you're not looking away
[2:02:03] from everything else
[2:02:04] [Music]

[2:06:53] because all these impressions don't do
[2:06:54] you nobody
[2:06:59] you try to help brothers and sisters
