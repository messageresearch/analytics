[2:22] well phil listen irene is for the holy
[2:24] ghost field
[2:25] uh martin for the holy ghost the rest of

[2:31] the pentecostal blessings from one
[2:33] church age to the other
[2:35] alpha and omega the end and the
[2:37] beginning and
[2:38] all amen rooting offspring of david
[2:41] morning star
[2:42] rose of sharon little valley whatever
[2:45] more father son holy ghost
[2:47] he that was which is and shall come out
[2:49] for me oh
[2:51] all in all oh i believe we'll just
[2:54] carry on just a little bit with this
[2:56] first one yet
[2:58] i know thou works thou has a name that
[3:01] thou
[3:02] livest and art dead
[3:06] turn over to the next church here you
[3:08] find out
[3:09] but thou has not denied my name
[3:13] following church not denied my name
[3:16] but in this church you have a name
[3:20] amen watcher this church
[3:23] said his name this church
[3:27] kept his name this church cares
[3:30] his name and this church went through a
[3:33] dark age there's nothing said about it
[3:35] when it comes to the life on this side
[3:37] the first little escaped one
[3:39] when luther pulled him out you have
[3:43] a name amen that you are
[3:47] alive but you are dead
[3:52] now what name did they use after you
[3:54] quit using jesus name
[3:56] father son holy ghost there ain't no
[3:59] such a thing
[4:01] it's a dead it's a dead theology
[4:05] now notice this now
[4:08] let's read the next verse watch
[4:13] be watchful and strengthen the things
[4:15] which remains
[4:16] that are ready to die
[4:20] for i have not found our works perfect
[4:23] before god
[4:24] isn't that beautiful oh my love it
[4:29] not perfect why they were just justified
[4:32] amen luther preached justification amen
[4:34] they had to be sanctified and that
[4:36] filled with the holy ghost
[4:37] and then there wasn't their own they
[4:39] were perfected by the holy spirit in
[4:42] them
[4:43] it's not the not the christian that's
[4:45] perfect it's a perfect holy spirit in
[4:47] him
[4:48] that's why as i said it ain't the holy
[4:50] mountain it's the holy god on the
[4:52] mountain
[4:52] not the holy church not the holy people
[4:55] but the holy ghost in the church and in
[4:57] the people
[4:58] that's the holy part things that are
[5:01] ready to die
[5:02] hold on to him now he says sure now in
[5:05] the third verse
[5:06] remember therefore how
[5:09] thou has received and heard i like that
[5:13] and hold fast and repent
[5:17] if therefore thou shalt not watch i will
[5:20] come
[5:20] unto thee as a thief and thou shall not
[5:23] know the hour that i come upon thee
[5:26] hold fast to your justification stick to
[5:29] it
[5:30] don't let that people stop that back
[5:32] away from me
[5:33] that also that you have received you
[5:35] heard
[5:36] they read the same bible that we read
[5:38] see but they just didn't take all of it
[5:41] because it wasn't revealed to them it
[5:43] wasn't father age
[5:45] that's the reason that they'll come
[5:46] forth in the resurrection they walked in
[5:48] what life they had to walk in
[5:50] so they'll all right hold fast
[5:54] that what you've heard let's it die
[5:57] now the fourth verse i believe this thou
[5:59] has a few names
[6:01] [Music]
[6:02] even in sardis which have not defiled
[6:05] their
[6:06] garments and they shall walk with me
[6:09] and wipe for they are worthy
[6:13] as you know he that overcometh the same
[6:16] shall be clothed in white raiment
[6:18] and i will not blot his name out of the
[6:21] book of life
[6:23] but i will confess his name before my
[6:26] father
[6:27] and before the angels it has near let
[6:29] him hear what spirit says unto the
[6:31] church
[6:32] god trying to warn them here to stay out
[6:34] of this nickelodeonism
[6:36] stay away from there keep their garments
[6:38] unspotted from any things of the world
[6:40] just stay free in him and he would lead
[6:43] him he got it
[6:44] now that's the first beginning now
[6:47] the escape ones is the one he's talking
[6:49] about that's these right here
[6:51] this little bitty group here that's
[6:52] living by justification
[6:54] now look they come out they've seen the
[6:56] light
[6:57] luther turned right after the death of
[6:59] luther not luther
[7:01] they're never made no organization is
[7:03] that bunch after him amen
[7:05] wes they never make no organization is
[7:07] that group bad for him
[7:08] i'm old founders of pentecost never made
[7:10] an organization he's a group after that
[7:13] that's the one that doesn't see it's the
[7:15] second round that does it
[7:17] the real angel of life will never make
[7:19] an organization
[7:20] you'll find out on this all this
[7:22] pentecostal age
[7:23] what comes at the end of that
[7:25] organization too they
[7:26] when the holy spirit reveals it to us
[7:29] now he said you've got a little bit of
[7:31] life left just a little bit
[7:33] it's ready to die it's dwindling it's
[7:35] just justification
[7:36] they can swing anyway you haven't got
[7:38] any life yet because you took the wrong
[7:40] name
[7:41] but you're you're at least you've been
[7:42] snatched out see
[7:44] you are you you've escaped the roman
[7:47] church
[7:48] now the church age began about 1520
[7:54] when the roman universal catholic church
[7:58] had full swing that
[8:01] lasted until october
[8:05] the 31st if you're all putting it down
[8:07] october the 31st
[8:10] 1570 18
[8:13] when martin luther nailed his 95th
[8:16] thesis on the church store in
[8:19] whittingburg
[8:20] germany and from that time the
[8:22] reformation was on
[8:24] amen from that date
[8:28] the reformation set in the fire began to
[8:30] fly
[8:33] tested that catholic church standing
[8:34] there that is saying
[8:36] he said this being the holy body of
[8:39] christ it's a wafer in our little wine
[8:41] whammy's on the floor that's right
[8:45] now it was a great political
[8:49] rally but
[8:52] it was not for the holy scriptures and
[8:55] uh
[8:55] and uh holy ghost it was a political
[8:59] rally
[9:00] that he did get rid of some of the old
[9:03] relics of uh
[9:04] the crucifixion hail mary's and
[9:10] [Music]
[9:20] amen
[9:24] yes brought forth
[9:27] uh so yes that's right
[9:31] it did the the revival done
[9:34] some pretty good things that revival
[9:37] but it didn't bring forth the holy ghost
[9:41] they didn't bring that forth to down
[9:42] this later seeing age down the
[9:44] pentecostal age but it did do one thing
[9:48] this revival done some things that he
[9:50] said don't let it die now
[9:52] strengthen it keep adding to it see it
[9:55] brought forth a free bible to the people
[9:57] again
[9:59] the lutheran age brought forth the free
[10:00] bible they made their oppressed and
[10:03] begin to
[10:03] give the world the bible god bless the
[10:05] lutherans for that
[10:06] amen yes sir they put the bible back in
[10:09] the laith his hand again
[10:11] watch us priest alone so now
[10:14] the lutheran revival what they wanted to
[10:16] strengthen
[10:17] now you've got the bible in your hand
[10:19] now read it believe it don't let up on
[10:21] the shelf say well we got a bible that
[10:23] ain't going to do no good up there amen
[10:24] there's too many lutherans in pentecost
[10:26] today laying the bible around
[10:28] taking what somebody else says about
[10:30] amen brother read the word
[10:32] amen search the scriptures were there
[10:34] they would testify on me said jesus
[10:36] and then you think you have eternal life
[10:39] that's the thing to do read the word
[10:41] they did turn from idols
[10:44] and they turned from idols that is true
[10:47] they took down the idols out of church
[10:48] mary joseph and
[10:52] and peter paul all them they turned from
[10:55] the
[10:56] idols but they did not turn to the risen
[11:00] christ luther turn them from the idols
[11:04] but into more like a politic or uh our
[11:07] denominational organization and make
[11:08] themselves
[11:09] just another organization an image like
[11:11] the first one
[11:12] and try to outgrow it by the
[11:14] denomination
[11:15] lookie resurrect that if this book falls
[11:19] to the floor
[11:20] now to take another book and taking his
[11:21] place isn't restoration
[11:24] resurrection you have to bring the same
[11:26] one up
[11:28] amen so if the church died through the
[11:30] dark age and become completely
[11:32] pagan back here then the restoration
[11:35] the re that's a reformation to reform
[11:39] but to be reformed and borned again is
[11:41] two different things
[11:43] [Applause]
[11:44] they brought back reformation reforming
[11:47] getting away from a lot of their
[11:48] idols and so forth but they never
[11:50] brought the holy ghost back in the
[11:52] church
[11:53] home let it be the name brother sister
[11:57] can you see it
[11:57] amen they never brought the holy ghost
[12:00] back
[12:01] because the one that really brings the
[12:03] true gospel life
[12:05] put on your cap now the one that brings
[12:09] the true gospel
[12:10] light is the angel of the church
[12:14] down here amen don't you love it
[12:19] amen this good holy spirit
[12:22] gospel ohio 11 i love him with all my
[12:31] [Music]
[12:34] heart
