[Music] [Applause] [Music] am [Music] very good evening to each one of you may the Lord Jesus Christ bless you please take your seats get comfortable we thank the mus the song leader and all of you for being here creating a a precious uh presence or atmosphere a day like today 74 years ago the pillar of fire was photographed for the first time give a hand to the Lord and it was in a debate or a challenge I remember brother bram's words perhaps you may have known or others as a as a lawyer Advocate but you should know him as as the man of war that's the title of this of the message this evening Christ man of war thanks to God for the opportunity to be here I want to uh thank my pastor my general brother Caleb to direct myself to the precious purchase of the Lord Jesus Christ The Bride of our Lord Jesus Christ I would like to invite you this evening you could please open up your scripture to Hebrews in chapter 10 and as as I begin to to tell you last year around the the month of November remember I had an invitation to go preach in El [Music] Paso I was praying and preparing for that for that service and as I was in prayer and fasting because I did not want it to be Diego Caston to go preach where Diego Caston puts his hand he makes a mess I make a mess so I was asking the Lord that it was him that he would be on the scene and I remember telling the Lord Lord minister to your people heal them when the Holy H Spirit speaks to me he spoke to me in my closet where I was praying and I was praying and the Holy Spirit told me speak to your pain tell it to go away about eight years I had this pain on my heels and eight years I suffered with that and I would see uh uh healings and miracles in many ways but I wouldn't pay attention to that pain and it would torment me for eight years and I hadn't realize that when the Holy Spirit tells me speak to that thing tell it to leave I I looked at my foot and I said in the name of Jesus Christ you're leaving and you don't come back and brothers God is my witness two three four seconds began to come and go and then it left and I learned something brother that when God speaks his word still it is effective any territory under any circumstance brother please come he had he had said a testimony to me what happened my my friend Noah he was in the in the kitchen he got a a headache after he left the house that same headache tried to come to my body and I began to think about brother Noah and I remembered what brother Diego said and I told my headache you do you do not belong here in the name of Jesus Christ and they tried to return just like brother Diego said his pain wanted to come back but it left hallelujah hallelujah now watch he did not say Lord Heal my pain he spoke to the pain and he said you do not belong because the word says by by his stripes we have all been healed brother Bram said he can no longer heal us because he already did it you only have to take the word and apply it if you could please stand we'll honor the word of the Lord in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 scripture says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and now pay attention to these words the good things to come read it from the beginning for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there on to perfect Lord good evening Lord we play put ourselves aside so that we can sit in Heavenly places and take every Redemptive blessing and Lord Minister them unto your people Lord that this may be done for the honor and Glory of your name we thank you for your pres you could please take your seat now capture what the Apostle Paul is trying to say the law having a shadow of good things to come it says not the very image no the law is the shadow of good things to come now what does that mean brother Diego when we read about Moses and the tremendous things that Moses did he brought things into existence a Ministry that had the spoken work impressive things that were done but it was the shadow we see Abraham the father of the faith what faith this man had that he could take his son taken up to the Mount to sacrifice his faith was so great in God he produced a ram what a faith but but but that is the shadow what about Elijah oh we identify with that he made uh fire descend from heaven took hundreds of false prophets and cut their head off Elijah he did impressive things but that is the shadow that that's the Shadow the law is the shadow everything that you see is the shadow of what of the good things one day that shadow reached the point where it was no longer a shadow but the image came the Bible says God was made flesh the word was made flesh it was no longer the now the good things the good things to come were present yes brother it was no longer the shadow it was the image Colossians says Christ being the image of the Living God he was the image he was the good now when Jesus was here he died resurrected but he did not leave in the upper room when there was 120 in the day of Pentecost what happened with those goods what what did they leave what happen where are they Jesus died and he no those goods that had been promised they divided in 120 people where are those goods I see them those goods are here you understand what God has placed in you when you receive the Holy Spirit you are receiving not the shadow although it was good there was Miracles there healings and and wonders but now it's not the shadow now it's the image now it's the image of the Living God hallelujah if there is something brother Bram says the best that God can give his children Good Wife there's my sweet my beloved wife 24 years my love it's been like 24 minutes glory to the Lord after a wife what is it what did Brother brandham say what is the best thing God can give his children it's Revelation it is revelation when Peter makes the confession about Jesus Jesus responds and he says Peter I I tell you you are Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church now brother Brandon said not the rock of Peter not the rock of Jesus the rock of Revelation now keep reading and the gates of hell and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against against it now what is it to Prevail Prevail speaks to me about a conflict it speaks to me about a war and in a conflict when Jesus says they will not Prevail that means there is one that means there's one that will be superior there will be one that will overcome will not Prevail that's because there's two opponents and one one stri and the other strikes other I don't know how to box we have good boxers here they're boxers they see me and they laugh look like a girl brother that's how it is but that's what that's what it's like to fight but he that has the Revelation to Prevail you see why why we need revelation now I ask who who established this conflict on purpose who established this conflict let us go to Genesis 3:1 15 Genesis Genesis 3 it says now who's speaking here is God and I will put enmity and I will place conflict I will place conflict and fights between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed and you may say what problem did we get ourselves into God established this conflict God established let me tell you something else the scriptures say one day the children of God they presented themselves before the Lord and the scripture says and Satan also he gets in in in all places now now watch the scene I'll try to make a drama so you can uh capture it because between lines you can see what what what happens what what happens next and the Lord as Satan where have you been in this conflict it is like a game of chess where the first one that moves obligates the other to then move where you want him to to be tell the game of chess is a strategy now God moves first and you he ask Satan where have you been and here comes Satan and he comes to show off I've been roaming the the Earth it belongs to me I won it from your son that's what it means I've been roaming he was boasting to God and he was the owner of the Earth but it wasn't now now Satan moved he began to to to boast to God and then God moves his piece he says Whoa Satan they don't all belong to you have you seen my servant job now wait wait did not know this was making sacrifice praising the Lord and here's God moving his peace Satan hates the children of God and God knows that but but but but God wanted to put a little bit more more spice on it have you considered my servant job he's perfect he's fearful of God he he's departed from EV that made the devil get more Furious that that's what God wanted to let loose hell over job it's something crazy what God is doing he's doing the best for his children Satan said well of course because you protect it there's a head from you don't let me get it go to him but just give me a chance and I will make him blaspheme against your name and that's where God wanted him he said go go don't touch his life and thanks to this trial you already know all that job had to go through because that is the Tri when the Revelation comes and made manifest it's not when you're at home watching television eating in the restaurant or on vacation it's when you're in hell when you're in the trial when Revelation comes to you that's when job in the middle of hell where he he he he maintained his integrity and he could recognize that his Redeemer lived he would raise him up from the dust and when job could say I had heard by ear but now my eyes have seen I imagine God being so proud what favor you did for me Satan because we go to the scripture we go to Hebrews chapter 10 verse 12 and verse 13 I would like to run but I can't I want you to to capture but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God uh now look at this drama but Christ after he had offered one sacrifice for sins now these are symbols but we're making this drama so you can understand has sat at the right hand of God and from there on forward waiting he's not doing anything he's waiting expecting till his enemies be made his foot stolu the enemies of Christ but Christ is not doing anything because he's sitting down he's sitting down until all his enemies all his enemies all of his enemies all of his pain all the failures that you carry all the afflictions you have are Sons and Daughters of God all of your enemies are placed are made his foot stol you know the word foot stol is this is a foot stol is so that you can go up and then Satan ask permission to God I want to send a cancer to Diego are you sure yes I'm going to send it to him I'm going to kill him you think that's really a good idea yes give him to I want him go but do not touch his life and here's brother Diego resisting the spirit I will put him here a footo so that I can step take one more step up I'll go one more Step Up yes until all his enemies are made his foot stol his [Music] trials they're the best thing that God can give his children because the revelation of who you are in him it will take you to the St to understand that you are an heir of all good [Music] things God is is not a respector of person God is not a respector of person the scripture says believe it is in Luke Luke four and Jesus filled of the spirit was taken by the spirit to be tempted by the Devil by Satan what it says yes sir God is not a respector of person when you read the third Temptation and Satan tells Jesus all of these kingdoms they are mine you kneel down and worship me I will give them to you that was enough for Jesus Jesus said it is written Satan you shall not tempt your lord your God you shall not tempt Lord the Lord was there the first Lord he is Lord of lords it was there in that Temptation where Jesus could prove to the devil that he he was God his Lord and that he could not tempt him brother brandham said received 880,000 BTS thank you thanks to that Temptation Jesus proved that he knew that he was the Son of God the Lord now imagine when Jesus he he says Peter oh Peter Satan has asked for you to sift you like wheat now I remember I I I imagine Peter oh teacher I imagine you told him no I'm your favorite the Revelation came to me of who you are Lord thank you I know you stood up for me thank you what did you tell him teacher I have prayed for you so that your faith will not fail you because I've given you up and when you are converted from the tri it's the trial Peter needed to be converted and then confirm your brothers amen how many people do not convert we know the key now my gener we know who we can send it's the best now you say what does that have to do with us all but because I imagine the drama in this this last time I imagine Satan where have you been I've been roaming the Earth been occupied have you seen my beloved I'm going to marry her you have you don't have much time left don't you see her so pure and so clean she's precious oh I can see the devil sound the trumpet get [Music] ready 100,000 million demons that's right and God says it's not enough you have a short time left s oh I'll go quickly to get to to go get you now understand that the best that God has given it is our trial that is our treas not the good they're good but the best thing that God has given us are trials because that's where where Revelation comes and that's where you can stand and call The Goods the ministers all everything that God did back there you have it as a good to be able to produce it come here look my brother I prayed to God said Lord give me an answer because we had a battle we had a fight about an hour and a half if the people would have seen us we would have thought we were crazy but we were resisting when God told me when I asked him about your case the Lord spoke to me and he told me I already gave you the victory I already gave you the victory now wait I said Lord I don't understand he already gave us the victory victory of what of Aaron of what and I waited he has given us the victory eron of all things because he told me in my name they will cast out demons that is my Revelation I took his name and we went to face those Spirits we went to fight we went to resist them my friend and the Lord has given us the victory let me tell you ER hopefully they piek their head one more time because they'll find us ready they'll find us prepared it is a fight eron it's the best that God has given you because it'll help you grow you have to keep your house Vigilant don't wait for him to come and surprise you keep it keep him at the line every time you get up create an atmosphere an atmosphere around you where God dwells there exists no devil that can that can be in that presence do you understand what the Revelation is you're a fortunate man ER that God has given you the the hardest battles they're for his best warriors do do do you catch that do you catch it you have the goods you have the goods te him to pieces take that spirit and if he comes and put him on the floor go up higher and go up higher what a purpose my friend Glory [Applause] am brother Danny Look What the Lord shows me the Lord healed you of your sciatic the Holy Spirit told me some words about you this morning look I did not pray for you God simply exposed your enemy and you believed and spoke and you told your Tormentor that it was the end do you do you catch that I did not pray for you you see where the gift of healing is you see there there is a person the anointing is changing you that there's more things coming I'm trying to shake your faith so you can achieve everything that you've waited for you have to take it it's it's yours where the restoration of your ministry begins do you understand I didn't pray you spoke it there's a person that your foot hurts here in this part where are you and your foot here in this part there where you bend your foot you have a problem there it is hurting where are you sister sister stand silver silver God has exposed that Spirit here and I ask you what will you do do we let him go what should we do with that demon amen sister not only does he not have no place we're going to torment him we're going to show him that he made a mistake with the wrong person you are a daughter of God and the word is in your mouth do you believe it sister let us pray say tell it demon in the name of Jesus Christ you have you leave don't have to be there speak sister speak to that demon we're bringing the ministry of Joshua there is no enemy that would be alive brother Bram says Joshua was the angel of death and here is the angel of life for the children of God but oh death here is the angel of death for you huj the Holy Spirit shows me I see people you're you're stuck listen to me I see there is a wall ahead there's a wall behind wall to the left and to the right Satan has marked your limits for you and you cannot move you cannot move you can't do anything nothing works out for you stand there's many stand come forward come up to the front all of those failures everything that's hindered you from advancing you do something and everything goes wrong that's the devil but it's the best that God has given you because now you will break down those walls just like the ministry of Joshua brought down the walls of Jericho that was the shadow here are the good let's take those let's bring it down and and by speaking they they have to and they will receive you will receive each promise that belongs to you that demon has been exposed I ask you what will you do with that demon oh demon come sit down no Satan get out of here here's Christ and I will place that en under my feet so that I can go up each enemy that comes by re I will under my feet so that I can go up speak the word tell them tell it demon you're a deceiver but the Holy Spirit has shown me the Trap you have me in now by revelation I receive the goods that you have placed in me and these walls I break them down in the name of Jesus chist speak the word speak the word tell him tell him tell him those walls are broken down it speak listen it's not brother Diego the Holy Spirit took me look brother King he he took me to where the prophet he told the king send the arrow and he sent one Arrow he stried one or two or three times he could not defeat hisy and the prophet got angry he said no because you've done this enemies will prevail the brightest these are our enemies step on them squish them that that's your opportunity for your
