stan we'll be turning into our scriptures in first john three almost a before i start let us pray most gracious heavenly father father as we approach our throne of grace and mercy this morning we are

beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his words i put for a title this morning does my heart condemn me me condensate and with a thought and and i took this from the message that brother branham spoke and while i'm speaking this morning ask yourself that question a and how to take care of you along the road see he's got to see that you don't come up lost a guide is a selected man what about the guy that the holy ghost has chosen to be your past okay delhi and there i was still in the same condition and to me that was good enough i know brother branham says brother brandon said in the message there's only one way provided by god for anything we can never enter the house of the lord and go out the same lupu what condition are you in this morning had the privilege of listening to brother diego speak he will pre-release online in the internet and he had mentioned about the vision they had about the white bag you mentioned how the bag is white on the outside but full of trash on the inside that really hit home for me [Music] because that was the condition that i found myself because i refuse to follow the instructions of the guide the secure instructions as much as he would preach to me it didn't matter important i thought i was okay just going to church so i asked myself the question is brother branham in the message as i thought on my way in el camino he says it's usually when a man gets in trouble that he will turn to god you see it's where it's when we're in trouble then we begin to think about god when israel got in trouble when they had forsaken god and went off after iron and done things they should not do it then they turned to god and cried out and then the strange thing the strange thing that was with israel god will come to their rescue and then when it's all over you they forget all about it i know that's the way i used to be jose cassie lord if you help me from this i promise i'll do this i'll do that agua i'll serve you the suitable and how fast i forgot my promises i remember my dad used to say a lot record when he was talking about someone in the flesh is he a friend in need or is he a friend indeed so you stop and ask yourself that question this morning is jesus your friend in need is jesus or is jesus your friend indeed jesus you know because it's always easy to praise god to worship god but you know he doesn't allow it like that all the time because we know that we all must be tested and that's usually during those times we forget who he is so is he your friend in need or is he your friend indeed brother branham said in the message as i thought on my way this is it isn't good to wait until we get in trouble and then see god it's best to find him now for it is written that he is a very present help he and the very present help in time of trouble yes i was listening to a couple messages that brother branham was talking about going hunting is and when i heard he was in one of the ones in the messenger guide i got a kick out of how he said he cheated on his wife you know right away you hear that and i won't say what but you can imagine what's the first thing that comes to most people's minds but he was talking about when he got married the same time that the lord told him to get married it was hunting season so he was going to kill two birds with one stone this is so he told her you stay here i'm gonna go get go hunting for now and it got to the point that after he got his elk i believe it was it is he knew it was getting late he had to get back to his his wife and brother billy paul when he was about five years old and he got lost and he was what the indians called on a death walk he was just walking around in circles he was trying to bluff it by telling himself that he was too good of a hunter to get lost and in the message something inside of you tells you you're wrong see you know if you die you couldn't meet a holy god me personally personally i used to think i used to think yo pinchawa that you know i could fool my wife i could form my pastor pastor my parents his fathers the brothers and sisters in the church hermanos hermanos and iglesia my heart was condemning me and you can't love god either god knows the very deepest thoughts of your heart i'll be reading matthew 12 43-45 cinco this was personal for me and i spoke about it once occasionally i had an addiction where i struggled for over 30 years and i'll go a little bit more into detail but let's read the scripture when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and find if none for the spirit then he saith i'll re i will return into my house from once i came out and when he has come he finds it empty swept and garnished then he goeth and taken take it with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of the man is worse than the first vienna primero even so shall it be unto this wicked generation that's the way i was at one point in my life you and the crazy thing is yeah that's a good word he would help me he would deliver me in liberal because the unclean spirit as it says in verse 43 the unclean spirit was gone out of three mundo but i would never pick up my bible i would never read it much less read it if i don't pick it up how am i going to read it i wouldn't go to the tape no iva a la cintas wouldn't listen to brother branham let's go challenge all i would do is go to church on sunday morning i was trying to bluff myself thinking by coming to church that i was okay so that was the first thing from the truth i used to try to bluff myself because during the service do not tell servicio during the worship i would praise god but that was the furthest thing from the truth that's right brother branham said in the voice of god in the last days you can't base your eternal destination upon some sensation satan can impersonate any of those sensations it's to know christ and watch your life and pattern pattern it with the word evil is he found my house empty in control in garnet and then i would pray to the lord to help me also in second peter 2 22 segundo de pedro dos ventidos but it happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed into her wallowing in the mire proverbs 26 11. say as a dog return it through his vomit so a full return it to his folly but you know we get to a point in our life we want god to do everything i wanted god to do everything in romans 12 1 in romano he says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service record rationale so with me wanting god to do everything but what did i do to change but okay nothing the last part of revelation 19 7. it says and his wife has made herself ready you know we have something to do also it said she made herself ready so many says if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i'll serve him that was me but that's up to you too you got to do something too that's right it says they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she made herself ready i like that word you see god could not push us through a little pipe pull us out the other end and then saying blessed is he that overcome bentito es el [Applause] [Music] you know my problem was thinking that coming to church that was good enough of course he was going to find my my house in that condition you know satan is very sneaky you know a lot of times he'll say it's okay to do something which is visiting it's just this it's okay but you know one thing leads to another that's right man and there came a point in my life where i finally had it now to me i believe that's where when god really comes on the scene [Music] your worst and your lowest point in your life he didn't meet the three hebrew children before they went into the fiery furnace on the ramp to get there and [Music] when i finally had enough you know you can feel when there's that deep that's pulling you know when jesus is calling you jesus or when there's a deep that calls there's a deep that will respond and one sunday morning and you know god works on both ends so when i felt that the lord was calling me i got up to go to the altar but i thought for a second to go the other way and i chose to go to the altar and i didn't care what anybody thought i didn't care i was embarrassed to worship the lord i used to think what is this person going to say what is the next person going to say is he can so as i was as i when i went to the altar to pray when the free i was pouring my heart out to the lord and i do remember it that one brother came vino hermano and prayed for me europor me prayed with me and i recognized his voice irregular and afterwards i went to him and i asked him if that was him and he told me that the holy spirit sent him holy spirit because the lord knew that that was my day of deliverance but had i gone the other way i wouldn't be here this morning i know that you say so [Music] we will all know you guys are so blessed to have a pastor that you have the ministry that you have he's going to give you your exodus and he's going to put you in a place that you never thought you would be you know and i don't know if i mentioned this earlier but i am home this morning well i was preparing for this message and when we went to sister marie's house when the famous la casa del mar marie and they started to practice that song i was sitting in the kitchen table having a cup of coffee and when i heard them start to sing that song i almost jumped and when we i got home or on the way home the regresso and she said that the lord had placed it upon her heart it is god working on both him i remember one day being somewhere that i should not have been doing something that i should not have been doing and there's probably a couple people that know this but there i found myself staring down the barrel of a gun you might say you're lucky to be alive has nothing to do [Music] and that i would be so don't look at beauty it's correct look at truth media that's what's the matter with the church it's jumping for beauty and die john 17 17 says sanctify them through thy truth thy he said submit yourselves therefore to god he will walk away from me he says he will stay there resist the devil and he will flee but you know if you stop to think about it how's the devil ever going to flee if we first don't submit ourselves to god and then if we submit ourselves to god are we resisting the devil remember the question does my heart condemn me are we resisting god are we resisting the devil or we wanting god to do everything you know we find ourselves in in a bad situation laura i need your help please help me there with the remote watching tv control or doing something other than seeking him reading a magazine or reading a book the endo libro una revista in second corinthians 4 16 second yes he corinthians but the bible says for ye are the temple of the living god this is i remember when brother abraham was speaking last week trying to make yourself go to hell and then say god's good and won't send me send you to hell you're right you're sending yourself that's right i remember one of the hardest things that i had to do you know as a teenager a young adult it was after my wife and i got married one of the hardest things for me to do was stop going to friends people that i knew or grew up with because i was able to get access to things that i knew i should not have been doing it it was like a candy store whatever i wanted to do it was there establishing but you know that's where brother bran says we have to do something ourselves how are we going to submit ourselves unto god myself and then still week after week after week after week go to that person's house second corinthians 6 segundo corinthians says verse 14 versus the temple of god with idols for ye are the temples of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them i will be their god and they shall be my people amen wherefore come out from among them and i will receive i was talking to a brother one time and he was telling me how he was sober and he gave me the years that he was sober los angeles [Music] because once the lord took that away from me in the message the invisible union of the bride with christ the word justified is though you've never done it amen amen it's not even regarded at all in god's book your old book and marriage is divorced and dead and it's not even in the memories of god initiative therefore being justified justification you never done it in the first place he wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom for your shame he took your place he took my place where you were predestinated for him to be his bride before the foundation of the world isn't god good nos dios buenos [Applause] but where do you find yourself this morning you can ask yourself that question does my heart condemn me i remember the message not sure what the name was the title of brother brandon's message but the holy spirit was dealing with the young lady at the time and brother brown she told him that i would get somebody with more sense and that he embarrassed her [Music] you know years later he saw her on the street in in the condition that she was in illegal angels [Music] she was lost forever she said she could see her mother's soul fry in hell like a pancake and laugh at it and you know we can cross that line right i am just grateful this morning that he gave me a chance i'll read this one last quote in closing the choosing of a bribe your eternal destination is a choice there'll be one time that if you turn god down many times there will be one time you'll turn him down for the last time there is a line between mercy and judgment and it's a dangerous thing for a man or woman boy or girl across that line for there's no return a great power to me that's one of my favorite songs how great that word hallelujah with our heads bowed this morning lord you remember heavenly father father celestia you remember lord when i spoke this message in church one year iglesia it was probably one of the hardest things that i had to admit but lord it was you speaking and i didn't think it mattered to anyone [Music] i went to one of the meetings in mexico i'm not sure where it was guadalajara i believe [Music] [Music] me [Music] i was blown away [Music] that he said he struggled with the same addiction [Music] [Music] just as well as he'll attack the ministry and he told me that it had an impact on his life [Music] and if it was only for one person there were others aviano but for me to know that it was the minister shook me to my car message knowing that this problem was more rampant for to even think that there was such a problem like that [Music] [Music] and you took me out from the filth that [Music] and it's only because of grace lord i'm here this morning because of your mercy lord i'm here this morning because you loved me so much [Music] father you knew one day lord jesus he said lord you said if it be possible let this cut pass from me yes [Music] [Music] it doesn't matter who you are [Music] all he wants is you to give your heart that's all he wants from you this [Music] morning like that song that blind fanny crosby saying [Music] passpinato gentle savior oh no [Music] [Music] [Music] whom in [Music] if the words that i said didn't come out how you wanted them [Music] follow me these words that were spoken this morning be a stepping stone [Music] only you are worthy upgrade now [Music] your god to thee [Music] i'll break him down [Music] your god [Music] god bless you [Applause] uh [Music] a soul [Music] you [Music] would you sing it with me in english now [Music] how great [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] someone needs something from the lord [Music] they need a touch from the lord the altar is open one would like to come see just come as quickly as you can [Music] i want to i love you now [Music] [Music] all our ministry would come to help [Music] oh [Music] i believe that the lord jesus is here [Music] if you don't need anything but you're in the audience [Music] before when jesus comes the tenth hour is [Music] the tears [Music] he takes the glue [Music] is would you sink it again and raise your hands and your voice [Music] is [Music] [Applause] away [Music] oh [Applause] take it once again [Music] it is broken [Music] [Applause] how many believe that he takes the glue [Music] [Music] one sat alone this time [Music] [Music] but this is the new [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] away [Music] oh [Music] you deserve the glory [Music] who you

[Music] get what you need right now [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] do you love him with all your heart do you love him with all your heart [Music] amen it's hard to take the person when you don't know the way he's but you gave me a promise that you would never leave you would need me [Music] i will [Music] again [Music] i [Music] and i will go your plans for me they are perfect [Music] i never need to hear although at times [Music] my heart just wants to follow i'm willing to obey take my hand and lead me [Music] would you say that raise your hand [Music] me [Music] i will [Music] lord my heart [Music] is [Music] i [Music] oh [Music] spanish [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] what more can you do if you ask yourself that question tell me what more can jesus do he has
