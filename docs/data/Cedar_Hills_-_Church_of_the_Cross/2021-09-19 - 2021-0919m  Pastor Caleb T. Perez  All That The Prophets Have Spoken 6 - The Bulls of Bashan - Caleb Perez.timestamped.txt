[48:06] capitol
[48:07] in verse one person good to see all the
[48:10] young people and all of you with your
[48:12] bibles
[48:15] fills my heart to see that
[48:20] it reads like this and david crying out
[48:22] says my god my god
[48:25] why hast thou forsaken me
[48:30] why are thou so far from helping me and
[48:32] from the words
[48:38] father almighty god we come before you

[49:31] there in in tucson
[49:35] in tucson we were able to go and visit
[49:38] them last sunday
[49:42] had a wonderful time
[49:44] and it sure was
[49:45] pleasing to my heart
[49:49] after all these years to take brother
[49:51] diego
[49:52] especially
[49:56] amen
[49:58] you know i i gotta give a testimony
[50:00] before i get into the message
[50:03] but how everything happened was very it
[50:05] was so supernatural
[50:09] i don't wanna
[50:11] i'm gonna get myself into some trouble
[50:12] here
[50:13] but how the lord opened up the way for
[50:15] him to go
[50:17] ask him
[50:21] and i don't want to tell the details but
[50:23] but the lord opened up a window
[50:45] and here we find out as as i said
[50:48] uh psalms 22 1.
[50:51] david crying out to god my god my god
[50:56] why hast thou forsaken david
[51:01] imagine
[51:02] the condition that david was in imagine
[51:07] what a condition he found himself when
[51:08] he wrote this phrase or this this psalm
[51:14] a condition of such urgency
[51:18] desperation
[51:34] how many of you have ever prayed that
[51:35] before
[51:37] how many of you have ever felt so lonely
[51:41] and it's not it doesn't matter how many
[51:43] people are around you
[51:45] you can be in a room full of people and
[51:47] still feel lonely
[52:02] am i talking
[52:29] cry out to god and say god my god my god
[52:34] why have you forsaken me
[52:37] why are thou so far from helping me
[52:41] from the words of my roaring is the last
[52:44] david brother branham says in the
[52:46] message why little bethlehem
[52:50] david was in his worst of times
[52:56] it's when he was a fugitive
[53:12] and yet
[53:13] he was hated
[53:15] he was standing between
[53:18] two
[53:18] great
[53:19] deep
[53:20] fires
[53:23] here was the philistines on one side
[53:26] after him
[53:40] how in the world can it ever come to
[53:41] pass
[53:43] we ask the questions many times
[53:47] the devil on both sides
[53:50] driving at david
[53:52] he had taken refuge
[54:36] david's sitting there david center
[54:38] continue reading his throat burning him
[54:43] it was in the middle of summer
[54:46] the philistines was taking advantage of
[54:49] the split between david and saul
[55:00] and the philistines were looking for
[55:01] david also
[55:04] and the philistines were also looking
[55:05] for the israelites
[55:08] talk about a time of confusion
[55:13] just about like it is now
[55:16] everyone
[55:18] against everyone
[55:20] yes
[55:21] that's meant time we live in right
[55:24] then he got up on the mountain

[55:28] hot middle of summer
[55:30] and the heat was tremendous
[56:41] and here you've got
[57:09] he was fighting
[57:38] church of god

[1:01:11] the wicked having closed me they pierced
[1:01:14] my hands and my feet peros
[1:01:20] how tremendous it is
[1:01:37] and with jesus it was the same way
[1:01:41] the dogs lost we understand dogs is what
[1:01:46] gentiles who were who were around him
[1:01:50] the
[1:02:02] high priest and religious people
[1:02:06] anointed by satan
[1:02:09] in order to try to slay him
[1:02:13] surrounded by bulls
[1:02:15] and dogs
[1:02:18] i want to ask
[1:02:32] is
[1:02:45] is that right
[1:02:46] we choose
[1:03:17] no
[1:03:18] no
[1:03:19] i'm going to say it again demonology in
[1:03:22] the physical realm demonologia and
[1:03:25] physical demons in physical form demons
[1:03:29] but we also see demonology in the
[1:03:31] spiritual realm
[1:03:34] in the religious realms
[1:03:36] demons in spiritual form in the soul
[1:03:39] demon
[1:03:40] spiritually
[1:03:42] controlling
[1:03:56] right go to the you're surrounded
[1:03:59] by people
[1:04:01] people that don't believe
[1:04:03] unbelievers incarnate we see dogs and
[1:04:05] bulls everywhere
[1:04:08] what's going on surrounded
[1:05:23] however you want to pronounce it have
[1:05:25] beset me around
[1:05:29] let's take a look at these
[1:05:32] bulls of bashan that had surrounded
[1:05:34] david
[1:06:18] they don't like people coming into their
[1:06:19] territories
[1:06:21] amen
[1:06:23] they're territorial animals
[1:06:27] they're there
[1:06:30] and have been there for years
[1:06:33] generations
[1:06:35] and they control the region
[1:06:38] that they're in control
[1:06:41] now i i say this because those of you
[1:06:44] that that remember
[1:06:48] the first time that we we went or the
[1:06:50] second time i believe it was that we
[1:06:51] went into uganda
[1:06:53] the lord had showed brother diego a a
[1:06:56] big bull
[1:06:57] how can you remember that
[1:07:14] but as time goes on you you get to
[1:07:15] understand things a little bit more
[1:07:20] because these balls signify demonic
[1:07:23] presence
[1:07:40] nobody
[1:07:47] they're not bothered by religion because
[1:07:49] many of them claim to be christians
[1:07:54] but
[1:08:17] if you ever want to see
[1:08:19] bulls that make these texas longhorns
[1:08:22] look puny
[1:08:35] those two horns are
[1:08:37] two powers
[1:08:40] and those powers are what controls the
[1:08:43] people
[1:08:46] remember what those two horns were those
[1:08:48] powers
[1:08:52] not in the book of revelation i'm
[1:08:53] talking about the division here remember
[1:08:56] what's there
[1:08:57] there's two things that control the the
[1:08:59] people over there
[1:09:02] one power is
[1:09:04] poverty
[1:09:07] and the second one is violence
[1:09:11] those are the two horns that they
[1:09:13] control the people with that connector
[1:09:16] they keep the people poor man
[1:09:23] no wonder amos writes in amos 4 1 if you
[1:09:25] can turn real quick too
[1:09:30] hear this word
[1:09:31] ye kind of
[1:09:33] bashan
[1:09:35] khan word kind there is is cows right
[1:09:38] they can talk of a go ahead
[1:09:41] it can speak a kind can speak of a
[1:09:44] female cow
[1:10:15] masters bring and let us drink
[1:10:19] once again you see the two horns here
[1:10:22] sovereignty
[1:10:23] oppresses the poor
[1:10:26] violence crust the needy
[1:10:42] to kill anyone that comes into their
[1:10:45] region
[1:10:47] now we know that we have a real enemy is
[1:10:49] that right
[1:10:51] how many know that
[1:10:53] i mean by now we've had quite a few
[1:10:54] battles huh
[1:11:14] he saw a skull
[1:11:16] and we've heard this before
[1:11:22] a skull with a jawbone
[1:11:36] these are ministers that are beginning
[1:11:47] it looks like a dead body a skeleton
[1:12:20] a part of the mystical body of the lord
[1:12:23] jesus
[1:12:26] is being formed there in uganda
[1:12:29] in uganda how many how many love the
[1:12:31] lord for that santos
[1:12:33] now watch now we're all a
[1:12:46] they're okay if they're in their
[1:12:48] denominations
[1:13:03] anything that is a threat to these bulls
[1:13:06] they're going to fight you to the death
[1:13:08] toll
[1:13:10] why do you think men that have risen up
[1:13:13] such as brother rogers in monopoly
[1:13:16] manufacturing
[1:13:27] as they were baptizing all these people
[1:13:29] through the country
[1:13:33] who do you think ran brother julius and
[1:13:35] brother changi off the road and nearly
[1:13:37] killed him
[1:13:44] who do you think has tried to silence
[1:13:46] all these pastors
[1:13:50] even many of them that have died through
[1:13:52] the cover
[1:13:55] ministers of the gospel
[1:13:57] and not just there but through the whole
[1:13:59] world
[1:14:01] balls of bashan having camped about lost
[1:14:06] they have come past
[1:14:09] and they're after one thing
[1:14:12] to destroy
[1:14:20] and i can hear david crying out even
[1:14:23] more now
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:46] though
[1:14:47] he's there doing his work
[1:14:50] that's not what we focus on
[1:15:25] now now
[1:15:26] we don't we don't focus on those things
[1:15:30] because our groom said in luke 4 18.
[1:15:36] spirit
[1:15:41] [Applause]
[1:15:47] but the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:16:03] but the gospel is being preached
[1:16:17] all the violence that's going on with
[1:16:19] the other horns
[1:16:22] and recovering of sight to the blind
[1:16:25] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:16:30] when we talk about these bulls
[1:17:00] but did you know a stronghold can even
[1:17:02] be an incorrect way of thinking
[1:17:10] when we don't think properly
[1:17:13] we don't have the mind of christ
[1:17:16] an incorrect thinking pattern
[1:17:22] is formed
[1:17:24] when a person pays attention to the bull
[1:17:26] when the person
[1:17:28] rather
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:53] something about our thinking pattern is
[1:17:55] not right
[1:17:58] that's the reason that
[1:18:00] we many times reason it's not our minds
[1:18:04] the word
[1:18:07] and it doesn't matter
[1:18:09] many times what you tell people
[1:18:38] maybe you don't i do i get in trouble
[1:18:41] every time i think
[1:18:43] demons thrive on strongholds
[1:18:49] because they are stubborn spirits
[1:18:54] the word strong horror stronghold
[1:18:57] literally means a fortress
[1:19:02] and the one controlling
[1:19:06] israel
[1:19:08] who controls your fortress skin control
[1:19:13] who's your king
[1:19:15] you some it's smoking
[1:19:19] others it's drinking
[1:19:39] got to ask yourself the question am i a
[1:19:41] stronghold for the lord or for saying
[1:19:59] a stronghold is a demonic force of pots
[1:20:18] [Music]
[1:20:30] you
[1:20:43] they become words
[1:21:13] for the good or for the bad parallel
[1:21:15] holo
[1:21:18] this bulls of basin
[1:21:22] i want you to really get this
[1:21:25] oh god that's your brother benjamin back
[1:21:27] there i i don't know if you you that
[1:21:29] that have not met him yet
[1:21:32] brother ben you can turn around this is
[1:21:34] brother benjamin he's from he's from uh
[1:21:37] from ghana and remembers the guy who's
[1:21:40] down here going to his school
[1:21:42] you pray for him and if you anybody
[1:21:44] wants to invite brother ben to your
[1:21:46] house to eat or whatever
[1:21:48] you can look him up after service but
[1:21:49] it's good to have him here again
[1:21:57] now brother henry preached a message
[1:21:59] sometime not too long ago
[1:22:04] and he talked about
[1:22:06] the king of the king his name
[1:22:22] if i'm not mistaken brother henry that
[1:22:24] king aug he was he was the he was like
[1:22:28] like the last of the of the giants is
[1:22:30] that right
[1:22:33] and and and this is where
[1:22:35] bulls of ba batian or bashan
[1:22:46] can you put that map up real quick just
[1:22:48] so that people know
[1:22:50] this this is part of israel
[1:22:53] israel but if you can see this pink part
[1:22:58] this is that would be known as as the
[1:23:00] area or territory of bashan
[1:23:03] now now notice something because we're
[1:23:05] going to get to this in a little bit
[1:23:08] notice up in the northern part of that
[1:23:11] is a town a city called caesarea
[1:23:14] philippi
[1:23:17] now
[1:23:18] you you you just notice that take note
[1:23:20] to that because it's going to help you
[1:23:24] that area
[1:23:27] was controlled by ing
[1:23:40] who
[1:23:42] was ruler of that territory
[1:23:46] and as the israelites they they
[1:23:48] began coming from egypt and they they
[1:23:50] they were right before they got into the
[1:23:52] promised land
[1:23:56] they had to come conquer him
[1:23:59] that part of bashan
[1:24:09] deuteronomy 3 1 if you can turn in your
[1:24:11] scriptures
[1:24:14] this is a good sunday school lesson and
[1:24:16] i sure enjoyed studying this
[1:24:20] i have no idea what time i started but
[1:24:22] that's okay
[1:24:25] deuteronomy 3 1 says then we turned and
[1:24:27] went up the way to bashan and og the
[1:24:30] king of bashan came out against us
[1:24:33] and he and all his people who battle at
[1:24:36] edre
[1:24:38] camino de abbas
[1:24:41] rey de basan para
[1:24:46] now remember
[1:24:48] the bulls
[1:24:49] the strong bulls of bashan
[1:24:53] they're around me
[1:24:54] david watch watch where this comes from
[1:24:57] but the lord said unto me
[1:24:59] don't fear him
[1:25:02] and he's telling you this morning you
[1:25:03] know jesus
[1:25:04] here are the strong bulls
[1:25:10] don't fear the
[1:25:18] we're going to find out how big this
[1:25:20] giant was
[1:25:23] notice this now he could say he says
[1:25:25] don't fear him
[1:25:27] or i will deliver him
[1:25:33] into your hands
[1:25:37] that should be enough
[1:25:53] of the remnant of giants
[1:26:00] his bedstead was a bad state of iron
[1:26:05] goes on and says
[1:26:07] it was nine cubits the length of his bed
[1:26:12] remember how how long that was brother
[1:26:14] henry
[1:26:17] yes
[1:26:19] it says nine cubits
[1:26:24] approximately 13 and a half feet long
[1:26:33] and it was
[1:26:34] six feet wide is a safe piece the anchor
[1:26:37] that's a big man
[1:26:39] he may not have been 13 feet
[1:26:44] i'm sure he was a big man that slept in
[1:26:47] that bed
[1:27:02] and there would come another king
[1:27:05] that was likened unto moses
[1:27:09] but there was something in it and just
[1:27:11] just just
[1:27:13] put all your thoughts to one side right
[1:27:15] now
[1:27:16] and just focus on the word this morning
[1:27:20] there was something
[1:27:22] so much more evil about bashan not just
[1:27:25] a giant king
[1:27:38] you know you go to certain cities right
[1:27:40] and there's certain parts of the city
[1:27:41] they say stay away from that area
[1:28:23] were considered gateways to the
[1:28:25] underworld realm of the dead
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:34] this verse starts getting good
[1:28:35] i got their attention this morning
[1:28:38] pinch yourself if you're gonna fall
[1:28:40] asleep
[1:28:58] and at the base of that mountain was a
[1:29:00] town called
[1:29:02] caesarea of philippi
[1:29:08] now now those of you that know that know
[1:29:10] history
[1:29:11] you know that mount transfiguration
[1:29:15] many that they argue about where it
[1:29:17] really is
[1:29:19] many of them believe the majority in
[1:29:21] christianity believe that it's mount
[1:29:22] tabor
[1:29:30] but the bible says that that that he was
[1:29:33] taken up to a high mountain
[1:29:37] and there are many that believe that
[1:29:38] mount hermon is the place of the trans
[1:29:40] the transfiguration
[1:29:44] but whether it is or not
[1:29:47] i wanna i wanna i want you to focus on
[1:29:49] caesarea of philippi
[1:30:03] you got that amen
[1:30:05] tell your neighbor because you got to
[1:30:06] repeat it sometimes to learn it
[1:30:10] caesarea philippi
[1:30:14] known as the gates of hell
[1:30:21] in addition
[1:30:23] in the mount herman area apart
[1:30:27] they have found 20 temples
[1:30:31] of various pagan gods
[1:30:35] who have surveyed on or that they found
[1:30:38] in mount hermon and its surroundings
[1:30:43] and this caesarea philippi
[1:30:45] felipe was a city
[1:31:16] because it stood at the base of a cliff
[1:31:18] where spring water flowed
[1:31:22] it is known as the headwaters of the
[1:31:24] jordan river
[1:31:40] i want you to tell me somebody to tell

[1:33:57] on let's go on we're going on the
[1:33:59] journey

[1:34:09] but we gotta go to a different town
[1:34:11] pueblo and you're gonna ask me where

[1:34:19] jesus saying you just hold on
[1:34:22] i'm going to tell you in a moment but
[1:34:24] but it's a little ways
[1:34:26] get your walking shoes
[1:34:29] on the road for a while it wasn't
[1:34:32] somewhere real close
[1:34:34] it was in the northern part of the
[1:34:35] bayshon
[1:34:39] here comes jesus
[1:34:41] and he says okay as you're walking
[1:34:44] you know where i'm taking you all sabina
[1:34:46] and lo

[1:35:03] we're going to caesarea
[1:35:06] and i can see the the the disciples
[1:35:09] saying
[1:35:10] why are you taking us there
[1:35:26] sacrificing
[1:35:38] they finally get to the
[1:35:54] set them down
[1:37:04] but it could not be measured and
[1:37:06] therefore that's why they gave it the
[1:37:08] name the bottomless pit
[1:37:12] there at the very gates of hell
[1:37:16] the rock confession was made
[1:37:46] who do you say
[1:38:14] raises his voice
[1:38:25] father which is in heaven
[1:38:57] everything in the plan of god is perfect
[1:39:01] standing at the gates of hell
[1:39:04] never forget caesarea feel a pie from
[1:39:06] here
[1:39:09] build my church edifica
[1:39:21] is
[1:39:38] god gives us all this this armor
[1:39:41] is protect ourselves
[1:39:45] there's truth in that
[1:39:49] but we always look at the church of the
[1:39:51] living god always on the defense
[1:39:56] come on church that's not the church
[1:39:58] that jesus christ said he would build it
[1:40:03] he is not on defense all the time
[1:40:06] this
[1:40:18] why don't we go forward and attack
[1:41:12] and he's still making the announcement
[1:41:14] at the gates of hello
[1:41:30] i'm going to say it again jesus shows
[1:41:32] something different
[1:41:34] he is on the attack
[1:41:37] he goes to the gates of heaven
[1:41:43] he doesn't wait for caesarea philippi to
[1:41:45] come to heaven
[1:41:50] to invade satan's realm
[1:41:55] he went to invade saints gates
[1:43:08] god was so happy with the pergamian
[1:43:12] elect of that day
[1:43:17] because they had
[1:43:18] the same spirit
[1:43:23] sometimes i wonder if lord are you proud
[1:43:26] of us
[1:43:29] i didn't say that because i might hurt
[1:43:30] somebody's feelings
[1:43:42] [Music]
[1:43:44] don't say that because we're you got to
[1:43:45] be politically correct
[1:43:49] when you talk like that
[1:44:03] this is
[1:44:16] he was so proud of that brigade elect
[1:44:18] group
[1:44:32] they were
[1:45:14] through the name and faith of jesus
[1:45:18] christ right in the camp of the leaders
[1:45:20] of darkness
[1:45:23] they must have known
[1:45:24] what happened in caesarea
[1:45:41] quenching water

[1:46:39] i don't matter what the pastor says

[1:46:48] word

[1:46:52] a
[1:46:53] there's always as i said this this kind
[1:46:55] of like oh

[1:47:05] having no problem
[1:47:49] there's no in the message why christ
[1:47:51] speak
