everyone god bless you i have another poem song for you today um and one of these days i'll give one of these poems songs live uh when i'm brave enough but uh today is not that day so so i'm gonna keep doing these little voice recording uh ones as long as i possibly can and then one of these days i will be brave enough to give it but when that moment comes the rapture may be happening the very next day so you all better be ready but um i like to give a little bit of a background on these pieces that the lord inspires me with because i think it kind of helps to see uh where he was coming from when he gave gave these to me and um i really enjoyed sharing that so this was actually inspired to me uh last night and um the piece when i was giving it i heard another tune again and it sounded like an irishman and this irishman who was singing when i heard it i saw this um i saw him like out on a field a wide open field and he was a farmer and he was farming to what i can assume would be potatoes and uh he was just out there humming this this hymn of sorts or this lament really um and that's where the piece came from and for those of you who don't know what a lament is it's basically just like a sad song um and uh when i got to writing it um the the piece was initially inspired by the concept of old nature versus new nature but it started to dive into the people who have gone on before us and uh whether that would be people who have passed on or people who have left and we no longer see any more and that would be people who have left the church or or things like that and i think about that a lot actually i think about those people a lot and so this piece is really written for them and um it is it is titled uh a land far beyond and i hope that you all enjoy it and that it blesses you and uh there will be probably an accent on this one so just be expecting that but uh here we go i fare in this new labor for that world beyond an earth that is clearer than this world i'm on a land that never fails or hers beauty not glow strong that land of milk and honey that land that's so foregone be made a new nature the old one the deceiver walk tall your visions clearer the lord bring thee believer i long to see men holy so we may sing this song this song of those who labor for that land they're far beyond they say i am a fisher for whom those men belong fish for our redeemer for he doth surely long to have the ever closer you sons and daughters lost come home to the defender the end he doth prolong be made a new creature the old one the deceiver walk tall your vision clearer the lord bring thee believer i long to see men holy so we may sing this song this song of those who labor for that land they're far beyond this song of those who labor for that land they're far beyond god bless you all [Music] standing there at the red sea god's people [Music] stand [Music] then god parted the waters and they cross to the other side god delivers again oh my god when it seems all is lost he reaches down his head then all the [Music] my god [Music] the three hebrew children proclaimed so the king gave the command to throw them into the flames the king said did we not cast three men into the [Music] they're walking around [Music] oh my god delivers again when it [Music] paul seems lost he reaches down his hand then all the forces of evil had to see and he is coming just when things look hopeless like god delivers [Applause] just when things look hopeless again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey man thank god for that special in that poem

to be comfortable we want to give thanks to the lord jesus christ this precious opportunity to permit me to stand here behind this sacred and precious desk it belongs to him this pulpit it's his position we want to pray for our pastor and all his precious family that those that are with him there and wherever he may be we're going to go into the book of saint matthew chapter 7 and verse 21 i want to finish with this thought until we found out the will of god in our life i asked the question the time passed [Music] i'm going to speak about the success everyone today wants to have success and that's not bad the world is is offering you how to be successful that is the problem and it is found here in the word of god if we can open up our bible to the book of saint matthew chapter seven verses i i hope that i have your attention already young people told me this the how many want to know the secret that god reveals it's something personal i would share it with you amigos amigos oh my precious family and all of our precious young people here they raised up their hands matthew 7 21 says this is jesus this is jesus speaking this is a very peculiar scripture you might say brother what does this scripture have to do with success not everyone that says that to me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then while i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me he that worked saint john chapter 6 6 38. i'm going to ask you to stand if you would thank you for i came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me let us pray show us your will for each one that you will hide them from every bad in the tabernacle of las cruces new mexico i am going to reveal i'm going to tell you a secret that will make you a multi-millionaire today on wednesday i will assure you that this place would be full all the internet the social media they do how much it's i want to pray and if i don't have the money i will borrow it i want to know that secret oh yes today the secret is will be shared san diego is impressed without money and without price cindinaro is impressive without money i want you to give me your undivided attention when jesus talks and when we see his life at the last time jesus i talked last time that jesus did not have what you call a successful because he did a lot because he did a lot of healing [Applause] everyone would say they all love jesus [Applause] jesus never was supportive jesus teaches us in saint john 6 38 what we read or i came down from heaven not to do mine he started praying for the sick he started doing surprising things he started stopping the storm he walked upon the water there was not oh what a terrible god and many in that day will will tell me matthew 7 21 and normally when i have heard it the majority of times they are preachers or people that god has given precious gifts for the church and maybe they don't have enough knowledge and then they'll say well many in that day will say lord i prophesied thanks be to god for a prophet because i don't believe that the word prophesy here will be just to speak by inspiration prophesy brothers in the new testament then we do they'll throw this out but but they don't explain it they just say in verse 21. and no one understands oh maybe but let us not take a scripture out of context not everyone that saved him to me lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that do it the will of my father which is in heaven what does jesus say who will enter into the kingdom of heaven those that do miracles prophetess those the prophets those that heal no no no no to the kingdom of heaven or by doing healing john [Music] that was born of a woman these pharisees would come to see john no my hero juan mirandos i can imagine john looking at him and saying oh the axe is already playing to the root of the tree and the tree that does not it was to introduce the messiah all i saw him was journey through the desert of the will of god can we do miracles [Applause] john 4 34. jesus said unto them escaga jesus saith unto them my need is to do the will of him that sent me and to what and to but the the that jesus said here and many ah that day many will say lord in your name he will go with you they brother i pray and god doesn't answer my prayers there are people that have 10 20 years and they're stuck they cannot grow because they are always which will maybe raise up but somebody that will have a big business god blesses him and then everyone else will say of what god is doing through your life [Applause] you maybe might see a minister that's spiritual you know and you might see him doing this and god bless him and another minute miracles [Music] but this you have at your disposal to make it and during this campaign never have one defeat or one soldier die or any of that man i did not have an answer to that until i understood this when you are in the purpose and in his will you are indestructible no one can our apostle and our founding pastor hourly established work time but maybe the next day he would call his uh his ministers we're going to go to albuquerque we're going to and while they were on the way to the airport a whirlwind of money now this is for believers there is there a witness i love him [Applause] do the miracles and the signs because you work together my work and never look for the will the message is 11 hallelujah and many testimonies like this there are many of them lucas capitul luke 11 lucas once 11 chapter 11 of saint luke to save time jesus this is where the disciples tell jesus what jesus says the disciples said master teachers show us how to pray verse [Music] save my control has control of all things when you pray i want you to understand yourself [Music] and that's what yes thy name all enter you have to ask for his will to be done help me today i already passed five everything that was coming against him and it was so impactful as a
