messages I don't know but but I want to entitle it this this morning another book of Acts via means you know they Ottoman stock sqm percent of large nose and amen so so I might be a little bit lengthy this morning it seems like I always am what's that manana but it's Sunday we don't have nothing better to do amen if you just get right into if you get into the spirit of it time means nothing and so let's get right into the word if you would just the first chapter and totosai chose capital and the first verse and it reads like this when you have it you can say man capital who knows you play every billion it says the former treatise have I made all Theophilus of all that Jesus began to do and teach primarily Muslim love oh oh dear fellows that was las casas que comenzó said I want you to folk there on that Jesus began both to do and teach said yeah and said yeah they got out his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated it's a presence in Tanner we know as we have said it many times it is not the Acts of the Apostles which I visited with dicho know some loss issues that was a postal s but it is the acts of the Holy Ghost through the Apostles okay is a literary man then speak how many know that a travesty loss apostolis the the very word acts if you can put it up there for me those that are back there a chose as a noun it is anything done being done or to be done a chose algo que está siendo algo que se acabó what stop what is there say it is something that was that is yes and that shall be okay it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever again oh you poor siempre and we are either doing the acts or the deeds of the Holy Ghost estamos in dollars a chose Dennis Peterson or we are fulfilling the part of the deeds of the Nicolaitans so someone's complained oh I lost one of the early you can't be somewhere else it's either one or the other está siendo acts is the activity that is in process Joseph like TV that is that process we just finished in process of time I finished mi Nam was that a process it is the operation it slow it is a state of realization that really as opposed to potentiality mr. Lucas I'll go post possibly potential is has become a bad word but because potential is always in the future oh they have a potential to be something great porque put this you didn't put this but it never brings it to today to right now no potential no no trial presenting the the action or the verb of the word acts in vivo de la palabra it shows it means to do something is yes it means to exert energy or force is thyself what's that winner here it means to produce an effect they proceed it means to behave or conduct oneself in a particular fashion as a conducive you know they're not manera and it also means to perform as an actor they how many actors do we have here we don't want to be as a Pharisee which means actor that kind no come on let's fight scene has been set and we are the actors of this Seventh Seal I believe that what is its if they will say you so then the question is as we get this going in who wrote the book of Acts desmond thermo-skin is pure libro de los hitch and we can easily say well it was the holy ghost through a man that wrote the book of Acts is Peter Santo and I say amen to that a policy remain but let's find out first of all who wrote the book of Acts with the keenest cure and to who it was ravine written to yeah kissing estamos viendo he says once again in the first chapter in the first verse the former treaties have I made all Theophilus they say primero I must have bla teófilo how many knows that he's speaking to a man by the name of Theophilus was having a Sarafian hombre amount earful Oh watch as as he starts the book of Acts this way physical in cuenta que los they chose the former treatise wanted your former it means foremost in place order or importance or time algo que s anterior it's the beginning or the first of it all is the primero o lo interior and the word three ties or treatise is location aguado is actually the very word logos is the mismo now here's the book of Acts starting this way I'll leave a little citrus Commons and the writer is telling this this as he begins to write this book he told me he's saying the former or the first time that the logos ever came into flesh look at this oil in logo says Esquivel the first time it came into flesh okay we know write the FIR the form or the first time this happened la primera vez que con tus here's what I wrote about to you Theophilus the first time it's looking lipstick if you know premier I need you to get this because I don't want to run with it I want you to get this kit okay captain is he's already in the book of Acts talking about the logos from deliver the sisters coming talking about the first time that the logos was ever made flesh and dwelt amongst us well appearance can logos mustn't say that is what this writer began to tell it's okay Stace Couture in PS Kaviri the rider is stating yes logos which is the very embodiment a low-cost kissing incarnate of the thought and word of God and is God de la palabra de cemento the deal was what he had first written in his previous book or his previous writing Escobedo interior meant for he says all that Jesus which is the word por que todo lo que de his suitcase lapel and the logos made slash and logos that you currently began both to do and to teach commenced o primeiro as there in singer and as the god man como el hombre Dios the gospel which was written is what he did 11 Haley okay for the Romero case so but the book of Acts para liberal in Los Zetas is what he continued to do is local continuously in his mystical body here on earth su cuerpo Mystik wok oenothera what this writer is saying look at this is discreet or is that what he written before yes could be the one it was what the logos and a look a local who had been made slash for the first time in Jesus Christ yesterday apparently Romero and his sous Chris had started to do and teach salsa dancing yeah let's go to what the first riding was then vamos entonces our I'll ok fella premier sk2 Luke the first chapter look as capital oh no you have it can say Amen he cannot think and see this in a minute now there is a connection there with a book of Acts with the Book of Luke are you not gonna extend aqui con hoc loop because the Book of Luke Luke as the former treatise that he is talking about so lesson Luke 1 says for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word or of the logos Piero della palabra and it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent Theophilus may operatio Tambe enemy después de ver intended at all as course of the said principio Candela hence eeeh yes gorillas poor or them of when they feel oh we have two writings which are actually one case when I thought they were divided into two but on TV the same but both were written by the man called Luke there are mosquitoes put it long and he's writing it to Theophilus see let's discover your feel alright we got that this morning yes the kids the offal is that's a good name the problem is is that nobody knows who Theophilus is preliminary kena still feel oh no one knows who Theophilus was again in al Theophilus don't feel as Luke is referring to him there are several different theories as to who he really is we know he's addressing a person because he calls him most excellent Theophilus particular a my own when yo and the phrasing most excellent excelencia is the title often used with someone of honor or rank they were stuck on the cell excelencia that t2 loss will meant a of the tango but however we also believe the mink ramos that Luke is addressing a group of people also okay look as their the retail group again he's addressing a group of people on group for the hint is cool through the ages would have a lot to do with not only what he wrote look in this video but would be a continuation look as they do not continuous off what Jesus had began to do and to teach for what we do know what K look at systems yes that's the name Theophilus means loved by God is a mother than yours or a friend of God own amigo that yours and therefore when I read Luke and I read acts look as he's writing it to me all Theophilus he's writing it to you all Theophilus because you and I are a friend of God but could use this suppose amigos who is the friend of God give this to me he says now I was gonna keep this you can either make honest no but Abraham is my friend now I cannot keep any secrets from my friend you know poverty never say criticism yummy therefore if Abraham is typing the elect of God what is this kiss your rod tip if we can loosely heal then the Book of Luke and the book of Acts was written to the elect of God Lucy look as the men who escrito Alice Ellie and I'm okay with calling you are all excellent Theophilus your sales trivia mandalas excelencia or trophyless so how many here know that the book of Acts was written for you what design can you know satisfies Peter Pan upstairs now the question is who is your book of Acts being written to we don't want to tell you the end of the story before we get to the middle knocking him was a ceiling fiend any story a scene that you got me the book of Acts is the fifth book of the New Testament illiberal Quinto libro del not written by Luke who was a non Jew as Keita palookas can know enough with you and we all know that Luke was a physician he said mascara on medication that traveled with Paul Medicaid a tremendous man of God now I want you to know this now is that there are people that say that the book of Acts was not actually suitable for teaching of the church violence against a legalist there are those that have said that the book of Acts liberal shows that that was the framework of the church lately saying God for a prophet who told us yes prophetic and that the framework of the church community list here's Matthew Mark Luke and John is Lucas mark was one these Gospels are what protects it and holds it together EMM they are the framework to back Pentecost for after the framework was put up there is a case where entire a mother who then Pentecost came into existence Pentecost is equal eXistenZ here and this book of Acts is actually the foundation or the doctrine of apostles and prophets as it fundamentally opposed to Lizzie prophet that's Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone - Christos Hindu la Piedra and now I'm going back to the book of Acts so we're gonna read a lot of Scripture so I pray you have your Bibles ready to go okay almost Italian dove which is key to this until let's let's go to verse 2 now until the day in which he was taken up those who know they chose after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the Apostles whom he had chosen estar en que en toda manda Mentos to Santo a los apostolis Kisco yo where recibido Arriba to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs and escuela después de very precisely those represent opy muchas premise being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God he showed himself alive say most royal people that's why there is no man that should ever come behind a pulpit for this is kim nam breaking it has no right to preach unless he's come face-to-face with that pillar of fire rice has come to him and has showed himself alive to him can you know a Lisa Graham was throw people Wayne because that's when we become witnesses of his and being assembled together with them as cantando second names commanded that they should not depart from Jerusalem little canister first in the Houston Lynn but wait for the promise of the Father see no kiss present in the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me yo is this dijo let me hold your hair and go with me to Luke 24 ha Miami San Lucas dinky Quattro 49 what anyway and he says and behold I send the promise of my father upon you Akio Morita promised Adelphi de otros tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high the Ksenia mestizos the potentially lost oh how many believe that when toes go clean that was him he said Terry I Iike the house and that is the hardest thing for us to do today is to tarry is that the word Terry means to wait wait it's pity but we can't wait very long why man we heard it on - on Wednesday no he Muslim miracle because we have only an eight second eight seconds before we're distracted things that right doper demos is almost ready those 8 seconds okay let me see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 another thoughts already come you're already thinking of what am I gonna help what am I gonna cook for lunch today what's gonna happen I'm work tomorrow I made a major we're distracted I enjoyed that message it's nothing but the truth may well say yo quanis him in second the promise of the Father was that he would send the Holy Ghost upon us which is his spirit and that he would abide with you forever what's he mean the Spirit of Truth who the world cannot receive only letter that can receive the promise of the Father what is it okay it come to vindicate the word to prove that the word is so but a probe our killer polymerase and see that ought to put the church in action next yeah that ought to put the church in action give up until iglesia cuz when the church comes into action another book of Acts is being written oh my let's get back to acts now chapter 1 where we were at IHS Cuffy for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence memos about the cells at his feet to sanctum and when they were there for her come together they asked him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel in towel Esperanto diciendo Senora satirist reign o Israel and este tiempo but what they didn't know was that the promise of the father Erik Allah promises and poverty is what was going to restore the kingdom and I look but it was going to restore it in a spiritual form not a natural form yet there with me here they had they didn't understand that because they were promised the Holy Ghost but I guess it is prometheus because but they didn't even know what the Holy Ghost was serenebean Carol is free to son how many believe that I know that has believers become okay again we have been promised the Holy Ghost signals that from a fearless speed to something yet many don't even know what the Holy Ghost is encased many don't know what the Holy Ghost was given for okay for that though they did not understand because they have the man Jesus in front of them break loose delante but now this man going to ascend back to the office of the Father he was sent there I love fish yourself and he was going to send his spirit back to the church with that spirit in the church listen it would write a book of Acts my lips let's keep on reading here window he said unto them it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power came by the Busan to Seoul a protest and this is the time as this as simple and the season he lets the Sun but it's not for you to know because as human beings CACO most areas to man we don't grab we don't understand these neighbor to carnal but he placed the times and the season push all those tempo sinlessness harness in his power in stewpot they stand there the times and the seasons are not anywhere else but in his power come on that's what the father placed it is Don del padre like busto let's lift as this begins to unfold watch this down is it look at these things so the father's power is or in the father's power is times and seasons and this is a letter sent by the Telos tiempo see lessons done and no one knows except he that receives that power in as no muscle can receive a star processor then by the Holy Ghost in this is pointless that'ss comes to dwell in you when you will recognize your day and its message let us test with the ice woman's sake that's when you know and more recognized or reckon when it is your time and your season to act this with you push yourself but Atwater not until you've carried no statistic spit us not until the Holy Ghost has come to you will you know when to act Sam come on twatter are you with me you all know it without that no I saw very loosely that's why we're always trying to do a lot of things and it's not even in here it's not even his will but as my sister said muchas cosas us in those who were trying to do God a service and it's not his will many time that was the silliest rewarding rescuing why because we are trying to force the issue right to make it that season of it that case we'll say is not the time for that but when the Holy Ghost comes upon the Inga verse 8 but ye shall receive power that it was so does your mother receive it for then and the word power there means Dunamis and we've heard that which means dynamite it looks huge shall receive dynamite give us a spirit in a melee received power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you Wizkid is protective Inga's focused and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem he was the lamb in all of Judea and in Samaria of Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth Jesus began to do and to teach dancing yet but when you receive this power this Holy Ghost and receive a step further then you go to the uttermost part is mostly coast and the worst word uttermost Elop Alaura means the final place or time in a series of events it's a new era FINA they'll necessary the Amano's Jesus was the logos embody the History Center logos increments for the first time the logos put on flesh was in Jesus for the premiere of risky Lobos se puso Kevin if we kill him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead the way of Pentecost when love goes broke up because the logo says but each one received a portion that belonged to them guiltless do not pull and they became witnesses except and His Holy Ghost in his church you know let's pick the center see let's go to the last one that would that would be that would come in find the last one to the uttermost parts that's why we're going next month to agonda maybe that last one might be a colored man kiss a salute the most el nombre de kerlor we'll see what the God has for us are there kids no kids in your DNA but let's go on here that was the security Jesus said his loose dqo John 15:1 can follow me with these things follow me wherever I'm going then you will understand the message at the end one second John 15:5 1kings Jesus is talking he said I am the vine is that your soy la Vida okay your neighbor's falling asleep you just neighbor wake up your neighbor your neighbor I need some help this morning it always get us luiseño I looked out there and I saw a few eyes and balls go like this oh they're getting ready to roll out I'm trying to save you from from getting embarrassed take that don't do that what is now in church when you're no wait second you don't realize it and you're just doing the rope-a-dope sheesh I'm just trying to help you this morning so tell you that your neighbor fawn is it a neighbor or neighbor I am the vine you say yo soy Levine and you are the branches he was pompano who's he talking to I kidding the stuff I am the vine jesus said and you are the branches he that abideth in me in capitalist and I in here with me the same bring us forth much fruit as to here I'm which or food or without me you can do nothing but cuz it's me not without the Holy Ghost which is the lies you know we can't do nothing no queremos I said I am the vine your so you are the branches someone who spend Jesus is telling us let's get it straight right now you gotta understand Dickens and now is Jesus the vine or the branch levena or loose Pam I know he said you are the branches because but is he the vine or the branch arraylist depends on which tree you're talking about they've been the catalyst at the end oh are you talking about the groom tree or the bride tree oh we're gonna give you something good here in a moment I tell you what I'm saying when okey well now if that vine where the siesta bean yes what put forth the first branch what el primero Brussels and out of that branch is a blast oh he wrote a book of Acts askew only released when the second branch will make another book of Acts I said Oh totally rodia chos oh my mama that's why we named it another book of Acts where's the most ultra liberal issue and the third branch will make another book of Acts I said utterly religious and every branch that comes out of the vine Brussels que viene de esta V will be the same as the first branch city what kill primero and if the power of God is dl+ you ever puts forth another church sig upon a book like this yeah it'll be another Pentecost a ghost an experience not a denomination not an organisation or Kinesis but if it puts forth another branch the pony October on it'll be another Pentecostal church I don't think this yeah Pentecost and another book of Acts you're totally religion will be wrote right behind because it's the Church of God but guess they listed such second church rises up let's take this just a livin the mystical body of Christ will have the same signs ella misma a little while and the world will see me no more you shall see me it was so true swear I will be with you even in you in every branch in Nebraska he promised that he'll promise you I want you to look around kid okay well how many here are a branch but the SEC East on some grass to look around your brother and sister our branch so the Madison man and he said I will be

esta unique shall be seven eyes he rested us yet behold I will engrave the gravy Joey what is it what does it mean to engrave the graving can you see this cool pattern it means that I will carve out the sculpture or the image in school to determine a of the invisible God I said you seem basically when the logos will come forward when the logo says the what was he doing he had to carve out the form for my copter form the image of that invisible god market this became the flash or the tabernacle where God dwelt in turn a clone that you'll see my mother and I will remove the iniquity of the land in one day the I will engrave the graving second Corinthians three we're gonna prove it all by the Bible say you a for instance capital o dress verse 6 when you have it say men who also hath made
